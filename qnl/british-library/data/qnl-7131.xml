GAZETTEER C&amp;jb-y ® ^ OP THE PERSIAN GULF. 'OMAN, AND CENTRAL ARABIA BY J. G. LOEIMEE, C.I.E, INPIAN CIVIL SERV1CK VOL. I HISTORICAL. PART II CALCUTTA SUPERINTENDENT GOVERNMENT PRINTING, INDIA 1915INTRODU CTION. HE Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, ''Oman and Central Arabia consists of two volumes, the first volume being a history of the Persian Gulf Eegion and its surrounding countries, the second a geographical dictionary covering the same area. The second volume was published in 1908. The first volume had been all but completed for the Press by the late Mr. Lorimer at the time of his death in the beginning of 1914, the only portions in fact of the work then remaining to be written being the ' Introduction and the Table of contents/' These have been prepared and the volume completed for the Press by the undersigned. The explanation of the t( system of transliteration^ referred to in the last paragraph of the introduction to the second volume, has for conve nience of binding been formed into a separate note and will be found as Appendix S at page 2737 of Part 11 of this volume. A full explanation as to the division and contents of the second volume has been given by Mr. Lorimer in the introduction to that work and it only remains therefore to give a similar explanation in regard to Volume I. * Volume I has been divided into twelve chapters geographically: Chapter 1 deals with the Persian Gulf region as a whole and the re maining chapters with each of the main political divisions in turn into which that region is divided, commencing with 'Oman, continuing with the States on the Western shores of the Gulf, Central Arabia, Turkish Iraq, the Persian districts on the eastern shores of the Gulf and ending with the chapter on Makran. Each of the above chapters has been sub-divided into certain definite ' periods' covering in some cases the reign of a Shah or Sultan, the rule of a Shaikh^ the regime of a Viceroy, and in others arbitrary divi sions of time based on outstanding land-marks in the history of the State concerned. Each of these ' periods ' follows similar though not identical lines, referring in turn to the topics most prominent during the particular iC period ' under review.Under mch a system it follows necessarily that a topic of considerable prominence during one period may have no sequel in the period immedi ately following though it may possibly be^ and often is^ continued in a later one. In order therefbre to enable the reader to follow up the thread of any one particular subject a ' detailed table of contents ' has been prepared on the following lines. The various (e periods ' in each chapter have been given a number. Each period has again been sub-divided into subject headings ' each of which has been lettered. When any particular subject is continued in a later period an entry to that effect in italics immediately below the subject heading' con cerned has been made, giving the number of the r&lt; periodand the letter of the u subject heading ^ in which the continuation will be found. It should be noted however that though the above system has been found capable of application in the majority of chapters and periods, instances occur throughout the volume in which special subjects (especi ally British policy and relations) are so inextricably woven into the general history of the State under review that no definite sub-division of its ' periods' into subject headings^ is possible and in such cases the sequel to a particular subject can only be traced by a careful perusal of the general text. In addition to the twelve chapters referred to above Volume I includes a number of Appendices, also written by the late Mr. Lorimer dealing separately with subjects of special importance or interest in the Persian Gulf Eegion, and also a series of genealogical trees of the ruling families of States in the same area. A table of chapters, annexures, appendices and genealogical trees will be found at page 5 and the detailed table of contents^ at 9. For convenience of binding Volume I has been divided into three parts. Part I consists of the first nine chapters. the General History of the Persian Gulf Region, the Histories of 'Oman, of the Arab States on the western shores of the Persian Gulf, of Central Arabia and of urkish Iraq, m fact of what may conveniently be termed the ' Arabian ' portion of the Volume. of'Arah'sf fly v remaim,lg three cha P ters ' of th e Histories of Arabian of th p c 0 a S t and Islands, and of Makran, in other words of the Per S1 an ' section of the work and of the AppendicesM() Hi For facility of reference, the Introduction/^ the f4 Table of chapters ' and the 'detailed table of contents ' have been prefixed to both Parts I and II Part III consists of a portfolio containing genealogical trees, maps, etc. L.

Of events in the Perso-Arabian province of •'Arabistan, which has generally been under Persian influence but is inhabited principally by 1 Arabs^ we have little information until the middle of the 18th century is ibar . reached. The situation of the tract; isolated as it is from the neighs bouring territories by mountains^ rivers or marshes, seems for long to have protected it from the interference, unless occasional, of Persian ai in Tmu and Turkish officials. icial 'Oiaj, 17TH CENTURY * ' In 1604, when the Portuguese Jew Pedro Teixeira passed up the Cond^on Shatt-al-'Arab, the whole of the country immediately to the east of that i n river was ruled by Mubarak-bin-Mutlub, an Arab chief who maintained a claim to Basrah and was perpetually at war with the Turks. The Turks had many forts or blockhouses upon the river to protect their territory against raids by Mubarak^s subjects and the most important among these, one of the functions of which was to secure the anchorage of large ships visiting Basrah, was situated on the Persian side of the stream at a point opposite Saraji, about three miles below Basrah. The chief places in Mubarak's territory were Hawizeh, ' Magdom }} (probably Maqtu^ a place on the right bank of the Karun, twenty miles below the present Nasiri), and Doraq (the modern Fallahiyeh); and from this fact it would seem that he was one of the so-called 'Walis of Hawizeh ^ who ruledt, the greater part of ^Arabistan before the rise of the Ka^ab tribe. The plains of ^Arabistan adjoining the Shatt-al-^Arab lay at * The chief general authority for the history of'Arabistan frooi 1600 to 1763 is Mr- J. A. Saldanha 's Selections from State Papers, ^Bombay, regarding the East India Company's connection with the Persian Qulf } with a Summary of Events, 1600—1800, printed in 1905. The Travels of Pedro Teixeira, 1902, referring to 1604, and the Travels ofSig. Pietro della Voile, 1665. referring to 1625, are of anti quarian interest. The following are of value in connection with Ka ab affairs: Niebuhr 's Description de VAralie, 1774, and Voyage en Arahie, 1776 ; Major Rawlinson 's Memorandum on the Dispute between Turhey and Persia, 1844 , and Ainsworth's Personal Narrative of the Euphrates Expedition, 1888. t The legendary history of these Walis is related by Layard in his Description of the Province of Khuzistdn, 1846.Affairs in * Arabistan about 1625. Immigration of the Ka'ab into 'Arabis- tfin. this time widely waste, not barren, but untilled for fear of the Turks f and it seems that the Portuguese, when they were on bad terms with the Turks, sometimes made liberal offers to Mubarak to induce him to enter into an offensive and defensive alliance with them against the Ottoman, but that he did not respond to their advances. In 1625, at the time of the Italian Pietro della Valleys visit to Basrah, Mubarak had been dead for some years. On his decease his brother, named Mansur, had been appointed by the Persian monarch to the governorship of Hawizeh,'* but, finding the yoke of Shah ''Ahhas too heavy for his liking, he had entered into a treasonable correspondence with the Pasha of Basrah, then Afrasiyab, with a view to asserting his independence. In order to bring his loyalty to the test, the Shah, on the occasion of the successful expedition against Baghdad in 1623, required Mansur to join the Persian army; but Imam Quli Khan, though on the march from Shiraz to Baghdad he waited for him many days at Hawizeh, could not induce him to move. After this the Shah several times summoned Mansur to wait on him at Isfahan, but the cautious Shaikh, while he invariably returned a soft answer, did not obey; and at length Shah ^Abbas became incensed and ordered him to repair to Isfahan on pain of losing his head. The only answer, however, which Mansur returned to this ultimatum was: That if the Shah was King in Persia, himself was King in Hawizeh, and that he did not value him ; 39 and Imam Quli Khan was accordingly despatched with a large force to capture or kill Mansur and to set up in his place his nephew Muhammad, a son of the late Mubarak, who had been educated at the Safavi court. In the latter part of his task the Persian general was successful; but Mansur escaped and sought refuge, accompanied by 500 followers, with the Pasha of Basrah, 'Ali Pasha, who granted him a place to settle at in Basrah territory closely adjoining Hawizeh. The former subjects of Mansur acquiesced in the installation of Muhammad as their governor on the condition, which Imam Quli Khan granted, that no Persian garrison should be left at Hawizeh. These events occurred at the begin ning of 1625, immediately before the Persian movement against Basrah in March of that year. The Ka ab tribe, who were afterwards during more than one genera tion to play a leading part in the politics of ^Arabistan, appear to have * Tks may have be en m i^ 1 , for w0 find that on the 8th of January 1622 at lll t ere Kfcan 0 f Shiraz had then arrived on his way to attack Hormuz, a great teast and triuapb was nlso made for the joyful news of the King's taking in of a great Countne in Arabia, and of Aweiza the chiefe Oitie of that Countrie 'imm all, I! \ reiji rfioi; 1627 entered the province at some time in the seventeenth century ; and their first settlements, among which the principal was Ghibban, seem to have been situated near the head o£ the Khor Qanaqeh branch of Khor Musa. The quarter from which they came and the reasons for their change of habitat are not certainly known.* PERIOD 1700-63. Conduct of the Wali of 'Arabistan, 1722. In 17 2'Z, when Afghan invaders were attacking the monarch of Persia in his capital, the Persian forces defending Isfahan were commanded by a Wali of ' Arabistan whose conduct, especially in refusing to second the spirited efforts of the Armenians of J ulfa, caused his loyalty to his master to be seriously suspected. On the fall of the place, * The principal authorities on tlie early history of the Ka'ab are Niebuhr in his Description de VArahie, 1774, page 276, and his Voyage en Aralie, 1776, page 186; Major Rawlinson in his Memorandum on the Dispute between Turkey and Persia, 1844; Sir A. H. Lnyard in his Description of the Province of Khuzistdn, 1846; and the article ' Ka'ab ' in the Geographical Volume of this Gazetteer, page 961. The information embodied in the last was obtained from Muhammareh. Major Rawlinson insists on the existence of a close connection between the Ka'ab, both before and after their appearance in 'Arabistan, and the Turkish Government; but Niebuhr and local tradition are silent on this point, and M^jor Kawlinson, in his Memoran* dum, has not clearly distinguished facts capable of documentary or other proof from ihQ ex parte assertions of Turkish officials, or from his own historical speculations and geographical conjectures. The following extract from a letter, addressed by the Agent and Council at Basrah on the 9th April 1767 to the Honourable Court of Directors, corroborates to some extent the view of Major Rawlinson; but it is open to the criticism that it represents the opinion of an Agent (Mr. Moore), 'who was notoriously pro-Turk and anti-Persian in his proclivities : ' The Chaubis originally a subject of the Turks, and has for many years possessed a considerable territory (&lt; within their dominions bordering upon the Persian Empire, for which he ought, 'and did for some years, annually to pay (stela large sum into the treasury of 'this Pachaship. A few j'ears after the death of Nadir Shah, and in the troubles that 'followed it, he also got possession of a territory in the Persian dominions; by 'this means he became a subject of both powers. The territory of Gaban and ' its districts is the name of that he possesses on the Turkish, and Durack, that 'in (?on) the Persian (? side).' Tradition, we may add, seems to point to a date somewhat earlier than 1683, which is mentioned by Major Rawlinson, as that of the first settlement of the Ka'ab in 'Arabistan ; and, with reference to this date and to the supposed unbroken connection of the Ka'ab with the Turks, it should not be forgotten that Basrah only came under the direct control of the Turks about 1669, that some years previously to 1691 it fell into the hands of the Persians, and that the Turks did not resume possession of it until about 1695. m ahowever, the Wali was not put to death, as were other traitors from the Persian side, by the victorious Afghan Commander Mahmud: but he was disgraced, and his possessions in the province of Khuzistan, that is of 'Arabistan, —were given to his younger brother. There is nothing to show to what family this Wali of J Arabistan belonged, but that he may have been a member of the old ruling family of Hawizeh appears not improbable. From 1722 to 1734 the Ka'ab tribe are said to have been ruled by a Shaikh named Faraj Ullah. i f Growth of the power of the Ka'ab, 1700-66, ^ ; i Seizure of Doraq by the Ka'ab, 1747. The Ka'ab Shaikh Sal man, 1737- 66. After this the power of the Ka ; ab in ^Arabistan began rapidly to increase; and in or about 1747 they wrested Doraq, now Fallahiyeh^ from their neighbours the Afshar or ^Aushar Turks, who, with that place as their capital, had hitherto been the dominant tribe in the country. Their success was attributed to aid from the Arab Wali of Hawizeh, following a stratagem of their own. The progress of the Ka^ab at this time was largely due to the energy and ability of their chief. Shaikh Salman or Sulaiman, under whom it is pro bable that their numbers grew rapidly large by accretion, as even at the present day a tribe in ^Arabistan may grow under a popular and success ful leader. Salman succeeded his brother Tahmaz Khanfar, who was murdered in 1735, and Khanfar's son Bandar, who ruled from 1735 to 1737 and was then also murdered; his own reign lasted from 1737 to 1766; and except during the last two years of it another brother, named ^Othman, was associated with him in power. Salman obtained, or maintained, his virtual independence by playing off the Persian and Turkish authorities against one another ; and before long he was ruler over a great part of the districts which are now Fallahiyeh and Muhammareh without interference on the part of either power; while his influence in some measure extended also to those of Ahwaz, Jarrahi, and even Hindiyam First expedition of Karim Khan against the Ka'ab, 1757. In 1757 Karim Khan, whose authority in Persia was not yet fully consolidated, made an expedition against the Ka^ab for the purpose of He1629 pidlT er; wmp .Tarrahij subjugating' them and obliging them to pay revenue; but difficulties in other and more important quarters prevented his remaining long in the country; and he withdrew after receiving a small sum as tribute. Difficulties between the Ka'ab and the Turkish Government, and first two Anglo-Turkish expeditions against the tribe, 1758-63. The very partial success of Karim Khan against the Ka'ab in 1757 only rendered Shaikh Salman more confident and aggressive than before; and the fact that in the very next year he built his first Gallivat seems to show that the advantage of possessing a maritime force had been somehow brought home to his mind by the Persian expedition against him. In 1761 the Turks, following the example of the Persians, embarked on operations against the Ka'ab and achieved, with British assistance, a temporary success; but in 176^ the Ka'ab blockaded Basrah by water, and in 1763 they invaded the Turkish districts on the western side of the Shatt-al-^Arab. A second Anglo-Turkish expedition against the Ka'ab followed: it also was inconclusive. The events here shortly referred to are more fully described in the history of Turkish ^Iraq, to which they properly belong. KARIM KHAN. 1763-79.* Hostilities between the Ka^ab on the one side and the Turks and the British on the other were renewed in 1765, but not until a second attempt at reducing the tribe had been made by Karim Khan. Second expedition of Karim Khan against the Ka'ab, 1765. At the beginning of May 1765, Karim Khan was encamped at Qubban in ^Arabistan with a large force and had requested the co-opera- *The chief authorities for the Zand period (1763 —1795) in 'Arahistan are Mr&gt; J. A. Saldanha's Selections from State Papers ) Homhay, 1600—1800, and Niebuhr's Voyage on Arabic, 1776, mentioned in the footnote to the title of Chapter Eleventh.1630 tion o£ the Turks against the Ka'ab; which was readily promised but could not be immediately afforded. Escape o£ the In consequence of the unpreparedness of the Turks, Shaikh Salman, K a ' a b across w bo now possessed a fleet of 10 or 12 war Gallivats besides some the fehatt-al- r - m i 'Arab. 70 trading Danaks, had no difficulty m eluding Kanm Khan by crossing one stream or back-water after another ; and ultimately he found safety in Ottoman territory on the western bank of the Shatt-al- Arab. The Vakil, disgusted by the non-arrival of his allies, abandoned the campaign just at the moment when the Turks had completed their preparations and were on the point of starting from Basrah ; and about the middle of May he apparently broke up his force, sending a part of it to join in the operations which were then being commenced by his general Amir Kuhneh Khan against Mir Mahanna, the piratical chief of Rig. Destruction Karlm Khan had however been able, besides destroying Doraq^ tL^slbleh which he found deserted, to inflict a very serious and permanent injury dam. upon the rebellious tribe. The lands of Qubban, the original capital of the Ka'ab in ' Arabistan, seem from a recent examination of the ground to have been watered by two canals or streams from the Karun, of which one left the river by the Marid creek and fell into Khor Qanaqeh near Qubban, while the other, known as the Salmaneh or Salmaniyeh possibly from the name of Shaikh Salman himself, had its head near an island similarly named. The supply of water in the former was de pendent on a masonry dam, of which the remains are still visible close to the entrance of the Marid creek. Opposite to Marid, on the right bank of the Karun, was another Ka'ab settlement, Sableh or Sableh, by which name the dam was commonly called. Karim Khan, in the course of his operations, demolished the Sableh dam, thereby greatly impairing the prosperity of Qubban ; and it seems probable that the Sableh settlement also, of which nothing is heard in the later history of the Ka'ab tribe, was annihilated on the same occasion. It is probable that the transfer of the Ka^ab capital from Qubban to Fallahiyeh took place at this time. Third Anglo-Turkish expedition against the Ka'ab and depredation of the tribe upon British shipping, 1765. Third Anglo. The Turks, as related in the history of Turkish ^Iraq, had now pedition, * secured British aid at Basrah and were unwilling to abandon, merely1631 (fe) on account of the withdrawal of tlie Persians from tlie affair^ their pro- June 1765; jected campaign against the Ka'ab j but they carried it out in such a spiritless manner, without even crossing the Shatt-al-^Arab into the enemy's country or making use of a British vessel which they had engaged, that they actually suffered more loss than they inflicted. Before the return of the Turks to Basrah, a nominal peace was arranged between them and the Ka^ab, in which the British—so the Ka^ab Shaikh afterwards asserted—were not mentioned ; and not long afterwards the name of Salman, whom the hostile attitude of the British had greatly exasperated, became known even in distant Europe through an auda cious attack, unprecedented in the annals of the Persian Gulf, upon British shipping. Capture by the Ka'ab of the Sally,' 18tb July 1765. had i 1 ' After the failure of the Anglo-Turkish expedition the British repre sentatives at Basrah had at first some fear of consequences ; but, having overcome it-, they sent a sloop or yacht belonging to the Company to Kharag, where she arrived about the 20th of June, to make it generally known that there was no longer any danger from the Ka^ab. On the 10th of July, however, part of the Ka^ab fleet was seen near Kharag, apparently united to that of Mir Mahanna, with whom Shaikh Salman was ordinarily on bad terms, but whom he now resembled in being at war with Persia and in having a grievance against the British; and on the 18th of July, as the ' Sally,a two-masted snow from Madras, was sailing up the Shatt-al- ; Arab by night, she was met not far from Basrah by several boats, to which the officer of the watch paid no attention, but from which a number of Ka^ab presently threw themselves on board the 'Sally' with loud shouts, capturing her almost before the captain could leave his cabin. Meanwhile the Company^s yacht, which had left Kharag on the 9th Capture by of July under convoy of the a Fort William, ' a Bengal ship of three ^^a'ab of masts, for fear of Mir Mahanna's Gallivats, had arrived in the river ; yacht, 19th and, on the day alter the misfortune to the ' Sally, 33 she too was en- countered and taken by the Ka^ab, as they were going down the river with their prize. The success of the Arabs did not end here, for near the mouth of the p a P^ 1,e by the Ka ab of nver they came upon the 'Fort William ' herself, whose commander, the ''Fort seeing two British vessels already in their power stood back for the Gulf July to gain sea-room for his ship ; but she unfortunately ran aground upon 1765. the bar. The Ka^ab, perceiving what had happened, waited until the ebb threw her upon her side and so rendered her guns useless, when they1632 Consequent negotiations between tlie Agent at Basrah, tha Ka'ab Shaikh and the Turks, July- August 1765. boarded and captured her also, taking the whole crew prisoners. The traveller Niehuhr narrowly escaped becoming a passenger by this vessel from Khwag to Basrah : had it been otherwise an interesting chapter might have been added to his journal. On the « Fort William ' floating again with the rise of the tide, the Ka'ab carried her off to Qubban along with the ' Sally 'and the yacht, presumably by way of Khor Musa and Khor Qanaqeh. The vdne of the two larger vessels and their cargoes was afterwards estimated at Rs. 3,90,930. The East India Company's Agent at Basrah, Mr. Wrench, on the assumption that the Ka'ab were subjects of the Porte, immediately applied to the Mutasallim of Basrah for redress ; and the Mutasallim, accepting the position, at once sent a messenger to Shaikh Salman with letters from himself and the Agent. The answer of the Shaikh, received on the 36th of July, was that he had a claim against the East India Company arising out of proceedings of their Resident, Mr. Shaw, and their Agent, Mr. Price, the former of whom he represented as having seized lands, the property of his subjects, at Magil and Silaik; but this was a mere falsehood, for the lands in question were known to have been regularly purchased by Mr. Shaw from the rightful owners. The Agent was successful, however, in obtaining the release of Captains Phillips and Holland with all their officers, but only by sending the Shaikh, at his own request, ' a treaty of peace to be continued on the old footing between the Hon'ble Company and him,' and Salman refused to restore the captured ships until the treaty should have been approved and returned by the Bombay Government. Tlie Agent, who evidently regarded the treaty with the Shaikh ' as a matter of form, only calculated on purpose to get our people out of his hands,' then proceeded to discuss the situation with the Turkish authorities, who promised, on condition of being supported by a British naval force, to attack the KVab by land, and agreed that the British on these terms should receive half the spoils of war, excepting of course the British vessels taken, which, if recovered, were to go entirely to the owners. In addressing the Government of Bombay, the Agent and Council laid much stress on the interruption to commerce which would ensue if the Ka'ab Shaikh were not quickly brought to his senses; and they recom mended the despatch from India ' of two at least of the capital cruizers ' with the f Eagle 3 or any small vessels that draw but little water, also113 vw 1633 'four or more Gallivats which last will be much wanted to pursue him ' up the creek, but which however we submit to your better judgment.' During the month of September 1765 the Ka^ab occupied themselves, as explained in the history of Turkish ^Iraq, in stripping the date plan tations in Turkish territory immediately below Basrah of their fruit ; and their example was followed by the Muntafik tribe, who also moved into the district on pretext of defending it against the Ka^ab. Fourth Anglo-Turkish expedition against the Ka'ab, 1766. The gravity of the situation seems to have been appreciated by the an a Bombay Government, who, at the beginning of January 1766, complied orders of the with the suggestions of the Agent and Council by despatching a naval of 0V Bombay, and military force to the Gulf under the command of Captain Lesly January Baillie and Captain John Brewer. It consisted of the grab ' Bombay,' ' the ketch 'Success,' the schooners Dolphin' and 'Tyger,' the Gallivat 'Wolf,' and the storeship a Fame, ' the last mentioned of these being a chartered vessel, and of 50 European infantry, 15 European artillery, 150 sepoys and 25 lascars. Captain Baillie, at starting, received orders to establish a naval blockade of the Ka'ab on his way to Basrah, by stationing some of his vessels at suitable points. The instructions sent to the Agent and Council were that they should, immediately on the blockade being formed, address a direct demand to the Ka^ab for restitution of the British ships and their cargoes and for compensation on account of their detention and of the expense incurred by the East India Company in sending the expedition; and, should these points be conceded, they were then, on condition of the Ka'ab Shaikh undertaking never in future to molest the Company^s trade, to engage that the Company on their part should not again interfere in any dispute between him and his neighbours. If, however, the Shaikh proved impracticable, the Agent and Council were to have recourse to the Turks and propose joint action with them against the Ka^ab, upon condition of: the Turkish forces being prepared to start immediately and of the Turkish officials agreeing to make satisfactory arrangements for the discharge of a large debt then due by one Haji Yusuf tothe Company; but, if these requirements were not fulfilled, the British force was to ' proceed alone and pursue the most effectual measures for re-taking our vessels and destroying those of the Chaub.'1634 Prooeedings of t^e Agent and Council at Pasrah on arrival of the expedition, March-May X766. Repulse of a British attack on Mansur fort, May 1766. Captain Baillie, with the vessels under his command, touched at Bushehr on the 10th of March 1766 and left again for Basrah on the 13th. It appears that the Agent and Council at Basrah, partly because they believed that a separate peace between themselves and the Ka'ab would not avail to restore commercial security, while it would certainly injure their relations with the Turks, partly because they had led the Pasha and Mutasallim to rely on British assistance being granted, and partly because, in the opinion of the Commanders, the British force was too weak to attempt operations on land without allies, took upon themselves to disregard the instructions which they had received from Bombay for dealing with the Ka'ab alone in the first instance, and at once proceeded to arrange for the co-operation of a Turkish force. One preliminary engagement only seems to have taken place between the vessels of the British expedition and the Ka'ab fleet; and the latter having had the worst of it, retired ' with a most artful alacrity into the neighbourhood of Doraq, where they were at once safe from naval attack. The Turks as usual were slow to move, and, at the Mutasallim's request, an unsuccessful application was made to the Shaikh of Bushehr for his assistance; but eventually, before the end of May, a Turkish camp was formed somewhere below Basrah; and the British snow ' Tartar/' which had meanwhile arrived from the Gulf, was sent to lie beside it. The bulk of the British expeditionary force had now, apparently, been collected in or near Kbor Musa; it was under the command of Captain Andrew Nesbitt, probably on account of the illness of Captain Baillie, who died only a few weeks later. Towards the end of May, Captain Nesbitt sent Lieutenant Button with a number of armed boats «to reconnoitre and examine the river of * Dourackand the result was the discovery of a number of native vessels, which were lying, without their upper masts, in a small creek near to a newly-erected fort named Mansur. Captain Nesbitt, though he feared that little could be effected without the assistance of the Turks, sent the 'Success,' 'Dolphin,' and 'Wolf,' along with a launch, the barge of the 'Bombay,' and two or three armed Trankis, to destroy the vessels sighted,-a task which they effectually performed; but a further attempt to take the fort itself was unsuccessful, 'for want of water and people to drag the guns, being . * Th9 det f 80f f e are not easily followed, a S but few names are given Donm J' l. an t T 0 ' n tlle8e are identifiabls ^ certainty.

The casualties however were small, consisting of Lieutenant (not Captain) Nesbitt and a European gunner killed and four others wounded. Before this check occurred^ the Ka^ab Shaikh had opened a Negotiations correspondence with the Agent and Council at Basrah, to whom he even and^ounc^ made proposals for an accommodation, and, in reply, he had been informed of the British demands; but it was not believed that he Turks! and had, as yet, any serious desire for a settlement. The Agent and Council also endeavoured, without success, to induce 1766, the Mutasallim of Basrah to take the field with his troops. The excuse of that official was, at first, that he must await reinforcements which would probably be sent him from Baghdad \ and, after the news of the British reverse had been received, he declined to move on the ground that the Kehiyah was actually on his way from the capital with a body of troops, which proved to be the case. That the Turks were thus, in the end, induced to move was probably due to an announcement by the Agent that the services of the British squadron—some vessels of which already stood in need of repairs, while sickness, though the hot weather had not yet begun, was increasing on board—must, if continued beyond the end of Jane, be paid for by the Turkish Government at the rate of 1,000 Tumans a month j and such was the anxiety of the Pasha lest he should be left to deal with the Ka'ab alone, or lest the Company's factory should be withdrawn, as was also threatened, from Basrah, that he readily agreed to these somewhat* stringent terms. The Kehiyah, Muhammad or Mahmud Agha, ultimately arrived at Basrah on the 25th of June, bringing with him about 1,500 men; and a few days later he joined the Turkish camp, relieving the Mutasallim not only of the command of the military forces but also of the principal civil or political control. A letter which the Agent addressed to Karim Khan, the Vakil of Persia, requesting him not to afford asylum to any fugitive Ka'ab, remained unanswered. To trace with precision the movements of the forces employed in Turkish 'Arabistan is impossible; but it would seem that, while the British operated from the side of Khor Musa, the Turks had their base July-August 1766. * According to a letter from the Agency, the rate fixed was in excess of the actual cost of maintaining the squadron ; but there were, of course, other heavy items of expense to the Company, such as wear and tear of ships and loss of profitable employment. 113 A1636 somewhere on the Karun. One of the first proceeding's of the Turkish Commander was to order the Captain Pasha to proceed with all his galleys to Qubban, where he duly* arrived in safety^ accompanied by the British Gallivat ' f Wolf;^ and so great was the moral effect produced by his appearance there that not only did the Ka'ab garrison evacuate the Qubban fort without resistance, but a whole tribe of Shaikh Salman^s subjects, those who were accounted his best musketeers, deserted him and came in, partly to the Kehiyah^s camp and partly to the British ships, asking protection for themselves and their families. The Ka^ab Shaikh was now supposed to be in great straits, it was even reported that ' his troops wou'd all desert him, but that he keeps their chiefs continually within his sight and on the least suspicion commits the most horrid barbarities/ 5 and a strong impression prevailed that, if the Turks would only advance into the heart of his country, he must yield; but the Turkish Commander had now begun to discover pretexts for delay. Fresh overtures were made by Shaikh Salman, at this time, to the British authorities; and advantage was taken of them to stimulate the Kehiyah, who did not desire a settlement at this stage, to more vigorous action. In the end he was persuaded to advance against the Ka^ab, and promised to push on until he should reach Khor Musa a-nd encamp beside the British fleet. Accidental On the 23rd of August, no junction between the British squadron deswL of and tlie Turkish ] and forces having as yet been effected.

Grhanim, however, instead of proposing reasonable terms, behaved with great insolence; and Captain Nesbitt,, discovering by various indications that a treacherous massacre of himself and his whole party was intended, took the initiative and attacked the Arabs. In this affair, which occurred about 5 o'clock in the afternoon, the British had one European and one sepoy killed and Hve Europeans and three Indians wounded, while on the other side Ghanim was dangerously wounded and several Shaikhs and others were killed and wounded. About 10 o'clock the same evening, Captain Nesbitt attempted to recapture the 'Sally' and the ' Fort William ' by boarding, but the enemy at P5sL A wmlr tft) h li ara had : b r d&lt;JStro y ed in 1765 - it k probabla that the Kapitan Qanaqeh Q ban ^ the Shatt ' the Gulf, Khor Musa a D d Khor beeaLtlhatkTo\ 0 Z 0t ^t CCOUntthisGll5nim ' if he Was the same who afterwards became Sha.kh of the Ka ah. was a nephew not a son of Shaikh Salman.1637 the last moment set them on fire, and the British were consequently unable to do more than ensure their complete destruction by standing by until they bad burned down to the water's edge. The Agent and Council^ who had previously given orders that persons appearing to treat for peace on behalf of the Ka^ab should be sent under a safe conduct to Basrah, censured Captain Nesbitt for having presumed to treat with Ghanim him self, especially in such dangerous surroundings; but they agreed that, ' on account of the bravery the common men had shown in the affair/' some booty taken on this occasion ' shou'd be publickly disposed of for their benefit on the quarter-deck/' On the 30th of August, a week after the incidents just described, Concentra- ^ Captain Nesbitt brought the Turkish galleys away from Qubban, where foe ^a'ab the Turkish camp then was, and wrote to the Kehiyah, who seems to have ^ been at some other place, to march by land to the ' lower Ka'ab fort.'' tember 1766, At the same time a military force under Captain Brewer, to which was attached a party of seamen under Lieutenants Hall and Smith, was pro ceeding up the a river''—in this case probably Khor Doraq^—with ammunition for the artillery. In short, a general concentration had begun, probably against the Ka'aVs main position at or near the modern Fallahiyeh. The Kehiyah at this juncture wrote to the British Agent at Basrah, begging him to come in person to the spot, and Mr, Wrench at once set out j but, before his arrival, two serious disasters had over taken the allied arms. The first befell the Turks, nine of whose galleys out of twelve, among them the flagship, were burnt by the enemy : this accident was due to the negligence of the Turks ' in not sending out the necessary scouts/'' and it entailed the loss of all their powder and of most of their other ammunition. After this, on several successive nights, the Ka'ab attempted to take the remaining Turkish galleys ; but on each occasion they were beaten off, with heavy loss, by the British schooners. On the night of the 17th September they attacked the schooners themselves with a force estimated at over a thousand men ; but again they were repulsed, and the Turks, pursuing them with horse and foot in their retreat, killed and captured a large number, and drove the rest into their ' fort.' Meanwhile one of the Trankis belonging to the British fleet was surprised and burnt by the enemy, in consequence of 2 Naiks and 20 sepoys who were on board of her having all gone to sleep; but only one of the detachment fell into the hands of the Ka'ab, who returned him to Destruction of Turkish galleys, Sep tember 1766.1638 Backward ness of the Turks.

The doctor with the British forces being ill, Captain Brewer applied for one to be sent from Basrah ; and the Council there were able, after some delay, to obtain the services of the physician to the French Residency, on pay of three francs a day in addition to his food and an allowance for a servant or interpreter. On the 23rd of September, the very day of the Agents arrival in the ' Tartar ' at Doraqistan, by which the entrance of Khor Musa is pro bably meant, a most unlucky attack was made on the Ka'ab redoubts by a British force without the co-operation, it would appear, of the Turks: it resulted in the loss of Captain Brewer, two Lieutenants, a sergeant and 18 others, killed on the spot, and of 32 dangerously wounded, besides which the field guns landed were captured by the enemy, also 13 chests of ammunition. After this disaster, under the instructions of Mr. Wrench, who was dissuaded from proceeding up the Khor on the ground that both banks were now lined by the enemy and that his presence would serve no useful purpose, the British force was re- embarked, with the exception of six gunners who were left on shore with the Turks to help them m throwing shells xr ^ in the proceedingSj messengers from Karim Khan, the Vakil of Persia, arrived upon the scene with letters for the Kehiyah and the ritish Agent at Basrah, in which he required them to desist from attacking the Ka'ab who were his subjects, and to withdraw from Persian terntoty, but in which he promised at the same time to compel • That i S( A'yan or native notables of the Basrah district, see page 1215 ante.ies9 the Ka'ab Shaikh to make reparation for the injuries inflicted by him m the British and on the Turks. The Kehiyah opened, and for some time withheld; the letter from the Agent, though it had been handed to him by a British officer for transmission ; but he communicated the substance of it to Mr. Wrench, who had meanwhile returned to Basrah, informing him that he intended to comply with the Persian demand, as, if he did not, war between Persia and Turkey might be the result. The Turkish force then retired from the neighbourhood of the Ka'ab capital upon Qubban. After receiving the Kehiyah's communication on the 7th of October, f f e -^ tat g^ pp the Agent and Council deputed Mr^ Skipp, one of their number, to to the visit the Kehiyah and protest against his decision, explaining that the British looked to the Turks for redress and that they had nothing to do October with the Persians. Mr. Skipp, in the Tartar, ' left Basrah on the 10th of October for Khor Musa; but, discovering by the way that the Kehiyah was now at Qubban, he dismissed his vessel and proceeded thither via the Karun. The Kehiyah assured Mr. Skipp that his retirement was provisional, pending the receipt of replies from the Pasha of Baghdad and Earim Khan, to both of whom he had written, and that his Council of notables had been unanimous in considering it necessary; he particularly requested that the British vessels might be left where they were then stationed, their expenses still continuing to be defrayed by the Turks ; he undertook that certain promises which he had made to the Agent at Basrah, in consideration of the help given to the Turks, should be fulfil led ; and he excused himself for his detention of Karim Khan^s letter to Mr. Wrench^ which he now handed to Mr. Skipp, by alleging that he had feared it might miscarry. The Kehiyah also announced that, in the course of a few days, he would remove his camp to the mouth of the Karun, ' where he entreated the Agent wou^d favour him with an inter view, when he would settle every point with him so as to give full satisfaction.'' Mr. Skipp returned to Basrah on the 16th of October and made his report in Council on the following day. On the 19th, Mr. Skipp having fallen ill, it was decided to send Mr. Hollamby to the Kehiyah to impress on him very clearly the respon sibility of the Turks for redress of injuries suffered by the British from the Ka'ab, to insist on the punctual discharge of the instalments of the subsidy for the squadron, and to decline the interview offered to the Agent on the ground that the latter was indisposed; but the result of this further step, if indeed it was actually taken, is not ascertainable.

The negotiations at the Persian capital, which were entrusted to Mr. Skipp, lasted from April to September 1767. They^ended in an agreement by the Vakil to pay five lakhs of rupees to the East India Company, but [only on condition of their lending him effectual aid against the pirate Mir Mahanna of Kharag, as compensation for the damage done by the Ka'ab and the costs of the expedition; but, in consequence of the failure of the British attack on Kharag in May 1768 and the ill-judged recall of Mr. Skipp from a second mission to Shiraz in the following September, for which the Agent at Basrah (Mr. Moore) was responsible, the understanding apparently lapsed. In the end no satisfaction at all was obtained, from any quarter, for the outrages which had been committed by the Ka'ab upon British shipping. Naval block- Notwithstanding the political negotiations described in the last ade oi the i i i i 11 i i Ka'ab, 1766- paragraph, the naval blockade of the Ka'ab waterways, established at the beginning of the war, appears to have been steadily maintained for about two years. In October 1767, when the ill-fated 'Defiance' and other vessels were sent on an expedition against Hormuz, the grab ' Bombay,' a schooner and a Gallivat were apparently retained in the Shatt-al-'Arab 69,1641 m for this service; and at the beginning of February 1768 the mouth of the Karun was still watched by two schooners^ a Gallivat, and some small Turkish vessels. By October 1768 the blockade had probably been relaxed^ for it was reported by the Agent and Council at Basrah that the Ka ; ab were building forts on each side of the river/^ presumably of the Shatt-al-^Arab ; that the Turks were not in a position to prevent it; and that they themselves were resolved not to interfere, but intended in the future to keep half of the British squadron at Basrah ; as a measure of precaution. The Squadron,, it should be mentioned^ had now fallen into such a ' melancholy condition as well with respect to stores as men/^ that the Agent and Council feared that they might presently be obliged to lay up the smaller cruisers in order to man and store the larger ones; and about the same time the Ka^ab ventured to send the a Fort William^s ^ cargo over to Basrah^ where it was sold, obliging the Agent and Council to take action ff as well with respect to the Moor and Armenian merchants, as Mr. Robert Garden in behalf of his Bengal constituents.' The famous Ka'ab Shaikh Salman*' appears to have died about the critical year 1766, probably after the conclusion of the British operations against the tribe, for no mention is made before then of his decease. He was succeeded by his son or nephew Ghanim, who was murdered in 1769. Chiefship of the Ka'ab, 1766-69. Relations of the Ka^ab with the British and the Turks from 1769 to 1779. In the autumn of 1769, as related in the history of Turkish ^Iraq, the Ka'ab actually came to the assistance of the Turkish government of Basrah against the Muntafik with 14 Gallivats, of which 9 proceeded up the river on service with the Captain Pasha, while 5 remained anchored off Manawi. On this occasion the following not unnatural entry was made in the Diary of the British Factory at Basrah: ' It is a galling ' circumstance to have the ChauVs Gallivats under the very muzzles of our # Lieutenant A. T. Wilson states, on native authority, that Shaikh Salman died in 1768; that his immediate successor was his son Ghanim, wlio died a year later; tKat Ghanim was followed in the Shaikhahip by Dawnd-bin-Salman, who was killed after six months ; and that Dawud was succeeded by Barhat-bin-'Othman in 1769.

' Cmizers and not dare to touch them—to think of it would be madness, «considering the Chanb's present connection with the Turks and our 'present situation.' It was said at the time that both the Pasha and the Mutasallim had sent the Quran with their signets to the Ka'ab Shaikh as pledges for the security of the Gallivats sent to their assistance, and that the Shaikh —now no longer Salman—was heartily disgusted with the Persian connection to which his tribe were committed, and which had cost them more in taxes in three years than their preTious depen- dence on the Turks in twelve. In August 1771 the Ka^ab fleet consisted of 14 or 15 Gallivats, and a new Shaikh of the tribe, probably Barkat, who is said to have ruled from 1770 to 1782, was reported to have put out the eyes of Basbus, the sole surviving son of his uncle and predecessor Salman. At this time the Government of Bombay had suggested to the Agent and Council at Basrah that they should approach the Ka^ab Chief on the subject of com pensation for the losses of 1765 j but the local omciais were opposed to such a step, partly because the regnant Shaikh was c&lt; by all accounts as avaritious as the former ones ' and would never disgorge anything except under compulsion, and partly because virtual peace prevailed) which might be disturbed by the revival of old demands, especially if these were not backed by force; and no action apparently was taken* The Turks^ notwithstanding that they were on friendly terms with the Ka'ab, were still unable to obtain payment of an old claim for over Rs. 20,000 which they entertained. Towards the end of 1773, the Ka'ab and the Turks were again at variance, and the former had blockaded the Shatt-al-'Arab with three Gallivats, stopping the trade of Basrah. A little later, having received orders from Karim Khan to reinforce a fleet which was being collected at Kangun for action against the Imam of Masqat, the Ka'ab Shaikh, it was stated, scuttled some of his vessels and displayed them in that condition to the messengers of the Vakil as a proof of his inability to obey. Early in the next year, likewise, the Shaikh excused himself from complying with a demand that he should send a contingent of 500 men to the assistance of Zaki Khan at Bandar 'Abbas; and not long after, when rumours that Karim Khan had designs on Basrah began to circulate, he assured the Turkish Mutasallim of Basrah that instead of helping the Persians to attack the place, he would at once, upon their troops marching from Shiraz, remove from Doraq with the whole of his fleet. Indeed, the allegiance of the Ka'ab to Persia was at this time so doubtful that the Mutasallim seems to164S have had hopes of active assistance from the tribe; and he even thought it worth while to obtain an assurance from the British Agent tbat the Ka'ab vessels ; if they came to take part in the defence of Basrah against the Persians, should not be molested by the British squadron. So far ; however, w T as the Ka^ab Shaikh from being at heart well affected to the Turks that, on the arrival of a Turkish vessel^ the a Faiz Islam/ ; at the mouth of the Shatt-al-^Arab, he despatched the whole of his fleet, consisting of 14 Gallivats and 8 armed boats, to take her. The Mutasallim of Basrah^ having received 'notice of this movement, applied to the British Agent for help; and the ' Revenge ^ was immediately sent to the spot. Arriving at the place on the 13th April 1774, she found the 'Faiz Islam' anchored outside the bar and the Ka'ab fleet inside it, in which position they had been facing each other for three days; and, from the circumstance that the Ka'ab Chiefs Vakil was withdrawn from Basrah that very morning, it seems probable that, but for the opportune appearance of the ^ Revenge,^ the ship would shortly have been attacked by the Gallivats. The Ka'ab vanished at the sight o£ the British cruiser • and the' Revenge &lt;f and the a Faiz Islam, ' in company, reached Basrah safely on the 15th of April. The Ka^ab Shaikh then assumed a threatening attitude, recalled his subjects from Basrah, whence they withdrew on the evening of the 17th of April, and collected his fleet at the mouth of the Karun; and it was suspected that, possibly at the instigation of Karim Khan, he meditated a descent upon Basrah town, or a night attack upon the British squadron stationed there ; but the apparent crisis passed harmlessly over. In January 1775, when fears of a Persian attack on Basrah had again begun to be entertained, much alarm was caused there by the conduct of the Ka'ab, who, in revenge for the execution by the Mutasallim of a robber belonging' to their tribe, came up the river in small boats on several nights in succession, entered the town in parties, and plundered private houses, disappearing towards the morning with their booty. The Muta sallim, to put a stop to these disorders, strengthened the town guard by hiring Arabs from Zubair and compelling the citizens to take a share in the duties of watch and ward; but the great extent of the town favoured the intruders, who continued to pillage as before, several times beat off armed parties sent to oppose them, and on one occasion attempted to set fire to the bazaar.

Of Shushtar, ' a city of considerable importance in regard to the commercial intercourse which subsists between it and Basrah, and on account of its manufacture of chintz/'' it was reported in 1790 that the government is in the hands of a Khan who, secure in his situation, has for some years past but slightly acknowledged the superiority of the ' Government at Sherauze, bufc his independence is restrained at home by 'the authority possessed by the elders of the city, who are always 'watchful to prevent his abuse of power.^ Shushtar in 1790. External relations of 'Arabistan, 1779-95. During the latter part of the eighteenth century, a political crisis at Basrah was sure to attract the instant close attention of the Ka'ab Shaikh; and the evacuation of the town by the Persians in the spring of 1779 formed no exception to the general rule. The irreproachable conduct of the Ka^ab on this occasion, towards the temporary Arab government of the town and towards the British Residency, is described in another place, in the history of Turkish 'Iraq. Sadiq Khan, the commander of the retiring Persian garrison, passed through Doraq on his homeward march. The Tangistani Chief, Baqir Khan, in bis usurpation of the govern ment of Bushehrin July 1779, a depended much upon succour from the Chaub, whom he solicited as soon as he got possession of Bushire ; rV but, as related in the history of the Persian Coast, the Ka^ab Shaikh, who was then engaged in an unsuccessful war with some powerful neighbour, failed to afford him any real assistance. In July 1780 the Ka'ab tribe were at war with the 'Utub, both of Zuharah in Qatar and of Kuwait; but the causes, character and results of the conflict are all equally unascertainable. With the Turks and Arabs of the Basrah neighbourhood, the relations of the Ka'ab continued to be uncertain and fluctuating. Under their Shaikh Barkat the Ka'ab, at some time prior to 1782, ^seized from the Turkish proprietors the extensive and fertile district of Boojidee between Tamar and Haffar, and bestowed it upon the Bawee Arabs, into which tribe he had married/' Towards the end of 1784 there was war between The Ka'ab at the evacua tion of Bas rah, 1779.

In 1787, on the other hand, when Basrah was temporarily seized by Thuwaini,, the Ka'ab appear to have co-operated with the Turkish authorities in suppressing his rebellion. Of Shaikh Ghadhban, who ruled from 1782 to 179^, it is* recorded that he ' took possession of the entire left bank of the Shat-el-Arab as far up as ' Gardelan, and even colonised with the Chaab the right bank of the river 'from the sea to within ten miles of Bussorah. He might have taken | possession of the town of Bussorah itself ; but he dreaded the too great ((extension of his territory, and eventually he deemed it his safer policy ' to withdraw altogether from the right bank of the Shat-el-Arab and ' to concentrate his forces between the Shat and the Jerrahi.' In the autumn of 1791, as is more fully explained in the history of Turkish 'Iraq, a naval encounter took place between the Ka'ab fleet and some 'Omani ships with cargoes of coffee, which were bound for Basrah. The 5 ' Ka'ab, whose maritime efficiency must now have been on the decline, were 1 worsted by the stranger vessels and had the greater number of their Gallivats destroyed,—a loss which they prepared to revenge by intercepting the 'Omanis on their return from Basrah, and for which they also proposed to hold the Turks responsible. At the end of the year there was an inconclusive engagement between a Turkish fleet, convoying the visitors down the Shatt-al-'Arab and some batteries which the Ka'ab had erected on the Turkish bank of the river; but the Turks, though greatly irritated by the action of the Ka'ab, do not appear to have taken any further measures against them. During the continuance of this dispute ' the Chaub Shaik gave very acceptable proofs of his friendship ' towards the English nation in permitting the Gallivat hired by the ' Resident for the conveyance of Major MacDonald from Bussora to ' Muscat to pass his batteries in the most honourable manner, as on other ' occasions.'

Pishkash or tribute to the amount of 4 ; 000 Tumans per annum, being the sum paid by the Afshar inhabitants of the district before their expulsion by the Ka^ab, was now assessed upon the latter in their place by the Persian Government; but on the average not more than one- fourth of the demand could be collected. Presents of horses and money were frequently sent, however, by the Ka^ab Shaikh to the Governor- General of Fars at Shiraz. FAT-H 'ALI SHAH, *• 1797-1834, Under Fat-h ^Ali Shah ^Arabistan began to be treated as a province, in fact as well as in theory, of the Persian Empire; and one result of the change was that it emerged, in part at least, from the obscurity in which it had remained shrouded since the Anglo-Turkish expedition against the Ka^ab tribe in 1766.

Wilson's Precis of the delations of the British Government with the Tribes wd Shaikhs of 'Arabistans 1912.1648 Later ad ministration, 1822-34. This prince signalised his governorship by repairing the principal public works at Shushtar, viz., the two dams which span the Ab-i-Gargar at its head and the Pul-i-Dizful; but the bridge last-mentioned, though the work on it (which was completed in 1810) had occupied four years, had cost a large sum of money, and had been executed under British super vision, was again partially destroyed by a flood in 1832. In 1818 Muhammad 'Ali Mirza led, or sent, a force against Fallahiyeh, and a sum of 13,000 Tumans was wrung from the Ka^ab Shaikh on account of arrears of the tribute which was claimed from him by the Persian Government. The Persian arrangements for the administration of ^Arabistan after 1822 are not ascertainable; but it seems likely that the province remained in a semi-subdued condition, revenue being collected at irregular intervals by military expeditions, on the withdrawal of which the local chiefs- such as the Ka'ab Shaikh and the Wali of Hawizeh—resumed or were nominally replaced in charge of their hereditary jurisdictions. During some portion at least of Fat-h ''Ali Shah^s reign one of the principal Persian officials at Shiraz received part of his salary in the form of an annual assignment of 1,000 Tumans on the tribute due from the Ka^ab tribe, Affairs of the Ka'ab tribe. Rise of the Muhaisiu tribe, and foundation and growth of Muham- mareh. Internal history of 'Arabistan^ 1797-1834. At the beginning of Fat-h 5 Ali Shah's reign the Shaikhship of the Ka'ab was still held by 'Alwan. 'Alwan was ousted in 1801, by Muhammad-bin-Barkat, who retained his position until 1812. The successor of Muhammad was Ghaith, a grandson of the famous Shaikh Salman \ his rule began in 1812 and ended in 1828, when he was murdered. Ghaith was followed by his brother Mubadir or Mubashir, who reigned for three years; and the latter by a Shaikh named 'Abdullah-bin-Muhammad. In or about 1832 Thamir-bin-Ghadhban became chief of the tribe. The foundation of the town of Muhammareh, which is assigned to the year 1812, was an important event. It contributed materially to the progress of the Muhaisin tribe, who were at first an insignificant body, but whose chief was destined in the end to supplant the Shaikh of the Ka'ab as the principal political power in Southern 'Arabistan. Mu hammareh was established under the orders of Shaikh Ghaith, Ka'ab, as a military outpost against the Turks or the Arab tribes under Turkish influence, and it stood originally on both sides of the Karun River. The1649 ac tual founders were Mirdao,—the head of the Muhaisin, but a vassal or lr ^ ar a ' servant of the Ka^ab Shaikh^—and his son Haji 'Yusuf. These two chiefs were succeeded about 1819 by Haji Jabir ; son of Mirdao and years, l brother of Haji Yusuf. Haji Jabir^ who resided in the part of the settle- tisli m ment on the right or northern bank of the K arun^ early evinced an In [ inclination to assert his independence of the Ka^ab chiefs and engaged in peh ai i various intrigues. The Ka'ab Shaikh, in order to counteract Haji Jabir's schemes, then tightened his hold upon the part of Muhammareh ^ p situated on the left or southern bank of the river, which consequently came to be known as Kut-ash-Shaikh or 'the (Ka'ab) Shaikh^s Castle.' During the rule of Shaikh Ghaith the Ka'ab garrison of istaii af Kut -ash-Shaikh was commanded by his brother Mubadir or Mubashir; cereii and the latter, when he succeeded to the headship of the Ka^ab, placed ar infe another brother, Thamir, in charge of the Kut. By 1830, Muhammareh a l ^ —by which name only the right-bank settlement, controlled by the e( j or ^ Muhaisin, was now meant,—had increased from a petty fort to a com- 3 ^ mercial emporium of considerable importance and'had began to attract ,, general attention. 3 pnm:: b 3rm of P ^ ue Prevailed in Turkish ^Iraq in 1831-8^ also visited Ravages of 'Arabistan, where it made great havoc, probably in ] 832.

Shushtar, hitherto the most important town of ''Arabistam certainly de clined about this time with extraordinary suddenness to a secondary place, being superseded by Dizful; and one cause of the change appears to have been the plague, which affected Shushtar more severely than it did ofl Dizfal.

Boundary between * Arabistan and Turkish 'Iraq. Difficulties between the ITa'ab Shaikh and the Turkish atihorities at Basrah, 1827. The treaty which concluded the Turco-Persian frontier war of 1821-22 merely re-affirmed, in the matter of boundaries^ an ancient convention of 1639 between Sultan Mnrad IV of Turkey and the Safavi Shah of Persia^ whereby ' Khuzistan' was assigned to Persia and ' 'Iraq-i- ^Arab ^ to Turkey. The meaning of such an agreement was; of course, open to dispute. In 1827 Shaikh Grhaith; the Ka^ab chief, finding himself involved in difficulties with the Turkish authorities at Basrah, sought the aid of the Sultan of ^Oman ; but whether for offensive or for defensive purposes is not apparent. His request was referred, by the 'Omani ruler to the British Resident in the Persian Gulf^ and ; having been disapproved by that authority, no aid was sent him from M asqat. Shaikh Ghaith accordingly came to terms with the Pasha of Baghdad; to whom he sent envoys. Before peace was made he seems to have succeeded in repelling more than one attack made on Fallahfyeh by the Turks and their allies; the Muntefik and the people of Kuwait.

Towards the end of the year 1820; as explained in the history of Turkish Iraq, Captain Taylor, the British Political Assistant at Basrah, removed temporarily with his establishment to Muhammareh. This he did under orders from his superior officer, the Resident at Baghdad, in consequence of a difficulty which had arisen with the Pasha of Baghdad in regard to British rights and privileges. The fact tends to show that Muhammareh was at the time regarded as lying outside the Turkish empire, or at least beyond the range of Turkish administration and effective influence. Visit of Mr. H.

In the internal history of 'Ar-.bistan ^ the most remarkable features of the period were an obstinate contest for ^ superiority between the Shaikh of the Ka'ab at Fallahiyeh and his erst- ' as &gt; 0 ^t w ^Q e vassal, the Shaikh of the Muhaisin at Muhammareh, and the exten sion by the Persian Central Government of their own authority, in a c • more or less effective form, to the very banks of the Shatt-al-'Arab. t umki the aW The conflict over the possession of Muhammareh, not only between urposesii Persia and Turkey but also between the Shaikh of the Ka'ab and the 3 the I Shaikh of the Muhaisin, renders the political history of the province at this )ved tyt time so confused that it will be better to depart here to some extent from our h accori usu al division of the subject, and to treat of events chronologically in so sent en f ar as Persian and Turkish interests are concerned. British and other foreign jpellbg 1 ^terests, however, will be separated as elsewhere from other matters and ^ a ^ eS| disposed of in one place for the whole period.

The Persian Governor 'of 'Arabistan ordinarily had his residence at Dizful. His authority extended only to that town and to Shushtar. to some of the Arab tribes dependent on those two centres, and to the districts immediately adjacent. The Governor's escort rarely exceeded 50 or 60 horsemen and his salary, which he collected himself, was 5,000 Tumans or £2,500 a year. The Government revenue assessed on the tract under his jurisdiction was 40,000 Tumans annually, and account of it was kept by a Mustaufi or Accountant-General, an officer of the Central Government. Internally the towns of Dizful and Shushtar were administered, in a disorderly way, by their own turbulent chiefs ; but Saiyid notables, Mujtahids, and Mulla's also exercised a consideiable influence in public affairs there. The Persian Governor had little real power and was generally murdered or expelled, for some act of injustice or oppression, before one year of his government had elapsed. The greatest power in the whole province, if we exclude the Bakhti- yari Khans whose influence, though external, permeated the northern districts of 'Arabistan, was undoubtedly, at the beginning of the period, ; the Shaikh of the Ka'ab tribe, whose seat was Pallahryeh. His authority extended in a general manner over the districts of Pallahiyeh, Muhammareh, Ahwaz, Jarrahi and Hindiyan ; his control over his own tribe was almost absolute, and over the Muhaisin as yet considerable; and the Bawiyeh and Bani Tamim tribes, in the latter of which the * Sharifat seem to have been at that time included, rendered him a some what doubtful allegiance. His available military force, drawn from the Ka'ab, Muhaisin and Haiyadir, totalled about 7,000 men, of whom 3,000 were footmen well armed with muskets and matchlocks, 1,000 were horsemen, and the rest were indifferently equipped with swords and spears. Additional levies might possibly have been raised by him, but they would have been unprovided with useful weapons. The Shaikh's artilleiy consisted of three small but serviceable t English guns, respectably mounted, and served by 40 Persians who had been trained by a deserter from tne Persian artillery. He possessd a lso several old unmounted guns * The Sharifat are represented as so numerons at this period that it almost seems necessary to suppose them identical with the present Bani Tamim. t They were a ^-pounder, an S-pounder and q T 9 ™ ;r j i i flinsp wf in apfirm ^ t&gt; , l^-poundei*, and may have been those lost in action by the British near Fallahiyeh in 1766.

C | Among the Shaikh/s unreliable dependents, the Eawiyeh had about 1,000 horsemen, besides some footmen destitute of good weapons, while the Sharifat (or Beni Tamim) mustered 2,000 horse and 700 foot. 1 ^ , The annual tribute paid by the Shaikh to the Persian Governor- j. reg General of Pars with whom and not with the Persian Governor of ; Arabistan his fiscal relations were until 1840, was only 3,400 Tumans or £1,700 a year, and no representative of the Persian Government resided in his dominions,—two sure indications of his virtual independence. annir ^ 0 ^ er Shaikhship in 1834 was Thamir-bin-Ghadh- ^ a l ' ban of the A1 Eu Nasir subdivision of th^ Dris division of the tribe, who, of as before mentioned, had succeeded his relative 'Abdullah-bin-Muhammad about 1832.

His forehead was almost as promi- as that of a negro, and he probably had black blood in his veins, like the descend ants of many Arabs who had renounced their nomad lives, and had married slaves. e m Sheikh Thamer was undoubtedly, for an Arab, a remarkable man. 'A the noffiTie country over which he ruled owed much of the prosperity which it then enjoyed y f ii .to the encouragement which he gave to agriculture and commerce, and to the protec- ' tion which he afforded to strangers and merchants in his territories. Canals and llahiyel watercourses for irrigation, upon which the fertility of the soil mainly depends, were of Pallaliept in good repair, and new works of the kind were frequently undertaken.

But his fulfilment of these obligations was reluctant and imperfect; and he maintained private relations, which were little short of treasonable to his overlord, with the Persian Governor ' of 'Arbistan 3&gt; and the Wali of Hawizeh, perhaps even with the Turkish Governor of Basrah. To watch the proceedings of Shaikh Jabir and to hold him in check, if necessary. Shaikh Thamir sent his nephew Taris-bin-Ghaith to reside on his behalf at Kut-ash* Shaikh opposite to the main town of Muhammareh, as he himself had resided there at an earlier time on the part of his brother Mubadir. Shaikh Thamir, 'fully sensible of the advantage of an uncertain depend ency in deterring Persia from attempting to increase the extent or to systematize the character of her interference in the affairs of the Chaab tribe/ ; cultivated more friendly relations with his Turkish neighbours than any of the earlier Shaikhs of his tribe. He was careful not to admit tHe authority of the Governor of Basrah over himself ii^ any r essential point; but he frequently presented the Mutasallim with horses and sums of money, and received in return an occasional KhiVat or robe of honour. Hawizeh, formerly a flourishing district, was f about this time reduced to insignificance by a singular calamity : this was the collapse of a great dyke at Kut Nahr Hashimonthe Karkheh, some 15 miles above Hawizeh town. The results were as instantaneous as they were fatal. The Kar kheh changed its entire course below Kut Nahr Hashim in a single night; Hawizeh town and the cultivated districts were left high and dry; and other tracts, formerly of some value for grazing or tillage, were converted into profitless swamps. Formerly a large town, Hawizeh sunk rapidly into a village of 400 or 500 inhabitants; and the Wali was ruined by the impoverishment of his subjects.

Hajee J aaber was of neither one tribe nor the other, and admitted few of them into his town ; he formed and supported his own garrison, and, as far as I have been able to ascertain, was well and faithfully served by them. This account of the capture of Mohammerah is strongly perverted. Treachery was never imputed to the garrison, nor did Jaaber fly from his own people but from the Turkish soldiery, Kelying in fact on support from Fellahiah which was withheld by Shaikh lhamir from jealousy of his rival's power he rejected all overtures and deter mined to defend his town to the last. The place was accordingly formally invested, battered, breached and finally taken by assault. Sheikh Jaaber escaping in his boats by the Bamishere river when the Turkish troops were occupied in plundering the town. Mohammerah was stormed on the west face, and when the troops were fairly in possession of the breach there was a general rush to the boats on the Hafar, which runs along the southern wall of the town, and numbers of persons who were without the means of flight throwing themselves into the canal were drowned j the total population of the place when it was captured, including the Arab garrison of fighting men, may have been 3,000 souls, and as always happens when a place is carried by assault, the loss of life was no doubt considerable. 1 have never been able, however, to collect any satisfactory information on this point, nor can I obtain an approximate estimate of the extent and value of the plundered property. further pro- Be the details of the capture of Muhammareh what they may, it is ceedingSr ^ certain that the Turks obtained temporary possession of the place, pillaged their expul- the bazaars and warehouses, and rendered the place defenceless by throw- Shaikh Tha- ^ ^ own fortifications and carrying off the artillery.

On the Bawiyeh soliciting his pardon, he invited their chief Shaikh to his capital and there treacherously caused him to be shot dead, along with another leading man ; while drinking coffee at an official reception. A new Shaikh, ; Aqil ; was then placed by him over the Bawiyeh. Probably not long after this, Mir Mahannar, the Shaikh of the Shari- fat, rebelled against Shaikh Thamir; he defended himself for some months in his fort at Deh Mulla in the Hindiyan district, but in the end had to surrender and was deported to Fallahiyeh. A Shaikh named Mir Madh- kur, a Saiyid, was installed in his place. Shaikh Jabir of Muhammareh, to whom the destruction of that place was a severer blow than it was to Shaikh Thamir, fled at first to Bushehr and there endeavoured, but without success, to enlist the support of the Persian Governor-General of Fars. Subsequently he returned quietly to his ruined and dismantled town ; and not many years elapsed before it was again in as flourishing a state as ever. In 1839 Manuchehr Khan, better known as the Mo ; tamad-ud-Dauleh, a Georgian of Christian parentage but reared as a Muhammadan slave, was appointed by the Persian Government, probably under Russian influ ence, to be Governor of Isfahan, Luristan, and ; Arabistan. This able but tyrannical official, who, like Agha Muhammad Khan, the ferocious founder of the Qajar dynasty, was a eunuch, soon made his authority cruelly felt throughout the length and breadth of the provinces assigned to him. His policy was clear and consistent; but bad faith was its principal instrument, and he revelled in the invention and infliction of appalling tortures. f C( He was beardless, had a smooth colourless face, With hanging cheeks, and a weak, shrill, feminine voice. He was short, stout and flabby, and his limbs were ungainly and slow of movement.

His first demands were addres sed to Muhammad Taqi Khan, the principal chief of the Chaharlang division of the Bakhtiyari tribe ; who had his seat at Qa^leh Tul, and whom he required to pay immediately an instalment of 10,000 Tumans, or about £5,000, on account of revenue arrears. Alarming suspicions were insinuated by the Mo ; tamad of the chieFs being disloyal to the Shah, because he had refused to honour Persian Government drafts drawn on him, and of his maintaining a treasonable correspondence with refugee Persian princes at Baghdad. Muhammad Taqi Khan was unable, had he even been willing, to furnish at such short notice the large sum required of him j but he hesitated to defy the Governor, and eventually allowed him to pass unmolested through the Bakhtiyari mountains with a force consist ing of one regiment of regular Persian infantry—that of Khoi, 1,000 mounted Ghulams, some well armed Cavalry, and three small field pieces with 150 artillerymen. A meeting then took place, in February 1841, on the plain of Mai-Amir, where the Mohamad and Muhammad Taqi Khan remained encamped together for about six weeks, during which the former continued to press his conditions for a settlement and the latter to resist them as best he could. The Mohamad had been preceded at Mai-Amir by Baron de Bode, the First Secretary of the Russian Legation at Tehran, who remained with him there for a few days. Muhammad Taqi Khan had collected a force of about 5,000 men as against the Mo^tamad^s ^,500 ; it included, besides his own Bakhtiyaris^ Arabs from the plains about Shashtar and even from the banks of the Jarrahi. Had he chosen to take the Mohamad at a disadvantage, lie might, perhaps, have destroyed him and his whole force, The Mohamad eventually left for Shushtar, to collect the revenue of the low countries, without having settled the affairs of Muhammad Taqi Khan; but, soon after his arrival at his destination, he summoned that chief to appear before him. Muhammad Taqi Khan refused to obey ; and the Mohamad, after formally proclaiming him a rebel, prepared to march against him. These proceedings so alarmed the Bakhtiyari chief that he weakly placed his eldest son and one of his nephews in the hands of the Mohamad as hostages for his loyalty; this he did in consideration of an oath taken by the Mohamad to abandon his expedition, if it were done^ and return with his troops to Isfahan, Manuchehr Khan, however) who had in the meanwhile obtained a reinforcement of two regiments of Persian infantry and some artillery besides the help of the Faili Lurs and of some Arab Shaikhs^ was only acting with his usual perfidy ; and bo1669 sooner were the children in his power than he announced that they would be put to death if Muhammad Taqi Khan did not at once surrender. The Bakhtiyari chief then came down into the near neighourhood of Shushtar; but, as the Mo'tamad would grant him no reliable guarantee for his life, sight and liberty should he come in, he in the end fled for safety in the direction of Fallahiyeh, pursued by the Mo'tamad and his troops. A large number of his own Bakhtiyaris accompanied Muhammad Taqi Khan in the first stages of his flight, but he persuaded them to return to their native hills. After parting from them he and his party were attacked and plundered by the Sharif at. Mr. Layard, the English traveller, who was a spectator of most of the transactions described above, states that the officers of the regular Persian troops and the persons employed in the service of the Mo'tamad were ' a dissolute and debauched set of fellows, and feasted, drank arak, and spent most of their time, half-drunk, in listening to music and watch ing dancing boys and girls.'' The energetic Governor sent Ghulams far and wide to various chiefs of the country, among them to Mirza Koma, Euler of Behbehan, between whom and Muhammad Taqi Khan there were boundary disputes, and to Shaikh Thamir, the head of the Ka'ab Arabs. The emissary to Behbehan was stripped of everything, on his way back, by robbers on the plains of Ramuz ; but the messenger to Fallahiyeh, whose mission probably related to Persian demands on the Ka'ab for payment of revenue, returned safely to his master. The whole countryside was now in a turmoil and appeared deserted except by robbers, who swarmed on every side. Mr. Layard, between whom and the chivalrous Bakhtiyari chief a romantic attachment existed, followed Muhammad Taqi Khan towards Fallahiyeh. He struck the Jarrahi river at Gharaibeh, about twelve miles above Fallahiyeh, where he learned the next morning that his Bakhtiyari friend had crossed the river three miles further up during the night. Before daybreak orders arrived from Shaikh Thamir for his subjects to abandon the upper Ka'ab villages upon the jarrahi; and the whole population immediately engaged with frantic energy in dismantling their reed huts, and in forming the materials into rafts on which to float down to safer quarters in the vicinity of Fallahiyeh along with their provisions^ cooking utensils, beddings and even poultry. Flocks and herds were hastily driven away; and, to hamper the movements of the enemy, dykes were cut and the whole country was laid under water. ' All were screaming at the top of their voices^ and sometimes the men, cea sing from their Expedition of the Mo'tamad- ud-'Dauleh against Shaikh Thamir of the Ka^ah and his guest Muhammad Taqi Khan at Fallahiyeh, 1841.

The Bawiyeh, except the Bani Khalid section, had thrown in their lot with the Mo'tamad ; and great fear prevailed, especially in the villages on the right bank of the river, lest the horsemen of that tribe should suddenly appear. By evening the upper villages were practically deserted. Mr. Layard, after the moon rose, made himself a raft in the same manner as the Arabs and drifted down the river to I 1 allahiyeh, where he arrived early the next afternoon. The scene by the way was one of extraordinary bustle and excitement. The ripe crops had been set on fire by the owners, from which it would appear that the season was late spring or early summer, and were sending up clouds of smoke on all sides into a clear sky. Shaikh Thamir received Mr. Layard well, but swore solemnly that Muhammad Taqi Khan was not in the Ka'ab country. In the evening Mirza Koma, the ruler of Behbehan, on whom the operations of the Mo'tamad in ^Arabistan had encouraged the Governor- General of Ears to put pressure, rode into Fallahiyeh as a fugitive at the head of a way-worn body of about 50 horsemen. The next morning Mr. Layard was successful in finding for himself the tent of Muhammad Taqi Khan, which was pitched on a dry piece of ground surrounded by marshes near the bank of the Buziyeh canal, and he spent the rest of the day and the following night in the Bakhtiyari's quarters. On his return to Tallahiyeh he took with him a letter from Muhammad Taqi Khan in which Shaikh Thamir was begged to treat him with confidence; and the Shaikh then declared that the Bakhtiyari chiefs presence in his dominions had hitherto been concealed, even from the Ka^ab, in the hope of averting a Persian invasion. Shaikh Thamir afterwards took Mr. Layard to view the preparations which were being made for the defence of Fallahiyeh by throwing up earthworks and mounting artillery; and he listened attentively the Eng lishman's advice, which was to trust more in the impenetrability of the sloughs and marshes surrounding the town than in the strength of the artillery, but in any case to test the safeness of the older guns before bringing them into use. Layard says ;— * Arabs from the neighbouring tribes came in large numbers to Fellahijah, accompanied by the wild music of drums and oboes, displaying their flags and singing their war-songs. When they reached the town they danced in a circle round their Sheikhs and standard-bearer, yelling their war-cries, and chanting, in chorus, some *Layard's Early Vol. I, pages 65-86.f'Q 1661 impromptu verses in defiance o£ the enemy, or in praise of Sheikh Thamer—such as «Let no one give his daughter to the Bowi' (an Arab tribe hostile to the Cha'b), &lt; Thamer is a burning fire,' ' Thamer is the lion of war '—accompanying the words with fierce gestures, brandishing their swords and spears, and discharging their match-locks. This dancing, and yelling, and firing never ceased night or day. The faces and limbs of these Arabs were almost black from constant exposure to the sun. They^were nearly nakei, and theii hair was plaited in long tresses shining with grease. In addition to these armed auxiliaries the town, and the palm groves for a consi derable distance around it, were crowded with men, women, and children, who, with their sheep^ camels and buffaloes, had taken refuge from the advancing Persian. It was a mystery to me how Shaikh Thamer could provide provisions for such a multitude. One morning Shaff Khan^ a Bakhtiyari chief sent by the Mc'tainad- ud-Dauleh^ entered Fallahiyeh along with some Persian officers ; he was charged with a communication for Muhammad Taqi Khan. Shaikh Thamir, however, persisted that he knew nothing of the Bakhtiyari chiefs movements or whereabouts. Later a second envoy from the Mohamad appeared in the person of Ja^far 'Ali Khan, an arrogant Persian in Manuchehr Khan^s confidence, and sought to intimidate Shaikh Thamir into surrendering his Bakhtiyari guest. He was effectually answered by Mir Mahanna, a Shaikh and doughty warrior of the Ka-'ab, who took upon himself the responsibility of having brought Muhammad Taqi Khan to Fallahiyeh without Shaikh Thamir ; s knowledge, and whose fiery speech raised such a tumult in the assembly that the Mohamad's emissary, as cowardly as he was boastful, beat a hurried retreat. After this the Mohamad, advised and supported by the * Wali of Hawizeh, to whom as well as to the Shaikh of the Bawiyeh he had pro mised the headship of the^ Ka^ab ini'case Shaikh Thamir should be deprived of it, advanced his camp to Gharaibeh. He found the place deserted and destroyed, and all his efforts to establish himself nearer to Fallahiyeh were foiled by the inundations and the stout resistance of the Ka^ab musketeers. Little help was needed from Shaikh Thamir's artillery, to the fire of which the Persians were careful not to expose them selves. The Sharif at professed neutrality, but joined the Persian camp, while the Zarqan tribe associated themselves with the Ka'ab in supporting Shaikh Thamir. Finding that his troops began to suffer from malaria and the daily increasing heat, the Mo'tamad-ud-Dauleh again resorted to negotiations. He reminded Muhammad Taqi Khan of the Bakhtiyari hostages in his hands, to whose number Agha Karim, a brother of Muhammad Taqi, had * The Wali of Hawizeh was at enmity with Muhammad Taqi Khan, who it would seem had temporarily taken possession of his capital, the town of Hawizeh, in 1839.

On the other hand he promised the Bakhtiyurx a free pardon, the favour of the Shah, and even the governorship of iVrabistan, if only he would make his submission. The intermediary in the renewed discussions was Shafi Khan, Bakhtiyari, who himself be lieved in the sincerity of the Mo'tamad on this occasion. Finally it was proposed by ^VTo'tamad that an oath should be taken by a Mujtahid and by* Sulaiman Khan, the Commander of the Persian troops^ as a guaranteo for the faithful observance of the terms offered, and that Muhammad Taqi Khan should then visit the Persian camp in safety. The Bakhtiyari Chief, who knew that his presence at Fallahiyeh was a cause of much danger and loss to the Ka^ab Shaikh and his subjects, at length decided to trust the Mohamad; the required oath was taken by the Mujtahid and Sulaiman Khan, who further undertook that in three days the Persian forces should leave the Ka-'ab country; and Muhammad Taqi Khan, disregarding the entreaties of his family and even^ it would appear, the wishes of Shaikh Thamir, proceeded to the Persian camp accompanied by the Mujtahid, Sulaiman Khan, Mr. Layard, and others. The Mohamad, with his usual cynicism, merely taxed the Bakhtiyari on arrival with being a rebel against the Shah, and had him thrown intof chains. Even Sulaiman Khan seemed ashamed of this denouement and protested to Mr. Layard that it was totally unforeseen by himself. The act of treachery caused great indignation in Fallahiyeh, which the Mo'tamad was heightened by the arrival, almost as soon as the Muhammad Taqi Khan ; s fate became known, of a messenger from the Mo^tamad demand ing from Shaikh Thamir the instant payment of 12,000 Tumans, or about £6,000, as the price of the retirement of the Persian army from his country. The Shaikh was at first disposed to refuse; but he yielded to the persuasion of a Saiyid who visited him on the part of the Mohamad, —a kind of influence to which he was peculiarly amenable^—and com pounded the claim for 5,000 Tamans on an assurance that the Persians would retire on the next day, and that a brother of Muhammad Taqi Khan would be set over the Bakhtiyaris. No sooner had the money been paid, however, than the Mo'tamad, who had just received another reinforcement in the shape of three regular regiments of infantry, some guns, and a large body of Lur and Arab * Sulaiman Khan was a Georgian or Armenian Christian and was a near relative of the Mo'tamad, probably his nephew.

The women of his family were reduced to abject distress. Demands of the Mo' on Sha; Thamir1663 lie I auxiliaries; suddenly annexed a fresh condition to the departure of him- ^ self and bis army ; it was that every member of Muhammad Taqi Khan^s rsli p family then in Ka'ab territory, together with all the Bakhtiyari Chiefs' dependents there, should be given up to him. To enforce it he moved his camp nearer to Fallahiyeh, pitching it on the bank of the Umm-as- Sakhar Canal, The new demand, compliance with which was forbidden by Arab custom, Night attack and which appeared the more outrageous on account of what had e-one 0 - n tlie Pel ' ^ sian camp. before, provoked a night attack upon the Persian camp, made with the object of rescuing Muhammad Taqi Khan. The Bakhtiyaris, to whom Mr. Layard attached himself on this occasion, took the lead in the affair, and they were seconded by the Ka'ab tribesmen; but Shaikh Thamir did not personally participate, fearing to place himself too unmistakably in rebellion against the Persian Government. The Mo^tamad^s camp was successfully surprised ; great confusion arose in it; much random firing of small arms took place in the dark; Bakhtiyari and Arab riders careered through the lines, cutting down all that they met; the horses of the Persian cavalry stampeded ; and a Persian battery opened with grape shot on a seething crowd which appeared to be advancing against the Mujtahid^s pavilion, but which really consisted of a Persian regiment in retreat. Muhammad Taqi Khan, unfortunately, could not be found, for at the first alarm he had been removed from his usual place of con finement to the presence of the Mohamad ; and the Ka^ab, who had lost a number of men including one of their principal Shaikhs, began to waver and fall back. The attack thus failed in its principal purpose j but Agha Karim, Muhammad Taqi Khan's brother, recovered his liberty; Shafi' Khan, the Bakhtiyari Chief whom the Mo'tamad had employed as a go-between, escaped to his friends ; and the Persians suffered heavy losses and were much discouraged. The Mo'tamad-ud-Dauleh, apparently nothing daunted, replied to this sortie by again attempting to approach nearer to Fallahiyeh ; but his efforts to bridge a canal that blocked the way w^ere opposed by Shaikh Thamir's Arabs with an obstinacy that threatened to make progress beyond it, if bridged, impossible to the disheartened Persian troops. The Mo'ta- mad also feared that Shaikh Thamir might, if too closely pressed, throw himself into the arms of the Turks. He therefore closed the campaign and retired to Shushtar for the summer with his army. On his return to Shushtar the Mo'tamad-ud-Dauleh amused himself I^ter by wringing money out of the unfortunate inhabitants of that town, of P roce * din ^1664 of the Mo'ta- mad-ud- Dauleh in Northern Arabistan and Hawizeh, 1841. Later pro ceedings of Shaikh Thamir, 1841. Dizful and of the surrounding districts, and out of such of the Arab tribes as had not withdrawn in alarm to a distance. The following account of his proceedings is given* by Sir A. H. Layard who was in the province at the time : With, this object the leading inhabitants of the towns, the £ Ket-Khudas ' of the villages, and the Arab Shaikhs who had fallen into his hands had been imprisoned in the castle and underwent almost daily tortures. The sticks were constantly in use, and men of the highest character and the greatest repute in Khuzistan were ignominiously subjected to the bastinado. The merciless and brutal eunuch had even devised new tortures for those whom he accused of withholding or concealing their property, and consequently of being in rebellion against the Shah. Some poor wretches, principally petty Arab Shaikhs who had joined the Cha'b in resisting the Persian troops, or had endeavoured to fly to avoid paying the money demanded of them, were, it was said, bound up in wool soaked in naphtha, which was then set on fire. They were thus left io suffer a lingering and horrible death. Throughout the summer and part of the autumn he employed himself in the congenial task of f collecting the revenue and raising money from the province. With this object he had imprisoned, bastinadoed, and otherwise tortured many of the principal inhabitants of Shuster who were supposed to have property, and had reduced them to penury. The houses and the bazars had been sacked by the Persian soldiers, who w^re allowed to do so with impunity, as they were clamouring for their pay, of which they were many months in arrear. Officers, with bodies of irregular horsemen, had been sent to collect the taxes from the villages, which they did by cruelly ill-treating the inhabitants and devast iting the country. The result had been that the population had for the most part taken refuge with the Arabs, or had fled to the mountains, and a region naturally of great richness and fertility had been almost reduced to a wilderness. Sulaiman Khan ; the Persian military commander, even invaded the plains to the west of the Diz river with a Persian force and fell upon the Bani Lam, one of whose sections, it was said, lost 12,000 sheep^ a large number of camels, horses and other animals, besides which many of their women were captured and outraged by the Persian soldiery. The only authority towards whom the Mohamad showed himself complaisant was the Wali of Hawizeh, who had helped in the expedition against Fallahiyeh; him he allowed to compound for his arrears of revenue and ultimately appointed Governor of ^Arabistan. On the departure of the MVtamad-ud-Dauleh from Fallahiyeh, Shaikh Thamir entered into communication with the Pasha of Baghdad and made a visit of inspection to Muhammareh, which, to the Turks, he professed himself ready to hold as a vassal of the Sultan in return for * Layard's Early Adventures, Vol. II, pages 145-146. t Jjayard's Early Adventure St Vol. II, page 270.1665 115 'oil help and protection; Mr. Layard ; being specially invited to do so, accompanied the Shaikh to Muhammareh ; which he found to bea settle ment of mud-built huts, with a bazar for the sale of provisions and a few European commodities.^ The Shaikh's object was to examine the defences of the place, where some batteries and earthworks had been con structed to command the entrance of the Karun and the approach to the town on the landward side; for his real desire was to retain his semi- independence, and with this purpose he was endeavouring to make Muhammareh tenable against both Turks and Persians. Shaikh Thamir did not forget to visit the Bawiyeh with his dis pleasure on account of their having joined the Mohamad in his expedition against Fallahiyeh. He expelled them from Isma-'ili on the Karun, which they then occupied, driving them to Ahwaz and the lower part of the plain of Ramuz. In the autumn of the same year the Mo'tamad-ud-Dauleh, who had not relinquished his determination to get the better of Shaikh Thamir, descended the Karun river to Muhammareh, and in November 1841 occupied that place in force. His movements, before their scope was clear, threw 7 even the Bani Lam into a panic of fear and led them to congregate on the banks of the Tigris in Turkish territory, where they thought that he would not venture to attack them. Advised by the Wali of Hawizeh and the Bawiyeh tribe, the Mo'tamad had planned to attack Fallahiyeh this time from the south west ; but Shaikh Thamir, many of whose tribal allies and dependents he had succeeded in detaching, did not wait for his coming. Considering successful resistance to be impossible in the altered circumstances. Shaikh Thamir hurriedly embarked his guns and all his property and removed with his family to Kuwait. On his departure his nephew Faris-bin- Ghaith succeeded him as Shaikh of the Ka'ab and was recognised as such by the Persian authorities. The Mo^tamad^s approach had been the signal for the flight also of Haji Jabir, the Muhaisin Shaikh who actually held possession of Muhammareh; but the Mo'tamad affected to consider his absence a matter of no moment, and he made no objection, apparently, to the management of local affairs being carried on by Haji Muhammad, a nephew whom Haji Jabir had left in charge of the town. Before his departure, however, the Mohamad appointed an officer to reside at Muhammareh on the part of the Persian Government, as a mark of sovereignty and as a check upon the intrigues of the local Shaikhs and of the Turks.

He left the Karkheh border 1842. ' a prey to the Bani Lam ; the Ka^ab districts in a state of anarchy, and Muhammareh with its trade temporarily ruined. Strangely enough, how ever, almost his last official act was an attempt to restore prosperity to Hawizeh by rebuilding the dyke at Kut Nahr Hashim,—an undertaking in which he was defeated by an unusually high rise of the river. The* effect of the Mo'tamad's proceedings in 'Arabistan upon Perso- Turkish relations is described in another place, t Blood feud In 1842, shortly after the Mo^tamad-ud-Dauleh had quitted Muham- Kt'Xsi^ikh niarell J Haji Jabir, the Muhaisin Shaikh of that place, sent his nephew of Failahiyali Haji Muhammad to Fallahiyah to concert measures with the new Jabir^ 1 Shaikh of the Ka'ab for mutual support in case of a second invasion of Shaikh of the country by the Persian central authorities. Shaikh Paris, however, Muhammareh* caused the young man to be shot as a rebel and a traitor; Hakim, a 1842. brother to whom Shaikh Faris had assigned the .cadet's duty of watching the Muhaisin from Kut-ash-Shaikh, made an unsuccessful attempt to seize Muhammareh; and Haji Jabir, alarmed at the attitude of the Ka'ab called in the Persian authorities. Some Persian troops from Dizful accordingly arrived at Muhammareh in the spring of 1843 ; but a few months later Haji Jabir, who no longer needed their support, succeeded in getting them taken away again by creating commissariat difficulties. A Persian officer with a small 'escort continued, however, to reside at Muhammareh as the representative of his Government; and Shaikh Jabir, who had to consider the danger in which he stood from Turkish as well as Persian encroachments, thought it well to manifest to him an out wardly conciliatory demeanour. The breach created between the chiefs of * It is alleged by Major Rawlinson—see bis Memorandum on the Dispute, etc., 1844,—that, from the time of the occupation of Mubammareb by the Mo'tamad, an an nual payment of 500 paistres or about £40 which has hitherto been regularly made to the Turkish authorities at Basrah by or on behalf of the Ka'ab Shaikh as ground rent for the town, ceased ; but that, ever after the occupation, a payment of 300 tons of dates in kind continued to be made year by year to the Basrah officials on account of the tracts known as Tamar and Halfar. No authority is given by Major Rawlinson for these statements, which perhaps therefore only reflect the assertions of Turkish officials at Basrah. It is worth noting that nowhere else in the works and records consulted in the compilation of this Gazetteer has any reference been found to the payment of land revenue by the Ka ab or Muhaisin to the Turkish Government ; and, from the history of their relations, such payment womld seem improbable. A reference to the article ' Haffar ' in Yolume II of this Gazetteer will show that the tract really so named lies well within the Karun, some distance above Muhammareh. t Vide page 1374, a wife.1667 lat 110 hi ' lk i iver, upon Pai ^ed Mukr ; tis M}\ ith the e .d n s, boffei: ; Hakim, r of watcli I attempt! !of theK from M but a: rt, md to n Muhammareh and Fallahiyah bj the murder of Haji Muhammad wag irremediable; a blood feud was declared, or at least existed; and former secret suspicion gave place to open enmity. Muhammareh, as it existed in 1843, was a quadrangular enclosure about 350 yards long by 300 yards broad. The mud wall which surrounded it was of the most ordinary kind ; its defences were destitute of artillery. It contained only one caravanserai for the accommodation of merchants ; and it consisted, for the rest, of rude Arab huts of mud and reeds. When Major Eawlinson, the British Political Agent at Baghdad, visited Muhammareh in that year, he found about a dozen vessels which had re cently discharged their cargoes anchored at the place. To avoid a Turkish brig of war that had been stationed at the mouth of the Karun to prevent vessels with Indian goods from entering the port, boats from the sea now ordinarily approached Muhammareh by the Bahmanshir instead of by the Shatt-al-^Arab, or else landed their cargoes on ■'Abbadan Island below the embouchure of the Karun, whence the goods were conveyed by land to a point opposite Muhammareh. There were no customs duties at the port, which was a main cause of its prosperity ; but it seemed probable that, in consequence of the extension of either Persian or Turkish effective control to it, that advantage was likely before long to be lost. A contemporary writer gives the following account of the political distribution of the tracts about Muhammareh in 1843 ; but'^ for the reasons noted below, it must be received with caution : 1 Sli # wr * ter course Ma i 01, Rawlinson, Political Agent at Baghdad, in his Memo- an( ^ randum on the Dispute, etc., 1844.

See foot note on page 40 ante. From his t transposition of Nahr Yusuf and Shakhsreh, of El Khagin (evidently Khaiyain) and lo'taMdjfflP^rband, it may be inferred that he had not himself any very close acquaintance with tilarly mai the tracts in question. His ' Boojidee ' is, doubtless, the modern Failiyeh which ground®'stands on the Abu Jadi Canal; the ' Eawa Arabs' must be the Bawiyeh; and his tons of ^ Tamar-El-Jadeed ' may be another instance of defective information, as there are two it of the tii^ s ti nc t tracts, Tamar and Jadid, more than a mile apart and separated from each other nson for ^ ^humaisen, Nahr i r usuf, and another tract.

The question of the relative positions of the disputed aymen tracts has now been cleared up by Lieutenant A. T. Wilson's admirable map and report •omtlie Mated 4th and 5th May 1912. to tltf 31 It must be remembered that, at the beginning of the discussions which resulted is so e Second Treaty of Erzeroum (1847), the British authorities favoured the Turkish « im to Muhammareh.

British relations with ; Arabistan, 1834-1848. In 1838 a piracy, accompanied by the murder of several persons, was committed on a Kharag vessel in the northern part of the Persian Gulf by Qawasim, the ringleaders being a certain Sultan-bin-Sohar and his brother missive to Kussian influence and unfriendly to Britain. The ultimate adherence of Britain to the Persian view regarding Muhammareh was regarded by Layard, at least (gee his Early Adventures, Volume II, page 437), as an unworthy concession to Russia. Major Rawlinson, employed as be was m Turkey, was necessarily exposed to the full play of Turkish ex-parte assertions and arguments ; and this may partly account for the resemblance between his attitude and that of the British Agent at Basrah in 1767. (See footnote, page 1627.) Mr. Layard, on his part, cannot but have been prejudiced against the Persian authorities by their abominable treatment of his friends, the ruling family of the Chaharlong division of the Bakhtiyaris. It may be noted that the two theories on which Muhammareh was claimed as Turkish territory are mutually destructive. The first was that of Eawlinson, who believed that the Bahmanshir was originally an eastern mouth of Shatt-al-'Arab, of which the Muham* mareh waterway was consequently a branch. The second was that of Layard who regarded the Muhammareh waterway as in its origin an artificial canal dug from the Katun into the Shatt-al-'Arab. Rawlinson cites ancient geographers in support of his theory {Notes on the Ancient Geograjphy of MohamrctJi and the Vicinity&gt; Journal of the Royal Geographical Society, Vol. XXVII, 1857); but he has no evidence to offer of the reversal of the flow of the water in the Muhammareh stream which his theory necessarily involves. Layard's explanation seems to be based on tho etymology of the word ' Haffar ' which, however, would mean 4c digger ' not 'dug,' while moreoAi er the Haffar tract is not on the Muhammareh waterway but altogetliBr above it. The present opportunity may be taken to correct, in the light of Lieutenant A. T. Wilsons recent researches, a statement in this Gazetteer'regarding the def ^cto Perso-Turkish boundary on the Shatt-al-'Arab, above the mouth of the Karun: see Volume II of this work, page 157, article ' Southern Arabistan.'

When the second volume was completed it was not known that the Turkish tracts of SulaimSniyah, Kharnubiyah, and Buwarin were surrounded by water, or that the mainland tracts of SaiyidThalib and Tamar, lying behind Kharnu- Myah an Buwann, were under the jurisdiction of the Shaikh of Muhammareh.

One of the victims was a wealthy subject of the Ka^ab Shaikh, who had fled from Muhammareh when it was attacked and taken by the Turks in 1837, and who was returning to his home. The case was taken uplenergetically by the British Eesident at Bushehr, with the result that Sultan-bin-Sohar was found and arrested at Lingeh, while his brother Muhammad and the Nakhuda of the offending vessel were also captured, but released on giving bonds to pay 100 crowns each. The principal delinquent was sent by the Kesident to the Ka^ab Shaikh for punishment, but history does not record his ultimate fate. The Qawasim of Lingeh and E-as-al-Khaimah, whose boats were accus tomed to make an annual voyage to Basrab, fearing the vengeance of the Ka'ab, sent them in this year in one fleet of 22 vessels for mutual protec tion and begged the British Resident to explain to Shaikh Thamir that the chiefs of both the Qasimi ports were not responsible for the outrage, and that the chief of Lingeh had in fact been at great trouble and expense to obtain reparation. The Eesident apparently complied with this request, and no reprisals were made by the Ka-'ab on the Qasimi fleet during its voyage. Friendly, though not very close, relations seem to have been maintained by the British Local Authorities with Shaikh Thamir during his tenure of the Ka ; ab Shaikhship. He occasionally met with officers of the Indian Navy at Muhammareh ; and, until his flight in 1841, he maintained a corre spondence with the British representative at Basrah and received from him 'kindness and assistance on various occasions when he was in trouble. - ' The very civil reception which he gave to the English traveller Mr. Layard, in 1841, is accounted for by these circumstances. With the Mo^tamad-ud-Dauleh, during his Governorship of ^Arabis- tan, the British authorities had no relations ; but Mr. Layard, in the course of his remarkable wanderings in the province, was more than once brought into contact with him. The Mo ; tamad evidently entertained strong objections to Mr. Layard''s presence in the country, being no doubt persuaded that he was a British spy or political agent and also afraid that, if any harm befell the traveller, the British Government might hold the Persian Government responsible for the mischance. It is an extraordinary fact that, in a conversation ^with Mr. Layard in the summer of 1841, the Mo tamad described as an accomplished fact the massacre of the British Envoy, Sir W. Macnaghten, and other British Officers at Kabul which actually took place. Very much in the manner described, some months later. Eventually he was said to have issued an order for Mr. Layard^s British Poli tical relations with Shaikh Thamir.

Prospects of British trade in 'Arabistan. arrest; but; before any opportunity of executing it occurred, it was ren dered innocuous by the return of the British Mission to Tehran and the resumption of good relations between Britain and Persia. At the end of 1840 ; when the attitude of the Mo^tamad-ud-Dauleh towards him became threatening^ Muhammad Taqi Khan, the great Bakhtiyari Chief, employed his friend Mr. Layard as an intermediary in making overtures to the British Political authorities. At the time there was no British Legation in Persia ; diplomatic relations between Britain and Persia were suspended ; the island of Kharag had been occupied by a British force ; and war between Britain and Persia was generally expected by native politicians in Arabistan. Muhammad Taqi Khan accordingly proposed that, if a rupture occurred, the British should avail themselves of his armed assistance against Persia, undertaking in return to protect him, after the conclusion of peace, from the vengeance of the Shah and to recognise him as paramount chief of ■'Arabistan. During a fortnights sojourn on Kharag, Mr. Layard brought the offer to the knowledge of Captain Hennell, the British Resident in the Persian Gulf ; but no hope of its being entertained was held out to him by that officer, who rightly judged that a peaceful solution of the difficul ties between Britain and Persia was impending. During his residence in ; Arabistan Mr. Layard was led to take an interest in the down-trodden Sabians of the province, whose lot—humbly moral, and industrious though they were—was rendered hard by religious persecution of an official rather than a popular character. To several Sabian families at Shushtar he was able to render some service by personal remonstrances with the Mo'tamad-ud-Dauleh ; and he afterwards took charge of a petition addressed by the Sabian community generally to the Queen of England, and endeavoured, not without success, to enlist the co-operation of Colonel Taylor, the British Political Agent at Baghdad, on their behalf. It does not appear whether his efforts on the larger scale had any ^ immediate result. It Was one of the principal objects of Mr. Layard, when a traveller in 'Arabistan, to open the province to British trade both with the United Kingdom and with India ; and he was successful in interesting a number of his native friends and acquaintances in his projects. * Many years aftei Wards, as Sir A. h. Layard and Her Britannic Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, he obtained a Faiman from the Sultan for the protec- tion of the Sabians of Turkish Iraq and was the medium through which Her Majesty Queen T ictoria personally sent some pecuniary relief to the Sabians {Early Adventures^ Vol. II, pages 170-171).I m lani dp He at first relied chiefly on the aid of Muhammad Taqi Khan, the Bakhtiyaii Chief; for the realisation of his ideas ; and his mission to Kharag from that chief in December 1840 had a commercial as well as a political side. Muhammad Taqi Khan was a man of some enlightenment; he had once attempted on his own account to export productions of the country direct to Bombay, but the ^ vessel with which the experiment was made foundered on the way ; and he was prepared to establish trade routes connecting his territory with the shores of the Persian Gulf and Shatt-al/Arab. On the 18th December 1840 Mr. Layard addressed a commercial letter on behalf of Muhammad Taqi Khan to Mr. Frith, a prominent Bombay merchant, for communication to the Bombay Chamber of Commerce, and that body at once responded with an invitation to for ward samples ; but the troubles in which the Bakhtiyari Chief was soon after involved and his capture by the Mo'tamad-Ud-Dauleh frustrated Mr. Layard^s schemes as originally conceived. On his journeys in ^Arabistan in 1841, and particularly at Shushtar, Mr. Layard collected a quantity of commercial as well as of geographical and political information ; he obtained promises from a number of the chiefs of the country and notables of the towns that they would do all in their power to promote and facilitate British trade, if established ; and on his return to Baghdad, early in 184^, he was able to induce some of the British merchants there; especially Mr. A. Hector^ to turn their attention to the exportable products of ^Arabistan. The more intelligent among the inhabitants of the province were at this time anxious to develop external trade relations, which, as Mr. Layard explained to them, would tend to check local Persian tyranny and misgovernment by making J Arabistan affairs more prominent in the eyes of the world. In 1841-42, while the ' Nitocris ' and ' Nimrod ^ were absent on an expedition to the upper Euphrates conducted by Lieutenants Lynch and Campbell, I.N., the remaining vessels of the British Mesopotamian flotilla, the ' Euphrates ' and the ' Assyria,^ under Lieutanant W. B. Selby, I.N., continued to have their head-quarters at Baghdad. In May 1841 Lieutenant Selby took one of them to the Karun^ which he ascended as far as Ahwaz, a point already reached by Major Estcourt with the ' Euphrates ' in 1836, and made fresh surveys and memoranda, * According to Selby {Account of the Ascent of the Kdrun, etc., page 237) the attempt was made through ' an English adventurer who had been in his service Without security of anj kind ** ; but Layard only says that the supercargo was a Christian {Early Adventuress Volume I, page 458)* (w v &amp; Navigation of the Karun, Karkheh Shatait, Gar gar, Diz and Bahmanshir rivers by the ' Assyria/' 1841-42.

The idea of extending steam navigation to Hawizeh by way of the Karkheh was accordingly abandoned, it being clear that the collapse of the Kut Nahr Hashim dyke in 1832 or 1837 had rendered the lower course of that river unnavigable, which before it probably was not. ^ Steps were next taken for examining the Karun river and its branches above Ahwaz, the steamer used being again the ' Assyria. ;; Lieutenant Selby was accompanied, as before, by Mr. Layard; and Dr. Eoss, the Surgeon of the Baghdad Residency, was also of the party. The Karun was entered at the beginning of March 1842, the water in the river being then high, and the Mo'tamad-ud-Dauleh, whose antipathy to British enterprise in ''Arabistan was notorious, having left the province for the northern districts of his charge. The rapids at Ahwaz, which were expected to prove a serious obstacle, were surmounted without difficulty by eking out deficient steam power with towage from the bank and the ' Assyria ' entered the upper river. From Band-i-Qir the Shatait branch of the Karun was first followed, and the steamer reached a point about six miles short of Shushtar, where a sudden fall of the floods left her stranded at a distance from the ordinary channel. The predicament was awkward, for no preliminary arrangements regarding the visit had been made with the local authorities^ |i c and the country was full of roaming bands of Arab marauders. The best possible face was therefore put on the matter by inviting the leading citizens of Shushtar to a reception on board, at which Lieutenant Selby and Dr. Eoss welcomed them in uniform : this expedient was suggested by Mr. Layard. Afterwards, the ' Assyria's ' guns were disembarked and mounted on earthworks thrown up around her; and efforts Were made, * It is difl5cu.lt to know to whom to assign the credit of having suggested the expedition to the Kamn, which is claimed both by Sir A. H.^Layard and by Lieutenant ^ Selby: see Layard's Early Adventures, Volume II, pages 342 and 355-56 (foot note) and Selby's Account of Ascent of the Kfturun, etc., at pages 219-220 of the Journal of the Royal Geographical Society, Yolume XIV, 1844. 'There are also other discrepancies between the accounts of the two authorities. Selby says that Captain Hennell, the British Resident at Bushehr, had written to the Government of Bombay urging that, for political reasons, no attempt to bring vessels of the British Mesopotamian flotilla up the Karun should be allowed, which obliged Selby to undertake the expedition at his own responsibility and risk; whereas according to Layard the enterprise was approved by Colonel Taylor, the British Political Agent at Baghdad, under whose orders the fiotilla then was. It would certainly seem, from the Baghdad Residency Surgeon s being detailed to accompany the cruise, that it was more than a personal a-nd unauthorised venture on the part of Lieutenant Selby.1678 with local assistance, to move her towards the river by means of rollers, but in vain. Lieutenant Selby then proceeded to lighten ship, by removing all machinery and stores, and to dig a deep trench through which the vessel might be floated back into the Shatait. His arrangements were almost completed when a sudden and unseasonable rise of the river, after endangering the machinery and stores landed which were saved not without difficulty, released the ' Assyria,^ fortunately undamaged, from her un comfortable position. Eeturning to Band-i-Qir, the ' Assyria ' entered the Gargar and ran up it to within a mile of Shushtar. Her European sailors and marines freely visited the town, where they conducted themselves with propriety and were invariably well treated. At the departure of the vessel from Shush tar some of the leading citizens of the place were taken on board for a trip, and, on their landing to return home, were honoured with a salute from the ships guns,—attentions by which they were greatly delighted. Before returning to Muhammareh, the ' Assyria ' mounted the Diz affluent of the Karun to a place some miles above Kut Bandar, and might have advanced even nearer to Dizful town, had not prudence and a falling river counselled a retreat. In the course of these explorations, which lasted into April, lions, then common in 'Arabistan, were more than once sighted. Lieutenant Selby also demonstrated the navigability of the Bahman- shir by carrying one of his steamers from Muhammareh to the sea and back via that channel; but whether this was done in 1841, or in the execu tion of the Karun programme of 1842 &gt; is not clear. In December 1844 Shaikh Faris, the Shaikh of the Ka^ab tribe, caused a Batil belonging to the Arab port of the Abu Dhabi to be seized at Muham mareh, where she happened to call, together with her cargo worth about £75. His excuse was a Ka^ab claim against the people of Abu Dhabi, more than 30 years old, — one which, moreover, had been cancelled by later events. On the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi^s requesting that either satisfaction should be obtained for him or he should be allowed to take forcible mea sures himself, the British Eesident at Bushehr wrote to Shaikh Fans advising him to give up the boat; but the Ka^ab chief merely replied that he proposed to carry on hostilities against Abu Dhabi until his claim Was satisfied. Major Hennell On this, in February 1845, sent his Assistant, Captain Kemball to Muhammareh in the schooner ' Emily but Far is, though he was at a place only two days^ journey inland, did not come to Muhammareh in the eleven day during which Captain Kemball waited for him there, nor did he answer a letter which was delivered to him.

At length, in May 1845, the Batil and her stores were recovered from the KVab and taken in charge by Lieutenant Ford, who had been sent in the schooner ' Constance ^ to obtain her release.

He appear ed to be on good terms with the Persian Governor of the province, the Mo^tamad-ud-Dauleh ; but his journey had no visible political results, and from his own account of it would seem to have been undertaken * without any political object.

A. Saldanha's Precis of Persian Arahistan Affairs, 1904, and Lieutenant A. T. Wilson's of the Relations of the British Government with the Tribes and Shaikhs of Arabistan, 1912. These cover the whole period and are supplemented, from 1872 onward, by the Persian Gulf Residency Administration Reports* Loftus's Travels and Researches in Chaldcea and Susiana, 1857, con tains some information in regard to local events in 1850-52.

Persian administration of 'Arabistan, 1848-1896. een sent:: 34-1841 i exMtt At the beginning of the period the ruler of /Arabistan on the part Government of the Shah's Government was Siilaiman Khan^ known as the Hisam- ^^nn 511 ud-DauIeh ; a Christian^ the relation and apparently the immediate 1851. successor of Manuchehr Khan, the infamous Mo'tamad-ud-Dauleh. Heap His administiation seems to have been as effioient as was possible in the mm circumstances; but in 1850 the paramount chief of the Bakhtiyaris cal resi defied his authority, and there was fighting upon the Karkhah between idertab the Bani Lam and the A1 Kathir which the Governor could not prevent and m which the former tribe seem to have had the advantage. The A1 Kathir had been brought regularly under Persian authority for the first time in the reign of Muhammad Shah, and in 1850 the revenue assessed on them was 2,500 Tumans or about £1,250. Towards the a inarb en( ^ 1850 Sulaiman Khan's position had become precarious, as explained by a * British traveller who gave the following account of lyVolnmi him and his affairs : — tie reign ^ Christian governor of a Mohammedan province was an extraordinary man, 'sknip * ls ' as 1- have said, difficult to understand how he sustained his position among i Gom*' tlie ^goted community. He was a jolly, stout bid gentleman, and perhaps, if his red ile period ^ no t helie him, addicted to veritable shfraz, or something stronger. He was Imnistd ^ and courage ; but the sun of his greatness had well nigh set; the days of 1^- f were nilm hered. In an evil hour he was ordered to quell an insurrection at a* in tlle adjoining district of Firuz Mirza, the Shah 's uncle, which the prince Outm^ J ailed to do. Suleyman Khan was successful, and the prince, indignant that a the ai g }awr &gt; ^ outdone himself, intrigued to effect the discharge! of his successful atcbes, ^ ® 0In P e titor from the office he filled with such ability. The! old gentleman complained f the ^ eV ® re ail&lt; ^ w ith justice, of this conduct, and was soon about to deliver up the reins with W ^ ov ernment. , and i ^ In 1851 the province came under the administration of His Royal Government ^ nness Khanlar Mirza, afterwards the Ihtisham-us-Saltaneh, regarding Mlr^^l851 to about * Loftus, in his Travels and ResearcheSf pages 832-335. I860.1676 whose assumption of power the details below have been '^preserved by the author just quoted The threatened discharge of Suleyman Khan from the administration of the province actually took place : bribery and court intrigue had done their work. The Christian had played the same game, and ventured a high stake; a purse of tomans to the Shah, and 20,000 more to the Amir were spent in vain, Khanler Mirza, the favourite uncle of the Shah took possession of the province. He had previously governed the Gulpaigan district, near Isfahan, where his stern and unflinching distribution of justice gained him the greatest respect. To this were now added Liiristan, KMzistan, and the Bakhtiyari mountains, so that Khanler Mirza ruled over the largest, richest, and most important region throughout Persia. As a natural consequence of the change of governors, the whole of the above districts were in an excited state, and with difficulty prevented from breaking out into open rebellion. A few judicious examples were made by the Prince, whose iron rule soon made itself felt, alike among Liirs and Arabs. Ai the end of 1851, the Only disaffection still existing throughout the Prince's dominion was at its north-western extremity, among a division of the Feyli Liirs. Early in 1852 Khanlar Mirza visited Kut Nahr Hashing intending to repair the dyke there, the failure of which had ruined Hawizeh some 15 or 20 years earlier; but it does not appear that his efforts were crowned by any greater success than those of the Mo^tamad-ud-Dauleh in 1842. The traveller already twice cited f has left this description of tlie Prince Governor as he was in 1852 : His Highness, Khanler Mirza, might then be about thirty-five years of age, and was a remarkably handsome man, although somewhat pale, the result, it was whispered, of dissipation. His intelligent features, high forehead, full black eyes, and aquiline nose, would have anywhere rendered him an object of attraction. He did not generally bear a good name, but, from circumstances which afterwards presented them' selves to my notice, I arrived at the conclusion that he was an admirable governor of a Persian Province, stern and unrelenting to the criminal, but usually mild and lenient towards othero. If he called on his subjects for a large increase of their taxes (the chief charge against him), it was, I would fain believe, with the intention of applyh^ the proceeds to the,public good. He was building and repairing bridges, erecting dams for the better distribution of water, and engaged in other substantial works, which, if fully carried out, would be of the utmost consequence to the prosperity of Khuzistan. He was reported to be cruel in his punishments, but that is as much the fault of the people as of their rulers ; they never have a due respect for the authority of a governor unless a few executioos take place on his assumption of office. The Persian forces expelled from Muhammareh and Ahwaz by the British in the war of 1856-57 were commanded by Khanlar Mim, but the Prince retained the government of 'Arabistan for some time after. # Loftus, in his Travels and Researches, pages 355-356. t Ibidem, pages 361-362.1677 The Ihtisham-us-Saltaneh was succeeded about 1860 by the Ziya-ul- Mulk ; who remained in office till 1862. The successors of the Ziya-ul- Mulk were His Royal Highness Farhad Mirza (1862-69) and His Royal Highness Hamzah Mirza (1869-80) known as the Hashmat-ud- Dauleh; two uncles of the Shah^ of whom the latter was already known in connection with Khurasan affairs^ while the former was distined to become at a later date Governor-Greneral of Ears. The nominal seat of fche Hashmet-ud-Dauleh was Khurramabad^ Luristan as well as 'Arabis- tan being under his control ; but. in the later days of his administration^ lie was generally engaged in collecting the revenue of the low countries with the aid of a military force and in such circumstances made Shushtar his headquarters. The total revenue of ^Arabistan in 1878-79 was 137,000^ Tumans, of which about a quarter was appropriated by the Prince Governor as Pishkash for himself, the remainder, called Divan, y, being credited to the Imperial Treasury. In March 1880 the Zill-us-Sultan, the eldest surviving but not the 1 favourite son of the Shah, was entrusted with the administration of )i Arabistan in addition to that of Isfahan and other territories j but Isfahan was his place of abode, and he did not, apparently, visit ^Arabistan. Instead he appointed local Governors to represent him, at first Ja^far Quli Khan, then Amirzadeh 'Abdullah Mirza, and finally, not later than in 1882, His Royal Highness Khanlar Mirza, Ihtisham-us-Sultaneh who had governed the province 30 years on his own account. The Ihtisham-us-Sultaneh who generally lived atDizful not Shushtar, visited Muhammareh in May 1883 with a regiment of Persian infantry. In 1884 or 1885 the Zill-us-Sultan cancelled the appointment of the Ihtisham-us-Saltaneh, and 'Arabistan and Luristan were combined under the Muzaffar-ul-Mulk, His Royal Highnesses Governor of Burujird and Khurramabad who in 1885 made a tour to Fallahiyeh and Muhammareh With two Persian regiments, causing many Arab Shaikhs to prepare to seek safety in Turkey. In 1887 or 1888 a new Governor was appointed to 'Arabistan in the person of the * Nizam-us-Saltaneh, probably by the Persian Central overnment, for it was at this epoch that the glory of the Zill-us-Sultan suffered eclipse. He had ruled for some years over nearly a half of Persia, wc uding all the southern and south-western provinces, which were now ^ake n away leaving him only Isfahan.

The administra tion of this Prince was on the whole successful, and he retained tho Government until March 1895, when the Nizam-us-Saltaneh was re appointed to 'Arabistan. The Province suffered from a visitation of cholera in 1893. Public Works were not entirely neglected by the Persian authorities in ; Arabistan, especially after the opening of the Karun to navigation in 1888, but the results of their endeavours were not very remarkable. In 1879 Shushtar and Muhammareh were temporarily brought into telegraphic communication with Tehran vid Dizful; but the line was badly constructed and frequently cut in the Lur country, and it did not long remain in operation. In 1889 a Government House, barracks, a landing stage, and a public bath were built by the Nizam-us-Saltanehat Muhammareh ; other erections, such as barracks, were begun at Nasiri ; and large sums were spent, but without avail, in trying to restore the Difzul bridge at Shushtar. In February 1891 a Persian post office was opened at Muhammareh; and in August Muhammareh, Ahwaz, Shushtar and Dizful were joined by a Persian telegraph line, which in the following year was connected, by way of Ramuz, Behbehan, Dilam, and Big, with the main system of telegraphs at Burazjan. In 1894, a weekly Persian postal service which had been instituted between Muhammareh and Shushtar collapsed for want of funds, and the offices were closed until the following year. One consequence of the opening of the Karun to the world was the extension to ■'Arabistan of the system under which the Persian Foreign Office are represented at centres where important foreign interests exist by Karguzars or departmental agents, charged with the conduct of all public business relating to foreigners, dealing directly with Tehran, and not subject to the control of any local Persian authority. At Bushehr as related elsewhere, this system had already for a long time been a fertile cause of difficulties. In January 1889 Sartlp Mirza Kazim Khan arrived at Muhammareh, where he had been appointed Karguzar under the Persian Ministry of Foreign Affairs ; and a similar official.© depsndeut bovvever on the department of the A-tnin-us-Sultan, Farmor- ^ General of the customs of Persia, was posted to Nasiri. 6o %iiii, m Hfc Internal affairs of Northern 'Arabistan, excluding Ramnz, 1848-96. wo yeati was tf, We may now briefly review the internal history of the districts of Rise of drainisk J^rabistan more directly under the supervision of the Persian Governor decline of^ than those adjoining the Shatt-al-'Arab and Persian Gulf.

In October 1891 Anafijeh tribesmen attacked a caravan near Shushtar and carried off some rifles j but Shaikh Farhan, on whom they depended, made his peace with the Government; and thereafter an improvement was noticeable in the state o£ the surrounding country, which had been seriously disturbed. In 189^ there was a partial failure of crops, which, aided by the weakness of the Shahab-ul-Mulk's administration, caused raids by Bani Turuf in the neighbourhood of Ahwaz and by Sagward Lurs on the Dizful-Shushtar road. In 1894 the Dizful-Khurramabad road became unsafe for caravans, and the Hisam-us-Saltanah resorted to military operations against the Dirakwand Lurs, in which he was assisted by some of the Bakhtiyaris, In May a number of the Dirakwand were captured and deported, but the road remained impassable; feuds broke out among the Bakhtiyaris them selves ; and the security of the Dizful-Shushtar road also was affected. In 1895-96 the A1 Kathir committed raids in the vicinity of Dizful, in revenge for the alienation of lands which they claimed, and a punitive expedition against them became necessary; while the Lur tribes were guilty of such depredations as to cause many settled villages to be deserted by their inhabitants. Affairs of the Ramuz district, 1848-1896. About the year 1879 the district of Ramuz was farmed, by the Persian Government, sometimes to a member of the Shaikh of Muhammareh^s family, sometimes to one of the Bakhtiyari Khans. The district was assessed by the Persian Government in 1883-84 at 140,000 Qrans. In or about 1888 a rebellion took place at Ramuz, which resulted in the ejectment of a Local Governor appointed by the Persian authorities and in the setting up of another by the people themselves. The Nizam-us-Saltaneh confirmed the popular candidate, after exacting increased Pishkash from him. Affairs of the Hawizeh district, 1848-1896. Hawizeh was a district over which, on account of its marshy character, the Persian Government could exercise but little control; and great care was required on their part in appointing a local governor, as revenue could not be recovered from the inhabitants except through an authority approved by them.

In 1879 there were many Arabs from Turkish territory settled in 1879. the Hawizeh district, who had fled from beyond the Tigris to escape the di N exaction of the Shaikh of the Muntafik. Such immigrants were accustom^ edto pay revenue to the Mania or chief of Hawizeh when he was strong, 111 a nd to refuse it when they found him weak. Wul-I In the autumn of 1881 Mania Mutallib was recognised by the 1881-88, efor® Persian authorities as ruler of Hawizeh. In 1883-84 this individual tts agi still held the district on an assessment of 230,000 Qrans; but about tie Ball 1888, though supported by the Persian Government, he had to make ported^ way for a more popular rival. Mania Nasir Ullah with whom the ditiyaiis: Nizam-us-Saltaneh profited by the occasion to stipulate for higher was al Pishkash than before. ofH In May 1891 there were serious disturbances at Hawizeh, due to 1891. mdapi the appointment of an unacceptable Governor, for which the Bani Turuf jur tritil were chiefly responsible. The rebels were defeated by Persian troops villages; in a sharp action outside Hawizeh village, and the Shaikh who led them soon afterwards made his submission.

Displacement of Shaikh Jabir from Muhamma- reh, 1860— 62. Shah and a great part of that of Fat-h ; Ali Shah, by Shaikh Haji Jabir, Muhaisin, whose tenure of power extended from 1819 to 1881. In April 1857, on news of the peace concluded between Britain and Persia reaching Muhammareh, though the British were still in military occupation of that town, Shaikh Jabir opened negotiations with His Royal Highness Khanlar Mirza, the Persian Governor of ''Arabistan, who had retreated to Dizful, with a view to ensuring his own retention as Shaikh of Muhammareh; and he seems to have thought that his own loyalty would be rendered more conspicuous in the eyes of the Persian Govern ment were the British authorities to set up in his place—as had been proposed and as he perhaps hoped—his rival, the Kaab Shaikh Faris. Shaikh Jabir's residence was at this time at '^Da^aiji in Turkish territory, whither he had apparently retired on or before the arrival of the British military expedition ; and, with his usual astuteness, he did not hesitate to engage in a correspondence on the subject of Muham mareh with the Turkish authorities at Basrah also, to whose designs of making good the Turkish claim to the place he even pretended to lend himself. All these manoeuvres of his were not regarded as a bar to the restitution of Muhammareh to his representative by the British authorities, on the cessation of the British military occupation ; and the Prince Governor, after the departure of the British forces, not only confirmed Shaikh Jabir in possession of Muhammareh but placed him in charge of Fallahiyeh, also, removing Shaikh Faris to make way for him. On the recall of His Royal Highness Khanlar Mirza from ■'Arabistan and the appointment in his stead of the Ziya-ul-Mulk, Shaikh Jabir fell for a time on evil days. A successful rebellion against his authority took place at Fillahiyeh ; the Ka'ab defeated the Muhaisin in a great battle at Munikh on the Bahmanshir and even occupied Muhammareh, where Shaikh Faris, with Persian military support, installed his brother Hashim as his representative; and the new Persian Governor, having treacherously decoyed Shaikh Jabir from his asylum at Da/aiji in Turkish territory to his own camp at Moran on the Karun, on pretence of arranging with him for a joint attack upon Pallahiyeh, there treacher ously made him a prisoner. The Shaikh was afterwards sent in custody to Shustar, his son being handed over as a hostage to the Ka'ab chief, and apparently remained under detention until the end of the Ziya-ul- Mulk^s Government. *Se0 Outram's Persian Campaign in 1857, page 249.1683 to ihjl I in mill d) wtoli onasStl own loji 'sian Got ■as kd 1- ikh Faris, i in % the arml ness, bl it of Mnk e designs ended to k as a h by the Bi ion; audi irces, noti om 'Arali kh authoril- mareh, ^ his ^ 'ernor, hi at Drii , on f iherew at in ^ &gt; the Kf In 1862, on the appointment of His Rojal Highness Parhad Mirza to the Government of ^Arabistan, Shaik Jabir was at once liberated and sent back to Muhammareh as 'Deputy Governor, with the support of Persian soldiery and guns. On his arrival at his own town two Ka'ab Shaikhs, Sultan-bin-Thamir and Hashim-bin-Ghaith, the latter a brother of Shaik Faris, were killed; but the circumstances of the affair are obscure. In the same year Shaikh Jabir received the title of NuSrat- ul-Mulk from the Persian Government. Prom his restoration in 1862 until his death at a very advanced age, probably over 90, in 1881, Shaikh Jabir governed his ancestral posses sions with conspicuous ability and success. Between 1873 and 1875 he urged the improvement of the Karun river, with a view to the extension of steam navigation to Shushtar; but he was unable to interest the Persian Government in his schemes, and by himself he could do no thing to carry it into effect. In 1875 there were difficulties between him and the Persian Government on the subject of the revenue payable for Muhammareh, and he was accused of having resisted the Persian Governor's troops and of aiming at independence; but apparently the charges were without foundation and blew over. In February 1879, his physical powers beginning to fail, though his mental ability and political influence remained unaffected, Shaikh Jabir visited Bombay for medical advice. In his absence his son Muhammad Khan waited on the Persian Governor of the province. His Boyal Highness Hamzeh Mirza, at Shushtar, as bearer of the Muhammareh revenue, by which means it was hoped that a personal visit by the Hashmat-ud-Pauleh to Muhammareh might be averted; and meanwhile Miz'al Khan, a younger son of Shaikh Jabir, remained in charge at Muhammareh itself. A proposal that the Ka'ab districts should be farmed to the Shaikh of Muhammareh, of which Muhammad Khan was the mouth-piece, was at least favourably entertained by the Prince Governor ; but it was intimated that Shaikh Jabir^s sojourn at Bombay was regarded with disfavour by the Persian Government, for political reasons, and that he ought to return to Muhammareh. This he did; and the Prince Governor's apprehended visit to Muhammareh then took place ? ' with the usual financial result.' By 1880 the health of Shaikh Jabir had become very precarious; and, after a final rally, he died in October of the following year, having governed Muhammareh for more than 60 years. . Jabir was ff a shrewd, calculating Arab, far beyond his race m intelligence and civilisation.'

Shaikh Jabir left, at his death, only two sons capable of succeeding him ; these were Muhammad Khan and Miz'al Khan, already mention ed. There was also a son Khaz/al, who was at the time too young to he a competitor for the Shaikhship; and another, named Salman, if still alive, was dull and unambitious. Shaikh Jabir himself seems to have hesitated in the choice of his successor. Both Muhammad Khan and Miz'al Khan were accounted good fighting men; and in ability and popularity there was, perhaps, little difference between them. Until 1879 or later Shaikh Jabir treated the senior of the two as his successor and appeared to regard the other with a sort of senile jealousy ; but for some months before his death he employed the junior as his agent in all matters of business, and apparently expressed a formal wish that he should be recognised as heir to the Shaikhdom. On the decease of Shaikh Jabir the Government of Muhammareh was provisionally assumed, pending orders from the Persian authorities, by Muhammad Khan as the elder son, and he spared no efforts to conciliate his younger brother; but the Muhaisin, as a body, and the Dris division of the Ka^ab preferred Mi^'al Khan. On this fact coming to the knowledge of the Zill-us-Sultan, then Governor General of 'Arabistan and of other pro vinces, the Persian Farman of appointment was made out in the name of Shaikh Miz'al Khan. Muhammad Khan, contrary to the general expectation, did not attempt to dispute the award by force but proceeded to Ispahan, where the Zill-us-Sultan caused him to be detained; and the peace of Muhammareh remained undisturbed. By 1883, after the reduction in August of some rebellious Ka ; ab of the Nassar section, whom the Shaikh of Kuwait was believed to have incited to revolt, the power of Shaikh Miz'al Khan appeared to be locally well consolidated; but in 1884 his brother Muhammad Khan was allowed to escape from Dizful, where he had been confined, and made his way to Fallahiyeh, while the Shaikh himself seemed afraid that the increasing demands of the Persian authorities might oblige him in the end to resign the Government of Muhammareh. It was granted to him only from year to year, and had been farmed to him in the beginning for1685 450,000 Qrans or Rs. 1,80,000 per annum. In 1883 or 1884 the SaW- ul-Mulk from Bushehr ¥isited Muhammareh with a view to the transfer of the customs house from the Shaikh to the Persian authorities ; but the project was successfully resisted by Shaikh Miz^al. In 1885 a nominal reconciliation was effected between the Shaikh and his brother Muhammad Khan, and it was arranged that the latter should reside at Sabiliyat—apparently the place of that name in Turkish territory on the west bank of the Shatt-al-'Arab— and that a monthly allowance of 100 Tumans a month and a date plantation should be assigned to him for his support. In 1887 the authority of the Shaikh was again defied by the Nassar Ka'ab, and the services of the Persian gunboat u Persepolis' were lent him for the purpose of reducing them to obedience, which was apparently effected. In 1888 Shaikh Miz^al received the title of Mu^azz- us-Saltaneh y which, with visits to Muhammareh by various Persian officials, cost him 20,000 Tumans over and above the ordinary revenue payments of the year. It was believed that Shaikh Miz^al Khan designedly obstructed the growth of Muhammareh, lest any appearance of prosperity there should tempt the Persian authorities to increase their demands on him as Shaikh; and he certainly regarded every extension of the power of the central Persian Government in 'Arabistan with alarm, this perhaps being the principal reason of his hostility to general navigation on the Karun river, concerning which we shall have more to say hereafter. By degrees the popularity of the Shaikh with the tribes under his Government waned, chiefly in consequence of the avariciousness of his behaviour. Besides increasing taxation generally, a matter in which the demands of the Persian Government possibly left him no option, he claimed the personal ownership of land at Muhammareh and in its pio« neighbourhood, to which his father had never pretended, and asserted a right of evicting the hereditary cultivators of date groves in favour of higher bidders. In 1895 he was still able to maintain excellent order U in his dominions, but his subjects were extremely dissatisfied with him, 1 til and most of the headmen of tribes had already signed documents pledging themselves to support his younger brother Khaz^al in certain eventualities. Affairs of the Ka'ab districts, 1848—96. Ihe evolutions of Shaikh Jabir at the close of the Anglo-Persian war Governineiit of 1856-57 have already been mentioned. They resulted in the deporta- 0 '1686 Fallahiyeh by the Shaikh of Muham- mareh, about 1857— 60. Later Grov- ernment of Shaikh Faris, KVab, at Fallahiyeh, 1860—68.

Shaikh Jabir sent his son Muhammad Khan to represent him at Fallahiyeh j but during his absence at Burujird, where the Persian Governor had required him to attend, the Ka^ab rose against this deputy. The loss of his new districts was averted only by his own immediate return and the capture by him of Fallahiyeh. On the appointment of the Ziya-ul-Mulk to the Government of 'Arabistan, Shaikh Faris was released from his detention at Tehran, while his relation Lutf Ullah raised most of the Ka'ab tribes against the Muhaisin administration, to which however the Dris division of the Ka^ab remained faithful. The result, as already noted, was a serious defeat of Shaikh Jabir at Munikh and the temporarv establishment of a Ka'ab government at Muhammareh itself, after which Shaikh Jabir Was seized and in his turn deported by the Persian authorities. In 1862 Shaikh Jabir was replaced in authority at Muhammareh j and in 1868 Shaikh Faris became blind and was succeeded in the chiefship of the Ka^ab districts by his son Muhammad. In May 1878 Shaikh Luft Ullah-bin-Mubadir, generally known as Shaikh Lufti, a member of the Shaikhly family of Fallahiyeh but a worn-out debauchee and occasional sufferer from delirium tremens, who had ousted Shaikh Muhammad-bin-Faris from the Shaikhship in 1872 or earlier, was murdered with his son Ghadhban in the Jarrahi district by Ja far and Salman, sons of the said Muhammad. Eahmah-bin-'lsa, a nephew of Shaikh Faris, was appointed in Shaikh Lufti's place by the Persian authorities on his promising a total revenue, for the Fallahiyeh district only, of 10,000 Tumans a year. At the same time the Jarrahi and Hindiyan districts, as well as Ma'shur, were detached from the Ka^ab Shaikhdom and farmed to Amir Abdullah, of Dih Mulla in Hindiyan, on an annual assessment of 12,000 Tumans in addition to 9,000 Tumans which he already paid for M Mulla. The season being a bad one Amir 'Abdullah failed to meet his engagements ; and Shaikh Eahmah, the new chief of Fallahiyeh, whose control was feeble, found himself unable to raise more than 4,000 Tumans of the amount due by him. Upon this, to enable Shaikh Rahmah to recover the demand Persian troops were sent to Fallahiyeh under Asad Ullah Khan, the Wazir of the Persian Governor.1687 In 1880 ; after negotiations for a lease of the districts to Shaikh Jabir 1880-8' of Muhammarehj of which the issue is not certainly known, and after an unsuccessful trial of Ja^far-bin-Muhammad—a grandson of Shaikh Paris--as Shaikh, Rahmah was again set over Eallahiyeh, while Amir ^Abdullah apparently continued to hold the other Ka^ab districts. In 1881 Shaikh Rahmah was confirmed in the Government, which he retained until 188when being found incompetent, he was displaced in favour of Ja^far-bin-Muhammad, the due payment of revenue by whom to the Persian authorities was guaranteed for one year by the Shaikh of Muharamareh; and the new Shaikh was installed by the help of Shaikh Miz^al Khan, notwithstanding the existence of a strong party which still favoured Shaikh Rahmah. The Persian assessment of the Pallahiyeh district in 1883—84 was 150,000 Qrans. In 1885 ? in which year the MuzalfaiMil-Mulk, Governor of ■'Arabistan, Im personally visited Fallahiyeh, Shaikh Ja-'far was temporarily removed and Shaikh Rahmah re-instated, the Shaikh of Muhammareh being requested to support him; but this substitution was cancelled almost as soon as made. In September 1888 the Nizam-us-Saltaneh, Governor of ''Arabistan, 1888. visited Fallahiyeh with a force of 500 Persian infantry and some Bakhtiyari horse; his coming was apparently connected with the recent expulsion by the Ka'ab of Shaikh ^Abdullah, probably a brother so named of Shaikh Rahmah, who had some months previously been appointed instead of Shaikh Ja ; far; but the people were in no mood to discuss the question with him, they flooded the country round Fallahiyeh making the place impregnable by his force, and he was unable to advance nearer than Gharaibeh on the Jarrahi River. In 1893 the Ka^ab became dissatisfied with Shaikh ^Abdullah and 1893- deposed him in favour of Shaikh Jafar; but the Shaikh of Muhammareh, who preferred ^Abdullah, succeeded in persuading the Hisam-us-Saltaneh to reappoint him. The opposition of the Ka^ab was so strong, however, that in January 1894, while on a visit to Muhammareh, the Prince Governor reversed his action and recognised Shaikh Ja^far. In the course of the year there was a movement of the tribes in support of Shaikh ^Abdullah, and their wishes were again met by his restoration to power. Difficulties then at once arose in regard to arrears of revenue; an attempted compromise failed; and by ]895 Shaikh Ja^far was once more in power. The Ka^ab Shaikhdom, as is evident, had now entirely fallen to pieces. There was no longer any permanency in the Shaikh^s tenure of power;168B his selection depended on the Persian authorities and was sometimes influenced by the Shaikh of Muhammareh; he had sunk^ in fact, into a mere collector of taxes for the Persian Government and he had become the puppet of his nominal subjects^ instead of governing as his ancestors had done.

Relations of the Persian Governors of ^rabistan with the Turkish authorities, 1878. Matters connected with the general relations of Persia and Turkey on the Muhammareh-Basrah frontier are dealt with, for the most part ; in the chapter on the history of Turkish ''Iraq: such, in particular, are questions concerning the position of the common boundary and piracies committed in the Shatt-al-^Arab. The attempted delimitation of the 'Arabistan section of the Perso-Turkish frontier in 1850—1852 is described at length in the chapter mentioned, as are also the proceedings at a later time in regard to Shalhah Island. In October 1893 the Turkish authorities began to levy duties at Fao m the Shatt-al-'Arab on goods consigned to or exported from Muham mareh, and it was understood that the Wali of Basrah had been instructed to treat Muhammareh and the Persian bank of the Shatt-al- 'Arab as Turkish territory. The Persian Government complained; and some British Indian vessels having been interfered with under the new arrangements, a strong protest was lodged by His Britannic Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople. The Porte then disowned the pretensions attributed to them, and the irregular levy of duties at Fao was discon tinued. The Persian Governors of 'Arabistan were brought but little into con tact with the officers of the Porte, the districts under the personal supervision of the former meeting Turkish 'Iraq only in the wild tribal tracts upon the Hawizeh border. donhtf.? 6 S r n r + 0f . 1878 a seri0us raid was made bani lamof ctlf / f ^ Shushtar, whence they insT f T 0f 1MleS alKl shee P 5 but a Bakhtiyari chief, at the almost it w T G0Vern0r ' fel1 UPOn them in Persian tei,ritorv alld almost, it was said, annihilated them.

The influence which Shaikh Jabir acquired in the Basrah Wilayat through his estates there was very great; but it was not abused bj him, and its existence does not seem to have been resented by the Turkish authorities of the day. The local Turkish officials did not, in his time, show any aggressive disposition towards the ruler of Muham mareh,—a circumstance due partly to the moderation which distinguished Shaikh Jabir's external as it did his internal policy, and partly to the cul ar jr weakness of the Turkish Government at Basrah. Later, in the days of Shaikh Jabir's successor, the attitude of the 1881-96.

Major Hennell complied by despatching, at the end of December 1848, the sloop of war ' Elphinstoneand the brig of war ' Euphratesbut the Euphrates ^ went ashore on the island of Khargu en route, and was so seriously damaged that she had to return to Bushehr. In the meanwhile, also, Major Rawlinson received from Tehran orders addressed by the Shah to Sulaiman Khan, then Governor of ^Arabistan, who was ' no less distinguished for his liberal principles than for his firm administration!;'''' and, good prospects of redress by ordinary means being thus afforded, the plan of a British naval demon stration was laid aside. The action of Major Eawlinson and Major Hennell was disapproved by the Government of Bombay, who considered that they ought not to have entered on preparations for the use of force without instructions from His Britannic Majesty^s Charge^d' Affaires at Tehran; and, as the Politi cal Agent in Turkish ^Iraq was under the direct orders of the Governmenl; of India, they reported the case to that authority. Major Hennell justified his part in the proceedings by referring to orders which had been issued by the Government of India at the time of Major Bawlin- son^s appointment to Baghdad in 1843, authorising that officer u to issue directions and to address requisitions to all the political and naval officers in the Persian Gulf, as occasion may require but the Government of Bombay did not exonerate hi»n from blame, it having been laid down in the orders quoted that the discretionary power conferred on Majot EawlinsOn ^vas not to be used ' on all ordinary occasions,^ but only circumstances ' demanding its immediate exercise,^ such as did m f^ 111 not in the present instance exist. The Government of India concurred in the views of the Government of Bombay and informed Major Rawlin* son of them for his future guidance. Towards the close of 1849 Colonel Williams, the British representative on the Commission for the delimitation of the Perso-Tarkish Frontier, then assembled at Baghdad, asked Captain Kemball, the Political Agent in Turkish ^Iraq, to communicate with the Resident at Bushebr with a view to British cruisers being sent to Muhammareh, where the work of the commission was to begin, to ' give to the opening scene of their labors a judicious eclat, as well as a moral influence over the population of the Chaab district,^ On the ground that no measures of coercion or intimidation were involved, this request was recommended by Captain Kemball, who K si i^cli HuIt? 1691 'ititle, ' informed the Government of India of his having done so, to Major 9 Hennell, the Resident at Bushehr, but whether any British vessels were afterwards assembled at Muhammareh to grace the adv int of the tbS Commission is not clear, iad to! lai ^ Operations of the Anglo-Persian War in ^Arabistan, 1856-57 navaUi ^ British campaign in Southern Persia in 1856-57 concluded with operations at Muhammareh and on the Karun River. as it was Sir J.

Another serious consideration was the safety lers wi of Mshell ^ wll i cll i t W as thought that the Persian army in Pars might ^ 01 ^ attack on a reduction being made in the garrison ; accordingly a force officer 'of some 3,000 men remained for its defence, including artillery, which nd naval i an ^ heavy guns, were placed in the redoubts already built to Governi g^gj^gthen the entrenched camp.

Most of these ships had, in addition to their1692 • . i j jjll principal armamentj two Impounders and two 3-pounder boat guns; but of their heavy guns, which were mounted in broadside, only half could I be brought to bear at the same time on river-hank fortifications. . JleSi! The despatch of the troops from Bushehr began on the 4th March llf and the leading ships crossed the bar and entered the Shatt-al-'Arab on the 8th, anchoring off Ma'amareh on 'Abbadan Island ; but General ! (ri %cc ■ Havelock and the staff of the 3nd Division did not arrive there until tie 15th; and the coming of Sir J. Outram to assume the general directioi of affairs was still further retarded by various causes, among which were ^ ^isnort^ expectations of a Persian attack on Uushehr, delay in the completion .^bni of the 3nd Division without which it would be difficult both to hold ijjplaeed Bushehr and attack JVi uhammareh, the suicides of General Stalker and 1 inposlti Commodore Ethersey, and, finally, bad weather. While the fleet of war jimll vessels and transports was assembling at MVamareh, all landing by tie 1: troops on either side of the river was prohibited,—in order to avoid, Jltomtl on the Persian bank, loss of life in useless skirmishes, and, on tte LjllieS Turkish, violation of the neutrality of Turkey. Irregulars of the enemy | who occupied a village opposite the anchorage in considerable strength i a Mais gave no sign of hostility, except by flring on boats that approached the I ^een left bank of the river too closely. Sir J. Outram arrived at Ma'amareh on the 21st March in the ' Ferooz'; and on the 24th the whole fleet, numbering nearly 50 vessels exclusive of ships of war, moved up the Shatt-al-'Arab and anchored off the village of Hartheh on 'Abbadan Island, three or four miles below the mouth of the Karun. Some of the larger vessels, which encountered difficulties by the way, did not reach therendezvous with the others; and the attack on Muhammareh which had been resolvedion was consequently postponed from the next day to the day after. It had been impressed upon the Arab tribes on the Persian side through the medium of Captain Kemball, Political Agent in Turkish Arabia, and the Rev. Mr. Badger, one of the chaplains to the force and Arabic interpreter to the Lieutenant General Commanding, that they should remain neutral in the ensuing operations; and as Sir J Gutram wrote from Hartheh, 'the success of Captain KembalPs negotiations wrth them was remarkably displayed as we steamed up to the present anchorage,' for, 'at several of the villages, the Arabs, male and female, approached the river waving their flags, and we had hardly anchored when several came on board the « Feroze,' volunteering to give us any informa- on in their power as to the numbers and disposition of the enemy.'

These batteries, though open in rear, were ^ \excellently placed for commanding the river below, opposite, and above ler al ^ the Persian position; and there were also various subsidiary works, including a small battery on the right bank of the Karun a short way 1 above the main battery on the point, while long lines of breast works extended from the left and right flanks of the main battery up the eSj and,l!

The 25th of March passed in transferring troops, guns, etc., from the larger to the smaller vessels of the fleet at Hartheh; and in the evening some hundreds of the enemy began to throw up cover for two field guns^ which they brought with them, near the anchorage; but a few shells from the e: Assaye ' drove them off. Already on the night of the 24th- S5th, an island opposite the Persian north battery, at the present day forming part of that known as Umm-al-Khasasif, was examined with a view to establishing a mortar battery on it, but was found to be too low and muddy for the purpose; consequently, on the 25th, a raft to carry two 8-inch and two 5J-inch mortars was constructed, which on the follow- K; ; ing night was moored in a channel to the west of the modern island of Ws Umm-al-Khasa if, close to the village of Zain on the Turkish shore and ^ about 1,000 yards from the Persian batteries. The service of this raft, lierie which was commanded by Captain Worgan of the Artillery and which ii ;anc was towed into position after dark by the Baghdad Political Agency ifctre steamer ' Comet,' was extremely dangerous. It was even accounted is from i a sort of forlorn hope, because, should the enemy—as was probable—dis- divert cover its presence during the night, nothing could prevent their capturing it, far removed as it was from all support; but it escaped their observation. Apparently from the location of the mortar battery at this spot, the eastern part of the island of Umm-al-Khasasif is called Umm-ar-Risas or the a Bullet Place/'' to this dav. The order of events in the attack upon Muhammareh on the 26th March is not precisely ascertainable, there being some discrepancy in the time assigned by the principal authorities to the successive British move ments. At dawn the mortar raft opened fire on both the principal Persian batteries, and an immediate and considerable effect was produced by its 8-inch shells; but those of its lighter pieces fell short. According to Sir J. Outram Captain Worgan 'engaged the enemy's batteries for some two hours before he was supported by the men of war, evincing ^n d ^ H T 8alantry ' ^ aml th0Uel1 few of the Persian guns could be brought to bear on the raft, it did not escape without inlnry and a boat attached to it was sunk.

I1695 16 ^ the ' Ajdaha/' fii'st ascended the channel on the Turkish side of the river ^ to support the raft; but, as soon as the enemy had been shaken by their 6 ^ combined fire, these vessels returned to the main river to reinforce the ^Uperooz/' ' Assaye' and Victoria/' which, the last named towing the W ! n paikland/'' next proceeded up-stream to engage the Persian batteries at short range. At about 7 a.m ., the 'Yerooz,' backed by the ' Assaye/' came into action against the Persian north battery, while the ff Semira- a ^mis/ , Victoriaand ^Falkland^ devoted their attention to the southern one and to the subsidiary battery on the northern bank of the 1 P res ®t Karun. According to an eyewitness, ' The morning being very ^ i clear, with just sufficient breeze to prevent the smoke from collecting, a Weiniljflore beautiful scene than was then presented can scarcely be imagined, raft toi The ships, with ensigns flying from every mast-head, seemed decked on the! for a holiday; ihe river glittering in the early sun-light, its dark date- isb; fringed banks contrasting most effectively with the white canvas of the iishta' Falkland,' which had loosened sails to get into closer action ; the sulky- '6 of thisi: looking batteries just visible through the grey fleecy cloud which envel- 3ry andiloped them ; and groups of brightly-dressed horsemen flitting at intervals liticalipbetween the trees where they had their encampment, formed altogether m aw a picture from which even the excitement of the heavy cannonade around prokblncould not divert the attention.'' The distance of the ships from the MrcapliPersian works was only 200 to 300 yard?, and the parapets rapidly irokrat crumbled under their fire.

In this last phase of the naval engagement the i3ritisn ^ ^ ships anchored except the a Assaye,^ which alternately steamed up to ^the (c Ferooz' and dropped down with the current, raking as she did so the Karun face of the northern batter v. t.

The Bere- nice/' carrying General Havelock, his staff, the 78th Highlanders, and some details, in all about 1,400 men, went safely by, though several times struck; but the moment of passing the Persian batteries was an anxious one for her Commander, Lieutenant Chitty, I.N., who steered the vessel himself. The landing took place, rapidly and in good order, under General Havelock at a * point on the Shatt-al-'Arab some distance above the Persian north battery, and for the most part direct from the ships^ sides to terra fir ma. Just as the disembarkation began, or perhaps earlier, the chief magazine in the enemy^s batteries exploded; and after this various smaller explosions took place in the same vicinity. The Semiramis ' entered the Karun to silence a work which still fired from one gun; and a landing party from the ^Assaye' occupied the Persian north battery, while others from the 'Semiramis,' Victoria/' Clive and Falkland ' took possession of the southern one in the face of some resistance. Owing to the rise of the tide the horse artillery and cavalry, except a troop of Sind Horse, could not immediately be set ashore; but about 1—30 or 2 p.m ., a field battery and the infantry portion of the force, after being landed and formed, advanced first through the river side date groves and then over open plain, against two entrenched camps which the enemy had pitched, one—for his cavalry and artillery a little to the north, the other—for his infantry—slightly to the west, of the town of Muhammareh. The Persians were drawn up in order of battle near the former of these camps, that which had been occupied by His Royal Highness Khanlar Mirza himself; but on the approach of the British line ; consisting from right to left of the field battery, the 78th Highlanders, a wing of the 26th Native Infantry, His Majesty's 54th Regiment, the Native Light Battalion, and the 23rd Native Infantry, they suddenly l ost heart and disappeared as if by enchantment, leaving almost every- ^ The accounts vary greatly as to the place of disembarkation, one putting it o D ly. a few hundred yards above the Persian battery, another as much as two miles above. ^ ossibly each transport went alongside where she found a good berth1697 '^bl thing behind them in their flight. Just as they evacuated the place ail enormous magazine^ that containing the whole of their reserve am- someti munition, was blown up,—whether designedly or by accident remained .al fitgi uncertain. The British force continued in pursuit of the Persians for led, aii three or four miles beyond Muhammareh in the direction of Ahwa^ witH but overtook none of them except wounded stragglers; finally they fcem bivouacked on their ground. At the close of the day a thanksgiving The'! service was held on the a Assaye ^ by the Rev. Mr. Badger and was anders, attended by Sir J. Outram and his staff^ Captain Kemball, and others, oughsef The exact loss of the Persians was difficult to ascertain, but 80 or 90 rieg ^ bodies were found unburied in their batteries and the total number of 11, their killed was estimated at 200. Among the partially wounded was andiji Sartip Agha Jan Khan, one of their most esteemed officers, who fell in l-'Aiij the north battery, and whom they carried off with them in their t part| retirement. Considerable execution was found to have been done in ation l{{ ^he Persian camps, though far distant from the river, by a fire of shell explol and grape which had from time to time been turned in their direction by the ships. Few Persian wounded were seen, but many were after- ame m ickstiif wards reported to have been murdered by Arabs while endeavouring to occupid make good their escape. The enemy abandoned 16 guns, 6 to 18-poun- 'Vicli ( ^ ers ^ which fell into the hands of the British troops, also an 8-inch in einfci brass mortar; but the mortar and some of the guns, as captured, were in an unserviceable condition. The Persians took away with them 5, or possibly 6 field guns: and the others which their batteries had been valrj, ® ,, 7 e- Ui re P con ^ am were presumed to have been thrown into the rivers ' or creeks, in the mud of which two of those taken were recovered, le 10106,1.: ^ jy Man y small arms and some quantities of ammunition, including 3,600 , rounds, for the artillery, 4,000 loose shot and shell, mostly for 9 and camps ^ -i o , ^ i^-pounders, and 14,400 lbs. of powder, were collected; and it was of tbel Ca ^ cu ^ a ^ e ^ about 144,000 lbs. of powder must have been destroyed i ttleW in ex l ) ^ os ^ ons w hich took place in the Persian lines during or after Hisl^ 18 ac ^ 0n • ^ en ^ s the number of 132 and a large amount of provi- ^ ...r s ^ ons were captured.

The action was essentially a naval one; and^ as Sir J. Outram himself observed : 'Nothing (more) was left for the army to do, after being conducted by the navy past the silenced batteries, than to land and take possession of the enemy's entrenched camp/' On the night of the 26th and morning of the 27th March, a troop of the Sind Hor e under Captain Green followed the retiring Persians to a point 11 miles beyond that reached by the infantry; but the fugitives were found to be moving at a pace which in the absence of a strong cavalry force, precluded all possibility of successful pursuit. Accord ingly on the next day, though the rest of the scanty mounted troops had in the meanwhile been landed, the British force returned to Muhammareh; the Persian entrenched camps there were occupied by it; and guards were stationed in the town to maintain order and security. By the 1st April the baggage of the whole force had been landed and tents pitched for all, which was opportune, for the weather had suddenly grown very hot. On the 29th March, under orders from Sir J. Outram who for want of transport could not at the moment undertake any far reaching operations by land, an expedition was despatched up the Karun River. The instructions to the officer in command/ Acting Commodore J. Bennie, were to push on to Ahwaz, reconnoitre the place, and, if practicable, destroy any stores or supplies which the enemy had collected there. His flotilla consisted of the armed steamer Comet ^ of the Baghdad Political Agency and the river steamers 'Planet' and ' Assyria,' each of which towed a gunboat mounting two 24-pounder howitzers and manned by European sailors. The steamers carried, distributed among them, 150 men of the 78th Highlanders and an equal number of the 64th Foot, these troops being under the command of Captain G. H. Hunt of the former regiment; and Captain Kemball, Political Agent in Turkish Arabia, accompanied the force in the capacity of political officer. ai '0$' * Commodore Young had been obliged, imiuediately after the capture of Muham- mavch to obtain leave for reasons of health ; and his place was taken by Captain Bennie of the 'Ferooz.' fti1699 The steamers anchored for the first night at Kut-al-^Abid, where 1 ^' traces of the passage of the enemy were found on the right bank of the [{ r - ver&gt; gab ''eh was reached early the next afternoon, and Isma^ili on the evening 1 of the 30 th March. At Sab''eh signs were discovered of a recent Ai p er sian bivouac, together with the wheel marks of five guns and of a ^ ^ small carriage. There were also several freshly made graves, and it was afterwards ascertained that Sartip A gha Jan Khan, mortally wounded ^ k at Muhammareh, had been buried there. At Isma^ili communication with the people of the country was opened, and from them it was learned lb, a ti that the Persian army in retreat had passed on the previous day, towing Persia one gun, of which the carriage was broken, in a boat on the river; here ie im also new graves were discovered. An early start was made on the iofastii: morning of the 31st and in the afternoon the force reached Kut-al- it. Aw 'Amaireh, where positive information was obtained of the arrival of the untedtn Persian army at Ahwaz on the day preceding. The hour was then reknei to 0 late to admit of a nearer approach being made with safety to the upieibi enemy ; s position ; but at 3 a. m . on the 1st April the flotilla got under ,nd seci wa y pressed on towards Ahwaz with the utmost despatch. Cavalry patrols of the enemy were descried bef ore long, but they did not approach very near. At length the main body of the Persian army came in view, crowning [the ridge which forms a continuation, to the whofon west of the river, of the Ahwaz hills on its eastern side. A boat was far read captured under the^left bank and was found to contain the disabled gun, KamiIi a handsome 12-pounder, which was at once hoisted on board the Cod 'Comet.-' )lacej an! _ Meanwhile information was received according to which the village ) enemj ■ 0 _ . 4:3 (( ^ oi Ahwaz was very weakly held by the enemy, while the Persian army Planet' on ^ e 0 PP 0S i^ e bank had no means of crossing the river to reinforce it; 24 p,. an ^ P^sently it was decided to attempt a coup de main. Two gunboats j were sent up the river in advance, to distract the attention of the inicrs |t) # de^s ^ ^ ers ^ ans ^7 bombarding their principal position from the shelter of an island i mrne diately below the Ahwaz rapids; and between 10 and 11 a.m ., the ■ W ^ e ^ infantry were landed on the left bank about three quarters of • the cf a ^ 0W S un ^ oa ^ s * The troops having been formed by Captain 111 Hunt in such a manner as to give them, in the then bush-grown country, the appearance of a large force, closed upon the village of Ahwaz from jture of ^ 1 ^ S ^ an ^ war d side and occupied it without resistance a little before noon. jyCap^ ^ eanw kil e Acting Commodore Eennie, with the Comet,^ had taken a position in the river from which he could both support the gunboats 117 41700 and afford help, if needed, to the land force; but none was required. The Shaikh of Ahwaz at once coming out and making his submission to Captain Hunt and Captain Kemball. At this juncture the Persian Army on the other side of the river began to retire, in tolerably good order but leaving, as usual, much of their property behind : this movement was due partly to the fire of tk gunboats, which they seemed unable to return; partly to^ their flank being turned by the occupation of Ahwaz; but most of ail, probably to a fear that the British force in sight might be only the advanced guard of one much larger. The spectacle presented by the enemy as they rapidly retreated northwards, was as interesting and impressive as the cause of it was absurd. Their infantry, which with four guns led the line of march, numbered about 6,000 men and was divided into four great masses; a small green palanquin carriage with glass windows and a mule litter such as Persian ladies use on a journey could be j distinctly seen, surrounded by a strong escort; and the rear was brought up by some 2,000 Persian and Bakhtiyari horse, whose appearance was nothing short of magnificent. The Persians had hardly quitted their lines when one of the gunboats transferred to the further bank some officers and a small party of Highlanders, by whom a small quantity of ammunition abandoned by the enemy was promptly destroyed. By ^ p.m . the Persian host had disappeared from view. In the interim the property of the Persian Government in Ahwaz village had been taken possession of by working parties : it comprised J 154 stand of new English muskets bearing the Tower mark, 56 fine [ mules in excellent condition, pack-saddles, entrenching tools, a flock of 230 sheep, and enormous quantities of flour, wheat and barley, sufficient to have provisioned the Persian host for 15 to 20 days. So much of the grain and as many of the sheep as could not be consumed or carried away in the steamers were distributed gratis to the local Arabs. During the 2nd and 3rd of April the British force remained at Ahwaz, by way of enhancing the effect of the raid and to allow of Captain KembalFs communicating with the surrounding tribes ; and on the 4th April the whole returned to Muhammareh, having achieved a great moral success over the enemy without a single casualty. British It was intended, after the occupation of Muhammareh, that Shaikh rektions with 0 f that place and Shaikh Paris of Pallahiyeh should visit Sir the Muhaism r . . . . « andKa'ab J. Outram and be formally reinstated by him in the positions or evacuatiorTof authority which they had held under the Persian Government; but a few1701 18 y days' delay was caused by the'absence of Captain Kemball with the recon- Muham- naissance to Ahwaz; and, almost simultaneously with his return, 17th May news reached the Lieutenant-General Commanding of the conclusion of 185 ^ ^ peace between Britain and Persia. The outward demeanour of the la Ul Shaikhs, who had until then been loud in their professions of attachment fire c{ aD( i good will to the British Government, at once underwent a not theiiI unnatural charge; they began to refer with alarm to their own future 11, plii position under the Persian Government, and to seek from the British he At authorities guarantees of protection which could not be granted, far ie enei exceeding as they did the provisions of the amnesty clause of the Treaty mpressi; of Peace. The Ka^ab Shaikh, it was believed, was still willing to be li four j placed in charge of Muhammareh by the British authorities, as the only divideli means open to him of supplanting his Muhaisin rival there; but Sir J. ass ii Outram, who did not feel himself justified, or see any practical advantage, ley coili in interfering to such an extent in local affairs, wrote on the 11th April: was 1)1!; Under these circumstances, I have determined not to disturb the relative possessions pearad of the two Chaab chiefs, nor to excite the ambition of the one, or test the sincerity of qttiWt|the other, by insisting upon either presenting himself in person. Should the war erknb con ^ nue ) 1 ma y count, I believe, upon the complete subserviency of both to the extent lall J ori ° inall y contemplated. And in the opposite case, it will be sufficient for me to have ^ gained our objects without hampering the Government by inconvenient guarantees, and S r0 ^ 1 also without needlessly impairing the authority, to which the Persian Government lays claim, over the country. entini The position of the Prince Governor of ; Arabistan after the British it comfi: 1 ^ .ji raid to Ahwaz, which shored him of the last remnant of his prestige, was ^ ^'J desperate and even pitiable. His troops had not enough ammunition to ' , force their way back to central Persia through the Lur and Bakhtiyari countries, which had become hostile : indeed an attempt made by His ^ Royal Highness to reach Burujird had to be abandoned on account of the attitude of the hill tribes. Imprisoned as the Prince Governor and his Persian troops thus were in the plains, it seems probable that, as Sir remaiDf J, Outram himself held, an advance by the British into Northern to al ; Arabistan might have brought about a surrender by them en masse. The re-embarkation of the British troops at Muhammareh began on jg aci the 9th May and was completed on the 17th ; when Sir J. Outram himself ty apparently left for Baghdad. On the 15th the town of Muhammareh that SI was made over to Shaikh ; Ali Khan, a nephew whom Shaikh Jabir ouldvist deputed to represent him in resuming the civil government of the place, posits A naval force was left temporarily at Muhammareh to mark its formal at;but ! retention by the British and to deter His Royal [Highness Khanlar1702 Mirza, to whom a letter was also addressed by Sir J. Outram, from attempting its military re-occupation pending fulfilment by the Persian Government of the terms of the Treaty of Peace. The operations left enduring marks and memories behind. In* 1911 ' many old trees in the Jabiriyeh lands could still be seen with the gashes in them caused by round shot, which were frequently found in the gardensand 'the loot of the Persian camp was still a popular theme amongst the greybeards of Muhammareh/'' British relations with 5 Arabistan after the Anglo-Persian 'ft ar, 1857-96. The piracy committed at Basrah in June 1872 on the British mail steamer (t Cashmere - ''' and the proceedings in Turkey to which it gave rise are described j in the chapter on the history of Turkish ; Iraq, but official action was required in 'Arabistan also, to various districts of which province some of the robbers had retired with their spoil. Immediately after the commission of tlie offence; on its becoming known that members of the gang responsible for it had taken refuge in Persia, Shaikh Jabir of Muhammareh was addressed : he replied with assurances of aid which the event proved to be sincere. The crime was' one which scandalised the public authorities both in Turkey and in Persia, and Shaikh Jabir, as a merchant and ship-owner himself, might be expected to feel special sympathy with the sufferers; but the fact that the fugitives in Persia had placed themselves under the protection of his rival and enemy the Ka^ab Shaikh, at this time Shaikh Lutf Ullah or Lufti, probably raised his enthusiasm or justice to a higher pitch than it would otherwise have attained. At the beginning of July the Naqib of Basrah and Qasim-az-Zuhair, Chalabi, President of the Mercantile Court there, whom the Turkish authorities had sent to Muhammareh to communicate with Shaikh Jabir, returned bringing two prisoners and their share of the plunder, valued at Rs. 1,485; and before the middle of the month the Chalabi had recovered, with the Shaikhs help, a further amount of Rs. 4,200. About the 3rd July 1872 the Persian Government to whom the British and Turkish Legations at Tehran had applied for assistance) * Lieutenant A. T. Wilson's Precis of the Relations, etc., 1912, page 10. t Fzrfepage 1458am, I? elegraphed to Shaikh Jabir directing him to arrest and hand over to the e h Turkish officials at Basrah such of the absconding criminals as were Turkish subjects, and to recover what he could of the plunder; hMi: and the Shaikh at once called on Prince Anushirvan Mirza, probably a relative of His Royal Highness Hamzeh Mirza, the Hashmat-ud-Dauleh, foil: p r ince Governor of ; Arabistan, and on Shaikh Lufti of Fallahiyeh, to co -operate with him in carrying out the orders. Shaikh Lufti, however, at first refused to surrender the pirates in his jurisdiction, alleging that to do so would be a breach of the obligations of Arab hospitality; and Shaikh Jabir profited by his recusancy to propose joint military oper ations by himself and the Persian authorities against Fallaliyeh, at the siail same time suggesting—a suggestion which the Turks seem to have adopted—that the Shaikh of Kuwait should be asked to take measures for preventing the escape of the offenders from IMlaliyeh by sea. British ichit| At the beginning of August 1872 Colonel Herbert, British Political Hraii Agent in Turkish Arabia, placed the Baghdad Agency steamer Comet' districti at the disposal of Mr. P. J. C. Robertson, British Agent at Basrah, oil. for use in connection with the Persian developments of the case. Almost | g immediately on the vessels arrival Mr. Robertson proceeded in her to 5^ Failiyeh, Shaikh Jabir's residence, and took delivery from him of nine replyi of the pirates, Turkish subjects, whom the Shaikh had in the meanwhile lecriJ Persuaded or intimidated the Ka'ab Chief into surrendering, and whom Mr. Robertson at once made over to the Turkish Governor of Basrah. The Persian Government shortly afterwards declared themselves tkettt responsible for dealing with those of the pirates who might prove to be protec! ; Persian subjects, and cautioned Shaikh Jabir against extraditing such to hLutfl Turkey 1 ; but whether their instructions in this respect were observed j^l seems doubtful, for those subsequently arrested were like the first nine sent to Basrah, though one of them was the slave of a leading family at 0 j Buziyeh. During the latter part of August and earlier part of September ^ get j Shaikh Lufti was absent from his head quarters, having gone to wait !)• jj, Upon and doubtless consult the Prince Governor, who was then apparently at Khurramabad; and it was currently reported that he paid him a bribe of 2-5,000 Qrans and returned home with a presentation bel^ circum stances which did not augur well for the progress of the case. |. 0 ^jjoi These manoeuvres on the part of Shaikh Lufti caused energetic [or as^ re P r esentations to be made by the British Minister at Tehran, with the result that Haji Hashim Khan, a Muhassil or Foreign Office bailiff, page was despatched to ^Arabistan by the Persian Government to aid in the1704 5&lt; proceedings. A suggestion by Colonel Herbert that a Ghulam or messenger of the British Legation should also be sent was not adopted by Mr. Thomson, the Minister, who thought that the Persian Govern ment's sense of responsibility might be weakened by his presence. Meanwhile fresh recoveries of plunder were effected by Shaikh Jabir, The movements of the Persian Muhassil were leisurely in the extreme; and it seems doubtful whether he would ever, without British supervision, hareached his destination at all. In November 1872 he was by an accident discovered at Baghdad, where he was trifling away his time, and was packed off to Basrah, arriving there on the 4th December. At once on his arrival Mr. Robertson went in the ' Comet ' to Failiyeh where he was joined by the Naqib and the Chalabi; and on the 16tli the Comet' reached Umm-at-Tamair on the Karun, carrying Mr. Robertson, the Chalabi, and the Muhassil. It was known by this time that some of the criminals whose arrest was desired were at Hawizeh, where the Prince Governor himself had arrived at tlie beginning of November and had since remained ; others at Fallahiyeli; and others at * Dar-al-Mulla, where they were protected by a certain Mir 'Abdullah. The Muhassil and a Qawwas of Mr. Robertson then proceeded to Hawizeh, where a list of the outlaws required was handed by them to the Hashmat-ud-Dauleh ; and on the 24th December the latter, with Prince Anushirvan Mirza and Shaikh Lufti, joined Mr. Robertson on board the ' Cometand were conveyed to Failiyehj which was reached on the 26th. The next day a meeting was held at which Mr. Robertson, Prince Anushirvan Mirza, the two Turkish representatives, and Shaikh Jabir were present and interrogated Shaikh Lufti, who had been ostensibly deposed from the Ka'ab Shaikhship and placed under arrest; but the Prince Governor took no proceedings pleading indisposition; and Mr. Robertson was constrained to report that, though he made many fair promises, his attitude was really obstructive. On the 3rd January 1873 the pretence of Shaikh Lufti's deposition was abandoned ; and arrangements were made by the Prince Governor for arresting the offenders still at large, partly by Shaikh Lufti's instru mentality. The Hasbmat-ud-Dauleh had now become very restless, and he frequently begged for the loan of the Comet' to carry him to Ahwaz ; Mr. Robertson, however, would not accede to his request, but » So styled throughout the correspondence ; but Dih Mulla in the Hindiyan district % Is perhaps meant which was governed a few years after this by one Amir 'Abdullah. 'iidir!1705 telegraphed instead to superior authority protesting against his being allowed to take his departure thus prematurely. Orders were accordingly sent and repeated by the Persian Government that the Prince Governor should remain on the spot until the case was finished ; but^ disregarding them, he left for Ahwaz on the 11th January in a steam launch belong ing to Shaikh Jabir. Towards the close of his stay, irritated by the pressure that was being brought to bear on him, he refused to recognise officially the Naqib and the Chalabi, whom the Governor of Easrah had duly, though not in writing, empowered to act as Turkish represent atives; and it was 'not until, after his departure that orders for their recognition were received from Tehran. The arrangements made by the Prince Governor proved, however, unexpectedly effectual. On the 16th January Ahtaib, one of the men wanted, arrived in custody at Muhammareh from Failiyah and was conveyed in the Comet' to Basrah; and on the 22nd two prisoners from Hawizeh were brought in and similarly disposed of, the Maula of Hawizeh giving a formal certificate of the death of a third whose surrender had been demanded. On the 23rd January 1873, under instructions from Colonel Herbert, Mr. Robertson started in person for Fallahiyeh. Leaving the Naqib of Basrah at Failiyeh, he proceeded with Qasim-az-Zuhair, Chalabi, in the ' Comet' to ^Ali-ibn-al-Husain on the Karun, whence the pair made their way to an encampment on the Ja'fari canal near Fallahiyeh. The Prince Governor, who had spent at Ahwaz the interval since the last proceedings in the case, encamped close by with a force of 500 or 600 men, and the Muhassil also rejoined them; but Shaikh Lufti Was absent at Dar-al-Mulla. It had now been ascertained that part of the plunder of the ' Cashmerewas in the possession of some Shaikhs of the Ka^ab. On the 3rd February Shaikh Lufti came in; and soon after an effort was made to postpone restitution by the Ka'ab Shaikhs implicated, but was frustrated by Mr. Robertson. By the 10th February Mr. Robertson ha.d succeeded in recovering a further sum of 11,947 Qrans; but his endeavours to secure the arrest of the pirates supposed to be at Dar-al-Mulla were unsuccessful, and those men were never captured. On the 22nd February Mr. Robertson and the Chalabi regained Failiyeh, and this time the former was able to report that the Prince Governor had behaved with the greatest courtesy and kindness,^ and that ' his action in supporting our claims, without admitting question as to their validity, was doing us more than justice,mmm 1708 Piracy in Khor Doraq. 1873. Alleged in trigues between the British Government and the Shaikh of Muham- mareh, 1875. and more than we looked for.' In all 20,631 Qrans were recovered on this expedition, including a sum paid in by Shaikh Jabir on behalf of Shaikh Muhammad-bin-Faris, and a deposit of 5,200 Qrans made by the Prince Governor on account of plunder which the prisoner Ahtaib, a slave, was supposed to have made over to his owners, the Halail family, Shaikhs of Buziyeh. In all the equivalent of Es. 13,430 had been recovered and 12 prisoners arrested on Persian soil, and more could not be obtained, though some of the ' Cashmere' property was unaccounted for and a few criminals remained at large. The conduct of Shaikh Jabir had been so praiseworthy throughout that the Government of India sanctioned the presentation to him in acknowledgment thereof, on Colonel Herberts recommendation, of a six-oared cutter from Bombay to cost Rs. 600 or 700; and the single gun still fired as a salute by the vessels of the British ludia Steam Navigation Company in passing the Shaikh of Muhammareh^s riverside residence commemorates the gratitude of the owners of the Cashmere ' for Haji Jabir's exertions. The ' Comet' was employed for seven months in connection with the case, and Mr. Robertson spent in all 122 days on board of her; but the energy, time, and money devoted by the British authorities to enforcing reparation in Turkey and Persia were not disproportionate to the result. The effects of their assiduity, without which substantial satisfaction would not have been obtained, were salutary and durable; and in the forty years that have since elapsed no offence against British shipping at all comparable with the ' Cashmere ' piracy has been registered in either Persian or Turkish waters. About the middle of October 1873 a small native-rigged sailing vessel under British colours was plundered in the Doraq or Buziyeh branch of Khor Musa; but strong orders for the arrest of the robbers and the recovery of the value of the articles taken were obtained from the Persian Government at Tehran. In 1875, when relations between Shaikh Jabir of Muhammareh and the Persian Central Government were somewhat disturbed, as has been mentioned before, an article by Dr. Pollak formerly physician to the Shah of Persia, appeared in the Neue Freie IPresse newspaper of Vienna, suggesting that the Shaikh was about to throw off his allegiance to the Persian Government and transfer his principality to the British, to whom it would be a valuable acquisition as affording them a line of military advance into the interior of Persia and, consequently, a means of counteracting Russian progress in Central Asia. A translation of this /1707 oft article was said to have excited anger and suspicion in tlie Shah, who in his mind probably connected the designs that it attributed to the British Government with the interest that the British authorities had for some time past been showing in projects for the establishment of steam navigation on the Karun Eiver. In 1879, when the death of Shaikh Jabir at no distant date began to appear probable, and when the rivalry between his sons Muhammad Khan and Miz^l Khan was such as to suggest the likelihood of an armed conflict between them on his demise, Mr. Robertson, the Assist ant Political Agent at Basrah, sought instructions as to the attitude which he should assume on the occurrence of the expected event. He did not propose to interfere directly between the brothers, but he thought that he might be authorised to give formal advice to Miz^al Khan^ which, he had little doubt, would result in the retirement of that Chief from the arena without a contest. The question was referred by Colonel Eoss, the Resident in the Persian Gulf, to the British Minister at Tehran ; but it does not appear whether orders on the subject were given. In April of this year a tour was made in ^Arabistan by Mr. W. S. and Lady Anne Blunt who entered the province from the Bani Lam country in Turkish 'Iraq, visited Dizful, Shushtar^ and Ramuz, and thence made their way vioi Dilam and the coast to Bushehr. Before his accession to the Shaikhdom of Muhammareh Miz'al Khan maintained very close relations with the British Assistant Political Agency at Basrah, then filled by Mr. Robertson, on whom at one period he remained in almost constant attendance. After he became Shaikh, probably for prudential reasons connected with his dependence on Persia, his intimacy with the British Agency became less marked j but in 1888 he visited Mr. Robertson at Basrah to consult him with reference to apprehended aggressions by the Amin-us-Sultan^s Govern ment, which had already taken in hand the subjection to Tehran of the Bakhtiyari country and of the Persian Coast and Islands, and which was supposed to aim at the abolition of the Muhammareh Shaikhdom also, and the appointment of a Persian Governor in Southern 'Arabistan. The following extract from a report written by Mr. Robert son at the time throws considerable light on the attitude of Shaikh Miz'al towards the British authorities, at this critical period :— Were the Persians to acquire direct authority over the Arabs of 'Arabistan and substi tute Persian Governors for the hereditary Chiefs of Mohatnmerah, our influence and practical power in these parts would be inconveniently affected. Sheikh Miz'al Khan, Attitude of the British Government towards the succession to the Shaikh- ship of Muham- mareh, 1879. Relations of Shaikh Miz'al with the British, 1881—9041708 J ike his father Haji Jabir Khan, has always placed his information and authority at the disposal of this Agency, and he would at once, if called upon, hold himself and his tribe at the orders of the British Government. While he is the Chief, the position and resources of Mohammerah are potentially under British control for the extension of commerce or other purposes, and it is possibly a knowledge of this that has at the present juncture occasioned the desire of the Persian Government to depose him. After the opening of the Karun to navigation, and the death in 1889 of his friend Mr. Robertson, Shaikh Miz^aFs relations with the British became much less friendly than they had been. The most evident causes were annoyance at the competition of a British firm with himself in the carrying trade of the Karun ; the action of the British representative at Muhammareh, who was often obliged, after the institution of a British Vice-Consulate there in 1890, to appeal to the Persian Karguzar or the Persian Governor of ^Arabistan against his proceedings; and, finally, the old fear of incurring the distrust of the Persian Government. In 1895, when disaffection towards Shaikh Miz^al became rife among his own subjects, Khaz'al Khan, whose succession to the Shaikhdom began to appear probable, assured the British V ice-Consul at Muham- mareh that he knew that 'his political salvation lay in assisting and not opposing the British/' and that, if as Shaikh he should be called on to choose a policy, it would be one of sincere friendship with the British Government, though the exigencies of politics might dictate concealment of its real nature. British official matters in 'Arabistan, 1848—96. Until near the close of the period now under consideration there was no permanent representative of the British Government, European or native, in 'Arabistan, the reason apparently being that no important British interests as yet existed in the province. In these circumstances, Muhammareh being remote from Bushehr and very near to Basrah, the British Agency at the latter place naturally became the chief medium of British superintendence and action in 'Arabistan affairs. As we have already seen it was the British Agent at Basrab who was employed in ; Arabistan in 1872-73, under the orders of the British Political Agent at Baghdad, to obtain reparation in the 'Cashmere' piracy case; and in 1878 Mr. Robertson wrote a valuable account of the province, with which circumstances had evidently made him well acquainted.1709 This geographically convenient but somewhat irregular arrangement led in 1878 ; to a conflict of jurisdiction between British political authori ties O q the assassination of the Ka'ab Shaikh Lutf Ullah in that year Colonel Nixon, the British Political Agent in Turkish 'Iraq, called on Mr. Robertson, the Assistant Political Agent at Basrah, for a full report on the occurrences, at the same time remarking that the crime called for earnest reprobation. On the correspondence reaching the Government of India, Colonel Nixon was asked by telegram to report what connection there was between the affairs of the Ka'ab tribe and British interests such as could justify his instructions to Mr. Robertson; and Colonel Ross, the Resident in the Persian Gulf, pointed out that the instructions in question implied a more decided supervision over 'Arabistan affairs than had heretofore been exercised by the Baghdad Agency. Colonel Nixon, in his reply to the Government of India, cited orders given him in the previous year to keep them informed of the assembling of Persian troops and other matters of importance in the neighbourhood of Muhammareh ; but the Government of India did not regard these as relevant, inasmuch as they bore special reference to the Russo-Turkish War. The Political Agent in Turkish 'Iraq was accordingly informed that ' the Government of India, having regard to the general inexpediency of interfering in internal disputes along the coast of the' fc Persian Gulf, which do not affect British interests and general politics, consider that the detailed enquiry which you ordered Mr. Robertson to institute into the circumstances of the murder of Sheikh Lufti was unnecessaryand it was added that r the country occupied by the Ka'ab Arabs is subject to Persia, and for all matters occurring in Persian territory the Resident in the Persian Gulf is the officer primarily responsible to the Government of India, though the Resident and the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia should co-operate in dealing with political affairs in which both officers may have a mixed interest/'' Conflict of jurisdiction between the British Political Agency in Turkish 'IrSq and the British Political Residency in the Persian Gulf, 1878. In March 1889 the British representative at Basrah informed the Resident in the Persian Gulf that there was urgent necessity for the appointment of a British political or consular officer at Muhammareh to protect the interests of British firms which, in consequence of the opening of the Karun, had engaged in trade there ; and after discussion between His Britannic Majesty's Legation at Tehran and the Bushehr Resi dency, an Assistant from the latter appears to have been deputed to Muhammareh as a temporary measure. It was then proposed by Colonel Ross, the Resident, that the British Consul at Basrah should Appointment of a British Vice-Consul at Muham- mareh, 1890.1710 Britisli Vice- Consulate building at Muham- mareh, 1891-1892. Britisli postal sub sidy for the ICartin and British post office at Muham- mareh, 1889-1896. be appointed Vice-ConsuLalso for Muhammareh, an addition being made to his salary^and a steam launch provided for his use; but the Govern ment of India declined to consider any proposal involving an increased charge on the Indian revenues. In the end Her Majesty^s Government decided that a British Vice-Consulate was required at Muhammareh; and on the 14th June 1890 Mr. W. McDouall, till then a clerk on the staff of the Indo-European Telegraph Department in the Persian Gulf, who had a good knowledge of Persian and a sufficient knowledge of Arabic, was appointed to the new post. He was placed under the superintendence of the British Resident at Bushehr, whose commission as Consul-General was at the same time modified so as to include 'Arabistan. The Vice-Consul's legal jurisdiction was to be exercised, however, under the Persia Order in Council, 1889, not under that of the same year applying to the Persian Coast and Islands. There was at first|some difficulty in regard to the provision of a suitable Vice-Consulate building at Muhammareh; but ultimately Shaikh Miz'al undertook, by an agreement signed in 1891^ to erect a house in accordance with plans furnished by Mr. McDouall, and to lease it to him on certain conditions. On the 26th July 1892, about the time that the building was finished and occupied, a regular lease for ten years was executed;; ^but the Shaikh's copy of this later document mav have been lost, for his successor Shaikh Khaz'al always refers to the construction agreement of 1891 as the paper governing the tenancy. This agreement, regarded as authoritative by the Shaikh, is more favourable to the interests of the British Government, as containing no time limit, than the subsequent lease. In 1889 Messrs. Lynch Brothers, who had recently inaugurated British Steam Navigation on the Karun, applied to the British Govern- ment for a postal subsidy on the ground that their service on the Karun was being maintained at a loss, and that they alreadv carried 300 to 400 postal covers and parcels on every voyage. The Government oflnia, on being consulted by Her Majesty's Government, expressed unwillingness to grant a postal subsidy to an enterprise that did not benefit the Indian Post Office, hut signified that they were prepared to contribute a sum not exceeding £1,000 a year, for five years, if the maintenance of the service was considered desirable for political reasons by Her Majesty s Government. Eventually it was arranged to make Messrs. Lynch an aHowance of £3,000 a y earfor two veara , apparently # ^eutenant A. T. '1711 ff ith retrospectire effect from 1889, and an allowance of £2,000 a year for the three years following, rather by way of assistance to a struggling British enterprise than as a postal subsidy proper; and the cost of the arrangement was divided equally between the Home and the Indian Treasuries. In 189^ the British India Steam Navigation Company and other British lines having made Muhammareh a port of call^ a British Indian post office was instituted there; but it was the only one in 'Arabistan, and its creation did not therefore introduce any new consideration with reference to the carriage of mails upon the Karun. In 1894 Messrs. Lynch, who on the Kamn still continued to work at a loss, and whose subsidy (as the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Naviga tion Company) for the carriage of the British mails between Basrah and Baghdad was reduced in that year from Rs. 36,000 to Rs.24,000 per annum requested a renewal of the Karun subsidy for another five years; and the Government of India suggested that their continuing to contribute half of the Karun subsidy should be made conditional on Her Majesty's Government's assuming liability for half of the Tigris subsidy paid to the same Company, the cost of which had hitherto fallen entirely on India. Her Majesty's Government, however, declined to contribute to the Tigris subsidy ; and the Government of India consequently stated that they were not disposed to find any part of the Karun subsidy, the objects of which appeared to be Imperial and not Indian. Ultimately, as Messrs. Lynch represented that the non-continuance of the subsidy would entail their withdrawal from the navigation of the Karun, the grant of £2,000 a year was renewed to them for 5 years at the joint expense of Her Majesty's Government and the Government of India, the latter paying provisionally half of the whole cost on the understanding that the question of the permanent division of the Tigris and Karun subsidies between the Home Government and themselves should be referred to a Royal Commission which was then dealing with the financial relations of Britain and India. Navigation schemes and enterprises in 'Arabistan, 1871—96. The greatest of all the changes that took place in Arabistan under Kasir-ud-Din Shah was the introduction o£ steam navigation on the1712 Messrs. Gray, Paul, and Co/s proposals, 1871—75, Karun. The navigability of the river' hy steam vessels had been demonstrated in the reign of Muhammad Shah^ but the question of turning it to account was not seriously discussed until thirty years later, and more than half a century elapsed between the first ascent of a steam vessel to Ahwaz and the establishment of regular steam communication on the river. As will become apparent further on, the navigation of the Karun was not an end in itself, but was regarded by British merchants and the British Government, to whom its inception was due, as a step towards making the markets of central and northern Persia easily accessible to British trade from the Persian Gulf. The same idea was the parent of various schemes for road or railway communication between the limit of navigation on the Karun and the north of Persia, which will be mentioned in their place; and its development was stimulated by the great activity of Russia, that threatened shortly to place British trade at a disadvantage throughout the greater part of Persia. The earliest practical suggestions for steam navigation on the Karun seem to have emanated from the British firm of Messrs. Gray, Paul, and Co. at Bushehr, who in July 1871 addressed Colonel Pelly, the Resident in the Persian Gulf, on the subject. The substance of these was that the Persian Government might be induced to sanction and subsidise the running of steamers which the firm were prepared, under suitable condi tions, to place on the Karun between Muhammerah and Shushtar. This early scheme, with which a railway project was associated, was recom mended by Colonel Pelly to His Britannic Majesty's Minister at Tehran and to the Government of India; but it did not secure the favourable attention of either. Sir C. Alison remarking that the time was unpropi- tious on account of the famine then prevailing in Persia, for coping with which all the resources of the Persian Government were required. As Messrs. Gray. Paul, and Co. were the agents in the Persian Gulf of the British India S. N. Co., it may perhaps be inferred that the initia tive really belonged to that great shipping association. In June 1873 the question of Karun navigation was raised again bj a member of the same British firm, in combination with proposals for road construction ; but again without result. Two years later, however, British official opinion, influenced by Russian movements in the direction of Merv, began to veer towards action in southern Persia; and Lord Northbrook, then Governor-General of India, wrote m an official minute:— I should be disposed to encourage and support any substantial proposal for opening out commu nications between the Persian Gulf and the interior of Persia. This1713 118 would not only increase the trade between India and Persia, but also strengthen our military position, if we are ever called upon to advance into the interior of Persia.' Consequently, when in 1875, after personally inspecting the route between Isfahan and Shushtar, which he recommended as suitable for a road, Mr. Mackenzie of Messrs. Gray, Paul, and Co. submitted fresh proposals for the navigation of the Karun through the Resident at Bushehr, the Government of India took them into sympathetic consideration. In 1874 a small steamer, owned apparently by the Shaikh of Muhammerah, who was anxious that the channel of the Karun should be improved by the Persian Government, was plying on the lower part of the Karun and carrying a small local traffic, but at a loss. In November 1875 the Euphrates and Tigris S. N. Co., practically identical with Messrs. Lynch, having become aware of Messrs. Gray, Paul, and Co/s plans, addressed Her Majesty^s Government requesting that, if a concession for the navigation of the Karun were obtained from the Persian Government, their own past services to British trade in Turkish ■'Iraq and Persia might be recognised by their being allowed to tender for any mail service of which the establishment on that river was contemplated. The firm also requested the Government of India to support their claims to consideration in the matter. At the end of 1875 the Government of India, who now attached considerable importance to the Karun project, proposed that, in event of its reaching the stage of action, some subsidy might be granted to Messrs. Gray, Paul, &amp; Co. or to Messrs. Lynch from Indian revenues to enable them to carry it into execution; and about the same time Mr. Mackenzie, on behalf of the former firm, approached His Majesty the Shah with a suggestion that Messrs. Gray, Paul &amp; Co., should be allowed to place steamers on the Karun and run them without any subsidy from the Persian Government. His proposals at first found favour, and a council composed of Princes, Ministers, and ether high officials recommended that the navigation of the Karun should be thrown open to the world,—a result apparently acquiesced in by who perhaps did not consider a monopoly essential to Action of Messrs, Lynch, and Co., 1875. M odified proposals of Messrs. Gray, Paul; and Co., and unsuccessful support of them by the British Government, 1875-77. Mr. Mackenzie, the success of the enterprise. The matter appeared to be settled, when, unexpectedly, it was announced by the Persian Government that river, . 1882, however, Messrs. Gray, Paul, &amp; Co. did not consider that they could a engage in navigation on the Karun unless they were granted exclusive rights or 0 years. This may account for their placing no steamer on the river when it was ' erwards opened to general navigation.1714 navigation, and port dues, such as were realised in Europe, would be claimed by them on the Karun; and in consequence of this requirement, to which Mr. Mackenzie did not think it proper to submit, as no con veniences would be provided by the Persian Government, the negotiations abruptly came to a standstill. Her Majesty^s Government, the Government o£ India, and the British representative at Tehran, Mr. Thomson, were now in complete accord as to the great desirability of the Karun route being opened to British trade ; but the last named did not consider the time suitable for pressing the matter. In November 1876, under instructions from London, he reminded the Persian Government of their acceptance of the principle of free navigation on the Karun; but, though he frequently returned to the subject, he could not induce them to take any action. In August 1877 the British firm chiefly interested again sought the aid of Her Majesty^s Government in pushing their scheme; the opportu nity seemed favourable, for war between Russia and Turkey had to a great extent closed communications in the north and trade showed a southward tendency; and Mr. Thomson was directed to make fresh representations at Tehran. He did so, but with unto ward results. The reply of the Persian Minister of Foreign Affairs was adverse and put an end to all discussion for the time, being couched in the following terms; ' In reply, I beg to state most respectfully that the Persian Ministers always feel thankful for the sincere friendship and interest shown by the British Government, and are at all times anxious to respect and carry out, as far as possible, the representations made by the legation. But as regards the Karun river and its navigation by steamers, in consideration of political obstacles at present existing, to specify which is unnecessary, they beg to be completely excused for the present, and regret their inability to carry out this undertaking at the present moment.^ Mr. Thomson, however, neglected none of the opportunities which discussions concerning proposed concessions to other foreign nations in Persia afforded for impressing on the Persian Government the advant ages to themselves of the Karun scheme. He pointed out that it would give the country direct communication with the outer world vid the Persian Gulf and the open sea, and that this would be safer than a railway system the connection of which with Europe Russia was in a position to interrupt; and at length some effect seemed to have been produced on the mind of the Shah, who in August 1878 professed to1715 j Vfo|| jjave arrangements in view for the navigation of the Karun among qtili'eitf; 0 ther matters. Very soon, however, the attitude of the Shah to the a s^ British proposals again became hostile; and it was at last discovered, or l Wi rather conjectured, that the cause of all his hesitation was a fear lest, if the value of Muhammareh as a port should be greatly increased, the anil; temptation to annex it might become irresistible to the British Govern^ Ucoinji ment. At length, in January 1879, His Persian Majesty^s irritation at opj the perseverance of the British Legation exploded in a letter which he suiyj wr ote to his Minister for Foreign Affairs, with ill-considered instructions iim fc that it should be read to Mr. Thomson : it bore ' that the insistence of ianceoit; Her Majesty's Government with reference to the Karun aroused his ) frepj suspicions; that Persia was not a dependent but an independent power; action, that^ if his consent was requested in the matter, he declined to give it; i sougltt an ^ ^ force was contemplated, that was another thing.^ The ieoppii communication was afterwards retracted; but the Karun remained y had I c ^ ose ^ navigation by foreigners. .dett; Minister for Foreign Affairs promised the Benewed make te Br ^ ish representative at Tehran that, if only the British Government negSkns, jsults.! wou ^ use i n fl uenc e procure the removal from the frontier of the 1881 ' 83 * erseani Kurdish chief J Obaid Ulleh, a Turkish subject, who was threatening le Mom ^ ers ^ an territory, the Persian Government would on their part open the ithePel p™ to foreign navigation and even connect Shushtar by a road with and iit® Tehran. The desired representations were accordingly made by His esaiixii ' Britannic ^ a j es ty's Ambassador at Constantinople; but, possibly in madetjf C0Ilse q u ence of an impression at Tehran that the deportation of the ivigatlcn turbulent was ^ 111016 to Russian than to British influence, t mk ^ Tll0ms011 ^ wlien ^ verted to the question of the Karun, met only . . with evasions. ,used ton takW Meanwhile the Zill-us-Sultan, son of the Shah, had been appointed Governor-General of 'Arabisfcan in 1880 and of Fars in 1881,^in addition to other provinces and had established friendly relations with Colonel Ross, the British Resident at Bushehr; and at the beginning of 1882, gn nati® the question of the Karun having been referred to him by his royal the a father for an opinion, he undertook to obtain permission for navigation that i* of the river by British vessels, provided that a British decoration were world^ promised him. A Persian engineer whom he employed reported, safer t } however, in July 1882, that the admission of foreign ships to the Karun l8g ia# would be a military danger, recommending at the same]time that the tol#e Persian Government should place steamers of its own on the river; and professe t e Zill-us-Sultan's influence, if it were really exerted, proved unequal to 118 A1718 Persian regulations for the navigation of the Kartin, 1888 would be constructed by the Persian Government to facilitate tranship ment between the lower and the upper river 5 the exclusive right of navi gation on the latter of these being at the same time reserved to the Persian Government. The whole transaction was to be treated as secret until a notification opening the river should have appeared in the Tehran Gazette. The promised notification^ it would seem^ was published without any undue delay and embodied the Persian regulations for the navigation of the Karun, which were conceived as follows :— Karun Biver Regulations, *The Persian Government in order to facilitate commerce, increase the wealth of the country and render her lands profitable, has opened the river Karun, subject to the following regulations, and has allowed the navigation from Muhammareh to Almz by the merchantile marine of all nations. The vessels navigating the Karun will carry out the regulations of the Government, which regulations shall hold good for ten years without fail after which they will be modified according to the exigencies of circumstances. (1) The commercial steamers of merchants of friendly Governments must not remain at the landing places or in the river longer than necessary for the purpose of loading, unloading and provisioning themselves for the journey. (2) Persons whose presence is detrimental to order and who would cause difficulties by their presence should not be taken on board the vessels, whoever comes should be provided with a passport from his own Government otherwise if any one arrives without a passport it is impossible to understand what his business may be. (3) TJuder no pretext whatsoever will any vessel have the right protect any Persian subject in any way. (4) The transport of arms is absolutely prohibited and if this rule is disregarded the same will be seized, (5) No explosive goods whatsoever shall be transported. *rhis translation of the Karun Regulations is taken from Lieutenant A. T. Wilson's Precis of the Relations&gt; etc. t 1912, pages 90-91, where the author has subjoined to it the following notes ; t N ote 1. —Above translation was received on 27th October 1890 at Her Majesty's Vice-Consulate, Muhammareh, from Residency, Bushire.

Nothing has ever followed from these protests, and the question never seems to have been taken up by the Persian Foreign Office in Tehran. But as it is not to our interest to admit the right of foreign warships to anchor in the Karun below Muhammareh, no steps have been taken in recent years to assert such a right.

On the 18th September 1888 the British representative addressed a 1888 * merofi iwaz ijji Ration Mi ^ Decti npaniel ig nortk 1 Mi pemngif note to the Shah^s Government, referring to previous encouraging assurances, pointing out that Persia was as yet practically closed to the trade of the world and that her northern communications with places abroad were commanded by a single foreign power, and explaining that the British Government claimed no exclusive privileges but only gave well meant advice to Persia, whose integrity and independence they had guaranteed; the note concluded: ' Her Majesty's Government there fore, as the friends and allies of Persia, have instructed me to enquire when they may expect that the assurances and promises given may be carried into effect, and they trust that the official answer they receive may be in full accordance with those feelings of friendship and cordial understanding between the two countries which it is the desire of Her Majesty's Government to consolidate and maintain/'' It was found that the Shah was now disposed to throw the river open .softk to general trade and saw only two difficulties in the way : the first was a inthei promise that he had given in 1887 not to permit the construction of any ifteral railway or waterway in Persia by a foreign company without first con- ;buttle: suiting the Emperor of Russia ; the second, a fear that foreign Govern- eforw ments might erect forts on the Karun or make use of the river for military purposes. The first of these was removed by the argument that the opening of the Karun was a national measure, not a concession to any foreign company; the other by pointing out that theft ^ )ers ^ an Government had it in their power to prohibit by regulations [ \ (&gt;y tlie er ? ctl0n of fortSj tlie importation of arms, and other dangerous ^ operations by foreigners. f^Di P tlie Shah, decided to accede to the wishes of the British e ^ overnment on condition of receiving two steamers as a gift, besides fc e 1 ftome assurance of protection against Eussia in case the opening of the S ^ 0U ^ resen ^ e d by that power.

In December 1888, in order to determine the value of the Bahman* shir as a water way, in connection wich the opening of the Karun^ that stream was explored to a distance of 20 miles from the sea bj the Bushehr Eesidency steamer R.I.M.S. Lawrence j'' and Captain Butterworth afterwards descended it throughout its length, taking sound ings by the way. The results of this examination were to show that it was impracticable in its actual state, as a passage for ocean steamers. On the 30th October 1888, immediately on the receipt of telegraphic information that navigation on the Karun below Ahwaz had been declared free, the steam launch ' Arab ^ belonging to Messrs. Grey Mackenzie, &amp; Co., the Basrah house of Messrs. Grey, Paul, &amp; Co., was despatched from Basrah to the Karun as a pioneer and to establish the right of way; but, as she drew five feet of water and the river was then at its lowest, she was immediately followed by the ' Bloss^ Lynch,^ a large side paddle steamer owned by the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Naviga tion Company, of which the draft was three feet. The Shaikh of Muhammerah not having as yet received any orders from the Persian Government to permit foreign vessels to enter the Karun, though the issue of such had been promised at Tehran, it was arranged in order not to compromise him that both these vessels should pass Muhammareh at night, and that their Captains should report to the Nizam-us-Saltaneh ; Governor of ; Arabistan, the fact of their having done so. Fortnightly runs between Muhammareh and Ahwaz were made for some months by the fC Blosse Lynch/' after which, being found too long and too deep for a river so full of sharp bends and in some seasons so shallow as the Karun, she was replaced by the ' Shushan,' a stern- wheeler 100 feet in length and of 2i feet draft with three rudders, built originally for the Nile Expedition; but again in 1890, the « Sushan having been removed to the upper river, the maintenance of Messrs. Lynches service on the lower Karun once more devolved for a time on the - Blosse Lynch.- In July 1891, a launch towing a barge was substituted, but was replaced in 1892, by the Malamir/' a vessel of the same type as the 'Blosse Lynch ' but not so large. The Bombay and Persia Steam Navigation Company, experimented on the Karun for a wble with a small steamer, the ' Iran but the return obtained was inadequate and they shortly withdrew her, leaving Messrs. Lynch the only British firm in the field, with none, but Persian rivals. ^(6) Shipowners shall not erect any buildings whatsoever, such as coal depots, ware- nses, shops, caravanserais or manufactories, etc., on the banks of the river.

Lynch had to obtain facilities from ^ the Persian authorities for the transfer of their cargoes between Ahwaz 1889—91. and Shushtar in native sailing boats under Persian management. To fulfil the conditions made by the Shah in opening the river it was at first arranged, in November 1888, that he should be presented with a pair of steam vessels worth about £10,000 each, of which one should be paid for by Messrs. Lynch and the other by the British and Indian Governments in equal shares. In December 1889, it was decided that the (t Shushan/'' then working on the lower river, should be offered to the Shah on the part of Messrs. Lynch; but contentious matters connected with the navigation oO the river had begun to crop up, and the opportunity was utilised to settle some of these. At length in February 1890 His Majesty was graciously pleased to accept the ' Shushan ^ for ' the transport of passengers and merchandise between Ahwaz and Shushtar and Dizful,^ an assurance in writing being at the same time given by his principal Minister, the Amm-us-Sultan, to Sir H. Drummond Wolff that she should a work continuously and in con^* nection with the steamers ' of Messrs. Lynch, ' unless prevented by extraordinary celestial events '; while verbal promises were given by the Persian to the British Minister that the representatives of Messrs. Lynch should be consulted in the appointment of the ' Shushan^s ' Captain and Engineer; that her hours of sailing and the rates of freight on cargo carried by her should be decided by arrangement between them and the Persian authorities; and, finally, that the Persian customs duty on goods should be collected at Muhammareh, Ahwaz, or Shushtar according to their destination. These points having been settled, the ' Shushan' was taken over the Ahwaz rapids on the spring rise of 1890 and handed over to the Persian authorities. In 1891 the ' Susa ' and the ' Shushan J&gt; wing were both in use between Ahwaz and Shushtar, the former on the ^ a Gargar, the latter on the Shatait. The second vessel promised to the Shah was not in the end given; possibly it had been shown that there . was not work for a third ship, expert tt 4* a i. i •'bit u fortunately the Karun Regulations were applied in a spirit even initial her le 3( m]:e ^ ai1 * n wtucb they had been drafted, the interpreta^ difficulties | in |p ^ 0DS P^ ace( ^ U P Q ^ them by the local Persian authorities, especially the Lynch and The' Susa ' was of 36 tons and originally carried guns; she was not built for trade.Company, Karguzars at Muhammareh and Nasiri (Ahwaz); being perversely stringent and even unreasonable. At first an impression seemed to prevail in the Persian official mind that by means of the Eegulations the general treaty rights of British subjects in Persia had been abrogated in ^Arabistan, which as regards treatment of foreigners was to be considered an exceptional province. Other circumstances for which they were not responsible combined to make Messrs. Lynch unpopular and so to aggravate the difficulties of their position j the Arab Shaikhs and tribesmen looked on them with disfavour as the cause of more Persian officials having been imported into the country; the native merchants and caravan men disliked them as competitors in business and their obduracy in the principle of not paying bribes was bitterly resented by the Persian authorities whose chief duty was to supervise their proceedings. The first difficulty of the firm arose from the articles in the Regula tions (Nos. 6, 7 and 8) which debarred shipowners from erecting build ings, etc., on their own account and made them dependent for accom modation on the Persian Government or Persian merchants. Under these articles they were frustrated in their endeavours to obtain land on which to construct wharves, warehouses and offices at Muhammareh and Nasiri j and His Britannic Majesty^s Minister thought it inexpedient to intervene onl their behalf, possibly because—as will appear elsewhere in the history of the Persian Coast and Islands—the question of the business premises of foreigners in Persia was already a vexed question of treaty right; and Messrs. Lynch were obliged to make the best arrangements they could with the rapacious individuals, or the equally rapacious Government at whose mercy they found them selves. At Nasiri, where a concession for providing them with accom^ modation had been granted to the Mu^in-ut-Tujjar, a rich merchant of Bushehr and a friend of the Nizam-us-Saltaneh, the negotiations conti nued without success during three years, the firm in the meantime occupying a mat shed for which they paid the exorbitant rent of 600 Tumans or about £170 a year,—the rent of the, as yet non-existent ; building; and it was only in 1894 that they at last obtained a'^ lease for a building which they were themselves to erect on account of the Persian Government, and for which they were to pay rent at the fate of 15 per cent, a year on the total cost of construction. At Shalaili, the landing place for Shushtar, they were unable to secure premises of ♦ Lieutenant A. T. Wilson's JPrects of the Belatwns, etc., pages 81-82.1723 any sort for storing cargo; and there the most elementary facilities for ^ loading and unloading goods were denied them. The employes of Messrs. Lynch at Nasiri and Shushtar were at \ first subjected to every kind of harassment and vexation. Aspersions ,rSl were made on the moral character of Mr. J. C. Gaskin, their Nasiri i agents the chief foundation of which was that he sometimes wore ^ native costume; and, when he wished to engage a private servant in !m , addition to a Christian cook that he had brought with him, the Persian ^ authorities insisted on appointing the man themselves, employed him /. on their own business also, and mulcted him of part of his salary. The result of these tactics was that Mr. Gaskin could not keep a local man in his service ,* and the only pretext of the Persian officials for their interference was the article in the Regulations (No. 15) which provided that porters for working the cargo of vessels must be supplied by the Persian Government. The Karguzar even went so far as to protest against Mr. Gaskin's employment at Nasiri at all, on the ground of his being a European; even the Regulations affording no warrant for an objection of such a nature, he subsequently fell back upon the article {No. referring to persons whose presence was detrimental to order.*' Mr. Gaskin was firmly sustained by his employers, who felt that to remove him would be to lower British prestige and to encourage the Persians in obstructive action; his character was vindicated by Colonel Ross, the Resident in the Persian Gulf; no notice was taken by the , Nizam-us-Saltaneh, the Persian Governor of ^Arabistan, of the charges 16 . j. a gainst him ,• and after a time the trouble subsided, us mdivp found if Messrs.

Lynch contended that this charge should cover the round voyage from Muhammareh to ages 80 back. It was decided to refer the point to Tehran; and11U mean while Messrs. Lynch offered to give a bond for payment in full of the Persian claim in case His Majesty the Shah^ on his return from Europe, should decide in favour of the Karguzar j but such a bond the Karguzar refused to accept. At length a compromise was arranged at the capital whereby vessels ascending the river in cargo were to pay one Qran per ton register and unladen vessels half that amount, while vessels descending were to be liable to a charge of one Qran per ton of actual cargo only. The question of the actual tonnage of the ' Blosse Lynch' gave rise to disagreeable discussions. The Karguzar of Muhammareh demanded the production of the builders^ original certificate of tonnage and Messrs. Lynch at first stated that it was in their head office in. London, but afterwards informed the Karguzar that it was lost. A certificate of tonnage verified by a British consular authority was then furnished by them, but was rejected by the Karguzar until orders for its acceptance had been obtained from the Persian Government at Tehran. It was long before the local Persian authorities could be induced to act in accordance with the arrangement, sanctioned at Tehran early in 1890, under which customs duty on cargo consigned to Ahwaz and Shushtar was to be collected at those places instead of Muhammareh. This was an important privilege, as in its absence merchandize for up country was opened for examination at Muhammareh, which entailed loss and damage, besides extra charges to importers. The inconvenience of being unable to obtain direct bills of lading for Ahwaz and Shushtar was greatly felt by merchants, and they had also to pay transit dues on the river for goods on which they had already paid customs duty at Muhammareh. In June 1891, for this last reason goods for Shushtar were still generally conveyed to Shushtar by land but, in the October following, transhipment in bond from ocean to river steamers at Muhammareh was begun, removing the difficulties as regards imported goods. The Shushan 3&gt; on the upper river though presented to the Shah; was also the cause of considerable unpleasantness. The Persian Govern ment objected to a proposal by Messrs. Lynch, who under agreement had a voice in the matter, that, on account of the risks of navigation above Ahwaz, her captain and engineer should be Europeans on salaries amount ing to about 500 Qrans a month : these salaries were payable by the Persian Government. It was then arranged that the vessel should be1725 entirely managed by Messrs. Lynch for three months upon the Shah^s account; but, as the result of her running was a deficit, the Persian Govern ment, which declined to make it good, left her permanently in Messrs. Lynches hands; and Messrs. Lynch seem to have considered the loss thus imposed on them a lesser evil than that all the steamers on the upper river should be under Persian management. The deficit of the ' Shushan ^ thus falling entirely upon Messrs. Lynch, the Persian authorities (or concessionaires representing them) proceeded to run the a Susa^ the other vessel above Ahwaz, in opposition to her ; and in June 1891, though the &lt;( Shushan ' had been accepted by the Shah expressly for the carriage of passengers and goods to Dizful as well as to Shushtar, the Governor of ; Arabistan protested against her being sent to the Diz, where the ' Susa ' had already gone: in the following August, however, the objection was withdrawn. In January 1892 Colonel Talbot, the Eesident in the Persian Gulf, visited Nasiri, was well received by the Shahab-ul-Mulk, and, in company with Mr. Dicey, Messrs. Lynches Agent at Basrah, and Messrs. Gaskin and Holland, their Agents at Nasiri and Shushtar, ascended the Diz as far as the Shushan ' could take them, but the impression which he formed of the capabilities of the river was unfavour able, In May 1892 the Shushan ^ was sent to Basrah for repairs; and the lowness of the river, after these had been executed, prevented her passing the Ahwaz rapids again until the month of December following. Messrs. Lynch applied for leave to substitute, during this interval, a steam launch and barge on the upper river; but the request was refused. In March 1893 the British Resident in the Persian Gulf, with his First Assistant, was able again to test the navigability of the Diz in the a Shushan.' Colonel Talbot on this occasion almost reached Kut Abdush Shah, the highest point ever attained by a steam vessel; but a sudden fall of the river obliged him to beat a hasty retreat and satisfied him as to the inutility of the Diz as a commercial highway. The towing of barges was also another subject of controversy. After permission for the use of two barges had been given by the Persian Government, the Karguzar of Muhammareh argued that only wooden boats were included in the term barge (' dubah '), and tried to prevent the mooring at Muhammareh of an iron barge which Messrs. Lynch tad had especially built for use on the upper Karun. Instructions from Tehran were required to -convince him of his error. It even happened, though perhaps at a later date, that the article in the Regulations (No. 19) prohibiting interference with the depth, course,1726 Demonstra tion against Messrs. Lynch* s agent at Shushtar, 1893. Assault by Persian soldiers on Messrs. Lynch's tives at Nasiri, 1895. The Persian Nasiri Com pany, 1887— 96. and bed of the river, was invoked to prevent the removal therefrom of natural obstacles to navigation. In July 1893, at the height of the Shi'ah Muharram celebrations, a fanatical demonstration was made by a crowd of 3,000 persons against the residence of Messrs. Lynch's agent at Shushtar, whose life even was threatened. Providentially the Persian Governor of 'Arabistan received information of it in time to avert a catastrophe by sending an armed force which dispersed the mob. An enquiry into the circum stances was held by Her Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consul from Muhammareh, and the result was to discredit certain charges against the agent which the promoters of the riot had invented in palliation of their conduct; indeed, a written disclaimer of all cause of complaint against Messrs. Lynch's agent was furnished by the Persian Deputy Governor of Shushtar. In March 1894 the Resident in the Persian Gulf, Colonel Wilson, made a tour to Nasiri and Shushtar. In November 1895, the lawless proceedings of Persian soldiers having occasioned a fracas on board Messrs. Lynches steamer at Nasiri, the firm's local representatives proceeded to the residence of the Deputy Governor to lodge a complaint. Upon this the Persian Military garrison at Nasiri, who were noted at the time as a violent and disorderly body, rushed to arms including some of those actually on duty at the Deputy Governor's house, and savagely assaulted the gentlemen, causing them serious injuries. A show was made by the Persian authorities of punishing the soldiers concerned in the affair on the steamer ; but tbose implicated in the assault were allowed to escape altogether, and eight months passed before compensation was paid to the sufferers. In'! 887, before the opening of the Karun navigation, it was proposed with the countenance of the Amin-us-Sultan, the most powerful Persian Minister of the day, to form a Persian syndicate headed by the Malik- ut-Tujjar for the exploitation of a monopoly of trade on the Karun which the Persian Government would grant them. The Malik-ut-Tujjar, though a Persian, was bom in British India; he professed willingness to admit British capital to the enterprise ; and the scheme seems to have been welcomed by the British firm, Messrs. Gray, Paul, and Company of Bushehr as preferable to the continued virtual closure of the river. At the end of 1888, after the lower river had been thrown open to general traffic, a special^ concession and monopoly were given by the Shah * See Lieutenant A. T. Wilson's Precis of the 'Relations^ pages 91—93.1727 5l to a Persian syndicate^ styled the Nasiri Company, of which the most prominent members were the Malik-ut-Tujjar (Haji Muhammad Mehdi, 110lls )i Mo^tamad-us-Sultan) and the Mu^in-ut-Tujjar (Haji Agha Muhammad, a w ealthy merchant of Bushehr). The Company were invested with 3 exclusive rights of navigation on the Karun and its branches above Aliwaz, an exception being made in favour of the Shah^s steamer ai ^s usa ^ the privilege of providing accommodation for Messrs. Lynch J* Muhammareh* and Shushtar was assigned to them ; they were to alfr® construct a quay, caravanserais, and shops at Nasiri, where they were a gaiiisl permitted to levy landing dues except from pilgrims ; a cart or tramway hen lit g er vice for the passage of the Ahwaz rapids was to be organised by them, mplail f or f^e US e of which they were authorised to demand payment according to a fixed scale; and various other advantages were conferred and duties imposed on them by the terms of the concession, which was declared in- W'l r ^ ^ ■ capable of being transferred to foreigners. Behind the Nasiri Company, thus established, stood the Amin-us- g u itan ; and the Nizam-us-Sultaneh, Governor of the province; and. Shaikh isiii,! Khan of Muhammareh having been drawn into the concern, his ^ great influeuce was utilised—though secretly—to obstruct Messrs. Lvnch. Milk was j one deflecting business from them by order ; by manipu- lating the customs of Muhammareh, of which the Shaikh was the farmer, jlI % 81 so as to favour clients of the Nasiri Company ; by deterring labourers .ted 4 f roni wor iji n g f or Messrs. Lynch; by catting off supplies from their ^ employes; and generally, by penalising relations of any sort with them affair® on the part of natives of the country. The result in 1891-93 was that ioescf while Messrs. Lynch obtained most of the passenger traffic, the Persian lid to I steamers carried about four-fifths of the cargo, though their freights were much higher. propi Though under their concession they were required to maintain at 1 Persii least two vessels on the upper river, it is not clear that the Nasiri 16Ml Company always—or ever—did so; but by 1891 they owned in all unrfi three steamers of which at least one, a the Nasiri63 feet long, towing it-Tf 1 3 barges, ran on tbe lower Karun in competition with Messrs.

Ope 11 ' t In December 1890 it was found necessary to urge the Persian Government to • ex P e ^ te the construction of this tramway and His Britannic Majesty's Minister at Telirln obtained a formal assurance from the Shah that it would not btf longer deferred.1728 tramway. The charges on the tramway were kept within bounds only by the competition of mule carriage, a factor which the Persian autho' rities at one time tried to eliminate by intimidation of the muleteers, Caravanserais and bazaars were duly built at Nasiri by the Company. In May 1893 the Nasiri Company announced that they had opened the Diz river to traffic and had placed on it the ee Susa which was now worked by them. This vessel made several trips on the Diz, but on one occasion had great difficulty in returning, being nearly wrecked below Kut Bandar, and leaving behind a barge which she had in tow. There was also a hitch as to customs facilities by this route, and the service ceased. In this year the Company^, or perhaps more correctly the Shaikh of Muhammareh^s, operations on the lower Karun were dis continued, and Messrs. Lynch were left for a time in sole possession of the lower river. In 1895 a new Persian Company, known as the Shahanshahi, was formed by the Shaikh of Muhammareh and some Shushtar merchants for the carrying trade of the Karun, and almost at once recaptured from Messrs. Lynch the bulk of the local shipping trade to Nasiri and of the through trade to Shushtar. Embargoes Arbitrary and useless embargoes on the exportation of food stuffs on the export . . i . . 0 r of grain from from Arabistan, similar to those from which the trade of the Persian Coast suffered, retarded the natural development of trade on the Karun 1 by restricting the operations of British merchants and other wholesale exporters, so discouraging producers from increasing their output. The Karun had hardly been opened to navigation when an interdict on the exportation of wheat was imposed on the lower river and was presently extended to the upper, though the existence of scarcity appear ed doubtful and the accumulation of grain in the country seemed I unlikely, in any case, to benefit the people at large. Again in 1891 the i export of wheat from the upper Karun was prohibited in July, from Muhammareh in November. In 1893—1894 the crops on the Karun were good, but the export of grain was again temporarily prevented. Yet again, about the middle of 1895, notwithstanding the suffi' ciency of the preceding harvest, an embargo on grain was suddenly im posed ; but, the notice given being unreasonably short in view of local difficulties connected with purchase and land and river transport, a postponement of the date of its coming into force was with difficulty obtained. This embargo caused inconvenience to the Shaikh of the Karun districts, 1889—93 1891. 1893—1894. 1895.1729 mu 'sian a!

Thus the restriction while it injured the honest trade of British firms, stimulated smuggling by natives of the country and failed in its ostensible object, which was the retention of grain in Persia. The period for which the interdict would remain in force being uncertain, and indications existing of its having been contrived by the Persian officials for reasons which they could not avow, foreign merchants continued to purchase wheat in the expectation that sooner or later, by one means or another, they would be enabled to export it; but this did not suit the wire-pullers behind the scenes ; and presently not the exportation of grain alone but even its purchase and collection for storage were declared illegal. In January 1896 the embargo was partially relaxed by the Persian 1896, Governor of ''Arabistan, who permitted certain stocks to be exported, apparently without proper authority from Tehran, though the central Government were now disposed to let grain already bought leave the country, provided that no fresh purchases were made by exporters until the next crop was assured. At this time the whole of the arrangements connected with the embargo were in a state of chaos which mtpui bespoke the fraudulent motives underlying it, the Karguzar refusing to an into recognise orders passed by the Governor, and the Shaikh of Muham- rivei'J mareh recovering export duty on consignments upon which the arcityf Governor had levied it already. For the double payments made by untiy sfc British exporters redress could not be obtained nearer than Tehran. In nnfl March the Governor capriciously put a stop to exportation, although in JiV spring harvest, which was at hand, gave excellent promise. Presently however, he withdrew his effective veto once more ; and the embargo, the Was then understood to be at an end, every one acting as if it were; but its cessation was never officially notified. ing i n spite of the numerous impediments described above, Messrs. Lynch Growth of isudM persevered in their Kamn enterprise; and though for some years at least the ^ ttie postal subsidy paid them by the British and Indian Governments 1888-1806, r tranf failed to cover a deficit on their operations on the lower river—to say ^ | nothing of the loss which they incurred on the Shalr's behalf on the ^ St u pper ; a considerable impulse was given to the general prosperity of the 11* iriandoi : food i if thePi i the I her wMe1730 country through its trade.

Road projects connected with 'Arabistan, 1873—1896. Eival road prcrjects, 1873-83. The question of placing the province of ; Arabistan in communication with the central and northern districts of Persia by means of a road practicable for caravans, if not for wheeled vehicles, became prominent in the later years of Nasir-ad-Din Shah^s reign in connection with the Karun trade route scheme. Such a road was indispensable, in the absence of a railway, if goods imported by the Persian Grulf were to be placed on favourable terms in the markets which it was desired to capture. The road problem was two-fold : it had to be determined, firstly, which was the best alignment for a road uniting ^Arabistan and northern Persia; and, secondly, whether a road following that alignment could be rendered superior to one following the old estab lished trade route from the Persian Gulf to the interior of Persia by Bushehr, Shiraz, and Isfahan. Messrs. Gray, Paul and Co., the British firm by which the Karun trade route scheme was principally pushed until the opening of the river to navigation, evidently held that a road to the north could be made from 'Arabistan which would be preferable to any Bushehr-Isfahan road, and they at one time inclined to a Shushtar-Isfahan alignment; but the opinion regarding alignment, to which they did uot absolutely commit themselves, rested on rather slender data. The ''Arabistan road question was somewhat elucidated in the discussion of the Karun trade route scheme in 1882-83, in which Sir H. Rawlinson, Sir O. St. John, Mr. Baring, Captain Wells, and Mr. B. Thomson took part ; but there was little agreement among the contributors to the debate, Sir H. Rawlinson preferring the Bushehr-Shiraz-Isfahan route to any rond northwards from ^Arabistan ; while Sir O. St. John thought a mule path from Shushtar to Isfahan or from Dizful to Khurramabad would be better, and Mr. Baring suggested a new but unsurveyed line from Bushehr vid Behbehan to Isfahan. The information on the subject available at the time was in fact too scanty to admit of a final decision being reached. It was established, however, that the shortest road from it, ai lias for a' id, of esfe astkeoi i privileges kmk iro may : ®jatlialf] Messr in, agj Central Pe l%aypr slongati tb(1731 a southern port to Tehran would be one from Dizful by Khurramabad and Burujird, which would be about 400 miles in length as against 590 miles, the length of the next shortest, from Baghdad to Tehran, and 760 miles, the length of one from Eushehr by Shiraz and Isfahan to Tehran; and there was a general consensus of opinion that the line from Shushtar to Isfahan would be found impracticable except as a caravan road. In the winter of 1888-89 ''Arabistan was visited by a Persian Survey Commission, headed by the Najm-ul-Mulk. It was charged with the duty of reporting on roads as well as on other engineering works impor tant to the province. In August 1890 a concession for the construction and exploitation of a commercial road from Tehran to Ahwaz, with a branch from Burujird to Isfahan, was granted by the Persian Government. It was almost immediately transferred by the original Persian concessionnaire to the Imperial Bank of Persia, not without the approval of the Persian Government, and so became a British interest. The concession,* which was for a period of 60 years, conferred the right of constructing the road, of establishing a regular transport service for goods and passengers thereon, and of levying tolls at bridges; together with certain limited privileges of cultivation at particular points'. Foreign capital might be employed in the enterprise and foreign employes entertained, but the number of the latter was not to exceed 30. The road was to be completed within years,— a period which was subsequently extended to the ^Tth May 1913 ; and the Persian mails were to be earned by the Company at half rates. In 1896 Messrs. Lynch succeeded in arranging for the insurance as far as Isfahan, against all risks including robbery, of goods forwarded through them to Nasiri and there by caravan track over the Bakhtiyari Mils to central Persia.

As a prolongation of the line of fluvial transport which it was hoped establish on the Karun, the alternative to a road northwards from Aiabistan was a railway ; and consequently, after 1871, railway projects J^t h a bearing on the p rovince from time to time made their appearance.

Conflicting railway policy of Britain, and Russia in Persia, 1878. In 1871 Mr. Dawes of the firm of Messrs. Gray, Paul and Co., sugges ted the construction of a railway, to which the Persian Government should afford a guarantee, or material aid in some other form, from Shushtar by Isfahan to Tehran. This suggestion, which did not meet with acceptance, was repeated by him two years later, with the obser vation that a line from Dizful by Khurramabad might possibly be found more advantageous than one from Shushtar by Isfahan. After an interval, Persia having become desirous of the assistance of European capitalists for developing an internal railway system, the question of railways between the Persian Gulf and Tehran again came to the front in 1876 ; and as Baron Renter had outstanding claims on the Persian Government Her Majesty^s Government decided to support him as a competitor for a southern railway concession. The line recom mended by Her Britannic Majesty^s Minister at Tehran was one from Tehran to Shushtar by Isfahan, which, he pointed ont, would benefit by- pilgrimages to Qum from both sides and would also carry Persian pil grims proceeding to and returning from the shrines of Turkish 'Iraq and the Hijaz. The project, however, coupled as it was with distasteful proposals for the navigation of the Karun by foreign vessels, was repelled by the Persian Government. Russian advice was undoubtedly a factor in the protracted opposition of the Persian Government to the British scheme of a Karun trade route and to the road and railway projects connected therewith; and^ similarly, British influence was exerted to prevent the acquisition by Russia of railway advantages in the north. In 1878 the British Minister at Tehran opposed projected railways between Rasht and Tehran and between Tehran and Tabriz; but the former was discountenanced bj the Russian Minister also, the Russian view being that any Persian railway which might be constructed should connect with the Russian system at Julfeh, according to a Russian scheme (General Falckenhagen's) which had been pressed in 1874-75, Mr. Thomson pointed out the dangers from Russia to which the proposed lines in the north would expose Persia and dwelt on the innocuous character of the railway communications with the south the creation of which was desired bj Britain ; but apparently without result. A concession for a Rasht- Tehran railway was, in fact, granted to a French Company : but the evident intention of Russia to prevent its commercial success by measures taken within her own borders prevented, in combination with other difficulties, its execution.1733 The discussion of the Karun trade route scheme by British experts in 1882, already twice referred to, embraced, though not expressly, the subject of railways as well as that of roads. The most interesting opinion in regard to railways was expressed by Sir O. St. John, who argued, quoting parts of Spain and the western coast of South America as in stances in point, that cartroads were unsuitable to southern Persia and that there was no useful via media between a mule path and a light rail way ; and he evidently favoured the idea of a light railway running north wards from ^Arabistan. Captain Wells regarded a line of railway follow ing a direct line from Shashtar to Isfahan as not feasible, but he thought that a practicable alignment between those two centres might be found by Behbehan and Shiraz. In 1887 a project was mooted for the construction of a railway between Ahwaz and Tehran, apparently by a British Company. Security was demanded by the projectors in the shape of one half of whatever increase might be obtained in the customs revenue of the Persian Government from Muhammareh, Shushtar, and Bushehr, and the British Government also would seem to have been asked for some guarantee; but the project, as framed, did not meet with the approval of Her Majesty's Minsters. Nothing came of it, unless an undertaking by the Shah in 1889, noticed elsewhere, that Britain should receive a preference in connection with railway construction in Southern Persia. Examination of the rail way question by British experts, 1882. Akwaz- Tehran Eailway project* 1887* Irrigation projects in 'Arabistan, 1875-83. itlot Attention having once been directed to 'Arabistan by the Karun trade loute scheme, it was inevitable that proposals for irrigating the province by a restoration of the ancient ruined barrage at Ahwaz should follow. In December 1875 Dr. Tholozan, physician to the Shah, with whom rp^ 1, . be had great influence, and himself a man of much ability, approached schemetlSTS- the Peisian Government on the subject of a concession for the general development of ; Arabistan, which he suggested might be granted to a Prench company. The concession should authorise the reconstruction ^ the Ahwaz dam by the company, together with the reclamation, and irrigation of the large tracts of fertile country which it would command; a] id it should also convey to them the right of working mines and forests1734 and of establishing manufactories of all kinds. The working of the draft concession was general, but the object in view seemed to be to acquire preferential if not exclusive rights for France; without exciting the suspicions or wounding the susceptibilities of the Persian Government. The grant of this concession was opposed by the British Minister at Tehran on the ground that it would render impossible an amicable adjustment of the claims of Baron Renter, a British concessionaire, upon the Persian Government ; and the Shah, yielding to his pressure, rejected the French proposals in July 1876, Meanwhile, an indigenous scheme for extending irrigation and the cultivation of indigo for home consumption in the neighbourhood of Shushtar came before the Shah^s Council in January 1876 ; but nothing resulted from it. When the Shah visited Paris in 1878 Dr. Tholozan^s scheme was again brought up and discussed; but the only information which His Majesty, on his return to Tehran, would import to the British Minister was that a concession for irrigation at Ahwaz was included in a Frojet cle Reformer which he had prepared. At the beginning of September 1878 it became known that the French concession had been approved by the Council of State ; and in October, notwithstanding representations by Her Britannic Majesty^s Minister that an equitable settlement of the claims of Baron Renter should receive precedence, it was given to Dr. Tholozan, largely—it was believed—as an inducement to him to continue in medical attendance upon the Shah. The concession as soon as it had been actually granted, was attacked by the British Minister on the ground of its being a violation in two respects, of British treaty rights ; for one of its articles gave the French concessionaires complete control of navigation locks which they were empowered to construct at the Ahwaz dam, ijpso facto excluding the British from most-favoured nation treatment j and by another article the right of building any where on lands irrigated from the restored barrage, in other words over a gieah part of the plains of ''Arabistan, was illegally reserved to the concession holders. The infringement of Baron Renter's unjustly can celled concession was also emphasised. Thereupon the French concession, which for some reason was not supported or even favourably regarded by the French Government or their representative at Tehran, was revoked by the Shah, with the assent of Dr. Tholozan. The French project seems to have lingered on, though without much prospect of realisation, until January 1882 when an engineer of the French Government M. Dieulafoy, in the course of a journey in Persia andking i; an anitj; ^is pr^ tion ani' n whicl I itisli H mi iroved tj: •esentatioii, oil Turkish Iraq examined the Ahwaz dam with reference to irrigation and navigation projects on the Karun. His report seems to have been un favourable 3 and it is certain that, from the time of his visit onwards, Frencli political interest in 'Arabistan declined until it finally dis appeared. The Persian Survey Commission under the Najm-ul-Mulk and the British engineer Captain Wells inspected the Ahwaz dam, the latter in connection with navigation only &gt; in the same season as M. Dieulafoy, In the spring of 1883 His Eoyal Highness the Zill-us-Sultan held Concession a concession for irrigation from the Ahwaz dam, one of its conditions us .s u itan, being that only Persian capital should be employed. The Prince hoped 1883. that he might be able to get this restriction removed 3 and Her Britannic Majesty^s Minister in Persia did not fail to remind him, in case he should succeed in this, of the preferential rights of Baron Renter ; but there was no practical outcome of the proceedings. A Persian engineer employed by the Zill-us-Sultan had previously advocated^ in July 1882, the reconstruction of the Ahwaz dam, both as a means of irrigation and to bar the access of foreign shipping to the upper Karun.

The first examination of the Shush site was made in the spring of ^ r iti s li 1850 by Messrs. Loftus and Churciiill under the orders of Colonel excavations Williams, the British representative on the Perso-Turkish frontier Delimitation Commission of 1849— 52, to which they were attached. Though furnished by Marza Ja^far Khan, the Persian member of the Commission, with letters to Sulaiman Khan, the Persian Governor of ^Arabistan, and to other authorities, Messrs. Loftus and Churchill could get no workmen for digging operations; but they were able in a few days to prepare a general plan of the mounds. After a month, during which Mr. Loftus remained at Dizful incapacitated by a riding accident, Colonel Williams and the rest of the British party arrived; and the summer was spent by them in travelling m the hills, and central plateau of Persia, where they visited Kirmanshah,Hamadan ; Isfahan, Sliiraz, etc. Towards the end of the year they returned to Dizful, and a Farman for excavations at Shush having meanwhile been obtained from the Shah^ Mr. Loftus and Lieutenant Glascott^ R.N._, preceded the others to take possession of the site. About a month was spent in experimental excavations; not without use ful results; and the party then returned to Muhammareh to resume the work of the Commission for the season. In the course of 1851 a sum of ,£500 was granted by the British Parliament for work at Shush, which it was arranged should be carried out by Mr. Loftus under the supervision of Major Kawlinson, Political Agent at Baghdad. Mr. Loftus arrived at Shush early in 185^ after a somewhat adventurous journey thither from the camp of the Commis sion at Mandali; and, having been joined by Lieutenant Jackson, 1. N.^ another attach^ of the Commission, he carried on excavation work for about three months, in the course of which the British personnel of the Commission under Colonel W illiams paid a flying visit to his camp. His operations were greatly hampered by the lawlessness of the surround ing tribes and the fanaticism of the religious classes at Dizful, on whose superstitious minds an epidemic of cholera that followed the excavations of 1850 had produced a sinister effect j but his work, though not prolific of material objects of interest^ fully established the identity of Shush with the Susa of classical literature and the Shushan of the Bible. Frenoli^ The next excavators of Shush were M. Dieulafoy, the French at Shash, 113 Government engineer, who in 1882 had examined the Ahwaz dam ; and 1885-86. his wife. Formal sanction for their operations, which were directed and sub sidised by the French Government, was obtained from the Shah in 1884 and their first season^s work extended from the end of February to the middle of May 1885. At the end of the year they returned to 'Arabis- tan, the French gunboat Scorpion ' being specially placed at their disposal for the journey, and prosecuted excavations at Shush with energy and success from the middle of December 1885 till the end of March 1886. Like Mr. Loftus they had serious difficulties to contend with, arising from the unsettled state of the country and from religious fanaticisfflj even from official obstruction, Returning to civilisation at the end of their first season by way of 'Amarah and the Tigris, the objects obtain ed by them at Shush were impounded by the Turkish authorities, apparently on the absurd pretext that Shush was in Turkish territory; but ^ailso french1737 | ^ diplomatic representations, assisted by the appearance of the ' Scorpion ' ^ in the Shatt-al ^Arab in November 1885^ at last brought about a res- b , a!1 ^ titution. At the end of the second season an attempt was made by m 1 the Muzaffar-ul-Mulk, Governor of ^Arabistan, to enforce a division of the finds with the Persian Government, a proceeding for which there was no warrant in the arrangements made between the French and Persian Governments but it was relinquished on hopes being held out of a d by 111 French decoration being conferred on the Zill-us-Sultan, the Governor istouli. General The articles obtained in the second seasons work filled over 300 cases, ailyirt and invaluable assistance was rendered by Shaikh Miz ; al Khan of p of tk( Muhammareh in the difficult task of bringing them down to the Shatt-al ant Jack 'Arab. The combined result of M. and Mme. Dieulufoy's two janiioD; campaigns at Shush was a collection of remarkable interest and impor- i persoDiti tance. On the 12th May 1895 a general concession for antiquarian research essoffc: in Persia was obtained by the French Government from the Government it Ml,; of the Shah; but no work was done under it in ^ Arabistan until the reign ritheeis of the next Shah when, in December 1897, systematic excavations were thoflgb begun at Shush by M. J. de Morgan, identity:: )f tEs Bi Frencli activity in 'Arabistan, 1875—96. k ates There were other indications, besides Dr. Tholozan's Ahwaz irrigation directrf scheme and the French excavations at Shush, that attention had been imtteSii; attracted in France to the province of ; Arabistan. f febnaij In 1881 communication was established between Marseilles and retomed!: Basrah by a French line of steamers; and commercial agents, who [lv pW appeared to be naval and military officers,—a circumstance which gave m at Sli a political complexion to the enterprise,—appeared at Muhammareh and 35 till 4 engaged there in the exportation of grain and the importation of breech loading arms and ammunition. There was reason to believe that these occurrences were connected with Dr. Tholozan^s scheme, which the British )m _ , Legation had so far successfully combated,considering that the establish- ment of French interests and a French community in ; Arabistan would be 5itl p . prejudicial to Britain for commercial and even military reasons, and that it might increase friction between Britain and France. According to the ur Zill-us-Sultan, who was then in correspondence with Colonel Ross, the rkistterf1788 Resident in the Persian Gulf^ on the subject of the navigation o£ the Karun, the French Minister at Tehran and Dr. Tholozan were busily engaged at the end of 1881 in endeavouring to secure an exclusive concession for the utilisation of that river, their efforts being countenanced by Russia^ who would gladly have seen the British excluded from the Karun in favour of some other power. In 1885^ however, French schemes on the Karun and French trade at Muhammareh having in the meantime ceased, the French steamer service from Europe was discontinued. The line, though heavily subsidised by the French Government, had carried principally British goods; and if British shipowners had suffered by its competition, British merchants had benefited by the lowering of freights. *MUZAFFAR-UB-DlN SHAH, from 1896.

His recall was connected with a serious failure to do justice in the case of a British subject, des cribed further on; and it was said that the Persian Government had proscribed him and his family from official employment on the Persian Coast and in ■'Arabistan for a period of years. The ATa-ud-Dauleh, afterwards Governor-General of Farsin 1903-04, was appointed to succeed the Nizam-Us-Saltaneh and arrived at Shushtar in .February 1897. Interim charge of the province seems to bave been *The chief official sources of information for this period are :-M. J A SaldanWs Precis of Ferstan 'Ardhistan Jffairs, 1904; Lieutenant T.

The Sardar-i-Akram (or Sa ; ad-us-Saltaneh) followed the A^la-ud- Dauleh and seems to have remained in office for a year only. He was in some sort a nominee of the Nizam-us-Saltaneh, the former Governor General, who had acquired valuable estates in the province and needed agent on the spot to recover the rents. an thof Eii [ since K -as conwi i subject t d the ft® rsin lW 1 at Shi to havets [son 's ^ Uvf'ArS mn The next Governor-General of •'Arabistan was His Royal Highness the 'Ain -ud-DauJah, afterwards Prime Minister of Persia. Luristan also was placed under his control; and he retained both provinces until December 1900, when he was recalled to Tehran and became Governor of the capital. The successor of the A^la-ud-Daulah was the Salar-ud-Damleh^ third son of the reigning Shah ; he was supposed to be favourably disposed towards British interests. Luristan was combined with ^Arabistan under his administration, and his headquarters were at Burujird 0 He person ally visited Dizful and Shushtar in ^ Arabistan, and at the end of 1901 proposed to inspect Muhammareh ; but on the advice of the Shaikh of Muhammareh, who asserted that trouble would follow if the Prince were to enter any of the Arab districts, the central Government forbade him to travel further south than Shushtar. After this the Salar-ud- Dauleh seems to have given little attention to ''Arabistan affairs and to have left the Governor of Northern ''Arabisfcan—after July 1901 the A^zam^us-Saltaneh—to contend as best he could with ever-increasing confusion and anarchy. The impression left of the Salar^ud-Dauleh^s personality, when he relinquished charge of the combined provinces in 1904, was one of youth, wilfulness, and imprudence. In June 1903, before the Salar's departure, the place of the A'zam-us-Saltaneh was taken by the Yamin-i-Nizam, a military officer. The A ; zan&gt;us-Saltaneb^ the Salar-ud-Dauleh^s whilom assistant, be came Governor-General of ^Arabistan in 1904 and reached Shushtar in July, after the province had remained for some time derelict. As an administrator he was a nonentity. The only event of provincial importance during the period was an epi demic of cholera. The disease appeared in June 1904 at Dizful, where it carried off, it was said, 2,000 persons* Later it broke out at Shushtar, where its ravages were less serious, and at Nasiri, where in September it brought about an almost complete cessation of trade.

Of Qazvini origin, but educated at Tehran, the Salar-i- Mukarram was a nephew of the Nizam-us-Saltaneh and the Sa^ad-ul- Mulk, who in their time had held many important posts in Southern Persia, the former having been twice Governor-General of ^Arabistan and once of Pars ; and the Salar himself was no novice in the art of admi- nistration as practised in Persia, for he had been Governor of the Gulf Ports from 1901 to 1903, in which last year he was deputed to receive Lord Curzon, Viceroy and Governor-General of India at LingeL His conduct of affairs in ^Arabistan will be described later : his personal character was summed up by Lieutenant Lorimer, His Britan nic Majesty^s Vice-Consul for 'Arabistan in the words— ' The Salar is a man of force and ability, but avaricious more than cruel, and entirely selfish. He seems incapable of any generous sentiment, and one seeks in vain in his acts for any trace of compassion or even mercy.'' His principal lieutenant in ^Arabistan was the MVizz-ul-Mamalik, an individual who, like the Salar himself, had been known as an official at Bushehr. The Salar amassed a handsome private fortune during his Governor-Generalship of 'Arabistan. 1896. Internal affairs of Northern 'Arabistan^ 1896—1905. The history of Northern ^Arabistan during the period under consider ation is a record of well-nigh continuous and intolerable disorder. In 1896 the Arab tribes about Dizful and Shushtar made common cause, under their Shaikhs, against the Persian Government and the Lurs ravaged the country in the neighbourhood of Dizful. In June the Il-Khani of the Bakhtiyari tribe, whose help had been invoked for the suppression of these disorders, was defeated by the rebels; and there was a panic in Shushtar,where the people, seeing the Persian authorities helpless proposed—as did also the surrounding rural popula tion—to pay the yearns revenue to the Arabs instead of to the Govern ment. I 1 action fights and collisions between the populace and the authorities occurred even in the towns of Dizful and Shushtar; and at Ahwaz an affray took place between the inhabitants and the Persian military garrison, which last at this time was rather the cause of dis turbances than a prop of order and authority. sb helm ^abakhti1741 •am^p In 1897, after the arrival of the A J la-ud-Dauleh ; steps were taken to ble {jj^ij, enforce order at Shushtar, where outrages had been committed against in, the| persons under British protection. The first result of these was a general theSa'j upheaval in the town, which, but for the appearance of a force of 3,000 i in ^ Bakhtiyaris on the scene, might have ended disastrously for the local of 'Aui; Grovernment. As it was, the revolt was suppressed after three weeks' leartoii; desultor 7 fighting, in which 25 rioters and 5 of the Governor-General's of men were killed. But the measures adopted by the A'la-ud-Dauleh ls ^ were not approved by the Persian Government, and he resigned and dia at Li left the province without waiting to be relieved by his successor.

In 1903 the Parahan Regiment of Persian Infantry, 800 strong, was 1903 unto » ^ fr0m tlie I10rtl110 aSsist in I' 1 ® 11 ' 11 ? t,ie disorders ; but it suffered disaster b y tie way, being attacked by Lurs on tbe 3rd February 1903 iao;' ' )etweeu ^-burramabad and Dizful.

On one occasion the Wali r ''w, 0f Pusht ' i ' Klih stowed himself at Dizful, but his intervention produced 6 ^ ; no result 5 tbe Lur attack on the troops was avenged, however, to some ig e extent, by a Bakhtiyari levy. The ' Shushan ' was again fired on. j r® In 1904 the roads near Dizful and Shushtar were still very unsafe, 1904 to « an the general state of affairs grew progressively worse, while the Perslai1 authorities remained paralysed or apathetic. In March ,*11 qt ' tliecaravan of two members of the French arch»ologieal Mission j,,! the 'at Shush was looted between that place and Nasiri, and in April another h ecai#attaokwas made on the 'Shushan' at Shalaili. For two or three1742 months in the early summer of 1904^ between the departure of the Salar-ud-Dauleh and the arrival of the Salar-i-Mukarram, temporary but efficient arrangements were made by the Shaikh of Muhammareh^ at the request of the Persian Government, for the preservation of order in parts of Northern ^Arabistan, particularly on the upper Karun. 1905. It was only on the arrival of the Salar-i-Mukarram (then Mu^azzam) in J 905 that the difficulties of the situation were at last firmly grappled with. The Salar brought with him a force of 2,000 men, but he had nevertheless to purchase a safe-conduct through the Lur country from the chiefs of the Dirakwand. On reaching ^Arabistan his first task was to set the affairs of the Hawizeh district in order, this being the object of his mission before his appointment to the Governor-Generalship had been resolved on ; but it was not long ere he turned his attention to Shushtar and Dizful with rapid and surprising results. As remarked by Lieutenant Lorimer^ Yice-Consul for ; Arabistan, it was 'only fortunate that, for the furtherance of his own designs^ he found it convenient to exercise his redoubtable powers towards introducing peace and security into the country.' His success was largely due in the opinion of Lieutenant Ranking, Lieutenant Lorimer J s successor, to the good relations that he maintained with the Shaikh of Muhammareh and the help that he received from him ; and the same officer described the Salar as having quickly attained to ' a power and authority which had not been known in any ruler of the province since Sulaiman Khan. ;; Most of his administrative achievements belong fcoa later period, but by the end of 1905 he had the towns of Shushtar and Dizful under strict control, as also the Arab tribes whose territory most nearly adjoined them. Affairs of the Hawizeh district, 1896—1905. The position of the Hawizeh district for some time remained in* determinate, but by the end of the period, in consequence of the steadily increasing power of the Shaikh of Muhammareh, it bad become more or less definitely attached to Southern ; Arabistan. 1896 - At the end of 1896 internal troubles that had prevailed in Hawizeh earlier in the year broke out afresh, but intervention by the Shaikh of Muhammareh caused them for a second time to be suspended. # Vide page 1675.foo4: 1748 In 1902, the revenue payable by the Bani Turuf of the Hawizeh 1902-04. district being greatly in arrear and the Persian Government being about to resort to coercion, the Shaikh of Muhammareh interposed and paid a large sum into the Persian Treasury on account of the tribe. This advance not being repaid him, Shaikh Khaz^al in the autumn of 1903 obtained leave from the Persian Government to put pressure on the Bani Turuf, and proceeded to collect a force of his own subjects, with a few guns, at Bandar Muzaffari on the Karun. Before the end of January 1904 he had received a reinforcement of some Persian cavalry from Dizful, and the Bakhtiyari Khans had sent him a contingent of 100 mounted men along with a complimentary message. In February a small detachment of Persian infantry from Bushehr, and at the beginning of March another from Dizful, joined his camp. The Yamm-i-Nizam, as commanding the Persian military forces in 'Arabi- stan and as representing His Royal Highness the Salar-ud-Dauleh, who was in Luristan, also came to Bandar Muzaffari; and at the end of March the heterogeneous force under its two leaders, advanced on Hawizeh. The Bani Turuf submitted without resistance, and within a fortnight it had been arranged that they should pay 8,000 Tumans immediately to a Persian official and discharge the balance of their arrears, amounting to 50,000 Tumans, within a short period. Hostages for the performance of this contract were offered by the tribe, but were declined by the Shaikh of Muhammareh. The Bani Turuf having neglected to fulfil their obligations, the 1905. Salar-i-Mu'azzam, who presently became Governor-General of ^Arabis- &lt;an, was sent by the Persian Government to punish them in conjunction with the Shiakh of Muhammareh. The joint expedition, to which the Salar contributed 1,300 men, started on the 19th October 1905. Again there was no fighting; but the settlement made was more satisfactory than on the previous occasion. Out of a balance of 87,000 Tumans said to be now due by the Bani Turuf on account of seven years arrears, it was stated that they paid up 40.000, and had given security, though of a doubtful kind, for the remainder ; one of their Chiefs, Haji Sabhan, who refused to submit to the overlordship of the Shaikh of Muhammareh, was driven into exile; 'Ali Minaishid an air 'Ah, two other chiefs, were placed in charge of the tribe ; an another, named Sharhan was given up to Shaikh Khaz/al Khan as a hostage. In the same year fighting took place between the Bani Saleh and 0 urafa of Hawizeh, in which the former were victorio1744 Assassination of Shaikh Miz'al and accession o£ Shaikh Khaz'al to the Shaikhdom of Muham- mareh, June 1897. Tribal affairs under Shaikh Miz'al and absorption of the Ka'ab Shaikhdom, 1897-1906. 1897-98. Affairs of the Shaikhdom of Muhammareh (Southern 'Arabistan), 1896—1905. On the 2nd June 1897 Shaikh Miz^al Khan, the ruler of Muham- mareh, whose personal unpopularity with his subjects had become very great, was suddenly shot dead, along with a nephew named ^Abdul Jalil, while disembarking from a Ballam at his residence at Eailiyeh. The actual assassins were three negroes, but a large force of Arabs and negroes under Salman-bin-Mansur, a cousin of the Shaikh, was at hand to support them if necessary ; and the crime was countenanced, thongh probably not instigated, by the Shaikhs youngest brother, Khaz ; al Khan, who was now the only other surviving son of Shaikh Jabir. Haji Muhammad ; Ali, Rai-ut-Tujjar ; who afterwards became Khaz^al Khan's principal adviser, was believed to have been privy to the deed. Shaikh Miz'al Khan died regretted by none, and without issue. Khaz'al Khan was brought from his house on the night of the murder by Salman-bin-Mansur, and at once took charge of the affairs of the Shaikhdom ; afterwards, having become Shaikh of the Muhaisin by tribal election, he was recognised by the Persian Government as Governor on their behalf of Muhammareh. The assassination of Shaikh Miz ; al caused some local excitement, and the Arabs of Muhammareh went armed for a few days after; but no disturbances occurred. H. M. S. Sphinx*''' was sent to Muhammareh as a precaution, but her presence was not required. One of the first acts of the new ruler was to send, unsolicited, an armed guard for the protection of the British Vice- Consulate at Muhammareh, The liberality of the new Shaikh's rule over his subjects was generally appreciated by them as a change from the austere selfishness of Miz'aFs later years. The general policy, however, of the ruling family of Muhammareh, initiated by Shaikh J abir, was in no way weakened by the change of head. In the districts adjoining Muhammareh the administration was, if anything, strengthened ; and before long the power of the Shaikh showed a tendency to expand beyond its* traditional limits. An important event was the final extinction of the Ka'ab Shaikh dom of Fallahiyeh, which in 1895, as we have seen, was already in a * These limits are defined in a local Arab saying that ' When the Bawiyeh were strong, Haji Jabir stopped at Salmaneh ; whon the Ka'ab were strong he was afraid to go to Humkh. ,, The reference to Munikh suggests the defeat of the Muhaisin by the Ka'ab there in or about 1860.1745 parlous plight. A contest for its possession still continued between Lral )is| Shaikh Ja ; far and Shaikh ^Abdullah^ two members of the Ka^ab ruling family, of whom the former, then in actual possession^ was supported in 1897 by the Shaikh of Muhammareh, while the latter was favoured by the Sardar-i-Akram^ the Persian Governor-General of 'Arabistan. Each of the authorities interested exerted his influence with the central AMuli Government to the utmost for the purpose of preventing the appoint- I ment of his rivals nominee. The Sardar represented that^ if the W)S} Shaikhs advice were taken in opposition to his own^ Muhammareh wasatlj would shortly be found separated from Persia and reposing under British lce( l) M protection. The Shaikh threatened that^ if his wishes were disregarded, Ler &gt; he would cease to hold himself responsible for affairs outside his own laikh I| district of Muhammareh ; and this threat was of serious import to the we ft Nizam-us-Saltaneh, ex-Governor-General of 'Arabistan, for he could to ikk not hope without the Shaikh^s assistance to derive any profit from sue. large estates which he owned in the Jarrahi district and to the west light ol 1 of the Karun, and in which the Mushir-ud-Dauleh, soon afterwards •fthei Prime Minister of Persia, was his partner. In these circumstances the be Muki Sardar-i-Akram was ordered by the Persian Government not to change Dvernii the Governors of Fallahiyeh and Jarrahi; but he defied their instruc- onofSli ^ ons an( i appointed Shaik 'Abdullah to the former, and one Mir Mirai hhm ^tter district.

After this, under the Shaikhs government, order reigned as a rule throughout Southern ^Arabistan. Ka^ab of the Nassar section, settled on ^Abbadan Island, who had given trouble to Shaikh Miz'al in 1883 and again in 1887, having again attempted to raise their heads, Shaikh Khaz'al in 1905 settled 1,500 male immigrants of the 'Idan tribe from Turkish territory at Qasbeh on tlie Shatt-aWArab and temporarily posted 500 tribal levies there : the result was the firm establishment of his authority in a remote and hitherto sparsely inhabited corner of the Muhammareh district, and a decide! check to piracy on the Shatt-al-^Arab* In the same year the A1 Bu Eawayeh of the Ahwaz district, aided by another tribe, made an unsuccessful attack on the Bani Tamim ; audi such was now the state of the country that the occurrence was re marked as unusual. While the influence of the Shaikh of Muhammareh was advancing northwards, as well as in other directions, that of the Bakhtiyari Khans was extending southwards. About 1896 the district of Ramuz hadbeeJ purchased by the Bakhtiyaris from the Persian Government and aboutj 1898 they acquired the plain of ''Aqili from its original Shushtari prol prietors, besides which a large part of the country between Shnshtr town and the Diz river, and even a tract between the Karkheh _ Shaur rivers to the north of Shush, passed into their hands. 3 A common distrust of the Persian Government formed a bond of union between the Khans and the Shaikh of Muhammareh, but was also a tendency to a collision between their interests.

In 1903 a caravan travelling on the roaf^eai] was attacked in the low country by Khasraj (Bani-Lam) raiders, and ffcnias dispute as to responsibility followed, in which the decision of thePeH^and t] sian Government was adverse to the Shaikh. Nevertheless, as has b eeD ^enitory mentioned, the Bakhtiyari Khans helped Shaikh Khaz^al in his expelk^ J tion against the Bani Turuf in 1904.1747 ^ ^ In 1905 a difference which had arisen regarding the ownership of a 1905. rr % tract named Raghaiweh, situated on the Bakhtiyari Road on the confines of the Ahwaz district, was aggravated by the flight to it of refugees from ' lle ^ s ! the Shaikhs authority, whom the Khans refused to surrender. Eventual- ly an order was obtained from Tehran for the forcible repatriation of H wb; the Raghaiweh refugees, but it was abused in the execution, and Shaikh Khaz^al Khan then apparently relinquished his claim and complaints. ed 1,511, .asbet ot re: fc. j an j| Relations of the Shaikh of Mnhammareli with the Turkish ^ a j f Government, 1896-1905.

His interests in Turkish territory were large, consisting partly k ^ as explained in the history of Turkish 'Iraq, in the allegiance of large jWeei11 numbers of his own tribesmen cultivating lands to the west of the Shatt- al-'Arab ; and he did not fail to add, by fresh purchases, to the estates in 181 Turkey left him by his father and his brother. At Basrah his represen- tative Mirza Hamzah, a Turkish subject, enjoyed considerable influence iare ^ 1 aT1( l respect; but the increasing power of the Shaikh at home and abroad ^ ^ was regarded with jealousy by the local Turkish officials and friction between Basrah and Muhammareh became not infrequent. Crimes [ijrefl w occurring in Turkish territory were the commonest cause of difficulty, the riroa, Turkish authorities often alleging that they were committed by subjects ed at ® 0 f the Shaikh, and sometimes that they were the work of his personal ad pro dependents, acting under instructions. It was true that the Shaikh had ctttepc.

Another Turkish allegation, that the Shaikh generally prevailed by bribuxg 120 A1748 Turkish officials, was probably not ill-founded; for in Turkey there was still no effective means but bribery of getting official business transacted. Relations of the Shaikh of Muhammareh with the Persian Governinent, 1896—1905. Recognition of Shaikh Khaz'al by the Persian Government, 1897-98. Transfer of the 'Arabistan Customs from the Shaikh of Mubammareh to the Imperial Persian Customs in 1902, events leadinoj There seems to have been, from the time of Khaz^al Khan^s accession to the Shaikhdom of Muhammareh, considerable distrust between hira and the central Persian Government. The Shalr's ministers did not regard with favour the exceptional position in Persia which the Shaikh had inherited, enjoyed, and sought to improve; and he, on his part lived, in fear of encroachments by them on his autonomy and semi- independence. Soon after assuming charge of Muhammareh, Shaikh Khaz^al sent his Secretary Haji Muhammad ^Ali, Rais-ut-Tujjar, to Tehran to negotiate with the Persian Grovernment for his confirmation in the position to which he had succeeded by inheritance acd popular choice. The Haji arrived at the capital in December 1897 and was xvell received by the Sadr-i-A^zam, who did not long delay to issue the documents of recognition. The conflict over Fallahiyeh affairs in which the Shaikh became involved with the Sardar-i-Akram occasioned him much anxiety, the question of his confirmation being then as yet unsettled or only just settled, for the Persian Governor-General showed signs of bringing forward a new candidate for the Shaikship in the person of Khaz^aFs cousin 'Abud; but_, with the frustration of the Sardar's designs in the Ka^ab country, this danger passed away. The Persian Government had long been desirous of taking the management of the Customs of 'Arabistan out of the hands of the Shaikh of Muhammareh. So early as 188^ an unsuccessful attempt had been made by the Governor of Bushehr to induce Miz'al Khan to resign control of them to the Persian authorities; and in 1897 endeavours were made to establish a Government Custom House at Muhammareh, but were foiled by the opposition of Shaikh Khaz'al. Under the system which existed before the changes about to he described, Muhamm^reh was practically the only Customs port of ip) 1 mo1749 ^Arabistan, no pretence being made of taxing exports and imports by thereto, and sea in Pallahiyeh and the otter districts to eastward; and even at difficulties^ Muhammareh the principal commodities exported (such as dates^ wool^ 1897-1904. and dried fruits) and imported (such as tea, coffee, sugar, arms, and ammuniton) were exempt from duty, while the Shaikh and his headmen and other local officials enjoyed in addition certain personal immunities. The Muhammareh Customs were regranted to the Shaikh year by year for a contract sum which was fixed at Nauruz. In 1900, the net annual proceeds of the ; Arabistan Customs being jqqq then estimated at £8,000 only, and arrangements being on foot for the extension of Imperial Persian Customs system to the whole of Persia, the Persian Government began to move in the matter of Muhammareh. Up to the 11th March 1900, when a meeting took place between Shaikh Rhaz^al and Colonel Meade, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the former, though he had been sounded on the subject of a transfer of the Customs, had received no official notice of the intentions of the Persian Government. He had, however, fully considered the threatened innovation in all its bearings, and he informed Colonel Meade that his subjects, being unaccustomed to pay, would not tolerate a duty on dates any more than his headmen would on other articles ; that the tribes of Fallahiyeh and Jarrahi would probably resist the introduction of Customs in those districts ; and that he himself, if he acceded to the wishes of the Government, would be regarded by his people as having betrayed their trust in him, and must in the end either rebel or retire to his estates in Turkey. The Resident, under telegraphic instructions from His Britannic Majesty^s Minister at Tehran, pointed out in reply that the Persian Government had unquestionably a right to collect customs at Muhammareh, which was one of their ports, and confined himself, for the rest, to expressing a hope that some compromise between the Shaikh and the Government would be found possible; but steps were taken by of tak the British Legation for protecting the Shaikh^s interests, so far as possi- lehaii^ 1 hie; and an assurance was given them by the Persian Government that essful i he would be treated with every consideration, and compensated for pecu- (fjz'al U niary loss. The services of the Resident in the Persian Gulf were also and I ds utilized, at the request of the Persian Minister of Customs, Mr. Naus, torn Ho® ^ purpose of re-assuring the Shaikh as to the real intentions of the laikb ^ ^ er ^ an Government. What the Shaikh dreaded more than the loss of g about 1 Customs was that the Government, after taking them over, might » P^ceed to deprive him of his districts one by one, and destroy his power r altogether.1750 190.1.. In 1901 the attitude of the Shaikh was unchanged, and he professed to think that the policy of the Persian-Government towards him had been suggested by Eussia because of his favourable attitude to British interests, of which, he said, successive Karguzars of Muhammareh had complained fco the Persian Foreign Office. In January 1901 Mr. Simais, a Belgian Director-General of Customs from Bushehr, visited Muham- mareh and formed the opinion that there would be no real difficulty in depriving tiie Shaikh of the Customs j but he proposed that a reduction of 30,000 Tumans should be made in the revenue annually payable by the Shaikh, which included the farm of the Customs, and that an allowance of 1^,000 to 15,000 Tumans a year should be granted him besides instead of an exemption of his merchandise from customs duty which he had hitherto enjoyed. A suggestion that payment of the indemnity to be assigned to the Shaikh on the removal of the Customs from his charge should be guaranteed by the British Government was discussed among various British authorities, but without practical result. It came to the knowledge of His Britannic Majesty^s Minister at Tehran that the Persian Government intended, if the Shaikh remained obdurate, to sta tion their gunboat ' Persepolis ^ in the Shatt-al- ; Arab and prevent the landing at Muhammareh of cargo on which duty had not previously been paid at Bushehr. In August 1901 the Shaikh received a telegram from the Persian Governor-General of ^Arabistan in which he was ordered to hand over the management of the Muhammareh customs to Imperial Officials; but, by representing that scarcity prevailed and that public feeling was unsettled, he succeeded in obtaining a respite, nominally of five months. During this delay it became evident that the Shaikh was supported in his resistance by encouragement from some of his neigh bours. The chiefs of the Dashtistan district near Bushehr were said to have promised their aid to the Shaikh if he resisted the establish ment of an Imperial Customs house at Muhammareh by force; and the Bakhtiyari Khans, on whom the Persian Government were believed to rely in case coercion became necessary, not only declared that they would not lend themselves to such a policy, but went so far as to profess great friendliness for him. 1902. I n March 1902 the Russian Legation at Tehran addressed the Persian Government, protesting against irregularities in the collection of cus toms at Muhammareh and urging that, for the sake of uniformity and with a view to fair and equal treatment of the merchants of all nations, a proper Customs administration should be established there without1751 ffii further delay. It may be mentioned that Bushehr and the greater part of the Persian coast had already, 1901-0^ been placed in charge of the Imperial Persian Customs. Shaikh Khaz^al immediately despatched his Secretary to Tehran to discuss the subject with the Shah^s Ministers ; and Haji Rais, who arrived there early in April and consulted the British Legation freely during his negotiations, eventually succeeded in obtaining a compromise not unfavourable to his master, besides concessions of the greatest moment in matters not connected with the Customs. By a Farman issued in June or July 1902, His Majesty the Shah appointed Shaikh Khaz^al Khan to be Director-General of the Customs of ; Arabistan under the Persian Ministry of Customs, subject to the condition that Mr. Waffelaert, a Belgian Director of the Imperial Persian Customs—who was, however, to be regarded as his subordinate—should be associated with him in their management, as also Mirza Yante, a Persian subject. The Belgian Director was to treat the Shaikh with deference and respect, and comply with his instructions and advice in all questions affecting Arabs and natives of the country; and the Shaikh on his part must show friendliness to the new Customs officials and afford them his co-operation and support. Duty was to be taken at a uniform ad valorem rate of 5 per cent on goods of all kinds; no further charges were to be levied in the interior on goods which had paid Customs duty; and the Shaikh was to place his steam launches at the disposal of the Customs whenever their services were required. The inferior Customs staff were to be selected and appointed with the Shaikhs approval ; and the Shaikh himself, as Director-General, w^as to receive a salary of 1^000 Tumans a month out of the Customs receipts. In another document handed to the Shaikh^s agent at about the same time, the Persian Government undertook that the exportation of dates and other fruits, fresh or dried, should always be allowed duty free 5 but grain was made liable to the same export duty as might be imposed in other provinces. It was also promised that a reduction should be made in the amount of the revenue (Malyat) payable by the Shaikh, which had hitherto included a sum on account of customs : in 1900 this sum had been estimated at 15,000 Tumans out of a total amount of 90,000. A guarantee was also given that the Customs administration would not be allowed to interfere in executive matters. Under these arrangements, which, it will be seen, amply safe guarded the general prestige and executive authority of the Shaikh, the Customs establishments of ^Arabistan, including Custom houses at Nasiri,1752 Shushtar, and apparently Dizful, as well as Muhammareli, came tinder the control of the Persian Ministry of Customs with effect from the 23rd September 1902. At the end of the year^ on a request being preferred by the British representative at Tehran that the text of the arrangements understood to have been concluded between the Persian Government and the Shaikh might be communicated to him, the Atabaig-i-A^zam, who did not know that the original documents had been seen by the British Legation^ denied that any written understanding existed and objected to the use of the word ' agreement ^ as describing the alleged arrangements. He gave, however, a verbal assurance that the Shaikh would be retained as titular head of the ^Arabistan Customs ; and he took no exception to an intimation by the British Minister that, if further changes were attempted at Muhammareh, His Britannic Majesty^s Government might feel obliged to interfere. 1903. On the 14th February 1903 a new customs tariff, superseding the uniform 5 per cent, ad valorem duties, was brought into force throughout Persia; and in ^Arabistan^ although it caused no less discontent there than in other parts of the Gulf, no disturbances occurred. In December of the same year the Shaikh complained that the Persian Government were preparing to violate the arrangements that they had made with him in 190£ by introducing additional Belgian officials and generally undermining his authority, and also to depart from assurances which they had more lately given him that no duty would be levied on articles lawfully imported by him for his personal use. On his bringing his fears to the knowledge of the British Minister in Persia^ who was then at Muhammareh, he was informed, on the authority of His Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that in the opinion of the British Government he would be justified in resisting any attempt by the Persian Government to break through the arrangements of 1902. 1904- In 1904 fresh difficulties arose between the Shaikh and the Persian Government in Customs matters. In autumn of that year, though the Shaikh had not failed to provide steam launches when needed under the arrangements of 1902^ the Imperial Persian Customs steamer ^Muzaffari^ and gunboat ' Persepolis ' were stationed on the Shatt-al-'Arab and began to search native vessels for illicit arms within the jurisdiction of the Shaikh^ without any reference to his authority. Remonstrances against these proceedings by His Britannic Majesty's Charge d'Affaires at Tehran lesulted in their discontinuance, being assisted perhaps by a1758 protest which the Turkish Wali of Basrah made^ through the Persian Consul -General at that place, on the ground that some of the vessels searched were bound for Basrah and not for aoy Persian port. The removal to Bushehr, for trial, of an absconding cashier of the Muham- mareh Customs house who had been extradited from British India on a warrant issued by the Shaikh, was resented by the latter as an infringe ment of his criminal jurisdiction ; and he successfully resisted an attempt made in October 1904 to charge ' office dues ^ at Muhammareh on shipments of dates, which he regarded as a breach of the under taking that exportation of fruit should be free. It remains to notice the other valuable concessions obtained by Haji Rais ; the Shaikh's agent, on his visit to Tehran in 1902. The first of these was a Farman, promised in June or July 1902 but not issued until January 1903, by which the Shah granted, 'as per petual property, to the Sardar-i-Arfa^ and his Arabs and tribes ' all Persian Government lands in the Muhammareh, ^Abbadan, Bahmanshir, and Karun districts on which 'the Arabs and the tribes and tribesmen of His Excellency Shaikh Khaz^al Khan, Mu^izz-us-Saltaneh, Sardar-i- Arfa^ have, from the time of their forefathers and grandfathers until now, grown date palms and trees and constructed buildings/'' on condition of payment of ' the usual revenue.On the Sardar-i-Arfa' himself were conferred, moreover^ ' all the lands which are barren and without date palms and trees until now, as perpetual property, so that he may give them to his tribe and tribesmen, who should grow date palms and trees thereon and do what is necessary for rendering the place populous/'' It was added that the Persian Government should have no right to resume any of the lands conferred on the Shaikh, unless by way of expropriation at a reasonable price, and that the Shaikh and his subjects should not be entitled to alienate the lands granted to them, or immoveable property situated thereon^ to subjects of foreign Powers. It was at first the intention of the Persian Government to reserve to themselves the lands as yet unoccupied and unreclaimed, but they ultimately consented to waive that point. Before the issue of this Farman the Shaikhs tenure of his ancestral domains was, at least in theory, precarious. The Bakhtiyari Khans had bought the Ramuz district from the Persian Government about 1896, ^hile the Nizam-us-Saltaneh had about the same time acquired large The refer 0 ! 106 to the ShaikVs subjects was inserted on a suggestion by the jation : Haji Eais considered it unnecessary. Grant of the Muham- mareli, 'AbbadSn, Bahmanshir, and Karun districts to the Shaikh of Muham mareh and bis subiects, 1903.1754 Grant of Fal- lahiyeh to the Shaikh of Muham- niareh, 1903. Grant of Hin- diyan, Dih Mulla, and lands east of the Karun to the Shaikh of M n h a m - mareh, 1903. Persian titles conferred on S h a i k li Kaz'al and his family, 1898- 1902. tracts of land in the Jarrahi district and between the Karun and Karldieli rivers, and it was at least possible that the lands composing the Shaikhs territory might in a similar way be sold over his head to high Persian officials, or court favourities, or wealthy merchants like the Mu ; m-ut. Tujjar. In the same manner, by a separate Farman, ' the place of Fallahiyell 3 ;, as being e&lt; part of the jurisdiction of His Excellency Shaikh Khazal Khan was bestowed on him, also ' as perpetual property/^ subject to payment of ' the usual annual revenue ' and non-transfer of his proprietary rights to foreigners. He was expressly ' permitted and empowered to exercise in those lands the possessory rights of ownership of every kindand power of resuming this grant, also, was formally renounced by the Government. By a third Farman of the same date ' the whole of Hindiyan and Dih Mulla, which are a part of his jurisdiction, together with the lands on the east of the Karun which are the place of his cultivation,^ were granted to Shaikh Khaz^al on the same terms as Fallahiyeh, so that lie might, u with the utmost hopefulness and extreme zeal, busy himself in augmenting the improvement of those two places/'' The combined effect of the three grants was apparently to invest the Shaikh with a secure title to all Southern ^Arabistan except the Hawizeli district, of which the position was anomalous, and Ma^shur and other tracts, which were owned by the Nizam-us-Saltaneh in partnership witli the Muship-ud^Dauleh. In April 1898 the title (Laqab) of ' Mn'izz-us-Saltaneh,^ borne by his predecessor in office, was renewed in Shaikh Khaz^al^s favour j and in 19U2 he was promoted to the rank (Mansab) of Sardar-i-Arfa^ or Field Marshal, his Kasib receiving at the same time the title of Nusrat-ul -Mulk. British and Russian relations with the Shaikh of Muhammareli, 1896-1905. In Shaikh Khaz^al the British Government found a strong and well disposed local ruler whose interests coincided with their own, and their policy towards him was consequently one of support. The principal object of British endeavour in Persia during the period was, as explained in the chapter on the history of the Persian coast and islands, to prevfiDt the extension of Russian influence into the Southern provinces and tbe1755 Shaikhs greatest desire was to maintain his hereditary autonomy against the Persian Central Government in the train of whose officials— this consideration, however, being of less importance to the Shaikh than to 1 ^ the British Government—Russian influence was likely to follow. Immediately on his accession to power in 1897, Shaikh Khaz^al Khan 1897. re f err j n g to a conversation which had taken place between them two aZ ® years earlier, informed Mr. McDonald His Britannic Majesty's Vice-Con- H 1 , sul at Muhammareh, that he had promised to assist British trade, should he ever be in a position to do so, and that he was now prepared to make ' ^ ® good his words; that, though it might not be prudent for him to give public expression to his feelings^ he wished it to be known to the British Government that he was secretly their friend; that it was his desire to serve the British Government; and that, even if he were not ' accepted n fe. as their servant/' he would still render them service in the hope of one t W day profiting thereby. Questioned subsequently as to what he meant, the fen,' i Shaikh explained that, if he were deposed by the Persian Government, he 1,80It might seek a temporary asylum at Bombay, and that, if Persia were to y Hmsl break up, as seemed not improbable in view of the increasing weakness of its Government, the support of the British Government tokst would be of inestimable value to him. Wh ; Shaikh Khaz ; al, after despatching Haji Rais to Tehran to obtain irandi! official recognition for him, promised to instruct that agent to place telf himself in close relations with the British Legation at Tehran with a view to mutual advantage. He also withdrew a steamer which had bomek been run on the Karun by his late brother in opposition to the British ivourjiti firm of Messrs. Lynch. takJ ^ ^ ovem ^ e1, Shaikh, alarmed by an aggressive spirit 1898-99. which he detected in the dealings of the Persian Government with him, and by indications that they aimed at taking the customs of ^Arabistan out of his hands, expressed to His Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consul at [amial Muhammareh a wish to be taken secretly under British protection. He said that he did not mean, at that stage, to press for a written assurance; all he wanted was a verbal intimation that the British Government ng and' acce P te(1 him as ^eir servant and would support him by such means as d, d' tlie Legation at Tehran thought desirable. He did not ask for le prk an alliance against the Persian Government, whom he had faithfully as exflf tll0U g l1 they might not appreciate the fact, and whom he would ^ to f COn ^ Ilue 80 serve. The Persian Government had never interfered 368 J ail Wltil the late Shaikh Miz'al, who always opposed British interests; and1756 it was incumbent on the Biitish Government to support himself; so long as he assisted British trade, and not to allow his influence to be dimi nished by the Persians. He also informed Colonel Meade, the Eesident in the Persian Gulf, who visited him a little later, that he apprehended an early downfall of the Persian monarchy, followed by a general scramble and partition of the kingdom,—eventualities in which he was anxious that his lot should be thrown in with the British Government. His request was referred to His Britannic Majesty^s Minister at Tehran^ under whose instructions Colonel Meade caused the Shaikh to be informed, in May 1899, that His Majesty's Government could not promise to support him against his own Government, nor in case of the dissolution of Persia guarantee his independence or, indeed, say what would happen; but that, as the Shaikh was the most influential chief in that part of Persia, the British Government wished to see him strong, and the Arabs under his authority united ; and that he might therefore rest assured that he would receive the support and advice of the British Minister at Tehran at all times, so far as they could be given consistently with honour towards the Persian Government, the British Government trusting that the Shaikh would in return do all he could to promote British commercial interests. Meanwhile the Government of India, also, had held it to be im possible to give the Shaikh an assurance such as he desired, seeing that Muhammareh was a part of the Persian dominions. In June 1899 a first indication of the interest that Russia took in 'Arabistan was afforded by a visit of Prince Dabija, the Russian Consul General at Isfahan, to Muhammareh, at which it was believed that efforts were made seriously to impress the Shaikh. Sir M. Durand, the British Minister in Persia, visited Northern Arabistan in the autumn of 1899; but his stay at Nasiri was short, and no meeting took place between him and Sheikh Khaz'al. The Sheikh was, however, presented through Colonel Meade with the Royal Victoria Badge, a medal*' in the gift of the British representative in Persia^ and accepted it after a reference to the Persian Government. In 1900, the views of the Central Persian Government in regard to the ''Arabistan Customs having at length been plainly declared, and rumours having become prevalent that the Shaikh was about to be deprived of his large executive powers and absolute tribal authority as ^ Really the Queen's Jubilee Medal of 1887, distribution of which in Persia Vas initiated by Sir H. Drummond Wolff, and which for that reason is sometimes unfor tunately described in Persia as ' the Wolff Medal/'1757 well as of Customs control^ His Britannic Majesty's Charge cPAffaires at Tehran volunteered an offer of mediation^ and the Persian Govern ment availed themselves of it to a limited extent. A disquieting feature in the situation was the arrival of a Russian war vessel in the Persian Gulf in February 1900; and in March the Persian Minister of Customs, M. Naus ; told Mr. Spring-Rice in strict confidence that the Shah in fact wished to put an end to the semi-independence of the Arab tribes in the South of Persia. He added that the Persian Government would prefer ^taking one bite at the Shaikh to taking two ^ that if the Shaikh consented to the Customs arrangements proposed, he would deprive the Persian Government of an excellent pretext for altering his position; and that on the Shah's return from Europe, until which it had been decided to postpone action, serious measures would be taken and a punboat sent to Muhammareh. d Matters remained in suspense during 1901; but in 190^, as already 1902 explained, a peaceful transfer of the 'Arabistan Customs from the Shaikh to the Persian Government took place on terms by no means disadvan tageous to the Shaikh, and a title to almost the whole of Southern ^Arabistan was conferred on him by the Shah. The British Legation did not appear in the negotiations of which this general settlement was the outcome, but their advice was frequently sought by the Shaikh's representative in bringing it to pass. Had there been no extraneous factor in the situation, matters might have rested here; but Haji Rais, the Shaikh's negotiator at Tehran, who remained there from April 1902 to January 1903, was made the object of blandishments and threats directed to the establishment of a Russian protectorate over Muhammareh, or represented such to be the case; and he was urgent in his requests, which in the circumstances could not be neglected, that some additional assurance should be given to his master by the British Government. He referred to the Shaikh of Kuwait, to whose position he desired that of the Shaikh of Muhammareh should be assimilated; and he urged that Shaikh Khaz'al, though he had no fear of the Persian Government, wished to feel sure that the interests of himself and his subjects would be secure, even should a dissolution of Persia take place. In November 1902, it having in the meanwhile become known that a Russian consular representative would presentlv be stationed in 'Arabistan, where Russian trade was non-existent. Sir A. Hardinge, His Britannic Majesty's Minister in Persia, telegraphed to Lord Lansdowne, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that^ unless1758 real confidence in the strength and resolution of the British Governiaent could be instilled into the Shaikh, Russian influence would shortly be found supreme and active at Muhammareh. His recommendations in favour of a less reserved policy with Shaikh Khaz^al were supported bv Lord Curzon, Viceroy and Governor-General of India; and eventually under the authority of His Majesty's Government, the British Minister on the 7th December 1903 addressed the following letter to the Shaikh. I was very glad to hear from Haji Eais-ut-Tirjjar of the satisfactory arrangement concluded between you and the Department of Customs. On general grounds of policy it is very desirable that differences should as far as possible be avoided between the Persian authorities and the Arab tribes under your rule. The relations between the British and Persian Governments are of a friendly character, and the preservation of the integrity and independence of the Persian monarchy has for many years been one of the great objects of British policy in this part of the world. Disturbances of a nature to imperil that object would be a serious evil, and you would gain little and might endanger much by throwing off the sovereignty of the Shah. I am convinced that under the present circumstances the Arabs and yourself, as their ruler, have every interest in cultivating good and loyal relations with the Government of Tehran, and, that the latter has no desire to oppress you or curtail your authority. For this reason I think you acted wisely in giving up the idea of forcible resistance to the establish ment of a Customs house and in seeking rather to come, as I have from the first urged you to, to a friendly understanding on this subject with the Customs administration. Haji Eais-ut-Tujjar has asked me on your behalf to what extent you might rely on the protection of the British Government, and I told him that, so long as you be haved to us in a friendly manner, our influence would be exerted here to maintain you and your tribes in the enjoyment of your hereditary rights and customs, and to dis- suade the Government of Tehran from any endeavour to diminish or interfere witt them. Haji Eais-ut-Tujjar thereupon said that you were not &gt;fraid of the Persian Government itself or of attacks by neighbouring tribes acting or pretending to act under its orders, but that you wished to know whether we should protect you in the event of an attempt by a foreign Power to depose you or deprive your people of the rights which they at present possess. This might happen in two ways ; either such a Power might be at war with Persia and might as an enemy of the Shah send ships to attack your district, or such a Power, pretending to be the friend of the Persian Government or to act in its behalf, might attempt also by means of its ships to con quer you and the Arabs. I replied that both contingencies were extremely unlikely, but, i£ either were to arise, we should, I believed, interfere, provided you had acted in accordance with our advice, and our fleet which is the strongest of any in the Persian Gulf would be employed to prevent any forcible measures against you. I added, how ever, that I would refer the question to the Foreign Minister of the British Govern- ment, and he has now authorised me to say that we shall protect Mohammareh against naval attack by a foreign power, whatever pretext for intervention maybe alleged ; and also, so long as you remain faithful to the Shah and act in accordance with our advice, we will continue to give you our good offices and support. 111759 As I have however said above, I do not regard this danger, at any rate at present, as a real one, The Persian Government desires, I am sure, as earnestly as we do the preservation of peace in Arabistan; and the establishment of a Castoms house at Mobammareh is, as I assured you last year, a fiscal, not a political, measure. It bas already informed me in a friendly spirit of the conditions under which the new arrangement has been made, and the British Government has instructed me to intim ate its acquiescence in them. We reserve of course our rigbt to object to any further change which we may con sider likely, as affecting peace and trade on the Karun, to be detrimental to our interests. I hope that the new arrangement may work smoothly. There will very likely be some small difficulties and friction at first, but I trust to your wisdom and judgment to deal with them prudently and patiently. Our Consul has my orders to afford you all help and advice, and you may place every reliance on my friendship. Toucan write to me freely should you wish to do so as well as to the Resident at Bushire. Meanwhile, on the 1st December 190^ His Britannic Majesty^s Minister at Tehran had a conversation with the head of the Persian Government concerning ''Arabistan affairs, which he reported in these terms: I spoke to the Grand Vizier on the first instant about Mohammareh and referred to the two notes which Mr. des Graz had addressed on the subject to the Mushir-ed- Dowleh, and the last of which had not yet been answered. His Highness then endeavoured to argue that our interests were not affected by any changes in the position of the Sheikh, who was a local Governor like any other. I said I hoped he would allow me to be frank with him on the subject. I had no wish to call in question the Shah's sovereignty over the Chief or people of Moham mareh, which His Majesty's Government had always recognised. Our experience in Seistan had, however, been a lesson in the effects on our interests which a Russian Consul and Belgian Customs officials, who were not always judicious, could produce at the residence of a remote and ill-informed Persian Governor. On the Karun, as in Seistan, the Russians had no bona fide commercial interests, and their recent appointment of a Consul could have only political objects. We are determined not to have, if we could help it, another Seistan in Mohammareh, and to let Sheikh Khazal therefore understand that, if Russian agents attempted to intimi date him, or insinuate that they could bring pressure to bear on him owing to the influence which they exercised at Tehran, we on our side were ready to support him. It was because threats of this kind had been used by Prince Dabija, Russian Consul at Ispahan, when he visited Mohammareh, that I had felt obliged to intimate to the Sheikh that our naval forces in the Gulf were more powerful than those of Russia and that they might be employed in certain eventualities for the purpose of maintaining the status quo in which he anji we were alike interested. And on the 5th December Sir A. Hardinge had addressed the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs as follows :1760 I communicated the account of what had passed between His Highness and myself to Lord Lansdowne, who has now instructed me to make the following declaration to your Excellency for the information of the Persian Government and with a view of making our position in this matter perfectly elear : (1) The British Government has never doubted the absolute character of the Shah's sovereignty over the territory, ruler, and people of Mohammareh. Any suspicion which the Persian Government may have been led to entertain that we sought to establish any analogy between the position of the Sheikh of Mohammareh and that of the Sheikhs of Bahrein or Koweit or to distingaish between it and that of 1 other Persian Governors, such for instance, to cite. Your Excellency's own illustra- tion in conversation with Mr. des Graz, as the Chief of Kucban, can only have been j suggested by persons desirous of sowing distrust betw^ea the two friendly States. 1 We recognise in the fullest manner that His Excellency the Sirdar Arfa is a Persian I subject and a servant of His Imperial Majesty the Shah. (2) At the same time the important interests which Great Britain possesses in the south of Persia preclude us from viewing with indifference any changes in the 1 system of Government in the province of Arabistan, which by causing trouble among the Arab tribes may endanger our trade and the security of foreign subjects, or afford occasion for interference by other powers and thus oblige us, on our side, to take active steps for the protection of British rights. But it must again reserve its light, in the event of further changes which it could not view with equal approbation, to make friendly representations with regard to I them to the Persian Government, and if need be, take such other ulterior steps as j it may deem requisite for the protection of British interests, both political and commercial, should these in its opinion be threatened. It is glad, however, to take He 1 opportunity of expressing its confidence in the friendly assarances which His High- j ness the Atabeg has renewed to it, and which on its side it is happy to reciprocate . These observations were not resented by the Mushir-ud-Dauleh, who replied on the 13th January 1903 to the British Minister: I have had the pleasure of receiving your Excellency's letter of the 9th (and 6tli) j January last, and have with satisfaction made myself acquainted with the contents which Sigoify the sincere friendship between the two Governments, and I would now express my own heartfelt satisfaction at the friendly assurances exchanged between the two Powers : and I trust that the harmony and sincerity which have for so long existed between the two Powers may be still further strengthened, and that th°e friendly feelings between the authorities of both powers may, as always, tend to an increased amity. In December 1903 Sir A. Hardinge, who had then recently parted from Lord Curzon, the Viceroy and Governor-General of India, in the Persian Gulf, and who was returning to Tehran Muha.n naroh andMl 1761 ^ Baehdad, telegraphed to the Foreign OflSee in London and to Lord ^ flu atacfejii mareli, j Curzon that the Muhammareh question again seemed likely to become acute at the same time mentioning the complaints which the Shaikh made at this time about breaches by the Persian Government of their understanding with him. The Shaikh wanted to know definitely 'tain tk whether the British Government would support him in resisting Mok encroachment, if necessary, by forbidding the Persian Government to itaa^, employ force against him, should he on his part repudiate the under- 0WI1 in standing because the Persians had not observed it. Sir A. Hardinge inlyb 1 ;, was in favour of some assurance being given, especially as Russia was M gtin bidding for the Shaikh's good graces. Eventually, after receiving faisaJt! the instructions of His Majesty's Government, Sir A. Hardinge wrote to the Shaikh from Baghdad on the 24th December 1903 : on whicU Lord Lansdowne says that if, as he presumes is the case from my account of your troulileiE Excellency's statement to me, the Persian Government is really attempting to repu diate the arrangement made with you last year, I am authorised to say that you tfl ; are in his opinion justified in opposing such attempt. He instructs me to remind yow of the message which he sent you last year, and to add that you may rest assured of the support of the British Government so long as you on your side observed the conditions of the arrangement made between the Persian Government and yourself. witli regit He has authorised me to point out to that Government the necessity for respecting ulterior si the conditions of the arrangement on their side, but I do not propose to do so until I ii political! tear further from you, as I think it will be better in the interests of good relations iver totj b 0 ^ 6611 the Persian authorities and yourself that our intervention should not be invoked ch His I 0 ^ er 11168,118 adjusting matters between them and you have been exhausted. reciprocal In the next year Russian activity in 'Arabistan rather increased 1904. ru( j]) al | than diminished. In January 1904 a party of three Russian travellers, j_ er who gave themselves out to be entomologists and one of whom was a well-known Russian emissary, M. Zaroudni, arrived at Nasiri from ^, Isfahan ; and in February they voyaged down the Bahmanshir, which iththeJ ^ surve yed and sounded visiting Qubban and exploring 'Abbadan ad I wo# I^nd, and eventually returning northwards by way of Dizful. In langedfe March M. Passek, the Russian Consul-General at Bushehr, paid a bveforvisit to Muhammareh and invested the Shaikh with the Order of St. , and tkt Stanislaus of the first class. A document which accompanied this wysM decoration recited, as reasons for its being granted, the Shaikhs enlightened policy and his wisdom in consenting to the establishment of the Imperial Persian Customs in his jurisdiction. M. Passek also made a tour to entlj F Ahwaz and Shushtar. About the same time the Muhammareh A gency [ndia; 1 of the Russian steamer line in the Persian Gulf was transferred from unareh a 1 g l1762 Mr. ter Meulen, Russian Consular Agent in 'Arabistan, to a son of Haji Eais, the Shaikh's principal adviser ; and the Shaikh himself had become, or feigned to have become, doubtful of the value of the assurances that he had received from the British Government. In August the soi disant Prince Anatouni, an Armenian Russian subject and Attache in the Russian Ministry of Commerce, travelled up the Karun as far as Shushtar; his mission was ostensibly commercial, but he was obviously ignorant of mercantile affairs. The Russian Consular Agent appointed to 'Arbistan in 1902 was Mr, P. ter Meulen, a Dutch merchant. He arrived at Nasiri in December of that year and, except for an absence on leave from January to June 1905, remained continuously in the province through* out the period. He did not, however, show himself a particularly efficient representative of Russian interests. Without energy or discre tion, of doubtful honesty, and not very successful in private trade, his relations with the Shaikh of Muhammareh, with Haji Rais, with the Karguzar, and even with the Imperial Persian Customs were un- firiendly, and at one time his disagreements with the first two reached such a point that the Russian Consul-General at Bushehr had to intervene as peacemaker. Relations of other European powers with 'irabistan, 1896-1905. Almost the only Europeans of significance, not British or Russian whose presence was remarked in e Arabistan were some French archaeologists engaged, from 1897 onwards, in excavations at Sbush under the direction of M. de Morgan. The country in their neighbour hood being much disturbed, they found it necessary to immure them selves in a kind of castle near the scene of their labours; and they took no active interest in political affairs. The activity of M. van Roggen, a Dutch engineer, is noticed further on in connection with irrigation projects in the province. British political cases and interests in 'Arabistan, 1896-1905. Political cases in 'Arabistan concerning the British Government1014 1763 chiefly arose, during the period under consideration, from the insecurity which generally prevailed in Northern 'Arabistan, The stafce of that sub-province in 1896-97 was, as we have already Murderous seen, one of chaos; and British subjects and firms were among the Mr. Tanfield» cnffprers from the universal disorder, the impunity of the Persian of a suucicis . . . caravan of soldiers who had attacked Messrs. Lynch s at Nasiri in 1895 affording, Messrs. it would seem, special encouragement to outrages against them. In and June 1896 a brutal and murderous midnight attack was made at Messp. Shushtar upon Mr, Tanfield, an employ^ of Messrs. Lynch, by a atshash^r, Persian subject in his service; he escaped with his life, but fearfully 1896-97. mutilated. Such an incident might have occurred under any Govern ment ; but this one was invested with an exceptional character by the conduct of a crowd who, on the following day, pursued with yelis and stone-throwing a party conveying the wounded man to a steamer. Mr. Tanfield^s assistant was arrested, but at first nothing further was done; and it was only after the outrage had become the subject of diplomatic repiesentations that the offender was removed to Tehran and there imprisoned. The Nizam-us-Saltaneh, Governor-General of the province, and his brother and deputy, the Sa^ad-ul-Mulk, who had shown gross negligence if not prejudice in their treatment of the case, were removed from office. In January 1897 a mob, after pillaging a caravan belonging to Messrs. Lynch on its way between Shushtar and Shalaili, the anchorage for steamers, invaded and completely sacked the office of Messrs. Hotz, a Dutch firm under British protection, in the town. Shortly afterwards order was in some measure restored by the A'la- ud-Douleh, who succeeded the Nizam-us-Saltaneh as Governor-General; but no compensation was obtained by Messrs. Lynch or Messrs. Hotz for their losses. In 1898 it was still impossible for any European to reside at Sbushtar. On the night of the 5th September 1902 the ' Shushan' ,&gt; *steamer, Attacks on owned by His Majesty the Shah but worked by Messrs. Lynch and ^'and 8 ' commanded at the time by Captain King, was attacked by a gang of 40 insecurity on Arabs of the Khasraj section of the Bani Lam tribe, who fired about 70 K5ranfl902 shots into the vessel, fatally wounding a deckman and killing a boy who '05. were on board. The wood work of the cabins was riddled with shot *The Shushan ' is known among the Arabs of the country as the 'Slugi-al-Kartln M (Greyhound of the Karun), also by the more opprobrious names of ' Abu -Az-al-Hamar' (Possessor of the Red Posterior) and ' Khanzir-al-Hamar ' (Red Pig)» these last appellations referring to the colour of her stern wheel. 121 A1764 holes and the funnel, too, was pierced. The robbers entered the vessel and remained about an hour on board her, pillaging the cargo and effects of the crew, after which they decamped with their booty. There was a guard of three Persian soldiers on board when the attack took place, but they fled at the approach of the marauders ; one of them was wounded. After this the ^Shushan^ was supplied with a Persian military guard of ten men by the A^am-us-Saltaneh, Governor of Northern ^Arabistan, who promised that troops would shortly arrive to restore security; but none came. The Persian authorities excused themselves for not taking measures against the Khasraj on the ground that they were Turkish subjects. On the 17th May 1903 the &lt;f Shushan^ was again fired on at Shalaili. On the 15th April 1904 a third attack on the Shushan^ occurred, again at Shalaili, the vessel being moored to the bank and having 10,000 Qrans in specie on board at the time. The affair began at 8-30 p. m. with the discharge of 50 or 60 shots from some high ground, to which no reply could be made as there were intending passengers with mules and donkeys on the bank alongside. The raiders, numbering about 50, next rushed down from the high ground ; and, while some of them turned their attention to the passengers on shore, the rest poured a hot fire into the body of the ship. Those of the ; passengers who could meanwhile began to escape across the river in cargo boats, and the Persian guard, to gain time, opened a parley with the leader of a group of about ten Arabs who had approached the gang way, dagger in hand. Captain Maclure, the Commander, and two deck- men, armed with rifles, posted themselves in the engine-room ; and the Persian guard also made ready. On the leader of the Arabs shouting to his men to rush the ship^ about 20 more came up; the Persian guard then fired a volley by Captain Maclure's order; the Arab leader fell dead; and the rest of the robbers beat a hasty retreat, leaving his body behind. Shots continued to be exchanged until 10-30 p. m . ; but there was no further attempt at boarding. The vessel was undoubtedly saved by the good behaviour of the Persian guard, commanded by Muhammad Hassan, Vakil-Bashi. On board two women passengers had been killed, and one wounded; 1 on shore one mule and four donkeys had been carried off; and the damage done to the woodwork and funnel of the ship was estimated at £50.1765 The ' Shushan ^ left for Nasiri the next morning with the corpse of the Arab leader, which was handed over to the Shaikh of Muhammarelr's representative there for identification. It appeared that the offenders on this occasion, as in 190^ were Khasraj, and that there was an under-^ standing between them and the Arab inhabitants of the Miyanab. The latter fact made the navigation of the Gargar, with its narrow and com manded channel, a dangerous undertaking for the future ; and, Captain Maclure ; s contract with Messrs. Lynch having expired, and there being some risk of retaliation against him, his employers made no objection to his quitting their service. Representations as to the insecurity of the upper Karun having been made by His Britannic Majesty^s Minister at Tehran, the Persian Govern ment requested the Shaikh of Muhammareh, as there was for the moment no Persian Governor-General of ''Arabistan, to undertake tem porarily the task of assuring order. He agreed and sent 400 Arab horsemen to serve at Shushtar and Dizful; of these 60 were stationed at Shalaili to supply mounted escorts on land for steamers on the upper river. Under these arrangements security quickly returned; and in June the a Shushan ^ resumed her voyages, which had been discon tinued. On the arrival of the A^zam-us-Saltaneh as Governor-General, the Shaikhs men were withdrawn from Shushtar and Dizful, but he was prevailed on to leave a guard at Shalaili for some time longer. The Shaikh estimated the cost of protecting the river between Ahwaz and Shalaili at 1,000 Tumans or R^SGO a month; and, though averse from employing men of his own permanently outsiie his jurisdiction, lie was willing to undertake the duty if his expenses were guaran teed; but, so far from this being done, he did not even receive payment for the services he had rendered. The thanks of the Shah, conveyed to bim in a letter from a Minister, were his only reward. There appeared little prospect of the A^zam-us-Saltaneh, whose whole military resources consisted of a bodyguard of 80 Shahsavan horsemen, not to mention 50 armed road^-guards whose services were required else where, being able to police the upper Karun effectively; and long dis cussions followed among the British authorities in Persia as to the nieasures which the Persian Government or the Shaikh of Muhammareh should be induced to take. There was a general concensus of opinion faiat the Shaikh, whose influence—though his actual jurisdiction ended a short way above Band-i-Qir—extended to the Arab tribes east of the Diz, would prove the most efficient agent in the matter ; but, as it was1766 improbable that the Persian Government would 'consent to pay for his services; the question became one of a subsidy being granted him by the British Government. Sir A. Hardinge, the British Minister in Persia, pronounced in favour of such a grant; but meanwhile outrages had ceased to occur, and, with the arrival of the Sardar-i-Mu^azzam in the following spring. Northern 'Arabistan came under a strong and, from the British point of view, not altogether unsatisfactory regime. British commercial and general interests, 1896-1905. During this period, exception being made of the Anglo-Dutch firm of Messrs. Hotz, European trade was represented in ^Arabistan by the British firm of Messrs. Lynch only. In 1899 Messrs. Lynch were represented at Dizful for some months by a British employ^, but he was withdrawn, and in 1905 their sole European representative in the province was one at Nasiri. Embargoes The system of embargoes on exportation of food stuffs continued in port of pro- full vigour, and few seasons were entirely exempt from its application. 1905* 1^ was frequently so worked as to enable Persian officials to buy grain cheap and then export it themselves. A noteworthy^ instance of this occurred in 1900. 1896. j n J un e 1896 the embargo on grain which had been temporarily raised was imposed again by the Governor General, but almost imme diately an intimation was received through the British Legation at Tehran of its removal by the central Government. 1897. The following harvest in ^Arabistan was a good one, but prices continued to rise, chiefly in consequence of a short crop in Mesopotamia; and in January 1897 a prohibition of the exportation of food grains, to come into effect two months later, was notified; but it was not enforced on the Karun till April, The ensuing harvest being poor, the embargo on grain continued, causing much inconvenience to British firms who had advanced money to cultivators ; but ultimately sesame seed was excepted from the interdict. 1898-1900. This embargo continued into 1898, notwithstanding that the coming crop was an excellent one; and at the beginning of 1900 the Resident in the Persian Gulf wrote that agricultural prospects in ^Arabistan were * See Mr. V. Chirol's Middle Eastern Question, pages 166-167.1767 extremely favourable, and that if only the embargo on wheat were removed the prosperity of the district should rapidly increase. The summer of 1900 was signalised, however, by a particularly vexatious During the earlier years of the period at least, the operations of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company were carried on at a loss, in spite of a subsidy paid them by the British and Indian Govern ments, to which reference will be made further on. Leaving the subsidy out of account, the deficit on their ordinary business in 'Arabistan amounted (by their own statement) to £35,460 for ten years from 1890 to 1899 inclusive, besides which they were unable to obtain payment from the Persian Treasury of £4,,623, the amount of loss incurred by them in working the ' Shushan ' for the Shah from the beginning of 1891 to the end of 1898. Altogether they calnlated their net losses in 'Arabistan from the 1st January 1890 to the 31st December 1899, after deducting: the amount of the subsidy, at * £31,447. On the upper river between Ahwaz and Shalaili the Nasiri Com pany, in other words the Mu'in-ut-Tujjar, still continued in 1905 to run a steamer and declined, when approached, to transfer their rights to the British Company or to enter into partnership, unless on un- acceptable terms. The Persian Government also continued to be obstructive, and it was only at the end of 1905 that permission was with difficulty obtained to remove some supposed rocks, which proved to be masonry, Jrom the bed of the lower Karun at Kut ^Abdullah ; the construction of sheds for cargo at Shalaili was not allowed ; and the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company could not obtain a concession, for which they applied, to lay a tramway between Shalaili and Shustar. In 1905, however, Messrs. Lynch were able to secure an extension for six years from 1907 of a lease which they had obtained from the Persian G-overnment of suitable business premises at Muhammareh. known as the Bandar Sahib-Qraniyeh. On assuming charge of the Customs of ''Arabistan in September 1902, the Imperial administration closed the river Customs houses at Nasiri and Shushtar, and insisted that all duty on upward and downward ♦This sum, however, included over £7,000 sunk in the BakhtiyS-ri Road {vide post), a profitable investment; and Messrs.

This innovation deranged all through traffic arrangements and was excessively incon venient to up-country merchants who had not agents at Muhammareli. A protest was accordingly lodged by the British Legation at Tehran founded on the assurances given by the Persian Government in 1890 When the Shushan ^ was presented to His Majesty the Shah ; and the custom house at Nasiri was provisionally re-opened in Novembei 1902, and that at Shushtar in February ]903. The Persian Government argued that the indulgence granted in 1890 was not intended to be permanent, and that it had only been made because the goods of European merchants then paid a higher duty on entry into the country than those of Persian subjects, which had ceased to be the case. In the end, however, they withdrew their objections and the custom houses at Nasiri and Shushtar were definitevely re-established in April 1903. On the £8th May 1901 an oil exploitation concession was obtained by Mr. 'W. K. D ; Arcy, a British capitalist, from the Persian Govern ment ; it conferred on him a monopoly of working mineral oil, natural gas, asphalt and ozokerit, and an exclusive right of laying pipe lines for the conveyance of oil, throughout Persia with the exception of a few of the northern provinces. A D^Arcy Oil Exploitation Company was then formed, between whom and the Bakhtiyari Khans an agreement was concluded on the 15th November 1905, providing for the facilita tion and protection of operations by the Khans in return for an annual payment of £2,000 rising to £3,000, besides which the Khans might claim, on payment, 3 per cent, of the Company's ordinary shares after the production of oil had begun.

In 1897 a sixty years' '^concession was grated by the Persian Govern ment to some of the Khans of the Bakhhtyari tribe for the construc tion, maintennce, and exploitation of a road through their country from Ahwaz to Isfahan, and of another from Shushtar to Isfahan.

Lynch, and guaranteed by the Persian Qovernment, for the construction and maintenance of the (Ahwaz Isfahan) road by the British firm for the Bakhtiyari concessionnaires on tendeit certain financial and other conditions. The contract cost of the road hgoi was £5 ; 500, but might be increased by mutual consent of the parties ; the « and the actual expenditure incurred to about the middle of 1899 was ! ase, Ii £7,333. The length of the road as completed was 277 miles, reducing istomii the journey to 15 or 18 marches; it passed through very difficult prilll mountainous country ; and one of its principal features was an iron ™ oli suspension bridge over a remarkable gully at Godar-i-Balutak, The sianfc road was opened for traffic in December 1899. A toll-collecting station oil, m was established at Godar-i-Balutak, and in 1903 the Bakhtiyari Khans gpipet were said to have leased it to a contractor at 8,000 Tumans for the tionofil year. An increasing trade upon the road was quickly established. Some )inpaiijt trouble arose, however, between the Bakhtiyari Khans and Messrs.

A British representative had for the first time been posted to Nasiri (Ahwaz) at the beginning of 1904 in the person of Lieutenant D. L. R. Lorimer of the Indian Political Department; and the most immediate and principal duty of this officer was to ascertain the measures required for carrying the Tehran-Ahwaz road through Liuristan, and for assuring its safety in that section. He had orders to report on the feasibility of raising a corps of local road-guards, capable of being expanded into a tribal militia for political purposes. Lieutenant Lorimer travelled safely from Ahwaz to Khurramabad and back again in the spring of 1904, under tribal protection, and submitted a preliminary report; he had been well received by the tribes; and the prospects of success at this time appeared favourable. In autumn of the same year he again made his way without mishap to Khurramabad, where he met Colonel Douglas, the British Military Attache at Tehran; but on the 25tli October 1904, in marching from Khurramabad to Dizful, the two officers were treacherously attacked by their own escort of Dirakwand Lurs, were both severely wounded besides being robbed of all their property, and barely escaped with their lives to Burujird, where they received medical attention. A substantial indemnity for this outrage was demanded on their behalf by His Majesty^s Government, and the Persian Government declared their intention of organising a punitive expedition againsc the Dirakwand, but took no effective action. In July 1905, with the help of certain chiefs of the Sagward Lurs, the Persian authorities enticed some of the men concerned in the attack into Khurramabad by promises of honours and gifts, arrested them and sent them to Kirmanshah, where they were imprisoned. The Bakhtiayari Khans expressed great concern at the outrage and offered to undertake, on terms which they specified, the punishment of the offenders, and even the pacification of the Lur country ; but their offers, which were not entertained, probably outran their powers of per formance. On return to his post from leave, before the end of 1905, Captain Lorimer was able to resume negotiations with the Sagwand, but not with the Dirakwand Lurs.1771 yh id to j: British official matters in 'Arabistan, 1896-1905. d,[ ^ immfl • ltes The period was one of much British official activity in Arnhistan.

His Britannic Majesty^s first Vice-Consul for ; Arabistan was Lieutenant D. L. E. Lorimer of the Indian Political Department, who assumed charge of his duties in January 1904. Mr. McDouall became Consul at Muhammareh with effect from the 23rd February 1904. One of the first questions which it was necessary to decide in con nection with the establishment of a British Vice-Consulate for ; Arabistan was where to locate the new officer's permanent headquarters. Lieut enant Lorimer, on being consulted, recommended Ahwaz (Nasiri) in preference to any other place, remarking: Ahwaz is of no importance as a native community, but the Sheikh* spends the winter near it, and it is the last point which is in direct touch with the outer world. It is Lynch's head-quarters in South-Western Persia. It is the starting point of tlie Bakhtiari road, as well as of the route to Shushtar and Dizful. Whatever the align ment adopted for the Khurramabad road, Ahwaz will be its real terminus. The earliest reports of any occurrences affecting the safety of our traffic are naturally brought here to Messrs. Lynch's Agent, who also acts forthe Persian Transport Company. Ahwaz will necessarily remain the head-quarters of all British concerns, and it is unlikely that any companies will post European Agents to any other places suoli as Dizfal. In any case, the head management will always be situated at Ahwaz, which is in fact the port of ^Arabistan, Luristan, and the Bakhtiari route. British medical officer for 'Arabistan, 1904-iy05. Lieutenant Lorimer's opinion was accepted by the Grovernment of India. He further proposed that native houses should be rented at Shushtar, Dizful, Khurramabad, and Ramuz for occupation by the Vice-Consul on tour. Some difficulty was experienced in obtaining a suitable site for the British Vice-Consulate at Nasiri. It was decided in 1904 that an officer of the Indian Medical Service should be deputed to Persia as Consular Surgeon at Ahwaz and Kirmanshah, and it was intended that lie should, inter alia i afford medical assistance to the Bakhtiyari Khans, who had frequently ex pressed a wish for the services of a European doctor. The combination of duties thus arranged afterwards proved to be impracticable, 'in conse quence of the great distance and difficulty of communication between the two pla.ces intended to be served ; and the officer sent, being posted in the first instance to Kirmanshah, was not seen in 'Arabistan. * Sc. of Muhammareh. r1773 It was ordered in 1904^ under the general scheme for British consular guards in Persia, that a detachment of 12 sabres of Indian Cavalry should be sent to ^Arabistan as an escort for the Vice-Consul. This guard was despatched in due course, but it unfortunately arrived too late to accompany Lieutenant Lorimer on the journey on which he and Colonel Douglas were attacked by the Dirakwand. In September 1899, the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company (Messrs. Lynch), whose financial difficulties in ; Arabistan have already been mentioned, applied for the continuation for another five years of the subsidy of £'2,000 per annum granted to them in 1894 at the joint expense of His Majesty's Government and the Government of India. The Government of India consented to make one more contribution, viz., for the calender year 1900, but declined to do more, observing in a despatch to His Majesty's Secretary of State for India : We cannot agree to prolong the contribution beyond the year 1900, and we would once more call Your Lordship's attention to the inequity of an arrange ment whereby Indian revenues not only meet half the Karun subsidy, in which Indian interests, if they can be said to exist at all, are insigni ficant, but also bear the whole charge for the Euphrates Tigris subsidy, in whose object the Imperial Government is at least equally, and indeed in our opinion more vitally, concerned. Meanwhile the report of a Royal Commission on the expenditure of the Government of India, which had been sitting since 1897, was sub mitted. Their conclusion in regard to the Karuu subsidy was that, if the Government of India maintained the Baghdad-Basrah service, the charge for the Karun service should be borne by Great Britain.

M. van Roggen made1774 a preliminary examination of the ground in the winter of 1903^04 and then returned to Tehran^ where his project was favourably received by the Persian Government ; but the Shah, while approving of it provided it could be carried out by Persian enterprise^ was strongly averse from granting a concession for its execution by a foreign company. The Shaikh of Muhammareh was opposed to the scheme, unless it were executed by himself or by the British Grovernment, and he professed to fear that it might injure date cultivation on the lower Karun and Bahmanshir. The British Government were concerned at the prospect of any reduction in the volume of the Karun, which was already hardly sufficient to maintain navigability at certain seasons. In a minute, dated 1st August 1904, Lord Curzon, then Viceroy of India, remarked : Any sach scheme, if successfallj carried out, will pracfcically destroy the Karrni as a navigable river, and will put an effectual stopper upon on the enterprise o£ Messrs. Lynch. Even now the depth of water is only 3 feet in many places, and th3 steamers rud agroand constantly on their way up to Ahwaz. A redaction of even 6 inches in tte depth would block navigation for the four months from August to December. Our Indian experience in the Punjab has shown that large navigable rivers, such as the Jumna, Eavi, Chenab, Sutlej and Jhelum, are drained quite dry for most of the year by big irrigation schemes, and I entertain little doubt that this also would be the fate of the Karun. His Majesty's Government must, therefore, balance the advantages to be derived from irrigation against the damage that will be inflicted upon British commerce. It is obvious that, if Messrs. Lynch are pushed out, and if their place is taken by Belgian officials and Dutch engineers or concessionnaires working a big irrigation project in purely selfish or in anti-British interests, we should be vpry greatly the losers by the change. On the other hand, if we had a substantial or preponderating voice in the control we might be able to replace one form of commercial activity by another j and might open up another route for navigation to the plains of 'Arabistan by utilising the Khor Musa, or one of the adjoining inlets which we have recently explored, and hy making new roads from thence into the interior. What I have said emphasises the supreme importance of British participation anil joint control in any Karun irrigation scheme, if it is to be started, but conversely abo the striking danger to British interest that would result if we were left out of sight in any such enterprise. At the end of 1904 Mr. van Roggen, who thoroughly appreciated the desirability of obtaining British co-operation, and who during a visit to Europe had endeavoured to interest the British Foreign Office in his project, returned to Ahwaz with two European assistants, and pro' ceeded to elaborate his plans.1775 to y com® lace is i In February 1905, under instructions from the Persian Government; Deputation who had meanwhile been approached by the British Legation, M. van Morton^E.E.,,. Roggen explained his project in detail to Major W. E. Morton, E.E., 1904.05^' an officer of the Punjab Irrigation Department who had been deputed from India, on behalf of the Government of India and His Majesty's Government to study the prospects of the scheme and its probable influence upon navigation. M. van Eoggen's plans were found to be technically grotesque, and financially extravagant, if not impossible. They involved the excavation of reservoirs with a capacity of over ^000,000,000 cubic feet for the sake of irrigating an area of not more than 85,000 acres,—a circumstance which, coupled with the fact that the operations were to be spread over a period of 24 years, sufficed to stamp the scheme as unremunerative. As it seemed probable, however, that an irrigable area of much more than 85,000 acres might be commanded from the Karun at Ahwaz, Major Morton, after he had exploded M. van Eoggen^s scheme, was ordered to collect data on which an alternative project might be framed, if required.

The history down to tlie year 1763 of what is styled throughout Gazetteer ' the Persian Coast, and Islands^ that is of the whole southern coast of Persia except so much as is included in ^Arabistan or Makran, this has been given in the chapter on the general history of the Gulf; but from 1763 onwards^ for reasons which are there explained, it is necessary to deal separately with the history of the Persian Coast; and the present chapter is added chiefly with that purpose. The general affairs of the Persian kingdom after 1763, however, in so far as they call for notice, will also be treated of in this chapter, as finding in it a more appropriate place than in the histories of the outlying Persian provinces of ^Arabistan and Makran.

In 1763 his authority extended, though not in an absolute manner, to the whole or nearly the whole of the country ; and from that year until the end of his reign, notwithstanding the jealousy of the Qajars of the north, it was never seriously disputed by any rival. Satisfied with the possession of royal power, Karim Khan prudently did not usurp the royal title, but continued to govern as Vakil or regent on behalf of the nominal Shah, whom he kept in confinement. His government was distinguished by moderation, combined with firmness and efficiency ; the welfare of the subject was at all times his principal care; and he reaped a rich reward, both in the prosperity which the country enjoyed under his rule and in the respect which was felt for his memory after his death. In short, the reputation to which he attained among the sovereigns of Persia,— for such, apart from a political fiction observed by himself, he must certainly be considered—was as admirable and as well deserved as it was uncommon and even unique. Shiraz, which throughout the reign of Karim Khan was his capital and his almost constant resi dence, profited more than any other part of his dominions by his liberal expenditure on public works and by the general enlighten ment of his ideas ; and its inhabitants were the most attached to him of all his subjects. Less is known of the private than of the public character of Karim Khan; but, while judgment and calculation were predominant traits aad generally regulated his actions, he appears none the less to have been humane, even kindly, and sincere. Karim Khan made considerable use, as will appear from the sequel, of the services of his brothers * or half-brothers, Sadiq Khan and Zaki Khan. The former of these was in direct charge of the capital at the time of the establishment of a British Residency at Bushehr in 1763 and also of Niebuhr's visit to SKiraz in 1765, and he afterwards conducted operations against Lar in 1766 and against Basrah in 1775-76 ; while the latter, who was the Vakil s half-brother and cousin only, had charge of an expedition to Kangun in 1767, of another to Ganaveh in 1769, and of a third to Bandar Abbas in 1773. Karim Khan died in 1779 at the age, as was supposed, of seventy-five or eighty years. The foreign policy of Karim Khan related chiefly to 'Oman and Turkish 'Iraq; and his endeavours between 1769 and 1779 to extort su bmission from the Imam of 'Oman, as also the invasion of 'Iraq by to d' Was ol^Gi* than Karim Khan, but would probably never have risen istmction had it not been for his brother the Vakil.

J1778 his troops in 1775 and their occupation of Basrali beginniag in 1776, are described in the separate histories of the countries concerned. It is possible that the VakiPs activity abroad had, for one of its Gbjects ; the employment of the armed forces of Persia at a distance from home, and the removal by that means of a standing danger to the peace of his dominions; indeed, without this explanation, his aggressions on the ruler of ; Oman would appear out of harmony with his generally pacific spirit. Various circumstances brought Karim Khan into contact with the British power, also, in the Persian Gulf; and of these circumstances, and of the relations to which they gave rise, we now proceed to supply a short account, touching lightly on matters which belong rather to the history of ^Iraq or of ; Arab is tan than to that of the Persian Coast. Relations between the British power and Persian central Government, with especial reference to affairs upon the Persian Coast, 1763-79. At the beginning of the period on which we have entered, the inter course of the East India Company with Persia had been completely, though temporarily, suspended. There was no correspondence on foot, on any subject, between the representatives of the Company and the de facto ruler of Persia ; and the Company^s last important settlement* in the country, their Agency at Bandar ^Abbas, had been closed and removed to Turkish territory. It appears, however, that the Govern ment of Bombay—whether with or without the previous sanction of the Court of Directors at home— had resolved, even before the withdrawal of the Bandar ^Abbas Agency, to institute in its stead a Residency at Bushehr ; and the period of the Company's total absence from Persia was, consequently, a very short one. Mr. Price's In January 1763 the authorities at Bombay selected Mr. William ttaChUf and ^ n( irew Price to proceed to the Gulf as u Provisional Agent of Persia/ ; establishment for the purpose of enquiring into serious defalcations that had come to of a Residen- i- ,, , -r, , , cy at Bushehr, l ^ght at Basrah \ and, as the powers of the regular Agent, Mr. Douglas, April! 1 1763. were to be in abeyance during his visit, Mr. Price was also instructed to arrange for the establishment of the Residency at Bushehr, 'm order • A Linguist, however, appears to have remained at Kirmanj who was not ^ithdraffP till afterwards.1779 Qnitl gi: mor e particularly to introduce the vend of Woollen Goods into the lCeri ^ j Kingdom of Persia.' , ' , Mr. Price arrived off Bandar ^ Abb as on the evening of the 24th of 6 ^ March^ when guns were fired and blue lights burned on board his vessel, 10 P e ^ ; ^ Tartar but no answering signal was received from the shore. 68810118! On the following morning, as up to ten o^clock no boat had come aloug- ^Qeralji ^ roadstead also being empty of vessels and no British flag any where visible^ Mr. Price, who rightly inferred that the Agency had i been withdrawn after hostilities, caused a Dutch ensign to be hoisted wcisl and a gun fired. By this means communication with the land was Qeeedtof quickly established, and full information of what had occurred was W obtained from a servant of the late Agency. So far, however, were the a11 Const local Persian authorities from wishing to carry on the quarrel between i the Company and themselves that the Governor of Bandar 'Abbas invite Mr, Price to visit him on shore,— an invitation which, howeve;p, does M Mi n0 ^ Seem ^ a ' ve ^ een accepted,—and Mulla 'Ali Shah of Qishm, on the rs Ufd USUa ^ s ^ na ^ being made, supplied a pilot for the Clarence Strait, and even sent a present of fowls and almonds on board the Agent's vessel. A few days later the Tartar ' reached Bushehr; and on the 7th of April a son of Shaikh Sa'dun, who was in charge of the town during tere^tk the absence of his father and of his father's brother Shaikh Nasir, eencomf visited Mr. Price on board ship, persuaded him to land, treated him on mdencei; shore ' with great politeness and civility/' and discussed with him the upanjail conditions on which a British settlement might be formed at Bushehr, ant set The negotiations thus begun were continued with Shaikh Sa'dun himself, beenclfi ^ ^eet whom, as he was at a distance, Mr. Price deputed one Stephen at tie Hermit, the Linguist of the late Bandar ''Abbas Agency ; and the result sanctioii was the conclusion of an Agreement* in the sense desired, on the 12th the A 1763. On the 22nd of April, Mr, Price appointed Mr. B. Jervis, a Be# w ^ om ^ad brought with him in the Tartar,' to the office of nee from ^ es ^ent at Bushehr ; after which he caused an artillery officer and a small military guard to be landed, a for protecting the Hon'ble Company's gdJIr.l ^ 00&lt; i s an d giving a credit to their affairs^, and himself sailed for Basrah, rent of ^ ^ le ^ &gt;10v isional Agent's opinion, the fact of Bushehr being included lattf' 1 ^hiraz in the jurisdiction of Karim Khan, whose reputation for ^ lirM 3ustlce an(i good government already stood high, together with the iustrf lnercan tile character of the town itself and the absence of any necessity 33~34 hl h Ag . re * meilUs given in Aitohison,B Treaties, 4th edition, Volome XII, pages ti( fv j I ^ ^ttle importance as it was almost immediately superseded by a was -oi biant from KarTm Khan himself, see pages 34-36 of the same. 122 a1780 Grant of Privileges to the Bri tish by Karim Khan, July 3763, for u pomp and parade ' on the part of a British representative, indicated Bushehr as a very suitable location for a Residency ; and he remarked that it would always be easy to obtain satisfaction for injuries sustained at Bushehr by seizing vessels belonging to the port. Not long after this^ Mr. Price^ who had meanwhile become aware that Shaikh Sa'dun was subordinate to Sadiq Khan^ brother of Karim Khan and Governor of Shiraz ; directed Mr. Jervis to apply to the latter tor confirmation of the agreement made with Shaikh Sa'dun ; and on Sadiq Khan sending a present and expressing a wish that a European gentleman should visit him at Shiraz, the Resident took advantage of the opportunity to send his Linguist, Stephen Hermit^ accompanied by Lieutenant Durnford, to deliver a return present and make the required application. On the 1st of August 1763, these two returned to Bushebr bringing with them a Grant of Privileges of which a copy, duly authentic ated by Karim Khan^s own seal, was subsequently received. The principal provisions of this grant were the following : that the British should have liberty to erect a Factory at Bushehr or at any other port in the Gulf, to mount thereon as manv guns as they chose, not larger than 6-pounders, and to build in connection therewith, in any part of the kingdom, any number of ordinary houses ; that their trade should be free of import, export and internal duties both at Bushehr and at other ports, and that the Shaikh of Bushehr and other local governors should not charge more than 3 per cent, export duty on British goods purchased by Persian merchants; that the British should possess a monopoly, as against all other nationalities, of the importation of woollen goods into Persia; that the local governors should assist them in the recovery of their lawful debts in Persia, failing which they should be free to take their own measures against their debtors ; that their trade should be free from all restrictions throughout Persia ; that, without the knowledge and consent of the British official representative, native merchants should not pur chase goods from any British ship arriving at a Persian port; that, British vessels in the Gulf, if driven on shore or otherwise lost, should not be plundered, but should be salved, free of charge, by the local authorities ; that the British and those under their protection should enjoy religious freedom in all parts of the country ; that British deser ters, whether soldiers, sailors or slaves, should be delivered up by the Persian authorities, on condition of their not being punished for a fi^t or-a second offence ; that Linguists, brokers and Factory servants should be exempt from Persian taxes and subject to British jurisdiction ; that a spot of ground should be assigned to the British, wherever they jnigW ■''it1781 seiitatiy^ • ; an ^ ( • settle, for a burying place ; that if thej wished ground for a garden, ition j l they should receive it, either free of cost from the property of the ^ 111 iPersian crown, or on payment of a fair price out of private property ; P0lt ' and that the house formerly owned by the East India Company at Won Shiraz, together with the garden and water belonging to it, should be btotietiili restored to them. The Vakil desired that it should be stipulated, in a PPlj to fc: addition to the foregoing articles, that the British should take Persian 11 Sa'diii; 1 produce in payment or part payment for their goods, and not export the 'lataI whole value of their sales in specie ; that they should not ill-treat Mi sH Muhammadaus ; that they should give preference, in the sale of their ait, acconi],, imports, to principal merchants and men of credit; that rebels against make tin; Persian authority should not be harboured by them, but should on the retaradhl eontrary be handed over subject to an understanding that they were not »py,iiiiljii to be punished for a first or a second ofience ; and, finally, that the ived. Hie British should not, either directly or indirectly, assist the enemies of the Britisltiil ruler of Persia. It appears, from later correspondence, that the Govern- herportiii ment of Bombay did not approve of the article which aimed at subjeet- gettkf-p 111 8 all British trade in Persia to the control of the East India t of tkh Company's servants, and that they decided that it should not be enforced ; ildfcefei ^ similarly they seem to have rejected the articles, proposed by Karlm tier potts,«! ^ban, for restricting the export of specie and giving a preference, in all shoi Dti circumstances, to particular merchants.

In September 1764, Karim Khan, who was then encamped with a large force in the Bakhtiyari country, was believed to be contemplating the reduction of Mir Mahanna in the month of November or December following, for which purpose he was desirous of the help of one or two British vessels to prevent the escape of the rebel by sea ; and it was reported that ' he was willing to assign the Hon ; ble ' Company the annual sum of 40,000 Rupees for two cruizers, or 20,000 a for one, to be stationed in the Gulf for the protection of the trade, and ' had also made an offer of delivering up to the Hon^ble Company the ' Town and Government of Bunderick/ ; i.e., of Rig, a if agreeable to us. ;; The Bombay Government, however, took no steps in the matter further than to authorise the Resident, in December 1764, to lend the Vakil the services of a British vessel from time to time, provided that it were for the interest of the East India Company in Persia to do so, and that no inconveDience should be caused by the detention of the ship. Soon after this a serious case of piracy occurred, proving that the need for some kind of maritime police was not imaginary. The ' Islama bad ' a British vessel from Bengal, commanded by Captain H. Sutherland, was returning down the Gulf from Basrah to India, when she encountered off the island of Qishm a violent gale from the south-east, before whicH she was obliged to run to Mughu. The places of a number of her crew, lost on the outward voyage and at Basrah, had been supplied by the enlistment at the latter place of a dozen Arab sailors, the remainder of the original crew were, with one exception, Indians; and the only true Europeans on board were the Captain and his three officers. Among the passengers were some Armenian merchants. At Mughu on the 6th of February, the ship being short of provisions and water, the Captain sent the long-boat ashore in charge of the third officer to fetch a quantity of both, upon which the Arab part of the crew rose against the officers remaining on board, surprised and killed them, and took possession of the ' Islamabad The next day, when the party in the long-boat, who were ignorant of what had occurred after their departure, came alongside in bad weather, several of them were allowed by the Arab mutineers, or rather pirates, to return on board ; but on the Captain's servant attempting to follow, he was wounded with a lance and thrown back into the water, and, hardly had he been picked up by hia1783 Govef| companions; when the officer in command of the boat was suddenly a M killed by a pistol bullet from the ship, which passed through his head, a, moi 'phe others cast off and made for the nearest shore, landing again at Ml | ' a little town about a league to the southward of Magoo probably a, Tflu, puvvan, where the Shaikh seized the boat and stripped them of all their was hi property. The pirates carried the ei Islamabad ' to Qais Island and e moil disembarked there, first possessing themselves of all the valuables on s desiii board and murdering one of the Armenian merchants, of whose profes- tie j sional advice they had availed themselves ; but they were at once taken tlie Hi prisoners and sent over to the mainland by the local Shaikh, who did rsjorli not fail, at the same time, to convert the stolen property to his own use. lie tral- The survivors of the long-boat party, namely u a servant, a helmsman loipJ and lascars reached Bushehr on the 6th of March and reported the ieatikli affair to Mr. Jervis, the Resident there, who on the same day despatched latterk a boat-express with a letter to the Agent and Council at Basrah; but ie VaH the information, apparently, did not reach Basrah until the 26th of itittii March, when much valuable time had been lost.* As Mr. Jervis had and tkl suggested that vessels should be sent to demand the surrender by the Shaikh of Qais of the plunder in his possession, the Agent and Council m%U ^ ac0( ^ snow ' Tartar ^ at his disposal and gave him discretion to VIsk ma ^ ft 11Se ^ er as P ro P ose ^ case could be done without endan- Sutb e ^^ er or cargo ; and along with the ' Tartar ' they sent eewiif ^ r0m ^ asra ^ ^ ollamby, a Company's servant, who was to act before i! ^ re P resen ^ a ^ ve ma ^ er J provided that Mr. Jervis thought mte i UI1( ^ er ^ a ^^ n ^ feasible.

No application on the subject of he ^ ^ S ^ ama ^ a( ^ ^ was m ade, it would appear, to Karim Khan, into whose after 11 J* 16 a ^ ove f 0 llow8 the official account ; but, according to Niebahr, whose ship were | ^ a , SSe ' Islamabadnear Sirri on the 25th of January, the tragedy took place , 0]1 J J'' 0 da y s later, and the news of it reached Bushehr ' a little after ' his own [• u there on the 4th of February. Mr. Jervis, perhaps, had doubted or disbeliered a JailCt e mmour of a catastrophe until convinced of its truth by the arrival of the dm SQmvors -1784 Combined British and Persian at tack on Mir Mahanna of Rig, May— Jnly 1765. own possession Nasir Khan^s share of the plunder was said soon after to have come on the fall of Lar ; but the Company's servants did not lose sight of the case ; and a few years later it became, as we shall see further on^ the indirect cause of another and far more serious disaster. In the spring- of 1765 ; Karim Khan in person undertook an expe dition against the refractory Ka^ab tribe of ^Arabistan ; and at the same time he caused a force of about 1J00 mounted and 500 unmounted men to be assembled at Khurmuj near Bushehr, under the orders of Amir Kuhneh Khan, for the purpose of reducing Mir Mahanna of Rig to obedience. The Rig expedition, of which the proceedings at Khurmuj are noticed again further on, was delayed for three months or more by the inability of the commander to find a naval ally of sufficient strength to cope with Mir Mahanna and prevent his escape by sea ; for the Shaikh of JBushehr^s small fleet by itself was unequal to the task, and the other petty Shaikhs of the coast, whose position resembled that of Mir Mahanna in that they did not as yet pay tribute to the Persian Government, could not be relied on to act against him. Karim Khan, in these difficult circumstances, turned to the Dutch Governor of Kharag and to the British Resident at Bushehr. From the former. Mynheer Buschman, he received no encouragement ; but Mr. Jervis, considering the occasion to be one on which the services of a vessel might properly be lent to the Vakil under the orders given by the Government of Bombay in 1764, made an application on that footing to his superiors Tartar^ might be sent. The and his Council, who were written to-'the Resident at snow at Basrah, and asked that the Agent at Basrah (Mr. P. E. Wrench) evidently piqued by the Vakil's having Bushehr on a subject of such importance, instead of to themselves, and by Mr. Jervis s having neglected to forward them the VakiFs letter, made difficulties about complying with this request; they represented that the Tartar was unfit for the duty, and that she might miss her passage to India and be detained in the Gulf during the whole monsoon to the Company 's great inconvenience ; and they urged that the attack on Rig was not likely to be a complete success, and that, if it even partially failed, Mir Mahanna might afterwards make a descent on Bushehi'; besides attacking every British vessel bound up the Gulf. In the end however, they thought it best to leave the decision and the responsibility to Mr. Jervis, which they did by instructions dated the 25th of March; and a few days later they sent him the ' Tartar for employment, if required, both in the business of Mir Mahanna and in the a Islamabad case. The views of the Agent and Council, as the event showed, were not tl W Si /•ha1785 altogether incorrect ; but we should rather, perhaps, deplore their apathy in regard to the suppression of Mir Mahanna, the desirability of which was better understood by the Resident at Bushehr, than regret their want of decision in not prohibiting an enterprise of which they disapproved. No actual movement took place until late in May, when the Persian jvjay 3^ land forces under Kuhneh Khan arrived before Rig and were joined Julie - 1 there by some thousands of men from Karim Khair's camp at Qubban ii in 'Arabistan. The allied fleet, however, was not yet ready; and a bomb which the Persians tried to throw from a mortar into the town of Rig fell among themselves and killed several persons. Though Mir Mahanna had laid in abundant supplies at Rig, desertions from among his subjects warned him of the danger of attempting a long defence ; and on the night of the 1st of June, after slaughtering such of his cattle as he could not remove, he embarked his people and their property on 17 vessels, of which 5 were Gallivats and the rest belonged to a smaller class. The next day he arrived at the Island of Khargu^ adjoin ing Kharag, where he landed and formed a settlement on a site that suffered from several disadvantages, being at once waterless^ sandy, without shade, and destitute of forage ; but he had brought plenty of provisions with him, and the Dutch, though they otherwise observed neutrality, allowed him to send his sheep to graze on the Island of Kharag. The circumstances of Mir Mahanna at this time did not promise a prolonged resistance on his part; for, though Kuhneh Khan's forces could not reach him, a number of his people died of the extreme heat. He himself, already blind of an eye, suffered from severe inflammation of the other and was obliged for a time to leave the arrangements for defence to subordinates, some of these being men whose ears he had previously cut oft for disobedience of orders, or merely in drunken fury. The Anglo-Persian fleet, consisting of the snow ' Tartar Captain 4^ to 18th Price, of a ship belonging to Shaikh Nasir, of three Gallivats and of June * two Batils, left Bushehr on the 4th of June to co-operate with Kuhneh ' ' vl - it on an( ^ anchored the same evening off Kharag : they were thus too ^ Intli late to prevent the escape of Mir Mahanna from Rig. The son of the te respo^ ^aikh of Bushehr, who came in his father's ship, tried to pose as the 25tliof^ a( * m * ra l 0 ^ ttie whole expedition ; but Captain Price of the Tartar ^ employ® 81 a( ^ ua % charge of the operations. The argest of the Persian , a jglaJ ^ a ^ va ts was commanded by Mr. Natter, a writer of the Bushehr Residency, who had in his boyhood made several voyages as a naval1786 cadet ; and no useful service was done^ in the hostilities that took place_, except by the ' Tartar and by the Gallivat under Mr. Natter. During the night of the 4th of June^ 5 Gallivats and a Batil which Mir Mahanna had caused to be drawn up on shore were set afloat again; and the next mornings when they were descried standing* over towards the coast of the mainland, they were pursued by the Anglo-Persian fleet and a harmless exchange of shots took place at very long ranges ; but at sunset, though still visible to the south-east, they had not been over taken. Daybreak of the 6th of June found Mir Mahanna's vessels returned in safety and stationed between Kharag and Khargu, while the British and Persian fleet was scattered in different directions ; and the Shaikh's son had gone with two vessels to Bushehr, apparently to confer with his father and to attribute the failure of the allies to neglect of his own valuable advice by the British Commander. Captain Price and Mr. Natter, unsupported by the large Bushehr vessel, which kept care fully out of the way, then attempted a direct attack upon Mir MahaiWs craft; but these replied with so hot a fire and were so well seconded by shore batteries on Khargu that the assailants found themselves obliged to retire, and in the afternoon they anchored again off Kharag. Several days of inaction followed, and on the 10th of June one of the Persian Gallivats was damaged and rendered useless by a violent storm from the north-east* On the 15th, three Gallivats and a Batil of Mir Mahanna were seen to have left Khargu, and it was conjectured that they had gone to encounter the Shaikh's son, who was believed to be on the point of returning from Bushehr. Much confusion was created during the next night by some blank firing from the Dutch guns on Kharag, which was ordered by the Governor, Mynheer Buschman, partly as a practical joke and partly to test the preparedness of his own garrison for an emergencj, and was not understood by the belligerents. On the 16th an engage ment between four vessels of Mir Mahanna's fleet and three belonging to that of Shaikh Nasir appeared to be imminent; but it was averted by the accidental appearance of a large British ship from Madras, which bore straight down upon the combatants in ignorance of what they were about, and so gave them an excuse—not unwelcome to either-for separating. aut On the 19th of June the Shaikh's son and the vessels that had g tIie to Bushehr returned to Kharag, and an endeavour was made, at Mr. Jervis' instance, to induce the Dutch to associate themselves ^ e Biitish and Peisians ; but Mynheer Buschman would have nothing to do with the affair. On the 20th, learning that two fishing boats1787 tain Pricti ies ^tt belonging 1 to Mir Mahanin's people were at Kharag^ the son of the ^ 1 ' S| ^Qg^ehr Shaikh sent men to seize them, and this was done without difficult/; a fisherman who was in one of them being- killed ; but the Dutch would not allow the boats to be removed from the island, and, when the captors persisted in taking them away, opened fire with their heavy guns. One Bushehr crew succeeded in carrying off their prize; but the other brought theirs back to the beach, where, on landing, they l0 ^eii| were surrounded and mobbed by a crowd of Kharag Arabs, whom the ^ 1 gight of the dead fisherman had filled with indignation. The sailors 0I i the Dutch Gallivats, however, put an end to the riot by firing wnsjani indiscriminately with their muskets on the whole crowd; and Mynheer Buschman had the Bushehris arrested, and kept them in custody until the fishing boat that had been taken away was brought back. On the ^nd of June, Captain Price, who had now lost all confidence 22nd to 28th | in the Bushehr squadron, ran over to Eig with the whole fleet for the J une * tirMak p ur p 0 se of embarking Persian troops, according to a previous arrange- jllseconi m0ri t w ith Amir Kuhneh Khan, for a descent in force on the island of IvesoM Khargu; but the Persian commander now said that he could do nothing arag. 8ei until the 29th of June, when, the Muharram festival having passed over, cf Ma 5^000 men would be available; so on the next day the allied vessels stormfi® to Kharag. Meanwhile Mir Mahanna, who paid a rupee to Mil Mak ^ subjects for every cannon shot of the enemy picked up and brought tkcjWj ^ bin^ and who had already thrown up ramparts of sand to protect his a the pon people from the frequent desultory bombardments from the sea to which ming tki they were exposed and to cover the carpenters employed in repairing his ag, damaged vessels, made ready for the threatened descent by construct- , practidj ing new batteries near the most exposed points; and at the same time he ■ an einef even caused to be celebrated, with all the enthusiasm customary among th an eif Shi^ahs, the anniversary of the martyrdom of Husain. threeIA Nothing more occurred until the 29th of June, when, after an 29th June to ps avert absence lasting several days, three Gallivats and a Batil belonging to Mad®; Mir Mahanna's fleet reappeared conducting a Gallivat that they had ^ ^ ^ en between Bahrain and Bushehr with specie and pearls on board, to e 1 News of this capture had been brought to Kharag two days previously V a couple of Batils which were with the Gallivat when she was that W' Stacked; but the smaller vessels of the Bushehr fleet at Kharag, though wag mat they were superior in strength to those of Mir Mahanna and lay directly bemsel^ 1 ln their course, tamely allowed the prize to be carried past them to the Ibave ^ noi t 1 hern shore of Khargu.

From the first Captain Price had been displeased with the conduct of bis allies, who systematically disregarded a code of signals that he had arranged and shunned even the appearance of danger, while the Shaikh's son even pretended that it was bsneath his dignity to take orders from a European ; and their behaviour on this last occasion was so unsatisfactory that on the next day Mr. Natter and some European gunners who had been distributed among the vessels of the Bushehr fleet o o were withdrawn, and returned partly on board the ' Tartar ' and partly on board a small yacht, belonging to the establishment of the British Agent at Basrah, which had taken part in the later operations. On the 2nd of July a small vessel of the Bushehr fleet was taken by the enemy, and another was cast on shore and lost. On the 9th of July the Agents yacht left for Basrah in company of the a Fort William/ , a large English ship from Bengal which had called at Kharag ; and on the 10th the fleet of Mir Mahanna formed a junction, within sight of Kharag, with that of Salman, the Shaikh of the Ka^ab, who like himself was at war with Karim Khan, and who a few days later came to a rupture with the British also. On the 11th of July Captain Price announced his inten tion of returning to Bushehr on the following night; and, as the Shaikh's son who had neither money nor provisions left, decided to withdraw like- wise, the operations came to an end. The failure was entirely due to the pusillanimous behaviour of the Bushehr contingent ; but Karim Khan, nevertheless, seems to have considered that he had been badly treated in the matter by the British. No sooner had this enterprise reached its unfortunate conclusion than a new train of circumstances began, of which the tendency was still further to lower the credit of the British in the eyes of the Vakil, and at the same time to bring their interests and his into collision. Of these events, which are fully described in the history of 'Arabistan, the most important were the piratical seizure by the Ka'ab tribe in July 1765 of the ' Sally ' and ^ Fort William ' and of the Agent's yacht, just mentioned; the subsequent despatch of a British armament from Bombay, at the begmumg ot 1766, to co-operate with a Turkish force * Such at least was the opinion of the traveller Niebuhr, who was an im] eyewitness of the whole proceedings, and who has placed it on record that ^ Mahanna ' would inevitably have been defeated altogether, it only Captain Price and Mr. Natter had not been deserted in such a cowardly manner by the Bushehr Arabs. For his account of the operations, see his Voyage, Volume 11, pages 152 —150.1789 Hi in obtaining 1 reparation from the Ka'ab ; and the virtual defeat of the ^ retf joint Anglo-Turkish expedition, of which the British portion sustained 4 r two serious reverses,, in May and September 1766, in the neighbourhood of Doraq or the modern Tallahiyeh. iMir Mahanna had in the meanwhile, 4 oU : on the 1st of January 1766, expelled the Dutch from Kharag and possessed himself of that island ; but after doing so, while he remained at war with the Shaikh of the Bushehr, to whom Karim Khan about 1 oecast March 1766 promised further assistance, he showed no malice against Ei| the British j and the East India Company, though their employes at sBuslielr Bushehr wished, in the summer of 1766, to detain a cruiser for their protection against him, had not as yet to suffer from any of the fc oftbl embarrassments which it was in his power to create. As the Ka^ab, ions. notwithstanding Karim Khan^s expedition against them in the preceding was tab year, wore considered by the Basrah Agency to be subjects of the ilieiici; Turkish Government, the Vakil was not consulted before the operations rt Wife against them were begun ; but the Agent, Mr. Wrench, sent him a ag; anii letter, to which he returned no answer, requesting him not to afford ightofi asylum in his dominions to the fugitive Ka^ab. An effort was made at iiimself i the instance of the Turks, probably soon after the arrival of the British laruptra; armament in March 1766, to secure the co-operation of the Shaikh of mncedlisi -Bushehr against the Ka'ab ; but, as the Shaikh made it a condition that ,asMti ^e should again be assisted by the British against Mir Mahanna, — a o witkbl condition which the Company's representatives, under instructions from irelydr Bombay, considered it impossible to grant, — nothing was arranged on it Kariil ^ese lines ; nor is it probable that the Bushehr fleet would have rendered jadly W an y more valuable service against the Ka'ab than it had done against Mir Mahanna. conchsii During the progress of the Anglo-Turkish operations in ; Arabistan, dency f in the summer of 1766, Karim Khan showed no signs of interest ; till at the W length, a few days after the second British reverse on the 23rd of ision. ® September, letters were received from him by both the British and ustan,^ the lurkish authorities. In these letters he insisted on the imme- in July ■ ^ate withdrawal of the Anglo-Turkish forces from the country of the at's ya* whom he described as his subjects, and on whose chief he wmai^ 1 Pressed to have conferred the Government of Doraq ; but at the same a Turtf ^ me be promised that he would cause full satisfaction to be made to o wsaB^ an( i the Turks for the injuries that they had suffered at record ^ ie of the tribes. As it was reported that Karim Khan was biea ^ ^ ncense( i against the British, chiefly on account of their not tabled him to suppress Mir Mahanna, and that he did not even1790 allow their name to be mentioned in his presence, the Agent and Council in October 1766 directed the Resident at Bushehr to inform him, if lie askda anj questions, that the British were merely the auxiliaries of tlie Turks in the war with the Ka'ab ; and at the same time Mr. Wrench and his friends were evidently prepared, in case the Vakil^s resentment should seek practical expression at Bushehr, to send vessels for the pro tection of the East India Company's interests there or even, if necessarj, to remove the Residency altogether.

This individual, on the 13th of March 1767, informed Messrs. Lyster and Skipp at the Turkish Government Sarai at Basrah that he had come to insist on the restitution to the British of all the property plundered by the Ka^ab, failing which the Vakil would take suitable measures against the tribe and would hold himself respon sible for the British losses, provided that an account of the same were supplied to him and one of the Company's European servants sent to explain it to him at Shiraz, in which case other misunderstandings also would probably be removed. To this it was answered, no instructions applicable to the situation thus created having been received from Bombay, that the British had entered on the war with the Ka^ab as allies of the Turks, in whose territory the offences of the tribe had been committed, and not as principals ; but that, if restitution should be brought about by the mediation of the Vakil, it would be regarded as a proof of his love of justice and of his regard for the British nation, A letter, probably to the same effect as the verbal message, was delivered by the Persian Envoy at a visit to the British Agency building on the 17th of March. After this, on the 23rd of March, the Envoy had an interview with the Ka'ab Shaikh, but his proposals for satisfaction of the British claims met with an insulting reception ; and on the 8th of April, after making a final but ineffectual demand on the Ka^ab by letter, he took his departure from Basrah. Three days after the first arrival of the Persian envoy at Basrah, a toSh£r D letter was received b y the Agent there from the Government of Bombay, fembeTmV. wl10 ' after careM1 y considering the steps to be taken in consequence of the failure of the Anglo-Turlnsh expedition against the Ka'ab, W come to the conclusion that the war should not be carried on by British without allies, and that, if the Ka'ab remained obdurate and1 Urn, | iliaries J mr.!| ^ mil asraliUli injure | ie peisj Marcli: vermneiii tlie mv irvants t. no ihk receWj i the U trileWi ution i® be regai't Biiteli i(fi on tb® the &amp;' lentotl' in consf 1791 there were no hope of a settlement being reached by the help of the Turks alone^ arrangements should be made to obtain the co-operation of the Persian Vakil. The Presidency were well aware of the disfavour with which the Court of Directors at this time regarded entangling alliances with native powers in the Gulf, but they could devise no other means of retrieving their political and commercial position in that quarter ; and, though they were particularly unwilling to be drawn into operations against Mir Mahanna in the interest of Karim Khan, they thought that even these should be undertaken,—if the Vakil were to insist on them as an indispensable condition of his friendship,—on the best terms that might be obtainable from him. Their instructions to the Agent at Basrah were framed on these lines ; and they recommended the immediate despatch to Shiraz of Mr. George Skipp, one of the Council at Basrah, to conduct the negotiations. At the same time they suggested the following as terms to be stipulated if assistance were promised against Mir Mahanna ; that the Grant permitting a British settlement at Bushehr should be confirmed, with the addition that the Company should be at liberty to build a fort or Factory there, or at any other place in Persia, and to mount on it such guns as they might please ; that a sum of 1120,000 to R25,000 a year should be assigned to the Company from the Customs of Bushehr, or from some other item of public revenue, to defray the expense of their maintaining a cruiser constantly in the Gulff that any island in the Gulf which the Company might select for the purpose should be granted to them, if they desired it, for the foundation of a settlement ; that ample satisfaction should be made for the losses sustained by the British out of the booty that might hereafter be taken from the K a^ab, the vessels of that tribe being at the same time destroyed or handed over, or fall security being given that they should not again be employed against the British; that half the booty taken from Mir Mahanna should be delivered up to the British, whatever its nature; and finally, in the event of a joint Anglo-Persian expedition against Kharag proving successful, that Mir Mahanna should be allowed to retain possession of the island on undertaking not to cede it to any European power other than the British. It was added that, in any case, the return of British field-guns, etc., taken % the Ka^ab in war must be insisted on, and that an endeavour should be made to obtain commercial advantages in Persia, especially in regard to the trade in Gilan raw silk. According to the orders sent from Bombay, the application to Karim Khan was not to be made until a last ehauce of coming to terms had been offered by the Agent and declined by i i * i I! Il l 11 il 1 ' mi 11 11792 Instructions of tlie Agent to Mr. Skipp. Trade and other diffi culties at Bushehr. the Ka'ab; but the British authorities at Basrah considered that tlie proceedings of the Persian Envoy had been such as to render unnecessarj, and even improper^ any further correspondence with the tribe, and they therefore proceeded to act upon their instructions without delay. The British Agent at Basrah was now a Mr. Henry Moore; whoge personality was to exercise a peculiar and by no means beneficial influence upon the negotiations with Karim Khan ; and a first sign of his eccentricity appeared in the manner in which he modified the orders of the Presidency in conveying them to Mr. Skipp. In one sense Mr. Moore^s interference was cautious, for he did not withhold any of the commands of the Government, and he even urged Mr. Skipp to pay due heed to them all; but at the same time he suggested that they were not of a binding nature and put forward in place of them a number of sug gestions of his own, of which the principal were that the Vakil should be pressed to co-operate for the destruction ' of the Ka^ab, or, failing that, to arrange a firm and lasting peace between the Chaub on the one part, the Turks and us on the other,^ on a basis of payment of full compensa' tion for English and Turkish losses, together with El,00^000 on account of the expenses of the expedition equipped by the Company, and of the recognition by the Persians of the country dependent on Qubban — though not of that dependent on Doraq — as subject to Turkish authority. In short, it would appear that Mr. Skipp received virtual discretion to make the best terms that he could with Karim Khan in respect of compensation and all other matters^ and to pay as much or as little heed as he chose to the views of his superiors at Bombay. Mr. Skipp appears to have left Basrah for Bushehr, on his way to Shiraz, about the middle of April 1767: he took with him an introduction from the Persian Envoy, special letters for Karim Khan from the Governor of Bombay and the Agent at Basrah, and presents to the value of Rl0,000. The valuation handed to him of the ships a Sally ' and Fort Williamand their cargoes amounted to RS,90,930. It.should be mentioned here that, perhaps in consequence of the enter prise against Mir Mahanna in which Mr. Jervis had, engaged in 1765, the Court of Directors in May 1766 prohibited the Resident at Bushehr from corresponding with the Vakil or ruler of Persia for the time being in any important matter^ such as the obtaining of new settlements or grants, unless under the instructions of the Agent and Council at Basrah, and from deputing any person to represent him at Karim Khan's court or at Shiraz. Mr. Jervis, however, before the receipt of these orders1793 jdcof 'nriltli had complained to the Persian Government against Shaikh Nasir of Busliehr and suggested his removal; and this step resulted, after the succession to the Residency of Mr. Bowyear, in Shaikh Nasir^s son attempting to enhance the rent of the Factory premises at Bushehr by Bl^OOO a year, while the Shaikh himself summoned the Residency broker to Shiraz, merely for the purpose of inconveniencing the Resident. More serious, too, than these difficulties was the fact that British trade at Bushehr had been brought to a standstill by an embargo, imposed under Karim Khan^s orders, on the exportation of specie from Persia. There were thus questions relating to Bushehr and to British trade to be adjusted by Mr. Skipp, apart from that of a settlement with the Ka^ab. Mr, Skipp; notwithstanding that he had come to Shiraz in a public character and at the Vakil's own desire, was at first treated with indifference and could not obtain an interview with Karim Khan ; and at the beginning of August matters appeared to the Agent at Basrah to have reached such a pass that he had directed Mr. Skipp to leave Shiraz at the end of that month, and had givpn orders that, on Mr. Skipp^s arrival at Bushehr, the Resident there should remove with the Company^s property to Basrah and seize, at his departure^ as many vessels as possible belonging to the Vakil, the Shaikh of Bushehr, and the Shaikh of Bahrain. The news of this contemplated rupture with tke Vakil, regarding which Mr. Moore had not thought fit to consult them, reached the Bombay Government in September and filled them with consternation, for it was too late for them to take any steps to prevent it; but in the meantime affairs at Shiraz, perhaps in conse quence of Mr. Skipp's seeking to quit the place, which Karim Khan would not allow him to do, took a more favourable turn; and at length, about the middle of September, the Vakil agreed to pay R5,00,000 to the East India Company as soon as they should have equipped an expedition against Mir Mahanna, and to give them liberty to attack the Ka'ab—but without the assistance of the Turks—at such time or place as they chose. He could not be prevailed on, however, to promise that be would immediately hand over the Ka'ab fleet to the British, a condition which he professed to consider dishonourable to himself as protector of the tribe, and which, moreover, he might have found it difficult or impossible to fulfil, — and the Agent and Council at Basrah, who regarded the point as of extreme importance and refused to be satisfied with a stringent undertaking on his part that: he would be answerable for the future conduct of the Ka'ab, accordingly sent him a temporising answer and referred his proposals to the Government of m Mr. Skipp's negotiations and settle ment at Shiraz.1794 Unant homed expedition against Hormuz and lofei of tt.o ' Defiance,' October- November 1767. Bombay. Mr. Moore, it would appear, had now contracted a strong prejudice against Karim Khan, whom he described as 'by far too wavering and capricious to have the least reliance on his promises; ^ and his own view, at this juncture, seems to have been that the British should prosecute their quarrel against the Ka'ab by main force, without recourse to alliances. After the conclusion of their negotiations with Karim Khan and the reference of his proposals to higher authority in India, the Agent and Council at Basrah found themselves with a considerable and temporarily unemployed naval force at their disposal, and, looking round, they in vented for it a remarkable and unauthorised application. Eeverting to the 'Islamabad ' case of 1765, the detail? of which they hunted up in the records of the Agency, and to the instructions given by the Bombay Government early in 1766, in which operations for the recovery of the value of the 'Islamabad's^ cargo were contemplated if a favourable opportunity should present itself after the chastisement of the Ka'ab, quoting also an alleged request by Karim Khan to Mr. Skipp at Shiraz, that the Company should undertake the reduction of Shaikh ^Abdullah of Hormuz to obedience to the Government of Persia, Mr. Moore and his colleagues decided on a showy but dangerous enterprise. It was to call upon Shaikh ^Abdullah, on account of his ex post facto connection with the ' Islamabad ' affair, to pay 114,00,000 as compensation to the owners and freighters of the unfortunate vessel, 111,00,000 as damages to the East India Company, and R^OjOOO as a reward to the mem bers of the expedition; to deliver up to the British, as the allies of Karim Khan, a ship and all the Gallivats which were in his possession; and to renounce in favour of the British, or whomsoever the Vakil might nominate, his ancestral property, the island of Hormuz. As if this plan were not likely in itself to be large enough to occupy the available vessels, satisfaction was to be demanded from the Shaikh of Charak f&lt; for his taking our armed boat in the month of May last on her return from Masqat, for his cruelty to our people, and for his insolence in saying the English were not equal to his shoes,which satisfaction was to consist in the restoration of the boat and her cargo, valued at R10,000, in the seizure of the Shaikh's Gallivats, and in the capture of the Shaikh himself, who was to be handed over a prisoner to Karim Khan. The Shaikh of Q.ais, also, was to be called to account for his share m the ' Islamabad ' business ; and, last but not least, Commodore Price was ' ordered to take, burn, sink and destroy every fighting G alii vat he meets with during his cruise except those belonging to Meer'toZoJ 1795 MahanW Messrs. Lyster and Bowyear (or Bawyear) were appointed to be joint managers in the expedition, and the cruiser a Defiance bomb -vessel f ' Salamander and Gallivat ' Wolf ^ were detailed for the service. An appalling catastrophe, the most serious that has ever befallen a British operation in the Persian Gulf, brought this ill-judged venture to a sudden end. The circumstances are fully described in the excerpt * which follows from the Basrah Agency Diary :— Arrived the &lt;f Salamander,' Bomb, commanded by Lieutenant Gage, who brings us the melancholy account of the loss of the 4&lt; Defiance,' Commodore Fountain Price, that ship having blown up, under the 15tli November, on an expedition against Ormuse, in sight of the island of Kishmee. As the following extract from Lieutenant Gage's journal particularizes the event, it is here with melancholy transcribed.

At this time the ' Defiance ' was at anchor, distance from us about 4 miles. Lieutenant Kerr acquainting the Commodore that we was at anchor by the ship (the Commodore) weighed and stood towards us ; and we at times burned blue lights to let the Commodore see where we was. There being little wind and the tide of ebb against him, he could not get near us ; and little after daylight the ' Defiance ' anchored,—-distance from the ship about a mile and from cargo, ^ us about 1| miles.

We were then about a mile and a h« lf distance from her , but could not observe any men living about the wreck j indeed the top'obiou was so great that we could not think it was possible that there was any men saved from her .

Another unfortunate tact in the case was that Karim Khan, in whose name, as it were, the expedi tion had been undertaken, afterwards protested against it and expressed annoyance while iMr. Skipp, in April 1768, wrote : ' With respect to' Shaik Abdullah the Vackeel from time of my first arrival till now has not requested our assistance against him, or indeed mentioned him to m e. ;; The Court of Directors in London, even before they became aware of the loss of the ' Defiance condemned the projected attack on Hormuz upon several grounds and ironically remarked in a letter to Mr. Moore and his associates, dated the 2nd of March 1768: 'In short, if you had met to consider of a mode to embroil our affairs it is very doubtful if you could have done it so completely as by the measures you have now taken.'' In November 1767 the Bombay Government, in replying at the earliest opportunity to the communication from Basrah anent the settle ment proposed by Karim Khan, regretted that the Agent had not seen fit to close with the VakiPs offer on his own responsibility and ordered April 176s that, if the offer in question were still open, it should be immediately accepted. In that case Mr. Skipp should be sent back to Shiraz ' with the utmost expedition^ to conclude a regular agreement on the subject, a letter from the Government of Bombay being in the meantime trans mitted direct to the Yakil by the Resident at Bushehr. If, however, the Vakil were found to have changed his mind, the Agent might take any steps that appeared suitable for concluding the affair on a favoura ble footing, short only of making war on the Vakil or forming a combi^- nation against him with Mir Mahanna or with any other person. A treaty with Karim Khan^ were such to be arranged, should fix an amount of woollens to be purchased by the Vakil from the East India Company every year and the rate at which they should be paid for ; and similarly it should mention the value at which Gilan raw silk, Kirman wool, and copper would be accepted by the Company in exchange for their goods; while any offers that Karim Khan might make in regard to Kharag should also be embodied in it Mr. Skipp did not, apparently, leave Basrah for Shiraz until the 7th Jth^FeWi-y of February 1768, or later ; and in the meanwhile a fresh protest had W entered by the Government of Bombay against a proposal by Mr. Moore to join with Mir Mahanna against Karim Khan, in regard1798 to the latter of whom they remarked : a We do not recollect any one ' instance of his having ever injured us^ nor can we adopt the opinion a you seem to have entertained of his being an unsteady character, for his strict adherence to his word passed the ChauK, his resolute refusal of • f the present carried to him by Mr Skipp until affairs were settle^ as a well as other instances of his conduct mentioned in different parts of u your advices ; make him appear to us in a very different light.' It was added ; in the letter from the Presidency, that Kharag should be sur veyed and occupied by the Company's forces, if it were captured, until the orders of the Court of Directors could be obtained; that no forcible action should be taken against the Ka^ab without the concurrence of the Vakil; that an undertaking to keep a British guardship in the Gulf might be given, provided that the Vakil were willing to pay the expenses of maintaining it, which according to a ' calculate ' would be fi62,440 a year for a first rate, and 1140,099 a year for a second-rate vessel; and that in any treaty concluded it should be laid down, but without direct reference to another European nation, that the British East India Company were to have an exclusive right of trading in the dominions of the Vakil. At the time of Mr. Skipp's departure for Shiraz there were still impediments to British trade at Bushehr which, Karim Khan intimated; could not be removed without negotiation. On this occasion there was less delay on the part of Karim Khan in coming to terms with Mr. Skipp ; and on the 14th of April 1768 the British representative was successful in obtaining from him a sealed agreement, in which, on condition of the^island of Kharag being taken and Mir Mabanna being captured or killed or having his strength brokeil by the British, the Vakil undertook to recover 15,000 Tumans as compensation for British losses from 'the Honble Shaik Soleman, Chaub, to give half of the goods and the whole of the armament an^ vessels of Mir Mahanna to the British, and to cede to them for ever 'thfl entire possession and dominion ' of the island of Kharag. The Vakil also made himself financially responsible to the British for all depredation^ that might henceforth be committed on them by the Ka'ab ShaikB; whether on sea or on land; and, apart from the agreement, be promised that the field-guns taken by the Ka'ab should be returned on board the British fleet when it assembled before Kharag, gave orders for the immediate release of all prisoners by the Ka^ab, and issued a stringent injunction to the tribe with reference to their future conduct towards the British and the Turks. The removal of impediments to British trade1799 in Persia was deferred, however, on the plea that the Vakil bad a num ber of points to settle with the Shaikh of Bushehr before opening the road from that place to Slnraz, which he had closed; but it was promised in general terms that, as soon as the East India Company had given proof of beino- in earnest in the Kharag matter and so set at rest the doubts which Karim Khan openly avowed, their trade should have free course throughout the whole country. At one moment during the negotia tions the Vakil seemed inclined to accept the services of the Shaikhs of Bushehr and Hormuz against Mir Mahanna, in preference to those of the British; but, after a little hesitation, be resolutely set their offers aside; and, before Mr. Skipp's departure, he accepted the presents of the East India Company, at the same time according the bearer a very favourable interview. Steps were then taken, without further delay, to carry out the article Unsuccessful relating to the reduction of Kharag. A considerable British armament attack on was already present in the Gulf, the senior naval officer with the same ^ 7 h 6 g' ag5 May being Commander C. Elphinstone, while the military were under the orders of Captain L. Nilson or Nelson ; but so irresolute was the con duct of the leaders that the operations ended in an ignominious failure, which seemed to justify Karim Khan^s doubts of the willingness or ability of the British to execute what they had undertaken. On the 19th of May 1768 a council of war was held on board the 19th aud British squadron before Kharag, at which it was resolved to make a breach the next day in the north curtain of the fort, and to storm it with landing parties. On the 20th, however, there was an adverse wind, which prevented the ships from anchoring so near to the shore as had been intended ; a three hours^ bombardment produced no effect on the fort; the enemy stood to their guns with unexpected firmness ; the grab ' Bombay the second largest vessel of the East India Company^s marine, went on fire in her starboard quarter ; and the attack was abandoned. In this engagement the e&lt; Bevenge ' and the ' Bombay ' suffered a good deal in their masts and rigging and received a number of shot in their hulls, while the &lt;( Bevenge ' had u three of her men s l^gs shot off,' the ' Bombay ' had ten men wounded, some of them Mortally, and the ' Dolphin ' schooner had one man killed. Mir Mahanna's guns were said to be heavier than those of the squadron, which ^ere 6 and 9 pounders only. The same evening a second council of war was held, and it was decided to postpone further operations until Karim Khan ; s real intentions in regard to sending military assistance should have become known, for, if reinforcements were obtained, the1800 probability of success would be greatly increased, but in any case tie attack was to be resumed later on. Meanwhile the ' Bombay ' was to carry the sick and wounded to Bushehr, ' as soon as the Surgeons think the people with stumps can be moved with safety and a hospital was to be established there on shore under Mr. G. Birch. On the 39th of May, no help having yet arrived from the Vakil, active operations were again undertaken. Between 3 and 4 a.m . the boats of the squadron, manned and armed, proceeded ashore under the command of Lieutenants Button, Sheriff, Scott and Blair to seize and burn three of Mir Mahanna's Gallivats ; but they grounded at a distance from the beach, and, as the Gallivats were seen to be hauled up high and dry, returned to the ships without making the attempt. A few hours later a party from the 'Eagle,' from the 'Wolf' and from a store ship, which had all been lying off Khargu since the 27th to take in water, was surprised on that island by 40 or 60 of Mir Mahanna's men and very severely handled ; the island had been thoroughly re connoitred on the previous day, but the enemy had crossed from Khalag during the night and hidden themselves in trenches in the sand. The watering party, which included four European sailors, was covered by a guard of 50 sepoys under a Subal.dar j but these, on being attacked, mostly threw away their arms and rushed into the sea, while such of them as stood their ground were cut to pieces. A sort of panic seems to have seized the whole expedition, for, though military detachments were embarked in boats, they did not land; the bodies of the dead apparently remained where they had fallen, on shore ; and the enemy on Khargu were allowed to escape in small boats, unmolested, back to Kharag. The casualties sustained by the British in this affair were 30 in all, m.,4 European seamen, 17 sepoys, 3 lascars and I Topass killed, 5 sepoys wounded, and 1 European seaman missing; and the enterprise was now altogether given up by those charged with it, on the ground that ' we have by no manner of means a sufficient number oma e e landing by ourselves, especially as the heats are now set m.

The negotations with Karim Kban through Mr. Skipp, who was still at Sliiraz, continued for two or three months after the failure of the attack on Kharag ; but there was now no longer any chance of their success, for, not only did Mr. Moore adhere to the 'unaccountable antipathy ' which he had conceived for Karim Khan and even express his preference for an alliance with Mir Mahanna, but he also took a ^strange personal pique and disgust to Mr. Skipp ,5 which put an end to harmonious and effective working. On the 6th of September the Agent and Council at Basrah ' came to the resolution of having nothing further to do with the Caun, his perfidious and injurious treat ment of us (being) the cause of it, ' and sent orders to Mr. Skipp to annul all engagements and retire from Shiraz; and this decision, notwithstanding the subsequent receipt of proposals transmitted by the Vakil before the end of August and the actual despatch by him of a force to Ganaveh opposite Kharag, which they treated as a mere blind, they absolutely refused to reconsider. Mr. Skipp, on his arrival at Basrah in October 1768, was suspended by his enemies there on a charge of breach of trust and breach of orders in commercial matters, as explained in another place, and found himself obliged to proceed to Bombay for the purpose of vindicating his character. The failure of their representatives to arrive at an understanding with Karim Khan re-acted unfavourably, in more than one respect, upon the position of the East India Company in the Persian Gulf. On the 17th August 1768, while Mr. Skipp was still at Shiraz, Mir Mahanna Ventured to show his anger at the recent attack on Kharag by capturing the British snow ' Speedwell 39 at sea off Bushehr; and in October, after the recall of the mission^ the Agent and Council at Basrah thought it ftecessaryj as a precaution in case of a rupture with the Vakil, to reduce the 'risque' or value of the Company's stock at Bushehr to KS^OOO ; while at the same time they lodged a warning for upward-bound vessels a t Masqat, and directed the squadron under their orders to cruise con- Second part of ) Mr. Skipp's second mis^ sion to Shi- raz, May — September, 1768.

The squadron itself was now so badly founds both in men and stores^ that at one time tk laying up of the smaller vessels was seriously considered as a means of providing the larger with proper complements ; and eventually, a very few days before the arrival of a Persian army at Ganaveh, the bulk of the force returned to India under orders from the Basrah authorities. No serious disturbance of the status quo took place^ however, until after the expulsion of Mir Mahanna from Kharag by his own subjects on the 26th of January 1769, —an event which only supplied the Company's employes in the Gulf with an opportunity of committing fresh errors of judgment. Mr. Moore and his associates seem to have supposed that Mir Mahanna had accumulated vast treasures on Kharag and that, by blockading the island and preventing the removal of the spoil to the Persian coast, they might be able to obtain compen sation for recent losses from the successor of Mir Mahanna or possibly from Karim Khan, under whose authority, should there be no inter ference on their part, Kharag was likely to fall ; but the event did not answer to their expectations. A demand made by them on the new chief of Kharag, that he should demolish his fortifications and surrender his ordnance^ met with a refusal ; and about the beginning of April, convinced at last of the impossibility of effectually blockading Kharag and made anxious by rumours of a possible junction of the Bushehr and Ka'ab fleets at Ganaveh under orders from Karim Khan, they removed their vessels. Simultaneously, however, they sent vacillating orders to the naval commander not to act offensively against the Caun, Chaub, or Meer, unless a favourable opportunity offers, whereby if he thinks he can get possession or destroy the Ga Hi vats of both or either of the latter powers, if he can, he is by all means to attempt it '. Ihe action of the Agent and Council in regard to Kharag so alarmed Mi. J. Morley, the Resident at Bushehr, who seems to bave had an inkling of their intentions before they were carried out, and who foresaw a rupture with Karim Khan as the probable consequence that early in February he took steps, on his own responsibility, for withdrawing the Residency from Bushehr; and later, notwithstanding some preliminary opposition by the local Shaikh, who had received orders from Zaki Khan commanding the Persian force sent to Ganaveh not to let the British go, and in spite of the fact that about 100 persons—some of whom were patients in hospital-had to be1803 as a m i let embarked, the removal was successfully accomplislied. The Vakil n ot having been able to prevent this movement, politely sent after the Resident some of his effects and of the East India Company's horses which had been left behind. The conduct of both the Agent and Council and of the Resident in connection with these affairs, was highly disapproved by the Govern- mentof Bombay, who in April 1769 directed the Agent 8.nd Council at Basrah to assist Zaki Khan, if it were not too late, on the best terms that they could obtain from him, to take possession of Kharag. In case this should not be feasible, they must endeavour to come to a settlement with the islanders; but, at all events, they should do their utmost to prevent the restoration of Mir Mahanna. It does not appear whether these instructions were obeyed. The Court of Directors in London, whose ear the Agent and Council at Basrah had gained by garbling — so at least the Government of Bombay believed — part of the official correspondence, held that the troubles in the Gulf were entirely due to the Presidency 'having been deceived by Mr. Skipp into a confidence in Carem Caum'', and themselves urged, in ignorance of what had already been done at Bushehr, the expediency of abandoning that station. The remarks of the Court on this occasion and their policy of with drawal from Persia were highly distasteful to the authorities at Bombay; and the Government of that Presidency were not slow to find, in a request of the Directors themselves that Gilan raw silk should be pro- enred, which could be done most conveniently at Bushehr^ an excuse for -opening the question of the Bushehr Residency. They were also re' Orders of the Bombay Government and Court of Directors, 1769. Efforts of the Bombay Government to re-estab lish the Bnshehr Residency, 1769-1770. annoyed, it would appear, by the persistent efforts of the Agent and Council to concentrate the whole of the Company^s trade in the Gulf at Basrah j and their first step was to appoint a Committee consisting of Messrs. Wrench, Jervis and Martin, of whom the two first had served in the Gulf, to report whether the Basrah Agency should not be transferred to Bushehr and the establishment at Basrah reduced to the rank of a Residency. The Committee, after consulting Messrs. Morley and Skipp, who had apparently returned to Bombay, reported on the 3rd of November 1769 in favour of a fortified Factory at Bushehr, which, in their opinion, would be as secure as the existing settlement at Basrah and a great deal more advantageously placed for trade j for they believed the demand for woollens in Persia to be much larger than that in the countries served by Basrah, and they thought it not unreasonable to estimate that Karim Khan would take two or three lakhs of rupees worth of woollen goods from the Company every year, provided that1804 Return to Bushehr prohibited by the Court of Directors, August 1770. raw ^ silk were accepted from him in payment; whereas, under the existing system, Persian merchants were obliged to visit Turkish terri tory, which they disliked doing, in order to make their purchases at Basrah, and could not offer as high prices there, on account of tlie expenses of the journey, double customs, etc., as if the goods were delivered to them at Bushehr. Meanwhile anxious enquiries were made from the Commanders of tlie u Expedition' and Fancy at Eushehr, on behalf of the Shaikh, whether the British intended to re-settle at that part, and the local merchants would gladly have bought cloth, had there been any on board the cruisers ; but the Agent and Council adhered firmly to their plan of sending nothing to Bushehr and of so compelling the Persian trade to come to Basrah. In September 1769, in order to avoid giving offence to Karim Khan, who was then at war with the Imam of Masqat, the Basrah A gency decided not to arrange a special convoy for the 'Omani coffee fleet to enable it to reach Basrah : this decision, which was contrary to their own inclinations, was adopted in obedience to the spirit of orders which they had received from Bombay. In 1770 the Governor of Bombay in Council directed the Agent at Basrah to reply to Sheikh Nasir, who had written inviting the British to return to Bushehr, that, if the Vakil wished to see the Residency re-established and w T ould cause a letter to this effect to be sent to the Agenda, European gentleman would be deputed to discuss the matter with him. It was intended, in the event of this proposal being accepted, to send Mr. Morley to Shiraz with the same instructions — except those relating to Kharag—as Mr, Skipp had received on his last mission, and to demand the restoration of the ' Speedwell' and her cargo, which had been taken by Mir Mahanna in 1768. The Agent and Council at Basrah, however, were able to delay compliance with these unpalatable orders by representing that they had no suitable present to send Karim Khan and no trustworthy Linguist to accompany Mr. Morley, and that Shaikh Nasir himself was really indifferent on the subject; and their dilatory tactics were crowned witt success, for, in August 1770, a peremptorily worded despatch of the Court of 'Directors was transmitted overland from London to Basrah, with the utmost haste, conveying these orders : ' We hereby prohibit ff ypu in the strictest manner, not only from re-establishing Bushire, but ''from forming any other settlement in the Persian dominions without out * Katim Khan was said to receive a part of the revenue of Gilan and other districts in raw silk*1805 Mfit express permission. And if, contrary to our expectations, you should tell a have undertaken either the one or the other, we in this case require ' and direct you forthwith to withdraw such settlement.'^ The Directors iccountji, considered that the expenses of maintaining a Residency in Persia — even 5 gooi apart from the risk, which, as the idea of a fortified Factory was in their opinion absurd, they thought must be considerable—were likely more iandersi than to counterbalance the better prices that might be obtained for • tk | woollens at Bushehr, besides which the competition of the new settlement i audtfe would injure Basrah; and they remarked particularly on an admission any on 1 made by the Bombay Committee, that one-third of the woollens sold at 0 their pi; Basrah already found their way to Persia. Mantel In the autumn of 1770 the general outlook was so peaceful that it Serious (i W as reported from Basrah that two cruisers would be amply sufficient kharag and f Masql | or the service of the Gulf: and friendly overtures for the settling of a oth ® r MJ . . 0 on British British Factory at Rig were received from Husain Khan, the successor of and other n, wticl Mahanna. But this favourable aspect of affairs was deceptive and ^ une jdieneel 0 f s hort duration. On the 2^nd of June 1771 three Gallivats belonging ^ to Kharag took possession, off Kangun, of the Britannia, an English krahb ^ Snow from Bombny, laden with Sugar, Iron, Spices, etc., belonging to 1 toretii 'Mr. Shaw, and of a country Ketch from Gogo under English colours, re-eskli 'laden with Cotton and Gruff, besides a Botalla Ketch and Sundry boats the igs from Muscat.'' The news of this affairreached the Basrah Agency on itterwi; the 9th of July; and, on the 12th, Commodore Ince was sent with the cepMjt: u Resolution/'' Expedition ' and ' Dolphin ^ to obtain intelligence and , thoserfili to deliver to the chief of Kharag a letter from the Agent demanding iission, ff restitution. If this letter failed of its effect, the Commodore was to go,wE recover the vessels taken and capture the piratical Gallivats, if possible; otherwise he was to arrange for convoying British upward-bound vessels able to i from Masqat to Basrah, and, if his doing so would serve any useful that tlf purpose^ to watch the island of Kharag. At the time of Commodore orthyi Ince's visits to Kharag and Rig, the latter of which was paid on the jelfwas' 1 14th of July, the pirates had not yet returned home with their prizes ; crowJ 1 and, after sending a Linguist on shore at Rig with the letter for Husain jgpatct Khan and receiving a satisfactory answer to the same, he returned to on to ^ Basrah on the 26th or 27th of July with the Expedition' and .erebj F 1 Dolphin,' having made no arrangements for the protection of British gftisfe ^adeabove Masqat. On the 27th of July the Britannia' and the ms witW ( ' 0 go Ketch arrived at Rig from Bahrain, where they had been detained in the meanwhile by strong north-westers ; but the ' Britannia' grounded on a bank and ^vas seriously damaged by rough weather before1806 Punitive expedition proposed by the Agent and Council at Basrah. she floated again with the tide; and more than half of her cargo had already been disposed of by the pirates on the Arab side of the Gulf. The treatment of the captured crews was inhumane, and while at Rig they could hardly obtain the least shelter from the sun or the commonest necessaries of life. On the 1st of August, under orders from Karim Khan, Captain Shaw and Mr. Nicholson, the first officer of tlie ' Britannia,' left for Shiraz, where they were to be examined concerning the ship ; s cargo ; but the former, as it was afterwards stated, expired on the way. Mr. Rowe, the second officer, and part of the crew were sent by Husain Khan in boats direct to the Agency at Basrah ; while the remainder, except a few lascars, arrived safely at the same place on the 16th of August, having made the journey via Bushehr, where they were well treated by the Shaikh. Husain Khan had verbally assured the Linguist, during the stay ot the latter at Rig, that Karim Khan and the Shaikh of Bushehr were the persons really responsible for the late piracies, and that he himself, though his vessels were involved, wished to be friends with the British and would even make over the island of Kharag to them on condition of receiving their protection ; but in his letter to the Agent he asserted Karim Khan's innocence as well as his own and laid the whole blame for the incident on the ' Britannia which he falsely accused of having attacked the Gallivats first, so compelling them to capture her in self- defence. In the same missive he gave a formal promise, which he did not afterwards see fit to redeem, that he would deliver up the ' Britannia' immediately on her arrival at Rig. The Agent and Council at Basrah, partly relying on the verbal statement of this unreliable Khan, contradicted though it was by his own written communication, and interpreting in a unfavourable sense the presence of three agents of the Vakil at Rig, the summons which Captain Shaw and Mr. Nicholson received to appear at Shiraz, and the failure of Karim Khan to answer at once a letter which the A gent had written him enquiring whether the piracies were committed by his orders, inform^ the Court of Directors in London that there was not a doubt of Karim: Khan^s complicity, and suggested to the Government of Bombay the despatch of a large mixed force to the Gulf for the purpose of punishing the Yakil and of extirpating the pirates by whom the Gulf had begun to be infested. These objects, they thought, could be effected by a squadron consisting of a large ship for battering, of one or more first and second rates, of a bomb vessel, and of ten or twelve small craft to pursue Gallivats in shoal water, the whole carrying a land force of 500 European(02€) 1807 et tsj, at ] east) a train of artillery, and 1,B00 to 2,000 sepoys. The o{ ''l operandi which they proposed was a sudden raid into the Gulf, either twith or without the assistance of the Imam of 'Oman, in the course of the Hormuz, BQshebr, Kharag and Ka'ab fleets should be fro® Ii destroyed in succession, to the estimated number of a dozen Gallivats, licet i 7 or 8 Gallivats and ii ships, 10 Gallivats, and 14 or 15 Gallivats respec- .edeonin tively, exclusive of armed boats. They also contemplated the ravaging atei B) or se i z ing of islands, ports, and other places in the Gulf that either lew jtii yielded revenue to Karim Khan or afforded refuge to pirates. 1 i tft When this scheme came to the knowledge of the Court of Directors place oi j n November 1771, they wrote at once to their servants at Basrah to vetoed by , prohibit its execution, for they considered that the cost of the operations ^h-ectors^ 0f would be altogether out of proportion to the advantages which the November &gt; the stii Company derived from their trade with the Persian Gulf; their orders ikkflj were that recourse should be had to negotiation rather than to force of at he hi arms, and that, if pacific means in the end proved ineffectual, an applica- h the I tion for protection and assistance should be made by the Bombay Govern- i conii mentto the Officer Commanding His Majesty^s Ships in the East Indies, he m. I n meanwhile, if insecurity continued, a rendezvous should be established at Masqat and convoys arranged between that place and Lgec [ 0 f J Basrah. So far as can be ascertained, no further steps were taken in the ■e her iJ matter. whiclili In the spring of 1773, in circumstances which are described in the Continued eliverif history of Turkish Iraq, Mr. Moore and his Council decided on leaving tanding with e Agei Basrah because of an epidemic of plague then raging ; and in the passage ementoll down the Shatt-al-'Arab, the ' Tyger one of their two vessels, having the ' Tyger' own fi become separated from the other, was captured on the 26th of April by ^ deten- ) the Gtallivats from Rig, Messrs. John Beaumont and George Green of the Messrs. Captain Basrah Agency, who were on board of her, being at the same time taken ^n^Green, ^il U r e o{l prisoners. During the following summer Mr. Moore and most of his staff 1773-1775, d wrltte were a t Bombay; but a member of the Agency, Mr. Abraham, with derSj as assistant, was apparently left at Masqat with orders to ubt of ^ P rocee( i to Bushehr, where he was to keep himself informed of the if Borff Sailitai T sta-te of Basrah. He was also to endeavour to obtain the 0 f p# rest ^ u ^ of the ' Tyger' and the release of Messrs.

According to information which reached the Agent at Masqat on his return to the Grulf in November 1773, Karim Khan Lad taken a part of the valuables found on board the &lt;l Tyger ' for himseli and caused a part to be given to the captors a reward, had directed the commanders of the Gallivats to prosecute hostilities against the British, and had ordered the conversion of the 'Tyger' into a Gallivat; but this report, which was not corroborated by Karim Khan's subsequent attitude, may not have been entirely correct. Messrs. Beaumont and Grreen themselves wrote from ShTraz that they had applied to the Vakil for their liberty and had received a temporising reply ; but they were silent in regard to the nature of their treatment. This, however, was after wards ascertained to have been good after reaching Shiraz, where they were allowed seven rupees (then worth seventeen shillings and sixpence) a day for their expenses, had a house of their own and full liberty to walk about as they pleased, and were treated with kindness and respect by the inhabitants. The only thing taken from them was Mr. Green's watch, which Karim Khan kept for himself. The returning Agency Staff, on their way up the Gulf in December j 1773, visited Bandar ■'Abbas and Bushehr. Shaikh Mahmud, the Governor of Bandar ^Abbas, was absent on a visit to Shiraz; but an ex change of amenities took place between the Agent and the Shaikh^ son, the latter even going so far as to offer the former Dutch Factory to the British in case they wished to settle again at Bandar ^Abbas. Fronj this place a letter, written by Mr. Latouche under Mr. Moore's orders and containing a message for the Vakil, was despatched to the address of j Messrs. Beaumont and Green. On arrival at Bushehr, a few days later, a letter from the Governor of Bombay to Karim Khan was handed to Shaikh Nasir for transmission; but, as no competent Persian writer could be obtained on the spot, it had 1 to be sent without a covering communication from the Agent,—' an omission for which the Shaikh was asked to make the proper apologies While Mr. Abraham went on shore to arrange this business, a Persian merchant named *S.gha Kachik, the factotum of the Shaikh BusheM remained on board the ' Revenge, 3: where he purchased a large quantify of sugar on behalf of his employer, himself, and others. At the time ^ this visit to Bushehr, the captured British vessel Tyger, ' along wM the Rig fleet and three Gallivats and an old ship belonging to Bushehr, was lying near Kangun in readiness to proceed on a cruise against the *Q,uaere, Agha Kuchik?1809 Imam of Masqat; but tbe Ka^ab Shaikh could not be induced to send the ^ naval contingent which was demanded of him ; and the expedition never H sailed, t lil communication made to Karim Khan had no immediate bene- ^ ficial effect, for, after the arrival of the Agent and Council at Basrah, ^ he still detained Messrs. Beaumont and Green at Shiraz; but he appa- U ren ^|y gtill gave them an allowance for their maintenance and made no objection to their corresponding with their friends. At the beginning of ^ February 1774 they wrote that it was the intention of the Vakil to demand naval aid from the British and the Turks against the Imam of Masqat and, in event of a refusal, to send a force to destroy Basrah, This report, as it agreed with information received from an independent source, caused some uneasiness to the Agent and Council; and the Turkish Mutasallim had some difficulty in persuading them, on the ground that their action might cause a panic at Basrah, not to place the Company's goods on board ship, even for the purpose of facilitating a speedy removal in case such should become necessary. At the beginning of March some correspondence was in progress between the Basrah Agency and the Vakil; but, according to a letter from Messrs. Beaumont and Green, which was closed at Shiraz on the 5th and received at Basrah on the 19th of that month, Karim Khan had no intention of releasing them, and was determined on the contrary to treat all British subjects and ships as those of a hostile power until his demand for naval assist ance against Masqat should have been conceded. In their opinion, the pacific policy so far pursued towards the Vakil had only em boldened him to regard the East India Company as timid and of no account. Only a few days later, however, it was reported that Shaikh Nasir of Bushehr, who for the moment was in high favour with Karim Khan, was on his way to Bushehr to negotiate, as a plenipotentiary from Karim Khan, with the Imam of ; Oman; that he was bringing Messrs. Beaumont and Green with him; and that he had written to his brother. Shaikh Sa'dun, to prepare the British Residency building at Bushehr for the reception of the two gentlemen : it was surmised that their release from detention at Shiraz was due either to Shaikh Nasir himself, who was anxious to see a British Factory re-established at Bushehr, or to Coja Sarguise,' an Armenian merchant of &lt;f most execrable character/' , hut possessing an unaccountable influence at Shiraz, to whom the Agent had promised a reward of S5,000 in case of his exerting himself success fully in the case. No further concession, however, could be obtained from 124 Continued deteation of Messrs. Beau mont and Green at Shiraz, 1774, Transfer of Messrs. Beaumont and Green to Bushehr, March 17741810 Release of Mr. Green, September 1774 Karim Khan at this time j and fresh reeraits, among whom the Shaikh* of Charak was conspicuous, were constantly being added to the number of the piratical Arab chieftains in the Persian Gulf ; while Shaikh Nasir apparently, on his arrival at the coast, gave himself up entirely to the task of arranging a settlement with the ruler of Masqat. In these circumstances the Agent and Council, without obtaining the instructions of their superiors at Bombay, endeavoured to put pressure on Karim Khan by arranging for a boycott of his ports by all British vessels j and it is clear that, but for strict injunetions by the Bombay Government against bringing about an unauthorised rupture^ they would have proceeded to make seizure of a large quantity of Persian property carried by a British vessel, a The Four Friends.'' On the 17th August 1774 Shaikh Nasir returned to Bushehr from a journey to the southward which he had undertaken in connection with the Perso-'Omani difficulty, but which had not included as at first in tended,—perhaps because it was known tbat the demand of the Vakil for tribute would be regarded as merely insulting,—an interview with a representative of the Imam at Khor Fakkan; and Messrs. Beaumont and Green then reminded him of a promise that he had made of sending them to Basrah immediately on his return. The Shaikh at first refused to treat them otherwise than as prisoners^ alleging as the reason his fear oi Karim Khan^s displeasure; but at length he decided to mahe them the medium of overtures to the Agency on his own behalf, and even to allow Mr. Green to be the bearer of his proposals, in which capacity that gentle man reached Basrah on the 19th of September following. The terms of settlement suggested by the Shaikh were that, on condition of a European gentleman or an Armenian merchant being posted provisionally to Bushehr as Resident and the trade with that place re-opened, the ' Tyger ,; and her stores should be returned to the British, the Shaikh should undertake the responsibility for any piracies that might be committed on them iQ future by the Eig or Ganaveh fleets, and Mr. Beaumont should be set at liberty. These conditions were declined by the Agency, who had received orders from Bombay not to enter into any arrangement ' till the release of Messrs. Beaumont and Green was absolutely effected but they were confident that perseverance in that policy, to which and to the commercial boycott of Bushehr they attributed the advances now made by N&amp; sir Khan, was the means most likely to procure with credit the enlargement of Mr. Beaumont likewise and it was not, apparently, considered necessary for Mr. Green to return into formal captivity at Bushehr. * The Shaikh of Charak was hardly a new recruit, but there had been no of his bebaviour since 1767.18U ini 1 150 # The Government o£ Bombay, who were heartily tired o£ the die- agreemenfc with Karim Khan and of its direct and indirect conse- queuecS;—in particular the frequent and prolonged detention in the Gulf, at a heavy cost ; of the Company^ armed vessels, the impri sonment of Mr. Beaumont^ and the prevalence of piracy,—resolved in February 1775 to bring all these troubles to an end, if possible, by a change both of measures and of men. They accordingly authorised Mr. Robert Garden, who had previous experience of the Gulf and was now proceeding on private business to Basrah, to take up the question of Mr. Beaumont's release on his way at Bushehr, and, if he found that it could not be effected nor security restored in the Gulf by any other means, to re-establish the Bushehr Residency on a small scale, notwith standing that this was in direct opposition to the orders of the Court of Directors. At the same time they strictly enjoined the Agent and Council at Basrah to give effect to any arrangement into which Mr. Garden might enter under these instructions. Before Mr. Garden could arrive, however, and open relations with Karim Khan through Bushehr, a crisis had occurred at Basrah^ as more fully explained in the history of Turkish •'Iraq, which brought the Agency into direct conflict with some of the VaklFs subjects or subordi nate allies. A Persian invasion of 'Iraq which had long been threatened was now, in consequence of a defeat inflicted by the Turks on the Persians in Kurdistan, actually carried out; and on the 7 th of April 1775, on the very day of Mr. Garden's reaching Bushehr, a large force that had recently crossed the Ottoman frontier under the command of Sadiq Khan, Karim Khan's brother, commenced to besiege Basrah. Two or three weeks earlier Mr. Moore and his Council, had imprudently allowed the Company's vessels under their orders to attack a fleet of Ka'ab Gallivats as it was pushing up the Shatt-al-'Arab to join the Persian army near Qurnah; this was done with considerable success ; and the Agent then wrote to Mr. Beaumont at Bushehr to send any cruiser that ^ight call there to his assistance with the utmost despatch. On the Hth of April, however, dismayed by the approach of a large Persian fleet of some 60 sail up the river towards the already invested town, the Agent and his Council changed their minds and hurriedly left Basrah ^ith their vessels, abandoning the whole of the Company's property there to its fate. As if further to embroil matters, the British squadron lr i descending the Shatt-al-'Arab become partially engaged, near the ^outh of the Karun, with the ascending Bushehr fleet, which was com manded by Shaikh Nasir; and tiring continued for some hours, but without material damage to either side. 124) a.

Satiefactory settlement with Mr. Garden, 34th April 1775. Mr. Garden^ being informed of wliat had occurred at Basrah up to the time of the British attack on the Ka'ab Grallivats^ very judiciously decided not to proceed any further on the way to Basrah with his cruiser and the three unarmed vessels that accompanied it, whereby lie would have endangered property of the East India Company and of private merchants to the amount of about 0,00,000, but rather to avert the trouble which might otherwise spring from the rash proceedings of the Agent and Council by concluding, with the least possible delay ; a general settlement with Karim Khan. Accordingly, on the 11th of April, he despatched a letter to Karim Khan, explaining his mission; and Shaikh Sa^dun and the local Persian merchants did not hesitate to assure him of a favourable answer,—' as the Khan has nothing more at heart than the establishment of an 'English Factory in his dominions; &lt;f and that he could think of no other means of effecting it than by the a detention of Mr. Beaumont, not chusing to make any further overtures ' to Mr. Moore, against whom he was highly incensed; and Shaikli Nassir, in a conversation he had with Mr. Beaumont the night before ' his departure, assured him that Mr. Moored obstinacy had been the ' cause of the present war, for, had the English colours been hoisted ' at Bushire, the present expedition would not have taken place. ;; On the 15th of April, the fugitive Agent and his Council having arrived at Bushehr with news of all that had occurred up to the 11th, Mr. Garden wrote a second letter to Karim Khan, asking him to order his general at Basrah to take all possible care of British property there ,* and at the same time he addressed Shaikh Nasir of Bushehr, who was still with the Persian forces, in a similar sense. On the 24th of the month a satisfactory reply was received from the Yakil, laying the blame for the disagreement between the British and the Persians entirely on Mr. Moore, and promising the restoration of the «Tyger ' on her return from Basrah, against which she had been sent; Messrs. Beaumont and Green were declared to be released; and on the 26th the Union Jack was hoisted once more over the British Factory p Bushehr, where Mr. Garden had taken up his residence. As Shaikh Nasir, moreover, received with joy the news of Mr. Garden^ arrival at Bushehr, protesting that his friendship for the British had not been diminished even by the fracas in the Shatt-al-^Arab, and as the question of the damage inflicted on the Ka ; ab fleet by the British cruisers P Basrah never afterwards came into discussion, Mr. Garden's settlement may fairly be regarded as complete and satisfactory. It ushered in a short period of pleasant and harmonious relations with the central0 1813 Persian Government wbich was terminated only by the death of Karim Khan. When Basrah^ on the 16tli of April 1776, at length surrendered to the Persians, Mr, Garden and Mr. Moore had apparently both returned to India ; Mr. Beaumont was in charge of the Bushehr Residency, to which on his release he had been appointed by Mr. Garden ; a Mr. Galley had gone to Basrah to look after the interests and property of the East India Company there, in an informal manner ; and the rest of the Agency Staff, at the head of whom was now Mr. Digges Latouche, were watching events from Bushehr. Mr. Galley having been well received at Basrah by Sadiq Khan, who on the 20th of April placed him in possession of the British Factory building, Mr. Latouche decided to return to Basrah with as little delay as possible ; and on the 5th of May, after being detained at Bushehr for some time by adverse winds, he and his party sailed for Basrah in a native vessel, taking with them handsome presents for Sadiq Khan and Skaikh Nasir of Bushehr, the latter of whom was still at Basrah with his fleet and had shown a good disposition towards' Mr. Galley. Early in June 1776 the Agent and his Council were able to report that the Factory had been successfully re-established, that the Persians seemed very well disposed towards them, and that everything promised well for the future. About the same time the assembled Persian fleets were dispersed, and the commanders returned with their vessels to their own ports, Shaikh Nasir reaching Bushehr upon the 30th of June. The administration which the Persians had set up in Basrah was, however, as explained in the history of Turkish ^Iraq, far from 8atisfac- tory ; in September 1776 the Agency found themselves subjected to severe restraint; and in February 1777 the behaviour of the Persian Governor, Ali Muhammad Khan, was such that it obliged them to shut themselves np in the Factory and to appeal by letter to Karim Khan at Shiraz. This protest on their part was eminently successful, for not only did the Gover nor at once make advances to them, which they thought it advisable to disregard until their letter should have been answered, but the Vakil, on becoming aware of the situation at Basrah, sent stringent orders to ^Ali Muhammad Khan to show the utmost respect for the British and wrote a cordial letter to Mr. Latouche, received by that gentleman on the 17th of March 1777. In June 1777 another advantageous Farman was granted to the Agent by Karim Khan.

These orders, dated 4th July 1777, did not reach Bombay until the 30th April in the following year, nor were steps taken by the Bombay Governmelt to put them into efliect before the 2nd of August 1778, when, in view of the probability of a war with France and the consequent necessity of maintaining a news-forwarding station at Basrah, -as also of the desirability of having two servants in the Gulf, the one to replace the other in case of accident, they resolved on their own responsibility so far to modify the instructions of the Court as for the time being to maintain two separate and independent Residencies, consisting of one post each, at Basrah and Bushehr respectively. Mr. Latouche was to have the choice of the two, and the one which he did not take was to be offered in succession to Mr. Beaumont and to Mr. Green. Further delay occurred at Basrah, in the execution of those orders, and at some time in the winter of 1778-1779 a revolution took place there, bringing the town once more under the jurisdiction of the Ottoman Government, upon which Mr. Latouche considered himself justified in referring the matter back to Bombay for fresh orders. In the meantime he retained his status as Agent and kept Mr. Abraham with him as his Assistant. Events at Rig and Kharag, 1763-79. tTnsucoess- ful endeav ours of the Vakil to reduce Mir In the preceding sections we have dealt fully with the affairs of the Persian Coast in so far as they had a bearing on British policy and action, but it remains to notice some events of more exclusively Persia or local interest which occurred at certain important places. The history of Rig and Kharag relates, during the first years of this period, principally to the doings of Mir Mahanna, the piratical chief of Rig who expelled Mr. Wood from Rig in 1756, as mentioned iii the1815 Chapter (M the general history of this Persian Gulf, and to whom it has Muhanna of frequently been necessary to refer in the earlier sections of the present dience, 1764- elapter aiso. On some occasion between 1756 and 1764, Mir Mahanna, 65, w jio for a short time in 1755 or 1756 had been imprisoned at Sinraz, fell again into the hands of Karim Khan ; bnt owing to the good offices of the raler of Tangistan. to whom one of his sisters was married, his second captivity also was of short duration. He persisted, however, in his opposition to Kanm Khan, committed raids by which caravans passing between Bushehr and Shiraz were seriously endangered; and he once defended his town of Rig with success, when it was attacked by the Vakil with a large force on the landward side. His relations with his neighbours, the Shaikh of Bushehr on the one side and the Ka'ab Shaikh on the other, were generally unfriendly. In 176i Karim Khan made a formal demand for tribute, which Mir Mahanna rejected with contempt, causing the beard of the messenger to be shaved, whereupon the Vakil declared war against him and sent a force down to the coast to undertake land operations against Rig under the command of Amir Kuhneh Khan. From February to May 1765 the Khan remained encamped at Khurmuj, endeavouring to obtain from the local maritime chiefs that naval assistance which he saw to be indispensable for the success of his campaign ; but except from the Shaikh of Bushehr, whose relations with Mir Mahanna were hostile and the prosperity of whose town depended on its connections with Shiraz, but whose fleet could not alone deal with that of Mir Mahanna, he was unable to secure any ; and so distrustful of his intentions were the people of Kangun in particular, who like Mir Mahanna paid no tribute to the Vakil, that they were said at this time to sleep every night on board of their vessels. At the end of May 1765, when British naval aid had at last been promised, Kuhneh Khan marched against Rig; but Mir Mahanna almost immediately evacuated it and withdrew to K hargu, whereupon there ensued the abor tive Anglo-Persian attempts at crushing him which have been described aibove in an earlier paragraph. After the break-up of the joint expedi tion, in July 1765, the Persian forces remained for some time in occupa tion of Rig. In the month of August following, Mir Mahanna caused two of his own sisters to be drowned in the sea, apparently because the Kaab Shaikh, whom he disliked, had demanded -one of them in marriage for a son and he considered this the most convenient way of evading the request. Mir Mahanna, who was at this time still under 30 years of age, tad already destroyed his own first-born child by causing it to be exposed to the sun upon the sea beach, his only reason for doing so being that it Was a daughter and not a son.1816 The Dutch oettlement 8n Kharag under Mynheer Buschman, 1768-65. Protest by the Dutch Governor of Kharag against British Proceedings at Bandar 'Ahbas, 1764. The Vakil Karim Khan, early in his reign, several times called on the Dutch to pay tribute on account of Kharag ; but so uncompromising was the answer invariably returned that by 1765 he had ceased to refer to the subject. During the prolonged attack made by British and Bushelir vessels on Mir Mahanna at Khargu, in the early summer of 1765, Mynheer Buschman observed strict neutrality and kept the port of Kharag open to both sides. This was the period of the celebrated Niebuhr^s visit to Kharag, where he remained as the guest of the Dutch from the 31st of May to the 31st July 1765 ; and an interesting account of the place as it then was, with its fort and garden, warehouses, cara- vansarai, bazaar, and town of stone-built houses and mat huts, as well as of its Dutch, Armenian, Hindu, Persian and Arab inhabitants and their mode of life, is given in his writings. The residences of the Dutcli were provided with Sardabs, or cool cellars for summer use, which in some cases were fitted with Badgirs or ventilators; but there was no proper Euro pean church, either Protestant or Catholic, and the only minister of religion that ever visited Kharag was a Carmelite priest from Bushehr. Outside the town the Armenians had a pretty little church with a bell,—a rare feature in those countries. A belated protest was made by the Dutch Governor of Kharag, in August 1764, against a part of the proceedings of the British in their retirement from Bandar 'Abbas in the previous year. It was addressed to the British A gent at Basrah and was couched in the following terms You will not take amiss by this present my giving yon a detail of the irregul ai ' conduct and of the violence committed by the English gentlemen at Bunder Abassy against cur Factory, under pretence of driving out the Persians who had retired there. You surely, Sir, are not ignorant that they did not fear breaking open the doors with hatchets, also the windows, as well as burning the platforms on which were formerly cannon ; in a word their committing all manner of hostilities in the Factory, not even sparing the effects of the Inspector of said Factory, J. Jacob Christanus, and by which means he was depriv'd of all he possess'd, and the Factory render'd entirely defenceless and that to the scandal of our Company. I come, therefore, Sir, by this present to protest to you, a Chief of the English Company in the Persian Gulph, and my (? me ) representing the Dutch Company, against all those attempts and violences committed by your nation against the goods and honour of our Company, and pretend to an entii 10 indemnity ior all the wastes and losses our Company and the Inspector of the Factory have suffer'd on the occasion ; Caeback 29t/i August 1764. Sign'd without compliment, W. BUSCHMAN. To this letter the British Agent replied that he had no personal knowledge of the facts, and he returned the document^ advisingf04r 1817 patcli Governor that it should be submitted to the Government of B mbay Nothing more was apparently heard of the matter, which had arisen through a complaint made by the Inspector Christanus men tioned in the protest, and in regard to which Mynheer Buschman was careful to explain, in a covering letter, that he only acted under instruc- tions from the Supreme Council in Batavia. At the end of July 1765 Mynheer Buschman, who had applied for The Dutch leave of absence on the ground of health, was relieved by a Mynheer van on Houting, a gentleman of ability, well connected in Holland, but under altogether ignorant of the languages and the politics of the Gulf. Routing,™ Mynheer Buschman had recommended a German named Tamm or Temm who had come to Kharag as a private soldier and had risen by merit to a clerkship and finally to the position of Second, to act as his locum tenens j but the Council in Batavia, though prepared to grant Tamm some substantial advantages, would not give him the Chief ship; and he having become aware of this, but not of the special arrangements which it was intended to make in his favour, gave way to despair and blew his brains out before the arrival of Mynheer van Houting. In the month of September 1765, Mir Mahanna, who still occupied Disastrous Khargu and only a few of whose people had as yet returned to Rig, Dutch on^ gained a victory over his enemy Shaikh Nasir and proceeded to blockade Khargu by ... ii ' ji * MirMahanna, Bushehr, insisting that the Dutch also should suspend their trade with October that port. On the 9th of October Mynheer van Houting, who was 1765 - unwilling to submit to the dictation of a savage, sent two large India- men and three Gallivats against Khargu; and the Shaikh of Bushehr, delighted at the turn of events, hastened with his fleet and a considerable land force to join the Dutch. The Dutch burned one of Mir Mahanna^s Gallivats and destroyed two others, but after this they could do him no more damage from the sea, for he had carefully fortified his position ' and, so to speak, almost buried himself in the ground/' 7 At length the allies decided on a landing ; and, as their disembarkation was not opposed, they quickly reached the houses of the inhabitants, where they all, even the Dutch European troops, gave themselves up to plunder. Mir Mahanna, seeing the invaders scattered and disorganised, suddenly attacked them with a body of cavalry, of which the existence even had not been suspected, and drove them into the sea with heavy loss. On the part of the Dutch 7 0 Europeans were killed, while about a dozen escaped, wounded, by swimming off to the ships; and the Shaikh of r was said to have lost 200 men. The Dutch were so weakened that they found themselves obliged to return to Kharag1818 Capture of the Dutch settlement on Kharag by Mir Mahanna, 1st January 1766. and to prepare, by throwing up new batteries/ for the defence of tlie place. Mir Mahanna was not slow to follow up his success by invading tlie Island of Kharag. The transportation of his troops from Khargu across the intervening strait was so arranged that the larger Dutcli vessels could not be used to prevent it ; and ultimately the Dutch witli a fighting force of about 200, including a considerable proportion of Europeans, found themselves besieged in the town of Kharag by 500 men under Mir Mahanna. About midnight on the 31st December 1765, after a thirteen days' siege, the Arabs escaladed the town wall and took possession of one of its bastions; &lt;c and the next morning, though there- ^were above 60 or 70 Europeans in the Fort, they delivered it up on condition of retiring in safety to what place they chose, not having had above 8 or 9 men killed and wounded.' This final surrender, otherwise inexplicable, seems to have been due to the treacherous seizure of Mynheer van Houting and his suite by Mir Mahanna at an interview in the Fort, to which, on the advice of a Persian confidential agent of the Governor, they had been admitted for the purpose of discussing terms; and the circumstance that the military commandant, an altogether inexperienced officer from Batavia, was taken prisoner along with the Chief makes this explanation appear in itself sufficient. Two of the Dutch Company's ships, which had been lying in the roadstead during these occurrences, set sail down the Gulf immediately upon the flag of truce being hoisted on the Fort; but the Governor sent a boat after them with orders for one to return and convey himself and his people to Bandar ^ Abbas or Cochin. The Dutch then took their departure, leaving all their goods behind; and on the 4th January 1766 Mynheer van H outing and his party, including about 50 soldiers, arrived at Bushehr, where Mr. Jervis, the British Resident, supplied them with money and other necessaries in exchange for bills. Among the property which fell into the hands of Mir Mahanna at the capture of Kharag ^ a man-of-war belonging to the Imam of Masqat, which had recently discharged a cargo of coffee there. So ended the costly and unremunerative experiment of a fortified Dutch settlement on Kharag, and no attempt was made to renew it. Apart from the initial outlay on defensive Works and armed vessels, the chief item of expenditure had been the pay of some 90 European soldier and 50 European sailors who formed the ordinary garrison: this was** recurrent charge and it was rendered heavier by the great annual mor- tality among the men, due less to the climate than to their manner of1819 |^ e About the time of Mynheer Buschman's becoming Governor the Kbarag settlement would probably have been abandoned^ had it not been that 'the growing tranquillity of Persia gave hope of better commercial results in the future^ and that Mynheer Buschman was able to remove the chief local difficulty by making peace with Mir Mahanna. It was expected that Mir Mahanna would shortly send an expedition Mir Mahan- from his new stronghold on Kharag against either Bushehr or Bahrain; ^ t ^ )vern ' and Mr. Jervis, the British Resident at Bushehr, while he admitted the Kharag, existence of a report that Mir Mahanna intended to respect British property, was therefore inclined to recommend an attack on Kharag, which, he was assured, could be captured by two bomb-vessels. The Government of Bombay, however, ordered him to abstain from inter ference between the Dutch or the Persians and Mir Mahanna, and not to employ for the reduction of Kharag any part of the expedition that had been sent to the Gulf to chastise the Ka'ab. At the beginning of April, perhaps on account of the judicious neutrality of the British, but possibly in consequence of a promise by Karim Khan to send a large force to the aid of the Shaikh of Bmhehr,— an engagement which, it was thought, the Vakil might have some difficulty in fulfilling at that season of the year,—the situation was still perfectly quiet. In May 1766 it was reported by the Agent and Council at Basrah that Mir Mahanna had shown ' the greatest proofs of his respect and regard ' for the English, having behaved in a most friendly manner towards the /'gentlemen of the Berkshire and Four Friends, who called in at Carrack to furnish themselves with proper pilots to conduct them into Bussora River' ; and Mr. Wrench and his associates expressed themselves as altogether averse to conceding a request by the Shaikh of Bushehr for the assistance of the Company's naval force in the Gulf against Mir Mahanna, adding: ' besides, according to the opinion of the gentlemen 'above mentioned, Meermanna has made such additions to the fortifications 'of Carrack and preparations for his defence, having upwards of S^OO men, which they declare they saw when he mustered his forces in their ' presence, many of which are good horsemen, well trained, all in coats of mail, that we apprehend our force at present would be hardly sufficient a to dispossess him of that place, even had we orders to proceed against 'W.' In 1767 Mir Mahanna despoiled the Masqat coffee fleet of 380 ^ales of coffee out of a total of 550 ; and this particular trade was brought to a standstill in consequence, at least until the autumn, when ^ seems to have been arranged that a British ship should convoy the stocks remaining at Masqat on their passage up the Gulf.1820 As has already been mentioned, in the section on Biitish relations above, the East India Company^s officials at Basrah inclined after this, under the leadership of Mr. Moore^ to an alliance with Mir Mahanna against the Vakil; but the Government of Bombay disapproved o£ their policy ; and in 1768 Mr. Skipp was sent on a second mission to Shiraz, which resulted—as before described—in a combination between tlie British and Karim Khan against Mir Mahanna, and in an unsuccessful attack by the British on Kharag in the month of May 1768, this attack leading in its turn to the retaliatory seizure by Mir Mahatma, in August 1768, of the British vessel Speedwell. ,; The blood-stained career of Mir Mahanna was at length brought to a close by an insurrection among his own subjects, to whom his tyranny had become intolerable. A certain Darbas, the principal man in his service having been confined under his orders and treated with great severity on account of some trifling offence^ the leading Arab chiefs on Kharag entered into a conspiracy against the Mir; and on the night of the 26th of Jan uary 1769, after taking possession of a small work, they made an un successful attempt to seize his person, which drove him to take refuge with his immediate followers in a bastion of the main Fort. In this bas tion Mir Mahanna at first proposed to hold out; but, finding that he had no longer any party on the island, he changed his mind and managed to escape from Kharag in a small boat, accompanied by about 20 men who still adhered to him. From Kuwait he seems to have made his way to Basrah, where, at midnight on the 21st of March 1769, he was put to death by strangling under the orders of the Turkish Mutasallim. It was said at the time that the object of tha Turks ir^ thus disposing of the fugitive chief was to forestall a demand, which it would have been equally dishonourable ^ grant and dangerous to refuse, on the part of Karim Khan for his surrender, and it was believed that his head, after being seen by the Pasha at Baghdad, would be sent to the Vakil in Persia. On the flight of Mir Mahanna from Kharag, the administration of that place and of Rig devolved ; in some manner, on an individual named Husain Khan. According to the information received by^ 6 Basrah Agency, Husain Khan at first seemed ' to be wavering between ' his fear of the Caun and his desire of keeping possession of Carrack and its riches. Some reports Fay that his people are much disaffected t0 * The account given in the text differs somewhat from that of Parson 's (see ^ Travels, pages 195-198), but it is more reliable, as coming from a British official^ not from a Persian non-official source.1821 parson' 8 i i: «his Government and are dally leaving tlie island, that he intends ' delivering the eftects to the Caun, and that they are to be equally „ { | iv ided between the Meer and the Caun and the Persian army ; others {( ^ ig very desirous of our settling on the island, where he would 'give us a Factory, but not the Fort, as he first proposed ; and others « again say that the Meer has wrote to the Imaum o£ Muscat, requesting ' his friendship and promising to deliver over the effects and Gallivats o£ 'the island, if he will grant him his protection and admit of his 'followers' living unmolestedly at Muscat/' It would appear, however, that two persons representing Zaki Khan, the brother of Karim Khan, were allowed by the new chief to visit Kbarag and to make an inventory of the property there. The conduct of the Agent and Council at Basrah in opening negotia tions with Husain Khan and attempting to blockade the island and that of the Resident at Bushehr in abandoning his post have been noticed, together with the views and orders of the Bombay Government and of the Court of Directors thereon, in the section referring to British relations with the Persian Government; and here it is enough to observe that the East India Company in the end derived no advantage, unless by the disappearance of Mir Mahanna personally from the scene, from the revolu tion at Kharag. In 1770 Husain Khan invited the Company's servants to establish a Factory at Rig, no doubt as a substitute for the Residency that had been withdrawn from Bushehr ; but his offer, for reasons which cannot but be obvious on considering the relations of the East India Company with the Persian Government at the time, was politely declined by the Agent at Basrah. A serious piracy iu June 1771, committed by boats from Kharag upon the ' Britannia and another vessel under the British flag, brought the Company's representatives once more into correspond ence with Husain Khan ; but, as has been fully explained in an earlier paragraph, no decisive action against him was ever authorised, nor any satisfaction for the gross injury obtained. Events at Bushehr and in its neighbourhood, 1763-79. The affairs of Bushehr have already entered largely into our nar rative, chiefly because Bushehr was the port of Shiraz, through which the British maintained correspondence with Karim Khan; and we do not propose to return here to events already described and dis-1822 Relations of the Shaikh of Bushehr with the Persian Cen tral Govern ment, 1763- 69. Naval re sources of the Shaikh of Bushehr^ 1765-75. Affairs in cussed/such as the establishment of the British Residency at Bushehr in 1763, its withdrawal in 1 ?69, and its re-institution in 1775. Similarly the relations of the Shaikh of Bushehr with the British, with the Mir of Eig, and with the Vakil himself have already, in some degree, come under our notice ; and the part played by him in the affairs of 'Oman; Bahrain and Turkish ; Iraq will appear from the separate chapters ontb history of those countries. The attitude of Shaikh Nasir of Bushehr towards Karim Khan was ordinarily that of an obedient and even loyal vassal, as is shown by his undertaking service against Mir Mahanna in 1765 and against Basrah in 1775-76; but there were occasional differences between him and his suzerain. In 1767 a difficulty in regard to the tribute payable by the Shaikh on account of Bahrain, the same that had occasioned his imprisonment at Shiraz in 1755, arosa ; 4,000 Turnans a year were demanded of him by the Vakil for Bushehr and Bahrain together ; and, on his hesitating to comply, Karim Khan apparently sent a force under Zaki Khan into Dashtistan, closed the passes between Bushehr and, Shiraz, and incited the chief of Tangistan to take up arms against Shaikh Nasir. At the beginning of 1768 Shaikh Nasir's brother Sa'dun, who had been sent to Shiraz to negotiate, returned with a favourable answer; and friction ceased until about 1773. It was then renewed; but early in 1774 a fresh reconciliation was brought about by a voluntary visit of Shaikh Nasir himself to Shiraz, which so delighted the Vakil that he immediately appointed the Shaikh his plenipotentiary for the purpose of arranging a settlement with the Imam of ^Oman. With the countenance of Karim Khan, whose authority he represent ed in maritime matters in the upper Gulf, Shaikh Nasir of Bushehr steadily increased his fleet during this period. In 1765, at the time of the attack on Kharag, it consisted of a ship, 3 Gallivats and 2 Batils; in 1769, shortly after Mir Mahanna's death, of a ship, 4 Gallivats and 30 armed boats; in 1771, of two ships and 7 or 8 Gallivats, besides boats; and in 1775, during the siege of Basrah, of some 20 war Gallivats, carrying from 8 to 10 guns each, and a number of merchant vessels of 40 to 80 tons which could be, and sometimes were, used for naval purposes. In 1775 a 40-gun ship lay in a deep hole in the Bushehr harbour, out of which it could not be moved : it was said to have been captured from the Imam of Masqat, but it may have been merely the 'Omani vessel which, as already related, accidentally fell into the power of Mir Mahanna at Kharag in 1766. Karim Khan was accustomed, on pretext of requiring their advice or pod, *011 —1823 services, lut really in order to prevent risings against his gtUnd 5. ^ority in the provinces, to keep most of the hereditary chiefs of about 1765.

The Khan had appointed an nncle to haptenoi- ( Yern the district in his absence; but this substitute was blinded and displaced by Ja'far, a brother of the Khan. Amir Knbneh Khan, whom Kanm Khan sent to the coast with a force sll0 ^ljl a t the end of 1764 or beginning of 1765 to deal with Mir Mahanna, mihi fas commissioned to invest Ja^far Khan, by the way, with a robe of honour; but the usurper, no doubt correctly interpreting the real inten- tion of the Vakil, attempted, unsuccessfully, to destroy Kuhneh ^casiond | Khan's force in a narrow defile through which it had to pass. After isa yeaip, this failure Ja'far Khan took to the hills; but within a few days he togetlier;i was captured and sent to Shiraz, where, as a punishment, he was con- Himi demned to remove a m0un(i inside tl:ie towl1 to a P lace without the gates, fiuslieliii: Amir Kuhneh Khan, notwithstanding that Rig was his real objective arms at and that Dashti, after the capture of Ja'far, was perfectly submissive to brofcSil the Vakil's authority, insisted in or before February 1765 on destroying a kd tlle wllole town of with the exception of a mosque and an tk mi iniamzadeh. During his whole sojourn there he occupied an entrenched , J camp, as if in hostile country ; and, when in May he at last marched MM against iie le£t a detaetiment behind to collect the revenue of , , J Ahram in Tangistan and of the adjoining villages.

Events in the vicinity of Bandar 'Abbas and Hormuz ; 1763-1779, After the withdrawal of the British Agency from Bandar ; Abbas in 1763^ affairs in that quarter had no longer the same interest as before for the representatives of the East India Company^ and little mention of them is to be found in the official records. Mr. Price, on establishing a British Residency at Bushehr in 1763, sent orders to the Linguist at Kirman, who had formerly been dependent on the Agency at Bandar ^Abbas, to send whatever wool he had collected to Bushehr and not to incur any further expenses at Kirman on account of the Company. The indirect connection of the Khan of Lar and the Shaikh of Hormuz with the ' Islamabad^ case has already been noticed in the proper place. Nasir Khan of Lar having-failed to pay with regularity the revenue agreed upon between himself and Karim Khan in 1761, the Vakil, early in 1766, sent a large force against him under Sadiq Khan. The rrf of the operations seems to have been the reduction of Lar and the seizure of the Khan's treasures by the Persian army ; and thereafter nothing w 1016 is heard of a hereditary Khan of Lar. In 1773, when the Basrah Agent and staff, in returning Bombay, touched at Bandar 'Abbas, they found that the place had fallen into utter ruin. In the absence of the Governor, Shaikh Mahmud, who had gone to Shiraz, the port was being administered by his son ; and a rumour that Zaki Khan was at hand with a large army had caused it ^ be temporarily abandoned by most of its remaining inhabitants. Abdullah, Shaikh of Hormuz, after the submission of Lar and Bandar Abbas to the \ akil's authority, was apparently recognised W the connection between them, have already been dealt with in the section on British relations. In 1765 the port of Kangun appears to have been recalcitrant to the authority of Karim Khan, for, on the arrival of the Vakil's commaader Amir Kuhneh Khan at Khurmuj about the beginning of that year, the inhabitants not only refused to help him by sea against Mir Mahanna of Rig, but prepared to fight and took precautions against surprise by sleeping at night on board of their vessels instead of on terra firm, It seems probable that what they feared was an attempt to subject them to tribute. In 1767, at the time that there was trouble between the Vakil and the Shaikh of Bushehr, Karim Khan^s brother Zaki Khan, who had been sent with a force into Dashtistan, made a sudden raid on Kangun with 6,000 men and totally destroyed the place.

In September 1766 Captain Justice o£ the Berk- tral Govern- fct J shire,' who had lately spent three or four days at Hormuz to study, in ^L^'g. connection with the ' Islamabad ' case, the means of defence possessed St soipi by the Shaikh, reported 'that his fort was all in pieces, and not one of a M bis gun -carriages but what was useless; that his Gallivats were all in aljed ! very 0 bad order; that our ships could go within hail of the fort, and that, e Uft if they were to go, the fort could not hold out two hours.' In 1771, Wd It bowever, the Hormuz fleet consisted of about a dozen G alii vats, apparently idenji; quite efficient; and in November 1773 it was reported that the Hormuz Gallivats were out and were capturing every boat that they met ^ in the Gulf. It is clear that there was not a continuously good understanding between Shaikh 'Abdullah and his master, for, in 1773, the former joined with the Wali of Masqat and the Shaikh of Ras-al-Khaimah m wlar'Ai committing depredations upon the Persian Coast at Bandar 'Abbas and mi asi Lingeh; and in 1774 it was actually reported, but with what truth can- ttle mi. now be determined, that he had decoyed Zaki Khan from Bandar on M 'Abbas to Hormuz on the pretence of giving him a daughter in marriage, he Lingi! ^ ^ detained him there, with 40 others, as security for the release of icy at I a gon whom Karim Khan, according to his usual practice, had detained shraniiij at Shiraz as a hostage for'Abdullah's fidelity. By 1778, however, the lompaf attilude of the Shaikh had changed ; for in that year we find him first Hormffi acting in opposition to the Imam of Masqat, and then kidnapped, as erpte' related in another place, by the agents of that ruler. At the same time f the is a feud had arisen between the Shaikh's subjects and the people of ae Valfll,' Bushehr, and two or three vessels had been captured by the Hormuzis, n.

It is said that, by about 1765, and theShaikh 'Abdullah had been able to expel, from the part of the Persian 3r nofc Coast under his supervision, the Qawasim who had established themselves I ^ ere during the troubles of the preceding years, and that during the rest etiirn^ 1 life he was able to keep them at a distance, lace hai ^ mahji g gon; The East India Company's trade in Persia! 1763-1779. id caj tants. The import trade of Persia in 1765, so far as carried on by the Imports, n of ^ ^'tish in the Persian Gulf, was described by Niebuh as consisting re cog#- 125SS8I 1826 cHiefly in European manufactured cloths and in goods from Surat and Bengal. J Weollpns, The principal article imported by the East India Company into Persia continued to be, as in the period preceding 1763, woollen cloth of 1763. various kinds. In 1763 at the establishment of the Bushehr Eesidency, Mr. Price caused a stock of 384 bales of broadcloth, 184 bales of perpets, and 4 chests of tabbies and sattins ^ to be landed, these being the sortments proper for the Persia market,'' 3 and gave the newly appointed Resident authority to dispose of them, in the first instance, at prices lower than had been customary at Bandar ^ Abb as, in order that up- country merchants mighjb be attracted and the Dutch on Kharag dis couraged from competition in the trade. Mr. Jervis was also to procure lists of all the kinds of woollens suitable for sale in the different parts of Persia, and he was to draw up estimates of the probable annual demand for each. Afterwards, strict orders having been given -to the Resident at Bushehr ' not to sell perpets separate from cloth, as the profits on th| cloth are faf^superior to those on the perpets/' difficulty was from timj 1764. ta time experienced in making sales ; and in March 1764 Mr. Jervis reported ' that not having received any scarlet or aurora perpets by tn| ' Drake and the coarse cloth by the Nancy being all of one colour had 'proved very prejudicial to his sales, the purchasers in January ^ aV1I1 $ declined taking coarse cloth and perpets to an equal amount of w ^ a ,L Uh ves nolens U s of tlie h rolieinei siiitliecoiiiii iiit M bee fk importe its, coarse mfi ■ssiUletrs N' Dra] 'they then bought for want of those other sortments, and he had heenp I obliged to abate two rupees per piece on the blue and green perpets ^ a by the^ Corasooners, which made it absolutely necessary there should bej- wasj a %\^ , proportion of ^0 or 25 bales scarlet or aurora perpets to 100 of the other colours, without which the popinjays would never sell, being a colour 'much disliked by the Persians in general.'' Later in the same year ^ was obliged to refuse an offer from some Khurasani merchants^ then visiting Bushehr, 'to take all the green and blue perpets at 20 rupees per piece, provided he would sell them separately,^ and the merchants on learning that he had no scarlet perpets in stock announced their intej tion of waiting till some wer^ received ; meanwhile, however, the BaleSi 1766. at the Residency were very trifling. On the 5th of April 1766 the cas balance at Bushehr was R37,021, recent sales, 'for want of proper sortnifc ments of coarse cloth and perpets,^ having been small ; but in the mean k j while, at the beginning of March, 151 bales of cloth and 200 of ^ 0I1 ^ ells for the Persian market had been despatched in the ' Tartar ' ^ r0Iia 1776. Bombay. In February 1775, notwithstanding the dangers i^P®^|||j ' 'ji * Corasooners = Khiirasgnis ? | k\704^ 1827 over Basrah from the side of Persia and the detention by the Agent and Council there for their own protection of the Eagle ' and ' Success, ' the Bombay Governmeot sent 300 bales of woollens to that place by the ^Drake' and 230 more, including 30 bales of drabs, by a specially freighted native vessel. In the early summer of 1776, after a fresh 1776. stock of woollens had been laid in at Bushehr, an effort was made under the orders of the Presidency to enhance the selling prices; but the season was unfavourable for the attempt, as from June to August inclu sive many of the merchants were accustomed to retire from Bushehr to Shiraz to escape the heat at the coast, and there was no retail sale of woollens in the country before September ; and a combination to resist enhancement had been formed among the merchants and was supported bjthe Shaikh of Bushehr, who was himself the principal buy^r of the cloth goods imported by the Company. In the end the Resident de cided to sell off the goods for the most they would fetch, before the end of the followino: season. In 1778 there was a strong demand at Bushehr 1778. for perpets, coarse medleys and coarse cloth. A considerable trade in tin seems to have been carried on at Bushehr Tin. and Basrah about 1764, and a consignment from Bombay at the end of that year was equally divided between the two places. Earlier in the year the Resident at Bushehr, who had taken 14,107 caps of tin out of the passing vessel i( Drake ' and sold them to local merchants for rupees per Tabriz Man, estimated the annual Bushehr demand to be 10,000 Tabriz Mans at about this price, and the action of the Residency in sending more was probably due to his advice ; but they blamed him for having sold the tin caps apart from the tin in slabs, for which there was not so much demand. Sugar was also an article of the trade with Persia at this time, and Sugar, we find that in 1773 a leading merchant of Bushehr purchased 124 canis ters at H,s. 8 per Tabriz Man from Commodore Nesbitt of the cc Revenge.'' The exports of Persia through Bushebr, as enumerated by Niebuhr Exports, who visited the place in 1765 were silk fabrics from Yazd and Kashan, r ed Gilan silk, carpets (of which the most valuable were from Isfahan), line wool or goats* hair from Kirman, horses and mules, rhubarb and other drugs, cotton, fruits, rose-water, and a great quantity of Shiraz wme. The East India Company, however, did not deal in all these Nicies, but left the trade in some of them to their Resident at Bushehr ^ his capacity of private merchant. That Kirman wool, notwithstanding the distance of the producing jj aw woo ^ districts from Bushehr ? still entered into the export trade of Persia is 125 x1828 Raw silk. confirmed by the following observations of the Bombay Government, which were made in September 1767 with reference to a letter fromtlie Company's servants at Bushehr : ' (They) advised us that they had con- ' signed to us by the Success 66 bales of Carmenia wool on account and a risque of Mahmud Hussari, that it was of a fine sort but had been a touched by the worms, for which reason they had not fixed any price i( for it, which the Linguist desired might be referred to us, and who ' would abide by any price we might think it worth. They likewise sent ' us two bales of new wool on the Hon^ble Company^s risque, and had a contracted for 3,000 bales more at 6 rupees the maund, all charges in- 'eluded; but they were afraid that the impediments laid on their trade ' would discourage the contractors and occasion a disappointment in this ' article, of which, altho. we were the only purchasers in Persia, they a could not perceive it under the above price, owing to the sheep being ' almost totally destroyed by the length of the troubles that [they] had ' ravaged the province of Carmenia.'' A little later, in giving orders for Mr, Skipp^s second mission to Shiraz, the Presidency directed that the price of Kirman wool should be fixed in the treaty which might be arranged with Karim Khan. A similar direction was given in regard to raw silk, chiefly of Gilan origin, the trade in which was now evidently considered important by the Court of Directors in London, though considerations of the risk and difficulty in obtaining it sometimes led them to modify or cancel orders already given. In March 1768 they 'laid aside any thought of it for the present,but a year later they again urged that it should he procured, k large quantity was expected to be collected at Basrah at the beginning of 1771; and again, at the end of 1771, orders were sent from London to discontinue purchasing raw silk. ^ 0 PP er There are also indications that copper was still exported from Persia by the East India Company, barter. an( ^ r ^ ie medium of exchange seems tu have given rise, during this period, to questions of some difficulty. Karim Khan had, apparently, theories of his own on the subject; and these eventually led him to prohibit the exportation of specie from Persia altogether, under pain of confiscation not cmly of money which it had been attempted to smuggle out of the country, but also of the whole of the delinquents other estate ; and in 1770 a caravan proceeding from Shiraz to Bushehr, in which were 500 Tumans in cash, was stopped by his orders, the money seized, and the owner thrown into prison. There Avas at this time a great scarcity of specie in both Persia and Turkish 'Iraq, but the measures adopted by(KHt) 1829 Karim Khau seem to kave had some effect in modifying the adverse balance of trade in the case o£ the former country. Occasionally, when tbe Company had large unsold stocks to dispose of, they were willing to ermit sale by barter; witness the following instructions of the Court of Directors issued to the Agent and Council at Basrah in 1771: (( Having taken into consideration what you write on the subject of 'the Gilan raw silk and the large quantity of the stock of woollens »which have remained so long in warehouse at your settlement and at 'Bombay for your market, we are willing, and accordingly authorise 'you, to dispose of those woollens in barter for silk entirely, without the 'advance of cash for purpose thereof unless you shall find it utterly 'impossible to procure the silk on those terms ; and then we hope you 'will be able to procure it, allowing the merchants a quarter part in 'cash in payment for such raw silk ^ : but as a rule they regarded restrictions on dealings in specie as oppressive, and they were highly indignant at the manner in which, to the detriment of foreign trade, those restrictions were enforced at Bushehr. In 1776 the merchants of BusheKr made an offer, which was not accepted, to buy all the perpets in the British Factory for ready money, ' giving silk for the whole remains of cloth'; but in 1778 'forty-two (42) rolls of Gilan 'raw silk arrived from Schiras and were deposited in the Factory by ' 'Coja Ezar, in consequence of which he has received our remains of 'woollens, and Rs. 9,666-1-9 are now due on that deposit/'' It is interesting to notice that in 1761, a doubt having arisen as to the correct English equivalent of the Tabriz Man, the Resident at Bushehr, Mr. Jervis, reported after experiment that it was 7'38 lbs. avoirdupois, but that the Bombay Government held from their own knowledge that it did not really exceed 6| Ibs., - ^ and directed in con sequence that he should either do business in English weights or treat the Tabriz Man as equal to not more than 7 lbs. Under the rule of Karim Khan commerce flourished ; and it is stated that, in his day, the receipts from customs at Shiraz, Which were taken at the rate of 2 per cent, ad valorem' only&gt; sometimes amounted to 6,000 Tumans a month. At the institution of the Bushehr Residency in 1763 it was arranged, apparently not without the knowledge of the Persian authorities, that a duty of 3 per cent, should be levied by the Resident on behalf of the Company upon all goods imported or exported by those trading under * The Tabriz Man at the present day is 6-547 lbs. English, and it may be inferred that Mr. Jervis was misled by the loc^l merchants, who perhaps showed him a Bushehr Man (now Tf lbs. English); The Tabriz Man. Trade generally. Customs and consulage.the Company^s protection; and that, in addition thereto, consulage at the rate of 1 per cent, on all British trade should be collected and divided equally between the Eesident at Bushehr and the Agent at Basrah. On the 3rd of April it was further resolved in Council at Bombay, in order to put the customs and consulage at Bushire upon ' the same footing as at the Agency, that one per cent, consulage be in a future collected there for the President^ apparently in addition to the one per cent, already taken for the Agent and the Resident. Establishments of the East India Company in Persia, 1763- 1779. The recognised establishments of the East India Company in Persia were confined, during this period, to one Residency at Bushehr. Powers and The Resident at Bushehr was from the first under the orders of tlie r ' s^dpnt at 6 Agent and Council at Basrah, through whom the whole of the corre- bfishebr. spondence, in either direction, between him and Bombay was ordinarily to pass; but he was also authorised, and even ordered, to avail himself of the opportunities afforded by vessels bound direct to Bombay of speedier communication with the Presidency ; and he was permitted, when none of the Company^s cruisers were available, to send consignments of goods not exceeding R50,000 in value by native vessel to Surator Bombay. In 1764', on Mr. Wrench's appointment to the Basrah Agency, the Hesident at Biishehr was specially instructed to ^ive him 'the ' necessary information in respect to all concerns under his management ' and to obey him as Agent in future, agreeable to the established rules f&lt; inthe service' Mr. Jervis, the first Resident at Bushehr, entertained the distinguished traveller Niebuhr there in 1765, passing him on, when he left for Persepolis, to a young English merchant whom he employed at Shiraz ; and Niebuhr gives us an interesting glimpse of the life of his host at either place. Mr. Jervis. Mr. Jervis, who had received a good education in his youth, still devoted to study all the time that he could spare from business; he spoke, read, and wrote* Persian; and he had began to form a collection * From the following extract of a letter written b}- the Agent and Council at Basrah to the Presidency at Bombay in 1770 it appears that a knowledge of the language was not universal among the Company's servants employed in the Gulf: ' We submic also to Your Honour, etc., the propriety of sending Mr. Dow in ordef 41 to accompany Mr. Morley, as so much useful information may be procured from ' his knowledge in the Persian language, and so much greater confidence can be placed ' in his interpretation than in that of any of the country people.'1831 of Persian manuscripts, am org which was one of Mnhammad Mehdi Khan's Life of Nadir Shah, afterwards translated from a different copy by Sir W. Jones. Mr. Jervis's only regular assistant at Bushebr wa« Mr. Natter, the son of a stone engraver of European reputation, who had apparently the rank of Writer in the Company's service; and except two monks, one of whom called him self ^Bishop of Isfahan, there was then no other European at Bushehr. Mr. Hercules, who was Mr. Jervis's representative at Shiraz, belonged Mr, Hercules, to a good English family but had no official status, being merely Mr. Jervis's agent in private trade. The life of this gentleman at the Persian capital was monotonous and unpleasant in the extreme, for he was the only European settled there; an Armenian officer in Karim Khan's artillery was the sole person with whom he could converse freely ; and he could not, out of regard for his position in the eyes of the nobles and great merchants, appear in the streets otherwise than mounted on horse back and accompanied by a retinue of servants. It seems probable that the anomalous position of Mr. Hercules at Restrictions . • • tt n irc 1 ? 086 ' by Shiraz, where Mr. Jervis no doubt made use of him in public as well Directors as in private business, in the end came to the knowledge of the Court of at Directors in London and excited their disapproval, for the following ®^hehr, 1700. words in their despatch of May 1766, already mentioned, by which they imposed restrictions on the political activity of the Resident and forbade him to appoint an agent at Shiraz, seem to apply very closely to Mr. Hercules' case: a If it,' i.e., the agent, u should be one of our (i servants, it will be unnecessary expense, and much worse if an Armenian &lt;( or any country-born people, who will always act more for their private ' interest than that of the Company. The servants in the factory who ' are not covenant servants of the Company and understand English, t( if any such there are at present, must be suffered to see the Company s ' accounts or any letters or transactions regarding the Company's affairs, ' in which are to be employed but our own servants. If there are not &lt;( sufficient at present, the Presidency, upon your application, will encrease ' the number.'' In the same despatch, it may be observed, more stringent rules were laid down regarding the correspondence of the Resident at Bushehr, who was in future to write to the Agency regularly once a fortnight, and copies of whose direct communications with Bombay were to be sent to the Agent and Council at Basrah ' by the very first conveyance that offers '1832 Assistant to Eesident, Medical Officers, etc. Miltary guard and boat at Busbebr. It does not appear that the Resident at Bushehr had a covenanted ] servant to assist him, unless * Mr. Na-tter were such, until after tlie re-institution of the Residency in 1775 ; but in 1778, Mr. Green m serving there under the orders of Mr. Beaumont, whose captivity at Shiraz he had shared. A Sarraf or money-changer formed part oftlie Bushehr establishment from the beginning, having been appointed originally under an order of Mr. Price, which ran thus : As the money j ' for your sales will be paid in different species, both of gold and silver, j ' a Shroff will be necessary to prevent any imposition. You are accord- a ingly empowered to entertain one, and in order to encourage him to a ' faithful discharge of his duty (? to allow him) a shroftage of | per cent.'' In 1778, when Messrs. Beaumont and Green wrote as follows,tliere i was still no Surgeon at Bushehr, and the want of carpenters was severely felt: ' We desire the favour of Your Honour, etc., to oblige us witli i a a Surgeon for the use of this Factory, and hope that the severity of j ' the hot seasons and sudden change of the air here, which frequently 'subjects us to disorders, will plead in our excuse for this request. 'We also entreat for two carpenters, which we have often occasion for, ' as there is not one to be had in the place. ^ When the British Residency at Bushehr was opened in 176V small guard of about a dozen men was landed, under a European officer, to give the Factory consequence ; and it was no doubt maintained there, though the officer (Lieutenant Thomas Durnford) was withdrawn after about a year. Mr. Price, in concluding his report on tlie opening of: the Bushehr Residency remarked : ' I have only tio add i ' thereto that, the rains in this part of the world not being periodical •• and no vessels to be procured for transporting goods but trankies, ' which are not only open but wretchedly bad in any blowing weather, ff a vessel of about 100 tons burthen, with a deck and pique sail, ' the Dutch luggage boats at Surat, appears to me very necessary ; and, 1 a as she may be made capable of defence by mounting 8 or 10 carriage guns upon her, she will be very serviceable in many respects, especially for removing our surplus cash at Bushire to Bussora as occasion require It was not however until 1766, or three years later, that the Agent an^ Council at Basrah sanctioned the purchase by the Resident at Bushehr of» boat for carrying packets to Basrah and occasionally to Masqat, wherety they hoped, the Company would save considerably in the item o f freight. * Mr Natter has been described as a Writer above, but it is not clear that be **** covenanted servant. \(I04&lt;f) 1883 In the treatment of their servants, especially in exceptional the Company often showed a judicious liberality.

BULEES OF THE ZAND DYNASTY AFTER KARIM KHAN, 1779—95. The period following the death of Karim Khan was one of confusion and unrest, during which the power of the Qajars of Mazandaran steadily increased at the expense of that of the Zands of Shiraz ; and by 1795 the supremacy in Persia had been completely transferred from the southern to the northern tribe. We may deal with the events of the time under two aspects s first in their relation to Persia as a whole, and again in their bearing on the Persian Coast districts with which we are more immediately concerned. lii order to explain the relationship among themselves of the Zand i3rinces, to whose dissensions more than to any other cause the ultimate triumph of the Qajars must be attributed, we subjoin a table which contains their genealogy in outline. One of them, Ja^far Khan, it will be seen, appears in two places in the table. * This allowance was still being paid in 1788, at the rate of Rs. 30 a month. P DI. PRINCES op the ZAND FAMILY.

The new ruler's first step was to destroy a J » n6 number of influential Zands and others who had presumed to declare for Abul Fat-h Khan, a son of Kaiim Khan, after which he pretended to govern on behalf of Abul Fat-h Khan and a brother named Muhammad 'Ali Khan, the latter being his own son-in-law. He was supported in his coup d'Hat by 'Ali Murad Khan, his sister's son, an able and ambitious man of whom more will be heard hereafter; but other members of the family were adverse to him, especially Sadiq Khan, who himself harboured a claim to the succession. Sadiq Khan, at the time of the Vakil's decease, was Governor of the town of Basrah, then occupied by a Persian garrison; but, immediately on the news of the momentous event reaching him, he evacuated the place and set out for Shiraz by forced marches, taking with him the whole of his troops. Having learned at Doraq on the way that Zaki Khan was already established in power, he sent his son Ja far Khan forward to negotiate on his behalf for a share in the administration ; but, doubt less for want of confidence on either side, nothing was arranged. Sadiq Khan would then have attacked Shiraz; but he was deterred by the action of Zaki Khan in arresting three of his sons, who happened to be in the town, in imprisoning Abul Fat-h Khan, who was suspected of favouring his causej and in threatening to ill-treat the relatives at Shiraz of some of the leaders of his army ; and he bad instead to retire, with a small following and not unpursued, to the remote district of Kirman# But rivalry on the part of his own relations was not the only diffi culty with which Zaki Khan had to contend. The city of Ispahan, during the confusion following the death of Karlm Kha^ had been seized by two Afshar chiefs, brothers, with the support of their own tribe and of the Bakhtiyaris and other Lurs; and some little time elapsed before the place was recovered by the perfidious diplomacy of Bastam Khan, whom Zaki Khan afterwards appointed Governor. More dangerous, however, than any movement in the southern provinces was the growth in the districts near the Caspian Sea of the1836 hostile power of the Qajar tribe ; whom the escape of Agha Muhammad Khan from Shiraz, on the occasion of the death of the Vaki], had at length provided with a leader of first-rate capacity. Agha Muhammad Khan was a eunuch^ and he had been detained for many years as a hostage by Karim Khan; but in endurance, ability, and force of character he was at least the equal of any surviving member of the Zand family; and he signalised the recovery of his freedom by boldly laying claim to the throne of Persia and adopting the insignia of royalty. Zaki Khan, when the revolt at Isfahan had been quelled, despatched 'Ali Murad Khan with the flower of his army against Agha Muhammad Khan; but his kinsman and early supporter, with whom Sadiq Khan had meanwhile opened a correspondence, took advantage of being thus placed in command of troops to throw off his allegiance, occupy Isfahan^ and declare himself an adherent of Abul Fat-h Khan, the deposed son of Karim Khan. Zaki Khan, always prompt in action, and impelled in the present case by extreme indignation, at once placed his own son Akbar in charge of Shiraz and set out for Isfahan at the head of all his available forces; but he was assassinated at Yazdikhast, on the way thither, by some of his own followers. The date of this occurrence appears to have been the 14th of June 1779. His violent character had rendered Zaki Khan unpopular with many; but the immediate cause of his death was a series of atrocities committed by him at Yazdikhast, in connection with the recovery of a sum of money for which he held the inhabitants to be responsible. Beiga of The assassination of Zaki Khan was followed by the elevation Khsl Md h t0 thethr0ne 0f h[s P risoiiei ' and nephew Abul Fat-h Khan, a youth of Sadiq Khan weak and dissipated character, but reputed just, mild, and unambitious. ^September &lt; ^ ne ac ^ s ^ le new ru ^ er was to imprison Akbar Khan, tte 1779. son of Zaki Khan, and Muhammad 'Ali Khan, his own brother, who had married Zaki Khan's daughter. At the beginning of July 1779 Sadiq Khan, who was a man of handsome appearance, who had at one time held the position of Baiglarbaig or Viceroy of Pars under the Vakil, and whom Karim Khan had on his death-bed appointed guardian of his sons, appeared at Shiraz and succeeded in obtaining a share in the administra tion ; but the dual system of government thus established was unsatisfao- tory and lasted for about two months only. Abul Pat-h K ban, it was said, constantly rejected the advice of Sadiq Khan • and a serious disagree ment at length occurred between them on the subject of Akbar Khan. whom Abul Pat-h Khan was desirous of blinding. At last at the begin ning of September 1779, Sadiq Khan lost patience and deposed and con1837 % A|)U | ^t-h Khan 'for his intemperance, with the consent of the princi- M al eople ,; ; an( ^ 0 PP os i^ onto a( l v i ce Mirza Muhammad \ Husain, his Vazir, he caused him to be deprived of sight. mi Sadiq Khan, after he had thus rid himself of his associate, enjoyed ^f n ^ f han ulK |i v icIed power; but he failed, in exercising it, to sustain the reputa- 1779-1781! lilt tion f or soldierly efficiency and general good sense which he had gained jittgi (lurin0 . his government of Basrah; and he quickly found that he had to do with a formidable rival in the person of 'Ali Murad Khan. That ^ prince had, it was said, been disappointed of marrying a daughter of the m Vakil through Sadiq Khan^s bestowal of the lady on one of his ^ own sons; and now, on learning the fate of Abul Fat-h Khan, he pro- H r claimed his independence of the usurper and came forward himself as a ] M competitor for the throne. About January 1780 J Ali Murad Khan took Mi possession of Isfahan, which Ja'far Khan, the son of Sadiq Khan, had ^ evacnated on his approach ; but his family and property at Shiraz fell H into the hands of Sadiq Khan. Both parties then remained inactive for several months. A campaign followed later, in which ^Ali Naqi Khan, son of Sadiq Khan, completely defeated 'Ali Murad Khan and compelled him to retire to Hamadan ; but the victor did not follow up his advantage Mil as he ought to have done; and presently 'Ali Murad Khan was able not iateffi only to recover Isfahan but also to confine Sadiq Khan and his supporters zik to the town of Shiraz, which he proceeded to blockade. In February .W 1781 the town surrendered, after operations extending over more than eight months, in the course of which Akbar Khan had managed to escape J from custody and join the camp of the besiegers, while Ja^far Khan, son ^ ^ of Sadiq Khan and half-brother at the same time of ; Ali Murad Khan^ iMi ^ Overnor a ^ s0 under his father of Behbehan and Shushtar, had in the lij meantime likewise made his submission^ Three days after the fall of ^ the town the citadel also opened its gates, and Sadiq Khan and three of his sons, who were in it, became the prisoners of 'Ali Murad Khan, t oif ^ e ^ eS Khan were immediately put out; and a little later he, ^ and those of his sons who had been captured with him, suffered death ^ by the hand of Akbar Khan, who actually solicited the privilege of dmiiii ^ econ ^ n » their executioner.

On Khan, 1781 i J P r00 ^ his having leen concerned in a conspiracy'—or perhaps from pru- 85.1838 Raignof Ja'far Kban 1785—89 dential motives merely^ as he was a man of conspicuous ability and ambi tion—-'Ali iVFurad Khan decided that Akbar Khan must be removed ; and Ja'far Khan, who had his father's death to avenge, readily undertook and performed the bloody task. 'Ali Murad Khan, after affairs at Shiraz had been set in order, transferred his capital to Isfahan, where he thenceforward resided; at the same time he entrusted Shiraz to a nephew, named Saiyid Murad Khan, and committed the charge of military operations which he thought it necessary to undertake ag-ainst the Qajars to his own eldest son, Shaikh Vais. The Qajar country was successfully invaded, and to some extent occupied; but Shaikh Vais's early victories were followed by a severe reverse, and by his hasty retirement on Tehran. There ; Ali Murad Khan arrived to his assistance, and inflicted summary punishment on some tribal leaders to whose defection, at a critical moment, he attributed his son's defeat. Notwithstanding the state of his health, which was precarious, the Zand ruler at once organised afresh force, and was about to take th' field in person against the Qajars, when news reached him that Ja'far Khan, whom he had continued to trust and whom he had invested with a government, was in rebellion and was marching on Isfahan. It was the depth of winter, and his political and medical advisers would both have dissuaded him. from exposing himself to the hardships of a snowy march ; but the Khan was determined to reach Isfahan before the rebel, and he died by the way, when about 30 miles from his destina tion, a victim to the inflexibility of his own resolve. By the presence of mind of his ministers, his death, which occurred on the 11th of February 1785, was concealed from the army until the royal treasure had reached Isfahan and been deposited there in safety. J Ali Murad Khan was a man of firm character, and he was the last of the Zands who showed himself able to contine the Qajars within their ancestral bounds. A few days after the decease of'Ali Murad Khan, Ja'far Khan arrived at Isfahan. Baqir Khan, the governor of the city, who had foolishly assumed royal state during the interregnum, fled at his approach, but was pursued, captured and imprisoned; and Ja'far Khan also found means to entrap Shaikh Vais, the son of 3 Ali Murad Kban, and render him harmless by loss of sight. There was at first confusion in the interior ; the highroads became unsafe and even impassable; and Mr. Matcham, a servant of the East India Company who had undertaken to travel home from India by way of Isfahan ^i&amp;W to investigate the causes of tKe decline of the Persian trade, was obliged on arrival at Bushehr, in March 1785, to postpone if not to abandon his intended journey. The reign of Ja^far Khan differed from that of his predecessor chiefly in this, that the Qajars had become aggressive, and that the Zand ruler was now reduced to acting chiefly on the defensive, and had some times difficulty in maintaining his authority even in the south. Soon after the accession of Ja'far Khan, Agha Muhammad Khan marched against Isfahan, and the new sovereign withdrew in such disorder from the town that his baggage was partially plundered by a mob ; he found a safe retreat however at Shiraz, where, under the influence of Haji Ibrahim, a somewhat remarkable man whom Ja'far Khan afterwards appointed to the Kalantarship of Fars, Saiyid Murad Khan had remained faithful to his interests. Agha Muhammad Khan not long afterwards came into collision with the Bakhtiyari tribe and, having been discomfited by them in battle, retired to his own country, where upon Ispahan was temporarily recovered for Ja^far Khan by a force under Saiyid Murad Khan. Before the end of 1785 a difference occurred between Ja^far Khan and 1785. Haji 'Ali Quli Khan of Kazaran^ one of his supporters, which in the end had a sinister effect upon the royal fortunes. It originated in the refusal of Ja^far Khan to ratify terms granted by 'Ali Quli Khan to a number of Khurasani soldiers who had surrendered to him while they were in arms against his master ; and it led to an attack by royal troops upon the Kazaran chief, followed in the first instance by his flight, later by bis voluntary submission, and finally by his treacherous imprisonment at Shiraz. Riza Quli Khan, the brother of ^Ali Quli Khan, fled to Bushehr and thence to Basrah ; and Ja'far Khan appointed a kinsman of his own to the government of Kazaran. The difficulties of Ja^far Khan were added to, about this time, by the 17B^. revolt of Ismail Khan, a cousin to whom he had entrusted the adminis tration of a district; and in March 1786 the rebel even defeated him in a serious encounter. In the following autumn Ja 5 far Khan thought it necessary to proceed against Biishehr, of which place the hereditary ruler, Shaikh Nasir, now more than 80 years of age, had been guilty of an unfriendly act in harbouring the fugitive Riza Quli Khan and had also neglected to pay the tribute due by himself to the central govern ment ; but on the Khan's advancing to Kazaran, which he reached on the 22nd September, the Shaikh tendered his submission and purchased1840 peace by the payment, it was said, of a considerable sum. On the same visit arrears o£ revenue were collected also from other petty rulers in tlie neighbourhood of the coast, and Ja^far Khan apparently did not leave Kazaran until the 17th of December 1786, nor return to Shiraz until the beginning of March 1787. 1787. In the following year suspicions of the loyalty of Saiyid Murad Khan, which Ja^far Khan had entertained ever since the beginning of his reign, seemed to come to a head ; and in April 1787 the unhappy nobleman was arrested along with his family, beaten, stripped of his possessions, and sent to join 'Ali Quli Khan in confinement. 1788. In 1788 Ja'far Khan's eldest son Lutf 'Ali Khan, a youth about 18 years of age, who had lately been appointed Baiglarbaig or Viceroy of Fars, was able to repair to some extent the prestige of his father's government,—then shaken by a late unfortunate engagement between Ja^far Khan and some rebellious subjects in the neighbourhood of Yazd,—by the reduction of Lar, the capital of which he took by storm, afterwards sending the chief of the district a prisoner to Shiraz. The Khan himself also obtained a success over the Qajars in a battle fought near Qumisheh, with the result that Isfahan, which had been lost, fell once more into his possession; but, on Agha Muhammad Khan advancing against him, he again evacuated that city on the pretext that distmv bances in the region adjoining the Persian Gulf demanded his immediate presence. 1789. Lutf 'Ali Khan was already on the way from Shiraz to the scene of these troubles, when, in January 1789, the life and reign of Ja^far Khan were suddenly terminated by violence. The principal actors in his assassination were the political prisoners 'Ali Quli Khan and Saiyid Murad Khan, who, after poison had been administered to him by an accomplice in the royal household, found means to draw near and despatch him with their swords. His head, separated from his body, lay for a time exposed to the insults of the populace on a piece of open ground before the citadel. Ja'far Khan was in 1787 a middle-aged, corpulent man. His charac ter was unreliable and even treacherous, but not harsh or severe; and with those of his subjects who knew him best he was by no means un popular. His principal adviser or Vazir was the worthy Mirza Muhammad Husain, who had acted in the same capacity under his father Sadiq Khan, and who afterwards figured among the most loyal adherents of his son Lutf 'Ali Khan. The general position in Persia at Ja'far Khan's death may be summed up by saying that the districts1841 (k . r ri] j ghiraz, Belibehan and Shushtar were still subject to the jurisdiction lid 0 j! the Zaiids, while Yazd ; itirmah, Bushehr and Lar continued to pay )J ^ ein tribute; but the northern and north-western districts, as also ! Isfahan, had passed under the control o£ the Qajars. kiyil The revolution at Shiraz placed Saiyid Murad Khan at the head of J of affairs. Lutl 'Ali Khan, on news of the transactions at the capital Murad tlie reaching' his camp, was at first deserted by all his followers except Kban 178 ^ ^ ve . being a military ruler of ability and even of experience, and having been well received by the aged Shaikh of Bushehr, he was able in three months to collect a new for v ce. nta jIi or d On the ^nd April 1789 he marched from Bushehr, accompanied by the eldest son of Shaikh Nasir of Bushehr, who a few days later niy succeeded to the Shaikhdom in consequence of his father's death. A force gent from Shiraz to oppose his advance mutinied at Daliki and handed MBji over their commander, a brother of Saiyid Murad Khan, to Lutf 'Ali gll Khan, who immediately put him to death. The rest of the young jj^u prince's march to Shiraz was a triumphal progress ; and, on arrival there, he was fortunate enough to secure the persons of his most dangerous enemies, in particular that of Saiyid Murad Khan, whom y. he caused to be executed. Others of his opponents met with unex- hisif pscted clemency, and among these was, in the first instance, an obscure [ person named Mehdi'Ali, who was accused of having cut the ears ^ ||j| from the lifeless head of Ja^far Khan; but, at a later period, Lutf ,^[1 ^Ali Khan was persuaded to reconsider his treatment of this individual a[ |, and sentenced him to death by burning, — an act which alienated uiii c ^ ever arL ^ influential Haji Ibrahim, one of the intercessors on toll ^ e hdi 'Ali, and so contributed, as we shall see^ to the aw 0- ^ own ^ ^he Zand dynasty. ^iisl The events described in this paragraph occurred, for the most part, pi^iff ^lag the year 1789. Lutf 'Ali Khan was the last of his family to occupy a throne, Keign of jp but in military prowess he was the most remarkable, as in personal ^ character he was perhaps the most attractive, of the Zand monarchs. 1789—95. a0 0 ^ misfortunes have won for him the sympathy of every historian of ■ortlij! ^ period. tjfli ■^ 0 sooner was LutE ''Ali Khan established in the government 1783. j most' 1 ^ an Qajar rival, Agha Muhammad Khan, appeared in the neigh- 011 iii I ^ Olir bood of Shiraz. A spirited attack was immediately made upon tle^ 1261842 the invader, but it was not 'successful^ and a siege of Shiraz by the Qajars followed, which, though it was maintained for three months, likewise failed. In the following year 1790, Lutf 'Ali Khan, after appointing a younger brother to be his nominal representative at Shiraz and en trusting the civil government of the country to Haji Ibrahim and the command of the garrison at the capital to one Barkhudar Khan, himself set out, with an army originally collected for service against the Qajars, to compel the governor of Kirman to submit to his autho rity. His utmost efforts, however, were unequal to the task of captur ing the town; an unusually rigorous winter made havoc of his force, both men and animals ; and eventually he returned home baffled, bring* ing with him the shattered remains of the expedition. The next year a crisis occurred at Shiraz^ after which, though his fortitude and other mauly qualities did not fail him but rather shone out with a brigher lustre than before, Lutf 'Ali Khan must be regarded as a king in name rather than in fact. During his absence at Kirman there had been friction between Haji Ibrahim on the one side and the brother of Lutf 'Ali Khan and Bar khudar Khan on the other, all of whom represented him in different capacities; but the prince, disregarding the advice of his Vazir, Mirza Muhammad Husain, who distrusted Haji Ibrahim, renewed their appointments when, in the summer of 1791, he took the field against the Qajar leader Baba Khan, afterwards Fat-h ''Ali Shah. The result was that a few days after Lutf 'Ali Khan's departure, in pursuance of^ a P lot in ^iza Quli Khan of Kazaran, Shaikh Nasir of Bushehr and others were said to have joined for the purpose of setting up a federation of independent principalities, Haji Ibrahim contrived to make a prisoner of Barkhudar Khan and establish a government of his own in the town; but his brother, 'Abdur Rahim Khan, failed m the task which had been assigned him of making Lutf ; Ali Khan a prisoner in his own camp. The very attempt, however, caused Lutf 'Ali Khan's army to disperse; and he hurried back to Shiraz, which he expected to find in friendly hands. Instead, the gates were closed against him; but, on being rejoined by some of Hs most loyal adherents, he proceeded, nothing daunted, to lay siege to his own capital. The families of his officers, however, being within the walls, were in the power of Haji Ibrahim ; and the latter, by threaten ing to take extreme measures with them, was able a second time to empty Lutf'Ali Khan's camp.((0* 1843 The prince^ accompanied only by about a dozen grooms and other servants^ then made for Bushehr^ where he hoped to receive help from Shaikh Nasir; but in the plain of Kazaran his mortal foe, Riza Quli Khan was waiting for him and barred the way. Lutf ''Ali Khan escaped with difficulty from the plain into the south-eastern hills, abandoning a number of valuable horses, but saving his own favourite charger (&lt; I[eraun ;j , and so descended by an unusual and toilsome route into Dashtistan. Here he was promptly succoured by Zal Khan of Khisht, a faithful adherent whom he had dismissed to his home from before the walls of Shiraz. * Mir Mihr ' Ali, the chief of Rig, another devoted follower and one who^ had not failed to warn Lutf ''Ali Khan of the existence of the plot against him before it took effect, quickly joined him; while a the old t cow' Shaikh Nasir, who now belonged—as we have seen — to the opposite side, who had recently visited Shiraz, and who at this point came out of Bushehr to take him prisoner, was fain to beat a hasty retreat lest he should be captured himself. On the 2nd Nov ember Lutf ; Ali Khan and his supporters broke up a hostile force of Dashtistanis which had collected to attack them, and the Chief of Rig in particular performed prodigies of skill and valour in ' spitting, on his spear, those pigs of fellows,'; but on the same day a retirement was made to Khisht and preparations were begun for an attempt on Shiraz. Riza Quli Khan, in the meanwhile^ had occupied and made dispositions for holding the Tang-i-Turkan, a pass through which the royalists would probably endeavour to force their passage in returning northwards. On the evening of the 4th November Mr. Harford Jones ^ of the Basrah Agency, who had had commercial relations with Lutf ; Ali Khan not long before at Shiraz and was now returning to Basrah, had an inter view with the prince in his simple tent at Khisht, and received from his * Called in correspondence ' Meer Ally'' and by Brydges ' Mihr Aly' j probably he had both the title 'Mir'' and the name 'Mihr t 'Old cow ' was the epithet which Lutf 'A.li Khan himself applied to Shaikh Nasir, but he also quoted with approval a saying by another, that too much must not 0 ex P ec ^ e( l of Shaikh Nasir, he being ' one of those animals whom God Almighty aS ^^hed with very long ears and very little brains t The events of this year in Persia are very fully described by Mr. Harford Jones, Awards Sir H. J. Brydges, who was an eye-witness of them in so far as they a^urred at the capital, in the introduction to his Dynasty of the Kajars. Mr. Jones ^ at Shiraz, where he was the guest of Mirza Muhammad Husain, the chief visei of Lutf Ali Khan, early in 1791; the object of his journey was to arrange 12618M lips a graphic account of his late adventures, In response to a request for his opinion Mr. Jones suggested that Lutf ''Ali Khan should seize Bushehr, establish himself there, and open communication witli the Government of India ; and he promised personally to accompany and assist any agent whom the prince might depute to India, to realise money by the sale of jewels and to obtain ammunition and military stores with the proceeds. The same evening Mr. Jones left for Rig; and, though for some months afterwards he maintained a correspondence with Lutf ^Ali Khan, he never again saw him. A few days after this interview Lutf ^Ali Khan, who was always in favour of immediate action and apparently rejected the scheme proposed by Mr. J ones as involving too much delay, marched for Shiraz with sucli a force as his local supporters^had in a few days been able to raise; and on his way he inflicted one, if not two, crushing defeats upon Kiza Quli Khan of Kazaran, whom he captured and deprived of sight, recovering at the same time the horses that he had lost in his flight. Meanwhile Kaji Ibrahim, conscious of the insecurity of his position at Shiraz, had opened communication with Agha Muhammad Khan, the Qajar chief, who at once appointed him Governor on his behalf of Fars, the Kuhgalu country, Laristan and the coast of the Persian Gulf, and ordered Mustafa Khan, one of the Qajar leaders, to comply with all his requisitions. Lutf Ali Khan, as he approached Shiraz, repelled with loss to the enemy a night attack upon his camp, and, after capturing a convoy of grain intended for the city, frustrated a determined effort by Mustafa Khan to iccover it. He then settled down to a blockade of the town and for the purchase of two valuable diamonds which Lutf 'Ali Khan, it was believed, wished to sell ; but, though negotiations continued into the summer, the business wa«i not carried through. The values of the two principal gems, the Darya-i-Nur'' and the ' Taj-i-Mah', were estimated by Mr. Jones at about £300,000 and £100 ,000 respectively ; and twelve other diamonds which were set along with them appeared to him to be^worth about £500,000 in the aggregate. After the revolution Mr. Jones had some difficulty in obtaining permission to leave Shiraz, as it was feared by R'W Ibrahim that he might assist Lutf 'Ali Khan, who was still at large, to raise funds for continuing the struggle by the ^ale of jewels. At his departure Mr. Jones undertook to remove with him, for sale in India, a valuable library belonging to bil host Mirza Muhammad Husain; but the owner, fortunately for himself, changed his n.md, and was able afterwards [to escape loss of life or of sight by delivering up the books when they were demanded of him by Agha Muhammad Khan. Mr. Jones eventually left Shiraz for Rig on the 1st November 179^; and on bis way to the coast he waited fat KMsht upon Lutf 'Ali Khan, for whom be entertained respect and even personal friendship ; jthis waa the occasion of the interview mentioned in the1846 opened a secret correspondence with friends^ or supposed £riends ; within the walls; but the blockade was not strict enough to be quickly effec tual; and the correspondence failed of its object through being detected and read. The position of Haji Ibrahim^ however, was so obviously critical,— especially after a defeat sustained by his troops in an attack made jointly with a Qajar detachment upon those of Lutf ''Ali Khan,—that he was at last able to induce Agha Muhammed Khan, who had hitherto con tented himself with sending re-inforcements, to move in person to his assistance, Lutf ^Ali Khan at once proceeded beyond Persepolis to encounter the approaching Qajars ; and he so arranged matters as to fall by night upon their advanced guard^ which he drove back pell-mell upon the main body. In the darkness he then overran, with an absurdly small forces the camp of the huge Qajar army; but he was unfortu nately persuaded by one of his adherents, whose motives may possibly have been treacherous, to do nothing more until the morning; and when day dawned, it was seen that Agha Muhammad Khan with great firmness of mind, had refrained even from quitting his tent. Between the disproportionate forces now intermingled on the same ground, and both commanded by able leaders, there could by daylight be no question of a contest; and Lutf ^Ali Khan was obliged to seek safety in flight. After this decisive affair, which is variously described from the names of two adjacent villages as the battle of Mayin or Giraj, and which apparently took place in 179^ at some time before the end of May, the conqueror marched to Shiraz, where he celebrated his success by a number of extreme measures, among these being the desecration of the tomb of Karim Khan and the deportation to Mazandaran of all the remaining members of the Zand tribe. Misfortunes, as we shall see further on, also befell the supporters of the Zand cause in the coast districts. Lutf ^Ali Khan was from this time onwards a homeless wanderer ; 1792—94, but he was constitutionally incapable of despair ; and during the next two years he continued to prosecute, with the assistance of an uncle (Abdullah Khan) and other faithful friends, a desultory but untiring opposition to the Qajar chief. He first found an asylum at Tabas and there organised an invasion of Fars; but a defeat by superior numbers at Runiz obliged him to withdraw again to the eastward ; and^ as he found himself no longer a welcome guest at Tabas, he withdrew from that place to Bam. From Bam, having been joined by Afghan and other partisans, he advanced against the town of Kirman, captured it by storm after con-1846 siderable resistance^ and assumed once more the prerogatives and state of an independent ruler; but this was the last gleam of his prosperity. In 1794 Agha Muhammad Khan himself appeared before Kirman; and, after an investment extending to months, his troops were ad- mitted into some of the defences by the treachery of a part of the garrison. Lutf ; Ali Khan held out for a time in one of the gateways of the town, after which, breaking through the masses of the enemy by a desperate effort, he regained Bam in safety. A few days after his arrival, however, not without a desperate struggle in which he defended himself single-handed against a whole body of the enemy, nor until he had been disabled by wounds, Lutf ^Ali Khan was made a prisoner by the acting Governor of Bam, whose intention it was to sacrifice him to the safety of a brother captured by Agha Muhammad Khan at the fall of Kirman; and a little later, having been handed over to the Qajars, he was blinded, subjected to nameless indignities, and finally put to death. So ended, in 1795, the rule of the Zands in Persia. Khusrau Khan, the infant son of Lutf''Ali Khan, was emasculated by order of Agha Muhammad Khan, himself a eunuch; and the conqueror's treatment of the citizens of Kirman recalled the worst excesses of Nadir Shah. Lutf 'Ali Khan is one of the most striking figures in Persian history^ and his military skill and the extraordinary courage with which he con tended against fate command admiration; but it may be doubted whether his reputation would have been served so well by success as it was by adversity, for in his conduct few traces are discoverable of foresight or moderation, — in a word, of statesmanship. Jt should be remembered; however, that his career ended at the early age of 25. History of the Persian Coast districts, 1779—95, Occupation The assassination of Zaki Khan at the middle of June 1779 was the by Bsqir 31 ' i ndirect cause of a series of remarkable occurrences at Busheln- and in Khanj Chief neighbourhood.

Shaikh Nasir, the hereditary governor of Bushehr, was at this time absent on some long1847 ev • but Lis return by sea from the direction of Masqat was expec ted within a few days, and two vessels had actually been got ready to meet his ship and convoy it up the Gulf. Qn the evening of the 29thL June, Hamad, the blind commander of 29th June. Baqir Khan^s troops in Tangistan, set out from home at the head of two or three hundred men in the direction of Rig ; but.his real objective, under orders received from his master, was Bushehr. On the same night, or very early the next morning, finding the wall 29th—30th across the isthmus left, by unusual negligence, nnwatched and even un- #JUne, guarded, he entered Bushehr, A conflagration was immediately kindled, by which before daylight a thousand huts had been reduced to ashes; and ; partly through the alarm and confusion caused by this fire and partly through the supineness of the ruling family, the Tangistanis obtained complete possession of Bushehr, with a loss of not more than fifteen men killed upon either side. Shaikh 'Ali and most of Shaikh Ifasir's near relations busied themselves in saving their families and property, with which they embarked on vessels in the harbour, taking away some 300 men who might otherwise have been employed in defend ing the town; and Shaikh Sa^dun, the brother of Shaikh Nasir, ' kept 'close in his house, not daring to stir out though supported by near 200 men armed with musquets, when 50 brave fellows led on by a man of 'courage might have recovered the place. ' The weakness of the enemy was not discovered until it was too late, and then it was ' impossible to describe the consternation of everybody on finding their conquerors so few.' Contrary to the general expectation, no outrages against person or SOtli Junes, property were committed by the Tangistani force; but at midday on the 30th of June Shaikh SaMun left his house, under intimidation, and placed himself in the power of Hamad, with whom he agreed that a truce should be observed by both sides until Baqir Khan arrived. ' This shameful treaty was no sooner concluded and Shaik Sadoon's ' person secured than a party of Arabs appeared to the assistance of 'Bushire, who killed 4 or 5 Tankseer * people they met with at the ff watering place giving their horses water, which making free with, and ' learning that the town was eventually lost, they departed, not however ' without execrating Shaik Sadoon for his pusillanimity.

His later policy, equally, was a mixture of conciliation and force : on the one hand he persuaded the Muhammadan, the Armenian, and even the Hindu mercantile communities to petition separately for his recognition by Akl Fat-h Khan, the titular sovereign of Persia; and, on the other, he proceeded to improve the defences of the town against external attack, and to guard against insurrection within the walls by depriving the citizens of their weapons. The conduct of Baqir Khan in seizings Bushehr, it may he remarked, was the more reprehensible in that he had, before the death of Karim Khan, undertaken to provide for the safety of the place during the absence of Shaikh Nasir. On the 2nd of July the two Gallivats which had been prepared left for the southward in search of Shaikh Nasir j and on the next day a numher of poor families were expelled from the town to make room for a numher of Tangistani immigrants, some of the better class among whom were armed. Ou the 5th of the month an officer of the Mir of Rig, who had come to request that the family of a deceased relation of the Shaikh of Bushehr should be handed over to his master, left for Rig after success* fully discharging his commission; but before his departure he visited Mr. Beaumont, the British Resident, and assured him that the Mir, so far from having instigated the seizure of Bushehr by Baqir Khan, his late guest, highly disapproved of the usurpation and would probably arrive before long with his own people and those of Ganaveh to help in bringing to an end. By this officer Mr. Beaumont despatched a letter to the British Factory at Basrah, in which he informed them of the crisis at Bushehr and of his own disagreeable situation. During the next three days nothing of importance happened. On the 9th of July Baqir Khan received, with reference to his overtures, an unfavourable reply from Abul Fat-h Khan, by whose Farman he was directed to restore to the inhabitants of Bushehr everything that he had taken from them, to deliver up the town to Shaikh SaMun, and to repair at once in person to Shlraz to answer for his late conduct. As prepara tions were already being made by neighbouring chiefs for an attack on him by sea and land, as it now seemed not unlikely that their efforts mi ftt e /u e T nded ^ the Government of Shiraz, and as, moreover, it was probabe that he would be deserted by his own followers, whose family 111 JanglSten tod begU11 to suffer by the attacks of Arab symj ffcialv si iJi1849 aanlifi [ ^iththe Shaikh of Bushehr, Baqir Khan, at this point, decided to evacuate his conquest. As a preliminary to doing so, he seized upon some boats and despatched in them; to a place upon the coast of his own district, the plunder of the Shaikhs of Bushehr, of which the value was estimated at 3 to 4 lakhs of rupees ; from the other principal residents, it is said, he had taken nothing. At length, at sunrise on the 11th of July, to the inexpressible joy of the inhabitants^ he quietly left for Tangistan with all his people. The injury caused by this invasion was less than might have been supposed. Arrears of customs to the amount of 30,000 or 40,000 rupees had; indeed, been collected from the merchants of the town, who had also found it expedient to propitiate Baqir Khan with gifts; and presents to the value of Es. 3,789, which appeared to be expected; had been provided for him and for his principal men by the British Resident; but apart from these, from the spoliation of the Shaikhs and of some other Arabs, from the burning of a number of huts at the beginning of the occupa tion, and from the looting of a few shops on the day of the retirement, there were no losses. The evacuation of Bushehr by the Tangistanis did not, however, bring Counter- the disturbances to an end; for the people of the adjacent districts, Xa^gistan^by especially those of Arab race, and chiefs whose own position resembled that a confedera- j • y -a of the Shaikh of Bushehr, were resolved on punishing Baqir Khan and his August^Vo tribesmen for their wanton attempt to upset the established order of things. Before Baqir Khan had left Bushehr even, Arab bands were over-running his district of Tangistan, where they pillaged and laid waste villages and committed all sorts of atrocities upon his subjects, ' sparing neither sex nor age/'' On the 12th of July two Gallivats from Big, and on the 15th one from Ganaveh, arrived at Bushehr to take part in the intended operations against Baqir Khan ; and on the latter date. Shaikh Nasir not having as yet returned home, his brother Shaikh Sa ; dun was persuaded to place himself at the head of the retaliatory expedition. This body, which was composed chiefly of the warriors of Dashtistan, but which included also contingents from Ganaveh and Big, was already encamped near the village of Tangistan in the district of the same name; and by the middle of July it had attained a strength of about MOO men. On the 31st of July Shaikh Nasir arrived at Bushehr, ^companied by the two Gallivats that had sailed on the 2nd to meet ^ and by the two Rig Gallivats and the Ganaveh Gallivat, which had 0 owed for the same purpose upon the 26th ; with him came also the1850 Harami Shaikh of 'Asalu^ bringing two Gallivats^ and Shaikh Nasir of Bahrain, bringing one, so that there were in all 9 Gallivats besides 5 or 6 other vessels. Two vessels containing Bushehr property^ whicli incautiously separated from the rest of the fleet near Bandar ^Abbas to obtain water^ had been captured off Qishm by Shaikh ^Abdullah of Hormuz, who was at war with the Shaikh of Bushehr; but a ship belonging to the Imam of Masqat, with whom also Shaikh ^Abdullah bad lately been on bad terms, had accompanied Shaikh Nasir as far as ^Asalu and thence sailed for Zubarah. Shaikh Nasir, on arrival at Bushehr, invited the Khan of Bardistan to join the combination against Baqir Khan; at the beginning of August the invitation was accepted; and on the 7th of that month the Shaikhs of Bushehr, ^Asalu and Bahrain proceeded in person to the front. Close siege was laid to Baqir Khan in his principal fort by a force that now amounted to 4 ; 000 men with five or six heavy guns. Baqir Khan, on his part. Was not altogether without allies. On tlie 12th of August, 7 boats from Tahiri disembarked a reinforcement of 200 men for him at a convenient point on the coast; but 3 Gallivats were immediately sent from Bushehr to prevent the landing of any more similar contingents and, if possible, to capture the Tahiri boats before their return home. The Ka'ab Shaikh also was disposed to help Baqir Khan, who had solicited his aid immediately after taking possession of Bushehr; but difficulties with neighbours limited his efforts on behalf of his friend to the despatch of a single Tranki with 50 men. This vessi moreover, merely touched at Dilam at the end of July, and thence; in consequence of news of Baqir Khan's evacuation of Bushehr, returned direct to Doraq. On the 24th of August, having previously come out of his fort and consulted with the Mir of Eig, the Khan of Ganaveh, and other intermedi aries, Baqir Khan visited Shaikh N&amp;sir on a safe-conduct and promised to surrender the next day, and to give up his forts and all his property; but on the 25th he did not appear, and it was observed that he had utilised the armistice, as on a former occasion, to re-provision his W. On the 26th of August, however, he came again to Mir Mihr 'Ali of at the same time submitting to Shaikh Nasir a very false account oi^ effects taken from Bushehr ; ' but, while he was actually sitting wift Mihr 'Ali, a number of Ganaveh people who had a blood feud against him, having first obtained permission from Shaikh Nasir, fell upon h^ and killed him along with fifteen of his followers.

On the 27th a partial surrender of the late Khan^s followers took place; and on the 29th the whole proceedings concluded w itli the submission of his lieutenant Hamad^ who delivered up the prin cipal fort in Tangistan to Shaikh Nasir. The allied forces then dispersed to their homes, and* Tangistan was left, for the time being, in the posses- sioa of the Bushehr Shaikh. The chief credit for the overthrow of Baqir Khan was considered to be due to the Arabs whose prompt invasion of Tangistan had deranged his original schemes. The conduct of Baqir Khan was strongly resented^ as we have already seen, by the Persian Government; they immediately despatched messengers to every district between Kangun and Bandar Abbas to procure help for the allies ; and troops from Shiraz Would also have been sent to the spot, had not the leaders of the expedition to Tangistan, anticipating misbehaviour on their part, declined to receive any such reinforcement. During the crisis the British Factory at Basrah did everything in their power to assist Mr. Beaumont, the Resident at Bushehr; they wrote letters on his behalf to the Mir of Rig, to the Khan of Ganaveh, and to Baqir Khan himself; and they sent an Armenian merchant to Kharag, and a subordinate from their own staff to Bushehr, to render such further services as might be feasible. During the summer of 1780, Sadiq Khan's sovereignty of Persia being then disputed by Ali Murad Khan, the districts of the Persian Coast escaped from all control, and general confusion prevailed. In July Shaikh Abdullah of Hormuz was at war with the people of Charak j Shaikh Saqar of ^salu had lately burned a place, probably Tahiri, which belonged to his enemies; and the Qawasim of Ras-al-Khaimah, between whom and the Imam of 'Oman hostilities prevailed, seem to have com mitted depredations on the Bushehr fleet also, as there is mention in the records of the time of a vessel, named the ' Expedition,^ which they declined to restore to the Shaikh. During this season the town of Rig was accidentally destroyed by fire. The visit of Lutf Ali Khan, the Zand prince, to Bushehr in the s pnng of 1789, and his reception and the support which he obtained there, have already been noticed in the foregoing section which deals with the general history of Persia.

By the beginning of June 1792, in consequence of the defeat of Lutf ^.li Khan by Agha Muhammad Khan at Mayioor Giraj, events at the coast had taken a turn unfavourable to the sup porters of the Zand cau^e, but advantageous to the Shaikh of Bushehr, who had in the beginning espoused the side of the rebel Haji Ibrahim, Mihr Mi Khan of Big, being unable to take the field in consequence of a severe wound which he had received in battle with Lutf Mi Khan's enemies, submitted to a demand by Shaikh Nasir II that be should retire to Ganaveh and hand over Big to a former governor whom Lutf M Khan bad deposed. A little later the Shaikh of Bushehr endeavoured to take the island of Kharag, which belonged to Mihr Mi Khan, by means of a force of two or three hundred men supported by several armed boats j but the Dutch fort by which Kharag was defended was still strong, the commandant was a man of courage, and Mihr 'Ali Khan found means to reinforce the garrison ; and for these reasons the attack failed. Simultaneously an expedition was led by Shaikh Nasir in person against Khisht, the residence and domain of Zal Khan, another staunch partisan of Lutf Mi Khan, which was defended by a small M This was the position of affairs at the end of May 1792 ; and Nasir Khan seems to have remained at Khisht until the end of June, and then to have gone home unsuccessful; but within a month after his return to Bushehr, in consequence of the death of Mihr Mi Khan, Kharag passed quietly into his possession. Shaikh Nasir had ere this time received several summonses t ) attend the court of Agha Muhammad Khan at Shiraz ; but he did not desire a closer acquaintance with the Qajar ; and he was able, for a time at least, to evade compliance. About this time Saiyid Sultan, the ruler of 'Oman, obtained a foot' ing on the Persian Coast in virtue of a rev enue lease of Bandar ; Abbas, *Intlie official letter announcing the change, the Dames of the old and^ Shaikhs seem to be given as ' Nausir ' and - Nassir ' respectively, meaning P* Nasir and ISasr (Ullah); but before this the name of the old Shaikh also had generally been spelt ' Nassir ' or ' Nassur,' and it may be doubted whether there was tdl any difterenoe between the names.

The native merchants at Bushehr^ notwithstanding the prospect of further civil wars, were at this time ready to take off a supply of woollens; but the stock in the factory had been allowed, perhaps out of prudence in view of risk, to become depleted. The annual accounts of the Residency^ closing on the 80th of April 1780 ; showed a loss to the Company in the year just ended, through the existence of the Bushehr station, of Rs. 9,124. The total expenditure had been Rs. 14,585, and the total income conse quently less than Rs. 5,500; and, while Rs. 3,789 paid in blackmail to Baqir Khan and Rs. 2,000 expended in repairs to the factory were exceptional items of debit, the deficit apart from these was considerable. The Company^ customs yielded Rs. 4,385, but only Rs. 700 was obtained as freight on pearls and treasure consigned to India, the reason being that only one cruiser sailed from Bushehr for the Presidency during the whole twelve months. In 1784 a two percent, consulage at Bushehr, hitherto divided equally between the local Resident and the Governor of Bombay, was ordered to be otherwise treated, half the receipts being in future passed to the credit of the East India Company. In 1785, the Persian trade being still at a low ebb, Mr. ft Matcham &gt; a servant of the Company who was returning to Europe, received a passage on H.M.S. a Active ' and a commission from the Government of Bombay to travel home by way of Isfahan and investigate upon the spot the causes of its decline; but at the time of his arrival at Bushehr, in March 1785, the interior of Persia was so much disturbed that he was obliged to renounce, for the time at least, all thought of carrying out his instructions, and continued his journey by Basrah. Under Ja'far Khan commercial confidence began to revive in Persia, as both that prince and his enemy Agha Muhammad Khan tacitly made it a rule not to attack caravans or otherwise disturb trade; and in 1788 tk imports into Persia were larger than in any year since the death of Karlrn Khan. In 1790, under the orders of Government, a report on the trade ot the Persian Gulf was drawn up by Messrs. Manesty and Jones of the Basrah Factory, dealing very fully with the state of trade in Persia atto Co 1855 the time which was still less flourishing than it had been under Karim Khan. The principal port was Bushehr, where customB duties were lights though variable, and where the administration was of an easygoing Arab kind ; very favourable to trade. Since the loss of Bahrain in 1783 there had been little intercourse between Bushehr and the opposite coast of the Gulf; but there was a considerable trade, by native boats, with Masqat. The chief article imported direct from India at Bushehr was chintz from the coast of Coromandel. There were also cloth goods from Bengal^ but these were not suited to the Persian market and were brought to Bushehr only for the purpose of smuggling them into Turkish ; Iraq. Bengal merchants sent also some sugar candy, iron, and ; indigo was supplied by Masulipatam; and china and often arrived from Bombay in the vessels of the East India Company. The importations by native boat from Masqat were chiefly sugar, sugar candy, spices, coffee, metals and a variety of petty articles : of these the sugar, sugar candy, spices and metals mostly came to Masqat in French or Dutch vessels. The principal obstacle at one time in the way of a profitable trade at Bushehr was the abuse of his power by the Shaikh, himself a merchant, to control the local market. The state of trade at Bushehr always depended closely on the general and political situation at Shiraz ; and, under ordinary conditions, there was hardly a week in which one or more commercial caravans did not pass between the two places. When disturbances prevailed upon the direct road, goods for Isfahan were forwarded to their destination by Shushtar or Yazd instead of Shiraz. The cost of carriage from Bushehr to Shiraz was at this time 22^ to 23 J Bushehr rupees per mule load, and 25? to 261 Bushehr rupees per camel load. The best Persian opium was produced, in these days, in the neighbourhood of Kazaran ; and Shiraz supplied the whole Gulf with glass, sword-blades, spear-heads, and gun-barrels. Bandar^Abbas had now ceased to be a port of general consequence; and the trade route connecting it with Isfahan had fallen into total disuse. There was, however, some exportation of sulphur and rock-salt from Hormuz. Kirman wool was still a commodity of considerable value; but about 1788, in consequence of a prohibition on export by Ja^far Khan, only about 3,000 Tabriz Mans were obtainable annually. The foreign trade of Western Persia, if a trade between Basrah and Sbushtar be excluded, was entirely with Baghdad; and it was observed that the parts of the country served by Baghdad took, as compared Btisliehr. Bandar 'Abbas. Western Persia.1856 Eastern Persia. Establish ments of the East India Company on the Persian Coast. with others, a larger proportion of European and a smaller of Indian goods. The caravan road from Persia to Baghdad by Kirmanshan was ; as a rule, unsafe. Chintz and coarse cotton cloth manufactured at Shushtar were among the exports from Persia to Turkish 'Iraq. Tlie duties at Shushtar were very moderate. The regions of Makran and Sistan were as yet commercially of no account; but southern Khurasan and at times northern Kharasan, as well as Qandahar and Kabul; were supplied with foreign goods from Masqat by way of Sind and Multan. The trade from Masqat to Afghanistan and Khurasan by the Indus route had at this time only begun to attract notice, but it was regarded as highly promising, and it had been initiated by merchants of Bushehr. The goods sent for disposal in Afghanistan were woollens, Bengal piece-goods, Masulipatam chintz, and European fire-arms ; and the returns ' consisted partly in sliawls ; jewels and drugs. Matters apparently went from bad to worse; and at the beginning of June 1792, in consequence of the overthrow of Lutf ''Ali Khan, they reached such a point that Mr. Watkins, the^ Resident at Bushehr, reported as follows,— ic Ever since the revolution took place, all mercan- ii tile communication between Sherauz and Bushire has ceased, and it is ' easy to conceive the vast detriment commerce must consequently bave a sustained. Although many revolutions have happened of late years a in this country, not one had been attended with such injurious con- ' sequences to its trade. Owing to stagnation of trade money is ' extremely scarce, and, to add to the list of evils, every kind of gram ff and provisions are [sic) uncommonly scarce and dear.'' The Eesidency at Bushehr, the only settlement at this time n* tained by the East India Company in Persia, was no longer dependent on, or even connected with, the Factory at Basrah, which in 1778 bad been reduced from the status of an Agency, with powers of control over Residencies, to that of a Residency itself. The Residency building at Bushehr was repaired in 1779-1780 at ^ cost of Rs. 2,000 ; but unusually violent rains, which set in before th? ■work could be properly completed, again ' destroyed a fourth part of tli' s rotten factory ' ; and Mr. Beaumont, who at the same time applied^ transfer to India on the ground of indifferent health and a twelve years residence in the Gulf, reported that the rest was in danger of fal 1 ' 1 ' from every shower. These are trivial facts, but they cast a light on ® conditions of life at bushehr in the early days of the British Residency there.1867 ^ 'h AGHA MUHAMMAD KHAN, 1795—1797. ii'n The reign of Agha Muhammad Khan, the founder of the Qajar dynasty in Persia, lasted only two years, from 1795 to 1797 ; but, short though it was, it was signalised by the first establishment of contact between the politics of Europe and those of the Middle East. In the present place, however, we are not concerned with such far-reaching- questions; and, for an account of the developments of Kussian, French and British policy in regard to Persia at this time, the reader is referred to the chapter on the history of the Persian Gulf as a whole. from this tmn rcmising, i &gt; sent for || al 1' lei place, alt: General history of Persia, 1795—1797, lent at M Agha Muhammad Khan, while still a child, had been emasculated by order of 'Adil Shah, the nephew and successor of Nadir Shah, into whose power, about the year 1748, he had the misfortune to fall; and it was, inch injfli perhaps, in consequence of this accident that his whole life, from the time ; trade if be grew up, was dedicated to political ambitions, and that his pursuit of reryHnW them was characterised by systematic cruelties such as only ruthless cal- ' culation, combined with a wish to revenge his wrongs upon mankind at at this tiffll lar ^ 00111(1 have Aspired. igerdepeni ^ father, Muhammad Husain Khan, was defeated and killed in ^h in 1^' other chiefs of the same Qajar tribe, who had combined with ersofcoctol 131 ^ban, Zand, the ruler of Shiraz, to overthrow him; and from tHat year until 1779 Agha Muhammad Khan remained as a political 1779 fll , ^ SOner sou ^ ern capital. f'W Vakil he escaped from Shiraz with only 17 1 Ih ^ 0Wers reached northern Persia in safety; but after that some fou 1 veeis ' m co^gg^g w ith members of his own family before he to undisputed headship over the Qajars.

About 1786, while still competing with the Zands for the supremacy in Persia, Agha Muhammad Khan made Tehran his capital instead of Isfahan, which he had occupied in the previous year but had not been able to retain. In 1791, assisted by an internal revolution, he obtained possession of Shiraz, the seat of the Zand power; and by 1795 the whole of Persia was in his hands. He then set himself to intimidate, by a course of merciless severity, all tribal chiefs and others, who, with the examples of Nadir Shah and Karim Khan before their eyes, might venture to aspire to the crown, or from any other motive to trouble the peace of the country; and by acts intended to vilify and degrade the memories of Nadir Shah and Kaiim Khan, whose remains he even exhumed and caused to be reburied at the threshold of his palace, he did his utmost to efface such traditions of the past as seemed to detract from his own greatness. After the extension of his power to Southern Persia he appointed Haji Ibrahim, whose desertion of the Zands had given him Shiraz, to be his chief adviser: and his nephew Fat-h J Ali Shah, whom he had chosen to succeed him at his death, was made Governor of the whole province of Fars. Agha Muhammad Khan's military exploits, after he had acquired undivided sovereignty over Persia, were confined to the north. In 1795 he invaded Georgia, a province of which the ruler, Heraclius, had in 1783 placed himself under the protection of Catherine of Russia; and, as RussiaB aid was not instantly available, Tiflis, the capital, underwent sack and other dire atrocities at the hands of the Pertsians, During the winter of 1795-96 the Persian ruler remained in occupation of Georgia. He now, at length, consented to be crowned after a fashion ; but he refused the four-plumed diadem of Nadir Shah on the plea that the extent of the territories as yet in his possession was not sufficient to warrant his assuming it. From Georgia Agha Muhammad Khan marched to Khurasan, punishing some Turkoman tribes by the way; and at Mashhad, by tortures so severe as in the end to cause death, he wrung from Shah Eukh, the blind grandson of Nadir Shah, the treasures, chiefly gems, remaining i 11 possession of his family. He next threatened the principality of Bukhara with invasion, unless all Persians kidnapped and enslaved by the were set at liberty ; and hostilities with Baigi Jan, the virtual ruler and a man of no less unusual character than himself, might have followed, M Ins attention had not been distracted by events in a different quarter. ^fcPei Hiiii tiler f«'£l '■Br, '/«tn 7 ; 'fr 18 a K1859 The mission of MM.

The Russians had now begun to advance, in considerable stren^tli, upon the northern frontier of Persia ; and on the 20t]r September 1796 Agha Muhammad Khan arrived at Tehran from Mashhad to make dispositions for meeting their threatened attack. The danger of: invasion was removed for the time, however, by the death of Catherine of Russia on the 9th of November 1796 ; and in the early spring of 1797, encour aged by the Russian retirement Agha Muhammad Khan undertook a second invasion of Georgia.

As it is impossible to separate the history of Persia in the Persian Gulf from the history of Persia at large, we may here review the latter in some of its principal aspects. Internal history ot Persia, 179 7 —1834. The internal history of Persia during the reign of Fat-h 'Ali Shall is roughly divided into periods by two wars with .Russia, to be noticed hereafter, which ended respectively with the treaty of Gulistan in 1813 and the Treaty of Turkmanchai in 1828. In spite of various precautions which Agha Muhammad Khan had taken for securing the succession of his nephew and heir, Fat-h 'Ali Shah was engaged for some time after he ascended the throne in con tests with pretenders to the crown and other rebels against his authority, During the lifetime of Agha Muhammad Khan he had been generally spoken of as Baba Khan or Baba 'Ali Khan; but, after his coronation on the 21st of March 1798, the earlier appellation was dropped for that of Fatrh 'Ali Shah, by which he is known to history. Almost the first act of the new sovereign was to blind his uncle ; Ali Quli Khan, a brother of Agha Muhammad Khan not before mentioned by name, who had unduly delayed to testify his respect by waiting on him; and immediately afterwards he marched in person against Sadiq Khan, a military commander who had been implicated in the murder of Agha Muhammad Khan, and who now clearly aspired on his own account to the supreme power. Sadiq Khan was defeated in the neighbourhood of Qazvm; but he made his peace with the Shah by delivering up the | crown* jewels of Persia, of which he had possessed himself at the death i of the late ruler, and was then pardoned and even invested with a Appendix II, contains the text of two French Treaties with Persia.

A member of the Zand family, named Muhammad Khan,—who is described as a son of Zaki Khan but is not, apparently, mentioned as such at any earlier date,—next seized Isfahan j but he was promptly driven out by the troops of the Qajars and took refuge in the Bakhtiyari mountains. After this Sadiq Khan with the help of several other chiefs again made war upon the Shah, and, having been overthrown by a Qajar general, Sulaiman Khan, was par- o be if d0ne(1 a SeCOnd time; but at least ' o£ his P ri ncipal associates was less fortunate and paid the penalty of rebellion with his life.

In the settlement of this case Fat-h J Ali Shah showed own aj great magnanimity, for he appointed his brother to the Government of neigW Kashan to console him for the los^of Shiraz, and he spared the lives of rgring i Muhammad Vali Khan and Sulaiman Khan, and even restored the latter jlf at Mto favour.

The Shah, on his .wereduced the towns of Turbat and Nishapur, which Were in • 14- • ievolt against him ; and, on his arrival at his destination, the1862 usurping 1 Mirza duly madG his submission and was pGrniilted to rotain the government. Fat-h 'Ali Shah's return to Tehran from this expe dition appears to have taken place after the middle of 1798 ; and, in tkt case, the first year of his reign must have been an arduous one. Some time afterwards, probably in the summer of 1799, Fat-h Ali Shah assembled an army, intending to make war on Zaman Shah, the ruler of Kabul, who had demanded the cession of Khurasan; but in tlie end, Zaman Shah having withdrawn his pretensions, the force was employed instead to chastise the rulers of Sabzavar and Nishapur, who had shown signs of insu bordination. The destruction of that incorri- giblo rebel Sadiq Khan res ulted indirectly from the call to arms ; for, on his neglecting to obey a summons to join the army, he was taxed with treachery, arrested, and walled up in a room at Tehran, where he perished by starvation. Early in 1800 the Shah again visited Khurasan, but returned to his capital before the end of the year. After this, perhaps in the next year, Husain Quli Khan, the brother of the Shah, wer' into rebellion once more and temporarily obtained possession of Isfahan by means of a forged patent of appointment as Governor, On the approach of a royal force, however, he fled; and, finding himself cut off from the Turkish frontier, across which he had intended to retire, he threw himself upon the mercy of the Shah at He was again forgiven, and soon afterwards he died a natural death in the vicinity of Tehran. No sooner had his b rother's revolt been quelled than Fat-h 'Ali Shah was obliged to proceed to Khurasan, where com plaints against the administration of Nadir Mirza were rife; but, before matters had been fully settled there, he returned to Tehran. The date of fchis journey appears to have been IS02. The Shah subsequently reinforced some troops left before the Walls of Mashhad to receive charge of Nadir Mirza, whose surrender had been guaranteed by Saiyid MA the chief Mujtahid of the town ; and ere long, in consequence of excesses to which Nadir Mirza proceeded, such as plundering the shrine of I^ 111 Biza and putting to death Saiyid Mehdi, the citizens admitted the royalists within the walls. The Mirza attempted to escape, but he ^ pursued, captured, and taken to Tehran, where, by order of the Shah and with the full approval of the public, he suffered the loss of tongue, hands, and eyes. The Shah inherited his first prime minister, Haji Ibrahim, from h lS uncle, who had been originally placed in possession of Shiraz by that able and probably unscrupulous individual. Fat-h 'Ali Shah, howeve r ;foil lilt 1863 seems ' to have feared that a statesman who had failed in loyalty to a Zand might prove equally untrustworthy towards a Qajar; he early associated two colleagues with the Haji, as a check upon his actions ; and ia 1801 * or 1802, in consequence of sinister reports that had begun to circulate regarding the minister's intentions, he caused him to be put to death. A number of Haji Ibrahim's relations, by whom a large part of Persia was governed, perished simultaneously with him upon an appointed day. Prom 1801 to 1813, or during the remainder of this first period, war 1804-13 continued intermittently between Eussia and Persia, overshadowing all : W domestic occurrences in the latter kingdom. We may mention, however rft that in 1812-1813, after a severe defeat of the Persian army by the H Rus3ians ' ) tlie clliefs Khurasan rose against Muhammad Vali Mirza, the Shah s son, by whom the province was governed. The rulers of edVi Bukhara and Khiva sent aid to the insurgents, but this movement on their part was premature, for the head of an ecclesiastical family of .y Mashhad, acting in the interest of the Shah, was able temporarily to ofc break up the combination of domestic rebels; and then, while the Central tal f L Sia ',! 0rCeS / etired With ^ nomill 7' a ro y a l army inflicted punishment on d;, e Khurasams. Some Turkmans who had risen under the leader- ikt ®'P of a Qajar were also chastised, about the same time, by order of .tk the Shah. 1* Fat-h'Ah Shah had an enormous familyt; but only four of his l IT attained i / 0 a,1 y prominence in public affairs during his life-time. &gt;«j ese were Muhammad 'Ali Mlrza, the eldest, flerce and truculent, who fti and superintended the affairs of Persian ur istan, but who from the first, perhaps as the offspring ofa Georgian ve, was treated as ineligible for the succession; 'Abbas Mirza, the Tit Jl; en r' C -. b, : tCaP ~' whow a s recognised as heir apparent, B R . er ^rbaijan, and generally commanded in the war against the ' « far,;' H r (0 ' H ™' ' Ali M &gt;'*. fiW «•« government of ^hiraz afe the removal therefrom of 1...UW t OOTlCOAn^-^i-l il . consequently the adviser of Husain Quli Khan and was the Shah in Persian Gulf affairs: and p0j HH ^ ' ■—- ■ of lte | ^ af . tei ', th / departui ' C of General [10 loss ® May 1802. h 18 01 and before the arrival of Mr. Waring in the country in jhitt, fe' 'mbted 1 '1 w ^ p' 1 ( ^ St0r - V FerSia ' pa ' e 269) M8 own st,n8 5hira! ¥ l0 ~ 411 )' 0ther estlmate3 see M Curzon (Persia, vol.

Not ion^ aftor the close of the first Russian war, Muhammad Vali Mirza, who had treacherously murdered Is-haq Khan of Turbat/ tk most influential chief of Khurasan, possibly under instructions from the Shah, was recalled from Mashhad, where his place was taken for a time by his brother Hasan ; Ali Mirza, formerly of Shiraz. In 1817 the head of the Isma'ili sect, a progenitor of the present Agha Khan of Bombay, who resided at Yazd^ was killed in a riot between shop-keepers of the town and some of his own servants Fat-h ^Ali Shah, who feared the vengeance of the Isma/ili sect ; was careful to conciliate them by punishing one of the principal offenders and by adopting a son of the deceased, on whom he conferred much property in addition to that which he inherited. The actual murderers of the sacred chief did not escape retribution at the hands of Isma^ilis. Persia was visited in 18^1-182^ by a severe epidemic of cholera; it* carried off the Shah^s eldest son, Muhammad 'Ali Mirza, who was tben engaged in a war with the Turks. The disease also caused the death at Shiraz of Mr. Rich, British Political Agent at Baghdad, and that of Dr. Jukes, a Special Commissioner from the Government of India to Persia. Another victim was Mirza Buzurg, a worthy man and one of the principal officials of the Shah, who died on the 14th of August 182^. Mirza Buzurg was a nephew of Mirza Muhammad Husain the minister of Sadiq Khan, Ja^far Khan and Lutf ^ Ali Khan, and he thus belonged to a family that had lost its place at court through the fall of the Zand dynasty and the enmity of Haji Ibrahim. After a time, however) he had become adviser to ^ Abb as Mirza, the heir apparent, and received the title of Qaim-Maqam ; and finally he rose to such favour that about 1811, on the death of his eldest son in the Crown Prince's service; a daughter of the Shah was bestowed in marriage upon his youngest son as a mark of sympathy. i During the Russian war of 1826-1828 disorganisation spread feraj wide through Persia. The Shah's son Muhammad Vali Mirza, who been sent to govern Yazd, was expelled and insulted by the inbabite Bts of the town; the people of Isfahan withheld tt.e revenue due them; and the province of Kirman broke into open rebellion- On conclusion of peace with the Russians Hasan 'AH Mirza, lately gotew 01 * According to another aoconnt, however, Muhammad 'Ali Mirza died bffor ® 'J* commencement of the epidemic, and the course of the illness which carried him ^ less rapid than that of cholera.1865 of Khurasan and formerly o£ Fars ; was sent with troops to restore order in the south j but he failed to do so, at least at Yazd. Simultaneously the provinces of Kirmanshah and Hamadan were entrusted to ^Abbas Mirza in addition to that of Azarbaijan, which he already held. The chiefs of Khurasan had revolted in the meanwhile ; and in August 1828 Mashhad was seized by a leader of local influence, nor could it immediately be recovered. In 1830, in which year the Shah paid a personal visit to Isfahan, 1830-33. Khurasan was added to the already unwieldy charge of the Crown Prince; but he was ordered to settle the affairs of the south before entering on those of the north-eastern province. ^Abbas Mirza was successful not only in reducing Yazd, but also in capturing the chief of the malcontents there, who was afterwards done to death by Muhammad Vali Mirza at Tehran ; and the people of Kirman, whence Hasan ^Ali Mirza was sent back to the presence of the Shah under an escort, received 'Abbas Mirza with open arms. Arriving in Khurasan, the frontiers of which he ill had been directed by his father to extend to the Oxus,—the true boundary of Persia, as laid down in the time of Nadir Shah,—he adopted measures against the roving tribes of the neighbourhood; and he even captured with great slaughter the Turkman town of Sarakhs, which depended to a large extent on a traffic in Persian slaves. He next prepared to attack Herat and its districts, upon his eastern border ; but at this point he was recalled by his father to Tehran, and his place on the north-eastern frontier was taken by his son Muhammad Mirza. The Crown Prince's health was now failing, but the Shah could not persuade him to remain at Tehran, and he soon left again for Mashhad, where he died in 1833, in ^he forty-sixth year of his age. Muhammad Mirza was then summoned to Tehran, designated heir to the thronej and appointed governor of Azarbaijan. Meanwhile Hasan 'Ali Mirza, who had once more become ruler of Pais under the title of Farman-Farma, began to withhold the revenue of his province; and in the autumn of 1834 the Shah, whose ruling passion was avarice, and who had lately suffered in pocket through the capture of some royal treasure by Bakhtiyari robbers between Isfahan and Tehran, set off for the south to investigate the matter himself. He arrived safely at Isfahan, where Hasan 'Ali Mirza shortly appeared, but the latter rought only 13,000 Tumans out of 600 ,000 for which he was account- a e, and his father accordingly superseded him in his government and ■-ent a minister with troops to recover the balance due from the province, few days later the Shah was attacked by fever ; and on the 23rd of 1834;1866 October 1834 3 after a very short illness, he died at Is£ahan ; aged sixty- eight years. Character of The personality of Fat-h 'Ali Shah was remarkable for its inconsist- Shah 1 Al1 encies. He was dignified in person and maintained truly royal state, yet in money matters he showed a sordid meanness which was as un becoming to his rank as it was often injurious to his political interests. His attitude in foreign affairs was characterised by personal pride and national conceit ; but whether he possessed courage is a debated question, and he was at least more of a diplomat than of a soldier. Merciful as a rule to his opponents, and uniformly affectionate towards his own family, he was nevertheless capable, in particular circumstances, of acting with great severity and even with barbarity. His common sense was remarkable, but it was liable to be perverted at all times by avarice, and occasionally by vanity. Relations of Persia with Afghanistan,* 1797—1834. We cannot pass over altogether in silence the relations of Persia with Afghanistan during the reign of Fat-h 'Ali Shah ; for designs upon the territory of his eastern neighbour, albeit they could not to any great extent be realised, bulked largely in the foreign policy of the Shah. Reign of From the time of his accession Fat-h 'Ali Shah countenanced and Zaman # n Shah, 1797^- even supported Mahmud and Feroz-ud-Din, two rebellious brothers ot 1801, Zaman Shah, the Sadozai ruler of Afghanistan. His object was, doubt less, to weaken the royal house of Afghanistan by internal dissensions, and to attach one or two of its members to his own interests. As we shall see further on, he was encouraged in this scheme by an emissary from the British Government in India, which then feared a raid by Zaman Shah in the direction of its own dominions; and a Persian expedition into Afghanistan actually took place before the end of 1798; but met with no success. In the summer of 1799 a more serious crisis occurred. To a demand by Zaman Shah for the surrender to him ^ Khurasan, Zaman Shah retorted by claiming the whole of Afghanistan as a dependency of Persia ; and thereafter, as a proof of the seriousness of his intentions, he collected a large force and himself proceeded f 1,0111 *lThe information contained in this section is largely taken from Watson's Histo'l of Persia, which, depending in Afghan questions upon native Persian Soured probably magnifies Persian successes and minimises Persian failures.1867 Tehran to iMashhad. Zaman Shah, however^ alarmed by these preparations, despatched an ambassador with presents to Fat-h 'AH Shah, who was easily induced by this means to return to Tehran. The Afghan rebels Mahmud and Feroz-ud-Din, already mentioned, were at this time domiciled in Persia, or had lately visited it to solicit help of the Shah ; and the latter accordingly, in withdrawing from the frontier, stipulated that they should be received by Zaman Shah and treated by him in future in a manner befitting their rank as princes. The Ghorian district situated to the westward of Herat, remained in the hands of the Persians, by whom it had been occupied. Not long after this, Mahmud and Feroz-ud-Din, h iving been joined by Fateh Khan, Barakzai, obtained possession of Herat; and from that place as a base Mahmud subsequently advanced to Qandahar, which he captured, Feroz-ud-Din remaining behind in charge of Herat. In 1801 Zaman Shah was blinded and deposed. Mahmud took his place and ruled over all Afghanistan until 1803, when he was expelled from the greater part of the country by Shah Shuja/ and probably returned to Herat. After the accession of Shah ShujV, an invasion of the Qandahar district was undertaken by Kamran, son of Mahmud, with the assistance of Fateh Khan, Barakzai ; but a movement of the Persians against Herat obliged him to retrace his steps, Feroz-ud-Din, after corrupting the Persian official in charge ol: Ghorian, had sent a force into that district with a view of annexing it to his own government ; but the Afghans had been defeated in their attempt with heavy slaughter ; and thus it came about that the Persian Governor of Khurasan was now at the gates of Herat. The operations resulted, according to Persian accounts, in the complete humiliation of Feroz-ud-Din, who was obliged to promise to pay tribute to Persia in future, to furnish two annual instalments at once under the name of arrears, to deliver up his own son as a hostage, and to surrender the Persian official with whom he had intrigued in regard to Ghorian. These events occurred in 18U5. In 1809 or 1810 Mahmud, supported by Fateh Khan, Barakzai, N-^in came to the head of affairs in Afghanistan, and Shah Shuja was driven from the country. In 1816 or 1817 Hasan 'Ali Mirza, w ho had lately been appointed by his father, the Shah, to the governor- S ^P of Khurasan, advanced upon Herat, capturing the Hazarah strongs of Mahmudabad by the way. The reason of this incursion was the appropriation, once more, by the Afghans of the debatable district Ghorian; and Feroz-ud-Din, struck with terror at the example of First reign of Mahmud, 1801—03. Reign of Shah Shuja* 1803—09. Second reigti of Mahmud, 1810—17.1868 Mahmudabad, where the Persians had behaved with great cruelty, has tened to relinquish his conquest. Hasan 5 Ali Mirza, however, would not be appeased, but proceeded to lay siege to Herat in regular form; and Feroz-ud-Dm thought it prudent to make full submission, to pay a fine of 50,000 Tumans, and to engage that at Herat thenceforth the public prayers should be recited, and the coinage struck, in the name of the Shah of Persia. The Persians afterwards made an expedition into mountainous country against a Firuz Kuh tribe who were harbour ing the late rui^r of Ghorian, but it ended in a serious disaster and in the retirement of their forces to Mashhad. Meanwhile Feroz-ud-Dm had appealed to his brother Mahmad at Kabul for assistance against the invaders. The result was the despatch of a large Afghan force west wards under Fateh Khan, now Mahmud's chief minister, who, with the rest of the Barakzai family, was already secretly preparing to dispute the sovereignty of Afghanistan with the ruling Sadozais. Fateh Khan invited the Khan of Khiva to co-operate with him against the Persians and was not disappointed of his aid ; but, when this ally had advanced as far as Sarakhs, the unwieldy and disunited Afghan army was attacked and scattered in Ghorian by a compact Persian force under Hasan ; Ali Mirza. During these transactions the palace of Feroz-ud-Din at Herat had been plundered and its Sadozai inmates insulted by Dost Muham mad, afterwards ruler of Afghanistan, a younger brother of Fateh Khan; and the Barakzai minister, on his return from his unsuccessful campaign against the Persians, whether in expiation of this outrage committed by his near relation or with a view to appeasing the Shah of Persia, was first blinded by the hand of Kamran and then hacked to pieces under the orders of Kamran's father, Mahmud. A period of several years of turmoil succeeded, during which the Barakzai Sardars, of whom Dost Muhammad was now the most promi^ nent, made themselves masters of the greater part of Afghanistan j but Herat still remained in the possession of Mahmud and Kamranj the heads of the Sadozai family, and had become their place of residence. During this troublous time the assistance of the Shah of Persia, for recovering Kabul, was more than once requested by Kamran, Dost By 1826 the authority of Dost Muhammad had become establishes » throughout most of Afghanistan except the Herat and Qandahar prov inces, of which the latter, not being under his powerful protection; was liable to encroachments by the Persiacs. In 1833 'Abbas the Crown Prince of Persia, who had recently been appointed his father 8 representative in Khurasan, resolved on an effort for tffe annexation1869 of Herat* to Persia and applied to the Shah for additional troops, which were immediately sent him. Fat-h 'AH Shah, however, became anxious at this time to see his favourite son once more, and summoned him to Tehran; and the charge of the troops and of the military operations devolved in his absence, along with the governorship of Khurasan, upon the Crown Prince's son Muhammad Mirza. The young prince advanced upon Ghorian, which was now again in possession of the Afghans, but failed to take it, and passed on to Herat. Advised by M. Barofisky, a Polish officer, he began a siege of the town but it was defended with spirit by Kamran, whose troops made at least one successful sally against the Persians j and in the autumn of 1833, in consequence of the death of the Crown Prince, who had meanwhile returned to Mashhad, the operations were suspended before any definite result had been attained. On receiving a bare promise that tribute would in future be rendered to the Shah for Herat,—an undertaking already repeatedly given, but indifferently or never observed,— Muhammad Mirza withdrew his trqops and returned to Persia. Relations of Persia with Turkey,11797—1834, for^ During the reign of Fat-h 'Ali Shah there was from time to time friction, and even open war, between Persia and Turkey. In 1801, when the Wahhabis from Najd fell without warning upon the sacred Shi'ah town of Karbala, plundered it, massacred the inhabitants—many of whom were Persians, and desecrated the shrine of Husain, a profound and painful sensation ran through Persia. The Shah returned to his capital from an expedition in the provinces, and at first proposed to treat Sulaiman Pasha of Baghdad as responsible for the catastrophe; but on second thoughts, and after being well bribed by the Turkish governor in question, he allowed himself to be pacified by an assurance that the Wahhabis would be punished by the Turks. In or about 1806 war broke out between Persia and Turkey on their common frontier north of Kirmanshah. The subject of dispute * An expedition to Herat had been planned by the Persians in 1832, or even earlier. The idea was now-encouraged by Russia, as it had been by Britain in the time ot Zaman Shah ; but Mr. McNeill, the British representative at Tehran, was able for a time to prevent its being carried into execution. t The Persian authorities followed by Watson have probably shown some partiality for their own country in describing the national relations with Turkey, especially the course of the wars. Vide the remark on page 1866 in regard to Afghan relations Indignation in Persia at the sack of Karbala by the Wahha bis, 1801. Trouble between Persia and Turkey on the Kurdis tan frontier, 1806.1870 seems to have been the Kurdish district of Shehrizor adjoinino- Sulaimamyah, then governed by a certain 'Abdnr B ahman Pasha, a Turkish vassal. ''Abdur Rahman^ in consequence of a difficulty with 'AH Pasha, Wali of Baghdad, retired to Persia; and his cause was espoused by Muhammad 'Ali Mirza, the eldest son of Fat-h ^Ali Shah who had lately been appointed governor of Kirmanshah, An armed conflict followed between the Persian prince and Sulaiman Pasha, the son-in-law of ^Ali Pasha, of which the result—according to the Persian chroniclers — was that the Turks suffered defeat and were pursued by the Persians into the neighbourhood of Baghdad, that their commander was carried a prisoner to Tehran but afterwards released, and that 'Abdur Eahman was reinstated in the government of his districts. He agreed to hold them in future as a dependent of Persia ; and, as a guarantee of good faith, he placed his son as a hostage in the hands of the Persian Government. Rapproche- Early in the spring of 1810 there was a movement, under British ment between auB pi ceSj f 01 , a c i ose understanding between Turkey and Persia, and the Porte were persuaded by the British Ambassador at Constantinople to despatch a representative to the Persian Court. In the following o autumn the Turkish Envoy duly arrived in Persia; and, his work there being completed, he returned to Constantinople at sometime in 1811. In 1811 a disagreement occurred between the Prince Governor of Kirmanshah and the Kurdish chief 'Abdur Kahman Pasha, who had Turkey Tn ]ately instrumeiltal in setting up a new Pasha at Baghdad, and the Kurdistan 11 ow seemed anxious to repudiate his allegiance to Persia. The result was a forward movement by Muhammad ''Ali Mirza, who took temporary possession of Sulaimaniyah; and 'Abdur Rahman Pasha made his submission,—not, however, in time to save the life of the son whom he had given as a hostage to the Persians. A little later 'Abdullah, the new Pasha of Baghdad, moved out against 'Abdur Rahman and took Sulaimamyah; but the Persian Government were induced by the British Ambassador at Tehran to stand neutral upon this occasion. In the end the Pasha of Baghdad was persuaded to pay a sum of money to the Shah under the name of compensation for the expenses which Persia had incurred through intervention, or preparations for intervention, in Kurdistan j and the Turkish troops were apparently withdrawn from the country. In 1821 fresh trouble arose from the protection by the Turkish authorities at Erzeroum of two tribes which the governor of Azarbarjan, then Abbas Mirza, the Crown Prince of Persia, claimed Persia and Turkey, 1810-11. Renewed trouble between frontier, 1811. Perso-Tur- kish war, 1821—1823.1871 as belonging to his jurisdiction. It ended in a successful invasion of Turkish territory by the Persian forces, which penetrated as far as Bitlis and occupied various points in the districts that they overran. The Turks attempted a counter-attack in the frontier tract of Shehri- zor; but they were worsted by Muhammad 'Ali Mirza, who followed up his advantage over them and threatened Baghdad. In July or August there was a Turkish force at Mandali, under the Kehiyah^ to cover the capital, where the Pasha remained. At this juncture, however, the Persian prince became dangerously ill and retired with his troops to the Persian hills, where he died at Kirind. In the north the war continued under the auspices, upon the Persian side, of ^Abbas Mirza. In marching to the relief of one of the garrisons established by the Persians upon Turkish soil the Mirza achieved a fresh and striking triumph over the Turks, but he then withdrew, as the enemy had signified their willingness to treat upon that condition, to the Persian side of the border. Meanwhile hosti lities had been renewed on the side of Shehrizor; the Shah him self arrived at Hamadan with a large force, with the supposed intention of making under its protection a pilgrimage to Karbala and Najaf; and another victory was gained over the Turks by the son of the late Muhammad ; Ali Mirza. When matters had reached this stage, however, cholera appeared upon the scene and put an end to the military operations. Before peace was actually concluded, a fresh rupture with the Pasha of Baghdad took place ; bnt he was obliged to pay an indemnity and to consent, for the future, to the passage through his dominions, without payment of tolls, of Persian pilgrims on their way to the holy cities of the Shfahs. Amity was formally restored on the 28th of July 1823, some time after the cessation of actual hosti- |1| by the first Treaty of Erzeroum. This compact re-established the frontier which had existed before the war ; and from this simple fact it may perhaps be inferred that the course of the fighting had not been entirely unfavourable to the Turks. Relations of Persia with other states of the Persian Gulf, especially 'Oman, 1797—1834. 'Oman was the state in the Persian Gulf with which, next to the Turkish Empire, Persia had most connection during the period under1872 review. The transactions between the two Governments related largely to Bahrain affairs ; and^ in so far as they did, they are described in the chapter on the history of that prindpality. Others are mentioned in the history of the ^Oman Sultanate; others again, as affecting the Persian Coast, are dealt with in a later section of the present chapter ; and here it will be sufficient merely to enumerate, in chronological order, the leading features of the intercourse between the states. 1799-1800. In 1799, encouraged by the Persian Governor of Fars, the Sultan of 'Oman declared war upon the 'Utub of Bahrain ; but the only gainer by his naval successes was Persia, under whose protection the 'Utub at once placed themselves, and to whom they even paid a year's tribute. The Sultan, annoyed at the duplicity of the Shaikh of Bushehr, by ^hom this unexpected turn had been given to the affair, then seized Kharag Island ; but he was not able to retain it long. 1802, In 1802, the Persians actually lent some military assistance to the Sultan of 'Oman for his invasion of Bahrain in that year; but the success of the allies, in consequence of the growth of the Wahhabi danger upon the home frontier of ^Oman, had no permanent results. 1805. I n 1805 Saiyid Badar, a usurping ruler of 'Oman, forcibly recovered with British aid, as will be related hereafter, the fief of Bandar 'Abbas and its dependencies, which had been seized by Persian subjects. 1811-13. next Sultan, Saiyid Sa'id, sent an embassy to Shiraz in 1811 to solicit help against a TV^ahhabi invasion of his dominions and in the following year a Persian contingent was sent to his assistance, but it met with disaster in the uplands of 'Oman. In the meantime a Wahhabi envoy, Ibiahim-bin 'Abdul Karim, had waited on the Persian Governor of Fars at fehiraz to dissuade him from hostile action against the Wahhabi po^wer, and had been received with fair words. 1816. When the Sultan of 'Oman next attacked the Bahrain Islands, in the summer of 1816, he was supported, under the orders of the Persian Government, by vessels from Bushehr and drafts of fighting men from Kangun and 'Asalu ; but, when after the disastrous failure of his land ing on Muharraq he repaired to Kangan to take on board reinforcements promised by the Governor of Fars, he found that the Persians meant tc seize him by treachery, and accordingly abandoned the enterprise. ^ this occasion a regular agreement had been drawn up, defining the financial conditions on which the Persians gave their assistance^ and practically assigning to the Sultan the position of a Persian fief-holder in Bahrain, should he succeed in taking the islands by means of the expedition.{IO€i) 1873 In 18^0^ there was intense jealousy and secret rivalry between Persia I 8 20. an cl ; 0mari in regard to the possession of Bahrain, which came to the notice of the commander of the British expedition in that year against Ras al -Khaimah ; but no overt step was taken by either Government. This matter is dealt with in a later paragraph. An attempt by the Persians to oust the Sultan of 'Oman from his 1823—26. Bandar 'Abbas fief, in 1823, and hostilities which took place between Saiyid Sa'id of'Oman and Shaikh 'Abdur Easul of Bushehr, in 1826- 18E7 ; are noticed in a later section of the present chapter. Persia took no part in the final and unsuccessful attempt of the 1828—29. Saiyid, in 1828, to annex Bahrain to his dominions ; and a settlement arranged in the following year between him and the 'Utub was the work of Muhammad-bin-Nasir of the Bushehr family of Shaikhs. In 1829, and again in 1830-31, as will be explained further on, 1829—31. Saiyid Sa'id nearly became involved in disturbances which took place at Bushehr, the reason of his interest being a marriage which be had contracted in 1827 with a daughter of the Prince Governor of Shiraz. Relations of native powers in India with the Persian Govern ment, 1797—1834. At the beginning of this period a diplomatic connection still existed between the Government of Tipu Sultan in India and that of Fat-h ; Ali Shah. The last envoy sent by the doomed ruler of Mysore to Persia arrived in the Gulf in the summer of 1799^ was sent by the Sultan of 'Oman in one of his own vessels from Masqat to Bushehr, and probably landed in Persia about the end of August. This mission, whicli brought three elephants and other gifts for the Shah, was rendered futile by the overthrow and death of the sender. Again, about 1805, the Shah received envoys from the Amirs of Sind, who bad taken alarm at the progress of the British power in India. Relations of Russia with Persia, 1797—1834. During the reign of Fat-h 'Ali Shah, Persia was brought into serious conflict with Russia ; and in the course of the struggle she lost, in two 1281574 ft Perso- Eussian War of 1804—13, 1804 1805. campaign^ §ome districts that she bad until then possessed of the modern Transcaucasia. When peace was at length firmly established ftg attitude of Persia towards Russia was found to have undergone a change and to have become one of deference and almost submission. We have seea that Agha Muhammad Khan had, in 1795-96, invaded and occupied Georgia with striking if somewhat barbarous success; and it is probable that until about 1800 Persian prestige in Transcaucasia stood as high as Russian. Soon after the accession of Fat-h 'Ali Shah, Gurgin Khan of Georgia, the son and successor of Heraclius, volun- tarily professed allegiance to Persia ; but on the 28th of September 1800, with equal or even greater weakness, he signed away his crown in favour of the Tsar. The Russians then proceeded to take possession of the country, overthrowing a patriotic party headed by Alexander, a younger brother of Gurgin Khan, and captured Ganjeh, the modern Elizabetpol; but it was not until they advanced to besiege Erivan ttat war with Persia began. In the spring of 1804 ^Abbas Mirza, the Crown Prince of Persia, crossed the Aras River to oppose the Russians; and in July he was defeated by Zizianoff, a Russian Commander of Georgian extraction, in two pitched battles, of which the first was fought near Echmiazin and the second close to Erivan. The declared intention of the Russians was now to take possession of the whole country up to the line of the Aras. The Persians, after some experience of the war, resorted to raids by mounted forces upon the Russian lines of communication ; and in the end the besiegers of Erivan were obliged to retire upon Tiflis. The chief of Eiivan, however, by whom the place had been defended, showed mucli unwillingness to admit Persian troops to his citadel after the departure of the Russian forces. In the next year, 1805, the principal scene of operations was the district of Karabagh, further to the eastward than Erivan; and from it the Persians seem to have succeeded in expelling the Russians for a time. A Russian expeditionary force was landed at Enzeli} but, fail ing on account of various obstacles to attain Rasht, which was its first objective, it was embarked again at the same port. The Persian Crown Prince occupied Ganjeh, which had been evacuated by the Russians; but the Muscovites on their part obtained possession of Shisheh, the chief place m the Karabagh district, which was nearer than Ganjeh to Persia proper. This phase of the war ended with the treacherous assassination of Zizianoff at Baku, which the Russians were at the time besieging, hj tbe native chief of that place,1875 The Russians, after this event, recovered Ganjeh and gradually 1805—12. strengthened their hold upon the greater part of the country in dispute. At one time they seem to have suggested, as the basis of a treaty, the cession to themselves of all the districts north of the Aras except Erivan; but the proposal was rejected by the Persian monarch, who had not yet reconciled his mind to the loss of any district hitherto held by Persia. In 1808 -09, the Russians again besieged Erivan, under the command of Godovitch, and again were obliged to relinquish the siege; this time they fell back upon Ganjeh. In the summer of 1809 the Shah re- mained encamped at Chaman Ujan, 30 miles south-east of Tabriz, in somewhat dangerous proximity to the frontier, for the Persians never had any reliable information of the movements of the R ussians. The Persians after this pressed the war somewhat energetically for a time, the Shah's eldest son, Muhammed ' Ali Mirza, ravaging the country from Erivan to the Gokcheh Lake, while his brother ' Abbas Mirza, the Crown Prince, almost succeeded in retaking Ganjeh with the help of some of the Armenian inhabitants. The army of the former prince was organised, trained and equipped on Persian, that of the latter, so far as possible, on European principles. In the early spring of 1810 Baron Wrede visited the Crown Prince of Persia at Tabriz, to discuss terms of peace with him, on the part of General Tormasoff, then com manding in Georgia ; but nothing was arranged. At the beginning of 1812 a Persian force commanded by Colonel D'Arcy, a British officer in the Persian service, defeated a Russian force near Shisheh, killing 300 of the enemy, taking 500 prisoners, and capturing 2 guns. In the autumn of the same year, however, a terrible disaster befell the army of the Crown Prince, who, after some abortive negotiations with the Russians in which the British Ambassador to Persia had taken part as an intermediary, was encamped in fancied security at Aslanduz on the Persian bank of the Aras. On the 31st of October the Persians were surprised in a disadvantageous position ; and on the 1st of Novem W, notwithstanding gallant efforts by Captain Christie and Lieuten ant Lindsay, two British officers employed with the Persian army, to retrieve the day, 'Abbas Mirza's force was broken up and scattered. The Prince then made the best of his way to Tabriz, saving only 2 out ^13 guns. Captain Christie was left wounded on the field and was theie put to death under the orders of the Russian commander (who ad been erroneously informed that no British officer would take part n ^ ie war on ^he side of the Persians), perhaps because he refused to surrender, but possibly with even slighter justification. 128 a1876 1813. Treaty of Gulistan, 24th (12th) October, 1813. Perso- Russian War of 1826—28. Both sides remained in arms for a year after the battle of Aslanduz, and Lankuran was taken by the Russians at the beginning of 1813, but upon the Aras the Russian arms made no progress. It must be remembered that during a part of these campaigns Russia was weighed down by serious difficulties in Europe, and especially by Napo- leon^s invasion in 1812-13, but for which the Russian advance in Transcaucasia would doubtless have been more rapid and more decisive. At length, on the 24th (12th) of October 1813, peace was concluded between Russia and Persia at Gulistan, a place in Karabagh. Russia declined/to agree to the appearance of the British Ambassador in Persia as a mediator between the parties, but his good offices were accepted and utilised. The Treaty of Gulistan established a frontier, on a basis described as the status quo ad praesentem, by which the bulk of Georgia,—including Karabagh, but excluding Erivan and Nakhshi- van,—was provisionally assigned to Russia ; but the tinal adjustment of the boundary was left to be made by a joint Commission, to whom power was even reserved of altering the proposed division of the country in case it should be found not to correspond with the facts of previous possession. No attempt at all was made to define the course of the new frontier in the district of Talish, adjoining the Caspian Sea; and the difficulty there was thrown entirely on the future Commis sioners. An exclusive right of keeping ships of war in the Caspian Sea was conferred on Russia; and Russia on her part undertook to support the prince whom the Shah might nominate, as heir to the Persian throne, against any faction that might dispute his right. An intention of interchanging Ambassadors was expressed; the appoint ment of Consuls or trade agents by the one power at places in the territory of the other was authorised; and the import and export duties leviable in Persia upon Russian merchandise were limited to a simple 5 per cent., only once chargeable. The Treaty of Gulistan was probably not regarded by either of the parties as a final settlement between them; and the Shah, after an interval, sent an Envoy to St. Petersburg to request Russia to give up a part of the territories which she had obtained under it. In return General Yermolofd, the Russian Governor-General of Georgia Ambassador to Persia, visited Tehran; but, so far from his being authorised to make any concessions, he had instructions to press a variety of new demands of an alarming character upon the Persian Court, Nothing, consequently, followed from this exchange of missions; and when the Commissioners for demarcation of the frontier at length met;1877 the result as might have been foreseen from the provisional and in definite nature of the Treaty of Gulistan, was to open a boundary- dispute. Three or four tracts were claimed by both parties, the prin cipal of these being the Gokcheh district situated between the lake of the same name and Erivan. In the summer of 1825 an effort was made to dispose of the Gokcheh question by agreement; and, when this failed, the Russians settled the doubt in their own favour by occupying the district with troops. In consequence of this act, and of the un favourable treatment of Muhammadans in the Transcaucasian districts obtained by Eussia in the last war, an extraordinary frenzy, which under ecclesiastical guidance assumed a religious character, suddenly took possession of the Persian nation; and the Shah found himself obliged by the unanimous demand of his subjects to insist, contrary to his own better judgment, upon the evacuation of Gokcheh by the Russians. At this point the Tsar Alexander died and was succeeded by his brother Nicholas, who sent Prince Menschikoff to discuss the situation at Tehran; but in the matter of Gokcheh neither side would yield, and on the departure of the Russian Envoy hostilities began. Great enthusiasm for the war against ' the infidelsprevailed through- 1826. out Persia, and volunteers from all parts of the country poured by thousands into the camp of ^Abbas Mirza, Crown Prince of Persia, who bad been appointed to conduct the campaign. The Russians seem to have been unprepared for the storm which thus suddenly broke upon them ; and in about three weeks the Persians had expelled them from Talish and recovered Gokcheh and the other disputed tracts. Everywhere the Muhammadan inhabitants of the country rose against the Russians; i' and at Ganjeh, besides massacring the Russian garrison, they extermi- &amp; nated their Armenian fellow-citizens. A Persian raiding column It penetrated almost to Tiflis; and at the end of this first stage of the war Shisheh was the only advanced Russian post which had not been either evacuated or overpowered. Soon, however, the Russians resumed the offensive, Muhammad Mirza, son of 'Abbas Mirza and afterwards Shah of Persia, was defeated near Ganjeh and narrowly escaped being taken prisoner; Ganjeh itself was recovered by the Russians; and in, September 1826 a crushing calamity overtook the arms of the Crown Prince in the vicinity of Ganjeh. An envoy was then despatched by the Shah to i is to propose a pacific settlement; but the Russians did not desire P® ace j and they now began to demand the cession of Erivan and akhshivan, hitherto recognised by them as Persian.1878 1827. Treaty of Turkman- chai, 21st February 1828. In the spring of 1827 the military operations, which had been suspended for a time, were renewed; but the efforts of the Persians, from this time onwards, were crippled by the extraordinary and short sighted parsimony of Fat-h ^Ali Shah. General Paskevitch, who had now replaced General Yermoloff, took the field in person, and in April his troops had secured Echmiazin. Erivan was invested by the Russians from the 8th of May to the 1st of July, but without success. On the 31st of July the important Persian stronghold of Mahmudabad on the Aras fell by treachery ; but a part of the garrison, consisting of Bakhtiyaris, escaped from the place without surrendering. On the 29tli of August the Russians sustained a defeat near Echmiazin ; but, quickly recovering themselves, they advanced again and drove the Persians across the Aras. At the end of September the Persian post of Sardarabad was abandoned ; and Erivan, left isolated by the loss of this place and of ''Abbasabad, was again besieged by the Russians. The Shah now completely withdrew his financial support from the Crown Prince, and two great catastrophes to Persia almost immediately terminated the war. Erivan surrendered on the 13th of October 1827; and almost simultaneously Tabriz, the capital of Azarbaijan, situated at a considerable distance within the Persian frontier, was occupied by the Russians. The submission of Persia had now become inevitable ; hut the negotiations for peace were protracted from November 1827 to February 1828 by the obstinacy with which the Shah resisted the demand of the victors for a pecuniary indemnity. At last, on the 21st of February 1828, peace was concluded at the village of Turkmanchai between General Paskevitch and ^Abbas Mirza, acting as plenipotentiaries for their respective sovereigns. Under the Treaty which they arranged; all the country to the north of the Aras River, as well as the fortress of 'Abbasabad and the districts of Talish and Mughan to the south of it, became Russian territory, Persia being thus finally deprived of Erivan and Nakhshivan. The war indemnity payable by Persia to Russia was fixed at five million Tumans or * thirty million silver roubles. The condition regarding the exclusive right of Russia to maintain war vessels in the Caspian Sea, embodied in the Treaty of Gulistan, was re-affirmed ; and an undertaking was given by Russia to recognise, both immediately and in the future, the right of Abbas Mirza to succeed Fat-h 'Ali Shah. In one clause of the Treaty the permanent residence of an Am bassador from either sovereign at the tnilli ft ACCDr w ,ie t)Bge 240) the Russian equivalent was W&amp;f ii roubles. Five million Tumans was equal at this time to about £3,500 ,000.1879 Court of the other was distinctly contemplated ; and a stipulation was likewise inserted for the mutual reception of Consuls. A commercial Treaty, attached to the political Treaty, limited the duties on Russian trade as before to five per cent., besides which it conferred on Russian subjects the right to acquire house property and business premises in Persia, along with inviolability of domicile. The instalments by which tile war indemnity should be discharged were regulated, and the ceremonies to be observed in the reception of Russian Ambassadors and other diplomatic officials in Persia were fixed, by separate protocols in connection with the main Treaty. The Treaty of Turkmanchai did not at once remove all difficulties Perso- between Persia and Russia. In August 1828, in consequence of a pro- vision of the Treaty by which, if an instalment of the war indemnity 1828—34. remained unpaid after a certain date, Azarbaijan was to be detached from Persia and either handed over to Russia or constituted a separate Khanate, Persia^ through the improvidence of the Shah and his ministers all but forfeited that valuable province. Again in February 1829^ through the murder of M. Grebaiodoff, the Russian Minister at Tehran, and his suite by ah infuriated mob which some of his demands, founded upon the Treaty, had roused to action &gt; a very dangerous crisis was produced ; but Khusrau Mirza, a son of the heir apparent, who was deputed to St. Petersburg as the Shah's representative, was able not only to secure the condonement of this outrage on very moderate terms as to reparation, but even to obtain the remission of oue-tenth of the whole war indemnity. After this event the ascendency of Russia at the Persian Court was for a time almost undisputed, and the foreign policy of Persia, especially upon her north-eastern frontier, began to be influenced by the designs and interests of Russia. Relations of France with Persia, 1797—1834. It was however by France, rather than by Russia, that Persia was Early Coin- first brought upon the stage of European international politics ; and to mumoations the diplomacy of that country, as directed by Napoleon, we must now with Persia turn our attention. 1801—04. The Bruguiere-Olivier mission from the French Directory, which visited Tehran in 1796 and marked the commencement of French interest iu Persian affairs, had no practical outcome ; and the first advances of1880 Napoleon to Persia were similarly resultless. The time, the medium ; and the nature of these first advances are subject to some doubt ; owing to discrepancy between the accounts given by various authorities ; and this much only appears certain; that they were made through an Asiatic who had some difficulty, if he did not altogetherJfail, in establishing his character as a French emissary to the satisfaction of the Persian Government. Further communications were made to the Persian Court by French political agents in Syria and Turkish ^Iraq; and in tlie autumn of 1804 a properly authenticated proposal for joint action against the Russians was transmitted by the Government of France to that of Persia. It was, however, virtually ignored by the Shah, who was at the time in expectation of receiving substantial help against Russia from Great Britain, and who, as France and Russia were then at peace, probably doubted the good faith of the offer. The next step taken by Napoleon^ war having in the meanwhile begun between France and Russia, was of a more decided character J it consisted in the deputation to Tehran of Colonel Romieu, who was furnished with proper credentials^ and the accompaniments of whose mis sion were such as to ensure for him a proper degree of attention. His instructions were to suggest that Persia should relinquish her alliance with Britain and substitute for it one with France, who would in return send a minister to reside at Tehran, grant a subsidy for the military operations against Russia, and even send troops to assist the Persian army in Georgia, Colonel Romieu arrived at the Persian capital in the summer of 1805, met with a somewhat frigid reception, and shortly afterwards died at the Persian capital; but his single interview with the Shah seems * The author of the mauusciipt from which Brydges' Dynasty of the Kajars is translated says (pages 274— 5) that a French letter, which the Persians cotild not understand, was delivered to a Persian emissary at Baghdad, apparently in 1801, k an individual who represented himself to be an AmhaBsador from the French Govern' ment, but whom the Persian Government decided to treat as an impostor. According to Watson {History of Persia, page 152) the first declared French emissary was an Armeman merchant who came from Baghdad to Tehran in 1801, but who, on account of the unintelligibility of his credentials, of his own appearance, and of that of his following, failed to obtain the confidence of the Persian Court. Ka^linson {England and Russia in tliQ East, p^ge 15, footnote) makes the bearer of the earliest letter 8 'a certain Shahrokh Khan, who had travelled to Paris on his private affairs, and had met with much attention from the French authorities he gives the date a# 1802, and he seems to indicate, as does also Kaye {History of the War in Afghanistan, Volume I, page 45) that th« overtures of which he was the medium were regarded as genuine, bub were repelled. - Rawlinson adds, however, that reason was after- wards found for suspecting that these letters to the Persian Government emanated froni irresponsible French intriguers in Syria, etc.1881 korilietJ »tn : jm® to have had some effect upon the royal mind, in which a doubt as to the availability of British support against Russia had by this time arisen. The negotiations begun by Colonel Eomieu were continued by M. Jaubert, who reached Tehran in May 1806, having been seized on his way and for some time imprisoned by the Pasha of Bayazid, whose Government, the Porte, were at this time in alliance with Russia against Franoe. The new French Envoy found Fat-h 'Ali Shah, who had renounced all hope of active assistance by the British, fully disposed to accede to his proposals. Indeed that monarch had lately, since the death of Colonel Romieu, caused an application for help to be made to France on his behalf through the French Ambassador at Constantinople, and had even despatched a letter to Napoleon by the medium of * M, Outrey, a Frenchman. The result of M. Jaubert's mission to Persia, which was' of short duration, was the despatch of a return mission to France. The individual selected to accompany M. Jaubert to Europe was Mirza Muhammad Riza, the principal adviser of the Shah's eldest son Muhammad J Ali Mirza; and, his movements being more rapid than those of M. Outrey, who had preceded him, he overtook that gentleman at Constantinople. By his instructions he was empowered to conclude an alliance on equal terms between Persia and France, directed against Eussia ; and he was authorised to hold out a hope that the Shah would join with Napoleon in operations on the side of Afghanistan, and that he might eventually cede him a port or some other place in the province of Fars from which the French could act against British India. The result was a ftreaty of alliance, in the sense desired by the Persians, which wasratifiedby Napoleon at Finkinstein on the 10th May 1807 ; and aubert was at once sent back to Persia to announce its terms. .• tllese arrangements been completed, when Napoleon found meitobhged to reconsider and revise them; for, with the establishment j J!Tj e T. lty between himself and the Tsar Alexander at Tilsit in , ' ac n ^ France against Russia in the interests of Persia o e possible.

Mission of General Gar- danne to Persia, 1807—09.im lie entertained in the East, to a partnership in which he had now admitted the Tsar, was anxious to preserve an understanding with Persia; and he * therefore sent General Gardanne to the Shah to endeavour to readjust matters on a basis of mediation—instead of armed intervention— by France iii the Georgian question. With General Gardanne there returned to Persia Mirza Muhammad Riza, bringing the treaty, already as good as superseded, which had been arranged through himself. The suite o£ the French Envoy consisted of 24 persons. He was received with mucli distinction by the Shah, who conferred on him a new Persian order and the honorary title of Khan; and soon afterwards a Persian represent ative in the person of one Askar Khan, Afshar, took his departure for Europe as bearer of letters and presents for Napoleon. The exact time of the arrival of the Gardanne mission in Persia cannot be ascertained, nor do we know the nature of the work i* with which it was at first occu' pied there. According to one authority a Franco-Persian treaty was arranged by which, among other matters, the island of Kharag J was ceded to France; and there is reason to believe that efforts were made to induce the Shah to prepare for joining in a FYench demonstration ^ So Eawlinson {England and Russia m page 17), who seems to have made the most thorough study of the question; but from Watson's account [Risio^ of Persia, pages 158—159), in which he possibly follows native Persian authorities (see for example Brydges' Dynasty of the Kajars, pages 332—379), it would appear that General Gardanne arrived in Persia before the pacification of Tilsit and that te (M not distinctly announce any desire on the part of his master to depart from the Tin* kinstein conditions* fKaye (Misiory of the War in Afghanistan, Volume I, page 50) who pla ces the strength of General Gardaune 's European staff at about 70 persons, states that some of them visited Bashehr, Bandar 'Abbas, and other places in the Gulf and ma surveys of harbours ; but the present writer has met with nothing in the Persian Gulf records corroborative of this absertion, and the authority of Morier ( Joun^) page 30) seems opposed to it, as he indicates that the Shah prevented the Irene from visiting Boshehr and even Shiraz. J Morier in his Journey, page 394. The same author makes the following remaA referring to an earlier period, which is not confirmed, so far as the present writer is aware, by information from any other source: ' By a treaty signed at Paris, an negotiated by M. Pyrault at Bassora, Kerim Khan, the Eegent of Persia, engaged P cede Kharrack ; but the suppression of the French East India Company intervene, and the object Was neglected.' A Commercial Treaty, to be cegutiated at Tehran, mentioned in the Treaty of Finkinstein ; and Ihetext of such a Treaty, purporting 0 have been drawn up in December 1807 and to be signed by General Gardanne and two Persian Ministers, is given by Mr. J. Talboys Wheeler in his Memorandum on Persian Affairs, 1871, Appendix II. Under it Kharag was to have been ma over to the French on the rendition of Georgia and other provinces to Persia by K uSB ^ This fact goes far to explain the extraordinary solicitude about Kharag shown ; General Malcolm and the Government of India in 1808.m against India in the following year. But the war' between Persia and Russia forced the question of Georgia into prominence, and in that connec tion the French Envoy was unable to afford the Shah any real satisfaction. When General Godoviteh, in 1808, advanced to besiege Erivan, General Gfardanne gave the Shah a guarantee that the Russians would not com mence hostilities unprovoked, proceeded himself to the head-quarters of the Crown Prince at Khoi, and despatched his assistant M. Lajarre to remonstrate with the Russian Commander ; but these measures did not avert the attack threatened by the Russians, and the credit of the French at Tehran declined thereafter in a marked degree. When the British mission under Sir Harford Jones, of which the function was to counteract the proceedings of General Gardanne, arrived at Isfahan at the beginning of February 1809 on its way to the capital, the f'reaoh Envoy entered a protest against its reception ; but the reaction of the Persian Government against French influence was now far advanced, the French protest was disregarded, and after the middle of March General Gardanne retired from Persia by way of Tabriz. His assistant, M. Lajarre, lingered for a time at Tiflis • and M. Jouannin, the Secretary of the Mission, clung pertinaciously to Tehran until Sir H, Jones was able to procure his dismissal to Azarbaijan, whence, seeing no advantage in remaining there, he proceeded to Constantinople. General Gardanne's failure may have been due in part to the ' precipitancy, parsimony and hauteur ' with which he is charged by his British opponent; at the principal reason was, no doubt, the impracticability of the French po icy in Persia, which, while it threatened to embroil the Shah with e Govemment of India, afforded him no effectual protection against tne encroachments of Russia. This did not however save General ardanne, if a Persian narrative may be trusted, from the displeasure o apo eon, on hie unexpected reappearance in Europe.

General political relations of Britain with Persia, 1797—1834. We are now in a position to trace, with some appreciation of its meaning, the general policy of Britain in Persia during the reign of Fat-h 'Ali Shah. The leading motive of that policy was, at first, fear of an invasion of Upper India by the Afghans under Zaman Shah, with whose proceedings, it was thought^ some of the Muhammadan states of India might associate themselves. These apprehensions soon gave place to a dread of Napoleon's designs in the East by which British diplomacy was aroused to put forth some considerable efforts in Persia. Later, when the danger from France had also passed away, it became the principal task of the British representative at Tehran to counteract, so far as possible, the growing activity and influence of Bussi^. Anglo-Persian questions arising specifically out of affairs m the Persian Gulf were in no case of first-rate importance : they will be dealt with separately in a later section of this Chapter. Mission of At the beginning of September 1798 the first British emissary to Khan 1 ^to C0lirt ; Ali shah left Bombay; this was * Mehdi 'Ali Khan, Persia and a Persian gentleman of Khurasani extraction, but domiciled in India, m 1 ent aPPOln as who had been selected for the duty by Mr. Jonathan Duncan, Governor Britisli 0 f Bombay. The mission was afterwards described as ' a temporary Biishehr, deputation to the Court of Persia under the instructions of the Governor- 1798. Generalbut the Envoy, at his departure from India, was appointed substantive British Eesident at Bushehr. The chief political objects of Mehdi 'Ali Khan's journey were, first, to induce the ruler of Persia to keep Zaman Shah in play upon the western border of Afghanistan, by which means he would be prevented from descending upon the plains of India ; and, second, to make arrangements for the exclusion of French influence from Persia. In connection with the former of these purposes an expenditure of two to three lakhs of rupees annually at the discretion of Mehdi 'Ali Khan seems to have been sanctioned, or at least contem plated, by the Government of India. In his capacity as British Besiden^ * M ehdi 'Ali Khan enjojed the full confidence of Mr. Dnncan, under whom he served in some capacity at Ghazipur; but in the Deccan scandalous stories to b is disadvantage were current. See Kaye's Life of Sir J. Malcolm, Volume \ &gt; P^ e 114—5, footnote.r f07: 1885 at Bushehr^ the Envoy was further expected to increase the East India Company 's sale of European goods in Persia, and to obtain better prices for their imports than had of late prevailed. Mehdi 'Ali Khan began his work at Masqat, where, as is related in another place, Jie obtained from the Sultan of 'Oman a concession for the establishment of a British Factory at Bandar 'Abbas; but the Govern ment of Bombay did not advise the Government of India to take immediate advantage of the grant, unless for the purpose of forestal ling the French, who were suspected of desiring to set up a station there. Mehdi 'AH Khan also mentioned the possibility of establishing a British settlement on Kharag; but, on account of the constant disturbances between the Shaikh of Bushehr and other claimants, he did not recom mend the project. On the 3rd of October 1798 Mehdi 'Ali Khan received charge of the Bushehr Kesidency from Mr. Hankey Smith, by whom it was held at his arrival; but that gentleman absolutely declined ' to deliver the British flag to the will of a Musulman ' unless under a positive command from the Government of Bombay; and he advanced a number of reasons for his refusal, some of which were not wanting in cogency. The Govern ment of Bombay, however, took a severe view of Mr. Smith's behaviour, cast some reflections upon his sanity, and ordered him to make the flag over at once to Mehdi 'Ali Khan, who was to hoist it with some degree of ceremony in the presence of as many British officers as could be assembled, but not of Mr. Hankey Smith. Mehdi 'Ali Khan, after this, opened a correspondence with the Shah's ministers; but he thought it well to disguise the chief objects of his mission, and he therefore substituted a letter of his own for that from the Governor of Bombay which he had brought with him, and gave out that he had been sent merely to convey to Fat-h 'Ali Shah the condolences of the British upon his uncle's death and their congratulations upon his own accession. The Shah had already determined upon undertaking hostilities against his neighbour, the ruler of Afghanistan; and the British representative accordingly, though he expressed his personal approval as a pious Shi'ah, and even suggested that the claims of Mahmud to Herat would provide a specious ground of action, avoided all mention of his employers' anxiety for something to be done against Zaman Shah,—an anxiety which, if it had been allowed to appear, would certainly have involved them in expense. In July 1799 Fat-h 'Ali Shah was at Mashhad, actively threatening the iVfghan border, and Mehdi Ah Khan had reached Shiraz, where he met with a highly honorific Mehdi 'Ali Khan's sug gestions in regard to Bandar 'Ab bas and Kha- rasr.

On the 4th of December 1799 Mehdi ^Ali Khan arrived at Tehran, whither the Shah had meanwhile returned from Khurasan; and became the guest of Haji Ibrahim, at this time still the principal minister. In three audiences which he had of the Shah, within as many weeks of Ms arrival, the Khan was successful in despatching the political business of his mission entirely to his own satisfaction. In particular he secured that orders should be issued ' to all the seaports of Persia to be watchful and to seize on whoseover of the depraved French may make their appearance by sea or land, under whatever disguise, that they may not escape with life.'' The cost of the Envoy^s proceedings at Tehran has been estimated at two and-a-half lakhs of rupees. One item of Fs. 17,000 for the equipment of the Afghan claimants Mahmud and Feroz-ud-Din seems to have been regarded with suspicion or disapproval by the Government of India, by whom it was not passed until several years after. About this time Mehdi ^Ali Khan must have become aware of his own approaching supersession as British Envoy to the Persian Court by Captain John Malcolm, whose mission will shortly claim our attention; for letters informing him of the intentions of the Government of India had been despatched from Bombay in the preceding September. In these he was ordered by the Government of Bombay to place himself, in his capacity as Resident, entirely at his successor's disposal; and various services which he might render Captain Malcolm were explained. Mehdi 'Ali Khan would not have been human had he not represented to his superiors the hardship of being thus superseded in the height of his success ; but he bowed with a good grace to their decision. He seems to have returned to the Gulf via Baghdad and Basrah, and his meeting with Captain Malcolm took place at Bushehr on the 3rd of May 1800. The last political matter of importance in which Mehdi ; Ali Khan figured as a principal was a scheme, suggested by him at the beginning of August 1800, for the seizure of Masqat by the British under cover of a lease granted by the Shah of Persia, such as he reported Mniself able at any time to obtain. This proposal, which was professedly at the French, was apparently not taken into serious consideration hy the British authorities. Mehdi 'Ali Khan continued to hold the Residency of Bushehr until his retirement from the East Indian Company's service in April 1803.1887 ministe,: tteymj; iings at 1 s- One it® ts Mahii on or iapj ssed until g The Mission to Persia of Captain Johrx Malcolm ; Assistant British Resident at Haidarabad in the Deccan, appears to have been resolved on by Lord Mornington, Governor-General of India, abont the beginning of August 1799. Its scope, as understood by Captain Malcolm himself, was 'to relieve India from the annual alarm of Zamaun Shah's 'invasion, which is always attended with serious expense to the Company, 'by occasioning a diversion upon his Persian provinces; to counteract f ( tte possible attempts of those villainous but active democrats, the 'French }i ) and 'to restore to some part of its former prosperity a trade which has been in a great degree lost.' There was there fore no essential difference between the objects of this Mission and those which Mehdi ''Ali Khan had been sent to achieve in the previous year; but it enjoyed a higher prestige, as proceeding from the Governor-General of India instead of the Government of Bombay, and it; was equipped on a more magnificent scale. Captain Malcolm's staff included six European otlicers, of whom three were Political Assistants \ the military escort consisted of nearly a hundred native Indian troops, partly cavalry and partly infantry; and there were, in addition to these, a host of Indian servants and followers. On arrival in Persia a large number of Persian attendants were added to the strength of the Mission, which came in the end to amount to not less than 500 persons. Captain Malcolm, with his party, left India in the u Bombay ^ and 'Harrington' on the 29th of December 1799, and on the 1st of February 1800 he arrived at Bushehr, whence he at once addressed letters to tlie Persian Court. Ceremonial and other difficulties retarded his progress towards the capital, and he did not reach Shiraz till the middle of June, noi Isfahan until late in October. Captain Malcolm had his first audience of the Shah at Tehran on the 16th of November 1800 ; and from that date until his departure, at the end of January 1801, negotiations were in active progress. Captain Malcolm left Persia by the route of Hamadan; he crossed into Turkish territory on the 15th of March 1 80} • he halted again at Bushehr on his way to India from tne 22nd to t e 24th of April; and he finally arrived at Bombay on the 13th of ay, having encountered a dangerous gale after leaving Masqat. ^ time of Captain Malcolm's entry into Tehran the power of the ^ ^ 0r m ^ sc ^ e ^ on side of India was already, through —peration of various causes, pr actically at an end ; and there were Mr R ^ a l ) ^ a ^ n ^' Campbell, First Assistant; Lieutenant C.

The British nvoy therefore at first devoted, or appeared to devote, most of his atten tion to the conclusion of a Commercial Treaty, and left it to the Persians to press,—which they did not fail to do,—for the formation of poli tical engagements. In the commercial Treaty, however, Captain Malcolm would have inserted a clause conferring possession of the islands of Qishm, Hanjam and Kharag upon the British, with rights of occupation and fortification ; but this condition was strenuously opposed by tlie Shah and his ministers from a belief that the British power in India had sprung from similar grants, and ultimately it was eliminated from the discussions. The Political Treaty, as finally signed on the 28th of January 1801, bore that amity should be maintained between Britain and Persia; that, if the ruler of Afghanistan were ever to show an intention of invading India, the Shah should ky waste his dominions, and that, in any treaty of peace which the Shah might make with him, a stipulation should be inserted for the abandonment by the Afghans of all designs upon British territory; that, in event of the Afghans or the Frencli making war upon Persia, the British should supply the Persians with guns and military stores ; that, if a French force should attempt to effect a lodgment upon any Persian coast or island; a joint Anglo -Persian expedition should be organised to expel them; and finally that, if the French were to apply for leave to establish a settlement in any such position, their request should be refused by Persia. The provisions of the Commercial Treaty, signed on the same date, were that the merchants of each of the contracting powers were to enjoy security and official protection in the territories of the other ; that British and Indian merchants ' in the service of the EngH^ Government ^ (i.e., probably, in the employment of the East India Company) should be free to settle at all places in Persia ; that no duties should be levied upon goods which were bond fide the property of either Government, but that the usual duties might, if such goods were be realised from the purchasers ; that in either country the merci of the other should be entitled, on certain conditions, to official in obtaining payment of debts and redress of injuries ; that the British representatives in Persia should be at liberty to employ as many Persian subjects as their affairs might require^ and to punish them in event of mis conduct, but without injury to life or limb; that the British sli oul(1 be free to build residences for themselves in all the ports and cities o- Persia, and to sell or rent the same at their pleasure; that aid should b e(fcnr ersia. 4| !r j ^ a ptaia| the isj^ [ y opposed It ■sH power mi t was eliij ^ of Janmi' Britain ail ft w an iol links, anil iihinijasti' lans or 1 Id attempt toi oint AifWij tlementiif o-ued on if ; 7106 of ttc I of tie jrsia;tiiat M | propat/ 1 '' L goods antrjtlie^ ;o official 0' fis: lem in^l ■ theB* bat ^ 1889 given, in territory of either power, to vessels under the flag of the other entering its harbours in a damaged condition, and that, in case of ghipwreck, property lost should be restored—so far as possible—to the owners, who should be bound to pay proper salvage; that European and Indian employes of the British Government, if desirous of leaving Persia, should be allowed to do so at any time and to remove their property w ith them; and that the duty to be recovered by the Persian Govern ment from purchasers of the East India Company^ iron, steel, lead, broad -cloth and perpets should not exceed one per cent, ad valorem, while the customs tariffs of both countries were to remain otherwise unaltered, and other questions relating to commerce were to be settled at another opportunity. These were the tangible results of the employment of seven European officers during a period of nearly a year and-a-half, and of an enormous expenditure, forming an inconvenient precedent for the future, in presents to the ministers and leading men of Persia. In view of 'the fact that the treaty provisions relating to Afghanistan were from the first unnecessary and that those referring to France did not avail to prevent French intrigues in Persia, while those bearing on commerce were mostly of a commonplace and non-controversial character, the outcome must be accounted meagre; but a favourable opinion of the wealth, if not of the power, of Britain, and of the intelligence and character of British officers, had been diffused throughout Persia, in its length and breadth, by the proceedings of the jVIission. The two Treaties arranged by Captain Malcolm had been signed by him and by Haji Ibrahim, the Prime Minister of Persia ; and the Shah, as a token of bis acceptance, had caused a Earman requiring his officials to observe its terms to be attached to each. It remained to arrange for a corresponding ratification by the Governor-General of India; and for tbis purpose, and for that of disposing of the points connected with trade which remained unsettled, Fat-h ^Ali hah undertook to send a return mission to India. In selecting a representative his choice fel? upon one of the principal merchants of Bushehr, Haji Khalil by name, w bo was ambitious of figuring as an envoy, who had taken g ome part in the negotiations at Tehran, and against whose nomination Captain Malcolm had nothing to sav. The terms of Haji KhaliFs e ®ployment seem to have been, simply, that his deputation to India This Haji Khalil was partner in a large shipping concern with Messrs. S. Manesty ■ ■ Jones of Basrah and a Portagaeie merchant of CaWtta. 129 Results of (Captain) Malcolm's first Mission to Persia.

A frigate-of-war was detailed by the Govern ment of Bombay to convey the Persian Envoy from Bushehr to India; but before its arrival he had chartered on his own account, for Es. 3/300. a native vessel of which Mehdi ^Ali Khan, the British Resident, was part- owner. This vessel Haji Khalil detained for about seven months without paying demurrage to the proprietors, who had expected him to discharge it iniabout 40 days ; and the East India Company's ship also was kept by him idle at Bushehr for nearly four months. In the end he made the voyage in the chartered vessel, escorted by the Company's frigate. From the 3rd to the 7th of May 1802^ the Persian Envoy was at Masqat, where he was received by Captain Seton, and on the 'Zlst of that month he arrived at Bombay. Mr. Duncan, the Governor, was then absent in the interior, and Haji Khalil was received in his absence bj Mr. Carnac, the member of the Government next in seniority. The Mihmandar, or official entertainer appointed on the part of the Governor- General, seems to have been Mr. Hankey Smith, formerly Resident at Bushehr. While arrangements were being made for the Envoy's onward journey to Calcutta, he tarried at Bombay. On the 20th of July, a few days after the death of Mr. Carnac and before the return of Mr. Duncan, an unfortunate disturbance arose between some Persians of the Envoy's suite and a guard of honour, composed of Hindu sepoys, which had been furnished by the Government of Bombay. Shots were exchanged, Haji Khalil Khan, on going out of his house to put a stop to the fray, was struck by a stray bullet in the neck and fell dead. Three or four other persons also received gunshot wounds. This untoward event caused unusual sensation in India, both on the spot and at Calcutta; and Captain Malcolm, who was now Private Secretary to the Governor-General, was sent in haste to Bombay to take suitable measures. In the discharge of this task he seems to have writ ten letters of regret and explanation to the , Shah and his Ministers, to have made an inventory of the deceased Envoy's public and private eff ects, to have advised the immediate payment of gratuities and alms by the Government of India to the amount of about a lakh of rupees, and to have recommended the grant of family pensions aggregating Rs. 46 ,000 a year. The Haji ; s body was sent to Najaf for interment, attended as('07^) 1891 omW' jtoW far as Baghdad by Mr. Day^ a civil servant of fhe Bombay establish- meut; but by some tbe escort of a Christian seems to have been regarded as an insult,* rather than as an honour, to the corpse upon its last journey. When the news of the tragedy first reached Bushehr, a version of it by which the whole of the blame was made to rest upon the ill-fated Haji himself was invented and communicated to the Persian Court by Melidi'Ali Khan^ the British Resident; but the chief consequence of this fiction seems to have been the compulsory retirement of its author upon a pension at the recommendation of Captain Malcolm. So unusual an incident as the violent death of an ambassador naturally caused astonishment at Tehran, and extreme advice is said to have been offered to tlie Shah by a youthful member of his family, but in the end the matter was passed over by the Persian Government with complete indifference. Mr, Lovett, the successor of Mehdi 'Ali Khan in the Bushehr Resi- Self-assumed mission or dency, fell ill not long* after his arrival in Persia; and in February 180^, Mr. Manesty without obtaining the orders of Government, he made over charge of his ^04 appointment to Mr. Manesty, the British Resident at Basrah. Mr. Manesty, who had reasons of his own for entering into this arrangement, almost immediately set out for Tehran, representing himself as an Envoy from the Governor-General of India to the Shah. On arrival at the Persian Court he met with a cordial reception ; and he was able to obtain a Farman for the settlement of two cases of the plunder of wrecked British ships which had occurred in the Persian Gulf; but, the first Perso-Russian war having now actually begun or being upon the point of breaking out, he soon found himself pressed by the Persians with questions and demands to which he was not in a position to return any answer. Mean while the Governor-General, who had become aware of Mr. Manesty^s proceedings, peremptorily ordered him to return to Basrah; and so ended Ms unauthorised venture. The Governor-General in the first instance directed that payment of some bills which Mr. Manesty had presumed to draw upon the Government of India in the character of envoy should be refused; but afterwards, partly out of consideration for Mr. Manesty's 1 ^ i fcee an amusing note in Brydges' Mission (No. VIT, pages ix—x) regarding the l P opinion of Sukiman Pasha of Baghdad, from which the following is an extract:— ndalffl' Hajee KKeleel lived an infidel, and with infidels, and therefore, was destined to hell: jpees, &gt;■ was 'however, murdered by infidels and so became a shahyde (martyr), this gave ■H him a chance of paradise ; but his former friends have robbed him of this ohanoe by an infidel to attend bis corpse to the grave j his fa^a therefore is now fixed, you may carry him to the devil in any manner you like best.'' 129 a.1892 Muhammad Nabi Khan's Mission to India, 1806- or. personal safety and partly lest the public credit should be affected, this order was rescinded, and it was arranged instead to hold Mr. Manesty personally responsible for the expenditure that he had improperly curred. in- The negotiations interrupted by the untimely death of Haji Khalil Khan in 1802 were not resumed until 1805, when* Agha Muhammad Nabi a wealthy and respectable merchant and a close connection in various ways of the deceased Envoy, was appointed by the Shah to be his successor. The principal motive of the Persian monarch in taking this step was to obtain protection against the Russians, of whose vengeance, in consequence of the treacherous murder of General Zizianoff by the Persian commandant of Baku he now stood in dread; but he may also have been moved by the solicitations and bribes of the Agha himself who for personal reasons was anxious to obtain the appointment, and who, being a man of substance, was willing to take it on the same easy terms to the Persian Government as Haji Khalil had previously accepted. Muhammad Nabi, it appears, hoped to be able to cover the expenses of his mission, and even to obtain a profit, through the liberalityt of the British Government,—an inordinate idea of which had been implanted in the Persian mind by the profuseness of Captain Malcolm,--and through the privilege of free export and import or goods which, as an Envoy, he was entitled by precedent to enjoy in India. It would seem that he also intended to press a supplementary claim for blood money, *Muhammad Nabi was the son by Agha Kuchik, once a leading merchant at Bushehr, of a Persian lady, originally a Parseeby religion, who had been the mistress of Mr. Douglas, formerly British Agent at Bandar 'Abbas. A daughter of Mr. Douglas by the same lady was educated in England, made a good marriage there, having succeeded to her father s property, partly supported for a time the widow and family of Agha KQchik, whom he had left at his death in poor circumstances. A sister of Muhammad Nabi was married to Haji Khalil, the first Persian Envoy to India ; and after Haji Khalil Khan's dea^h, a Turkish widow of his at Basrah heccame the wife of Agha Muhammad Nabi. Muhammad Nabi's start in life was made in 1787, when he became Persian instructor to Mr. H. Jones at Basrah on a salary of Bs. 30 a month, Haji Khalil, by whom this was^arranged, at the same time appointing lim his commeicial agent there ; and by 1795 Agha Muhammad Nabi had become one of the chief merchants of the place. In 1799 he was described as attached to ( Va probably, devoted to the interests of) the British Factory at Basrah, and assisted Mr. Manesty m turning back a mission which Tipu Sultan of Mysore had sent to the Porte. t He once suggested that his horses at Bombay should be shod with gold and silver# 1 the expense of Government and that the shoes should be loosely attached so as to fc' oft and be scrambed for hy the crowd (Brydges' Mission, page 38)1893 amounting to twenty lakhs of rupees^ on account of the death of the late Haji Khalil Khan. Or. Jukes ; a good Persian scholar^ was apppointed to accom- pany Muhammad Nabi Khan on his mission to India. It had been mad Nabi intended that the Envoy should travel by sea the whole way to Calcutta; 1800 ' but, bad weather having obliged his vessel to seek shelter'at Bombay^ he landed there on the 18th October 1805. He was received with much ceremony and handsomely feted by the Bombay Government, whose guest he remained for more than a month, afterwards proceeding by land to his destination at Calcutta. The Government of India, however, presided over by Sir George Failure of Barlow, were at this time occupied with internal affairs and retrench- Nabi Khan's ment of expenditure, and they were accordingly content to refer all Mission- questions of British policy in Persia to His Majesty^s Government at borne. His Majesty^s Government could come to no decision on the ract| subject of Persia and Russia, and the consequence was that in January 1807 Muhammad Nabi Khan returned to Persia without having achieved a single political result. Even the Treaties arranged by Captain Malcolm in Persia remained unratified by the Governor-General of India. The outcome of the Envoy's private speculations was probably ^fortunate; |||J but his pecuniary claims on the Indian Government were scouted mb ^ authorities, whose per contra calculations even brought out a debit balance against him of more than a lakh of rupees. The unfavourable issue of Muhammad Nabi Khan^s negotiations in India was quickly reflected in the attitude of the Shah, whose first attempted overtures to Napoleon through M. Outrey were made about the time that he must have become aware of the ill-success of his repre* tentative at Calcutta. Fat-h ''Ali Shah, in deputing Muhammad Nabi Khan to India, had simultaneously opened a correspondence with Hie Majesty's ministers in London ; but from these also he failed to obtain a satisfactory reply, or possibly any reply at all. -At the beginning of 1807 the intimacy between Persia and France, Mission of exemplified in the missions of Colonel Romieu, Mirza Muhammad fo p^gj^ 1163 ftiza, and M.

The means which they decided to adopt was a mission fro no the British sovereign to the Shah of Persia, the expense of which, however, was to be borne by the East India Company; and the person chosen to conduct it, in the capacity of Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary, was Mr. Harford Jones, a civil servant of the Company, who had been attached to the Basrah Factory from 1784 to 1795, had visited Shiraz in a private capacity in 1787 and 1791, had held the post of Eesident at Baghdad from 1798 to 1806, and, on his way to Europe in 1806, had placed his services at the disposal of the British Ambassador at Constantinople in connection with the passage through the Turkish capital of a Persian embassy to France, presumably that of Mirza Muhammad Hiza. It was at first intended that Mr. Jones should proceed to Persia via St. Petersburg, where he would endea vour to procure the acceptance of British mediation by Russia in her frontier difficulties with Persia j but the pacification of Tilsit, by bringing France and Russia together, frustrated this part of the scheme. In August 1807 a baronetcy * was conferred on the Envoy elect: and on the 27th of October he left Portsmouth for Bombay in H.M.S. ' Sapphire/' The principal members of bis staff were Major Lewis Smith, Public Secretary, and Mr. James Morier, Private Secretary. Sir Harford Joneses voyage round the Cape was a prolonged one, and he did not reach Bombay until the 26th April 1808. The Government of India, no less than Hib Majesty's Government, were convinced of the necessity of asserting British influence in Persia in opposition to that of France; and Lord Minto, who was aware of the intended deputation of Sir Harford Jones to Persia, but who could not tell when or by what route that gentleman might be expected to arrive on the scene, thought it advisable to send Malcolm once more to the Gulf, with the rank of Brigadier-General, to report on the situation in Persia, to devise measures for the exclusion of the French from that country, and even to make a reconnaissance for the despatch of expedition on a small scalewhich might subsequently be required to prevent the French from establishing themselves upon the Persian coast. Thet Envoy was invested with ' general powers of control over all » According to Sir Harford Jones himself this honour was a reward for his past di^tyasTrSlnTo^ ^ ^ * Wa8 bestowed » order to increase 1* P + Hia full style was, it would seem, Plenipotentiary and Political Agent in » ' IZrlf 0 ^ the 1Ja f 0f ^ F i eU . ?. on ' ble tlw Govern or»G«neiS oflndia, »' '' Bagdad. ^ Lordship to the King o£ Persia and the PaclM*1895 the British interests and concerns in Persia and Turkish Arabia , the local servants of the Company being thus placed under his orders ; and he was furnished with credentials for presentation^ in case they should be required, to the Shah of Persia and the Pasha of Baghdad. He was specially instructed to refute^ should an opportunity of so doing present itself; an argument which had been adopted by the Government of Persia^ that the Anglo-Persian treaty of 1801 was in effect one of offensive -defensive alliance against all other powers^ and that it had been violated by Britain when she failed to afford support to Persia against Kussia. Elaborate directions were added as to the manner in which General Malcolm should comport himself towards Sir H. Jones, if they should chance to encounter one another in the Persian field. The gist of these was that the representative of the Governor-General must, as Envoy to the Persian Court, give place to the representative of the King; but that, in his general capacity as an agent of the Government of India, he might take part in the proceedings, especially by affording advice. General Malcolm sailed from Bombay in the Psyche'^, a French prize, on the 17th of April 1808, only a few days before the arrival there of Sir H. Jones. The other vessels employed on the Mission were the 'Doris', frigate, and the East India Company's ship 'Wexford' and it was intended that some line-of-battle ships should follow at an interval of about a month. The Envoy^s principal assistant was Captain C. Pasley, a relative of his own^ who had accompanied him on his First Mission and had passed; since then^ about four years in Persia* The escort, properly so called, consisted of 100 native Indian cavalry and 50 sepoys; but 300 men of H. MVs S4th Regiment were embarked as marines; and a detail of European artillery with two light guns was to be sent with the ships of the Boyal Navy. General Malcolm arrived at Bushehr on the 10th of May; and on the 12 th he landed and was met at the beach by the Shaikh, who conducted him to a house and there entertained him. The Envoy was accompanied on this ceremonial occasion by a guard of 50 men of the 84th Regiment, these being the first European troops ever landed at Bushehr. A few days later Captain Pasley left for Tehran with a letter containing; it would seem; strong remonstrances on the subject of the relations of the Persian Court with * ra nce; but the bearer Was prevented from proceeding beyond Shiraz, of li| and it was intimated to General Malcolm that he must transact his with the Prince-Governor of Ears. Surprised and indignant at1896 sucb treatmentj the British Envoy haughtily re-embarked on the 12tli of June and declined to land again until this order was withdrawn; but it was not withdrawn^ and on the 12th of July he sailed for Calcutta, Immediately before his departure he visited the island of Kharagand formed an estimate of its resources and value. Captain Pasley remained behind at Bushehr as Acting Envoy, with Lieutenant W. Bruce as his assistant; but at the middle of August, apparently from fear of an attempt by the Persians to seize him and his staff, he withdrew to Basrah, leaving Mr. Bruce in charge at Bushehr as Acting Resident. The explanation of the rebuff sustained by General Malcolm, on his Second Mission to Persia is not far to seek ; for General Gardanne was by this time with the Shah, and had for the moment persuaded him that his only safety from Russia lay in a close union with France. The failure may have been due, in part also, to the impatience and abruptness of the British Envoy when he found himself confronted by difficulties. Voyage of On receiving news of General Malcolm's intention of returning to to 1 Persia 0 aiid ^ nc ^ a J the Governor-General * authorised or requested Sir Harford his earlj pro« Jones, who had meanwhile been waiting at Bombay, to proceed on his there, ^ep- mission to Persia ; and on the 12th September the King's Envoy sailed to^amiary 8 H. M/s 36-gun frigate 'Mereide', accompanied by H.M.S. 1809. a Sapphire ^ and the East India Company's tiny schooner a Sylph of 78 tons. The ' Nereide^ reached Bushehr on the 14th of October, and on the next day ^Abdur Rasul, the local Shaikh, came on board to pay his respects, and Sir H. Jones and his staff landed, The ' Sylph ^ had parted company with the ' Nereide' at the beginning of the voyage; and on the arrival at Bushehr on the 29th of October of the Company's cruiser ' Nautilus/' which had been attacked on her way up the Gulf by some Qasimi pirates, serious fears for her safety began to be entertained. As related in another place, the 'Sylph' had in fact been temporarily captured by the QawSsim, but had been imnie- diately recovered and carried to Masqat by the ' Nereide,' which came upon the scene most opportunely in the course of her return voyage to India. The Persian secretary, who was the only member of the Mission staff on board the ' Sylph/' had escaped with his life | and on the 26tli October he rejoined the Envoy at Bushehr. *SirH. Jones bad-voluntarily consented to await in India-the result of General Malcolm's Mission. Whether he was subject to the authority of the Governor- General or not is doubtful; see on the one hand his own statement in Bridges' pages liB and 201, and on the other a remark by Rawlinson in England and in ihe Easti page 23.1897 The staff o£ the Mission, as reconstituted after the landing at Bushehr, consisted of Mr. Morier, in whom the appointments of Public and Private Secretary were now combined, Major Smith having been left behind in India; Mr. T. H. Sheridan, of the Bombay civil establishment; Lieute nant W. Bruce, who had remained at Bushehr after the departure of Captain Pasley, and as Acting Resident had received Sir B. J ones on his arrival; Captain J. Sutherland, of the Bombay military establishment. Surveyor to the Mission; Cornet H. Willock, of the Madras Cavalry, commanding the escort,* - which consisted of the Indian detachments pro vided for Gene7al Malcolm ; and Dr. Jukes, Surgeon. Circumstances, at the time of Sir H. Joneses landing in Persia, were partly propitious and partly unpropitious. On the one hand the Persian Court had begun to distrust the Prench, their connection with whom had brought them no advantage in the shape of a settlement with Eussia, and to hope for better results from a friendship with Britain ; but on the other hand they were under apprehension of hostilities by the Government of India, whose representative had recently quitted Persia in displeasure. The attitude assumed towards Sir H. Jones by various local officials was at first unsatisfactory, but the Envoy was not without influential personal friends in the country, and with the lapse of time the prospect gradually improved. On the 17th of December, Sir Harford started from Bushehr on his journey to the interior ; and on the 30th of the same month he entered Shiraz. On the way he had accidentally met with Muhammad Nabi Khan, formerly Persian Envoy to India, an old acquaintance of his own; but this individual, instead of helping him, attempted to pry into the nature of his instructions and even pressed on him a corrupt bargain for providing additional presents to distribute at Tehran. On the 1st of January 1809, Sir H. Jones was well received by Hasan 'Ali Mirza, the Prince-Governor of Pars ; and though an endeavour was made j to induce him to open his negotiations at Shiraz, as General Malcolm | f; had been required to do, it was not persisted in. On the 5th of January, however, while still halted at Shiraz, the British Envoy suddenly found himself placed in a very difficult predica ment by a despatch from Lord Minto, in which he was informed that the occupation of the Persian island of Kharag by a force from India had ^en resolved on, as a measure of precaution, and in which he was himself directed to withdraw from Persia.1898 Scheme of The origin of these orders may be explained in a few words. ment GOVer of General Malcolm reached Calcutta about the 20th of August 1808, and India for the the result of his meeting with Lord Minto was that the latter wrote to Kh5rag) 0n 0 Sir H. Jones at Bombay on the 22nd, desiring him to suspend his depar- August 1808 ture for Persia. During the week that followed, a scheme for the occupa- to February 1809. tion of the island of Kharag in the Persian Gult was propounded by the returned Envoy; and on the 29th of October it was adopted by the Governor-General in Council, who decided that General Malcolm should be sent at once to carry it into effect, Sir Harford J ones being meanwhile detained for a further period at Bombay. The object of the proposed seizure, for it cannot be otherwise described, was to obtain a conveniently situated and secure base for military, political, and commercial purposes, the possession of which would secure the supremacy of British influence over that of other European countries in the Middle East and, by the constant menace which it held out to the Governments of Persia and Turkish ''Iraq, would deter the Shah and the Pasha of Baghdad from dalliance with the European enemies of Britain. On the 30th of September, however, it became known at the head quarters of the Indian Government that Sir H. Jones had left Bombay one day before the arrival there of Lord Minto's letter of the ^nd August; and General Malcolm, who had just embarked for Bombay; was temporarily recalled to Calcutta. Deliberations then took place which ended in a decision by the Governor-General in Council to proceed with the Kharag scheme, and to inform Sir H. Jones that he must forthwith retire from Persia, else the whole of his proceedings in that country would be repudiated by the Government of India. The result was the despatch opened by Sir Harford at Shiraz, which reached Bushehr, as it happened, only two days after his departure from that place. General Malcolm^ in whose hands the political control and the military command of the Kharag expedition were to be combined; arrived at Bombay on the 30th November 18U8; and on the 3rd of January 1809 he contemplated being ready to leave for Kharag in ^ days' time ' with an admirably well-appointed little force of about men .... to be followed, if it is found necessary^ by three or f our thousand more/'' But meanwhile news Was received from Europe of the difficulties which Napoleon was encountering in Spain j and this led Lord Minto to regard the danger from the French in Persia as less immediate^ and consequently the necessity for the occupation of Kharag as less urgent;(/o5^ )» foil Further pro ceedings o£ Sir H. Jores in Persia, to 1809. to they had hitherto been considered by himself and his advisers. In consequence^ at the end of January or beginning of February 1809, General Malcolm was informed that the idea of a military expedition to Kharag had been abandoned, partly on the ground of expense; and that; if any steps should afterwards be taken for acquiring the island, thej would most probably be of a purely pacific and political kind. Sir Harford Jones, on becoming aware of the intention of the Gov ernment of India to take possession of Kharag, made it his object to persuade the Persians, who had also received intelligence of the project from m , some quarter or another, not to oppose the British expedition by force ; and; by undertaking full ^ personal responsibility for any unprovoked aggressions which General Malcolm might commit in defiance of Ms objections, he induced the Prince-Governor of Shiraz to promise that that officer and the troops which he brought with him should be well received on arrival in Persia, while the questions to which their advent gave rise were reserved for diplomatic settlement. On the 12th of January the Envoy refused to purchase India goods to the value of £14,000 which the shameless and indefatigable Persian ex- Envoy, Muhammad Nabi Khan, at this point again endeavoured to force on him, through an agent, as presents for the Persian Court; and on the following day he left for Isfahan. Dr. Jukes, whose place as surgeon with the Mission was taken a few days later by Dr, W, Campbell^ was apparently sent back from Shiraz ; indeed it would seem that he and Mr. Bruce, though the latter eventually accompanied the Mission to Tehran, were sympathisers with General Malcolm and did not work cordially with Sir Harford Jones. On the 1st February the Mission entered Isfahan • and on the 6th, while they were halted at that place, a letter arrived from General Malcolm, dated the 29th December, in which he announced his intention of sailing for Kbarag in about twenty days. To this communication Sir H. Jones replied announcing the favourable progress of his affairs, requiring General Malcolm to abstain from hostilities against Persia and from intrigues with the Chiefs of Dashtistan, to which the Shah was particularly sensitive, and informing him that he would meet with a friendly reception ^ Kharag. About the same time it came to the knowledge of the Envoy at many families of the Lak tribe, which was connected with the ai1 S; had been expelled from Shiraz for no other reason than that _!^^coW was expected to bring with him from Bombay a Zand *k7 ~ even went through the form of signing a with life and fortune. bond by which he made himself1900 pretender to the crown of Persia, apparently a son of Ja'far Khan. With the help of the Persian authorities, whom the fear of operations in the Gulf may possibly have rendered more complaisant, Sir Harford now expedited his journey towards Tehran to the utmost. H e arrived there on the 14th of February, a week after leaving Isfahan and two days after the departure of General Gardanne. On the 17th of February he had an audience of the Shah, and on the 12th of March a Preliminarj Treaty between Britain and Persia was signed. The principal representa- tive of the Shah in the negotiations was his Prime Minister, Mitza Muhammad Shafr'. ^anp'r^ 1 ' 7116 new Treat ^ was expressly described as Preliminary; and the con- T^at* 17 tractin ^ in its first and second articles, bound themselves to substi- 12th Marcli £or ^ a ^ er a definitive Treaty^ on the same principles, to 1809. regulate matters in detail. The chief provisions of the Preliminary Treaty had lefeience to European relations. The Shah^ on his part, declared invalid all the treaties which he had hitherto formed with European powers^ and engaged not to permit the passage of any European force through his dominions in the direction of India. On the part of His Britannic Majesty it was undertaken that, in case Persia should be invaded by a European force, Britain should assist the Shah^s Govern ment with troops, or in lieu thereof with a subsidy, warlike stores, and individual officers, the amounts and numbers of these to be determined in the Definitive Treaty. If Britain were at peace with the invading power she should use her good offices to arrange matters between that power and Persia j but, if she failed in this, her obligation to render active assistance to Persia should come into force. These European clauses though expressed in a general form, were aimed at French interference in Persia, and by their acceptance the principal object of Sir H. Jones's mission was undeniably realised. The Treaty, however, also referred to Afghan affairs. In regard to these it was arranged that Britain should not intervene in a war between Persia and Afghanistan, unless by way of mediation at tbe request of both parties; but that, if the Afghans should attack tbe British dominions in India, the Shah should take military action against them m a manner to be determined by the Definitive Treaty. With reference to the Kharag scheme it was agreed that, if British troops from India had been landed at any Persian port, their presence there should be regarded as provisional, subject to the good pleasure of the Shah ; and not as establishing rights of possession ; and that ; if tne1901 ^ persian Government should afterwards assent to their remaining at the 1 | a ce where they were, they should be treated in a friendly manner and ^ Sir| jedby the local Persian officials to obtain supplies. ^ In conclusion it was explicitly laid down that the objects of the ^Nj p re |i m i n ary Treaty were defensive, and that, during its continuance, 'WfeJ should not enter into any engagement prejudicial to the government or to the British Government in India. !l Palrepij girH. Jones lost no time in informing the Government of India of d success, which was completed by the departure of MM. Jouannin and Nerciat, the last of the French agents, from Persia about the end of April 1809. That he carried all his points with little difficulty was due to the urgent need in which Persia stood of help against Eussia, to the ascertained worthlessness for this purpose of the French alliance &gt; to the indefatigable and sanguine temperament of the Envoy himself, and , to some extent, to the fear^of a British occupation of Kharag. y; anil btosj princiffe with I Great embarrassment was caused to Sir H. Jones by the action of the f Government of India, who ordered bills on Bengal to the amount of 165,000, drawn by him in the public service, to be protested,—a Persia ski proceeding which only came to his knowledge on the 23rd of April; but, e SMHi through the confidence reposed in him by native Persian financiers^ he dike m was enabled to surmount the difficulty thus created, which at to bete: an earlier stage of the proceedings whoud certainly have been fatal to his leinvafc On the Tth of May 1809 the Preliminary Treaty was sent to London rencb for ratification under the care of Mr. Morier ; Secretary of the Mission, svho was accompanied on his journey by Mirza Abul Hasan, a Persian enca * It geems ^ p resen t writer probable, though it is not suggested by any of the of Sir Hi- au ^orities, that the G overnmept of India unconsciously strengthened the hands of 1 Sir H. Jones, by their military preparations at Bombay, of which the Persians gome- how became aware. In view especially of the bond for restraining Malcolm, executed Jairs, I 11 ^ Jones, the Persians may not unnaturally have supposed that the two, through jrvene a ^ ai ' en % rivals, were really acting in collusion. v tSirH. Jones's disregard of the authority which they claimed to exercise over him 111 was no doubt the cause of this final act of repudiation by the Government of India ; lOiilu a I hut the Envoy had also been represented to them, probably by Dr. Jukes and Lieute- ry action?' nan t Bruce, if not by General Malcolm himself, as an undignified and even unprincipled eat/- ^ erSOr ^ 0me expedients were eccentric, but they appear to have been J c ^ rcums tance8. Among such was his idea of causing the King's ^h to be conveyed in a magnificently draped and escorted litter, which rt tl#j Jv J ^ serve d a useful purpose so long as there was a doubt of the authority under ' H J H ^ Wa8 ac ^ D S* -^ ll t the effect was rather marred by the necessity which Sir goo P ai ' or was under, during a several days' illness, of himself sharing the litter with the , u m Emissive.1902 Envoy to the British Court, charged with the duty of ascertaining through whom the subsidy guaranteed to Persia in certain circumstances would be paid. The Persian Envoy was a nephew, on his mother's side, of the late Prime Minister Haji Ibrahim, whose son-in-law also he was; he had been governor of Shushtar during his relative's tenure of power; he had visited Makkah ; and he had resided for more than two years in India, at Calcutta and elsewhere. The Government of India, on becoming aware of the facts, decided that the Treaty negotiated by Sir H. Jones at Trhran must be accepted and executed, in so far as this depended on themselves, without regard to the agency—unworthy in their opinion—by which it had been obtained. Among the considerations that weighed most strongly with Lord Minto were the virtual expulsion of the French representative and his suite from Persia, the recall of the Persian Envoy (Askar Khan) from Paris, and other circumstances tending to a rupture between France and Persia,- a danger to which the Shah, but for his reliance upon British aid, would probably not have exposed himself. It was also the opinion of the Governor-General that a British representative must in f uture be stationed at the Persian Court to pay the subsidy promised, if it should become exigible, and to see that the obligations imposed on Persia by the Preliminary Treaty were properly fulfilled ; and, in his correspond ence with the authorities at home, he recommended that this representative should be an officer appointed by the Government of India. For the double purpose, in the first instance, of demonstrating his acceptance of the treaty and rehabilitating the prestige of the Government of India in Persia, wbicb he conceived to have been lowered by the conduct of Sir H. Jones, but probably also with an eye to future permanent arrangements, Lord Minto now despatched General Malcolm on a third mission to Persia. A collateral object of the Mission was to collect topographical and other information regarding Persia and certain of the countries adjoin ing it,—a field formerly neglected, but one to which Captain Sutherland of Sir H. Jones's mission had begun to devote attention; and, partlyj 0 facilitate this work of exploration and enquiry, but partly also to enhance the dignity of the Governor-GeneraPs representative, a considerable number of young and energetic officers were attached to General Malcolm's staff. Two of these. Captain Christie and Ensign H. Pottinger, started before the rest of the Mission and, travelling by land bom India across the intervening countries, did not join it in P ersia until it was on the eve of its return. The other members of1903 fj ic * staff were Captain Pasley ; the Secretary^ who had accompanied General Malcolm on both former occasions; Lieutenant Stewart^ First ^ssigtantj Mr. H. Ellis. SecondJAssistant; Dr. A. Jukes, Third Assistant; Lieutenants Brigg ^s, J. Macdonald of the Madras Infantry, and Little, Supernumerary Assistants; Surgeons Colhoun ( ? Colquhoun) and Cormiek ; Captain N. P. Grant, commanding the escort; Lieutenants Frederick^ Martin, H. Lindsay of the Madras Artillery, Johnson and Fotheringham, attached to the same ; and Ensign W. Monteith of the Madras Engineers. The military escort consisted this time of two native officers and 24 non-commissioned officers and men of the Madras Horse Artillery ; of three non-commissioned officers, one trumpeter and ten privates of H. M. 17 th Light Dragoons; and of two non-commis sioned officers, two musicians, and 40 sepoys of the Bombay establish ment. At the end of the winter of 1809-10 a despatch was received by Sir H. Jones from the Government of India, in which he was requested to relinquish his functions in Persia in favour of Dr. Jukes, who had been placed by them in provisional charge of British interests at Tehran, pending the arrival there of General Malcolm; but Sir Harford did not consider it necessary or proper to comply with the desire of the Governor-General, especially as he had already submitted his resignation to His Majesty^s ministers by the medium of Mr. Morier and was in expectation of their orders. General Malcolm left Bombay on the 10th January 1810 in the &lt;^ Psyche/ , with which sailed the a James Sibbald^ and other vessels ; and on the 14th of February he landed at Bushehr. Here he remained until a letter from the Shah should arrive, making a favourable reception at Tehran certain, and not until this condition had been fulfilled did lie start on the journey up country. Leaving Bushehr on the 15th of April, he arrived at Shiraz on the 27th, where he paused until the 16th of May. During this halt he received news of the murder, on the confines of Turkish ^Iraq, of Captain Grant and Lieutenant 1 otheringham, whom he had sent round by Baghdad. Lieutenant Macdonald and Ensign Monteith, whom he had ordered to travel Chiistie, as we have seen elsewhere, was afterwards killed with the Persian anny fighting against the Russians, while Grant and. Fotheringham lost their lives ^ ai 3 in the course of the Mission, as will be related further on ; but, of the remainder, ' 1 ^ ei and Ellis (1777-1856) attained to distinction in distant lands, ^ ac onald and Lindsay to prominence in Persia, while several of the others rose ^ SOme ^ m P or t ance in India, These facts testify to the judgment with Malcolm selected his ' family1904 towards him from Basrah, rejoined him in safety at Shiraz. General Malcolm reached the Shah's summer camp at Sultamyeh, 50 miles to the west of Qazvm, on the 21st of June; and two days later lie had his first audience of the Shah. As he and Sir Harford Jones ; though they exchanged visits and otherwise treated each other with becoming courtesy, could not agree as to the manner in which tliey should appear together in the royal presence, the King's Envoy absented himself upon this occasion. The duty of General Malcolm at the Persian Court seems to have consisted in the delivery of gifts and complimentary messages, and he was treated by Fat-h ^Ali Shah with much cordiality. Among the gifts t seems to have been included, in harmony with the spirit of the Preliminary Treaty not as yet ratified by Britain, two batteries of horse artillery guns, with harness complete, and 35,000 stand of small arms. But at the beginning of July, during a movement of the ShaVs camp from Sultaniyeh to the plain of U jan near Tabriz, Sir Harford J ones was able to inform General Malcolm of a decision by H is Majesty's Government to keep the appointment of the British representative at Tehran in their own hands, and of their choice of Sir Gore Ouseley to succeed Sir Harford himself, whose resignation they had accepted. This decision, reached after full consideration of Lord Minto's views, was a death-blow to General M alcolm^s prospects of permanent employ ment in Persia, and he at once made dispositions for returning to India, Before his departure he received from the Shah the titles of Khan and Sipahdar and was invested with the order of the Lion and the Sun, instituted in his honour. At the instance of Sir H. Jones, his relations with whom became more friendly towards the end of their association in Persia, he left Captain Christie, J Lieutenant Lindsay, Ensign ^ The evidence as to the nature of the disagreement is conflicting. One awkward circumstance was that Sir H. J ones had been accustomed to stand in the presence of the bbah, while General Malcolm at his former visit to the Persian Court ^ received a seat. The contrast in ceremonial matters between the two British Envoys was certainly to the disadvantage of Sir H. Jones, who had instituted a practice of making his presents in hard cash,—a system perfectly effectual but somewhat indecent. f See Brydges* Mission, page 364, and notes to the same, pa^e xxviii. Rawfr 1 ' son, however,—see his England and Russia in the East, page 26,— speaks of ' a limited supply of military stores t These were the first British officers lent to Persia ; and the idea may have been suggested, along with the clause in the Treaty referring to officers, by the action of General Gardanne's French Mission in Persia. But there is reason to think that, perhaps in imitation of Turkey, Persia had turned her attention to European milW arrangements and tactics even before 1807 (see Dt/ndsty of the Kajars, page 308)120 1905 Qfrjrj 5 fei Monteith and Mr. Surgeon Cormiok to be employed in Persia on the public service. On the 15th July General Malcolm had his final inter view with the Shah, after which he made his way via Tabriz to Baghdad, arriving there on the 20th September. At the end o£ October he left Basrah for India. The cost of this third and last Mission of General Malcolm to India ^as extravagant; and its political results, partly no doubt in consequence of its terminating otherwise than the authors had intended, were in^- commensurate with the expense, and even negligible. In fact General Malcolm's History of Persia, on which he was employed at Bombay during 1811, remains the most substantial of his later achievements in the Persian field; and next, in order of importance, should perhaps be ranked the detailed information regarding parts of Persia, Afghanistan, Baluchistan, etc., which was acquired through the labours of his official staff. We have been obliged, on account of the special interest of India in these affairs, to give a somewhat full account of them; but, apart from one more Treaty, the further proceedings of British representatives at the Persian Court during the reign of Fat-h ''Ali Shah need not detain us long. After the signature of the Preliminary Treaty Sir H. Jones was confidentially consulted by the Shah on various matters of foreign policy, especially in regard to Russian affairs; and a strong but naturally unsuccessful effort was made by the Persian Government to obtain, through him, the personal services of General Malcolm in the war against Russia. Sir H. Jones finally made over charge of his Mission archives to Mr. Sheridan and returned to Europe by way of Constantinople, travelling as far as that city in the company of a Turkish Ambassador whose visit to Persia he had been partially instrumental in bringing about. He was shipwrecked on the English coast in H.M.S. Pomone 3) on the 11th October 1811; and this unfortunate incident, though he survived until 1846, marked the close of his strenuous public career. Sir Gore Ouseley, Ambassador Extraordinary, to whom was confided tbe completion of the task begun by Sir Harford Jones, arrived at Tabriz ^^9th ^ November 181 1. With him there returned from England was . Sir 0usele y had some peculiar features. The Ambassador The vnv I y his wife, and his Private Secretary was his brother, Sir W. Ouseley. oc Cm J a ; e T? m , ^pithead to Bombay, which included a fortnight at Rio di Janeiro, PeSl 1810to tlie 12 th January 1811; and after landing in 1811* f . y of three months took place at Shiraz, from 7th April to 10th IkssiflTi« 0r P ure v domestic reasons. At this time, be it remembered, the to know whpfl P r ® ssm £ Persia hard, and the Shah was waiting with impatience a Morier of &gt;, ^ ^ ex pect active aid from the British.

Jones's Mission, and Mirza AM Hasan, the Persian Envoy to London; and he was accompanied by Majors D'Arcy and Stone of the Royal Artillery, who were destined for employment with the Persian army, The Ambassador's escort, consisting of 30 Indian cavalry under Lieutenant G. Willoct, wag taken on board at Bombay ; and at that port were also embarked some non-commissioned officers of His Majesty's 4t7th Regiment who had been chosen as drill-instructors for the Persian infantry. At the time of the voyage of the Mission up the Persian Gulf, piracy by the Qasimi tribe was still rife ; and some craft, evidently piratical, were pursued and fired on by the vessel in which the Ambassador travelled—H.M.S. ' Lion ' of 64 guns,—near Shaikh Shn'aib Island. The Definitive Treaty which the Ambassador was sent to conclude was signed on the 14th of March 1812 ; but, as it was never ratified bj the British sovereign and was shortly superseded by another, it is unnecessary here to quote its provisions. In the summer of 1812 there was correspondence between General de Etischelf, the Eussian Governor-General of Georgia, and the Britisli Ambassador; and the latter, in consequence of his good offices having been requested by the former, visited the camp of the Persian Crown Prince; but, though a meeting of Russian and Persian plenipotentiaries took place at Aslanduz on the Aras River, no basis for an accommodation could be found. At the end of October 1812, as we have already seen, the Russians inflicted a crushing defeat upon the Persian army, whicli Sir G. Ouseley had considered himself obliged by the friendly relations in Europe of Britain and Russia to deprive of its'^ British officers; and the informal mediation of the British Ambassador was then resumed. The ultimate result was the Treaty of Gulistan, arranged in 1813, between General de Rtischefl; and Mirza Abul Hasan. The matter of the Anglov Persian intended Treaty had been so greatly protracted that Persia derived no benefit in her first great war with Russia. In the summer of 1BH Sir G. Ouseley returned to England via Russia, leaving Mr. Morier to carry on the duties of British representative in Persia. Meanwhile the treaty arranged by Sir G. Ouseley had been under Persian Defi- examination in London; and, as it was found to be unsatisfactory in SSt^Novem- cer ^ n respects, Mr. H. Ellis, who had accompanied General Malcolm on ber 1814. — — * Except Captain Christie and Lieutenant Lindsay, neither of whom had come to Persia with him, and whom he virtually authorised, along with 13 British^ 1 instructors, to follow their own inclinations.1907 his third mission to Persia, was sent out from England, as a Minister Plenipotentiary, with fresh instructions. Mr. Ellis arrived near Erivan in August 1814 and proceeded with Mr. Morier, the Minister Plenipoten-. 1 fciaiy d interim, to Tehran, where, on the 25th of November, the ■'| Definitive Treaty with Persia, sometimes styled the Treaty of Tehran, 1 was adjusted by their joint exertions. This imporfant engagement, which with one important modification continued to regulate Anglo-Persian political relations for more than 40 years afterwards, consisted of eleven articles. By the first article the p ers j an Government declared all their alliances contracted with European nations in a state of hostility with Great Britain to be null and void; bound themselves not to allow any European army to enter Persian territory or to proceed thence, by land or sea, in the direction of India; and engaged not to suffer individuals belonging to European nations entertaining designs on India or at enmity with Britain to frequent Persia. By the same article the Shah of Persia undertook to use all the means at his disposal to indace the powers of Central Asia to prevent a European invasion of India by routes though their dominions. The second article established perpetual friendship between Britain and Persia, and bound the British sovereign to refrain from interference in domestic strife in Persia and to request the territorial integrity of the Persian kingdom, The third article defined the treaty as purely defensive in its nature, and preseribed as the boundary between Persia and Russia that which should be # accepted by the two countries and by Great Britain. The fourth article referred to the obligations imposed on Britain by the Preli minary Treaty of 1809 in case of an invasion of Persia by a European power, and fixed the amount of the subsidy to be paid by Britain to Persia, the assistance rendered take the form of a subsidy, at 200,000 ; it was added that the subsidy should not be payable if the war which led to the invasion of Persia had been provoked by aggres sive action on the part of Persia herself, also that proof must be afforded the subsidy being applied solely to the military purposes for which it was intended. The fifth article permitted the employment by the Persian Government of European officers for the training of their troops, provided tiiat such officers did not belong to nations at war or at enmity with Britain. I n event of a European power at peace with Britain making war on Persia, the British Government were to mediate; but, if mediation 0 f GUlistan, 1813, between Persia and Russia virtually left the frontier a ^le determination by Commissioners. 120 a1908 British re- failed^ the obligation by which they were bound to assist Persia either with a military force or with a subsidy was to remain binding on them. By the seventh article the British subsidy^ when payable, was to be paid ' in as early instalments as may be convenient.^ Under the eighth and ninth articles, if war were to break out betweeen Britain and Afghanistan, the Shah was to take action against the Afghans and receive a grant for his expenses from the British Government; whereas, in the event of war between Persia and Afghanistan, Britain was not to interfere, unless as a mediator at the request of both parties. The tenth article related to the expulsion and extradition of political offenders. Finally, by fche eleventh article, the British Government undertook, in very general terms, to assist the Shah in the Persian Gulf,if convenient and practicable/'with ships of war and troops; but their expenditure, in such a case, was to be reimbursed by the Persian Government; and it was added that their ships must anchor at such ports as were appointed by the Persian authorities and not, unless from absolute necessity, at any others. The bearing of the eleventh article, which was doubtless inserted at the request of the Persians, is not explained: it may have had reference to the general prevalence of piracy, to apprehended danger from the Wahhahis, to Persian designs on Bahrain, or to the difficulties which occasionally arose between the Shiraz Government and the semi-independent chiefs of the Persian littoral. The wording of the Definitive Treaty was general, resembling in this respect that of the Preliminary Treaty; but, in consequence of the change in the political situation, the new Treaty was as clearly directed against Russia as the older one had been against France. The ratification of this Treaty by the Prince Regent was brought from Europe by Mr. H. Willock, who arrived in Persia in September 1815 j and Mr. Morier finally left Persia in the following month. After the arrival of Sir Harford Jones in Persia in 1808 the interests lations with 0: £ Britain at the Persian Court were continuously watched by spe Persia, 1815 28. cial representatives of varying rank, who were generally appointed by His Majesty's Government and not by the Government of India. From to 1826 this function was discharged alternately by Mr. H. Willock an Major G. Willock, who had first come to Persia in command of the escorts respectively of Sir H. Jones and Sir G. Ouseley, with the title of Charge d^Affaires; and in 1826 Colonel J. Macdonald (Sir J. M. Kin 116 ^ who had been introduced to the country by General Malcolm on his ^ mission, was appointed Envoy Extraordinary by the Indian Governtt^ ^ to which the responsibility for supervising British interests in Per sia1909 reverted in 1823. During the period from 1815 to 18^6 much attention was given by the British diplomatic representatives to the improvement of the regular Persian army^ and numerous British officers were lent to the Shah for the purpose; but their endeavours, on account of the unsuitability of the material^ did not result in the creation of any efficient fighting force. The circumstances of Persians unsuccessful war with Eussia in 1826- Final modi- 28 led to an important modification of the Anglo-Persian Definitive ^he ^^ngkf Treaty of 1814. When hostilities began, the Persians claimed, under Persian Defi- that Treaty, the benefit of British assistance; but it was withheld ^tlT August on the ground that the war had been begun, not by the Russian 18^8. occupation of the disputed Gokcheh district, but by the attack made thereafter by the Persians upon the Russians. It was now recognised, however, that the Treaty, as it stood, was a dangerous entanglement for Great Britain; and, soon after the peace of Turkmanchai, advantage m taken of the difficulty which Persia found in raising the war indemnity payable to Russia to procure her assent, in return for a single payment of 200,000 Tumans, to the cancellation of the third and fourth articles,—those, namely, which obliged Great Britain to take cognisance of the boundary between Persia and Russia and to help the former country with men or money in case of a war of aggression upon her commenced by a European power. The two obnoxious articles were formally annulled upon the 24jth August 1828, British Officers in the Persian army, 1828-1834:, In 1828 Major Lindsay, afterwards Sir H. L. Bethune, and Major Hart, who commanded the Persian infantry and in whom the Shah reposed unlimited confidence, were still serving with the Persian army. In 1832-33, as a matter of favour, a large quantity of arms and accoutrements was supplied by the Government of India to the Shah without payment. In 1834 a complete staff of British officers and non commissioned officers was sent to Persia to reform the Persian army in ^ its branches : it included Colonel Passmore ; Colonel Sheil, afterwards ^ Sheilj and Colonel Rawlinson, afterwards Sir H. Rawlinson, both 0 f whom later represented Britain at the Court of Persia; Colonel F. Arrant, who was sent as a Special Commissioner to Karbala in 1843 and afterwards became British Charge d 7 Affaires at Tehran j Colonel Stoddart,1910 who was murdered at Bukhara in 1842 ; and Colonel D^Arcy Todd^ who took charge of the Persian artillery. Affairs of the Persian Coast and Islands, 1797-1834. Our narrative of events under the rule of Fat-h ^Ali Shah has borne, up to this point, little reference to the local affairs of the Persian Coast; but a detached account of the latter^ apart from the history of Persia as a whole^ would have been unintelligible and might have been misleading. The general view which we have taken enables us to treat the occurrences of the Persian Coast with a proper appreciation of their importance or unimportance. Two revolutions^ of which the nature is obscure^ took place at Bushehr during the year 1798. In April a force commanded by Husain Quli Khan, Governor of Fars, who was then in rebellion against his brother the Shah^ advanced against the town; and Shaikh Nasir, after some feeble dispositions for resistance, fled and was supplanted in the chiefship by his nephew Shaikh Ghanim, who seems to have been a partisan of Husain Quli Khan. About the middle of September Shaikh Nasir suddenly reappeared at Bushehr with an ''Atbi fleet, probably that of Bahrain_, and blockaded the port: on the way there he had re-established, with the help of the Utub, his authority over the island of Kharag. He was preceded at Bushehr by a land force, under a Persian officer and his own brother Muhammad^ which had beeii sent to co-operate with him. A five days' siege of Bushehr ensued during which the inhabitants were reduced to drinking ' water little better than the sea.■ ,, On the evening of the /JUth September a sortie was attempted by Shaikh Ghanim, who had shown considerable spirit in the defence of the place; butitfaM and the party making it were pursued up to the gates by the enemy, who entered the town along with them. Panic then seized the garrison, aiid Shaikh Ghanim, after a vain effort to rally his men, took flight. The successful paity continued plundering the town until daylight. The naval part of Shaikh Nasir's force in this affiair was commanded by a Shaikh named Salim, but whether this Shaikh belonged to the Busli elir family or was one of the chiefs of Bahrain is not clear. The success of Shaikh Nasir was ascribed to his a paternal influence/''1911 In 1799, as explained in the history of Bahrain, preparations were made for the reduction of those islands by the Government of Shiraz andthe Sultan of ; Oman conjointly; and the Shaikh of Bushehr took advantage of the alarm of the people of Bahrain to extort from them an admission of dependence upon Persia, together with an instalment of tribute on account Jof the year 1798. A Persian military force under the command of a brother of the Baiglarbaig of Fars was at this time encamped outside the walls of Bushehr, in readiness to proceed on service to Bahrain. The Sultan of 'Oman, who considered himself to have been tricked by the Persians, then visited Kharag, where, by giving out that Shaikh Nasir had again been superseded in his government by Shaikh Ghanim, he induced the inhabitants to make over the fort to him; having thus established a footing, he represented to the Baiglarbaig of Pars that he had found Kharag derelict and had occupied it to prevent its falling into the hands o£ the 'Utub ; and he offered to pay five years' revenue in advance for the island, if it were made over to him. How matters were settled with the Baiglarbaig is not stated &gt; but the Sultan shortly returned to Masqat ; and exactly a year later, in July 1799, Shaikh Nasir, under orders from the Government of ShTraz, crossed over from Bushehr with 10 vessels and 1,500 men and repossessed himself of Kharag. In 1802 Kharag was still subject to the Shaikh of Bushehr; but Daliki, which he had at one time held in farm, had been transferred to the jurisdiction of another authority. The revenue for which the Shaikh was responsible to the Government of Fars amounted to 4,000 Tumans a year (or rather more than the same number of pounds sterling), but he was obliged to pay in addition a still larger sum under the name of presents tothe Prince-Governor Operations by which in 1 805 Saiyid Badar of 'Oman recovered Bandar J Abbas with the assistance of the British Besident at Masqat are described in a later section dealing with British relations. On the 2nd January 1807 Shaikh IN asir II left Bushehr on a pilgrimage &gt; which it does not appear that he ever returned. At parture he entrusted the administration to his son.

Meanwhile Muhammad Nabi Khan^ who had been the Shah's Envoy to India in 1805-07, had been intriguing to obtain the Bushehr govern ment for himself; and it was at length conferred on him in consider ation of a payment of 40,000 Tumans. The pretext for the removal of Shaikh ; Abdur Rasul was his inability to discharge a debt of 28,000 Tumans, including interest, which he had incurred for the purpose of meeting a demand formerly made on him by the Prince-Governor of Fars: the person, even, from whom he was to borrow the money required had been indicated to him by the same authority. On the 26th October 1808 the Shaikh was treacherously arrested, or rather kidnapped, by Muhammad Khan an emissary sent from Shiraz, while both of them were on their way to visit Sir Harford Jones, the British Envoy, during his stay at Bushek These proceedings were covered by a Farman from the Prince-Governor of Fars, in which the emissary was strictly enjoined not to molest the British at Bushehr nor any of the native inhabitants of the place; and a re-assuring Farman was also addressed to Sir H. Jones personally, which Muhammad Khan, was directed to read aloud in his presence, Indeed the Persians went so far as to attribute the trouble in which Shaikh 'Abdur Rasul now found himself to some act of disrespect committed by him towards the recent Mission, headed by General Malcolm, from the Government of India. Great alarm and confusion, however, prevailed in the town and surrounding country; and numbers of villagers, with all their property, took asylum at the British Residency. Pending the arrival of Muhammad Nabi Khan the town was governed at first by Muhammad Khan, the Shiraz emissary, and then by Muhammad Ja'far a brother of Muhammad Nabi Khan; but so arbitrary was the mood of the Shiraz authorities, as represented by their emissary, that even Muhammad Ja'far himself was thrown into jail for a few days f or no other reason than that he had failed to prevent the escape by sea of the Wazir of the late Shaikh* Muhammad Nabi Khan, alarmed by the antipathy of the l oca population to the change, which was looked upon as the end of Arab and the beginning of Persian rule, would now willingly have resigned the Bushehr government, and was said to have offered 2,000 Tumans in for permission to do so. His public entry into Bushehr took place on ^ 19th December 1808, and his rule seems to have been inaugnra^ without opposition, and even with a good deal of flattery, on the pa^1913 new subjects. To his credit it should be mentioned that by personal intercession he saved the life, and even the sight, of his predecessor Shaikh ; Abdur Rasul. In 1809, after the middle of November, Muhammad Nabi Khan was suddenly called to Shiraz and made chief adviser to the Prince-Governor in place of Nasr Ullah Khanj whose disgrace on a charge of embezzle ment he himself had probably been instrumental in procuring ; and there after Agha Muhammad Ja^far seems to have acted as permanent Deputy- Governor of Bushehr. Under the rule of the Persian brothers the Dumukh Arab tribe^ who had been the principal supporters of Shaikh Nasir's familyj were almost extirpated ; and the Arabs of the Bushehr neigh bourhood generally were reduced to desperation by Persian tyranny. At length, apparently in 1811, Muhammad Nabi Khan was summoned to Tehran, where his son Muhammad Rahim Khan held an appointment at court. On arrival he was informed that the revenue of Fars was 70,000 Tumans in arrears. He was then violently bastinadoed along with another official, who was regarded as his accomplice in withholding payment, and had a narrow escape of being thrown from a high window under the personal directions of the Shah. His end is uncertain, but he does not appear ever to have regained the royal favour. He had the misfortune to be an enemy of the Qaim-Maqam, Mirza Buzurg, who was Arab in sympathy. We learn that in 1815, on a Farman of indemnity from the Shah, Shaikh Muhammad, a brother of Shaikh Nasir II, returned to Bushehr from Kharag, where he had been living with his dependents in voluntary exile. The records do not show the reason of Shaikh Muhammad^s previous exodus from Bushehr, now when it occurred, nor how it was regarded by Shaikh ''Abdur Rasul. In the summer and autumn of 1821 Bushehr and other places were visited by a severe epidemic of cholera; the road between Bushehr and Burazjan was strewn with corpses; and the British war frigate Liverpool^ lost 2 officers in 15 hours, beside the Surgeon and a great part of the crew. At Shiraz the disease carried off Mr. Rich and Dr. Jukes, as mentioned elsewhere. Early in 1823 one Zaki Khan from Shiraz arrived at Bandar 'Abbas jvith instructi ons relating to the lease of that port and its dependencies, * After his beating he was again invested with a robe of honour (see Morier's tcond Journey, page 95); but according to Brydges (see his Mission, page 46) he eventually suffered ' the complete ruin of his fortune, and the loss of his life in a T ery cruel and terrible manner.'

Attempt to oast the Sultan of Masqat from Bandar 'Abbas, 1823.1914 Hostilities between the Sultan of 'Oman and Shaikh 'Abdur Rasul of Bushehr, 1826-27. held by the Sultan of Masqat: an idea even prevailed that he had been sent to find a means of terminating the grant. Saiyid Sa'id, on receiving news of the presence of this official at Bandar 'Abbas^ proceeded with two ships to meet him there; and the upshot of their discussions was that the Snltan promised to pay 1,000 Tumans extra per annum for the two next years and made Zaki Khan a personal present of 500 Tumans. Before Saiyid Sa^id set sail for Masqat on his return journey, he was visited on board his ship by a certain Mirza Baqir, who brought with him Husain ^Ali Khan, Hakim of Bandar 'Abbas, and ^Ali Khan, Hakim of Minab, both of whom had lately expressed a preference for Persian rule, but wk) were now desirous of being reconciled to His Highness. In the event these two persons and their conductor, for a wbile at least, mysteriously disap peared j and it was stated that the boat carrying them had foundered in returning to the shore; but it was generally believed at the time that they had been carried off and consigned to a living death in the dungeons of Masqat* Bad feeling had for some time been growing up between the Sultan of ''Oman and Shaikh ^Abdur Rasul^ who seems to have resumed his position as hereditary Governor of Bushehr on the fall of Mumammad Nabi Khan; and in 1826, on the departure of the Shaikh upon a pilgri mage to Makkah, the Sultan commenced hostilities against hinL The cause of quarrel was some disservice which Shaikh'Abdur Rasul had done Saiyid Sa^id at Shiraz^ and efforts which he was suspected of making to supplant the Sultan in a proposed match with a daughter of the Prince-Governor of Shiraz. The Arabs of the Persian Coast from Qishm to Kangian were believed to be on the side of the Sultan, while the friendship of the Qawasim had been studiously cultivated for many years past by the Shaikh of Bushehr, and there was therefore a risk of the whole Gulf being plunged into war by a collision between the two. The first incident of the war was the capture by the ''Omanis, on her return from Bengal, of the Shaikh's ship a Nasrat Shah/' which was carried to Masqat, cleared of all articles belonging to the Shaikh person ally, and refitted as a man-of-war. On the 27th of July 1826 two ships and a brig from Masqat, accompanied by the Nasrat Shah/' entered Bushehr roadstead; and the commander of the squadron, Muhammad- bin-Sulaiman, informed the British Resident that he had orders to hand Over, on payment of the Bushehr customs to him, the goods on board the a Nasrat Shah ' consigned to merchants of the place, and to seize vessels belonging to Shaikh 'Abdur Rasul, but not otherwise to threaten the town or molest its trade. At the request of the British Resident,1915 liowever, he relinquished the demand for customs, which the merchants would otherwise certainly have had to pay twice over ; and the squadron ia the end left quietly for Basrah, where also there were demands of their master to be enforced . Shaikh 'Abdur Rasu) was at one time expected by the British authorities to travel home by way of Central Arabia, but Saiyid Sa'id had better information, and on the 13th September 1826, after a short action, lie captured the Shaikh and two of bis vessels at sea in the neighbourhood of Qishm. The government of Bushehr, on news of this occurrence being received, was seized by Shaikh Ahmad, an uncle of Shaikh 'Abdur Rasul, who was readily confirmed in his usurped authority by the Prince-Governor of Fars. The captive Shaikh Was not liberated until May 1827, when a bond for 80,000 German crowns was executed by him in favour of his captor. During the detention of Shaikh ^Abdur Kasul at Masqat serious Eevolution at disturbances occurred at Bushehr, due to rivalries among the members • BaS | t e ^ r ^ d of his family. When the administration of the port was assumed by the British Shaikh's uncle Ahmad, as already mentioned, the Shaikh's brother Husain and his son Nasir took refuge in the British Residency; and from that point of vantage, very improperly disregarding the obligations imposed on them by their privileged position as refugees, they began to intrigue secretly for the subversion of Shaikh Ahmad. At the end of January 1827 the Farman-Farma or Prince-Governor of Pars approached Bushehr; and Shaikh Ahmad, with a view to strengthening his position before the arrival of the royal visitor, required hostages, whom he proposed to send to the island from Kharag, from every tiibe under his jurisdiction. This unpopular demand supplied his com petitors with the opportunity that they needed. On the night of the 1st February the Shaikhs Husain and Nasir surprised and captured two towers of the fort which were held by Ahmad's most reliable adherents j and on the following day, assisted by the inhabitants of Bushehr generally and by a contingent of the ' Benifladgitribe from a neighbouring village, they besieged him in his house and compelled him to surrender. An agreement was then concluded between the parties through the mediation 0 Colonel Stannus, the British Resident, under which Shaikh Ahmad a dieated the government and bound himself to remain at the British esidency until news should have been received of the surrender of arag to the opposite party, after which he was to be supplied with the eans of quitting Bushehr by sea.1916 On February 3rd, after Ahmad had taken up his abode at the Resi- denoy ; a further discussion among 1 the principals was held at the house of Shaikh M.uhammad, another uncle of 'Abdur Rasul, Colonel Stanniis being present. A remark which fell from the Resident was badly received by Shaikh Husain, who rushed out of the house and began to raise his followers, by voice and gesture, to a proper pitch for executing any act of violence.' Colonel Stannus seems then to have returned to the Residency, against which a formidable demonstration was presently made by an armed rabble from the town. The place was surrounded by groups of men who hid themselves behind huts in the neighbourhood, parties were seen creeping along the roofs of houses to occupy command ing positions, and a large gun was brought up and planted within a hundred yards of the door. Patrols were stationed in the streets leading to the Residency, professedly for the purpose of preventing ammunition from being brought into it from the town ; and by these patrols water-jars were emptied, bundles opened, and the persons of Armenians and others who came near were searched. A Residency servant going out was stopped and robbed of some articles that he was carrying. Colonel Stannus, however, by writing twice to Shaikh Nasir, at length obtained a cessation of these threats and annoyances, and the next morning Shaikhs Nasir and Husain, who had meanwhile had leisure to reflect on the consequences possible of their behaviour, began to deny that violence had ever been contemplated, and to assert that their only object had been to prevent the escape of Shaikh Ahmad. They also had recourse to effusive protestations of respect for the British and of gratitude for the kind treatment which they had formerly experienced at the hands of the Resident. Soon after this the Farman-Farma arrived in person at Bushehr, but his presence did not improve matters, for he replied in offensive language to a representation made by Colonel Stannus in regard to the recent events and sought to throw the whole blame for what had occurred upon the Resident. At length, the Residency servants having been pre vented from carrying water and otherwise insulted on the public roads, the Resident retired from Bushehr to a village in the vicinity. At this juncture Colonel Stannus was relieved by Captain Wilson and the Prince-Governor wrote to the new Resident, promising satisfa 0 tion for the late insults to the British and the removal of Shaikh Husam from the administration; the Residency then appears to have been re established in the town ; and Ahmad, at his own request, was hande over by the Resident to the Farman-Farma. The Government o(fOl 1917 commended the ' decision^ temper and firmness 33 shown by Colonel Stanmis during the crisis, as also the judgment show by Captain Wilson in returning with the Eesidency to Bushehr, and in ignoring the improper language used by the Prince-Governor, accompanied as that had been by substantial concessions; and they did not even think it necessary to insist on the permanent exclusion of Shaikh Husain from the government, if he was the member of the family most capable of carry- ing on the administration in the absence of Shaikh 3 Abdur Rasul, and if there was no risk of the outrages against the Residency being renewed on his return to power. The pre -occupation of the Persian Government with the R ussian war in the north will account for their indifference to the conduct of the Sultan of ''Oman and the disturbed state of Bushehr in 1826-27. On his release in 1827 Shaikh 5 Abdur Rasul returned to power at Strained Bushehr, but about the end of the next year he was displaced by Timur tween T^mtir Mirza^ a son of the Prince-Governor of Shiraz. Timur Mirza at once ^^aiid called upon Saiyid Sa^id, the Sultan of ' Oman, whom his sister had married 'Abdur Rasul, in the previous year, to help him with one or two vessels ; and he sugges- ^ 8 28-31. ted that an immediate effort should be made to capture the u Harrieta ship belonging to the Shaikh. The ' Muzaffar/'' frigate, which was sent by Sa^id in response to these requests, fell in with the ' H arriet 33 off: Kangun, but instead of attacking her accompanied her peaceably into Bushehr harbour. This was at the beginning of January 1829. The commander of the Masqat vessel, on landing in Bushehr, found the Farman-Farma there and ' Abdul Rasul apparently in high favour with him; so, after remaining for a few days as guest of the Prince-Governors Vazir, he sailed again for home without committing any hostile act. In May 1830, the Shiraz Government having meanwhile reinstated the Shaikh of Bushehr and assigned to him Kazaran and all the districts be- tween it and the sea, tension was renewed, and the naval assistance of the Sultan of'Oman was again invited by Timur Mi'rza against ^ Abdur Rasul; but the British Resident was successful in persuading Saiyid Sa^id to abstain from interference. In the following year the Sultan was in correspondence with the Prince-Governor of Shiraz with a view to the removal of the Shaikh of Bushehr, partly by means of a naval force to be sent from Masqat; but effectual remonstrances were addressed to him by the Resident in the Persian Gulf and also by the Governor of Bombay, now Sir John Malcolm, with whom he was personally acquainted. Some claims of Sai} id Sa^id against the Shaikh of Bushehr had only recently been settled by a payment1918 Expulsion of Shaikh Nasir III from Bushehr by the Persian Gov ernment and interference of Shaikh Sultan bin- Saqar, Qasimi. 1832. Eevolution at Bushehr and expulsion of Riza Quli Mirza, 1833. of 20,000 Qrans, and, had he attacked him when he intended, he would have done so without moral justification. Towards the end of 1832 Shaikh Nasirlll, who had lately suc ceeded his father* Shaikh 'Abdur Rasul, was expelled from Bushehr by bhe Persian Government and took to his boats, with which he commenced a blockade of the town making Kharag the base of his operations. In November, only a few days after he had discontinued his blockade, and fled from Kharag to Kuwait, Shaikh Sultan-bin -Saqi »r, chief of the Qawasim, arrived to his assistance, by previous arrangement, with a fleet carrying 1,000 to 1,500 men of the piratical Qasimi tribe ; and it was evident that, as there was no longer any hope of the Shaikh recovering his hereditary government, a mere vindictive attack upon Bushehr town and the plunder of its mercantile inhabitants must be intended. In these circumstances Mr. Blane, the British Resident, thought himself justified in interfering and in obliging the Qawasim, under threats of force, to take their departure from tl\e port. ^ After the fracas described in the preceding paragraph, resulting in the expulsion of the hereditary Shaikh, Riza Quli Mirza, a brother of Timur Mirza, was appointed by his father, the Farman-Farma of Ears, to the Governorship of Bushehr. The establishment of direct Qajar rule over the town does not appear to have been relished by the inhabitants ; and the conduct of the new Governor's mother, who visited Bushehr in person and took measures- including the arrest of the chief of Burazjan —for increasing the revenues of the government, at length provoked an open rebellion. On the evening of the 14th April the residence of Riza Quli Khan was surrounded by an armed force under one Jamal Khan of Hushehr, who was countenanced by the chiefs of Tangistan and Dashti; and His Royal Highness found him self obliged to release the chief of Burazjan and to consent to his own departure from Bushehr early the next morning. On the following day, in accordance with his promise, he left accompanied by a few servants only; and the ladies of his household were sent after him as soon as mules could be obtained to carry their travelling litters and luggage. In May 1833 the Prince-Governor of Shiraz informed Mr. Blane, the British Resident at Bushehr, that at the request of the late rebels, who had a expressed their sincere sorrow for their fault, ^ he bad ^Shaikh 'Abdur Rasul was killed at Purazjan, by the inhabitants of that place, while on a return journey from Shiraz to Bushehr. Deserted by his followers, he sold his life dearly. See Binning's Journal, Vol. I, pages 162-163.1919 H appointed his son Timur Mirza to take charge of Bushehr instead of Iliza Quli Mirza ; and he asked the Eesident to meet the wishes of the ilyj new Governor in all respects,,—a request to which that officer returned a ikitj arc [ed but courteous reply. The popular party had made it a condition of Timur Mirza's appointment that he should not remain long at Bushehr himself; nor bring many attendants with him ; and on the 29th of June, after a short stay, he took his departure. Two persons of rank were ^ appointed by him to act as his deputies in his absence, but this was a purely nominal arrangement, and the real control of affairs continued to be exercised by Jamal Khan and his supporters. On the 1st August, however, the local combination formed to resist the encroachment of the Shiraz Government broke up, the chief ot Tangistan beiug murdered in a place of public assembly by the chief of Dashti ; who was jealous of his power. Husain Quli Khan of Angali one of the Tangistani chief's adherents was killed ; another of his leading supporters was severely wounded ; and the rank and file of his followers took refuge in the British Residency, whence with the consent of the opposite party they were despatched by the Resident, partly by land and partly by sea, to their own homes. British protection was next sought by Mirza ; Ali Khan, one of the nominal representatives of Timur Mirza ; he fled to the Residency on the 19th of August from the house of the Qazi, where he did not feel secure, and, was safely put on board the East India Company's sloop-of-war c&lt; Tepiate ' before any objection could be raised. On the morning of the k 20th August Riza Quli Mirza, Timur Mirza and Nasr Ullah Mirza appeared before the town with a large force; and the party inside, their overtures for a settlement having been rejected, prepared to leave by sea. A few of them kept up a show of resistance upon the walls so long as daylight lasted ; and the royalist forces, on entering the town after dusk and rushing down to the beach to cut the fugitives off, found that the last of their boats was already beyond reach. By the exertion of the royal princes the town, except the houses that had been occupied by the rebel leaders, was saved from being plun dered, The only loss of life that occurred was among a party of Tangis- tanis who were occupied in searching tha abode of Jamal Khan; one of them inadvertently thrust a light into some jars of gunpowder, causing a n explosion by which eight persons were killed. Jamal Khan seems to W escaped to the ' Faiz Rabbanah a Masqat ship on board of which he had already embarked his family and property ; he narrowly escaped se izure hy his o vvn associate, the chief of Dashti, who had resolved to1920 hand him over to the victors as a propitiatory offering. A few Dashtig took refuge at the British Residency and others were at first believed to be hiding in the town^ but none could be found by the Tangistanis who were seeking for them to kill them in satisfaction of the general blood-feud to which the murder of the Tangistani chief had given rise. Jamal Khan seems to have taken up his residence in the territories of the Sultan of ^Oman, to reappear six years later, under the auspices of his protector, as a competitor for the Governorship of Bushebr. British relations with the Persian Coast and Islands, 1797-1831 Troubles of The rebellion of Husain Quli Khan was a cause, through the local Residency 11 at ^^ s ^ lir ^ ai:ices which it occasioned, of considerable inconvenience to the Bushehrin British Factory at Bushehr. The circumstances have already been described. On the day before the arrival of the 'Atbi fleet Mr. Hankey Smith, the British Resident, shipped his own property and that of the East India Company on a large native vessel, hired for the purpose, intending to remove it to the island of Kharag, where he hoped to escape the exactions to which he would probably be exposed at Bushehr^ if the place were taken. The foremost ^Atbi boat, however, on entering the harbour, made straight for the K esident's chartered vessel, hauled down the British flag which was flying on board of her, and plundered her of several articles. Shaikh Salim, the Arab admiral, when the matter was represented to him, at once ordered restitution to be made; and in tbe end only two bags of tin belonging to the Company and four or five bags of rice belonging to Mr, Smith, which had been accidentally dropped into the sea, remained unrecovered. Shaikh Nasir II, however, whose ' illiberal and pusillanimous jealousy made him adverse to the plan/' declined to let the Resident remove to Kharag ; and Mr. Smith was obliged to re-land everything at Bushehr except the tin and the rice, which he consigned to Basrah. When the town fell, ' scarcely a house escaped being stripped, and it was with the greatest difficulty with the Residency sepoys and my own threats so wrote Mr. Smith— a that I frustrated the general attempts made upon this^ old ruin, inviting on every side an easy access. . * I t is not certain where the British Residency was situated at this time. It originally oulside Bushehr altogether, but Was afterwards moved into the centre of tue town, where it remained for a short time only. Its transfer to its present site seems to have taken place early in the 19th century, if not before then, a rent of Rs. 1W per mensem being paid for the ground occupied at first to the Shaikh of Bushehrand after his abolition to private proprietors.1921 121 St Wid; fiTanjijj the 'itotisii mpioi,,- mil i alreaij i Mr, | andtktrf rthe jii] )n entei el ki: r or five k ¥ ' (Wfoi. li lie m easy ^ I prese^S a rent» - Tlie Factory servants were robbed of even the shirts on their backs,, and the Resident found it necessary to supply them with clothes and provi sions besides which Shaikh Ghanim, who was expelled,, left Bushehr owing him 300 piastres.* Mr. Smith requested that in the circumstances his losses might be made good to him by his employers; and he took the opportunity to repeat a request, which he had made before, for a reinforce ment of his sepoy guard. The relations of Mehdi ^Ali Khan, the British Resident, with Shaikh Nasir II, of Bushehr were of a very friendly character. So much so was this the case that in March 1801 Shaikh Nasir, who was then in India, wrote a letter to Mehdi ''Ali Khan, begging him to superintend the government of Bushehr and to regard Nasir's brother Muhammad as his son, and Nasir's son Haji Sulaiman as his servant. Two troublesome cases arose through the shipwreck of British vessels in the summer of 1803 upon the coast of Persia. The first mishap befell the ' Hector, ' which, while on her way from Bombay to Bushehr and Basrah carrying 850 bales of the East India Company's goods, ran aground in the month of May off the port of Nakhilu. The captain having signalled for assistance by firing guns, Shaikh Rahmah, the chief of NakhTlu, came off with a large number of boats, ejected the officers and crew, and himself took possession of the vessel with all that she contained. The officers and crew subse quently reached Masqat in safety, and thence returned to India. In August of the same year the East India Company^s packet vessel 'Alertwas driven ashore in bad weather upon the island of Shaikh Shu'aib near Nakhilu, whereupon about 500 of the islanders came down to the shore and plundered her of treasure which she was conveying on from Basrah and Bushehr to Bombay. The remonstrances of the , who referred to the friendship existing between the Governments of Britain and Persia, were altogether unheeded. On the third day Shaikh Rahmah himself visited the wreck and took away whatever of value remained on board, leaving only two bags of rice as a provision for 30 or 40 people. Some despatches also were carried away, but of these a ff Europe packet ' was afterwards returned open. The total amount of the loss in the two cases is not stated, nor is ^ fate of the vessels themselves clear ; but it seems probable that, of the latter, one was destroyed by the sea and the other appropriated by Shaikh Rahmah. The plundered merchandise was quickly distributed in various directions. Shaikh Rahmah soon afterwards visited Masqat in *See footnote on page 152 post.

A person named Mirza Baqir of Bandar 'Abbas purchased 800 Tumans' worth of the stolen property and took a further quantity to the value of 5,200 Tumans provisionally on long credit, but the latter he subsequently returned to the Shaikh. Persian mercbants of Yazd and Khojahs from Sind also helped to relieve Shaikh Rabmali of part of his stock; and afterwards strong reason was found for suspect ing that Shaikh Saif, Harami, of ^Asalu and Shaikh ^Abdur Rahman of Naband had acquired a joint interest to the extent of Rs. 33,750 in tbe goods taken out of the ' Hector. 33 A considerable proportion of the stuff, however, remained in the possession of Shaikh Rahmah, and was deposited by him on the islands of Hormuz and Qishm. 1803, Representations were at once made to the Government of Fars by Mr. Lovett, the British Resident in the Persian Gulf ; and Shaikh Nasir II of Bushehr, who had incurred the dipleasure of the Prince-Governor and was actually in confinement at Shiraz at the time, was liberated for tbe purpose of conducting an expedition against Nakhilu. The Shaikh, however, having obtained his liberty, took no steps to carry out his instructions; and at the end of the year the outrages were still un redressed. 1804. The broker of the British Factory at Bushehr was next sent to the Shaikh of Nakhilu with a letter from the Resident, demanding repara tion. On the 12th June 1804 he returned with an evasive reply by the Shaikh, who offered to restore half of the missing goods; but the proposal was rejected by the Resident, who considered it inadequate, and who suspected besides that it was made without any intention of fulfil' ment. On the next day, the 13th June, there arrived at Bushehr one Agha Riza, who had now been appointed by the Shiraz Government to enquire into both affairs, and to exact reparation from Shaikh Rahmah with the help of Shaikh Nasir of Bushehr and other chiefs of the coast. This Commissioner was handsomely received and entertained by the British Resident, who expended about Rs. 5,000 on presents for him and strove to fortify his mind with moral principles against the corrupt approaches of Shaikh Rahmah, for that rascally chieftain, as was well known, ' re ^ much for the secure enjoyment of his plunder upon the venality the person who might be deputed to enforce its restitution.1923 Mr. Lovett intended that the cost o£ the presents of Agha Eiza should from a charge of 10 or 15 per cent, on the value of the goods ; which he proposed to allow as salvage. Shaikh Rahmah, on being thus called to account by the Shir^z Government, asserted ' the right of every country to the property which might be shipwrecked on its coasts/' and Agha Eiza unfortunately seemed inclined to agree with liini; but suggested that an exception should be made in the present instance on account of the political alliance between Britain and Persia. In July 1804 Mr. Manesty, who, as we have seen before, took charge of Bushehr on the departure of Mr. Lovett and then proceeded to Tehran on a pretended mission from the Government of India, obtained a Farman from the Shah to the Prince-Governor of Shiraz, ordering a speedy settlement of the Nakhilu cases ; and soon afterwards it was stated that one Zaki Khan had been ordered to take action against Shaikh Kahmah, with the help of a tribe of Arabs who were at enmity with the people of Nakhilu. Perhaps in consequence of this report Rahmah, about the middle of 1804, abandoned Nakhilu alto- and withdrew, accompanied by his family and about 700 depen dents, to the island of Shaikh Shu'aib. Here he proceeded to form a permanent settlement, built two towers for defence, and established intimate relations with the Wahhabis j and , as he was supposed to com mand the services of about 1,000 musketeers and was connected with the Shaikhs of Charak, 'Asalu and Kangun upon the Persian side of the Gulf and with those of Ras-al-Khaimah and Zubarah in Arabia, his position appeared to be a strong one. A proposal was made by Captain j|; Seton, the British Resident at Masqat, for an attack on him by the y British, with two ships, and the Sultan of 'Oman conjointly ; but it was lit ne ^ved by the Bombay Government, who were unwilling to make ll war on their own account upon a Shaikh who was a subject of the Shah of Persia. At length the persistent representations of Lieutenant Bruce, the 1805. Acting Resident at Bushehr, took effect, and Shaikh Nasir sailed with a fleet for the island of Shaikh Shu'aib. The assistance of the British cruiser ' Mornington ' was offered to the Shaikh by Captain Seton, the Resident at Masqat, who was then engaged with Saiyid J^dai of 'Oman in an expedition to Bandar 'Abbas and Qishm, noticed aer on ; but it was refused ; and Shaikh Nasir's proceedings from Une August 1805 were not such as to inspire any confidence in those 011 whose behalf he was employed, for it was reported that he only fired eW ^ Uns eve ry day as a matter of form and went on shore at night to 121 A1924 dine with Shaikh Eahmah. He succeeded^ however^ in obtaining the surrender of a part of the plunder; and afterwards ; when Mr. Bruce continued fco press for full satisfaction, he seized Shaikh Kahmah's son by a stratagem and carried him off as a hostage to Masqat, with the result that in the end substantial reparation was obtained in the case of tlie ' Hector/- A small quantity of the Shaikh^ booty was recovered by Saiyid Badar at Hormuz and handed over by him to Captain Seton in the course of their joint expedition above mentioned. 1806 ' I n ^806, in consequence of information that had reached them regard ing the complicity of Shaikh Saif and Shaikh 'Abdur Rahman, already referred to, the Government of Bombay laid an embargo on some vessels belonging to their ports which happened to visit India, and before releasing them obtained guarantees from third parties, valid for nine months, for the submission of the Shaikhs to an enquiry. A protest was afterwards made against the Bombay seizure by the Prince-Governor of Shiraz, who stated that Shaikh Saif was one of the respectable chiefs who had been employed by the Persian Government to coerce Shaikh Eahmah and requested that he should not be proceeded against; and, as Mr. Bruce also reported the evidence connecting the two Shaikhs with the outrages to be insufficient, the claim against them was eventually dropped. Fly,' 0 1S03- A peculiar case of a different character was that of the ' Ply/' a 14- S* 1111 ki'ig belonging to the East India Company, which was captured near Qais Island in 1803 by the French privateer 'La Fortuneof 38 guns, commanded by Captain Surcouff. Before the Fly ' was boarded, her commander ran her aground and sank some Government despatches and treasure, of which he was in charge, in fathoms of water, taking marks for their future recovery. The officers, crew and passengers of the Fly were conveyed by the French to Bushehr, where several prizes taken by the French had been collected ; and they were there dis charged with the exception of three officers who were sent to Mauritius to be exchanged. The party released at Bushehr, after buying a native vessel among them, embarked for Bombay, touched at Qais, and recovered the Govern ment despatches ; but in 1804, in the course of their onward voyage, they were captured between Tunb and Musandam near the entrance of the Gulf by Qasimi pirates, who carried them to Ras-al-Khaimah, as is related m another chapter of this book. By undertaking to show their captors where the treasure of the ' Fly - lay, they at length obtained a conditional promise of freedom and were taken back to Qais, where, hj(Jo 4 ?' 1925 means o£ pearl divers, the genuineness of their offer was quickly asoer- tained. After performing their part of the contract they were landed by tbe Arabs on the island ; and there they hid themselves; and subsisted fith difficulty, during a massaore of the inhabitants by the Qawasim. When the pirates at length went away, they prepared a boat and a raft on which they set out to cross to the mainland ; but the boat was lost on the passage with all on board of her, and only the raft reached the Persian shore. The survivors made their way along the coast as far as the island of Shaikh Shu'aib, suffering extraordinary privations and abandoning as they proceeded; one after another of their number; until at length none of the Indian sailors, sepoys or servants; belonging to the party remained; and only a few of the Europeans. The chief of Shaikh SWaib received them most inhospitably, but he was at length prevailed on by threats to send them in a boat to Bushehr. One of the party died while being carried on board the boat, others on the voyage; and another on arrival at Bushehr; and in the end; out of a numerous company only Mr. Jowl or Yowl; a ship^s officer, and Pennel, a seaman; survived. These eventually reached Bombay with the ' FlyV despatches, which they had carefully preserved. In 1805 Captain Seton; the Resident at Masqat; was* instructed to make on effort to trace some native members of the party who had been left at Shaikh Shu^aib on board a native boat bound for Masqat, but it is not known whether or not he was successful in his quest. In 1805; as related elsewhere. Captain Seton, the British Resident at T Masqat, accompanied Saiyid Badar, the ruler of ; Oman, on an expedition tan of'Oman to the Persian Gulf. The object of the Resident, under i;he orders of Government, was the suppression of the Qasimi pirates of Ras-al- Resident at Khaimah; whose depredations had now become excessive, with the jjandar t0 lielp of the Saiyid ; whereas the motive of the Saiyid seems to have been 'Abbas, 1805, chiefly the recovery of the leased territory of Bandar ^ Abbas and its dependencies from the Bani Ma J in, a local tribe, by whom it had been usurped on the death of his predecessor. Captain Seton-'s reason for complying with a request by Saiyid Badar for his company in the Mornington' at Bandar 'Abbas seems to have been a fear lest the Sultan, if he were alone, might be induced to make common cause with * The inaction of the Bushehr Residency in this case seems peculiar. But 1804 iiitoh* 6 ^ eal ^ ■^ r ' ^^tt f 0 !! sick, in which Mr. Mauesty improperly stepped ^ 0 18 ^ ae0 ail d went to masquerade as an Envoy at Shiraz, and in which Lieutenant want of judgment afterwards made him notorious, was appointed1926 the Qawasim and the 'Utub under Wahhabi influence, and with them to fall upon and destroy the fleet of Shaikh Nasir of Bushehr, then engaged at Shaikh Shu'aib in coercing the Shaikh of Nakhilu; and he consi dered that his own presence would be a check upon action by tlie Sultan offensive to the Governments of Persia and Turkey, such as it was desired by the British authorities in India to avoid in the joint campaign against the pirates. Captain Seton seems also to have hoped that by humouring his ally he might obtain from him a grant of Bandar 'Abbas, which, in total disregard or ignorance of its previous history, lie represented as a secure and convenient place where a lucrative trade might be carried on. Saiyid Badar, arriving on the spot ahead of Captain Seton, found that the siege of Minab by Mulla Husain of the Bani Ma'in, to raise which was one object of his expedition, had already been abandoned. He then commenced negotiations through the ''Utub, by whom he was accompanied, for the surrender of Bandar 'Abbas, which was still in the possession of Bani Main. The ; Utub, who did not wish to see peace established, made no real effort to adjust matters between the parties, brought back an insulting message from the Bani Ma'in to the Saiyid, excused themselves fiom remaining longer on the plea that their vessels were overloaded, and so sailed for home leaving their ally in the lurch. The strength of the Atbi contingent was about 1,500 men, and Saiyid Badar's force was reduced by its departure to less than 1,000 'Omanis, his own subjects, whom he had brought with him. Captain Seton joined him off Qishm town on the 5th June 1805, and the same evening Saiyid Badar stood over to Bandar 'Abbas, landed his troops, and invested the town. The British Resident, it should be observed, was now impressed with an idea that the recovery by the Saiyid of Bandar Abbas and Minab, from which the piratical tribes drew a large part of their necessary supplies, would be a useful sfcep towards the prevention of piracy; and he was clearly inclined to ignore the probable effect of forcible action in that quarter upon the susceptibilities of the Persian Government. On the morning of the 6th June, after Saiyid Badar's men had driven the enemy into Bandar 'Abbas, had taken posses sion of a house near the walls, and were about to erect a battery, an inter view took place between the Saiyid and the Eesident. The manage ment of the operations from the sea, which had hitherto been clumsily conducted from inconvenient positions, was then undertaken by Captain Seton and Lieutenant N. Gilmour of the ' Mornington,' who betook themselves on board the Sultan's ship 'Gunjava' along with a naval1927 oid 25 Europeans and four guns; and on the morning of the 7tli fire was opened on the Bandar ^Abbas fort with telling effect from the db, uQ un java' and from another 'Omani vessel anchored closer inshore, fcilji The garrison soon offered to surrender in case they were not succoured ' within two days, but this proposal was rejected ; and on the evening of in tk j;, 0 f June ; Lieutenant Gilmour having stationed the ' Gunjava ^ and the other 'Omani vessel at opposite angles in order to obtain a cross fire the defenders realised the hopelessness of their position and surren dered at discretion. The Saiyid thus recovered the rented possessions of his family in Persia; and he at once passed on, as related in another place, to combined operations with Captain Seton against a Qasimi fleet at Qishm. The proceedings of Captain Seton at Bandar 'Abbas were not treated, however, as a matter of indifference by the Prmce-Governor of Shiraz when he came to learn of them. Lieutenant Bruce, the Acting British Resident at Bushehr, to whom Captain Seton had referred in advance^ consulted Muhammad Nabi Khan, the Persian Envoy to India, as to the propriety of the operations, and was informed in reply that the allegiance of the Bani MVin and the Shaikhs of Lingeh and Shanas to the Persian Government was in general precarious, and that there would probably be no objection to their being punished by the British if they had deserved it; but this answer was given on the supposition that it was only meant to deal with pirates and not to interfere in other affairs. The matter was not mentioned by Mr. Bruce to the Government of Shiraz at allj for it was urgent, and he knew that an application to them would entail teferences to Tehran and so probably occasion three or four months' delay; Mr» Bruce's opinion—after the event—was that the British should not take part in any hostile operations at places on the Persian coast, unless at Nakhilu or Shaikh Shu'aib in connection with the ' Hector v and &lt;l Alert ' cases, and there only at the request of Shaikh N asir, lest the impending mission of Muhammad Nabi Khan to India should be preven ted ; but Captain Seton though he had asked for it, did not wait for Mr. Bruce's opinion. Captain Seton's justification of his own measures Was that Mulla Husain^ whom he had helped to eject from Bandar , was father-in-law and cousin to Sultan-bin-Saqar, the chief of piratical Qasimi tribe of the Arabian coast opposite, and that his engaged in piracy along with those of the Qawasim. In the Ies ^lt) Lieutenant Bruce was instructed by the Government of Bombay assure the Shiraz Government that Captain Seton had been ^tiuctly ordered to avoid any act of which Persia could complain, an1928 Financial relations between the Bombay Grovememnt and the Snaikhs of Busbehr, 1807-15. Assurances to the British Eesident at Bushehr in regard to the presence of the French in Persia, 1807-08. that, if he had assisted Saiyid Badar in recovering Bandar 'Abbas, it must have been from an impression that his doing so would be agreeable to the Shah. There is nothing to show how this hypothetical explanation was received by the Persian authorities, but they do not seem to have done more than express to Mr. Bruce their astonishment at the action of the Masqat Eesident; and Muhammad Nabi Khan in due time proceeded on his mission to India, The apparent apathy of the Shah's Govern ment may be explained by the difficulties with Eussia in which Persia was at the time involved, K The Shaikhs of Bushehr seem to have been treated with considerable liberality, in financial matters, by the Government of Bombay. In 1807 a grant of Es. 3,000 was made to Shaikh Nasir as a reward for help rendered by him in connection with a piracy upon a British boat; and in compensation for the loss of one of his own ' m an attack made by Lieutenant Cox.' On the departure of the Shaikh for Makkah in 1807, a ship named the Sulaiman Shahi ' was sent by 'Abdur Easul, his son and acting deputy, to Bombay with the modest request that she might be 'very nicely repaired' at the Government dockyard and returned as early as possible to Bushehr ; and the Governor in Council not only directed this to be done, but gave the Sulaiman Shalii^ precedence over all other vessels in the yard except those of the Royal Navy. Encouraged by this liberality, Shaikh 'Abdur Easul next de- manded that the work should be paid for, as well as executed; by the Bombay Government; and they eventually agreed to defray one-fourtii of the cost. When Shaikh 'Abdur Rasul was kidnapped by order of the Shiraz Government in 1808, the British account against him was made up and was found to amount to Es. 25,787, of which Es. 17,940 was on account of re-coppering and other repairs to his ship, and Es. ^,954 was due to private creditors under British protection. The question of the recovery of these debts was revived on the return of 'Abdur Rasul to power in 1811; and in 1815 it was still, apparently, under discussion. In 1807, when Lieutenant Bruce was on the point of vacating Persian Gulf Eesidency in favour of Mr. Hankey Smith, a Farman and robes of honour for him were sent by the Prince-Governor of Farsto Bushehi. Mi. Bruce, attended by his guard and the principal inhabi* tants of Bushehr, met the bearer, Toral Baig, Gurgi, a personal attendant of the Prince-Governor, on the road at some distance from the walls; was invested with the dress in a tent which he had caused to be pitchedty the wayside, the Farman being at the same time publicly read aloud by1929 (&lt;^7) a Mirza; and then returned in state to the town. Toral Baig was accompanied by Muhammad Husain Khan of Khisht, who was charged w ith special messages for Mr. Sruce ; showing that the presentation had been made by order of the Shah himself and that iits object was to emphasize the good relations of Britain and Persia, which it was hoped that the recent visits of French agents to the country would not be allowed to disturb. Some anxiety having been expressed by Mr. Hankey Smith, the successor of Mr. Bruce, in regard to the arrival of General Gardanne in Persia, steps were taken by Nasr Ullah Khan, the chief minister of the Prince-Governor of Fars, to reassure him also. The agents employed for the purpose were ^Abdur Rasul, Shaikh of Bushehr, to whom a special letter was written, and Muhammad Husain Khan of Khisht, who was again sent to Bushehr with a verbal commission. This latter incident occurred in 1808. General Malcolm, during his second mission to Persia in 1808, had several times occasion to be satisfied with the conduct of Shaikh Jabarah of Kangun, and he ultimately ordered Mr. Bruce to send him a present. A revolution, however, soon afterwards took place at Kangun which resulted in the displacement of Shaikh Jabarah by his father. Shaikh Muhammad, and the despatch of the present was suspended; but in February 1809, Shaikh Jabarah having escaped from prison and arrived at Rushehr via Bahrain, a sum of 400 * piastres in cash and other articles to the value of 100 piastres were given him by the Resident, which came opportunely to alleviate his distress. In February 1809 it was reported by Muhammad Nabi Khan, Governor of Bushehr, that, should General Malcolm return from Bombay as an enemy, all the Arab tribes of the coast to the southward of Kangun would join him, in the hope of shaking off the yoke of Persia. Several ports of the Persian Coast fell within the purview of the expedition despatched by the Government of India in 1809 for the suppression of piracy in the Gulf; for the Qawasim, who were the principal offenders and whose own head-quarters were at Eas-al-Khaimah upon the Arabian side, had numerous accomplices and sympathisers upon the Persian side.

Connection of Persia with the second British ex pedition against the Qawasim, 1809-10.1930 proceedings contemplated upon their littoral was requested; but, lest a reply should not be received from them in time, the following instruc- tions were also given to the British naval and military commanders In any case you need not hesitate to proceed to destroy the maritime equipment of the pirates on that side of the Gulph, wherever you may ascertain them to exist, taking care to proceed in all such cases with the utmost practicable respect towards the undisputed right of His Majesty the King of Persia, the present ally of our Sovereign, and to cause it to be well explained to such of his officers as the course of events may lead you into communication with that the British Government have no other objeci than to free (trade from) the obstructions and heavy losses to which it is now, and has so long continued, exposed from the predatory attacks of the Joasmee and other pirates, without the slightest intention to occupy any part of the territory or to molest or annoy so much as one of His Majesty's loyal subjects, [and] whom, in pursuance of the happily cemented friendship between the two states, it is on the contrary the desire of the English nation to cherish and protect and promote the interest of to the greatest practicable extent. The notice received by the Persians appears, however, to have been sufficient. In September 1809 it was intimated to Lieutenant Bruce^ the Resident at Bushehr, that the Prince-Governor of Shiraz intended, as soon as the weather was cool enough, to send troops under the command of his minister Nasr Ullah Khan against the Qawasim, which would deal with the piratical settlements upon the Persian Coast, and in certain circumstances might even cross over to Ras-al-Khaimah; but no signs were ever perceived of so much as an attempt to carry this laudable inten tion into effect. Somewhat earlier in the year, it is true, a Persian force from Lar had visited Lingeh and Charak and driven some Qawasim whom they found there to Basidu on the island of Qishm. As is related fully in the history of Trucial 'Oman, the British arma ment destroyed the port of Lingeh and some vessels found there, and also did considerable execution at Laft, which was stoutly defended by the same Mulla Husain that Captain Seton, in 1805, had evicted from Ban dar 'Abbas. At Laft, however, the British acted under an authority granted by the Sultan of 'Oman, to whom—and not to the Shah -the Government of Bombay understood the whole island of Qisbm to pertain. The Persian ports of Kangun, Nakhilu, Charak, Mughu, Kung, Hamiran and Band Mu'allim were visited and searched by vessels of the British fleet, chiefly in November 1809 and January 1810; but no piratical craft were found at any of these places unless at Mughu, where four vessels belonging to Sharjah were destroyed. Mughu, Charak, and the small coast village of Shanas near Lingeh had merely, it was stated r\1931 Mi ed themselves under the protection of the Qawasim. The case of Nakhilu was peculiar. On the death of Shaikh Rahmah, who was their ruler at the time of the ' Hector ' and ' Alert 31 cases in 1803-1805^ the inhabitants became dependent on Shaikh ' Abdur Rahman of Naband, a harbourer of pirates and himself a pirate; but, shortly before the British expedition of 1809, he too died. The son of the late Shaikh Rahmah, into ^ose hands Nakhilu proper had passed, then connected himself for the sake of security with a surviving brother of Shaikh ^ Abdur Rahman, who had no dealings with the Qawasim, and with Shaikh Jabarah of Kangun, who was on good terms with the Sultan of 'Oman ; but at the time of the British expedition, strangely enough, it was reported that Shaikh Jabarah had been taken prisoner by the Shaikh of Nakhilu and that efforts were being made, at the instance of the Sultan of 'Oman, to procure his release. In 1816 a serious and fortunately very unusual case occurred at Shiraz, where Mr. J. Williams of the Bombay Civil Service was sub jected to gross indignities. Mr. Williams, who was in bad health, had gone to Shiraz in May 1816 for change of climate; he took with him a letter of introduction from Mr. Bruce, the Resident at Bushehr; and he was provided at Shiraz with a residence in one of the Farman- Farma's gardens. On the 30th of August his room was invaded by some hangers-on of the Shiraz Court, whose conduct became so brutal that he was obliged to make his escape from a window by means of a rope, not without danger to his life. On his complaining to the Prince against the three chief offenders, a pretence was made of disgracing two of them, and Mr. Williams was induced to declare him self satisfied. But Mr. Bruce did not allow the matter to rest here; and eventually the three individuals in question were severely bastinadoed in the presence of Mr. R. Sharpe, Assistant-Surgeon of the Bushehr Resi- dency^ who had been specially deputed to Shiraz to witnsss their punish ment. In 1814 a most discreditable act was committed by ^Abdullah-bin- Ahmad, Shaikh of Charak. Instead of assisting the British ship ' Ahmad Shah, ^ which had grounded on an island * near his port and Insult to Mr. J.

Mr. Morier, Acting British Minister at Tehran^ applied to the Shah for a Farman for the settlement of the case, but, if granted, it remained a dead letter. Some boats were burned at Charak, as we shall see later on, by the British expedition of 1819-20; and in 1820 a promise was obtained from the Persian authorities that the Shaikh should be removed from his government. Per^a^^with ^ ien in 1819 another naval and military expedition was despatched the third ^ rom I n( lia against the piratical Qawasim of the Persian Gulf, the ^tioifagamst ^ &gt;ers ^ an Government, who were now enjoying a respite from trouble with the^Qawasim, Russia, took a somewhat closer interest in the proceediDgs than on the last occasion. The British authorities, on their part, were anxious to avoid all cause of offence to Persia, but they were inexorably resolved to suppress piracy; and, as the Persian ports of Lingeh, Mughu, Charak and Chiru were believed to be piratical, it was considered desirable to pro vide for the contingency of action being taken upon the Persian Coast, Dr. Jukes was, therefore, sent ahead of the expedition with letters from the Governor of Bombay to the Prince-Governor of Fars aud the Gover* nor of Bushehr, requesting the co-operation of those authorities by land; and assuring them that there was nothing in the intentions of the British inconsistent with the friendship between their Government and that of Persia. On the arrival of the expedition in the Gulf, Dr, Jukes became subordinate to the commander. Sir W. G. Keir, whose own instructions with reference to operations upon the Persian Coast were almost exactly the same in their wording as those of 1809, already quoted. In short, while every consideration was shown for the feelings of the Persian Government, it was not intended that measures against piracy on the Persian side should be neglected, or even delayed, by the attitude which they might assume ; but it was added that any places upon the Persian Coast which might be taken by, or submit to, the Biitish armament should, if they had belonged to Persia before the ex* tension of Wahhabi influence to the Gulf, be made over to the Shaikh of Bushehr as the local representative of the Shah in those regions. Tie Government of Bombay also communicated with Mr. H. Willock, th® the British Charge d'Affaires at Tehran, and begged him to justify the British expedition to the Persian Government by dwelling on the m® 8 ' trous evils which had resulted from the impunity of pirates a, on(Mj) ''lis las | rit ^ Hi ition quent own 5 from til lings tki part, we J onwitUetel 'arsaudty authorities Iji iutentio® il eir Govern: be Gulf, Hi i jr Persian W 1 ose of llM iwn rsia do. e overt . u, P .niDgon* 1 if 1933 [ inability of Persia to control her maritime tribes^ on the conse- rio-ht of the British to take measures for the protection of their trade^ and on the reassuring precedent of the expedition of 1809-JOj which showed that the British Government were only concerned to eradicate piracy and had no ulterior designs. On the 9th January 1820 a letter from the Prince-Governor of Shiraz reached Sir W. G. Keii% who had by that time effected the main part of Ms task upon the Arabian side; it ignored the question of,the intended British operations upon the Persian Coast; but the bearer, Mirza Muhammad Baqir, made many enquiries as to the form that they might be expected to take. Eventually some boats were destroyed at the Persian ports of Lingeh, Mughu, Charak, •'Asalu and Kangun, evidently without the assistance of Persian authorities or further re ference to them ; and it is indicated by one authority that a claim for damages on account of these proceedings was subsequently presented by the Persian Government and satisfied by the Government of Bombay, but exact ^ information on this point is wanting. In 1820 the Shah, who was averse to the periodical inspection of Persian ports by British vessels as a check upon the fitting out of piratical craft, undertook to appoint a Persian officer for the performance of that duty, to enforce upon the Persian Coast regulations similar to those imposed by Sir W. G. Keir's treaty upon the Arab tribes of Trucial 'Oman, and to oblige Persian sub jects to use a distinctive flag at sea ; but, needless to say, neither of the two latter engagements was ever fulfilled. The Shah's ministers did not shrink from assuming full responsibility for the behaviour of their mari time subjects, hut remarked in a note, dated 9th December, to the British Charge d'Affaires: 'If any further steps are necessary to check piracy in the Persian Gulf, these can effectually be taken by the Prince of Fars, and no foreign aid is requisite.'^ The question of the treatment of Bahrain had been discussed in India in connection with the expedition of 1819-20, no doubt because the designs and constant attempts of Persia and ^Oman upon those islands between the liad a disturbing effect upon the general peace of the Gulf. The Persian Government, since their loss of Bahrain to the J Utub in 1783, had never to scheme for its recovery, and in 1802 and 1816 they had abetted by the Sultan of 'Oman to establish himself in Proposed mediation of Britain Persian Gov ernment and the Shaikh of Bahrain, 1819-20. r as paid, in 1822 or 1823, for some Lingeh and Charak boats, the 'ion of which was made a subject of complaint against Mr. Bruce (see next one of the text), but these were perhaps two special cases.1934 possession; but their relations with him had been characterised hj mutual distrust^ and the Shiraz Government had been guilty of actual bad faith in making him promises of military assistance, in 1817 and 1818, whicli they did not attempt to fulfil. In 1819; shortly before the arrival of the British expedition in the Gulf, the Prince-Governor of Fars had again opened negotiations with Saiyid Sa'id in regard to Bahrain; and the appearance of Sir W. G. Keir's forces on the scene brought matters to a head, A fear that the British might place the Sultan in possession of the coveted islands brought the Prince-Governor of Shiraz, with an army, down in trepidation to the coast; and he applied indifferently, and at first with equal want of success, to the British Commander and to the Sultan of 'Oman for marine transports to carry his troops to Bahrain. Saiyid Said, from an inclination to make the attempt on Bahrain alone and so reserve for himself the whole fruits of possible success, did not immediately agree to the proposals of the Farman-Farma ; but at length, doubting the sufficiency of his own resources and having failed to obtain the assistance of Sir W. G. Keir, who declined to help either competitor, he collected his fleet at Qishm for an expedition against Bahrain in partnership with the Persians. But the Prince-Governor, by this time, had changed his mind; and, apparently in March 1810, he left the coast and returned to ShTraz. The preparations of the Fars Government against Bahrain were the bane of the whole Persian Coast where, almost annually, they were made a pretext for overwhelming the local chiefs with vexatious exactions; and the Prince-Governor of Shiraz found in them a con- venient excuse for postponing the visits to Tehran which he was sometimes invited to pay for the purpose of adjusting his several accounts with the royal treasury. The Government of Bombay, as early as December 1819, had sug gested British mediation between the Government of Persia and the Shaikh of Bahrain, with a view to an arrangement by which the Shaikh should pay tribute to Persia and the Shah should undertake not to in terfere in Bahrain affairs ;but they wished it to be distinctly understood that no responsibility could be assumed by themselves .. as mediators fa the observance of the settlement that might be reached. Their sugges tions were communicated to the Persian Government by Sir H. Willo^i the British Charge d J Affaires at Tehran • but the Persian reply, delivered in May 1820, was to the efiect that the Shah must consult the Governor of ShTraz, who was responsible for the affairs of Persia in the1935 Gulf before giving an answer; and in October 1820 the Bombay Govern ment thought it expedient to withdraw their offer. The hesitation of the Shah seems to have proceeded from an unfounded suspicion on his part that the cession of an island in the Gulf would be demanded by the British as the price of their good offices. In the early morning of the 18th March 1820 the a Ariel, '—an armed brig of 160 tons, belonging to the East India Company, which had taken part in the operations against Ras-al-Khaimah,—suddenly foundered in a squall about 13 miles to the south-east of Kharag Island. Of 83 persons on board at the time of the catastrophe, only five or six succeeded in reaching Kharag on a canoe which was kept by the officers for duck-shooting, the principal of these being Mr. J. Glen, the Surgeon. The few survivors were kindly received, entertained, and forwarded to Bushehr by the Shaikh of Kharag, who afterwards received a gratuity of Es. 500 from the British Resident in acknowledgment of his humane conduct. After the conclusion of the British expedition of 1819-20, the Gov ernment of Fars and the Persian Government made repeated complaints to the Bombay Government and to the British Charge d^Aaffairs at Tehran against Mr. Bruce, the Resident at Bushehr, and pressed strongly for his recall. The most important charge against him was one of having interfered in Bahrain to effect a reconciliation between the Shaikh and the Sultan of ? Oman, and of having thus frustrated the policy of the Prince-Governor of Fars at the very moment when the Sultan of ; 0man was about to take part with him in a joint invasion of Bahrain. It was added, in one of the quaintly worded accusations, that Mr. Bruce had also ' stipulated for the motion of a standard on that island/* by which the hoisting of the British flag seemed to be meant. To these allegations Mr. Bruce was able to reply that the Sultan of ; Oman had in deed come to a settlement with the Shaikh of Bahrain prior to the depar ture of the British armament from the Gulf, but that he personally had bad nothing to do with it, being fully occupied on his single visit to Bahrain during the expedition in obtaining the surrender of some piratical vessels; and that the British flag, as was well known, had never been hoisted there. A second charge referred to the alleged loss, in a storm, ^ U Lingeh boats which had been seized by Captain Loch of H.M.S. ' Eden ' on suspicion of piracy shortly before the expedition, Mid a third to the destruction by the British of some native vessels ^barak, possibly in connection with the ' Ahmad Shah' case : 111 both of these instances, it was apparently contended, the proceedings Good treat ment of the survivors of the 'Ariel' by the Shaikh of Kharag, 1820. Complaints by the Persian authorities against Mr. Bruce, the British Resident at Bushehr, 1820-21.1936 Scheme of the Bombay Government or establish ing a British station in a i central posi tion in the Gulf, 1819- were wrongful and had been instigated by Mr. Bruce^ though he was not himself present on either occasion. The gravamen of the complaint; however^ evidently lay in the article relating to Bahrain. The opinion of the Government of India in the matter, when it eventually came before them, was that Mr. Bruce's conduct had been perfectly correct throughout^ and that his removal from Bushehr on the complaint of the Persian Government could only be regarded as an unworthy compliance with a most unreasonable requisition; but they remarked that his transfer elsewhere^ if it were desired for other reasons or would be agreeable to Mr. Bruce himself^ should not be treated as barred by the consideration mentioned. In 1822 the Government of Bombay directed payment of compensation to the owners of the Lingeh and Charak boats mentioned in this paragraph. Even before the sailing of the expedition of 1819 from India^ the Government of Bombay had in view the establishment^ subsequently to the operations against Ras-al-Khaimah^ of a British naval and military base in the Persian Gulf, in a situation more central and commanding than either Bushehr or Basrah. Such a station, it was thought, would facilitate the repression of piracy in the future; and Sir W. G # Keir was instructed to recommend a suitable spot, after special consideration of the facilities afforded by Qishm and Hanjam, and to report whether the British Political Residency- 7 in the Persian Gulf might not with advantage be transferred from Bushehr to the place selected. The experience obtained in the course of the expedition corroborated the impression of the Bombay Government as to the advantages of an island base in the vicinity of the piratical ports ; and it seems to have been the unanimous opinion of all the political; naval and military officers employed in the Gulf that without some such station the complete eradication of piracy would be impossible. Sir W. G. Keir, however, while he approved of the scheme generally; deprecated the immediate removal of the British Residency fro 131 Bushehr, and suggested that it should be allowed to remain where it was until trade, in consequence of the creation of the new settlement, bad fallen naturally into other channels. At the request of the Government of Bombay the project for a British naval and military base was unfolded to the Shah by Sir Willock, the British Charge d^Affaires at Tehran; but it was evidently most unpalatable to His Persian Majesty, who refused a personal inter view on the subject and caused his reply to be communicated to the British representative by his ministers. His answer was, in effect, that1937 the request of the British for an island was no new things and that it had been refused many years before ; that it was a matter too weighty for settlement through a Charge d'Affaires and ought to have been raised by His Britannic Majesty, by the Hon'ble East India Company, or by His Excellency the Governor-General of India in another manner; and that its discussion had better be postponed until the arrival of a British Ambassador who, according to a report received from the Persian Minister in London, was about to be deputed to Persia on the part of the Prince Regent. The later developments of the scheme for a central base will appear from the next paragraph. From the first it had been assumed by the Government of Bombay Negotiations apparently on the strength of a claim by their ally Saiyid Sa'id, that wit . h ,^ erBia an( * Oman Qishm was a dependency of the Oman Sultanate ; and that island was and location appointed as the rendezvous of the expedition against Ras-al-Khaimah ^rriso^lt in 1819. It was anticipated, however, that Persia might entertain a ^Q 11 competing claim to the sovereignty of Qishm, and that she would in any case object to the establishment of a permanent British garrison on the island, should it be selected as the site of the proposed station. Sir H. Willock was accordingly consulted as to the attitude of the Persian Gov ernment, and as to the extent to which it would be advisable to defer to their wishes in the matter of Qishm ; and the result was an application by him which ended, as already described, in a refusal by the Shah to discuss the question of the occupation of a Persian island by a British force until the arrival of an Ambassador expected from England. The Shah, it should be added, claimed Qishm as a Persian dependency and expressed much surprise at the pretensions advanced by the Sultan of ■'Oman. The British Charge d ; Affaires was informed of the answer to his reference by the Persian ministers on the 5th May 1820. Meanwhile, however, it was decided that the captured town of Eas-al- Khaimah was unsuitable, chiefly on account of difficulties in regard to drinking water, as a permanent post for the garrison of one native battalion or more which it had been resolved to keep in the Gulf, to control piracy, after the return of the expeditionary force to India; the immediate transfer of the Eas-al-Khaimah garrison to Qishm was strongly recommended by Sir W. G. Keir. The Government of Bombay accordingly, ordered Captain Thompson, the political and military officer ln C ^ ar ^ e permanent garrison, to remove to Qishm after making the pred arrangements with the Sultan of ^Cman, whom, on the strength 1321938 of his own assertions, they had decided to treat as the owner. On the 29th May 1820, or a few days after the Shah's refusal at Tehran, the Mercury' arrived at Ras-al-Khaimah from Masqat bringing the written permission of Saiyid Sa'id for the location of the British troops on Qishm, and an open letter from him to the Shaikh or Governor of the island in which that authority was directed to assist them with boat transport and supplies. In a letter addressed to the Governor of Bombay the Saiyid remarked ;— With regard to the observations made by you, connected with the removal of the troops from Eas-ul-Khima to Kishm, God knows that the island in question and all other territories appertaining to me, and subject to my authority, appertain also to the Hon'ble Company, and that I do not reckon these dominions as appertaining to me, but as appertaining to the Hon'ble Company. The British ' detachmentas after this (notwithstanding its strength) it was generally styled, disembarked at Qishm town on the 20th July 1820. Removal of Only a few days after the landing at Qishm, Captain Thompson the British recommen( Jed the removal of the detachment to Dairistan on the southern aetacnment ^ # , from Qishm coast of the island opposite to Hanjam, a place which he depicted as a healthier than Qishm town and more conveniently situated for watching the Pirate Coast on the other side of the Gulf ; and he at once took steps, in anticipation of sanction, to provide hospital and other accommodation at Dairistan. His recommendations were accepted by the Bombay Govern ment without hesitation, and were carried into effect. In October 18^0 preparations were already in progress for the relief of the Indian battalion on Qishm by another, 800 strong, from Bombay. The facts seem to point to tie prevalence of sickness among the troops in garrison. Two or three months after the transfer of the Ras-al-Khaimah Persian Gov- g arr i son ^i^ 111 tad been actually carried out, the Governor of Bombay ernmenfc in wrote to Sir H. Willock at Tehran suggesting that he should not renew BntisVoccu- the discussion with the Persians regarding the status of Qishm, and that; potion of^ ^ if the Persians on their part should come forward with proofs of owner- 21, m ' ship, he should endeavour to gain time by referring their arguments to Bombay. A short interval, he thought, would be enough to convince the Shah of the good effects of the British occupation and bring him to consent to its continuance, even in the event of his sovereignty being satisfactorily established. In December 1820, however, some of the principal officers of the Government of Fars reached Tehran, having been sent thero by the Farman-Parma for the purpose of reporting the British occupatio 11 town to Dairistan, 1820. Difficulties with thef to' 1939 of Qishm and of representing it in a dangerous light. The machinations of the Prince-Governor were so successful that the Shah was persuaded to remit, by way of conciliating the dwellers near the Gulf coast, a con siderable part of the ordinary revenue of Dashtistan, —in other words to reduce his financial demands upon the Government over which the Prince presided. Sir H. Willock, with some difficulty, restrained the Persian Government from * sending an agent of their own to Qishm to order the British detachment away, and from deputing another to Bombay to remonstrate with the Governor against the military occupation ; and the objections of the Persian Government to the action of the British authorities were communicated to him in a formal note, dated 9th Decem ber 1820. The principal arguments contained in the note were that the Sultan of 'Oman, being a vassal of Persia, had no authority of himself to permit foreign troops to land at ]VI asqat, still less on Qishm ; and that the presence of a British garrison on Qishm was unnecessary, because the Persian officials could and would do everything that was required to prevent piracy. The note also interpreted the eleventh article of the Anglo-Persian treaty of 1814 as prohibiting the entry of British ships of war into Persian ports without express permission. It would seem that the Government of Bombay, with reference to this note, merely requested Sir H. Willock ' to seize every opportunity of impressing on the Court of Tehran the absolute necessity of a station such as Kishm to keep down piracy, and its perfect harmlessness with reference to the dominions of After this a Vakil from the Prince-Governor of Fars appeared on Vi«»it of a and informed Captain Deschamps, the officer commanding there, irisoa. ^ ^ ^ een sei1 ^ prohibit the building of forts by the British,— ernor of Us-alft' 1 aI1 operation which at Shiraz was stated to be in progress.

Willoek'i 132 a1940 Mission of Dr. Jukes to Persia with reference to the Britisli occupation of Qishm and Iris report on the title of the ISultan of Oman to that island, 1821, A rumour was also current at this time that the Farman-Farma had ordered forces amounting in all to 16^000 men to be collected at various points upon the coast, perhaps for an attack upon the British on Qishm, but not very much weight was attached to it by the British authorities. With a view to allaying the agitation which the presence of the Britisli detachment on Qishm continued to excite. Dr. A. Jukes, who had considerable previous experience of political work in Persia, was despatched by the Government of Bombay to Qishm in May 1821 with authority to visit Shiraz, and even^ if Sir H. Willock approved, to prolong his journey to Tehran. The principal object of Dr. Jukes^s mission was to reassure the Prince-Governor of Shiraz with regard to the objects of the British on Qishm ; but he was secretly authorised, in case he found that the Governor could not be diverted from the intentions which rumour attributed to him of attacking Q ishm, to withdraw the detachment to Masqat or to any other place in the territory of the Sultan of ^Oman of which His Highness might approve. He was also instructed to answer the Persian complaints against Mr. Bruce. Dr. Jukes proceeded by Masqat to Qishm, where he learned that a mission from Shiraz to Bombay on the same subject had crossed his own, the Persian commissioner who had just left for India being Mirza Muhammad Baqir. During a short stay on Qishm, where, as also in other parts of Persia and Arabia, cholera was at this time raging, Dr. Jukes made careful enquiries regarding the history of the island and the validity of the title asserted by the Sultan of ; Oman. He then left for Shiraz. As his investigations were conducted chiefly under the auspices of ^Omani officials, whose statements he would naturally be inclined to accept his report, dated 14th August 1821, can hardly be regarded otherwise than as an ex parte document, but as such it is of interest. It stated *that the island of Qishm had been wrested about 70 or 80 years previously from Mulla 5 Ali Shah, the representative of the Shah of Persia, by Shaikh ■'Abdullah of the Bani Ma^in, a tribe formerly settled at Kung near Lingeh, and that Shaikh 'Abdullah had thereafter farmed Bandar ; Abbas and its dependencies from Nadir Shah, a privilege which was continued See however Chapter I, pages 96, 100 and 110, from which it does not appear that Shaikh 'Abdullah (doubtless identical with'Abdul Shaikh) or the Bani M'ain chiefs ^ J came after him ever held Bandar 'Abbas in farm. Shaikh 'Abdullah died in j75 ^ aD t Qishm was then lost lo the Bani M'ain until 1763, when they recovered Laft. ^ happened in Qishm after the withdrawal of the British Agency from Banda 1 ' in 1763 cannot be ascertained.1941 crossei I eing ij to his successors by later rulers of Persia. About 1794 or 1795 the people of Qislim, being dissatisfied with the tyrannical government of Mulla Husain, chief of the Bani Ma'in, invited Saiyid Sultan to annex their island with the others near it to his own dominions, whereupon that ruler came with a military force and seized Qishm, Hormuz and Bandar 'Abbas ; over the first of which at least he and his successors had ever since exercised a general control. The Sultan of ^Oman, though he had taken Bandar 'Abbas by force of arms, consented to farm it and its dependencies from the Persian Government, as the Bani Ma'in had done before him; but he paid nothing to Persia for Qishm, Hormuz or Larak, all of which he claimed as his own absolute property. Persian Farmans relating to the lease of Bandar bbas and its dependencies to the Sultan of ^Oman were said to exist, but Dr. Jukes was unable to obtain a view of them. At the time when he wrote, the annual rent paid by the Sultan for the Bandar ''Abbas fief was 4,000 Tumans a year, and the lease certainly included Shamil, Mmab, and Khamir. Saif-bin- Nabhan, an Arab; was Governor of Bandar ^Abbas on behalf of Saiyid Sa'id; and Saifs younger brother was in charge of Hormuz. The Governor of Qishm under the Sultan was Shaikh ^Abdur Rahman, Ma'ini, who was connected with Saiyid Sa^id himself by marriage. Upon the whole Dr. Jukes seems to have considered that the Sultan of 'Oman had a good right, founded on conquest, to the sovereignty of Qishm ; but at the same time he was not prepared to deny that both it and the other islands might be dependencies of Bandar 'Abbas. The claim of Persia to a general suzerainty of'Oman he scouted as ridiculous, suggesting that the Shah might as well lay claim to Delhi as to Masqat. On arrival at Shiraz Dr. Jukes had several interviews with the Prince-Governor ; and in a letter, dated 25th October, he wrote that His Royal Highness had claimed Qishm as belonging to Ears, and the Sultan of 'Oman as a vassal of the Shah. The Prince, however, had added that, as the presence of a British detachment on Qishm appeared from Dr. Jukes's explanations to have the peace and tranquillity of the Gulf for its only motive, he had personally not the slightest objection to its remaining there, and that he would inform the Shah and his minis- fas ters of his sentiments in this respect. On the 10th November 1821 Dr. Jukes died of cholera at Shiraz. The Government of Bombay did not think it necessary to appoint a successor to him, but asked Sir H. Willock to undertake what remained red ^executed of his instructions and to solicit the permission of the Persian Government, on account of the prevailing cholera, to remove the British1942 detachment on Qishm to the island of Qais. It is not stated what steps* were taken in these matters by the British Charge d J Affaires. Transfer of The transfer of the British detachment to Dairistan had cost Rs. 35,000 deta^ment mai ^ ae transport alone ; but the failure of the water-supply of fclie from Dairis- new cantonment^ which was dependent on wells ; soon made a return town^Sala^h t0 town necessar y- The exact date of this second movement of and finally' ' troops is not ascertainable. ^ ^ ie en( ^ t roo P s being then back at Qishm town, where they presented a melancholy picture' of sickness t and consequent inefficiency, the commanding officer Captain Kennett, made a fresh endeavour to find a healthier situation. At the beginning of January 182^ accompanied by a Master Attendant and by Assistant Surgeon Reach, whose duties were to report on the marine and sanitary aspects respectively of each site examined, he made a tour round the island, visiting every place which was said to possess good water. The former cantonment of Dairistan, the village of Salagh, 15 miles to the westward of it, and Basidu at the extreme western end of the island were the places principally considered ; but Captain Kennett also made a voyage to the island of Tunb, which he found to be ineligible for occupation on account of the scantiness and badness of the water-supply. In the end he selected Salagh, though the position there was not a good one from a military standpoint; and in February 1822 he carried out the transfer on his own responsibility by means of two vessels hired at d favourable rate. Some movement seems to have been already under contemplation by the Government of Bombay, who readily approved of Captain Kennett's action. Even the materials of the barracks and hospital were transported along with the troops from Qishm town to the new station. The consent of the Sultan of 'Oman was duly requested for the migration* A few days' experience of Salagh showed, however, that the anchorage there was too exposed for shipping ; and the movement of the force was continued to Basidu, which thus became, as it still remains, a British ♦ But we know that in October 1S22 Lieutenant J. H. Grubb of the Cori.paiiy'« Marine and Captain Remon of the Bombay Engineers reported on the huitability of Qai s for a British station (see Bombay Selections XXIV, pp. 46 - 48); and Lord Curzon iPersia, Volume II, page 406), states that there was for a time a British military settlement on (jais. fDr. Jukes had already remarked on this in August 1821 and expressed grave doubts as to the advisability of maintaining a garrison on Qishm. The summer heat was to he u^t f^du^^ 11 ^ m0nt ^ S of tbe year the men were so prostrated by it asffo4 1943 station. I 11 October 18^^ a report on Basidu was furnished by Captain T Remon oi: the Bombay Engineers, probably under instructions from Government. The Shah unfortunately proved less accommodating in regard to Further dis- the occupation of Qislim Island by British troops than the Prince- ^v^aan^ 11 Governor of Shiraz had shown himself in his conversations with Dr. withdiawal of Jukes. He even insisted positively on the withdrawal of the detach- detachment ment and the utmost concession to which he would agree was that the result of a mission which he proposed to send to the British Court should be awaited. In these circumstances the advisability of maintain ing the Qishm garrison was elaborately discussed by the Government of Bombay ; and, though they feared that a retirement would cause a revival of piracy in the Gulf, they eventually advised withdrawal. The reason for their recommendation was that the good relations of the British and Persian Governments, which were of greater general import ance than the quietness of the Persian Gulf ; appeared to be endan gered by the feelings with which the Shah regarded the presence of the British on Qishm. They advised that care should be taken, in removing the troops, not to say anything by which the claim of the Sultan of ^Oman to the island could be adversely affected ; and they urged that the garrison, on leaving Qishm, should be withdrawn from the Gulf alto gether, as its continuance at any place upon either coast would sooner or later involve the British Government in the politics of the adjoining countries. These views were approved by the Government of India and were about to be carried into effect when information was suddenly received via Bushehr of an apparently serious disagreement between the Shah and the British Charge d'Affaires, in consequence of which the latter had thought it necessary to quit the Persian Court. The causes of this unpleasantness are indicated as having been partly the discouragement by l ord Londonderry of the Shah^s proposed mission to the King, till the accomplishment of which the Shah had agreed to suspend his demand for the evacuation of Qishm, and the attitude assumed by Persia towards the Porte; but it is probable that there v\ere also * personal elements in so f ■^ e following passage in Kawlinson's ^England and Russia in the East (page W a PP ears t® re fer to this incident i\ n of Ve n0 ^ f or gotten that a personal misunderstanding between Sir H. Willock w the Shah led to i he temporary wit) drawal of our Mission from the Court; bui e occasion of the rupture was so entirely accidental, and the effects of it Were so aDsient, that it cannot be considered to affect the general character of our relations uimg the pcriQd i n question. 'When our truant Minister, indeed, reported himself ma e f f ( !!' eign ^® ce » Canning is said to have observed 'Henry Willock P I know a w tM name at Teheran, but certainly not in London,' a remark which sufficiently attach't 0: ^ the quarrel, and censured the undue importance that had been1944 the quarrel. It was rumoured at the same time that the Shah had demanded I^000 Tumans of annual rent from the Sultan of ^Onian for Bandar ^ Abb as and its dependencies (along with Qishm) in place oftlie 4,000 hitherto paid, that Persian troops were being assembled at Bandar ^Abbas, and that the Sultan of ''Oman was daily expected at Qisbn. The whole crisis was somewhat sudden, for Sir H. Willcock, who up to the 21st of March had expected no serious difficulty, demanded his passports upon the 29th; and the situation, as viewed from India, appeared so grave that the Bombay Government, who considered that Qishm could not for the present be abandoned without loss of credit, authorised a number of naval and military precautions. These included the despatch of 400 Europeans and an officer of Engineers for the pur pose of rendering Lieutenant-Colonel Kenneths position at Basidu more secure. In June, however, before the steps ordered had ^actually been taken, news of the amicable adjustment of the differences between the Shah and the British representative reached Bombay, whereupon the orders for strengthening Basidu were cancelled and the preparations for evacuating it were resumed. It was too late to recall the despatches informing the British Charge d ; Affaires in Persia of the intended reinforcement of the Basidu garrison and other measures ; but a candid explanation of the circumstances by Major G. Willock, the Secretary in Charge of the British Mission at Tehran, after receipt of the despatches, was accepted by the Persian ministers in the spirit in which it was given. No actual steps were taken at Basidu, and no further reference to the subject became necessary. The exact date of the ultimate evacuation of Basidu does not appear, but references in official correspondence show that it must have taken pla ce between the 20th November 1822 and the 12th January 1823. It seems to have been carried out by Lieutenant-Colonel Kennett, who had com manded there for some time, with the assistance of Lieutenant Macleod, the officer who had just been appointed, in circumstances presently to he described, to succeed Lieutenant Bruce as Kesident at Bushehr. Rahmah- bin-Jabir, the celebrated pirate of Qatar, was said to have given lively expression to his joy on hearing of the removal of the British detach ment ; but the new Resident was hopeful that a squadron of cruisers, which the Bombay Government had arranged to substitute for the military P 08 ^ on Qishm, would prove no less efficacious for maintaining the tranquil* lity of the Gulf. The retirement from Qishm was made in communic^* tion with the Sultan of 'Oman, under whose authority the island hadf*or 1945 been occupied^ and who was most anxious that the British should not abandon it. From the fact that there was never any demand for the services of the g-arrison against pirates during its presence in Qishm, and that its departure was not followed by any recrudescence of piracy, we may perhaps conclude that it was in fact superfluous. We must now refer to a vagary, so preposterous as to be almost in- credible, committed by the British Resident at Bushehr; and the light in which it exhibits the character of Lieutenant Bruce is such as to make us wonder in what manner the general business of the Residency was conducted by that gentleman during his substantive tenure of office from 1811 to 1822. Apparently in 182*2, an Envoy named * Mirza Bangar or Bunghir was sent by the Prince-Govern or of Shiraz to the Governor of Bombay for the purpose of clearing up all misunderstandings which existed between the Governments of India and Persia : he was received at Bombay ff with every mark of respect and consideration.' Mr. Bruce was then at Bombay, having possibly been summoned to head-quarters in connection with the charges made by the Persians against him, and these seem to have been discussed in his presence and that of the Persian Envoy, and to have been disproved or explained to the satisfaction of all tW theifl* Mr. Bruce after this returned to Bushehr as Resident; and thence, at the request of Hasan 'Ali Mirza, the Prince-Governor of Fars, he travelled to Shiraz. The Government of Bombay, when they became aware of the invitation that Mr. Bruce had received and of his intention of accepting it, expressed disapprobation ; but their letters reached him too late to prevent the mischief which followed. Mr. Bruce, on his arrival at Shiraz, was induced to discuss with Zaki Khan, the chief minister of the Farman-Farma, an Agreement which the Fars Govern ment were anxious to conclude with the British Government. On the 8th August 1822 he was weak enough to accept the terms which were pressed on him by Zaki Khan and others ; and on the 30th of the same month he went so far as to execute on behalf of the Government of Bombay, though he had no t authority to do so, a formal document * Unless, which seems hardly probable, this Envoy was the Mirza Muhammad Baqir who Just missed Dr. Jukes at Qishm in 1821. ' Bunghir ' might be a mistake tor Baughir, which again, in Persia, is a possible corruption of Baqir. t The Government of Bombay were themselves, perhaps, partly to blame for tor. Bmce's mistake. It will be within the recollection of the reader that Mr. Bmce concluded an unauthorised agreement with the Shaikh of Bahrain in 1816 which the Government, far from condemning, apparently quoted as a model in 1819. Unauthorised Agreement concluded by Lieutenant Bruce, Resi dent at Bushehr, with the Prince- Governor of Shiraz, 30th August 1822.1946 which disposed of a number of delicate and important matters. Mr. Bruce then announced his intention of leaving Shiraz with Lieute nant Hart of the Pioneers about the 15th September^ and of marching by a direct route to the coast in the neighbourhood of Basidu. The Agreement related chiefly to Bahrain, and its effect in connection with that principality is described in the history of Bahrain. Here we have to do with its general character and with such of its provisions as bore upon the affairs of the Persian Coast. Even the preamble of tlie document was objectionable, and it is difficult to understand how any British representative could have assented to its terms^ for it laid the blame of the trouble that had occurred upon the British authorities, in the following words:— Two years previous to this it became necessary to suppress the piratical acts committed by the Joasmis, for which purpose troops arrived from India in the Gulf of Persia, and a few acts were committed by them erroneously, which did rot accord with the good understanding existing with this state; in consequence of which His Royal Highness Hussein Mi Mirza deemed it advisable for the good of ids Govern ment to inake known these acts of misunderstanding to the Government appertain* ing, nearest to his own, that they might be aware of svhat had occurred (and) that some explanation might be offered for His Royal Highness to act upon.' The articles of the Agreement with which we are now concerned were the third, the fourth, and the fifth. The third article laid down that such losses as the people of Lingeh and Charak had sustained through the destruction, a by mistake, ^ of their vessels by the British authorities should be made good to them. The fourth referred to the Persian complaints against Mr. Bruce, stating that they were with- drawn, and that the Prince-Grovernor would now prefer his continuance as Resident at Bushehr to the appointment of any other officer. ^ . fifth, which after the Bahrain articles was the most important, ran as follows ;— 5th.

Should His Royal Highness, during the period the British troops are stationed in the Gnlf, require the services of one or two cruisers from the station to proceed to any of the islands or ports oE Persia, they are to be furnished, and particularly so on the present occasions when an expedition as in con- templation against Bahrain to reduce it to obedience. His Royal Highness promising, after the service may be over, to dismiss the vessels with proper honour and respect.

Such vessels and stores as His Royal Highness may require, to be at liberty to purchase them in any of the ports of India without molestation from the Government. No analysis of these articles., which with the rest of the treaty were immediately repudiated by the Government of Bombay, is necessary. It will be enough to quote the severe but not undeserved strictures on Mr. Bruce^s conduct that were conveyed to him by the Secretary to the Govemment of Bombay, in a letter, dated 1st November 182^ :— The Governor in Council directs me to express his surprise that you should have entered on a negotiation with the Prince of Shiraz which was never contemplated hy Government, and for which you were neither furn shed with instructions nor with powers. He observes that the treaty which has been the result of those negotiations is not only unauthorised, but entirely inconsistent with the views of Government and with the cbli^ations of the public faith. 1 he treaty ^rounds your supposed mission on errors of the British Government which have never been admitted, and of which the Governor in Council 'u still uncons cious. It admits the claim of the King of Persia to Kishm, contrarv to all history, to the protestations of His Highness the Imaum of Maskat, and to the repeated declarations of this Government. It thereby admits the occupation of that island without the ,n g of Persia s consent to have been an unjust aggression, and it agrees to admit a Persian force into Kishm, and to make over to the Persians the island which we received from the Imaum. * * # # It places onr voluntary pavment to the sufferers at Lin^ahon the footing of a concession to Persia; and it makes the appointment of a Resident at Bushehr a P 01 D of negotiation with the Prince of Shiraz. ] e ® ec ^ 0 ^this treaty would be to compromise the dignity of the British Govern- en &gt; and to overturn every part of the policy wiiiodi it has adopted in relation to the powers of the Persian Gulf*1948 Appoint ment of Lieutenant McLeod to the Hnshehr Residency, 1822. Arrange* ments on the Persian Coast for the repression of piracy, temporary In conclusion, Captain Bruce was informed that the Gorernor in Council fotmd himself obliged to disavow the treaty in the most explicit terms, and—the more clearly to mark his disapproval of the whole proceedings—to remove Captain Bruce from his appointment as Resi dent at Bushehr and recall him to Bombay. He was directed to make over the Factory at Bushehr to the B/esidency Surgeon, and all instructions relating to the general politics of the Gulf to Lieuten ant-Colonel Kennett, who at this time commanded the detachment at Basidu. To the Prince-Governor of Shiraz the Governor of Bombay wrote expressing his regret at Captain B/uce^s error ; but at the same time lie made the invalidity of the Agreement very plain in the following words ;— It is proper to explain clearly to Your Royal Highness that Captain Bruce had been merely directed to return to his duty at Bushire, and had received no authority to proceed to Sbiraz, and no powers or credentials to enter on any negotiation whatever with Your Royal Highness; the treaty which he has concluded is, therefore,his own act and not that of this Government. I accordingly disavow it, and desire it to he considered exactly as if it had never been written. Captain Bruce was succeeded in the Bushehr Residency by Lieuten^ ant John McLeod of the Bombay Engineers, an officer of much promise who had been employed in the Gulf in various capacities during the British operations there. In his first instructions, dated 12th November 1822, the new Resident was directed to do all that lay in his power to efface from the minds of the Sultan of 'Oman and the Shaikh of Bahrain the unfortunate impressions which Captain Bruce's Agreement had probably produced, and to moderate the resentment which the Prince- Governor of Shiraz might be expected to feel at its repudiation; but his principal duty was to inaugurate a system of purely naval precautions against piracy, which was now introduced in a manner and with results which are described in the history of Tracial 'Oman, The ''permanent local functions ;; of the Resident at Bushehr were defined as exclusively commercial, and as consisting in the protection of British trade and shipping and of British subjects engaged in either. In the case of piracies committed by subjects of Persia inhabiting the Persian Coast, the Resident was instracted in future, in consequence the responsibility lately assumed by the Shah's Oovernment, to confine himself in the first instance to representations to the Farman- Farma of Fars, and, should these fail, to refer to the British Charge1949 Teun: ^Affaires at Tehran ; but the Bombay Government approved of a sugges tion by Captain Faithfull, the Senior Marine Officer in the Persian Guli, that Mughu should be made a place of call for all ships sent from India to the Persian Gulf and a rendezvous for the cruisers employed in the Gulf in the work of supervising the maritime peace, and that a N ative ^o-ent on the part of the Political Eesident at Bushehr should be established ^ere This arrangement was apparently brought into force and a house obtained at Mughu as a stores depot ; but Sir H. Willock, the Charge d ; Affaires at Tehran, soon pointed out that objections would pro bably be raised by the Shah's Government, founded on their interpretation of the eleventh article of the Anglo-Persian Treaty of 1814. Accordingly in the autumn of 1823 the British naval station, for such in effect it was, underwent a transfer by order of the Government of Bombay from Mughu to Basidu. VV hy the latter place should have been regarded as less open than the former to objection by the Persian Government is, in view of their protests against the British military occupation of Qishm, not very apparent. In the spring of 1828, when a joint expedition by the Government of Shiraz, the Sultan of 'Oman and the Shaikh of Qawasim against Bahrain was apprehended. Major Willock was requested by the Govern ment of Bombay to use him influence with the Shah, if he found a favourable opportunity for doing so, in order to prevent it. It was suggested to him, as a line of argument, that, should a disturbance of the peace of the Gulf lead to a revival of piracy, the British Government might be obliged to re-establish a military station in that region. We have already noticed the local revolutions which occurred at Bushehr in 1826-^7 on the capture of the hereditary governor. Shaikh ; Abdur Kasul by the Sultan of 'Oman, and the inconveniences to which the British Residency was exposed in consequence have also been mentioned. The Shah, at an early stage of these affairs, urged the British Envoy at his Court to mediate in the dispute between the Governments of Fars and 'Oman • but Colonel Macdonald felt that he could not do more than communicate to the Government of India a request by His Persian that the Governor-General would be pleased to intercede with i^d Sa'id for the release of the imprisoned Shaikh ; and it does not even whether this message was productive of any result. Neverthe- less &gt; the sudden improvement in the attitude of the Shiraz Govern ment towards the British Residency at Bushehr, about the time of Wonel Stannus's departure and Captain Wilson's arrival, seems to h^ye establish ment of a British naval rendezvous at Mn^hu, and iv-occu pation of BasTdu, 1822-23.

Zaki Khan, the chief adviser of the Prince-Governor, was stated to have been fined 40,000 Tumans for complicity in the disrespect lately shown to the Eesident; and every possible kind of amends for the insults of which the British had to complain was promised by the Shah^s ministers. In connection with the last mentioned offer, a functionary of the Shah^s household named 'Ali Murad Khan was specially deputed to Bushehr, where he had an interview with the Resi dent on the 1st August 1827. He stated that he came armed with full powers to enforce execution of all the Resident's desires ; but Captain Wilson discreetly limited himself to asking that the Shaikh of Bushehr might be informed of the Shah^s wish that the British should be treated with respect, and that orders might be issued to prevent the molestation and detention of British agents and messengers and a tampering with the British mails which had recently become common in various parts of Fars. Another matter discussed with'Ali Murad Khan during his visit to Bushehr was the misbehaviour of J amal Khan, Chief of Dashti, in the case of a Baghlah from Johanna, one of the Comoro Islands, which bad been wrecked upon the coast of his district and plundered by his subjects, two of the crew being moreover, detained as slaves. An officer sent to Dashti by the Prince-Governor of Fars had returned without effecting anything; and Saiyid Hamzah, the owner of the Baghlah, and a servant of the British R esident, both of whom had gone with bim, had narrowly escaped being poisoned. ''Ali Murad Khan, on learning that the vessel had contained some British-owned goods, that the people of Johanna were in amity with the British, and that it was not the custom in the British dominions to plunder wrecked ships, stated that he bad already sent for Jamal Khan and promised to do his utmost to bring about a satisfactory settlement. Before the arrival of 'Ali Murad Khan at Bushehr, some difficulties in regard to British trade there had evidently arisen, leading to a dis cussion among the British authorities themselves as to the rights undei treaty of British traders in Persia. The British Envoy in Persia stated that in his correspondence with the Persian Government he had invariably assumed the Commercial Treaty arranged by Sir John Malcolm to h e still in force, but that he was aware that such was not the view of Persian Government, who contended that it had been annulled by Morier-Ellis Treaty of 1814, which, itself containing' no comin erC ^1951 to liis 1 ^plicitji witli li irmed i| kUj A of | ttke iji and a te urmg 11; Das^iull .s, whicltfl \n officeic e BagWi E d gone lit 3, that tie p» fas BotM tated 3 mm jbr, some® 1 pi'I totkf] voyiiH ohn **, lottte*: a am^! jug provisions, contemplated the conclusion of a fresh Commercial Treaty. The points in regard to which difficulty had been experienced seem to have been first, the occasional levy of Rahdari or road tolls upon British o-ocds in addition to import duty at the port of entry, and, second, undue influence used by the Shaikh of Bushehr to deter native merchants from shipping their goods on British vessels and to compel them to employ his ships. With reference to these matters the Persian Commis sioner undertook, without reference to any treaty, to obtain written papers from the superiors of all Rahdars and from the Shaikh of Bushehr by which the grievances complained of would be removed. A question raised, but fortunately not brought into discussion with the Persian Government, by the events of 1826-27 at Bushehr was that of the practice of granting asylum to Persian refugees in British official buildings in Persia. The only conclusions reached were, apparently, that such protection could not, in view of existing native customs, be altogether refused ; but that it was desirable, so far as might be con sistent with the good name of the British Government, to exercise it with the utmost moderation and so avoid serious political embarrass ments. In the case of Shaikhs Husain and Nasir of Bushehr, who took refuge in the British Residency towards the close of 1826, it was ordered by the Government of Bombay that protection should be continued to them only upon condition of their abstaining from intrigues and from attempts to upset the existing government of Bushehr,—a condition which, as we have seen, they did not fail to violate. It had been suggested at one time, with reference to the recent troubles, that the British Residency at Bushehr should be made defensible and located outside the walls of the town j but the British Envoy at the Shahs Court stated that no such proposal would ever be entertained bv the Persian Government, and he referred to their reasons as being the same' which led to the total destruction of the mansion erected by Captain Bruce, the walls of which were razed to the ground. *' No stepgj therefore, were taken in the matter. On the 28th August 1827, in the absence from Bushehr of the Wtish Resident, an affair took place in the harbour which from the ^olence and haste with which it was conducted on both sides, might have ad regrettable consequences. Captain Betham of the ' Amherst,*' an ^ast India Company's cruiser, having learned that a deserter from his s was hiding on board a Baghlah in the port, sent a midshipman in a eu ttei to bring him back; but the party were repulsed by the crew Question of affording asylum to Persian refugees in British official build ings in Persia, 1827.

Captain Betham then went himself in a boat to the Baghlah, took a man from on board her whom he meant to use as a witness^ and sent his own interpreter Muhammad ^Ali to Shaikh Nasir with his compliments and a request that the deserter might be surrendered. Shaikh Nasir, however, instead of complying, caused Muhammad ^Ali to be severely assaulted and detained him and some lascars belonging to British ships. Captain Betham upon this sent his intended witness on board the ' Clive/^ another Company^ vessel whicli ; with the (&lt; Nautilus,' was present in harbour, and informed the Shaikh that he would keep the man as a hostage for the deserter. He then went ashore with armed boats and caused Shaikh N asir to be informed that, unless he released Muhammad 'Ali and made reparation for his insulting - conduct within two hours, measures would be taken for des troying the &lt;( Rahmani,' a Persian ship, and all of the Shaikhs own vessels. Shaikh Nasir, after some delay, sent Muhammad ; Ali and the other prisoners down to the beach; but the former, who had served the British for twenty years, had had both eyes seriously damaged —an injury for which the Shaikh promised to compensate him. The matter then passed into the hands of the Resident, who had apparently received a complaint from Shaikh Nasir of Captain Betham s behaviour, but it is not known how it terminated. In December 1827 Major Wilson, the Resident at Bushehr^ was ordered to visit several stations in the Gulf with a view to ascertaining which of them would be the most suitable for the reception of the Residency in case of its removal from Bushehr. Major Wilson recom mended Kharag; and in 1828 Sir John Malcolm, Governor of Bombay, whose former opinions in regard to Kharag were well known, expressed I himself in favour of the project of a removal thither. Basldu, which since 1823 had been the principal station for British cruisers in the Gulf, was reported by Major Wilson not to be well situated for a commercial port and to be unsuitable for the site of the Gulf Residency- The principal advantage anticipated at this time from a migration to Kharag was relief from friction with the Persian authorities, arising from petty local matters ; but the question of the proposed removal soon became involved with others relating to the retrenchment of expend iture in the Gulf and the consolidation of the Basrah and Bushed Residencies into one. In this complicated form the scheme lingered on until 1834, when it finally ended in nothing. It should be observed that the question of a transfer to Kharag was not raised by Sir J. MalcoH133 (liQTj 1963 might tave been supposed^ but by his predecessor; and that it pro^ Jbly its origin in the troubles to which the Residency was exposed in 1827' Early in January 1828 indirect overtures for a secret understanding * Applica- ith the British Government were made by Shaikh ^ Abdur Kasul of ■R'shphr to Captain Wilson^ the British Resident; the medium of com- Abdur Rusul Q-f Bushehr munication chosen by the Shaikh was the Mirza of the British Residency. for British The substance of the Shaikh's message to the Resident was that he P^ gugh , was anxious to connect himself in a very close and special manner with the British Government, in fact to be regraded by them as a dependent; that he would enter into any engagements which the Resident might consider expedient; and that he would write a letter to the Governor of Bombay,— at this time Sir J. Malcolm,—to say that whatever the Resident might report should be taken as coming from himself ('Abdur Rasul), and that he would be content to receive the Governor's reply verbally from the Resident. The object of these last precautions was clearly to obviate the necessity of committing his sentiments to paper. Captain Wilson had no doubt that the Shaikh's action was due to the progress of Russian influence in Persia, which he evidently expected to go on increasing, and that he a probably considered it safe policy at all events 'Ho be recognised as on a friendly footing with the British Government, a towards which many in that part of Persia then looked, conceiving ' it deeply interested in the war carried on with Russia and by no means 'unlikely to take an active part in the contestbut at the same time he thought that the Shaikh would not hold himself bound by anything 4 that he might say, and that afterwards, if convenient, he would even M deny having said it. The Resident accordingly endeavoured to dissuade ? the Shaikh from his purpose by assuring him that his friendly feelings l f towards the British Government were well known, and by reminding him ' L of the political alliance between Britain and Persia. The Shaikh in reply d 1 professed entire loyalty to the Shah, but he continued to press the matter , and even alluded to it in a personal conversation with the Resident, so 1 that in the end Captain 'Wilson was persuaded to forward to Bombay a '] closed letter from the Shaikh to the Governor, of the contents of which .J ^ was himself unaware. On the 1st February 1828 the Governor in There is a remarkable parallelism between the conduct of the Shaikh of Bushehr at tbis time and that of the Shaikh of Muhammareh in more recent days. ^Chapter X, page 1755.1954 Council returned the ShaiWs letter unopened to Bushehr^ with an inti mation that Sir J. Malcolm, as one long acquainted with the Shaikh's family, would always be delighted to receive open marks of his friendship for the British Government, but that no communication could be accepted from him in circumstances which indicated that it was in any way in consistent with his allegiance to his lawful sovereign, the ally of the British Government. The Shaikh was further assured that the refusal to entertain his proposals did not proceed in the slightest degree from displeasure with him. A remark was also added as to the dangers of a correspondence such as that on which he had entered, against the con sequence of which, if it should be discovered by the Persian Government^ the Governor of Bombay would be unable to shield him without in- curring suspicion of having countenanced his proceedings. In the spring of 1832 plague prevailed at Bushehr ; and the British Resident, to avoid infection, removed with his whole establishment to Khargu Island, where he remained from the 12th March to the 29th of to 0 Khli U gu elir J UIie * ^ I1 Itasident^s absence the Factory building at Bushehr was 1S32. entered and stripped of the few articles of any value that had been left behind; and in 1833, after his return to Bushehr, a theft was committed by Qawasim in a stone house lined with tent-cloth which he had built for himself at Khargu, with the sanction of Government, during his residence on the island. The proceedings in the latter case are noticed in the history of Trucial' Oman. Claim of the We have seen, in the previous section dealing with events upon the Government l )ers i ai1 Coast, that in November 1832 the Qasimi Shaikh appeared off to British Bushehr in a hostile manner with a large marine force, and that he was against mari- 0I1 ^ to leave without attacking the town by the determined time aggres- attitude of the British Resident. In the following month the Prince* Governor of Fars^ no doubt dreading further naval descents or menaces, wrote to Mr. Blane, the British Resident at Bushehr, insisting that it was the duty of the British under their treaties with Persia to prevent maritime aggressions upon the Persian Coast, and even, it would seefflj blaming him for having allowed the demonstration by Shaikh Sultan- bin-Saqar's fleet against Bushehr. To this communication Mr. Blane judiciously replied that he could not act in foreign affairs except by the orders of the Bombay Government, and that the British Envoy ^ Tehran was the only authority in the country authorised to enter into discussions with Persian officials on the subject of treaties. Temporary removal of the British Residency11(0 j 1955 British trade with Persia by the Persian Gulf, 1797-1834. Under the Zand rulers who followed Karim Khan the foreign trade of Persia by sea declined, as we have seen, to a low level; but in the reign of Fat-h 'Ali Shah, &amp;ajar, partly in consequence of the re-establish- ment of order by his predecessor and himself, and partly perhaps on account of the attention devoted by the Government of India to British commercial interests in Persia, a great and rapid revival took p]ace. In 1813 the East India Company, on the occasion of a renewal of their charter, were deprived of their trade monopoly over the greater part of the East, after which there are few references to mercantile busi ness conducted in the Persian Grulf on their behalf; and in 1822 their political officers in Persia were finally prohibited from engaging in trade. The Mission of Mehdi 'Ali Khan to Persia and his appointment Commercial as British Resident at Bushehr, which have been described already 0 ,^ in their relation to politics, had a commercial side also which at Khan's Mis- the time was considered important: indeed it was explicitly stated in i798-99, eiSia ' Mehdi'Ali Khan's instructions that 'the great object^ of his appoint ment was a the extension of the Company's European imports into Persia and the improvement to the highest possible degree of their selling prices. - ' It appears that, in order to save the Company from loss, it was necessary to dispose of such goods in Persia at 20 to 25 per cent, above the invoice prices, whereas in recent years they had sometimes been sold even below those prices to the great detriment of the Com pany's financial interests. Commission at the rate of 10 per cent, seems to have been allowed to Mehdi 'Ali Khan upon the additional profits' which his employers might derive from his exertions. He was specially directed to purchase Kirman wool at Rs. 6 per bale of 20 Tabriz Mans, and, as he feared that he could not procure so small a quantity as 50 bales (which was the amount desired) at that rate, he was authorised in the first year to remit 100 bales. Mehdi 'Ali Khan was also to prepare lists with full details of amounts and prices, of the European goods vendible in Persia, to serve as a guide to the Company in their operations ; and he was to report on the particulars of the trade carried on by the Russians from the Caspian, with a view to the under selling of their goods, if possible, in the Persian market. Considerable success was obtained by Mehdi 'Ali Khan, during the short period which intervened between his own arrival and that of 133 A1956 Commercial aspect of Captain Malcolm's first Mihsion to Persia, 1799-1801. Captain Malcolm in Persia., in finding a sale for the Company's goods, especially for their woollens; and at the end of 1799 it was reported by the Bombay Government that he had disposed u of all the Company's staples at a price in general as much above the invoice rate as for several years before they had sold below it.' This happy result was probably due in part to improving economic conditions in Persia and in part to the personal influence of the Envoy-Resident Captain Malcolm^s First Mission to Persia had also considerable reference to trade; and he was furnished by the Bombay Government^ at his departure from India, with a quantity of useful information on tbe subject, and with some suggestions as to the objects chiefly to be kept in view in arranging a commercial treaty. Among the documents handed to him was a historical and statistical report by Mr. Maister, Custom Master, and Mr. Fawcett, Accountant-General. dated 17th December 1799; and it was observed by the Government of Bombay that 'not ' much of positive institution is necessary, it being perhaps only requisite a to procure, in behalf of the Company, a confirmation of their several privileges as far as they shall now be recoverable, as specified in the ' said* report; and, in behalf of private merchants, to fix the rates of a duty they shall pay at the different seaports, and to prescribe, with as ' much clearness and certainty as possible, the channel in which com- ' mercial transactions are to be judged and decided on in case of differences, ' and particularly how debts (are) to be recovered.' They added that the Persian trade should be thrown open, so far as possible, to all British and Indian merchants dependent on the Company^ the trade in certain staple articles such as woollens and metals beina* reserved, however, under the Company ; s monopoly, from public competition; but tbey thought that this last restriction could probably be enforced in India by the various Presidencies, and that it need not therefore be embodied in a British treaty with Persia. Captain Malcolm''s commercial report, which was drawn up soon after his arrival in Persia, being dated 26th February 1800, has been examined by anticipation in another place; and the extent to which he was successful in meeting the requirements to which the Bombay Government had drawn his attention appears fro 111 the terms of his Commercial Treaty, which we havef already * Namely Messrs. Maister and Pawcett's report. J See the present Chapter, page 1888.1957 From the remarks o£ Mr. Waring, who visited Persia in 1802, we Persian trade ,, r * the imports of the country at that time were chiefly articles ln of dress and luxury, and that the principal exports were gums, drugs, assafoetida, pearls, rose-water, horses, and a small quantity of wine. The broadcloth in the Persian markets was now of French manufacture, imported through Russia. Many enterprising Persian merchants paid visits to India, where some of them maintained permanent agents, and they even made journeys to Kashmir to purchase shawls; but their annual turnover was small on account of the slowness of their operations. A number of them preferred to invest their capital in shipping rather than in trade. The question of the Persian currency was studiedt by Mr. 'Waring The Persian in 1802 and by Sir H. Jones during a number of years prior to 1811. l8 1 0 1 2 e . n 1 C 1 y, It appears from the observations of the former that the medium wasextremely mixed and consisted to a very large extent of foreign money. Almost the only coins that did not fluctuate in value were the Qursh or Turkish piastre and the Persian gold Tuman, and those in most general circulation were the Qursh and the 'Dutch ducat.' There was a considerable influx of specie from Turkey and Russia; but it was probably more than counterbalanced, as in the time of the Zands, by a steady drain of cash from Persia to India. The gold and silver coins minted in Persia maintained, however, at least until 1811, a remarkable standard of purity, the ? policy of the Shah's Government in this respect being much more enlightened than that of the Porte. It was noticed by Sir H. Jones that the foreign trade of Persia, with Increase in . . _ .. . j. the toreign which he had been conversant since 1784, increased with extraordinary trade of rapidity during the early part of the reign of Fat-h 'Ali Shah. Taking Peisia. one article of importation at Bushehr as an instance, he remarked that the annual demand there for Indian chintz, which at the beginning of Ms acquaintance with the place only amounted to 60 or 70 bales a year, had risen by the year 1811, when he finally left the country, to 500 or 600 bales annually. In 1819, though the East India Company's trade monopoly had The^East been abolished, they still sent goods to Bushehr for disposal Company's on their own account; but for some years past the sales there had been t^dejit^ ^ made periodical, a change attended by successful results, and it was 181 9 # Relieved that ' the necessity for continuing a commercial factory at *See his Tour to Sheeraz, pages 2 and 76 ■ 77. „ tSee Waring's Tour to /S'AeeraiS, pages 128-129, and Brydges Mission, pages 432- 434,1958 Bushirehad thus been done away with ; and that there would no longer be any difficulty in transferring the Residency^ if a transfer were desirable for political reasons, to some other place. This appears to be one of the last references, if not the very latest, to the trade carried on for two hundred years by the East India Company in Persia. We have seen that a Treaty of Commerce between Britain in Persia was succsessfully arranged by Captain Malcolm in 1801 ; but it was not re-affirmed at any later date, and after the conclusion of the Political Treaty of 1814, in the preamble of which it was stated that a separate commercial treaty, would be drawn up the Persian Government contended that the Treaty of Commerce of 1801 had ceased to be in force. In 1823a Farman was obtained from the Shah, with reference to anew duty on the export of horses from the Gulf ports, that no duties should in future be levied on horses or other property or goods belonging to Britisli subjects excepting such as were authorised by long established usage; but this was an insutiicient substitute for a Commercial Treaty, and in 1827 inconveniences which arose at Bushehr in consequence could only be removed, as has already been mentioned, by special temporary arrange* ments. Towards the end of the reign of Fat-h-^Ali Shah it was desired to establish a line for British trade with Persia across Turkey, which made the appointment of British Consuls at certain places in Persia almost necessary; but the Shah was firmly opposed to the scheme, and his objections proved an insuperable bar to the conclusion of a Commercial Treaty.

The East India Company^ official arrangements in Persia during the reign of Eat-h ''Ali Shah, in other words the constitution of the Bushehr Residency and its place in the political organisation of the Persian Gulf from 1797 to 1834, form part of a large question and cannot Well be discussed separately. The facts relating to the Company 's Gulf establishments as a whole will be found in the chapter on the general history of u the Gulf. The missions of Mehdi ''Ali Khan and General Malcolm to Persia, the varying importance oi Masqat, the British expeditions against the Qawasim, and the measures taken after the third Qasimi expedition to prevent a revival of piracy all affected the Bushehr Residency and made its status, until 183o, somewhat fluctuating and uncertain.Inz 1959 MUHAMMAD SHAH, 1834—1848* Fat-h 'All Shah was succeeded by his grandson Muhammad Mirza, tke son of Abbas Mirza, under the style of Muhammad Shah. The earlier years of the new monarch-'s reign were disturbed by a conflict between British and Russian policy in regard to Afghanistan. This conflict led in time, to a secret collision of British and Russian influ ence in Persia, of which an unsuccessful Persian expedition against Herat in 1837-S8 and a crisis in Anglo-Persian relations resulting therefrom were the chief outward indications. The termination of the Anglo- Persian crisis was followed by a period of general quiescence in Persian affairs. Under Muhammad Shah, up to the time of the failure of the Persian attempt on Herat British, Russian and Afghan relations with Persia are so closely interlaced that to separate them is impossible. We are there fore obliged to abandon temporarily our usual division of the subject and to deal with external and internal affairs as a whole under the head of the general history of Persia.

An under standing between the two powers having for its object the maintenance of the integrity and independence of Persia^ even, came into existence in 1834 and was renewed in 1838 ; but it did not ; either then or later, assume the shape of a formal agreement. The funds which Muhammad Mirza required for overthrowing two rival competitors,—namely, his uncle ^Ali Mirza, known as the Zilks- Sultan, and his uncle Hasan ''Ali Mirza, Governor-General of Fars, known as the Farman-Farma,—were supplied by the British Minister at Tehran, Sir J. Campbell, in anticipation of the sanction of Government; and the rapid success of the royal troops was mainly due to the leadership of British officers in the Persian service. Colonel^' Lindsay-Bethune, who commanded the forces of Muhammad Mirza in the ensuing operations, left Tabriz for Tehran on the 10th November 1834; at Qazvinwheret Maniichehr Khan, a Muhammadanised Georgian or Armenian, wlio after wards became notorious as IJersian Governor of ^Arabistan, joined him with a tribal force, all that remained of the Zill-us-Sultanas army sur rendered; and on the 2nd January 1835 Muhammad Shah entered the Persian capital in State. In February 1835 Colonel Lindsay-Bethune moved against the Governor of Fars and completely overthrew in the field, between Isfahan and Shiraz, his numerous army commanded by his brother, the Shuja^-us-Saltaneh : the royal force, though small, liad the advantage in artillery. The Zill-us-Sultan, the Farman-Farma and the Shuja/-us-Saltaneh, all of whom had been captured, were despatched as prisoners to Ardabil, the Shuja-us-Saltaneh being first blinded; but the Farman-Farma died on the way. The Farman-Farma^s sons Kiza Q^ 1 Mirza, Najaf Quli Mirza, and Timur Mirza, the names of two of whom have been mentioned before in connection with Bushher affairs, naade their way to England, where they spent a summer in English society under the guidance of Mr. Baillie-Fraser, the traveller, and were received by His Majesty King William. Their claims to Fars were not, a PP al ently, encouraged by the British Government ; but pensions seem to have been granted them. At Constantinople, where they were found a ^ months later, they met with a bad reception ; and it was only thiono^ * This was the Lieutenant Lindsay whom Malcolm brought with him to ^ ^ .1810.

Thus was Muhammad Shah firmly seated on the throne of Persia; without the aid of Eussia, which had been proffred. Among Muhammad Shah^s principal native supporters was his mater- ]\0 rza nal uncle Allah Yar Khan, styled the Asaf-ud-Dauleh, the head of the Aghasi as Pnme senior branch of the Qajar royal family. This nobleman would fain have Minister. become Prime Minister; but the Shah preferred Haji Mirza Aghasi, a native of Erivan, who had been tutor to the sons of ''Abbas Mirza. The Haji was an eccentric character, and by some has been described as half mad; but he rapidly acquired a commanding influence over his master. The influence of Britain in Persia, notwithstanding the decisive part Respective played by the British representative and by British military officers in the elevation of Muhammad Shah to the throne, was on the decline and Eussia in had been so for some years. The transfer of the British Legation at P ersia - Tehran from His Majesty's Government to the Government of India had alarmed and offended Fat-h ^Ali Shah, who regarded the Indian Govern ment with distrust and considered the change insulting to his dignity; and the modification in 1828 of the Anglo-Persian Treaty of 1814 had destroyed the reliance of the Persian Court on British military aid in an emergency. The virtual control of the regular Persian army still remain ed in British hands; but as a weapon of offence or defence it was useless, for want of military qualities that no training could supply, except against Persian rebels. In the words of Sir H. Eawlinson, who himself had had no small share in organising them, ' the disciplined forces of Peisia were from the epoch of their first creation contemptible/'' Por these and other reasons the policy of Britain in Persia, which was pract'^ eUera ^ e ^ ie countl y by good Government, proved unrealisable in See Mr. J, B. Flaser's Narrative of ihe Residence of the Persian Princes in London, 1838.Designs of Persia upon Herat, 1836. 1962 The Russian position in Persia was greatly superior to the Britisli: it was that of an immediately neighbouring and essentially military which had lately crushed Persia in armed conflict and had dictated of peace. Nevertheless Persia did not readily comply with every Russian demand; and the appointment of Russian Consuls in Persia under tlie Treaty of Turkmanchai had been for sometime successfully resisted. Russia never failed to profess deep consideration for the interests of Persia; but her policy, after the appointment of Count Simonicli to represent Russia at Tehran in 18B3, seemed to be directed to undermin ing such little power as Persia still possessed. The Persian Prime Minister, Haji Mirza Aghasi has generally been credited by British authors, perhaps unfairly, with Russian proclivities; and there is some reason to think that Manuchehr Khan, who was appointed Governor of ^Arabistan in 1839 through Russian influence and who was visited in his camp in the Bakhtiyari country in 1841 by Baron de Bode, the First Secretary of the Russian Legation, was attached to the Russian interest. It will be remembered that Muhammad Shah before his accession had, as Muhammed Mirza, conducted operations against Herat in 1833 and obtained from Kamran, the Afghan ruler of that province, a promise of tribute. The tribute was never paid; and the Shah, apart from an absurd claim which he now advanced to possession of the whole of Afghanistan as far eastwards as Ghazni, had various other causes of disagreement with the Government of Herat, among which was recent interference by them in the disputed frontier district of Sistan. On the whole, however, the intentions of Muhammed Shah with reference to Afghanistan appear to have been ambitious rather than moderate, aggressive rather than justifiable. At length, in the summer of 1836, the Shah set his army in potion towards the east, ill-success in some preliminary operations against the Turkomans of Astrabad caused him, however, to postpone his against Herat until the following year.

On the incidents of this famous, though in itself insigni* ficant siege, which lasted for more than nine months, it is unnecessary to dwell Suffice it to say that it failed largely in consequence of the energy and determination of * Lieutenant E. Pottinger of the Bombay Artillery, who was accidentally present in the town and who did not hesitate himself with its defence; and that Muhammad Shah was to close the campaign without having attained a single one of the more important objects, such as the conquest of Herat or the pay ment of tribute by its Government which he had set out to gain. It is certain that the Eussian Minister at Tehran from first to last actively encouraged the Shah in his designs on Herat. That his instruc tions authorised him to do so was denied by the Eussian Government, who afterwards recalled him; but the fact remains that a Persian I expedition against Herat was well calculated to serve the interests of Eussia. If it succeeded, Eussia would be entitled under the Treaty of Turkmanchai to establish a Consul—in other words a political agent—at Herat, by which means the prosecution of designs in the Indian border land would be facilitated; if it failed of itself, Persia would be exhausted and dis credited and so rendered more amenable to Eussian influence; if it were pre^ vented or frustrated through British intervention, hostility would be created between Persia and Britain of which EuSsia would reap the advan tage. It seems to be the case, moreover, that Count Simonich advanced 50,000 Tumans or about £25,000 to the Shah towards the expenses of the campaign; that he promised, on condition of Herat being taken, that the balance of the war indemnity still due by Persia to Eussia should be remitted; and that he connived at the utilisation against Herat of a regiment of Eussian deserters in the Persian service commanded by a Colonel Samson. The interests of Britain, on the contrary, were certain to be adversely affected by a Persian attack on Herat. The benefit to Eussia from such an attempt, whatever the issue, meant a corresponding loss to Britain of lieutenant Eldred Pdttinger had no official mission to Herat. He had been encouraged by his uncle Colonel (afterwards Sir H.) Pottinger, the British Resident in j 11 j to undertake a private journey of exploration in Afghanistan, but he intended to Pace the information obtained at the disposal of Government. (It will be remembered a 0 ^ 011e l Pottinger was himself one of Malcolm's young officers; as such he and a ptain Christie had travelled from India to Persia by land in disguise in 1809-10.) ^tenant E.

There were also moreim. mediate considerations of a serious kind suggested by the state of Afghanistan, where rival members of the Barakzai family now held Kabul and Qandahar; while the chief representative of the Sadozai dynasty, which the Barakzais had supplanted in the other provinces, but which still survived at Herat was a political pensioner in India. Dost Muhammad Khan of Kabul and Kuhndil Khan of Qandahar were thus drawn, in their circumstances not unnaturally, into with the Shah of Persia for joint action against Herat, nt which actually resulted, in the case of the Qandahar Sardar, in an agreement with Persia concluded under Russian auspices. The prospect of the rulers of Afghanistan being allied, permanently or even tem porarily, with the Persian Court, where Russian influence at this time reigned supreme, was not one that Anglo-Indian Statesmen could con template with indifference. On the 6th April 1838* Dr. McNeill, the British Minister at Tekaiij arrived in the Persian Camp, where, after protesting to the Shah against the expedition, he tendered his good offices as a mediator. The offer was at first accepted by both sides, and the difficulties between Tehran and Herat seemed in a fair way to adjustment by British mediation in accordance with the Anglo-Persian treaty of 1814. At this juncture Count Simonich, the Russian Minister, arrived in the Shah^s camp and persuaded him to reject the aid of Dr. McNeill, after the latter had actually visited Kamran within the walls of Herat in his capacity as mediator. There was already a serious case pending between the British Lega tion and the Persian Government, arising out of the unceremonious treatment by the Persian authorities in October 1837 of a Persian courier of the British Legation whom they had arrested, stripped, and deprived of letters from Herat addressed to the British Minister. For this outrage no reparation or even apology had yet been obtained, and it was believed to have been committed expressly in order to degrade the British represent ative in the public eye, and so to weaken the effect of his opposition to the Herat campaign. The persistent refusal of the Shah to enter into a ^Dr. McNeill (afterwards Sir John McKeill, G.C.B.j, was born in 1795 an( 1883.

W1 The above and other points were accordingly raised by Dr. McNeill • formal communication addressed to the Shah at the invitation of that potentate, who now pretended that all he required was a sufficient retext for raising the siege of Herat. But the Persian reply, while it contained some ostensible concessions, was wholly unsatisfactory. It 'ected as an infringement of Persian independence. Dr. McNeilFs intimation of the disapproval with which the Herat expedition was regarded by the British Government. Ontbe 7th June 1838 the British Minister quitted the Persian camp. About the beginning of August, having received special instructions from London, he sent Colonel Stoddart of the Persian service back to the Shah with a verbal message to the effect that 'the enterprise in which His Majesty was engaged was looked upon by the Queers Ministers as being undertaken in a npirit of hostility towards British India, and as being totally incompatible with the spirit and intention of the alliance between Great Britain and Persia/' and that ' the Queen's Government would look upon the occupation by Persia of Herat, or any portion of Afghanistan, in the light of a hostile demonstration against England/'' A British military expedition, despatched from India, had in the meanwhile, as will be related more fully in another place, occupied the Persian island of Kharag in the Persian Gulf; and almost simultaneously a grand assault upon Herat, advised and arranged by Count Simonich, had resulted in a disastrous repulse. Rumours of an impending British advance into Afghanistan from India, in the Sadozai interst, had since then begun to paralyse the partisans of the Shah, while they inspired with new courage the Sadozai defenders of Herat; and Muhammad Shah judged it expedient to yield to the representations of which Colonel Stoddart was the medium. On the 9th September 1838 the Persian army commenced its retirement from Herat • but Ghorian still remained in the possession of the Persians. A number of serious questions between Britain and Persia, including two that had their origin in the Persian Gulf, still remained to be adjusted; and the history of their settlement, which hardly belongs to the general history of Persia, will be found in the section below on British relations. Here it is enough to say that diplomatic intercourse between Britain and Persia was for a time virtually suspended, and that a complete understanding was not reached until 1841.

We have seen that in* 1817 some trouble had arisen at Yazd througk the death there, by violence, of the head of the Isma/Ili sect, that steps had been taken by the Shah of the day to appease the indignation of Lis followers. In 1838, about the time that Muhammed Shah withdrew from her abortive operations against Herat, Agha Khan, who liad succeeded to the headship of the Isma/illian, rose against the Persian Government, after sending his family for safety to Karbala: he appa rently claimed the supreme power in Persia for himself. After some successes and reverses in the districts of Kirman and Lar he fled to the country, escaped by land to Baluchistan, and appeared at Karachi in 1843, eventually making Western India his permanent home. In 1844 his brother Sardar Khan invaded Persia from Baluchistan and for a time held Bampur, but in the end surrendered to the Persian authorities and was made a prisoner. A sanguinary conflict at Bampur between Persian troops and the Baluchi inhabitants, was part of the aftermath of this rebellion. The Eussian Government affected to believe that the Isma/ili rebels had been supplied with arms, ammunition, money, and even artillery from Bombay. A religious heresy which was destined to produce serious political consequences in Persia made its appearance during the later years of Muhammad Shah : this was Babism, the creed of the Babis or followers of the Bab. The founder was Saiyid 'Ali Muhammad, the son of a grocer of Shiraz, who, being sent as a youth to represent his father at Bushehr, soon left that place on pilgrimage to Makkah and afterwardsfsat as a student at the feet of Haji Saiyid Kazim, the greatest Mujtahid of the day at Karbala. On the death of his teacher he returned to BuslA where he proclaimed himself a pronhet, the 33rd May 1844 being accounted the date of his manifestation in that character. ff tHe now assumed the title of the Bah, or gate, through whom know- legde of the Twelfth Imam Mahdi could alone be attained. His pretensions * Vide page 1864. t Lord Curzon's Persia, Volume I, page 497.1967 flelimk nt doubtedly became more extravagant as time proceeded, and lie succes- * v ely announced himself as the Mahdi, as a re-incarnation o£ the prophet and as a Revelation or Incarnation of God himself/'' The Babi faith was ecclesiastically proscribed throughout Persia ; and massacres of its adherents, with counter-assassinations of leading persecutors, became the order of the day. The internal administration of Haji Mirza Aghasi, the all powerful Misgovern-^ Prime Minister of Muhammad Shah during his entire reign, was MTrza^ execrable. ' Self-sufficient almost to fatuity; utterly ignorant of statesmanship, of finance, or of military science, yet too vain to receive ins truction, and too jealous to admit of a co-adjutor; brutal in his language ; insolent in his demeanour; indolent in his habits ; he brought the exchequer to the verge of bankruptcy, and the country to the brink of revolution. Alienating at the outset of his career fully one-half of the revenues of the Empire in extravagant grants to pampered courtlings, personal dependents, upstarts and empirics, he consumed the remainder in amusing the military mania of the Shah, for whose edification he prepared a park of about 1,000 pieces of artillery, and commissioned above half a million of English muskets. At the commencement of 1848, the Government paper and it must be remembered that the finance of Persia is carried on entirely by a system of assignments —was at ninety per cent, discount. The pay of the army was generally from three to five years in arrears. The cavalry of the tribes was almost annihilated. The intense animosity of the Toorks and Persians had reached a climax which crippled the means of action of the provincial Governors, and threatened to produce complete disorganization. With the exception, , of Azerbijan, in which the whole wealth oE the empire had become well concentrated by the constant return of its inhabtants laden with the spoil of the provinces, Persia generally presented the appearance of a country occupied in force by a foreign enemy The best that can be said of him is that he paid some attention to sericulture and to public works. The important province of Khurasan was governed for many years by the ShaVs maternal uncle, Allah Yar Khan, the Asaf-ud-Dauleh, who had heen in the beginning a candidate for the Prime Ministership and whose relations with his successful rival, Haji Mirza Aghasi, were always of the worst. For political reasons the Governorship of Khurasan and the guardianship of the shrine of Imam Eiza at Mashhad were in general Affairs of Khurasan. Hawlinson's England and Russia in the East, page 72.1968 carefully separated, in order that the one high dignitary might act as a check upon the other; but the Asaf-ud-Dauleh, by exchanging the former for the latter office, while at the same time he secured the appointment of his son, the Salar, as his successor in the Governorship, succeeded in com bining the tenure of both posts in the hands of his own family. This triumph profited him little, however, for he was soon superseded in the custodianship of the shrine, summoned to Tehran, and sentenced to pass the remainder of his days in exile at Makkah and Karbala. The Salar soon after rebelled against the Persian Government; but Hamzah Mirza, a brother of the Shah, after a campaign full of vicissitudes, drove him across the Persian border into the country of the Turkomans, where he took up his residence. Death of Muhammad Shah, who had long been a martyr to gout, and some of w ^ ose political errors may no doubt be attributed to physical pain, breathed his character, his last on the 4th September 1848 at the age of 39. In the earlier years of his reign his ruling passion was military glory and he displayed consi* derable energy; but he had sunk, ere his death, into an obese, feeble minded dotard, whose chief pastime was to shoot at sparrows with a pistol. Relations of Persia with Turkey, 1838-1848. Tension, which more than once threatened to resolve itself in war, was the chief characteristic of Perso-Turkish relations during the reign of Muhammad Shah. Among its principal causes were the temporary occu pation and pillage of the disputed town of Muham march by the Turks m 1837, when the Shah's attention was absorbed by his enterprise against Herat; the rival claims by Persia and Turkey to Salaimaniyah ; and other frontier squabbles which arose from the undelimited state of the common frontier. A general massacre at Karbala in 1843, in which many Persian subjects were slain by Turkish troops, very nearly caused an explo 81011 after it had been decided in principle, to settle all frontier disputes by peaceful means. These events, as also the Commission and Treaty 0 Erzeroum (1843-47), by which Britain and Russia succeeded in averting war between the Shah and the Sultan, are so fully described in the chapter on Turkish 'Iraq that it is enough merely to mention'them here.mr 'Mt; 1969 Relations of Persia with other States in the Persian Gulf, 1838-1848. During the reign of Muhammad Shah difficulties more than once arose between the ruler of 'Oman and the representatives of the Shah in the Persian Gulf; and Persian interests were involved^ or were supposed by the Persian Government to be involved, in disputes which took place over the sovereignty of Bahrain. None of the matters thus raised were of real importance to Persia, however; and it will be sufficient to refer, in this place, to the accounts that are given of them in the histories of the 'Oman and Bahrain. Relations of Russia and Persia, 1838-1848. The relations of Eussia with Persia during the remainder of Muham mad Shah's reign presented no remarkable features, if we except the mea sures which she took jointly with Britain, as already mentioned, in securing an adjustment of dangerous questions pending between the Persian Government and the Porte. About 1840, however, Eussia took possession of the Persian island of Ashwadah in the Caspian, where later she established a small naval base on pretext of restraining the Turkoman raiders of the adjacent coasts. Her action in this quarter was a natural corollary of the clause in the Treaty of Turkmanchai which ex cluded the Persian war flag from the waters of the Caspian ; and the good offices of Britain, though invoked by Persia, did not avail to secure its reversal. In 1844 Eussia obtained a modification of the Treaty of Turkmanchai, rendering it incumbent on Persian and Russian subjects to . mil Fovide themselves with passports and the permission of their respective Governments before crossing the common frontier. ^ Relations of France with Persia, 1838-1848, In 1840, or somewhat earlier, the French King Louis Philippe des- Mission of P^clied a diplomatic mission to the Court of Persia; it was headed by g^rcey! 11 ^ ^ 1341970 do the Compte de Sercey; and it was charged with the King's congra tulations to the Shah 5 and with the task of arranging a commercial treaty between France and Persia. Husain Khan, an Ambassador whom the Shah had sent to Europe in 1839 on a political errand to be noticed here after had engaged some French officers for the Persian army to take the place of the British military instructors who had lately been withdrawn and the French Mission was accompanied by M. Flandim ; a painter, and M. Coste, an architect, who in 1840 made a tour for antiquarian research in the districts of Kirmanshah and Burujird. Simultaneously M.Bore ; a layman but a zealous French Catholic, was engaged in trying to propa gate Latin Christianity among the Armenians of Persia; and another Frenchman, M. Nicholas, born in Persia, was actually employed as a Secretary in the Persian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. There was thus, for a time, a great appearance of French activity in Persia; but no commercial treaty was concluded between Persia and France, and the French military officers in Persia found difficulty in obtaining their promised pay and allowances. Before the end of 1840 it was clear that the French Mission failed, and its failure was attributed to British influence,—a circumstance which ^ caused some tension between individual Frenchmen and Englishmen in Persia. At length, in 1845, French trade was accorded the same treatment as that of the most-favoured nation; but, though the Count de Sartiges, who represented France at Tehran in 1847, successfully arranged a commercial treaty, its ratification was in the end withheld by Pe» France had no material interests in Persia; and this fact, while it invested the French Legation for a time with a popularity greater than that of the British or the Eussian, did not conduce to the establishment of permanent political influence. The activities of the Legation were practically limited, throughout, to the protection of Latin Catholics in Persia; and its credit was finally destroyed by the change in the form of Government which occurred in France in 1848.

The chief cause of the Shah's obstinacy was probably a hope that he entertained of favourable results from a mission to Europe which he had confided to one Husain Khan, and of which he was awaiting the outcome. The Persian emissary was instructed to obtain Dr. McNeill's recall, and te was furnished with a written statement of the Shah's grievances against the British Minister and the British Government. Copies of this memorandum were forwarded also to Constantinople^ St. Petersburg, and Paris. The memorandum asserted that the Shah's main object in attacking Herat was to rescue Persian subjects from slavery ; that he was justified, by provocation received, in taking military measures against Kamran; that he had not acted in a spirit of hostility to Britain • and that it had never been his intention to facilitate Russian designs in the direction of Kabul. Dr. McNeill was charged with having incited the people of Herat to persist in their defence of the town and falsely accused of having subsidised the Herat Government to the extent of 8,000 Tumans or £4,000, of having invited various rulers and tribal chiefs to attack the Shah's camp, of having taken measures to produce a scarcity in that camp and of having persuaded caravans on the way to it to turn back to Maghhad. The document concluded with an obscure menace that, if justice were denied to the Shah by the British, he would seek shelter under the shadow of a great mountain.' What this threat m^ant became sufficiently plain afterwards, when the Shah addressed an appeal to Russia for protection or good offices, referring in the same to Herat as refractory province of his own dominions. At Constantinople Husain Khan met only with discouragement; and overtures which were made by Russia on the Shah s behalf weie repelled by the British Government. At last Husain Khan reached London; but the sole result of an interview granted Him by Lord Palmerston, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, was the clear and Ml formulation on the 11th July 1839 of the British demands on Persia, which were these *• (1) A written apology to be offered by the Shah's Government for the outrage on the British Envoy's courier. 134 a Mission of Hussain Khan to Europe and demands of the British on the Persian Government, 1839.1972 (2) A Farman to be published in Persia guaranteeing protection to all persons employed by the British Mission.

(9) The signature of a commercial treaty between Great Britain and Persia to accompany the renewal of diplomatic relations between the two States. With these demands Husain Khan returned to Persia, Russia and France had^ it would seem, declined to support the Persian monarch's protest against the action of Britain. Not long after his return, in consequence of some fraud of which he had been guilty in connection with the engagement of the French military instructors, he was so severely bastinadoed as to be temporarily crippled; but not long aftewards he was found occupying the high post Governor-General of Fars. Compliance The compliance of the Persian Government with the conditions insisted on by the Britain was very gradual, almost every item in the schedule being contested with the utmost pertinacity. Farmans were issued in September 1839 and April 1840, guaranteeing for the fut^ 6 the proper treatment of the servants and dependents of the British Mission in Persia, even should they be Persian subjects, and their i® munity from punishment by the Persian authorities without the knowl^ 6 of the British Minister. The discussions on other points were more p 10 tracted, and it was not until the 31st March 1841, that the settlement was virtually completed by the rendition of Ghorian to the Government of Heiat, the most difficult of all the conditions, in the presence ^ Dr. Riach, the physician to the British Legation at Tehran, of Persia with the British demands, 1839-41.1973 3i r J McNeill then returned to Persia, and the British Legation was established at Tehran, on the 11th October 1841 ; it had a flattering and even cordial reception. A few days later the desired commercial treaty was concluded and signed, and orders were despatched by the British Minister to the Persian Gulf for the evacuation of Kharag, which took place at the beginning of 1842. It is probably fortunate that every thing had been arranged in Persia before the occurrence of the great dis aster at Kabul which will render the months of November and December 1841, for ever memorable in the military annals of British India. It has been shown that Fat-VAli Shah resolutely declined, to the day of bis death, to enter into any commercial treaty that recognised the right of the British Government to appoint Consuls in Persia, alleging as his reason that to do so would be to provoke the anger of .Russia, though the right was one which had already been conceded to Hussia herself in the Treaty of Turkmanchai. On the same subject Muhammad Shah was at first equally obdurate, and, up to the time of the Persian expedition against Herat, the utmost that could be obtained from him was a Farman, issued in 1836, which guaranteed protection and good treatment to British merchants in Persia and declared the duties payable by them to be the same as those to which Russian merchants were liable. It was only as a consequence of the general settlement that followed the Anglo-Persian crisis of 1838-41, that Britain found herself once more, after the lapse of 27 years, in possession of a commercial treaty with Persia of indisputable validity ; this new treaty was concluded by Sir J. McNeill on the 28th October 1841, soon after his return to Tehran, and it was expressly described as an adjunct to the Anglo-Persian Political Treaty of 1814. It provided that the merchants of Britain and Persia should be free to trade in the dominions of Persia and Britain, respectively, subject to payment of customs duty at the rates applied in either country to the trade of the most-favoured European nation; and that the merchants or persons connected with or dependent upon the high contract ing parties should receive the same aid, support and respect as the subjects of the most-favoured nations. Further, the appointment by Britain of a Consul at Tehran and a Consul-General at Tabriz was authorised, Persian recognition being at the same time extended to the existing British Kesi- dency at Bushehr; and Persia received in return the right to locate consular officers in London and Bombay, A Farman, known as that relating to Bankruptcies, was obtained from ^ Shah in 1844, for the better protection of British merchants in Return of the British representa tive to Tehran and evacua tion of Kharag, 1841•42.

Its scope was somewhat wider than its title implied^ for, besides decreeing a suitable procedure in bankruptcy and the punishment of fraudulent bankrupts, it made provision for the registration of deeds of purchase and sale, bonds, and other documents; enjoined that a Malik-ut- Tujjar, or official head of the Persian merchants community, should be appointed at every considerable seat of trade; abolished, with certain exceptions, places of asylum for debtors ; and recognised the right of British official intervention, diplomatic or consular, in cases in which ^ British subjects were concerned. in restraint 12th June 1848, as noted in the Appendix on the Slave Trade, trade 6 a11 autograph note, which was addressed to his Prime Minister, reluctantly forbade the importation of negro slaves into Persia by sea.

McNeill, 1836-42, At the accession of Muhammad Shah, in 1834, the British re r tive at Tehran was Sir John Campbell, an officer under the orders of the Government of India, who had succeeded Sir J. Macdonald Kinneiriu 1830 and had been knighted in 1832. Sir J. Campbell played a considerable part, as has been shown, in securing the throne to Muhammad Shah; but, finding his influence insufficient to carry a treaty of commerce through, he recommended the despatch from England of a special mission from the Crown. One was accordingly sent under * Sir Henry Ellis who had taken part in the negotiation of the Anglo-Persian treaty of 181^ and at an earlier period had belonged to the Hon'ble East India Company's civil establishment and served under Sir J. Malcolm w Persia, to congratulate the new monarch on his accession and conclude a commercial treaty j but in the latter and more important of these two tasks the Special Envoy, who arrived at Tehran in November 1835, was as little successful as his permanent predecessor.

Colonel (afterwards Sir Justin) Sheil succeeded Sir J. McNeill as Colonel British Minister at Tehran in August 184!2, after the settlement of all the questions outstanding between Britain and Persia; but he quitted cases y Persia on leave in October 1847, and at the time of Muhammad Shah's death Colonel F. Farrant held charge of the British Legation, Both of Colonel P. MW these officers had come to Persia originally in the capacity of military nltolis} instructors; and Colonel Farrant, as mentioned elsewhere, had been laves iitol employed as a Special Commissioner, representing the British and Russian Governments at Karbala in 1843. In 1835, when the re-transfer of the Tehran Legation from the Proposed Government of India to His Majesty's Government had been in principle thfAssktant- decided 4 on, the Government of India resolved that the office of Assistant ship to the to the Resident at Bushehr should, after the resignation or departure Bashehr/ of Lieutenant Hennell, the actual incumbent, be abolished; and that the 1835-42. charge of the Residency should thereafter, in any sudden emergency, devolve on the Residency Surgeon. In 1838, the question of Lieutenant Hennell's promotion or resigna tion having arisen, the Government of Bombay strongly opposed the intended reduction on the grounds that correspondence in vernacular with the numerous Arab chiefs having relations with the Residency was an onerous duty with which, single-handed, the Resident could not properly cope, and that the superintendence of the maritime peace frequently necessitated his presence, or that of a properly qualified Assistant, at places far distant from the Bushehr headquarters. They also laid stress on the importance of possessing at Bushehr, especially in critical times, a second officer thoroughly conversant with local politics and with the languages of the country, a qualification that the Residency Surgeon could not be expected to possess, any more than his medical duties permitted of his absence from Bushehr. To these arguments the Government of India yielded a reluctant and temporary assent; and * Lieutenant Edmunds, an officer of the Bombay Army and an excellent Oriental scholar, was appointed Assistant Resident. * Lieutenant Edmunds left Bushehr during the time of the difficulties between f^ain and Persia. In May 1840 he was at Baghdad as a visitor; a little later he ?? P ar t in the British operations against the Egyptians on the Syrian coast; and on i J 11 ? 1 ^9. ^ n dia he was appointed First Assistant to the British Political Agent m Smd; u e died at Poena without having joined that post.1976 tn 1841 Lieutenant (afterwards Sir Arnold) Kemball was selected by the Government of Bombay as Lieutenant Edmunds^; successor. Hereupon the Government of India reverted to their original proposal for a reduction, suggesting that the absence of the Eesident from Bushehr need no longer be more than occasional; that, when special circumstances necessitated it ; the Eesidency Surgeon might hold charge of the current duties ; and that conjimunication with the maritime chief of the Gulf might be maintained through the British Naval Commodore. In reply to these suggestions it was pointed out by Captain Hennell, the Resident at Bushehr, through the Government of Bombay, who supported his views, that the political correspondence of the Kesidency had more than doubled within recent years; that the work of translating and copying secret letters, together with a general superintendence of the Residency accounts, was enough fully to occupy the time of a European officer ; that Residents were sometimes appointed to Bushehr who had no knowledge at all of the languages of the Gulf; that it was important to secure continuity of policy in case of the death or sudden departure, for any reason, of a Resident; that the Residents accustomed tours on the Arabian coast could not be discontinued without untoward political results; and that the Naval Commodore was not a suitable medium of communication with the Arab Shaikhs in cases which involved political interests or required close investigation. These arguments prevailed, though Captain Hennell admitted that he himself could, by great personal exertion, carry on the duties of his post without an Assistant; and the appointment of Lieutenant Kemball was confirmed. Affairs of the Persian Coast and Islands, 1834-1848. Re •appoint ment of Shaikh Nasir III to the Gover norship of Bushehr, November 1837. In September 1837 Shaikh Nasir III of Bushehr, whose flight to Kharag and then to Kuwait in 1832 has been related, proceeded to ShiraZ with the object of obtaining, if possible, a reduction of the tribute which Bushehr was liable to pay to the Government of Fars and a postponement of the recovery of certain arrears which were already due. From this circumstance, and from the fact that Shaikh ''Abdullah, his uncle, was m charge of Bushehr during his absence, it would seem that Shaikh Nasir must, at some time subsequent to the revolution which took pla ce Bushehr in 1833^ have regained possession of his ancestral government.• (UZh 1977 Shaikh Nasir^s journey to Shiraz appeared at first to nave produced unexpected and unfortunate results; for ; on the 1st November 1837, there arrived at Bushehr an individual named Mirza Muhammad Eiza, who 50 intention it clearly was to assume the government of the town. He had been announced as the bearer of a robe of honour for Shaikh ; Abdullah ; the Acting Governor; but on arrival he gave out that he had himself been appointed Governor, with instructions to examine into the affairs of Shaikh Nasir and his treatment of those under his authority, and with authority to requisition the services of the adjoining tribes in case he met with any resistance. Shaikh ''Abdullah and his brother Shaikh Husain at once prepared to encounter the intruder by calling the Bani Hajar and the inhabitants of the Eud-Hilleh district to their assistance ; but, having found that the Dumukh and the people of Tangistan would support the Mirza, they sent their families to Kharag and them selves, on the 1st November, embarked on their vessels —— two Batils, aBaghlah, and a Baqarah, with crews amounting to 50 men only in the Bushehr anchorage. Apparently with the idea of compelling the release of their nephew Shaikh Nasir, whom they supposed to be a prisoner at Shiraz, they pretended for a few days to levy dues on all shipping, even foreign, entering the port; but their action in this respect being unfavourably regarded by the British Resident and the supply of water on board their vessels exhausted, they weighed anchor and betook themselves to Kharag. On the 7th November, however, to the evident surprise of all parties concerned, intelligence was received of the reappointment of Shaikh Nasir to the Government of Bushehr; on the 8th the Dumukh and Tangistani chiefs left Bushehr for their homes; and Shaikh ''Abdullah was invited to return from Kharag. The change in the attitude of the Shiraz Govern ment remained without adequate explanation : it was variously conjectur ed that the Bushehr fleet was needed for an expedition against Bahrain; that it was wanted for the recovery of Muhammareh, which the Turks had taken by surprise; that it was required for the defence of Bushehr itself against an anticipated attack by the sons of the late Governor-General of Pars, who belonged to the Persian royal family but were residing at Baghdad under Turkish protection; or that it was to be utilised as a nucleus for the formation of a Persian navy in the Persian Gulf. Shaikh Nasir did not remain long in possession of Bushehr. On the Flight of ^th May 1838 he again fled to Kharag, as an absconder from the Nasir^II to Persian Government, on which the British Resident at Bushehr noted : Kharag, «Tin i • p May and v *aether any attempt will be made to wrest the possession of the June 1838,1978 and Government o£ Bushehr by Mirza Abbas and Mirza A sad Ullah, 1838-39. Suppressioli df Mirza A sad Ullah by Mirza Muhammad Husain and usurpation of Bushehr by Shaikh Husain, 1839. -Expulsion and intrigues of Shaikh Htisain, 1839-40. island of Karrak from Shaikh Nasir remains to be seen, but I am inclined to think that the present authorities of Ears have neither the means nor the energy required for the success of an effort of this descrip- tion.' The Shaikhs place at Bushehr was taken by Mirza Abbas^ who appears to have been a nominee of the Persian authorities, not a member of the Shaikhs family and Mirza Abbas was very soon relieved by another Persian official, Mirza Asad Ullah, who distinguished himself chiefly by his anti-British tendencies. Shaikh Nasir lived quietly on Kharag until early in 1839, when, as will be seen later, he was expelled by the officer commanding a British garrison that had been established there i in consequence of difficulties with Persia^ only a few days after his own arrival on the island k Mirza A-sad Ullal^ who had in the meantime become involved in serious difficulties with the British, received notice on the 8th June 1839 of his supersession by Mirza Muhammad Husain, a nephew of the Wazir of the Governor-General of Fars. Only three days previously he had been invested with a robe of honour from the Shah^ as had also Baqii' Khan, 'Military Commandant of Bushehr^ and Chief of Tangistan. Mirza Asad Ullah retired to a place in the neighbourhood to await the result of a memorial got up in his favour by the chief Mulla and merchants of Bushehr, while Baqir Khan temporarily carried on the administration of the town, Mirza Muhammad Husain duly arrived and assumed the government] but he was quickly expelled, in August 1839, by Shaikh Husain, the Uncle of Shaikh Nasir, assisted by Baqir Khan. It seemed that Shaikh Husain aimed at possessing Bushehr himself in opposition to Shaikh Nasir, and that the object of his ally, Baqir Khan, was to render affairs at Bushehr so embroiled that the Persian Government would in the end be obliged to confer it on himself as the only local chief possessing sufficient power to maintain order* Shaikh Husain must soon, in his turn, have been ejected from the Government; for towards the end of 1840 he was at Behbehan, enlisting the support of Mirza Koma, the ruler of that place, with a view to an attack on Bushehr. The British authorities on Kharag allowed an agent sent by Mirza Koma to remove from the island some rusty cannon which were shown to be the Shaikh's own property; but the general feeling at Bushehr was unfavourable to Shaikh Husain's restoration. Mi^a Koma then prudently abandoned the enterprise, in which he had only with the idea of obtaining Bushehr for himself.i979 In December 1839 'Agha Jamal/'' evidently that Jamal Khan who prominent part in the Bushehr revolution of 1833 and after- wards retired to Masqat, was murdered at the instigation of Baqir Khan, Tangistani. Jamal Khan^s offence seems to have been that he aspired to the Government of Bushehr and had undertaken a journey to Shiraz in the hope of having it conferred on him under a guarantee offered by the Sultan of ; Oman. His assassination, as we have seen elsewhere, was deeply resented by his ' Omani patron, who eventually obtained a promise from the Shah that the murderer should be punished. Meanwhile the cause of Shaikh Nasir had been espoused by Manuchehr Khan, the Mo ; tamad*ud-Dauleh, who had lately been appointed Governor of Isfahan, Luristan and ■'Arabistan, and to whom the Shaikh had recourse. The Mohamad evidently thought that the Shaikh might be of use in helping him to obtain the Governor-Generalship of Pars, which he coveted^ and it was stated at one time that a Farman had been granted by the Shah at the Mo'tamad-ud-Dauleir's request, appoint ing Nasir to be Governor of Bushehr and Lord High Admiral of the Persian Gulf. It does not appear, however, that Shaikh Nasir was quickly successful in recovering his lost position. The British military occupation of Kiiarag &gt; already mentioned and further on described^ continued from June 1838 to February 1842; and, when it ceased, the island was left in charge of a Persian garrison from Lar commanded by a certain Lutf ''Ali Khan. Forced to withdraw to Bushehr by a mutiny of his own men, Lutf ''Ali Khan was able to attract the sympathy both of the Governor and of the chief Mujtahid of that town. Each of these authorities sent a deputy to Kharag to enquire into the facts and expostulate with the garrison; but the emissaries met with a disagreeable reception, for they were beaten and told to inform their masters that Kharag was under the ruler of Lar and that, if any force were sent from Bushehr against Kharag, it would be fired on. Lutf ^Ali Khan and his champion the Bushehr Mujtahid then wrote to the Chief of Lar, the one complaining of the insubordination of the Lari garrison, the other suggesting that a small expedition should be organised for the purpose of punishing the soldiers and the islanders. Both of these were Sunnis,—a consideration which seems to have weighed with the Shi'ah Mujtahid. Lutf ''Ali Khan did not, apparently, wait for a ny reply, but took with him a body of ' about thirty idle Shfahs whom he had enlisted at Bushire, and arrived at Karrak in warlike guise.*' The Lar garrison soon terrified the invaders, who fled on board the boat that bought them, leaving Lutf Ali Khan, their leader, behind them. Nothing, however. Murder of Jamal Khan December 1839. Movements of Shaikh Nasir III, 1889-40. Occllrretices on Kharag Island, 1842-43.1980 was done to molest him. He demanded that ho should he allowed to occupy his oli quarters in the fort of Karrak and to command his men, but his request being refused, he took up his residence close to the walls. After staying a fortnight there, he one day entered the fort when the gate was open, and having declared that he would cut down anyone who refused to obey his orders, a matchlock presented to his breast induced him to retreat. He then took up his quarters in a bungalow beyond the lines, and having one servant, posted him on a road near to his residence for the purpose of intercepting and bringing to him the unarmed islanders as they went to, and came from, their fields. Some Kharragis were thus taken prisoners, till at length one of them, provided with arms, resisted, a scuffle ensued, and Lutf Ali's man was cut across the head. 1 Meanwhile letters were received from the Chief of Lar disapproving the proceedings of Lutf ''Ali Khan ; expressing indignation at the interfer ence of the Mujtahid of Bushehr^ and informing Mirza ''Abdullah, the de facto commandant of the Kharag garrison^ that the detachment would shortly be relieved^ and that a relation of the Chief would be sent to take charge of the island ' with the most strict injunctions to protect and not to harass the islandersThe inhabitants of Kharag received this last piece of intelligence with rejoicings; but in 1843 the garrison, as they had not yet been relieved and as they were no longer supplied with pro visions from Bushehr, abandoned Kharag and returned to Lar. They left behind them Lutf ''Ali Khan only, who remained in occupation of the fort. Soon after it was reported, to the great alarm of the Kharagis, that the Persian Government had decided to station regular troops on the island; and on the 17th September 1843 a force of 200 Sarbaz was actually landed. The result was that the small population emigrated, en masse, on the following day. With reference to these movements Lieutenant Kemball, the Assistant Resident at Bushehr ; reported as follows: The very constitution of the Persian soldiery causes them as a body to become authorised robbers and plunderers in order to obtain the necessaries of life, and there fore feared and detested by the peaceable inhabitants of every town in which they may be quartered; their total want of discipline makes them, individually, wantonly oppressive. ^ ^ 5Sf Persia is now at peace with all the world. What then can be the object of sending so large a number as 200 Sirbaz to garrison a small island containing a population of 300 men, pilots and fisliermen, with their families? We can only suppose that they have made themselves obnoxious to the Persian Government by the assistance they afforded in importing provisions, in establishing a bazaar, etc., for the use of the British troops ; and their sole crime is baring bettered their condition under a just and moderate rule, and accumulated small sums which it is intended to extort from them.@ 1981 Their emigration under such circumstances cannot fail, I fear, to entail considerable 'Si loss of credit to the British Government in these parts, but not, I hope, any great EOT®- spo® • ' convenience, for as a portion establish themselves on * Phelech, an island not much ut of the track of vessels proceeding to the Euphrates, pilots will be procurable ; and boats for the transport of coals from the shore to the steamers can be towed across from this port and returned in the same manner. In September 1845 Shaikh Nasir, whose movements from 1840 until Re-appoint- that time are obscure, was reinstated in the Government of Bushehr. Shaikh Nasir III to the Government of Bushehr, 1845. British relations with the Persian Coast and Islands, 1834-1848. The establishment under British auspices of a restrictive line, whereby Tavuneh- warfare among the maritime tribes on the Arabian side of the Gulf was case » confined from 1836 onwards^ to their own waters, imposed on the British Resident at Bushehr a certain responsibility for justice and secu rity upon the Persian coast. This was exemplified at the beginning of 1837; when, the inhabitants of Charak on that coast having dispossessed those of Tavuneh of the fort of Nakhl-i-Mir in the Gulshan valley in the interior, Shaikh Sultan-bin-Saqar of Sharjah, who had a hereditary connection with Tavuneh, appealed to the Resident on behalf of the people of that place. The Shaikh's request was that either he himself should be allowed to help the people of Tavuneh against those of Charak, or that the Resident should call upon the Charakis to make restitution. In his reply to a letter written him by the Shaikh, the British Resident pointed out that all outside interference was precluded by the fact that the contending parties were subjects of Persia, besides which the Shaikh of Umm-al-Qaiwain had already been prevented from sending military aid across the Gulf to the people of Charak, and the Nakhl-i-Mir dispute liad in fact been settled by the Chief of Bastak. Shaikh Sultan-bin- Saqar was warned, in conclusion, that he would incur the displeasure of y the British Government by an expedition against Charak; and this threat seems to have sufficed to deter him from action. Towards the end of the same year, when Shaikh ^Abdullah and Shaikh The ' Colonel Husain of Bushehr proposed, by way of reprisals against the Government ofShiraz, to exact irregular dues from vessels entering the port, the Shah ' British Resident was obliged, by a probability of the ' Colonel Newall,^ 1837^ 01 S ' Failakah.1982 l ! I Kangun- 'Asalu case, 1838. The ' Colonel Newall' case, 1838. a vessel under British colours^ being subjected to such treatment, to lodge a protest and to request Commodore Pepper, the senior officer of the Indian Naval Squadron, to keep the Bushehr fleet under observation. Shaikh ^Abdullah thereupon informed the Resident that it had never been intended to interfere with the ' Colonel Newall^ at all and the Shaikhs relinquished their obnoxious scheme. A few days later it was the turn of the Shaikhs to seek the protection of the Resident for the ' Nasrat Shah a ship belonging to Shaikh Nasir, their nephew, which was expected shortly from Bombay with a cargo largely owned by British subjects, and which the Persian authori ties were likely, in view of the differences between them and the Shaikhs' family, to attempt to seize. The Resident answered that it lay with the Shaikhs to take the necessary measures for the vessels defence; but, fortunately, matters had been arranged between the Persian Government and the Shaikhs before the arrival of the (&lt; Nasrat Shah 'at Bushehr. In 1838 Captain Hennell, the Acting Resident at Bushehr, considered it necessary, on his return from a visit to India, to address His Koyal Highness the Governor-General of Fars on the subject of depredations committed by Shaikh Khalfan, the Zabit of 'Asalu, upon boats belonging to Kangun, of which place Shaikh Jabarah was Zabit. This Shaikh Jabarah of Kangun may have been the same who attracted the favourable notice of General Malcolm in 1808. His adversary, Shaikh Khalfan, was in close relations with the Bani Yas tribe of the Arabian Coast who had been responsible for the last exhibition of armed lawlessness on a large scale in the waters of the Persian Gulf. The two hostile chiefs had, it appeared, been called to Shiraz in order that their mutual proceedings might be enquired into, and the Kangun Shaikh had obeyed the summons, but he of ^Asalu had give 11 no signs of compliance. The British Resident at Bushahr accordingly urged the Governor-General of Fars to insist on the latter's appearance and punish him for his misdeeds ; but even this degree of intervention appears to have been resented by the Prince, who replied, civilly ^ not without asperity : ' The oppressor will be subject to punishment without the necessity of foreign assistance/' In 1838 the British barque a Colonel Newall/' already mention^, again became a cause of difficulty at Bushehr. The ostensible owner of the a Colonel Newall' was Haji Mirza Shafi', a Mughal merchant residing at Bombay, and the vessel possessed a British pass and colours j but the commander, Mulla Muhammad, and the crew were all natives of1983 a Ui jftghehr. In the interval between his reappointment to the Governmen j of Bushehr in November 1837 and his flight from that place in May 1888 ; Shaikh Nasir, during a visit of the Colonel Newall^ to his port, had entered into negotiations with the commander for the purchase of one -half of the vessel, and had entrusted him with 15,000 Qrans on that account ; but it was uncertain whether the bargain had been concluded, and whether the owner of the share which Shaikh Nasir desired to | purchase was Haji Mirza Shafi^ or Mulla Muhammad, the commander, kji w ho was said to be himself part proprietor of the vessel. On the Nt return of the 'Colonel Newall' to the Gulf a few months later, leSlif Mirza ; Abbas ^Ali, Governor of Bushehr, under instructions from Shiraz, M claimed from Mulla Muhammad either one-half of the vessel or the sum of 15,000 Qrans paid for it by Shaikh Nasir, on the ground that the Shaikh bad absconded from Bushehr heavily in debt to the Persian Government on account of the revenue of the town and district. The Kesident was doubtful of the extent of the protection to which Mulla Muhammad was entitled, having been guilty—-as it appeared—of an illegal or at least irregular act in receiving a sum of money from a foreigner for the secret purchase of a share in a vessel belonging to a British port and carrying British colours. He referred to India for instructions on the following points : ' firstly, whether Mulla Mahomed was entitled to the same protection as a British subject commanding a British vessel; secondly, whether he was legally liable to be called upon by the local authorities for a sum of money received by him from Sheikh Nasir, while that person was ruler of Bushehr, upon the bare assertion of the Persian Government that he had made away with a portion of its revenues; and thirdly, in the event of its being decided that he was to be protected against this claim, whether the same protection was to be extended to his family and relations, who by the barbarous practice of the country were all liable to be seized, punished, and stripped of every thing in the absence of the offending party' The ' Colonel Newall,' m the meanwhile, had proceeded to Basrah; and Government accord- mgly instructed the Resident that the best course would be to advise the commander of the vessel of the risk he would incur—that of being arrested, in his character of a Persian subject, should he land—by bring- mg his vessel to Bushehr while the claim in question was hanging over him. Whether the Persian authorities maintained the claim, or how the case was finally settled, does not appear. imp le«f :1984 ' fVh ^ a Baghlah named the ' Fat-h-ar-Ealiman/^ flying Arab Eahman,' colours but carrying a Valuable cargo from Bombay, much of which was 1838-41. insured by British subjects, went aground on or ne^r the island of Hanjam about 100 yards from the shore. The native master succeeded in landing all the cargo intact except some sugar, and he lost no time in despatching a messenger to the Sultan of 'Oman's Governor of Bandar Mbas to request help and protection. This messenger, however, fell into the hands of M)dur Eahman, Shaikh of Qishm, who detained him. The Shaikh then proceeded with a body of about 1,000 men to the scene of the wreck, broke up the cases of cargo, mixed their contents together to prevent identification, and finally compelled the master by threats to sign a paper promising him half of the cargo as salvage. A portion of the merchandise thus plundered arrived at Bushehr on the 15th August 1838 in the ' Mombassa, - ' a vessel belonging to the Shaikh of Qishm, with a request that it might be made over to the owners; but Captain Hennell, the British Resident, ascertained that tlie goods so restored did not amount to a sixth part of the original cargo. He consequently recommended that the Sultan of 'Oman should be called upon to compel the Shaikh of Qishm, who was under his authority, to restore the cargo insured by and bond fide the property of British sub jects, or to make good its value ; in the event of the Masqat authorities pleading inability to enforce this demand, direct naval action should, he thought, be taken by the British squadron in the Gulf against the Shaikh of Qishm. The amount of the claim, a doubtful item of shawls beLig deducted, was Rs. 21,500.

As the Sultan of 'Oman was unwilling to put much pressure on the Shaikh of Qishm, it was subsequently decided, in April 1840 ; to lay an embargo on Qishm vessels found in Indian ports. Under this order a Baghlah, the '' Aqub,' was seized at Bombay : and at the end of August 1840 the claim against the Shaikh, reduced by restoration of goods and increased by incidental charges to date, stood at Rs. 14,37/• In May 1841, on being threatened with the seizure of two other Qishm Baghlahs which had left for Bombay with horses, the Shaikh gave a bond for the balance still remaining of Rs. 7,867, and the case ^as apparently closed.135 ('2 ST t l| yiitofc iini, Xh ] scene oft, its to^J 3 y' wivehtll naval dm in tk Gis i, a (kill i Hennlsi ;e filtt ;an of'Oii^ boxes acli pr^- and at I id by i^| tood at ^ of two ^ 1985 After receiving intelligence of the critical state of Anglo-Persian relations in consequence of the Persian expedition against Herat, the Government of India of their own motion issued orders, on the 1st May 1838, for the despatch of a small naval and military force to the Persian Gulf to he employed there, as the British representative at the Court of tte Shah might direct, ' with a view to the maintenance of our ioterests in Persia.' The executive details were left to the Government of Bombay, who decided on the immediate despatch of the new armed steamer *' Semiramis/' the sloop of war ' Coote,' the brig of war 'Tigris' and a transport vessel to Bushehr with 500 rank and file of Native Infantry and two 6-pounders, completely equipped for service; it was resolved ' that the Native Infantry be composed of detachments 'from the 15th, 23rd and 24th Regiments and the Marine Battalion, now 'forming part of the garrison of Bombay, in order to admit of those castes 'being selected which are likely to suffer least from a sea voyage.' The transport vessel needed could not, apparently, be obtained ; for the expeditionary force as first despatched included only 387 sepoys, of whom the ' Semiramis ' was able to carry about 300. The ' Tigris ' preceded the other vessels with despatches for the British Envoy in Persia and the British Resident at Bushehr, and with orders for a con. centration of the British Persian Gulf Squadron at Bushehr or Kharag. The command of the expedition was entrusted to Colonel Sheriff, snhject to the political control of Captain Hennell, the British Resident at Bushehr, who was to exercise his powers as political officer under the instructions of the British Envoy in Persia. Captain Hennell was directed to make the best arrangements in his power for landing the force, and was advised to choose the island of Kkrag for that-purpose; he was to apprise the Persian authorities at Bushehr that the troops had been sent on a special service to the Gulf, ami that the British Government hoped that no objection would be made to their being landed on Kharag ; but it was left to his discretion to land t em on that island even in opposition to the wishes of the Persian uthorities, piovided that he deemed this necessary or expedient, and at it could be done without compromising the safety of the troops. The Semiramis/' commanded by Captain Brucks, left Bombay on ^«h June and arrived on the 19th at Kharag, where the troops were Jgw on the same or the following day.

Captain Hennell, feeling sure that to refer to the Persian authorities at Bushelir would be to court delay^ if not to invite a refusal, carried out the dis- mebarkation without consulting them. Subsequently he gave to Mirza ^Abbas 'Ali, the Persian Governor of Bushehr, the prescribed explana tion in regard to special service ; adding that Kharag had been selected in preference to Basidu and other places on account of the superiority of %ts climate ; and he answered, in similarly conciliatory terms, a Eaqam which presently reached him from the Governor-General of Shim de manding an explanation of the British proceedings at Kharag. No objection was at first made by the local Persian authorities to the despatch of supplies from Bushehr for the British force on Kharag ] and the occupation of the island seemed to be welcomed by Shaikh Nasir, the ex-Governor of Bushehr, who was at the time residing on it as a refugee from the Persian Government. Bungalows were built for the officers of the Kharag garrison, and the native troops there were comfortably hutted. The relations of Persia with Britain were at this time of a decidedly hostile character; and the occupation of Kharag, though it had a sedative effect upon the Shah and the central Government, seems locally to have caused irritation, and even provoked insults. Prominent among the ill-wishers of the British Government at Bushehr was Shaikh Husain, the Qazi of the town, between whom and the Persian Governor, Mirza -Abbas ^Ali, there was a dispute in regard to certain taxes, the Qazi alleging that the inhabitants had paid them to Shaikh Nasir, the quondam Governor, before his flight, while the Mirza declined to accept this excuse. On the 17th November 1838, the bazaars having been closed as a protest against the Governor^ demands, Mirza ^Abbas ^Ali sent Famishes to oblige the shopkeepers to open their shops, whereupon Shaikh Husain incited them to resist and called the town to arms. The Qazi, pretending that one of the Governor 's Farrashes was intoxicated, next ordered a raid to be made upon the premises of the Jews, who were known to deal in liquor; and a rabble, headed by the Qaz^s slaves proceeded, nothing loath, to the Jewish quarter, where they forcibly entered a number of houses. In one of these, which belonged to the Sarraf or money-changer of the British Residency, they destroyed wines and spirits, ready packed for exportation, to the value of 40 or 50 Tumans, and so beat and otherwise ill -treated the owner that he fled to the Eesidency in fear of his life. On the1987 mi „ o' Resident referring the case to the Persian Governor^ the latter made answer that he could do nothing as the Qazi and merchants had risen against him and were endeavouring to expel him from Bnshehr • and he even begged the Resident to inform the Governor-General of Pars of the real state of matters in the town. Captain Hennell was indisposed to take extreme measures at Bushehr at this time, though with a British force on Kharag he was in a position to do so, for he feared to prejudice the efforts which were being made to fettle matters amicably between Britain and Persia. He wrote instead to the Governor-General of Fars, though with little hope of a favourable result, and he suggested to the British Minister at the Persian Court that the deportation of Shaikh Husain and others from Bnshehr, together with the punishment of those who had been most prominent in the outrage on the Sarraf, should be required of Persia. The incident was eventually included in the list of British demands for satisfaction presented to the Persian Government in 1839 and, like the other items in that list, was settled in the course of the two following Persian on Kharag, 1838. Before long obstacles began to be thrown by the Persian authorities ,« in the way of the despatch of supplies from Bushehr to Kharag. First obstruction to Mirza 'Abbas 'Ali prohibited the export of wheat and flour to the island ; ing of the 0n ' fOTin and later Mirza Asad Ullah, his successor, refused to let any Persian letwii subject perform any sort of service for the Kharag garrison and laid i a % an embargo on even the smallest articles required by the 05^0^ mess. The Resident consequently suggested, at the end of 1838, that W ! retaliatory action might be taken by stopping the trade of Bushehr; ^ but Lord Palmerston, then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, W considered the proposed measure inexpedient inasmuch as it would rstof injure the interests of Indian merchants trading with Bushehr as well as of Persian merchants who were well disposed to the British, would furnish the Shah with an excuse for stopping the importation of British goods into Northern Persia, and would probably, in any case, be ineffectual He recommended, instead, that the Persian Government should be warned that, if supplies were not forthcoming, the British Government might be reduced to the necessity of obtaining them by means of its i {|1 0 wn , also that action should be taken in that sense, if the warning were disregarded. Convenient arrangements having been made, however, 01 obtainin g from Basrah the supplies required at Kharag, the matter was allowed to drop. 135 41988 Grave insult Worse was to come. The undefined relations existing between Admiral Sir Britain and Persia, bordering as they did on a state of declared enmity, atMshel^ Were * siic k as a Persian provincial governor could hardly be expected isth March to understand; and the British occupation of Kharag doubtless appeared 1839, j oca | officials in the light of a menace calling for a defiant answer. On the 23rd March 1839, Eear-Admiral Sir Frederick Maitland, tlie I^aval Commander-in-Chief in India, then visiting the Persian Gulf, made an official return call on Mirza Asad Ullah, the Persian Governor of Bushehr. The Admiral was accompanied by Captain Hennell^ tlie Resident, by Commodore Brucks, I.N., and by the commanders of H.M.S. f ^Wellesley and of the Indian Navy vessels 'Clive,' ■ ( Elphinstone, ^ and ' Emily.^ The interview passed off well not withstanding a previous altercation at the Residency, until the Admiral mentioned that the supplies from shore for himself and his ship had been stopped that day, and pointed out that such action, unless it were due to some accidental omission on his own part to comply with a regulation of the port, was contrary to the custom of civilised nations when at peace. The Governor pretended, in reply, that there was a practice of submitting a list of supplies to be sent on board ships^ which had not been followed in the present instance; but this excuse was immediately disposed of by Captain Hennell, who stated absolutely, froni long experience of Bushehr, that no usage of supplying a list of articles to be embarked existed in regard to British ships of war, whether of the Royal or Indian 4 Navy, and that the first attempt to establish one had been made in connection with his own baggage just a fortnight before, but was successfully resisted. The Governor then proceeded to say that it was against local regulations for ships' boats to touch or leave shore anywhere except at the landing stage in Bushehr town, and that direct communication between ships and the British Residency was consequently inadmissible. The Resident, on being appealed to by the Admiral, was * The position of British subjects throughout Persia was at this tkie disagreeable i everywhere they were regarded with distrust and dislike ; see, for example, Layard's JSWty Adventures, Vol. I, page 229. Later the Persian suspicions of Britain were deepened by the occupation of Kabul by troops from India, and a British invasion of Persia by way of Afghanistan came to be feared. (Layard, Early Adven tures, Vol. I, pages 262—263.) The Persians seem also to have dreaded that use might be made of the refugee Persian princes who resided at Baghdad as British and Turkish pensioners. (Mitford, Zand March, Vol. I, pages 344 - 345,)1989 'eisin able to refute this stateni0nt also, which was entirely false; for the immemorial custom at Bushehr was that ships' boats made free use&gt; weather permitting, of the Residency landing-place, and that the baggage of visitors at the Residency was sent on board from there direct, whenever this was the most convenient course. Sir F. Maitland accordingly announced his intention of going on board his ship direct from the Resi dency on the next day but one, and asked the Governor whether he would attempt to prevent his embarkation. To this question, more than once repeated, the Persian official declined to reply; whereupon the Admiral rose to take leave of him, but refused to shake hands. Mirza Asad Ullah then laid hold of Sir F. Maitland and induced him to sit down again; but, on an answer to his question being still obstinately withheld, the Admiral and his party quitted the room. Immediately after their return to the Kesidency a detachment of Persian troops were marched to a sea- tower near it, which they occupied, and a Persian sentry was posted at the Residency landing-place. It was ascertained that these had orders to prevent boats from communicating with the Residency. On the morning of the 25th March the boats of H, M» S. 'Wellesley' and of the Indian Naval Squadron approached the shore to protect Sir F. Maitland^s embarkation. Two gigs came further inshore than the other boats, in neither of which were arms displayed, though they were carried. The Admiral, the Resident, and several officers of the Eoyal and Indian Navies, all unarmed, were standing on a cliff above the landing-place; and a native crowd had collected around. As one of the gigs touched the beach a Persian private soldier cocked his musket and ordered it to push off again. No attention being paid to what he said, he lowered his weapon and would have shot at Captain Maitland of the Wellesley' 'afterwards Admiral Lord Lauderdale) ; but the veteran ^1 Admiral was in time to strike the musket up, and the Resident and other w officers threw themselves upon the man and disarmed him, not without a j The native crowd then attacked the British party with sticks J and stones, and Captain Maitland and several other officers were struck, but not the Admiral. On the gigs^ crews displaying their arms and jumping ashore, the mob dispersed. As the other boats were nearing the shore fire was suddenly opened on them from a breastwork which W been thrown up during the night. The boats replied with two volleys, killing one Persian and wounding two, but immediately ceased fire by order of the Admiral; and a messenger was sent to the Persian Governor to inform him that he would be held responsible for the conse- fences if his people did not stop shooting. A little later the firing from1990 Removal of the British Residency from BQshehr to Kharag, 29th-30th March 1839. the breastwork ceased, and the Admirars embarkation took place without further incident. The attempt of the soldier to fire on Captain Maitland and the erection and manning of a temporary work proved, beyond possibility of doubt, that the outrage was premeditated. Eeparation was ultimately obtained along with the satisfaction of the other British demands of which a schedule was presented to the Persian Government a little after this time. It seemed to Captain Hennell inadvisable, though the Residency building had been placed in a state of defence, to remain at Bushehr after such an occurrence, and he accordingly decided on transferring the Residency to Kharag. On the 27th March the 'Clive' signalled that an artillery detach ment with two guns under Captain Leslie had arrived from Kharag, and that 100 Europeans under Captain Strong had left Kharag for Bushehr on the previous day. As the boats carrying the Europeans had not arrived, and it was thought that they had passed to leeward, Captain Hennell volunteered to go to Halilah, at the southern end of the Bushehr Peninsula, in Her Majesty's brig u Algerine ' and try to pick them up as otherwise, in ignorance of what exactly had occurred, they would probably land and march on the town of Bushehr. These precautions were succes- fully taken, and on the 28th the Algerine' was back at Bushehr. The final embarkation of the Resident and his staff, on the 29tli March, was not unattended by danger. Baqir Khan, the Tangistani chief, had occupied the cliffs at the Residency landing-place with about 400 men, and it was thought that he might attempt to prevent the operation But the sight of ten gunboats from the a Wellesley,' a Cliveand ii Elphinstone ' commanding the shore was sufficient to deter him from interference, though not from insolence. At 2 p.m . the ' Welleslej) ' Algerine ^ and a Elphinstone ^ weighed anchor for Kharag, (i Clive ^ remaining at Bushehr as a guardship to protect British interests and shipping. The Government of India approved generally of the removal of the Residency to Kharag, but they suggested that it might have been avoided by resort to conciliatory explanations in the beginning, and they thought that it might, in any case, have been conducted with somewhat less precipitancy. At the same time they admitted that some prepa rations which the Persians had made for establishing a fortified building between the Residency and the beach had boded ill for the continuance of their representative at Bushire in either honour or safety.(tag) 1991 J situation was such as might conceivably have warranted Captain I Hennell in stronger action than merely withdrawing from Bushehr^ for e i instructions previously received by him from the British Minister of] re garding the employment of the Kharag force were to the effect that djj ^if any hostile demonstration should be made by the Shiraz Govern- irl 'ment, and especially if it were fotind that it was proposed to fortify and || 'strengthen Bushehr or to place a garrison there^, and if the Resident k f, was of opinion that the force under Colonel Sheriff with the naval force a at his disposal was sufficient for the occupation and defence of Bushehrj ' he was to intimate to the Governor of Shiraz that any hostile demon stration he might make would oblige him immediately to occupy Bushehr, ' and defend it if necessary ; but, if no such demonstrations were made, 'the troops should remain on Kharag until the receipt of further 'instructions.^ As matters actually fell oiit, the Persians claimed a victory and pretended to have expelled the British from Bushehr; and the affair^ trivial as it was, had a most unfortunate effect on British prestige throughout the whole Persian Gulf region. No injury was done to the Residency building after the departure of tlie Resident ; the general feeling in the town Was reported to be favourable to the British: and communication between Kharag and Bushehr seems to have remained open. A Persian nobleman, Husain Khan, was shortly sent by the Governor-General of Pars to the British Resident to confer with him on the subject of the withdrawal of the Residency from Bushehr. Captain Hennell discussed the whole question with him in terms that the Government of India afterwards held to Have been judicious. At the same time they remarked that the return of the Residency was a matter for the decision of the British Envoy to Persia, then at Erzeroum, and that the Resident should not entertain, without reference to Government, any further overtures that might bo fliade to him by the Persians. I The transfer of the Residency to Kharag had the unforeseen result of Conflict o ia biinging about a conflict of authority between Captain Hennell, the W Political Resident, and Colonel Sheriff, the Military Commandant. There j-al and mili- wa« f -c 11 t . . . taty authol*- ii s a two-told difference of opinion between them in regard, firstly, to the ities on Expediency of allowing Shaikh Nasir to remain on Kharag and ) consequence secondly, to the necessity of making preparation for offensive action gf^of^sEaikh gainst Persia. Nasir by the From the beginning the presence of Nasir on Kharag had been a source of e m ]3 arrassrnen ^ He was practically in rebellion against the1992 Persian Government, and at first lie was eager to undertake operations against them from Kharag. The Eesident, however, succeeded in inducing him to lay that idea aside by the argument that his conduct would naturally be supposed by the Persian Government to have been instigated by the British authorities, though Britain and Persia were technically at peace. Again, Shaikh Nasir was anxious that the British should hold themselves responsible for the defence of the village of Kharag, as well as of their own camp, against the Persians. This proposal, too, was effectually discountenanced by the Resident. There was also a difficulty about accommodation for the coals and other stores belonging to the British expedition, for which the Resident was anxious to hire the old Dutch fort; but the Shaikh was unwilling to part with the fort, which was the place of residence of his and his relations' wives and families. He offered instead the southern bastion of the village wall, which commanded the best landing-place in the prevailing winds. It was however Colonel Sheriff, the Military Commandant, who in the end decided, in opposition to the views of the Resident, that Shaikh Nasir must leave Kharag. The chief ground on which Colonel Sheriff took action was that, the Shaikh being an avowed enemy of Persia, his presence on the island was likely to be misinterpreted by the Persian Government. The Shaikh''s expulsion seems to have been effected by harsh methods which Captain Hennell did all that he could to mitigate. Shaikh Nasir, it may be noted, claimed the sovereignty of Kharag for himself j but the truth seemed to be that he had held the island as a fief from Persia, in the same manner as Bushehr. In regard to the second point, Colonel Sheriff considered the recent acts of the Persian Governor of Bushehr to be tantamount to a declara tion of war by the Persian Government against Great Britain and wished to take measures accordingly, whereas Captain Hennell was of opinion that Mirza Asad Ullah''s proceedings had been entirely unauthorised by higher authority. The Government of India, when the difference between the two officers was submitted to them, apportioned all the blame to Colonel Sheriff. Not only did they hold that his conduct in encroaching on the Sphere of the political officer in purely political questions had been wrongs but they pronounced his view of the situation to be erroneous and his action in expelling Shaikh Nasir unjustified. Captain HennelFs attitude and opinions were approved; but it was observed that he should have declined to correspond with the military authorities on political subjects and should have held himself responsible to Government alone for the1993 idf # sident | Mki it Was is; toplii t(iOl onectness of his own opinions and measures. It was r^ied that the administration of the island and village should be military, under the officer commanding the forces, the Resident's establishments being excluded frohi his jurisdiction ; these were Captain HennelFs suggestions. It was ordered that some Baluchis left on Kharag by Shaikh Nasir should be taken into the service of the British Government, and that arrangements should be made for the safety and comfort of Shaikh Nasir himself; to whom just compensation for his losses and expenses was to be allowed, at the discretion of the Eesident. In 1841, the British military occupation of Kharag still continuing, it seems to have been proposed by the Resident in the Persian Gulf that the island should be purchased from the Persian Government with a view to the location of the Residency there instead of at Bushehr, and as a permanent settlement and coal depot. The suggestion was referred to England, where it was attentively considered by the India Office and Foreign Office; but in the end it was decided that to acquire Kharag by purchase would be to give Russia an opportunity of obtaining the cession of the whole or a portion of Gilan in the north in return for a remission of the balance of the war indemnity due to her by Persia,—a most undesirable result,-—and that it would be better to do nothing which might so compromise the integrity of Persia. The British Minister at Tehran, however, was instructed to explain to the Persian Government, when the time for the evacuation of Kharag arrived in consequence of the fulfilment of the British demands, that a British Resident would remain on the island for the protection of British commercial interests, and that a coal depot would be required there for the use of the British steam vessels navigating the Tigris and the Euphrates ; and he was directed to ask the Persian Government to order the local authorities to afford the necessary facilities. Kharag had proved, apparently, a not unpopular station. By the end of 1840 a well-furnished bazaar existed on the island, and ready money payments had made abundant supplies procurable; but fever and other diseases continued to be prevalent, in summer, among the troops of the garrsion. It having been arranged that on the conclusion of an Anglo-Persian Commercial Treaty the British occupation of Kharag should cease, Sir J. McNeill wrote on the 28th October 1841 to the military officer commanding on Kharag, desiring him to arrange, in concei't with the 3nt, for an immediate evacuation of the island ; to deliver it up to Proposed purchase of Kharag by Britain from Persia, 1841.

Some delay occurred, due probably to the necessity of obtain ing tonnage for the troops ; but in the course of January and February 1842 the force was withdrawn. Naval stores which remained behind were removed in October or November. In May 1842, the Acting Resident, Colonel H. D. Robertson, strnck his flag at Kharag and removed the Residency to Bushehr; but he presently returned himself to Kharag, where he resided during the whole summer. It seems that the Bushehr Residency building had become uninhabitable, and that the Acting Resident had proposed that it should not be repaired, but that a new Residency should be built in the country some miles from the town, in regard to both of which points he was awaiting orders. From the fact that the Persian Government complained to the British Minister at Tehran of the Resident's continuance at Kharag it would seem that the earlier scheme of retaining the Eesidency there had not been communicated to them or had been withdrawn in deference to their objections. To their complaint they added an un founded charge that the Resident had appointed a headman over the islanders. The temporary return of the Resident to Kharag was, in fact) unofficial. He did not hoist his flag; he was accompanied by only half his guard of 36 men; the whole office establishment with him consisted of one clerk and one Mirza; he had allowed the Assistant Resident and Residency Surgeon to select their own summer quarters, but both had chosen Kharag; and he himself and the Assistant Resident visited Bushehr as often as necessary, remaining there from a week to three weeks at a time. In 1842, the British Legation at Tehran seem to have intervened in a question between Shaikh Nasir and the Persian Government, the former having apparently been deprived by the latter of the island of Kharag. Whether the question had any connection with the recent British military occupation is not clear. In connection with the case the British Minister called upon the Resident in the Persian Gulf to report on the nature of Shaikh Nasir's former tenure of the island, viz., whether it was his hereditary property or whether he held the revenue of it as a fief, also what amount of income the Shaikh had been accustomed to derive from.1995 island or its inhabitants^ and whether he had received any compen^ sation for being deprived 'of it. Colonel Robertson in reply practically confessed his inability to cast any light on the nature of Shaikh Nasir's title to Kharag, no reliable materials being available on which to!found an r } r and: : .opinion l \\\ dins ^ in tte J iiclipoiiiisl; 3eii mm ej «ili ■ag was, i tied bj 4 ^itlitimcft ant Eesi &gt;rs, y t)«l. ; Eedte- i a weett« : .ment, fe' ,: The re -appointment of Shaikh Nasir once more^ in 1845^ to the Governorship of Bushehr seems to have been regarded with satisfaction by Colonel Hennell^ the Resident.

NASIR-UD-DIN SHAH, 1848—1896.^ Before the death of Muhammad Shah his eldest son, Nasir-ud-Din Mirza, had been recognised by the British and Russian Governments separately and conjointly, as heir to the throne ofiPersia; consequently, when the Shah expired, Colonel Farrant, the British Charg6 d'Affaires, and Prince Dolgoruki, the Russian Minister at Tehran, worked together to ensure the peaceful succession of that youthful Prince. Information of his fathers approaching end was even despatched to him post haste at Tabriz, where as Governor-General of Azarbaijan he had his residence as soon as it was certain that the Shah had not many hours to live.

Relations of Shaikh Nasir with the British Residency, 1845.1996 was inevitable notwithstanding every precaution, that some amount of disquiet should attend the change of sovereign; and the considerable interval that occurred between the death of Muhammad Shah and tlie arrival of Nasir-ud-Din Mirza at the capital was full of anxiety. A pro visional government was formed at Tehran, over which the Mahd Auliyah or Queen-Mother presided; but the members, who belonged to different political factions, and whose individual interests also were at variance, were united in nothing except in demanding the retirement from public life of the lately omnipotent Prime Minister, Haji Mirza Aghasi. That peculiar but astute individual, who had enriched himself enormously by the exercise of the supreme power and who had become greatly attached thereto, seemed at a loss how to act; at one moment he promised the British and Russian representatives to abstain from political activity during the crisis ; at another he shut himself up in the citadel of Tehran with 1,200 followers, as if preparing to assert himself by force ; and finally he took sanctuary at the shrine of Shah 'Abdul ^Azim near the capital.

The young Shah had already made choice ol his principal adviser ; this was Mirza Taqi Khan, of whom we shall bave more to say hereafter, and who chose the military title of Amir Nizam in preference to that of Sadr A^zam or Prime Minister, the latter having been rendered inauspicious in his opinion by certain evil precedents. O 116 consequence of the selection of Mirza Taqi Khan was the banishment or flight of Haji Mirza Aghasi to Karbala, where he shortly died.J At first matters seemed to go from bad to worse, and the fall of the Qaj'ar dynasty and a breaking up of Persia were commonly predicted. The Treasury was empty ; risings or riots took place at Yazd, Isfahan, Shiraz and Kirman ; and the highroads became so unsafe as to cause despair among merchants, no less than 1,500 animals with their loads being carried oif or detained in the neighbourhood of Yazd alone w ^ So Watson { history of Persia, page 364), but Rawlinson makes the date the 21st {England and Russia in the East, page 74). There is the same discrepancy ofo ne day between the dates assigned by these writers to the death of Muhammad Shah. fLord Curzon states definitely that Nassir-ud-Din Shah was born on the 17th J* 1 ? 1831 [Persia, vol. I, page 393), and the statement doubtless rests on conclu 8 ^ 6 evidence. According to Watson [History of Persia, page 364) the Shah was 16 at^ time of his accession ; while Lady Sheil, on the other hand, calls him 21 in Novembei 1851, and Binning makes him complete his 21st lunar year on the Hth De^ 6 ' 1850 {Journal of Two Years* Travel). % Loftus {Travels and Researches, 56) mentions his tomb as existing ^ Karbala in 1849 and relates ^ characteristic anecdote of the Haji in connection With lS decease.1997 ^ about two months. By degrees, however, these troubles subsided or e H were quelled. Tehran itself was at one time threatened by Saif-ul- ] Mulk Mirza, a son of that Zill-us-Sultan who had disputed the throne ! witfi Nasir -ud-Din Shah's father; but the force which this pretender ' 1 managed to collect was quickly scattered and he himself brought a prisoner to Tehran. The greatest and most prolonged danger to the new government Rebellion of arose from the state of affairs in Khurasan, where the Salar, whose father jJashhad,^ the Asaf -ud-Dauleh was still in exile, had re-appeared upon the scene. 1848—1850, Before long the Salar, who enjoyed the support of most of the chiefs of ^ Khurasan and was a favourite—almost an idol—of the people, had obliged Hamzah iMirza, the Shah^s uncle and representative at Mash had, though aided bv Yar Muhammad Khan of Herat, to evacuate the town and retire towards the Afghan border. Proposals for British and Russian mediation were rejected by the Amir Nizam, who was firmly opposed on principle to all foreign interference in Persian internal affairs. In stead reinforcements were sent under Sultan Murad Mirza, another uncle of the Shah, to the Persian army investing Mashhad. Meanwhile Turko man robbers from beyond the border were overrunning Khurasan in all directions; and Yar Muhammad Khan, while pretending to assist the Shah ; s troops, was merely awaiting the issue of the struggle, by which he hoped to profit. Towards the end of 1849 another force was des patched from Tehran to Mashhad, but it sustained a serious reverse on its first arrival. At length, after a siege lasting^ year and a half, the towns people, seeing that some important redoubt^ had fallen and that a general assault was imminent, threw the gates of Mashhad open to the royal forces under Sultan Murad Mirza. The Salar was dragged from the shrine of Imam Eiza, where he bad taken sanctuary, and underwent execution by the bowstring. His death, though regretted by many on account of his enterprising and chivalrous character, tended greatly to the consolidation of the new regime, especially as the ordinary inhabitants of Mashhad were treated with leniency, a fine only being exacted from them as punishment for having participated in the rebellion. It does not appear that the Salar himself aspired to the throne of ersia, but he probably aimed at restoring his family to their former position as semi-independent Governors-General of Khurasan. Mirza Taqi Khan, the Amir Nizam, under whom order and confi- Mirza Taqi ence were gradually restored, is perhaps the strongest and most remark ? e character in the modern history of Persia.- In person he was ' l ^ r ge, portly, good-looking man, with an open intelligent countenance.'^ 1852* was 0 ^ SUCcess en ^ re lj i' 8 own personal qualities. He 8 0 plebeian origin; and when he accompanied the mission of usiau Mirza to St. Petersburg about 1830, it was in the humble Khan ; his administra tion, fall, and1998 capacity of a servant. Through clerkships and secretaryships he rose to the post of Persian representative on the Perso-Turkish Frontier Commission at Erzeroum (1843—1847), which was offered him under English advice. He proved -to be * ' beyond all comparison the most interesting ^ of the personalities which the Commission brought together; he maintained the Persian case with great steadiness and ability; and he was disliked by the Turks, t ' with more than uncommon aversion, from his dignified bearing and stately manners ^ Mirza Taqi Khan was afterwards placed on the staff of Nasir-ud- Din Mirza^ when that Prince was appointed by his father to the Governor-Generalship of Azarbaijan ; and it was not unnatural that iij r Nasir-ud-Dm should have wished, on promotion to the throne, to retain the services of his tried confidential adviser. But the Shah acted un wisely in bestowing on him the hand of his own full sister in marriage, -—a proceeding disapproved by many of the royal family; and his favourite found a determined enemy in the Queen-Mother. The problem which confronted Mirza Taqi Khan on assuming the direction of affairs was in the first place financial, in the second mili' tary. During the first few months of the new reign no revenue reached the public Treasury, while the Government as yet possessed no financial credit ; and in Khurasan the situation was critical and called for military effort. With a fearlessness worthy of the highest praise the minister at once addressed himself to the double task of reforming the finances and creating an efficient army. His economies consisted largely in the aboli tion or reduction of undeserved pensions which his predecessor had granted liberally to princes and priests, — a measure which made him intensely unpopular with a large and influential class; and his own incorruptible integrity enabled him to go even further and suppress in a great degree the peculation which flouiished on all sides, especially in the military departments. The first serious sign of opposition to the Amir Nizanis praiseworthy but dangerous reforms was a mutiny of the military ga rr i° son of Tehran in March 1849, instigated by his enemies and directed against him personally. He met the emergency by retiring quietly fro® office until the incident had been arranged, after which he resumed his post and the introduction of reforms. A leading principle of his policy was the repression of all influences which encroached upon the preroga tives of the civil government, and of such there was no lack in Persia m his day, In the realisation of this principle he caused the Shaikh -ul -l 8 ^® at Tabriz to be arrested, deprived the Imam Jumah at Tehran of ^ prescriptive right of affording sanctuary, and even sought toj?rohib|^ * The words are those of one of his English colleagues ; see the Hon'hie B. Cai^ 8 Armenia, page 55. f The same, page 56.1999 through the ecclesiastical authorities, those exhibitions of Shi'ah fanati cism which in Iran are associated with the month of Muharram. In the matter of foreign relations he was equally * uncompromising, it being • jjjg ambition to reclaim Persia from her attitude of humiliating depen dence on the good pleasure of Russia, Britain, and Turkey. He refused, , a g we have already seen, proffers of foreign intervention between the Shah and the Mashad rebels; and he turned an equally deaf ear to British suggestions that the Asaf-ud-Dauleh's family should be restored fco power in Khurasan and to Russian demands that Bahman Mirza, an ancle of the Shah who had fled from his post and taken refuge in Russian territory, should be replaced in the Governor-Generalship of Azarbaijan, His strict observance of his engagements was as remarkable as his un willingness to enter into any ; and his simplicity and inaccessibility to flattery were no less striking. By honesty, industry, energy, and courage, the Amir Nizam succeeded in imparting relative prosperity to the fiscal resources of the State and to private trade, as well as a certain degree of efficiency to the army ; but hardly had affairs begun to mend when he suddenly incurred the distrust of the Shah. The Amir Nizam had the defects of his qualities; he bore himself with a hauteur and self-sufficiency that cannot but have been disagreeable to his royal master; and it was even whispered that he had spoken slightingly of the Shah as ' that young fellow/' It may have been falsely represented to Nasir-ud-Din Shah that the Minister cherished designs upon the throne itself; and, if so, the devotion with which the army now regarded him may have seemed to lend probability to the charge. On the night of the 13th November 1851, the Shah, after taking extraordinary precautions for his own safety, sent to inform the Amir Nizam that he was relieved of all but his military functions,—an order to which the Minister respectfully bowed. Ite: were ma(ie 011 Mirza Taqi Khan's behalf by the British audi a nd resulted in his being offered the Government of Kashan; diil ^ ^ es itated to accept any provincial government, believing that his Me would be in danger immediately that he was cut off from direct com. munication with the Shah. The Russian Minister then interposed on his Ift: behalf, but so tactlessly as to become in the end the cause of his destruc tion. An attempt by Prince Dolgoruki to place him openly under Russian protection at Tehran having provoked alarm and indignation on the part ^J^h ah and his new advise rs, the Amir Nizam was sent as a political Amh-, t0 journal of Two Years' Travels, vol.

On the 9th January 1852 Mirza Taqi Khan was seized and cruelly bled to death at the palace of Fin, near Kashan, by emissaries from Tehran. Circumstances of unusual ingratitude and heartless deception intensified the tragic character of the event, the only bright feature in which was the devotion displayed by the victim's girl wife. It was not long until the Shah perceived that the crime into whichlie had been betrayed by calumny and misrepresentation was a political blunder of the first magnitude ; and he gave signs of sincere, if transient, remorse. The murder of the Amir Nizam excited horror even in distant Europe] and in Persia the brief period of his administration was rememberedj for some years at least, as a sort of golden age. At frequent intervals during his long reign Nasir-ud-Din Shah gave proofs of personal energy and of a desire to make himself personally acquainted with affaris by undertaking journeys to different parts of Persia, and even to foreign countries. His first important tour in his own kingdom was undertaken in 1851j while the Amir Nizam was still in power, and its objective was Isfahan. The Shah was accompanied on his progress by a large number of Ins cour tiers and part of his army ; and the Foreign Missions at Tehran, led by the Eussian, decided on taking part in the journey as a mark of atten tion. The Shah left his capital about the end of April and, travelling by a circuitous route, arrived on the 15th July at Isfahan, where Colonel Sheil, the British Minister, as also the representatives of Russia and Turkey had preceded him. He remained at Isfahan, the presence of the disorderly crowd that he brought with him greatly deranging the life of the place, until the 28th August, when he left again for Tehran. The Babi heresy or new religion which originated—^as has been described—in the preceding reign, was a cause of serious political trouble during the earlier years of Nasir-ud-Din Shah. Persecution seemed only to give greater vitality to the Babi movement. The Bab himself had been arrested at Shiraz in 1845, and thereafter he spent the greater part of his life in prison until his execution at Tabriz in July 1850. At Yazd a Babi rising occurred, but was suppressed with the aid of the populace. At Tehran a Babi plot against the life of the Amir Nizam ^ discovered and seven Babis were publicly executed,—the first instance ^ departure from the established practice of Persia under which condemne it ^ the as nr Uui s , ' Wesi v, %2001 tedfi He ^oiy Circnii fetrao )cti?e was li number of til at Tel®,! as amartrfl alian, wkcl itivesofEii u, tk pMI Uas k lUS ^ 'ersecuti® &amp; The i spent f s in WIT'' wlfi fhict criminals were privately strangled in the presence of the Shah. In May 1850, almost simultaneously with the rising at Yazd, a more serious Babi revolt broke out at Zinjan, where a handful of 300 Babx rebels continued, notwithstanding the execution of the Bab himself, to main* tain themselves until the end of the year against the forces of the Crown. Their defence was desperate ; their methods were ferocious ; and thier punishment was extermination. The efforts of the Babis culminated, after a period of quiescence following on the reduction of Zinjan^ in an attempt upon the life of the Shah ; made on the 15th August 1852, from which it was clear that the prin ciples of some of the sect had now become actively anarchical. The Shah escaped with a slight wound from a pistol bullet in the thigh, and of his four Babi assailants one was killed on the spot and two were cap tured. About 30 persons held to have been involved were put to death some of them after horrid tortures ; and a certain amount of sympathy with the sectaries was awakned by the haste and severity of the Govern ment measures. A number of the highest officials of the Persian Government were compelled to take a personal share in the execution of the condemned Babis, the idea being to distribute responsibility for the act and the anticipated revenge of the Babi brotherhood over as large a body as possible of distinguished persons. The Amir Nizam was followed in the highest office of state by the Itimad-ud-Dauleh, better known as Mirza Agha Khan, a man of a differ ent stamp, who did not hesitate to accept the title of Sadr A^zam or Prime Minister. His policy, in the beginning, was prudent and reserved ; but his tortuous dealings and anti-foreign sentiments gradu ally involved Persia in complications of which the final issue was, as will be explained in another place, the Anglo-Persian War of 1856-57. In 1858 the Shah dismissed Mirza Agha Khan and took upon him self the general direction of affairs, a charge which he never again, though he afterwards appointed more than one Sadr A^zam, entirely resigned into other hands. More than a decade of Nasir-ud-Din Shah's reign was characterised % bad harvests and consequent distress in various parts of the country, f^ich better means of communication would have sufficed, in some instances, to avert. On the 28th February and 1st March 1861 there Were ser i 0 us bread riots at Tehran, in the course of which the mayor of tii 0 city was put to death. In the summer of 1865 there was an emeute, ^ to scarcity, at Shiraz, in which some lives were lost ; and in the P riI ig of the following year, during a tour of the Sha to the Caspian 136 Prime Minis, tership of Mirza Agba Khan, 1851 -1858.

Prime Ministership of Mirza Husain Khan, 1871 —1873. littoral, tumults of a like nature broke out at the capital, which necessi tated His Majesty's instant return and the opening of the royal granaries to the public. A serious famine which occurred in the South in 1870-72 is noticed further on in the history of the Persian Coast and Islands. In 1867 the Shah visited Mashhad, where lie arrived on the 17tli of June, partly as a religious duty and partly for reasons of States he was accompanied by the Queen-Mother and all his ladies, and he did not return to Tehran until the 23rd of September. During his halt at the provincial capital of Khurasan he received a visit from Muhammad Ya^qub Khan, son of the Amir of Afghanistan and Governor, in bis father Sher ^Ali Khan^s name of Herat. A journey which Nasir-'ud-Din Shah made in the winter of 1870-71 to Turkish f Iraq/ as a pilgrim to the Shi f ah Shrines there, and also perhaps as an observer of the condition of his subjects in the Ottonian Empire, is described, as regards its stages lying beyond the Persian frontier, in the chapter on the history of that province. The Shah left Tehran on the 25th September 1870 with the Queen-Mother and other ladies of the royal establishment. He arrived at Kirmanshah on the 27th of October, the journey thither from the capital having heen ff attended throughout with discomfort and privation of no ordinary character to the whole camp, aggravated by the presence of the cholera.■ , '' As he approached Kirmanshah from Hamadan he was dis turbed by noisy complaints of misgovernment against the Prince -Govei'' nor of the province, into which, on his arrival, he promised to enquire; personally ; and he remained at Kirmanshah till the 5th of November. The Shah re-entered Persian territory from Khaaaqin on the 9th January 1871 and regained Kirmanshah on the 24th of the same month. In 1871 the Shah, feeling the need of some one to share with him the burdens of government, revived the office of Sadr A ; zam or P^me Minister and appointed to it Mirza Husain Khan, an enlightened an experienced official, who had represented Persia at Tiflis and at Bombay and who had subsequently held for 12 years the high post of Persian Ambassador at Constantinople. The new Prime Minister was the autho of the Renter Concession, which will be noticed hereafter in its p r0 P e place, and he encouraged the Shah in a design that he had long tained of visiting the principal capitals of Europe,—two measures w ^ by their unpopularity eventually brought about the Prime Mi^ 61 own downfall.V 2003 136 a On his first journey to Europe the Shah took with him several The Shah's princes of the blood whom it was judged inexpedient to leave behind in pean ^1°' Persia; but, even so, the fact of his being able to leave Persia at all bore 1873 » witness to his consciousness of being firmly established on the throne, Constantinople, Vienna, St. Petersburg, Berlin, Paris, Brussels, and London were among the capitals which he visited ; and at Constanti nople a unique personal meeting took place between him and the Sultan of Turkey, the two Principal Muhammadan monarchs of the world. Some of the political results of the Shah^s journey are noted else where ; here it is only relevent to mention the circumstances attending its conclusion. Rumours of disaffection at home abridged the Shah's tour in its last stages; and when he returned to Persia it was to find that the Renter Concession had caused a dangerous ferment in the country, and that the removal of the Prime Minister was demanded by a large body of malcontents, some of whom were actuated by public, but a larger number by private considerations. For a time it was feared that the Shah might consider himself obliged to sacrifice Mirza Husain Khan, as he had sacrificed Mirza Taqi K1 an in 1852 to appease the general resentment; but, while he dismissed him from Prime Minister ship, he protected him from harm and even maintained him in power, for a time ; as Sipah Salar or Commander-in-Chief; and in the end suitable punishments were meted out to all the more prominent personages who had shown symptoms of disloyalty. Emboldened by the success of his first journey to Europe the Shah The Shah's in 1878 undertook a second. On this occasion he visited Russia, peaTtour) 10 Germany, France and Austria, but not England ; and the chief visible 1878, consequence of his excursion was the importation of Austrian instructors for the Persian army on a considerable scale. Since the disappearance, about 1850, of most of the French officers employed by Muhammad Shah, the Persian army had passed through the hands, successively, of Austrian, Italian, and other French experts none of whom remained very long in the country. There was some murmuring in Persia regarding the extravagance of the Shah^s * expenditure on his second European tour. In 1889 the Shah travelled in Europe for the third time, once more Th e Shah 's Siting England. ptantou^ 1 e Grovernment of Nasir-ud-Din Shah was probably never seen . , to DToof™ i * Nasir-ud- ^^^^advantage than about the year 1889, by which time its Din Shah's % ———— Governmerr u , government of the Shah as it existed in 1889 is fully described and analysed 1889. ofth^f f U, .

The principal Minister of State at this time, though not honoured with the title of Sadr ^zam, was Mirza Mi jiskar Khan, known as the Armn-ud- Dauleh; he was of Armenian extraction and young, but natural ability and force of character. To British visitors he liberal and Anglophil sentiments, and he was the chief member of the Shah^s suite on His Majesty's third journey to Europe; but, as will appear from his measures in the Persian Gulf, to be described hereafter, his policy presented some marks of chauvinism. Ordinary business was disposed of to some extent by a Council of State formed after the Shah^s first journey to Europe, which consisted in 1889 of about 30 members including the heads of departments ; but there was also an inner Council of Five, constituted by the Shah in 1888 to advise him on important matters. Nasir-ud-Din Shah^s reign, perhaps the most meritorious in Persia since that of Karim Khan, Zand, was terminated by his assassination on the 1st May 1896, when preparations were already on foot for celebra ting the completion of the fiftieth unar year of his rule. The scene of the occurrence was the shrine of Shah Abdul Azim near Tehran, to which he had gone to pay his devotions. His Majesty refused to let the mosque be cleared of the public for his convenience, and, as he was passing through the crowd, a man raised a pistol and shot him through the heart. The assassin was Mirza Riza, a small tradesman of Tehran, who was hanged on the 12th of August following. He was not a Babi but a disciple of Kamal-ud-Dm, Afghan, a born subject of the Shah but settled at Constantinople, from whom Mirza Kiza had imbibed revolutionary and anarchical ideas. The Persian Government demanded the extradition of Kamal-ud-Din, whom the murderer expressly inculpated in a confession ; but, while the negotiations were still pe^ 1 ing, Kamal-ud-Din died. Judged by his actions Nasir-ud-Din Shah, though he did shrink from the exercise of great severity when he considered to be required was a humane and progressive ruler. In his late* vears official punishments throughout Persia became less fi^q 1101 ^ and less cruel; he was imperious, but ' diligent and fairly j u ^ and he had come to be unanimously regarded as ' the most com2005 ta'J 0 petent man in the country^ and the best ruler that it can produce' Brigandage and disorder were held in check in his days with a success which cannot but excite envy and admiration at the present time. He was partially successful in the'policy, initiated by the Amir Nizam, of curtail ing ecclesiastical influence and the abuses connected therewith, such as that of Bast or sanctuary; and he was even able to introduce some degree of civil control into the management of religious properties and endowments. The establishment of telegraphic communication in Persia and between Persia and the outer world, though the agency of this epoch- making change was mainly British, and the creation of a Persian Post Office, also through foreigners, were great*' advances in civilisation redounding to his personal credit. Numerous internal reforms were essayed by Nasir-ud-Din Shah and varied considerably as regards both their importance and their success. Efforts made by him to establish Courts of Justice remained without result; an attempt to draw up a code of secular law was equally infruc- tuous; and a system of Local Administrative Councils, of which in 1875 he decreed the establishment as a check upon provincial governors and clerical influence, never really entered on the stage of material existence. The depreciation of the currency, which had become extreme, engaged the attention of the Shah so early as 1865 ; and in 1877 a mint was established at Tehran for the coining of money on European principles. On the 26th May 1888 a Royal Proclamation was issued, and ordered to be published, which was in effect a charter of the liberties and rights of Persian subjects and contained the following sentences— Therefore, for the information and re-assurance of all the subjects and people of this kingdom generally. We do proclaim that all Our subjects are free and independent as regards their persons and property, it is Our will and pleasure that they should without fear or doubt, employ their capital in whatever manner they please, and engage ln an y enterprises, such as combination of funds, formation of companies for the construction of factories and roads, or in any measures for the promotion of civilisation and security. The caie of fchat is taken on Ourselves; and no one has the right or power to interfere with, or lay hands on, the property of Persian subjects, nor to molest their persons or property, nor to punish Persian subjects except in giving effect to decrees of the civil or religious law. This Proclamation had little effect in the provinces; but it was Honourably observed by the Shah himself, and, being officially commu- ^Sonae account of these Will be found in the Appendices on Telegraphs and Post Offices.2006 nicated to the Foreign Missions at Tehran, provided the latter with a foundation on which to base protests in case of flagrant acts of oppres sion coming to their notice. A measure of general utility, explained I i elsewhere in its proper place, was the opening of the Karun Eiver below Ahwaz to international navigation; this was effected by a royal edict, dated 30th October 1888. Relations of Persia with Afghanistan and Turkistan, 1848—1896. Events lead ing to tne Anglo- Persian agreement concerning Herat, 1851—1853. During the first part of Nasir-ud-Din Shah^s reign the external relations of Persia were governed by the question of Herat, which had given much trouble in his fathers time and was now to become the chief cause of a rupture between Britain and Persia. Herat continued to be regarded by British statesman as a corner-stone of the defence of India, and ^ resistance to its incorporation in Persia was still a leading article of British policy. Kamran^ the Sadozai prince who ruled Herat at the time of the Persian expedition against it in 1837-38, had been removed in 1842 by his able but unscrupulous Wazir, Yar Muhammad Khan, who governed it in his stead until his own death in 1851. The successor of Yar Muhammad Khan was his son Sa^id Muhammad Khan, a dissolute and drunken imbecile^ who^ distrusting his own subjects and fearing to be attacked by the Barakzai Sardar of Qandahar, threw himself upon the protection of Persia. From the middle of 1851 onwards there were frequent rumours of the imminent despatch of a Persian force to Herat and negotiations between Sa'id Muhammad Khan and the Persian Government undoubtedly took place; but the queries of Colonel Sheil, the British Minister at Tehran, were either parried or met by assurances that Persia would take no action, unless in an emergency and to save Herat from falling under the domination of Qandahar or Kabul. Early in 1852, however, some movement on the part of the Qandahar Sardar having been observed, a Persian force actually advanced to Herat and occupied the town, while various Afghan chiefs in the district were arrested and sent to Persia. At this stage of the case the diplomacy of the Persian Government, no longer directed by the Amir Nizaifl; became false and self-contradictory; and in the end it was intimated to * Wrongly, according to Sir H. Rawlinson j see his England and Bussia JEast, pages 85-86* in thv2007 111 the Persian representative in London that he could no longer be employed as a medium of communication between the two Governments. Mean while in October 185^ a Farman was issued by the Shah annexing Herat to Persia and appointing Sa^id Muhammad Khan to be Governor. The situation became so strained, in consequence, that at the beginning of 1853 Colonel Sheil suggested the withdrawal of the British Mission from Tehran or the reoccupation of the Island of Kharag in the Persian Gulf; but almost at the same moment the Persian Government yielded and entered into satisfactory arrangements with Britian regarding Herat. These were embodied in an Agreement signed by the Sadr A-'zam on Anglo-Pei 4 - the 25th January 1853; of which the chief provisions were these : the Persian Government should not in future send troops into Herat ing Herat, territory unless to repel a foreign attack, and even in such case the ^ ar:5r Persian forces were not to enter Herat town and were to return to Persia as soon as the danger had ceased ; the relations of Persia with Herat should be replaced on the footing on which they bad existed in the time of Yar Muhammad Khan,—in other words the Persian Government must not attempt to set up their own direct rale at Herat or to interfere in the internal affairs of the principality; no mark of dependence on Persia, such as the* coining of money or the recitation of the Khutbah in the name of the Shah should be required of the ruler of Herat^ there should not be any permanent Persian representative at Herat nor any permanent Herati representative at Tehran, a Persian agent named A'bbas Quli Khan, who had already gone to Herat, being recalled on his completing a four months sojourn there j occasional voluntary assistance might be rendered by the ruler of Herat to the Shah of Persia for the purpose of chastising the Turkomans or of suppressing disturbances or revolts in Persia itself; and, finally, Herati chiefs should not be detained in Persia against their will as political prisoners or suspects, though they might be afforded asylum in that country. The Agreement itself tepresented the above stipulations in the light of concessions made by Persia, notwithstanding the existence of Persian rights over Herat, out of amity towards Britian, and it was added that, if Britain should interfere in the internal affairs of Herat, the whole Agreement should be null and void* The British Government on their part were expected, in the event of the independence of Herat being threatened by an Afghan or ^his colidition was not to prevent the acceptance by the Shah of offeringg of money voluntarily struck in his name, as a complement, by the ruler of Herat,2008 Other foreign power and of the Persian Government requesting assistance, to use their influence to discourage or restrain the aggressor from the prosecution of his designs. As the Agreement contained no article with reference to Persian troops actually at Herat, it may perhaps be inferred that the Persian garrison installed in 1852 had already been withdrawn. The Agreement was communicated to Sa'id Muhammad Khan of Herat by Colonel Sheil along with a Farman of the Shah and a letter from the Sadr A^zam to the Khan's address in which the recognition by Persia of the independence of Herat was more clearly and emphatically declared than in the Agreement itself. he The Agreement of 1853 had been imposed on the Persian Govern- of ment, who executed it with a bad grace; and it marked the beginning of a period of steadily increasing trouble between Persia and Britain, due partly to other controversies and partly to a mistaken apprehension by the Persian Government of the situation of Brifcain as affected by the Crimean War (1854—56). Persia at firsts sought to arrange a quadripartite treaty between her self, Herat, Kabul, and Q-andahar, which would have given her a commanding influence in Afghan politics ; and thwarted in this by the opposition of Dost Muhammad Khan of Kabul, who now inclined to a British alliance, she next tried to embroil the Herat Government with that of Qandahar and so create a pretext for intervention by herself under the Agreement of 1853. Dost Muhammad Khan, alarmed by the threatening attitude of Persia towards Afghanistan as a whole, then entered into a treaty of peace and friendship with the Hon^ble East India Company, signed on the 30th March 1855. Almost simutoe- ously Mubammad Yusuf, a Sadozai Prince of good character and a nephew of the late Kamran, who had been living for some time under Persian protection at Mashhad, succeeded in possessing himself of Herat with the good will of the inhabitants ; and Sa'id Muhammad Khan, having fallen into his hands, was put to death in revenge for the murd 61 of Kamran by Yar Muhammad Khan. In the spring of 1856 the Persian Government, presuming on the supposed embarrassments of Britain, whose representative had laM^ withdrawn from Tehran in consequence of other disputes, or wishing perhaps to gain advantages at Herat which could be relinquished later on in part settlement of British claims, despatched troops to Herat; these were at first readily admitted to the town by Muhammad Yus u in whose interests they were ostensibly sent. This Persian occupation lasted only a few weeks; a rising occurred which resulted in tIie2009 expulsion of the Persians from the town; and Muhammad Yusuf then hoisted the British flag and applied to Dost Muhammad Khan for aid against the Persians. Almost immediately^ however^ another internal revolution took place at Herat; Muhammad Yusuf was deposed and handed over a prisoner to the Persians ; and charge of Herat was assumed by his Lieutenant ^Isa Khan who was equally resolved^ as the event proved^ to maintain the independence of Herat. ''Isa Khan held out gallantly for a time ; bat at length, on the 26th October 1856, direction of the operations against the town having meanwhile been transferred from Sultan Murad Mirza to M. Biihler, a .French officer of engineers in the service of the Shah, he was obliged to capitulate, and the Persians re-entered Herat. ''Isa Khan was treacherously put to death, in disregard of previous assurances of pardon and favour ; and Sultan Murad Mirza was installed in the Government of Herat. War was at this juncture declared by Britain against Persia, the principal ground being the occupation of Herat by Persia; and, under the Treaty of Peace which ended it, the Persian Govern ment undertook to evacuate Herat and to recognise the independence of that principality, and of all Afghanistan, in relation to Persia. The Persian Government, however, by astute manoeuvring, succeeded in preserving for a time supreme influence at Herat. The sons of Sa^id Muhammad Khan were enabled to assassinate at Tehran Muhammad Yusuf, their father's murderer, who might probably have regarded him self, as indebted to the British Government if he had been restored to power at Herat; and when, on the 27th July 1857, Herat was formally retransferred to Afghan administration, the ruler left in possession was Sultan Ahmed Khan, a Barakzai and a nephew and son-in-law of Dost Muhammad Khan, but devoted to the interests of the Persian Government with whom he had sought and found asylum from his uncle, and secretly pledged to strike his coinage, and cause the Khutbah to be pronounced in his dominions, in the Shah^s name. British action was thus completely stultified; and British remonstrances, there being no violation except in spirit of the Treaty of Peace with Persia, proved unavailing. Though Sultan Ahmad Khan, who had watched—if he had not taken part in—the assassination of the British Envoy at Kabul in 1841, w as not a persona grata to the British Government, he was in other Aspects well fitted to govern Herat; and chiefly to emphasise his uidepedence, a British Mission under Colonel Taylor was sent from Tehran to congratulate him on his accession and promise him moral Evacuation of Herat by the Persians and installa tion of Sultan Ahmad Khan, 1857.

He continued^ nevertheless, to behave in every respect as a vassal of Persia. In 1858 he received a Russian Mission under M, KhanikofP at Herat, but he gave it no encouragement. The Persian province of Khurasan suffered greatly at this time from Turkman raids, and this circumstance was an important factor in the relations of Persia with Herat. According to one Persian official, chief object in desiring possession of Herat was merely to secure a for operations against Merv. Early in 1855 His Royal Highness Sultan Murad Mirza, then Governor-General of Khurasan, invaded Turkistan and temporarily occupied Merv; but Herat affairs soon diverted the attention of the Persian Government to another quarter. In 1858, after the settlement of the Herat question, a Persian army again beseiged Merv, but was almost annihilated by the Turkmans ^ a Herat! force, however, was successful, soon ?fter, in visiting the Turkmans with condign punishment. Somewhat later the Persian Government substi* tuted His Royal Highness Hamzah Mirza for Sultan Murad Mirza in the Governor-Generalship of Khurasan, and this change was followed by a Persian advance against Merv, in June 1860, in very great force] but the operations again resulted in the almost total destruction of the Persian army. In September 1861, Hamzah Mirza having in the mean time been recalled, an effort was made by the Persian Government to retrieve this disaster ; but the force which they sent was routed and cut to pieces before it reached Sarakhs. Dost Muhammad Khan, the Amir of Kabul, had solne years teen gradually extending the limits of his power in Afghanistan. In 1855; on the death of Kuhndil Khan, Sardar of Qandahar, he annexed that principality to his own dominions; and in 1856, Herat being then in the power of the Persians he took possession of Farah, an undoubted depen dency of Herat. In 1862 Sultan Ahmad Khan availed himself of local troubles to expel the Kabuli garrison of Farah ,* and Dost Muhammad Khan instantly replied to his action by marching against Herat. I n June the Amir was at Qandahar, and by October he had closely invested the town of Herat. The siege continued until May 1863, when Herat fell and was incorporated with the Afghan principality of Kabul; no w called Afghanistan. Sultan Ahmad Khan had died of apoplexy shoitly before the capture of the place, and Dost Muhammad Khan hims^ expired in the month of June following. The proceedings of Dost Muhammad Khan excited the liveliest app 10 ' hensions on the part of the Persian Government, who regarded the cation of Afganistan with dismay and feared that the next undertakem 2011 of the Afghan Amir, if successful at Herat, would be an invasion of Khurasan with Turkman support. Sultan Murad Mirza ; better known as the Hesam -us-Saltaneh, was accordingly posted at Qalandarabad between Mashhad and the Herat frontier with a force of 14,000 men, including 6,000 regular infantry, ostensibly to hold Turkmans in check ; }[:, Eastwick of the British Legation at Tehran, who had served under Sir J. Outram in Sind and had held charge of Shikarpur during the Afghan war, was deputed to the Persian camp, though for what purpose is not very clear. Mr. Eastwick had a correspondence, but of avery ordinary character, with Dost Muhammad Khan, whom he proposed to visit but did not visit j and his non-interference to prevent the fall of Herat caused acute disappointment to the Persians, who had counted on his intervention. There was force in the Persian argument that the case was one in which, under the Agreement of 1853, the British it i Government ought to have lent their good offices ; but there was force II also in the Afghan contention that the Persians had, by inducing Sultan in Ahmad Khan to coin money and have the Khutbah read in the name of it I: the Shah of Persia, forfeited their claim to the benefits of British inter- Ofiti; vention. k On the death of Dost Muhammad Khan, Shir ^Ali Khan, whom he Government rilt _ ; . .. of Herat by liad nominated to be his successor, hurried to Kabul, leaving Herat ^in Muhammad charge of his son Muhammad Ya^qub Khan. The Young Khan succeeded , in maintaining himself in possession during the troubles which ensued j throughout Afghanistan, and observed a correct but altogether independent ^ attitude towards the Persian Government. Herat thereafter remained a province of Afghanistan and did not again give rise to differences between ^ Britain and Persia, tuili In 1863 a dispute arose between the Persian Government and the Perso -Af- Afghans in regard to the frontier province of Sistan; and the good offices fi^gard^to of the British Government were invoked by Persia, but were withheld, ^^872 Afghanistan being then in a state of confusion.

Failing in this, he gave himself up to the British Consul General at Mashhad in November of the same year, and was sent under an escort to the Turkish frontier and so removed,, via Baghdad, to India, where he has since resided under surveillance. The Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Muslnr-nd- Dauleh, who was alleged to have connived at his escape from Tehran, was dismissed from office. Relations of Britain with Persia, 1848—96. Anglo- Ihe relations o£ Britain with Persia during* the long reign of Nasir' ud-Din Shan were on the whole excellent^ except during one period of strain which began in 1854 and ended with the Anglo-Persian war of 1856-57, following a diplomatic rupture^ after which matters re sumed their i ordinary course. The Crimean War was largely responsible for this interruption of Anglo-Persian amity ; it will be recollected that the hostilities between Turkey and Eussia began in October 1853, that Britain and 1 ranee were drawn into the struggle in March 1854, and that peace was not concluded until March 1856. A last indication of friendliness on the part of the Persian Govern- vention relat- nien ^ beginning of the period was their acceptance in 1861 of a ing to the Convention in restraint of the slave trade, for the conclusion of which slave trade, ^ o -x- t, . m . ■ 1851. rSrmsn representative at Tehran had for some time laboured in vainj it was granted as a set-off to the compliance by the Persian Governing with a Russian demand of a more questionable character which will he mentioned further on, and its conclusion was one of the last notable acts of the Amir Nizam.

Thomson, the British Minister in Persia, nominated this indi- 55; and * yidual to the First Persian Secretaryship of the British Legation ; but his of theBritLh nlnvment in that post was strenuously opposed by the Sadr A'zam, who Mission from ein P ^ 11 i ; itt TorK-n/r Tehran, 5tb disliked him personally, and was not pressed. In June 1855 Mr. December Thomson proposed to send Hashim Khan to Shiraz, instead, as British 1855 ' Agent at that place, — an alternative which the Sadr A-'zam himself had suggested, but, when steps were taken bj the Hon^ble* C. A. Murray, Mr. Thomson^ successor, to carry out this arrangement, the Persian Government refused to sanction it and intimated that Hashim Khan would not be allowed to accept any post under the British Government. The reason assigned was that Hashim Khan had never been formally discharged from the Shah^s service, to which he had once belonged ; but this was the merest subterfuge, for no custom of granting formal dis charges from the Shah^s employment had ever existed. The Persian Government added that, if Hashim Khan tried to make his way to Shiraz, he would be arrested ,* and on Mr. Murray^s remonstrating with them on the subject of this threatj they caused Hashim Khan^s wife, who was a sister of one of the Shah^s wives^ to be arrested. Hashim Khan himself apparently continued to reside in safety within the pre- i cincts of the British Legation. Mr. Murray demanded the release of the lady, as being the wife of a British employ^, and informed the Persian Government that, if this were granted and if immunity from punishment and employment on suitable terms in the Persian service were guaranteed to Hashim Khan, he would discharge that person from the British service. Efforts to accommodate the matter on this basis were made by the Turkish and French representatives at Tehran, who feared the results of a breach between Britain and Persia while Turkey, France and Britain continued to be at war with Russia, but in vain. The Sadr A ; zam then produced charges against Mr. Thomson and Mr. Murray of having retained Hashim Khan solely on account of his wife, with whom—he alleged—they had held improper relations. In assuming an aggressive tone the Persian Prime Minister may have been ;erwliicM ein ^ 0 ldened by the ill-success of the allied arms against Russia in the 0 lastof operations adjoining Persia; and he probably reflected that, [ricliretf 1 ^ an y case, the absence of the British Mission from Tehran would tbeAf* the execution of the designs of his Government upon Herat. the 20th November 1855 Mr. Murray struck his flag ; and on the ^ ^ emai, d9 Sir Charles Murray.

At some time after the British Minister's departure Hashim Khan made his peace with the Persian Government on his renouncing Biitish employment and protection the royal favour, together with a salary, was conferred on him; and the imputations against his wife were retracted by the Sadr A'zam himself, as being merely calumnies concocted to serve a purpose. The Persian preparations against Herat then entered on an active stage, and before the end of December 1855, Sultan Murad Mirza left Tehran to take command of the troops in the field. Unsucoess- The question of a settlement was first opened at Constantinople on Persian January 1856 by the Persian Charge d ; Affaires, who presented at Constant!- ^ ie Ambassador with a memorandum embodying the Persian nople,—Jan. version of the whole case. A separate' statement on the snhject, Dec. 1856. prepared by the Persian Government, seems to have been communicated also to other European Powers. The general effect of the two decn- ments was to attribute the rupture to immoral conduct on the part of Mr. Thomson and Mr. Murray but denunciations of former British Ministers Sir J. McNeill, Sir J. Sheil, and Colonel Farrant—were added as a make-weight. It further appeared that the Shah himself had in December 1855, written an intemperate letter to the Sadr A'Zam, declaring for the information of the foreign Missions, that he would not again receive a British representative at Tehran until the Que® ( Malikeh ) of England had herself apologised to him for the mis - conduct of Mr. Murray ; and that, somewhat earlier, he had personally subscribed to the offensive charges brought against the British repre sentative. After the discussion at Constantinople had continued for some time a British ultimatum was presented to the Persian Charge d'Affaires, requiring that all imputations against Mr. Murray should be withdr^^i that he should be invited to return to Tehran, that he should be honour ably received at the Persian Court with particular ceremonies, and that a salute of 21 guns should be fired on the rehoisting of the British flag, after which the Persian Government must agree to evacuate (or not to occupy ) Herat, while the British Government would refrain from in* ing on the employment of Hasbim Khan at Shlraz, provided only that his wife was restored to him and that arrangements were made to indemnifj(^4# 2015 him for the loss of his British appoi^ment. The terms of this ultima tum were not accepted and the situation was in the meantime aggra vated by a series of insults directed against the British officials and employ^ remaining in Persia. On the 17th October 1856 Farrukh Khan, the Persian Ambassador, arrived at Constantinople with full power to settle all the matters in dispute between Britain and Persia; fresh discussions ensued; and on the 132nd November a modified ultimatum was delivered to Farrukh Khan bj Lord Stratford de Uedcliffe. In this revised document the question of Herat, which was now critical, held the principal place; it was laid down that the Persian Army must be withdrawn from Herat and compensa tion paid for such damage as it had done; that Persia must bv treaty renounce for the future all interference, whether external or internal, in the affairs of Herat, and the other provinces of Afghanistan, and must agree to refer to British mediation such differences as she might have with their rulers; that a new Commercial Treaty between Britain and Persia must be concluded, giving Britain the right to appoint Consuls in any part of Persia • that all debts due to British subjects must be liquidated and disputed claims discussed and settled; that an arrangement must be made in regard to the lease of Bandar ^ Abbas which would be agreeable to tbe Sultan of ; Oman; and that the Sadr A^zam, in consequence of the part played by him in the differences that had ariseu, must be removed from office. The conditions regarding the return to Tehran and recep tion there of the British Mission were maintained, except in so far as the ceremonies required would be affected by the dismissal of the Sadr A'zam. Hesitation was expressed by the Persian Plenipotentiary in regard to acceptance of some of the terms, especially that requiring the dimissal of the Prime Minister; and the arrival of authentic information of the fall of Herat did not, it is probable, increase his disposition to concede any point. Meanwhile on the 1st November 1856 in consequence of previous instructions sent from Europe, the Government of India had declared war on Persia; and towards the end of December, on receiving news of this event, Farrukh Khan broke off the negotiations, declared such engagements as he had already formed to be null and void, and quitted Constantinople. We now proceed to give an account of the Anglo-Persian war in its War between tfiore general aspects, reserving for examination elsewhere the naval and Military operations that took place in the neighbourhood of Bushehr^ at —1857. fchammareh, and on the Karun River. The war with Persia was not popular in Great Britain, where its cause was not known, the papers con-2016 cerning the disputes from which it originated not being published until after the conclusion of peace. The war was undertaken by the Govern ment of the day on their own responsibility; and it was at first con demned by some in Parliament and in the press. The British Qn the 22nd September 1856 instructions to withdraw from Persia to September— Baghdad with his whole establishment were addressed to Mr. Stevens, His October, Britannic Majesty^s Consul at Tehran. He was directed to remove the public archives with him ; to make the best arrangements that he could for the protection in his absence of the Mission premises and such property as must necessarily be left behind ; to decline^ on the ground of Persians attitude with reference to Herat^ any invitation to stay that might be extended to him by the Persian Government ; and to inform British subjects at Tehran of his approaching departure, allowing them at their choice either to accompany him or to remain behind under the protection, which he was to request, of the French Legation. It was intimated to him that a British naval and military expedition would shortly be de spatched to the Persian Gulf, but he was expressly cautioned not to refer to the intentions of the British Government in this respect. His Britan nic Majesty^s Consul at Tabriz was also ordered to leave Persia. Negotiations were opened with Dost Muhammad Khan, the Afghan Amir of Kabul and Qandahar which resulted, on the 26th January 1857, in the conclusion of an agreement directed against Persia ; and a mission under Major Lumsden was sent to Qandahar to supervise the execution of the terms arranged. The agreement provided that the Amir should, from the 1st January 1857, receive a subsidy of Rs. 1,00 ,000 monthly from the Hon^ble East India Company on condition of main taining his existing establishmerit of artillery and cavalry and not less than 18,000 infantry, of whom not less than 13,000 should be regulars, and of communicating to the British Government any overtures which he might receive from Persia, oi from the allies of Persia, during the war ; the past offences of Afghan tribes on the British border should be condoned by the British Govern ment ; ond the Amir should be presented with 4,000 muskets, iu a( ^' tion to 4,000 already given him. The subsidy was to cease at the conclusion of the war, or earlier, at the discretion of the British Govern ment. In the Persian Gulf the British political representatives, evidently acting without authority, offered allowances to various chiefs of the Persian coast districts on condition of their assisting the British m the war : among the chiefs thus tampered with were Baqir Khan^ of2017 lemofj, ttclpi 'ofk Tangistan, the Shaikh of Chah Kutah, and the Khans of Burazjan^ Tul Ganaveh, Rig, and Dilam. These proceedings, which were by the taking of sealed agreements from the chiefs in ques- tkm seem to have been repudiated by the Indian Government with the concurrence of the commander of the British expedition, who recom mended that ' the entire transaction should be annulled, the objection able documents destroyed, and the correspondence obliterated from our records' It may be mentioned that the French sloop of war ' Sybille 3 ' } Captain Maisonneuve, a vessel heavily armed for her size, was sent to the Persian Gulf in advance of the British forces to protect French interests, and show the Persians that the en tente cordiale between France and Britain was still uninterrupted/ 5 and she remained in Persian waters almost until the end of the campaign. As soon as war was seen to be probable the Persian Government made arrangements for strengthening their position in the districts most exposed to attack. Large military reinforcements were despatched from the north to Ears and 'Arabistan in each of which provinces an army of defence was organised. The troops in ^Arabistan were placed under H. R.H. Khanlar Mirza, the Prince-Governor, an uncle of the Shah, who was considered to be one of the best officers in the Persian service; those in Fars were commanded, during the active operations, by the Shuja'-ul-Mulk, a nephew of the Sadr A'zam. The Sarkishikchi-Basli or Commandant of the Shah's Bodyguard, a Qajar prince of high standing 1 , was sent by the Sadr A &gt; zam, as soon as he realised the pro bability of disaster to the Persian arms, to relieve his relative of the com mand in Ears; but the substitute did not arrive upon the spot until the war was practically over in that quarter. Under official instigation an attempt was made to excite, throu ghout Persia, a Jihad or holy war against the British ; but it met with no response. The Persian military leaders qualified the expedient as con temptible ; several high Persian officials condemned it in emphatic terms; the leading Persian merchants disapproved of it ; and for the Persian people it had evidently no attraction. At Shiraz there were e ven indications * of a popular movement in favour of the British.

The annexation of Oudh had lately been effected through Sir J. Outrain who had experience of many other parts of India also ; but when wai with Persia was decided on. he was at home in England. The appoint ment of an officer of his service and antecedents to the chief command was an innovation ; but the result justified his selection in an eminent degree. Sir J. Outram arrived at Bombay on the 22nd December 1856, by which time some preliminary operations had taken place in the Gulf, and sailed again on the 15th January 1857, for Persia. On the 27th January he reached Bushehr, which had been occupied before his arrival The expeditionary force originally destined for Persia, afterwards the 1st Division of the Persian Field Force, was embodied in India with effect from the 30th October 1856 and sailed at various dates on the following month, arriving at the place of rendezvous in the Persian Gulf by the 24th November. It consisted, apparently, of two t squadrons of the 3rd Regiment of (Native) Light Cavalry and two troops of the Poona Irregular Horse ; of the 3rd Troop of Horse Artillery and the 3rd and 5th (European) Light Field Batteries with a reserve ; and of two Infantry Brigades, the first consisting of His Majesty's 64th Regiment of Foot and the 20th Regiment of (Bombay) Native Infantry, the other of the 2nd European Light Infantry, the 4th (Rifle) Regiment of (Bombay) Native Infantry, and the 2nd Baluch Battalion ; together with two Companies of Sappers and Miners. The total strength of the force was 5,670 fighting men, of whom 2,270 were Europeans, with 3,75^) followers, 1,150 horses, and 430 bullocks. It was conveyed to Persia in 37 transports (7 steamers and 30 sailirig ships), escorted by 8 war ^Sir J. Outram (1803 63) was educated at Aberdeen and obtaiRed an Indian cadet- ship in 1819.

These mistakes necessitated some readjust' ment of Sir J. Outranks plans after his arrival at the front. Another disappointment which the commander of the expedition had to face was caused by the discovery that there were no independent I Persian or Arab tribes, such as he had been authorised to enlist^ and on | whose enlistment he had largely counted : all the available local tribes were subjects either of the Shah or of the Sultan of Turkey. Sir J. I Outram^s instructions in regard to his dealings with Persians were explicit. No attempt was to be made to subvert the reigning Shall or his dynasty; the Shah's people were not to be instigated to rebel against their own Government; and no Persian subjects were to be enrolled in the British service. Sir J. Outranks original scheme depended to a great extent upon the organisation of local mounted levies on the model of the Sind Horse,—a task which he intended to entrust to GeneralJacob, i He argued strongly, at first, in favour of a modification of his orders I which would admit of his taking the natives of territory actually occupied into British military service, for he considered that there was little difference in principle between encouraging the inhabitants of districts 1 under occupation to furnish supplies and inducing them to serve as soldiers, he feared that the tribes could not remain neutral and he thought that the future safety of such tribesmen as might enlist witb the British could be sufficiently guaranteed by an amnesty clause inserted in the final treaty of peace, no encouragement being i 11 the meanwhile given to any tribal notions of permanent independence of Persia. The Governor-General of India, however, for various reasons, was strongly opposed to local enlistment ; and Sir J .Outram himself in the end came to disapprove of it, and even wrote to boi ,( i Canning after peace had been concluded : ' Fortunately 1 ^ 110 occasion to resort to the contemplated measure of embodying ^ es from among my so-called f conquered tribes/ for I am now convinced by Your Lordship's unanswerable arguments that I should, by so doing, have committed a very grave error.^ On the other hand, after the war had ceased, authority for the enlistment of local levies was receive^ from Her Majesty's Government who had been persuaded of ei pediency of the measure by Sir J. Outram's original arguments. ^ absence of telegraphic communication had a marked effect upon the conduct of the Anglo-Persian war from first to last.2021 Sir J. Outranks plans contemplated prolonged operations and an Itimate advance into the heart of Persia^ or even to the capital itself, tatei ^ ' The objectives to be attained by the first yearns operations were Shiraz ie ^ 1 aI1( j shuslitar, from both of which Ispahan would be threatened. But the troops at the General's disposal were at first insufficient for simul- taneous action upon two lines ; delay in obtaining land transport for a wci-e jo ^ ^6 prevented any serious movement inland, even from Bushehr; and je ^ toeiilisi. the restrictions placed on the employment of levies greatly increased the 1 a vailaft^ difficulty, in Sir J. Outram's estimation, of reaching Shushtar. Before ^ of Tiifc leaving England he had foreseen the necessity for a 2nd Division ; witl pJ and, though one was organised at his instance, he had long to wait for the reigiji its arrival complete at Bushehr. ^atedtorelslj lu February 1857, finding that the enemy were gathering in strength ^tobul between Bushehr and the hills, Sir J.

Outranks intention^ had the war continued, to place the ragemenU 1st Division at Burazjan in Dashtistan during the summer of 1857, the anent ieif European portion of that force being quartered on the slopes of the lofty wever, fa adjoining mountain of Gisakan, and to locate the 2nd Division in and Sir I ; Arabistan with headquarters at Ahwaz or Shushtar. He looked forward even w# to forcing his way to Shiraz in the autumn of the year, for which purpose rtunatelj^ he estimated that a reinforcement of 7,500 men would be required; and eDik^: he thought that, if Persia still remained obdurate, an advance upon Tehran might be begun in the spring of 1858. It may be mentioned that at one time Sir J. Outram was inclined, F Government approved, to allow the Turks to occupy Muhammareh— ^measure which, as he pointed out, would make them allies with the suaded j 1 ' ritish in the war against Persia instead of neutrals, would justify the 1 fitment of Arab levies in Turkish territory, and would render &gt;d eW 1 o a ^ a( i available as abase for British operations against Persia; but^ I ein g brought into closer contact with local conditions and coming am nw w should, lif !! ier hd : levies^-2022 Operations of the war, 1856-57. Land transport in the war. to know more of the Turkish character and administratiorij he very quickly withdrew some suggestions that he had made on the subject. The principal incidents in this prematurely suspended war were tlie capture of Rishehr on the 9th and of Bushehr on the 10th December 1856; the defeat of the Shuja/-ul-Mulk at Khushab on the 8th February 1857 ; and the bombardment and occupation of Muhammareh, chiefly a naval operation^ on the 26th March. The details of these actions are given elsewhere in the sections that deal with British relations with the Persian Coast and Islands and with ; Arabistan. One of the initial difficulties of the war was the want of land transport, which it was necessary to procure locally. On the 2nd Division being formed, energetic measures to this end were taken in the Persian Gulf region ; and, had the military operations continued longer, an abundant supply of both camels and mules would soon have been available, Lieutenant Pengelley, I.N., who had had experience of land transport with the Turkish Contingent in the Crimean War, was sent to Turkish ''Iraq, where purchasing agencies were established without delay and eventually extended so far to the north as Musal. At the time of the capture of Muhammareh, in March 1857, the British Field Force was still almost entirely without transport; but ten days later some 5;000 camels and 600 mules had been obtained in Turkish ^Iraq, and in another fortnight their shipment had begun at Magil near Basrah. 'When news arrived of the conclusion of peace, the question of hot to dispose of the animals purchased was a serious financial problem, especially as out of 4,000 camels brought from Kuwait and Suq -ash Shtiyukh 1,000 had already died through unskilful management, and there were by this time ^ 15^000 mules in hand. It had been decided, should transport animals be required for operations from Busbehr, to march them thither by land from the Shatt-al- ; Arab undet mili^J «/ i or levy escorts which might have taken about two months. Somemu were shipped to Bushehr for the use of the force left there after the conclusion of the peace. The superfluous camels seem in the have been sold on the spot for what they would fetch, while balance of the mules, after being collected at Baghdad for sale; were July 1857 marched down to Magil and there embarked for probably for use in the suppression of the Mutiny in India. * Sic in Outram** Persian Campaign, page 350, but the figure may be a for 1,500.2023 M -iji' The arrangements in the Commissariat Department in connection w ith the war appear to have been excellent and elicited from Sir J Outran^ after active operations had ceased, the following encomium : I cannot conclude without expressing to your Lordship * my deep sense of grati tude to the Bombay Government. Throughout this expedition their exertions have been unceasing and unwearied, and in every instance my requests in behalf of this force have been scrupulously attended to, and in many instances anticipated. By late letters from Lord Elphinstone, I am informed that no less a quantity than 8,500 tons of coal f have been despatched since January last, the greater portion of which has been made available there and at different parts on the intermediate line, the remainder being on its way. We are, further, in actual receipt, or in expectation of up wards of 70,000 bales of compressed hay, amounting to no less than 14,000,000 pounds. This, in addition to the supplies from the Shafc-al-Arab, would, had the war continued, have sufficed to provision the whole of our cavalry and baggage cattle for some months to come. The extraordinary labour and diligence which must have been used to collect and despatch these stores, and therewith also other stores for the immediate and prospective wants of the array, deserve the highest acknowledgment on my part and I feel persuaded that the prevailing sentiment of this army, at seeing its wants so carefully attended to, is one of heartfelt gratitude to a really provident and paternal Government. This opinion of the General in command regarding the provision made for the welfare of the force was borne out by the general good health ol the troops. There was some sickness at first in the 2nd ilutopean Kegiment, and later among the 4th Rifles; but after the Burazjan raid, which had a tonic effect on the force ; the number of sick in hospital fell below 8 per cent., and in May Sir J. Outram was able to report that the European units were returning to India in better nealth than they had left it. Base hospitals were organised on Kharag Island at an early stage of the campaign ; and arrangements were made for a hospital ship at Muhammareh to receive cases from the 2nd Divi sion on board, of which the more serious were to be forwarded to Kharag. As it was expected that the hot season would prejudicially affect the health of the force, much thought was given to the question of summer accommodation for the troops^ particularly the Europeans^ in case their retention in Persia should be necessary as was at first expected. It should be mentioned that on the morning of the 14th March 1857 General Stalker, commanding the 1st Division, committed suicide by footing himself through the head with a pistol; and that on the 16 th 1 Lord Canning, Governor General of India. t Scarcity of coal was at one time a serious difficulty, a shortage having apparently occurred even at Bombay. A fortnight before the attack on Muhainmerah the vessels of the fleet had only enough coal for 7 days' steaming. JBsshehr, Commissariat arrangements in the war. Health of the troops. Suicided of General Stalker and Commodore Ethersey.2024 Britisk political represen tation in the war. Commodore Ethersey^ the senior officer of the Indian Navy in the Per- sian Gulf ; took his own life in a similar manner. Neither tragedy was attributable to any disagreement with superior authority. Witli General Stalker the causes seem to have been over-anxiety as to the hutting of his European troops and the receipt of bad news of a private character from India, acting on a mind temporarily enfeebled by indisposition contract* ed on the Burazjan raid. Commodore Ethersey, who had asked leave to retire from the service two years previously on account of failing health, appears to have succumbed to a fear that he might mismanage the naval attack on Muhammareh, which was impending; but he was also affected, in all probability, by General Stalkers melancholy example. Supreme political as well as military control of the expedition was vested, as already remarked, in Sir J. Outram ; and that judicious leader did not fail to turn to the best account all the knowledge and experi ence of such political officers as were within his reach, whether under his authority or not. The Hon^ble C. A. Murray, late British Minister at Tehran and temporarily residing at Baghdad, visited Bushehr at the beginning of the war, accompanied by Dr. Dickson, the physician to the British Lega tion in Persia. He came by way of Basrah, descending the Shatt -al-'Arab in the ' Hugh Lindsay/'' and passing Muhammareh with his flag at the mast-head, yet without drawing the fire of the Persian batteries,— a circumstance which the author * by whom it is mentioned inter prets as a courtesy on the part of the Persians towards a British Minister. Sir J. Outram on arrival at Bushehr found Mr. Murray there, and a cordial interview took place between them ; nor did Mr.. Murray leave again for Baghdad until the 23rd of February. He was apparently in favour of vigorous measures against Persia,— : an attitude very natural on his part in view of the causes of his retirement from Tehran. It was at nrst ordered that Commander Felix Jones, I.N., the B^si- dent in the Persian Gulf, should cease to exercise his functions as such on the arrival of the expeditionary force and that he should be attached, as a Political Agent with advisory powers, to the staff of the General io command. After the occupation of Bushehr Commander Was employed, with his Assistant Lieutenant Disbrowe, ' i 11 * Watson in his History of Persia, page 447, footnote. But it may be doubted whether Persian artillery officers would be able to distinguish one British flag fr0111 another ; and it does not appear that dtiy British vessel in the river was fired, od by ^ Persians before the ' Comet ' on the 3rd March which on her previous downward journey had passed without annoyance.2025 co: aitii ^fidence to the townspeople^ securing the magazines, granaries, and other public stores, endeavouring to re-open the bazaars, and in adopting measures for the public safety, as well as in taking steps for obtaining supplies. 1 ' Later, it would seem, on the recommendation of Sir J. Outram, he was replaced in the position of Resident, at least with re ference to territories not included in the sphere of operations. At the end of January 1857 Commander Jones was sent, along with the ftev. P. Badger, who accompanied the forces in the capacity of Arabic interpreter to Sir J. Outram, as well as of chaplain, to advise the Arabs of Muhammareh to remain neutral in the approaching struggle at that place ; and in the course of a fortnight he returned with a chart of the river at Muhammareh and a sketch of the enemy ; s works, which he had prepared. Commander Jones was not present at the actions of Khushab or Muhammareh ; but he and Lieutenant Disbrowe were mentioned in despatches, notwithstanding the unfavourable notice which the engagements obtained by them from chiefs under the Persian Government had attracted, for aid willingly rendered to the military authorities. At the end of April Sir J. Outram advised Commander Jones not to delay any longer a tour which he proposed making, in the character of Resident, to various ports in his jurisdiction. A political assistant on whose services Sir J. Outram appears to have set a higher value was Captain A. B. Kemball^ British Political Agent in Turkish Arabia, who arrived at Bushehr from Baghdad towards the end of February 1857 and apparently placed himself at the disposal of the General. Early in March Sir J. Outram sent him and the Rev. Mr. Badger to Basrah to remove objections which were being raised by the Turks to the intended British operations at Muhammareh, and to Muhammareh or its neighbourhood to obtain information of the enemy^s strength and dispositions,—two tasks in which Captain Kemball and his colleague seem to have succeeded admirably. Mr. Badger appears to have visited Kuwait a little later and to have brought back with him some useful political information. Captain Kemball accompanied the flying * Captain (afterwards General Sir) Arnold Burrowes Kemball entered the Bombay Artillery in 1837. He saw service in Afghanistan, at Ghazni, in 1839 ; and in 1841 he became Assistant Resident in the Persian Gulf. In 1855 he was promoted to the ' s: : ^oiitical Agency in Turkish 'Iraq, in which he had previously officiated ; and an acc ount of his services at Baghdad will be found in the chapter on the history of that ri. province. In 1873 he attended the Shah of Persia during his first visit to England. ^ 1875-76, as mentioned elsewhere, he was employed on a Turko-Persian Boundary Commission at Constantinople ; and in 1876 he accompanied tha Turkish army in ei, via as a British Commissioner.2026 Attitude of the Turkish Government. column which pursued to Ahwaz the Persian force expelled from Muhammareh ; and a few days later Sir J. Outram applied to the Indian authorities to regularise Captain KembalFs presence on his staff by appointing a locum tenens in his place at Baghdad. Captain KembalFs services on the campaign; as also those of the Eev. Mr. Badger, were afterwards highly commended by Sir J. Outran^ both publicly and privately. ' Pelly/'' no doubt the same who a few years late attained distinc tion as Resident in the Persian Gulf and became well known as Sir Lewis Pelly, visited Baghdad from Muhammareh in April-May 1857 ; but it does not appear in what capacity he was at this time employed. The attitude of the Turkish Government during the Anglo -Persian War was, so far as could be judged from the behaviour of their local officials at Basrah and Baghdad^ favourable to the British. It is true that, at the end of February 1857, Rashid Pasha, Governor of Basrah, protested in writing to Captain Kemball against the contemplated British attack on Muhammareh, alleging that the place was claimed by Turkey ; but Captain Kemball, deputed for the plirpose by Sir I Outram, succeeded in inducing him not only to withdraw his objectioiiS) but also to remove a Turkish war vessel which was stationed at the mouth of the Karun. The argument used by Captain Kemball was ; apparently, that the rights of Turkey to Muhammareh, whatever they might be, could not suffer through the expulsion by the British of the Persians, who were at the moment in armed possession; and firing the Persians, on the 3rd March, upon the British steamer ' Comet as she passed Muhammareh seems to have disinclined the Pasha to insist on the neutrality of the river, as it had been apprehended that he might do. Soon after the capture of Muhammareh by the British forces Ilashid Pasha betook himself to Baghdad to agitate for the tralisfer of the place to Turkey, and his acting substitute proposed to replace the Turkish guardship at the mouth of the Karun ; but the latter demand was staved off, and the Pasha^s manoeuvres at Baghdad proved ineffectual. Neither step on the part of the Turk had any connection with Sir J. Outranks transient idea, already mentioned, of placing Muhammareh in Turkish charge ; bat it is probable that the magnitude of the preparations made by the Persians for the defence of Muhammareh was due partly to a fear that Muhammareh, if ^ ell; might be handed over by the British to the Turks. The Turkish authorities threw no obstacles in the way of the p ur chase in Turkish Iraq of transport animals for the British Field Force;(fl4£ 2027 but they prohibited their subjects from taking part in the war, and they even exacted security not to cross the frontier into Persia from those of them who were engaged to drive the animals purchased by the British Government to Basrah. This last precaution, however, was stated by Eashid Pasha himself to be merely a pro forma proceeding, of which the real object was to prevent the men employed with the animals from passing as an organised body into the British service. Numerous bashi -bazouks appeared who presented certificates of having been employed with British officers in the Crimean War, but it does not appear that their services were accepted. The dissolution of the British Field Force in Persia was Undertaken Bissola-^ by Sir J. Outram irrespective of the outbreak of the Indian Mutiny, Field Force, news of which did not reach him till the 7th of June or about a month afterwards, when he was at Baghdad. He was probably to some extent aware of the critical state of affairs in India, for on the 27th April he had referred to a the mutinous spirit so extensively displayed in the Bengal army ^ and had remarked that, ' as at present constituted, the Bengal Army never can be depended on j' but he seems at first to have been under the impression that troops which he was being urged to send back to India were required for service not there but in China. Although his instructions from England did not authorise him to reduce the force in Persia until the Treaty of Peace concluded had been ratified by the Shah, he decided to send away^a portion of it without waiting for official information of that event, which, however, almost immediately reached him. A Field Force order, dated Muhammareh, the 9th May 1857, directed that the following troops should be held in readiness to embark for India:* H. M/s 14th Dragoons, the Srd Troop of Horse Artillery, the 2nd Light Field Battery, and the reserve Companies of Artillery, H. M/s 4th Regiment of Foot, H. M/s 78th High landers, the 2nd European Light Infantry, the Light Battalion, and the Madras Sappers and Miners. On the 17th May the evacuation of Muhammareh by the Second Division was completed, the sloop of war ' Clivealone remaining to prevent the re-Occupation of the place by the Persians, and General Havelock and his staff sailed for India, where one t of the officers of the party on board wrote, ' a new field for adventure, though a melancholy one for military distinction, opened out to the comrade regiments in Persia/ 5 The 28rd Native Light Infantry # As a matter of fact this regiment had already sailed on and before the 3rd May* t Captain G. H. Hunt :—see his Outram and Eaveloch's Persian Campaign, page202^ and 26th Native Infantry were transferred to the 1st Division, wHeli was left, under the command of General Jacob^ in occupation of Busheh and Kharag and consisted of the following units : the 3rd Light Cavalry, Sind Irregular Horse, Poona Irregular Horse, and Aden Troop,* forming a cavalry brigade under Brigadier Steuart; the 4th Troop of Horse Artillery, 3rd, 5th and 8th t Ligh Field Batteries, and 3rd Company of the 2nd and 4th Company of the 4th Artillery Battalion, commanded asau artillery brigade by Jjieutenant-Colonel Trevelyan, with two companies of Sappers and Miners; the 20th and ^6th Native Infantry, making one infantry brigade under Colonel Macan ; and the 4th Native Infantry, 23id Native Light Infantry and 2nd Baluch Battalion making another under Colonel Honner. On the 23rd May the strength of the Bushehr force was approximately 7,000 men, of all arms, the European troops (except some artillery) having by then left for India. The troop of Horse Artillery and two batteries were afterwards sent away, and other reduc tions also must have been effected, for on the 17th June, the day of Sir J. Outram s own departure for Karachi, the Bushehr force consisted, excluding officers but including the garrison on Kharag, of 1,200 cavaby, 278 artillery, 3,739 infantry, and 214 Sappers and Miners,—in all 5,431 fighting men of whom only 202 (artillery) were Europeans. The sick in hospital numbered 534, or about 10 percent, of the whole, but their ailments were mostly trifling. On the departure of Sir J. Outram the political as well as military charge devolved on General Jacob. The military results of the war, notwithstanding its short duration, were perfectly conclusive. Nowhere had the Persian forces, though fighting in every case on ground chosen by themselves and with a great numerical superiority on their side, shown any ability to withstand a British attack; and it is probable, besides, that after the capture and destruction of the Persian magazines at Bushehr, Chah Kutah, Burazjan and Muhammareh, little war material remained in the country, the Persian armies of Ears and Arabistan being thereafter certainly reduced, as regards ammunition, to the supply that they happened to be carrying with them in the field. The excellent conduct of the British troops in camp and on the march enhanced the political values of their victories; Sii' J. Outram observed, in his order breaking up the Field Force, that scarcely one instance of misconduct on the part of any individual^ had been brought to his notice during the whole campaign, and the Govern - ment of India thought themselves justified m remarking, in a notifica* * When the Aden Troop arrived in the Persian Gulf, or when it left, is not clear. t The 8th Light Field Battery had only just arrived from India bj sailing ships.y 2029 tion published on the 6th November 1857, that 'the British troops leare behind them in Persia a reputation, not for valour alone, but for dis cipline, moderation and justice.*' In addressing the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs regarding his dealings with the Arab tribes Sir J. Outram, shortly before his departure from Persia, wrote :— ' It will be as satisfactory to your Lordship as it is to myself, to know, that whilst our relations with the Arab tribes have been carried on in the most friendly spirit, in no one instance has their presumed loyalty to the Shah been tampered with, neither have we fettered ourselves ^ith a single after engagement towards them. 'Their only regret seemed to be, that we were not to continue in permanent posses sion of their country, and when it is remembered that such sentiments were expressed after our victorious troops had occupied their soil for nearly two months r the fact re flects the highest credit upon the discipline and morale of our Anglo-Indian army.' But the most convincing evidence of the moral effect of the war on the people of Persia, as distinguished from the Persian Governmentj was supplied by Colonel Taylor, Herat Commissioner^ who reported as follows more than a year after the ratification of, the Treaty of Peace ;— ... during my march through Persia I have observed in many instances the good effects of the late occupations by British troops. The whole people of Fars (Southern Persia) are loud in their praises of the justice and humanity evinced on every occasion by all officers with whom they came into contact; the treating wounded soldiers and pre senting them with a gratuity on their recovery was contrasted with the conduct of their own people, who instantly plundered them of the clothes and money they had received, from their enemies ; the prompt payment and liberal price given for every necessary article has kept up the impression of the unlimited resources of the Government, and the wealth of individuals. Throughout the country, overtures have been made to me by all classes, and not only unsought, but positively discouraged. The soldiers at Shiraz spoke out boldly against the Shooja-ool-Moolk (the Hero of Kooshab) and their other officers. The Elkhaneey (the most influential man in all Fars) remarked that we could take the low country easily enough, but that we should find difficulty in forcing the passes, ' which,' he significantly added, 'are in my hands.' He continued, 'your Government makes a mistake in not placing chiefs in higher positions: when Fars is annexed, confer the rank of Colonel, etc., and do not limit them to soobadars and jemadars.' The eldest son of the Tungistan chief, who has the sole control of everything, said with much emphasis, that the next time British troops came into Persia, he should join them bodily with every efficient man, without even waiting for a guarantee for the future. To all these overtures I gave a general assurance that the English Government was not disposed to weaken Persia, but rather keep her strong, as was manifested by the mild chastisement inflicted on the occasion of the last war ; but, I added, that their appreciation of the justice, humanity, and liberality of the English officers could not ail to afford satisfaction to the Governor-General. At the conclusion of the operations the relations between the British ^ P er sian military chiefs were friendly, though not close; and no2030 bitterness in regard to the events of the war was manifested by the Persian Government, unless in the punishment of some of their own officers and soldiers by whose cowardice they had been disgraced. Satisfaction The result of the campaign gave keen satisfaction to the Nawab IqlSl-ud^k Iqbal-ud-Dauleh, a British political pensioner at Baghdad^ as may be Pauleh. gathered from the following lines written by Sir J. Outram to General Jacob at Bushehr on the 13th May 1857 : I send an original letter, and its translation, from a member of tbe royal family of Oude, who resides at Bagdad, and was by some considered the rightful heir to that throne, when the ex-king succeeded. I would not, of course, accept his proffered present for the troops, referred to in his letter ; but, perhaps, you may think it right to com municate to them the warm congratulations of their countryman, which Kemball as sures me are perfectly sincere; for the Nawab has always stood up manfully for the character of the Indian soldiers when sneered at, as heretofore the Bagdadees, and Per- sians especially, were wont to indulge in (sic). The gift offered was not accepted ; but the NawaVs letter was com municated to the native troops and was acknowledged by General Jacob on their behalf in cordial and characteristic terms. Anglo-Per* A Treaty of Peace, terminating the war, was signed at Paris on the 4th of a peace^con- M arc b 1857, the Persian plenipotentiary being the same Parrukh Khan, eluded 4th a Kashani, who had conducted the abortive negotiations at Constanti' March and &lt; _ ^ ratified 13th nople in 1856 on the part of his Government j he was rewarded by the April, 1857, a j ewe iT ec [ gi rc ll e valued at £10,000, and not long afterwards he was promoted to the Ministership of the Interior with the title of Amin-ud-Dauleh. The slowness of communications at the time pre judiced both parties to the peace, for intelligence of the British victory of Khushab did not reach Paris in time to influence the discussion of the terms, while on the other hand the news of the conclusion of peace arrived too late in the Persian Gulf to save the Persians their crowning humiliation at Muhammareh. The Treaty was the result of the occu pation of Rishehr and Bushehr alone. Its main provisions were : the establishment of perpetual peace and friendship between Britain and Persia from the date of exchange of ratifications, which was to take place within three months; the release of prisoners of war on both sides; a complete amnesty for all Persian subjects who might have compromised themselves by their relations with the British forces during the war ; the withdrawal by the Persians of their troops and officials, within three months after ratification; hM Herat and every other part of Afghanistan; the relinquishment by Persia of all claims to sovereignty over, and demands for proofs of obedience from, the principality of Herat, recognition by her of the2031 V ? independence of Herat and the whole of Afghanistan^ entire abstinence on beiij ker part for the future from interference in the internal affairs of Afghan istan, the submission of her differences with Herat and Afghanistan thereafter to British mediation^ and the intervention of Britain—when appealed to by the Persian Government—for the purpose of adjusting such differences ; the restriction of Persian military operations in Afghan' istan, in event of the failure of British mediation,, to purely tempor ary measures ; the release without ransom of all Afghan political prison ers and detenus in Persia^ provided a corresponding release were made by the Afghan authorities, the process to be carried out (if necessary) by a Commission of British and Persian representatives ; the establish ment of consular officers of all ranks by either country in the dominions of the other on fche footing of the most favoured nation, their recognition correspondingly, and the mutual treatment on a similar basis of subjects and trade; the return of the British Mission to Tehran and its reception there with certain prescribed apologies and ceremonies; the appointment, within three months after the return of the Mission, of a Persian Commissioner to enquire, in conjunction with a British Commissioner, into the pecuniary claims of British subjects against the Persian Government, and the liquidation within a year of such claims as should be held proved, also the settlement of similar * claims of Persian and other subjects who until the departure of the British Mission had been under British protection and had not since renounced it; the abandonment by the British Government, for the future, of the right of protecting Persian subjects not actually in the employ ment of the British Legation or of British consular officers, provided that no such right were accorded to or exercised by other foreign powers in Persia, and the enjoyment by the British Government, its servants and subjects, in Persia, of the same privileges and immunities as were enjoyed by the most favoured foreign power, its servants and subjects ; and finally, the renewal of the A greement of August 1851 relating to the slave trade. The penultimate Article of the Treaty ran : Immediately on the exchange of the ratifications of this Treaty, the British troops will desist from all acts of hostility against Persia, and the British Government engages further that as soon as the stipulations in regard to the evacuation by the Persian troops of Herat and the Afghan territories, as well as in regard to the ■ 1 * A case belonging to this category, that of Mir 'Ali Na,qi Khan, dragged on till 863, when Mr. Eastwick succeeded in settling it personally with H.

An Annexure to the Treaty laid down in detail the satisfaction to be afforded to Mr. Murray on arrival at Tehran. No previous Treaty or Agreement between Britain and Persia was revived by the Treaty of Peace, except that of August 1851, as already mentioned. The moderation of the terms arranged excited some surprise, especially in Persia itself, where the Sadr A'zam, whose policy of irrita tion and defiance had provoked the war, on learning that his own dis missal was not required, breathed a fervent ' God be praised ! ' ; but the same moderation no doubt prevented a reaction in Persia against the settlement when, later, the difficulties of Britain in the Indian Mutiny declared themselves. General Jacob, it is true, held that Arabistan, Bushehr, and Kharag should have been permanently incor porated wiiih the British dominions ; and Sir J. Oufcram himself was in favour, as will be shown further on, of the retention of Kharag, but the conclusion of peace without reference to him robbed him of an oppor tunity of making recommendations on the subject. The Treaty was ratified by the Shah on the 18th April 1857 ; and the ratifications were exchanged at Baghdad, where Mr. Murray then was, on the 2nd May. Co^onS 0f 0n tiie evacuation Muhammareh, on the 17th May, Sir J. Outram Taylor to proceeded to Baghdad, accompanied by Captain Kemball, Political Herat, 1857- Agent in Turkish 'Iraq, partly to confer with Mr. Murray on the sub ject of a proposed political mission to Herat, and partly to arrange, with Captain Kemhall's help, for the disposal of the land transport left over from the expedition. He arrived at Baghdad about the May and seems to have left it again about the 8th June. Mr. Murray thought he found warrant for the despatch of a mission to Herat in the article of the Treaty relating to the mutual release of Afghan and Persian poli tical prisoners and detenus, which Sir J. Outram considered irrelevant, and he was anxious that strict search should be made for Persian secret agents in Herat, which to Sir J. Outram appeared inexpedient; but the latter thought that a mission to Herat might be advisable, if its sole object was to ascertain that the Persians had really withdrawn from Afghanistan ; and he proposed Captain (Brevet-Lieutenant-Colonel)2033 '''ion 1,1 W'.*, 'Hi, ^alleas ® 4 ' e polcj5(| iiis w n id I Kliaiag,!: liim of ii| Mr. loffif ijjSirJ.Oi 'emkll, Pi nay oflj^ 'toami^ ranspitl^' ie 23rH ; Mumj k eratint^ 1 : or ll' Taylor of the 18tli Native Infantry, as a suitable emissary. Colonel Taylor was eventually ordered to Herat, where he arrived in December 1857, was W eii received bv Sultan Ahmad Khan, the new ruler, and remained till the following March, returning to Bushehr on his way to India at the beginning of June 1858. Meanwhile Mr. Murray had returned to Tehran on the 18th July 1857 ; and, all the requirements of the Treaty in regard to his reception having been honourably executed, preparations were made for the evacu ation by the British troops of Bushehr and Kharag. On the 2nd October 1857 Bushehr was evacuated by the British troops and Commander Felix Jones resumed his duties as Resident there; but a garrison, including the SSrd Native Light Infantry, was temporari ly left, under the command of Brigadier Honner, upon Kharag Island. Meanwhile the Persians continued to occupy Lash-Juwain in Sistan, Eventually, beginning in December 1857, the British garrison on Kharag was also withdrawn, the process being finally completed on the 4th February 1858. After the war the relations of Britain and Persia resumed an ami cable course ; but for a number of years, apart from telegraph operations to be mentioned presently, apathy was the principal characteristic of British policy in regard to Persian affairs. After the serious military reverse which they sustained in Turkistan in 1860, the Persian Govern^ raent once more sought to obtain British officers for the Persian army ; but their proposals were coldly received by the British Government, and the negotiations ultimately^ broke down on a question of the proportion in which the cost of the arrangements should be divided between Persia and India. The Persian request for British military officers was renewed in 1870, when it was again ignored ; and thereafter the guidance of Persia in military affairs passed into the hand of foreigners of other nations. The construction of lines of telegraph in and across Persia between 1861 and 1870, on British advice and by British agency, was a work of great magnitude and in its result conferred vast advantages on the country. It had an excellent and happy effect on Anglo-Persian rela- hons, besides which it maintained British prestige in Persia and kept on 0 mt-Crf' in p- . ^is opportunity is bewailed by the principal writers on British policy Curzc) 01 ' 818 ^ 866 - ^ aw ^ n80n ' s England and Bussia in the East, page 101, and Lord o f - S pages 586-7—and possibly, had it been embraced, the situation rsia a the present time would have been more favourable than it is. 138 Return of the British Lega tion to Tehran, 18th July 1857.

A full account of the telegraph operations in Persia will be found in the Appendix on the Telegraphs of the Persian Gulf, Difficulties in regard to the position of the boundary between Persia and Kalat having arisen in connection with the passage of a telegrapli line through Makran, a joint Anglo-Persian Boundary Commission was suggested in 1S69, formed in 1870, and resulted in September 1871 in the acceptance by the Shah of a frontier proposed by Colonel Golds- mid, the British Commissioner. Details concerning this Commission and its work are given in the chapter on the history of Persian Makran. The establishment of telegraphs drew the attention of commercial Europe to Persia, and projects for the exploitation of the natural and industrial resources of the country followed as a matter of course, Miiza Husain Khan, the enlightened Prime Minister whom the Shah called to office in 1871, showed from the first a strong disposition to a good under' standing, of an active and practical character, with Britain. He did what lay in his power to remove an evil impression that had been pro* duced in Persia by the establishment of close relations between the Government of India and the Amir of Afghanistan in 1869 ; he combated the idea, prevalent in Persia, that in the frontier difficulties between Persia and Turkey, which had become acute, Britain inclined perversely to favour the Turks; and he facilitated, so much as he could, the adjust ment of differences which arose between Britain and Persia in regard to the Makran and Sistan boundaries and to Bahrain affairs. supreme effort of his policy, which ' aimed at the regeneration of Persia through the identification of her interests with those of Great Britain was the Eeuter Concession, granted on the 25th July 1872, not long before the ShaVs first journey to Europe. The concessionaire was Baron Julius de Renter, a naturalised British subject; and the scope of tbe concession itself will appear from the following description of it Sir H. Rawlinson : This gigantic monopoly, at which Europe stood aghast, comprised the following items; the construction of a railway from the Caspian to the Persian Gulf, with any number of subsidiary branches; the laying down of tramways throughout J Kingdom ; the exclusive working of all the Persian mines, excepting those of silver ; the introduction of works of irrigation on whatever scale was deemed exped^ the establishment of a national bank ; the issue of a loan of six millions sterling* a Persian guarantee of 5 per cent, interest, and 2 per cent, sinking fund; tog e ^ JEngland and Russia in the East, page 125.2035 138 a unis tk# ith a right to initiate all remunerative public works, such as lighting with gas, payr m g m belHsliing the capital ; making roads, bridges and embankments ; postal and ff raphic extensions ; mills, factories, and workshops, etc., and filially a farm of the entire customs of the empire for a period of 25 years. The Grant Vizier, who, with his confidential adviser, Mirza Malcom Khan, now minister in England, was responsible for this extraordinary delegation of Imperial powers to the hands of a private company, doubt considered that he had sufficiently protected the interest of the Persiai) Crown, by providing that 20 per cent, of the net profits of the Railway and 15 per ceil t of all other net profits should accrue to the Government; while in respect to the customs, he had stipulated that the aggregate proceeds of the present time should be augmented for five years by an annual fixed sum of £20,000, and during the remainder of the term by a transfer to the Shah of 60 per cent, of the difference between th^ present farm and the actual proceeds. The concession evoked a storm of indignation in Russia^ and eventu ally in Persia itself, where a nationalist party had begun to take shape and chafed against alienation to foreigners of,* the complete and exclu sive control of the whole industrial resources of the empire for a period of seventy years.^ In the autumn of 1873, on his return from his tour in Europe^ the Shah found it necessary, in view of the excited state of public opinion, to rescind the concession entirely. The caution money, amounting to £40,000 was declared forfeited to the Persian Government on the ground of failure by the concession^holder to carry out what he W undertaken to perform within a given period; and for sixteen years, though forfeiture was unjust, the money was not repaid. It has already been mentioned that Nasir-ud-Din Shah, in the course of a European tour, paid a visit to England in 1873. He was attended during his stay there by Sir A. B. Kemball, formerly Assistant Resident at Bushehr and Political Agent in Turkish 'Iraq, There is no doubt that an effort was made in England by the Shah and his Prime Minister, Mirza Husain Khan, who accompanied him, to elicit some admission from the British Foreign Office of the importance of Persia as afactor in the defence of India, and some promise of support; but it was not deemed expedient by the Statesmen to whom they applied to approach Russia^ offended and alarmed as she then was by the still uncancelled Reuter Concession, on the subject of an express renewal of the Russo- British assurances jointly extended to Muhammad Shah on his acces sion j and the conversations ended merely in agreement as to the desir ability of cordial and sympathetic relations being maintained between Britain and Persia, The Shah is also understood to have expressed his dissatisfaction with the award of the British Commissioner in the Sistan boundary case; but no modification of the award resulted. ^England and Russia in the East, Page 125.2036 Slave Trade Convention, 1882. Foundation of the Impe rial Bank of Persia, 1889. The Shah's second visit to England, 1889. British pre ferential rights in regard to railway cons truction in On the Mth June 1882 a permanent Convention between Britain and Persia in regard to the slave trade was substituted for the provisional agreement of 1851, which, renewed by the Treaty of Peace of 1857, had till then remained in force. This Convention is noticed in the special Appendix on the Slave Trade in the Persian Gulf Region. The years 1888 to 1892 were marked by great British financial and commercial activity in Persia, and witnessed the grant of various conces sions to British subjects and the initiation of a number of British enter, prises, some of which had been long under discussion. The opening of the Lower Karun to international navigation may be regarded as a British achievement, inasmuch as it was brought about by British diplomacy ; it is dealt with fully elsewhere, in the chapter on the history of ''Arabistan. Banking operations were begun in Persia, in 1888, by the New Oriental Bank Corporation, which opened agencies in various Persian towns j but this society withdrew from the country two years later in favour of the Imperial Bank of Persia, a concession for the establisbment of which was granted by the Shah in 1889 to Baron de Reuter, pre viously holder of the famous concession of 1872. The Bank's conces sion was for 60 years, during which it was to enjoy a monopoly of issuing bank notes, as well as the exclusive right of working mines (with certain exceptions) throughout Persia, the views of its founders not being restricted to operations of a purely financial character. The retirement of the Imperial Ottoman Bank from Persia in 1893, the Imperial J3ank of Persia simultaneously withdrawing from Baghdad, left the latter for the time being in sole possession of the Persian field. The Bank is at the present day one of the most promiment institutions in Persia, enjoys an almost official status, and has been the parent of other British undertak ings. No political interest seems to attach to the Shah's second visit to England, which was paid in 1889, in the course of his third European tour. He remained in England about a month, attended by Sir H. Wolfp, who then held the office of British Minister at Tehran. In March J 889 Sir H. Drommond WolfP, His Britannic Majesty^ Minister at Tehran, obtained from the Shah an important engagement conferring on Britain preferential rights of railway construction in South ern Persia. In form it was an autograph letter from the Shab to ^2037 tieivr Minister for Foreign Affairs; it was ante-dated 16tli September 1888 &gt; and the important portion of it ran as follows :— Convey these commands to His Excellency, the (British) Minister Plenipotentiary, even give him this very autograph, in order that he may keep it and ba satisfied that Onr former promise with regard to priority of the English Government and the Company of that bovei'nment over others in the construction of a Southern Kailway to Tehran continues to hold good ; and certainly, whenever railway concessions in the north are given to others, immediately a concession for a railway from Tehran to r, or such a one, will be given to the English Company ; and, of course then the and conditions will also be examined in order that it be to Oar advantage and Jt, and for the benefit of the commerce of both parties; and positively no Southern Kailway, without consultation with the English Government, will be granted to any foreign Company. P. 8. And it is clear that in Persia nobody will be granted permission to construct railways, except it be solely commercial ones; We say so now that they may know it. A copy of this letter was communicated to the Russian Minister at Tehran in October 1890, and the assurance which it contained, was repeated by the Shah in writing in November 1890. In 1890 a concession for the construction and exploitation during 60 years of a road conDecting Tehran with Shushtar or Ahwaz, via Qum, Sultanabad ; Burujird, and Khurramabad, was acquired from the original concessionaire, a Persian, by the Imperial Bank of Persia, and work was commenced ; but means have not up to the present been discovered of enabling the road to pass through the disturbed Luristan districts between Khurramabad and 'Arabistan. In the same year a Mining Rights Corporation was formed in order to turn to account the mining privileges of the Imperial Bank j but the operations of this body came to an unsuc cessful end in 1894, largely in consequence of borings for oil unsuccess fully undertaken at Daliki and on the island of Qishm, in the Persian Gulf region. Also in 1890, a monopoly for the holding of lotteries, and another for dealing in tobacco, were unadvisedly granted by the Shah during the temporary absence from his side of the Persian Prime Min ister and of the permanent British representative at Tehran. The former concession was obtained by a Persian subject, who resold it to a British syndicate for £40,000, and the latter by a group of British capitalists. The lotteries concession was afterwards cancelled without compensation, the British speculators lost their money—a circumstance which did increase the popularity of Persian investments in the London market. If i The tobacco concession taken up by an Imperial Tobacco Corpora tion in 1891, also led to trouble ; and, a riot in connection with it having 0cc urredat Tehran in January 1892, it also was withdrawn, but on pay^ ^ntof an indemnity of £500,000 to the investors^ Southern Persia, 1889-90.

The difficulty arcise from the equivocal pdsititm of Persia itself, in contact with Indian questions as that country was and must remain through Afghanistan, Baluchistan and the Persian Gulf, but brought within the purview of European diplomacy also by its relations with Russia and Turkey. 1855'^. tlntil the appointment of the Hon J ble C. A. Murray to be Minister at Tehran in 1855, the post of British'representative in Persia had always been held, with one exception, by officers of Indian training and experi ence ; but, unless in very early times, the instructions on ^vhich they acted had been framed exclusively in London. 1859-60. In 1859, on the transference of the Government of India from the Hon ^ble East India Company to the Crown, an attempt was made to reconcile the conflicting requirements of the situation by placing * ' Teheran establishment under the charge of the Secretary of State for India, instead of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, so as to concede the poiilt that our Persian interests belonged to Indian rathei than to European diplomacy, while at the same time the British represent ative at Teheran remained under the direct Control of the Ctowm As ^ subsidiary measure, Indian officers we're Appointed to the post of Minister and Secretary of Legation, and an Indian character was generally given to the establishment; ' The Minister appointed under these arrangements was Sir H. Rawlinson, formerly Political Agent at * Sir H. Rawlinson's England and Russia in the Hast, page 97- British preferential tramway rights in Southern Persia, 1890.2039 Bagdad I 11 following year, however; the decision was reconsi dered and the Tehran Legation replaced under the Foreign Office, Sir H Rawlinson resigning his appointment as Minister, apparently by way of protest. The question in regard to Tehran was among the subjects submitted ^ a Committee of the House of Commons which was appointed in 1870 to report on the British diplomatic and consular services ; and their find ing on it, dated 18th May 1871, was worded as follows : That while they have received conflicting evidence of the highest authority, on either side of the question, your Committee, on the whole, incline to the opinion, that the Persian Mission should be placed under the authority of the Secretary of State for India; but that if the responsible advisers of the Crown decide that such a change is not for the public interest, your Committee recommend that the members of the Persian Mission generally should be selected by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs from Her Majesty 's Indian Service, and that the present charge of £12,000 a year on the Indian revenues for the expense of such a Mission should be diminishedj so as to throw a larger proportion of the expense upon Imperial revenues. No action was taken on these recommendations, unless such may be traced in subsequent appointments of officers of the Indian army to the fost of military attache at Tehran, or in the selection in 1894 of Sir Mortimer Durand of the Indian Civil Service to be British Minister in Persia. 1870 -71. Relations of Russia with Persia, 1848—1896. The relations of Russia and Persia during the reign of Nasir-ud-Dm Shah present no very salient feature ; but the latter part of the period was marked by increasing Russian influence and pressure^in Northern Persia, which however, ill accordance with the changed spirit of the times, were rather commercial than military in their manifestations. Russian political rivalry of Britain in the Persian field still prevailed, and even became intense j but the aspect w T hich it assumed was outwardly economic, and the Anglo-Russian understanding of 1834 for the main- teiiance of the independence and integrity of Persia still subsisted and was even reaffirmed in 1888. On Easter eve, or Easter night, 1851 a daring raid was made by Turkmali independent Turkmans on the Russian naval station of Ashlirada in the ^ghurada, Caspian j and, notwithstanding the presence of at least one Russian i- 85 !* man-of-war, a clean sweep was made of the settlement, some Itussians being killed, some wounded, and others carried off into captivity. The Russians persisted in attributing blame, in connection with this affair, to2040 the Persian Governor of Mazandaran, who was a brother of the Shall • and prudence in the end obliged the Persian Government to comply with a Rusian demand for his removal. This concession by Persia to Eussia was the basis on which the Anglo-Persian slave trade Agreement of the same year, already referred to, was obtained by the British Minister. the 011 ^ oufcbreak of war between Turkey and Kussia in 1853 the Shah was solicited by Prince Dolgoruki, the Russian Minister at Tehran, ~ throw in his lot with Russia and invade the Turkish provinces of Erzeroum and ''Iraq. One of the baits displayed to him was the prospect of his possessing himself of Baghdad and the Holy Cities of Karbala and Najaf, besides other territories; and it seems to have been promised that Russia would support him in either retaining such districts as he might conquer, or requiring a heavy price in money for their restitution to Turkey. The further inducement was held out of a complete remission, in case Persia actively joined in the war, of the balance of the war indemnity of 1828 still due by Persia to Russia, or, if matters did not go so far, reduction of the balance by such amount as had been spent by Persia in military preparations. These proposals were accepted by the young Shah without reference even to Mirza Agha Khan, his Sadar A zam or Prime Minister, and they were brought to the latter^s knowledge only through the energetic action of the Turkish Ambassador in Persia, who, perceiving indications of what was on foot, threatened to leave Tehran unless satisfactory assurances were immediately forthcoming. Meanwhile, it would appear, secret orders had been sent by the Shah for the assembling of over 50,000 troops at two points near the frontier threatening Erzeroum and Baghdad ; and, as is described in the chapter on the history of Turkish, ''Iraq, Perso-Turkish relations on the border between Muhammareh and Basrah became exceedingly tense. The Sadar A zam, who had in the early days of his power the reputa tion of being an Anglophil, whose rival the Amir Nizam had for that \eiy reason been sustained by the Russian Minister, and who at heart was probably more anti-Russian than he was anti-British, devoted him self, on becoming aware of what was contemplated, to the task of peisuading the Shah to refrain from any formal engagement with Russia; and he even suggested that it might be more to Persians advantage to ally herself with the coalition then forming against Russia,—a p 0 ^ 0 / by which the recovery of the Caucasian districts wrested by Russia from Persia might conceivably be attained. The Shah, swayed by ^ese counsels, in the end refused to continue the negotiations with Russia; and Prince Dalgoruki, who had already advised his Government of the2041 Shah's entire readiness to enter into their views, found himself placed in a highly embarrassing predicament. He argued repeatedly and ve hemently on the subject with the Sadar A^zam,—whom at one interview he had the misfortune to strike with his cane,—but to no purpose ; and presently he was recalled from Tehran. Later the Shah, excited by the news of warlike preparations in Europe, once more lent a favourable ear to Russian overtures for an offensive alliance; but again the Sadr A^zam succeeded in penetrating his intentions and in inducing him to repudiate engagements that he had formed. The Persian Government, it would seem, found it almost impossible to abstain from plunging, on one side or the other, into so great and inter esting a struggle as the Crimean war; and their assistance was next offered to the Allies. These, however, declined it and strongly recom mended Persia to remain neutral, which in the end she decided to do; but not until recourse had been had by the Government of India, as described in the chapter on the history of Turkish ''Iraq, to a mild naval demonstration in the Persian Gulf and on the Shatt-al-^Arab. After the Crimean war Russia embarked on a forward policy in Asia, and her progress eastwards and southwards seemed for a time to be viewed by Persia with a complacent eye. About 1869, however, Russians proceedings on the eastern coasts of the Caspian brought the question of the Eusso-Persian frontier in that quarter Under dispute, and thence forward Persia was again all caution in her dealings with her northern neighbour. As illustrating the attitude of Russia in commercial questions during the latter part of Nasir-ud-Din Shah^s reign, may be quoted someprocee* dings which she took in regard to the construction of railways in Persia. On the 18th September 1887 the Shah was brought by the Russian Minister at Tehran to sign an agreement binding himself not to authorise the construction of any railway or waterway in Persia by a foreign company without previous consultation with the Russian Emperor. The engagement was extorted by a threat that, in event of a concession being granted without reference to Russia, the Tsar might withdraw from his position as a guarantor of the integrity of Persia ; aud it was clearly directed against a British scheme for a railway from Ahwaz to Tehran. As a set-off to the opening of the Lower Karun to ligation in October 1888, which was regarded as a British success, ^6 Uussian Minister at Tehran in March 1889 obtained from the Shah Later rela tions of Persia and Russia. Interdict iinposed by Eussia on the construe tion of rail ways in Persia, 1889- 90.2042 a written agreement conferring on a Russian Company, not specified the option of undertaking any railways in Persia of which the construe' tion might be resolved on during the next five years, during whick period no other company should be granted permission to construct railways. About the same time, as already mentioned, Britain secured priority in regard to railway construction in the South of Persia. In November 1890 there was substituted for this agreement another by Which all railway construction in Persia, with one immaterial exception, Was interdicted for the following ten years, and in which the question was treated as one exclusively between Russia and Persia. As, with the exception of a Belgian line six miles in length, opened in July 1888 and connecting Tehran with Shah 'Abdul 'Azim, no Railway has as yet been Constructed in Persia, the importance of these hiauoeuvres by Russia and of the counteractive measlires taken bj Britain cannot be properly rated ; but the facts show that Russia regard ed with alarm the commercial methods introduced into the struggle for influence by the Reiiter Concession of 1872, and that she feilt a policy of obstruction to be the one most conducive to maintenance of ber prestige. Relations of France and other European powers with. Persia, 1848-' 1896. Muhammad Shah's French officers mostly lett Persia about 1850^ as has been already mentioned; and a later body of French military instructors, who made their appearance in Persia in 1859, remained only until 1861. In 1855 a perpetual Treaty of Friendship and Commerce Was concluded between Persia and France j and thereafter, with tbe exception of certain abortive engineering and mercantile schemes i 11 'Arabistan, feW traces are found of French activity or interest in Persia until 1895, in which year the French Government obtained an exclusive and permanent right, throughout the whole of Persia &gt; of searching &amp; objects of antiquarian interest* Treaties of Commerce, of Friendship and Commerce, or of Comm^ ce and Navigation were concluded at various dates between 1856 and 18^ between Persia and the United States of America, Austria-Hungary, the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden and Norway, Denmark, Greece, ItatyS4J 2043 ♦ Germany, and Switzei'land; but none of these were of poli- lignificance 'nterests on the part of the countries mentioned. ^l^signifieanee or betokened the existence in Persia of important Eelations of Persia and Turkey, 1848—1896. The political relations of Persia and Turkey did not cease, during the of Nasir-ud-Din Shah, to be of importance to both countries; and they were, as usual, those of near and generally unfriendly neighbours. The question of their common frontier, though settled in principle by the second Treaty of Erzeroum (1847), continued to be debated with keat and acrimony for many years^ and no final settlement was attained. Of the proceedings in connection therewith, which are related at length in the chapter on the history of Turkish &gt; Iraq, the earliest were those of an abortive Delimitation Commission, including British and Kussian representatives, that lingered in existence from 1848 to 1852, during which period the Turks qiiite unjustifiably appropriated Qotur, The Treaty of Erzeroum did not ameliorate the lot of Persian subjects in Turkey, maltreatment of whom seems to have reached its height about 1848; and in 1849 the rights of consular extra-territorial jurisdic tion claimed by Persia in Turkey seem to have been set at nought by the Turkish Government. So late as 1851 Turkey was the sole potver, besides Britain and Russia, that maintained a representative at Tehran j and ih 1853 Ahmad Vafiq tllfendi on his arrival as Turkish Ambassadoi: in Persia in succession to Sami Effehdi, became engaged in a conflict with the Persian authorities, characteristic of both nations, concerning his right to display an Ottomab flag at his residence on the analogy of the practice of his British and Russian colleagues. Official encroachments and the misdeeds of border tribes contributed to embitter frontier relations ] and a Perso-Turkish Convention, signed ia 1869, for the maintenance of the status quo, which was itself in capable of definition, proved of no effect. The Shah^s visit to Turkish Iraq (ISyO-Tl) temporarily alleviated the friction between the two States; but it was renewed, immediately on his departure,by the refusal Perso- Turkish frontier qtiestion, 1848—52.

Joint Commissions for the definition of the frontier assembled at Constantinople in 1874-75 and 1875-76, on the second of which Britain and Russia were represented ; but the results attained were exceedingly small.

Meanwhile the difficult questions of the powers of Persian consular officers and the immunities of Persian subjects in Turkey were disposed of by a Convention between Persia and Turkey dated 20th December 1875. Strong feeling on these points had threatened to prevent a personal meeting between the Shah and the Sultan at Constantinople in 1873 ; but a compromise had been arranged in time by the united efforts of the British and Russian Ambassadors in Turkey. In 1877, when, as mentioned in the chapter on the history of Turkish Iiaqj there was a dispute between Persia and Turkey regarding the island of Shalhah in the Shatt-al-^Arab, besides other differences, a war being also in progress between Turkey and Russia., Persia showed a disposition to make common cause with Russia against Turkey. A Persian force of about 1,000 men with 200 horses was even collected at Muhammareh j but in the end the Shah ; s Government decided to remain neutral.

In. 1878 an Agreement was reached between the Persian and Turkisi Grovernments in regard to the conditions under which corpses might be imported from Persia into Turkish 'Iraq for burial at the Holy Cities; it replaced or supplemented an earlier Convention on the subject signed at Baghdad in 1870, evidently on the occasion of the Shah's visit, by Mid-hat Pasha, Wali of Baghdad, and Mirza Husain Khan, Persian Ambassador in Turkey. Frontier troubles, 1880—89, In 1880 Shaikh ''Obaid Ullah, a Kurdish chief and Turkish subject, invaded the Urumlyah districts of Persia at the head of a large force not without encouragement, it was thought, from Turkish officials} and theie was consternation at Tehran. The invasion failed; however of itself ; and in 1881 the leader was deported from his home to Cons tantinople on the representation of various European Governments 1889 trouble occurred on the Perso-Turkish frontier near Khanaqm. In2045 ai j 3li i mJ .$0 Relations of Persia with other States in the Persian Gulf, 1848—1896. In an earlier part of this chapter it appeared that there was in 1820 some difference between the opinions of the Shah of Persia and the Saiyid of ; Oman regarding, the nature of the right by which the latter sover eign then held possession of Bandar ''Abbas and its dependencies^ includ ing Qishm ; and an account, from the''Omani point of view, of subse^ quent transactions between the two States relating to the districts in question will be found in the chapter on the history of the ^Oman Sulta nate. Here it will be enough to mention the features of the case which were most important to the Persian Government. The Perso-^Omani Treaty of 17th November 1856 marked a decided strengthening of the position of Persia with reference to Bandar 'Abbas, for it demolished the basis of any claim to independent sovereignty which the Saiyid of 'Oman may have been inclined to cherish. The Treaty did not clearly define the dependencies of Bandar 3 Abbas, but it specified the districts of Shamil and Minab and the islands Qishm and Hormuz as connected therewith, and laid down that the whole of these must be considered as forming an integral part of the Persian province of Ears. Numerous conditions were added to that of payment of revenue, making it clear that the status and powers of the ruler of 'Oman at Bandar 'Abbas were henceforth not to differ from those of any other fief-holder under the Persian Crown ; such conditions were liability of the Governor of Bandar 'Abbas appointed by the ruler of 'Oman to removal on a bare complaint from the Governor-General of Pars ; the non-erection of new fortifications at Bandar 'Abbas town ; rendering of high honours to the Governor-G eneral of Fars, should he visit Bandar Abbas; the flying of the Persian flag on all occassions; the furnishing of necessary assistance to Persian military expeditions j and the surrender of ^gitives from Persian jurisdiction to the Persian authorities. It is noteworthy that in one of the ultimata presented by Britain ^Persia in 1856, before the Anglo-Persian war, the grant of a lease ^ Bandar J Abbas to the Saiyid of 'Oman figured among the British demands; hut the matter found no place in the Treaty of Peace in 1857, ^ing then known to have been settled by direct negotiation between 0l % and Persia. Connection of the rulers of 'Oman with Bandar 'Abbas, Qishm, etc., 1848—68. 1856.2046 1868. The terms of the Agreement of 1868, whereby, on British advice, the Persian Grovernment granted a fresh lease of Bandar 'Abbas and its dependencies to the Sultan of 'Oman, were even more stringent than those of the Treaty of 1856 in their assertion of Persian sovereignty over the districts and islands concerned. The items specifically included in the new lease were Bandar'Abbas, meaning the town of that name; the district of Shamil, in which Taziyan and 'Ism, separately mentioned in the Agreement, are at the present day comprised; the districts of Minab and Biyaban; the islands of Qishm and Hormuz; and the part of Khamir, which is now in the district of Bastak. The Sultan's Governor of Bandar 'Abbas was required to acknowledge in writing his subjection to the Persian Government; the moat surround' ing the Bandar 'Abbas fort was to be permanently filled up; the Persian flag was to be flown at Bandar 'Abbas, where several persons in charge of it, as also a passport writer on the part of the Persian Government, were to be allowed to reside; a salute was to be fired on the Shah's birthday; individuals who had served the Shah at Bandar 'Abbas were to be well treated instead of being molested; the Sultan's Governor was not to interfere with places unmentioned in the lease, even such as might formerly have been under Masqat; the Governor was to receive the Governor-General of Fars and the Governor of Laristan with every mark of honour and respect in case of their visiting Bandar 'Abbas for recreation and sport; he was to furnish with guides and provisions such forces as the Governors-General of Fars and Kirman might send in the direction of Makran and Baluchistan; he was to be changed at once if any act of his should be disapproved by the Governor-General of Fars; refugees from Fars and Laristan were to be handed over to the Persian Government; the officers* of foreign Governments were to be excluded from the leased districts; and the Sultan of 'Oman was to arrange for the defence of the ports, was to prevent ' all inteference and intrusion of strangers, whether under friendly pretext or otherwise,' and was not to allow any foreign vessel to make use of the anchorages; the Sultan was not to sublet the districts to any other Government; and duties on goods at Bandar 'Abbas were to be levied according to a former scale, and not at Masqat rates. *The Government of India Ihought it unnecessary to protest against any partof Article, which treaty rights in Persia would render innocuous in so far as the ' Government and British subjects were concerned.itts*] 2047 In less than two months after its execution the lease of Bandar ^Abbas to 'Oman was determined by a change of Sultans at Masqat, and no other was ever granted. This was the end of the long-standing h c01in ectioii between Masqat and Bandar 'Abbas. Proceedings by which the Persian Government from time to time Persian pro- intimated that they harboured a claim to the Bahrain Islands are ^g^^ 0 in described in full in the chapter on the history of Bahrain. Bahrain, In 1859? when Bahrain was threatened by the Wahhabis, the Shaikh, 1359 ignoring his close relations with the British Government, appealed to the Shah of Persia and the Sultan of Turkey for protection; and one result of his appeal was the arrival in Bahrain of a Persian Agent, who hoisted the Persian flag and proclaimed Persian sovereignty, but with brief success. In 1869 Persia entered a protest against strong action which had 1869 - recently been taken by the British Government in Bahrain, chiefly on the ground that previous notice had not been given to Persia ; and in reply a pledge was volunteered by Her Majesty's Government without admit ting the Persian pretensions to sovereignty implied, that in future the Persian Government should be fully informed of any punitive measures to which the British Government might find it necessary to resort in Bahrain. Renewed disturbances obliged the British authorities again to intervene forcibly in Bahrain before the end of the year, and the Shah's Government were duly apprised and made no objection to the opera tions ; but they protested against interference with a Persian emissary to Bahrain which had been exercised in the course of the same. In 1886 the Shah, in conversation with the British Minister at 1886. Tehran, claimed the sovereignty of Bahrain and quoted the assurance given by the British Government in 1869 as an admission thereof; but he did not press the matter, and the counter statement of their views drawn up by Her Majesty's Government remained undelivered. Later, evidence came into the possession of the British authorities 1887. which showed that in 1887 a scheme had been approved by the head of the Persian Ministry for the seizure of Bahrain by the Shaikh of Qatar, apparently in the Persian interest; but this design did not reach the point of practical action. In 1887-88 overtures for the establishment of Persian suzerainty over Persian Tmcial 'Oman were made by a Persian agent, ^Sartip Haji Ahmad — 1— 'Oman, 1887- * This man was a needy adventurer who hopedito benefit himself by pushing the 88. supposed scheme o£ Persian statesmen in the Gulf. His action at Lingeh is noticed further on in this chapter.2048 Khan, to the Shaikhs of Abu Dhabi, Dibai, and Umm-al -Qaiwain. These were, to all appearance, connected with the Bahrain plan of 1887 and were equally resultless; and the Persian Government repudiated their emissary's proceedings, a full account of which will be found in the chapter on the history of Trucial 'Oman. Outrages on the Persian coast against boats from the Arabian side, and reprisals, 1892-93. After 1888 no political relations or correspondence between the Persian Government and the independent Arab principalities of the Persian Gulf can be traced ; but in 1892-93 a sort of petty war seems to have been in progress between the inhabitants of Persian coast villages and those of ports on the Arabian littoral opposite. In June 1892 a Bahrain boat was looted by armed men at Tibin in Shibkuh, and cash and goods to the amount of Rs. 880 were said to have been carried off. In August following, a determined attack was made upon the village of Kashkunar in the Gabandi valley by A1 Bu Fakhru (Huwalah) natives of the place who had emigrated to Qatar some time previously, seven Kashkunaris being killed and property valued at Rs. 70,000 Qrans plundered. Kashkunar, it will be remembered, is closely connected with Pibiu, as Qatar is with Bahrain. The Kashkunar people afterwards retaliated by seizing three boats from Qatar, whereupon the Shaikh of Qatar complained to the British Resident in the Persian Gulf, but was told that, unless he restrained his subjects from committing offences, he must expect them to suffer from reprisals. Also in 1892, however, a boat from Jazeh on the Persian coast was attacked near Wakrah in Qatar and several of the crew were killed. Boats belonging to Bahrain were again plundered or seized by inhabitants of Basatin in April 1893, and by Bustanu people in the following September, the villages of the robbers being apparently the places so named in the Gabandi Valley. It does not appear that redress was afforded or sought by the Persian Government in any of the above cases, which they were content simply to ignore. A general spirit of lawlessness was perhaps abroad on the Persian coast at this time, for at the end of 1892 or beginning of 1893 a Ras -al- Khaimah boat was attacked at Khargu Island and a slave taken from ^ by the robbers, while another Ras-al-Khaimah vessel was dealt with in a manner little, if at all, short of criminal by the Persian Deputy- Governor of Bandar 'Abbas,2049 139 ln Piano! ^ tep| ^efoi General, administrative, and internal history of the Persian Coast and Islands, 1848-1872, and their general history, 1872- 1896. We have seen that Shaikh Nasir III^ the head of the old ruling family of Busliehr, was reappointed to the government of that town and se H ^ its dependencies in 1845 after many vicissitudes of fortune. After In T Tl1 ■ his reinstatement difficulties, due chiefly to hostile action by Baqir Khan, the chief of Tangistan, came upon him thick and fast. On the main- Id the Tangistanis attacked and captured Tul Siyah, raided the district ten carri« 0 { Rud-hilleh, sweeping off the livestock and all the other property of %;the inhabitants, and treacherously put to death the Shaikh of Ahmadi, near whose village, afterwards destroyed by them, they sustained a •revioiisly,^ severe check and lost some 50 of their best men. This state of matters, s. 70,0(11 ijhy interfering with the trade of Bushehr and making the revenue of the rc0Illiec j^Shaikh's outlying districts irrecoverable, caused him great financial ^foarrassnaent, especially as he was obliged to maintain a large garrison i the l e (lefence tlie town &gt; an d there were at Shiraz, in the neighbour hood of His Eoyal Highness Bahram Mirza, Governor-General of Ears, were ready to take advantage of the Shaikh's difficulties, if had not even created them by inciting Baqir Khan to attack him.

The Qawwam, it may be observed, was a son of Haji im, that minister by whose desertion of the Zand cause the estab- of the Qajar dynasty in Persia was greatly facilitated. There was consequently no reason for astonishment when, on the 2nd Pctober 1849, an emissary of the Government of Fars charged with the pnoval of Shaikh Nasir arrived at Bushehr. This was Muhammad pshim Khan. ing on the ^ fl89^ Pair a nephew of the Haji Qawwam ; and his first step was to ^ an interview at the British Residency with Major Hennell, the n t.

Muhammad Hashim Khan delivered to the Resident a letter^ to the same effect, from the Governor-General; and he seemed to hope that the Resident would offer to prevent the escape of Shaikh Nasir by sea ; but in this, needless to szy, he was disappointed. The Persian emissary then visited Shaikh Nasir, to present his credentials; and the Shaikh the same day called on Major Hennell, accompanied only by Shaikh Muhammad, the Shaikh of the Dumukh Arabs of Chah Kutali, to ask his advice. The Dumukh Shaikh, who had heard that Baqir Khan of Tangistan was to be associated at Bushehr with Mirza Mehdi Khan as his principal adviser, recommended resistance, and in the last resort flight; while Shaikh Nasir said that he would in the first instance appeal to the clemency of the Prince-Governor, and thereafter if unsuccessful, fly or resist as circumstances might dictate. Major Hennell recommended Shaikh Nasir to eschew extreme measures, and rather to comply with the order summoning him to Shiraz,—a piece of advice which the Shaikh seemed loath to accept from dread of the power of his rival the Nizam-ul-Mulk at head-quarters, and one which the Government of Bombay afterwards characterised as somewhat impru dent, regard being had to the results which might have followed on its being accepted. In the end Shaikh Nasir solved the problem by putting Muhammad Hashim and his attendants into a boat on the night of the 4th October and sending them over to Shif on the mainland, where they were set ashore with an exhortation to make the best of their way to Shiraz. This expedient was unavailing, however, except as a means of gaining time; and in the end Shaikh Nasir was persuaded to visit Shiraz, | whence he was, sent a prisoner to Tehran. The Governor -General of Pars* His Royal Highness Piruz Mirza, then appointed a son of tie Haji Qawwam of Shiraz to the Governorship of Bushehr; bit m October 1850 Shaikh Husain, an uncle of Shaikh Nasir, who W already once usurped possession of Bushehr in 1839, took upon himself the administration of the place and was able for a short time to retain it. j Shaikh Husain, who did not cease to profess loyalty to Tehran wlnl' ^ defied the mandates of Shiraz, and who at the same time culti^ j a good understanding with the British Resident, is described by a | Jjiiut tie * Prinoe Firuz Mirza, wbo succeeded Prince Bahrain Mirza at Shiraz » beginning of 1850, was an uncle of the Shah, and his age at this time was » bout _ He was a strong and energetic ruler, especially in his treatment of crime, ani g enel ' respected in spite of his grasping avarice.

Mill ' Governor, asmes, mm ... , ( ■ The reason publicly assigned by the Persian authorities for the dis- -a piece »i r J Iread of tie J and one i thavefoiyi placement of Shaikh Nasir was a large deficiency in his contributions to the Treasury during the previous two years; and the fact was un- deniable, though it was largely due to circumstances not under the Shaikh's control. According to the British representative at Bushehr Shaikh Nasir's removal was not attributable, at least so far as the Shiraz authorities were concerned, to his friendly connection with the ritish Residency; but Major Hennell thought that the Amir Nizam, [ of the |lien Prime Minister, had come to the conclusion that it would be for i, wheretkfme advantage of Persia if the government of Bushehr were placed in [r way to 81 the hands of officials having no traditional intimacy with the British, as a means oW more under the influence of the Persian Government than the M to risi^aikhs of Bushehr were ever likely to become. GoTemow The Shiraz authorities succeeded before long in installing their Government ppointeiaswrninee^ a son of the Haji Qawwam, at Bushehr under the style of by ^Persian of Bishe^lfarya Baigi or Lord High Admiral,—a title which, however, inappro- aikh f ia t e to an official who controls no naval force, has since then more shaikh iipwnan firza a' t this ti^ once been borne by the representative of the Shah^s Government at ^5^52 r.

Interest shown by the Shah and Central Government of Persia in the Persian Coast and Islands, 1874-91. grievously over the inhabitants. The Darya Baigi on his part sent emissaries to Kharag who, after swearing fidelity to Shaikh Husain on the Quran ; entered his service and then attempted to seize him; but the Shaikh, leaving behind him his cannon and military stores, which fell into the hands of the Persians, made good his escape to the banks of the Shatt-al-Arab. In January 1852 the Darya Baigi received a robe of honour as a reward for his success at Kharag, salutes were fired, and the people of Bushehr were ordered to decorate their houses in honour of the auspicious occasion. The immediate results of the establishment of a regular administra tion at Bushehr were excellent. The Tangistanis ceased to give trouble; the inhabitants of Bushehr returned to their homes; and trade began to flourish. The Shaikhs of Bushehr never regained their position as Governors, and history does not even relate what became of Shaikhs Nasir and Husain. There was an epidemic of cholera at Bushehr in the autumn of 1851, which at first threatened to be severe. When the disease broke out in August the number of deaths daily was about 30 ; but it disappeared in October after causing a total mortality of about 500 only. A famine which caused great distress and a heavy mortality, especi ally in the southern provinces, prevailed in Persia from the middle of 1870 to the middle of 1872. The inhabitants of Fars were scattered in all directions, and there was a ghastly influx into Bushehr of foot-sore and emaciated multitudes, some of whom fell dead on arrival at the town, while others dropped by the way along the road from Shiraz. A' outbreak of cholera at Bushehr in February 1871 contributed to aggra vate the situation. Measures which were taken through the Britisk authorities at Bushehr to prevent grain from leaving the country and to organise a system of famine relief fall under the head of British relations and are discussed further on. Before passing to the internal and administrative history of tie districts of the Persian Coast and Islands after 1872, we may notice symptoms of interest in that part of their dominions which were mani fested from time to time by the Shah and the Central Government In 1874, under orders from Tehran, a 'box of justice' was set up at Bushehr in which persons of all classes having grievances ww 6 allowed to place petitions for direct transmission to the Shah, and an octroi duty on fruit and vegetables, till then levied at Bushehr, abolished. m A weekly Persian post between Bushehr and Tehran was — 1877, as related in the special Appendix on Mail Communications2053 o ni s putting an end in 1878 to the carriage of general correspondence on that line under arrangements made b j the British authorities; and in 1879 the new indigenous service was reported to be working admirably. In i ^ e | a tter year a census was ordered to be taken in the province of Fars, including most of the districts of the Persian Coast; but it is not recei ^ a | known to what extent the operation was successful. In 1885 arrangements were made for a visit by the Shah to Fars ; were fired .. 11 but scarcity, and consequent difficulty regarding supplies for the royal camp, caused the project to be abandoned for the time being. sjto ^ His Majesty's manifesto of 1888 concerning the rights and liberties and trait of Persian subjects was published in the districts of the Persian Gulf as 1 their j id other parts of the Empire and elicited from the British Eesident at Bushehr the remark : cc The effects of this measure are not yet palpable, but ; owing chiefly to increased intercourse with Europeans and inter change of ideas with them, there is a gradual amelioration of the condi- ] Ion of the people in progress, and the Royal Proclamation is a sign of the times at all events, and may yet bear fruit.' only. At the end of 1891 the Shah again contemplated a tour in Ears. ^vy mortal,J ^is was a measure entirely in accord both with His Majesty^s humane from tk ill solicitude for the welfare of his subjects and with his fondness for travel; arswereriJ but once more a failure of crops necessitated its postponement, and it BusMirofi was never accomplished. id on mk ^ matter deserving separate notice is the manifestation by Nasir-ud- Naval policy d fromSlii ^ though somewhat intermittently, of an ambition to possess a j)m Shahm ££1P force in tlie Persian Gulf - _ adf! eman 1 the coDatrji' About the year 1865 the Shah proposed to acquire three or four d of British armed steamers, which, commanded by British naval officers and manned by Arabs or Indians, should discharge maritime police duties in tive HstorjI Persian waters at least; but the scheme^ which was believed to cover $72, weH designs on Bahrain, was discountenanced by the British Government ns wlucW and came to nothing. ] Govern^ g 0lne ^f^ een y ears l a ter it seems to have been suggested to the Shah justice'™] ^atj if the Persian coast were watched and its ports brought under B g grie^l ^ntrol, the result would be a great increase in the productiveness of* the t o the* customs; and with this idea it was decided, in 1883, that the Persian ed at ^eminent should acquire one vessel per annum and so gradually build I fp a flotilla of preventive vessels, which would be available for other pur- iran^ s n ^ oses a ^ 0 ' Tenders were invited in Britain and Germany, and in the end ^ Cod^ acoi ^ rac ^ was given to a German firm at Bremerhaven for the construe- 4 1865—88.2054 tion of two vessels. The larger of these, the Persepolis,' was finished in January 1885 and arrived at Bushehr in May in charge of German officers and a German crew: the smaller, the a Susa,' was sent out ia parts about the same time and put together at Muhammareh. The Shah's desire to visit Fars in 1885 may have been connected with these rudiments of a navy. Both vessels were screw steamers ; but ; while the 'Persepolis' was a sea-going craft of about 600 tons and 450 horse power, carrying four Krupp guns and designed for general service in the Gulf, the ' Susa/ ; though she also originally carried guns, was only a river boat of 36 tons and 30 horse power, resembling a harbour launch. The cost of the two was £32,000, but neither steamer yielded satisfactory results; this may have been due to the conditions under which they had to be maintained, by a staff mostly native and far from all docking facilities. The farmers of the Persian Gulf customs had not, it would seem, a belief equal to that of the Persian Government in the efficacy of the ,f Persepolis ' as an aid to the collection of customs dutjj for they demurred to paying the cost of her maitenance, which was considerable; and in ; Arabistan the Shaikh of Muhammareh at first raised objections to the employment of the &lt;l Susa ' on the Karnu. Consequently, for a time, the ' Persepolis ' lay idle at Bushehr and the ' Susa^ at Failiveh; and, when at length the a Persepolis J&gt; was taken into use, for political purposes in the Gulf and the ff Susa^ placed on the Karun above Ahwaz as a despatch boat under the orders of the Governor of 'Arabistanj all dreams of an expanding Persian marine seemed to have been discarded. Some account of the general administration of Fars during the period may also, as that province at first included almost all the districts of the Persian Coast, usefully be prefixed to our examination of local history. The number of coastal districts and villages subject to the Govern 01 ' General of Fars was greater at the beginning of the period than it is at the present day^ when an independent administration described as tW of ' the Gulf Ports/' with headquarters at Bushehr, exists. DiIanM^ 8 true, belonged not to Fars, but to Behbehan, as the Liravi district surrounding it still does ; but Bushehr itself, with the connected districts of Hayat Davud, Rud-hilleh, Angali, Dashtistan, Tangistan, an ^ Dashti, were then under the Government of Fars; and the whole remainder of the Persian Coast down to Biyaban, including the entire districts of Shibkuh, Lingeh, Bastak, Bandar 'Abbas, Shamil, MiA Biyaban and Jashk formed a part of Fars. Dashti and Tangistan after* waids passed from dependence on Bushehr to direct dependence on Shu^ and Dashtistan was divided between Bushehr and Shiraz; but the2055 P 0 V H | gughehr at the expense of Tars, since its detachment from the latter comprise 'Asalu and Naband in Shibkuh with their dependen- cies and the whole districts of Lingeh, Bandar 'Abbas, Shamil, Minab, ''Si gj j b5D a nd Jashk, witli their islands. ' ^ ev lapse, in 1868, of the lease of Bandar 'Abbas given to the ^4 g u ltan of 'Oman, nothing resembling an independent Arab state existed m u pon the Persian littoral ; but Lingeh remained for a time in the hands eneia ^! 0 f aa Arab Shaikh who farmed the revenues from the Persian Govern- ment without admitting their interference in local affairs ; and at other places also there were Shaikhs of minor importance who enjoyed a sort of autonomy. i n 1873 the Governor-Generalship of Ears was conferred on the Gov^ermnent Hisam -us-Saltaneh, an uncle of the Shah, who had previously played a ^s-Saltanehr conspicuous part in Khurasan and Herat affairs. He retained it until 1873-75. ent io tk|11875, in which year he gave a hospitable reception at Shiraz to the stomsiut^i British Resident in the Persian Gulf and the officers of his staff. hwajpj The Hisam-us-Saltaneh was succeeded by Yahya Khan, known then 0 £ ^ irst raisedoljfii as the Mo'tamad-ul-Mulk and later as the Mushir-ud-Dauleh, who had Mo teniad-ul- ^ODSfiptlj,! married the Shah's sister, the widow of the Amir Nizam, and who rose ^ v ' / f Siisa ,; ailil later to be Minister for Foreign Affairs,—a post which he forfeited on to use, fwthe escape of Ayub Khan from Tehran. Kanmakilj In August 1876, the Mo'tamad-ul-Mulk was superseded by His ^£ 0 ^ nmen ^ or of MlJ Royal Highness * Farhad Mirza^ known as the Mo tamad-ud-Dauleh, Mo'tamad- pebeeiiffli an uncle of the Shah, whose first act was to overthrow the power of the ' Mushir-ud-Dauleh, the permanent Vazir of the province, till then all- irs uring si ^ 0wer £ u ^ p r i nce ^ was an elderly man, assisted by nis son the ttefchtsij established and preserved unexampled security and nofUl 1 j goojthroughout Southern Persia; but his methods, which com- ftttotkN prised the crucifixion of criminals—real or supposed—and their bimal in period tto it'I mortar pits, can only be described as ruthless. In its financial aspects on desciiW a dministration was so oppressive as commonly to be summed up by 3xists. fc subjects in the phrase Tars tamam shud' (Fars is done for). He lna ^ a i li ed very friendly relations with the British representatives in his 3connected P rovince ) in April 1880, the Resident at Bushehr, with his staff, n fangistsij him a visit at Shiraz. 5 ! ^ the spring of 1881, the Mo'tamad -ud-Dauleh was removed from Government lch kM ^ raz to make way for Sultan Mas'ud Mirza, the Zill-us-Sultan, a son of ug-g^itan, )as ; who was then about 32 years of age and already held charge 1881 87. ndTan^f — : — ;—7- 7 nanden^ months in Persia, Vol. I, page 48), calls him 'Firuz Mirza, but this2056 of the districts of Ispahan, the Bakhtiyari country, Yazd, Burujird ; Luris- tan and ■'Arabistan. Until the arrival at Shiraz in June 1881 of the Jalal-ud-Dauleh, a young son whom the Zill-us Sultan deputed to repre sent him in Fars, he himself remaining at Ispahan, the administration was carried on provisionally by the Qavvam-ul-Mulk, the most influ ential noble of Shiraz; and the Jalal-ud-Dauleh was accompanied to his post by the Sahib Divan, a brother of the Qavvam -ul-Mulk ; in the capacity of mentor. In revenue matters the Government of the Zilks- Sultan was more considerate, at least at the outset, than that of the Mo^tamad-ud-Dauleh; but he did not shrink from acts of extreme severity, and for a time the tranquillity of the province was maintained with great success. The Zill-us-Sultan had pretensions to European culture, and he devoted some attention to the military training, on Austrian lines, of the troops under his orders; but the sincerity of the pro- British sentiments which he frequently expressed was open to doubt. In 1882 began the removal, piece-meal, of ports and districts in the Persian Gulf from the jurisdiction of the Governor-General of Fars. 1 he first to go were Lingeh and Bandar ^Abbas; they were transferred to the management of the Amin-us-Sultan, a favourite officer of the Shah and afterwards head of the Persian Ministry, who about this time became sole manager or rather farmer of the customs throughout Persia, and udder whose orders the customs house at Bushehr also, though not as yet the administration of that town, was placed. At the end of 1883 died the Mushir-ul-Mulk, ex-Vazir of Fars, whose power the Mo 'tamad-ud- Dauleh had broken; he was a man of immense wealth and the originator of many useful public works. His death was followed within a few days by that of the Qavvam-ul-Mulk, his rival and bitter enemy, whose title was continued to his son Muhammad Riza Khan. In 1884 there were dissensions between the Sahib Divan, the actual ruler of Fars, and his nephew the new Qavvam-ul-Mulk; and the administration of the province began to deteriorate and to provoke unfavourable comparisons with what it had been in the days of the Mo'tamad-ud-Dauleh. ^ 1886 the Jlal-ud-Dauleh had reached years of discretion; but he remained a cypher in the Government, and real power continued to be wielded by the Sahib Divan alone, who obtained the removal of the Qavvam-ul-Mulk to Isfahan as a prisoner. In February 1887 Fars was taken from the Zill -us -Sultan and con ferred on the Amin-us-Sultan; and the result was a general upturn of political conditions. The Qavvam-ul-Mulk, who had meanwhile been2057 % el frotn custody on paying 60,000 Tumans, was taken into favour; the seaboard to was, including Bushehr, Liugeh and Bandar 'Abbas, with their dependent districts and the islands of the Persian Coasfc were formed into a Gulf Ports charge independent of Fars; and H. E. H. the Ihtisham -ud-Dauleh, son of the Mo'tamad-ud-Danleh, was set over the districts that remained subject to Shiraz, or most of them. The Ihtisham-ud-Dauleh, who in 1888 had received his fathers title of Mo 'timid-ud-Dauleh, was relieved in February 1892 by H. R. H Muhammad Taqi Mirza, the Rukn-ud-Dauleh, a brother of the Shah This Prince initiated a firm administration and came in collision with the Qavvam-ul-Mulk, who had temporarily to retire from the scene, but ere many months had passed the Rukn-ud-Dauleh had to retire in favour of the Nizam-us-Saltaneh, an official of undistinguished origin but a successful Governor of ^Arabistan, who held charge for more than a year. In 1894 the Rukn-ud-Dauleh was reappointed to Fars, where he remained in power till after the assassination of Nasir-ud-Din Shah. Government of the Ihtis- ud- Dauleh. 1887-92.

The most important jurisdiction on the Persian Coast was that of Bushehr, the history of which can now, in the light of the foregoing account of the affairs of Fars, be made intelligible. For a short time in 1873 Bushehr town, with the country district dependent on it, was separated from the province of Fars under His Royal Highness Asad Ullah Mirza, the Naib-ut-Tiyaleh; but it returned to its former position on the arrival of the Hisam-us-Saltaneh at Shiraz, Prince Asad Ullah continuing to govern it until the removal of that (jovernor-General in 1875, when he resigned. The relations of the Prince Governor of Bushehr with the British Residency were uniformly courteous and friendly ; but the state of the dis tricts and roads, which were infested by bands of robbers, left much to be desired. In 1873-74 the Bushehr customs were farmed to an Isfa- hani for 32,000 Tumans, or about Es. 1,28,000, and the assessment of the dependent districts was approximately Rs, 1,50,000.

On the Princess resignation Bushehr was entrusted to Sartip ^Abdul Husam Khan; but his administration was unsuccessful and of short duration. The Sartip's place was presently taken by one Husain Quli Khan, who at once proceeded to collect the outstanding revenue with the help of a force of infantry and artillery; but in the summer of 1876, he having left for Shlraz, the Government devolved on unworthy or incom petent substitutes; and during the months of June and July crime was nfem the town and environs of Bushehr,—a state of matters'largely due to the presence of a considerable body of Persian troops whose pay was m arrears. Some of the Persian soldiers, on measures being taken against them, sought refuge under the flag staff of the Turkish Consulate. On the supersession of the Mo'tamad-ul-Mulk by the Mo'tamad-ud- Dauleh His Royal Highness ^Awais Mirza, the Ihtisham-ud-DauIeli, was appointed Governor of Bushehr by his father. The Piince was much oc.upied by the affairs of other tracts, includ ing Behbehan, for which he was responsible ; and this prevented his devoting much personal attention to Biishehf; but it was his practice, during his father s and his own very effective administration of Ears, to make an annual tour of inspection through the southern districts of the province. Early in 1877^ accompanied by a formidable body of non local troops, he spent about two months at Bushehr, which he again visited in February 1878. He generally maintained a Deputy Governor in the town, at first Haji Ismail Khan and afterwards igta Muhammad Baqir Khan, the latter of whom vacated office along with his patron on the appointment of the Zill-us-Sultan to Pars in 1881. In 1877 there died at Bushehr Agha Muhammad ; Ali, the Malik-ut- Tujjar or officially recognised head merchant of the place. He was reputed the richest private individual in Persia; and his estate, as lie had no children, passed to his elder brother, Haji Baba, a naturalised British Indian subject residing at Bushehr. The customs of Bushehr were not invariably leased to the Governor of Bushehr, and in 1878-79 they had been granted to the Nasir-ul-Mulk of Shiraz, a brother of the elder Qavvam-ul-Mulk and the Sahib Divan, notwithstanding that a royal prince was then Governor of the town and its districts.being I tte Toil ( r; £2) 2059 ►PU arrangements at Bushehr in 1881—82, while fche Zili-us-Sultan Various liieaudug , n, - xi i.

In 1882 the Government of Bushehr was granted to the Nasir-ul- Mulk who had farmed the customs of the port three years earlier; but he left for his home at Shiraz in February 1883, making over charge to the local Karguzar, and a little later the Amin-us-Sultan at Tehran, as already mentioned, obtained control of the Bushe.hr customs along with those of other places in the Persian Gulf. Haji Baba, the heir of Agha Muhammad 'Ali, Malik-ut-Tujjar, died in May 1883; and his property was inherited by his grandson, Haji Muhammad Mehdi, who was appointed Malik-ut-Tujjar. In June 1883 Mirza Muhammad Husain Khan, a son of the Sahib Divan, arrived at Bushehr, having been appointed to succeed the Nasir-ul Mulk; but he remained only until January 1884, when, being summoned- to Shiraz, he nominated his son-in-law Haji Fazl ? Ali Khan as his locum tmu, Muhammad Husain Khan retained the government of Bushehr in 1884j''-85, receiving from the Shah the title of Motaman-ud-Dauleh, and being appointed by the powerful Amin-us-Sultan his Agent for the collection of the customs of Bushehr, as well as Governor on his behalf of Lingeh and Bandar ''Abbas. The Motaman-ud-Dauleh resigned the government of Bushehr m June 1885 and was followed in it by Shahzadeh Nauzar Mirza, a ^ grandson of Hasan ; Ali Khan, Farman-Farma of Fars, and a great grandson consequently of Fat-h ^Ali Shah ; but the Shahzadeh was soon displaced by one Safar ^Ali Khan. At the beginning of 1886 Bushehr was governed by Haji Muham mad Mehdi, Malik-ut-Tujjar; but in May he made way for Haji lat-h ; Ali Khan; and later the Nasir-ul-Mulk again assumed control of Bushehr and its dependencies. In 1887, on the fall of the Zill-us-Sultan, who was at this time Government deprived of all his governments except Isfahan, the whole of lars was u i.]y[ u ik &gt; made over to the Amin-us-Sultan and parcelled out by him to various 1887-91- deputies. The Ihtisham-us-Sultan received, as already mentioned, Shiraz and the central districts; Bushehr and other coast towns and islands ^ere conferred, as a separate Gulf Ports government, on Muhammad Hasan Khan, a brother of the Nizam-us-Saltaneh, with the title of2060 Grovernments of the Nizam us-Saltaneh. and Sa'ad- ul-Muik, 1892-94 Government of the QavvSm-ul- Mulk, 1894-96.

At the beginning of the year the Nasir-ul-Mulk had been in charge of Bushehr ; but from about April to July he had been absent at Shiraz ; during which time Haidar Quli Khan^ and later Sartip Haji Ahmad Khan, had officiated for him; and on his return, though he brought with him 200 infantry and 400 mounted men, he had found it necessary to resign m consequence of the intrigues of his brother the Sahib Divan against him at Shiraz, and had been succeeded by Shahzadeh Nauzar Mirza. It was by this prince that Bushehr was eventually handed over to the Amin-us-Sultan's representative, the Sa'ad-ul-Mulk. In 1891 or 1892 the Sa^ad-ul-Mulk was replaced by his brother the Nizam-us-Saltaneh, but in the latter part of 1892 the Nizam-us-Saltaneh was called to the Governorship of Fars and transferred Bushehr to his nephew, Biza Quli Khan. After a short interval the Sa'ad-ul-Mulk lesumed the government of Bushehr, but he continued to reside chiefly at Shiraz. In March 1894, at the beginning of the Persian official year, the government of the Gulf Ports passed to the Qavvam-ul-Mulk of Shirazj but he did not arrive at Bushehr, the headquarters of his administration; till the following July. He was re-appointed in 1895; but intrigues which had been organised against him by a coalition of merchants resulted in his resignation in March 1896, before he had quite completed his second year of office. It haying been suggested to him from Tehran that the Malik-ut- Tu J^ r ^i^ht with advantage be temporarily removed from Bushehr, he imprudently attempted to remove that personage in a forcible and ignominious manner. The result was that the Malik took sanctuary at the Imamzadeh near Sabzabad, while noisy demonstrations in his favour were got up in the town, the shops being shut and business brought to a standstill, and the telegraph office besieged by excited crowds of memorialists,—circumstances which the Qavvam-ul-Mulk's adversaries did not xail to torn to account. On the resignation of the Qavvam-ul-Mulk the Hisam -us -Saltaneh was appointed Governor of the Gulf Ports, but he did not reach Bushehr until June 1896, after the death of the Shah. Dilam, as we have seen, was included in the province of Behheban at the commencement of the period now under consideration; and the at which it was brought under the Government of Fars, or mots probably—as a Gulf Port-under Bushehr cannot be exactly tod.2061 j 1873 it being then still subject to the Government of Behhehan, • 'es were committed by an ex-ruler of the town upon Persian boats^ the master of one of which was murdered. The services of a British vessel were offered to the Persian authorities, but were not accepted; au d the pirate seems to have escaped the penalty of his misdeeds. In 1879-80 there were disturbances at Dilam due to the supersession of Khan Mi, the Zabit or tribal ruler recognised by the Persian Government, in favour of Abdullah Khan ; a new nominee. In December 1892 Ja 'far Khan, then Zabit of Dilam, was declared by the Persian authorities to be evading payment of revenue, and a detachment of 30 soldiers was sent to arrest him; but the people of the place rose in arms in defence of their chief, and the detachment was defeated. Later, however, Ja ; far Khan was removed and the Zabit of Bishehr installed in his place. In 1878-79 there was trouble at Rig, consequent on the replacement History of of one Zabit by another. In 1892-93 hostilities took place between j^d, Eud- Khan Mi Khan, ruler of Rig, and Muhammad Khan, ruler of Angali, hilleh^a-nd who then held the Rud-hilleh district also in farm. Both Khans were 1872-96. discontented with the Persian Government, who played them off against each other; but the death of the Angali chief, who was killed in a blood- feud, produced a temporary lull. In 1893, however. Khan 'Ali Khan, having made his peace with the Persian Government, took the villages of the Angali in farm; but the resistance of the inhabitants to his rule was not overcome until a gun had been sent to his assistance by the Persian authorities at Bushehr. Dashtistan was not distinguished bv greater tranquillity from the History of ^ n/r i itt xri. - Dasntistan, other districts adjacent to Bushehr. In 1878 Muhammad Hasan Knan 1872-96. of Burazjan was a prisoner at Shiraz, where one of his sons had been put to death. In April 1886 there were serious disturbances at Burazjan. In 1889, when Prince Nauzar Mirza relinquished the government of Dashtistan, to which he had been appointed in 1887, he was succeeded by Sartip Muhammad Hasan Khan; the district was at the time distracted, except the town of Burazjan and its dependencies, by feuds between local chiefs. In 1895 an attempt was made by the Persian authorities to pacify the district by placing a particular chief in universal control; but the change was resisted by a competitor, Ahmad Khan, who shot his favoured rival dead. Under orders from Tehran a punitive force with one small naval gun was then sent against Ahmad Khan; but tbe rebel was joined by contingents from the neighbouring districts of Shabankareh and Tangistan; and reinforcements had to be sent from Bushehr to the Persian force. The final result was the recognition of2062 History of Tangistan, 1872-96. History of Dashti, 1872-96. History of Shibkuh, 1872-96, Ahmad Khan himself, after he had made submission at Bushehr, as the sole chief of Dashtistan, In 1879 Tangistan came under the rule of a single authority, Haidar Khan, on the expulsion of his first cousin ^li Khan, who had disputed the government with him. A rebellion against Haidar Khan's authority seems to have occurred in 1893; and the insurgents, who were armed with Martini rifles, succeeded in repelling an attack made on them by the Khan in conjunction with Persian troops and a gun from Bushehr. On the occasion of the Ihtisham-ud-Dauleh's first visit to Bushehr in 1877 the chief of Dashti, Haidar Khan, who had not paid his respects to the Persian authorities for a number of years, thought it advisable to wait on the Prince there; and the latter, when he left Bushehr, made a tour in Dashti and remained in the district for some time. In the following year Haidar Khan preferred to make a journey to Shiraz, whence he had received assurances of pardon for past misdeeds, rather than to trust himself again in the power of the Prince-G-overnor at Bushehr; but he died at Shiraz, and the accident was commonly ascribed to his having partaken of Shurbeh-i-Qajari' or Qajar broth, in other words to his having been poisoned. His brother Muhammad Khan, who had in the meanwhile visited the Ihtisham-ud-Dauleh, was appointed ruler of Dashti in his stead; and the Prince-Governor once more returned to Shiraz by way of Dashti. In 1879 there were local disturbances in Dashti, incident on the collection of the revenue; and in June 1881 Muhammad Khan died at Bushehr, where he had been imprisoned on account of arrears alleged to be due by him to the Government. He was succeeded by his nephew Jamal Khan, a son of Haidar Khan. In July 1884 a fracas occurred at Bushehr between Persian soldiers and some Dashtis who had come to town with a widow of Muhammad Khan, the late chief, and several lives were lost. In 1B87 Jamal Khan appeared at Bushehr in the train of the Nasir-ul- Mulk, on the latter s short-lived resumption of his Government. Dashti was one of the districts of which the charge devolved, on the departure of Prince Nauzar Mirza in 1889 ; on Sartip Muhammad Hasan Khan; and, like Dashtistan, it was at the time disturbed by feuds. In Shibkuh, during this period, interest centred chiefly in the ex ploits and tragic end of Shaikh Mazkur of Kangun. This chief was, about 1877, arrested and sent to Shiraz; but, his successor Mahammad Hasan Khan having failed to give satisfaction, he was reinstated on Paying—or promising to pay—100,000 Qrans. In May 1878, after his return home, helped by Hamad-bin-Isma^l, the ^Obaidli Shaikh of2063 Chiru, and by Muhammad-bin-Hasan, Shaikh of Charak, he undertook an expedition against ^Abdullah-bm-Muhammad, the Hamadi Shaikh of Kalat, whose village of Marbakh the allies were successful in plundering, besides killing 17 men of the Hamadis. In July the Qavvam -ul-Mulk, then Governor of Lar, sent 200 Sarbaz and 700 irregulars with one gun against Shaikh Mazkur ostensibly to punish him for this outrage ; but the force was surprised and defeated by the Shaikh and his adherents. In February 1879 the Qavvam-ul-Mulk in person arrived in Shibkuh with troops, but apparently effected nothing. At length in May 1880, after prolonged petty warfare. Shaikh Mazkur, who had shut himself up in a fort called Surkh, fell into the hands of the Persians. Lured out by treachery, he was forced, though sorely wounded, to ride post in fetters to Shiraz, where ominous preparations were made to put him to a cruel death immediately on arrival. The presence of some European spectators in the throng seems to have served so far to mitigate the form of punishment that the Shaikh was simply strangled at the foot of the scaffold, and the corpse gibbeted on a gallows over which was inscribed an ironical legend.A few of his followers were put to death at the same time; but one of his sons, Hasan, escaped to Bahrain with other members of the family. Shaikh Mazkur ; s fate excited much commiseration, for it was generally believed that his cruel punishment was due less to his raid on the Hamadis than to his failure to make good promises of enhanced revenue which he had rashly given to the Persian authorities. One Muhammed Ibrahim Baig was set up in his place, and Shibkuh remained undisturbed for some time after his death. In April 1883 considerable excitement was caused by the return from Bahrain of Hasan, the son of Shaikh Mazkur, who landed at Tahiri; but, on troops being sent against him, he disappeared. It may be noted that in 1878 or 1879 Shaikh Muhammad-bin-Hasan, the ally of Shaikh Mazkur, was removed from the Government of Charak in favour of a certain ^Abdullah-bin-Musabbah, and fled to the island of Quais. In 1895 trouble occurred at the Tahiri, where Shaikh Ibrahim, the Zabit or official recognised tribal governor, resisted displacement by the Persian authorities to make room for a new nominee; and a considerable force had to be sent to the spot to effect his expulsion. In October 1874 a charge took place in the Government of Lingeh, History which at this time was still a tribally administered Arab principality, in i8?l-90. consequence of the death of the Shaikh, Khallfah-bin-Sa'id,2064. Government of Shaikli Yusuf, 1878-85. o^Shalkh 11 ^ Shaikh Khallfah was succeeded by his son ^Ali^ who too young to 'Ali, 1874-78. transact business himself, was at first largely in the hands of others • and the Persian authorities profited by his minority to interfere more in Lingeh affairs than they had been accustomed to do ; and to increase their financial demands. The revenues were let to the Shaikh's principal adviser, Muhammad Hasan Khan at an enhanced rate; but that individual, finding the inhabitants prepared to desert Lingeh rather than submit to increased taxation, was fain to sublet them at a loss to the youth his master. Even the reduced amount proved incapable of collection ; and the Wazlr was then made a scape-goat and exiled, his private property being all confiscated. In November 1878 the short and troubled administration of Shaikh ''Ali ended with his assassination at the village of Mirakun hj the followers of a certain Shaikh Yusuf, the guardian appointed for him by his father, whom he had dismissed from employment. The Persian authori ties showed no displeasure at this occurrence, and even recognised Yusuf as Deputy Governor of Lingeh on their behalf but in 1878-79, perhaps from the death of Shaikh 'AH, the Nasir-ul-Mulk of Shiraz, became titular Governor of Lingeh. In 1881, in consequence of aggressions by Shaikh Yusuf on British Indian traders, the Governor-General of Fars appointed a 'Passport Officer ,, to reside at Lingeh and act in matters affecting foreigners. In the spring of 1882 it was reported that Lingeh had been separated from Pars and made over to the Amln-us-Sultan, the court favourite at Tehran; but the statement was contradicted by high Persian autho rities, though they admitted, that the customs had been farmed to the Amin-us-Sultan. The separation of Lingeh from Pars proved, however, to be a fact; and Muhammad Hussain Khan, the agent of the Amm-us- Sultan in the Persian Gulf^ soon began to exercise general authority there through a local Wali, who was none other than Shaikh Yusuf himself. An attempt was made in May 1882 by the Amm -us-Sultan ; s repre sentative to introduce various innovations at Lingeh, among which was the institution of a permanent committee of mechants to decide all mercantile cases; but the last mentioned scheme was opposed by the British authorities and was abandonded. Shaikh Yusuf still possessed considerable tribal power, and in March 1885 an armed conflict between him and the Shaikh of Charak was with difficulty averted by mediation. Government the 19th April 1885 Shaikh Yusuf was murdered by a relation, Shaikh Qadhib. His widow and sons fled at first to the British settle-140 fflCsr 2066 ment at Basidu; but in June^ on the advice of the Amin-us-Sultan, they removed thence to the town of Qishm. Lingeh continued for a time in a very disturbed state. In September 1885 Shaikh Qadhib applied to the Qawasim of Trucial ^Oman for armed aid against his enemies; but a warning, conveyed through the Native Agent of the British Government at Sharjah, sufficed to prevent the Shaikhs of Sharjah ; and Ras-al-Khaimah from responding to his appeal. A little later Shahzadeh Muhammad Husain Mirza, who had been appointed Grovernorof Lingeh and Bandar ''Abbas, arrived on the spot a id confirmed Shaikh Qadhib in the Deputy Governorship of the town and district, the yearly revenue of which was now fixed at 190,000 Qrans. The Arab population of Lingeh were loyal to the Shaikh, preferring an Arab to a Persian ruler; but the Persians had resolved on abolishing the system of Local Deputy Governors and on the abasement of the Arab ruling family. On the 11th September 1887 Shaikh Qadhib was surprised and captured at Lingeh by Sartip* Haji Ahmad Khan, deputed from Bushehr for the purpose, after a struggle involving very little loss of life; the Shaikh was removed to Bushehr, and thence in chains to Tehran, his family property being virtually confiscated a Persian official was installed in his place in the person of Mirza Hidayat Khan, a man of sense and moderation; and a garrison of 200 regular Persian troops was located at Lingeh, where barracks were built for them. These changes were not relished by the people of Lingeh, some of whom actually emigrated to other places, while a larger number held themselves in readiness to do so. Lingeh, already detached from Ears, was now included in thfi new administrafcion of the Gulf Ports. In 1888 the Persian troops were mostly withdrawn from Lingeh, and Mirza Muhammad ''Ali, formerly Karguzar of Bandar ^Abbas, was appointed Deputy-Governor. In 1889 there was a detachment of 50 Persian soldiers at Lingeh, and Mirza Muhammad ^Ali was succeeded in the Deputy-Governorship by Mirza Isma/il. In April 1892 Lingeh and Bandar Abbas were combined into one charge under Muhammad Khan, who was appointed Deputy-Governor of both places. In 1895 seme alarm was caused at Lingeh by the violence of one Saiyid Yusuf, who, having killed a man, not only evaded capture but even brought a party to attack the fort. A more vigorous effort at his arrest, directed by the Qavvam-ul-Mulk, was unsuccessful; and afterwards it found impossible to persuade him to renounce his outlaw state and r 6turn to Lingeh.

In September 1887, on the occupation of Lingeh by the Persian^ the Commander of the Persian expedition, Sartip Haji Ahmad Khan, sent a partj of 30 soldiers with two guns under Shaikh Hasan, Shaikh of Qishm, to erect a Persian flagstaff and hoist the Persian flag on Sirri. This was done, the presence of the flag on the island being reported soon after by H. M. S. ' Ranger,^ and drew a reprotest from the Qasimi Shaikh of Shar jah, who claimed that Sirri belonged to the Qawa- sim, a tribe settled chiefly in Trucial ; Oman, not to Persia. This was the view entertained also by the British authorities, who had always under stood that the superintendence over Sirri exercised by the Shaikh of Lingeh resulted from his position as a Shaikh of the Qawasim, and not from his tenure of the Persian port and district of Lingeh. A diplomatic discus sion of the question ensued between the British Legation at Tehran and the Persian Government; but it was discontinued by the British Minister in August 1888, in order to facilitate a settlement of other matters then pending with Persia, without any conclusion having been reached. In the course of argument the Armn-us-Sultan, the Persian Minister concerned, alleged that Sirri had paid revenue to the Persian Government since 1878, in other words since the usurpation of Lingeh by Shaikh Yusuf; but an assertion by him that documents proving the title of Persia to Sirri existed at Bushehr was found, on reference to the best source of information there, to be incorrect. The Persians did not, after their annexation of Sirri in 1887, place a permanent official there; but from that year taxes began to be collected annually on the island by emmissaries of the Persian Deputy-Governor of Lingeh. In 1873 the roads in the vicinity of Bandar ^Abbas were unsafe. ^ February 1874 the Baharlu, a nomadic Arab tribe of the interior, advanced in a threatening manner to within 15 miles of the town, obh ging the inhabitants to arm themselves. Agha Ahmad Shah, Governoi of the place under the Governor-General of Fars, was at Minab an refused to take any steps for the defence of Bandar ; Abbas; hut the tribesmen, fortunately, withdrew without delivering the expected attac • In July 1876 Ahmad Shah died, and the Mo ^tamad-nd-Daulah soon afterwards granted the government to the Nasir-ul-Mulk of Shiraz, ^ ^ appointed a nephew of his own to represent him at Bandar ; AhbaS, l subsequently visited the place in person. In 1877-78 Bandar Abbas was still held by the Nasir-ul-Mulk; and it appears that the coas districts as far as Jashk, together with the islands of Qishm, Hanja 111 ' Larak and Hormuz were included in his grant. In 1878 HaWar ul!!&amp; 2067 then deputy of tlie Nasir-ul-Mulk at Bandar ^Abbas, quitted his ost for reasons of health and returned to Shiraz. In 1881 the administrative arrangements at Bandar ^Abbas were 1882. reported unsatisfactory ; but in 1882 Bandar 'Abbas, like Lingeh, was separated from Fars and came under the authority of the Amin-us-Sultan. In 1883 the administration of Bandar 'Abbas was conducted by one 1883-86, Muhammad Hasan-bin-Nasir, representing Muhammad Husain Khan, the agent in the Persian Gulf of the Amin-us-Sultan; but in the follow ing year Muhammad Husain Khan was generally in personal charge of the place, and his government was found much superior to that of the underlings who represented him in his absence. He resigned his post, however, in March 1885. His successor was Shahzadah Muhammad Husain Mirza, who arrived at Bushehr in April 1885, but apparently did not visit Bandar 'Abbas and Lingeh until the following autumn. In 1886 Bandar 'Abbas was administered, with indifferent results, by obscure and uninflnential persons whom the Malik-ut-Tujjar of Bushehr selected under orders from the Amin-us-Sultan. In 1887, the year of the formation of a Gulf Ports administration 1887. and of the removal of the Arab Shaikh of Lingeh by the Persians, Bandar Abbas also was garrisoned with Persian troops; but most of these were withdrawn in the following year, and in 1889 only 20 soldiers remained. One Mahammad Hasan Baig was Deputy-Governor from 1887 to 1887-96, 1889, and a certain Mirza Hadi in 1889-90. In 1892-93 Bandar 'Abbas was again in danger from the Baharlu, who in October 1892 rebelled against the Persian authorities adjoining their usual seats, and, on troops being sent against them from Shiraz, retired towards the coast with their families, plundering caravans and committing all sorts of excesses, The trade routes were closed in consequence, and the Government revenues could not be collected. Persian troops were sent from Bushehr and other places for the defence of Bandar 'Abbas ; and H. M. S.Cossack 39 proceeded thither from Bombay in January 1893 for the protection of British subjects, and remained for about a fortnight until fear of an attack was over. Eventually the Baharlu were pacified by concessions, including—it would seem—permission for their patron the Qavvam-ul-Mulk to return to Shiraz, whence he had been removed % the Prince Governor; and before the end of May 1893 trade had teen reopened and affairs generally had resumed their normal course. The affairs of the island of Qishm, which though attached to Bandar History 'tthas had interests of its own, call for a short separate notice. In 1872-96. 140 a2068 1877-78 the local ruler of Qishm was Shaikh Sagar^ who had in the past given trouble to the British authorities, especially in the matter of supplies for the British Station of Basidu, but had ceased to do so. Complaints of habitual oppression brought against him by his own subjects were investigated under the orders of the Governor-General of Ears and were dismissed; but the Shaikh had to pay heavily for his exoneration. He was at this time in an advanced stage of consumption and visited Masqat for treatment, but he did not die until 1881, when he was succeeded by his nephew Hasan-bin-Muhammad. In 1886 Qishm was governed by Shaikh Ibrahim, a cousin of Shaikh Hasan; but he was removed by the Malik-ut-Tujjar of Bushehr, and afterwards sent in chains to Tehran, Shaikh Hasan returning to power. The charge against Shaikh Ibrahim was that he had allowed the Shfahs of Qishm to be attacked, during their Muharram celebrations, by the Sunnis; and, though he had in reality done his best to prevent the trouble, he was obliged to pay a fine of 2,000 Qrans. In 188S Shaikh Ibrahim was released from Tehran and allowed to return to Qishm. Intervention of the Assistant Resident on behalf of Haji ^ Abdul Muhammad, Malik-ut- Tujjar, 1849. British political relations with the Persian Coast and Islands before the Anglo-Persian War, 1848-1856. In 1849, during an absence of Shaikh Nasir III from Bushehr on a visit to Shiraz connected with the difficulties, between himself and the Government of Fars, Haji ^Abdul Muhammad, the Malik-ufc-Tujjar or officially recognised head of the Persian mercantile -community, suddenly found himself in great danger from Shaikh Husain, the uncle of Shaikh Nasir; and on the 10th May he came to the British Residency to solicit the protection of Lieutenant Kemball, the Assistant Resident, who seems to have been officiating in charge. The immediate cause of the rupture between the Malik-ut-Tujjar and Shaikh Husain was perhaps an order received by the former from the Shiraz Government, with which, however, he had neglected to comply, that he should direct the merchants of the town to postpone payment of customs duty; but he was suspected by Shaik Nasir^s relations of working for the Shaikh's removal from the Government besides which the strongest animosity had existed between the parties to the quarrel for a number of years. When the Malik-ut- Tujjar made his application to the Assistant Resident he had already assembled all the principal merchants of Bushehr at his house, where they remained day and night, their presence affording some g ua W&lt;M-7 2069 for his safety; and Lieutenant Kemball felt that the slightest appearance of indifference on his own part would probably seal the doom of the unfortunate man. Accordingly, in the course of the two following days, he received the principals in the dispute at the Residency, where he discussed matters with them; and his mediation was so far successful that on the 14th May the Malik-ut Tujjar thought it safe to dismiss the other merchants from his house, and the excitement that had prevailed in the town was allayed. But Shaik Husain soon renewed his threats against the Malik-ut- Tujjar and took measures for preventing his escape from the town by sea or land. On the 22nd May the Malik-ut-Tujjar visited the Assistant Resident again, in a state of great alarm, and it appeared that he had been called [on to leave the town at once, —• a movement on which he thought that he could not venture with safety. He proposed to accept offers that had been made him by Ahmad Khan, son of the Tangistani Chief Baqir Khan, who was absent at Shiraz, to come with an armed party to Bushehr and carry him away to a place of safety; but this idea was discountenanced by Lieutenant Kemball, who feared that a serious en counter might result between the Tangistanis and Shaikh Husain's men. At length on the 25th May, preparations by Shaikh Husain for an attack on Haji 'Abdul Mahammad as he left the town by land having been foiled by the Assistant Resident, who induced the Shaikh actually in charge of Bushehr to convoy him through the gates, and who sent two representatives from the British Residency with him as a precaution against treachery, the Malik-ut-Tujjar was enabled to gain the open country. He was met, at a distance of 5 or 6 miles outside, by an escort of 50 Tangistanis. Lieutenant Kemball's intervention was approved as judicious by Colonel Farrant, the British Charge d 5 Affaires at Tehran.

A general account of the British Campaign in Southern Persia, m 1856-57 has been given above, but it remains to notice some of the pnn- cipal features of the local operations. The assembling in the Persian Gulf of the transports of the original l^^^vous expeditionary force, with the vessels of the Indian Navy by which they2070 'Abbas, 24fh 'November 1856. Declaration Of war and occupation of Kharag Island, 3rd and 4th December,. Landing at Halikh, 7tli to 9tli December. Capture of Eishehr were conveyed, was completed on the 24th November 1856 off Bandar ; Abbas. This place had been chosen by the Government of Bombay as the rendezvous ; but the Government of India^ on the selection coming to their knowledge, suggested that it might be preferable, in order to avoid compromising (or eliciting objections from) the Saiyid of ; 0man ; who held Bandar ; Abbas as a fief under the Persian Government, to substitute Basidu. The Government of Bombay in reply pointed out that Basidu, being situated on the island of Qishm which was included in the Saiyid^s fief, was open to the same objections as Bandar 'Abbas; and that the Saiyid was not likely to protest against, or to be held accountable for, the utilisation of Bandar ''Abbas by the British expedi tion in a manner which he had not authorised and was not in a position to prevent. Meanwhile a number of the vessels employed had left India for Bandar Abbas, and, as their destination could not be altered; tlie discussion was not pursued. On the 29th November the leading ships of the armament appeared off Bushehr; and the Persian Governor of the town, Mirza Hasan 'AH Khan, Darya Baigi, wrote officially to Commander Felix Jones, the British Resident, to enquire the reason of their coming. On the 3rd December, Commander Jones, who had in the meantime betaken himself on board the ' Assaye/' the flagship of the fleet, replied that his func tions as Resident had ceased; and his answer was accompanied by a copy of the Declaration of War issued in India on the 1st November, which was sent on the part of General Stalker, Commanding the British fdrees. On the 4th December the British flag was hoisted on Kharag Island, where a military depot was formed. On the 6th December, most of the transports having at length arrived from Bandar 'Abbas, the vessels were collected at Bandar Halileh, at the south end of the Bushehr peninsula, which had been chosen as a suitable place for disembarking the whole force. The first shots in the war were fired by the steam frigate 'Ajdaha', which with a division of 8 gunboats covered the landing, and some 300 of the enemy who had occupied date groves adjacent to the beach retreated to a distance. The process of disembarkation, though favoured by the weather, was arduous in the extreme, few boats being available except those of the fleet; but it was completed in the short space of three days and two nights. On the morning of the 9th December the advance on Busbebr was begun, the armed vessels of the fleet under Rear-Admiral Sir HentJ2071 111 &lt;4 ai'E g at k at 5^ t u R N Commander-in-Chief o£ the Indian Navy, following a fort, 9tli LeeKe; v December. parallel course along the coast. rj^e old fort of Rishehr, a very high and extensive earthwork sur rounded by a deep and wide ditch, was found to be held by 400 or 500 Tangistanis under Baqir Khan, chief of Tangistan, some of whom at first sallied forth to annoy the British advance guard, while a fire of musketry was also opened from the fort. On the arrival of the British main body the fort, after being shelled by the 8-inch guns of the 'Assaye' from a distance of 1,700 yards, was stormed with the bayonet, H M/s 64th Regiment scaling the north face of the work, while the 20tli Native Infantry entered it at the north-eastern, and the 2nd Europeans and 2nd Baluch Battalion at the south-eastern angle. The first man on the parapet was Captain Wood, Commanding the grenadier company of the 20th Native Infantry, which led the assault ^ he was struck almost at once by seven musket balls, but passed his sword through a leader of the enemy; and he ultimately recovered of his wounds. The defenders of the fort fled out of it on the side next the sea and were pursued southwards, along the beach below the cliffs, by the 3rd Light Cavalry. The casualties on the British side were 8 killed and 37 wounded; the loss of the enemy seems to have been between 200 and 300, including a son and a nephew of Baqir Khan, both killed. Among the British killed were Brigadier Stopford who fell, leading H. M/s 64th Regiment, near the top of the steep incline^ and Lieutenant-Colonel Malet of the 3rd Light Cavalry, who was treacberously attacked by a man to whom he had granted quarter. The British wounded included, besides Captain Wood, Lieutenants Utterson and Warren, also of the 20th Native Infantry, both of whom died of their wounds. The fort was occupied, as soon as taken, by the 2nd Balucbis, and the wounded were sent on boardship the same evening. When the tribesmen occupying the Peninsula were thus being dispersed, Commander F. Jones, the Resident, made an effort to reach to visit Bushehr town in a small steamer under a flag of truce, his object being ^^ )e ' r 9t to avert bloodshed, if possible, and in any case to offer a refuge on board the fleet to such merchants and othet inhabitants of the town as desired one. When the ' Assyria ' arrived at about 500 yards from the shore, however, several shots were fired at her from the Persian batteries; and Commander Jones was obliged to turn back with his mission unaccom plished. A written apology was almost immediately sent off by the Persian Governor, who attributed the incident to the ignorance of the2072 Persian artillerymen; but the attempt to communicate with tlie town was not renewed. About 8 a.m . next morning fire was opened by the steam frigate a Ajdaha the steam sloops ' Berenice ^ and a Victoria and the sloop ' Falkland ^ on a redoubt and trenches a mile and-a-hal£ south of the town^ where the Persians were preparing to oppose the British advance bv land. After an hour's naval bombardment^ which did little damage on account of the greatness of the range, the enemy ; seeing the EritisH military force approaching, quitted the position and retired into the town with their artillery; and General Stalker, when he reached the spot with his troops, passed it without encountering resistance. When the redoubt and trenches were abandoned a flag of truce was sent off from the town to Sir H. Leeke, with a request for an armistice of 24 hours to allow of terms being proposed ; but the request was refused on the ground of the firing upon the ' Assyria ^ on the previous day. A bombardment of the defences of the town from the sea was then undertaken, the ' Semiramis ^ and ' Ferooz bearing the brunt of the action, which was at first well sustained on the part of the Persian artillery ; and in three hours two batteries without the town, a masked battery below the Residency flag staff outside the walls, and a tower oa the north-west angle of the fort were silenced with but little injury however to the works containing them, and a breach in the south -west angle of the town wall had been commenced. Shortly after noon, on the arrival of the British land forces near the walls, the Persian flagstaff in the town was lowered in sign of surrender, after a little hesitation the Persian Governor and the Persian Mili^ ar y Commandant, Sarhang Mehtar Khan, came out and gave up their swords; and some 1,500 or 2,000 men, all that remained of the Persian garrison, many of whom had escaped across the creek to the mainland while others had been drowned in trying to do so, grounded their arms in front of the British line. The town was occupied, the British colouis being hoisted on the Residency flagstaff at 4-30 p.m. There were no British casualties at the capture of Bushehr; hut some of the vessels of the Indian Navy engaged were damaged in u J masts and rigging. After occupation the Persian flag was obtained as a ^ The action of the fleet seems to have been premature, if not actually eonti^y ^ arrangement, in the opinion of the military, who also deplored the failure of the na^ authorities to arrange for preventing the escape of the Persian garrison across ^ creek at the back of the town to the mainland; but the reasons of the Rear A for the couse which he followed ate not on record.207S hv and possession was taken of 65 guns found in the place^ besides Jar e quantities of ammunition and other military stores. The Persian Governor and Commandant, together with Mirza Muhammad Kiza ; the Karguzar or Foreign Office Agent of the Persian Government, were sent on boardship for removal to India; but the ordinary Persian prisoners, after being detained for the night, were set at liberty next morning. The British camp was formed about a mile south of the town near the British Persian redoubt, the 14-gun sloop 'Olive,' a small steamer, and some ' e r „t 8 g ®' fter boats with 24-pounder howitzers being placed in the creek behind the the occa- town to cover one flank, while the other next the sea was protected by the 'Victoria' and 'Ferooz.' The camp was surrounded by an entrenchment consisting of a simple ditch three feet deep and six feet w ide ; with a parapet formed of the earth thrown out; there were flanking batteries at the corners and other salient points ; and the only outpost was a cavalry picket two miles to the southward. Sir H. Leeke left Bushehr for Bombay in the ' Assaye ' on the 16th Dispersal of December; but in passing down the Persian Gulf, he received informa- fo^nea 1 !- tion at Lingeh that a Persian force of 3,000 men, commanded by Mustafa 19t ^ Quli Khan, Amir-i-Panj, and destined for Bushehr or possibly for an ecem e1 ' attack on Basidu, was in the neighbourhood. On the 19th December he found it encamped on the coast, about ^00 yards from the beach, and opened fire on it at a range of about 1,200 yards. The Persians at first replied with their artillery, but after 35 minutes they retreated in great confusion, leaving their guns, tents, and wounded behind, and pursued inland by shells from the ' Assaye.' A few days after assuming command of the British Field Force, Sir Expedition J. Outram resolved on an expedition from Bushehr to upset a formid- t . i . -i , 3rd to 5th able concentration of the enemy which was taking place under tne February Shuja^ul-Mulk at Burazjan. This Persian Commander was reported to 1857. have already about 8,500 cavalry and infantry at his disposal, with 17 guns and a mortar, while 1^ infantry regiments and 35 guns were believed to be on the way from Tehran to join him, and it was understood that tribal levies to the number of 4,000 men could be collected by him at 24 hours 5 notice. The arrival of the 1st Brigade of the 2nd Division from India having rendered action possible, on the evening of the 3rd February a force of all arms marched from Bushehr under Sir J. Outram^s personal command : it consisted of the 3rd Light Cavalry and Poona Horse, mustering 419 sabres; of the 3rd Troop of Horse Artillery and 3rd and 5th Light WdBatteries, each of six guns; of the 64th Foot, 78th Highlanders, aud 2nd Europeans, making 2,212 Europeans; of Sappers, 20th and 26th2074 Native Infantry, 4tli Eifles, and 2nd Balucbis, totalling 2^022 in all 4 ; 653 men, exclusive of the artillery. The Garrison left behind at Bushehr for the protection of the camp comprised 378 European Infantry, 1,466 Indian infantry, and one company of European artillery with 14 guns, besides details from the ships. The column marched all night and on the morning of the 4th reached Chah Kutah, 26 miles distant, where 30,000 lbs. of the enemy ; s powder had been destroyed by a cavalry force from Bushehr on the 1st January 1857. In the evening it advanced another 14 miles and then bivouacked for the night in thunder, hail, rain, and a cutting wind, against which no shelter was available. The march was resumed next morning, the 5tli and shortly after mid-day Burazjan was occupied without opposition, the bulk of the Persian army having withdrawn towards Daliki. Possession was taken of the entrenched camp of the enemy, which had been very hastily abandoned; and the 6th and 7th were passed in collecting great quantities of stores which the Persians had left behind. These included thousands of rounds of gun ammunition, hundreds of thousands of musket cartridges, and 10,000 lbs. of gunpowder, besides other military requisites and some tons of grain j and it was estimated that the explosives destroyed by mines before leaving amounted to 40,000 lbs. There were also tents and camp equipage, but most of these had already been plundered by the villagers. It was decided, after a reconnaissance not to follow up the enemy, who had retired with their guns to strong positions in the hills. March from ^he return march to Bushehr was begcun on the evening* of the 7th .Kurazjaii to t D Khushab, 7th February. About midnight the rearguard was attacked; and soon toSth Febru- afterwards the column, annoyed on all sides by Persian horse and skirmishers, was halted for the night in a defensive formation, the troops facing outward on every side and the baggage and camp folllowers being in the centre. These dispositions were hardly completed when the enemy opened fire with 4 or 5 heavy guns ; the British artillery replied; and a desultory cannonade continued with little effect^ until dawn. Battle of As day broke on the 8th of February the Persians were discovei^ February' ^ P os iti on north-east, on the left rear of the British The Persian right rested on the village of Khushab, which the Bri^ column had passed shortly before halting, and the strength of the enemy seemed to be 6,000 or 7,000 men, including considerable bodies of tribal horse which were posted on the flanks, the Persian position ^ aS reconnoitred by Captain Graves of the 3rd Light Cavalry, who r 0 ^ e along the enemy's entire front, at a distance of 200 yards from un ^ el( f?* &lt;: 7o 2075 : tlie S incessant fire. About this time Sir J. Outram was temporarily his horse falling and rolling 1 upon him, and the operations that followed were directed by General Stalker and Colonel E. Lugard, Chief of the Staff. The British advanced in line to attack the Persian position; but the persians ; paralysed by the fire of the artillery and shattered by cavalry charges, did not wait to encounter the assault of the infantry. They dispersed and fled. The most brilliant feat of the day was performed by a squadron of 120 men of the 3rd Light Cavalry which led by Captai n Forbes, broke into a well formed square consisting of a regiment of 800 athletic northern Persians, scattered it and fell upon the Persian artillery in rear. In this charge Captain Forbes was severely wounded, no less than three of his officers (Captains Moore and Wren and Cornet Combe) had their horses wounded in three places each, and the horse of another (Lieutenant Moore) fell dead upon his rider after leaping into the square. At least 700 of the enemy remained dead upon the field ; two 9-pounder brass guns were captured, with ammunition and a few horses and mules ; and 1,000 or more stand of arms were picked up upon the ground. The action was over by 10 a.m. Sir J. Outram, who recovered from his accident towards the close of the engagement, afterwards wrote of the defeat of the enemy : ' Our small body of horsemen scattered them like chaff, and literally cut them down like corn under the sickle : most stalwart men though their gigantic carcases proved them to be, I never witnessed such carnage at such little cost. The fellows really appeared to court death unresistingly, as if to spite their cowardly officers, who so shamefully deserted them/'' The conduct of the enemey^s horse, from first to last, was ' dastardly in the extreme ' The majority of the defeated Persian force did not stop until they reached Shiraz. The British casualties were only 3 Europeans and 7 Indians killed, and 31 Europeans and 31 Indians wounded, of whom 3 Europeans and 3 Indians subsequently died. An amusing account of the battle was afterwards published by tlie Persian Government in the Tehran Gazette, in which it was pre tended that the magazines destroyed at Burazjan were those of the British, and that the Persians had chased the invaders back to Bushehr. The British column marched again the same evening, in heavy March and a biting wind, through an ocean of mud ; and, the way having ^ to tan lost through the fault of the native guide, it only reached Chagha- Btishehr, 8th dak ^ j.i. r. - — - ^ _ to 10th from Khus* oa the forenoon of the following day. Part of the force reached February*2076 British camp at Bushehr, February 1857. British dispositions at Basidu during the war. Khar a g Island during the operations. Bushehr that night; the 9th of February; and the remainder next morning. Not a single fighting man had been left behind, alive or deadj to fall into the hands of the enemy. The troops had marched from Bushehr to Burazjan (46 miles) in 41 hours, and returned by another route (44 miles) in 50 hours, the time taken on the way back including the action at Khushab. The only protection of the troops against the inclement weather consisted in the greatcoats and blankets carried by the men them selves in default of animal transport, and the ground traversed was sucli as to necessitate an issue of new boots to the entire force on its return to Bushehr. On his return to Bushehr Sir J. Outram at once addressed himself to the strengthening of the British entrenched camp, from which he intend ed shortly to remove the greater part of the Field Force for operations at Muhammareh. Four redoubts were constructed in front of the camp, which now faced the south, and one, with a martello tower in the centre of it, to the rear. The necessity of protecting the British naval station of Basidu on Qishm Island, where coal was stored and where there were buildings of some value, seems to have been overlooked at the beginning of the War, Sir H. Leeke, the Naval Commander-in-Chief, after his bombardment of a Persian camp at Lingeh on the 19th December 1856, took steps to remedy the omission by landing two 68-pounder guns and 80 native marines under the command of a Havaldar, besides stationing the 'Punjab to guard the station and the ' Constance 33 to patrol the channel between Qishm Island and the mainland. The dispositions made by tbe officer of the Indian Navy left in charge were revised by Sir J- Outram, who visited Basidu on the 25th January 1857 on bis way to the front. He caused the guns which he found located a mile away from the buildings they were intended to protect, to 0 moved nearer; and he recommended that a proper complement 0 officers and non-commissioned officers should be supplied to the maime^ besides giving it as his opinion that the (t Constance ;; alone won suffice for the naval defence of the place. Kharag island was occupied during the active operations as hospital station and coal depot, and a detachment from a Native Infant T regiment—supplied in March 1857 by the 4th Rifles— seems to ba^ been considered a sufficient garrison. On the 30th April 1^57 Kbai a s was examined by Sir J. Outram with reference to its suitabiW a1 f 'T / 2077 anatarium for the force which it might be necessary to keep at Bushehr dur i n g the summer. Sir J. Outram, like Sir J. Malcolm in 1808-09, and the officers con cerned with the occupation of the island from 1838 to 184&amp;, seems to have been stronger impressed with the advantages offered by Kharag. With regard to its annexation to the British dominions, at H 0 ne time contemplated, he wrote in May 1857 to the President of the bffiJ B 0ar d of Control of the East India Company. le( N You will see that I approved o£ the proposal in the draft treaty drawn up at home its% for the retention o£ Karrack, and I confess I feel some regret that that point was not secured. In any future war with Persia, a small garrison there, with a few ships of war might effect all that would be required in this quarter, and thus leave the army 6(1 fc f re e to operate upon some more vulnerable # point. Its occupation would have given clilier, us moreover, the command of the Gulf, and rendered null the competition of any other [orojj power which may be seeking to establish its influence here, ofi { A month later he remarked, in connection with the withdrawal of in 11 the greater part of the Field Force to India. Karrack . . is, in my opinion, a preferable position to Bushire, whether considered politically or on military grounds, as commandingf this port and the mouths of the Euphrates, and capable of being maintained even in its present state, by a small garrison against all the power of Persia, and of easily being rendered impregnable to more formidable naval powers. It appears to me that Karrack would also be a preferable position for the Resident in the Persian Gulf, as placing that functionary beyond the necessity of exercising the vexatious interference with Persian subjects which cannot be avoided while he is located in this town. The occupation of the island will not involve the necessity of our taking possession of it as British territory, should the Shah really fulfil the conditions of the treaty. And it is now the most valuable acquisition we could retain if he does not do so. British political relations with the Persian Coast and Islands after the Anglo-Persian War, 1857-1896. After the Anglo-Persian war difficulties arose from an extension given by the Persian Government to their system of Karguzars,—a class of political agents stationed at important centres where there were foreigners, working directly under the orders of the Persian Foreign Office and independent of the Persian local authorities. * Meaning, probably, more vulnerable than the hinterland of Bushehr. t i.e., Bnshehr. Inconve niences occasioned by the Persian Karguzar System, 1860-87.2078 That the system was not entirely new is proved by the fact that the local Karguzar was one of the most important prisoners taken by tlie British at the capture of Bushehr, as already related. The duty of the Karguzar was to watch the interests of the Persian Government in all matters in which foreign representatives and subjects were concerned; and in 1860 the British Resident at Bushehr was instructed by the British Minister at Tehran to communicate in future with the Karguzar in regard to all business which he had been accustomed to transact with the local Governor. In 1867-68 ; when numerous questions of the treaty rights of British subjects were under dispute at Bush ehr, much inconvenience and delay resulted from this restriction on direct dealings between the British Eesi- dent and the ordinary Persian officials. Before this there had been no Karguzar at Bushehr for four or five year^; and in 1868 strong repre sentations on the subject were made to the Persian Government. Ihese resulted in the appointment as Karguzar at Bushehr of Mirza Muham mad Khan, who promised that his attitude would be conciliatory. It does not appear that the inderdict on direct dealings between the British Resident and the Persian Governor was formally removed, though its removal was urged both by Her Majesty's Foreign Office and by the Government of India; but it is clear from the later history of local relations that it must have ceased to be regarded as absolute. In 1873 the British Resident, Colonel E. C. Ross, was able toieport that his relations with the Karguzar, as well as with the Prince Governor of Bushehr, were excellent; but in 1877 he was obliged to complain^ misconduct on the part of that official, with the result that the lattei still Mirza Muhammad Khan—was removed from Bushehr and replaced, as a temporary measure, by one Mirza ^Abdul Karim. In 1881 the Karguzar of Bushehr, Mirza ^Ali Akbar Khan, ^ as placed in charge of the town as Governor, being relieved in the capacity of Foreign Office agent, by Haji Mirza ^Abdullah Khan, his colleag u at Bandar ''Abbas, where also the Karguzar system had by this tim^ been introduced. Mirza ^Ali Akbar Khan, having been guilty mischievous obstruction as Governor, was complained against J the British Minister at Tehran and did not retain the Governors p In November 1887 the Karguzar of Bushehr, Mirza Muhanarn^ Khan, Mo ; tamad-al-Vazareh, whether the same who had held o before does not appear, became entangled in the accounts of the custom house and was imprisoned in his house and deprived of food f or2079 (| a y g He managed to escape to the British Residency, where he remained in sanctuary until arrangements had been made for his proceed ing to Tehran for an investigation into his conduct. In the end he was dismissed, his place being taken by Najaf Quli Khan, an individual of little experience and less standing. At the end of 1859 or beginning of 1860 Commander Felix Jones, the British Kesident at Bushehr, offered H. R. H. the Hisam-ud- Dauleh, Governor-General of Ears, the assistance of a British naval squadron for repressing serious disorders which had broken out along the Persian Coast and threatened to extend to the interior with evil results to trade and the peace of the country; but in vain. The Persian Government, to whom the offer was perhaps renewed through the British Minister at Tehran, evinced no inclination to accept it; and Sir H. Kawlinson thought that, as the proceedings of the Russians at Ashurada in the Caspian had rendered them suspicious of foreign tenders of naval aid, the proposal should not be pressed on them but might be left to be recommended by the Hisam-ud-Danleh himself, when experience should have convinced him of its eligibility. In this view the Government of Bombay concurred. In 1862 some trouble arose through wilful acts of trespass on the British burial ground at Bushehr, committed by Persians, who even brought a part of it under cultivation. Some damage was done also to the enclosure wall. After the matter had been referred to Tehran a fine was inflicted on one of the offenders; and, a paid watchman having been engaged, complaints ceased. It does not seem, however, that action was taken on recommendations by Colonel Pelly, the Acting Resident, that a grant of the land covered by the cemetery should be obtained from the Persian Government and that compensation should be paid to Aghai, the owner of the ground. In 1870, a famine impending and Bushehr being at the time without a Pernor, popular demonstrations took place there against the exportation of grain by British subjects. The Persian Government als o ^nested the British Minister at Tehran to use his influence to restrain British firms from sending grain out of the country. Colonel My, the Resident at Bushehr, was able to arrange that the grain then ln w arehouses of British merchants, mostly wheat, should be a nded over to the Persian local authorities; but at first there was no Persian official on the spot who would take charge of it, and for a ^onth it was sold to the people at a low price through the British Non-accep tance by the Persiau G-overnment of an offer of British naval assistance for repressing disorders on the coast, 1859-60. Difficulties connected with the British cemetery at Bushehr, 1863. British measures of famine relief at Bushehr, 1870-72.2080 merchants themselves. On the arrival of a Governor the British grain still remaining in store was transferred to him. The forced sale of their stocks was regarded as a grievance by the two British firms mostly affected^ Messrs. Malcolm &amp; Co., and Haji Musa, Maimanij who had purchased the grain in April 1870 or earlier, before the Persian Government had announced their intention of preventing exportation; and they were unwilling to accept payment at the rate of Qiins per Man which was offered them by the Persian Government. Even tually a compromise was arranged on a basis slightly more favourable to the merchants ; and, though the latter were dissatisfied with this final settlement also, the Government of India decided not to support their further objections. The famine still continuing, relief committees were organised in 1870 or 1871 at London, Calcutta, and Bombay; and in 187^ His Majesty the Shah formed a Persian relief committee. The originators of the relief movement in India seem to have been Khojah ^Abdul Ghani Miyan, C.S.I., and his son Asad Ullah, of Dacca; and Hindu gentle men also contributed liberally to the funds. A local committee was constituted at Bushehr for the administration of the British and Indian contributions; it consisted of some of the European gentlemen there and was presided over by the Resident; and the money placed at its disposal between July 1871 and February 1872 amounted to 148 ; 507 Qrans. This committee at first distributed cooked food, aud after wards copper coin; but both of these expedients failed owing to the greatness of the crowds that they attracted, which gave rise to confusion and opened the door to abuses. In the end it was found best, at Bushehr, to employ able-bodied applicants for relief in scaveng* ing the town and making roads in the country, while for the aged and helpless, for women, and for children infirmaries, orphanages, ^tc., were established. Bread was given daily to the poor at Sabzabad, the Residents country house, where the women and children from ^e villages mostly congregated ; and relief in cash was afforded to many persons of respectability whom famine had reduced to poverty- The Bushehr committee also made grants for famine expenditure at Kazaran, Shiraz, and Isfahan. In August 1872, a good harvest having been garnered, the relief operations practicallv ceased, a balance ^ 9,713 Qrans remaining in the hands of the Bushehr committee, exclu sive of a reserve fund for orphans of 7,260 Qrans or Rs. 3,000. I n 1873 the proceedings and accounts of the Bushehr committee were closed, at the suggestion of the central relief committee in London.2081 Main In 1873-74 there were various occurrences on the Persian Coast Miscellaneous which affected British subjects and necessitated official remonstrances claims for redress. In January 1873 pilgrims created a disturbance at Bandar 'Abbas, obliging the British Mail Agent to fly for safety, upon which the gun boat ' Hugh Rose' 1 was sent to the spot, with satisfactory results, and orders were obtained from the Persian Govern ment for the careful protection of British subjects by the local Persian officials. A somewhat similar fracas took place at Lingeh; but there the Shaikh protected the Mail Agent and repressed the unruliness of the pilgrims. Near Bushehr a British naval officer was wounded and robbed by a gang of brigands, but the Persian Governor, ' notwith standing many sincere efforts/', was unable to bring the offenders to justice. In March 1874 a British barque went ashore on the island of Shaikh Shu'aib and became a wreck. The presence on the spot of a Munshi from the British Residency prevented the vessel being entirely plundered, and the Native Agent of the British Government at Lingeh soon arrived to assist the captain and to arrange terms of salvage with the Shaikh of Kan gun. A case of not less political than legal and commercial interest was Case of _ that of Marwarid, a Hindu trader at Kirman, who was associated in business with Mul Chand^ a Hindu merchant at Bandar 'Abbas. At 1873-77. the beginning of 1873 this man, after defrauding his partner and another Hindu British subject, turned Muhammadan and assumed the name of Mirza 'Ali Akbar, his idea being to attract Persian support and so escape from British justice. At the instance of the British Legation instructions on the case were sent by the Shah's Government to the Persian Governor of Kirman; but they resulted only in proceedings which afforded no prospect of real redress. At length in 1875, in consequence of representations made by one of the Hindu plaintiffs, the British Minister again addressed the Persian Government and obtained from them an order directed to the Governor of Kirman under which Marwarid was to be sent to Bandar 'Abbas in order that his accounts might be examined there^ at a meeting of Hindus and others, with the cognisance of the Persian Karguzar, and a settlement arranged and reported to the Persian Government. Mr. Thomson, however, perceived two serious difficulties: in the first place the case, as it lay entirely among British objects, was one in which the Persian authorities had no right, according ^ r eaty, to intervene; and, secondly, he understood that neither he himself as Minister nor the Resident in the Persian Gulf, possessed HI &gt;2082 powers by which thej could legally dispose of the case, were Marwarid to be brought before them. In the end it was decided by Her Majesty's Government that the presence of Marwarid should be required, with a view to an adjudication by the Eesident at Bushehr in accordance with usage; and at the end of July 1876 a Ghulam of the British Legation was despatched from Tehran to Kirman with an order to the local authority to send Marwarid with his books and vouchers to Bandar 'Abbas. In September Mr. Edwards, Second Assistant Resident, arrived at Bandar 'Abbas, having been deputed by Colonel Prideaux, the Acting Resident, to enquire into the case; but Marwarid was not there, and Mr. Edwards learned, on proceeding to Minab, that he was still at Kirman. It appeared that Marwarid had taken refuge at the house of a Mujtahid named Haji Agha Alimad, compelling the Governor to arrest him by a stratagem, whereupon a mob of angry Muhammadans attacked the Hindu caravanserai and seized one of the inmates, whom they handled somewhat roughly and detained until Marwarid was restored to the protection of the Mujtahid. The Governor, whom the Hindus suspected of having been bribed, then combined with the Mujtahid to represent the danger, in the excited state of local Muhammadan feeling, of any attempt to send Marwarid to Bandar Aobas, and to recommend instead a pecuniary settlement on the spot; but the Ghulam refused to listen to these proposals as being at variance with the orders of which he was the bearer. Energetic representations were then made by Mr. Thomson at Tehran, iu conse quence of which Marwarid was at last, on the 20th November 1876, sent off to Bandar 'Abbas. It transpired that the procrastination of the Persian Government in the matter proceeded not from any inclination to deny the rightfulness of the British demand, in regard to which the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs himself wrote: ' Tbe British Legation has a distinct right to force and urge upon its subjects to do justice/ but from a desire on the part of the Shah to favoui Mai warid as much as possible, he being a recent convert to Islam, and to afford time for a compromise at Kirman where the Mujtahid had started a pfublic subscription on the man's behalf. At the beginning of January 1877 Marwarid, with some of the Hindu witnesses against him, arrived at Bushehr; and the facts elicited made it necessary that he should be tried on a criminal charge- Under orders from the Government of India Colonel Prideaux, the Resident, conducted the trial at Bushehr; and on the 25th June he sentenced the prisoner, who pleaded guilty to criminal breach of trust, to six months2083 llw . )ous i m pnsonment, exclusive of six months' detention which he had already undergone while under trial. It had previously been ordered the Government of India, perhaps on account of a doubt whether a ^warrant signed by the Resident could be legally recognised by the prison authorities in India, that any sentence passed should be carried out at Bushehr under arrangements made by the Resident. In March 1876 a large Baghlah under British colours was stranded at Hanjam, and immediately on receipt of the intelligence H. M. S. «Arab was despatched to the spot. Her presence saved the Baghlah from being plundered • and the Shaikh of Qishm, who had sent a num ber of boats from Qishm to the scene of the accident, confined himself to causing the vessel to be towed to his port, in hopes of benefiting by her eventually. Afterwards he sent a deputation to Bushehr to explain that his only intention had been to save the Baghlah and her cargo; and he entered into an agreement, which was duly carried out, for the restora tion to the owners of all that he had received from them. In June 1877 the Mo'tamad-ud-Dauleh, then Governor-General of Fars, requested the Acting British Resident at Bushehr to furnish the Persian authorities there with a nominal roll of the servants and dependents of the British Residency for transmission to the Minister for Foreign Affairs at Tehran; but Colonel Prideaux declined to comply, on the ground that to do so ' would be equivalent to admitting the claims of the Persian authorities to interfere with any right to employ such servants in this Residency as I may think fit.'' The request was repeated, apparently in a more extensive form, in the following year, when it was again refused by the Resident^ Colonel Ross. In justification of his attitude the Resident explained that to frame a list correct even for the moment was impossible, owing to the multitude and diversity of the British clients who were continually passing through the ports of the Persian Coast, while persons employed by the British Government or by private British subjects were daily being discharged and replaced by others j that any attempt to keep the Persian authorities continuously informed on the subject would not wly be futile but might cause discussions, hitherto rare, to become frequent; the Persian authorities could always ascertain instantly and without difficulty, by referring to the Residency, the status of any particular individual; that every assistance was invariably afforded to the Persian Government in dealing with Persian subjects in British Employment who were accused of misconduct or breach of the laws, ail( l that such persons when convicted of crime were not again employed; HI A Case of a British Bagbiah at Han jam, 1876. Demands by the Persian authorities for lists of British employes and proteges, 1877-1883.2084 and, finally, that it was the practice of the British Eesidency at Bushehr not to exceed the bounds imposed by treaties and usage, with the happy result that disputes were uncommon. Colonel Ross's reply to the Persian Governor was generally approved by Her Majesty's Government, who remarked that Persian official interference with the menial establish ment of the Bushehr Residency could not be permitted, and that the recognition by the local Persian authorities of the status of indi viduals at Bushehr as British subjects or under British protection could not be allowed to be conditional on the assent of the Government at Tehran; but they thought that a list of the persons in question might be given, if again asked for, as an act of courtesy. In May 1883 the Sahib Divan of Shiraz complained to H. R. H. the Zill-us-Sultan, Governor-General of Fars, that the British Resident at Bushehr moved to his country house at Sabzabad unaccompanied by a guard, and that the Persian authorities were kept in ignorance of the number of his followers and attendants. The first part of this complaint could at once be declared incorrect, inasmucli as a guard of native infantry and some mounted men were always stationed at Sabzabad when the Resident was there; and, as regarded the second part, the Zill-us-Sultan was informed by Mr. Thomson, the British representative at Tehran^ that, if the reference were to British subjects and proteges, no list of such persons had hitherto been furnished to the Persian authorities, and that to supply one would be inconvenient. At the time of the murder of Shaikh 'Ali of Lingeh by Shaikh \ usuf in 1878, an event which threw the neighbouring coast districts into confusion, the island of Qais was regarded as subject to Muhammad -bin- Hasan^ the Al 'All Shaikh of Charak, whose tribe were closely connected with the Al 'AH of Umm-al -Qaiwain on the Arabian side of the Gulf. After the arrival on Q,ais of a respectable merchant family who had left their home in Bahrain in 1849, in consequence of the misgovernment of Shaikh Muhammad-bin-Khalifah, and had settled in the first instance at Lingeh, the island developed a modest degree of prosperity; head of these Bahraini immigrants in 1879 was a certain Mashari* bin-'Abdul Latif. In April 1879, the Persian authorities having conceived the i^ ea of interfering in the affairs of the island and enhancing the revenue assessed on it, a complaint was suddenly preferred by the Persian Government to the British Legation at Tehran of Persian refuged being harboured on Qais by British subjects residing there. As the only British subjects on the island, were Khajahs and Hindu BanrpbS;(ftlsy 2085 ritisli j %( ^6 Go?®!!; 'sons in (pi jceiTwl 1 ' cill gfc^ bj tit M Persian A' .u™. is' ' number, and their servants, who certainly did not harbour ^'•'n refugees and who had been specially warned against interfering Persian ^ ^ seeme( i probable that the Persian complaint was really in ''| 'at the head of the Bahraini settlers, whom it may have been '^^(led to prejudice. Eventually the Persian Government intimated 'he^r intention of punishinf? some of the Arab inhabitants of Qais vho bad been guilty of misbehaviour, and asked that the British subjects W the island might be sent somewhere else for a few days ; but it is I recor ded whether any practical proceedings followed this intimation and request. In January 1880, the Shaikh of Umm-al-Qaiwain proposed to inter fere in Qais to support his Al J Ali kinsmen of Charak against the Persians ; but he was informed by the Resident that, Qais being a part of the Shah's dominions, intervention by him could not be permitted. Some years later it became known that the family of the Qavvam- ul-Mnlk of Shiraz claimed Qais under a grant which they alleged bad been made to them, by the Shah personally, in 1878. In 1880 Shaikh Yusuf, the usurping Arab Shaikh of Lingeh, afbitra- lUWment rilv imprisoned one British Indian trader and compelled others to close their shops. His Mejesty's Ship 'Vulture' was sent to the spot at from Bushehr, carrying a Persian official to whom the duty of mvesti- 1880 . gating the affair had been delegated; and suitable compensation and au ample apology were exacted. In February 1885, a Hindu Faqir named Moti Ram disappeared Caseof^Mofci from the Hindu settlement at Bandar ^ Abbas, and simultaneously money ^ and other valuables were missed from the temple of the Hindu com munity. The Hindus complained to the Persian Karguzar, who referred to Mirza Nasr Ullah Khan, the acting representative of the Persian Deputy Governor ; but there was great delay in the production of the accused ; and when he appeared it was found that he had been ciicum cised and now called himself a Muhammadan. Great excitement followed among the Hindus, who closed their shops by way of expiessing theii indignation and accused Mirza Nasr Ullah Khan of being privy ^ to the theft. The Resident, doubtless on the analogy of Marwarid ; s case, caused Moti Ram to be brought to Bushehr for trial as a British subject; tat, though strong suspicions of his guilt existed, judicial proof w wanting. In regard to the man's change of religion, the Resi en considered that the local authorities had acted with indecent haste and regrettable secrecy; but the convert himself profebsed that conversion was due to religious motives alone. The Deputy overnov2086 promised to remove his acting representative, deposed another petty official, and concurred with the Resident as to the undesirability of the ex-Hindu being allowed to return to Bandar ^Abbas. The years 1887 and 1888 were signalised, as we have already seen, by a spasmodic attempt on the part of the Persian Government to assert themselves in the politics of the Persian Gulf. The prime mover in this undertaking seems to have been the Shah's favourite, the Amm-us- Sultan, to whom the Government of the Gulf Ports had been entrusted; and indications of his ambition of reducing foreign influence were natur ally soon manifested in the Persian districts under his jurisdiction, as well as in foreign relations. In July 1887 Ya^qub-bin-Bashir, a Persian Mufattish or informer who had been posted at Lingeh, brought false accusations of a serious nature against the Native Agent of the British Government there, and misrepresented the action of the Resident, Colonel Ross, in regard to certain claims against pearl-divers of Sirri Island. The Persian Govern ment having adopted the statements of the Mufattish and complained to the British Minister at Tehran, proof was produced of the absolute falsity of the charges against the Native Agent, whereupon the matter dropped. In 1888 the Sa^ad-ul-Mulk, the Amin-us-Sultan ; s first Governor of Bushehr, essayed to distinguish himself by high-handed aggression on British interests. In August, in the case of a consignment of goods from Messrs. C. Sassoon of Manchester, the chief of the Bushehr customs, supported by the Governor, declined to recognise the usual certificate granted by the British Residency for its clearance at foreign rates; and the Governor went so far as to announce to the Resident his intention of opening at the custom house all packages for* Biitannic Majesty's Legation and of examining their contents, a proceeding as much contrary to established usage as it was to ordinary courtesy. The British Minister, Sir H. Drummond Wolff^ having reported that the Amin-us-Sultan's real object was to lower Britisli prestige, Her Majesty's Government authorised him to inform the Persian Government that they would be held strictly responsible foi any acts discourteous to the British Resident at Bushehr, as well as for # Under the Treaty of Turkmanchal, and the Treaty of Peace of 1857, read together, the British Mission had the right to import articles necessary for their own consump tion free of custom duty. Actual verification of the contents of packages for tlie legation implied, therefore, insulting suspicions. Anti-British proceedings of the Amin- us-Sultan's represent atives in the Persian Gulf, 1887-88.2087 Mllf I injury as miglit befall British subjects through the arbitrary b haviour of Persian officials; and the remonstrance was made in so telling a fashion that the Amin-us-Sultan not only gave suitable orders to the Governor of Bushehr, but even offered to telegraph directing him to apologise to the Resident and dismissing the chief of customs. It was not considered necessary, however, to accept these unsolicited amends. In March 1889 the British merchant steamer Transition^ went ashore on the island of Qais and much trouble was experienced from the rapacity of the Shaikh of Charak. His Majesty's Ship ' Kingfisher'-' however rendered timely assistance^ and the vessel was refloated undamaged. In December 1891 a disturbance took place on board the British India S. N. Co/s steamer a Kilwa^ between Bushehr and Lingeh, some Arabs in charge of horses attacking the ship's officers. The Kilwa fortunately overtook II. M. S. a Redbreast/' whose commander sent an armed party on board and removed the ringleaders in the disturbance. They were subsequently tried at Bombay and punished. In October 189^ a British Indian subject named Mughu^ residing in Bahrain, complained that he had been robbed by Malikis, at Naband, of property, chiefly pearls, worth about 26,000 Qrans. Orders that redress should be afforded were obtained from Tehran; but^ in consequence of the obstructiveness of the local authorities, the proceedings seem to have ended with the recovery of 3^388 Qrans' worth of pearls only—a result deplored by Colonel Wilson, the Resident^ who considered the case to be one of great hardship.

British commercial and general interests on the Persian Coast and Islands, 1848—1896. usitt m In 1856 a case occurred which brought under discussion the position of the British Resident in the Persian Gulf with reference to the recovery of sums lent by British Indian subjects to Arab chiefs and others on the Persian Gulf littotal, particularly on the Persian side. The lender in the case specially in question was Pachabhai Tejsi, a ay merchant; the borrower was the Shaikh of Lingeh; and the Recovery of a debt due by the Shaikh of Lingeh to a British Indian credit tor, 1856-58,2088 amount of which recovery as claimed was 1,500 Qrans. The circum stances were considered exceptional by Captain Felix Jones, the Resident a virtual fraud being involved to which the Native Agent of the British Government at Lingeh seemed to have been a party ; and he accordingly sent the ' Clive^ to Lingeh with orders that repayment should be pressed on the Shaikh in an uncompromising manner, yet without com mitting the British authorities to any course of action, of whicli the British Minister in Persia might disapprove. Circumstances connected with the Anglo-Persian War no doubt influenced the Resident in his choice of this somewhat unusual course ; the mission, however, succeeded and the money was recovered. Afterwards, the Court of Directors of the Hon'hle East India Company having animadverted on his conduct in interfering between a money-lender and an Arab Shaikh, Captain Jones wrote The recovery of sums lent by our subjects to Arab Chiefs does in reality form no pait of the duty of the British representative in these parts, though in his intercourse with the Chiefs and people he has always endeavoured by friendly remonstrances to advance their claims by recommending them to the Chiefs, so that they may receive attention in regions where, without the occasional countenance of protecting authority, their mercantile transactions and British Indian trade in general would be precarious if not altogether stagnant. ^ * At the same time I am fully impressed with the correction that the adjustment of ordinary transactions between British Native traders and the Chiefs and the people of these regions should not come under the consideration of the British Kesident, conducted as such transactions are, in a complicated and usurious manner, peculiar to a needy papulation on the one hand and a highly speculative and exacting class like the banians on the other. Indeed, were interference the rule instead of the exception, it would necessitate Courts of Appeal and British Consular authorities in every petty locality of the Gulf. Moreover, owing to insecurity attending trade in all Arab localities, I have more than once promulgated, to those engaged in trade, warning that they are pursuing it at their own risk. The profits are, however, so great that they are heedless of temporary losses and continue in the prosecution of gain, content with the assurances of our general protection against open insult or oppression. It was eventually laid down by the Grovernment of Bombay ' the Resident should, as a general rule, abstain from all interference With the claims of merchants against chiefs and others on the shores of the Persian Gulf ;» and the Secretary of State for India, with reference to these instructions remarked that ' Her Majesty's Government are extremely anxious to avoid all useless interference with the pecuniary and commercial transactions of these Arab chiefs and tribes, and cordially approve the orders issued by you on the subject.' Notwithstanding ^2089 EiilS' Tle ; ; cons tructioii of which they were capable, these orders can hardly, H:' *t must be supposed, have been intended to apply to all the commercial flings of British Indian subjects in the Persian Gulf. ea(! ^ k In 1866 difficulties arose at Bushehr in consequence^of a veto placed Right of it 4 I: ^ the i 00 al officials on the purchase of houses by British merchants from jects to ac-' % Persian subjects. The question was governed by Article 5 of the separate .1 lUi Com pact attached to the Treaty of Turkmanchai between Persia and etc., in Wt % Russia (1828), of which, under the Treaty of I'eace between Persia and ^^5 siluii,. Britain (1857), British subjects were entitled to enjoy the benefit. The fer )N article referred to laid down that, as it was difficult for foreigners in p er sia to hire dwelling houses, warehouses, and places for depositing their merchandise, Russian subjects — and consequently British subjects — should be free to acquire immoveables of those classes in full owner ship. In November 1866 the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs informed Sir C. Alison, the British Minister in Persia, with reference to the Bushelir disputes, that British subjects might acquire immoveable property in Persia only if the hiring of accommodation was impossible, and that even in such cases the extent of the property must not exceed the requirements of the occupier as regards either living room or space for the storage of goods. This reply was forwarded by the British Minister to the Resident at Bushehr with the remark that, while Europeans had undoubtedly bought land in Persia and built on it, the building (as distinguished from the purchase) of houses by foreigners was not speci- tically authorized by treaty ; and that Sir C. Alison thought it well in the circumstances, that Europeans should in the first place try to hire what accommodation they needed, and in case of failure to hire, should arrange to purchase (instead of building) premises. But the limitations which the Persian Ministry sought to impose on the acquisition of im moveable property by foreigners were regarded by Her Majesty^s Govern ment as unwarrantable, and the British representative at Tehran was instructed to shape his action in accordance with this view. Nevertheless, in July 1867, the Persian Minister or Foreign Affairs gave instructions that no landed property should be alienated to British subjects or the subjects of other nations, — an order which the Karguzar ^ Bushehr interpreted as meaning that no houses, habitations, or plain ground could be sold to British subjects or dependents, or to Persian subjects in British employment. In January 1868 the Karguzar sent the Resident a list of the British subjects and dependants in whose favour, under orders from Tehran, no transfer of immoveable property in town2090 or country might be registered; and the list which purported to be issued from the office of the Governor, was evidently as comprehensive as it could be made, including all who were in any way connected witiithe British Residency down to the very Persians employed in it as servants In 1868 Her Britannic Majesty's Minister at Tehran obtained permission for two British subjects to purchase houses, but it was granted by the Persian Government as a concession, and Her Majesty's Government thought that on the next occasion which presented itself the general rights of British subjects in the matter must be firmly insisted on. After this the question seems to have remained dormant until the end of 1874, when Messrs. Gray, Paul &amp; Co., bought some land at Bushehr intending to build warehouses on it, but the Karguzar declined to recog nise the validity of the transfer or to register the deed of sale unless under orders from the Persian Foreign Office. In May 1875 the neces sary orders were procured, not without the intervention of the Britisli Legation ; but the dimensions of the land acquired by the Britisli firm were strictly defined, and orders were given that the local Persian authorities should demolish whatever the purchasers might erect beyond its limits. The British Minister at Tehran, Mr. Thomson, thought it necessary to challenge an expression used by the Persian Government in authorising the sale to Messrs. Gray, Paul &amp; Co., which implied that the authority was granted ' by the Persian Ministers out of respect for the British Legation, and with a view to friendly co-operation, which they deem necessary, as far as possible; 33 and he further claimed, on behalf of British subjects in general, the right to acquire land for building warehouses whenever such were needed. The Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs demurred, in his reply, to these views ^ and, though Mr. Thomson cited numerous cases in which land had been acquired and built on by foreign subjects in Persia, the correspondence ended incon clusively. In 1876, the Persian authorities at Bushehr having declined, in ^ absence of orders from headquarters, to let Messrs. Gray, Paul &amp; Co, Limited, a residential house for members of their firm on a plot of i^nd outside the town specially bought for the purpose, the help of the British Minister at Tehran was requested by Colonel Ross, the Resident, and permission was accorded after some delay. The removal of the British telegraph office from Bushehr to Risbehr. ultimately effected in November 1877, after four years of correspond ence, gave rise to fresh discussions regarding the acquisition of immoveable property in Persia by foreigners. The Persian Government2091 assenting in 1876 to the transfer of the office^ made it a condition that the premises to be occupied at Rishehr should be erected by Persian subjects and [leased, merely, to the British Government; but „ ™ ^ Thomson was careful to state to the Persian Government that the Ipeil acce ptance of the condition was not to be regarded as derogating in any fei I; ^ froin British privileges in regard to immoveable property dependent (}J oii trea ties. A controversy on the subject was purposely avoided, there beiucr a doubt not only whether British subjects were entitled by treaty to build houses in Persia, but also, whether, in such a matter, the British Government could properly claim rights identical with those of their own private subjects. In January 1882 the question was re-opened by a circular note which the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs addressed to the foreign repre sentatives at Tehran. In this document it was asserted that Article 5 of the Separate Compact had frequently been interpreted in a sense too favourable to foreign subjects, ' thereby causing an infraction of the sovereign rights of this country and the rules of its internal organisation,^ and the recipients were invited to caution their nationals against over stepping the true limits of the article. This note was not answered by the Russian Legation, who proposed to deal with cases as they arose ; but the vagueness of its terms did not prevent Mr. R. Thomson, the British representative, from sending a reply in which he pointed out that foreign ers had been allowed, for many years past, to acquire and hold landed property in Persia, especially in Azarbaijan, and that British subjects could not consistently with treaty be shown less indulgence than other foreign subjects. From the tenor of the correspondence it would seem that the point now principally in issue was whether foreigners were entitled under treaty to acquire immoveable property of the nature of estates, and villages in Persia, or whether they were restricted to the items mentioned in the treaty of Turkmanchai,—dwelling houses, warehouses and places for depositing their merchandise. As proof of the existence of the more extensive rights now claimed, the British Minister relied chiefly on the fact that the Bankruptcies Farman 1844 clearly con templated ownership of whole villages, even, by foreign subjects ; and he remarked that no exception had hitherto been taken to the acquisition and holding of estates and villages by Georgian subjects of Eussia in Azarbaijan and other Persian provinces, or by British Indian subjects in certain localities. 0- No further discussion of the subject seems to have taken place ; but in 1885 the Persian Karguzar at Shiraz informed the Native Agent2092 Interference with British trade, particularly grain embargoes, 1863 —96. of the British Government there ' that^ in accordance with tlie holy treaty the subjects and dependents of friendly powers should not be own ers o£ landed property, in the Persian territories, except under the permission and sanction of the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs.' Administrative interference with British trade, dictated sometimes by political and sometimes by other considerations, was not infrequent upon the Persian Coast during the reign of Nasir-ud-Din Shah. In 1867 the agents of the British India Steam Navigation at Bushehr complained to the Resident that they found it almost ble to carry on business at all with Persia, owing to vexatious obstacles thrown in their way by the authorities, especially in the form of sud den embargoes upon particular articles of export. The treatment from which they suffered was totally inconsistent with the liberty of Britisli trade with Persia supposed to exist under treaty; and the Company proposed to abandon Lingeh as a port of call for their vessels, in conse* quence of a recent Persian prohibition against the landing of cargo there. Embargoes on the exportation of grain ; for which scarcity often afforded a pretext or justification, were of common occurrence; and it was noticed that, though they were enforced with great rigidity against foreign merchants, disregard of them by others was tolerated to suoli an extent as to constitute a serious injustice to British traders. In 1863, 1866, and 1868 protests on these grounds against grain embar goes were received from British merchants; but during the famine of 1870—72, as we have already seen, the British aathorities in acquiesced and co-operated in the bringing of the grain trade under official control. In 1873 there were complaints of the exaction of Rahdaii, oi irregular road tolls, on British goods in transit between Bushebi and Shiraz,—a serious and oft-recurring impediment to trade by the mountainous routes leading from the coast into central Persia. At the end of 1874 scarcity was apprehended at Bushehr; and 011 the 23rd December a Saiyid, acting on behalf of one of the Mujt a ^ visited some British proteges engaged in the grain trade and threa e iie them with riots if they should persist in exporting grain which they a bought some time before, and for which they had actually ^ 61 tonnage. Next, in spite of protests by the British Minister at Telnan and a demand by him that the usual months notice of an embalm should be given, the exportation of grain from Bushehi 4 was sudden prohibited by the Persian Government after only 15 warning)2093 Uotl iot infu % occurrence; i| reat rigilW m tolerati Sritisli traiffi there was hope of an indulgence being obtained for Messrs. m ' i an( l Company who had had a large quantity of grain in hand bfre any embargo was proposed. In the end all difficulties were Amoved by an opportune fall of rain. In 1877 there was a rise in the price of grain in Persia, attributed some to the Russo -Turkish war; and the Mujtahids, the self-consti- tated guardians of the public interest in such matters, began to agitate for the imposition of an embargo on export. Early in the year a prohi bition was actually issued by the Government of Pars, but it was soon rescinded, not without the unfortunate result of provoking a riot at Bushehr. The moving spirits in this disturbance were two Saiyid brothers, one of them named Agha Saiyid Sulaiman; and the principal Wiyji sufferer'was Haji Muhammad Ja'far, apparently a British Indian anl fc di subject, wheat belonging to whom was plundered or destroyed by the itvesdJ moh, to the value of 1,800 Qrans, after it had been loaded on a boat, ingot J Prompt and judicious steps were taken by the Acting Resident with the «art Persian authorities, and the ringleaders were arrested, punished, and obliged to make good the value of the grain lost. In March, there being at the moment no interdict in force against the exportation of grain, the Persian Governor of Bandar 'Abhas obliged a British subject there, under threat of a heavy fine, to reland a consignment which he bad shipped ; and a claim for compensation was lodged by the British Minister at Tehran on behalf of the sufferer by this illegal act. The Government then announced a new grain embargo, to come into force from the 18th June; but the British Legation were able to obtain its postponement until the 15th August in the interest of British exporters. &gt; lu June 1878 the British Resident at Bushehr, at the request of some British merchants, urged the removal of the embargo imposed in the previous year, representing that the exportation of grain was really unchecked, and that the only effect of the restriction was to enable the alPe ®' local Persian officials to extort money from would-be exporters. The at Bus^il British Cbarg6 d' Affaires at Tehran was successful in persuading the 0 oftlrf Persian Government to order the withdrawal of the embargo on an andW ^derstanding that the amount of grain exported monthly should be reported to the Persian Government and registered, that exportation sbould take place at Bushehr, Bandar ^Abbas, and Big only, and that on 10 days' notice being given a fresh and absolute embargo might be imposed. To these conditions the Governor of Bushehr added another of J Ms own,—that not more than 8,000 bags of corn should be exported in one month. Meanwhile the British Jndia Steam Navigation Company had iiring tWf aiorife iif ion of Mi jween Bistt to trade111 li ill run i I 2094 proposed to include Rig in the ports visited by their steamers ; but the scheme was obstinately resisted by the Persian authorities^ who regarded with disfavour the development of trade at ports north of Bushehr, where they were not in a position to levy customs. The Bushehr Government even went so far as to seize several wheat-cleaning machines which Messrs. G-ray^ Paul &amp; Co. had placed in boats for despatch to Rig, and one of the machines was broken. These proceedings and the unauthorised limitation of the amount of grain that might be exported from Bushehr necessitated fresh representations at Tehran, in which a point was made of the virtual closure of the port of Rig to British trade; and after a time the machines were restored to the owners with compen sation, the restrictions on the quantity of grain to be exported from Bushehr were withdrawn, and British merchants were permitted to buy grain at Rig on condition of exporting it from Bushehr,—another matter in regard to which there had been difficulty. Finally, however, the Governor of Bushehr, ignoring the orders of the central Goveniment, intimated to the British Resident that, as there was scarcity at Bushehr, the amount of grain exported by British merchants must not exceed 4,000 Mans per mensem. The manipulation of a local restriction in some shape or form was evidently too valuable a privilege to be fore gone. On the 22nd April 1889 the British Minister at Tehran telegraphed to the Resident at Bushehr that, on account of scarcity the exportation of corn from the South of Persia had been forbidden. The British merchants at Bushehr protested against the imposition of this embargo without notice, and asserted that grain was plentiful, mentioning that they themselves held considerable stocks. On representations being made, the Persian Government gave orders against interference with the export of grain purchased before the embargo had been notified. Again in June 1891, notwithstanding an excellent harvest in the plain country, the exportation of grain was again interdicted; but con tracts formed before the issue of the edict were allowed to be executed. An embargo on the exportation of wheat was enacted in May and remained in force until January 1894, drawing from the British Resident at Bushehr the following remarks The measure, whicli is of periodical recurrence, though injuriously affecting the regular operations of the more important merchants, who are Europeans, is very generally recognised as being practically;ineffectual. Any real restraint on export from the nc i corn-producing sea-board tracts from Bushire towards the mouth of the Buphrat^ would be most difficult; and, even if seriously intended or attempted, would be harol/2096 weatiieii .L noitl,,!,' % ft, | Wts li[ ^ ,r( wi% : '^y cticauic,* in view of the fact that scarcely any other means than by sea are available for dispQ^S ^ P 1 ' 0 ^ 1106, ^ thinly veiled and quasi surreptitious export is under stood to be carried on at Bushire itself during these embargoes. 3 In regard to the following year, April 1894 to March 1895, the Resident wrote The beginning of the year saw a revival of the vexatious and useless embargo on the export of wheat. The action taken was sudden ; it was unexpected also in view of the fact that the previously existing embargo had only been removed three months before; indeed, everything connected with this mischievous measure was irregular, capricious and uncertain. Difficulties at once arose in regard to stock for export already purchased or contracted for, and were not arranged without much trouble. British merchants protested, and the newly appointed Governor, immediately on his arrival, sought our support in representations at Tehran against the measure on the ground of its uselessness as regards its ostensible object—the relief of scarcity at Shiraz—which the miserable state of the road and the cost of transport practically barred, and the injury to the producers in view of the abundant harvest in the coast districts. A certain remedy for the situation after Persian methods was soon found in an extensive evasion of the edict, considerable shipments beingimade with very transparent secrecy, with the result that export to the value of over £21,000 was effected during a year over three- fourths of which the embargor ested. So good a harvest would, however, doubtless have produced a heavier export under normal conditions as the uncertainty and vexatious to which the trade was liable could not but operate to materially restrict it. In 1895-96 grain was again subject to a nominal embargo throughout the year; but the prohibition was freely evaded during the greater part of the period. One of the chief recommendations of the measure in the eyes of the local Persian officials was still, clearly, the means which it afforded of extorting money from merchants—in the form of doucaurs for connivance at evasion'—^without open violation of the treaty rights of foreigners. The working of the Persian customs in relation to British trade also, at times, gave cause for serious dissatisfaction. In 1856, the Persian authorities having enhanced the revenue payable 1856—92 by the Arab Shaikh who then governed Lingah, the Shaikh in his turn sought, apparently at the suggestion of the Persian authorities themselves, to increase the rates at which customs duty was recovered from merchants. The British India traders of Lingah at once protested, and tbey were supported by the British authorities in their refusal to pay customs at a higher rate than the 5 per cent, ad valorem sanctioned by the Anglo-Persian Commercial Treaty of 1841, which was then still in force. British trade and the Persian * The meaning seems to be that, though export b&gt;y sea might be prevented, other districts of Persia would not benefit on account of the badness of internal communica- tions, and that the measui e could therefore hardly be successful.2096 Of a different nature was a difficulty that arose in 1874 respecting the treatment^ in regard to customs duty^ of Persian subjects employed as agents by British mercantile firms. The question seems to have been first raised by Messrs. Gray, Paul and Co., who drew the Resident's attention to the large increase of merchandise imported here by Persian subjects who succeed in passing the same under foreign treaty stipulations, on the plea that the said merchandise ostensibly belongs to Indian subjects in Bombay, thus evading the higher customs on particular articles (due) from them as subjects of the Shah j' and they suggested that none but British subjects residing in Persia should be held entitled to the benefit of the treaty stipulations in respect of custoiM. The point was referred by the Resident, Colonel Ross, to the Govern ment of India, who replied that ; provided goods were hond fide the property of British subjects, they must be allowed the benefit of the lower scale of duty secured to British merchants by treaty, without regard to whether the owners resided in Persia or not, or to whether their local agents were British or Persian subjects. The Government of India did not think that British merchants dealing with Persia should be hampered in their choice of local agents. Meanwhile the Persian Government, moved by considerations connected with the loss of customs revenue by fraud, and so different from those actuating Messrs. Gray, Paul &amp; Co., had also taken up the matter; and they presently informed the British representative at Tehran that orders had been issued forbidding Persian subjects to be agents for foreign merchants at Persian ports, or to concern themselves with the goods of such merchants or the payment of customs duty thereon. Mr. Thomson protested against the interference implied with the choice of local agents by British firms, and promised them any specific instances of fraud that could be alleged should be fully and impartially dealt with by tl' 6 local British authorities. The Government of India, it may be observed; had previously informed the Resident that they did not regard it as their province to devise measures for protecting the Persian customs hous( against frauds perpetrated by subjects of the Shah. The Persian Govern ment persisted for a time in their objection to the tenure of foreign com mercial agencies by Persian subjects; and early in 1876, under instil tions from Tehran, the Government of Bushehr actually took bonds f 10 ® several Persian subjects not to act in future as the representatives foreign firms. Ultimately, however, on the matter being * Tehran, the bonds taken were returned, and no more were exacted. The farming of the customs of all Persia to the Amin -us -Sultan al) ^ 1882 was productive of difficulties at various places, especially2097 ithtiielfe (il 111 smaller Persian ports, the customs of which, formerly collected by the local chiefs on their own account, were now claimed by the Farmer-Gene- ralashis. In May 1882 goods on which British merchants had already paid export duty at Big and Ma'shur f Arabistan) were taxed a second time at Bushehr, the previous payments to the tribal Zabits of the places mentioned not being recognised ; but refunds of the second pay ments were obtained. In the same month the Zabit of Dilam, while con tinuing to realise dues of the same amount as the former export duties at his port ; declined to grant certificates of customs liability having been discharged ; and the result was that Dilam exports were taxed at a double rate ; for they were assessed to export duty on shipment from Bushehr. In April 1884 there was a fresh crop of complaints, the Zabits of minor ports having begun, on a hint from Tehran, to recoup themselves for the export duties which they were no longer allowed to collect by levying a charge on the carriers of goods from their ports to Bushehr, ^—a charge which in the end necessarily fell upon the actual exporters at Bushehr. Receipts for duty paid at Rig and Dilam by Messrs. Muir &amp; Co., British grain merchants, were dishonoured on presentation at the Bushehr Cus toms House, and the firm found themselves under the necessity of paying a sum of about ,£70 a second time over. Extra duties were also levied at the gates on merchandise entering Bushehr town from the interior, and for these no receipts were granted. Mr. Thomson, the British representative at Tehran, was successful however, after some delay, in procuring the issue of orders that not more than 5 percent, ad valorem in all should be levied on goods exported by Briljish merchants; these apparently reached Bushehr in July 1884, and they were followed by a refund through the Persian local authorities of over £120 on account of second payments wrongfully extorted from British merchants. Double recovery of customs duty seems to have continued to some extent, however, until 1886 or 1887, when the Amin-us-Sultan argued that British merchants were not entitled to make use of any ports but Bushehr and Bandar ^ Abbas, that it was permissible to levy internal dues on the transit of goods from one port of Persia to another, and that the 'Officials ^ at Muhammereh ('Arabistan); and Dilam, and Rig,— meaning probably the tribal chiefs of those places — had no printed customs forms that their manuscript certificates of payment could not be accepted at other Persian custom houses. By April 1887 an attempt which was ^ing made to bring the customs of the ports north of Bushehr under the administration of the Amin-us-Sultan had fallen through, and the Knister himself informed Mr. Nicolson, the British representative at 1422098 Tehran, that consequently no customs would be levied ^t those ports, an arrangement which seems to have removed every difficulty. At Bushehr it was always the custom that foreign goods imported paid 5 per cent, import duty on landing, after which a Jawaz (a pass) was granted, entitling them to be conveyed to places in the interior without further payment at internal custom houses, toll stations, etc., on the way. At Bandar ^Abbas, before 1889, a different system prevailed. There only 8J per cent, was collected on importation, but Jawazes were not issued; and persons carrying imported goods up-country had to meet all the road side demands to which the ordinary traffic of the country was liable, and which in some cases amounted to more than the balance o£ 1| percent. The British merchants of Lingeh naturally preferred the existing system, under which they paid only 3 J per cent, altogether ; but those of Mash- had seem to have found it disadvantageous, and to have complained. The maintenance of a double system at Bandar ''Abbas, for the benefit of two classes of British traders, could not reasonably be pressed on the Persian Government; so eventually in 1892, after discussions at Tehran, the practice at Bandar 'Abbas was assimilated to that at Bushehr. British statu b i n 1871 the British status of Messrs. Malcolm &amp; Co., a business Makolm S &amp; having its head-quarters at Bushehr, was called in question by the Co^^ushchr, p er sian authorities, careful examination of the history of the family by bay find Per- which it was owned showed that, though Persian subjects, they had been taken under British protection about 18^0; that their status as Biitish protected persons, which the Treaty of Peace of 1857 could not be held to have affected, had remained unchanged after the Anglo-Persian wai, that ever since the war, as well as before it, they had paid customs duty on the footing of foreign subjects; and that the Persian authorities had in the past invariably treated them as under British protection. Their title to be regarded as British protected persons was accordingly^ under the orders of Her Majesty's Government maintained by the British Minister in Persia; but in 1877 it was held by the Government of that they were nevertheless not entitled, under the Merchant Shipp 1D o Act, 1854, to own British vessels or to fly the British flag. In 1880 the case of the Bombay and Persia S, N. Co. came consideration. This was a Steamship Company composed of Persian British Indian shareholders, many of the former class being residents 0 Bushehr, Tehran, Yazd, and Bombay, some of them naturalised Bntis subjects. The Company was registered in Bombay, and its ve were registered as British ships and carried British colours; but its local2099 o-ents in were P^si 3,11 subjects. On the principle that the corporation and not the individual shareholders were the owners of the ships, the Government of India decided to treat the concern as a British interest and instructed the Resident in the Persian Gulf to grant to the Company the assistance required^ on the understanding that their Agents at Bushire and other Gulf ports, being Persian subjects, are not personally entitled to British protection or to assistance in matters unconnected with the Company's vessels and trade. •' British official matters on the Persian Coast and Islands, 1848-96, The most important change of the period in the British official arrangements connected with the Persian Coast and Islands was the transfer, in January 1873, of the Persian Gulf Residency and its dependent establishments from the superintendence of the Government of Bombay to that of the Government of India. This radical alteration is noticed more fully in the chapter on the general history of the Persian Gulf. Transfer of the Persian Gulf Resi dency from the Govern ment of Bombay to the Govern ment of India, 1873. ioii Keverting to local matters, we find that the superior staff of the ^perior . . ^ , btan of the Bushehr Residency varied but little during the time now under considera-' Persian Gulf tion ; except in regard to the number and status of the Residents Assistants,'—a question which will be fully treated further on, Resident, and their pay, 1848-96, In 1860, as in 1834,the officers of the Residency Staff were three: the Resident, whose salary was still Rs. 2,400 per mensem; the Assistant Resident, whose consolidated pay had been increased from Rs. 500 to Rs. 700 ; and the Surgeon, whose total emoluments had been reduced from Rs. 650 to Rs. 515. In 1862, in the course of a general readjust ment of salaries at Bushehr, Masqat, Aden, and Zanzibar, the salary of tbeResident in the Persian Gulf was reduced to Rs. 2,000 a month; but in 1866, on the representation of Colonel Pelly, it was raised again to its former level. In 1870 the Government of India proposed to increase Colonel Pelly's pay to Rs, 3,000 a month, economies being made per wntra in the cost of the Political Agency at Baghdad ; but the Govern- }pnt of Bombay were averse from any reduction in the salary of the 142 A2100 Political Agent at Baghdad and thought that the Bushehr Eesitleni/s pay should not be too greatly increased with reference to that of the British Minister at Tehran (£5^000 a year) ; to whom he would become entirely subordinate in case the Legation were placed, as had been proposed^ under the Indian Government. In the end a compromise was effected, and it was decided to raise Colonel Pelly^s salary Es. 2,600 per mensem, the Es. 200 a month required being found by the suppres sion of the Baghdad-Syria Dromedary Post subsidy. Assistants to The possibility of abolishing the Assistant Eesidentship at Bushehr, 184^96^ en ^ , c0n ^ em pl a ted in 1835, 1838 and 1841, was considered anew in 1852, 1860 and 1862. In 1852 on the departure of Colonel Hennell, the Resi dent, from the Gulf, and the appointment of the Assistant Resident, Lt. Kemball, in his place, the Government of Bombay referred the point to the Government of India for orders, with a strong recommendation that the post of Assistant Resident should be maintained, observing that ' the Offices of Political Agent in Turkish Arabia and of Resident in the Persian Gulf are, as has been shown on the occasion of Lt.-Col. Eawlinson^s recent absence in Europe, dependent on the appointment of the Assistant to the Resident for a qualified officer as a locum tenens in case of any sudden emergencyand the Government of India con curred in their views. In 1860 the Resident in the Persian Gulf was invited by the Government of India to consider whether he could dis pense with an Assistant; but, on his reporting that he could not, the appointment was provisionally continued. In 1^)2, the importance of Zanzibar having increased and work in the Persian Gulf being diminished by the withdrawal of the Indian Navy from its waters, the Resident at Bushehr seems, besides having his pay reduced as already mentioned, to have been deprived of his Assistant; and for four years he would appear to have carried on the work of the post single-handed. In 1864 the states of the Head Clerk and Accountant of the Residents Office was altered to that of ' Uncovenanted Assistant in charge of the Residency Treasury', his salary being raised to Rs. 250 a month, but this was obviously not a change that could afford much relief to the Resident in his more important duties. In 1865-66, in connection with British hostilities against the Wahhabis,the question arose of how to supply advisers conversant with local politics and languages to the commanders of vessels of the Royal Navy employed in the Persian Gulf; this was a part which had been efficient ly played by the officers of the Indian Navy until the abolition of that service; and the dubious success of operations against Qatif and Dammam2101 in 1866, to accompany which Col. Felly had been able to depute a Native Agent only, emphasised the necessity for proper arrangements. Ultim* ately it was decided that two'Assistants to the Resident,—a first Assistant on Bs. 1,000 and a Second Assistant on Rs 700 a month—should be appointed at Bushehr. The senior of the first pair nominated was Capt. A. C. Way. In 1879, on the recommendation of a Financial Committee in India, the Second Assistantship was abolished, the chief reason assigned being a diminution of work in consequence of the removal of the Residency steamer; and the pay of the remaining Assistantship was cut down to Rs. 800 a month. This was, perhaps, an excessive reduction of staff ; for in 1882 the appointment of a Native Assistant to the Resident on a consolidated salary of Rs. 350 was considered justifiable. Personal con siderations accounted in part for the creation of the new post, which was conferred on Assistant Surgeon ^Abdur Rahim, Hakim, till then in medical and general charge of Basidu, whose knowledge of Arabic and Persian, professional qualifications, and Muhammadan religion combined gave him peculiar advantages in his intercourse with natives of the country; and it was ordered by the Secretary of State for India that the new Assistantship should not be regarded as a permanent addition to the Residency Staff. In 1889, on the transfer of Assistant Surgeon ^Abdur Rahim to an Attacheship in the Foreign Office of the Government of India, the ques tion of the assistance required by the Resident was re-examined, and Colonel Ross was able to convince Government that ; in view of increasing work, an Extra Assistant would be permanently needed at Bu. o hehr, in addition to the First and Uncovenanted Assistants. Mr. S. Lucas was the first incumbent of the Extra Assistantship created. So early as 1856, and perhaps earlier, there was at Lingeh a Native Agent of the British Government, subordinate to the Resident at Bushehr. This Native Agent was charged with the immediate supervision of British interests on the greater part of the Persian Coast below Bushehr. There was also a Native Agency at Shiraz, which had existed from Native i , Agency at very early times. Siraz, 1848- 96. In 1850, the appointment, which carried with it a salary of 400 Ttimans a year and much local influence and prestige, was vacant, the ^cnmbent havihg^been dismissed for misconduct. Nominations to the Native Agency Lingeh, 1848-96.2102 Shiraz Agency were made by H. B. M/s Minister at Tehran; and it will be remembered that the opposition of the Persian Government to a certain appointment to this post in 1855 was among the causes leading to the Anglo-Persian war. In 1873 the Shiraz Agency was described as being partly under the Government of India^ and the Agent as receiving occasional instructions from the Resident at Bushebr. The Agent in 1875 was Mirza Hasan ''Ali Khan^ from whom Colonel Ross^ Resident at Busheh^ reported having received ff very efficient and zealous assistance 'y and this gentle man held office until 1878 at least, when his brother Nawab Haidar ; Ali Khan temporarily succeeded him. In 1881 Haidar ; Ali Khan was still, or again, acting as Native Agent at Shiraz.

The need of lawful authority for disposing of the cases, criminal and civil, of British subjects was early felt by the British local officers, and was from time to time represented by the Resident at Bushehr, especially after the great increase of Activity in the Persian Gulf caused by the introduction of regular steamer communications; telegraphs, and Post Offices. Owing to the extraordinary complexity of the political and legal considerations involved it was long, however, be fore arrangements were devised to meet the requirements of the situation. The grant of consular powers to the Resident was suggested by Major Hennell in 1844 and by Captain P. Jones in 1855, but was* - deemed im practicable in view of the terms of the Anglo-Persian Treaty of Com merce of 1841. The Treaty of Peace of 1857 opened the way for conferment of consular appointments elsewhere than at Tehran and Tabriz) and in 1878 Colonel E. C. Ross, Resident at Bushehr, was appointed H. B. M/s Consul-General for the Province of Pars and the Coast and Islands of the Persian Gulf within the dominions of Persia.

The extra-territorial juris diction of the Resident, as Consul-General, over British subjects in Persia was not regularly established or defined, however, until the appearance of the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council, 1889, in the drafting of which great difficulty was experienced, and an essential modification of which was found necessary, in consequence of Persian objections, in 1895. The Order placed the jurisdiction of the Consul-General on a legal basis and subjected him to the Supervision, in criminal and civil matters, of the High Cotirt of Bombay. The Residency bnilding in Bushehr town, which continued at the Eesidendy site which it had occupied since the early part of Fat-h 'Ali Shah^s Bnshehr.^ reign, was described as follows in 1850 : ' The Residency is situated on an exposed and airy spot on the south side. It consists of a court surrounded with buildings, including the Residents mansion and various other lodgings, with out-houses and stables. On the side to wards the sea, stands the flagstaff. Besides the British Resident and his family, the medical officer attached to the station has apartments here, and there are also lodgings for strangers.../' Additions were made to the Residency building down to the period of the Anglo-Persian war, and possibly after it. In April 1869, Colonel Pelly complained of the unhealthiness of Bushehr town and sought the aid of the British Minister at Tehran in obtaining a site for a new Residency building in the open country but the Shah was opposed to the idea of a removal, and the scheme was shelved. In 1850 the Resident had a country house at Chaghadak on th^ Ciouhtry mainland, where there were also two other houses belonging to Residency with officials; these were built with the consent of the Persian Government, the Resi- They were destroyed in the war of 1856-57 and were not rebuilt* dency. To replace them a site at Sabzabad On the Bushehr peninsula was obtained by Captain F. Jones from the Persian authorities in 1858 ; and there he built the Resident's present country houses but while it was in course of erection it was made the subject of gross misrepresentations at Tehran^ and a plan of it had to be submitted to the Persian Central Gov ernment before its completion was authorised. In 1860 a small bun galow for the Residency Surgeon was begun at the same place, and at first no objections were raised by the Persians ; but some months later, in retaliation for British opposition to Persian proceedings in Bahrain, it one night razed to the ground by the Persian authorities on the plea2104 Britisli Resi dency guard and Resi dent's mounted escort. Itesidency steamer. of its beiug an unauthorised addition to the plan sanctioned by the Persian Government. On the final departure of Captain Jones from Bushehr in 1862 the Sabzabad house was purchased for the telegraph department^ but before long it was transferred to the Resident for Ms use. The Indian military guard of the British Residency at Bushehr con 4 sisted in 1850 of 36 sepoys. In 1856 its strength was still the same and it was commanded by a Subadar. In the latter year Captain Jones, the Resident, proposed to reduce it to 2 non-commissioned officers and VI men, substituting for the remainder a mounted escort, recruited locally, which would be more useful for various purposes such as carrying des patches. This scheme was sanctioned by the Government of Bombay, but was not carried into effect owing to the Anglo-Persian war. In 1863 Colonel Pelly revived Captain Jones^ proposals with two modifications, viz., that the whole infantry detachment should be re placed by a mounted escort, organised on the Silladar system, and that this escort should be obtained from India. The last infantry guard re turned to India in September 1864, its place being taken by the new mounted escort, of which the authorised strength seems to have been 3 non-commissioned officers and 18 troopers. In 1878 there was again, in addition to the mounted escort, a detach ment of 16 men of the Bombay Marine Battalion at Bushehr. Difficulty seems to have been experienced in maintaining the mounted escort, for which volunteers of a proper class were not easily obtained m India, the expense of keeping up their horses and equipment under the Silladar system being apparently regarded by the men as a grievance; and the escort was progressively reduced to 2 non-commissioned officers, 1^ troopers and 4 menials in 1891, and to 1 non-commissioned officer, B troopers and 4 menials in 1892, the individual pay being at the same time raised. Finally, in 1893, the purchase and feed of horses and the supply of saddlery was undertaken by the Government of India, a small subscription being still required from the men for other purposes; and the strength of the escort was finally fixed at 1 non-commissioned officer and 8 troopers. The Indian infantry detachment thus became again the main protection of the Residency. So long as the Indian Navy continued to exist, that is until there was always some vessel available to carry the Resident on b is frequent and necessary tours to different parts of the Persian Gulf. But, when the duties of the Indian Navy were transferred to the Bopl Navy and the ships of the former withdrawn, the provision of ar fljfsr| 2105 ial steamer for the Residents use and for other political duties became imperative; and the 'Berenice/' formerly belonging to the Indian Nav^ appears to have been supplied, her guns being first removed. hi a later period there was for a time,—from 1876 to 1887, —no Residency Steamer at Bushehr; but in the latter year a permanent vessel was given, the ' Lawrence/' belonging to the Royal Indian Marine. It has been shown that Basidu came finally iunder British occu- Affairs of pation in the autumn of 1823, evidently without the consent of the Persian Government, who claimed full sovereignty over the whole island Basidu. of Qishm and who had previously protested against the presence of a British force thereon. The Basidu station was at first a d^pot of the Indian Navy; and the stores there were in charge, until 1833, of the purser of the ship of the Commodore in the Persian Gulf, an allowance of Rs., 200 a month being paid him on this account. In 1833 the allowance was withdrawn, and the Commodore became responsible for the stores. The dispositions made for the defence of Basidu during the war of 1856-57 have been described in an earlier paragraph. In 1858 Commodore Jenkins, I.N., reported that he had divested himself of charge of the Basidu stores and had appointed the purser of his ship to be Store-keeper, as well as receiver and Superintendent I of liberated slaves, from which it would appear that Basidu was at this time a place of some importance in connection with British measures for the extinction of the slave trade. This arrangement did not commend itself to the Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Navy; and in 1860, on his recommendation and that of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, a native store agent and Store-keeper was appoint ed at Basidu instead of a European. In 1863 it was considered whether the Basidu station might not be abandoned altogether or, as an alternative, whether the stores there —chiefly coal-—might not be left without military protection, a detachment of native infantry which was generally kept there as a guard being withdrawn. The Resident, Colonel Pelly, pointed out however that Basidu, though not an ideal station, possessed certain advantages; that a coal depot was required somewhere in the Persian Gulf; that Basidu, for physical, political and military reasons, was # The ' Lawrence ' is a steel paddle steamer of 902 gross tonnage and 1,277 indicated Wse power, with a speed of 12 knots.

Nordenfelts, and four *45-inc]i five- barrel Nordenfelts.2106 probably preferable to Bushehr—the only other possible place—as tte site for one; that the necessary buildings already existed at Basidu and that possession of the place, once relinquished, might be difficult to recover in consequence of opposition by the Persian Government. Colonel Pelly also thought that the depot, if retained, could not be left altogether unprotected. On these grounds it was decided not at once to withdraw the existing guard, of which the ordinary strength seems to have been only 1 non-commissioned officer and 6 sepoys of the Bombay Marine Battalion. On different occasions from 1863 to 1868 the surrender of fugitive slaves who had taken refuge in the British station of Basidu was re* quested by the Persian authorities, an accusation of their having com mitted some offence being sometimes added to give colour to the demand. The question of the action to be taken was more than once referred by the Resident to the Government of Bombay; but, Basidu being re garded by that Government as virtually British territory and no agree- ment for extradition existing between the British and the Persian Government, it does not appear that compliance with the wishes of the Persian authorities was in any instance sanctioned. In 1868, when as yet no powers of extra-territoral jurisdiction had been conferred on the Resident in the Persian Gulf, a different question arose through the commission by one Sa'id Sidi, who admitted his guilt of a murder at Basidu. This case ultimately came before the Government of India, who suggested that, as there was—for technical reasons of jurisdiction—no prospects of a conviction being obtained m any Indian court, and as it was undesirable that the prisoner should merely be deported to the mainland and released as had been proposed; arrangements should be made for the trial of Sa ; id Sidi^s and other similar cases by the Resident in the Persian Gulf or his subordinates^ theoretically under authority delegated by the native ruler of the territory in which the case arose,—a system analogous to that followe by the British authorities in Native States in India. Whether this solu tion of the difficulty was actually adopted does not appear; and, f^ 0111 the discussions regarding the Residents powers which continued with out result till many years later, it would seem that there were at le aS grave difficulties in the way of its adoption i The importance of Sa^id Sidi^s case was political, however, rather than judicial, and lay in the following distinct pronouncement by Government of India, which it occasioned. On the subject of the status210'? .ary ^ iitH There may be some obscurity as to tbe exact nature of 0f derivative title to the town o£ Bassidore, and it may have been igtt that we becomes ev i^ en t that our rights are subordinate to those of that our rights over the town existed by continued usage, or MascaC which again are, admittedly, entirely subordinate to those of Persia, and have been always so treated up to this very hour/' In 18T2 it was decided to transfer the Basidu coal depot to Hanjam Island where a British telegraph station had been established ; but the idea was abandoned on account of difficulties, noticed further on, regard ing the ownership of Hanjam. In 1873 the military guard at Basidu was still furnished by the Bombay Marine Battalion (21st Native Insantry); the station was under the general supervision of Assistant Surgeon 'Abdur Rahim, Hakim, of the Indian Medical Service, who resided there ; and the only local troubles arose from difficulties thrown by the Shaikh of Qishmin tlie way of obtaining supplies, and from the dilapidated state of the pier. The coal depot was still kept up, and Government vessels occa sionally called to fill their bunkers. In 1874, of four native appointments existing at Basidu, those of Clerk, Slave Agent, and Munshi were abolished, a Coal Agent only being retained. In 1876 ill-feeling had sprung up between the inhabitants of Basidu and those of some of the neighbouring villages, and the Shaikh of Qishm appeared to be encouraging petty annoyances at the station ; but these matters were arranged, after full investigation, by Colonel Ross, the Resident, on a special visit to Qishm j and all trouble ceased. The pier had been repaired; the buildings were in good order; the health of the community was satisfactory; and the work of Assistant Surgeon 'Abdur Eahim, who still continued in general charge of Basidu, was commended by the Resident. A Basidu Coal Agent, Haji 'Abbas, was dismissed in 1877, by order ppeail^ j of the Resident, for possessing a slave in defiance of British proclama tions, annually published on the subject. About the beginning of 1878, in compliance with orders from the Government of India, Colonel Ross reported the reasons for which, in the Persian Gulf, Basidu was regarded as a British possession; these were ^solvable, practically, into the plain marks and open exercise or what n regarded as such—of British sovereignty, against which the2108 Arrange ments for tte occupation of Han jam as a British Telegraph Station, 1866-68, and its reten tion as such till 1880. Persian Government had never made any protest. There were buildings, a good stone pier, a coal d^pot, and water tanks; a military guard was maintained, though scarcely now required for protection; and the plain Union Jack was constantly flown, not to mark the presence of a political representative—for there was none, but as a sign of occupation in full right. The Persians and Arabs of the adjoining country, no less than the British political officers in the Gulf, had been accustomed to regard Basidu as British soil. Colonel Eoss considered that the station was, for the time being, of little actual use; but he held that, for the simple reason that the place was under the British flag, its retention was until a more useful equivalent, also under the flag, should obtained elsewhere. In 1878, with a view to more frequent relief of the Indian military guards at Baghdad, Bushehr. etc., a full company of the 21st Native Infantry seems to have been posted at Basidu ; but in 1879, the health of this detachment having suffered severely from the climate, the garrison was reduced to a Havaldar^s guard, the remainder, namely a Native Officer, 7 non-commissioned officers^ and 62 sepoys, being transferred to J ashk. In 1880 the project of a removal from Basidu to Han jam was revived, but was again relinquished in consequence of the abandonment of Hanjam. as a British telegraph station. In 1883, Basidu being haunted by malarial fever, the military guard was removed altogether ; Assistant Surgeon Abdur Rahim, Khan Bahadur, who had held charge of it for 14 years, received promotion elsewhere; and the Coal Agent remained in sole possession. For reasons which are described in the appendix on the Telegraphs of the Persian Gulf, it was proposed in 1865 to establish a British telegraph cable station on the island of Hanjam; and in 1866 the question came under consideration in its political aspect. A change of ruler at Masqat in the beginning of the latter year, involving the termination of the lease of Bandar ^Abbas and its dependencies by Persia to the Sultan of ^Oman, but not without a possibility of its being renewed, increased the complexity of the situation ; for it was assumed at the outset, by the superior British authorities concerned, that Hanjam was one of dependencies of Bandar 'Abbas. W hat was at first proposed was, appai- ently, to obtain Hanjam island in exchange for Basidu and upon the same terms, thus concentrating the British establishments at the mou^ of the Persian Gulf in one place under the British flag; and Sir C. Ah^ the British representative at Tehran, thought that this migbt beiURf'- V 5 0 and | 2109 •ranged directly with the Sultan of ^Oman without reference to the Persian Government. The lease of Bandar ^Abbas in favour of the Sultan having lapsed however, the Government of India, on the assump tion that Hanjam had been included in the lease, considered that 1 negotiations in regard to the island could not properly be opened with | tbat potentate; and it was clearly impossible to make permanent I arrangements with the actual lessee of Bander 'Abbas, who was only a Shaikh farming the districts for one year from the Persian Government. In the circumstances, as they were understood, no alternative to broaching the subject to the ShaVs Ministers remained; and an application was accordingly made at Tehran, without raising the question of the proprietorship of the island, for permission to establish a British telegraph station on Hanjam. The application was successful; and, on the 29th 1 March 1868, permission was granted in writing by the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs under authority from the Shah, subject to certain ^ eoaditions as to the size and nature of the buildings to be erected and the strength and composition of the staff to be employed. In July 1868, after these arrangements had been concluded and the Persian ownerships of Hanjam in substance admitted. Colonel Pelly, the Resident in the Persian Gulf, who had not been informed of what was passing and who was at the moment engaged at Shiraz in negotiating for a renewal of the Bandar 'Abbas lease to the Sultan of 'Oman, suddenly reported that the Sultan claimed Hanjam as a part of his dominions quite independently of the Bandar 'Abbas lease, and was anxious to transfer it to the British Government, retaining for himself a right of free anchorage only. Colonel Pelly stated that the islands of Hanjam and Larak were not shown in a map of the Bandar 'Abbas territories leased to the Sultan in 1856 which the Persians themselves had recently exhibited, and that both were inhabited by Arabs owing allegiance to Masqat, while on Hanjam there was not a single Persian resident; and it was certain that, unlike Qishm and H or muz, neither island had been mentioned by name in the Perso-'Omani Treaty of 1856, or was mentioned in the new lease negotiated by Colonel Pelly. The informa tion, through no fault of Colonel Pelly's, really came too late to be of jljl use, though there was still some faint idea of meditation by the Gover- nor-Greneral of India between Persia and 'Oman in territorial questions : audit does not appear that the Government of India were convinced by te Resident's arguments that the Sultan possessed a valid title, not derived from Persia, to Hanjam or Larak. The British telegraph, station on Hanjam was maintained until 1880, w heu it was abolished as being no longer required. z'' 12110 MUZAFFAR-UD-DIN SHAH, FEOM 1896 * Before proceeding to consider events and questions belonging parti- cularly to the Persian Coast and Islands, we may take a rapid survey of the general internal and external history of Persia under Muzaffar-ud-Dia Shah, the son and successor of Nasir-ud-Din Shah. Internal affairs of Persia, 1896-1905. Muzaffar-ud- Din Shah's character. Government of the Amin- us-Sultan, 1896. Government of tlie Amin- nd-Dauleh, 1897-98. Muzaffar-ud-Din Shah, whose age at his accession to the throne of Persia was about forty-three years, possessed fair personal abilities; his natural disposition was easy-going, amiable, even kindly; but he was weak, timid, extravagant, and too indulgent of himself and of others, The head of the new Shah^s first Government was the Amin-us- Sultan, a very able but very unscrupulous Minister whom he inherited from his father, and whose influence, it will be remembered, had been powerful in the south of Persia and in the Persian Gulf during the latter part of Nasir-ud-Din Shah^s reign. On the accession of the new ruler a cabal was formed, or—if it already existed—became active, against the Amin-us-Sultan; and in November 1896 he was obliged to retire to Qum, whither the physician of the British Legation accompanied him as a protection against any act of violence similar to that by which the Amir Nizam lost his life in 185^. The Ministers adversaries were numerous and influential, perhaps the most prominent among them being the Farman-Farma, a great-grandson of Fatah-^Ali Shah and at once brother-in-law and son-in-law of the reigning sovereign. The place of the Amm-us-Sultan and his supporters was taken by a makeshift Ministry which maintained itself with difficulty until February 1897, when the Amin-ud-Dauleh was summoned from Tabriz to assume the direction of affairs and was soon appointed Sadr-i-A^zam with the Nasir-ul-Mulk as Minister of Finance. The chief business of the^ * Authorities for this period are nearly all official. Among those relating 0 Persian affairs as a whole are Persia and the Persian Gulf by Messrs. C. h. &amp; Russell and J. G. Lorimer (forming Volume IV of the official Summary of the principal Events and Measures of the Viceroyalty of Lord Curzon of Kedleston, Viceroy and Governor-General of India, in the Foreign Department, 1899-1905); and a Statement showing the Pronouncements as to Intention or Policy which haM been made hy responsible British Ministers, and the Assurances which have hccn ^ Great Britain hy the Persian Government, by Mr. S. M. Eraser, 1904. Local history is contained in Mr. J. A. Saldanha's Precis of the Affairs of the Persian Coast ^ Islands, 1854-1905, printed in 1906, and in the annual Administration of the Persian Gulf Residency, Of non-official publications Mr. V. Chirol's Eastern Qluestion^ 1903, is the most useful.2111 &gt;* Government was now, as will be shown by and by, to provide funds for ublio expenditure and for the personal requirements of the Shah, to whom a tour in Europe had been recommended by his medical advisers ; Qd in June 1898, having failed in this task, notwithstanding more or l es s serious efforts both to place the finances of the country on a better footing and to obtain a loan, the Amm-ud-Dauleh was compelled to resign office and retire to his private estates near Rasht. His administra tive programme, it may be observed, had been a reasonable and not unpractical one: it contemplated a separation of the revenue-spending from the revenue-collecting agencies of the State, an assessment de novo of the land tax, a reduction of the regular army, and the organisation of a properly disciplined gendarmerie, but, except an improvement of the petty currency of the country which he effected by the introduction of nickel coins, and a preliminary step which he took towards a reform of the Customs Department by the engagement of Belgian experts, his ideas remained virtually unexecuted. The Amin -ud-Dauleh was succeeded in the headship of the administra tion by the Mushir-ud-Dauleh, Minister for Foreign Affairs and President of the Cabinet; but this official proved unable to cope with the political situation and the pecuniary demands of his royal master, and his tenure of power was short. In August 1S98 the Amm -us-Sultan returned to power in his former capacity of Grand Vizier; and his principal opponents, including the Farman-Farma, the Qawwam-ud-Dauleh, the Nasir-ul-Mulk, the A ; la-ul-Mulk, and the Hakim-ul-Mulk, were removed to positions in ihich their political influence was greatly diminished. In the spring of 1900^ a Russian loan having in the meanwhile been obtained, Muzaffar- ud-Din Shah started on his long-anticipated European tour; and a Council of Ministers, presided over by H. R. H. Malik Mansur Mlrza, better known as the Shu'-as-Saltaneh, his second son, governed Persia in His absence. Contrexeville, Paris, and St. Petersburg were visited by His Persian Majesty; but a royal decease prevented this time the inclusion of Britain, Germany, or Italy in his programme. In 1902 the Shah made a second journey to Europe, in the course of which he visited England. In 1903 troubles of various kinds broke out at many places in Persia, and there was for a time an agitation against the Shah's Government which seemed to be partly instigated by the political rivals of the Amin- us-Sultan or Atabaig-i-A^zam, as he was now styled, and partly pro moted by the ecclesiastical authorities on patriotic grounds. Important ^ociof this jwim'-seditious movement were Karbalaand Najaf in Turkish Government of the Mushir-ud- Dauleh, 1898- Government of the Amln- us-Sultan, 1898-1903.2112 Iraq, in the chapter on the history of which province an account of the proceedings of the Persian Mujtahids at the Holy Cities will be found. The Persian masses, who before the Amm-ud-Dauleh's reform of the currency had suffered severely from depreciation, confusion, and specula tion in the copper coinage, and especially the inhabitants of the towns where dearness of animal food, unrelieved (in consequence of the opera tions of speculators) by the refnoral of taxes thereon, had at times reduced the poor to great straits, were seething with discontent. In these conditions, aggravated by the wasteful expenditure of the Shah and his Court, particularly in connection with His Majesty's European tours^ by the introduction of numerous Belgian officials into the Persian Customs Departmeut, by foreign loans, proposed or effected, and by a great revival of Babiism, it was not difficult for intriguers to excite actual violence; and the earlier part of 1903 was characterised by riots ; anti-foreign demonstrations, and massacres of Babis at more than one important centre. In September 1903 the sudden death in suspicious circumstances of the Hakim-ul-Mulk, one of the Atabaig -i -A ; zam's principal opponents, in conjuction doubtless with the seriously disordered state of the country, seemed to produce a mysterious revolution at the seat of power; and the Atabaig fell and was exiled from Persia. It seemed possible that his failure to satisfy all the demands of Russian diplomacy had contributed, also, to his displacement. A period of comparative quiet followed, during which the affairs of State were directed by H. R. H. the-'Ain-ud-Bauleh, a grandson of Fat-h 'Ali Shah, and doubly brother-in-law of the ruling monarch. The Shah was able, in 1905, to make a third journey to Europe, on which he visited Vienna and St. Petersburg ; but popular discontent in Persia was far from being allayed, and demands for representative Government had begun to make themselves heard. The employment on a considerable scale of Belgian Customs officials;— which, though exasperating to nationalist feeling now beginning to bud, had a beneficial effect on the revenues,—the gradual Europeanisation of the Customs administration, and the transfer of other departments of State business to the management of the Belgian Customs advisers are fully noticed in the Appendix on the Imperial Persian Customs. Mutual opposition of Britain and Russia in general matters in Persia, 1896-1905. Though the Anglo-Russian understanding in regard to maintenance of the independence and integrity of Persia, formed in 183i and renewed(it si) 2113 leilce ofti^ e0D ) Wall fffol litfi' thereafter from time to time, the last occasion being in 1888, still remained iu force, the course of Persian affairs during the period under consideration was dominated by antagonism between Britain and Russia in most questions of importance, whether general or local. On certain phases of this international conflict of interests it is now neces^ sary to enter, and we may examine first those which were general to the whole of Persia. In 1891 it was calculated that there was a surplus of public revenue over public expenditure in Persia amounting to about £100,000 annually and the country had then no debt. The economies of Nasir-ud-Din Shah, whose administration in the financial as in every other department was personal and autocratic, at one time aggregated, it was believed, about £4,000,000, but before the end of his reign this reserve fund had been greatly depleted, and at his death its amount probably did not exceed 30,000,000 francs. Liabilities, meanwhile, had begun to accu mulate. In 189^ a Persian loan had been floated in London through the (British) Imperial Bank of Persia for the purpose of paying an in demnity of £500,000 due to the (British) Imperial Tobacco Corporation on account of cancellation of their concession ; and in the course of the next few years £Z00,U00 had been borrowed by the Persian Government from the Imperial Bank of Persia. By 1898 the public debt of Persia, including an unpaid balance of the British loan of 1892, had risen to about £1,000,000, yet the pay of the army and the salaries of civil officials were in arrear. Early in 1898 British financiers were willing to lend £1,250,000 to Persia at 5 per cent., the loan to be issued at 82-, on the security of the customs of Pars and the Persian Gulf, subject to a proviso that their agents should be placed in charge of the customs houses of which the revenues were assigned to them. Their proposals were accepted in principle by the Amm-ud-Dauleh, the Persian Prime Minister of the day ; an advance of £50,000 was paid in March 1898 ; and the customs houses of Bushehr and Kirmanshah were handed over to the management of the Imperial Bank of Persia. Opposition to the ransfer of the customs houses arose, however, with the result that it was abandoned; and, on the supersession of the Amm-ud-Dauleh by the Mushir-ud-Dauleh, it was discovered that the financial requirements of Persian Government were about double what had been supposed. hereupon the negotiations with the British group fell through. l ^ 10 P osa is for a joint Anglo-Russian loan to Persia were then made y ie British to the Russian Government and appeared to be favourably Pertained ; but in January 1900 it was suddenly announced that an 143 State of the Persian finances and British loans to Persia, 1898. Russian loan to Persia, 1900.2114 Refusal of a British loan by Persia. 1901, Further Russian loans to Persia, 1902-03. on exclusively Russian loan had been accepted by the Persian Government through the Banque des Pr^ts de Perse, a branch of the Russian State bank. The nominal amount of the loan was about 400,000, with issue of bonds at 85; the rate of interest was 5 per cent, guaranteed by the Russian Government; and the security — which was liable sation by direct control in case of default of payment only — of the customs revenues of Persia except those of Fars and the Persian Gulf Ports, The balance of the British loan of 1892 and most other outstanding liabilities were paid off from the proceeds of this loan, one condition of which was that Persia should not^ without the consent of the Russian Government, raise any money in foreign markets before 1910. The control thus established by Russia over the fiscal affairs of Persia appeared to be absolute. In the following year, the Shah having returned from his first European tour and the Persian exchequer being again empty, the British Government were approached by the Atabaig-i-A^zam with a view to a loan. The Government of India were willing to provide £500,1 certain conditions, and an offer based on their suggestions was to the Persian Government, but was in the end rejected by them, chiefly perhaps from a fear on their part that the receipt of British money through the medium of the Imperial Bank of Persia, might be r by Russia as an infringement of the conditions of the Russian loan of 1900. In 1902, the Shah having resolved on a second trip to Europe and the financial difficulties of Persia having become more acute, in January and March advances aggregating about £300,000 and in April a loan of approximately £1,000,000 were accepted by the Persian Govern ment from the Russian Bank. This additional accommodation cost Persia dear, and the conditions on which it was granted affected British interests unfavourably. Among the advantages which Russia secur were a renewal for ten years of the Russo-Persian agreement in res rai of railway construction in Persia, an extension of the period of Pc lsia11 financial tutelage to Russia by two years (from 1910 to 1912); and a undertaking by Persia that changes then contemplated in the Pe^ 11 even The of Customs tariff should be settled between Russia and Persia alone, security for this new loan included not only the existing customs Persia generally (excluding Pars and the Persian Gulf Ports), du the revenues of such customs posts as might afterwards be estab i ' the posts in question being evidently some which it was intend create on the frontier of Baluchistan.2115 * Goi gy 1903 the indebtedness of Persia to Russia amounted; in round ^ figures to nearly £4;000,000, of which it was estimated that at least half represented sums swallowed up by the Shah 's Civil List. a3 Weln . „ again made overtures to the British Legation at Tehran. 1903-04. \\ ^ianfeiJi , r yfaiQ the Government of Persia, their financial difficulties still i oau __ , , 1 -p • m i - ® ersia, rfjje Government of India were prepared to lend any sum not exceeding Ud^J contmmng t; S ail( | ,i j The Govei ^ 6 11 000,000 upon suitable conditions j and it was suggested that the l s J ^ transaction might take the form of the purchase of a monopoly of road S 0 1 and railway construction and other commercial enterprises in Sistan and 0Ut ^ cot; Eastern, Southern, and South-Western Persia; but it proved impossible to obtain such terms. In the end, an advance of £200,000 was made to Persia on the 4th April 1903, and a supplementary advance of £100,000 on the 1st September 1904, through the Imperial Bank of irned fronit Persia. It was arranged that these advances should be treated as one q empty,tlJ loan, bearing interest at 5 per cent., repayable in 20 annual instalments, ;am within and secured on the Caspian Sea Fishery dues, the Post and Telegraph tfovideiii revenue of Persia, and the customs of Pars and the Persian Gulf.

It was of essential importance to the British be period ^ over nment that no sort of lien on or control over the Customs of 9l0to Wli® ou ^ ern Persia should be acquired by Kussia, and that, if those Customs lated in ^ n ^ ere con ie under foreign management at all, it should be British d Persia^ 1 maila g e ment; also that Eussia should not obtain such power over the existing®^ COllQl:nerc i a l policy of Persia as would enable her to manipulate the GulfPo^n ^ er ^ an ^ us toms tariff, to an indefinite extent, to the advantage of her vards 1)6^' 0Wn ^ ra de and the injury of British interests. These desiderata of British it was \m S a ve rise to developments which are fully described in the Appendix on the Imperial Persian Customs. Among the most important 148 a 3re acute, in J'J Questions of railway con struction in Persia, 2899-1904. Questions road con struction in Persia, 1899-1905. of 2116 were a specific assurance obtained from the Persian Government in 1897 ; a temporary transfer of the Bushehr Custom House in 1898 to the Imperial Bank of Persia; the exclusion of Hussia, by a process completed by stages between 1892 and 1904, from all connection with the customs of Southern Persia, or at least of Fars and the ports of the Persian Gulf the latter term including Muhammareh, Jashk, Chahbar and Gwatar; and the frustration, in 190 2, of an attempt by Russia to deprive Britain of a voice in the modification of rates under the Persian Customs tariff. The contest between Russia and Britain in regard to railway con struction, definitely initiated in 1889, continued without relaxation during the period now under review. In December 1899 the Russo-Persian agreement interdicting the construction of railways in Persia was renewed for ten years; neverthe less, as described in another place, a Russian Technical Commission in 1900 overran Persia and carried preliminary railway reconnaissances southwards from Tehran and Isfahan to Muhammareh, Bnshehr, Bander Abbas, and even Chahbar. By 1899 the railway system of the Russian Empire had been extended to Qars ; and in 1904 a Russian line reached Julfah on the Russo-Persian frontier. The grant of preferential rights to Britain in 1889 with reference to the construction of railways in the south of Persia was admitted by the Shah in 1900, and was recognised by His Majesty as still binding. A slight extension of the railway system of British India from Quetta in the direction of Persia was completed in 1905. Competition between Russia and Britain in regard to the construction of roads was not so acute as in regard to that of railways, the interests of the two powers lying, in this matter, in different territorial spheres. In 1899 a Russian road had been carried from Ashkabad on the Trans-Caspian Railway to Mashhad, and another from the port of Enzeli on the Caspian by Qazvin to Tehran was nearing completion. I 11 1902, as part consideration for the loan made by Russia to Persia in that year, a concession was given for a Russian road from Julfah to Qazvin with a branch from Qazvin to Hamadan. By 1905 all the roads men tioned were open for traffic, and on some of them a motor service had been introduced. Qazvin, and consequently the Persian capital not to mention Hamadan, had been made easily accessible from the Russian rail-head at Julfah, and from Enzeli, where improvements of the harbour had been taken in hand by Russia. On the British side the execution of the Imperial Bank of P# sia ' s concession of 1890 made slow progress ; but by 1899 the road con- 5L M ' H K U 'i SI2117 % lt: ^ cte( j UI1( jer it hadreached Qum and carriages were being- run by the Bank though it was unmetalled^ as far as that place. By 1903 it Ion' fn Sultanabad. Meanwhile a road from Ahwaz to Isfahan Qpt/ll had been made by the British firm of Messrs. Lynch, acting as the ents of the Bakhtiyari Chiefs, who, as described in the chapter on the history o£ 'Arabistan, had obtained a concession ; and at the beginning N- 0 f 1900 it was brought into use. In 1904 a British corporation was J formed, under the title of the Persian Transport Company, to take over 'tailw aa( i WO ik not only the Imperial Bank of Persia's road concession, but ijfijJ a | so ty interests possessed by Messrs. Lynch in the navigation of tie Kaiun river and in the Bakhtiyari road between Ahwaz to Isfahan. The new Company was assigned a subsidy of £2,000 a year for ten years, of which half was to be contributed by His Majesty's Government and half by the Government of India. Measures were next taken to extend the Tehran-Sultanabad road southwards through Loristan to Ahwaz ; but, as related in the chapter on 'Arabistan affairs, political obstacles of a local character declared themselves, and the enterprise was perforce abandoned for the time being. In 1905 the possibility and desirability of obtaining a concession for the construc tion by British agency of a road from Bandar 'Abbas to Bam, with extensions towards Isfahan and Sistan, were discussed. There was also rivalry between Britain and Russia in Persia with Qne^ons o£ regard to the construction and working of lines of telegraph on behalf of the Persian Government. The first move in this contest was made on the British side ; and in the Appendix on the Telegraphs of the Persian Gulf an account will be found of how, under a Convention signed in 1901, a Central Persian land line of telegraph was constructed by the Indo-European Telegraph Department from Kashan by Yazd and Kirman to a point on the frontier of Baluchistan where it joined the British Indian system. This new line was the property of the Persian Government; but it was arranged that it should be held on lease by the Indo-European Telegraph Depart ment until 1925, or during such shorter period as the British Govern- ment might desire. The Russian Government on their part, in connection with the Enssian loan to Persia in 1900, obtained a promise that they would be given permission to carry a telegraph from Mashhad to Sistan. ^bis line was not taken in hand until 1903, but once begun it was quic^ y completed. A pretence was made of its being a purely Persian enterprise, but was ill-sustained. About April 1903 a secret agreement was telegraph construction in Persia, 1901-190S.2118 concluded between Russia and Persia whereby the former power obtained a right to employ two engineers and three signallers on the Masliliad- Sistan line; and to link the telegraphs of Persia with those of Trans- Caspia. By 1905 the number of Russian signallers on the Mashliad- Sistan line had risen to thirteen^ and the Russian technical staff had, with the consent of the Shah^ virtually taken it under their charge. The British Government did not fail to protest against the Eussification of this line^ and their opposition was so far successful that a few Britisli signallers were placed on it, at Birjand, Turbat-i-Haidari, etc. Mutual opposition of Britain and Russia in local matters in Persia, 1896-1905. Bussian and French acti- rity in the Persian Gulf and Britisli counterac tive raeasures, 1895-190?. Russian activity in Eastern TV e pass now to manifestations and consequences of Anglo- rivalry in Persia which were more local in their character than those considered above. A field in which Russia displayed an almost feverish activity, and in which France also made a transient appearance at her side, was that of the Persian Gulf. The Russian and French proceedings in that quarter during the decade ending in 1905, together with the counter active measures adopted there by Britain ; are fully described in the chapter on the general history of the Gulf, to which it will be convenient at this u point to refer. They were among the. most important of all the developments of the period. It may be added here that, outside the region of the Persian Gulf proper, steps were taken to strengthen the British political position i 11 the Gulf, by the establishment in January 1903 of a permanent Britisli Consulate at Kirman, under an officer of the Indian Political Depart ment, but at the joint expense of His Majesty^s Government and of the Government of India, in place of makeshift arrangements which tad existed since 1893 j by the institution of a British Consulate at Shnaz^ in November 1903, under a member of the Levant Consular Service i 11 substitution for the previously existing Native Agency; and by appointment of a Native Agent of the British Government at Bamp^ in 1901. The official last mentioned, however, in deference to objections, was shortly removed to Kirman and remained there unti 1904, when he was stationed at Bam. In 1889 a Rusian Consul-General had been appointed at M as ^ and a British Consul-General, to whose staff a Military Attach 62119 awards added, had immediately been sent there to eonnter- balance the effect of the appointment. Russia, however, did not fail to acquire a commanding position, both political and commercial, in Khurasan, where the proximity of the Trans-Caspian Railway and the Russian garrisons in Central Arabia, assisted by a lavish expenditure of money, gave her great advantages. Nor was her attitude an expect- antor indolent one; Russian consular officials, news-agents, surveyors, aid emissaries of all sorts quickly pervaded the districts of Eastern Persia southwards, penetrating, as we shall see later, even to Sistan. In 1897, bubonic plague having become prevalent in India, the Russian political authorities took advantage of the circumstance to assert their power in Khurasan by establishing a quarantine cordon on Persian soil which barred access to Mashhad from Afghanistan on the east and from Sistan on the south. No cases of plague had occurred in Afghanis tan or Baluchistan, and the faison d'etre of the cordon was clearly poli tical rather than prophylactic, especially as it remained unwithdrawn after signature of the Venice Sanitary Convention of 1897, which con demned land quarantines in principle. The principal results of the cordon were to divert Afghan trade from Persian to Russian territory and to check the growtb of nascent commercial intercourse between Chietta and Mashhad via Sistan. The cordon was in charge of Russian fc willlecoa® doctors, whose authority was supported by a force of over 100 Russian iportantcM Cossacks; and, though the latter were after a time replaced by Persian Cossacks, their officers remained and continued to take orders from the ik.fcW Russian Consul-General at Mashhad. Attempts to advance the politicalpo* Russian cordon further to the south were frustrated hy the despatch of permeitB medical officer from India to Sistan, of which mention will be m Polfel^ made in a later paragraph of this chapter. In 1903 His Majesty s erumeiit^ Government endeavoured, first through the Shah^s Ministers and after- ements # wards in direct communication with the Russian Government, to obtain )oDS#tf tk abolition ol the cordon, but without success. Accordingly, towaids onsularSrt the end of 1903, a British Consul with a British medical officer and an rency; ^' Man cavalry guard was located at Turbat-i-Haidari, which was the grpieiitft central point in the Russian quarantine line ; and British subjects and lerenceJc^ interests were by this means secured from improper interference. In an isolated case of cholera having occurred at Birjand, an attempt made by the Russian Consul at Nasratabad in Sistan to instUute a quarantine cordon between the two places, but it was foiled by British ^presentations at Tehran.2120 In 1903 Russia incited the Persian Government, wlio were them selves indifferent on the subject^ to protest against alleged Afghan eu- croachments on Persian territory in the district of Hashtadan; but in 1904, steps having been taken with the concurrence of the Amir of Afghanistan to bring the dispute under settlement by the good offices of the British Government, so completing a partial delimitation which had been affected in that quarter in a similar manner in 189 and Russia having moreover become involved in war with Japan in the Far East, Persia ceased to complain, and the status quo w Mi unaltered. ^glp' From 1894 the isolated Persian district of Sistan, which had in a Kussian con- „ , test for poli- g r 6at measure tallen out of notice since the adjustment of conflicting ence in^' 1&gt;ers i an ancl Afghan claims there by a British mediator (Colonel R J. Sistao, Goldsmid) in 187became the theatre of a very energetic contest for political influence between Britain and Russia. The strategic importance of Sistan to India was considered to be great, and it was therefore held necessary to prevent the extension to it of that Russian ascendency which already radiated from Mashhad over a great part of the province of Khurasan. In 1894^ when Colonel Yate visited Sistan, a Russian Native Agent had been installed there, while Britain was as yet unrepresented. In 1895-96 British missions from India delimited the frontiers between Baluchistan and Afghanistan and between Baluchistan and Persia, and their proceedings led to a fuller appreciation by the British authorities of the importance of Sistan and of the advisability of ex tending British effective control across Baluchistan to its confmes. I 11 1896 a British Political Officer was appointed to Chagai, midway between Quetta and the Persian frontier; Captain Webb -Ware, the first nominee, visited Sistan in the beginning of 1897 ; and the opening up of a trade route from Quetta by Robat to Nasratabad, the chief place in Sistan, running for 463 miles through inhospitable country within the Baluchistan border, was undertaken. Meanwhile repots were received of a Russian design to institute, as already described, precautions in Persia against the importation of bubonic plagu® ^ r0111 India; and, in order to forestall any extension of the apprehended Russian measures to Sistan, Major Brazier-Creagh, a medical officer, was deputed from India to the spot; but it was not found necessary that he should remain there long. In 1898 information reached the British representative at Hashha of the contemplated appointment of a Mr. Zeidler as Bubuian Vice*2121 Consul to Sistaxi; and, to meet this emergency, Major Sykes, then loved at Kirman, was directed to proceed to Sistan, where he arrived a^the beginning of 1899 and was duly recognised as the first British nsular representative. Major Sykes spent the summer at Birjand, returning in the autumn for a short time to Sistan, and thence to ^ p 0st ^ Kirman. No sooner had he left the district than it was announced, this time with truth, that a Russian officer was on his ^vay to establish a Vice-Consulate in Sistan. Mr. Miller, the officer in question, reached Nasratabad in February 1900 ; but the effect of his appearance was neutralised by the arrival there, a few weeks later, of Major Chenevix-Trench, who had been selected for the appointment of His Britannic Majesty^s Consul-General at Mashhad. Early in 1901 Major Trench was relieved by Captain Benn, who was designated and recognised as His Britannic Majesty's Consul in Sistan. With the location on the spot of a commissioned representative of either power, friction between Russia and Britain in local questions began ; and, the attention of the Persian Government having been thus forcibly drawn to the district, Belgian officials of the Persian Customs Department appeared on the scene in 1901, and were followed by a Persian Karguzar or Foreign Office Agent in 1902^. The local Persian Governor, the Hashmat-ul-Mulk, was thus superseded in two of his principal functions; and a complicated and uneasy situation arose. In 1901 difficulties between Persians and Afghans on the Sistan border became acute, not, it was alleged, without the fostering of the Russian Vice-Consul; and in the same year it was alleged that Russia had applied for the conveyance to herself, by one means or another, of control of the revenues of Sistan, possibly on purchase by Russian agents of lands which belonged to the Persian Crown, and were said to compose tlie greater part of the district, or of their produce. This rumour occa sioned energetic British representations at Tehran which resulted, at the end of the year, in a written assurance by the Persian Government that iihe internal revenues of Sistan would not be alienated to any foreign Gov ernment or its subjects. In 1903 and 1905 there were renewed rumours of a transfer of the Persian Crown lands in Sistan, or thier produce, to foreigners ; but diplomatic representations at the Persian capital frustrat ed the proceedings by which they were occasioned. In 1902 the status of Mr. Miller, the Russian representative in Sistan, was increased from that of Vice-Consul to that of Consul, and a corresponding change in the rank of the British representative followed. The Belgian Customs officials, probably in consequenee of the ascendency2122 of Eussian influence at Tehran^ behaved as strong partisans of Russia and neglected no opportunity of showing hostility to British interests. Their persecution of trade arriving by the new British caravan route from Quetta was as unremitting as it was severe; and in July 1902,the Persian postal administration in Sistan having been transferred to their management^ they substituted a service organised by the Russian Consul for one which the British Consul had instituted in the previou year between Robat ; Nasratabad, and Birjand, connecting with the Indian postal system at Robat; a protest at Tehran, however, secured the restoration of the service between Robat and Nasratabad to the former British employes. But by far the most important questions in Sistan were now those of the Perso-Afghan border and the rights of irrigation in the waters of the Halmand belonging to Persian and Afghan subjects respectively. These questions had been settled by Colonel Goldsmid in 1872; but physical changes on a large scale had revived them. In July 190^ the Persian Government; under the Anglo-Persian Treaty of Peace of 1857, claimed the good offices of the British Government for the adjustment of the new disputes; and their demand was at once acceded to. The object of the local Russian representative in exacerbating the frontier difficulty was undoubtedly to create a situation in which Russia might find opportunity to assert herself in Sistan; and desperate efforts were made by the Russian Government between July 190^ and March 1903 to obtain a share in the proceedings. The Russian argument was that the integrity of Persia, in respect of which there was an understanding between the Russian and the British Government, was in danger, and that Russia had consequently a joint interest in the question; but it was pertinently replied that Russia herself had, notwithstanding the common interest of the two J powers in the integrity of Persia, declined in 1888 to admit British participation in discussions concerning the frontier between Trans-Caspia and Khurasan. Successive Russian proposals for the introduction of a Russian arbitrator into the case, f or the association of a Russian delegate with the British Commissioner; and for the attachment of a Russian adviser to the Persian Commissioner were successfully resisted. The British Mission under Colonel (afterwards Sir A. H.) McMahon entered Sistan in March 1903 and remained there until May I 905, Many expedients were resorted to by the Russian Consul for incon veniencing the British Mission and preventing the success of thoir opcrfl tions; but, like the efforts of his Government to obtain a locus standi &amp; the matter, they ended in failure. In November 1903 Colonel MeMahon2123 ounced his decision in regard to the Perso-Afghan boundary, which had already been submitted to the Shah and approved by him; in March 1904 the award was accepted by the Amir of Afghanistan; and by the end of 1904 the new frontier had been demarcated on the ground. The British Commissioner's finding in regard to water rights was announced in April 1905; but at the end of that year it was still under considera tion by the Persian and Afghan Governments. Meanwhile, in August 1903, a Persian Passport Officer had been deputed to Sistan; and, under Russian instigation, his powers were exert ed to annoy British and Afghan subjects to the utmost possible extent. In the summer of 1903 Mr. Miller, by disseminating false reports, succeeded in provoking an anti-British agitation at Nasratabad, and in driving the British Indian traders there to take refuge in the British Consulate. But in this he had overstepped the bounds of prudence; Mr. Dobbs, his British colleague, was able to obtain the punishment of the rioters by the local Persian authority j and Mr. Miller was presently transferred to some other scene of activity. His brother. Dr. Miller, who had at one time figured as an unofficial adviser of the Yamin-i-Nizam, the Persian Frontier Commissioner, supplied his place for a few months after his departure, and was then himself withdrawn. Steps were taken by the British Government to secure the position of the Hashmat-ul- Mulk, Governor of Sistan by hereditary right and in virtue of recognition by the Persian Government, whose attitude had been generally not unfavourable to British interests, and whom Mr. Miller had for this reason denounced as a traitor to Persia; and, though in 1904 the Hashmat-ul-Mulk was summoned to Tehran, and compelled to obey the summons, there appeared in 1905 to be a fair prospect of his restoration to his Governorship. In the meantime, in December 1903, a branch of the Impeiial Bank of Persia had been opened at Nasratabad j and in 1905 the British Indian railway system had been extended to Nushki, 93 miles on the way from Quetta to Sistan, of which a lease had been obtained from the Khan of Kalat in 1899. There were also negotiations on foot at the end of the period for the connection of the Indian telegraph, which had reached the frontier station of Robat in 1904, with the Persian station atNasratabad by means of a line, 100 miles in length, to be constructed by British agency. It may be added that the establishment of a British frontier post at Eus~- Mirjawa in 1901 gave rise to protests on the part of Persia, founded ve f er - on a delimitation of the Perso-Baluch frontier in 1896, which the eucetothe2124 Persia Balu chistan Fron« tier, 1901- 1905. Bussian and British ac tivity in Central and Western Persia, 1897- 1905. Kussian Government in 1902 warmly supported. It was intended that the question of Mirjawa should be disposed of by Colonel McMahon, in co-operation with a Persian representative, on the conclusion of his mission to Sistan; but eventually this was found unnecessary, the British post having been removed to another site, and the Persian Government having undertaken to let supplies be furnished to it from certain villages in Persia. Eussian trade had by 1899 reached Isfahan, where in 1897 a Russian Consulate-General had been established, and the supremacy of British trade in Central Persia was threatened. At the beginning of 1904 a British Vice-Consulate under an officer of the Indian Political Depart ment was established at Kirmanshah and was shortly raised to the status of a Consulate to meet a change in the grade of the local Russian representative. In the summer of 1904, cholera having been in* troduced into Western Persia by travellers from Turkish ; Iraq, the Russian authorities in Persia proposed that the quarantine arrangements at Kirmanshah should be placed in the hands of one of their doctors; but this move was checkmated by the prompt despatch of a British Consular Surgeon to Kirmanshah, with whose help the local Customs officer was able to carry out the sanitary precautions considered necessary. Russian and British policy in Persia, 1896-1905. Such were the principal manifestations of activity by Russia m Persia and some of the measures taken by Britain for the protection of her interests in that country. In 1900, which was perhaps the most critical year of the period; it evident that Russia had proposed to herself two great objects for ultimate or even immediate attainment. The first of these was the establish ment of a Russian naval base in the Persian Gulf or the Gulf of ; Oman, to be connected by railway with the seats of Russian military power, the second was the political absorption of Sistan. Both projects were inimical to the interest of the British Empire in India, and the policy of Britain was to prevent the realisation of either. Different lines of action were suggested by various British authorities j and the whole Persian problem was twice officially examined in London—first by a Conferee 06 of representatives of the Admiralty and Foreign, India, and War Offi ceS! in November 1902, and again by the Committee of Imperial Defence m2125 March 1905. It is unnecessary here, however, to describe either the i, a es that had been propounded or the conclusions that were reached. SC The attitude of the British Government towards Russian designs on , 0 £ the Persian Gulf was clearly intimated in March 1900 to the p ers i a u Government, who were informed that ' the control of these orts by a foreign power might lead to a state of things which Her Majesty's Government, in the interests of the Indian Empire, would be bound to resist.' Similarly, with reference to Sistan, a communication was made to the Grand Vizier of Persia in July or August 1901, to the effect that u His Majesty's Government regard it as of the utmost importance tha-t Sistan should remain as heretofore under the exclusive control o£ Persia, and they could not tolerate or acquiesce in any project which would result in the alienation of its revenues to any other power, or the intrusion of any foreign authority there.' At the beginning of 1902, the British warning to Persia was repeated in more forcible terms. The British Minister at Tehran, Sir A. Hardinge, was instructed by Lord Lansdowne, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to explain that in Southern Persia Great Britain could not reasonably be expected to abandon a position obtained by many years of sustained effort; that she could not consent to the acquisition by Russia of a military or naval station in the Persian Gulf; and that, if at any time the Persian Government should make such a concession to Russia, it would be necessary for His Majesty^s Government to take such measuies in the Gulf as they might consider necessary for the protection of British interests. His Majesty^s Government, moreover, could not acquiesce in the grant to Russia of any preferential political rights or advantages, or of any commercial monopoly or exclusive privilege, in the southern or south-eastern districts of Persia, including Sistan. Finally, if, in disregard of British admonitions, the Persian Government were to encourage the advance of Russian political influence and intervention in those regions. His Majesty's Government would be obliged to recon sider their policy, and would regard themselves as justified in taking such measures as might appear to them best calculated to protect British interests, even though in the adoption of such measures it might no longer be possible to make the integrity and independence of Persia their first object as hitherto. This remonstrance elicited an autograph letter from the Shah to his Grand Vizier in February 190^ which was communicated to the British Legation, and which contained the follow ing passage : The Persian Government has never come, and will not come, to any understanding with any power against the British Government, and has never desired, and does not2126 now desire, to alienate any part of its territory, to the extent of a span, to anyone for the erection of fortifications against the English Government. The latter should not listen to false reports and become suspicious of Us, It should have full confidence in our good-will, and rest assured that we are doing our best to encourage British trade and will continue to do so in so far as such efforts of Ours do not affect the independ ence of Persia, in which case no foreign power has the right to expect this of Us. In the summer of the same year, the Shah being then in England, Lord Lansdowne took the opportunity to impress upon His Majesty at a private interview^ the cardinal points of British policy in Persia, stating that His Majesty's Government adhered to their oft repeated recogni- tion of the independence of Persia, but that they were specially con cerned in the southern part of Persia and in the Persian Gulf, and that they were determined, should occasion arise, to put forth their whole strength in order to prevent encroachment by foreign powers in those quarters. From the beginning of 190^ onwards, occasion was frequently taken to announce to Russia and to the world in general, through the medium of ministerial speeches in the British Parliament, the policy deliberately adopted by His Majesty's Government with refex^ence to Persia and, more particularly, the Persian Gulf. On the 22nd January 1902 Lord Cran- borne, Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, declared in the House of Commons : We are anxious for the integrity of Persia, but we are anxious far more for the balance of power ; and it would be impossible for us, whatever the cause, to abandon what we look upon as our rightful position in Persia. Especially is this true in regard to the Persian Gulf, as I had the honour to state to the House a few days ago. It is true not only of the Persian Gulf, but of the southern provinces of Persia, and those provinces which border on our Indian Empire. Our rights there, and our position of ascendancy, we cannot abandon. In the Gulf itself, as I ventured to state on the pre vious occasion, our ascendancy is not merely a question of theory ,but a question of fact. On the 5th May 1903 Lord Lansdowne, as Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, made a weighty and unmistakable pronouncement on the subject of British policy, which, relating as it did exclusively to the Persian Gulf, is quoted verbatim in the chapter on the general history of that region. After this official and final statement, the Russian Government were approached with reference to the possibility of a definite adjustment of the respective interests of Britain and Russia in Persia^ and a suggestion was thrown out that separate spheres of influence uiig^t be arranged ; but the Tsar^s Ministers were not at the time disposed to enter into negotiations on the subject. In February 1903 Muzaffar-ud-Din Shah was invested with tto Order of the Garter by the hand of Lord Downe, who, at the head o^ a British complimentary Mission, was deputed to Tehran or the purpose.2127 mk j December 1904 a special Persian Mission under Mirza Riza was received at St. Petersburg by His Majesty the Tsar. Khan Britis h official matters general to the whole of Persia, 1896-1905. Increased British activity in Persia resulted in increased expenditure^ the incidence of which became a question between the Imperial and Indian Governments, In 1899 the contribution of His Majesty's Goverament to the maintenance of the British establishments in Persia was £15,460, that of the Government of India £61,05^ per annum. A re -adjustment of these charges was desired by the Government of India, who suggested that either the whole expenditure of the two Governments in Persia should be thrown together and then divided between them in a fixed proportion, or each Government should undertake the expenses relating to a particular territorial sphere. The whole question was settled by the report of a Eoyal Commission appointed in 1897 to consider the question of Indian expenditure. Their recommendations, which were made in April and adopted in September 1900, were to the effect that the annual contribution of £7,000 from Indian revenues on account of the British Mission in Persia, which had been fixed in 1891, should be lowered to £2,000; and that future additions to the charges of the Mission and Consulates in Persia should be evenly divided between the Home and the Indian Treasuries, the two Governments agreeing not to create new establish ments or add to existing ones except by mutual consent. In 1899 an officer of the Indian Army was appointed to be Military Attache in His Britannic Majesty's Legation at Tehran, and to combine with his functions as such those of Oriental Secretary. But in 1901 this arrangements ceased, and, though an Indian officer still held the post of Military Attache, he was no longer charged with any political duties. During the period under review, chiefly in consequence of the supply % Russia of Cossack guards to her Consulates in Persia, a large increase was made in the number and strength of the British consular guards also, the additions consisting wholly of Indian cavalry. In 1899 the only British consular guards in the country were 56 Indian infantry a mounted escort of 9 sabres at Bushehr, besides 5 Indian cavalry at Division of expenditure in Persia between His Majesty's Government and the Gov ernment of India, 1899- 1900.

In 1904 additional Indian cavalry to tlie number of 127 sabres were distributed to 12 British Consulates in Persia, while the infantry guard and mounted escort at Bushehr and Indian infantry detachments at Jashk and Chahbar of 100 and 50 rifles respec tively, for the protection of the telegraph stations at those places remained unaffected. The introduction of the new cavalry guards was viewed with disfavour by the Persian Government. Administrative and internal affairs of the Persian Coast and Islands, 1896-1905. Administra tion of Fars, 1896-1905. 1897-1899. 1899-1901. Having taken a survey of the political conditions governing Persia generally during the period under consideration, we now turn to our proper subject,—the history of the Persian Coast and Islands, The administration of Fars, as that province included in 1905 the districts of Liravi, Shabankareh, JVIazara^i, Dashtistan, Tangistan, Dashti, Shibkuh, and liastak, situated on or adjacent to the shores of the Persian Gulf, and was at all times connected with the Persian Gulf, in other ways, may first be shortly noticed. In the spring of 1896 His Royal Highness the Rukn-ud -Dauleh, who had governed Pars since 1894, was confirmed in office; but in July, after the assassination of Nasir-ud-Din Shah, he was removed in favour of the Nazim-ud-Dauleh. The new Governor-General did not, however, assume charge of his post until October. In 1897 the Nazim-ud-Dauleh was succeeded by the Earman-Farma, a brother-in-law of the Shah, under whom the Gulf Ports, separated from Pars about ten years before, seem to have been at first placed; but they were withdrawn again from his authority in the following year. Supported by the Qavvam-ul-Mulk of Shiraz, whose influence over the nomadic tribes of the province was great, the Farman-Farma, himself an enlightened and well-educated man^ governed for a time with vigour and success; but difficulties at length arose between him and the Central Government; and in February 1899 he relinquished his appointment and retired temporarily to Karbala. The Farman-Farma was followed by the Nizam -ul-Mulk, who remained only one year and was succeeded, in 1900, by the Muaiyid-^' Dauleh.2129 In the spring of 1901 the Shu^-us-Sultaneh, the Shales second and 1901-1902. favourite son, was appointed Governor-General of Fars, arriving in April a t Shiraz; he ruled with a strong hand and maintained general security ; but he had the misfortune to quarrel with the Qavvam-ul- Mulk of Shiraz, who on his representations was removed to Tehran a l on g with his son the Baiglar-Baigi. In January 1902^ however, the Qavvam -iil-Mulk was allowed to return from the capital and entered on a course of intrigue, the outcome of which was that in March the Prince and his adversary were both summoned to the capital while the Governor -Generalship of Ears was conferred on the Asaf-ud-Dauleh. The administration of the Asaf-ud-Dauleh was popular, but weak; 1902-1903. the unruly tribes of the province made head ; and the highways became unsafe, meanwhile, in August 1902, the Qavvam-ul-Mulk was again permitted to return to Shiraz; but he had not been there two months when he was ordered to proceed on pilgrimage to Karbala ; later in the year, however, he was pardoned and came home. In the spring of 1903 the A^la-ud-Dauleh took up the reins of 1903-1904, government; when he appeared at Shiraz, in April, the Qavvam-ul- Mulk was found to be in his train ; but the new Governor^General at once gave proofs of independence and force of character. At the end of the year he proceeded to Bushehr, where it was intended that he should welcome Lord Curzon, the Viceroy and Governor-General of India, then on tour in the Persian Gulf; but circumstances deprived him, as related elsewhere, of the expected honour. In 1904, the A ; la-ud-Dauleh having been recalled to Tehran, Ears 1904-1905. remained without a Governor-General until the month of June, when His Royal Highness the Shu^-us-Sultaneh, who had held office in 1901- 1902, was reappointed to Shiraz. His administration, praiseworthy during first tenure of office, was this time execrable in every respect. In 1905 disorders broke out at Shiraz, where the Jewish community had for some time been mercilessly harried; and something approaching a general revolt of the people of Fars against his government, which was &lt;( unconscionably corrupt and unscrupulous/'' occurred and necessitated his removal. We at length reach the Persian Gulf proper, and may first of all Administra- note the manner in which the administration of the Gulf Ports, a divi- sion including the most important ports of the Persian Coast, as well as 1896-1905. all its islands, was conducted during the period. At its commencement the Governorship of the Gulf Ports was held ie^6. bj the Hisam-us-Sultaneh, whose rule was characterised by ec an utter 1442130 neglect o£ all the duties and obligations of his office' The financial responsibilities and advantages of the Governorship had been transferred before his arrival, to the mercantile combination which had ousted his predecessor^ the Qavvam-ul-Mnlk, from Bushehr 5 and the Hisam-us- Sultaneh was consequently deprived of all incentive to burden himself with public affairs. He allowed his power to be secretly usurped by others, and their exercise of it was attended by all the abuses and dis advantages commonly incident to covert and irresponsible authority. The Hisam-us-Sultaneh was also constantly at variance with the Central Government; and in December 1890 he informed the British Resident at Bushehr that he had resigned, and declined to transact business. 1896—1898. After this no fewer than nine persons succeeded one another in the Governorship of the Gulf Ports in the space of about fifteen months; these were the Iqtidar-us-Saltaneh, who was appointed in March 1897 and removed in September of the same year; the Amir-i-Panj, so called from his military rank, who died in Persian Makran; the Mujir-us-Sultaneh, a nephew of the Nizam-us-Saltaneh, whose appoint ment was cancelled almost as soon as notified ; the rtimad-us-Sultan or Baiglar-Baigi, representing his father the Qavvam-ul-Mulk, who arrived at Bushehr in November 1897 and resigned in February 1898; the Malik-ut-Tujjar of Bushehr, temporarily ; the I'mad-i-Nizam, a dependent of the Farman Farma and appointed by him, who assumed charge in March 1898 and, finally, the Sa ; id-us-Sultan (in JVlay 1898), the Muzaffar-i-Nizam, and the Mu^izz-ul-Mamalik, all nominated in rapid succession to one another by the Farman-Farma. The Gulf Ports were then taken from the Farman-Farma, to whom they had been assigned^ and conferred on the Mujir-us-Sultaneh, already mentioned, who continued in office the last Governor appointed by the Farman- Farma. 1898—1910. In September 1898, however, apparently in consequence of repre sentations by the British Government to whom the Mujir -us - Saltaneh was unacceptable as being a nephew of the * Nizam- 118 ' Saltaneh, a new appointment was made in the person of Mirza Ahmad Khan, better known as the Darya-Baigi, then commanding the Persian gunboat ' Persepolis ^ at Bushehr. The Darya-Baigi incurred local enmities; he quarrelled with the Mu'in-ut-Tujjar, by whom he was financed; charges of embezzlement were brought against him which he seemed unable to refute; and, with the formation of the Impena 1 Persian Customs, the appointment which he held ceased to be valuable. # See the chapter on the history of 'Arabistan, page 1763,(g) 2131 In April 1901 he resigned and proceeded to Tehran, not however before he had been presented by the British Government with a sword of honour for useful services in Makran and had received a decoration from the Russian Consul-General. The next Governor of the Gulf Ports was the Salar-i-Mu'azzam, a 1901—1003. nephew of the Nizam-us-Saltaneh, who was appointed in August 1901, hut did not reach Bushehr until December ; his acting representative, from September till December, was the Mu'izz-ul-Mamalik. The Salar-i- MVazzam restored order at Bushehr and in its neighbourhood, which had declined after the departure of the Darya-Baigi; but in the spring of 1903 he was recalled to Tehran. Pending the arrival from the capital of the Darya-Baigi, who had 1903—1905, made up his differences with the Mu^in-ut-Tujjar and was so enabled to purchase his re-appointment to Bushehr, the duties of Governor were satisfactorily carried on by the Karguzar, Mirza ^Ali Muhammad Khan, Muwaqir -ud-Dauleh. In 1905 the Darya Baigi was still Governor of the Gulf Ports; but it was remarked that he was the puppet of the Mu 'in-nt-Tujjar and that, though conciliatory and even cordial in his dealings with the British Residency, he had little real power under the existing regime and was seldom able to fulfil the promises of which he was prodigal. It may be mentioned that in 1903 four guns of position were brought to Bushehr, where a Persian artillery officer from Tehran also arrived; tration, but no immediate steps were taken to construct the works in which it 1905, was intended to mount them. Under the Government of the Gulf Ports there were during the period regular Deputy Governors at Lingeh and Bandar 5 Abb as, besides functionaries of a more local or tribal ehatacter at Qishm, Hormuz, and Minab, and in Shamil and BiyaMn. From 1900 onwards the administration of the Customs was an important matter in the Persian Coast and Islands, being carried on there as elsewhere in Persia, by Belgian Officials and on a European system ; a full account cf it will be found in the appendix on the Im perial Persian Customs. Here, however, may be mentioned a particular incident connected with ^he Customs which occurred in the Governorship of the Salar-i-Mu azzam. At the beginning of May 1902 the town of Bushehr swarmed with Tangistani and Dashti musketeers, about 1,000 in number, whom the Customs authorities had enlisted and assembled on their own authority 144) A2132 History at Busliehr, 4896—1905. History of Tangistan, 1896—1905. and at the middle of the month the Khan of Angali arrived at Shif witli an armed levy to join the gathering, The object of the preparations was studiously concealed ; but there was little doubt that coercion of tlie Khan of Eig, who was then resisting the establishment of a Customs post at his port^ was contemplated. In the end the tumultuary force was quietly disbanded without having been employed, operations having been prohibited at the last moment by the central Government, to whom the Salar-i-Mu^azzam had reported the matter. The history of particular places and districts follows. The winter rains of 1896-97 having failed there was in 1897 a great scarcity of grain at Bushehr and in its neighbourhood, and heavy importa tion of food stuffs from abroad took place, notably of rice from Burma. That the conditions at Bushehr did not amount to actual famine and that public relief did not seem to be immediately required were circumstances quoted by the British Resident as proving an increase of prosperity among the people since the great famine of 1870—72. The Resident obtained the sanction of Government, however, for the utilisation, in case of necessity, of a balance remaining in his charge of the famine relief fund of 1872. During the prevalence of scarcity there was considerable insecurity m and about Bushehr; and in 1897 the Persian soldiers of the garrison, who suffered from official neglect as well as from high prices, took sanctuary at the flagstaff of the British Residency and demanded their pay, which was five months in arrear, from the Persian authorities ; but the matter having been satisfactorily settled, they returned to duty. A timely fall of rain in March 1898, following a second failure of the usual winter rains, averted distress which must otherwise have been wide spread and severe. In 1905, owing partly to the dissatisfaction of the people of I 1 ais with the Shu'-us-Saltaneh^s government and partly, perhaps, to a lawless and anarchical spirit which was abroad among them, the Bushehr Shiraz road became disturbed and unsafe. The feud in Tangistan between the rival Chiefs Haidar Khan and Ah Khan, begun in 1879 or earlier, continued in the reign of Muzaffar-^ Din Shah. In the autumn of 1896 difficulty arose in connection the removal from ''Ali Khan^s jurisdiction of certain villages on the coast, which had been sanctioned ; and Persian troops, with guns f l0m the Persian gunboat ' Persepolis,^ were sent to help Haidar Khan 111 enforcing the measure and in collecting revenue. After a colhsi 011 between the opposing force?, an arrangement of some kind was effected,2133 but it profited the Persian authorities little. A month later, Haidar |[haii on being called upon to disgorge the amounts which he had been enabled to collect, merely presented a pistol at the head of the Governor of the Gulf Fort's representative, who thereupon returned, followed by the Persian troops and guns, to Bushehr. At the close of 1897 Haidar Khan was required to punish 'Ali Khaiij who had made default in his fiscal obligations to the Persian Government; and 'Ali Khan, not finding himself in a position to offer resistance, took sanctuary at the Imamzadeh shrine in the middle of the Bushehr Peninsula with a large number of followers. Numerous violent crimes, among them murders, took place at the beginning of 1898 in the surrounding villages and were attributed, probably with justice, to the refugee chief's dependents; and the situation at Bushehr, of which the Persian military garrison had been depleted by the despatch of 150 men to Persian Makran, began to give cause for serious anxiety. After a time, perhaps in consequence of orders issued by the Persian Government for a movement of troops from Shiraz, ^Ali Khan fled from the Imamzadeh and returned to Tangistan. The Persian force from Shiraz, which consisted of about 800 infantry and was commanded by the Sa'id-us-Sultan, an officer on the staff of the Farman Farma, then Governor General of Shiraz, presently invaded Tangistan on pretence of punishing the Tangistanis for the outrages com mitted by them near Bushehr. A field gun accompanied the expedition. The district was ravaged, and a few men were taken and executed ; but the guilt of these victims was doubtful, and it was stated that the real offenders had escaped scot-free. On the other hand, the expedition was believed to have been financially profitable to the Persian authorities; for some revenue had been realised, and ransoms had been extorted from such solvent individual as fell into the hands of the troops. At the conclu sion of the operations the Said-us-Sultan, who had been appointed Gover nor of the Gulf Ports, apparently recognised Haidar Khan as sole chief of Tangistan ; and 'Ali Khan, fearing the consequences, at first fled to a port further up the coast with the intention of embarking for Basrah. Shortly, however, seeing that no attempt was made to arrest him, he returned to his home in Tangistan. In 1900, offences which the Persian authorities ascribed to Tangis tanis having occurred on the Bushehr Peninsula, another Military expedition was ordered ; and at the end of September the Darya Baigi, Governor of the Gulf Ports, took the field with several hundred regular Persian infantry, 3 or 4 guns, and a large force of armed levies. A few2134 of the inhabitants of the district were killed, and some tribal forls and other property were destroyed ; but ''Ali Khan remained at large, and Haidar Khan was successful in evading the Persian force and in reaching the Bushehr Imamzadeh in their rear, where he placed himself in sanctuary. Trouble was renewed in 1903 by competition between two Tangistani Chiefs, Zair Khidar ^nd Zair Ghulam Ali, whose identity or connection— if any—with the former protagonists, Haidar Khan and ; Ali Khan, is not described. In May a reconciliation was effected between them; but presently Zair Ghulam ^Ali was killed by one of his rivals followers; and Zair Khidar was decoyed to Bushehr, and treacherously seized there, by the Governor of the Gulf Ports. Three of the Governors men and two Tangistanis were slain in a fracas attending the arrest. In October, under orders from the central Government, the Darya Baigi proceeded with 100 Tufangchis to the assistance of the Zabit of Dashti, who had been ordered to chastise the district of Tangistan ; and Zair Khidar, who seems in the meantime to have regained his freedom, sought safety in flight to a distance. The Darya Baigi, after looting and setting fire to the village of Ahmadi in Dashtistan, returned to Bushehr. In 1896 an attack was made on the port of Tahiri in Shibkiih by Shaikh Ibrahim, a Zabit of that place who had been expelled in the previous year ; but it was repulsed with loss to the assistants. It will be remembered that in 1887 Lingeh had been brought under direct Persian administration on removal of the hereditary Arab Zabit, Shaikh Qadhib, Qasimi ; and that the latter had been deported to Tehraui The Persian occupation of Lingeh remained undisturbed until 189^ when, on the 4th July, Muhammad-bin-Khalifah, a scion of the former ruling family, suddenly appeared on the scene, and in a forcible but ordeily manner, made himself master of the place. Early in 1899 the Persian authorities gave signs of an intention to repossess themselves of Lingeh ; and, when in February the Persian gunboat ' Persepolis ^ with the Darya Baigi on board left Bushehr in a southerly direction, H. M. S. a Pigeon ' was ordered to follow her and watch her movements. The Pigeon/' however, on the Darya Baigi assuring her commander that no attack would be made on Lingeh without previous notice to the British authorities, ceased to accompany the Persepolis and the Shaikh of Lingeh, after payi n ^ up the arrears of revenue which were due by him on account of the district, allowed himself to be lulled into a^false sense of security-2135 Suddenly; iu the early morning of the 2nd March, when the Shaikh had disbanded the greater part of a force that he had collected for purposes of defence, the Darya Baigi with 700 Persian troops entered the town by its western end ; and by day light he was in possession of all the quarters between it and the Shaikh/s fortified residence At the sound of firing H. M. S. ' Sphinx ^ hurried over from Basidu, where she happened to be lying, and found the ' Persepolis ^ engaged in bombarding the Shaikhs fort. Desultory firing continued during the dav and the following night ; and, on the morning of the 3rd March, the Shaikh abandoned his resistance and made good his escape to the open country. The Persians then took possession of his fort, hoisting the Persian flag on it_, and the Darya Baigi guaranteed the maintenance of order in the town. Throughout the operations British subjects were not intentionally molested by the combatants on either side ; but, during the progress of the fighting, some shops were looted in the eastern part of the town ; and the claims for compensation lodged by British subjects ultimately amounted to R63,500. On the Persian side only some 15 men were killed and 20 wounded, the Arab losses were also inconsiderable, and the only building damaged was the Shaikh's fort, shelled by the f&lt;r Persepolis.^ For about four months the ex-Shaikh lingered in tfle interior, in the neighbourhood of the village of Mirakun, and the Persians com plained of attacks by his followers on caravans and even on detachments of their troops ; but their statements were not free from exaggeration. Eventually he embarked at the small port of Bandar Mahtabi and betook himself to the Arabian side of the Gulf. In January 1900 the ex-Shaikh was found to be living in Trucial ; 0man under the protection of the Shaikh of Bas-al-K h aimah ; and the Persian Government immediately gave way to fears of a great Arab attack on Lingeh organised in the ports of Trueial ^Oman. The uiixon taken by the British Government on the Persian representations and an intrigue with the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi upon which the Darya Baigi entered, on his own account, for the purpose of averting the imagined danger are described in the chapter on the history of Trucial ^Oman. In August 1902 Saiyid Yusuf,who had been the ex-Shaikh ; s right- hand man in his Government of Lingeh, landed at Duvvan and succeed ed in destroying a large consignment of dates, the property of the Persian Government on its way from Lingeh to the interior. He was unable, however, to maintain himself on the Persian coast and shortly sailed for Qatar, his master being then at Ras-al-Khaimah.

About the end of July 1903 the ex-Shaikh landed once more on Persian soil, with only a dozen followers, and established himself iu the hills behind Lingeh. His tone was now that of a suppliant; and from his retreat he wrote to the Governor of the Gulf Ports asking leave to settle and lead a quiet life in Lingeh district. At the same time he invoked, through the Residency Agent at Lingeh, the good offices of the British Government. A safe-conduct for visiting Bushehr was offered him, but he did not avail himself of it; consequently, as a precaution, some Persian troops were sent to Lingeh under the Mujir-us Saltaneh, brother of the Salar-i-Mu^azzam, lately Governor of the Gulf Ports. At the end of November 1903 Muhammad-bin -Khalifah returned to the Arabian side. Arrived there, he resided by turns at Ras-al-Khaimah, Sharjah and Dibai, and in Qatar : he was, in 1905, a man of quiet and respectable appearance about 35 years of age. The chief supporter of his cause, Saiyid Yxisuf, who was connected by marriage with the Qawasim, settled at Dibai and there engaged in trade in pearls and rice. On the 9th June 1912 and following days severe shocks of earthquake were experienced at Bandar 'Abbas. In that and the following year the roads in the neighbourhood of the town were very unsafe, and raids were committed in the district by gangs of Baharlus and Bashakardis. Excitement and unrest continued in 1903-04; for some weeks caravan traffic was altogether suspended ; and it was feared that the town itself might be attacked. The only cause assigned for these disorders was the prevalence of alarming rumours concerning the health of the Shah. On the 11th January 1897 a terrible earthquake laid almost the whole town of Qishm in ruins and occasioned much loss of life. Qishm also suffered from the series of earthquakes which affected Bandai Abbas in June 1902, but not so severely as on the former occasion. 1900 the Zabit of Qishm was changed, one Shaikh 'Abdullah being substituted for Shaikh Hasan. In May and June 1902 considerable annoyance was caused in y iucursions of Bashakardis. In 1905 disorders were caused in ShanA!2a : Hi A 2137 i o-^i ii flismissed Kalantar of the District: and in the same year the Biyaban, by ^ _ ... 1896—1905. Deputy -Governorship of Biyaban was disputed between Mir Haji-bin- Husain aad Mir Barkat-bin-^Abdun Nabi, the former of whom was at tirst in possession. In October 1905 Mir Barkat, having visited the Governor of the Gulf Ports at Bushehr^ procured the dismissal of Mir Haji, whom he had temporarily ousted, in his own favour; but Mir Haji at once appealed to the Persian Deputy-Governor of Bandar ^Abbas, who was the Darya Baigi^s brother, and obtained his countenance. The two kinsmen were then left to fight the matter out between themselves. Mir Hajij when in charge of the district, had his seat at Sirik, Mir Barkat at Namurdi. The family to which both Mirs belonged was that which governed the adjoining district of Jashk in Persian Makran. Eelations of Persia with other local powers, 1896—1^05. Various cases in which the Arabs of Trucial ''Oman were immediately and the British Government indirectly interested arose on the Persian Coast and Islands during the period Under review. In 1898 division was made among her heirs of the moveable property of one Maryam, daughter of Muhammad Ghaith, Qasimi, who was wife at the time of her death of ; Abdul Qadir, a resident of Lingeh ; but some date gardens which she left were kept as joint property by her husband and by Salim, Ahmad, and Nasir, sons of Sultan, who were also among her heirs and who were subjects of the Shaikh of Sharjah. The date gardens continued in the possession of ^Abdul Qadir until the recapture of Lingeh by the Persians in 1899, when he was put to death the Darya Baigi on the charge of having been a confederate of Shaikh Muhammadrbin-Khalifah. The date gardens, apparently on the assumption that they belonged exclusively to ^Abdul Qadir, were at the same time confiscated by the Governor of the Gulf Ports; and subse^ quently they were sold to the Mu^in-ut-Tujjar of Bushehr, whose influ ence was then second to none in Southern Persia. A claim for the shares to which they were entitled was lodged by the Sharjah heirs, and was supported by the British Political authorities as representing, in his foreign relations, the Shaikh of Sharjah; but up to the end of 1905 it had not been admitted or satisfied. In the summer of 1902 four Sudan boat-owners, subjects of Abu Dhabi, were murdered on the pearl banks on the Arabian side of the Gulf Civirdainl of Sharjatb ubjects at Lingeb, 1899—1905. Murder of Abu Dhabi subjects by2138 natives of Tavuneh, 1902. Questiou of the inter national status of Tunb and Bu Musa Islands, 1904. Question of the international status of Sirri Island, 1904. by three men of Tavuneh, a vilkge on the coast of the Persian district of Shibkuh, whom they had engaged as a crew. The boat itself and the whole seasons take of pearls were carried off by the murderers. Tlie Shaikh of Abu Dhabi claimed, on behalf of the heirs of the victims, 6 3 000 Tumans as blood-money and general compensation ; and he pressed in addition for the punishment of the offenders. Four persons were subse quently arrested by the Persian authorities, but one of them was allowed to escape ; the proceedings dragged ; and notwithstanding the best efforts of the British Political Resident and strong feeling aroused at Abu Dhabi by the procrastination of the Persian Government, the case was still unsettled in 1905. In the chapter on the history of Trucial ^Oman it is mentioned tbat the islands of Tunb and Bu Musa, belonging to the Arab principality of Sharjah, were in 19043 unceremoniously occupied by the Persian Govern ment through their Customs Department; but that the Persian occupa tion Was discontinued, before it had lasted three months, in consequence of British diplomatic representations at Tehran. There was reason to believe that the action taken by the Persian Government had been prompt ed by the Russian Legation at Tehran, who, in view of a tour made by Lord Curzon, Viceroy and Governor General of India ; in the Persian Gulf at the end of 1903, were apprehensive of measures on the part of His Britannic Majesty's Government for the consolidation of their position in that quarter, possibly by the occupation of fixed points. When the Persian Government consented to remove their flag from Tunb and Bu Musa, it was promised that an opportunity would be given them of discussing the status of those islands with the British Government, but no serious arguments in proof of the ownership by Persia were produced, and the discussion lapsed. It will be remembered that in 1887, on the institution of direct Persian Government at Lingeh, possession was taken by the Persian authorities of the island of Sirri; and that, though a protest was entere by His Britannic Majesty^s Minister at Tehran on behalf of the al | of Sharjah, the Persian occupation was permitted to continue In 1904, when the dispute regarding Tunb and Bu Musa occurred, there wer Persian employes on Sirri, a Persian flagstaff existed there, all&lt; ^ ^ Persian flag was periodically hoisted. The history of Sirri before had been very similar to that of Tunb and Bu Musa, and the fact utilised to deter the Persian Government from urging their clainas to other two islands, it being intimated to them than, if they persis ted, the claim of the Shaikh of Sharjah to Sirri might be revived and supp 01 ted(&lt;202 2139 '^4. the British Government. The Belgian Minister of Persian Customs, M. Naus, on the status of Sirri being explained to him by Sir A Hardinge, the British representative at Tehran, agreed to strike out of a list of Persian Customs posts which was then being • but he requested that no objection might be raised to the retention of some Persian Customs guards who had been located on the island to prevent smuggling to the mainland; and the question of Sirri was not further pressed bv the British authorities. Sirri British political relations with the Persian Coast and Islands, 1896—1905. persist Some political incidents affecting the British Government or their subjects occurred on the Persian Coast and Islands during the reign of Muzaffar -ud-Din Shah and are mentioned below. In January 1897 a mob of several hundred men, a number of whom carried firearms, proceeded from Bushehr to the British t elegraph station at Rishehr, five miles destant, and destroyed some bench-marks which had recently been placed near the main telegraph bailding in connection with British observations of longitude, also a British marine tide gauge close by. Their violent proceedings were accompanied by threats of death to any who might venture to interfere, and no opposi tion was offered by the telegraph staff. The riot was instigated by certain Saiyids of Bushehr, in accordance with a popular superstition that the obnoxious marks and gauge caused a deficiency of rain in the country. The affair did not take place without some premonitary symptoms, but these had been ignored by the Governor for the time being of the Gulf Ports, and that official showed no disposition to afford redress for the outrage after it had occurred. A certain number of ignorant villagers were arrested and punished; but the Saiyid instiga tors were not called to account, and it was only after the departure of the Hisam-us-Saltaneh from Bushehr that the damaged scientific apparatus could be replaced. In March 1898, when the Tangistani Chief 'Ali Khan and a number of his followers were in sanctuary at the Imamzadeh on the Bushehr peninsula, the house of one Mahmud, a Persian subject employed as a Jamadar by the Indo-European Telegraph Department, was attacked and looted, and two of his relatives were killed, 'Ali Khan himself owned Mob outrage at Rishelir telegraph station, 1897. Outrage on a British protege at Rishelir, 1898.2140 mr land in the vicinity^ and a dispute regarding an irrigation channel between him and the family of the Jamadar seemed to be the cause of the outrage. In view of this case^ and of the general lawlessness of the Tangistani horde, fears began to be entertained of an attack on the Rishehr telegraph station, or upor Europeans in general. A party of blue jackets was consequently landed from a British man-of-war as a guard, pending the arrival from Bombay of a reinforcement of ^5 rifles whicli it had been decided to add to the Residency guard. After the conclusion of the Persian expedition into Tangistan, already described, which resulted from this and other misdeeds by ^Ali Khan^s followers, that chief, having returned to his home, began to Write letters to Mahmud and to the British Resident asserting his innocence and asking that he might be exonerated of blame in the case of the Jamadar's house. He threatened, if proceedings against him were continued, to take sanctuary with the complainant, Mahmud; and under Persian custom, had he done so, it would have been impossible to take steps against him so long as he remained. Finally ''Ali Khan proposed to surrender to the British Resident, on condition that he should receive a fair trial and should not in any circumstances be handed over to the Persian authorities; and his offer was accepted by Captain Prideaux, the Assistant Resident, in the absence of the Resident, Colonel Meade, at Shiraz. From the investigations which followed it seemed clear that.the chief was not really guiltless, and he was accordingly called on to pay 4,000 Tumans as compensation to the sufferers by the crime. This he was not unwilling to do, provided an undertaking were obtained that the Persian Government would not molest him afterwards; Residency were unable to procure the desired assurance from the Persian authorities. Accordingly, as he had come in on a safe-conduct, firing on the Resident's country house at Sabzabad, 1900. 0 ^ . on Khan was allowed to leave the Residency, where he had been living ^ 01 six months, and the claim against him was preferred to the Persian Government instead of himself; but the result, if there was any, is n0 ^ recorded. In June 1900 a relative of a Persian employed in the British telegrap^ office at Rishehr was murdered. Again on the night of the 30th Aug^ a number of shots were fired from a short distance into the grounds o the British Residents country hoUse at Sabzabad. Several bullets stritf the buildings, and a horse belonging to the Resident's escort was i ^ This demonsttation was not attributable to anv resentment agaius * rl bV British Residency; it seemed rather to have been organised .r Nazim-ut-Tujjar, between whose uncle, the all-powerful Mum-ut- ujj Hi \\2141 as jsj; ^ rfcjj ll 'hJ escrfcl, J s MowJ «rs to | J 'id aski^ baiar'slj tinned, fej nd the Darya Baigi, then governing the Gulf Ports, there was at the time a quarrel. The affair, however, was attributed by the local Persian authorities to Tangistanis; and an expedition into Tangistan, directed by the Darya Baigi, followed, which has already been described. Nazim -nt-Tujjar was also required, at the instance of the British Government, to quit Bushehr for a season. In 1903 a deputation from the Muhammadan College of Aligarh in India visited Persia to explain, from a Muslim standpoint, the advan tages of education at the institution which they represented. In Septem ber and October the deputation were at Shiraz, and, when later they returned to India, they took with them a few recruits for the College whom they had secured in Persia. At the end of 1903, as related in a special Appendix, Lord Curzon^ Viceroy and Governor General of India, made a cruise in the Persian Gulf, in the course of which he visited various places on the Persian Coast and was met at Bushehr by Sir A. Hardinge, His Britannic Majesty's Minister at Tehran, In January 1905 two natives of the disputed island of Sirri took violent possession at sea of a boat from Qishm, which they had joined at Sharjah in the guise of passengers. They murdered all on board except one boy, who was spared by them or otherwise escaped. The motive of the crime was robbery ; one of the victims was a Khojah, a British subject. The offenders having been captured by the Persian Deputy -Governor of Lingeh, the British Resident at Bushehr was instructed by His Britannic Majesty's Minister at Tehran to apply to the Governor of the Gulf Ports for their prompt and adequate punish ment, on the ground that, though the status of Sirri was contested, the criminals were actually on Persian soil and in Persian custody. One of the prisoners meanwhile succeeded in making his escape, but the other was eventually put to death by drowning. serious incident occurred at Lingeh in 1905, Laris and Girashisto the number of nearly 100 surrounding th3 house of the Native Agent of the British Government there in a threatening manner. Afterwards^ though they continued to surround the house, their demeanour was more quiet, and they alleged that they only wished to complain against the action of the Agent in a Hindu bankruptcy case, and had therefore taken sanctuary under the British flag which flew over his residence. The affair was engineered by a notorious mischief-maker, Haji Ali, Lari, who intimidated or cajoled the Persian Deputy-Governor into with the rioters.

Disturbances at the British Agency at Lingeh, 1905.2142 Majesty's Consul at Bandar 'Abbas followed; and eventually, after 17 days, the crowd were dispersed, the Deputy-Governor was deposed, and he and Haji 'AH were banished from Lingeh. This settlement and the manner in which it was enforced had a most satisfactory effect in restoring British prestige along the whole coast from Mu^am to Minab, where it had been somewhat impaired by the incident. Since 1892 a number of claims for compensation had arisen on the part of British subjects and persons entitled to British protection in Persia, and little or no progress had been made in disposing of them. Not having as yet been jointly examined by British and Persian officials,—an omission due to the apathy of the Persian Government in the matter,—the claims could not be considered as proved in their entirety; but many were undoubtedly well-founded, and a number related to losses sustained through failure of the Persian Government itself to maintain security and good order. When an account of out standing British and ^^m-British claims was made out, at the beginning of 1900, for the Persian Coast and Islands, ■'Arabistan, and Persian Makran, it was found that there were no less than 105 cases calling for joint investigation and settlement, and that some of them were as much as eight years old. The total of the compensation claimed in the whole of the cases was £27,597, and about two-thirds of this amount was referable to the Persian Coast and Islands, a considerable proportion of it representing losses alleged to have been suffered at Lingeh m consequence of the Persian operations there in 1899. Two urgent claims preferred by European firms were specially settled by the Persian Government, who paid £1,1B2 to Messrs. Sassoon and £11^ Messrs. Lynch ; but their treatment of the rest was dilatory. In April 1901 a Persian Commissioner from Tehran, the Hisam -ul Vazareh, arrived at Bushehr to investigate the pending claims m conjunction with the British Resident; but he had not been provide with powers sufficient to overcome the inertia or obstruction of Governor of the Gulf Ports and the local Karguzar ; and, thougli remained at Bushehr for a year, not even a partial settlement wa achieved through him. At the beginning of 1903 a new Karguzar, the Muhtashim n ^ Vazareh, was appointed to Bushehr for the ostensible purpose^ disposing of the claims in consultation with the Besident; but s there was no progress. At the end of 1905 the whole mass of claims was under i nves ^ gation by the British Besident, the Governor of the Gulf P 0 ^ the Karguzar, sitting as a committee.2X43 t; U 1 ... v commercial and general interests on the Persian Coast and Islands, 1896--1905. Certain matters which affected British commercial and general interests during the period deserve separate mention. Red oxide of iron had at one time been exported from the island of Hormuz by the Mu'm-nt-Tujjar, whose interests extended to the ings, whole of the Persian Coast, and even to ^Arabistan and the Karun river; but by 1897 his operations in that quarter had apparently ceased. In the year mentioned a concession for working the Hormuz oxide deposits was obtained by Messrs. A. and T. J. Malcolm, a native firm at Bushehr enjoying British protection, to whom a Farman in the usual form was issued. No sooner, however, did Messrs. Malcolm begin to exercise their rights than the Mu^in-ut-Tujjar protested and produced an earlier Farman granted during the reign of the last Shah. At his demand the Persian Government seized the Hormuz workings and transferred them to him, and Messrs. Malcolm had recourse to the British Legation at Tehran. Through the Legation it was arranged that the dispute should be settled by the Sadr-i-A'zam of the day, the Amin-ud-Dauleh, as arbitrator; and that, pending his decision, the Hormuz workings should be re-transferred to Messrs. Malcolm. This last condition was complied with ; and in January 1898 the Amin-ud-Dauleh announced his award, which was in favour of the Mu'in-ut-Tujjar, but which directed that all expenses incurred by Messrs. Malcolm at Tehran in obtaining their concession, or on Hormuz in turning it to account, should be re-imbursed to them. The workings were restored to the Mu'in-ut-Tujjar without delay ; and the question became, chiefly, one of recovering a sum equivalent to £1,960 which represented Messrs. Malcolm's expenditure at Tehran. Cheques drawn by the firm fortunately existed to prove the correctness of the amount claimed ; but to all demands for execution of the Sadr-i- A'zam^s award in respect of their indemnification the Persian Govern ment now turned a deaf ear. In 1905 the Mu'in-ut-Tujjar, on a visit to England, concluded a contract with the British firm of Messrs. Strick and Co., for the export of 8,000 tons of red oxide from the Hormuz deposits.

Abolition of Rahdari and other irregu lar charges, 1905, and ; whereas formerly it applied to grain only, it was extended in 1903 to sheep and goats, and eventually to other articles such as lamb-skins. Towards the end of 1905, with a view to preventing the imposition of embargoes by local authorities for corrupt purposes, it was suggested to the Persian Government by the British Minister at Tehran that no embargo should in future be allowed to become operative until it had been approved as necessary by the Minister of Customs. Rahdari (or road dues), Dallali (or brokerage), Qapandari (or weighment fees) and other irregular charges levied on foreign trade in the interior survived for a time the conclusion of the Anglo-Persian Trade Declaration of 1903, and even the promulgation of the Edglement Douanier of 1904, which are described in the Appendix on the Imperial Persian Customs. Daliki on the Bushehr-Shiraz road was a principal scene of these exactions, which were kept in force mainly through the influence of H. E. H. the Shu'-us-Saltaneh, Governor-General of Ears. Representations by the British and Russian Ministers, however, resulted in orders for the abolition of Rahdari with effect from the 5th October 1905. British official matters on the Persian Coast and 1896—1905. Consular status of certain members of tjie Busbehr Residency Staff, 1904-05. It remains to consider questions connected with British establishments on the Persian Coast and Islands, which, as indicated in a previous section, underwent a great expansion during the period. In 1904 it was suggested that consular rank should be bestow on certain members of the superior staff of the British Eesidency at Bushehr, and the suggestion was approved by Sir A. Harding, His Britannic Majesty^s Minister at Tehran, who thought that diplo# 1 ^ status even might be given them in order to increase the prestige of the Residency and to emphasise the fact that the functions oi the Resident and his staff were of a different nature from those o their foreign colleagues and more extensive in their territorial rang^. His Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs did not conside 1 that a sufficient case for the grant of diplomatic status was niad e out; but he accepted the suggestion that consular rank should e conferred, and the Government of India recommended that the r IU2145 ^ejm the iryiw'i eii n ^ no eulj ^ it Hi ^andii ^ 011 feeigii|. : 011 the Imp ,a( i wasapiiij e mainly tkJ ^ernor-Geiul Ministers, to* t effect froii st and ii .tiskstaWte ted in a pff 1.

At the end of 1904 a Vice-Consul of the Levant Consular Service ^a g attached to the Residency at Bushehr, as an aid to the Resident in commercial matters. In 1905 the Resident was supplied with a Second Assistant, but provisionally, the question of creating a Second Assistantship beino'then under consideration. The officer attached to Major Cox's staff in these circumstances was Lieutenant C. H.Gabriel, I. A., who W as shortly after received as a probationer into the Political Department of the Grovernment of India, and was succeeded by Lieutenant R. L. Birdwood, LA In 1904 it was arranged that on expiry of the contracts of service of the men serving in the Residents mounted escort, formed in 1863, their place should be taken by troopers of Indian cavalry, supplied in the same manner as the guards allotted to the British Consulates in Persia generally in that year t In accordance with a suggestion made by the Chief Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia in 1903, the Government of India Treasury at Bushehr was abolished with effect from the 1st April 1905 and the monetary transactions of the Residency transferred to the'local branch of the Bank. The object of this measure was to in crease the credit and prestige of the Imperial Bank of Persia, a British interest, and the charge was accompanied by a condition that no charge should be made bv the Bank except for actual expenditure in packings insuring, and forwarding specie. In May 1905 telephonic communication was established between the British Residency building in Bushehr town and the Residents country house at Sabzabad, distant from it six miles. The Persian Government had consented in 1891 to the erection of a telegraph between the two, and it was not considered necessary to consult them in regard to the substitution of a telephone for the telegraph which bad not been erected. It having been decided that a British Consulate should be established at Shiraz in place of the Native Agency hitherto maintained, Mr. G. Grahame of the Levant Consular Service was nominated to the post in % 1903 and assumed charge of his duties in November of the same year. Although the new Consulate was placed under the superintend- ^ceofthe British Legation at Tehran and not of the Bushehr Residency, it was arranged that the new appointment should not interfere with 145 Bushehr Residency mo anted escort, 1904 Other matters connected with the Bushehr Residency, 1905.

British re- The question of appointing a British Political Officer to Bandar at^andai* 011 'Abbas had been raised by Colonel Eoss, then Eesident in the Persian 'Abbas, Gulf, so far back as 1879, and had been considered anew in 1882, 1884, 1900 1905, 2885, 1888 and 1892, the proposals for the creation of an appointment being supported, on most of these occasions, by petitions from Khojah and Hindu British subjects engaged in trade at the port. In 1893 the appointment as Vice-Consul at Bandar ^Abbas of a British merchant residing there was approved by the Government of India and sanc tioned by His Majesty^s Government, but was not proceeded with; and in 1896 the matter was again raised, but a decision post' poned. At length in February 1900, in view especially of the growth of an illicit trade in arms between Masqat and Bandar ^Abbas, Lieute nant V. de V. Hunt, of the Indian Political Department, was deputed provisionally to Bandar ^Abbas in the capacity of Assistant to the Resident in the Persian Gulf. A Vice-Consular exequatur was obtained from the Persian Government in his name covering the districts of Bandar ^Abbas and Yazd, it being intended that his summer quarters should be at the latter place. An Indian Hospital Assistant was attached to the Vice-Consul, and the opening of a charitable dispen sary under the management of the former was contemplated. In June 1904 the status of the British officer at Bandar ; Abhas was raised to that of Consul, and his consular jurisdiction was enlarged, so as to include, besides the town of Bandar ''Abbas, the coast districts of Shibkuh, Lingeh, Shamil, Minab, Biyaban, and Persian Makran, and the islands belonging to Persia in the eastern part of the Gulf, while in his capacity of Assistant to the Resident he was placed in charge of the Ruus-al-Jibal and Shamailiyah tracts of the ^Omafl peninsula, of the Arab islands of Tunb and Bir Musa, and of the Britist station of Basidu on the island of Qishm ; and it was ordered that one of the British gunboats in the Persian Gulf should ordinarily be stationed within his district. The first incumbent of the appoint ment thus remodelled was Lieutenant W. H. I. Shakespear. A guard of one Norn Commissioned Officer and three troopers of Indian cavalry were allotted to the Bandar ^Abbas Consulate under the general scheme which provided military guards for all British Consulates in Persia,2147 Affairs of the British I—1905. fct kj gjitlsh representative was at first accommodated in a hired ffji .y. a (. Naiband, three miles east of Bandar 'Abbas; but eventually, k 1 ' 1905 it was resolved to construct suitable Government quarters for 'q him at a site nearer to the town. Htlj the British station of Basldu on Qishm Island difficulty was Ittj {tom time to time caused by the threatened or actual immigration from tJe adjoining Persian districts of political malcontents or victims of Ration of official tyranny. _ _ „ £ tj v. * • • ] In 1897 some of the A1 Bu Samait. an Arab tribe of Bahrain origin but settled at Lingeh, took refuge for a time at Basidu; and at the beginning of 1901 the Shaikh of Bahrain wrote to the Resident request- protection for the Al Bu Samait colony of Lingeh, whose intention it 'then was to remove in a body to Basidu, in consequence of an enhancement of the Persian tax on their pearling boats. The move ment did not, however, take place. In November 1901 some of the 'Abadilah on the Persian island of Shaikh Shu'aib expressed a wish to emigrate to Basidu and place themselves under British protection but their proposals; were discouraged and they took no action. In 1902 the Native Coal Agent representing the Bushehr Residency if at Basidu was instructed uot to prevent British subjects from settling ■ within the limits of the British station, but he was ordered to prevent la£ the erection of permanent buildings there without previous reference to the Residency. The object of this order was to prevent the occupation of sites which might one day be required for public purposes, but it had the incidental effect of preventing any undesirable influx, A number of poor Persians from Old Basidu and from the mainland, however, built themselves a temporary village at Singau within the British boundary aud remained there for some time, their object being to place themselves beyond reach of molestation by the Persian Customs officials. In April 1905 the well known Mirin -ut-Tojjar of Bushehr asked permission to store red oxide at Basidu for exportation, his idea being evidently to escape the formalities and expenses which attended shipment of the oxide from Hormuz, where it was extracted and where there was a Persian Customs post. To grant his request might have been to cause trouble of difEerent kinds so it was refused, op The Persian Customs officials on Qishm Island at one time seemed inclined to annoy the residents of British Basidu, and tiied to oblige native sailing vessels bringing supplies for the station to discharge them at Old Basidu, where they were liable to duty. The Persian Mudir ^ 145 A2148 of Customs used also sometimes to pry within the British limits -but having been threatened on one occasion by some emancipated slaves' he discontinued the practice. In 1905 it was observed by the Political Resident at Bushehr that a packet of stationery sent by him to the British Coal Agent was classified by the Imperial Persian Customs as export, ' in other words that Basidu was regarded by the Customs as non-Persian territory. ment^a^ Hanjam Island, abandoned in 1880 as a British telegraph station, British tele- was re-occupied as such in 1904 for reasons which are explained elsewhere, on HanjamJ 11 ^ ca ^ e was landed without previous notice to the Persian Government, .I904r05. and on the 19th April telegraphic communication with Bushehr and Jashk was restored. The immediate effect of the British proceedings was to draw the attention of the Persian Government to Hanjam and stimulate them to assert their authority over the island. In November or December 1904 the European Director of Persian Customs at Bandar ; Abbas visited Hanjam where he set up a flagstaff and established a Customs post, occupied by a Persian Mudir and two subordinates, in close proximity to the telegraph station. A Persian flagstaff erected by the Malik-ut-Tujjar in 1889, when he found the island unoccupied, on the site of one of the former British telegraph buildings, remained where it was until January 1905. It was then, on the representations of the British Government, removed to another place, but it continued to be inconveniently close to the British settlement. The evident intention of the Persian Government to make their con trol over Hanjam effective alarmed the Bani Yas Arab inhabitants, whose position hitherto had been one of virtual freedom and independence; and the Shaikh of the island, Ahmad-bin ''Obaid, a son-in-law of the Shaikh of Dibai, sought the support of the British authorities in resisting encroachments and innovations. In February 1905 he even applied to Lieutenant Shakespear, His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Bandar Abbas, who happened to visit Hanjam on tour, for British protection; he asserted that the status of Hanjam was the same as that of Tunb, that the Persians had never exercised the slightest authority on the island, and that he would resist by force any attempt on their part to altei the situation; but his overtures were not, of course, entertained. The demeanour of the Arabs towards the new Customs post was fo r a time threatening ; and the continuance of the Persian employs on the island was made possible only by the presence of the British telegraph staff, who protected them and supplied them with drinking water.2149 j; n May 1905 it was found necessary, in order to placate the Bani Yas, to cease giving water to the Persian Customs post from the tanks of the British station ; and the Persian Mudir, resenting this deprivation, attempted to prevent the supply of provisions from Qishm Island to the telegraph staff; he desisted, however, after complaints had been made to the Customs administration. In October 1905 Lieute^ nant Shakespear again visited Hanjam and found the feelings of the Arab population towards the Persians much exacerbated; but on this, as on the former occasion, no hope was held out to him of British intervention. On the 30th of November the Sultan of ^Oman, in returning to Masqat from a visit to Abu Dhabi, called at Hanjam; he had been for some months previously receiving written appeals for help from the Shaikh of the island; and a few days later he wrote to the Resident protesting against the subjection of the Bani Yas of Han jam to any form of Persian jurisdiction, and justifying his interest in them by an assertion that their ancestors had been settled on the island by former Sultans of ''Oman. About August 1905 a Lloyd^s station from which ships could report themselves was opened on Han jam by the agency of the telegraph staff; and during the latter part of the year negotiations were in progress at Tehran for a re-arrangement of the Persian buildings and flagstaffs which would assure the amenity of the British settlement and the purity of its water supply.2150 Adventure of Sir Robert Sherley at Gwadar, 1613. OHAPTEE XII. HISTORY OF* PERSIAN MAKRAN. Makran under the Maliks, early in tlie 17th century. In or about the year 1613^ the last ruler of the dynasty of ' Ma^iks/ , who had been the local Governors of Makran for many generations; came into power. It is probable that the authority of this family did not extend so far westward as the Jashk district; but Gwadar, now included in the ■'Oman Sultanate, was, at the time when our survey of Persian Gulf affairs begins, a dependency, at least in name of the Persian empire; and its earlier history, accordingly, forms a part of that Persian Makran. In 1613, on his return from his first embassy to Europe, where he represented Shah ^Abbas at various courts. Sir Eobert Sherley, as related in the chapter on the general history of the Gulf, touched at Gwadar; and here a a revolted duke t from the Persian, with his forces being there, ' sought, treacherously, to surprise the ambassador, and to take the ship with the merchants, their goods, and all; but by God's providence, the duke's treason was discovered by a Persian hermit, by which means the English were miraculously delivered from extreme danger/' Sir Robert, possibly actuated by resentment against the treacherous duke ; wrote from Gwadar on the 18th of September 1613 to the Court of the East India Company in London, a persuading the settling of a factory there, which although not in Persia, is under the Government of a tribu tary, and stating, with ignorant or perhaps unscrupulous exaggera tion, ' that it promises the richest traffic in the world, and is free from the Portugals.' • The chief authorities for the history of Persian Makran from 1600 to 1800 are:- Lieutenant E. C. Ross's Memorandum of Notes on Mekran, 1865, and the Imperial Gazetteer of India (Sections Baluchistan and Makran). See also Ue Three Brothers \m and the works of delia Valle, Tavermer, and A . Hamilton ^ he. &lt; n , » Ell S llsh boo ks and reports the title &lt;( Khan ' is generally translated 4 Duke, but closer acquaintance with Persian Khans brought thi 8 honorific^ u\lo disuse. &amp;2152 the deceased Khan, having been appointed by the Shah to succeed hi m m the government of Hormuz, at once invaded the territory of Jastt but he was beaten and forced to retire with the loss of many men' n afterwards, however, he succeeded in capturing the chief of Jashkai sea on his way to Makran, and brought him back a prisoner to Bandar Abbas. But the matter did not end here, for, while the Khan was spending the summer in the mountains inland of the Shamil district, the chief's wife surprised his camp one night with a body of horse and released her husband, besides billing the Khan himself and a number of his men. A third brother of the same family then became governor of Hormuz and attempted, with a large force drawn partly from har, Kirman and even Shlraz, to avenge his predecessor; but the chief of Jashk, assisted by his two 'idolatrous' neighbours on the east, once more defeated the Persians in a pitched battle. The second in command of the Jashk forces, described as an 'Indian' and therefore probably a Baluchi, was however captured by the Khan and brought to Bandar 'Abbas, where he was shamefully tortured until 'the chief of the ^ Holland Company and other strange merchants, abhorring so much cruelty, begg d of the Kan to surcease his rigour, who readily granted 'them their request.' ,, ' BalQeir i n - The behaviour of the inhabitants of Makran during the reign of Persian 10m Shal1 , Husain &gt; that is from 1694 to 1723, is described by Captain Krmsn, etc' ( Hamllton, a con temporary writer, in these words : ' The whole reign 1694.1722. '' of the last s ophi, or King, was managed by such Vermin, that the ''Ballowches and Mackrans, who inhabit the Sea-coast from Cape ^Jasques to Indus, observing the weakness of the Government, threw ''off the Yoke of Obedience first, and, in full Bodies, fell in upon their ^ nei g'bbours m Carmania, who were thriftier and richer than the mari- ' time Freebooters, and plundered their Fellow Subjects of what they had ^ got by.their painful Industry. There was no Want of Kemonstrance ^ and Petitions put into the Court to put a stop to those Enormities, but no Redress could be had.' As shown in the general history of the Gulf, Baluchis of Makran, encouraged apparently by the Afghan invasion of Persia, made an incursion into Lar in 1721 and even attacked the British and Dutch Factories at Bandar 'Abbas. In 1738 or 1789, apparently in the course of his invasion of India, Nadir Shah sent orders to Muhammad Tswp Khan, governor of Shiraz, to take command of some troops that had been prepared for service it- man and to advance with them by land into Sind, sending his artillerv by sea. In 1739 Muhammad Taqi Khan wrote to Sind reporting thai Persian ex pedition to -Makran, 1739. jo2153 bad been delayed in Makran, but that he had since taken the fort of Sllji ^ and {reduced Malik Dinar, a Gichki chief, to obedience. He was informed in reply that Sind had been conquered, and that he should dismiss his troops and join Nadir Shah without delay. It seems probable y ^ Muhammad Taqi Khan during his invasion of Makran occupied Gwadar and made it his port. The immediate object of the Persian operations in Makran appears to have been to help Shaih Qasim, a Bulaidai chief who had become an orthodox Muhammadan, against Malik Dinar, who was a Zikri; but their effect was transitory. On Taqi Khan^s departure, Gwadar, the last Bulaidai stronghold, fell into the hands of Malik Dinar; and Bulaidai rule in Makran came to an end. Makran under the Khans of Kalat, 1740-97. We may take as the next period in Makran history, though it is an aitificial one, the time which intervened between the downfall of the Bulaidais and the accession to the throne of Persia of Fat-h 'Ali Shah. During the greater part of this period the predominant authority in Makran was that of the Ahmadzai (Brahui) ruling family of Kalat, who, after the decline of the Mughal Empire of Delhi, owed allegiance to the Durrani sovereign of Afghanistan. The Gichki tribe, who were Zikris like most of the Bulaidais, succeeded at first to the control of the former Bulaidai districts ; but the by the Khans Khans of Kalat, who were orthodox Muhammadans, early began to encroach upon their territories and independence j and Mir Nasir Khan I, who reigned at Kalat from 1750 to 1793, made no less than nine expeditions against them. The struggle was ended, apparently beforo the year 1778, by a compromise under which the revenues of the country were divided equally between the Gichki chiefs and the Khan, the direct administration, however, remaining in the hands of the Gichkis. The Gichki Government was dual, for, while an elder branch of the family teld Panjgur, a younger one possessed Kaich and Gwadar. One of the most important consequences of the intervention of the Khans of Kalat in Makran affairs was the transference of Gwadar, as the 'Oman teibed in the history of Gwadar and Chahbar, by Mir Nasir I to ^84-92?' Saiyid Sultan, then a refugee from Masqat, about the year 1784. The townj with the district attached to it, was retained by the Saiyid after his succession to the Sultanate of 'Oman, of which in this manner it became a dependency ; and the grant, though its validity and justice have been ^pugnedj has remained in effect to the present day2154 FAT-H 'AL1 SHAH, 1797-1834. of From the beginning of the reign of Fat-h 'Ali Shah in 1797; we may treat Persian Makran^ though as yet the Persian Government had no real footing in the province, as a portion of his dominions. Almost immediately on the death of Mir Nasir I of Kalat, in 1793 or 1794, Brahui influence had ceased to be felt in Makran; and the whole country was thereafter parcelled out among local chiefs ; belonging to various tribes, who were in every respect independent. ^ The first European officer to explore Persian Makran was Captain N, P. Grant, an officer on the staff of General Malcolm, who deputed him to travel in the country at the beginning of 1809, when the seizure of Kharag Island by a force from India was contemplated. The ostensible object of Captain Grants mission was to purchase horses; but its real purpose was ' to ascertain whether an European army could penetrate into India by the southern coast of Persia.^ Captain Grant embarked at Bombay on the East India Companys cruiser 'Ternate' on the 18th January 1809, and on the 29tli te arrived at Gwadar; but on the advice of Captain Seton, the Britisli Resident at Masqat, who considered the country in that neighbourhood too unsettled to be safe, he landed instead at Gwatar, which belonged to Mir Subhan, the Jadgal chief of Dashtyari and Bahu, whose tribe was at this time the most influential in Makran. From Gwatar Captain Grant marched by land to Chahbar, where he arrived on 9th February y and on the 11 th he left again for Nigor, meeting there with Mir Subhan, by whom he was well received. On the 28th February he reached Qasrkand, of which place he found the chief, Shaih Samandar,, to be independent of other authority ; and there he waited until the of March for Muhammad Khan, the chief of Gaih, under whose p r0 ^ ec tion alone it was possible for him to proceed further into the interior- Gaih was at this time the second place in all Makran, being iftf el101 ^ importance to Kaich only. From Gaih, Captain Grant maiche ^ Bampur; but the bad character of the chief of that place 111 a 6 imprudent for him to attempt to travel thence direct to ^ 'Abbas, which was the goal of his journey; and he therefore retraces ^ steps vid Qasrkand and Gaih, where he halted on the 5th and 7th o ^ See Captain Grant's Journal of a Route through the Western Pari 8 v in the Journal of the Boyal Asiatic Society for 1839.2156 ectively, to Chahbar, arriving there on the 10th. He then returned jeC ' mar ched thence (13th April) by Balak and the Karwan tract 16th April). Kashi (17th April), Sadaich {18th April), where he entered J, J Ljaghk district, and Jagin (19th April), to Old Jashk, which he reached ^ kl the ^Oth April. The Chief of Jashk had removed to Sink in the 8 , !! . b . n district, and thither Captain Grant pursued his way, passing i ri Jough Bahmadi before he quitted the Jashk district. The remainder 0 f ^ route to Bandar ; Abbas lay beyond the bounds of Persian Makran. M Captain Grant reported that his journey was made possible only by I the high respect in which the name of Captain Seton, the British Resident at Masqat, was held throughout the whole of Makran. He b Jipj m furnished by that officer with letters of introduction to Mir Subhan, the chief of Dashtyari and Bahu, who in his turn provided him with the credentials that enabled him to visit Qasrkand and the country beyond. He carried letters of credit from Masqat, between which place aad Chahbar there was a considerable trade, but the largest bills which he could obtain in return for these upon villages in the interior did not exceed Rs. 200. He travelled in European costume, making no secret of his nationality, and he a found the inhabitants more civil and hospitable than they had been represented.^ In view of the Gallophobia by which the Government of India and all Anglo-Indians were at this time possessed, we are not surprised to find Captain Grant reporting, on the conclusion of his journey, that a European invasion of India by way of Makran was ' perfectly practi cable,' and that the idea that scarcity of water would be a great obstacle to the movement of troops by this route was erroneous. The former opinion, it need hardly be added, is not borne out by the typo graphical facts, which are more fully ascertained at the present time than thej were in his day. At the time of Sir Gore Ouseley^s mission to Persia in 18 LI, though Political Persian influence in M akran was probably no stronger than it had been j^krlin at the time of the visit of Captain Grant, who did not even mention 1811. it, or inl810 ; when Lieut, Pottingar found Persian authority held in contempt by the chief of Bampur, the country seems to have been regarded—at least by the Persians—as under the sovereignty of the Shah. In 1613, as we have seen, the claim on behalf of Persia appurently existed j and during the two centuries which had since elapsed, though ne?er enforced except by Nadir Shah in 1739, it had probably not or allowed to fall entirely into desuetude. • ''- 1 ' ; i ndo b ■ V t9( &gt; ^ ■' ; - ■ ■ ■■ . \/.V. \ . .

Invasion of Persian Makran in the interest Of the Agha Khan, and occupation of Bamptir by the Persian Government, 1844. Growth of Persian influence in Makran, 1844-1861. About May 1843 Agha Khan, who was head of the Isma'ili sect but had been obliged to leave Persia by the failure of his insurrection against the Shah, sought an asylum at Karachi, which had then veiy recently come under the British flag. Towards the close of the year Sardar Khan, Agha Khan's brother and a sharer in his exile, left Karachi with a body of 200 horsemen whom he had managed to collect, and marched by land to Gwadar, and from Gwadar to Chahbar. Arrived at Chahbar, which as the seat of a small Khojah community devoted to Agha Khan was a convenient base for his proceedings, Saidar Khan entered into correspondence with the inhabitants of Bampur, then ruled by an independent Baluch Chief, and the surrounding country; and before long he was in possession of that place and had succeeded in attracting some 2,000 men to his standard. The Persian Governor-General of Kirman, however, having reported these events to Tehran, presently received orders to reduce ampur.^ This he effected after an investment; Sardar Khan was •e .T ^ SOner an( ^ sen ^ Tehran; and Bampur remained in the hands or the Persians. the Persian Gulf Eesidencv 8 the history ^ this period in Persian Makran aic x-wmA-is sz2157 to one 111 Muhammad \ fcl; prom Bampur Persian control was quickly extended southwards the Baluch Chiefdoms of Gaih and Qasrkand. Gaih was held at ^ time by a Gichki chief named Mir ; Abdullah-bin-Murad Huhammad ; who seems to have been carried off to Kirman by the Persian authorities and detained there for a year until a sum of over £500 had been collected and paid into the Persian Treasury on fa behalf by Din Muhammad, the Jadgal chief of Bahu. Din was then appointed Persian Deputy Governor of some of the Baluch tribal districts under Bampur; and in that capacity he after wards took part in levying an annual contribution of 100 camels, besides occasional lump sums in cash, from his former friend the Chief of Gaih. The political status of the Jashk district, when examined in 1861, was different from that of the eastern districts just mentioned. It was apart of Biyaban, as the term a Biyaban ' was then understood ; and as such it was included in the Persian fief of Bandar ^ Abbas and its depen dencies held by the Sultan of ^Oman. The Sultanas tenure of the district was of old standing, but it had lately been confirmed, its terms being at the same time more strictly defined, by a Treaty concluded between him and the Shah in 1856. The Governor of Jashk on the part of Masqat in 1861 was one Mir Husain ; and the Sadaich stream then, as now, marked approximately the eastern limit of the district. By 1861 Mir 'Abdullah of,Gaih had recovered his position as the principal chief in the Makran districts east of Jashk. The coast from Sadaich eastwards to Tiz was under his direct authority, and the name of Din Muhammad of Bahu was respected, on the seaboard, at Gwatar only. Inland, to the north of the maritime districts with which we are concerned, the Persians were engaged in extending their effective con trol eastwards. They were reported to have occupied Dizak and Sarbaz and to be meditating an attack on Kaij, the chief place in the Makran territories of the Khan of Kalat. The town of Chahbar, forming as it were a very small enclave in the coast districts to the east of Jashk, belonged in 1861 to the Sultan of 'Oman, by whose family it had been held as a conquest since 1792-, en tirely without reference to Persia. Political questions in Makran connected with the Indo-Euro pean telegraph, 1861-1862.

Position at Chahbar, 1861.2158 this book may be consulted, brought the political constitution of Maban suddenly under scrutiny. This was in 1861, when the dependence of the districts was as described above. Rev. Mr. A preliminary report on the political aspects of a land line through report, 1 *June Makr ^ was obtained by the Government of Bombay in June 1861 from 1861.' that ingenious divine the Rev. G. P. Badger, who had been chaplain and Arabic interpreter with the British Field Force in Persia in 1856-57 and later Secretary to the British Commission on the separation of ^Oman and Zanzibar in 1860, and whom the possession of influence and good sources of information at Masqat particularly qualified to un ravel the complications of the various jurisdictions in Makran and the connections of the districts with the central Persian Government. Mr. Badgers report brought out clearly an initial difficulty from which British Political action in Western Makran could not be freed. To ignore the Persian Government and to deal direct with the Sultan of 'Oman and the Baluch chiefs concerned seemed inadmissible •, while, on the other hand, to negotiate with the Persian Government over the heads of the chiefs, who possibly regarded their subjection to Persia as wrongful and temporary, might be to incur the dislike of the very autho rities upon whom the safety of the telegraph line would really depend. Discussion in After considering Mr. Badger's report, the Government of Bombay procedure^to su ^^ es ^ e ^ principles guiding British political action should be be adopted, recognition of such status as Persia had actually acquired in Makran, and 1861. 0 1 institution, by her permission only, of direct relations with local chiefs. The Government of India, however, considered that an indispensable pr6' liminary to any negotiations with Persia was to ascertain, with some precision, the extent of the Persian claims in Makran and the degree and nature of the Persian control over the local chiefs, as otherwise the result of a reference to the Persian Government might be to raise questions embarrassing to the British authorities and prejudicial to the chiefs whose allegiance was brought under discussion. They accordingly addressed His Britannic Majesty's Minister at Tehran on the subject. Claim of The Persian Government, as the Government of India had foresee^ Makmn 0 ^ u ^ili s Gd the question of telegraph, construction, which they declared them 1861-62. selves most anxious to promote, to lay claim to all the country between Bandar Abbas and the frontier of the British province of Sind j they went so far as to propose an agreement by which &lt; e theii P 0 ^ e ; authority, and proprietary right ' in the territories in question shou( be preserved cc in statu quo,'' the British Government undertaking ^ it would not oppose, either overtly or secretly/' any measures whic the Persian Government might take for increasing their influence in ^2159 itlOHoflL [ rer siaiD l| 11 s«J was in 'd tracts. The introduction of such stipulations into the discussion W as deprecated by Mr. Alison, the British Minister in Persia; their acceptance was earnestly opposed by the Government of India ; and the result was temporary deadlock in regard to the telegraph in Makran. Meanwhile, however, it had been decided to carry matters as far as possible without coming into contact with Persian opposition ; and pursuance of this decision Colonel Goldsmid was deputed to survey and report upon the coast of Makran, During the progress of his en quiries various petitions were presented by local Chiefs, to him and to other British authorities, praying for protection against the tyranny of the ' Qajars ' in collecting revenue ; but no encouragement was held out to the petitioners. The immediate results of Colonel Goldsmid^s mission were the conclusion of telegraph agreements with the Khan of Kalat ; the Jam of Las Bailah, and the rulers of Pasni and Kaij, and the completion in April 1863 of a land line from Karachi to Gwadar. Colonel Goldsmid's first mission to Makran and comple tion of the telegraph to Gwadar, 1862-63. Claims advanced by Persia to Gwadar and Chahbar, 1863. flieas# As the telegraph line approached Gwadar from the side of India, Opposition of Ibrahim Khan, Bami, the Persian Governor of Bampur, began to organise ^y^noTof opposition to its progress and addressed letters on the subject to the Bampur to ^ Sultan of 'Oman, to the ; Omani Wali of Gwadar, and to the Khan of ^863. Kalat, To the Sultan he wrote that it was the duty of that potentate, as holding Chahbar under Persia, to prevent the British from landing telegraph material there until they exhibited an authority from the Persian Government for doing so ; and he indicated that, if the Sultan were not equal to the occasion, he would himself proceed to the spot with 300 cavalry, 6 guns, 3 regiments of infantry, and local levies,—a step which he would have taken earlier, he said, if he had not been dissuaded byMir , Abdullah, Chief of Gaih. Meanwhile there were constant reports at Gwadar of the approach of a large body of Hind tribesmen under Persian leaders, and com munication between the town and the interior was cut off. On the 12th March Eind marauders under Shah Dost, an agent of Ibrahim Khan, came within four miles of Gwadar and carried off a large number of camels and cattle; twelve persons were killed by them, and several natives of the country whom they had wounded were brought into Gwadar; but the telegraph working parties, though alarmed, were not ^ olested.2160 Gwadar and On fche completion of the line up to Gwadar, IbraliTm Khan wrote to claimed by ^^li of that place and to Mr. Walton^ the British Telegraph Supers- Persia, 1863. intendent there ; but ; while ' speaking of Mekran and Baluchistan in most vague terms/ ; he seemed ' to confine his threats to the carrying of the Telegraph beyond Gwadur/'' On the proceedings of Ibrahim Khan being brought to their notice, the Persian Government repudiated his action, and undertook that orders should be sent him not to interfere with the telegraph operations, unless under instructions from themselves. But they claimed Gwadar and Chahbar as Persian possessions, and they requested an assurance that the passage of the telegraph line through either place would not be held to prejudice the right of Persia to it. In reply it seems to have been pointed out that Persia had not, for generations past, professed or exercised any rights to the eastward of Gwadar, and that it was intended to continue the telegraph beyond that point by submarine cable, not by a land line. In October 1863 the Persian Ministry asked for information in regard to a statement, which they said was current, that the Sultan of ^Oman was about to lease Gwadar and Chahbar to the British Govern ment ; and protested by anticipation against any such transaction, alleging, absolutely without foundation, that both places were included in the lease by Persia of Bandar ^Abbas and its dependencies to the Sultan. Proceedings with reference to the telegraph in Makran, 1863-1864. At the end of 1863 Colonel Goldsmid was ordered by the Govern ment of Bombay to prepare a a detailed statement, for communication to Her Majesty ^s Minister at Tehran through the Secretary of State for India, showing, according to the best information available, how far the claims of Persia, Kelat, or Maskat, or any other State to any sovereign right in any town or district in Mekran are founded on Treaty, or possession, or acknowledgment by the local rulers' Accordingly Colonel Goldsmid submitted a report in which he remarked with refer ence to Persia, ' as to her right, I know of none but of the strong oyer the weak, of the prestige of a high-sounding monarchy over the obscurity of a small Chiefdombut at the same time he thought that, generally speaking, 'her claim to possession was fully equal to that of any Govern ment stronger than that of the petty Chiefs themselves whom she Colonel Goldsmid's report on political rights in Makran, December 1863.146 {tZft 2161 ubjugates.' It seemed to him, however, that the Sultan of ^Oman had a rtl prescriptive and indefeasible rights of sovereignty over Gwadar and Chahbar. He was not aware of the existence of any Treaties; and he re- commended that the progress of Persia should be arrested, in the interests of British India, at the point which it had actually reached. He suggest ed that, in view of a^ request by the Persian (rovernment for an amicable adjustment of her eastern frontier, which had been rejected by the British Government, and of the status conferred on Kalat through the conclusion by the British authorities with her, as an independent State, of a telegraph agreement, the time might be opportune for a friendly delimitation of the boundary between Persia and Kalat in Makran ; and he proposed, as the most suitable line of demarcation, one running from Gwatar bay to the confines of Sistan. In consequence of this report Colonel Goldsmid was himself deputed to Makran to complete, ' by such oral enquiry as he might find safe and practicable, the collection of evidence as to the actual exercise of sovereign rights on the Mekran Coast within living memory/ - ' The outcome of this mission was a series of three exhaustive reports, in which Colonel Goldsmid reaffirmed in general his former conclusions. He had ascer tained that the collection of revenue in Dashtyari and Bahu on behalf of the Persian Government was an innovation even more recent than the similar procedure in Gaih ; and he mentioned a Persian raid in 1862 on territory undoubtedly belonging to Kalat, in which more than one member of the leading family of Jinwri was killed^ as a proof that some understanding as to the position of the frontier had become desirable. At the end of 1864 a tour was made by Colonel Pelly, Resident in the Persian Gulf, from Bandar'Abbas to Jashk by land in connection with the telegraph question. Second mission of Colonel Goldsmid to Makran and further reports by him on the questions at issue, also tour by Colonel Pelly, 1864. General position in Makran in 1864. In 1864, notwithstanding a suspension of the activity of Ibrahim Khan, Governor of Bampur, in the direction of Chahbar and Gwadar, the attitude of the local Persian officials continued to be aggressive. An attack upon Kaij in Kalat territory by Mir 'Abdullah, Chief of Gain, was apprehended; and it was generally believed that he had secured countenance, if not a definite promise of assistance, from the Governor- ^fineral of Kirman and Ibrahim Khan of Bampur, in connection with designs in that quarter. •. * ^ Persian request for aid in settling the boundary between Persia and Afghan- s an had been finally refused by the British Government in November 1863, after * two years' discussion.

The Chief of the Jashk and Biyaban districts about this time was Mir 'Abdun Nabi, who had usurped possession of them and of the fort of Old Jashk on the death of Mir Husaiuj an earlier chief. He was an ener getic and influential man, and was soon confirmed in the position whicli he had made for himself by the ruler of ; Oman. The only local chiefs of importance between Gwadar and the Jashk district in 1864) were those of Gaih ; Dashtyari and Bahu, of which districts the last two ; though actually governed by separate rulers, seem to have been regarded as forming one chiefdom. The chief of Gaih was still Mir ^Abdullah^ who received Rs. 200 a year from the Sultan of ^Oman for protecting Chahbar; and Dashtyari and Bahu were ruled by Mir Din Muhammad and Mir Mahammad ''Ali; Jadgals, of whom the former was paid Rs. 900 a year by the Sultan of 'Oman from the revenues of Chahbar, while the latter appears to have been in direct charge of Gwatar. These two chiefs were near collateral relatives of one another; and Din Muhammad was married at this time, or not much later, to a sister of Mir ^Abdullah of Gaih. Mir ; Abdullah was revenue collector, on the part of the Persian Government, for all three districts. At Gwatar liability to pay revenue to Persia was repudiated, in theory but not in practice, as an unjust innovation resulting in a double collection of taxes, one in the name of the Persian Government and a second time for the benefit of the local chief. Meanwhile Gwadar and Chahbar continued to be administered and taxed, without the interference of any Persian agent, by representatives of the Sultan of 'Oman on their master's behalf. Further proceedings with reference to the telegraph in Makran, and question of the border between Persia and Kalat, 1865—1868. Recommen dation 8 of: Oolonel Goldsmid, 1865, In 1865 Colonel Goldsmid, who had in the interim become Chief Director of the Indo-European Telegraph and who was at the moment engaged in assisting Her Britannic Majesty's Minister at Tehran to conclude a telegraph convention with Persia, was consulted by ^ Government of Bombay in regard to the extreme limit to which a aI1 line might be extended westwards from Gwadar without encountering opposition or reasonable objection on the part of the Persian authorities. After pointing out a practical distinction between ' opposition aI1 reasonable objection,' Colonel Goldsmid gave it as his opim 011 ^ Persia could not reasonably object to the extension of the telegr a P^ ^2168 ^ Islil felii| j [ d from Gwadar to the eastern extremity of the Jashk district, then held by Sultan of ''Oman on lease from Persia ; but he thought that the Persian claims included everything to the west of Gwadar ; and he recommended that, in the interests of the telegraph as well as of the state f Kalat, in alliance and friendship with Britain, the position of the boundary between Persia and Kalat should be discussed and defined. The greatest difficulty in the way of this was the discontent that might be excited among the petty Baluch chiefs who found themselves definitively placed under Persia in consequence of a settlement. Colonel Goldsmid inclined, on the whole to an arrangement under which Persia should assent to direct dealings between the British authorities and the local chiefs from Gwadar to Jashk in telegraph matters, the question of the suzerainty over those chiefs being left undecided. On the conclusion of the Anglo-Persian Telegraph Convention of 1865, Colonel Goldsmid was authorised to return to India by any route that lie pleased, bearing in mind the desirability of promoting, if possible, the prolongation of the Makran telegraph line by a branch into the interior of Persia. He accordingly travelled with his Assistant, Major Smith, from Tehran by Isfahan, Yazd, and Kirmanto a point 100 miles east of Kirman, where they parted. Colonel Goldsmid afterwards pro ceeding to Bampur and thence through the hills to Chahbar on the coast, while Major Smith marched direct to Bandar •'Abbas and, landing again at Jashk, made a short tour along the coast to the east of that place. The courtesy and hospitality of Ibrahim Khan of Bampur to Colonel Goldsmid on this journey formed an agreeable contrast with his usual attitude towards the British in Makran. The result of the reconnaissance was a scheme for duplicatin g part of the Indo-European telegraph system by means of a land line connect ing Gwadar with Isfahan by way of Bandar ^Abbas, Kirman, and Yazd ; and a draft convention to this end was elaborated by the Government of India and Her Majesty's Government in consultation, from which all reference to the disputed boundary between Persia and Kalat was excluded, a settlement of that question by separate negotiations being now contemplated. The character and limits of Persian authority in Makran were clearly ascertained by Colonel Goldsmid on his journey in 1866. Mirza Said Khan, the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, had already informed him at Tehran that the extent of Persian jurisdiction was best known to the Vakil-ul-Mulk, Vazir and virtual Governor General of Kirman ; and that official, on whom the title of ' Sardar of Baluchistan had recently 146 A.

Position of Persia in Makran in 1866-67.2164 been bestowed, frankly told Colonel Goldsmid that Persia had no title to Gwadar, and that her power on the sea coast to the west of that place was too slight to allow of his issuing* permits to foreigners for landing on it. Colonel Goldsmid found the seaboard tract a comparatively cut of! from the upper country by a rugged hill range ' inhabited by Balucli ti'ibe% to the north of which lay the district of Bam pur, ' about as muoli Persian as Kirman Proper; ;; while the status of the districts to the soutli of it was entirely different. Bampur was governed by Persian officials and was garrisoned by Persian troops, regular and irregular as well as by Baluch levies; but in the southern districts Baluch rule continued, those hereditary chiefs who most readily accepted Persian suzerainty being recognised by the Persian authorities, and Persian garrisons as a rule were not found. Ibrahim Khan, Governor of Bampur, told Colonel G oldsmid that he could not undertake to protect telegraph operations to the west of Gwadar ; and the fluctuating character of the Persian position from place to place was illustrated by Colonel Goldsmid^s own experiences, Shaik ' Abdullah, chief of Qasrkand and Sarbaz, had recently been murdered, and the Persians, in recognising his son as ruler of Qasrkand, had given Sarbaz to the head of another family, who was devoted to the Persian interest: the result was that the direct road from Bampur to Chahbar, via Qasrkand, had become unsafe for travellers under Persian protection, and that Colonel Goldsmid was obliged to take a route by Fanoch. Over this he travelled more than /^OO miles in perfect security, without other escort than that of a petty Persian official, who was unarmed, as were also his Baluch attendants. From another source we know that in 1867 Mlr'Abdullah of Gaih exercised direct authority over the coast districts between Chahbar and Jashk, and indirect authority over those between Chahbar and the Kalat frontier, and that he was extremely unpopular on account of ^ exactions ; also that Yar Muhammad, a Hot chief at Bahu Kalatinthe Bahu district, still held out against the payment of tribute to Peisw- About the same time Mir 'Abdun Nabi, chief of Jashk and Biy ab ^ having killed some of the Tahirzai tribe, was imprisoned by the Persian Deputy Governor of Bandar ^Abbas, and charge of tie districts was assumed by Mir ''Ali, a brother of the former chief Mir Husain. ^ 11 ^Ali was an old man and incapable of making his authority felt. Colonel Goldsmid^s opinion, formed in accordance with information collected on his journey in 1866, was that Dizak (including barbaz, and Pishin (or Pishing) should go to Persia, and Tump an Jinwri to Kalat, the boundary at the coast being placed at the mo'^ 0 the Dasht Khor on Gwatar bay.2165 H'| 'ictstol siaiifl id irregular KM j SMtisois s mpit, toll | ^ Captain Ross, Assistant Political Agent at Gwadar, writing in 1867 ' ^ (( t, mended a line passing near the coast, a few miles to the west of ''''Wort ir'prabol hill on Gwatar bay; and his view seems to have been ' accepted' , . , j hi In 186 6 negotiations for the continuation of the telegraph by land westward from Gwadar were initiated by Mr. Alison, Her Britannic Majesty 's Minister in Persia, with the help of Colonel Goldsmid, who ms again at Tehran ; but the British proposals were not at first enter tained by the Shah, and the discussion was interrupted by a tour which fli s Majesty made to Khurasan in 1867. On the Shah's return from Mashhad the proceedings were resumed, under more favourable auspices, and brought to a successful conclusion in 1868, after the rejection of a Persian scheme according to which Persian jurisdiction was to be recog nised as far east as Gwadar and the telegraph line was to be constructed dWeimpI ^ p ers j a a t ter 0W n cost with the assistance, only, of British^ officers, mftowaj ify Government was, in fact, extremely loath to enter into any 'few engagement that might seem even to countenance a doubt of the vali- asraletiiftij 0 f mos t extensive territorial claims ; but this difficulty was at 10 was imUli leilgtll c i rculnv ented by a judicious wording of the convention, in which roadfrerdiir,;: nomen t;;on was made of the Khan of Kalat, the Sultan of 'Oman, or the feltemHij Balucb Chiefs, it being simply stated that the British Government ed toiahmtj jhould arrange for the construction and efficient working of a line from s in perfed mGwadat to a point between Jashk and Bandar 'Abbas, while Persia ,0 official, \ should employ her good offices and authority for the construction, main- j tenance, and protection of the same, in return for an annual payment (ir'AMiiMiii o£ 3,000 Tumans to be made by the British Government in considera- itween CUta tion of the sanction accorded by Persia to their telegraph operations lahtoanlta! at places under her sovereignty. One of the main objects of Persia in on acwmt • tie negotiations was to guard against the creation of a state of matteio ,1 Eali« IMi which might tempt the local chiefs to defy an authority which she could [ trikte not enforce on them, and to be guided in all political matters by the [ishk ail i; wishes of the British authorities. The actual conclusion of an agree- sonedkyW' meat was delayed by a difficulty in obtaining the consent of the bhah eoftWi* b the establishment of a British Telegraph Station on Hanjam Island; ' Mir Hi» hut, this point having been separately settled, the Anglo-Persian Tele- ihorityW J graph Convention of 1868, framed on the convenient non-terntonal jce basis indicated above, was at length signed. a ' : ,'' J Persian administration in Makran still remained much the same Ma ' a ° a8 it had been in the years immediately preceding ; but it had become, somewhat more defined and systematic. Gaih, Qasrkand,2166 Dashtjari^ and Bahu were all subject, in a sense, to Mir ; Abdullali of Gaih; lie held the position of Naib or Persian Deputy Governor of those districts in subordination to Ibrahim Khan, Governor of Bampiir, who in his turn was under the orders of the Yakil-ul-Mulk, Governor^ General of Kirman or acting as such. The tribute of Dashtyari and Bahu jointly was now K5,000 a year ; and, when the people could not or would not pay the revenue demanded of them, nominally an agri cultural tithe, a military force was sent to ravage the refractory districts. There was still no pretence of interference by the Persian authorities in matters of internal administration. Iu the part of Makran dependent on Kalat the principal authority was Faqir Muhammad, who held the position of Naib or Deputy Gover nor in the Kalat State and had his seat at Kaij. The tract on the coast between Chahbar and the eastern end of the Jashk district was known at Gwadar by the name of Qiblah. Threatened In the autumn of 1868 information was received from various Et 11 sources, independent of one another, that a Persian expedition against 1868^69 Kalat territory was contemplated ; and Ibrahim Khan of Bam- pur undoubtedly wrote to Mir ; Abdullah of Gaih on the subject, General opinion connected the Persian designs with the presence at Gaih of Muhammad Khan, a Gichki of Kaij who had fled to Persian Makran on the expulsion of his uncle, Shaik ''Umar, from the fort of Turbat by the Khan of Kalat^s Naib of Kaij. There were as yet no actual military preparations at Bampur or else where in Persian Makran, and it even seemed unlikely that the projected expedition would materialise; but it was thought well; especially in view of a recent forward movement by Persia in Sistan, to take the precaution of interrogating the Shah^s Government. ^ November 1886 the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs denied knowledge of any intention on the part of the local Persian authorities to invade Kalat, but promised to enquire into the matter; and about the same time the death of Mir 'Abdullah, Chief o Gaih, deprived the Persians of their most useful instrument in Makran. In January 1869 an assurance was received from the Persian Government that no movement against Kalafc had ever been i^en e &gt; ' but that the Governor-General of Kirman had been authorised, aS former years, either to despatch a small force or to proceed himself i' the direction of Chahbar and the Gwadar territory, which were, aS been often explained during the negotiations last spring for the Coast line of telegraph, considered to form part of the Persian do ^i2167 :&gt; '1 ^ ^erno^ tribute ^fll ^ WTsk^ t) the f Naib or jrsian expedifci 1 Ibrahim Kki; •f Gaii on §6 r: ns witli the piaf Umaij froi tkfJ ttions atBampi!! 1 . nMjtbttkfBjf Peri in ft iiali ; s GoTffiW' Foreign n l Persian rf !l re into tk ^ ■ 'AbdiM® ,eived ,d ever been auP i to proef'^' whicli* 9 * 1 ' ;priog fotll,) ^ of the This language on the part of a Persian Minister, together with flttitude of Ibrahim Khan of Bampur in regard to Kaij in the 'us year, and with a desire which he had more recently expressed ^ Kharan was used in March 1869 by Sir W. Merewether Commissioner in Sind, to impress on the Government of Bombay the liability of a settlement of the Persian frontier question; and in the meantime the Commissioner advised the Khan of Kalat to take steps to gtengthen his western border. While these matters were in progress, steps were taken by the British authorities to arrange for the prolongation of the Makran land to of telegraph beyond Gwadar by subsidies, in a manner compatible with the Convention of 1868. At the end of the year Colonel Goldsmid, who had just returned from England to Bombay, visited Gwadar and other places on the Makran Coast to prepare the way for an understand ing with the local chiefs; but the recent death of Mir 'Abdullah of ph, the most important of them all, and delay on the part of the lereian Government in appointing a successor to him made it impossible to enter on actual negotiations. Meanwhile, at the close of 1868, a British telegraph station for submarine work only was established at Jashk as described in the Appendix on the Telegraphs of the Persiau Gulf. In February 1869 Colonel Goldsmid returned to Makran with instructions from the Bombay Government to 'deal with the Chiefs west of Kalat territoryias he should find most advisable when on the spot;' and, in virtue of the ample discretion thus given him, he was able to dispose finally and satisfactorily of the whole.matter. Accompanied by Captain Boss,'Assistant Political Agent at Gwadar, he marched by land from that place to Chahbar, meeting by the way with the Chiefs of Dashtyan and Bahu; from Chahbar he proceeded by sea to Jashk, where he left CaptaiUj Ross to begin the local negotiations, while he himself visited the new telegraph station on Hanj-Ji, and, in leturning fiom Jashk to Gwadar, he had an interview at Chahbar with the new Chief of Gaih, or his representative, the arrangements with whom were made without difficulty. Colonel Goldsmid's political work in Makran was finished in March; and the extension of the telegraph, in connection with which the subsidies arranged by him were granted, was comp ete in August 1869, The Jashk district was at this time divided between Mir'Ali and Mir 'Abdun Nabi, the latter chief having been released y the Persian authorities ; but Mir 'Abdun Nabi now held the eastern part otthe district only, from Jagin to Sadaich; and Biyaban was apparently iu the possession of Mir 'Ali. British telegraph arrangements in Persian Makran, third mission of Colonel Goldsmid and conduct of the Persian Governor of Bampur, 1868-69.2168 In January 1889 ; shortly before Colonel Goldsmid's visit, a letter objectionable in its tone was received by tbe Assistant Political Agent at Gwadar from Ibrahim Khan ; Governor of Bampur ; in which tlie writer intimated that he had not been authorised by his GoTernment to let the telegraph be carried beyond Gwadar; and his attitude so alarmed the chiefs of Dashtyari and Bahu that they were at first unwill ing to enter into negotiations for a British subsidy. Very shortly, however, Ibrahim Khan informed Captain Ross in a courteously worded communication that a copy of the Convention of 1868 had reached him from his Government and that the work might proceed. But his friendship seemed likely to be almost as embarrassing as his opposition, for he ' had received the orders of his Government to aid us : he must come down to the coast : he must personally ascertain that we have got all that we require : and his coming must be the coming of a large body of armed men.'' The Khan at first proposed a meeting between Colonel Goldsmid and himself in Eahu, but the prospect of his arrival so disturbed the people of that district that Colonel Goldsmid twice wrote to assure him that his presence was unnecessary ; and ; whether for this or for other reasons, he did not appear in Bahu. At Chahbar a Persian envoy was found waiting with proposals for a visit to be paid there to Colonel Goldsmid by his master, who was then in Sarbaz; but the reply was that the journey to the coast would be a needless trouble to the Khan and again he did not come. His absence greatly facilitated matters and enabled Colonel Goldsmid to conclude telegraph agreements with the local chiefs in which no reference was made either to Ibrahim Khan himself or to the authority of the Persian Government. Continued During Colonel Goldsmid^s tour along the Makran coast Ibrahim attitud^of -^an hovered in the interior to the northward, at first in Sarbaz, later towards ^ Pishin, threatening descents in various directions; and, about the time Kalat, 1869» ^at Colonel Goldsmid finished his task, it became known that the Khan had demanded tribute of Mir Murad, Chief of Tump in Kalat territory, with vague and misleading references to an understanding between the British and Persian Governments. Tump was near Kaij, head quarters of the Kalat administration in Makran, to which the 1 ersian Deputy Governor might almost equally well have laidcjaio 1. His action, which may have been prompted by the Gichki refuge Muhammad Khan, then in his camp, was successfully counteracted bj Faqir Muhammad, Naib of Kaij, who at once took effectual steps support the Chief of Tump. Ibrahim Khan then quitted his position on2169 tlie Kalat frontier and visited Chahbar on the coast. On his entry into this possession of 'Oman, at the beginning of April 1869, he was accompanied by 100 to 200 horsemen. He remained at Chahbar until the end of the month and then left for Qasrkand, taking all his men with him. Settlement of the Perso-Kalat boundary, 1869—-1871. Matters soon reached a point at which it became imperative, without reference to the telegraph question already settled, to define in some way the frontier between Persia and Kalat. Between December 1869 and February 1870, on information from India regarding the state of that border, the British Minister at Tehran more than once impressed on the Persian Government the necessity of restraining their local officers from encroachments; but the assurances which he received in return were unsatisfactory, and even conveyed an impression that Persia did harbour designs upon territory regarded by the British authorities as belonging to Kalat. In February 1870, under instructions from London, prepared by the Foreign and concurred in by the Indial Office, Mr. Thomson took a stronger line and requested, in view of the disturbance and excitement which were being caused in districts upon the frontier of British India, that aggression and even threats by the Persian local authorities on the side of Kalat should be peremptorily forbidden. Mirza Sa^id Khan, the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, having asked in reply whether this was said in the way of friendly suggestion or of authoritative demand, and whether a reference to any particular Convention was implied, Mr. Thomson explained that the British Government could not look with indifference on the apprehen sions of the state of Kalat, with which they had treaty engagements • that the apprehensions in question were justified by the policy which, not* withstanding disavowal by the Persian Government, the Persian local officials saw fit to maintain, and that in the circumstances it was that orders should be issued preventing unauthorised move^ by the Persian functionaries on the spot. In April 1870, in consequence of these remonstrances, it was suggested—apparently by the Shah himself—that the frontier between Persia and Kalat should be determined by a mixed commission on which Persia, Britain and Kalat should be separately represented. The suggestion commended itself to the British Government ; and Lionel Goldsmid, who was almost simultaneously appointed British representa tions regard ing Persian aggression on Kalat j 1869- 70. Formation of a mixed Boundary Commission, 1870.2170 arbitrator between Persia and Afghanistan in respect of an adjacent disputed boundary in Sistan, was nominated Britisli Commissioner for the determination of the Perso-Kalat frontier. In July the Persian Government showed signs of a desire to depart from the original arrangement, remarking that ' the British and Persian Commissioners were to proceed and draw up a map of Persia's possessions and those of the Khan of Kalat in Baluchistan with their boundaries, and bring the same with them to Tehran; 3) and though Mr. Alison, the British Minister, immediately pointed out that this Would involve the substitution of mere preliminaries for a final settlement, the Persian Government insisted that ' the meaning of the Shah in respect to the demarcation of the frontier' had been 'that the Anglo-Persian Commissioners should prepare a map on the spot for the subsequent settlement of the boundary It was also strongly urged by them that the question of the Sistan boundary, by the settlement of which, it may be observed, they thought that they had more to gain than by the delimitation of the Perso-Kalat frontier ; should be disposed of first; but internal disturbances in Afghanistan, which were likely to delay the proceedings in Sistan, made such a course inconvenient. Movements It having been at length agreed, with the utmost difficulty, that tion^of' 10 ' tlie Perso-KaMt Boundary Commission should not be postponed on General account of the delay in the Sistan case. General Goldsmid, who star August^isTO ^ om England in August 1870, who reached Tehran after the departs —January 0 f the Shah on pilgrimage to Karbala and Najaf, — the Mus an ul-Mamalik remaining in charge of the realm,—-and who w detained at Tehran, Isfahan, and Kirman by discussions between ^ British Legation and the Eegent and references by the latter to Shah, reached Bampur on the 28th January 1871. Detailed instructions in regard to the Sistan dispute had been g' ^ General Goldsmid by Her Majesty^s Government, but it was left^^ Government of India to guide his proceedings in regard to the ^ _ Kalat border. The directions of the Government of India, ^ him in January 1871, were to the effect that his &gt;bject shoul^J ^ secure to Kalat the places properly dependent on that state, ^ ^ very liberal view might be taken of the claims of Persia further ^ westward; and that Kohak, Panjgur, Kaij, Tump, Nasiraba ^ Hand should apparently, in accordance with his own P 1 ^ 1 ^ expressed views, be included in Kalat, while Jalk, Dizak, a ^ Pishin and Bahu were assigned to Persia. Colonel Goldsm2in recommended to exercise great caution in proposing any line to the nortli of Jalk; and even to postpone suggesting one, the reason being that a premature determination of that section might compromise the position of the Sistan border, to be settled later, which must necessarily be a continuation of it. The Government of India explained that Captain Harrison, Political Agent at Kalat, and Major Eoss, Assistant Political Agent at Gwadar, though they would be attached to the Commission, were not to be regarded as possessing any authority co -ordinate with that of General Goldsmid, their duties being only to supply him with information and perform such other services as he might require of them. It was added : ' When the three Commis sioners/' viz., Colonel Goldsmid himself and the representatives of Persia and Kalat, ' are unanimous, the boundary will be defined in accordance with their opinion. When they differ, the boundary will be laid down in accordance with the views of the majority.'' On the question whether any settlement that might be reached by the Commission would be treated as final, the Government of India were unable, in consequence of the attempted modification of the original understanding by the Persian Government, to pronounce a decided opinion. This last point was referred to the Secretary of State for India, who replied that General Goldsmid should communicate the decision at which he might arrive to the Commissioners of Persia and Kalat in writing, with a statement of the facts and arguments on which it was based; that he should await on the spot the result of the references which they would then make to their respective Governments ; that he should endeavour to remove any objections that might be raised; and that, if he failed in this, he should inform his colleagues that bis task was at an end, and then report to his own Government. The Government of India in transmitting these instructions to General Goldsmid, told Mm that the clause relating to the communication of written papers tc Ms colleagues need not be regarded as absolute, but that he might use his discretion in the matter; and that, on the conclusion of the operations on the spot, he should repair to Tehran with the information collected, and there assist in effecting a final settlement in'communication with Mr. Alison and the Indian and Her Majesty's Governments. At the end of January 1871 General Goldsmid and the Persian proceedings Commissioner, Mir* Ma^sum Khan, who had joined him near Tehran on of the ^ — Boundary . * Major Euaii Smith's account of the Persian Commissioner, though long, may be Commission given here on account of the light which it throws on the difficulties encouiitered by in Makran ^British Commissioner (Goldsinid's Eustern Persia spages 147-148). 1871. ' Mirza Ma'sum Khan was a native of the province of Adarbaijan, very dark and2172 the 25th October 1870, were ; as we have seen, at Bampur. Meanwliile the arrival at Qasrkand of the Kalat Commissioner, Faqir Muhammad, Naib of Kaij, accompanied by Captain Harrison and Major Ross had been announced,; and some sensation was caused by the size of the Kalat party, whose camp contained nearly 300 persons,'—fortunately they were not escorted, as had at one time been proposed, by a detachment of the Sind Horse. The Persian Commissioner, though surprised, agreed to their entering Bampur which General Goldsmid had proposed to obviate by going to meet them ; but their presence seemed highly distasteful to the Persian authorities and to the local tribes, and they left again after a six swarthy, and with a sufficient knowledge of French to enable him to converse fluently in that language, though Turkish waa his ordinary medium of, communication witli servants. He was a man of no family or position, and owed his present appointment to his being the nephew or cousin of Mirza Sa'id Khan, the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, who at this time possessed much influence with the Shah. Mirza Ma'sum Khan's fitness for political employ had not as yet been put to the proof: lie had hitherto filled but very subordinate offices, and had been attached to the Persian embassy at St. Petersburg as one of the smaller attaches, where he picked up his knowledge of colloquial French. He had no lack of general intelligence, and was possessed of a considerable fund of humour, which, when matters of duty were not on the tapis, made him a very Ipleasant travelling companion. But it is nevertheless probable that a more unfit man could not have been found for the work to be accom plished. Being possessed of no wealth of his own, he looked upon his present appointment as, above all, affording him the means of enriching himself by bribes and extortion, to which ruling idea the whole of his conduct was entirely subordinated. His want of social position, again, paralysed anything 1^ free or independent action, through fear of responsibility; and his only notion of carrying on diplomatic work, evidently acquired in the Persian Foreign Office, found vent in endless carefully-worded letters in which the sole object was so to distort tlie true sense of matters as to render it no longer recognisable. In this accomplishment he took especial pride, and showed great skill in using words which might bear two or three meanings different to that which they naturally at first sight conveyed. He was in utter ignorance of the nature of the work which lay before him, an ignorance which even extended to the geographical position of the province of Sistan; bat it 1 ® fair to say that on this point he made no profession whatever of even supeific ia knowledge. Being a man of a singularly presuming nature, he was always striving for a little more than he had a rightful claim to ; but the many and severe rebuffs to which he subjected himself by this line of conduct never served to ruffle his extraordi nary good nature. This wonderful good humour certainly stood him in good stead , 1 made him a bearable companion, even when the knowledge of his endless petty wieb ' deceits, and malversations of the truth was ranking very deeply in the mind—' aI1 ^ possibly more than once saved matters f i-om coming to a complete standstill; f 01 1 was evidently useless wasting anger upon a man who would not see or believe tjia you were angry with him. Mirza Ma'sum Khan was, in short, a deceitful friend, ancM tricky and untrustworthy public servant ; but he was ever and always a cheerful aI good-humoured travelling companion.'2173 ( | a y^ halt. Their coming had been taken as a sign that the title o£ Persia to Bam pur itself was about to be called in question. It early became apparent that no co-operation in a reasonable settle ment of the boundary was to be looked for on the part of the Persian Commissioner. His feelings had probably been worked on by Ibrahim Khan of Bampur, who feared to lose the territories that he had annexed during the previous few years. Mirza Mas^um Khan pretended that the proceedings of the Commission had been limited, by an arrangement at Tehran^ to an enquiry into the status of Kaij only, which was claimed by Persia but was in possession of Kalat. He declined to commence operations in the north; and when General Goldsmid proposed by way of concession that the districts adjoining the sea should be taken in hand first, he rejected that suggestion also. He even refused to discuss the boundary in the neighbourhood of Kaij itself on the basis suggested by General Goldsmid, viz., that, after the Persian claims had been preferred, any counter claim by Kalat should be admitted to a hearing also. He was at length induced to agree to an opening of the proceedings at Pishm ; but as the British Commissioner objected to his being accompanied to the frontier by a Persian armed force, he again withdrew his consent, alleging that the Persian frontier was beyond Pishin. Some time having been lost in fruitless discussions. General Goldsmid, who had not yet received the instructions sent him from India, arranged to proceed to Gwadar, where he would be in telegraphic communication with Tehran and India, and requested the British Minister in Persia to obtain orders for the Persian Commissioner to rejoin him there. At the same time he detached Captain B. Lovett, R.E., a member of his staff, to march down the approximate line of the frontier from north to south, collecting by the way such topographical and other data as he could in regard to the border districts. Mir Ma^sum Khan promised General Goldsmid, before the latter left Bampur on the 16th February, that he would come down to Gwadar, when instructed to do so, and discuss the results of Major Lovett-'s survey or reconnaissance tee; but on the 18th March he began to make difficulties about visiting Gwadar and to suggest that the next meeting should be at Kaij. Colonel Goldsmid reached Gwadar on the 6th, Major Lovett on the 21st of March. The Persian Commissioner, who had in the meantime received his orders, a mvedat Gwadar on the 11th April ; but he declined to meet the Kalat Commissioner, refused to listen to evidence adduced by the Kalat2174 authorities in proof of their claims^ and even gave a different account of his latest instructions from that which had been supplied to Mr. Alison b j the Persian Government. Instead of being ready to ' visit the necessary places, 33 to prepare a map, and to co-operate in a suitable manner with General Goldsmid, he had,—according to a statement which he made to Major Euan Smith, General Goldsmid's Personal Assistant, at Chahbar, where he had embarked for Gwadar on the British gunboat ' Hugh Rose,^—onlv been authorised to visit certain specified places ; and, in point of fact, he refused to go anywhere but to Kaij. ' Even Kedj he would not visit unless it was evacuated by all the Khelat soldiers before his visit, and unless lie was accompanied by Ibrahim Khan, in whose persistent encroachments the boundary question originated 3) , On the 24th April, notwithstanding orders obtained from his Government that he should remain at Gwadar, he persisted in leaving that place for Chahbar, whence he had come ; and joint proceedings were thus finally rendered impossible. Mir Ma^sum Khan preferred unfounded charges against General Goldsmid which were afterwards referred by the Persian Ministry, m a memorandum, to the British Legation at Tehran ; but Her Majesty^s Government having signified displeasure at so unbecoming a step, the memorandum was withdrawn with excuses and professions of high re gard for General Goldsmid. The British Commissioner was accused of acting unfairly and in a way calculated to create disorder in tlie Persian Frontier districts, of having declared places admittedly Persian not to be so ] and of disturbing men^s minds by enquiring about the rights of Persia to other places indisputably hers. The object of the Persian Government in adopting these charges was, perhaps, only to bring about an adjournment of the proceedings in Makarn, in order that those in Sistan might be held first. In May 1871, General Goldsmid, who had then nearly compl^ the collection of information bearing on the actual status of the districts between Persia and Kalat in Makran, was directed by the Government of India to proceed to Makran with a map that had been P re ^ are&lt; ^ Captain Lovett under his orders ; and, after a visit to Karachi for purpose of obtaining further proofs of the title of Kalat to certain puted tracts, he betook himself to the Persian Capital, arriving ^ er before his Persian colleague on the Commission. Acceptance At Tehran strenuous discussions ensued, occupying the whole mo ^7 of August. On the 6th and again on the 20th of that month; Gen er Persian _ 0 government Goldsmid was admitted to personal audience of the Shan.(iZZo) 2175 progress was marked by His Majesty's abandonment, on the 13tli, of ^ ^ the Persian claims to Kaij and Gwadar; but he showed some anxiety proposed by in, before committing himself to acceptance of the boundary pro- bj Colonel Goldsmid, not only certain trifling modifications of with a the same, but also a general assurance on the part of the British Govern- ment that Kalat was an independent state and that the arrangements 4tli about to be made would affect only the Khan and his descendants, —in other words, apparently, that Britain herself was not directly interested in the settlement. Suspicion, in fact tinged the whole attitude of the Persian Government in the Kalat frontier question, it not being under stood bv them, perhaps, that what was desired by the British Indian authorities was to keep at a distance from India not Persian influence, but the Russian influence which might follow in its train. It having been pointed out that Kalat, though independent, was bound by a Treaty of 1854 to subordinate co-operation with the British Government and to abstention from negotiations with foreign powers unless with the British consent, the point seems to have been waived; and on the 4th September 1871, General Goldsmid's boundary was accepted in a letter addressed by the Persian Minister for Foreign to Mr. Alison, from which the following is an extract:— In obedience to His Majesty's orders I beg, in reply, most respectfully to state that the Persian Government, notwithstandinPf the clear right which it considered itself to have over Baluchistan, simply out of regard for the wishes of Her Britannic Majesty's Government that this question should be brought to a satisfactory conclusion by the definition of a boundary line, has hereby accepted Your Excellency's letter, and the map. The Persian Government now looks forward to tlie desirable results and important advantage which it expects from the British Government for this great act of compli ance and co-operation on the part of Persia, and awaits to see what will emanate from tlie suitable manner in which the matter will be represented through the good offices of Your Excellency, an experienced Minister, and a well-wisher perfectly cognisant of the whole details of the merits of the question. In the letter of the British Minister to which the above was a reply the line proposed for acceptance had been thus described :— Commencing from the northernmost point or that which is furthest from the sea, the territory of Khelat is bounded to the west by the large Persian district of Dizzuk, which is composed of many dehs or minor districts, those on the frontier being Jalk and Kallegan. Below these two last named is the small district of Kohak, which, together with Punjgnr, comprising Parum and other dependencies, is on the Khelat side of the frontier, while on the Persian side is Bumpusht. Below Panjgur, the frontier possessions of Khelat to the sea are Boleida, including Zaniiran and other dependencies, Mund, and Busht. Within the Persian line of frontier are the villages or tracts belonging to Sirbaz and Baho Dustyaree. The boundary of2176 Dualit is marked by a long line drawn through the Drabol Hill, situated between the rivers Baho and Dusht, to the sea in the Bay of Gwuttur. To summarise, Punjgur and Parum and other dependencies, withKohukj Boleida, including Zamiran and other dependencies; Mund, including Toomp, Naseerakd, Kedj, and all districts, dehs, and dependencies to the eastward; Duslit with its dependencies as far as the sea,—these names exhibit the line of actual possessionof Khelat, that is to say, all tracts to the east of the frontier of actual Persian possession, which frontier comprises Dizzak and Bumpusht, Sirbaz and Peshin, Baho and Dust- yaree. The acceptance by the Shah of General Goldsmid 3 s proposed line was qualified by a reservation^ or at least a representation, in regard to Kohak, which the Shah was very desirous should be included in Persia, General Goldsmid seems to have found no trace of either Persian or Kalat supremacy over Kohak^ and would apparently, if left to himself, have classed it as neutral and independent; but he was bound by the clear instructions of the Government of India, which bore that if the Persian Government can establish no claim to take their boundary to the east of Kohak, the line should be drawn to the west/' The British Commissioner accordingly threw the burden of proof on Persia, and, no evidence having been produced on her behalf, assigned Kohak to Kalat, London was chosen by the Persian Government as the best place for further discussion of the Kohak question, apparently from an idea that the Government of India were more adverse to concessions to Persia than Her Majesty's Government,—an idea which thus found expression in a memorandum presented by the Persian Minister in England. Votre Excellence me permettra de ne pas lui dissimuler que dans plus d'une circons- tance le Gouvernement de Sa Majeste Imperiale a rencontre en certains points do la part du Gouvernement des Indes une inflexibility qui semblait peu dictee du de'sir d'etre agreable a un Gouvernement ami, et qui aurait pu ledecourager dang I'oeuvrequ^ 1181 pas cesse de poursuivre aAec ardeur—celle de resserrer chaque jour de as en plu s ^ 0S bons rapports qui unissent nos deux pays. The matter was referred in England to Sir H. Rawlinson, formerly British Minister in Persia, who considered the question of Kohak intricsically unimportant and thought that ' it would be. • 1 ' to our advantage, if, without violating justice or giving 1 real offence t the Khan of Khelat, we could confer an obligation upon tbe Sbah 0^ Persia by modifying the Mekran frontier arrangement in his favour. Eventually, to meet His Majesty's wishes, the line forming the western boundary of Kalat was drawn to the east of Kohak; but no opinion was expressed &lt;c as to the position of the Persian, frontier ^ that 0112177 147 academic question whether K6liak was independent or a possession of p e rsia. Kohak was occupied by Persian Troops in 1874. In the letter proposing for the Shah's acceptance the line recom mended by General Goldsmid^ the British Minister in Persia had sug gested; in the following terms, the appointment of a Subsidiary Com mission for the actual delimitation of the frontier :—- The undersigned proposes, with the concurrence of the Persian Government, that, for purposes of future reference and identification, he shall obtain the services of an experienced English Officer of Engineers, who may meet an Officer duly appointed by the Government of Persia, and an officer from the Khelat State, so as to l\j down the more prominent landmarks and features of the actual line agreeably to the above description, and make a careful survey thereof for record. This sabsidinry Commission gliould meet as early as practicable in Gwuttur Bay, and proceed upwards from the boundary terminus between the rivers Baho and Dusht to Jalk or the neighbourhood, submitting the result of their work in the form of a map to the Representative of Her Britannic Majesty's Government and the Persian Government at Teheran. The Persian Government having agreed to this suggestion, Captain O.St. John, E.E., Acting Director of the Anglo-Persian Telegraphs, who would have accompanied General Goldsmid as his technical assistant in 1870 if his services could have been spared, was appointed to cany out the work of delimitation on the part of the British Govern ment. The Persian representative was a youth named Mirza Ashraf AH, dubbed 'Sarhang for the occasion, who possessed a fair know ledge of map and plan drawing, but was content to copy and adopt the results of Captain St. John^s survey. The representative of Klata failed to appear. Captain St. John started from Gwadar on the 22nd January and reached Jalk on the 13th March 1872. His proceedings mostly lay beyond the region with which this book is concerned; but his description of Ibrahim Khan of Bampur, who now possessed the title of Sartip may be quoted : The redoubtable ruler of Bam-Narmashir and Baluchistan is a short punchy man, of any age from forty-five to sixty, with a full and well-dyed beard, and small sharp e ye. He speaks Persian with the broad southern twang, and uses provincialisms not very easy to understand by any accustomed only to the conversation of educated foen. My experience in out-of-the-way parts of Fars, however, enabled me to get on him pretty well, but our conversation was confined to generalities, and the examination of fire-arms. To our breechloaders he made the usual objection of the difficulty of obtaining cartridges. There seemed nothing in his talk or in his face to indicate the really superior man he must be, not only as having risen to his present position by sheer merit, unaided by money or interest, but as ha- ing reduced one of 6 most turbulent countries in Asia to a state of order and tranquillity, comparing not only with most of his own country but with many native states further2178 east. Lucky would it be for his people and ours on the Sindfrontier, if His fcgluiess Kbudadad of Kalat had Ibrahim Khan's head on his shoulders, * Annexation of Chahbar to Persia 1872, The circumstances in which Chahbar was captured by Sartip Ibrahim Khan of Bampur in February 1872 ; and so passed permanently into the possession of Persia^ need not be described here. A.n account of them will be found in an Annexure to the chapter on the history of the 'Oman Sultanate^ where it is more appropriately placed, as the place was a dependency of Masqat at the time of its fall, and its loss to Masqat was occasioned largely by dissensions in the ruling family of ; 0maii. During the decade following the annexation of Chahbar to Persia little occurred to draw external attention to the affairs of Persian Makran, and to the end of the reign of Nasir-ud-Din Shah such events as were reported from that province were of local importance only. General Persian Administration, 1872—1896. Goverror- From about 1880 till 1891, or longer, His Royal Highness the Nasir- ^fKinn^ ud-Dauleh was Governor-General of Kir man, in which province Bampur 1880-91. and with it Persian Makran were included. The Prince-Governor, who possessed in the later years of his rule the title of Farman-Tarma; made a tour to Chahbar early in 1883. His administration appears to have been vigorous, though much disturbed by the insubordination of local chiefs. One of its principal incidents was the treacherous seizure, in 1891) of various turbulent tribal leaders, some of whom the Prince caused to blown from guns and put to death in other ways. Governorship or about May 1882 Sartip Ibrahim Khan was removed from X8?2—96 ^, Governorship of Bampur, which he had filled with muchdistinctio^ # Goldsmith's Eastern Persia, pages 77-78. In the same book (pages be found Captain Euan Smith's account of Ibrahim Khan : ' This fam ou3 c ^ quite a despot in these regions, was a little squat stumpy man, very stoat ana rou j with a good-natured face, a pair of piercing eyes, and an unusually loDg» t0 and silky beard. Probably aboat 50 years of age, he looked much yoangei'» oWlllo did the jet black dye of his abundant hair. Though evidently fall of vivacity, W little to initiate conversation. His Persian was very difficalt to and ^tand, mixed with Baluch, and he talked very quickly, clipping bis words at the sa^e W'2179 for twenty years or more; his removal, as will be seen hereafter, was not unconnected with representations made by the British Legation at Tehran^ His immediate successor was one Wali Khan, but in the spring of 1883 Sartip Sulaiman Khao, a Persian, was in power at Bampur. Later in 1883 or possibly in 1884, Sartip Ibrahim Khan was reinstated in the Governorship ; and immediately, from all the districts under his charge, reports began to be received of distress and of emigration on a large scale to Masqat, India, and elsewhere. He died, however, in May 1884, and his death was quickly followed by a general return of the emigrants to their homes. In 1887 a certain ^Abdul Fat-h Khan was appointed Governor of 1887-89, Bampur. His rule was distinguished by unparalleled atrocities, of many of which his brother Mohsin Khan was the instrument. In 1889^ the Shah being then absent in Europe, the exasperation of the Baluch tribes had been raised to such a pitch by his conduct, that most of the chiefs rebelled and besieged him in a fort near Bampur. Having been cap tured by them he was deposed by order of the Regent, the Amin-ul- Mulk, on information supplied by the British Legation, and was tem porarily a prisoner at Kirman. The insurgent chiefs, whom the local British authorities had done their best to restrain by friendly advice, remained for a time in possession of Bampur. The next Governor of Bampur was a certain Zain-ul-^Abidin Khan, 1890 -97 who seems to have had a hand in the fall of Abdul Fat-h Khan, and who retained his position until 1897. Affairs of the Jashk and Biyaban districts, 1872—1896. After the formation of the Gulf Ports administrative charge, about Persian ad- „ , „ ministration 1887, Jashk and all the places dependent on it were transferred trom 0 f j a8hk an( i the jurisdiction of the Governor-General of Kirman to that of the Governor of the Gulf Ports; but the exact time of the transfer is un certain. Previously to this, in 1884, Biyaban seems to have been detached temporarily from the Jashk chiefdom, in which perhaps it was usually included, and conferred on one Saiyid Nasim. In 1886 a Persian Deputy-Governor, in the person of one Nasr Ullah 18S6-87. Khan, was appointed to Jashk. The short period distinguished by general self-assertiveness on the part of the Persian authorities in the Persian Gulf had now begun. In the summer of 1887 a patrol of 100 Persian soldiers under Muhammad Kazim arrived from Mdbar at Jashk, W(A2180 1S89-90. 1893-94 Internal history of JSshk and B'yahan, 1891-96. J 888. where it was intended ^ that half of them should remain as a permanent guard ; but the difficulty of rationing them proved excessive^ and they were sent away and local levies substituted. In October 1887 mucli wilful damage was done to the British telegraph in the neighbourhood of Jashk, but the reason seemed to be the hostility of the people to the new Persian authorities. In the same year Mir ^Abdun Nabi and Mir ^Ali, the chiefs between whom the J ashk district was divided^ were made prisoners by the Persians and removed at first to Tehran. It was be lieved that a secret friendship with the British with which they were credited was the cause of their being thus severely treated. Mir Aliwas released in June 1888^ but Mir ''Abdun Nabi languished in detention at Bushehr and Bandar Abbas for two years longer. In February 1888 the Malik-ut-Tujjar, whose influence flourished under the Amin-us-Sultan^s Government from ^Arabistan to Makran, visited Jashk with Persian troops; and the Persian flag was hoisted and saluted there. This ceremony may have marked the formal inclusion of Jashk in the Gulf Ports. In February 1889 ; by which time Jashk must certainly have come under the jurisdiction of Bushehr, the Sa^ad-ul-Mulk^ Governor of the Gulf Ports, came to Jashk in the ce Persepolis. , ■' Mir ^Abdun Nabi was with him, but was not allowed to land. A detachment of 20 Persian soldiers was posted at J ashk about the same time. It was stated that a payment of 4,000 Qrans and substantial security for his future good behaviour had been required of Mir ^Abdun Nabi; and in 1890, perhaps on satisfying these demands, he was released. In 1893 or 1894 an affray took place at Jashk between some fishermen, whose cause was espoused by the general population of the place, and the Persian military detachment. The latter were besieged in their fort. on the British Assistant Superintendent of Telegraphs promising to report the matter to superior authority, the fishermen and their allies drew off. The result of the British officials report was the removal of the Persian Deputy-Governor, Ghulam Riza Baig, and the substitution for him of a Persian Military officer. In July 1891 Mir ; Abdun Nabi, one of the chiefs of Jashk and BiySban, began to levy extraordinary taxes on grain and dates, on the plea that the contractors for the revenue of the district had not paid him his dues; and the Governor of the Gulf Ports despatched the Naibs of Shamil and Minab i^ 0 Jashk with a force, said to be 2,000 strong, to capture him and recover the revenue. The expedition was a failure; but Jashk, deserted by MiVAbdun Nabi, was placed in charge of the Persian Deputy Governor of'tzzi 2181 'Abbas. In January 1892 Mir 'Abdun Nabi reappeared in the district, displaced the agents of the Deputy Governor of Bandar -'Abbas after some desultory fighting, and again began to collect taxes to the great dissatis faction of the people^ especially in Biyaban^ which district the Persian authorities now conferred on Mir Haji, son of Mir Yusuf^ 'Abdun Nabi's leading opponent there. In August 1893 Mir ''Abdun Nabi, assisted by Shaikh Hasan, Naib or Zabit of Minab, attacked with a large force at Surag the small Tahirzai tribe of Khotak; the losses on either side were slight; and the tribe paid 400 Tumans for pardon and permission to reside at Khotak^ but subsequently removed to Bashakard. Serious disturbances arose in the neighbourhood of Jashk in 1894 in consequence of the death of a son of Mir ^li, joint chief of Jashk and Biyaban, shot by dependents of Mir 'Abdun Nabi in a fray that arose out of a dispute about camels. Both parties had recourse to the British telegraph authorities at Jashk, from whom Mir 'Air's party even tried unsuccessfully to oltain ammunition; and the arrest of Mir ; Abdun Nahi was ordered by the Persian authorities, but could not be effected. Subsequently the contending chiefs were summoned to Bandar ^Abbas; but Mir ^Abdun Nabi was attacked by enemies on the way there, several men being killed in the fight which ensued^ whereupon he refused to continue his journey. The Persian officials then announced that he had been deprived of the chiefship of Jashk in favour of Mir Haji, who had already supplanted him in Biyaban; but this settlement seems to have been nominal, or at best partial. In April 1895 several Baluch leaders met at Jashk with large followings to demand the appointment of a responsible chief over the whole Jashk district, and much excitement at first prevailed, hut it was allayed by assurances that, whatever was done, their wishes would be considered by the Persian Deputy-Governor of Jashk. Nothing more was heard of Mir ^Abdun Nabi until bis death, which occurred in December 1895. He was succeeded by his son Mir Mustafa. British interests at Jashk, 1872—1896. ijantt Cases involving British interests from time to time arose at Jashk in ^sequence of the existence of a British telegraph station there after 1868 ^ of the presence of an Indian military guard from 1878 to 1887. In May 1884 five sepoys of the military guard were fired on, while out Sepoy's casc walkino- na ^Y e g 0 £ country and were robbed of some money.2182 Anglo- Persian Agreement concerning the limits of, and jurisdiction in the Jashk telegraph Station, 25th February 1887. Mr. Sealy,'tlie Assistant Superintendent in charge of Jaslik ; was able at once to recover part of the money taken through a clerk of Mir ^Ahdun Nabi, that chief being at the time absent from Jashk; and the balance was paid up by 'Abdun Nabi on his return. In 1886 difficulties arose from the exercise of jurisdiction by Persian Officials in the British telegraph station at Jashk. The past history of the question was investigated; and it was found that^ soon after the opening of the Station^ in consequence of frequent petty annoyances caused by Baluch tribesmen and their chiefan arrangement had been made between the British political authorities and Haji Ahmad Khan, then Deputy-Governor of Bandar ^Abbas, whereby, after the spot had been examined by a Commission of Persian officers a line was drawn from the creek on the west side of the peninsula to the sea on the east to mark the boundary of the station, within which no interference by chiefs or collec tion of customs duty was to be permitted in future. This local under standing was violated in IB86 by the newly arrived Deputy-Governor, Nasr Ullah Khan, who took up a position within the limits of the station and began to collect customs on provisions imported by the tele graph staff for their own consumption and that of their servants, and otherwise to make himself obnoxious. The people of the country also proceeded to plant date palms round the station well, the supply of water from which was very scanty ; but most of the trees were removed at the request of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. About the same time the Shah, in consequence of alarming reports received from a French merchant and intriguer about the Indian military detachment at tlashk and the British position there generally, showed reluctance to grant a railway concession which was being solicited through the British Legation at Tehran ; and it was resolved that some regular arrangement in regard to the telegraph station should be made. It was settled that the Indian military guard should be withdrawn by the British authoii ties, the Persian Government on their part removing Nasr Ullah Khan and that a formal agreement as to the limits and immunities of the sta tion should be concluded. The Agreement which resulted was dated 25th February 1887, ^ the following were its principal provisions that the local Persian o ci should exercise no authority within the limits of the station, which ^ el defined in the Agreement; that the well and the road and water cnan connecting it with the station should be protected from interfered that the custom house and other buildings to be erected by the Government should be located outside the station at a place to he se2183 .,; jjy local arrangement; that the members of the telegraph staff and ersons genuinely employed by i them as servants should be exempt from customs duty, this privilege not to extend to shopkeepers in the station; that no dues should be levied on supplies entering the station from the interior; if ^ or consumption of the telegraph establishment ; and finally, that sanctuary or protection against the Persian authorities should not be afforded by the telegraph officials to local Persian subjects other than persons actually in their service. In April 1887 Nasar Ullah Khan was removed from Jashk in accord ance with the understanding that preceded the Agreement, being suc ceeded as Deputy-Governor by Hidayat Khan, a conciliatory personage, who did not remain long and who was followed by Mirza ^Ali Khan, an official of similar temper. The Indian military detachment was also removed, and it was at first proposed to replace it by a guard of ^0 Indian police ; but ultimately local levies were engaged. It may be noted that the boundary of the station, as actually marked out afterwards, did not agree* in every respect with the indications contained in the Agreement; but the deviation was apparently acquiesced in by the local Persian authorities, and neither at the time nor at any later date did it give rise to dispute. In 1889, soon after the departure of the Sa'ad-ul-Mnlk, Governor of Question of the Gulf Ports from Jashk, the wife of a boatman who was employed by ^defthe 11 the telegraph staff and had his residence in the station was seized, when Agreement, outside the boundary, dragged to the Persian Deputy-Governors house, and there—it was said—ill-treated. The reason was a quarrel between ker and the wife of the Deputy-Governor's clerk, who also resided in the telegraph station. This case became the subject of a correspondence between the Political Resident at Bushehr and the British Minister at Tehran; but, the former (Colonel Ross) having pointed out that juris diction over Persian subjects, even in the telegraph station, could not be claimed by British officials under the Agreement of 1887, it was apparently allowed to drop, lest representations in regard to the woman^s treatment should give rise to inconvenient discussions of principle. 1 See Aitchisbn's Treaties, 4th edition, volume XII, pages 96—97, and Volume II 0 f this Gazetteer, article ' Kew Jashk,' page 915, footnote. From the latter it will ^Ppear that the directions as to boundary given in the Agreement were, in part at least, reconcile with actual distances on the spot.2184 Affairs of the districts east of Jashk, 1872—1896. Fragmentary information only is available in regard to events in the districts to the east of Jashk during the period following the appro priation of Chahbar by Persia; and the events themselves were confused and of no great significance. In 1881, the first year of which there is anything to relate; Gaili ; including the coastal tract known as Qiblah, seems to have been held by a chief named Mir Hoti; Qasrkand^ to which Sarbaz was attached; by one Mir Mauladad, son of Jan Muhammad; Dashtyari, now comprise ing Chahbar, by Mir Din Muhammad; and Bahu by Mir Muhammad Ali. The chief feature of the political situation was an intense enmity between Mir Din Muhammad of Dashtyari and Sardar Husain Khan, a man of influence in Gaih, favoured by Sartip Ibrahim Khan ; Governor of Bampur ; whose lieutenant he had been at the capture of Chahbar. Sardar Hussain Khan had a brother, Chakar Khan, also a person of some consequence, who resided at Fanoch. Mir Mauladad of Qasrkand, having married a daughter of Mir Din Muhammad, belonged to his faction; and there was therefore enmity between Husain Khan and Mauladad also. Apparently in 1881 Sartip Ibrahim Khan, who had a grudge against Mir Din Muhammad on account of having failed to seize him and extort money from him, as he had done at one time or another to most of the other local chiefs, instigated Sardar Husain Khan to invade Dashtyaii; which he did, nothing loath; and Mir Din Muhammad sought safety in flight. Sardar Husain Khan was helped in his operations by 'Abdullah Khan, a son of Din Muhammad, who had been on bad terms with his father for many years and consequently without means of subsistence; this individual indicated to Husain Khan the people of the country f^ 0111 whom money could best be wrung. Husain Khan, on returning to the interior, installed ^Abdullah Khan as Deputy Governor of Chahbai J the latter could not maintain order in the town or its environs; aI1( ^ J 118 manners were offensive and his charges exorbitant, especially to British Indian traders. On the departure of Husain Khan, Mir Din Muhammad returned to Dashtyari and resumed his position as chief without opposi' tion, Abdullah Khan simultaneously disappearing from Chahbar. British Indian subjects being among the victims of Husain Khan 6 rapacity, the raid on Dashtyari led to representations by Her Britannic2186 Minister at Tehran, in consequence o£ which Sarfcip Ibrahim - wa s in 1882/ temporarily removed from the Government o£ Bampur ^transferred to that of Rudbar and Bashakard, while Sardar Husain Khan was said to have been imprisoned and made to disgorge his spoil. , T]ie pretex t for the invasion, possibly a true one, was non-payment by Qg A ^ pi n Muhammad of the revenue due by him to the Persian Government. In 1882 Mir Muhammad 'Ali of Bahu, of whom Rs. 5,000 a year 1882. W as demanded, having failed to raise more than Es. 4,800 or to obtain a reduction, though he visited Bampur in person, resigned the chiefship of his district and retired to Gwatar. Thereupon Mir Mauladad of Qasrkand came down to Bahu, and, with the help of A'zam Khan, a brother of Muhammad 'Ali, collected a considerable sum from the inhabitants, with which he returned to Qasrkand, A'zam Khan accom panying him. He had promised to set A'zam Khan up as chief of Bahu, but failed to keep this engagement, whereupon Sardar Husain Khan, flho was A^zam Khan's maternal uncle, invaded his principality, made Mm a prisoner, and extorted from him the money he had realised m Bahu. Mir Mauladad was liberated on payment of a heavy fine, to which his father-in-law, Mir Din Muhammad of Dashtyari, contributed Rs. 1,000. In 1888, Husain Khan being still in possession of Qasrkand, of which 1883. he had deprived Mauladad, a fine of 6,000 Tumans was inflicted on Mir Din Muhammad by the Prince Governor of Kirman, apparently as a punishment for having allowed British Indian subjects in Dashtyari and at Chahbar to complain of having been robbed by Husain Khan and ; Abdullah Khan in 1881. On an appeal by the chief the matter was reported by the Resident in the Persian Gulf to the British Legation at Tehran; but Mir Din Muhammad, before being released, had been obliged to give two of his sons as hostages and to produce as sureties foi payment of the fine Sardar Husain Khan of Qasrkand and Mir Hoti of Gaih; and in order to raise the money required of him he had to undertake a begging tour to Masqat, and even to Sind. Bahu was at this time almost depopulated as the result of fiscal exactions, failure of rain, and the collapse of an embankment on which the irrigation of the district depended and a reduction of the annual revenue of the district was promised V His Eoyal Highness the Nasir-ud-Dauleh on a tour to Chahbar. There Was also hostility between Mir Muhammad 'Ali of Bahu and Mir Din Muhammad of Dashtyari, the latter claiming Gwatar from the former, Major Mockler, the Assistant Political Agent at Gwatar, was induced b y Mir Muhammad 'Ali to go with him to the Prince Governor and2186 explain that Gwatar had belonged to Bahu for ten years at least; but His Royal Highness disregarded Major Mockler's representations and almost immediately placed 'Abdi Khan, a son of Mir Din Muliammad, in charge of Gwafcar. The assessment of Dashtyari and Bahu jointly, which in 1865 was Rs.5,000 a year, had since been raised to Es. 15,000, Rs. 10,000 for Dashtyari and Rs. 5,000 for Bahu ; bnt it must be remem bered that the receipts of the Chahbar customs had since 187^ gone to swell the income of the Dashtyari chief. In 1886 the state of Bahu was lamentable, owing to excessive taxa tion of the people by Mir Muhammed ^Ali under severe pressure from the Persian authorities. Gwata was forsaken by its inhabitants, most of whom removed to Kalat territory. 1887, ^ ie nex ^ J ear Dashtyari was still governed by Mir Din Muham mad ; Mir Mauladad had recovered Qasrkand from Sardar Husain Khan; and in Gaih, on the death of Mir Hoti in July 1887, his son Saiyid Muhammad had succeeded to the chiefship. The people of Gwatar had returned to their homes, and the place seemed to have regained its former comparative prosperity. In 1888 Sardar Husain Khan was dismissed by the Governor of Bampur from the chiefship of Gaih, which he had usurped or to wbich he had been appointed in supersession of Saiyid Muhammad: the osten* sible cause of his removal was failure to protect the British telegraph Hue- Saiyid Muhammad was reinstated. 1890-91 Chahbar, which was held by Mir Din Muhammad of Dashtyari, was taken from him in 1890 and conferred on Sardar Husain Khan, tut that restless individual was among the Baluch chiefs seized in the follow ing year by the Prince Governor of Kirman on a charge of sedition. He was imprisoned^and three of his adherents were blown from guns Princess orders. 18941—96, Mir Din Muhammad of Dashtyari died in 1894 and was by his son ; Abdi Khan; but ^ Abdi Khan's position was disputed by ^ brother Mahmud Khan, and fighting ensued. In January 1896 it wai reported that 2,000 people had emigrated from the district, and t e British Indian traders of Chahbar complained that their trade was ruine • 1888.

Several British Indian subjects were sufferers by the incursion of British Sardar Husain Khan into Dashtyari and the subsequent misrule of ^t Chahbar ^ Abdullah Khan at Chahbar in 1881 ; and, on the representations of andm^_^ the British Legation at Tehran, a Persian official named Zain-ul-''Abidin iggl—83.' was specially deputed to Makran to investigate their claims to compen- sation. This agent left Chahbar on the ^nd June 1882 ; promising to remit an indemnity of Rs. 3,396 within 20 days ; but he did not do so, and it became necessary to remind the Persian Government. The Governor -General of Kirman visited Chahbar in February 1883, where he met Major Mockler, Assistant Political Agent, Gwadar, and offered to compromise the case by a payment of Rs. 2,000. The proposal was accepted by Major Mockler on behalf of the complainants, whereupon the Prince withdrew it and quitted Chahbar without making any settlement. The true amount of compensation due was then reported by Major Mockler to be Rs. 3,841 ; and the Persian Government, on being again approached by the British Minister at Tehran, directed their local officials to pay this amount. Arrangements were eventually made for the satisfaction of the claims ; but the actual time and manner of their adjustment are not recorded. It was apparently in connection with this case that Mir Din Muhammad of Dashtyari incurred the displea sure of His Royal Highness the Nasir-ud-Dauleh and was fined 6,000 Tumans, as already related, In September 1883 a British Indian trader named Khojah 'Ali Bakhsh expired suddenly in Bahu territory. The circumstances of his case in Balm, death were somewhat suspicious, and the property which he had in his possession at the time was seized by Mir ; Abdun Nabi, a local notable. Mir Muhammad ^Ali, the hereditary chief of the district, was absent, taving gone to Kirman to protest against the recent invasion of Bahu by Mir Mauladad of Qasrkand. Representations were made to the Persian Government at Tehran with the result that in August 1885, after much delay, Es. 408 was paid by Mir ^AbdunNabi to a brother of the deceased Khojab ; Ali Baksh. About 1884 a British subject in Gaih, originally a Hindu and named British SW Singh, but who had become a Muhammadan some 18 years pre- case in Gaib, vlously in order to marry a Muhammadan woman, was plundered and ill-treated, Satisfaction was obtained through the authorities* About 1884 a slave named Doshambi escaped from Parag in Gaih made his way to Karachi.

Demands for his release were addressed to the chief of Gaih and to the central Persian Government; and even tually the former, Mir Hoti, on receipt of stringent orders through the Governor-General of Kirman, sent his son to Chahbar to liberate the man.

Tlie explanation was that the chief of Dizak, imprisoned by the Persian author ities for non-payment of revenue, bad, after inducing the Hindu to become surety for payment and after conveying to him titles to certain date plantations and millet seed, repudiated the whole transaction. The local Persian officials sought to justify their action in the case; hut a reference to the central Persian Government at Tehran resulted, in December 1888, in the payment of Rs. 8,000 to Dharmu. British official matters in Persian Makran, 1848—1896. British political supervision of Persian Makrah affairs, 1863—06. Britisti military detachment at Jaskh, 1878—87. British political supervision over affairs in Persian Makran was exer cised from 1863 to 1879 through an Assistant Political Agent at Gwadar, and after 1879, through a native Agent at that place, who was generally under the orders of the Director of Persian Gulf telegraphs at Karachi. The affairs of the Gwadar Agency, it being situated outside Persian Makran, belong to the history of the ^Oman Sultanate, in an Annexure to the chapter on which an account of them will be found. It was decided in 1877 that a small Indian military guard should be posted at Jashk for the protection of the telegraph station, and the strength originally prescribed was 12 men. There was a difficulty about accommodation^ at Jashk, however, not overcome until the end of 1878, when temporary huts were erected. In 1879, in consequence of the transfer from Basidu, for reasons of health, of the bulk of a company of the 21st Native Infantry sent there in the previous year, as mentioned in the history of the Persian Coast and Islands, the size of the Jashk guard was increased greatly beyond what had been at first intended. Successive reductions in the British Agency guard at Gwadar m 1880, bment at the superfluous men being withdrawn to Jashk, raised the detad the latter place to about 90 rifles, a strength at which it vt- , „ „ constant until its complete removal in 1887 in deference to the wishes o2189 lisll;,!, Telegraph subsidies and other fiieShah, as already described. In 1881 the maiiitenance of permanent arters occupied by the guard was undertaken by the Public Works department. have already had occasion to notice the conclusion by Colonel Goldsmid in 1B69 of arrangements with the principal chiefs of Persian M'irran • bv these they pledged themselves to protect the telegraph line telegraph juaKicm &gt; j . . ijiii im-i matters, and to render aid and certain special services to the telegraph otticials. 1868—94 The subsidy allotted to the chief of Gaih was Rs. 3,000 a year, and the region for which he was responsible was described as ext ending from Chahbarto Sadaich. The chiefs of Dashtyari and Bahu, who were included in one Agreement, received Rs. 1,000 a year each, and the extent of their responsibility was from Chahbar to the Kalat frontier. The subsidies were made payable from the 1st January 1869 in half-yearly instalments. Similar arrangements were concluded with the chiefs of Jashk, but the allowances given them were smaller.t In 1873 a nephew of Mir ^Abdun Nabi, chief of Jashk, was arrested 1873. 'for climbing a telegraph pole but a party of Baluch came and released him by force. The Assistant Political Agent, Gwadar, then sent for Mir 'Abdun Nabi ; and, as he refused to appear, his subsidy was provisionally stopped. The case must have been in some way im portant, for orders were obtained from the Persian Central Government that the Deputy-Governor of Bandar ^Abbas should warn Mir ; Abdun Nabi and his people against damaging telegraph property : possibly the chief had given vent to threats. The revolutions that often convulsed the interior and sometimes affect- 1881—82. ed the coast of Persian Makran occasioned, from time to time, doubts as to the proper recipients of the telegraph subsidies. Thus in 1881, when Mir Din Muhammad was driven out of Dashtyari, and in the following year, when Mir Muhammad Ali unwillingly resigned charge of Bahu, claims were advanced by the usurpers of their places to the subsidies which the rightful chiefs had enjoyed. It would seem that these claims were coldly received, and it does not appear that the subsidies were ever paid to any but the two chiefs mentioned, who before long recovered the hereditary positions from which they had been ousted. * It was made payable, in the first instance, to the widow of the late chief, Mir Abdullah. t The text of the Gaih and Dashtyari-Bahu Agreements will be found in Aitchison's Treaties, 4th edition, Vol. XI, (Baluchistan^, pages 235-36. An account of Jashk Agreement is given in the Official History of the MeTcran Telegraph Ike, page 97,2190 1883. As an instance of the working of the subsidy system^ it may be mentioned that the allowance of Mir Hoti^ chief of Gaih, for the first half-year of 1883 was placed in deposit instead of being paid to him, because he had taken no steps to punish Musa, a telegraph line guard and subject of his who had absconded with Rs. 636 belonging to the Government of India^ most of which remained unrecovered ; and because he had failed to pay up Rs. 144 due on account of camels, etc., stolen from line guards in his district. The chief was at first told that he must punish Musa and recover the balance of the missing property before any of the subsidy in deposit was paid him ; but subsequently as he represented that the Persian authorities were pressing him for money, the Resident agreed that he might be given Rs. 1,000 out of the instalment due, the remainder (Rs. 500) only being withheld until he had procured or given satisfaction. 1888. An attempt was made in 1888 by the Persian Governor of Bampurto divert one of the local telegraph subsidies to his own coffers. Having dismissed Sardar Husain Khan from the chief ship of Gaih, he in May informed the British authorities of the fact and of the appointment, instead of Husain Khan, of Saiyid Muhammad, heir to the chief ship of Gaih, and of Mir Mauladad, chief of Qasrkand, as revenue collectors. A request was added that the balance of the Gaih subsidy due might be sent him through Saiyid Muhammad. This claim was the more unsustainable that the Persian Government already received, under the Convention of 1868, a payment of 3,000 Tumans a year on account of the Makran telegraph; and Colonel Ross, the Resident in the Persian Government, held strongly that the subsidy must be paid to the local chief direct, not to the Persian Governor, the only question being who should be consider ed the local chief. The Resident, after ascertaining that Saiyi Muhammad had in fact been recognised as chief of Gaih by the Persian authorities, directed that the Gaih subsidy should be paid to him. 1894. In tlie same manner, in 1894, on an intimation that Mir Hoti had been appointed chief of Jashk in place of Mir ^Abdun Nabi, the subsi y which had been held by the latter was transferred to his successor.

The Persian Governorship of Bampur was retained by Zain-ul-^Abidin, appointed in 189^ until 1897, when he was removed and one Sulaiman Khan temporarily appointed in his place. General misgovernment and over taxation by Zain-ul-^Abidin, had contributed to bring about a general insurrection, which will later be described; and, the safety of British subjects and of the British telegraph having been seriously endangered by the rising, representations were made by the Hon'ble C. Hardinge, His Britannic Majesty's Charge d'Affaires at Tehran, which led to his recall. In 1900—1902 tuc Governor of Bampur was a certain Hashim Khan,whose Government was corrupt, and who failed to maintain any semblance of order, Hashim Khan was followed by Mustafa Quli Khan (1902-03), WaliKhan (1904), and the Zahir-us-Sultan (1905). In 1901 an attempt was made by the Imperial Persian Customs to establish a post at Tank on the coast of the Gaih district, but it was opposed by the inhabitants and was not persisted in. At North Jashk, however, a post was duly inaugurated in 1902, and in the same year the customs of Chahbar and Gwatar, previously farmed to Indian contractors, were taken over by the Persian Government. Governorship of Bampur, 1896—1905. Imperial Persian Customs, 1901-02. Administration and internal history of the districts of Persian Makran, 1896—1905. The chiefs of the Jashk district in 1899 were Mir ''Ali and Mir Mustafa, son of Mir 'Abdun Nabi, the former controlling the territory to the west, the latter that to the east of Jagin. Mir ^Ali died on the 1st May 1900 and was succeeded by his son Mir Hoti, who was a distant cousin of Mir Mustafa. In 1904 Mir Mustafa was actively assisted by a younger brother, Mir Barkat, in his administrative duties. In 1905 Mir Barkat represented the interests of his family in Biyaban, events in which district during the period are noticed in the chapter on the history of the Persian Coast and Islands. An annual tribute of 12 camels which had formerly been paid by the chiefs of Jashk to the Governor of the Gulf Ports had by this time been discontinued, apparently in consequence of the construction of a Persian fort at New Jashk, for the care and upkeep of which the chiefs were made ^sponsible. Jashk district, 1896—1905.2192 Gaih district, 1896—1905. Qasrkand district, 1896—1905. Dashtyari district, 1896—1905. The Jashk district also continued to enjoy an exemption of ing from payment of any ordinary revenue to the Persian Government. At the beginning of the period Sardar Husain Khan seems to have been chief of Gaih ; but in 1898, in circumstances which will be explained further on^ he was superseded by Mir Mauladad of Qasrkand and his own son Sa^id Khan^ whom the Persian authorities appointed joint chiefs of Gaih. This arrangement was evidently found unworkable and Sa^id Khan eventually became sole chief. In 1902 Sa^id Khan was displaced in favour of Mohim Khan, the son of Mir Hoti, a former chief of the district; but, having visited Kirman and spent some months there, not voluntarily it would seem, he was allowed in 1903, to resume the chiefship of Gaih on a greatly enhanced assessment. His first act on his return to power was to plunder and destroy property belonging to the adherents of Mohim Khan; and, as the revenue for which he bad made himself responsible could not be recovered by usual means, he had recourse to a practice of moving about the country with a large armed retinue, to extort money. His followers committed unheard of oppres sions, and inhabitants of the district even began to be sold by the chief as slaves. By these means Sa^id Khan became the strongest and most feared chief in Persian Makran ; but a general exodus of the population rendered his financial responsibilities increasingly hard to meet. In 1905, instead of visiting the southern part of his dominions himself, he sent his nephew Islam Khan to collect the taxes on his behalf. At midnight on the 22 'nd June 1899 Mauladad Khan, chief of Qasrkand, was assassinated at Bampur, while sleeping in Persian Governors house. The actual murderer was captured and executed, but it was suspected that the crime had been instigated by Husain Khan of Gaih. Jan Muhammad, a son of the deceased, at first succeeded to the chiefship of Qasrkand; but about a year later it was taken from him and conferred on Sardar Sa^id Khan of Gaih, in whose possession it thereafter remained. In 1898, Mir 'Abdi Khan, the chief of Dashtyari, was imprisoned by the Persian authorities at Kirman, charge of his district being handed over to Mauladad Khan of Qasrkand. 'Abdi Khan was released, however, after being detained for about a year, and returned to Dash tyari in May 1899. A claim to part of the district was maintained by ; Abdi Khan brother Mahmud Khan, who was of stronger character, hasty in temp 61 ^ quick in action, commanding both respect and fear, and who enjoye moreover the favour of Sa'id Khan, chief of Gaih, who was hie cousin-2193 148 Mutual raids by the brothers kept Dashtyari in a constant turmoil, and even the interests of British subjects were affected. In 1902 Sa ; id Khan, baving been appointed by the Persian Governor of Banxpur to be ruler over Dashtyari; nominated Mahmud Khan as his deputy on the g pot Mahmud Khan greatly abused the power thus entrusted to him; he destroyed the property of his brother Mir ''Abdi Khan^ who was forced to take refuge at Chahbar, he committed various murders by w ay of enforcing respect for his authority^ and he behaved generally in gu ch a manner that Dashtyari was quickly forsaken by most of its inhabitants. In 1904 an accommodation was reached between the brothers, who became virtually joint chiefs, and the state of the district then greatly improved. It was reported, with reference to the year 1905, that the annual revenue of Pashtyari was about Rs. 10,000 and was paid to the Persian Government through the chief of Gaih; also that Mir ^Abdi and Mir Mahmud, of whom the former had gone on pilgrimage, were both much more popular with their subjects than the chiefs of the adjoining districts with theirs. Bahu was ruled in 1899 by Mir Ashraf Khan, a son of the former chief Mir Muhammad ^Ali, who was by this time dead. In 1902, the chief of Gaih was invested with charge of Bahu as well as of Dashtyari and selected as his local deputy, Mir Ashraf having proved a weak ruler, a cousin of the latter named Mir Ahmad Khan. This individual obtained his appointment on the understanding that he should pay Sa^id Khan Rs. 3,000 on account of arrears, and that the annual revenue of the district should be increased by Bs. 1,500; but, though he treated Ms people with the greatest harshness, he was unable to fulfil his contract. After this Bahu was governed by Mir Ashraf and Mir Ahmad jointly and was reduced by misrule, aided by scarcity, from a prosperous district to a poverty-stricken and almost uninhabited waste. Many of the inhabitants emigrated to India, settling for the most part at Karachi. In 1903 two thriving communities, one of Maids on the coast and another of Lattis in the interior, were driven out of Bahu, of which they had been the financial mainstay. After being plundered at ^watar, the Maids, who were fishermen, removed to Jiwnri; but Mir Ahmad Khan, having obtained the connivance of the Nazim of Makran, pursued them thither with his exactions, obliging them to seek an as yluna at Gwadar. The Lattis, who were cattle owners and cultivators, ^und it necessary to emigrate to Palairi in the Gwadar district, where * of them settled.2194 In 1905 the annual assessment of Balm was about Rs. 6,000 ; but nothing had been paid to the Persian Government for some years. In September of that year the chiefs were summoned to Bampur, whence Mir Ahmad Khan was allowed to return home for the purpose of collecting the revenue in arrear, while Mir Ashraf Khan was detained by the Persian Governor as security for its payment. General history of Persian Makran, 1896-1905, In 1896-1897 disorder became generally prevalent in Persian Makran ; it appeared to be due partly to the death of Nasir-ud-Din Shah, concerning whom there was a local prophecy that he would be the last of his line, partly to the departure the Farman-Farma, who had govern ed the Kirman province with considerable strength for a number of years, partly to distress caused by scarcity and overtaxation, and partly to other causes. It was thought by some authorities that the tribal rising on the North-West Frontier of India in 3 897, and even the victories of the Turks over the Greeks in that year, had had an unsettling effect on Muhammadan feeling even in Persian Makran ; but this theory was not clearly established. The troubles finally assumed the shape of a rebel lion against the Persian Central Government^ which was headed by Sardai Husain Khan of Gaih. This chief had more than once made overtures for support, which were repelled, to the British authorities; and it was undoubtedly his ambition fco found an independent Baluch principalityi n Persian Makran, similar to that of Kalat. An inconvenient result of the general anarchy was that in plac 0S the executive power came into dispute between rivals, each of whom demanded that the subsidy paid by the British Government for P 10 ^ e tion of the telegraph line in the district should be awarded to bimse Among the means resorted to by claimants of subsidies for enforcing their views were insolent threats, and even attacks, upon British n ^ 1 ^ subjects and their property ; the Dashtyari subsidy for the fi rs ^ of 1896 was paid to one chief ; that for the second-half to another,an the position of the Telegraph Superintendent at Chahbar becam difficult and full of anxiety. H. M. S. ' Sphinx ' waS ^ 0 time sent to Chahbar to assure the safety of British subjects there^ and remonstrances were addressed to the Persian Government, but wi no result except that of demonstiating the absolute powerlessness o2195 Tehran authorities in Makran. In January 1897^ at the desire of His Britannic Majesty's Minister in Persia, the Resident in the Persian Gulf visited Chahbar in the R. I. M. S. Lawrence' with a view to his influ ence being exerted on the turbulent local chiefs whom the Shah's Govern- H ment could not control ; but he failed to secure a meeting with any of them. In April 1897, Old Jashk was raided by a Baluchi gang, and British Indian traders were robbed of property valued at Rs. 5,000. Representations concerning this incident were made to the Persian government, in consequence of which the Persian gunboat ' Persepolis ' was despatched to Jashk to restore order, and a garrison of 100 Persian infantry with guns was installed at New Jashk. J Such partial measures, however, were of no avail ; [and, at the end Mur( j er 0 f nfl^97, a culminating outrage which occurred near the coast brought Mr. Graves . u # i and Persian matters to a crisis. Mr, Graves, Acting Superintendent in the Indo- military European Telegraph Department, an elderly man with long experience m of Persia, had pitched his camp, in the course of an annual tour of under British inspection from Jashk, at a place half a mile east of the Rapch river where ^encTlS 6 ^'- the Jashk -Gwadar telegraph line crosses it. On the night of the 2nd 98. December 1897 a gang of about 20 Karwari Baluchis attacked the camp and barbarously murdered Mr. Graves with swords, the fatal blow being struck by Mnlik Ghind-bin-Shali Baig, a headman of the Shahuzai tribe. The sole motive of the crime was plunder; and the robbers, after destroying Mr. Graves' tents, carried off all that they found in the camp including a considerable sum of money which was for distribution in wages to the telegraph staff, upon the camels of the deceased officer. Mr. Graves had established telephonic communication bet ween his camp and Jashk and the occurrence consequently became known the next day to Colonel Meade, the Political Resident at Bushehr. His Bri- I tannic Majesty's Minister at Tehran, on receiving news of it, impressed upon the Persian Government the necessity of immediate action, at the same time instructing the Resident to proceed himself to the spot, hold a local enquiry, and watch the proceedings, but enjoining him to leave measures for the capture and punishment of the offenders entirely to ttie Persian authorities. The action of the Persian Government in the case was unusually prompt. On the 6th December the Persian gunboat ' PersepoJis/' with the Darya-Baigi or Naval Commander-in-Chief and 5»0 Persian ^oops on board, sailed from Bushehr. H. M. S. ' Pigeon' followed, ^ying Captain Sykes, His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Kirman and 148 a2196 Persian Baluchistan^ and Mr. R. Campbell, the successor of Mr. Graves. On the 12th December the f&lt; Persepolis^ reached Galag, the landing place for the Rapch neighbourhood, the Persian troops were at once disembark^ ed and marched to the scene of the outrage, where they were joined on the 16th by Captain Sykes, Mr. Campbell, and a party of 30 blue jackets under Lieutenant Mowbray, commanding the ' Pigeon. ,; Colonel Meade, the Resident, with Major Fagan, the British Consul at Masqat, arrived off Galag in the ' Lawrence ' on the 18th ; they reached tlie Rapch camp on the following day. Meanwhile the Persian force, accompanied by Captain Sykes and by Lieutenant Mowbray with his naval detachment, had advanced into the portion of the Karwan district lying to the west of the Rapch river, and a slight encounter with tribesmen of the locality had taken place. Colonel Meade, after interviewing some village headmen and recording such evidence as was available, proceeded with an escort consisting of 30 bluejackets under Lieutenant Carr of H. M. S. ' Lapwing to overtake the Persian expedition. On the 26th December Gao was reached, a village at the entrance of the hills. Here the despatch box of the late Mr. Graves was found, two hamlets were burned, and a trifling night attack by Karwanis was repulsed without any loss to the force. On the following day the Persians commenced destroying the date plantations of Gao; but, a message having been recei ved from Sa^d Khan,son of Sardar Husain Khan of Gaih, to the effect that he would deliver up the actual criminals within a month, ths Darya Baigi decided on the advice of Colonel Meade to suspend the infliction of further damage. Sa^id Khan^s promise was not, however, redeemed. Colonel Meade, accompanied by Major Fagan, left Galag on the Slet December for Masqat, where important affairs required their immediate presence; but Mr. Campbell remained in camp upon the Rapch river, a small party of British bluejackets and some sepoys of the Bombay Marine Battalion being left for his protection. The country had, from the commencement of the operations, been deserted by its inhabitants, who retired into tbe broken waterless hills to the northward ; but the Persian force continued in touch with them, and in January 1898 a skirmish took place in wbicb the Darya Baigi was wounded, losing the tips of two fingers. In the meantime disturbances had broken out within a short distance of Chahbar ; and on the 9th January 1898, a detachment of 1^ r ^ es of the Bombay Marine Battalion was despatched from India. ^ arrival 40 were posted at Chahbar and 40 at Jashk under Native Officers, while the remainder under Captain Creagh and Lieutenant Waller ^ eie employed to strengthen Mr. CampbelFs camp on the Rapch*f23( 2197 On the 13th February H. M. Ss. &lt;c Pigeon/'' Cossack^, and ^Sphinx' being then assembled at Galag, Commander Baker, 103 British bluejackets and marines from them and marched to the Rapch camp. The Persian force had meanwhile been increased by reinforcements to a strength of 300 ; and there were thus 500 men with two machine guns available for active operations, if the British were allowed to assist the Persians. The Darya Baigi, however, had received orders on the 12th February to remain strictly on the defensive and await another Persian force which was moving towards him from the north; and the Government of India, Who considered that the whole responsibility for what was done should be borne by the Persian Government, prohibited the use of the Indian troops except for the defence of Mr. Campbell's camp. Commander Baker's party, in the landing of which the British political authorities had not concurred was consequently re-emtarked ; and on the part of the Darya Baigi no further military movements took place. The prolonged sojourn of the inixed force in the district had, nevertheless, an excellent effect in Karwan and beyond : the Persian troops, it may be remarked, would certainly not have remained so long as they did but for the presence of Mr. Campbell and his escort. On the 10th March the naval detach ment with Mr. Campbell was relieved by 50 additional sepoys of the Marine Battalion. The Darya Baigi finally sailed for Bushehr on the 29th May, and thereafter no troops, either Indian or Persian, remained in Karwan. The proceedings of the Northern Persian force, by which the settle ment was really effected, deserve mention. At the end of 1897, as already mentioned, there were serious disturbances about Bampur and tlie chief of Gaih was in rebellion against the Persian Government. The Asaf-ud-Dauleh, Governor-General of Kirman, having been ordered to march into Makran and suppress the rising in co-operation with the Darya Baigi, did eventually reach Bampur without encountering any resistance ; but the movements of his force were extremely tardy, and beyond that point he would not proceed. Captain Sykes, who m February was sent via Bandar 'Abbas to hasten the movements of the Governor-General, was unfortunately taken ill before reaching Bampur returned by land to Chahbar early in April ; but his mission, though ftot completed, had apparently the effect of stimulating the Asaf-ud- Dauleh to further action. Troops were despatched southwards from )ur under Lutf Ullah Baig, a military officer i and this commander,2198 after deposing Sardar Husain Khan, the rebellious chief of Gaih, in favour of Mauladad Khan, who already governed Qasrkand^ proceeded against the Karwanis. In April 1898 Malik Ghind, the principal assai lant of Mr. Graves, was killed in resisting capture; another of the gang was taken prisoner and subsequently executed at Jashk ; a third^ who surrendered protesting his innocence, was sent in chains to Bushehr and only two out of five ringleaders remained at large. Lutf 'Ullah Baig ultimately visited the Darya Baigi near the coast before the latter's departure. In acknowledgment of their services on the expedition, thus brought to a close, the Darya Baigi received a presentation sword, and Lutf Ullah Baig a presentation rifle, from the Government of India. A claim for £5,000, to be paid as compensation to Mr. Graves' widow, was preferred by the British Legation at Tehran early in 1898 j but it was contested by the Persian Government. His Britannic Majesty's Government founded their demand on the responsibility of the Shah's Government, under treaty, for the safety of British telegraph employes in Persia, and on the fact that Mr. Graves' murder was the result of anarchy which the Persian Government, notwithstanding remonstrances, had left unchecked during many months. The Persian Government, on their part, objected that Mr. Graves was not their servant but the servant of the British Government, and had therefore no claim on them, and that the amount demanded was excessive. The claim continued to be brought forward at intervals until 1903, but it was not strongly pressed, and it ultimately remained unsatisfied. The effectual punitive action taken by the Persian Government in the cas inclined the British authorities to treat them with consideration. State of In 1901-1902 the country near Chahbar was seriously disturbe affairs near by the violence, already described, of Mir Mahmud of Dashtyan, 1901—1903. who had not then succeeded in establishing his title to be regarde as chief of the district jointly with Mir 'Abdi. Mir Mahmu^ had once refused to accept a portion of the Dashtyari teleg ra P subsidy; but he was, nevertheless, annoyed when he found self altogether excluded from participation in it; and the wen which he felt against the British Government was increased by seizure at Chahbr, in August 1900, of 6 Martini-Henry carbines he waslendeavouring import. In the end he openly declared ^ intention of harassing British interests to the utmost of his ability &gt; a in September 1901, in pursuance of his threat, he succeeded, 0 the Persian G overnment had enjoined their representative at Ba^P2199 0®; measures necessary for restrainiDg lnm ; in plundering off some camels and to take all several villages near Chahbar and in carrying donkeys belonging to British Indian traders and to the Telegraph Department 's employes. In May 1902, trouble still continuing in the neighbourhood of Chahbar^ representations were made by His Britannic Majesty's Minister at Tehran to the Persian Government concerning the deplorable state of Makran. It was suggested by the British Minister that Mir Mahmud, as also Sa^id Khan of Gaih, who was known to be countenancing his proceedings, should be arrested and punished, recourse being had, if necessary, to a military expedition; but nothing was done. Mustafa GLuli Khan, the Persian Gov- emor^ detained Sa^id Khan for a time at Bampur and made him pay heavily for being let go, but he did not require him to put an end to the troubles at Chahbar. In 1902-08 the political unrest was aggravated by a severe drought which affected all the coast districts from Jashk to Gwadar. Two pernicious developments of the period in Persian Makran were the growth of a trade with Masqat in modern rifles and ammunition, beginning soon after 1898, and the appearance in 1903 of the slave trade in a novel form. These matters are fully dealt with in the ap propriate Appendices. The state of Persian Makran in 1905 was still generally disordered and unprosperoUs. Major Cox, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, observed with reference to it: This tract is the Ultima Thule of the Shah's territory, and, inhabited as it is by ati alien race with strong Bedouin instincts and a rooted antipathy to its Persian overlords, it is hardly surprising that the administrative control exercised over it by the Central Government is of the slenderest character ; and in the result the poverty- stricken country^ often racked as it is from year to year with the miseries of famine, becomes a cock-pit of petty inter-tribal dissension and rapine, based usually bn tlie rivalries of the petty ' Mirs ' who are incessantly struggling for mastery one over the other. Arms trade and slave- trade, 1898— 1905. State of Pesian Makran, 1905. Britisli relations with Persian Makran, 1896—1905. British interests in Persian Makran have been touched on, inciden tally, above: it remains to take a general survey of the effects upon them of the anarchy that prevailed. The claim made on the Persian Government in connection with the clai murder of Mr. Graves has already been discussed, but it did not stand and oases.2200 alone; the disturbances of 1896—97 gave rise to a large crop of claims by British subjects for compensation on account of losses suffered. The settlement of these was begun at Chahbar in 1899 by Mr. Sealy, Director of the Persian Gulf Telegraphs, and a Persian Mamiir who was deputed to meet him; but the Persian official gave no real assistance, and progress was hampered by various obstacle^—among them the wilful departure of Sa'id Khan, chief of Gaih, from Chahbar on the approach of the Mamur, and the unavoidable absence of Mir ''Abdi, chief of Dashtyari^ who was then a prisoner at Bampur in the hands of the Persian authorities, and whose brother Mir Mahmud refused to give any help. Mauladad Khan, chief of Qasrkand, however, whom the Persian Governor had appointed chief of Graih jointly with Sa^id Khan, attended and did what he could to facilitate a settlement; and by his instrumentality some claims relating to the Dashtyari district, of which the amount was nearly Rs. 7,000, were liquidated in May 1899. In March 1900 Mr. Whitby Smith, the Director of Persian Gulf Telegraphs, met Hashim Khan, Governor of Bampur, Sa ; id Khan of Gaih, and Mir ^Abdi of Dashtyari at Chahbar and discussed a number of the outstanding claims with them; but a balance of Rs. 22,881 claimed remained unadjusted; and, though the Persian Government promised to send a Mamur to Chahbar at the end of the year to continue the proceedings, no such official made his appearance. In April 1901 the amount of the British claims in Persian Makran had risen to Es. 36 ; 823 inclusive of Rs. 3,000 demanded oq account of the murder of a Hindu who had been agent at Gwatar for a Karachi firm A few claims were settled locally, but nothing was done by the Persian Government towards effecting a general clearance, and the total of the bill continued to be increased by fresh occurrences. Similarly during 1902 no progress was made, and fresh claims ^vere constantly preferred. In April 1903 the value of the British claims outstanding had reached Rs. 43,221, and still no arrangements for a settlement were made by the Persian Government. In April 1904 a meeting at last took place at Chahbar between Wali Khan, Governor of Bampur, and a Persian Mamur named ; Ali Khan, Akram-us-Saltaneh, on the one side, and Mr. R. Campbell of the Indo-European Telegraph Department on the other, at which claims amounting to Rs. 81,783 were investigated. Some cases were thrown out and others postponed but decrees aggregating Rs. 24,660 were passed and2201 bonds for payment given. A further settlement to the extent of Rs. 3,002 was effected in the course of the year. The claim in the Gwatar murder case was amon^ those rejected: that case seems to have been an old one dating from 1898. In April 1905 there was another conference at Chahbar, the Nazim 1905. of Kalat Makran meeting there with the Zahir-us-Sultan, Governor of Bampur, the Ittila'ud-Dauleh^ Karguzar of Muhammereh, and a special Persian Mamur. The bill presented by the Nazim on this occasion was for Rs. 5^557. At the conclusion of the proceedings cases to the value of Rs. 37,262 still remained unsettled, but a further adjustment of Rs. 3,513 was obtained after the conference. British official matters in Persian Makran, 1896—1905» At the end of 1898 it was decided to modify the system on which payments had hitherto been made by the British authorities to local chiefs in Persian Makran in consideration of their protecting the telegraph line and rendering assistance to employes of the Indo-European Telegraph Department. Minor cases of damage to the line and of theft of property from members of the line establishment had become frequent iii Gaih and Dashtyari; in the former district, moreover Mr. Graves, a high local telegraph official, had been brutally murdered; and the Gaih subsidy had^ceased to benefit the chief of the district, the Persian Govern ment having virtually transferred it to themselves by adding its amount to their revenue demand on Gaih,—a circumstance which sufficiently explained the apathy now shown by the chief in telegraph matters. The object of the new arrangements, introduced in 1899 with the sanction of His Majesty^s Government and the concurrence of the Gov ernment of India, was to ensure that the payments should benefit the men of local influence on whom the protection of the telegraph line really depended. In the Jashk and Bahu districts no change seems to We been made; but the allowance of the chief of Gaih was redaced from fts. 3,000 to Rs. 1,000 a year, the greater part of the Rs. ^,000 thus saved being distributed among 9 minor chiefs of the district whose jurisdictions ^ere on the coast; and the Dashtyari allowance of Rs. 1,000 a year was broken up, nearly half of it being similarly divided among minor chiefs. ^ agreement was signed by the new recipients in Gaih and Dashtyari,— also it would seem by all former recipients except the chief of Gaih, Telegraph subsidy arrange ments, 1898 —1905. 1899.2202 British political Establish- ment in Persian Makran, 1896—1905.

The principal Gaih allowance of Us. 1 &gt;000 a year was paid to Sa'id Khan, as chief of Gaih, from the beginning of 1899 to the end of 190L Its amount for the first-half of 1902 was forfeited and paid away to members of the line establishment in compensation for camels stolen. The recipient from July 1902 to June 1903 was Mohim Khan, who acted for those 12 months as chief of Gaih during the detention of Sa^id Khan at Bampur. From July 1903 the allowance was again paid to Sa'id Khan, who had returned. In Dashtyari Mir 'Abdi's share of the district allowance, which was at the rate of Rs. 600 a year, for the six months ending with December 1903 as also for the period from July 1904 to October 1905, was con fiscated and handed over to telegraph employes in compensation for losses suffered. The Bahu allowance was permanently divided in 1902 between the joint chiefs of the district. Us. 400 being awarded to Mir Ashraf, oiigi- nally sole chief, and Es. 600 to his predominant partner Mir Ahmad^ Mif Ahmad^s share was placed under stoppage from July 1905 on account of camels looted from telegraph servants. Throughout this period, as during the latter of the part of the preced ing one, British political interests in Persian Makran were in charge of th e Director of Persian Gulf Telegraphs, whose head-quarters were at Karachi, and who was subordinate in political matters to the Resident in the Persian Gulf. He received an allowance of Rs. 150 a month on account of his political duties, and was locally represented by the European officials in charge of the telegraph stations at Jashk and Chabbar. ^ political duties were defined as comprising maintenance of the rights the Sultan of ''Oman at Gwadar, on the confines of Persian Makran^ the settlement of cases between British subjects and Persian, Kalat, an ■'Oman subjects; the payment of the telegraph allowances assigned 0 chiefs in Persian Makran ; and the investigation of general matters ^ which the British Government was interested, such as the arms trade an the slave trade. In the chapter on the history of the Persian Coast and Islands ^ 18 explained that in 1901 the British Government desired to establish aVice -Consulate at Bampur for the protection of British subjects in Bam, Persian Makran, but that^ in consequence of the opposition of the Persian Government, the idea was abandoned and a Vice-Consulate at Bam substituted, by means of which, though not so directly or fully, it was hoped that the same objects might be attained, besides others. The first nominee to Bam was an Indian Muhammadan, Khan Bahadur Asgtar ; Ali, originally of the Survey Department, who joined his post in 1905, but unfortunately died in it in October of the same year from pleurisy or pneumonia. It will be recalled that a British military guard of Indian infantry British mili tary guards had been maintained at Jashk, for the protection of the Telegraph at Jashk, and Station, from 1878 to 1887 ; but that it was removed in the latter year v X898^1905 in deference to the wishes of the Shah. In January 1898, in consequence of the murder of Mr. Graves and the generally Unsettled state of the country, 150 rifles of the Bombay Marine Battalion under two British officers, of whom 100 were to be located at Chahbar and 50 at Jashk, were despatched from India. No objection was made by the Persian Government. In A^pril the Chahbar detachment was reduced to fifty rifles under a Native Officer, and that at Jashk was placed on the same footing. As the presence of these guards had an excellent effect in giving confidence at both places^ they were not withdrawn on the subsidence of the ttoubles which were the original cause of there being instituted, and permanent barracks were provided at Jashk and Chahbar. Foreign relations other than British with Persian Makran, 1886—1905. As explained elsewhere the only European power besides Britain that showed an interest in Persian Makran duriug the period was Russia, wbo had no established interests there. The chief evidences of ber attention being turned to the country were the * arrival of a Russian railway reconnaissance party at Chahbar in June 1900, and a visit by M. Zaroudni, a Russian political agent. * Vide pages 331 and 1761 ante.(te? 2205 APPENDIX 4. METEOROLOGY AND HEALTH IN THE PERSIAN GULF REGION.* [n the present Appendix, as climatic conditions vary within consider able limits from one part of the Gulf to another, and as the subject of meteorology has been dealt with exhaustively in a number of published authorities, it appears unnecessary to do more than give an outline of the principal facts. General Climatology. The Persian Gulf lies almost outside the region of the south-western Absence of monsoon, and its climate is not much affected by that phenomenon the south- except indirectly; on the Arabian side, within Ras-al-Hadd, the monsoon western mon- is not felt at all; while on the opposite or Makran coast the monsoon rains soon • do not extend further west than Ormarah, and, though the monsoon wind isnotunfelt to the west of Gwadar, it reaches Jashk in the form only * The chief sources of information are the following : the Persian Gulf Pilot, 1898, especially the sections ' Winds ' (pages 5-12), 'Climate and Weather ' (pages 12-19), and ' Health' (page 24) ; the Annual Summaries of the Meteorological Department of the Government of India, containing abstracts of the observations recorded at their stations at Masqat, Manamah (Bahrain), Kuwait, Basrah, Baghdad, Muhammareh, Biishehr, and Jashk .; a collection of reports, dealing with climate and weather from the point of view of military operations, forming enclosures to a letter No. 798, dated 21st April 1907, from the Eesident in the Persian Gulf to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, and dealing with Masqat, Bahrain, Kuwait, Northern 'Arabistan, Southern 'Arabistan, Bushehr and Bandar 'Abbas; an article.

Informa- wn regarding the climate of particular tracts and localities, in some cases with special re f erence health, will be found in the following articles in the Geographical wime of this Gazetteer: 44 'Oman Sultanate' (page 1388), ' Dhufar District' (P a ge 443), &lt;f Trucial 'Oman' (page 1431), f&lt; Bahrain Principality' (pages 236-7).2206 of a light south-easterly breeze. The south-eastern coasts of ^Oman, however, outside the Gulf, are fully exposed to the monsoon, which is there the principal climatic factor, especially in Dhufar. Air currents. The general trend of air currents at most seasons of the year, in the region chiefly under consideration, is apparently down the Gulf from north-west to south-east; this is attributable in winter to the outflow from a high-pressure area over Central Europe, and in summer to the existence of a low-pressure area over the Gulf itself, Baluchistan and the Indus Valley. It is noticeable that, after the south-west monsoon in the Arabian Sea has begun to blow across the mouth of the Gulf of ^Om n, a strong and steady flow of air down the Persian Gulf ; which during the two previous months was very noticeable, is almost im mediately checked. Seasons. Principal seasons. Subdivisions of the seasons. The seasons of the Persian Gulf are those generally characteristic of the temperate zone, namely a fine summer and a wet winter; the hot season may be said to extend from the beginning of May to the end or October, and the cold from the middle of November to the middle of March, the remaining periods being transitional. From the middle of iMay to the middle of July the heat is intense; but is moderated, at the upper end of the Gulf, by a constantly blowing Shamal or north-west wind. From the middle of July to the middle or August the heat is very oppressive, owing to the stillness of the atmos phere and to excessive moisture. Bad weather generally begins after the middle of December, and January and February are cold and boisterous months, Winds. Shamal and Barih. The prevailing wind in the Persian Gulf is undoubtedly the Shain^ JU^ or north-wester, by which, as already mentioned, a p ar ° the hot season is rendered more tolerable. In May, JuneJind 11 ^ when the Shamal blows most steadily, it is known as theB^ihj^^ Kuwait Bay and Town ' (page 1051), ' ITurkisli 'Iraq ' (page 766),' City ' (page 198), ' Basrah Town ' (page 271), ' Fao ' (pages 541-2), . i„ ' 'Arabistan ' (page 152),Southern 'Arabistan ' (page 159), Bushehr « (page 313), ' BQshehr Town ' (page 343), 44 Bandar 'Abbas ' (page 9), (page 916), {&lt; Chahbar Town ' (page 353), ' Gwadar District ' (pages ^ j L 0 in ' Gwadar Town ' (page 589). A few data relating to climate will be round ^ the following articles in the Geographical Yolume; ' Qatar *' (pages 1506-7;, ^ Oasis' (page 644), 'Qatif Oasis' (pa^e 1536), 'Southern Najd' ' Qasim ' (page 1487), ' Jabal Shammar ' (page 1736), ' Llravi ' (page ll 0J -i» hilleh District' (page 1595), ' Angrali ' (page 79), ' Shabanhareh ' (P a ^ e ogo), ' Mazara'i District' (page 1202), 'Zira' (page 1943), ' Dashtistan' W, /^e Dashti ' (page 368), 'Lingeh District *' (page 1088), and ' Shamil Distnct f 02207 time of the BSrih is by some divided into two periods^ the first, which covers 20 days, being called the Barih-al-Ward or ( (^Q Se Barih/ ; while the second, of 40 day^s duration, is known as the u Barih -al-Mishmish ^ or ' Apricot Barih ;? . Natives believe that failure of the Barih necessarily results in a failure of rain during the ensuing winter, and there are some recorded instances which corroborate this theory. Perhaps the next most prevalent and distinctive wind is the Qaus Other winds, or south-easter, which in winter alternates with the Shamal. Other winds are the Na^shi ^*5 or north-easter, which blows strongly in the Gulf of ''Oman, especially in winter, and during which the Batmah * coast is a dangerous lee-shore; the Suhaili ^1^ or south-wester, which is much dreaded by native mariners as it strikes nearly all the sheltered anchorages on the Persian coast; and the Y ahi and Bahri , winds blowing from the north-north-east and east respectively. Temperature. fi ■- • • ' MA* nd The difference in temperature between the northern and southern ends Variations t: of the Gulf is considerable : at the southern end it never freezes, and according to snow is not seen except on distant mountains; but in Turkish ^Iraq strong locality.. frosts are experienced, and snow has been known to fall at Bushehr. The highest absolute temperatures are probably experienced in ''Iraq, Heat. where the thermometer has been known to reach 123° F. at Basrhdad, 113° P. at Basrah and 116° ¥ at Fao; but the heat is most felt in the lower part of the Gulf, on account of the moisture with which the | atmosphere is laden, and it is perhaps more unbearable at Bandar ^Abbas - than anywhere else. In the middle of summer most of the inhabitants of that town, as also those of the Ruus-al-Jibal coast on the Arabian side, migrate to other places in search of a more endurable climate; and in August 1905, at an elevation of 2,700 feet above the sea behind Bandar 'Abbas, the thermometer averaged 105° F., and even more, between 9 a.m . and 6 p.m . ; yet the highest temperature registered at Bandar ; Abbas in 1906-07 was only 108° F., in the month of May. It is said that the highest sea temperatures in the world are those registered off the Persian coast near Lingeh, where in July and August ® the sea water frequently remains at a temperature of 94° F. ; Iraq, the hottest of the districts, is also the coldest, and a reading of Cold. less than 19° F. has been obtained at Baghdad. Rainfall and humidity. The rainfall in the Persian Gulf region is extremely light and the Distribution following table shows the apparent average, in inches, at the places 0 f where observations have been recorded :— Arabian side. Read of the Gulf. Persian side. Bahrain, 3|. Baghdad, 9. Busliehr, 12. Musq it, 3 to 6. Basrah, 6. Jashk, 4|. Fao, 2 to 4. Chabbar, 5 to 6,2208 Rainy season. Rain is almost confined to the winter months and apparently hardly ever falls before the middle of October or after the middle of May most of it appears to be received in the months of December, January and Febrnary. Humidity. The humidity of the atmosphere, which in most places must depend on evaporation from the sea and not on rainfall, is very considerable; at Baghdad, which is at a long distance from the Gulf, the mean annual humidity is only 5G per cent, of saturation; but in Bahrain, which is an island, it is over 79 per cent. Health. Moderate healthiness of the Golf, except Ban dar 'Abbfe» and neighbour hood. Unhealthy, seasons and diseases. The climate of the Gulf, though during several months in the year it is extremely disagreeable to Europeans, does not appear to be more than usually unhealthy; but exception must be made of Bandar 'Abbas and its neighbourhood, where the mortality among the few Europeans from time to time resident has during the last three centuries been remarkable. The cold weather, though less unpleasant to the feelings, appears to be more unhealthy than the hot; but at some places, as for instance at Bandar 'Abbas, sickness is most prevalent in the transitional seasons of spring and autumn. Malarial fever is the principal enemy, both of natives and Europeans; and the discomforts of summer are aggravated to the latter by prickly heat and boils. Crews of shi'i^s sening continuously in a hot part of the Gulf during the summer are liable to become, to a large extent, ineffective through physical exhaustion. Meteorological history. The following facts, dissociated as they are from scientific obsena- tions, are of little value except as illustrating some aspects of weather and climate in the Gulf, and especially deviations from the norma course of events. In the Persian Gulf region weather is a subject 0 great commercial importance, for trade, apart from the pearl nsnenes, depends chiefly on agriculture, and agriculture is here almost alto ^e i dependent upon local meteorological conditions, especially rainfall. 1873-74.* The year was stormy and therefore unfavourable to ^ pearl fishery ; but the rainfall in Southern Persia w abundant. 1874-75. This was a calm year; but in 'Oman heavy and unseasoD able rains did much damage to the date-crop. # The years in this paragraph run from the beginning of April in one cal^ a year to the end of March in the next.2209 The rainfall generally was in great excess of the normal^ but with beneficial results. In 'Oman the rainfall was abnormally great, and heavy floods occurred, but the effects were good. The winter rains of this year were deficient in Southern Persia, and extremely so in 'Oman. Winter rain in Southern Persia was scanty: in 'Oman almost none was received. In Southern Persia the rainfall in autumn and winter was unusually good, and fears of a famine, which had begun to be entertained, were dispelled. In 'Oman large quantities of rain fell, and the damage done by drought in the two preceding years was to a great extent repaired; some damage, however, was done by hail. There were heavy gales in the spring of 1884, occasioning several wrecks. In 'Oman heavy rain fell in February 1884 and floods occurred. In this year the rainfall in Southern Persia was unprece- dentedly copious. In 'Oman, on the 30th of March 1885, a hurricane struck the Batinah coast between Sib and Masna'ah and travelled inland as far as Rustaq, causing some loss of life and destroying many thousands of date palms; simultaneously heavy rain fell over all 'Oman, by which crops, trees and houses were washed away and immense damage done. In April 1886 a furious gale blew at Bandar 'Abbas, the town was inundated by the sea, and much property was destroyed. In the same year the seaport towns of Manamah and Muharraq in Bahrain were flooded and many houses destroyed. Good rains fell in Persian Makran. In Turkish 'Iraq the local rainfall was deficient, but damage was done by flooded rivers. The summer heat at Bushehr was unusually trying in 1888, and the following winter was exceptionally free from gales. The same conditions recurred in 1889-90. In Turkish 'Iraq, in 1889, the rainfall was copious, but it came too late. In Southern Persia the rainfall was excellent. In June 1890 a cyclone, accompanied by a high tidal wave, did much damage to the town of Masqat; and the date crop in the neighbourhood suffered. In January 1891 a heavy storm struck the coast of Trucial 'Oinan, unroofing houses, blowing down date trees, wrecking vessels at sea, and destroying boats on the beach. 1492210 1891^92. The rainfall on the coast of Trucial ^Oman was extremely deficient. 1892^-93. The summer of 1892 on the Persian coast was long and trying, and in the following winter there were heavy gales; an exceptionally severe one, which occurred on the 17th of November, was accompanied by hail and did much damage. Rainfall was deficient in Southern Persia. 1893-94, In December 1898 a storm, accompanied by heavy rain, passed over ^Arabistan, and the Karun rose 20 feet at Ahwaz and remained in flood till the beginning of January; much country was inundated. In March 1894 heavy rain was experienced in Bahrain, where many houses collapsed. Rain and floods did immense damage in Ears. 1895-96. There was good rain, early in 1895, in Turkish ^Iraq; in 1896 unparalleled inundations were caused there by the Euphrates and Tigris, and great destruction of crops took place. In Southern Persia rainfall was remarkably deficient, especially about Lingeh and Bandar ; Abbas; but near Lingeh, just as distress was becoming acute, the situation was improved by abundant rain in March 1896. 1896-97. Drought prevailed in Southern Persia. 1898-99. On the 3rd of June 1898 a disastrous cyclone passed over Masqat and the adjacent parts of ^Oman; small craft were destroyed in great numbers along the coast; and thousands of date palms and other trees were uprooted by the storm. 1900-02. The rainfall in Turkish 'Mraq was deficient; and at Bandar 'Abbas, on the 12th March ] 902, there had been practically no rain for a year. 1902-04. The winter rains in Southern Persia were good. 1904-05. The winter was unusually cold and severe, and on the morning of the 29th of January 1905 ice was observed at Bandar 'Abbas. 1905-06. Floods occurred in Turkish 'Iraq. In Northern 'Arabistan the summer of 1905 was relatively mild, and at the end of December exceptional cold was experience ^ several degrees of frost being registered. Heavy iam fell in parts of Persian Makran, where, in the neighbour hood of Gwatar, 500 square miles of country flooded, an experience without precedent fo r years; and rain was general between Jashk and Gwa ar . 1906-07.

They consist of mica-schists, hornblende- hists talc -schists, quartz-schists, calc-schists, and quartzites. Great ; of quartz penetrated all these beds preyionsly to the crushing which have deformed, foliated and metamorphosed quartz veins au( i sedimentaries alike. They occupy various plains, of which Saih Hatat is the largest, and are surrounded by cliffs of the next series. They are also seen on the edge of the great Samail Valley and near the coast of ; Oman to the south-east of Masqat. This series consists mainly of limestones, many of which have been rendered quite fissile by crushing, while some are massive. In colour they vary from a pale reddish tint to almost black. Interbedded are a few shales, slates and sandstones, with red and green chert beds. Traces of fossils have generally been obliterated; but in one place the presence of Pmnctus, Dielasmi and other Brachiopods points to a Carboniferous ao-e for that portion, while a species of Myojohoria from the Elphinstone Inlet indicates another portion as Triassic. The whole must at present be considered as a single series, extending from Jabal Ja'alan, near Ras-al- Hadd) through the whole of 'Oman to the end of the Huus-al-Jibal peninsula and forming the great mountain ranges of ^Oman, of which Jabal Akhdhar is the best known. Rocks of this series crop out on the side of the Gulf, both east and west of Lingeh^ and on the little of Daiyinah off the coast of Trucial ; Oman. A great abundance of basic igneous material has been injected, in the form of sills of immense thickness, into the ^ Oman series, or has iowed over their denuded surface. This includes diabase, diorite, gabbro and dolerite. These rocks have been largely altered into epidiorites and serpentine. The dark-greenish cliffs of Masqat for the most part consist of the latter, the joints being filled up with magnesite, a white decom position product. This volcanic series has shared in all the folding of the 5 Oman series, and both igneous rocks and limestones alike dip at angles which are hardly ever less than 45°. It is unconformably overlain by upper cretaceous limestones, and we may therefore conclude that this out pouring of volcanic material probably took place at the end of the or at the beginning of the Cretaceous period.

Annexure No. 1 to this Appendix is tounded «y on ihe Administration Reports of the Persian Gulf Political Residency, and No» 2 on a special report by Mr. Pilgrim.2214 Cretaceous. Hippuritic Limestone. Hormnz Series. Eocene and Oligocene. Limestones containing members of the characteristic family of the Hippuriticlae ; with some intei bedded shales, are widely diffused througbut Persia. A small inlier is found at Khamir, surrounded by younger rocks; and it is well developed on the Arabian coast to the south-east of Masqat, where rocks whose fossils indicate an Upper Cretaceous age overlie tlie older rocks unconformably. Occupying the whole of the eastern or larger portion of the Gulf proper are series of lavas and tuffs with some interbedded sandstones and shales. Associated with these are vast beds of rock-salt and gypsum, deeply tinged with red from the presence of red iron oxide (red ochre), produced by the decomposition of haematite or specular iron ore ; which is abundantly found throughout the formation. Red ochre exists in Horaiuz, Bu Musa aod some other places in large deposits/which have been profitably worked. Iron pyrites, sulphur, dolomite and anhydrite are found also to some extent in the deposit. The underground solution of the salt and the consequent falling in of the surface have given the ground occupied by the Hormuz series a singularly craggy aspect; and their almost entire barrenness increases the peculiarity of their appearance. The beds have been greatly disturbed and are almost always found to dip at high angles. At Khamir their connection with the Hippuritic limestone clearly proves that their age is not older than Upper Cretaceous; and as the Eocene rocks which overlie them are probably not older than Middle Eocene, a date between these two periods may be assigned to them. They were probably formed in shallow water in a slowly subsiding area. Rocks of this age are distributed in three distinct areas in the Gulf 1. Persia. Nummulitic limestone extends over great areas in the interior of Persia and Baluchistan, overlying the Cretaceous rocks unconformably. Sandstones, with interbedded limestones of an Upper Eocene age, form the big range running behind Bandar 'Abbas and approaching the sea at Khamif' Southern Persia probably does not contain any representativ of the Lower Eocene limestones of Baluchistan and Smd but a more or less uninterrupted deposition seems to w continued into Oligocene or even into Lower M iocene times The newest be^s seen are limestones, containing in the Bakhtiyari series. 2 J Oman, Sandy limestone with a basal conglomerate, belonging to the Upper Eocene^ rests on all the older beds. 3. Bahrain. This area was separated from the preceding two aieas by a land barrier consisting of the older rocks of ; Oman an of the once continuous land formed by the Hormuz series, which the Gulf islands and a few places on the mainlan now the sole surviving remnants. The rocks are Imi 08 011 ! often very argillaceous and characterized by the large of gypsum and siliceous matter scattered through them, latter as flint, chert, or quartz geodes. Nummulites echinoidsare numerous in some beds. The Bahrain almost certainly occupies a large area in the interior Arabia, and probably is a representative of the Eocene, with which it shows strong fossil affinities. of2216 Bakhtiyari Series. Ttis widely-spreadtseries of indurated marls and clays veined with Fars Series, sum with interbedded limestones and sandstones^ probably attains ^thickness of not less than 17,000 feet. It forms the big Gisakan range ? i - j Bushehr and is found practically all along the coast. Inland Reaches an elevation of 7,000 feet above the sea. It rests nncom- f •mably on the Hormuz series and all nummulitic limestones of Oligo- e n e The basal beds contain a great thickness of rock-gypsum, amounting to at least 300 feet. It is in this part of the series that most of the petroleum of Persia and the Gulf occurs. These basal beds do not appear to extend to the east of Bandar ^ Abbas, haying probably been overlapped by newer beds. The fossils met with in Qishm, Hanjam ; and other islands also indicate that this portion of the series is newer than the great mass of clays in the interior of Persia. The beds of this series are more or less iinconformable to those of the o- Farsseries; but at the same time no violent earth movements took pi ace prior to their deposition. They do not approach to within a distance of 50 miles of the Gulf, but are largely developed inland, stretch ing from Musal to Shiraz, and appearing in the hills of Ahwaz and Behbehan and amid the Bakhtiyari mountains. Red sandstones, grits and conglomerates are the prevailing rocks. A conglomerate containing pebbles of red and green chert is a characteristic and widely-spread rock in the series. These rocks also rest unconformably on Eocene and Cretaceous beds. They were probably deposited in large deltas or estuaries, which were then being converted into dry land. They ^ are unfossiliferous, with the exception of a footprint of a carnivorous animal found by Mr. Loftus. Subsequently to the great orogenic movements which elevated and folded the Tertiaries, an oolitic limestone seems to have been formed on most of the Gulf islands ; it consists of the remains of smalHoraminifera along with some sand, round which lime has been deposited in layers. It was probably a wind deposit and is identical with that of the Kathiawar coast, which is known as 'Miliolite'. Of later date than the Miliolite ' are the shelly conglomerates which are found on all the coasts of the Gulf and have been met with at an elevation of 450 feet. The shells which they contain invariably belong to species now living in the Gulf. With regard to many of the deposits We classed, it is not unlikely that they are really pleistocene ; but we have no means of determining their age exactly. The red sandhills of the coast of Trucial 'Oman are found for a distance of 8 miles or more inland: they owe their colour to numerous round grains of chert. Great quantities of blown sand are to be seen in Qishm Island. The great desert plains of the interior of Persia were once the sites of lakes, which We left terraces of gravel and clay. The alluvium of Turkish 'Iraq^ is deltaic in origin and is composed of sand and sandy marl containing numerous marine shells. The formation is being extended at the rate, it is calculated, of 1 mile in 30 years. The fluviatile clays and gravels ^ Turkish 'Iraq and 'Arabistan and the alluvial gravels of the Persian highlands and 'Oman can receive no more than a mere mention. Pleistocene Eecent and Sub-recent.2216 Geological history of the Gulf. In the present state of our knowledge of this area it is impossible to trace the sequence of events prior to the great stresses wliicli folded in the serpentinous basic igneous rocks of Masqat and ; Oman amongst the Carho-Triassic beds. These movements probably occurred at the begin ning of the Cretaceous. We may therefore date from this period tlie elevation of the mountain ranges of ^Oman. In the ocean-bed whose southern limit was defined by these upheaved older rocks were deposited the Upper Cretaceous beds of Hippuritic Limestone which cover large areas in Persia. Following closely upon these ; and perhaps extending into the Eocene period^ occurred the Hormuz series of volcanic flows, accompanied by the formation of thick beds of salt and gypsum. It is not unlikely that shallow-water conditions prevailed here during part of this epoch, and some of the lavas and tuffs of the Hormuz series were probably formed beneath the water After this period o£ volcanic activity occurred a great depression of most of Southern Persia, Within this depression the Eocene rocks were deposited. This was accompanied by an upheaval of the volcanic area of the Hormuz rocks into dry land, which formed a barrier running in an approximately north-west and south-east direction^ separating the Eocene sea of Persia from that of Bahrain. It seems not unlikely that this land barrier continued through the Upper Eocene^ Oligocene and Miocene, This appears to have been a tranquil period^ the distribution of land and sea remaining almost unaltered except as demanded by the slight unconformities before the deposition of the Fars series and the Bakhtiyarx grits. In early Pliocene times occurred the world-wide movements which produced amongs others the present mountain ranges of Persia. The actual Persian Guli area seems to have been less disturbed than the Persian plateau ; witness the^ almost horizontal strata of theF.ars series in Hanjam^ and the J rolling Eocene rocks of ^Oman and Bahrain. It is on the whole hk 6 ) that sub-aerial denudation continued over this area^ and that the carving out of the topographical features to which the floor of the ^ ers ^ Gulf and the Gulf of ; Oman owe their present contour was conolu e dwing Pliocene times. The limit of this land was doubtless Q® 61 mined by the steep submarine cliff which runs along the Makran coast and then, cutting across the Gulf of 'Oman, runs parallel to the Ara coast. This feature may have been the result of a fault, but the w'® inclines to the idea that it was produced by the denudation of agradualij rising area during Pliocene and possibly during Pleistocene times- j® a widespread submergence took place, which buried fathoms deep steep mountain valleys, river systems and Bea cliffs which were carved out for so many ages previously. To movements of this nature ' we owe the deeply-cut inlets of Musandam and the islands dotting ^ Gulf, which are merely isolated peaks of the Hormuz volcanic series F 8 rising above the surface of the water. The latest movement to which W Gulf has been, or is now being, subjected is one of gradual elevation, which traces are found in recent littoral concretes, now as much as ^ n2217 f et above the present sea-level, and in the flat ledge which surrounds Masqat harbour. In the upper portion of the Gulf the deltaic deposits of Tigris and Euphrates have contributed to this work of reclamation in an entirely different manner ; within historical times these rivers have ilted up their mouths to an extent which has materially altered the coast line of this part of the Gulf, and in the future they are destined to unite Hasa to Fars just as in the past they have produced the fertile plains of Turkish 'Iraq. Minerals. Tetroleum. —Numerous ' shows ^ of petroleum exist along a broad belt running north-west and south-east through Turkish 'Iraq and down the Persian Gulf. These are most abundant at the foot of the chain of hills where the naptha springs of Daliki, Behbehan, Eamuz, Shushtar and Qasr-i-Shirin are situated. Small quantities of oil have been yielded by the Shushtar well for many years, but all deep borings made in the area in the hope of obtaining large supplies have hitherto proved unsuccessful. Asphalt—h. small deposit of good quality, but trifling in amount, occurs in Bahrain. Coal. —Thirty miles inland from Sur in 'Oman some seams of good coal are found in newer tertiary strata. Their small extent and difficulty of access seem to prohibit their being exploited. Sulphur. —The sulphur mines of Khamir and Bustaneh near Lingeh have been profitably worked in the past, but are not sufficiently valuable now-a-days to make them remunerative. Copper. —This occurs as copper glance and malachite in the interior of ; 0man. Red Ochre. — Deposits of this exist on several islands in the Gulf and are profitably worked. Mt, —This occurs in unlimited quantity in the Hormuz series, espe cially on Hormuz and Qishm Island, and large amounts are exported. Gypsum. —This is widely distributed thoughout the Gulf area. It ^ of good quality and is easily available. It is everywhere used as a cement in building. Iron.—As haematite and pyrites this is widely scattered through the Hormuz series. Magnesite, Alum and Steatitic day. —Have been noticed. Building stones —The littoral shelly concrete is largely used. Some 0 f the Bakhtiyari sandstones on the Karun are fairly good. Much of Jlie Bahrain rock makes an excellent building stone. The nummulitic limestone near Masqat also furnishes excellent stone. Road-mending material, —The Masqat serpentine rock would be admirable for this purpose.2218 ANNEXURE NO. 1.—EARTHQUAKES IN THE PERSIAN GULP. Earthquakes are frequent and sometimes severe in the Persian Gulf Proper^ especially towards the lower end upon the Persian side. In 1865 an earthquake levelled the villages of Darveh Asuh; near Mugam, with the ground ; and its remarkable effects were witnessed by Dr. Colvill of the Bushehr Eesidency. In August 1880 an earthquake was said to have destroyed some houses and caused about 120 deaths in Bastak, On the 16th of October 1883 a severe shock was experienced at Kangun^ ''Asalu and Tahiri and in their neighbourhood^ where much damage was done^ and tremors continued until the 24th; this shock was felt also at Bushehr. In 1884 a somewhat serious earthquake occurred and was felt most severely on Qishm Island; the shocks continued for several days, tlie most violent being on the 20th of May^ when a number of villages were partially destroyed ; and 1 32 deaths were said to have been occa sioned. Many of the inhabitants left the island and there was mucli distress^ in consequence of which the annual revenue was remitted; and the Shah of Persia subscribed 1^400 Tumans for the relief of the desti tute and the repair of mosques. Shocks were experienced at Lingeh also, but did no damage there; and in June one was observed at Ras-al- Khaimah on the Arabian side of the Gulf. Smart shocks of earthquake were felt at Bushehr on the 14th and 24th of November 1887. By far the most severe earthquake of recent times in the Persian Gulf area was one which ; on the night of the 11th of January 1897 ; laid Qishm town in ruins ; only two mosques and three or four other build ings were left standing, and over 1^600 bodies were said to have been afterwards recovered from the ruins. There was some loss of hie, on this occasion, on the island of Larak ; and vibrations were felt as far the west as Lingeh. In June 1902 Qishm and Bandar ^Abbas were affected hy seismic disturbances, which began on the 9th of June and lasted for several daJS; and as usual the damage was greater at Qishm town than elsewhere. In 1905 shocks were experienced on Hanj am Island on the 25th ^ April and on Qishm Island on the 27th of April; and at the same ^ there were movements in the^neighbourhood of Bandar ^ Abbas w 1C caused landslips and the collapse of houses at the Ginau mountain an ''Isin village. ANNEXURE NO. 2.—WATER SUtPLYIN RELATION TO GEOLOGY. Ma»qat. Masqat, on account of its rainless climate and the presence of , s ^ hills of serpentine rock only, presents an appearance which is arid 1112219 extreme ; but there is reason to think that deep wells in the town basin would provide abundant water. 0£ two wells which exist one yields sweet, and the other slightly brackish water. In the littoral district of Batinah, from Masqat westwards to the Batinah. Ruus-al-Jibal promontory^ good water is obtainable everywhere by digging wells ; especially in the neighbourhood of limestone hills of the 'Oman series. The high; rocky, barren promontory of Ruus-al-Jibal^ dividing the Ruus-al- Gul£ of'Oman from the Persian Gulf proper, is waterless; almost no Jibal. rain falls, and there is no probability of artesian wells being discovered. On the western side of the Ruus-al-Jibal promontory, along the coast Tmcial of Trucial 'Oman, wells yield good water; and it is probable that in most 'Oman, places an abundant supply would be struck at 100 feet or less. The copious springs of Bahrain and Qatif are derived, without doubt, Bahrain from the highlands of Central Arabia. In the Bahrain islands great an( l Q^tif. irregularity is observed in the quality of the water; and of two wells sunk only a few yards apart one may yield brackish water and the other sweet. The water supply of places in the deltaic tract of the Shatt-al- - 'Arab Turkish and Kariin is good and plentiful. ^raq and Persian 'Arabistan. Along the Persian coast as far to the south-east as the commencement Persian coast, of the Hormuz salt formation, that is to say at Bushehr and all other north- places west of 52 o 40' of longitude, wells are dug and generally yield we8t . eni abundant water. The water is contained in the porous, horizontally sect i on ' stratified conglomerates of littoral or fluviatile origin which cover the whole plain between the hills and the sea, and it is believed to be held ap by clays and marls of Miocene and Pliocene age; it is derived from the rainfall of the lofty Pliocene hills inland of the coast. The water of Bushehr is drunk by natives, but in Europeans it is found to produce serious gastric disturbances; the prejudicial impurities may possibly be derived from basal gypsum beds of the Miocene series through which the water has passed., otherwise their presence is without obvious explanation. The Persian coast and islands to the east of longitude 52 o 40' are Persian generally destitute of potable water, for the salt formation of the Hormuz coast, south- series, even when not visible, is not far beneath the surface, and the east . ern water from wells is consequently salt and undrinkable. These remarks sectl011, apply to the coast between Bandar 5 Abbas and Lingeh and to some dis tance beyond them upon either side. The inhabitants of the tract in question are dependent on surface rain water collected in Birkehs or reser voirs j but, the rainfall being small, this source of supply is precarious^ and the quality also often leaves much to be desired.2220 AVPEND1X THE PEARL AND MOTHER-OF-PEARL FISHERIES OF THE PERSIAN GULF.* Pearl fishing is the premier industry of the Persian Gulf; it is, besides being* the occupation most peculiar to that region^ the principal or only source of wealth among* the residents of the Arabian side. Were the supply of pearls to fail, the trade of Kuwait would be severely crippled, while that of Bahrain might—it is estimated—be reduced to about one-lifth of its present dimensions and the ports of Trucial ^Omau, which have no other resources, would practically cease to exist; in other words, the purchasing power of the inhabitants of the eastern coast of Arabia depends very largely upon the pearl fisheries. Annexure No. 3 to this Appendix shows that the number of boats employed in the industry is now about 4,500, and that the number of operatives person ally engaged in pearling is over 74,000; moreover, in estimating the importance of the fisheries as a means of livelihood, the families of the operatives must be borne in mind, as well as the numerous capitalists; large and small, with their dependents, whose funds are invested in the industry. Annexures Nos. 1 and 2 supply further proof of the magnitude of the interests involved, for the value of the pearls exported from the Gulf, estimated in 1833 at ^300,000 and in 1866 at £400,000, was in 1905-06 (at the lowest computation) £1,434,399 ; and to this figure must be added the value of the mother-of-pearl exported, which in earlier times was little or nothing, but in 1903-04 amounted to £30,439. The pearl fisheries have a political as well as a commercial aspect, and to that aspect we shall return after first considering the industry m a general light. * Ihe older aufchorities are an article by Colonel D. Wilson in the J. &amp; G. S. Vol. IH; an article by Colonel L. Pelly in the Tr. Bo. G. S., Vol. SVIII; an article by Captain E. L.

Interesting K® w a a i e C f t 'PO' the Bnb j e «t of the Persian Gale pearl fisheries by fto fe » !0 ' mim an B Zeport on the Pearl Gulf2221 The pearl banks. The geological formation of the bottom of the Persian Gulf and the Extent and temperature and shallowness of its waters appear to be favourable in a position, high degree to the growth of the pearl oyster. The pearl banks which are known and actually worked occupy a very considerable proportion of the whole area of the Gulf, chiefly upon the Arabian side * The line between which and the Arabian coast lie the bulk of the pearl banks—the line in fact which may be considered as marking their seaward limit on that side—begins near the coast of Trucial ^Oman a few miles to the west of Dibai Town, passes slightly to the north of the island of Sir Bu Na'air^ and then curves, at a distance of 20 or 30 miles from the nearest land, round the promontory of Qatar and the Bahrain archipelago. Northwards of the Bahrain islands the belt formed by the banks diminishes in width, and it may be considered to end at Aba 'Ali Island, though some banks of minor importance occur to the north even of that place. In the great bay between Trucial ^Oman and Qatar the depth of water averages from 10 to 15 fathoms^, but there are occa sional deep places of 20 to 23 fathoms and many submarine knolls carry ing only 3 to 9 fathoms; the last are the principal scene of pearling operations in this part of the Gulf. The pearl banks on the Persian side are found chiefly on the coast between Lingeh and Tahiri, and again in the neighbourhood of Kharag Island, The largest and most productive of all the banks are situated on the Arabian side of the Gulf and are fished annually, the richest being those to the north and east of Bahrain : the banks off the Persian coast are poor as well as small, and are fished, at the present time, once in three or four years only. Pearl banks occur at all distances from land up to 70 miles, and at all depths from a little below high water mark down to 18 fathoms at least; it is possible that they exist also in deeper and more central waters where the native divers are unable to reach them, and the Arabs believe that there are beds in inlets of the Euus-al-J ibal coast where the depths are 21 to 25 fathoms. The term for an ordinary level pearl bank is Hair j±*&gt; (plural, ^^ s ^ ca ^ 0Ii Hairat ol^ ), while oyster beds formed on the top of submarine a11 13a ule, mounds surrounded by deeper water are known as Najwat (singular, Najwah ). It is noteworthy that nearly every Hair appears to have been known from of old, whereas the Najwah is often of recent discovery and still bears the name of the finder. The best banks are considered to be those which are level, which are situated in clear *A list of the principal peavl banks in the Gulf will be found in Annexure No. 4 to this Appendix, compiled by Lieutenant Hose, R. N., of H. M. S. ' Redbreast.' Beaides those mentioned there are many others which, though they have diitinctive ^nies, are in reality only portions of the larger banks specified.^222 water^ and which^ consist of a fine whitish sand overlying coral; it is believed that a mixture of mud or earthy substance with the sand is detri mental to the pearl ; and that beds having this defect are liable to exhaustion. The oysters are not firmly attached to the bank on which they grow but either lie loosely on the sand or adhere feebly to pieces of coral or seaweed. Sometimes they cling together in a mass, called Tabra ^ (plural, Tabari ), and it is said that such concretions are frequently pearl-bearing, and that the discovery of a single rich Tabri will frequently make good the failure of a boat during a whole season. * The pearl oyster, t The pearl-producing oysters of the Persian Gulf are of three kinds each yielding mother-of-pearl as we\l as pearls. The first sort or pearl oyster proper, called in Arabic Mahharah W ou (plural, Mahhar ) , is the most prolific source of pearls; it is found all over the Gulf from a little beneath low water mark down to a depth of at least 18 fathoms. The second kind is the Zanniyah (plural, Zanni c&lt; jj); it occurs chiefly m the waters on the coast between Ras-al-Khaimah and Ghubbat Ghazirah, where the largest specimens are found, but the finest in quality are obtained from the banks round the islands of Shaikh Shu^aib, Hindarabi and Qais; this shell-fish is also common in the neighbourhood of the islands of A rzanah and Daiyinah. The Zanniyah is found at the same depths as the M ahharah, chiefly on hard muddy or shelly bottoms ; but the pearls which it produces are few and of inferior quality. The third variety is the Sadaifiyah (plural, Sadaifi ) which occurs chiefly round the islands of Shaikh Shu'aib, Hindarabi and * In Ceylon waters the oysters generally occur on hard bottoms called paftrs i but they are also found on sand near paars, generally adhering to one another or to hard objects such as fragment of dead coral. A bunch of Ceylon oysters may coneist of 3 to 16 individuals, and as many as 4 generations may be represented is the same bunch. (Vide Herdman's Report.') •j' In accordance with general usage the word ' oyster ' is employed througbcut this SCr ^ e a P eHr ^'h H aring mollusc, but the term ii not scientificHlly correct. The Mahharah belongs to the family Aviculidae and is more nearly related to the ^ European mussel than to the European oyster (Ostrea)* The pewl ' oyster' and the mussel both produce a byssus or bundle of tough threads by which they attach themselves to rock, etc., while the edible oyster has no byssus. According to ore classification the Mahharah is Meleagrina vulgaris or Marg(i^f era vulgaris \ the Zanniyah is Meleagrina marg ar it if era var. persica ; an^ the oadainyah is Avicula macroptera : according to another the Mahhaiah is Melea- grxna {M org aril if era) vulgaris ; the Zannivah is Avicula macroptera Kv m i n Mefedgrina {Margaritifera) mar gar it if era See, however, an article Vvl Yl iS,n oo lT ? roc&lt; ' (!diD g* 'f tte Royal Physical Society of Bdiabwgh. thfi *p rr' ' J 161 e 18 ^Pparently considerable difference of opinion regarding tne correct names of these molluscs. •2228 Qaie about Chiru, at the islands of Das, Qarnain and Zirko, and ogtie coast of Euus-al-Jibal between Ras-al-Khaimah and Ghnbbat Grhazirah; in its habitat the Sadaifiyah resembles the Zanniyah, for it .frequents hard muddy or shelly bottoms in the same depth of water. The SadaiHyah does not often yield pearls, but those which it produces are ordinarily large and of fine quality. The laws which govern the growth of the oyster and the fluctuation Growth and of oyster colonies in the Persian Gulf are by no means ascertained and ▼ariation of the causes in accordance with which the yield of pearls varies from Ilum ^ er6, season to season have not been investigated there as they have been in Ceylon. It is believed that the Mahharah increases steadily in horizontal diameter until the end of the second year, when it measures about 2 inches, and that thereafter the rate of its growth diminishes; if 1 The^following facts in relation to the Ceylon pearl oyster, nearly all taken from Profesfior W. A. Herdman's Report on the Pearl Oyster Fisheries of the Gulf of Mmar, 1903-06, may be of interest to the general reader; it is, of course, uncertain how far they hold good of the pearl oyster of the Persian Gulf. The pearl oyster is not hermaphroditic, and the sex of the individual, whether male or female, is permanently the same. The number of males and females is approximately equal, but there may be a slight preponderance of males. The oyster is gregarious without {distinction of sex, and reproduction takes place by the emission of the generative products of male and female into the surrounding water where they commingle. Midsummer and midwinter are principal breeding seasons. Larval development takes place in the surface waters. The young oyster exists at first in a free-swimming condition, which may cease within 5 days of fertilisation of the eeg, but is capable, it is believed, of being considerably prolonged ; during this period the rudiments of a shell are acquired. The next stage is that of ' spat attached as a rule to Algae, either rooted or floating, or to Zoophytes' but the animal, though now capable of 6xing itself, is highly locomotive and can creep as much as an inch in a minute. This it does generally in an upward direction, probably from an instinct of avoiding sand ; nor is it, like the adult oyster, deterred from movement by light. The maximum diameter of the oygter may increase during the ' spat ' stage from *4 of a millimetre to 1*5 millimetreg and upwards. The rate of growth of the animal during the first and second years of its life is shown to be rapid. In the third year growth becomes much slower, and in the fourth year still more slow ; but the thickness and weight of the shell continue to increase greatly even after the external measurements have become almost stationary. The oyster may be considered mature in its fourth year, when its diameter measured at r jht angles to the hinge line is about 3^ inches ; it is at its best however in its mth; and it seldom, apparently, survives its sixth year. The food of the oyster consists of microscopic organisms, both animal and vege table; but, while silt, etc., is rejected after being formed into a small pellet, minute grains of sand and other non-nutritious particles are sometimes swallowed. The natural position of the oyster is with the right or less convex valve underneath and with the posterior edge of the shell elevated at an angle of about 20 degrees ; when undis- turbed it holds its shell slightly open with the lips about one'third of an inch apart, f* placed with the under side uppermost the oyster turns itself over by a violent jerk from a retractile sucker or ' foot' which it is able to protrude from its shell to ae ma oh as 2^ inches. By means of this 'foot ' the oyster is also able to travel, wgh slowly, from one place to another ; while the ' footis being advanced^ the ves 0 f the shell are held widely open, and when it is retracted they are closed with a BD ap, a manoeuvre which aids considerably in the forward movement. An oyster has ^ known to progress 27 inches in this manner in 12 hours. The first care of the TOr when it has attained a suitable position is to attach itself by a byssus or JRinous thread, generally of more than one strand, to some convenient object; the2224 this rule be correct; the majority of the bivalves brought to the by divers in the Persian Gulf are over two years of age, and a large number are over three years. The movements of the oyster are entirely uncertain, defying forecast J thus in the season of 1876 nearly every pearl boat in the Gulf was riding in the vicinity of the Shah Alum shoal and a magnificent haul of oysters was obtained in a very restricted area, while in the following year the same locality—contrary to the expectations of the divers—proved almost barren. It is known that in the G ulf the oysters sometimes suffer severely from submarine disturbances, accompanied by the emission of gases and bitu minous products; this was notably the case in 1900, when the sea in places on the Arab banks was reddish and turbid and the oysters on some of the beds were found to be dead or diseased and produced no pearls. The notion that the Arabs feed the oyster beds at certain seasons of the year is erroneous; nor is the oyster itself often eaten, except by the natives of Trucial ^Oman. Persian Gulf Pearls. The classical word for a pearl in Arabic is Lulu^J^J (plural, Laali ^ and in Persian Marwarid ; but the term in common use all over the Persian Gulf is Qumashah (plural, Qumash )• byssus is formed of material secreted by a special gland and the foot js used to bung each strand, as it is moulded or cast, into contact with the point selected oi fixation. The byssus hardens on contact with sea water, and its colour cMBg 0 ® within 48 hours from a pale almost transparent yellow to an opaqne and bronze-green. The animal can at any time let go the inner end of_ the where the strands are fused into one, and it frequently does so when it is unab e find a place with which it is thoroughly satisfied ; a specimen under observation^ Galle changed its position 7 times and formed a bjssus no less than 8 times i ^ fortnight, the byssus on one occasion consisting of 9 strands. The adult oys e ^ very sensitive to light and shade, and will close up even in a depth of 9 tatncms consequence of a shadow passing over the surface of the sea ; its movemen from fear of predaceous animals, are mostly performed during the hours oi dai &gt; and are discontinued if an artificial light is brought to bear. The animal can release itself from a covering of sand not exceeding inC V but, if buried to a depth of 3 inches, it is helpless and dies. The shifting ^ caused by monsoon or storm currents, is undoubtedly the cause of many (iisas raI]Ce oyster colonies, and it was probably an important factor in the total msappe ^ from the Periya Paar in Ceylon, between March and November 1902, of a num young oysters computed at no less than a hundred thousand millions. ^ ^ The principal enemies of the oyster are voracious fishes, chiefly ia J® R ^ r w jtli fishes, the former of which can apparently crush the shell of the adult their teeth ; boring gastropod mollusca ; boring sponges, which sometimes ^ ^ ; the shell of the adult oyster so rendering it an easier prey for fish; boring starfishes; lamellibranch mollusca, which smother the animal; crabs ana fishes ; and, finally, associated animals such as corals, barnacles and Bpoug. es » ^ adbere to the shell and, mechanically or by competition for food, cause in3 u J even death. Other causes of mortality among oysters are overcrowding, which i^^Sj the nutrition and growth j also, possibly, the opposite evil of over -fishing by wn ^ stock left for breeding may be too greatly reduced. Diseases due to paras' probably epidemic and assisted by overcrowding, also claim many yictim 8 '150 '( 2225 In the case of the Ceylon pearl oyster the cause of formation of the Causes of earl is shown to be, as a rule, the secretion of nacreous matter within a forr ^ a Hon cyst surrounding the body of a minute Cestode parasite, and in the case of thg Persian Gulf oyster it is probably the same or analogous.* The inhabitants of the Gulf still hold to the ancient superstition that the pearl jg a drop of dew or rain, which the oyster has taken in by rising to the surface of the sea at night, or during a shower. To the technical classification of pearls in the Gulf we shall return Principal later on; at present it is sufficient to observe that the natural distinctions varieties, a re those of colour, shape, and specific gravity. With reference to colour it may be mentioned that black pearls (by Arabs called 'dead ' pearls) of high value are seldom found ; such as are obtained are usually dull and # The following data regarding pearl prodnction are extracted from Professo 1, W. A. Herdman's Kejoort on the Fearl Oyster Fisheries of the Gulf of Manaary 1903-06; it is possible, however, that the factors in the process noay not be in the Persian Gulf exactly the same as they are in Ceylon waters. The formation of a pearl in an oyster is not a natural or healthy, but on the eontrary an abnormal and morbid occurrence. The cause of formation is not invariable; but it is generally the intrusion of a minute parasite,—the opaque white globular larva of a Cestode worm. This Cestode as a rule belongs to the genus Tetmhyncus ', its length, while it inhabits the body of the oyster, ranges from •07 to'53 miliimetres. The life-history of this parasite is not yet fully determined; but there is reason to think that it exists at first as a free-swimming larva in the sea, that it then makes its way into the oyster, that it subsequently passes into the file- fish which preys upon the oyster, and that it reached its final and adult state in the shark or ray by which in its turn the file-fish is devoured. The Cestode on finding entrance into the body of the oyster becomes^ surrounded by a sac, which in some cases consists of connective tissue, and in others is epithelial; in some localities hardly an oyster is free from such cysts, and as many as 45 have been counted in an individual specimen. The formation of a pearl generally takes place in one of these cysts, by the nacreous matter secreted by the interior walls of th® cyst being deposited around the larval parasite in the centre. Only about one c^st in a hundred is pearl-bearing, and such a cyst seems always to belong to the epithelial variety; the chemical composition of the contained pearl, it has also been ascertained, resembles the nacreous lining of the shell, which is an epithelial product. The presence within the body of the oyster of epithelial cells (which must be derived from the epidermis of the mantle) is not yet fully explained; possibly the first cells of thisldfld are carried in along with itself by the burrowing parasite. ^ Whether pearl formation commences before the death of the parasite or after is a point still undeter mined. Cystg, both pearlbearing and non-pearlbearing, occur in many positions throughout the viscera and mantle of the oyster. The honour of being the first to connect the formation of pearls with vermian parasites belongs to Dr. E. F. Kelaart of Ceylon who died in 1859. It should be clearly understood, however, that all pearls are not ' cyst pearls a^d that some are due to causes other than parasitic invasion. There are also ''moscle pearls, which are generally found in the muscular tissue of the oyster near tbemsertions of the levator and pallial muscles and have as a nucleus a ' calcospher- ftle * or tiny calcareous concretio^ ; such pearls, when present, are usually numerous, and on one occasion 193 (of which 23 were visible to the naked eye) were found at the insertion of one levatoi* muscle. Another variety is the ' ampullar pearl, formed between the shell and the mantle or in an external pouch (ampulla) of the latter. In tbif last kind the nucleus may be a grain of sand or other inorganic particle ; but such is rarely the case, and, out of some hundreds of pearls of all sorts examined in le ylon, only 3 were found to have a nucleus of this nature. Nacreons excrescences or so-called ' blister pearls ' attached to the interior of the shell are due to the irritation caused by boring animals which work through from the outside, or to the entrance u erw \ fi ® 0 f foreign bodies between the oyster and its shell; but these can hardly peailg. In some pearls no nucleus at all is discoverable,2226 of an impure colour, and they generally crack after a year or more. Parti coloured pearls are not uncommon ; they are mostly black or brownisli, with white or bluish variegations. Besides pearls of spherical or pear- shaped form, symmetrical probably because they have developed in a soft medium, malformed pearls of various types occur in the Persian Gulf as they do elsewhere ; of these the commonest are the hemisplierical ' button pearl/' flattened on one side, perhaps by contact with the shell, and the hollow irregularly shaped ' blister pearl ' which is formed by the oyster as an internal defence after a boring parasite has succeeded in penetrating its shell. Small pearls generally, whether round or deformed, are denominated ' seed pearls but this is an English term, and, as will be seen from Annexure No. 5, has no single Arabic equivalent. Pearls exceeding 30 grains Troy in weight are seldom obtained in the Persian Gulf, and the smaller sizes are numerous in proportion to their smallness. One of the finest Persian Gulf pearls on record^was found in 1867 in 16 fathoms of water near the island of Shaikh Shu aib; it was purchased by a merchant for 15,000 Qrans, was sold in Paris for about £^,000, and was eventually purchased by a Baniyah and brougnt to India to make an eye for an idol. Another fine pearl was that referred to in the paragraph on the political history of the Arabian pearl banks. Natire The experts of the Persian Gulf assert that the largest, whitest opinions. heaviest, and most perfect pearls are obtained in deep water, while t ie shallow bed 3, though prolific, yield pearls of less specific gravity an tinged invariably with a shade of some colour; this stain of co ^ ou !: A 6 ? attribute to the influence of the light of the sun, and they hold t a there is a tendency to distortion in pearls grown between islands an the mainland, and that deep water is favourable to perfect sphenci y ^ well as to lustre and to the other qualities conferring value. The peai^ fishers of the Persian Gulf are possessed by a patriotic^ beliet m superiority of the produce of their own seas ; and, estimating the nnenes^ of pearls as they do by an imaginary number of ' coats,* they assig^ one only to the Karachi pearl, three to the Ceylon pearl, five to the ^ Sea and Soqotrah pearl, and no less than seven to the ordinary P ea ^ the Persian Gulf, while fine pearls from Kharag have sometimes described as having eight a coats. ^ Persian Gulf mother-of-pearl. As has already been mentioned, mother-of-pearl is obtained all the three kinds of pearl oyster that are found in the ^ rsl f 1 jV e pearl but the most important producer of this substance, as well o _ 1 itself, is the Mahharah variety of oyster.

Organisation and working of the pearl fisheries on the Arabian side. Having taken account of the physical data of the industry, we proceed to enquire into the manner in which it is organised and prosecuted. The persons actually connected with the fisheries may be divided into two classes, namely financiers and operatives. The money required to equip the pearl fleet for sea and to maintain Financiers, the crews while employed on boards is partly advanced from private means by those interested in the operations and partly borrowed from a U) w special class called Musaqqams (plural, Musaqqamin ). The Musaqqam is generally a man of substance, but some Musaqqams, who have not sufficient capital of their own, conduct their business by meant of loans which they obtain for the season from wealthy Arab or Indian merchants at 10 to 25 per cent, interest. The manner in which the debts of operatives to financiers and of financiers to capitalists are adjusted will be described further on, but the different forms of contract prevalent among them are too numerous and too complicated to be detailed. Formerly the hold of the Musaqqam class upon the industry was very strong, and many boats were fitted out with their assistance ; but their position is no longer what it was, and their numbers are dwindling. In Bahrain, it is said, there are now only 3 Musaqqams (2 Baharinah and 1 a Sunni Arab), and not more than 10 per cent, of the Bahrain fleet have dealings with them. Once even Indian merchants did not despise the profession of Musaqqam. The general term for the pearl fishery is Ghaus (literally ci ass0g 0 f 'diving'), and all the classes that take part in the active operations operatives, are included under the common denomination of Ghawawls (singular, Ghawwas ). The unit of organisation is the boat's crew, and within this unit the chief personage is the Nakhuda (plural, Nawakhidah or captain, in whom full authority and entire responsibility are vested. TheNakhuda is, in 7 or 8 cases out of 10, the owner of the boat which he commands ; but sometimes he is the hirer of the boat, or again he inay be merely an employe of the boat owner. N ext in importance to frie Nakhuda are the Ghasah (singular, Ghais 011 4f Divers, followed by the Siyub (singular, Saib ) or ' Haulers. One w more Radhafah (singular, Radhif ) or extra hands arc generally carried to assist the haulers, and sometimes a Walaid (plural, Aulad ) or apprentice is taken, whose duty it is to catch2228 Boats. fish, cook, look after [the pipes and coffee, and attend to other minor duties. The Ghasahj whose only work is to dive^ are mostly poor Arabs and free negroes or negro slaves ^ but Persians and Baluchis are also to be found among them^ and^ in recent years, owing to the large profits made by divers, many respectable Arabs have joined their ranks. The efficiency of a diver depends more on his skill and daring than on tlie strength of his constitution,—the last being a point on which undue stress has sometimes been laid by waiters upon pearling; and a slaye diver who is not afraid to enter deep and muddy water containing weeds is ordinarily valued at considerably over Rs. 1,000. The Siyub, whose duties are merely to manage the boat and to lower and pull up the divers, are usually landsmen or ex-divers whom age or other causes have obliged to abandon diving. The total crew of a pearl boat varies from 10 to 40 men, the average number being about 16 for the whole Gulf. The number of the Ghasah is generally less than that of the regular Siyub in the same boat, standing to it in a proportion of 10 to 11, 12 or even more; the reason of tWs arrangement is that, if a diver were to be thrown out of work for want of a hauler, the loss would be greater than the expense of carrying a few extra Siyub. These extra Siyub, who must not be confounded with the Radhafah, are called Jalalis or a Sitters 3&gt; (singular, Jallas All sorts of boats are now used for pearling, even jolly -boats being in these days fitted out for the purpose, but the majority are Sambuks; and after the Sambuk come, in order of frequency, Batils, Baqarahsand Shu ais. A pearl boat of the largest dimensions, to carry 40 men, costs Rs. 30,000 or more to construct and fit out. Soaaons. There were formerly, and are still, two recognised seasons for tbe conduct of pearling operations at sea ; but their incidence has changed in recent times. Thirty years ago the earlier season was the Ghaus-al -Bard or f Cold Diving which began at the middle of April and continued for 40 days. During the Ghaus-al-Bard the operations were confined to shallow water, and the coldness of the sea obliged the divers to work in alternate half-hour shifts. The next, which has always been the principal season and is called the Ghaus-al-Kabir^CJI or Great Diving', formerly beganm June after the end of the Shamal and lasted till the end of Septembei, now, however, it begins at the middle of May and continues for 1^0 days, that is until about the middle of September; the beginning of this season is known as the Rakbah, and the end as the Quffal or ' Closing The times of beginning and ending of the Ghaus-al-Kabir are not exactly hxed and they are liable to be affected by the month of Ramadhan, when Vk a * L 111 llot , weatlie r, as diving is prohibited during the fast. &amp; 1906 the Ghaus-al-Kabir of the Bahrain fleet lasted from the 16th Mayto the 1 8th of September, with an interval of 5 days which began on the 22nd of August. The second season is now the Raddah al or ^ Return, comnaences a few days after the conclusion of the Ghausral-K(tZ4-i) 2229 , f a bout ^ weeks' duration. In 1906 the Raddah of tlie Bahrain A ^ began on the 20th of September and ended on the 14jth of October ; 1 in that year the Bahrain and Kuwait fleets closed the season about the ^ ie tirne^ later than the Qatar fleets but earlier than that of Trucial San, which had delayed in putting to sea at the beginning of the season. Besides the seasons of pearling at sea, there is also a winter season 1 for shore operations known as the Mujannah In the Mujannah fishery is conducted chiefly by wading in the shallows along the coast when the tide is out, and those who take part in it ordinarily return to their homes at night The pearls obtained in the Mujannah are ordinarily small and discoloured; nevertheless the magnificent specimen which gave rise to a dispute mentioned further on in the pnlitical history of the pearl fisheries was found by a wader of Kumzar. It may be noted here that a number of Kuwait, Bahrain and Trucial ^man pearlers now visit the Ceylon banks in winter, instead of devoting themselves to ordinary deep-sea fishing at home, as was formerly ttie rule; the Government records do not show this practice to have prevailed earlier than 1889. Large boats in the Pertian Gulf belonging to enterprising owners are sometimes sent away from the home fisheries to those of Scqotrah and the Red Sea, where they remain continously for as much as two consecutive seasons, and return with Zanni and Sadaifi shells as well as pearls. This seems to be an old custom, and the season of 1885 is recorded as having been a successful one in the Red Sea ; ^ but, since the Italian Government began to tax pearl boats fishing in Eritrean waters, the Red Sea venture has become less popular than it formerly was. The pearl fishers, who till recently had neither charts nor compasses Modus but are now generally provided with the latter, are extremely expert in operandi t finding their way to any bank they may desire to reach, and are generally able to make a direct voyage thither ; they are guided, not only by the sun and stars and by bearings from the land when in sight, but also by the colour and depth of the sea and by the nature of the bottom. Some Kakhndas select the banks which most generally yield a fair return, and stay on them for the season; other commanders, of a more sanguine or less methodical temperament, remain on the move and change the scene of their operations every few days. In the choice of a bank the rsakhuda is limited by the powers of his divers; 8 fathoms is an ordinary depth, and is at and 12 is perhaps the greatest at which work can be carried on withou discomfort; boats with good divers, however, will work on banks carry ing 14 fathoms. There are men who can negotiate 16 fathoms o ^ iauuumis. xuere ttie uicu — water, but the strain at this depth is too great to be endured long, even by the strongest, and fatal accidents sometimes occur in working at \ a level * On the banks diving is carried on every day during fine weather ,• k begins an hour after sunrise and ceases an hour before sunse . vmji uygms an nour atter sunrise ana ucct&amp;cji — - The interval between the early morning prayer and the commencemen of diving is spent by the crew in opening the oysters collected on t e previous day.

Of the shells, only the best—that is to say some 3 or 4 percent, of the whole—are kept, and the remainder are returned to the sea along with the juvenile oysters, ~ the latter unopened but unlikely, it is believed, to survive a separation of 16 hours on the average from their native element. The process of opening the oysters is unpleasant, owing: to the smell and to the insects which it sometimes attracts. The divers, before they commence operations for the day, are allowed a light meal of half a pound of dates and a few cups of coffee each. Once they have entered the water, work is continued without intermis- ; sion until Dhuhr (in the pearling season about 1-30 or 2 p.m .) when it | is suspended for prayers, a few cups of coffee, and an hour^s rest; nor is it again interrupted, after being resumed in the afternoon, until the approach of evening. Soon after Maghrib or evening prayers the divers take a substantial meal of fish, rice and dates, and then, after a little smoking and coffee-drinking, retire to rest for the night. The Ghais, before entering the sea, strips off his clothes, places a pair of horn pincers called Fatam (plural, Aftamah ) on his nose to compress his nostrils, plugs his ears with cotton-wool, or bees' wax, and puts on leather finger-stalls, called Khabat kxz. (singular, j Khabatah ) to protect his fingers from abrasions; he also U) attaches a small bag or Diyin (plural, Diyain co i r matting to his person, by hanging it round his neck or fastening it to his waist. To aid him in his descent he has a stone or lead sinker weighing 10 to 14 lbs.; this is fastened to a rope called Zaibal cfej (phM Ziyabil ), having above the weight a noose, in which the diver : places his foot and so is lowered to the bottom of the sea; a seeond rope, called Ida )^J (plural Ayadi ), is fixed to his girdle and is u«ed to raise him to the surface again. On reaching tn e bottom the diver removes his foot from the noose in the Zaibal; which is immediately hauled up by his attendant Saib.. and proceeds to grope his way along the bottom with one hand and one foot, using the second foot j to propel himself and the disengaged hand to collect oysters within his reach, and place them in the Diyin. It is said that the oysters are gener ally found open-mouthed, but close up when approached. Whe' ' ie cannot hold_ his breath any longer, the diver signals to the Sain b} jerking the Ida to which he clings, and is immediately pulled up to surface and relieved of the shells he has brought. The shells gathere by a Ghais in a single plunge or Tabbah (plural, Tabbat^ ) generally number from 5 to 20 ; sometimes however he returns e ^ re ^ empty-handed. The time occupied by the plunge is usually from 40 7 5 seconds, but only a few divers can remain below water for more an one minute * In the intervals between plunges, the Ghais, unless the se^ is rough, rests in the water, supporting himself by an oar or by a r 0 l^ which hangs over the side of the boat. The same diver will make a * In Ceylon it was observed that few divers remained more than Ig below, and that none reached 2 minutes ; 15 oysters was apparently an ora number for a diver to bring up with him.2231 v as 50 plunges in a day if the weather is favourable^ but only 10 or oTjf ^ W ater is cold. It is rarely that a diver is attacked by a shark Tariur or dogfish (Kalb-al-Bahr j.^1 ) ; but in 1900 an 1 sual number of sharks made their appearance off the banks and Ttacked nearly 30 divers, two of whom were killed under water, while others were rescued in a precarious condition. The diver sometimes suffers from the stings of the devil-fish or Hammah ^ , and when ^ er e are many of these about he wears a long white shirt to protect him from their embraces. The exertion of diving is greatly increased by the existence of a current, and, where currents prevail, the diver is frequently floated away to a distance from the boat, and comes up much exhausted ; in such places a long rope is allowed to trail i^m boat ; to which the Ghais can swim on reaching the surface and be hauled N in by the Saib. Here it may be mentioned that the occupation of ^ diving, though a severe form of labour and fatiguing at the time, is not considered by those engaged in it to be particularly injurious to the health, and that it is practised even by old men ; on the other hand, it undoubtedly gives rise, in some case 5 ', to diseases of the respiratory system and to deafness. A common ailment among divers is a skin disease, to guard against thich those who are liable to it occasionally rub themselves before g 0 iug to sleep with a decoction, called Jaft , from the inner shell or t e Persian acorn.* Senna leaves and a few other common drugs are carried by pearling boats; but, in case of serious illness, recourse is genera y had, whatever the nature of the symptoms, to actual cautery with a hot &lt;1 iron. Social life, customs and discipline on the Arabian pearl banks. Social life on the banks is confined to the hours of the evening, w ^en the Nakhudas and their crews visit friendly boats to enjoy co ee ' wa . er cakes and tobacco, and to compare notes of their proceedings.

A man also who finds a good pearl in opening the oysters is specially rewarded. Quarrels are of rare occurrence on the pearling ground, and the boats even of hostile tribes may be seen peacefully anchored within a few cables' length of one another. The boats of each district form a fleet, with one of the NakhudaSj appointed before sailing by the Shaikh of the district, as its Admiral The principal duty of the Admiral is to fix the day for cessation of work and return to port. No diver is willing to remain on the banks longer than his fellows, and the premature departure of even one boat, however successful it might have been, would probably bring about a strike of all the divers from the same district remaining on the banks; conse quently no boat is permitted to leave until the Admiral has hoisted tlie signal for departure, and boats that reach home before the return of the Admiral are, in the absence of a sufficient excuse, severely dealt with by the Shaikh to whose jurisdiction they belong. A boat whicli leturned to Kuwait prematurely in September 1905 was at once sent back to the fishery. Most crews, however, pay one or more brief visits to port in the course of the season to see their families, to take in pro visions and to clear off the barnacles which have collected on the sides of the boats; in Bahrain one such interval is simultaneously observed by all boats, under the name of Saifiyah .

This discount of 15 to 20 per cent, constitutes, in the case supposed, the profit of the Musaqqam; and the price of 80 to 85 per cent, of value paid by the Musaqqam is divided among the owner ; Nakhuda, and crew of the boat. The Nakhuda is hot however precluded from disposing of the pearls and shells to a thiid party, provided that the price he obtains will enable him to discharge his obligations to the Musaqqam, and that the Musaqqam is himself no willing to give so much; and, as in practice the Musaqqam is generally unwilling or afraid to bid against the Tajir or professional pearl merchant, the Nakhuda frequently sells to a merchant.

Pinancial regulations of the pearl fishery on the Arabian side. Pearling operations having been carried on in the past very largely with borrowed capital and being still to axonsiderable extent so financed, it is not surprising to find that the industry is governed by stringent customs as to debt, which have the force of law and are steadily enforced by local tribunals. To make the situation intelligible it should be explained that many Prevalence of Nakhudas, especially those who are not owners of boats, owe more than debt, they can pay to their Musaqqams on account of the expenses of fitting out and provisioning their vessels and of retaining the services of capable divers by them money advances ; also that even those Nakhudas who are Mi A or free from debt are often in a precarious position, inasmuch as they are responsible for the debts due from their divers to Nakhudas by whom the divers may have been previously employed. In a similar way, and even more generally, the divers are indebted to their IS akhudas for advances, and, being an extravagant class, the amounts which they have borrowed are often large and in some cases _ reach ^ so high a figure as Rs. 3,000 a diver ; yet, in the stress of competition which now prevails, the ^akhudas dare not refuse advances to their divers, even in the off-season, in case they should desert them and take service elsewhere. I* view ot their own financial responsibilities and of the probability that the w ole deht due by a diver may be lost in event of his death, Nakhudas are extremely careful in the choice of their Ghasah. It is evident that, under such a system of finance and in such a society as have been described, the rights of lenders can only be safeguarded by rules ot an exceedingly drastic character. The Nakhuda, as we have already stated, is obliged, in certain Mu^qams circumstances, to transfer the whole of the season s take to his Musaqqam at a rate equal to about four-fifths of its market value; should e disregard this obligation and dispose of his pearls to any other person, the purchaser becomes liable to the Musaqqam for the amoun o e Nakhuda's debts, even if they exceed the value of the pearls which e has bought. The M usaqqam, on the other hand, has the nght to abroga e his connection with the N akhuda at any time, if he tin s i o is interest to do so; and, should the Nakhuda, when this occurs be unable to pay his debts, the Musaqqam may insist on the pie of the Nak uda s boat, if he owns one, after which the divers belonging to the boat may be engaged by new masters, on payment to the insolvent Nakhuda ot t le debts which stand against their names in his books : the house and other property of the Nakhuda, however, are exempt from seizure, unless % ^223^ specially included as security in the agreement between himself and the Musaqqam. There is, however, an alternative to these severe measures and, except in the case of wilfully defaulting N akhudas, it is almost invariably preferred by the Salifat-al-Ghaus,—a tribunal presently to be mentioned; it consists in the fixing of annual instalments for the discharge of the debt, and, when this has been done by a decree of the Salifat-al-Ghans and a paper has been given by the Musaqqam to the Nakhuda stating the amount of the debt and of the annual instalment, the Nakhuda is free to form relations with another Musaqqam. In the event of his finding a patron, the new Musaqqam by whom he is entertained becomes liable to the former Musaqqam for the regular payment of the annual instalments and so continues as long as the Nakhuda remains in his service, and the debts of the original Musaqqam must be discharged in full before the new M usaqqam can claim repayment of any which may have become due to himself, but the second Musaqqam enjoys a priority over any third or later Musaqqam similar to that which the first Musaqqam possesses in regard to himself. Nakhudas The obligations of divers to Nakhudas are similar, that is to say, and divers, no diver may leave the service of a Nakhuda to whom he owes anything, and, if a diver violates this rule, the new Nakhuda by whom he is entertained is held responsible to the old Nakhuda for the whole amount of the debts due to the latter by the diver. Capitalists The Musaqqam, it should be noted, is not bound to dispose of his pearls to the merchant from whom he may have borrowed money for his Musaqqams. operations. Tribunals. The rules just described are enforced in every Arab principality by a tribunal known as the Salifat-al-Ghaus sJJU or 'Diving Court.' This^ tribunal is not a permanent institution but is constituted, when required, by the Shaikh of the principality, who appoints one or more men—generally Nakhudas of repute who are well versed in the usages of the pearl fisheries—to compose it and act as judges. Before this tribunal the Musaqqam, the Nakhuda and the diver all stand on an equal footing ; and by its decision they are absolutely bound. The Salifab does not itself administer oaths, and, when an oath is necessary, the parties are sent before a Qadhi in order that it may be taken. Special financial features of the fishery on the Persian side. We have now dealt fully with the finance and working of the Aiabian pearl fisheries; but, though many Persian boats take part in the operations there and the manner of prosecuting the industry i® much the same upon both coasts of the Gulf, it is advisable, before passing on to consider the trade in pearls as distinguished from the business of procuring them, that We should take note of certain differences which prevail upon the Persian side. On that side the fishery is less highly organised than on the2235 A • bian the reason doubtless being that the banks are fewer, poorer, 1 more scattered ; but the system of finance, the classes of operatives, X p ,seasons and methods of fishing, the customs of the industry, and the armer in which the last are enforced are apparently much the same as m ii ie ^ r abian fishery. The boats used, however, are smaller, sometimes ^rrvinff no more than four men besides the Nakhuda; and in tlie ca tt er of the division of profits there are certain differences, for the Sure of a diver and that of a hauler are bere, as a rule, the same. On the Persian side, sailors and other extra hands are either paid monthly wao-es or are remunerated otherwise under a special arrangement. In Persia the money-lender corresponding to the Arabian Musaqqam, from whom a Nakhuda may have taken an advance, is entitled^ to Durchase the season's take at its full market value only, valuation being made by assessors ; and, if he does so and if the Nakhuda is m need of further funds through the value of the pearls not exceeding the amount o!his debt to the money-lender, the latter will give the Nakhuda a further advance and the Nakhuda will be bound to continue m his service. If however, the money-lender foregoes his right to take over the pearls, the Nakhuda is entitled to sell them himself, and should he, after doing so be unable to discharge his debt to the money-lender, the latter will have a personal claim a,gainst him only, and will have no power to attach his boat or to detain the divers from service elsewhere. At Kharag Island the fishery is carried on under altogether exceptional conditions. There the operations are conducted under the supervision of the local Zabit by small boats carrying, as a rule, m addition to the N akhuda who is almost always the owner, onl y two d i vers and two haulers. The crew receive pecuniary advances from the JN akiiuda at the beginning of the season, but they are not supplied by him with food, for they live on shore and go to work at 8 o clock in the morning, retarning to their homes for the night. The day's take is brought every evening to the Zabit, who seals it up and returns it to the Nakhuda for custody. At the end of the season the whole catch is divided between tke Khan of Hayat llavud and the operatives, m the proportion ot one- fourth and three-fourths respectively ; or the Nakhuda may, if he pleases, retain the whole on paying to the Khan one-fourth the value of the pearls plus 15 per cent, of the same, and to the divers and haulers their proper shares.*' Among the operatives about one-fourth goes to the Nakhuda as bwiier of the boat, and the balance is divided among the divers an ers as it is upon the Arabian side, that is, in t he proportion of three s es ° each diver and two to each hauler ; but here the Nakhuda, 1 e a an active part in the fishing, is reckoned as a Saib only an no as a Ghais. The trade in pearis* We are now in a position to consider the manner in which the pioduce of the fisheries is disposed of. * See also statement on page 2289 from a different source.2236 Markets. Until so recently as 1902 Manamah and Lingeh were the only pearl marts of importance in the Persian Gulf ; the former drew to itself all the trade of the middle, the latter that of the lower Gulf. Lately however, in consequence of the stringency of the Persian Customs at Lingeh and of the extension of steamer communication to the free port of Dibai, the trade of Lingeh has been in a large measure transferred to Dibai^ and the transfer bids fair to become complete and permanent. The great bulk of the pearls from Bahrain, Lingeh and Dibai are exported to Bombay, where they are classified for despatch to European and other markets, but some are sent to Baghdad. The Baghdad market favours the white pearl and takes a large proportion of the small seed pearls. Yellow pearls find a sale in India and Turkey, and indifferent and bad pearls are disposed of in Persia, where they are used to ornament articles of male and female attire. Dealers. ^ke pearl dealer of the Persian Gulf is either a Tajir &amp; UJ (plural, Tujjar ) or a Taw Wash u Z ) jjo (plural Tawawish Of these the Tajir is a wholesale merchant, whose business is brought to his door, who makes his purchases for cash, and who has direct relations with Bombay ; the^Tawwash, on the other hand, is a petty merchant who must go in search of his trade, who obtains his pearls on shore by payment of cash or from the fleets at sea in exchange for provisions, and who invariably resells his acquisitions to a Persian Gulf Tajir. The Tajir is brought into relations with the Tawwash (or m some cases with the Musaqqam) by an agent or Dallal w ^ 0 deceives commission from both sides, but is generally, it would seem, of more service to the Tajir than to the Tawwash. A number both of the Tajir and Tawwash class are Indians, and the number of Indian Tajirs has increased in recent years, while that of Indian Tawwashes has not diminished ; nevertheless, in both grades of the profession, Arabs have multiplied more rapidly, and it is estimated that three-fourths of the entire trade is now in Arab hands. Exceptionally large and fine pearls, which we may take to be thogeof anTval* 16 ^ ^ g ra i n s Troy and upwards, are bought and sold singly, and there is no of pearls? ^ reco ^ n i s e c l method of assessing their value ; but the intermediate and smaller sizes, which form the staple of the pearl trade, change hands in larger or smaller quantities, and their valuation, dependent as it is 011 considerations of size and weight as well as of colour and shape, is a process which demands some technical knowledge.* Size. Medium pearls are assorted with reference to size by being passed through a series of perforated bowls, called Tus (singular, Tasah &lt;u.Uo ), which are made of brass or copper and fit into one another, so as to form a nest or pile. To assist them in their private operations, some pearl dealers keep sets of as many as 45 bowls, very finely graduated 111 , .* W i* h ^e^marks wKich follow may be compared the section claBsificatioa of Pearls (m Oeylon) in Professor Herdman's Keport. -»Kative2237 rd to the size of their perforations ; but the standard set, used in orfnary transactions, is composed as follows Name of 'bowl.

The finest Ras pearls are called Naqwah sy' ; hut this is a class, not a size. Wholesale purchases of pearls from Nakhudas by Taw washes and others are, as a rule, made chiefly by size. In this case, after the Nakhuda has removed any specially fine ^ pearls which he wishes^ to dispose of by the Chau, as hereinafter explained, the rest are assorted into Ras, Batn and Dhail, and change hands in the lump at a rate previously arranged of so many Tumans per Mashhad Mithqal. The Tuman, it should be explained, is a fluctuating unit of pecuniary value, sub-divided into 100 Muhammadis and depending, in its relation to^ actual currency, upon the variations of the pearl market; it is a peculiarity of its use that the rate for Batn and Dhail pearls is always ^ and ^ respectively, weight for weight, of whatever may be fixed for those of Ras size. The ^ashhad Mithqal of the pearl trade appears to be the same tl ing as the ordinary Bahrain Mithqal (see next footnote) and weighs therefore about 4)44( grains Troy: it is sub-divided into 20 Daniqs , (plural, Dawaruq ) or into 66 H abb ah 3 &lt;***» , (plural, Habbat olTL ). The ordinary pearl, after being purchased from an operative by size, usually passes from one dealer to another on a more precise kind of estimate based upon weight.2238 Chan. The unit in the dealer's system is called a Chan ^ (plural, AcWat ) ; and it should be clearly understood that this Chau, thougli derived from a weighty is not itself a weight. Chaus are of 4 kinds^ obtained by an identical process from the 4 different Mithqals whicli follow:— Bahrain Mithqal * Qatar do. ^ Bombay do. Poona do. = 160 grams Troy. = 160 do. do. =74 do. do. =68? do. do. Kates. In each case the number of Chaus in a pearl is found by squaring the weight (in Mithqals) of the pearl and multiplying the result by 330. Thus let c be the number of Chaus and m the number of Mithqals, then c = m* x 330 and the result (c) will be in Bahrain^ Qatar^ Bombay or Poona Chans according as the weight of the pearl was expressed in Bahrain, Qatar^ Bombay or Poona Mithqals. One Bahrain Chau, it should be observed is approximately equal to 4 Bombay Chaus ; for, let m be the weight of the pearl in Bahrain Mithqals, then its weight in Bombay Mithqals is Vi 0 m ) all( i ^ follows that the number of Bahrain Chaus in the pearl in question is to the number of Bombay Chaus in the same as 330m 2 is to 330 x ( V t m )* as 1 to ^y 1 ^. In the same manner it may be demonstrated that 1 Qatar Chau represents approximately the same quantity of pearl substance as 4f Bombay Chaus. Both Arab and Indian dealers have rules of thumb for the convenient calculation of Chaus from weights, but both classes have recourse by preference to ready reckoners in Arabic and Gujarati which are obtainable from Bombay. The (simplified) Arab rule is : Express the weight of the pearl in Habbahs (of which there are 66 to the Bahrain or Qatar Mithqal), square the number of Habbahs, increase the result by 1 per cent., and divide by 100. The (simplified) Indian rule is: Express the weight of the pearl in Rattis t (of which there are 24 to the Bombay or Poona Mithqal), square the number of Eattis, multiply by 55 and divide by 96. Algebraic analysis will show at once that both of these rules are virtually the fundamental rule c z=zm i x 330 thrown into a different form. The Chau, to whichever category belonging, is divisible in the instance into 100 Dukrahs (plural, Duwakir yjy ). In the case of the Arab Chau each Dukrah is again resolvable into 100 Mazur jtfi while in the case of the Indian Chau the Dukrah consists of 16 Badams first and the Badam of 16 Visvasis ^ When the number of Chaus in a pearl has been ascertained it only remains, in order to determine its value, to apply the market rate per • These are both exceptional weights and ave called Snrati The ordinary Bahrain and Qatar Mithqals (the former called also Mashhad ASithqfil) are much heavier, being equal respectively to 6 and 7 Bombay Mithqals, but they are tsed in Chau calculations. ^ t The Ratti again is composed of 4 Dans, the Dfin of 4 Anahs and the Anahof ^ Uukrahs.lizsr 2239 pu u of the class to which it belongs. A table of the principal i ses- which are distinguished from one another chiefly by colour d shape,— will be found in Annexure No. 5 to this Appendix, together ^th the rates for each class which prevailed in Bahrain in 1906. It iould be noted that these rates furnish but a rough guide to the dealer, f r they are in the form of maxima and minima only, and the actual rate for a particular pearl is determined by considerations of ' skin ' or purity and 'orient/' or lustre, which cannot be reduced to a formula. These rates are subject to change, and there is no doubt that during the last half century they have risen enormously; between 1852-53 and 1877-78 they doubled, and since 1877-78 they have more than doubled again.f Some experts, generally sea-going Tawwashes, profess a power to Art of the distinguish roughly the depth of water and even the particular neighbour- pearl dealer, hood from which a pearl shown to them may have been obtained; thus they assert that pearls from the banks near Bahrain are marked by greater lustre, and those from banks further northward by greater ' f solidity.^ However this may be, the power to discriminate at a glance between pearls of different Aqsam (singular, Qism^ ^ ^ or classes is possessed by all merchants ; and, such being the case, it is evident that the success of the individual trader depends chiefly on his power to appraise the relative fineness of pearls belonging to the same class,—an operation in which, as we have already remarked, there are no rules to assist his judgment. The merchant, even when otherwise illiterate, is ordinarily a clever mental arithmetician and benefits by the fluctuations of market rates and by the discrepancies of the weighing appliances in use in the Gulf. In Annexure No, 5 we have given the market rates per Bombay Chau only, but there are also market rates for the Bahrain, Qatar, and Poona Chaus, and, as these are not always in strict proportion, it is sometimes possible to buy cheap and sell dear by purchasing pearls according to one of these measures and disposing of them according to another ; conse quently a merchant who is versed in all the systems, and provided with the means of working by each, has a great advantage over a man who understands and practises only one of the four. The difference of weights in the Gulf is possibly a source of profit to some dealers of the less scrupulous kind, who pay attention to the discrepancies * ,* but a dealer detected in the use of false weights forfeits public confidence, and opportunities for individual frauds are few, because a seller does not often part with his pearls until they have been weighed and priced by a t UnlessBahrain Chau ' in Captain Durand's report is an error for ' Bombay Chau' the increase has been extraordinary. Assuming first that there is no mistake in the report we find that the average rate for the Yakah Baidha Mass in 1877 was Rs. 46 per Bahrain Chau or Ks. 11| per Bombay Chau, whereas in 1906 it wai Rs. 325 per Bombay Chau. This seems impossible ; but, on the alternative supposition even, the average rate rose from Rs. 46 to Rs. 325,—a very remarkable increase. Opinion in Bahrain, as elicited by further enquiry, favours the idea that Captaiu Durand's Chaus were Bombay Chaus (1908). ^he small weights representing the fractions of a Mithqal are frequently much heavier than they ought to be, Ratti weights being met with which are T V instead ^ &amp; of a Bombay Mithqal, and Bahrain and Qatar Habbahs which are ^ and tt of a Bahrain and a Qatar Mithqal respectively, instead of Weights are made of agate or brass, the former being the more esteemed as they are not attected oxidation.2240 number of different persons. About 20 years ago, however, when the local price of pearls had been rising for over 15 years, the dealers as a body endeavoured to combat the operatives by gradually adopting slightly heavier weights, while retaining the old denominations; when a point had been reached at which the pearlers refused to sell, the weights were made lighter again. The largest pearls are sent to India to be sold individually by the Chau; but, in the assortment of the remainder into packets, each packet containing pearls of the same class but not necessarily or usually of the same size, the ingenuity of the dealer finds further scope, for each of such packets, if skilfully made up, commands a price higher than the pearls composing it would obtain if disposed of separately. Dealers are consequently averse to breaking up their packets, and a fancy price must generally be paid for a single pearl selected from a packet of which the remainder are not taken.t The trade in mother-of-pearl. The principal mother-of-pearl emporia in the Gulf are Lingeh, Bahrain and Bushehr, and from these the shells are ordinarily shipped by direct steamer to Europe, where they are known by the name of ' Lingeli shells.^ The trade has been somewhat injudiciously conducted and has experienced more than one crisis. Until 1897-98 it was one m which European and respectable native firms were unwilling to engage, on account of fraudulent practices associated with it; but its character has since improved, and a German firm in Bahrain now takes an import ant share in the shell business. The local price of Mahhar shells is Es. 1 to 3 per 140 lbs., of Zanni shells Rs. 4 to 8 per 60 lbs., and of Sadaifi shells Re. i to i per 1 lb- The annual quantities exported since 1873 are given in Annexure No. 4 to this Appendix.

It has been ly] stated that the chiefs of Trucial 'Oman are entitled to receive, besides iallvS the dues mentioned in the Annexure No. 6, a share in the sale price of any pearl worth $200 or more which may have been found by a subject, but no particular share is specified, and it does not appear that the claim is universally, or even generally, admitted ; on the other hand a decision in favour of the Sultan of ' Oman, mentioned below, seems to raise a presumption that such a right is, in some circumstances, allowed. The first chief to levy dues is believed to have been the Shaikh of Bahrain, who is said to have instituted about the beginning of the 19th century, under the name of Nob vy &gt; a tax which was devoted (at least in theory) to the maintenance of 4 armed vessels on the banks for the protection of the Bahrain pearl fleet. With the growth of security under British surveillance of the Gulf these police vessels, if they ever existed, disappeared; but the system of taxation was maintained both by the Shaikh of Bahrain and by the other Arab chiefs, who had meanwhile followed his example.* The amount of the Nob was originally one diver's share per boat, but crews might compound for it at the rate, in early times of |3, and later of per operative. A second tax, called Taraz jl^&gt;, also came into general vogue many years ago; it was originally assessed at the rate of one diver's share for each boat. The intention was to provide the means of engaging hired watchmen in towns and villages during the absence in summer of the able-bodied male population ; and a part of the dues now realised is even yet spent in this manner on summer watchmen called Matraziyah, It appears that Nob is properly a tax on boats and Taraz a poll tax Persia on operatives, also that Nob was originally collected only in autumn and Taraz only in spring; but the terms are not now clearly understood even by the natives of the Gulf themselves. Much confusion has been caused by irregularity in collection, the people always endeavouring to | pay as little as possible, and the Shaikhs to take as much as they can, and that in advance. All the banks on the Persian side, with the exception of the bank 8 in the Lingeh District which are public, are subject to territorial juris- diction; this is partly due, no doubt, to the fact that they are all near tbe coast and in few, if any, cases more than 8 miles distant from land. H objects of the Shaikh in whose territory a bank is situated may work on it without special permission, and so may the subjects of a neighbouring Shaikh who is on terms of amity with the territorial haikh ; but all foreigners,—that is to say all others, and among them ra b pearl fishers from the opposite side of the Gulf,—-must come to a * There is some doubt as to the correctness of these statements. There is not now any perl taj called ISfab in Bahrain. 1512242 special arrangement with the local authority before they are allowed to dive on any Persian bank. The taxes ordinarily levied by the Shaikhs from their own subjects and from those of friendly Shaikhs on the same coast are given in Annexure No. 6 ; and here we may add that the Bum realised by the Shaikhs from outsiders who wish to work upon their banks generally varies from ^20 to $40 per boat for the season, aud that the permission is given in writing. The finder of a valuable pearl is expected to bring it secretly to the Shaikh, and, if he does so, he is generally compelled to part with it on payment of a mere fraction of its value ; if, on the other hand, he fails to bring it, his life and property will both be in danger. Revenue from the pearl fisheries is not as yet included in the Pessian Tumar or list of revenue assets for each district^ and the local k. hai s conceal the amount of their incomes from this source as best e } r can from the Persian Government. When the N iz am-as- Saltan en was ov- ernor of the Gulf Ports he aspired to levy a Malyat of 4,0 , on the pearl banks of the Shibkuh and Lingeh Districts; butttie Shaikhs refused to pay, and he was unable to give efiect to ws lo tions.

Under British protection the rights and safety of all are now perfectly secured, and breach of the peace at sea, on the pearl banks as elsewhere, is Dromptly and adequately punished : the latest instance occurred in 1900, when a fine of Rs. 1,500 was inflicted on the Al Bu ; Ali fleet for having dared to attack the boats of 'Amamarah pearl fishers while both were prosecuting their operations off the coast of Qatar. In 1897 an important agreement, having special reference to the circumstances of the pearl industry, was^ concluded by all the Shaikhs of Trucial 'Oman at the instance of the British authorities ; it provided for the mutual surrender by the Shaikhs of fraudulent absconders, especially pearl divers and sailors, from one jurisdiction to another.

If the facts were disputed the case was to be tried by a council or Majlis, whose decision, subject to confirma tion by the British Political Resident, should be final. The results of this agreement in practice have been beneficial; and it is obvious, in view of the peculiar financial conditions governing the fishery, that the existence of some such understanding is essential to the continuance of the industry on its present basis, which is largely one of credit. A case important to Arab rulers was one which arose in 1899 through the finding by a native of Kumzar, a subject of the Sultan of 'Oman, of an extremely valuable pearl, estimated, it is said, at about 8;500 Bombay Chaus; the question was of the share, if any, in the proceeds of the sale to which the Sultan, as sovereign of the finder, was entitled. The pearl was originally sold by the finders for $2,000 to subjectsof the Shaikh of Sharjah ; and, after coming into the posses sion of the latter, it was sent to Bombay, where it was valued at k 4 ; 00,000, and subsequently to London. The finders then claimed that tlie sale by them should be invalidated under a principle of Shara' law ; H in the end, they were apparently prevailed on to accept ^a sum of about $8,000, less commission. Meanwhile the Sultan of 'Oman, Wing heard of the case, had also demanded ^ cancellation of the sale; tins he did partly to assist the finders, his subjects, but partly also with a view to claiming a share in the proceeds. The matter was^ eventually fettled in 1901 by a Majlis held in Trucial 'Oman, whose decision, given in writing and approved by the Sheikh of Sharjah, awarded the Sultan the net price that might be obtained by the owners. The pearl a fter remaining unsold for some time in London, was brought back to )ay and disposed of there for Rs. 1,00^000, and the share of the 151 a Agreement to 8urrender debtors, 1897.

Wat son's project, 1857. Bombay syndicate, 1852. Disputes between local authorities are, however, of slight importance in comparison with the difficulties which might arise were the local divers on the Arabian banks to be subjected to the competition of Europeans furnished with scientific appliances, more especially if, as some authorities believe, the effect of deep-sea dredging would be to destroy the colonies from which the oysters upon the shallow beds accessible to native divers are recruited. The representatives of the Britisli Gov ernment, by whom the question has at different times been considered, have never doubted that, whether real damage were done to the native fisheries or not, the appearance of European rivals would arouse great animosity on the part of the Arabs, who regard the fisheries as their common bu exclusive inheritance; and, in view of this fact, as well as of the possibi lity that an industry, on which many thousands of persons depend or their subsistence might actually be destroyed, the British Governmen have never ceased to oppose, by such means as have presented themselves, the intrusion of foreigners—including European British subjects—in 0 the fishery. The question of European participation appears to haveansen for the first time in 1857, when Messrs. J. and W. Watson of were anxious to engage in the pearl fishery. Captain Felix Jones, . •» however, the British Political Resident, on the matter being reiene him, reported that plunder, if not bloodshed, would certainly be P rovo ^' and Her Majesty^s G overnment, in consequence apparently of this opm 1 ' refused to countenance operations by the firm. In the season of 1862 the steamer Johnstone Castle^ c ^ e ^ e by a Bombay syndicate, proceeded without official sanction 0 ^ Bahrain pearl banks and stationed there three Europeans an native employes, with patent diving machines, to carry on opeia ^ in a Baghlah; the steamer then crossed to Bushehr, w ^ ere i erg arrived at the beginning of July, and Mr. Plunkett, one of the c had an interview there with Captain Disbrowe, the Acting . ° Resident. The Acting Political Resident evidently regarded the si^ ^ as dangerous, for he immediately despatched a Government vessel ^ banks with instructions to remove the Baghlah from the ban bring it to Bushehr. On its arrival at Bushehr, on the 10th 0 ^ the boat was found to be of Turkish nationality,—a circumstance ^ might have occasioned complications^ but did not. The secreC ^ cerI1 ed which the enterprise had been managed was attributed by those c0 ^ ^ in it to the necessity of concealing their operations from a rival co ^ ^ and it appeared that their action had been taken in good fan^ strength of a statement contained in an official publication thatif^C 2245 J lOlCtf' ( f ^ere free to allThe total gains of the party during the days that they bad been at work were represented by 23 small seed pearls only. The affair^ however^ was reported to have given rise to some apprehension among the pearl divers of Bahrain^ and it led to a full discussion of policy between tLj Government of Bombay and the British Residents at Bushehr and Baghdad. Colonel Kemball^ the Resident at Baghdad^ who had long experience of the Persian Gulf, pointed out that the case which had occurred was a simple one, and that it would have been more difficult to deal with had the speculators been European foreigners holding a pearl fishing concession from some Arab chief ; his final recommendation was that the G overnment of India should treat the Persian Gulf as a mare ciausum, for the purpose of pearl diving, ao-ainst all persons coming from ports or coasts situated beyond its limits^ and should accordingly by proclamation refuse protection to such persons, whatever their nationality ; action on these lines would, he considered, be sufficient to deter Europeans, at least, from interference with the fisheries. The action of Captain Disbrowe and the views of Colonel Kemball were generally approved by the Government of Bombay, but the Resident in the Persian Gulf was enjoined to observe caution in matters which affected the rights either of foreigners or of Arabs, and he was ordered to report on the extent of the pearl banks and the nature of the rules and customs by which boundaries and rights were governed, as well as on the manner of settling disputes heretofore, and the best means of preserv ing the peace without involving the British Government in an in convenient protectorate. Colonel Pelly, the Resident at Bushehr, on the ground that no practical advantage was likely to be gained, whereas the suspicions of the Arabs would probably be aroused and inconvenient claims by Persia, Turkey and the Wahhabi ruler might be provoked, deprecated inquiry or any attempt to systematise the rights and customs of the fisheries; and at the same time he suggested that the proclamation of a mare clausvm in the Persian Gulf was a serious step, which might bring the British Government into conflict with European or American powers, and that a reserved attitude on the question would be preferable. In the end, no proclamation was made, and the demand for detailed information regarding the pearl fisheries was withdrawn by the Bombay Government. The international position of the pearl banks attracted no further attention until 1872, when it became known that Mid-hat Pasha, the Turkish Wali of Baghdad, contemplated the exploitation of certain pearl tanks in the Persian Gulf by means of an English diver. The diver reached Baghdad in May 1872, but a personal warning that British protection would not be extended to him in his operations apparently had the desired result, for, in the end, the Turkish scheme was not carried into effect. In 1873 a British firm, Messrs. Smith and Company, of London, favoured to obtain a footing as pearl fishers in the Gulf; and in uetober of that year—-while a request which they had made to the -oreign 0 fg ce for recognition and assistance was still under consideration -their representative in the person of Mr. Grant, an officer of the a J e Indian Navy, made his appearance at Bushehr. Here he had an Mierview with Colonel Ross, the Political Resident, who declined to Discussions regarding British policy, 1862- 1863.

Smith and Company's project. The next prospector to come forward was Mr. E. W. Streeter of London, who at the end of 1889 approached the Foreign Office with a request for their countenance in ti shing for pearls, with the permission of the Arab Shaikhs, at depths beyond the reach of native divers. Along with his application he submitted a pamphlet on the Gulf pearl nshenes, compiled by himself from all available sources of information, m which the existing methods were denounced as a a terrible system of bondage, as degrading and oppressive as slavery itselfColonel ^oss, e Resident in the Gulf, on being consulted, stated it as his opinion that the Arabs would not, of their own free will, consent to operations emg undertaken by Mr. Streeter; and that, even if they did, the snpF of Mr. Streeter's scheme by the British Government woul in responsibilities, the nature and extent of which it was ^P 0 ^, foresee.

The application was according yi « wou i(l Her Majesty's Government on the ground that compliance witniL be likely to give rise to serious difficulties but Mr. St ree ® a ^ apparently, at once renounce his ideas, for, in October it, . ^ Steinberger of Paris called upon Colonel Talbot, the ^ e , ^ Gulf, at Bushehr, and made enquiries, on behalf of ^ r - ^ ans on others, as to the feasibility of deep-water operations by 1^ ^ the Arabian side. His proposals were however discourag reported to his principals in a sense unfavourable to the under ^ Early in 1899 it was reported that attempts were j^the obtain from the Turkish Government a pearl fis hi n ^ f Conce Persian Gulf ; but enquiries which were set on foot at ^en showed that, if proposals had been made, they had no ^ entertained.

It was accordingly decided to warn to the Government of the possession of prescriptive rights, in r ^ ere j into Arabian fisheries, by the littoral Arabs whose chiefs had e co ^ rge ^as special relations with the G overnment of India: this ^ally dictated by the consideration that the British Government wer^» regarded as under an obligation to protect the Shaikhs of ' if u rki^ and Bahrain in the possession of their maritime rights. -^tion minister who was addressed promised to bear this common'2xr^ 2247 • ] and at the same time he denied that any recent application for ^oncession had been received by the Porte ; but, notwithstanding this V Maimer it was ascertained that one Montran Effendi Rashid W lately offered £T 100,000, on behalf of an Anglo-Syrian or Anglo- rf yptian syndicate, for a concession of the pearl fisheries in the Red S a and on the eastern coast of Arabia from Kuwait to Qatif, as well I a royalty of £T 40,000 per annum; that it had been ruled by the Turkish Financial Commissioner that the pearl fisheries were a matter ithin the province of the Public Debt Administration; and that the !rant of the proposed concession had been held to be impossible on account of the opposition of the Arab Shaikhs, of disturbances in Hasa, and of various other political obstacles. About the same time the f ali of Basrah was pressed by the Turkish Government to recover the full pearling dues payable in Qatar and Bahrain ; but he reported that the attitude of the Shaikhs made this impracticable, and that in any case two revenue cutters, which he had not at his disposal, would be required for the work. In July 1900 Ratansi Parshotam, a British Indian merchant settled Trucial at Masqat, after obtaining leave from the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi and making arrangements with the Bani Yas tribe, sent two Indian to grant drivers with diving apparatus to the pearl banks; but the venture concesBions, failed, in consequence, it was said, of the inexperience of the divers 1900. in pearling operations, and of the boat being taken by the Arab ! guides to an unsuitable place. The Government of India thought that J the affair, if no notice were taken of it, might form an embarrassing precedent; and Colonel Kemball, Political Resident at Bushehr, accord ingly gave it to be known that permission for such undertakings should not be granted in future by the Trucial Shaikhs, and that British subjects seeking to obtain permission should be referred to the i Resident. Enquiries by Colonel Kemball from the Shaikhs of Trucial 'Oman and Bahrain showed that the banks were regarded as the 1 common property of the coast Arabs, that no Shaikh had the right to grant permission for diving to foreigners, and that the appearance of divers equipped with European diving dresses would probably not be regarded with equanimity by the local operatives. Accordingly in March 1902, when Tek Chand Dwarka, a British Indian subject in Bahrain, stated that he had been offered a concession by the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi for pearl fishing by means of diving apparatus and enquired whether he could be guaranteed aga\inst molestation in case of his taking it up, he was informed by the Assistant Political Agent in Bahrain that it was not legally in the power of the Shaikh to grant any concession of the sort. The next symptom of outside interest in the pearl fisheries was the Belgian ven- visit of the ' Selika a small Belgian steam yacht, to the Persian Gulf in ture, 1901. the spring of 1901. The ' Selikaafter leaving Masqat, disappeared till the llth of April, or about a month later, when she made her appear ance at Bahrain ; but those on board admitted that most of the interim tad been spent in the neighbourhood of the pearl banks, and it was after- wards ascertained that on their return to Europe they had disposed of a quantity of small pearls. It is noteworthy that in the same year it was announced, in the British com- 'Daily Express' of the 9th of May 1901, that an influential German mumcation2248 to the Porte, 1901. Proceedings of M M. Dumas and Castelin, 1903. syndicate were negotiating with the Porte for a monopoly of tlie pearl fisheries along the Ottoman shores of the Eed Sea and Persian Gulf, with a view to working them by scientific methods; a somewhat similar statement also appeared at the same time in the ' Moniteur Oriental'. The British Ambassador at Constantinople accordingly brought it to the notice of the Porte that the operations which appeared to be contemplated would excite the jealousy of the natives^ and he alluded to the moral obligation under which the British Government lay to protect the rights of the Trucial Shaikhs in the matter. The Turkish Minister denied knowledge of the negotiations, but he promised to take note of the Ambassadors statement; and nothing further was heard of the syndicate or their scheme. The question of the international status of the pearl fisheries was at length, in 1903, brought to an issue by the apparent intention of two French subjects to establish themselves in Bahrain and take part in the industry. M M. Dumas and Castelin, the former a partner in the Marseilles firm of Dumas et Guien, arrived in Bahrain in February 1903; M. Dumas was provided with letters of recommendation from the French Ministries of Commerce and Foreign Affairs. On the 25th of March M. Dumas called on the British Political Resident at Bushehr and sound* ed him as to the possibility of engaging in the fishery; he was informed by Colonel Kemball that his operations would be attended by risk, and that he would probably meet with active opposition. M. Dumas then returned to Bahrain, and in April he made advances to the Shaikh through Tek Chand ; but his overtures were repulsed by the Shaikh, who asserted the grant of a pearling concession to be impossible. Ult 1 ' mately, in May 1903, his affairs making no progress, and an outbreak of plague having occurred, M. Dumas left Bahrain and was not again seen there; but the importance and scope of the questions which his project had all but raised were now fully appreciated, and steps were taken by the It was Legal opinion in regard to British policy, 1905. Government of India to bring them to a settlement, foreseen that, in event of the forcible intrusion on the fishery of European foreigners, the Trucial Shaikhs would immediately appeal for protection to the British Government; and it was therefore necessary that a line of policy should be laid down in advance. The matter was placed before His Majesty's Government in a despatch of the Government of India, dated the 8th of March 1904, and it was subsequently referred for opinion to the Law Officers of the Crown. The finding of the Law Officers, dated the 11th of February 1905, dealt separately with the question of the rights of the Arab tribes and witn that of effective steps for their protection. The Law Officers were of opinion that, within the three-mile limjt and in any other waters which might justly be considered territorial, the tribes o the Arabian coast were entitled to the exclusive use of the pearl fisheuc 6 - As regards pearl banks outside territorial waters it was held that, as ama er of international law, such banks were capable of being the property oi ® tribes to the exclusion of all nations ; and the case of the Ceylon banks and the views of various authorities* were cited in support of ^ remarked ^ . publi . &lt;:ist 7attel ^ » his 'Droit de. G™'' ^ logitlmemeot tomber en 1 ' eneS ^ PerleS de Bahrcia et de Ceyla ' n2249 • v • whether such proprietary rights existed in the case of the Persian Gulf banks or not was, however, a question the answer to which must on the evidence available as to the enjoyment of the bank fisheries depend , n e ^ibes and the exclusion of others from them. It was added, with •eference to the banks, that there appeared to be grounds for asserting the l ossession by the tribes of an exclusive right of fishery ; that the enjoy- nient of such a right by the tribes in common was not a bar in law to its acquisition ; and that, regard being had to the relations of His Majes ty's Government with the tribes on the western shores of the Gulf, the existence of the right might properly be maintained on their behalf bv His Majesty's Government. With regard to deep waters, where the tribes themselves had not been accustomed to fish, it did not appear to the Law Officers that a claim by the tribes to exclude aliens from such waters could be advanced with any chance of success. The recommendations of the Law Officers in regard to practical measures of protection were that fishing by foreigners within territorial waters might be prevented, but that indirect means should, if possible, be taken to discourage them from pearling on the non-territorial banks or in deep water; in the last resort, however, it would be admissible, in the case of the banks only, to effect the compulsory removal of the vessels; but such measures should be takenvvith caution, and only after obtaining authority from the local chiefs. The Law Officers also pointed out that the whole question might be raised, if this were considered politic, in a form suitable for decision by the Hague Tribunal; but they added that, as the result of such a reference was uncertain, it would probably be better to avoid raising the question internationally. International political questions on the Persian side, 1883-1907. The Persian pearl banks are situated, almost without exception, in the territorial waters of Persia, and their international status is correspond ingly clear; moreover, as they are subject to the chiefs in whose jurisdic tions they lie, there is not in their case any question of common popular rights on a large scale. Any difficulties which may arise on this side of the Gulf are likely to concern the Persian Government chiefly, and to have their origin in a conflict between the rights of the central Govern ment and those of the local chiefs, who, as we have seen, have been able up to the present time, to exclude the Government from any share in the profits of the fishery. Mevertheless, the question of pearl diving opera tions under European or other foreign auspices is not without importance even on the Persian coast. In 1882 a concession to fish for pearls on the Persian banks was obtained by the Mukhbir-ud-Dauleh, the Persian Minister of Telegraphs, who was also a candidate at the same time for a navigation concession on tbe Karun River and for oil-mining rights elsewhere; in all these schemes he was, either openly or privately, associated with the Butish firm of Messrs. Gray, Paul &amp; Co. of Bushehr. The pearl fishing concession was the only one of the various projects which actually came into operation; it was expressly restricted to the territorial waters of The Mtikh- bir-ud- Dauleh's concessionj 1882.2250 Illicit enter prise of a British Indian, 1883.

A European professional diver was brought out and tried the banks near Lingeh and Kharag^ but the results were poor and tlie operations ended in loss. An attempt to exploit the Persian banks with modern appliances was also made by a Kbojah, a British Indian subject, who arrived at Lingeh in May 1883 with two Indian divers and a diving dress ; he proposed to experiment first on the Persian side and then on the coast of ; 0man. Disregarding an injunction by the Commander of H. M. S. 'Philomel' to wait until his intentions had been reported to proper authority and orders obtained, he commenced operations on the Persian but his enterprise was a failure, and he eventually returned to apparently without visiting the Arab banks. About 1890, persistent efforts were made by several foreign c to obtain a pearl fishing concession from the Persian Government, but the particulars are obscure. Perhaps the first to move were the Armenian firm of Messrs. T. J. Malcolm &amp; Co., trading under British protection at Bushehr, with whom were associated in this matter the British shipping firm of Messrs. Strick &amp; Co., London. Other would-be concessionaires, among them Mr. Streeter of London, appear to have been in the field soon afterwards; and the Persian Bank Mining Eights Corporation seem to have advanced a claim to the pearl fisheries as falling within the scope of their mining concessions, but it was disallowed by the Persian Government. Eventually the promise of a monopoly was obtained by Messrs. Malcolm, but it was almost immediately revoked at the instance of the British Legation at Tehran; the reasons for the action of the Legation are not ascertainable in India. Nothing more was then heard of the matter until the end of 1893, when Mr. Streeter made inquiries from Colonel Talbot, lately Residen in the Persian Gulf, whether Messrs. Malcolm were a firm witb whom he might safely have relations. On the 6th of January 1894, Mr. T. J. Malcolm approached the Foreign Office in London and sought to obtain withdrawal^ ot ^ objections to the grant of a concession in his favour. The point was referred to the Government of India, who regarded Mr. Malcolm s re( K e ^ with disfavour on account of the political complications with local c ie which its acceptance might entail, of the impossibility of^ making su that operations would really be confined to Persian territorial wa er, and of the probability that a stimulus would be given to Europ 6 ^ interest in the pearl fisheries of the Gulf generally. I 11 ^ ® ^ Mr. Malcolm's application was rejected, with the remark i ^ working of the concession would give rise to serious difficulties an Her Majesty's Government were therefore unable to lend their supp 01 ' • In March 1898, a pearl fishing monopoly was at length ^ a ^ 11 ^ granted by the Persian Government to M. Sunye, a Spaniar , M. Hagens, a Belgian, both of whom were adventurers of 110 ^V 110 ^gt bad character; the term of the grant was for 30 years from the ^ of March 1898. The privileges conveyed were restricted to deep inaccessible to native divers, but they extended, subject to ^ provision, and to a special stipulation against interference ^ rights or methods of the existing native divers to ' W 0 the Persian coasts/' In return for the concession an annual i0 j2261 f 250 000 francs was to be paid by the holders to the Persian Govern- t a merc l iant ^ London was ^Vd by a French correspondent in Paris to form a syndicate for taking the concession, but, before the negotiations had made any progress, f 8 W as informed by M. Sunye that the concern had now passed into jf Panels of Russian capitalists ; M. Sunye explained that the con- ion which had lapsed through non-payment of the first instalment of the royalty, had been renewed in his sole name through Russian influence. UDto the end of June 1900 the first instalment of the royalty was still ap- arently unpaid, and attempts had been made to place the concession at Odessa • hut the utmost secrecy was maintained by those interested, and little information could be obtained. There is some reason to think that the visitof the ' Selika ' to the Gulf in 1901, already mentioned, was connec ted with this matter ; but active operations under the concession have not vet been begun (1907), and the concession may possibly have lapsd.^ In 1899 and 1900 the subject of this concession was discussed Communira- withthe Persian Government, who at first asked the reason of the British J; 10 ^ ^ inquiries and were informed m reply that all matters connected with ^j t e y ian d pearl fishing rights in the Persian Gulf were of interest to Britain, especi- Persian ally when there was any question of conceding them to foreigners. The Govern- chief uncertainty, however, was as to the actual local limits of the Sunye ment s , concession, and it necessitated a warning to the Persian Government that igoo ' Her Majesty's Government could not recognise any contract which might interfere with the rights exercised by chiefs under British protection; to this the Mushir-ud-Dauleh merely replied, with some reserve, that the Persian Government could only grant a concession in so far as their own rights extended, and that it was out of the question that British rights should be affected. Reference to the charts of the Persian Gulf showed that the deep waters within Persian jurisdiction, to which alone the concession could apply, were of trifling extent, not exceeding 820 square geographical miles in all. ^ The latest venture threatening European interference with the Recent pro- Persian pearl fisheries is that of the Sponge Exploration Syndicate ce ^' n ^ of Limited, a company with a nominal capital of £1,000, _ registered m fore ; g p nel . s- London bnt directed chiefly hy foreigners of various nationalities. In 1905 the company more than once addressed the Foreign Office m London, seeking their good offices for the purpose of obtaining concessions; they at first described their business as that of « sponge, pearl and coral finders but subsequently declared their intention to occupy themselves, in the Persian Gulf, exclusively with sponges. No assistance was_ given them; but during the late Shah's tour in Europe, they succeeded^ in pro curing at Vichy, on the 29th of August 1905, a 5.0 years' concession and monopoly for sponge fishing in Persian waters. Under this author ity some diving was carried on in 1905 and 1906 by GreeK employes of the syndicate ; but nothing happened to fulfil the expectation, locally entertained, that attempts would be made by the company to combine illicit pearl fishing with their legitimate operations m sponges. A Parisian jeweller. Mine. Nattan, came to Bahrain for the pear season of 1905 and remained there from the beginning of August till the end of October. She had some difficulty in establishing relations with the local dealers, but eventually succeeded in buying pearls on the spot to the amount of Rs. 40,000.2253 The statistics for the year 1905-06, in which Kuwait figures for the first time ; are as follow :~ Bahrain ....... , 1,26,03,000 Trucial 'Oman &lt; 80,00,000 Lingeh . . ..... 6,95,861 Kuwait ....... 1,34,700 Masqat . . ..... 22,500 Bandar'Abbas . . . . . . Nil. giving a total value, at the present rate of exchange, of £ 1,4 34,399 sterling. A few remarks explanatory of the fluctuations from year to year of the total estimated value of the pearl harvest may not be out of place here. The principal factors are the number and quality of the pearls obtained, which vary from year to year, and the prices ruling in the market; the second of these considerations is perhaps the more important, and, in comparing recent years with early ones in the table above, it must be remembered that average prices have more than doubled since 1877. The number of the pearls obtained depends^ partly, on the greater or less productivity of the oysters and, partly, on accidents of weather, epidemic 3, etc., which interfere with diving operations. In 1877 the yield of pearls was good, but bad weather counteracted the success of the operations. In 1883 a new bank in 3 fathoms was found to the south of Halul Island. The season of 1885 was unpropitious, and a number of deaths from deep diving occurred. In 1893 cholera in Bahrain, and in 1894 fever in Trucial 'Oman, made those seasons less successful than they would otherwise have been. In 1896 and 1897 many boats and lives were lost in consequence of storms. In 1899, in anticipation of the Paris Exhibition of 1900, there was much speculation locally in pearls j but the speculators failed to realise the prices they expected, and many bankruptcies followed. The take in 1901 was good, as regards both quantity and quality, and the approach of the coronation of His Majesty King Edward VII caused a local rise in the price of pearls. In 1902 the season was a good one for divers, but unprofitable to dealers, as local prices continued to increase. In 1903 the yield was not very large; but the quality was good, and prices still went on rising on the spot, in advance of the Bombay market. In 1904 there was a strong reaction, many of the previous season's pearls being still unsold : the take also was less, partly in consequence of gales.2255 The statistics for the year 1905-06 were as follow Es. Bahrain • ' 86,500 Masqat 76,000 Ling®! 1 ...» . . s 12,119 giving a total value, at the present rate of exchange, £11,5 72. sterling. The fluctuations in the mother-of-psari trade appear to depend chiefly on irregularities of demand, for supply can be assured so long as prices are good. In December 1891 the Shaikh of Bahrain conferred a monopoly of the shell export trade in his dominions on a British firm at Bushehr; the protests of Bahrain merchants soon caused him to revoke the concession, but he substituted for it, at first, a duty so heavy that it was feared the trade might be extinguished. In 1892-93 large quantities uf inferior shells from the Persian coast were^ exported, with the result that in the following year there was no demand in Europe and the prices of shells fell very low, and in 1894-95 shells became almost unsaleable j but in the next year the market began to recover. In 1898-1899 there was a strong European demand, which led to gpeculation in shells and to the exportation of shells of bad quality, followed in 1899-1900 by heavy losses among Gulf merchants engaged in the trade. Prices were poor in 1900-01, and in 1901-02 the European market m still overstocked. In 1903-04 the trade underwent a sudden develop ment in Bahrain in consequence of the local operations oi Herr Wonckhaus, a German merchant.2256 ANNEXURE No. 3.—TABLE OF BOATS AND MEN EMPLOYED IN THE PEARL EISHERIES OF THE PERSIAN GULF, 1907.* Arabian Region.

Tims, on the Arabian side, the total number of boats owned and employed in the pearl fisheries is at the present time abwufc o T 5/7, I52a2262 employed on the boats is 8,884 ; it follows that the average crew of a Persian pearl boat is less than 10 hands. The total number of pearl boats in the whole Persian Gulf is apparently about 4^500, and the number of men who engage in pearl diving exceeds 74,000. The average size of a pearl boat varies, as will be observed, from one part of the Gulf to another; but it may be stated generally that the crew of a sea-going boat is from 6 to 42 hands, while that a boat working along the coast only is usually from 4 to 6. In some localities, however, especially upon the Persian side, men work entirely single-handed in Varjis or small skiffs. It will be noticed that, in some places, the number of hands required to man the boats belonging to the port is much larger than the port itself could possibly supply. The explanation is that the crews are completed by strangers : in Oman these strangers are, to a large extent. Bedouins from the Dhafrah, Baraimi and Dhahirali districts. More than half of the pearl fishing industry in the Persian Gulf is under the protection or virtual protection of Great Britain, the figures in this respect being :— Protecting power.

Endeavour has been made, in all the topographical articles in the Geographical Volume, to indicate roughly, where possible, the numbers of date palms. A quantity of information regarding rarieties of dates, etc., which was obtained for this Gazetteer but could not A2295 ,i e plantations form an almost continuous belt, sometimes 7 miles deep, loner the coast; in Wadi Samail the palms are estimated at 600,000 ; ^ the Badiyah division of Sharqiyah there are some 158,000 date JJees Large groves also exist at places in Dhahirah, especially at ^Ibri, Jhere the trees are supposed to number about 50,000. The best known Lecies of dates in the 'Oman Sultanate are the Mibsali , Fard t', and Khalas ; of these the Fard is a small dark-coloured date grown mostly in Wadi Samail, while the palms of Badiyah are chiefly Mibsali. In Sharqiyah generally the Mibsali abounds. By natives of the country the Mibsali date seems to be preferred to The date all other kinds ; but it is also much appreciated in India and is exported ^ in considerable quantities from Sur to Bombay. The Fard is a very favourite date in America, where the supply is hardly ever equal to the demand; and an attempt has been made, though as yet without much success, to acclimatise the Fard palm in Arizona, The exportation of dates from the 'Oman Sultanate depends chiefly history of upon accidents of season. In 1878 the crop was ruined by heavy and th( unseasonable rain, which fell just as the fruit had begun to ripen ; but 'Qraan Sul&gt; in 1879, a year in which there was no rain, the yield was excellent, tanate, 1878' and the export was double that of the preceding season. 7i). In 1880 it was remarked that the exportation of dates from the 1880. 'Oman Sultanate, not only to India, Yaman and Zanzibar, but also to America, was increasing ; dates were exported from Sur, Quryat and the Batinah coast as well as from Masqat, and it was believed that half the trade of the country thus escaped registration. In 1881, in consequence of a bad harvest, few dates were exported 1881-82. from Masqat; but in the following year the crop was exceptionally good and heavy consignments abroad were made. In 1883 the trade to America was rapidly increasing, and, to 1883. meet the American demand, Fard palms were rapidly being planted. In 1884 the New York market was reported temporarily over- 1884 stocked ; but large quantities of dates went as usual to America, South Arabia and East Africa. In 189&amp; the supply of dates for exportation was short, in conse- 1892. quence of political disturbances in Wadi Samail which interrupted for a time communication between the Sharqiyah district and the port of Masqat. In 1898 there was a heavy decrease in the quantity of dates 1898, sent to India, America and Turkey in Asia ; it was due to a bad crop, resulting from the failure of certain hot dry winds without which, it is said, the date cannot ripen. l)e embodied in the present Appendix wUl be found hi the Office Library, Simla, in Special Reports on Date Culture and the Date Trade in the Per nan Gulf 1906, Misc. No V. N. 140. Some facts in regard to the date trade are ascertain- able from the annual Administration Reports of the Persian Gulf Political Residency and in the Consular Reports for Basrah, Baghdid and Muhammareh; from Mr. H. W. Maclean's Beport on the Conditions and Prospects of British Trade %n Persia, 1903 ; and from Mr. A. H. Gleadowe -Newcomen s Beport on the Commercial Mission to South-Eastern Persia during 1904-05, printed 1906.2296 1901. 1901. In 1901 crop and demand were both good, and a prosperous was the result. In 1904, in consequence o£ a two years' droughty the date crop Was ^ in places the scantiest on record for fifteen years, and there was a considerable falling off in the export. In the seven seasons from 1899-1900 to 1905-1906 inclusive, the average annual value of the dates exported from Masqat was nearly £81,000, and the bulk of the export in each year went to India. The separate figures for these years are given in the Annexure to this Appendix. Trucial 'Oman. Date produo* tion in Tru- oia! 'Oman. The date trade in Tru cial 'Oman. Except in the Ras-al-Khaimah district and in the Baraimi Oasis, the latter of which can scarcely be considered to belong to this division, the production of dates is small ; the fruit also, along the greater part of the coast, never fully ripens for want of water and is eaten fresh. At Ras-al-Khaimah there are 42 varieties of date^ at Khatt in the same neighbourhood 20, and at Umm-al-Qaiwain and Dibai 22 each ; among the best sorts are those known as Lulu yJyJ , Khanaizi aI1 ^ Qash Rubai'' , while among the most plentiful are the Eul 'Adhuj jj j Qash Habash and Qash 'Afar • In the Baraimi Oasis, where there are about 60,000 palms, the Mibsali, Fard and Khalas are grown ; but they are not equal to their congeners of Sharqiyah and Wadi Samail in the 'Oman Sultanate. The few dates produced in Trucial 'Oman are far from satisfying the large demand of the somewhat dense pearl-fishing population; and, during the six years from 1899-1900 to 1904-05, dates and date juice were imported to an annual average value of more than £20,000^ chiefly from Persian ports and from Turkish 'Iraq.

In 1904 and 1905 the date harvest in the Bahrain Islands was below the normal. During the seven years from 1899- 1900 to 1905-06 inclusive, the average annual value of the dates and date iuice imported into Bahrain was about £35 185, and of that pynorted only £19,000 ; the export is, to a large extent, a re-export of Hasa dates. It was estimated that on the Slst of December 1904 there were 10 000 cwts. of dates in hand in Bahrain, awaiting despatch to Red Sea ports and to Egypt. Of the dates grown in Bahrain, those of which the value does not exceed Rs. H per Qallah^ of 37 Jibs, are ordinarily sold as Tamar that is in the dried condition, while those of hioher value are sold only as Ratab or fresh fruit; but the variety called Khanaizi is sold both dried and fresh, and is also boiled for export. Boiled dates are generally known as Saluq • Hasa Sanjaq. trade in Dates are the chief staple, both of agriculture and of trade, m the ^ ^ the Hasa Saniaq ; the average annual production is estimated at no less than date , 75 000 tons, viz., 51,GOO tons in the Hasa Oasis and 24,000 in the Hli8a .

Of the dates produced m the Hasa Oasis about one-third belong to the most esteemed variety, here the Khalas, and half to a class called Razaizi LSjij)- Hasa Oasis dates ate never boiled for exportation ; those sent abroad mostly go to Bahrain or, through Bahrain, to the Red Sea and Qatar. Qatif Oasis dates are exported largely to 'Oman and Persia ana in a lesser degree to Bahrain or, through Bahrain, to India ; those destined for India are boiled. In 1904 the date crop m the Hasa and Qatif Oases was magnificent, and in 1905 it was exceptionally good. Kuwait.

In the Aflaj district the plantations are extensive but thin. In Qasim a certain surplus of dates is produced; at ^Anaizah, the principal market, they sometimes sell at 30 lbs. to the dollar. There is generally some exportation to Jabal Shammar, and in exceptional years dates are even exported to Madinah. In Jabal Shammar, though dates are numerous in places, production hardly appears to equal consumption. The valleys of Jabal Aja and Jabal Salmah contain numerous plantations, owned to a considerable extent by Bedouins; the groves in the ''Aqdah amphitheatre alone, in the former range, are believed to aggregate 75,000 trees. In the Taimah Oasis some of the palms are 90 feet high and are said to be 200 years old ; the produce generally is excellent. At Jauf-al-^Amir some 15 kinds of date are grown, among them the Hilwah a juicy, luscious variety, which is found also at Taimah. At Kahifah, on the Qasim border, the best kind of date is the Fankhah , which is large and yellow. Turkish Iraq. Dates are one of the most important products of Turkish ; Iraq; they are grown chiefly on the banks of the Shatt-al-^Arab both above and below Basrah, on a stretch of the Euphrates extending 30 miles downwards from Hillah Town, in the neighbourhoods of Karbala and Najaf, and about Baghdad City. The palm belts which extend along both banks of the Shatt-al-'Arab have a depth of half a mile to two miles and are estimated to contain about 1,900,000 trees on both banks and on the islands between Basrah and Muhammareh, and about 250,000 trees on the right bank only below Muhammareh. In the Hillah Gadna there are about 330,000 palms; in that of Karbala about 750,000, 01 which some 50,000 belong to the Shifathah oasis; and in that of Na3 a about 250,000, of which perhaps 170,000 are situated in the Kuta Nahiyah on the banks of the Shatt-al-Hindiyah. Most of the dates ex ported from ^Iraq are grown near Basrah, the best being the kinds known as Halawi and Khadhrawi , while other miscellaneous # The statement seems incredible ; it is from a native source.

The bulk of the trade is in dates grown near Basrah, which are exported in boxes to England and America; but a proportion consists in Zahdis and Kursis of Baghdad origin, which are pacu in skins and now go chiefly to Egypt, the Levant, and Black Sea The Basrah date crop was estimated in 1887 at 60,000 tons, and of this amount about 44,000 tons were exported : viz., 20,000 tons by steamer to London, for Europe and America, and 24,000 tons by native sailing vessels to Arabia, Persia and India. The Halawi date was at this time the favourite in Europe and America, and the Zahdi had some sale in India. In 1888 a prohibition against the export of dates from Baghdad^ which had been in force for some years, was removed; and in this season some 30,000 skins of Baghdad dates were exported to London by 3 or 4 merchants, to whom the trade was then confined. In 1889 the quantity of dates shipped at Basrah was larger than in any previous year and prices were high; but some native merchants speculated recklessly, packed unripe dates, and were ruined; by these events the trade was thrown more into European hands than before. Many new groves were being planted at this time in ''Iraq to meet the increase of the trade. In 1891 the date crop in ; Iraq was excellent. In 1892 it was reported that the production of dates in the Basrah neighbourhood had increased fivefold during the preceding 12 years; and that, whereas 12 years previously nearly all the dates exported were packed in baskets and went to England, part were now boxed for Europe and America, while the remainder, in skins, had begun to take a leading place in the Indian, African and Eed Sea markets, but were in small demand in Europe. In 1893, during the first part of the season, there was a doubt whether the Government of the United States, on account of a cholera epidemic, would allow the importation of Persian Gulf dates. The previous year had been a prosperous one at Basrah and large stocks of date boxes had been laid in by exporters, whereby growers were encouraged to demand excessive prices ; but at the end of the packing season the growers, as great quantities of dates still remained on their hands, lowered their prices, and a large exportation of dates in baskets took place. In this year the date crop of the Baghdad region was not very large, in quality it was exceptionally good; as usual the operations at only lasted a short time, for there only the first of the new crop is exported. In 1894 the crop in the Basrah neighbourhood was a plentiful one, and moderate profits were obtained by holders who realised promptly, but those who did not sell until the end of the year suffered heavily from a fall of 25 per cent, in European prices. This fall was attributable partly to a prohibitive new duty imposed by the French Government on Date trade in Turkish 'Iraq. History of the date trade in Turkish 'Iraq, 1887. 1888. 1889. 1891-92. 1893; 1894.2300 the common dates till then imported at Marseilles and Havre for dis tilling, and partly to an extra import duty placed on wet dates in America; but by the low prices resulting in London, whither the ship ments were in some cases diverted and sold at prices hardly covering freight and charges/the demand in the Midlands and Lancashire was stimulated. At Baghdad, as at Basrah, the crop in this year was heavy and good and large quantities of dates were exported in September and October, chiefly to Syria, where however the prices were about 20 per cent, below those of the previous year; but in November the winter rains at Baghdad began unusually early and caused serious damage, for the dates still remaining on the trees turned black, fermented, and became un saleable. 1895. Tn 1895 the date crop at Basrah was below the average, nevertheless it was in excess of the demand in Europe ; the Basrah exporters, how ever, combined to reduce the yearns pack and in the end got!the better ot the growers, who had at first demanded high prices. The London date market this season opened low, but it gradually improved, and Basrah shippers in the end realised good profits. At Baghdad, in 1895, the crop was only one-third of average, the blossoms having appeared too early ; the local price ^ was consequen y about £9 sterling per Taghar of 4,215 pounds, as against £7 in the pre ceding year. 1896. ( ^ e ^ roves ^ Basrah neighbourhood were seiiously damaged in 1896 by long-continued flooding of the Shatt-al- Arab, an^ the mischief was aggravated by excessive heat and by a south -eas win which blew from the middle of August to the middle of Sep em e, causing large quantities of unripe dates to shrivel and fall from the ree , the result was a serious diminution in both the bulk and the qua 1 J the crop. In consequence of large supplies of boxes having been in advance, there was a rush of dealers to purchase, and prices at ^ asi^ rose rapidly ; but a strong combination of selling agents having ^ formed in London, the prices at home and in the American marke forced up, and Basrah shippers in the end succeeded in obtai i 0 tolerably remunerative prices. The Baghdad crop in 1895 was fairly good, and shipments^ Jaffa, Bairut, Smyrna and Constantinople realised good prices; bu made to England sold at a loss. The total export from Basrah in this year amounted to ab 0 600,000 cases, of which 490,000 were sent to London in the ' 53,000 to New York direct, and 57,000 to Bombay and Meai^ ranean ports. 1897. In 1897 the quantity of dates exported from Basrah was lar»^ than usual; but this was mainly due to a large increase in the num ^ native exporters, to whom British firms—imprudently, as was beiiev gave facilities, and whom they financed ; the London market, was overstocked, and the prices obtained from shippers by growers excessive.2301 The date crop at Baghdad in this year was above the average, but rain was so scarce that the export of dates was prohibited by the Turkish authorities. The Basrah crop in 1898 was small, and prices were kept high by 1898. o-rowers, who can combine in a way that is impossible to merchants ; in the struggle between these two classes the latter are always at a ^advantage, as they have not only to lay out large sums in boxes, but also to engage freight in advance, with the result that later they must either ship or pay dead freight. Until late in the season, when a scar city of Smyrna figs increased the demand for dates, no margin of profit was left to exporters ; the average cost of landing Halawis in London was at first 145. 6d. and the selling price only 15s. The yield in the Baghdad neighbourhood was fairly good in this year, but the embargo of the previous year on exportation , was main tained by the Turkish authorities in consequence of a continued scarcity of grain. The total number of cases leaving Basrah in this year was about 500,000 of ^ a cwt. each; of these 65,000 were exported direct to New York, and 70,000 to Port Said for transhipment to Mediterranean ports. The heavy floods of 1896, as already mentioned, did great damage 1899. to the date plantations of lower Turkish r lraq, and the yield of dates in 1897 and 1898 remained comparatively small; but in 1899 the position of earlier years was regained. Large speculative sales were made in England in this year before the crop ripened and proved highly remunerative, the prices paid by exporters to growers having generally been low. The export of dates grown in the 1899 season continued into January and February 1900 and swelled the returns of that year. There was a great demand for dates in India on account of famine, enabling growers to export their surplus to that country as a basket' dates. The Baghdad crop in this year, was good, and towards the end of the season some exportation took place, merging in that of Basrah. In 1900, encouraged by the results of the previous year, exporters 1900. again arranged for extensive operations; but the crop, though abundant, was inferior on account of cool dry winds which prevailed during the summer and parched the fruit upon the trees. Local growers combined to raise prices, the European market was low, and most exporters in the end lost heavily ; but the export nevertheless exceeded the normal ^ by some 6,000 tons and large unsaleable stocks accumulated in the United Kingdom. The Basrah date crop almost invariably promises well at the begin- 1901. ning of the season; but, though almost independent of rainfall, it frequently disappoints the anticipations formed. The year 1901 was no exception to this rule, a promising crop being ruined by hot dry winds at the time of ripening ; the produce was in consequence hardly up to the average in quantity, and it was so unequal in quality that for the first time on record Halawi dates were graded in two classes; but the season was a more favourable one to merchants than 1900, for, though profits were not particularly large, fewer losses were made and those2302 who held on to their stocks obtained good prices. Two direct steamers instead of one as usual, carried dates to America; and a Russian steamer shipped dates straight for Levant ports, which it had hitherto been the custom to tranship at Port Said. Part of the export in this year con sisted of basket dates of the 1900 crop. The yield of dates in the Baghdad neighbourhood was good and plentiful; and, though larger quantities than usual were kept in hand for local consumption, the poorer class falling back on dates in default of grain, the exportation to Egypt and Syria was considerable, Local prices ranged from £8 to £9 per Taghar. 1902 cro P in the Basrah district was an average one, but the season was unsatisfactory to shippers; heavy sales of Halawis and Khadhrawis had been made in advance in London, and, though Sairs were abundant, the other two kinds were deficient; growers also combined to maintain prices. Many exporters lost heavily. The Baghdad crop of 1902 was not much below the average, but an embargo on exportation prevented, to a great extent, the usual consign ments to Egypt and Syria. A quantity of dates for abroad was smug- gled from Hillah, however, down the river Euphrates. 1903. The Basrah crop of Halawi and Sair dates in 1903 was large and the quality of both varieties good; but Khadhrawis were scarce and poor. Local prices, in consequence of a combination among growers, were high as compared with the low rates at which speculative sales had been made in London, and shippers who had sold in advance suffered serious loss; the London market also continued to decline; and eventually dates became almost unsaleable in England. The Baghdad crop was fair in quantity but inferior in quality; there was however a strong demand for Kursi dates in Egypt and Syria and at Constantinople, and large quantities purchased at £7-10-0 to £9-10-0 per Taghar were exported. 1904. The Basrah date crop in 1904 was much smaller than tbat of the previous year; this was due to strong north-west winds which prevailed almost all the summer and made the dates dry and light. The financial misfortunes of 1903 had caused many merchants to withdraw from the date trade ; and again in 1904 few exporters of dates made any profits in the British market, while a number on the contrary lost heavily through the prevalence of low rates in America and of relatively high prices at Basrah. The export to America in this year was about 6,000 tons or the same as in 1903 ; and about 100 tons were sent by native merchants to Russia as an experiment, which turned out successfully. The crop of Zahdi and Kursi dates around Baghdad was fair in quantity, but the quality was not good. Importation at Levant ports was forbidden on account of the prevalence of cholera in the Persian Gvlt, and this circumstance further affected the trade, 1905&gt; Early in the year it was predicted, from climatic conditions, the state of the river and the appearance of the trees, that the Basrah crop of 1905 would be an unusually large one; but'this expectation was not r\-2303 u except in the case of Sairs; Halawis and Khadhrawis, f 8 ! excellent in quality, were short in quantity. Large forward sales I dbeen made by native merchants in London and Continental markets ? 1 v prices; but the despatch of a larger quantity of dates than had I n foreseen to America caused rates to rise locally, and the level which , reac lied was maintained by the shortness of the crop : the result was 6 6 fw — - Tunis and Oran, where new markets for these varieties appeared to be profitable business and heavy loss to shippers, A new feature of the year was a considerable shipment of Halawis and Khadhrawis to Egypt, The dates exported to India were, as usual, mostly Sairs; the largest' quantities went in October and November, after which, the Bombay market being overstocked, the trade declined. Large quantities of pressed dates in baskets were kept back for a more favourable market. In this season prices at Basrah opened as follows :— Halawis, at 260 Shamis (or £16-13-2) per 40 Manns of 143 lbs. each, or about £7-0-0 per ton; Khadhrawis, at 230 Shamis per 40 Manns ; and Sairs, at 160 Shamis per 40 Manns. At the end of October, however, the price of Sairs rose to 175 Shamis. The Baghdad crop in this year was very large, and Zahdi dates sold at 85. per 220 lbs. and Kursi dates at £7-11-6 to £8-8-4 per Taghar. The statistics of exportation from Basrah between 1899-1900 and 1905-06 are given in the Annexure to this Appendix. A meeting of growers and exporters generally takes place early in September of each year to settle the prices of dates for the season ; it^ is sometimes held at Abul Khasib, which is a centre of great activity during the date harvest. 'Arabistan. In the Persian province of ^Arabistan dates for export are grown Date prodnc- on a considerable scale in the district of Muhammareh, and to a lesser fcion and the extent in the district of Pallahiyeh ; in the other districts the quantity ^tetrsw^m of exportable dates is negligible. In a poor year (1897) the yield of the whole Muhammareh district, including the banks of the Bahmanshir, was estimated at 5,310 tons. The best kind of date in ''Arabistan is the Qantar } which is rich in syrup but is not exported, the Khadhrawi j here the best kind packed for export to Europe ; the Halawi , not locally esteemed, but reckoned to come next after the Khadhrawi for the purpose of exportation; the Sa'maran which is packed for Europe; the Sair or ' miscellaneous, 33 comprising various sorts, which goes to India and other places abroad; the Dairi which is deficient in syrup and dries hard; the Braiyim ^ which is boiled and dried in the hard stage; and the App D—12304 Zahdi (jWAj, borne by palms raised from seed, here the worst of all kinds but somewhat in demand for the manufacture of spirits and History of thedate t rade in '.Arabis- tan. 1892-93. vinegar 1894. 1895. 1896- 1897. 1898. 3899. 1900. 1901. l^. 1903. 1904. We, may now briefly take account of the date trade and its fluc tuations at Muhammareh since 1892. In 1893 the crop was better than in 1892 ; at the beginning of the season the local price was bs. per 160 lbs., but the Bombay market was overstocked and it fell to 3^. 6d. The date harvest in 1894 was similar in quantity and quality to that of 1893 ; but in the Bombay market there was little demand, and the price fell to 2^. per ICO lbs. The crop of 1895 was below the average, the palms having been exhausted by the yield of the preceding years ; the price was U. U. per 160 lbs. In 1896 the crop was again small, tkis time in consequence of floods in spring, and prices rose to 5^. 10^. and even to Is. 10^. per 160 lbs. The crop of the following year was also deficient, and prices stood at about Rs. 4-3-0 per cwt. A cold spring diminished the crop in bulk ; but a strong demand, beginning in April, raised prices at first to Rs. 1\ and Es. 9^ per cwt. according to quality; after packing for the European market was com pleted, rates declined agai\ to Rs. 5 and Rs. 6-9-0 per cwt. The crop in 1899 was unusually large and prices were correspond ingly low, ranging from 7 to 12 Qrans per 164 lbs. In this year, in addition to the £4,338 worth of dates shown in Annexure No. 1, about 6,000 tons weight of dates left Muhammareh in non-Indian sailing vessels, but chiefly for India. The yield of dates in 1900 was smaller than in 1899, but still above the average; the summer was an unusually dry one and the fruit was deficient in syrup. The price was about 5^.8^. for IJ cwts. In this year a greater than ordinary proportion of the dates exported in Arab sailing vessels was destined for Red Sea ports. In 1901 the Muhammareh date crop promised well, but a portion of it was spoilt by hot winds and dust. Until the time when packing for the European market was completed the ruling price was 3s, per H cwts ; but afterwards, owing to the arrival of coasting craft in great numbers to purchase, it rose gradually to 65. 3d. The crop in 1902 was about the same as in the preceding year; and again some damage was done by persistent dry winds and dus Prices ranged from 4^. to 6&lt;?. 4^. per Ij'cwts. The crop of 1903 was good on the whole, but it suffered to some extent by excessive damp in July. In 1904 the yield was below the average owing to dust storms* the average price was 4^. per IJ cwts., at which figure the European and American demand was small but the Indian market continued open.145 S' \ 2305 In 1905 the crop was large but inferior in quality to the last; 1905. prices, on the average, were the same as in the preceding year. iU An estimate of the values of the dates shipped from Muhammareh from 1899 -1900 to 1905-06 inclusive will be found in the Annexure to this Appendix. Persian Coast. In the districts adjoining Bushehr Town, particularly on the Bushehr Date produc- Peninsula and in Dashtistan and Dashti, dates do not as a rule ripen ticm and the well; there are about 50 varieties, among which the Halawi and date trade in Khadhrawi—as at Basrah—are considered the best, but the only ^ o ® ^ ersian kind exported is that known as the Qasb Zahidi which is districts, packed in baskets and exported to India to the amount of 10,000 or 15^000 baskets a year. Owing to oppression by the Khans of districts, many of the date cultivators in the Bushehr neighbourhood have lately emigrated to Fao, Qasbeh on ' Abbadan Island, Bahrain, etc. In the Shibkuh and Lingeh districts there are about 40 different sorts of dates, the best being the Qantar, Barhi Khalas, w ere correspl Khadhrawi, Shahuni Khanaizi, Khassab Murdasang nthis jear,! and Halao ; the 'palms of the Lingeh district are about 180,000 reNo. 1, aw trees. All the kinds of dates in these districts, with the exception of those •Indian saili just specified and of two other kinds known as M asli and Zamardi occur in small quantities and are consumed fresh; but the , but still ak ^ as li and Zamardi, which are very abundant, are exported. Of these id ie fruit J ^ dark in colour^ and, though smaller than the Zamardi, cwts, Inii more expensive ; the Zamardi is yellowish and does not keep so well, ported in M ^ or dinary local price of a basket of Masli dates weighing 8 | Lingeh Mans or about 72 lbs. is Es. 2, and that of a similar basket of Zamardi from Es. 1-8-0 to Es. 1-10-0 ; but these are liable to fluctuation. Some 5,000 to 6,000 baskets of Maslis and Zamardi«, according to rainfall, are available at the port of Lingeh every year. The dates grown at a distance inland are said to be sup erior to those of the seacoast. At Bandar ■'Abbas and in the Shamil and Minab districts the best are the Halili and Murdasang, which are also among the fliost abundant. The Zfarig , a fairly good date, is common to all three places, and the Suhrdang also of moderate quality, to the first two. The Khanaizi (from Bahrain) and the Zahrai both a tes of a good class, are found at Bandar ''Abbas and also in Minab. he numbers of different varieties of dates found at Bandar ■'Abbas and in Shamil and Minab are estimated at 16,18 and 16 respectively, those already mentioned above; a proportion, especially in ' inab, belong to stocks imported from abroad, especially from ^Oman, ™n and Basrah. to sot2306 145 Trade with India in Persian Gulf dates. Importation The wet dates carried by the North-Western Railway from Karachi of dates into Lahore, Amritsar, Umballa and Peshawar in 190*2 and 1903 amounted to 1,035 and 892 bags respectively, and probably the whole of these dates were imported from the Persian Gulf. The traffic was almost confined, on the railway, to the months of November, December and January. Both consignors and consignees were in almost all cases Hindus.JLJSrJSrEXTIRJE.

Fish on the Persian coast of the Gulf of 'Oman. Fish taken for local consumption. Fish taken chiefly for export. The fish of the Persian Makran coast are of numerous kinds; they may be roughly divided into two classes,—those which are taken for local consumption and those which are caught for export. To the first class belong the Nambau ^ and Chancho , two unpalatable species of rock-fish; the Murbah ^ or mullet; the or sardine; and the Khundrau or lady-fish; the Tarli Dotur yy , Gidir ^ Ming ; ]V1 usi English: most Kichan , Eaus and Sum , which have no names in of these are procurable throughout the year. To the second class, of which about nine-tenths of the quantity caught, is cured and eventually exported, belong the Gullu or cat-^sh, from which isinglass is obtained; the Kair, which is in season from April to June and also yields isinglass; the Matuta Oyu ^ a kind of whitebait taken between October and February and used by Arabs as manure for then date palms; the Mushku y a kind of rock-fish; the ; Owurt 6 Pagas or shark, caught throughout the year ; the pomfret, here is scarce, but may be caught at intervals throughout the yearj t e Saram pjU ; and the Surma-i or seer-fish, which is ^ season between November and March. of Most of these are probably included, under other names, ''Oman fish above. m the table2319 ABPENBIX F SAILING CRAFT OF THE PERSIAN GULF,* by C ommander A. R owand^ There are about fourteen types o£ native craft which belong to the Persian Gulf proper. These only differ materially in point of size^ rig ; shape of stern ; and length of(keel in proportion to total length ; other slight differences are maintained in connection with the formation of stem and stern-post heads, and in the decorative art displayed in the carving on them. In some cases there is no apparent difference to the casual observer, and the whole show a similarity in general features, whilst the same principle of construction applies to nearly all. As a general rule these vessels are remarkable for the beauty of their lines, and it is probable that many of our modern yachts can hardly show more graceful curvature, though of course greatly excelling in finish. They sail well and are weatherly craft. The following is a general description of the construction of the larger, or sea-going vessels, which practically applies to all. The hull are constructed of roughly adzed planks of teak and jungle-wood, which are nail-and trenail-fastened to the ribs in a very rude and somewhat unsafe manner, notwithstanding which many of them achieve extraordi nary longevity. They are usually decked, with suitable hatchways, etc., and are often fitted with high poops, many being prepared by internal equipment for defence. Those of the Arab Coast usually carry one or two guns, now used for saluting only : war vessels are not now found in the Gulf. Some are sheathed on I' plank bottoms with V 7 board, and a preparation of cocoanut oil and damar (or country resin) is put in be tween, which causes the vessel to be very dry and durable, and prevents the teredo worm from attacking the bottom. The outside of the sheath ing board is coated with a mixture of grease and whitewash, boiled together, to prevent fouling ; this latter coat is renewed about twice a year. The topsides, outside, are coated with two applications of sharks oil every year; and the whole of the interior is given one coat during a similar period : this prevents the timbers from splitting and warping. As a rule they have considerable beam in proportion to their length, and possees great sheer, with a sharp-rising floor. Many are fitted with ports in stern and poop ; some have square and others pointed sterns. The seams of the planking are caulked with raw cotton. They are fitted with two masts raking forward, and inclined at an angle of abou t 15° to the * This Appendix (exceot the Notes and Annexures Nos. 2 and 3} was very kindly written for the present Gazetteer by Commander A. Eowand, R.a.M., who made a special study of the subject. Annexnre No. 2 was compiled from information afforded, through Captain S. G. Knox, Political Agent, by Ha]! Hamud-bm-Badar of Bahrain, the principal boat builder at Kuwait, in 1905. The particulars contained in Annexur© Eo. 3 were supplied by Mr. Im'am-al-Haqq of the Bahrain Political Agency. The spelling of native names in this Appendix has been adapted by the editor to the system used throughout the Gazetteer.2320 perpendicular for the purpose of keeping the ponderous weight of yard and sail clear in raising- and lowering^, and when working to wind ward ; some, however, have been observed to be nearly perpendicular. These masts are roughly trimmed single trees, obtained usually from the Malabar Coast, sufficiently straight, naturally, for the purpose ; at the upper end a sheave-hole is fitted, through which the pendant of the yard halyards is rove. The yard of the forward mast is usually about the same length as the vessel and has been known to be over 100 feet in length ; it is frequently formed of several spars secured together, slightly tapering towards the lower or forward end, but considerably so at the peak or upper end. It is slung at about one-third of its length, and is served round with coir matting where it takes the mast. The after yard is similar, but considerably smaller, and is usually composed of one spar. The sails are lateen shaped, with a very high peak, and are in most cases excellently cut, and consequently set very flat when the sheets are hauled aft. The natives make their sails in the following manner. A suitably flat piece of ground is chosen ; four pegs are driven in the ground at measured points, forming the outline of the sail to be made; the boltrope is stretched and spliced round these pegs ; and the sail cloth is cut to suit; and sewn together and to the boltrope, which is of coir rope. The natives appear to exercise great care in the cutting of their sails. They do not, however, utilize the excellent plan adopted by the native of India of running small coir lines through the seams, which are secured tautly to the head and foot boltropes. The sail cloth is made of cotton of various thicknesses and texture, suitable for the different sized craft. The natives weave the canvas by hand ; it is made about 18' wide, and is sold by weight. It is made at Lingeh, Khamir, Qishm, Dishkun, Kung, Halileh, and Bahrain, also, possibly, at Kuwait and other places. The tack of the principal or forward lateen sail is brought to the stem-head generally through a fixed block there, but sometimes merely secured ; the sheets lead aft in the usual manner. The halyards lead amidship, near the forepart of the poopj and consist of a pendant and treble block purchase which becomes the backstay when the yard is hoisted and the sail set; a bousing-to rope is also rove round yard and mast and hove taut when the yard is up. Generally speaking two or three pairs of shrouds complete the rigging, which is of coir rope throughout and very simple. The after sail is similarly fitted, but with suitably sized gear. In the event of heavy weather this after sad is furled ;and, the foremast being fitted with a large, medium, and lateen sail, these are in turn used as the weather increases, the yard being lowered and the smaller sail bent oa. When the severity of the weather necessitates a smaller show of canvas, a small kind of staysail is hoisted alone. When working to windward these vessels both tack and weaij but generally prefer the latter in a breeze. The vessels are constructed on blocks laid near the beach conveniently close to deep water. They are launched by first placing them on their bilges, with suitable blocks under; laying down well greased ways; anu heaving them out, sideways to the water, by means of tackles secuie o anchors conveniently placed in the water. 'J he natives have ceased budding for some years the larger class of carsro-carrvinff craft formerly seen m the Gulf. The reliable and quick despatch 'afforded by ^2321 , reagec | gteamer communication possibly accounts for this. They seldom lUC tf trade to the Red Sea or Zanzibar, their voyages being- generally ^ £ ne( j to Karachi, and sometimes Bombay and Jiddah. Kuwait 0011 us to be the principal place where native craft are built, and Bums to be the type most frequently built there; but nearly all types of Jgare constructed. At Bushehr, the Jali is the boat most frequently 5 carrying from 10 to 50 tons. At Bahrain the Shu'ai is the most commonly built. On the Arab Coast the Baqarah, Shu'ai and Shashah a re built^ whilst at Lingeh the Baghlah and Jali are most often built. The Tranki was a type of vessel formerly much used in the Gulf, and was impelled both by oars and sails; it is not now seen in the Gulf. The true Arab dhow has also disappeared ; it was similar in appearance to the ^ from which it was distinguished by having a long gallery pro- from the stern, this being its peculiar characteristic. They were sometimes brig-rigged, when formerly used for war purposes by the Qawasim and other piratical tribes. Formerly many wooden ships, barques and brigs were owned in the Gulf by natives, principally at Masqat and Lingeh, to which places some few still belong; they were originally bought from European shipping firms, having been condemned as unfit for their particular service ; and they were commanded and manned by Arabs. The largest native craft carry the following native officers, the smaller ones carry such of these officials as are suitable to their size 1 Nakhuda or Captain. 1 Mii'allim (V or Principal officer. 1 Karvani or Clerk. 1 Sarhang or Boatswain. 3 Sukkanis or Helmsmen, who make and mend sails and tally cargo. 1 or 2 Tabbakhs su or Cooks. 1 Batili or Boatkeeper, in large vessels towiog a Masbnwah. Seamen are called Bahriyah (^U ) on the Persian Coast; 'Arab.

A large native vessel able to carrv from 80 to S00 tons of caigo one 'Baghlah the Jabiri' of Lingeh, which was lost about 20 years ago, is »(1 to have had a carrying capacity of over 500 tons, had two regular App.Z 1462322 decks, a crew of 100 men, and carried 3 jolly-boats and one Mashuwali— has a long overhanging straight stem, with a small ornament at the stem- head. The keel rnns straight between the stem and stern-posts; and the stern is square with overhanging counter, fitted on each quarter with pro jections similar to quarter-galleries. The stern-post slopes somewhat to the keel, the rudder being secured to the sternpost; the rudder -head runs through a trunkway on the stern, and is controlled by a wheel on the poop. The Baghlah is decked fore and aft, fitted with a poop usually cut witli ports ; a boat is usually carried across the stern and hoisted to davits projecting over the stern. It usually has three hatchways. The larger Baghlahs have regularly fitted compasses, some of which are very old ; most having been taken from wrecked or captured merchant vessels. A cross-piece is fitted on the stem-head, over which the anchor cables usually run when being hove in ; it serves also to secure the cable to. In some cases the cable is hove in through a block fixed on the stem-head.^ The Baghlah has two masts of the usual type, and the sails and rigging common to all in the Gulf and before described. It is a cargo-carrying craft and carries a crew varying from 20 to 50 men, now-a-days. II.—-Ghunohah. ( ^ ). Belongs to the same ports as the Baghlah. It is merely a small Baghlah, to which it is in all respects similar, excepting that it geneia y has only two hatchways. It carries a crew of from 15 to 20 men, an from 20 to 80 tons of cargo. It is used for cargo. III.—Batil ( ). Belongs to the same ports as the Baghlah, and is a vessel with a lon^ overhanging, fiddle-headed bow. The stem slopes rapidly to which is in length roughly about one-third the total length of t e v the after part slopes gradually upwards from the keel and ends in thin stern-board, the head of which towers over the poop and is c ^ with a peculiar device. The stern is pointed, sometimes , poop; only the larger ones are completely decked, otherwise t ^ ^ is similar to the general type first described. It is of various s * zeS isma || er steered by means of a balanced rudder, actuated by a wheel; tne ^ ^ ones are propelled both by oars and sails. The larger ones only 11 when pearling. , The Batil of the Arab Coast has two masts, that of the ^ rs ^ a ^ &lt; [ is only one; the usual native sails and rigging are fitted. The ^ used for trading but often engages in pearling, and carries a c ^ ^ from 10 to 20 men; when pearling the crew are increased to a men, It carries from 15 to 60 tons of cargo.2323 146 a IV.-Baqarah (^). Belongs to all Arab Coast ports from Masqat to Abu Dhabi, Bahrain and Kuwait ; on the Persiai, Coast to Ling -eh, Qishm, Bandar ''Abbas and Tangistan ; none have belonged to Bushehr for eight or nine yeais. The Baqarah is similar in all respects to the Batil excepting that the ornamentation of the stem and stern-head differ. On the Arab Coast this craft has two masts, with the usual sails and rigging; but on the Persian Coast it sometimes only has one mast. Baqarahs vary in length from 30 to 60 feet and are employed for cargo-carrying on the Arab Coast; they are also used for pearling. They carry ordinarily a crew of from 10 to 15 men, but when pearling the complement is increased up to 30 men. The Baqarah is impelled by oars as well as sails ; and carries a cargo of from 10 to 30 tons. V.—Sambuk ( ). This type of craft belongs to the same parts of the Gulf as the Baqarah, excepting Tangistan. The Sambuk is similar in all respects to the G-hunchah or small Baghlah excepting in one particular, the stem- head being plain and not decorated with a small block of wood as in the case of the Baghlah and Ghunchah. The Sambuk carries a crew of from 15 to ^0 men. It is usually employed in carrying cargo, and contains from 15 to 60 tons according to size. Bum ( p*). Belongs to the Arab Coast ports from Ras -al-Khaimah to Abu Dhabi, —irain and Kuwait, and, on the Persian side, Bushehr, ^ The Bum is of various sizes, of which the largest is somewhat bigger than the GWnchah; they are from 40 to 80 feet long. The stern is pointed with a rail round; the bow is long and overhanging, rounded ^ off (but some times carved) at the stem-head; and the vessel is steered with an ordinal y ^dder and wheel, excepting on the Pirate Coast where a tiller is o en ?sed. The Bum is usually completely decked, with suitable hatchways; ft sometimes has a slightly raised poop. Bums carry crews varying 10m ^to40 men, and are used chiefly for cargo; but the small are used also ^pearling; they carry from 20 to 200 tons of cargo and, as a type, % appear to be the most numerous in the Gulf.2324 VII.—Dangi ( ^ ). Belongs only to Kuwait, and it is believed that only one is at present known there; it was built at Kuwait and is similar in all respects to the Bum ; excepting 1 at the stem-head which has peculiar device, belonging to the Kutiyah, rather like a bird^s head with the beak pointing aft; this peculiar ornament belongs strictly to the Kutiyah ; a type of Indian craft found at Karachi and in the Gulf of Cutch. In respect of size, complement, nature of employment, etc., the Dangi is similar to the Bum. The name is probably a native adaptation of the English ' dinghy' c VIIL—Kutiyah (^). An Indian native type of vessel recently adopted in parts of the Gulf; it really belongs to Karachi, Gulf of Cutch, etc. The Kutiyah is found in Bushehr, Kharag Island, Bahrain, Kuwait, one or two at each place. The Kutiyah is in all respects similar to the Ghunchah or small Baghlah, excepting that it has a peculiar birdlike device on the stem head instead of the square block of wood ; this is its particular cnarac er istic and has been borrowed by the Dangi. In every other y es P e ^ regarding complement, size, rig, employment and tonnage it is simi ar the Ghunchah. It is sometimes built at Kuwait, Bahrain and Bus en. IX.—Shu'ai ( ). Belongs to the Pirate Coast, Bahrain and Kuwait. The Shu^ai is a small Sambuk propelled by oars and sails, us^ principally by fishermen; it is generally from 15 to 20 feet long; a crew of from 6 to 10 men. The larger Shu^ai is used for pear ing the Pirate Coast. Nearly all are decked j they have one mast wi usual sails and fittings. X.—Zaruqah ( ). Belongs to Arab Coast ports from Masqat to Abu Dhabi, ft ^ small Baqarah used for fishing and pearling close to the coast. n\2325 one mast, and is impelled by oars and sails; is usually from 15 to 20 feet in length; and carries a crew of from 7 to 8 men. XL—Mashuwah (). Belongs to the Arab Coast ports from Ras-al-Khaimah to Kuwait and Persian Coast from Bushehr to Jashk. In length the Mashuwah varies from 20 to 40 feet; it is broad- beamed and square-sterned, with plenty of sheer, sometimes completely decked, the smaller ones being usually half-decked. The larger ones have two hatchways for cargo. They are steered with a rudder and wheel, but tlie small ones use a tiller only. As a rule they have only one mast, but on the Arab Coast the larger ones sometimes have two. They have the usual sails and rigging, are fitted with a bowsprit, and have, in addition to the ordinary sails, a kind of combined jib-staysail. The larger Mashuwah is used for cargo (8 to 10 tons), the smaller ones for figliing; they carry a crew of from 6 to 12 men, and are a very common tjpe in rjie Gulf. XIL—-Badan ( ^). Belongs to the Arab Coast ports from Masqat to Kuwait. The Badan is a much smaller vessel than, but is similar to, the Baqarah excepting that where the keel runs in the Baqarah is flat-bottomed in the Badan, which enables the latter vessel to stand upright when beached or aground. The Badan has only one mast and is rigged as usual; some have bowsprits, and all have the jib-staysail j the larger ones are decked, the smaller ones half-decked or open • they range from 10 to 20 feet in length and have crews of from 4 to 8 men. They are propelled by oars or sails; the larger ones are used for cargo, and the smaller ones for fishing. XIIL—Jali or Jalibot ( ). Belongs to all ports on the Arab and Persian Coasts ; the name is probably borrowed from the man-of-war Jolly-boat. n The J ali i s a email square-sterned passenger-carrying- craft, from 20 to 30 feet long, shaped rather like the Mashuwah excepting m the steiri; usually open, but those belonging to Kuwait and Bahrain are2326 sometimes half-deoked; has one mast with usual sails and fittings, also bowsprit and jib-staysail; it is propelled both by oars and sails, is steered with a rudder and tiller ; and carries a crew of from 4 to 6 men. Belongs to the Arab Coast ports from Ras-al-Khaimah to Abu Dhabi and on the Persian Coast is found at Qishm and Bandar ^Abbas. Generally about 10 feet long, peculiarly constructed of date-stalks alone connected together in a solid body ; no attempt being made to make the craft water-tight^ the flotative properties of the date-stalks being utilized. In form it follows out the lines of an ordinary boat and is pointed at the stern as well as the bow. It is strengthened by date-stalks laid athwartships between the layers of longitudinal stalks; the whole being sewn together with a kind of raw cotton twine. Thej are impelled by two oars; sometimes a primitive sail is used, hoisted to two small spars lashed together at their heads, with the lower ends separated and resting on the gunwales on either side of the boat amidships, and stayed as necessary. They have no rudder, and are used only for fishing close to the shore ; they carry 1 to 3 men.

The Shuai SafFar is a cargo vessel. The Shu'ai G haw was is nsed for pearling only. The Sambuk is a higher grade vessel than the Shu ai ; it is used for pearl fishing and never carries cargo. The Baghlah is used for trade and runs from the Gulf to Bombay, Aden, etc. There is on essential difference between a Shu'ai and a Baghlah, except that the latter carries a small boat suspended at the stern. Now-a-days Baghlahs are not built of more than 4,000 Qusarahs or 320 tons capacity, but formerly some had a capacity of 6,000. The Baqarah is used for pearl fishing ; it never carries cargo. The Batil is the fastest and, according to Arab ideas, the most elegant of all craft. It was formerly used for war, but is now confined to pearl fishing; it never carries cargo. Large Mashuwahs are used for pearling and have as many as 7 pairs of oars, small ones are carried bj other vessels of greater size as shore-going boats. The Bum is a type of cargo boat which runs all over the Gulf and to India. It is also nsed as a lighter in port; and by pearl merchants visiting the banks, but not for actual pearling. S-O.

We shall devote a section to each of the animals mentioned. Camels, t Camels are abundant in all the countries on the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf, where nearly all the Bedouin tribes possess them in con siderable numbers and consider them among their most valuable property : on the Persian coast also, especially where the country is open, camels exist and are to some extent utilised. * Some detailed information regarding transport animals and livestock will be foandin the principal geographical articles in Volame TI of this Gazetteer, of which an enumeration follows, and. also in a number of minor articles. The passages in the principal articles are ''Oman Sultanate pages 1388-9; 'Trucial 'Oman', pages 1438-9 ; 'Qatar', pages 1532-3; 'Bahrain Principality,' pages 242-3; ' Hasa Sanjaq,' pages 665-6, supplemented by ' Hasa Oasis,' page 656, and ' Qatif Oasis,' pages 1543-4; Kuwait Principality,' page 1074; ' Turkish 'Iraq,' pages 798-9, 804-5 and 826-7 ; ''Arabistan/' page 129 ; article on the district of ' Liravi ' and separate articles on the districts of the ' Persian Coast ' from ' Hayat Davud ' to 'Jashk District/' inclusive; 'Persian Makran,' pages 1138 and 1141 ; and 'Gwadar District,' page 588. To these may be added the article on the tribe 'Mutair,' page 1289. In regard to the export trade in animals of all kinds the annual Administration and Commercial Reports of the Persian Gulf Political Resi dency, Mr. H. W. Maclean's Beport on the Conditions and Prospects of British Trade in Persia, 1903, page 15, and Mr. A. H. Gleadowe-Newcomen's Beport on the Commercial Mission to South'Eastern Persia during 1904-05, printed in 1906, pages 82-3, are the principal authorities. The livestock of 'Iraq are described i^n Cninet's La Turquie d' Jsie, Volume III, pages 44-55. Captain C. M. Gibbonn's Note on the Transport of Southern and Eastern Persia (Division of the Chief of the Staff, Simla, 1908) contains much information on the subject indicated by its title, Some additional reports on particular kinds of animals are cited in footnotes to tbe titles of paragraphs below. t The writings of Mr. Doughty and Colonel Miles contain some information in le gard to camels, and Baron Nolde has devoted a chapter to the subject {Beise nach hnerarabien, 1895, pages 123-32).

Distribution and character istics of camels in Turkish 'Iraq. Distribution and character istics of camels in Persia and M akran. Prices. Exportation of camels. In the ^ Oman Sultanate the chief camel districts are sharqiyab and Batinah ; the Daluls or riding camels of 'Oman are the best in Arabia^ and are much prized in the other parts of the peninsula. In Trucial 'Oman many camels are owned by the Bedouin tribes, and in Qatar they are bred by the settled as well as by the nomad population; but in the Bahrain Islands there is little use for camels and only a few are owned. In the Hasa Sanjaq camels are plentiful, and the Daluls are inferior to those of 'Oman only ; the Kuwait Principality also is well stocked with camels. In all the three divisions of Central Arabia the camel is of supreme importance and is used not only for transport pur poses but also, by the settled population, to raise water from wells; the milk, as everywhere in Arabia, is drunk by Bedouins. The camels 01 Southern Najd are smaller and darker in colour than^ those of Jabal Shammar in the north and they are considered to be of a higher class; they are, however, worse tempered and less tractable. Camels are obtainable, in fair quantities, throughout the whole of Turkish 'Iraq ;a proportion are very light in colour. Those of the nan Lam tribe are reputed particularly good. In the drier districts of 'Arabistan there is no scarcity of camels; but in this province they are only used for transport and are not ridden. Camels are found, though not abundantly, along- the coast, and follows;— the numbers in — whole Persian ^a 'few' of'the' districts 'have been returned as 100 Lingeh 500 250 Shatml 700 850 Biyaban 300 1,250 Gwadar 200 Liravi Hay at Davud Tangistan Dashti For the majority of the districts no precise statistics are a ^ al ^ , The camels of Persian M akran are small, carry a load of about * and march 2^ miles an hour ; here females are not genera ly unless they are barren. Prices vary within very 'wide limits according to locality and class of animal. In Hasa a good riding camel costs £18 or more ^ Mutair prices .of good Daluls range from £6 for a female to £ , male, while the best Ba'irs jW or male baggage camels can^ e , for £6 and the best females for £5 each; and m Persia an ordinary camel may be bought for £3-10-0 to £7-0-0. Camels do not appear to be exported from the Persian land from Kuwait, from Turkish 'Iraq, and probably from iNa]d, t ^ Droves of 300 to 600 camels are occasionally marched to oyi ^ Kuwait, and there is a more regular export in the same Turkish 'Iraq, where the chief collecting centres are Samawah, i ^ and Najaf ; the ultimate destination of most of these, which via Musal to Aleppo, is believed to be Egypt. A few good ruiin, ^ o -o from 'Oman as rarities to other places, and in this way a icwb ^ sent by the Sultan as a gift to the Sharif of Makkah. The P ersia j n cage appears not unworthy of consideration as a source of camel supply of extensive military operations by the army in India.Horses are scarce in W j few are kept on 2335 Horses.* the ''Oman Sultanate; and in Trucial 'Oman :ew ar« account of diffioulty in feeding them. In a few of the settled population and the Bedouins generally both ^iTand breed horses. In the Bahrain Islands there are only a few Jes about 50 in number, owned by the ruling family; they are of y vji' |3 reec l but have deteriorated in consequence of the climate and the miiditions in which they are kept. In the Hasa Sanjaq the horses mffnpd by the settled population are few, there being only about 100 in the Oasis of Hasa and 50 in that of Qatif ; but the Bedouins of the curroundino- deserts are well provided with horses, and _ from them serviceable animals of some breeding may be obtained at prices ranging from £18 to £36. In the Kuwait Principality horses are possessed, as the? are elsewhere, by the Bedouins. Najd or Central Arabia is the nrincipal horse-breeding country in the Persian Gulf and the only one in the world, except the adjacent Syrian desert, where the genuine Arab is produced on any considerable scale. Here horses are most numerous in northern Central Arabia or Jabal Shammar, nearly all persons ot consideration in that district possessing a larger or a smaller number; but the export trade depends largely on the more central district ^ ot Qasim, where the towns of 'Anaizah and Buraidah are the principal markets. 'Anaizah, supplied principally by the Qahtan furnishes as a rule animals of higher caste, while at Buraidah, provided chiefly by the Mutair, the number of animals is usually larger. The horses of 'Iraq have a high reputation and the supply of them is considerable, but they are not equal to those of Na^d; some realy good horses are bred, however, in the neighbourhood of Hillah and Diwanivah, and the horses of the Bani Lam tribe, to the east of the Tigris/are reputed excellent. A certain number of passable ndmg horses are available at Baghdad. Horses, in some cases of fairly good quality, exist m considerable numbers in'Arabistan; nearly all are mares, as colts are intentionally destroyed. In the districts of the Persian Coast horses are found, but not in the same excellence or abundance as in Arabia; statistics aie not available except for the following districts Liravi Hayat Davud Eud-hilleh Angali Shabankareh 200 350 250 100 50 Zira Dashtifltan Tangistan Dashti Bandar 'AbbSs 90 200 150 250 10 Horsea in Turkish 'Iraq.

In 1891 the Bombay market for Arabs was overstocked; but in the 1891-92. following year, the number sent being smaller while the demand in India remained constant, good prices were obtained, and the season was a profitable one to dealers. In 1893 the number of horses exported to India was considerably 1893-94 larger than in 1892, but prices continued to be good; and in 1894, though a slight decrease in the volume of the trade occurred, it was due to short supply^ and not to a bad market, and the dealers still had reason to be satisfied with the results of their operations. In 1895 a strong demand in India was anticipated, and the 1895. exportation from ''Iraq was unprecedentedly heavy; the shipments also were made earlier in the season than usual. The number of horses exported to Bombay was below the average. 1896 - This was due to dearness of fodder in India and to the appearance of bubonic plague at Bombay, in consequence of which the usual late- son shipments did not take place. In 1897 there was further falling-off in the trade, due to the continu- 1897. of plague and scarcity of fodder in India, and to the purchase of 3 for military purposes by the Turkish Government. The season of 1899 was expected to be unusually profitable in India; 1899. but an export duty of 5 Lirahs or £4*10-0 sterling per horse was imposed by the Turkish Government, which checked the operations. Considerable numbers of animals were however smuggled from 'Iraq into Persia and shipped from Muhammareh, where the Shaikh was content to realise an export duty of 5 per cent, ad valorem. In 1900 direct trade from ''Iraq practically ceased in consequence of 1900. the export duty; but horses continued to leave the country as usual, being shipped, as in the previous year, at Muhammareh instead of The prohibitive export duty of 5 Lirahs per head having been 1902. oved, the trade began to resume its normal course, and 945 horses ^ an average value of £6 were shipped fr:)m Basrah in 190^. Good prices obtained at Bombay in 1902 encouraged exportation, 1903 W 3,845 horses left Basrah for Bombay in 1903 ; but the market was ^favourable, and dealers suffered heavy loss. Many of the animals ' were inferior and remained unsold at Bombay until the followin g In 1904 the animals sent from ''Iraq to Bombay were of better 1901 - aver age quality than in the preceding year; but the Indian market was ^rstocked, and some small dealers, it was stated, were unable to dispose ^ their horses there or to pay their way back to their native country'.

An epidemic of glanders also occurred at Bombay, and a number of animals died or were destroyed there. In 1905, in consequence of the misfortunes of the previous year, shipments were not large ; but the horses sent found a good market at Bombay, in consequence, it is believed, of the visit of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales to India. In 1906 there was again a considerable decrease in the horses exported; it was attributed to the competition of Australian horses in the Indian market.

In 1892 the horses exported from Muhammareh were of more than 1892. average quality. In 1894 there was a slight decrease, in comparison with former years, jn the number of horses leaving Muhammareh for India ; the prices obtained at Bombay were not good, nor was the season profitable. In 1895, when the export of horses from Basrah was large, the demand for Persians at Bombay declined, and the number shipped at Mubammareh again decreased. Unfavourable conditions prevailed in India in 1896, and the number sent from Muhammareh fell still lower. 1894 1895. 1896. In 1897, chiefly in consequence of plague at Bombay, the market was extremely dull, and again very few horses left Muhammareh. In 1898 plague and famine in India still affected the Bombay market, and the exportation from Muhammareh continued slight. 1897. 1898. 1899-01. In 1899 there was a very large increase in the number of horses dipped at Muhammareh ; it was due to an export duty in ''Iraq, men- above, which caused many ^Iraqis to be smuggled into Persia for In 1900 and 1901 the whole horse trade of Basrah was diverted to this port. In 1902 the trade at Muhammareh declined again, in consequence of a902-03. tke removal of the export duty in ■'Iraq ; and after this it apparently continued on a purely local scale.

In Southern Persia mules are abundant, and serviceable finals can be purchased in considerable numbers at convenient centres on the main trade routes, such as Shiraz, Isfahan and Shushtar. In ^rabistan, however, mules are confined to the drier parts of the province; and in the Persian districts upon the coast of the Gulf they are not apparently numerous, the only definite estimates for littoral districts being Hayat Davud 150 Dashtistan * « 3oO gud-liilleh . 200 Tangistan 60 gtabankareh 100 and Zira . 30 Dashti 250 Tlie reports cited in the footnote to the title of this Appendix make any furtlier observations in regard to the Persian mule superfluous in this place. Mules are not ordinarily, it would appear, exported from Persia by sea; but a number, as will be seen from the next paragraph, have been at times specially procured from that country, by the agency of British officers^ for the use of the Indian Army. The Annual Administrative Reports of the Persian Gulf Residency only show that from Bushehr 22 mules worth £211 were exported in 1897, 2 worth £20 in 1899, and 161 worth £1,396 in 1901; and that at Muhammareh there were shipped 235 mules worth £1,827 in 1900 and IM worth £1,080 in 1901. In October 1879 Major Probyn arrived from India in the Persian Gulf to purchase mules for the use of the Indian Army in Afghanistan and remained until May 1880 ; he visited Shiraz, Baghdad and Shushtar and was successful, with the co-operation of Mr. Preece at Shiraz and Dr. Brereton at Baghdad, in obtaining 1,715 mules, of which a proportion were battery mules. Between September and November 1880, under orders from the Government of India, 174 battery mules were purchased bj the Persian Gulf Political Residency through Mr. Preece, and in December 57 more through a Persian banker; these appear to have been all collected at Shiraz. On their tour in Persia in 1886, already mentioned above under the section on horses. Colonel Williams and Mr. Rayment obtained 212 mules; between January and June 1889 Captain H. R. Tate, who landed at Bushehr and visited ShTraz and Isfahan as a purchasing officer, collected 318 mules; and in 1890 Lieute- ^nt W. J.

The two latest deputations of officers from India to Persia for the purchase of mules have been those of Major G. H. Arbntlmot and Tjieutenant V. P. B. Williams; the former of these made Isfahan his principal centre and between April and October 1904 collected 953 mules; while the latter, who devoted his attention chiefly to the districts adjoining Kirmanshah and to Pusht-i-Kuh, obtained 85 ordnance and 156 transport mules during the period from June to October 1907.* The exportation of the animals purchased by these representatives of the Army 'Remount Department is not traceable in the annual statistics for the ports of Bushehr and Muhammareh; it may perhaps have been intentionally omitted as an official transaction. The result of these deputations has been to show that there are difficulties in the way of the establishment of an ordinary trade in mules from Per si? to India^ the demand at Bombay and Karachi being at present chiefly military, an that, in order to obtain mules from Persia, it may probably continue to be necessary to send purchasing officers from India.

The cattle of Persian Mafaan, like the other animals^ are small. Buffaloes. Buffaloes, in the region of the Persian Gulf, are hardly found outside the marshy districts of Turkish ■'Iraq and 'Arabistan; there are a few in Persian Makran, but they are small. The buffaloes of ^Iraq are of excellent quality, and among them those owned by the Al Bu Muham mad tribe have high reputation. Numbers are collected at 'Amarali^ on the northern border of the Al Bu Muhammad country, and are marched by the Tigris line to Musal, and thence to Syria, for disposal In ^Arabistan buffaloes are confined, as already mentioned, to the moister tracts ; the majority are consequently found in the districts of Fallahiyeh and Hawizeh, and in parts of Dizful and Hindiyah districts. In this province buffaloes are used for ploughing as well as for other purposes. Sheep and goats. Sheep and goats in Easterii Arabia, Sheep and goats in Central Arabia. Sheep ir Turkish Iraq. Both sheep and goats are found in considerable quantities in all the countries adjoining the Persian Gulf. The sheep, in ^Oman, occur mostly in the possession of Bedouins or among the inhabitants of hilly tracts, while goats are general; in Qatar the sheep and goats belonging to the settled population are tended by Bedouins, and there is some exportation of both to Bahrain; in Bahrain only about 500 sheep and 700 goats are kept, but there is a large importation by butchers from Persia and Hasa and a small one from Qatar and Kuwait,—so many as 14,000 sheep and goats being brought over from Persia, and 2,000 from Hasa, in the year. On the Arabian side of the Gulf, sheep are most numerous and of the best quality in Najd; they belong to a special breed yielding a fine^woo, and they are distinguished, outside their own country, as ' Nijad Among the Harb tribe the sheep are generally black. Among t e Mutair both the sheep or Dhan and the goat or Ma'az )** sell at $4 to $6 per head, the price of females being higher than that of males. In Turkish ^Iraq also the sheep are fat-tailed and of excellent quality, the mutton being almost equal to that of Europe; those of the Bani Lam tribe are highly reputed. There is some exportation of sheep from Turkish Iraq to Syria ; it takes place viti the Tigris line and Musal(/So 2346 tk animals being first collected in the neighbourhood of ^Amarah. The Arab sheep of the , Iraq plain has a fine curly wool; but a crossbreed between it and the hill sheep of Kurdistan exists, of which the wool is coarser and straighter. In 'Arabistan goats are less numerous than sheep, and in parts of sheep and that province there is only a sprinkling of goats. Persian sheep and goats in goats are fully described in the Annexure to this Appendix, and HO Persia, remarks on them are therefore required in the present place. The sheep and goats of Persian Makran are small, like the other domestic animals of that country. ANNEXURE No. 1.—PERSIAN SHEEP AND GOATS.* Persian sheep. Generally speaking there are only two distinct breeds of sheep in Varieties ot Southern Persia and Arabia, viz,, the 'Arabi ^ and the Turki . Persian or Luri ; but in some localities a thircl, a crossbreed two, may be added. between Persian sheep are very hardy little animals, which can thrive on General _ next to nothing, finding food where other animals would die of character- starvation ; and, despite their slender build, they are well able to stand i8tics - the inclemencies of the weather, particularly the heat and scorching winds which are so prevalent along the low lands of Southern Persia and Arabia. The 'Arabi is of lighter build, and has a more drooping tail; it is better adapted to plains and scorching winds, and its wool is finer and of higher value. The Turki is of heavier build, more suitable to the hills and the migratory habits of its owners; its wool is much coarser; and its fat tail is rounder and better set up. A certain amount of attention is given to the breeding of the sheep. Breeding, more particularly to keeping the different breeds apart, and in the districts most noted for lambskins great care is taken to prevent the introduction of any other colour than black; it is no doubt mainly due to this that black is the prevailing colour, although, where the wool is the chief requirement, whites and greys are sought after. The rams get into toe rutting humour twice a year; but, as a rule, they are only allowed to come into contact with the ewes once a year, and that in the autumn. Ihe skins of lambs born in the autumn are considered, by some people, to be superior to those born in the spring; but, as a rule, the ewes are made to lamb in the spring, when grass and food generally are plentiful. M JJ 6 ^ 0 ^ 0 0 f this Annexure on Persian sheep and goats was kindly supplied 'by h r K ^ c ^ arc * s ' Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consnl at Btlshebr, in 1906. (It as been altered in parts so as to omit matters of temporary interest.)2346 Pasturage Water. Work of the shepherd. Diseases. Wool In spring there is usually a good supply of green grass and otter kinds of food ; and in summer, when the country is parched and dry, the sheep are still able to find wild grass, wheat and barley stubble, wild shoots, and fallen leaves from trees and shrubs, etc. During spring, when sweet grass is plentiful, the sheep, to keep them in health, are taken twice a week to graze on marshy ground or on soils where herbs of saline character exist. This is also done to a certain extent in tbe summer, the flocks being occasionally led over salty ground. For water, in spring and the rainy months, the flocks are generally taken twice a day to the nearest stream or pool; but in summer, when these are diy, they have to be content with brackish water from wells, wherever it can be obtained, and this, as a rule, only twice a day. The tending or looking after flocks of sheep is not now a very arduous task. In olden days, when wolves and wild animals were plentiful^ the duties of a shepherd were by no means light; but, since the introduction of the Martini and other rifles into the country, wolves and other wild animals have practically disappeared, and the shepherd can now allow his flock to roam about at pleasure, while he spends mos o his time sleeping in a shady corner behind a rock, trusting to his dog o wake him should it be necessary, and to his goats to lead the s eep o grazing grounds near by. The Persian sheep may be described as fairly immune from but Gar J or scab exists, which is most prevalent in years of scarcity; the cure for this affection is, along the sea coast, the application o s or shark oil and, inland, of linseed and other oils. There is also ano er disease of rather a formidable character, known amongst the na ives a Abu Tabr ^ ^1 or 'father of the axe, ^ which they take no means to prevent or cure, as they believe that a sheep suffering from it is s r by a devil; it generally appears when grass is plentiful, rhe s all appearances may be in the best of health, when suddenly it wi to coughing, whirl round frantically, and, in most cases, drop down in a few minutes. There is less disease amongst sheep w ic occasionally washed in the sea than amongst those which are not. On an average a sheep will yield H to 3 Ibs.^ of wool. \ a - distinct difference between the wool of the ^Arabi and that or tie or Luri. The ^Arabi wool is the finer in quality, being long-stapi , very elastic, and of a silky texture ; this wool finds a fairly ready m in England and on the Continent of Europe, where it is m0 ^ ^ rr^ki oi the manufacture of the coarser kinds of woollen goods. Ihe ^ i Luri wool is very coarse and locky, the staple being very straig , , shorter than the ^ Arabi; it has little or no elasticity and in tac P a ^ more of the nature of hair.

By far the greater part or^ produced in the districts on the Karun is of the Turki or Lun^va^ ^ The difference in the quality of the wools is attributed by some different pastures and mode of living of the two classes of sheep. Arab sheep, living on the plains, gets better food and has not to be tantly on the move; whereas the Turki is always marching wl Q\2347 ile, | Lambskins. owners and has to pick up what pasturage it can g-et on the roau while its food consists chiefly of oak leaves and lichen^ found on the mountain sides. As regards the wool of the crossbred sheep^ this is inferior to that of the ''Arabi, but superior to that of the Turki. It can be used for carpet making and is exported largely to America, where it enters under a low duty scale, while the better class ^Arabi wool has to pay a higher duty. A demand for this quality of wool has thus been created and is no doubt inducing the rearing of crossbreeds. The shearing season commences in March and continues till May. White and grey wools are the least obtained, and black and dark shades are the most plentiful. Persia is famous for its lambskins, which find a large outlet into Russia; these more generally come from the sheep of the highlands. As the essential feature of the lamVs wool is the fineness and compactness of the curl, an indiscriminate slaughter is effected of lambs of ages vary ing from the moment of birth to about a fortnight old. In some places the barbaric system still exists of killing the ewes just a day or so before they should give birth, in order to get the lamb without the damage caused to the curl by parturition; in such cases the skin is worth twice the average price. The destruction of lambs in Persia, until a short time ago, was so great that an appreciable decrease in the number of sheep was felt all over the country, affecting even the carpet-weaving industry. Government legislation has since been introduced to arrest this wholesale slaughter, but it is doubtful whether it has had much effect. Sheepskins in an untanned state are regularly exported to India, Sheepskins, where they are used to make up cheap country leather; and a certain number go to the Continent. The tanned skins generally find their way north, and are considered by some to be of very superior quality; they are largely used in the country itself, but a fair number are exported to One sheep will produce from 1 to lbs. of milk a day ; this is Dairy pro- generally made into cheese or into Mast ,—the latter a kind of curds duce. and whey—, both of which are greatly appreciated by natives and by some Europeans, M ast being a very refreshing drink after a hot and dusty journey. After pigeon manure that of the sheep is the most prized in Persia Manure, by agriculturists, who utilize it especially for the cultivation of melons and other vegetables and of fruits. It is a matter of opinion which kind of sheep is the better for Meat, eating j the 'Arabi, when ready for the butcher, weighs from 20 to 50 lbs., and the Turki or Luri from 30 to 70 lbs. These are largely exported to the Continent, principally to Hamburg, Entrails, where they find a ready market. These also are exported to the Continent, but not in very great Bones, quantities. Generally speaking, the rearing of sheep is a lucrative business. Pr * lces - The average price of a ewe is from 25 to 30 Qrans. The wool and dairy products of a ewe bring in form 10 to 15 Qrans per annum, and a2348 lamb fetches from 8 to 12 Qrans^ against which the expenses of tending are practically nothing-. ExportaHon. Exportation on a large scale would probably lead to the imposition by the Persian Government of an embargo ; the measivtes which they have taken to prevent the destruction of lambs have been mentioned above. The Persian ports from which sheep might be shipped are Bandar ^Abbas^ Lingeh, Bushehr and Muhammareh; the prices of ewes would range from 25 to 30 Qrans and of rams from 25 to 40 Qrans. The duty on the export of live sheep from Persia is one Qran per head. A few sheep were sent from Persia to South Africa in 1905. Persian goats. In passing from the subject of sheep^ it may be as well to say a few words as to their guide, philosopher, and friend,—the goat.

As a rule a number of goats are to be found in each flock of sbeep; they are trained to lead the latter just in the same manner as the horse called Pishahang is trained to lead a caravan of mules. The goats have better homing instincts than the sheep, and not only do they lead flock to the desired pasture land, but, as they are much less prone to taking fright, they also prevent it from shying or stampeding, They also act as safe guides in mountainous districts. Produce. Ropes, rough Gilims or rugs, and saddle bags are made from the hair of which the goats yield from 1 to IJ lbs.; and their milk is treated in the same way as that of the sheep, that is to say, it is made into cheese or Mast. In villages alongside rivers, where no boats , goat skins are blown out and used by the natives, either singly or jome together afW the manner of a raft; by this means goods, ^ passengers; etc., are ferried across rivers and mountain streams over which there are no bridges and in which no boat could live. The skins are also exten sively used to make bags for containing and carrying water.2349 APPENDIX RELIGIONS AND SECTS OF THE PERSIAN GULF REGION.* In the present Appendix we propose to deal with the indigenous religions of the Gulf only, leaving the subject of Western Christianity and Missions to be discussed in another place. Religions and their distribution. In all the countries of the Persian Gulf region, Islam, in one or another of its forms, prevails almost to the exclusion of other religions. The only other faith with numerous adherents is Judaism, which is strongly represented in Turkish ; Iraq, but outside the limits of that province is not professed by more than a few hundred^ per sons. After Jews, in order of numerical importance, come Oriental Christians belonging to various churches, who number several thousands in Turkish 'Iraq but are hardly found in any other part of the Gulf. ' * This Appendix has been compiled cbiefly from information collected for the Geographical Volume of the present Gazetteer by officers whose names appear in the footnotes on authorities in that Volume, from the general records of the Government of Iniiia in the Politioal Department, from the annual Administration Eeports of the Persian Gulf Political Residency, «nd from the sources of information indicated below. The leading authorities used by tjie writer in matters relating to Shi'ahs are a special report on prevailing sects by Agha Muhammad Khalil, 1905 ; a special repoit by Mr. J. C. Gaskin on holy places and pilgrimages, 1905, in regard to which Cuinet's La Turquie £ Asie, Volume III, 1894, and Mebuhr's Voyage en Arable, 1780, may also be consulted ; reports on the Mnjtahids of Na;iaf and Karbala by Major L. S.Newrnarch, Political Resident at Baghdad, contained in the Proceedings of the Government of India for September 1903, and information supphed by Mnjor Ramsay (Major Newmarch's successor) in 1906 ; reports by Captain D. L. R. Lorimev, Vice-Consul in'AraHstan, on the Mujtahids of Shushtar and Dizful; and, with reference to the movements in India of snspicious Shi'ah travellers from the rersian Gulf, the records of the Criminal Intelligence Department, Simla. Regarding Sunnis the chief sources of information are a report on the Kaqib of Baghdad and the Qfidirivah family by Muhammad Hasan, Muhsin, with a covenmr letter by Major Newmarch, contained in the Proceedings of the Government of India tor February 1904, and, for the relations of the same family with India and Aighanistan, various paoers among the records of the Criminal Intelligence De} artn:ent, Smja? and a report by Mr. P.

Hindus are not many and scarcely occur except on the coasts of the Gulf of 'Oman and of the lower Persian Gulf. Matters relating to the Muhammadan religion generally. Muhamma- dan deno minations in the Persian Gulf. Distribution and propor tionate numerical strength of Muhaw ma- dan deno minations. The Muhammadans of the Persian Gulf region belong to the follow ing denominations : Sunni, Shi'ah. Ibadhi, Wahhabi, Khojah and Zikri; among these the Wahhabis should perhaps^ in strictness^ be regarded as a branch of the Sunnis^ and the Khojahs as a branch of the Shi'ahs. To the position and interests of each of these denominations a separate notice will be devoted ; but it will be convenient first of all to dispose of matters that are common to all. The provinces of Turkish ^Iraq (population, 1,500,000) and of 'Arabistan (population, 349,000), co-extensive with the alluvial plains at the head of the Gulf, are predominantly Shi'ah; 'Iraq, or rather the part of it with which we are principally concerned, contains about 546,000 Shr'ahs as against about 175,000 Sunnis, but the Sunni element has political influence out of proportion to its numerical strength, chiefly m consequence of its connection with the Government; the population of 'Arabistan, however, is almost exclusively Shi'ah. On the eastern coast of the Persian Gulf proper (population, 284,000) there is a considerable predominance of Shi'ahs except in the districts of Rud-hilleh, Shibkuh, Lingeh, Bastak, Biyaban and Jashk, in the town of Bandar 'Abbas, and on the islands of Qishm, Hanjam and Larak, where Sunnis apparently preponderate : the Sunni element on this side of the Gulf may be very roughly estimated at 100,000 souls. On the western coast of the Persian Gulf proper (population, 807,000) Sunnis, including nominal Wahhabis, predominate in every territorial division; but in Hasa and Bahrain strong ShI'ah minorities exist of about 56,000 and 40,000 souls, respectively; and the total number ot Shi'ahs on the Arabian side may be taken as approximately equal to the number of Sunnis on the Persian side. In the Gulf of 'Oman Shi'ahs are few in number. Persian Makran (population, exclusive of the Jashk district, 92,000) on the northern shores of that sea is entirely Sunni, while the Gwadar enclave (popu- 18/8 16- hJ .

On the whole it may be said that the populations of Persian race are exclusively Shi'ah and that those of Arab descent are generally Sunni; but, as we have already seen, the Arabs of Turkish J Iraq and of 'Arabistan constitute a large exception to the general rule. Again, the Persian Gulf is predominantly IShfah, chiefly on account of the countries a t its head, while the Gulf of 'Oman is almost altogether Sunni and Ibadhi. Almost the only matter concerning all Muhammadans of the Mnhamma- persian (rulf alike is that of the annual pilgrimages to the holy cities of dan pilgri- Makkahand Madinah. There are three principal routes across Arabia ma g eB to bj which pilgrims from the Persian Gulf reach Hijaz; the first runs a1 from Hofuf in Hasa via Kiyadh in Southern Najd, the second from' Kuwait via Buraidah in Qasim, and the third from Najaf in Turkish 'Iraq via Hail in Jabal Shammar.^ Of these the last, by which pilgrims from Persia generally travel, is the most important and the most regu larly used, the extent to which the other two are frequented varying with the security or insecurity of the regions that they traverse in the interior. About 1897 annual caravans used also to leave Samawah and Zubair on the borders of 'Iraq; the former consisted entirely of Arabs, but the latter contained some Persians; both were accustomed to march by Hail. The Najaf caravan is said to consist, by the time it reaches Makkah, of 8,000 to 10,000 pilgrims, or even more, of whom 1,500 or 2,000 may be Persians. The passage of these pilgrim caravans through their territory is a matter on which the rulers of Central Arabia lay much stress, chiefly on account of the revenue derived from the pilgrims in fees paid for protection against Bedouins, Various references to the pilgrim caravan question will be found in the history of Najd; and in the history of Turkish 'Iraq it is related how, in 1903, an attempt was made by some leading Persian ecclesiastics to prohibit the use of the Najaf-Hail route during the continuance of war in Central Arabia, and how this was viewed by the Porte as a deliberate effort to benefit the ruler of Kuwait at the expense of their own vassal, the Amir of Jabal Shammar. Historical events explaining the existence of Muhammadan denominations. It will probably be convenient to the reader if we give in this place a brief resume of the events to which the existeuce of the principal * These three routes are described in the article on ' NVjd ' in the Geographical Volume of this Gazetteer, with full detail of stages and dates of starting of the annual caravans. Some general information regarding the pilgrimages from the Gulf will he found in a report by Dr. Cassim Izzedine, dated 14th November 1897, which is contained in the Proceedings of the Government of India in the Foreign Department for June 1898. There is not any direct pilgrim route, though some Diaps show one, from 'OmSn to Hijaz.2352 Muhammadan denominations may be traced. Most of these historical occurrences took place in the countries of the Persian Gulf^ and for this reason, and also because they make more intelligible the subject of Shi'ah holy places and pilgrims with which we shall deal further on, a short notice of them appears desirable. Abu^Bakr ^ ^ ie P 10 ?^ Muhammad-bin-^Abdullah in 632 A.D., *Umr and ' ^bu Bakr, the father of Muhammad''s favourite wife ^Ayishah, obtained 'Othutan, the Khalifate; he ruled until his death in 634. 632 -56 A. D. Aba Bakr was succeeded by ^Umr^ another father-in-law of Muhammad^ under whom^ between the years 635 and 643, ; Iraq was completely conquered from the Sassanians of Persia by the Arab hosts of Islam. The important Muhammadan towns of Basrah and Kufah in the new province were founded about the year 638. In 644 the Khalifah •'Umr was assassinated. ''Umr had appointed before his death a board of six, who were to nominate from among themselves the next K halifah; these were ^Ali- bin-Abi Talib^ the cousin and adopted son of Muhammad^ whose daughter Fatimah he had married; Talhah-bin-^Obaid Ullah and Zubair-bin-al- ^ Aw warn, the latter a cousin of Muhammad, both of whom were early and distinguished adherents of Islam; ''Othman-bin-''Affan, who belonged to the family of the Banu ''Omaiyah but became the husband of the prophets daughters Kuqaiyah and Umm Kulthum; and two others. The choice of the board fell upon ■'Othman^ who thus succeeded to the Khalifate; but his appointment was unwelcome to many, especially to his disappointed rivals ''Ali, Talhah and Zubair, and in 656 he was murdered^ having reigned for twelve years. « m was ^ e11 ra i se d to the Khalifate; but Talhah and Zubair, who ^ ^ 6o6 ' 6 had been associated with him in opposition to ^Othman, at once went into rebellion and were joined by ■'Ayishah, the prophets widow. In the Battle of the Camel, however, fought near Old Basrah where their are still shown, Talhah and Zubair were defeated and slain ; and ; Ayishah, the 'Mother of the Faithful', became the prisoner of ''Ali. War was next declared against ''Ali by Mu^awiyah, governor of Damascus, a member of the Banu ''Omaiyah and a cousin of the murdered Khalifah ^Othman; and an encounter took place at Siffm, near Raqqah 0I J Euphrates, after which^ in deference to the wishes of a majority of Ah s supporters, the claims of the leaders were submitted to arbitration. 1 e proceedings were practically inconclusive, for ''Ali remained in possession at least of ''Iraq, while Mu^awiyah obtained the nominal Khalifate. Rise of the Meanwhile a sect known as the Khawarij, having for their ideal a theocratic state in which all other interests should be subordma e to religion, had arisen in ^Iraq. At first these enthusiasts supported ■'Ali against Mu'awiyah, whose pronouncedly secular policy was repugnan to them; but, having been convinced by the negotiations after e battle of S iff in that ''Ali was at heart no less a worldling than 18 competitor, they subsequently rebelled against him in ' raq. 6 political power of the Khawarij was, however, completely broken by a defeat which ^Ali inflicted on them in 658 in the vicinity of the Nahrwan canal, near the modern Baghdad. of 8 theAfter this, three of the Khawarij conspired to remove by assassination on a single prearranged date in the month of January 661; not only2353 at his capital Kufah, but also Mu 'awiyah at Damascus and 'Umr-foh 'All by org ibn-al-^s at Cairo,—all of whom they regarded as disturbers o£ the an ^ peace of Islam. ^Umr escaped entirely unhurt; Mu^awiyah was wounded but recovered; and the plot succeeded only in the case of ■'AH, whom ; Abdur Kahman-bin-Muljam cut down with a swoi v d in the great mosque at Kufali. ''Ali^s wound, which was on the forepart of his head, was not severe; but the sword with which it was inflicted had been poisoned, and he expired a day or two after, at the age of 63. ; Ali left three sons, named Hasan, Husain and Muhassin. Of these Khalifate of Hasan was elected by his fathers subjects to be their ruler; but he Hasan and shrunk from a conflict with the superior forces of Mu'awiyah, who had hi^ ^hdioa- not ceased to encroach on ■'Iraq; and by a treaty with the 'Omaiyid he ^ * obtained, in consideration of his renouncing his claims to the Khalifate, an amnesty for all his relations and a handsome pension for himself. Under this arrangement Mu'awiyah took possession of Kufah in the summer of 661. Hasan retired to Madinah, where he died eight or nine years later, poisoned by his wife, it was said, at the instigation of the ; Omaiyids. Mir'awiyah remained in undisputed possessidn of the nominal Hngain's in- Klialifate until his death in 680 ; but his son and successor Yazid had vasion of immediately to cope with a movement headed by Husain, the second ^ rac l' 680 A. son of ; Ali, encouraged by ''Abdullah, an ambitious son of Zubair, whose devotion to his cause does not appear to have been altogether sincere. Husain, not without hesitation, accepted an invitation from the inhabitants of ''Iraq to become their ruler and sent his cousin Muslim- bin- ; Aqil to prepare the way for him. Yazid, to meet the danger, transferred the energetic ■'Obaid Ullah, son of his own uncle Ziyad, from the government of Basrah to that of Kufah; and the capture and execution of Muslim quickly followed. Meanwhile Husain had advanced from Makkah to the borders of /Iraq; here he was met on the 1st of Muharram by a troop of horse under one Hurr, who had orders to conduct him to Kufah but did not do so ; and on the 8rd of Muharram a body of 4,000 troops^ despatched by ■'Obaid Ullah from Kufah, established themselves between the Euphrates and Husain's camp at Karbala, cutting him off from the river. Negotiations ensued, which lasted until the 9th; but no settlement could be reached, for ^Obaid Ullah insisted on the unconditional surrender of Husain and his party, and to this Husain would not agree. On the morning of Saturday the 10th of Muharram 61 A. H., corresponding to the 10th of October 680 A. D., Hurr, the leader first sent against Husain, deserted to his side; and soon afterwards fighting, chiefly in the form of single combats, began in front of Husain^s camp, which he had caused to be entrenched during the night. The attacking force was commanded by Shimr. The battle was prolonged into the afternoon; but in the end numbers pro filed, and Husain was slaughtered with his entire armed following of more than 70 persons*; among the slain were Husain s half-brotnei' Abbas and Husain's son AH Akbar. The head of Husain was sent to * The number of the Shubada or martyrs is given as 72, but tbe^ writer has not able to ascertain whether the chiefs (Husain, etc.) are included in this number. m2354 Kufah and thence to Damascus, and his body lay unburied until the next day*. Origin of The occurrences described above gave rise to the principal schism the Shi ah by which Islam is divided. It was maintained by the partisans of 'Ali schism, t and his sons, who afterwards came to be known as Shi'ahs, that ; Ali and his descendants possessed an indefeasible and exclusive right to the Khalifate; and the Shi^ahs consequently regard all those who have actually presided over Islam, with the exception of ''Ali and Hasan only, as usurpers. The Shi^ah list of the true Khalifahs, or, as they term them, of the Imams, runs as follows : (1) ; Ali, son-in-law of the prophet Muhammad; (2) Hasan, the eldest son of ''Ali by Fatimah, the daughter of Muhammad; (3) Husain, the second son of ' Ali by JFatimah, the daughter of Muhammad; (4) 'Ali, surnamed Zain-ul-'Abidin, son of Husain; (5) Muhammad-al-Baqir, son of Zain-uVAbidin; (6) J a tar- as-Sadiq, son of Muhammad-al-Baqir ; (7) Musa-al-Kadhim, son ot Ja'far; (8) 'AH-bin-Musa, known as Ar-Ridha, son of Musa-al-Kadhim ; (9) Muhammad-at-Taqi or Muhammad-al-Jawad, son of Ar-Ridha; (10) 'Ali-an-Naqi, son of Muhammad-at-Taqi; (11) Hasan-al-^Askan, son of 'Ali-an-Naqi; and (12) Muhammad-al-Mahdi, son of Hasan-al- 'AskariJ. With the last named, whom the Shi'ahs believe to be living in concealment and whose reappearance they await, ends the senes o ' the twelve Imams; and from this number the general ^ 0( ty f 0 ^ ^ 1 a s are described in common parlance as Ithnah-'Ashariyah, or o owers of the Twelve/' in contradistinction to Shi'ahs belonging to various minor sects.

Shi'ah sects in the Persian Gulf region. The following information about Shi'ah sects relates primarily to UsQlis, Bushehr and the Gulf Ports, and the extent to which it is of general Akhbaris and application is uncertain.-]- The three principal Shi^ah sects in the Shaikhis. Gulf are the Usuli, the Akhbari and the Shaikhi, of which the first is said to enjoy at the present day a great predominance everywhere in Persia and Turkish 'Iraq, while the second is the oldest, and the third is the most modern as well as the least numerous of the three. The main differences between Usulis and Akhbaris appear to be that the former admit more recent Hadith or traditions than the latter, and that they allow the validity of decisions reached by means of Ijma J , or the assembling of learned men, even at the present day. The Akhbaris hold special Friday prayers like the Sunnis, and some of their Mullas do not forbid to associate, or even to eat and drink, with Jews and Christians; in both of these respects they are apparently at variance with the Usulis and the Shaikhis. The differences between the Akhbaris and the Usulis seem to have become acute for the first time under the Safavi dynasty^ which preceded that of the Qajars ; and now they are so accentuated that the members of the two sects will not pray in each other's mosques. The Akhbaris are said to date from the earliest days of Islam, the History ^ oi Usulis from about 350 A. H.; and, until comparatively recent times, the the Akh han8. Shi^ahs of the Gulf appear to have been mostly Akhbaris. The princi pal Mujtahid or divine of the Akhbaris in the 18th century was the still famous Shaikh Yusuf-al-Asfur, who died about 1770 A. D.; he was succeeded by Shaikh Husain-bin-Muhammad, who is said to have been a prolific writer and to have settled at Bushehr about the time that the 'Utub conquered Bahrain (1783 A. D.). After Shaikh Husain came, about the year 1845, his son Shaikh Hasan ; and the next head of the Akhbaris in the Gulf was Shaikh Khalif, whose death took place about the year 1857 at Sarkuvardan in Dashtistan. Khalif was followed by his son Shaikh 'Abdul 'Ali, who died about 1886. To 'Abdul'Ali succeeded the present Imam Jum'eh of Bushehr; he is said to have over 2,000 followers at that place, besides a number in Bahrain. These * In a report received from Bahrain, however, the term Sharif is stated to mean only a descendant through males of Hasan, the son of 'All and Ffitimah. t It should be added that the reports on which this paragraph is based, though founded on the statements of Mujtahids at Bushehr, are far from clear ; and the in- |ormation given must therefore be accepted with reserve. The subject is not one that any but an expert in Muhammadan theology and ecclesiastisal history could m with satisfaetorily, 1 158 a2356 successive chief Mujtaliids of the Gulf Akhbaris seem all to have belonged to the same Asfur family as the celebrated Shaikh Yusuf; but their influence has greatly declined during the last few generations. History of The Shaikhis take their name from Shaikh Ahmad-bin-Zain-ud-Din, the Shaikhis. who flourished in Hasa between 1785 and 1825 ; Shaikh Kadhim^ liis successor^ died at Karbala about 1843; and after Shaikh Kadhim a certain Shaikh Muhammad Karim Khan became prominent, who was born about 1810 and died about 1871. Another leading Shaikln was Haji Muhammad Khan, whose son, also named Haji Muhammad Khan, is said to be the principal expounder of the Shara ; at the present time at Kirman and to belong to the royal Qajar family. There is strong opposition between the Usulis and the Shaikhis, but the nature ot t eir differences has not been satisfactorily explained. On the Persian coas of the Gulf there are onlv about 50 Shaikhis at Bushehr and a veiy ew at Bandar 'Abbas and Lingeh, but they are understood to be more numerous in other parts of Persia. Shi'ali shrines in 'Iraq. The Slii'ah shrines of 'Iraq may he divided into three poups: first, those connected with the death of ^ Ali; second, those connecte wi battle of Karbala; third, those connected with Imams later an i Sacred places The spot where 'Ali was mortally wounded is shown in g ^ connected mosque of Kufah ; and his reputed tomb is the sole object ot m e r Wlthtlie the town of Najaf, which has grown up around it m the midst oi in hospitable deserts.

The tombs of the tenth and eleventh Imams, a | g0 Muhammad and Hasan-bin-'Ali, are to be seen at Samarrah, w ^ ec ted is exhibited a well, situated in a subterranean apartment and 1-. p ea . by a silver grating,—the scene, according to tradition, of tlie 1 ranee of Muhammad-bin-Hasan-al-M ahdi, the twelfth Imam. 1 is said, however, to show himself at intervals at the Masjid -as2357 a mosque in tlie vicinity of Najaf. Other serines of minor importance associated with the names of members of the Imam family are those of Abnl Qasim, a son of the Imam Hasan^ and of Saiyid Ibrahim^ a gonof the Imam Musa, both near Musaiyib • also those of Hamzah and Jasim, a son and grandson respectively of the Imam Musa, situated some miles to the eastward of Hillah, and those of Ibn-al-Hasan, the Banat -al- Hasan and Ibn-al-Hamzah, in the neighbourhood of Tawainj. The management of the Shfah shrines in ^Iraq is vested in the Administra- Auqaf or Turkish Department of Religious Endowments, by whom the custodians and attendants are paid and, it would seem, appointed. At Venues oT each of the principal shrines, viz., that of ; Ali at Najaf, those of Husain the shrines, and 'Abbas at Karbala, that of Kadhimain and, apparently, that of Samarrah, there is a Custodian, called the Kiliddar or Key Keeper, a Sarkhidmah or Chief Attendant and a variable number of Khadims or Attendants; the staff at Samarrah are reported to be Sunnis. The salary of a Custodian is 500 gold piastres (about £4-10-0) a month, of a Chief Attendant 80 gold piastres (about 145. U) a month, and of an Attendant (if paid) 25 gold piastres (about fa. 6d.} a month; but the KiHddar of Najaf is one of the richest men in Turkish 'Iraq. Paid Attendants number 15 at each of the great shrines of Karbala and at the shrines of Najaf and Kadhimain ; and there are also 950 Attendants at Karbala, 250 at Najaf and 30 at Samarrah, whose existence, though they are unpaid, seems to be officially recogni sed. For. the finances and accounts of the shrines, which are supported partly by large endowments in the shape of lands, houses and shops, and partly by special donations and contributions, the Auqaf are responsible; and the sacred treasures of the shrines also, consisting largely of jewellery and objects made from the precious metals, of which the items and value are not known even approximately to outsiders, are in charge of the officials of the Department, by whom they are periodically checked and examined. Registers of donations are kept by the Kiliddars under the supervision of the Auqaf. It is stated that the treasures of the shrines may be drawn on for a defensive war against infidels, but only under a general agreement of the Mujtahids, or by order of the Sultan of Turkey. The Persian Government make ^ an annual grant of 3,000 Tumans to the Kiliddars of Karbala for lighting, another of 2,000 Tumans to the Kiliddar of Najaf for the general maintenance of 'Ali's tomb, and a third of 1,250 Tumans to the Kilid dar of Kadhimain, SM'ali shrines in the Gulf outside 'Iraq. In the Gulf region, the interest of Shi'ahs being almost altogether monopolised by the sacred places in 'Iraq just enumerated, there are few other Shi'ah shrines of importance; but mention may be made ot Shah Abul Shah in the Hindiyan district on the Persian coast, which is dedicated to Shaikh 'Abdullah, a brother of Ar-Ridha, the eight i Imam. Petty shrines are numerous and are generally either Imamzadehs or Qadamgahs, the former being apparently actual tombs, an c latter cenotaphs, of members of the family of the Imams,2358 The SM'ah pilgrimages to 'Iraq. Conditions of making the pilgri mage, Koutes and movements of the pil grims. Annual number of pilgrims. The Slii^alis consider their pilgrimages to the shrines of ; Iraq to be highly meritorious^ more especially because they are voluntary, instead of being obligatory like the Hajj or general pilgrimage of all Muham- madans to Makkah and Madinah. It is incumbent on a Shi'ah pilgrim, before he leaves his home, to make his will, to pay his debts, and to appoint trustees to take charge of his property and perform the necessary rites in case of his death on pilgrimage. The funds taken by the pil grim for his expenses on pilgrimage must have been honestly obtained; and, if there is any doubt on this head, or if they are contaminated by having reached him from a Government department, they must be purified by a process known as Eadd-al-Madhalim this consists in distributing one-eighth of the whole in charity to deserving poor, or in handing the whole to a pious Mujtahid or divine, who returns it after deducting a trifle. The pilgrims from north-western Persia mostly cross the frontier at Khanaqin; those from Southern Persia, from the Persian Uult, ana from India mostly enter ^Iraq by sea, landing at Basrah. There being no fixed time of year for the Shi'ah pilgrimages the cold ~. e ' r generally chosen in order to make the journey less arduous, in pilgrims by land ride horses or are carried in litters, while women children are conveyed in Kajavas or panniers. Each band o P &amp; is guided by a Chaush or conductor, who ^es a red or green inscribed with a text of the Quran or with the names of e ' and is preceded by a caparisoned horse hung with bells ot tones and sizes. Pilgrims coming by land from the ^ ersia ^ ordinarily visit Kadhimain first and then proceed 7 8 ^ i^ e to Karbala and Najaf; this too is the course f ^ lowed ov T amer generality of pilgrims from the Gulf, who^ take the nv from Basrah to Baghdad; but a few of the pilgrims^ arrlv ^? ^ before travel up the Euphrates from Basrah to a ^ d . s ^ e ^ a a r Li a aI1 d they reach Karbala. All or nearly all pilgrims visit Na3af, K Kadhimain, but it is estimated that only about one-four ^ go to Samarrah; those who do make the journey by £ + from Kadhimain, by a road west of the Tigris running ^ a place opposite Samarrah. The only minor Shi'ah shrines i p. ^ all commonly visited by pilgrims from abroad are those to and Jasim near Hillah. The stay of the pilgrims m Iraq i ^ average about two months, and it is estimated that m e the poorer soft spend from Rs. 60 to Rs. 100, and the r cases very large sums^ partly on the maintenance of ^ emS j S , • w and animals, partly in the purchase of ordinary and sacred ar ' ^ partly in donations to the shrines and in presents to officials ana g The winter influx of pilgrims, while it sometimes introduces a stimulates internal and in a lesser degree external trade, and large amount of money into the country. According to Tur ? S ?. c tions statistics the number of Shi'ah pilgrims entering 'Iraq from all u was ^3,990 in 1889 and 57,567 in 1890, from which it w0 T n that the pilgrimages fluctuate considerably from year to year.( I? ; 2359 the years cited about three-fourths of the pilgrims arrived via Khanaqin a nd most of the remainder vid Basrah. In the cold weather of 1904-05 the pilgrims from abroad arriving at Basrah were as follows : — Oofcober 1904 November „ December „ January 1906 February „ March „ Total 579 352 1,139 1,709 1,204 1,526 6,509 Very few pilgrims from abroad land at Basrah during the other months of the year. In 1877-78 the Persian pilgrims embarking at Bushehr for ; Iraq numbered about 2,500. The number of Indians included among the pilgrims arriving annually at Basrah is large, and a very considerable proportion of them are Bohrahs. A pilgrim, at his visit to one of the great Shi^ah shrines in ^Iraq, first Ceremonies purifies himself by means of certain prescribed ablutions • he then performed by enters the sacred precincts, generally under the guidance of an Attendant. 1)1 S rims - At the threshold of the shrine proper he asks the permission of the saint to approach. Having passed in, he recites some prayers and circumambulates the grave three times, kissing the railings and repeating prayers; finally he prostrates himself twice before the tomb. Those pilgrims who are rich enough, and who desire to obtain additional merit, engage Mullas to read the Quran and to recite the story of the martyrdom of Husain, etc.; they also distribute alms and food to the poor, and make offerings of money and jewellery to the shrine. Such at least is the procedure followed at the shrine of Husain at Karbala. The prayers said in the precincts are both Du% or voluntary prayers, offered here in the name of ^Ali or of Husain, and Namaz or the ordinary fixed prayers which are prescribed for particular times of the days. The act of visiting the shrine is called Ziyarat The pilgrims provide themselves, especially at Karbala, with rosaries, with Turbahs sjy or the tablets of sacred earth on which Shr'ahs press their foreheads in prostrating themselves at prayer, and with shrouds for the future use of themselves or their friends, stamped or inscribed with texts from the Quran. After visiting the holy places a pilgrim is entitled to use the title of ' Karbalai.' Although, as already mentioned, there is no stated time or season for Auspicious the performance of the Shi-'ah pilgrimages, certain days of the d ays for Muhammadan year are accounted more auspicious than others for the purpose.

Every Shfah desires to repose after death in sacred ground at one of the holy places in ''Iraq, for he believes that he will receive, in the Day of Judgment, the protection of the saint whose tomb his own grave adjoins. The principal consecrated nemeteries of ^Iraq—outside the precincts of shrines themselves in which also burials take place—-are, in order of importance, the following: the Wadi-as-Salam or 'Vale of Peace/' at Najaf; the Wadi-al-Aiman or 'Vale of Security,' at Karbala; the Maqabir-al-Quraish, at Kadhimain; and Tarmah at Samarrah. The last is little used. The bodies of Shi'ahs dying in Persia are often placed in a bricked-up room or vault until they become desiccated, and are then sent to 'Iraq by caravan, in wooden coffins covered with thick felt, for interment at one of the places mentioned above. On arrival at their destination the bodies are publicly washed before burial,—a proceeding very dangerous to the public health and one which may in part explain the frequency of severe epidemics in 'Iraq, especially at Najaf. A pack animal with a coffin slung on each side is one of the commonest objects encountered by a cold-weather traveller on his way from Karbala to Baghdad; and he will be fortunate if he has not to share the caravansarai where he halts with some relics of mortality* The expense, including fees payable to the Turkish Government, of transporting a Shi'ah corpse from Kirmanshah to Karbala varies from 35 to 70 Tumans or, -at present rates, from £6 to £12 English. Dishonest muleteers are said sometimes to throw bodies committed to their care into the river Diyalah and to embezzle the funds with which they have been entrusted for burial expenses j and various pecuniary extortions are practised by the Killddars and other officials at the holy places in connection with the interment of bodies. A few Shi''ah corpses for burial are brought from India by sea. The number of Shi'ah bodies buried at the holy places in 1889 and 1890 was officially estimated as below:— Year. Bodies of Persian subjects. Bodies of Ottoman subjects. Total. 1889 1890 5,620 9,754 4,000 4,600 9,620 14,354 * According to an enthusiastic Shi'ab, if a man purify himself in the Euphrates oh this day and walk to Karbala before noon, he gains merit, for every step taken by tne w&amp;y, equal to that acquired by 60,000 or 70,000 pilgric\ageg to Makkah.Fiscal and other arrangements of the Persun and Turkish Governments in connection with Shi'ah pilgrimages and burials. „ p„ rKian riilsrims by land to the holy places are Squired by the fmportation Persian Government, if they travel mounted, to obtain P^mn paeeporte of bodies. at a cosf of 20 Qrans, or about 6«.

The term Mujtahid f was orginally applied, throughout all branches Muj tabids of Islam, to a Muhammadan divine who had attained to the highest and^Shi'ah ^ eminence in his profession. The founder of the four principal schools of Mu j ta hids the Sunnis were known as Mujtahids ; but at the present day the term geneia * is in use only among the Shi^ahs, whose ecclesiastical leaders are still called by this name. The modern Shi''ah Mujtahid combines in himself several functions; he is a lecturer on Muhammadan theology and Jaw, a judge of ecclesiastical suits—that is of nearly all civil causes—, and a registrar of wills and other documents* The ascendancy of the Mujtahids over Persianslof all classesj is very remarkable; among Shi'ahs their word is law; they disburse large sums received from their co-religionists for sacred and charitable purposes; and in Persia, and even means Portico Iwan Dhahab » o)« In this column Ruwaq means 'Golden Vestibule' Hijrat-as-Sahn c; r S r^ J l 8;^ means 'Chamberin the Courtyard' and Ardh-as-Shau mean® 'Ground of the Courtyard' these are all apparently within the precincts of the shrines.

This appears to be a result of constitutionalism in Persia (1912).2364 in Turkish 'Iraq, they exercise strong political influence, sometimes in opposition to the established government of the country The recogni tion of an individual as a Mujtahid is unregulated by any fixed principle; the chief factor seems to be public opinion.

Saiyid Mubammad Baqir, Bebbebani. Kalb-i-Baqir^ Indian (III). Saiyid Husain^ Qumi. The figures (I), (II) and (III) opposite some of the names indicate that the individuals so marked bad been classed by Majoi Newmarch as Mujtahids of the first^ second, and third rank respectively. The appear ance of other names in the list is due to the fact that many of the persons regarded by Major Newmarch as the only genuine Mujtahids decline! to accept allowances from the Bequest, some from religious scruples, some on account of the annoyance from beggars to which they would become exposed; and some because they had already all the money that they required; partly, also, it may be due to the appearance of new Mujtahids between 190^ and 1906. The most prominent of all the Mujtahids, before bis death in 1904, was Mubammad-al-Garawi-asb- Sharbiyani of Najaf, who politely declined to receive an allowance from the Bequest on the ground that be bad no need of one. The town of Shusbtar in Northern 'Arabistan is the seat .of two The Mujta- Mujtahid families of great local importance. The chief Mujtabid of Shushtar in 1905 was Haji Saiyid 'Abdus Samad, a large landowner^ whose attitude towards the British Government was then friendly ; he had two sons, Haji Agha Mubammad Ja'far and Haji Ahmad. The former of these was a middle-aged man, who bad a considerable part in the management of his father's affairs, and who, though be did not seek intercourse wiib Europeans, was civil to those whom he met. The second family was that of Shaikh Mubammad 'Ali, who died in 1904/ leaving three sons, Muhammad Jawad, Muhammad Karim and Murtaza, and a sister's son named Saiyid ■'Abdullah. These all enjoyed the title of Agha Shaikh ; and of the three Muhammad Jawad was the most influential, while the youngest, Murtaza, aged 21 in 1905, was open- minded and interested in foreigners, knew some English, had visited Bombay and Moulmein—at both of which places the^ family owned property—and was popular in the town. The internal affaiis of Shushtai, before the, arrival of a strong Persian Governor in 190o in the person * Some of the villages owned by him are specified in the articles &lt;f Gargar ' and «%5nab ' in the Geographical Volume of the Gazetteer,2366 of the Sardar-i-Mukarram, were almost entirely managed by tlie Mujtaliids. Between 1905 and 1907 the influence of the family of Shaikh Muhammad 'Ali was completely destroyed by a combination between the Sardar-i- Mukarram and the family of Saiyid 'Abdus Samad; but it is expected that it will revive in course of time. The Mujta- Dizful, the largest town of Northern ''Arabistan, is also the resi- dence of some Mujtabids, but they are less influential than those of D Shushtar. The principal Mujtahid family in 1905 was one headed by Agha Shaikh Muhammad Hasan, Hujjat-ul-Islam, who was then 70 vears of age and was regarded as the chief Mujtahid ; he had a son Agha Shaikh Muhammad Baqir, then aged 45, and a grandson, Sadr-ud-Dm, aged 17, a son of the last. The next Mujtahid family in importance was that of Shaikh Muhammad Hasan, who was dis tinguished by the title of Ansar ^ and was himself 70 years ot age; he had a son Agha Shaikh^ Muhammad, aged 46. A third family at this time was that of Agha Shaikh Muhammed Hiza, a nephew of the chief Mujtahid, who had a son, 18years 0 * a g e &gt; ^ al f. e Shaikh Muhammad. Shaikh Muhammad Hasan, the chief Mujtahid, was generally liked and respected and was uniformly pleasant and po i e in his dealings with the British Vice-Consul in Arabistan. n the influence of the Ansar family was on the wane. Only e . family were possessed of private wealth, and the other two su sis e chiefly on the offerings of the devout. The Mujtahids are m iz u the dispensers of public charity and collect for that purpose^ Zakat or alms prescribed in the Quran; most of them, however, aving private property, are supposed to act upon a familiar prover o detriment of the destitute and the distressed.

Shi'ah visitors to India from Persian Gulf, other than merchants, are generally religious beggars, and their proceedings sometimes attract attention of the Indian Police ^ ; they are accustomed, besides asking for contributions, to quarter themselves upon Shi'ah householders, who have often difficulty in getting rid of them. About the end of 1896 Shaikh Eiza, a Khadim of the Kadhimain Shaikh Kiza, shrine, arrived in India, apparently to collect subscriptions ; and during 189 the next nine months he visited a number of places in India^ including Lucknow ; Haidarabad (Dakkhan), Bombay, Karachi and Khairpur. At Karachi he was countenanced by the Turkish Consul, who tried to obtain for him an interview with the Mir of Khairpur. The body of the late Mir had passed through Kadhimain on the way to Karbala, and the Shaikh averred that those accompanying it had promised a good reception at Khairpur to any visitor from Kadhimain; but the Mir persisted in refusing the desired interview, and at the end of Sept ember Shaikh Riza returned to Bombay. A better-known Shi'ah visitor was Saiyid Salih of Karbala, who Saiyid Salih, several times came to India to beg subscriptions for the shrine of 1897 and Husain; this individual, who had a claim of some sort at Karbala, 8 ^ was known to the British Resident at Baghdad, between whom and the Turkish authorities he had more than once tried to make mis chief. One of the Saiyid^s journeys was made in 1897, when, after visiting Upper India, he came down in September from Muradabad to Bombay and thence returned home by sea via Karachi and Muhammareh. In 1899 Salih was again in India; landing at Karachi in April he visitedMultan, Rampur, Lucknow and Simla; in June he was again at Lucknow ; from Lucknow he removed to Murshidabad ; and in reached the port of Bombay. Sunni sects in the Persian Gulf region. The four ordinary Sunni sects, the Hanafi, Hanbali, Maliki and Shafi'i, are all found in the Persian Gulf ; but on the subject of their distribution, etc., no useful generalisation appears to be possible. The sects to which particular tribes belong are generally specified in the Geographical Volume of this Gazetteer. Some of the Hanafis are practi cally indistinguishable from Wahhabis. Sunni shrines in the Persian Gulf region. The only important Sunni shrine in the whole region of the Persian Shrine of Gulf is that of Shaikh 'Abdul Qadir, Gilani, at Baghdad. 'Abdul Qadir, who was born in the province of Gilan near the Caspian Sea about the year 1077 A. D. and died at Baghdad about 1165, was a Sufi Baghdkd. * Probably manj eacapo observation.

The mosque and tomb of Shaikh ^Abdul Qadir, honorifically described as ' Janab Ghauth-al-AMham; Dastgir^', not only form one of the principal sights of Baghdad, but are also a centre of great religious importance and are visited by Sunni Muhamma- dans from all parts of the world, especially from Afghanistan and India; poor pilgrims and sojourners who cannot pay their way are supported as long as they care to stay at the shrine ; and it is said that as many as 4,000 loaves of bread are sometimes issued daily from the kitchen of the ^Pir-i-Dastgir The shrine was once a focus of political intrigue and a sanctuary from the law, but the Turkish authorities have now brought it under control. The revenues accruing to the shrine from en* dowments and pious bequests are stated to amount to £T 12,000 per ammm. Other Sunni There are some other shrines, respected by Sunnis, in ■'Iraq and in shrines. other parts of the Persian Gulf; but none of them is comparable in importance with that of Shaikh ''Abdul Qadir. Among the minor Sunni shrines are^ in ''Iraq, the Maqam Yunas at Kufah and the tomb of Ezekiel at Kifl, regarding which the geographical articles on the two towns may be consulted; the tomb of Ezekiel, however, is more venerated by Jews than it is by Muhammadans, The Sunni Naqib of Baghdad. Tha Nan lb of The most influential of all Sunnis in the countries adjoining the Baghdad. Persian Gulf is the Naqib of Baghdad, the official head of the Arab community there. The appointment to the Niqabat, a dignity which exists in other places also in the Ottoman empire, is made by the Sultan of Turkey on the recommendation of the local authorities; but in practice the succession is treated as hereditary. From the derivation of the word Naqib, which seems to imply that the holder of the office was originally an elected chief, it may perhaps be inferred that the Niqabat is older than Turkish rule ; and, whatever the case may be in this respect, it lS certain that the importance of the Naqib at the present day depends,^ 0 upon Turkish recognition, but upon his descent and upon the saeredness of the shrine of Shaikh ^Abdul Qadir, Gilani, of which he is custodian. The Naqib, in fact, possesses enormous religious influence and socia prestige apart from his relations with the Turkish Government; and Q Ottoman officials, from a consciousness that he could thwart or at leas seriously obstruct any of their measures to which he might be oppose, always^' endeavour to stand well with him.

Baghdad.f2369 159 aI1( | a s the keepers of his shrine; but their claim to Siyadat, that is to the ra iik of Saiyid, depending on an assumption that the original Shaikh was descended from Hasan-bin-'Ali-bin-AJbi Talib, is not undisputed. Shaikh ^Abdul Qadir, Gilani, had, it is said, three sons, of whom one, 'Abdul 'Aziz, was the progenitor of the Qadiriyah family of Baghdad, while his brothers ; Abdul Wahhab and 'Abdur Razzaq, who migrated to India and Syria respectively, founded Qadiriyah families which still exist in those countries. The Qadiriyah of Baghdad pay much attention to tho education of their children; and the members of the family, who in general appreciate the importance of Muhammadan learning to persons ioldino* a position such as theirs, sometimes voluntarily continue their studies in later life. The present Naqib, Saiyid 'Abdur Rahman Effendi, is considered to be one of the greatest Muhammadan scholars of his time; but he is represented as vain and pompous-characteristics which the adulation that he receives from almost all Sunnis must certainly tend to foster; and he is certainly timid. The Naqib and his relations own large private estates, which are distinct from the lands attached to the shrine of Shaikh 'Abdul Qadir. Extreme attention and deference are paid to the Naqib and his Relations of family by many of the most influential and wealthy, as well as by the the Naqib's humblest and poorest, among Indian and Afghan Muslims.

In May 1905 a sum of Rs. 5,000 and a box of valuable cloth was despatched from Haidarabad to Baghdad in charge of an officer of His Highness's Irregular Troops; and one of the Nizam's Begams, it was said, accompanied the presents, taking with her a few personal attendants. Sardar Ayub Khan, the Afghan refugee in India, and his followers are said to remit some two thousand rupees every year to the Naqib of Baghdad. In passing through Baghdad on their way from Persia to India in 1888, Sardar Ayub Khan and his party made presents of the value of Rs. 3,000 to the Naqib, then Saiyid Salman Effendi; and the Sardar received in return, nominally from the Naqib's brother Saiyid Mustafa Effendi, a fine horse worth Rs. 1,^00 ; but the Naqib personally avoided showing him favour lest he should give offence to Abdur Mman Khan, the ruling Amir of Afghanistan. At a later date the e Wer daughter of Sardar Muhammad Hashim Khan, a relation of Sardar Ayub Khan, was betrothed to a son of Saiyid Salman,_ but died about 190 before the marriage could take place. The Saidar has named one of his sons 'Abdur Rahman Jan after the present Naqi^ . A brother of Sardar iMuhammad Hashim Khan, in writing to baiyid Mahmud, the eldest son of the present Naqib, once used the following expressions, remarkable for their humility: ' If you will 'condescend to accept me as the dog of the meanest dog ot your 'ftwshold, be sure that my head will reach the heavens because ot ' pride and honour.'2370 Proceedings of memberB of the Naqib's family in India, 1895-1905. A short account of tours which have been made in India in recent years by members of the Naqib's family may be given here to illustrate the extent and degree of their influence in that country. After Sardar Ayub Khan^s arrival in India he was visited at Visits of Eawalpindi by Saiyid Hasan, a younger brother of the present Naqib, who remained with him for some months and returned to Baghdad in 1895. A year or two later Saiyid Hasan sent a servant to India with Saiyid Hasan, a horse, valued at Rs. 700, for Ayub Khan ; the Sardar dismissed the 1895-1900. 6er Y an t with a donation of Rs. 200 and with presents worth Rs. 500 for the shrine of Shaikh ^Abdul Qadir. In 1897 Saiyid Hasan was reported to have come to Rawalpindi, but it is not certain that he did. In June 1899 Saiyid Hasan was again with Sardar Ayub Khan at Rawalpindi, having come, it was stated, for an eye operation ; at the end of August he visited Peshawa', where the Zakha Khel Afridi Maliks Kbawas Khan and Wali Muhammad Khan were said to have had an interview with him ;* in February 1900 he returned to Rawalpindi, and in April he passed through Lahore on his way to Haidarabad in the Dakkhan, where he remained for some time. He seems to have complained or the proceedings in India of swindlers who passed themselves on as belonging to his family. In December 1895 Saiyid Muhammad, a nephew of the Naqib and only son of Saiyid Zain-al-''Abidin, left Baghdad on a journey to India ; but he did not apparently arrive in Bombay until the beginning of May 1896. He was followed by his uncle Saiyid ^Abdus Salain, e youngest brother of the Naqib, whose departure from Baghdad oo' place in July 1896. It was believed at first that Saiyid Muhamma was the bearer of a message from the Sultan of Turkey to the of Afghanistan, relating to the attitude of the European poweis i respect of the Armenian atrocities; but subsequent events tende discredit this theory. It was also stated that Saiyid M uhamma quarrelled with his uncle the Naqib, had been deprived of his F?P el ^ and had therefore found it advisable to leave Baghdad ; but this never verified. The Government of India, after due oons^era i ; decided that no obstacle should be thrown in the way of either aiy should he wish to proceed from India to Afghanistan. Saiyid mad, having collected some money from the Memon communij Bombay arrived, towards the end of August 1896, after Ahmadabad, Jaipur, Ajmir and other places, at Hasan Abdal, e , Rawalpindi and Peshawar.

He arrived at Rawalpindi at the beginning of October and thence made a flying excursion to Murree, where he met Sardar Ayub Khan and extracted from him Rs. 300. Immediately after this he joined his nephew Saiyid Muhammad at Hasan Abdal, where the latter^ assisted by the refugee Sardar Muhammad Ibrahim Khan, eldest son of the late Afghan Amir, Sher ''Ali Khan, had been engaged in attempting to get permission from the Amir 'Abdur Rahman for a visit to Kabul; the Amir's answer, which arrived on the 25th of September, was unfavour able. Later it transpired that the Amir suspected the Saiyid's relations with his uncle the Naqib to be unsatisfactory, or at least that he found this a convenient excuse for declining to receive him; apparently, however, he sent him a present. On the 8th of October 1896 the two Saiyids arrived at Peshawar together and were received with much respect by a number of local Muhammadans. Saiyid Muhammad lodged with Mufti Muhammad Ibrahim, and Saiyid 'Abdus Salam with Ghulam Samdani, contractor. At Peshawar Saiyid Muhammad had a meeting with Khawas Khan, Zakha Khel Malik of the Khaibar, and was said to have asked him for Rs. 2,000; but the astute Afridi only paid him Rs. 10 in cash and offered him a daughter in marriage, 1 a proposal which Saiyid Muhammad evaded by repre senting that he had already two wives. Saiyid ' Abdus Salam remained at Peshawar for about a fortnight and then returned to Rawalpindi, where he spent a month with Sardar Ayub Khan; towards the end of November, on his way back to Karachi, he visited Dera Ismail Khan, where large numbers of Afghan Powindas came out to meet him and presented him with Rs. 700; but the Saiyid's health was at this time delicate; and, finding the crowding of the devotees unpleasant, ne shut himself up closely, during his stay, in the house where he lodged. After further futile attempts to obtain an interview with the Nawwab of Bahawalpur he finally left Karachi for Baghdad at some time in December 1896. Meanwhile Saiyid Muhammad had not relaxed nis efforts to induce the Amir to let him come to Kabul; but that ruler was inexorable, and early in December the Saiyid quitted Peshawar for Rawalpindi^ where he enjoyed the hospitality of Sardar Ayub Khan for more than a month, and accepted at his departure a gift of Rs. 2,000. In January 1897 Saiyid Muhammad visited Lahore, where he lived tor three weeks with Nawwab Fat-h 'Ali Khan; engaged in a correspon dence with the Bahawalpur State, which apparently had no result; and obtained Rs. 200 from Muhammad 'Ali Khan, a son of the ^te Nawwab Nasir 'Ali Khan, besides various sums, it was believed, Jjom others of the Lahore Nawwab fraternity. Before the middle of ebruary 1897 Saiyid Muhammad reached Haidarabad in the Dakkhan, ^nere, on the 18th of September, he had a night interview lasting 1 1 ^ a.m , with His Highness the Nizam; but it seems doubtful, nough he was entertained by the dignitaries of the state, whether he I e 8 c ^ Ye d. rauch financial assistance at Haidarabad. Throughout 1897 and Saiyid Muhammad remained at Haidarabad. In December 1897 ail d January 1898 letters were written by Saiyid 'Abdus Salam at 1 ad to a native of Kalat residing at Quetta; they were of an2372 ordinary character, but pointed to the existence of a correspondence between the writer and Sardar Sir Nauroz Khan, Naushirwani. Subsequent After the travels above described in India Saiyid Hasan appears to proeeodings settled down at Quetta ; and Saiyid 'Abdus Salam at Haidarabad in H-fra fcDakkh.., 'Abdus Salam Saiyid Hasan in 1904 succeeded in obtaining permission to visit in India. Kabul from the Amir Habib Ullah Khan and left India for the Afghan capital on the 6th of December in that year; in 1908 he was believed to be still at Kabul. In 1907 Saiyid Muhammad, son of Saiyid Ahmad and (?) nephew of the Naqib, went to Jalalabad in Afghanistan and thence returned to Baghdad intending to fetch the mother and sister of Saiyid Hasan. Saiyid ^bdus Salam on his part opened relations with the Nawwab of Dir on the North-Western Frontier of India, who from time to time made him presents in money, aggregating, it is believed, about Rs. 10,000, and also sent offerings to the shrine at Baghdad through the Turkish Consul-General at Bombay. Subsequently the Nawwab of Dir proposed to give one of his daughters in inarriage to Saiyid ''Abdus Salam, but it was apparently arranged that the Nawwab should first pay a visit to the Naqib at Baghdad, where it was suggested that he should build himself a house and acquire a graveyard for the burial of Pathans dying at Baghdad. In December 1904) Saiyid ^Abdus Salam arrived at Peshawar, apparently for the purpose of conducting the Nawwab to Baghdad; but the sudden death of that ruler put an end to the scheme. Nothing has been heard since of the proposed matri monial alliance; and the present Nawwab does not appear to have the same personal regard as his father for the members of the Naqib s family. In 1908 Saiyid ''Abdus Salam was reported to be at Quetta. The journeys of these individuals in India have been ostensibly begging tours ; but it is believed that they have also conduced to intri gues of a political tendency ; and more than once reason was found tor suspecting that ; Abdul Hamid, Sultan of Turkey, utilised the Naqib o Baghdad as a medium of communication with the Amir of Afghanistan. The Naqib of Basrah. Position and At Basrah also, in Turkish ^Iraq, there is a Sanni Naqib ^ property of religious influence is small as compared with that of the Naqi the Naqib of Baghdad, and his importance depends chiefly on his wealth and 011 employment of himself and his family by the Turks in political ni a .. The usual residence of the Basrah Naqib is at Sabiliyat on the Sna ''Arab, but he has also a large residence at Basrah town and a . c0 ?. ra j house at Rafidhiyah near Zubair. Besides these he owns agricu estates at Nahr ''Umr, Jazirat-al-^Ain, Muhaijaran, Yusifan, n | ; g Kut-ash-Shaikh, Nahr Khos, Abu Ibgai^ and other places on the , of the Shatt-al-'Arab, and possesses property on the island ^ ' a iflt t2373 and the whole of Ziyadiyah Island in the same river. In 1904 about 200 boats at Basrah and in the neighbourhood belonged to tte Naqib. The Naqjb of Basrah immediately before 1874 was 'Abdur Rahman, Family of who died in that year and was succeeded by his brother Saiyid the Naqib of Muhammad Sa'id; on the death of the latter, in 1896, the Niqabat Basrah, il passed to his son Saiyid Bajab, the present Naqib, by whom the active duties of the Niqabat had been discharged during the last six years of his father's life. The most prominent ^ members of Saiyid Kajab's family were, until lately, his brother Saiyid Ahmad and his son Saiyid Talib. Saiyid Ahmad, however, died in 1908. The last Naqib, Saiyid Muhammad Sa'id, received a decoration from p o iiti 0 al em- the Sultan of Turkey for assistance given by him, probably in 1871 and ployment of certainly before his succession to the Niqabat, in persuading the A1 Thani the _ Naqib Shaikh of Qatar to declare himself a dependent of the Porfce. In 1900, ^ am ^y as related in the history of Kuwait, the late Saiyid Ahmad and Saiyid ^ Turks Talib were employed to mediate in an imbroglio between the Amir of Jabal Shammar and the Shaikh of Kuwait, which occurred on the borders of Turkish ; Iraq; and towards the end of 1901 the Naqib himself, Saiyid Rajab, was twice sent to Kuwait to recall the Shaikh of that place to a sense of his duty towards the Sultan of Turkey. In June 1902 Saiyid Talib was appointed Mutasarrif of Hasa; he was recalled in 1903 on account of an incident of his administration which is described in the history of Hasa, but he seems to have retained the appointment, in name at least, until 1905. At one time he was considered a likely candidate for the Waliship of Basrah. Saiyid Talib was apparently, at this time of his life ; an ardent pan-Islamist.t The Ibadhi denomination of Islam in the Persian Gulf region. We have already seen that in the Sultanate of 'Oman, which has a population of about half a million souls, a denomination of Muhammadan- ism known as the Ibadhi (or Biyadhi enjoys an ascendancy, or is at least as powerful as any other. The principles of the Ibadhis or Ibadhiyah are said to have been introduced into 'Oman by individual Khawarij who survived the destruction of their sect, as a political party, | jty ; Ali-bin-Abi-Talib at the battle of Nahrwan ; and this much at least ^certain, that the Ibadhi denomination is of Khariji origin.

The memorandum betrays an intense distrust of Great ' ri taiii and dislike of Persia, and the suggestions which it contains may have ? 0n tributed to bring about the disastrous Turkish invasion and occupation of Najd in 1904-06.

D. by ^Abdullah-bin-Ibadh, Tamimi, from .wbom its name is most probably derived.* The Ibadhi principles were rapidly adopted by the population of 'Oman, and it is related that by the 13th century of the Christian era they had become not only predominant but almost universal. Principles of We are not concerned here with the theological doctrinesf of the Ibadhis; the IbaahiB. we mug t account of their views on the subject of religious govern ment,—the matter on which they themselves appear, in the beginning, to have laid the most stress. The early Ibadhis differed from both Sunnis and Shi'ahs in rejecting the opinion that Islam needed a permanent and visible head; and, while they allowed that an Imam or spiritual leader might lawfully be appointed when circumstances so required, they insisted that he should be specially elected in every case, and that the Imamate or Khalifate should not be hereditary. They agreed with the Sunnis in regarding the Khalifahs Abu Bakr and 'Umr as regularly appointed, and therefore as entitled to respect ; but they were at variance with both Sunnis and Shi'ahs in their repudiation of all the later Khalifahs as usurpers. These were the original opinions of the Ibadhis, and they have been maintained without change to the present day. The Ibadhiyah are a denomination by themselves and must not be confounded with Muhammadan or quasi-Muhammadan sects such as the Isma^iliyah, Murjiyah, Mu'tazilah, Qaramitah, Sifatiyah, etc.; the mere fact that they are neither Sunnis nor Shi'ahs is perhaps principalij accountable for the mistaken opinions on this point that have sometimes been entertained, even among Muhammadans in the Persian Gulf. History of Persistent efforts were made by the Sunni Khalifahs of Islam, during the Ibadhi gome three centuries, to reduce the Ibadhis of ; Oman to subjection an Imamate. conformity ; and in the course of the conflict, probably in the year AcD.^ the Ibadhis proceeded, in accordance with their own tenets, to elect an Imam whose duty it should be to direct their religious, their military, and their political affairs.

Mr. Badger and Colonel R obs in the wi' cited m the footnote on page 2349.2375 B iy ^utawwa^ used apparently in the sense of ' pledged to obedience,'* seems to have been borrowed from the Wahhabis, who applied the term to their propagandists ; but the Mutawi'ah, though they resemble the Wahhabis in proscribing tobacco and requiring the punishment of those who smoke, are genuine and even fanatical Ibadhiyah. The Mutawi ; ah hold that the Khalifah ^Ali was not a Muslim at all, but a Kafir ; and they consider the re -institution of an elective religious Imamate in ^Oman to be neces sary, especially for the purpose of reforming public morals. Two points of morality emphasised by the Mutawi^ah are that marriages should not be contracted without the ceremony of Nikah and that the veiling of women ought to be more rigidly practised. The Mutawi^ah first attracted notice about the year 1841, when Mutawwa' Saijid Hamud of Sohar placed some of their leaders in charge of his movemente principal forts to hold them against the Wahhabis; and again, in 1845, ^0.^037 some of the Mutawi^ah took part in the opposition which was offered to the proceedings of a Wahhabi agent at Baraimi. The revolution of 1868, which carried Saiyid ^Azzan-bin-Qais into power at Masqat, was essentially Mutawwa' in its character; and the fanatical proceedings of tlie sect from 1868 to 1871 are noticed in the history of the ^Oman Sultanate. The short-lived regency of ^Abdul ■'Aziz, in 1875, was distinguished by a Mutawwa' attempt to reform public morals at Masqat; and the rebel attack on Masqat in 1877 was primarily a Mutawwa- 7 enter prise. In 1883 a Mutawwa' rising against the Sultan's authority took place, of which one object was understood to be the supersession of the reigning Sultan by an Imam; and in 1895 the town of Masqat was captured, and for a time held, by the leaders of the Mutawi'ah and their adherents, whose professed purpose it was on this occasion to remove the He facto secular head of the state. In 1903 an actual attempt was made by the Mutawwa' party to set up an Imam in the Eustaq valley, in competition with the ruling Sultan; but the movement collapsed for want of support. The political ambition of individuals, the desire for change, and the hope of booty had probably as much effect in producing these disturbances as any religious motive properly so called. The MutawPah, whose numbers it is impossible to estimate, are most Leaders of numerous in the turbulent district of Sharqiyah, where most of the the Muta- movements above mentioned have originated. Their religious head, until Ms death in 1871, was the priest S a'id-bin-K half an, Khalili, who '* first emerged from obscurity in the Mutawwa' government of the Sohar principality about 1841 and afterwards became the chief adviser of ; Azzan-bin-Qais; and the most influential tribal leader on the Mutawwa' side was Salih-bin-'Ali, head of the Hirth tribe, who took a conspicuous part in all the Mutawwa' movements between 1868 and 1896, in which latter year he was killed. The principal 'Ulama of the Mutawi'ah in 1905 were 'Abdullah-bin-Hamad, Salimi, and Muhammad-bin- Shaikhan, Salimi, both of Sharqiyah; and the place of Salih-bin-'Aliwas ffled by his son 'Isa. /Mutawwa' has also the meaning, in ordinary Arabic, of 'a militarj volunteer.' ' is not quite plain whether the term Mutawwa' is applied to every member of the 8eck here dealt with, or only to the leaders of the same.2376 The Wahhabi denomination of Islam in the Persian Gulf region. m The origin of the Wahhabis or Wahhabijah , the cha racter of their religion, and their political history are sufficiently explained in the historical chapter on Najd, to which the reader may refer; it is therefore unnecessary to dwell here on their principles and position. Confusion at At the present day it is extremely difficult to distioguish, in the the present Deighbourhood of the Persian Gulf, between the Wahhabis proper and Wahhahis 611 some Muhammadans of the Sunni persuasion whose views approximate and Hanbali ver 7 closely to those of the Wahhabis. The Bani Bu'Ali and Bani Sunnis. Rasib tribes of the ''Oman Sultanate appear to be still Wahhabis in the full sense of the word and to call themselves so; but the Ghafiri tribes of Trucial ^Oman in general, who were once undoubtedly Wahhabis, now claim to be Sunnis of the Hanbali sect; and in practice they have declined, and even departed, from the strict Wahhabi standards of conduct. The position of some Bedouin tribes of Eastern Arabia, such as the ^Ajman, Bani Hajir and A1 Morrah, who call themselves Hanabilah, is similarly doubtful. A portion of the Ma^adhid of Qatar have recently become Hanbali Sunnis of a somewhat extreme type, have held close relations with the Wahhabi Amir, and may, perhaps, be reckoned Wahhabis. Absence of We may refer here to the Wahhabi movement which took place connection among Muhammadans in India during the 19th century; by some it has between ^ tbe apparently been assumed to have been instigated from Arabia^ but the Wahhftbis of ev i^ ence available does not favour any such assumption* The those^of an movemer ^ w as initiated by Saiyid Ahmad Shah of the Eai Bareli district, India. who visited Makkah in 1822 and there imbibed the principles of the Wahhabi faith, yet without, so far as is known, forming any permanent connection with the Wahhabis of Arabia. Another prominent figure among the Indian Wahhabis was Titu Miyan, who visited Makkah ^ 1822 and returned to India in 1827^ but did not apparently^ enter into any relations with Najd. Saiyid Ahmad Shah declared a Jihad or holy war against the Sikhs in ] 826 and maintained it, not altogether ^ withou success, until his death, at the hands of the Sikhs, in 1831. Since then the Wahhabis have occasionally given trouble to the British Governmen in India, especially between the years 1860 and 1870, upon the Nortn* Western Frontier and in the Lower Provinces ; but it does not appe ar that they have ever maintained any correspondence with Central Arawa, that they themselves have ever visited Najd, or that any Wahna ^ propagandists have been sent from Arabia to India.t The movement, i * It is therefore to be feared that Sir Alfred Lyall 's stirring poem, A ^ - in Lower^ Bengal (1864), must be regarded as devoid of historical fonn ^ The exordium of the preacher,—' Men of the Indian cities who cull on the name '--seeiris inappropriate also in the mouth of an Arabian Wahhabi, ^l 10 necessarily reject the intercession of any prophet or saint. t The records of the Foreign Department of the Government of IndiM|f J 1 J Criminal Intelligence Department and of the local Governments of the ' atl 3 aD '.

By 1865, at latest, it had degenerated into mere political sedition against the established Government. The Kh5jah sect in the Persian Qnlf region. We come next to the Khojahs, a body of Muhammadans whose religious headquarters are at the present time in India, but of whom a number reside in the Persian Gulf. The true Khojahs have been authoritatively defined'* as follows : ' a sect of people whose ancestors were Hindus in origin, which was converted to and has throughout abided in the faith of the Shi^ah Imami Isma/ilis, and which has always been and still is bound by ties of spiritual allegiance to the hereditary Imams of the Isma^ilis.'' This definition of the Khojahs, however, as we shall see further on, does not apply in its entirety to all who at the present day are styled Khojahs in the Persian Gulf. A short notice of the Isma'ili division of the Shi^ah denomination of Islam will make the term Khojah more intelligible. It has been shown, in an earlier paragraph, that ordinary or Ithnah- Origin and 'Ashari Shi'ahs believe twelve ' revealed ' Imams to have presided over the principle^ of Muhammadan faith, of whom the last, the Mahdi, will one day re-appear. Ism5 At an early period, a body of Shi'ahs who had arrived at a different theory regarding the succession of the Imams separated themselves from the majority ; these were the Isma/ilis or Isma'iliyah axUcU ^ I , who held that the seventh Imam was not Musa-al-Kadhim, but another son of Ja^far-as-Sadiq, whose name was Isma/il and who predeceased his father. The theological doctrines of the Isma/ilis differed in a great degree from those held by other Shi^ahs, and they were ^ even subversive of some of the leading principles of I slain as originally inculcated by Muhammad; but on this aspect of the question we cannot dwell. In the opinion of the Isma/ilis, a line of ' unrevealed ' Imams, who have continued ever after in an unbroken succession, descended from their seventh Imam. The political history of the Isma'ilis is very remarkable. From Hi s tory of 1090 to 12-58 A. D. their leaders occupied the mountain stronghold of the Isma'ilis. Alamut in northern Persia, whence they waged war against the more orthodox Muhammadan powers adjoining them and replied fo perse cution by ' assassination/'— a word that actually owes its origin to * This was the definition finally reached by Sir J; Arnould in a monumental judgment cited in the footnote to the title of the present Appendix.^3?8 their proceedings during this period.* In 1258 A.D. their political power was broken by the capture and destruction of Alamut; but they continued to exist as a religious sect under the direction of their ' unrevealed )y Imams^ the descendants or supposed descen dants of the last a revealed^ Imam, Ismail. About the beginning of the 16th century of the Christian era the Isma^iliyah ceased to be persecuted in Persia; and early in the 19th century their head enjoyed great political influence. At length in 1838 the Isma^ili Imam of the day, Muhammad Husain, Husaini, otherwise Agha Khan, revolted against the Persian Government and seized the province of Kirman^ where he had many adherents ; but he was defeated by the Shah and retired to India, where, after 1845, he generally resided at Bombay. His grandson. His Highness Sultan Muhammad, Husaini, also styled Agha Khan, is the present head of the Isma/iliyah throughout the world and has his head-quarters at Bombay, Origin and The present Khojah sect are descended from Hindus of Sind and PJ^cipl®. 8 ^ Kach, who, in the 15th century of the Christian era, were converted from e ojahs. Hinduism to the Isma/ili form of the Shi^ah faith. r lhe Isma/ili Dai or missionary by whom the ancestors of the Khojahs were converted was one Pir Sadr-ud-Din, who is said to have been sent from Khurasan to India by Shah Islam Shah, an ancestor of the present Agha Khan and sixteenth from him in the ascending line; the tomb of this missionary is shown at Uch in the Bahawalpur State in the Panjab. From its original seat in Sind and Kach the Khojah faith spread, or was carried by emigrants, to Gujarat, Bombay, East Africa and the shores of the Persian Gulf; but this process cannot be assigned to any particular period. The Khojahs differ to some extent from the Isma/ilis of Persia and otter countries in ritual, and possibly in dogma ; but those among them who adhere to their original tenets still regard the Agha Khan as the unre vealed Imam and as the head of their faith. The word ' Khojah in the present application, is understood to mean ' honourable or worshipful convert 3 \ Becent his* The principal event in the recent history of the Khojahs is a schisin, Tn?' 0 i!b ecame serious after the settlement of the Agha Khan in India in 0 ] a s - 1845 ; it culminated in 1862 in the institution of legal proceedings by a dissident minority against the Agha Khan, whose headship and authority over the Khojah sect they denied. The suit was finally decided on the 12th of November 1866 by Sir Joseph Arnould, a judge of the Bombay High Court; in his judgment the rights claimed by the Agha Khan were affirmed, and his opponents were declared to have been lawfully expelled from the Khojah community. The dissident or unorthodox Khojahs of Bombay, who contended—in opposition to all histonca evidence—that the Khojahs were properly Sunnis and not Shl ; ahs ; on ceasing to be Imami Isma^ilis apparently became ordinary Sunni Muhammadans. * Assassin ' is from Hashishin 3 meaning those who committed poli- Hasluh^ 6 ' 8 at the 0rder 0f tlie Um ^ ]i ' chief llnde1 ' the influei]ce of the drUgf22 2379 At the present time the persons styled Khojahs in the Gulfs of The Khajabs Persia and 'Oman, who are all of Indian origin or extraction, number 0 . f 1&gt;0r ' nearly 2,000 souls and are distributed as follows ;— Territorial divieio n.

Wherever they are settled, they are generally accompanied by their wives and children. The schism which occurred among the Khojahs of Bombay was Recent reproduced among those of the Persian Gulf; and it is stated that, at, the present time, not more than half of those in the Gulf are Imamiyah s and acknowledge the authority of the Agha Khan. In 1885 the p er8 i an Q u if # Government of India declined to interfere on behalf of the Imami Khojahs of Matrah, who had been dispossessed of the original Khojah Jama'at or holy place; they were perhaps entitled to possession under the Bombay High Court decision of 1866, but on the other hand they numbered only 20 families, they had not been excluded from worship ing in the old building, they possessed a new building of their own, and they had delayed greatly in bringing their claim. In 1886 a complaint was receiv ed by the Government of Bombay that some Khojah women at Matrah were being ill-treated by their husbands in order to make them join in the ^2380 secession from the Agha Khan, and that these proceedings were counten anced by the Sultan of ^Oman; enquiry, however, showed tiiat the complaint referred to the case of one Khojah woman only, who was a subject of the Sultan, and the matter was dropped. At Gwadar the Khojahs are said to be still for the most part or altogether Agha Khanis^ that is, Imamiyah; but at Matrah, which is their principal place, it is reported that nearly all have seceded and have become ordinary Ithnah-'Ashari Shi^ahs, not Sunnis as at Bombay. The seceders at Matrah have^preserved some of their ancient social and other usages, and the term Khojah continues to be applied to them, there and elsewhere, on account of their antecedents. In ; Oman, as a whole, about 90 per cent, of the Khojahs are now Ithnah-Asha-riyah. The Agha Khan main tains regular communication, through agents in the Gulf, with the Khojahs who have remained faithful to him ; and at one period he paid a visit to Gwadar every second year in order that they might have a convenient opportunity of paying him their respects. Non -Khojah It should be added that the Agha Khan has many thousands of IsmB'ilis in non-Khojah adherents in Eastern and South-Eastern Persia, who Uie Persian 0 p en }y profess to be Shi^ahs of the orthodox type but in secret cherish the Isma/ili doctrines; their conduct in this respect is in accordance &lt;vith the Isma^ili principle of Takiyah or mental reservation^ under which they are permitted, for the purpose of escaping persecution, to conceal and even to disguise their religion. Some of these non- Khojah Isma'iliyah possibly reside in districts of the Gulf littoral ; but nothing can be stated as to their location and numbers. The village of Baghu near Bandar ; Abbas is the property of His Highness the Agha Khan. Other Muhammadan or quasi-Muhammadan denominations and sects in tne Persian Gulf region. Zikrii. There are a few of the sect called Zikri tSjfo in the district attached to Gwadar town; these are the Baluchis of Nigwar, wbo number only 600 to 600 souls. The Zikri sect is said to have origin ated in India about three hundred years ago. The Zikns are reported to believe that, on the expiration of a thousand yeais from the Hijrah, the dispensation of Muhammad came to an end an was superseded by the dispensation of the Mahdi, who appeared a Attock on the Indus and subsequently vanished somewhere in Makran. Zikr, from which the Zikris take their name, consists in pronouncing certain formulas six times in the day instead of saying the regular Muhammadan prayers, and is believed by them to have been prescribe by the Mahdi; they read the Quran and call themselves Muhammadan 8 ; but they reject the Ramazan fast, and they hold that 'Ushr should e paid at the rate of one-tenth instead of Zakat at the rate of one-fortietn. The Zikris are most numerous in the eastern parts of Makran, and they kave at Kaij a place of pilgrimage which they call Koh-i-Murad2381 It is reported that there are no Sufis in the districts of the Persian Sufis and coasts but that a few members of the sect of Ni^mat 'Ali are met with at Bushehr. According'to information supplied by His Highness the Agha Khan in Bakttsia. 1901, some itinerant preachers, belonging to a pantheistic (sic) Muham- madan order known as the Baktasis, who were said to be numerous in European and Asiatic Turkey, had in recent years visited northern Central Arabia; but they had obtained little success among the people and were suspected to be in reality political emissaries of the Porte.

On the Persian coast Jews are not numerous, there being only a handful at Muhammareh, about 600 at Bushehr, and a few in the Gabandi vallev. In all there are probably less than 62,000 Jews in the Persian Gulf region. Jews have of recent years been badly treated in Persia, and a number have emigrated to other countries. There are three Jewish shrines of importance in the countries adjacent to the Persian Gulf, namely the tombs of Ezekiel and Ezra in Turkish ^Iraq at Kifl and ^Azair respec- tively, of which the former is greatly venerated and is the scene of many Jewish burials, and the tomb of Daniel near Shush in ''Arabistan.2382 Oriental Christians in the Persian Gulf region. Oriental Christians in the Persian Gulf region number less than 11,000 altogether; and hardly any are found outside of Turkish ; Iraq, there being only about 40 in Bahrain a score at Bushehr, and a very- few at Muhammareh. In 'Iraq they are scarcely found except in towns, and are distributed as follows : — Baghdad Qadha ...... 8,000 Basrah do 2,500 Nasinyah do. . . . . . . A few. The divisions and ecclesiastical organisation of the Christians of ; Iraq are described in the article on Baghdad City in the Geographical Volume of this Gazetteer. Sabians in the Persian Gulf region. The Geographical Volume of this Gazetteer contains a general article on the Sabians or Subba of ' Iraq and Arabistan,* beyond the borders of which two provinces none are found in the Persian (jult region ; a slight account of their religion, leading characteristics and distri bution will be found in the same place. There are over 2 ,000 persons o this persuasion in 9 Iraq and about 400 in 'Arabistan in all about 2,500 souls; but their numbers appear to be decreasing. The Saluba, a wandering tribe or race who are found all over Central Arabia, in Kuwai territory, and also in Turkish ' Iraq, but whose number is altogether un certain, have a religion which is believed to present features of resem blance to that of the Sabians.

Total over 1,029 These numbers do not include the military guards of the British political officials, which sometimes consist, in whole or in part, of Hindus. Political difficulties arising out of the Hindu religion are not common. In 1885, however, a Brahman boy went on board the Sultan of Zanzibar's steamer &lt;&lt;: Avoca^ at Masqat, intending to become a Muhammadan and to vist Makkah; the Hindu community at Masqat were indignant, but the other pilgrims on the ship, mostly well-armed Afghans and Persians, refused to surrender the intending 1 proselyte. H. M. S. ' Banger/' however, detained the 'Avoca^ until the boy was given up, when he renounced the idea of becoming a Muhammadan. In the same year a Hindu Faqir at Bandar ; Abbas was converted to Islam and was accused of having stolen valuables from the Hindu temple at that place; the conduct of the Persian authorities in the case was unsatisfactory, but they ultimately caused the Faqir to be removed from Bandar 'Abbas. In 1904 some money was extorted from Hindus at Abu Dhabi as the price of permission to dispose of the body of a Hindu, who had died there, in the usual way ; but the amount was subsequently refunded on a requisition from the Resident. Babis in the Persian Qulf region. The new Babi religion in Persia, of which the institution may be dated from 1844, the year in which Mirza 'Ali Muhammad, common y known as the Bab, declared his mission, does not appear to have ob™ 111 ed as yet much hold on the coast of the Persian Gulf, notwithstan in r that the Bab visited Bushehr at an early stage in his public career. It ^ reported that at Bushehr there were in 19n5 only about 50 Babis, ^ ^ employed in the Customs Department or in the Artillery ; a very e others were found at the ports of Bandar 'Abbas and Lingeh, and P oSS1 at Shehr-i- Viran in the Llravi district; but at Baghdad, which was headquarters of the Babi religion from 1853 to 1864, it did no^ appear that there are any. It is, probable, however, that Babis a ie be found in places where their existence has not been ascertained.160 :'?2S' 2385 dwell on the principles of Babiism would be out of place here, as the religion is not at present of any political importance within the geographic al limits ^ of ^ our enquiry ; but the fact may be recalled, as being of general significance, that on the 15th of August 1852 an unsuccess ful attempt on the life of Nasir-ud-Din Shah was made by Babi ♦ fanatics. The actual assassination of that monarch on the 1st May 1896, however, does not appear to have been the work of a Babi, though the contrary has been alleged. External religious movements affecting the Persian Gulf. In 1883-84 numerous copies of proclamations issued in the name TheMahdiof of Muhammad Ahmad, the soi disant Mahdi of the Egyptian Sudan, t ^ e Egyptian were brought across Arabia to the Persian Gulf and attracted much ?oo J attention there ; but the sympathy shown for his cause appeared to be political and not religious in its character. In 1884-85 some Dibai men left for the Red Sea, giving out that they would join the Mahdi (&lt; if he were shown to be a prophet,' and a Mnlla at Sharjah began to interest himself on behalf of the impostor, making it necessary for the British authorities to address a warning to the Shaikh of Sharjah. This appears to be the only external religious movement that has made any stir in the Persian Gulf in recent years, Pan-Islamic ideas seem to have obtained little or no hold in the The Pan- eonntries of the Persian Gulf. The Arabic newspapers of Egypt, which I s l am i c are the chief organs of Pan-Islamism, are read by a few persons at movernent • Kuwait, Masqat, etc.; but it does not appear that any local Pan-Islamic propaganda exists. In Persia, and wherever the people are Shfahs, the pretensions of the Sultan of Turkey to the headship of the Muhammadan world are rejected and even ridiculed; and a somewhat similar obstacle is present in the ^Oman Sultanate, where the bulk of the population belong to the Ibadhi sect. Ignorance and indifferance are also, in the Persian Gulf, serious factors in preventing the progress of the movement, * The principal sources o£ information in regard to the Babis are the writings ot Professor E. G, Browne of Cambridge and of the authors whom he quotes.2386 APPENDIX WESTERN CHRISTIANITY AND MISSIONS IN THE PERSIAN GULF REGION.* The subject of Oriental Christianity is dealt with in Appendix H j here we shall treat only of Western Christianity and its missions in the Persian Gulf region. The missions in question belong, at the present time, to two classes only; these are, first, Roman Catholic missions, of which the aim is now principally if not exclusively pastoral, and secondly Protestant missions, of which the sole object is the extension of Christianity. The Eoman Catholic missions, which are much the older, may be taken first. History of Roman Catholic missions in the Persian Gulf region,1 The history of Roman Catholic missions in the countries bordering on the Persian Gulf can be given most conveniently m the torm 01 chronology. 1604. Three Carmelite Fathers, named Paul-Simon, Jean Th a dee and Vincent, left Rome for Persia in the twofold character of missionaries and ambassadors from Pope Clement to Shah ^ Abbas the Great. • „( 1608. A convent was founded at Isfahan 'under t e an p Shah 'Abbas the Great,' who provided a site. 1612. A Carmelite convent was founded on the island ot &gt; then a Portuguese possession, by Father Vincent, Carmelite.

After the loss of Hormuz by the Portuguese^ a Carmelite convent was founded at Basrah by Father Basil de St. V ran^is,* a Portuguese Carmelite, (under orders from the Archbishop of Goa to attempt the conversion of the Sabians of Basrah, a task that had previously been undertaken without success by Father Matthew, an Englishman, and by Father Nicholas de la Vega, who erected a house and chapel at Basrah with the consent of the Pasha). 1624. A Carmelite foundation came into existence at Shiraz under Father Jean Thadee and Father Peter of St. Thomas ; and in ^ the same year Gativanda, the mother of a Georgian Prince, was, after an imprisonment lasting 11 years, cruelly put to death at ShTraz for refusing to abjure Christianity. 1625. (The Carmelites of the Persian Mission and the Augustines of Goa^ had each an establishment at Basrah and received subsidies from the Turkish Pasha ; there was some friction between the two. On the 13th of April a church built by the Carmelites was dedicated with much ceremony; the Pasha sent a guard of honour of 500 men, and himself afterwards visited the building, where he gave a money donation,) 1632. The first Latin Bishop of Isfahan received consecration, in the person of Mgr. Jean Thadee, a Spanish Carmelite. 1638. The first Bishop of Babylon {i.e., of Baghdad) was appointed, viz., Mgr. Bernard du Val, a French Carmelite. 1639. The traveller Tavernier arrived at Basrah bringing news of the birth of Louis XIV, and the happy event was celebrated by the Carmelite fathers there with religious observances and rejoicings. 1662. There was printed at Rome a celebrated work by Father Ignace de Jesus, Carmelite missionary at Basrah, entitled Aarratio originis, rituum, et errorum Chnstianorum Sancti Johannis, {i,e., of the Sabians). 1666. Father Ange de St, Joseph, a French Carmelite of Toulouse, missionary to Shiraz and Basrah, became celebrated through out the country for his skill in medicine, especially by his successful cure of a severe wound sustained by a Persian General, ^Ali, in the defence of Basrah against the Turks. In recognition of his services the Persian Governor of Aocording to Manuel de Faria j Sousa, however, the founders were Father ohn de los Santos and Joseph, of the Presentation; the Pasha gave them power ^er all the Christians, Chaldaeans, Nestorians, and Jews; and many Chaldaeans were baptised. Basrah was after this the chief religious station of the' Portuguese ; jnd their success, for a time, in converting even Muhammadans was such as to cause onsternation among the Qadhis. Father Basil, who apparently succeeded the iginal founders, had much success among the Sabians, and was able, after only six onths study, to preach in Persian, Arabic, and Turkish.2388 Basrah, before burning tbe rest of tlie town to prevent its falling into tbe hands of the Turks, allowed the Carmelites of Basrah to remove to Rig 1 in the Persian Gulf, taking with them their library and their apparatus of worship. 1 Father Ange subsequently published at Paris, in 1680, a i TJiarmacopea Persica, ex idiomate persico in latinum transla- tnm, which was commended by several members of the Faculty of Medicine at Paris. 1669. Three ships of the ^ Noble Compagnie Fran9aise^ visited 1 Basrah; on board one of them, ' La Force,' an Armenian j interpreter, died, having received the sacrament. 1C70. A Carmelite foundation was opened at Kung near Lingeh, j and another at Bander ; Abbas, by Father Mattbieu de St. I Joseph; of this Father, who also was a skilful physician, Father Ange above mentioned wrote in his Pkarmacopea ' ad stuporem usque medeeinae scrutatus est arcana.' 1674. Tn July of this year the Carmelites of Basrah entertained a Mgr. Paites de la Croix, a son of the King's Interpreter' 1 and a friend of the French Carmelites in Persia. This j gentleman wrote a little later ' J'ay este temoin pendant les deux annees que j^ay demeure ^ Ispahan des conversions j qu'a faites le R. P. Ange de St. Joseph, Carme Dechausse, Tholosain, a quoi la medicine qu'il y exer9ait charitablement et religieusement n J a pas peu contribue.' 1675. Francis Pecquet, ex-Consul of France at A.leppo, having | entered sacred orders,was appointed Bishop oi Babylon ant j French Consul for Persia; he took up his residence a I Hamadan. 1678. Father Ange de St. Joseph went to Constantinople, where he presented three Sabian manuscripts to the Marquis e Nointel, the French Ambassador to the Porte ; these weie i sent to the Bibliotheque de Colbert and are now m e I Bibliotheque National. 1679. By a decree of Louis XIV the Superior of the Carmelites o ^ Basrah was appointed ex-officio French Consul at ^ sr ' to whatever nationality he might himself belong. n this decree, between 1679 and 1739, eleven fathers charged the duties of Consul at Basrah. 1680. In this year Father Frussanus de Jesus and Brother CyK were at Bandar 'Abbas. 1682. In this year Father Jean-Frangois was at Lingeh or Kung- 1684. In this year Father Ludovic de Ste. Therese was at ?Wra®; and an ex-Patriarch of the Gregorian Armenians at ^ on tinople, who had been converted to Roman CatnoJicis the Fathers at Basrah, died at the latter place an buried in the Roman Catholic cemetery. &gt; - 1686. On the 8rd of June Father Agathange, a Carmelite ^ taine and very zealous missionary, died at Bandai of a beat stroke.2389 1691. father Charles died of plague at Basrah. 1694. Father Klie de St Albert, a Belgian Carmelite of Antwerp, was appointed Bishop of Isfahan by Pope Clement X. 1698. Father Pierre-Paul, a Barefoot Carmelite of a noble Neapo litan family, was appointed Vicar Apostolic of India and Ambassador on the part of the Pope^ the Emperor of the Romans, and the Venetian Republic to the Shah of Persia. 1699. The prelate of Isfahan, appointed in 1694- - see above, was sent by Shah Husain as an Ambassador to the Pope and the Emperor. 1700. In this year Father Basile de St. Charles was prior of the convent at Isfahan. 1703. The Carmelites were expelled from Basrah by a fanatical lurkish Governor; but 18 months later they returned, to the great joy of their flock. 1708. Mgr. iMaurice de Ste. Therese, a Barefoot Carmelite, Vicar Apostolic in the territories of the Great Mughal, passed through Basrah on his way to India; he founded a Carmelite mission at Bombay, which has since been replaced bv one of the Jesuits. 1712, Mgr. Gatien de Galliezan, coadjutor of the Bishop of Babylon, died at Isfahan. 1721. The present Carmelite mission at Baghdad was founded by father Joseph-Marie de Jesus, a Burgundian. (This Father had the rank of Pro-Vicar Apostolic; his life, while at Baghdad, was repeatedly in danger from the Muham- madans and the Gregorian Armenians.* In 1721 there was a Portuguese church at Kung, and one or two priests resided there who subsisted on alms and perquisites.) 1728. Father Urbain de Ste. Elisee, as Provincial Yicar of Persia and Arabia, visited the convents in both countries. 1733. Father Jean-Joseph de St. Antoine, of Avignon, died at Bandar 'Abbas. 1735.

(In February of this year, when the traveller Niebuhr visited Bushehr, he found two monks there, one of whom styled himself Bishop of Isfahan ^ this latter was Mgr.

He remarked on the presence at Baghdad, in 1766, of two Carmelite monks, one of whom was Bishop of Babylon • and he observed that their principal function was ,not to convert JMuhammadans to Christianity, but to induce Armenians _ to acknowledge the Pope, that they had succeeded in bringing most of the Oriental Christians at Baghdad into the Roman communion, and that the Nestorians had been obliged to surrender their church to the Latins.) 1773. The plague, which raged in this year throughout Turkish 'Iraq, carried off in a few months no less than eight Romau Catholic missionaries; viz., two at Basrah, four at Baghdad (including Mgr. Baillet, the Bishop), one at Mardin, and one at Diyarbakr. Mgr. Charles de St. Conrad, Barefoot Carmelite, Vicar- Apostolic in the territories of the Grand M ughal, paid a canonical visit to the Roman Catholic missions in Turkish 'Iraq. In this year Father Aloys-Marie, Barefoot Carmelite, became Vicar-General for Persia. 1782. (Mgr.

At this time the Carmelites had several stations in the northern part of western India, forming a mission known as the Great Mughal's Mission, with headquarters at Surat. 1794. The Abbe de Beauchamp left Baghdad, and Father Fulgence, a Barefoot Carmelite, became Vicar-Apostolic of Baghdad 1774. 1780,2392 (The Abbe de Beauchamp was among tlie learned men who subsequently accompanied Bonaparte to Egypt.)

Present position of the Eoman Catholic missions in the Persian Gulf region. At the present day the Roman Catholic Church has only three permanent stations in the countries with which we are concerned^ one at Baghdad^ one at ^Amarah, and one at Basrah ; but arrangements exis for occasional ministrations at Bushehr. The staff and Work of the missions are chiefly concentrated at Baghdad. Baghdad. At Baghdad there are about 1^200 Roman Catholics^ 1,400 Syrian Catholics, 1,000 Catholic Armenians, and 2,000 Chaldaean Catholics, the first three of these bodies are subject in common to the Arch bis op of Babylon and therefore form, in a sense, a religious unit; but eac i o them has its separate church. The Chaldaean Catholics are an indepen dent communion. The Roman Catholic institutions at Baghdad are described in detail below; the church and principal school were as rebuilt in 1868 under Father Marie-Joseph de Jesus. Basrah. There are at Basrah a church and a school under the direction o Carmelite Fathers. The Christians of Basrah number about 2,50 , the proportion belonging or attached to the Roman communion a not been ascertained. Roman Catholic educational and charitable institutions ^ Baghdad:* The following is an account of the Roman Catholic institutions mail tained at Baghdad, about 190B, chiefly by the Fathers of the Carme mission ; it is taken from materials supplied by one of themselves. High school The Carmelites had at Baghdad a high school for boys, , or bo ys. day pupils and boarders. The teaching staff in this school consisteo^ * The information given below relates to the year 1905.2393 five Carmelite Fathers, of whom three were French, one was Irish, and one was a Baghdadi; of two Marist brothers, both of whom were French; and of seven lay teachers, all Baghdadis. In 1905 there were on the rolls of the school 119 Chaldaeans, 33 Syrians, 23 Armenians, and 3 Greeks, all Turkish subjects; also 7 French, 4 Austrian, 2 Italian, 1 English, 1 Jewish and 3 Turkish boys, Roman Catholics : in all 196 boys. In 1904 there were three Muhammadan pupils, but the Inspector of Public Institution objected to Muhammadan boys attending a Christian school, and their parents were obliged to withdraw them. The curriculum was the same as in French Lycees, with modifications suitable to the East. The I' rench and Arabic languages were obligatory, and instruction was given exclusively through the medium of these j but English and Turkish were taught to the pupils of the three highest classes. The hostel for boarders was under the management of the Carmelite Fathers and was attached to their mission house; it was intended for the sons of parents who do not live in Baghdad. In 1905 there were six boarders, and the boarding fee was £T2 per mensem. The school ' received an annual subsidy from the French Government, and the remainder of its revenue was derived from pupils'' fees and from the dona tions of individuals; but only about one-fourth of the pupils paid full fees, one-fourth being free and the remainder paying half fees. In 1904 the total income of the school was £4*25 and the expenditure £449; the Fathers who taught in the school had no salaries. The majority of the pupils on leaving school become clerks in mercantile houses; and many of them, after some years, are able to start in business on their own account. Some join departments of the Turkish administra tion, such as Public Debt, Customs, etc.; some enter the Ottoman Bank; some proceed to Bairut or Europe to study medicine; some embrace the ecclesiasfcical state; others learn handicrafts. Evening classes are held by the Carmelite Fathers for former pupils who wish to continue their studies in history, French literature, English, physics, and mathema tics; and sometimes as many as twenty youths take advantage of these courses. A school for Catholic girls was founded at Baghdad in 1877 ; it belongs to the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Babylon, His Grace the girls. Most Reverend John Drure, C.D.; and it is worked by Sisters of the Presentation of the Third Order of St. Dominic (Tours). The staff consisted in 1905 of six sisters, all French, and five lay teachers. The school was attended by about 340 girls, all natives of Baghdad, and all Roman Catholics with the exception of one Armenian and one Muham madan. Reading and writing in Arabic, also the rudiments of arith metic, grammar, and geography, were taught in the morning, and needle work, knitting, etc., in the afternoon. French and music were extra subjects; about 40 girls took the former and 30 the latter, and only these paid any school fees. The school received a yearly grant from the French Government, and expenditure not covered by this subsidy was defrayed by the Archbishop of the Diocese. The Sisters, whose work was done entirely gratis^ had daily work classes for former pupils, at which the attendance was about 80 and needle-work, embroidery, etc., were taught. Close to the Carmelite church was a large infant school, into which Infant children of both sexes were received up to the age of seven or eight years, school.2394 School for poor chil dren. Orphanage. Home for the aged and blind. bispensary, The teaching'^ which was entirely free, was conducted by two Sisters and two mistresses; and the number of children was about 250. The Roman Catholics had also a school for poor children; it was in charge of a Carmelite Father, who was assisted by three lay teachers, Baghdadis. The pupils numbered, on the average, about 100; all were Turkish subjects. Reading and writing in Arabic and the elements of arithmetic and geography were taught; the children not only did not pay fees, but were in every case clothed, and in many cases fed also. The expenditure in 1904 was £60, which was met entirely from charitable donations ; and besides this a quantity of food and clothing was con tributed by benefactors. Most of the pupils on leaving become servants ; some learn handi crafts ; and a few find employment in business houses. These was also a Roman Catholic orphanage, into which boys left destitute were received up to the age of eight, and were fed, clothed; and educated until they were able to support themselves. In 1905 there were sixteen inmates of the orphanage, all without parents and absolutely m want. The orphanage was supported by charitable contributions, eked out by means of such expedients as lotteries, penny collections in families, etc. The orphans are taught reading and writing, the rudiments of arithmetic, etc.; and, as soon as they are strong enough, they begin to learn a craft; some become carpenters, others silversmiths, others book-binders, and so on. An institution for the aged and blind was attached to the Carmelite Mission; old men who were poor and feeble were received and cared for till their death, and the blind were taken in and taught reading, writing, basket and mat-making 1 , etc. In 1905 there were fifteen inmates of the institution, the funds at the disposal of the Fathers not admitting ot the reception of a larger number. This home depended entirely on chari table subscriptions. In a house left for the purpose by a deceased Catholic of Baghdad* and a dispensary was maintained by the Carmelite Fathers for the benefit doctor attended for three hours every morning; the sick poor; a consultations and medicine were given gratuitously. About patients visited the dispensary every month. The salary of the and the cost of medicines were met from charitable donations. l.OOU doctor General history of the Protestant missions in the Persian Gulf region, 1811-91.

His ' Journal of a Residence at Bagdad ' con- Baghdad, tains a graphic description of his melancholy experiences in the great 1829. plague there. After this, Bible colporteurs were more than once sent to the Persian Proceedings Gulf by Dr. John Wilson, a missionary of the Church of Scotland at Dr - ^ 0 ^ 11 Bombay, and a scheme for missionary operations, including a mission to the Jews of Basrah, was drawn up; but the Disruption of the Church of Scotland in 1843 prevented the execution of what had been planned. In 1878 the British and Foreign Bible Society sent Anton Gibrail Foundation from Bombay to Baghdad on a colporteur journey ; and about the same ^[. a , ^ iiurc h time Persia and Baghdad were visited by Mr. J. Watt, an agent of the Society, who brought the state of matters there to the notice of the m i gs i on a t Committee. Mr. W att's recommendations were supported by the Baghdad, Rev. R. (now Canon) Bruce, a missionary of the Church Missionary 1880. Society in India; in December 1880, after an exchange of views between the two societies, a Bible depot under Mr. Bruce was opened at Baghdad; and two years later Baghdad was occupied as an outpost of the Church Missionary Society^s Persian Mission. In 1886^ at the instance of the Committee of the Church Missionary Tour of Gene- Society, who desired information in regard to the openings for ral F. T. missionary effort in Arabia, a long journey of enquiry was undertaken by Ha1 ^' 1886, General F. T. Haig. After devoting his attention chiefly to the parts adjoining the Red Sea, General Haig returned home by way of the Persian Gulf, Basrah, Baghdad, and Syria, and reported on the whole situation; but, though operations on the western side of Arabia followed, it does not appear that in the Persian Gulf his tour bad any direct results. In 1888 an appeal was issued by Alexander Mackay, a missionary Mission of in Uganda^ for the establishment of a mission at Masqat, which he Bishop regarded as 'in more senses than one the key to Central Africa ^ and in Fr ^ ch 1891, as will be related below, Bishop French of Lahore, an English churchman, influenced by this appeal, endeavoured unassisted to found a mission at Masqat. In the meantime, on the 1st of August 1889, an a Arabian Mission ^ Establish- had been set on foot in America by Mr. James Cantine and ment of the Mr. Samuel M. Zwemer, students, and Dr. J. G. Lansing, Professor of ^ b ^ n th ^ ls - Hebrew and Arabic, in the Theological Seminary of the Reformed 1891. (Dutch) Church at New Brunswick, New Jersey, one of the Presbyte rian Churches of America; and in 1891 the first representative of this Mission arrived in the Persian Gulf. The proceedings of the American and English missionaries on the Spot since their arrival demand short separate notices* Tlie American Arabian Mission. the Arabian Mission, instituted as described in 1889, was managed History of S't first by the founders with the assistance of a Committee of A dvice the Arabian selected from among contributors. This arrangement continued in force Mission in2396 until 1894^ when the Mission was transferred to the management and care of the Board of Foreign Missions of the Reformed Churchy its distinct existence as a corporation beings however, preserved. The first agents of the Mission to reach the Gulf were the Rev. J. Cantine and the Rev. S. Zwemer^ two of the original founders, who before going there examined, with reference to their suitability for mission work, various places in the western and southern districts of Arabia. Mr. Cantine eventually sailed from Aden for Masqat towards the end of May 1891, and, after spending a fortnight at that port and visiting Bahrain and other places in the Gulf, made a tour to Basrah and Baghdad. A little later he was joined by Mr, S. Zwemer, and Basrah was selected as the local headquarters of the Mission. Persistent hostility had to be encountered from the first on the part of the local Turkish authorities; and the early experiences of the mission were by no means fortunate. On the 24th of June 1892 Kamil ^Abdul Masih, a Syrian Christian who had attached himself to the Mission, died in suspicions circumstances indicative of poisoning; colporteurs of the Mission were arrested; the Bible shop was sealed up and various books were confiscated; a guard was placed at the door of the house occupied by the missionaries; and a petition for their expulsion was sent to the Porte. In the course of the year, however, arrangements were successfully made for carrying on the work of the British and Foreign Bible Society in the region occupied by the Mission ; and, in December 1892, the Mission itself was reinforced by the arrival of the Rev. Peter J. Zwemer, a brother of the Rev. S. Zwemer, from America. In 1893 a second station was established in Bahrain in charge of Mr. P. Zwemer; and, after the lirst difficulties had been surmounted, the situation in those islands appeared not unpromising. Before the end ^ of the year over 100 portions of Scripture had been sold, and the first visit of a Christian missionary to Hasa on the adjoining mainland had been paid. At Basrah evangelistic work and the circulation of the Scriptures made progress; but no medical work could be undertaken, as there was no doctor. In 1894 Dr. James T. Wyckoff, a medical missionary, was added to the staff at Basrah ; but after a very short space of time, on a visit to Bahrain, he became seriously ill and was obliged to return to America, leaving the Mission again without any physician. Meanwhile several journeys of exploration were made by the Rev. P. Zwemer in &gt; tne •'Oman Sultanate; and it was decided, on the information so obtained, that Masqat should be occupied by him as a third station. In 1895 Mr. Cantine went on furlough to America, and M r * S. Zwemer, who had meanwhile assumed charge of the station in Bahrau 1 ) temporarily took his place at Basrah. The staff was strengthened by the addition of a medical missionary at Basrah in the person of Dr. H- i*- Lankford Worrall. At the end of the year an out-station was opened a the town of ''Amarah on the Tigris, In 1896 work among Muhammadan women was begun by Mrs. S- Zwemer at Basrah and was continued by her in Bahrain and Qatu. Distant tours, extending to Wadi Samail, Rnstaq, and Jabai Akhdhar, were made in 'Oman by Mr. P. Zwemer and his colporteurs; and bysi 2397 one of the latter more than 100 portions of Scripture were sold in Tmcial ^Oman. In February 1897, soon after the return of Mr. Cantine from 1897. America, Mr. and Mrs. S. Zwemer proceeded on leave, and work in Bahrain came to a standstill j but in the same year ^ood progress was made at Masqat, where Mr. P. Zwemer took charge of eighteen rescued African slave boys, opened a school, and began the printing of religious tracts. The medical relief provided at Basrah attracted many hearers j and Dr. orrall founded a new out-station at Nasiriyah on the Euphrates. At the end of the year the Rev. F. J, Barny was added to the staff of the Mission. In 1898 the number of the missionaries was considerably increased 1898. by the arrival of the Rev. Gr. E. Stone and Miss M. Rice after the middle of the year, and of Dr. S. J. Thoms and Dr. Marion W. Thoms in December. Meanwhile, however, the death occurred in America of Mr. P # Zwemer, whose health had been undermined by his labours and experiences in ^Oman. On the 26th of June 1899 Mr. Stone, who had arrived in the 1899. country in the previous year, died of heat apoplexy at Barkah. The mortality among members of the Mission continued to be 1905-06. deplorable ; in Bahrain Mrs. Thoms died in April 1905 and Mrs. Ben nett in January 1906. In 1906 the principal stations of the Mission were still Bahrain, Stations and Basrah, and Masqat, and the out-stations at ^Amarah and Nasiriyah had staff of the been maintained. The total staff in January of that year amounted to Arabian 5 clergymen, 3 medical men, 3 lady workers, 5 married ladies, and 18 ■Jg 1 Qg 10n, native assistants. The seat of the Mission in Bahrain is Manamah town. The regular Institutions staff in Bahrain consisted in 1906 of two missionaries, four lady and work in missionaries, and seven Arabic-speaking assistants; but there were Bahrain, generally present, in addition to these, a few recently arrived missionaries engaged in the study of the language. Evangelistic work was conducted from the Manamah station, not only in the Bahrain islands, but also on the coasts of Hasa and Trucial ; Oman. The principal feature of the Mission in Bahrain was the a Mason Memorial Hospital' of 21 beds; it consisted of a main ward, two special wards, and a female ward, and bad a well-equipped operating room. The superior medical staff of the Hospital comprised an American doctor, an American lady doctor, an American trained nurse, and three assistants; the building was the property of the Mission. In 1905 there wore 14,013 out-patients and in-patients, and 87 operations were performed. Advice and Medicine were given only to those attending (but not necessarily parti cipating in) the morning prayers with which the work of each day was begun. A day school for boys and another for girls were maintained ; the instruction in these was given partly by the missionaries and partly by native teachers; and the number of enrolled pupils in 1905 was 85. There was also a d^pot for the sale of the Bible and other Christian literature printed in the languages of the Gulf. A Mission building, the property of the Mission, was under construction in 1906.2398 Institutions The Mission premises at Basrah were situated on the south side of and work at &gt; ^g^ar creek above Muqam; and a small hospital and a free dispen- Basmh. were ^aj^tained in a rented house near the English club. There was also a school; but the Turkish authorities did not recognise its existence and had endeavoured to compel its closure. Work at No hospital or other public institution belonging to the Mission Masqat. existed at Masqat. The staff there consisted of only one missionary, who had his residence in the Dallalin suburb and made it his duty to cultivate the friendship of influential Arab residents and visitors and with their assistance to travel from time to time in the interior. When the missionary himself was at Masqat, a native Christian colporteur was generally engaged in distributing Christian literature in one of the more settled districts of the ^Oman Sultanate. General work The objects of the Arabian Mission are primarily evangelistic j but a Kf • r q eS J llt ^ missionaries also attach much importance to their medical work; 1905 116 0 2 an( ^ Bahrain, at Basrah, and on tours made from those centres, over 30,000 sick persons are annually treated by the medical representatives of the Mission. With the assistance of the British and Foreign and of the American Bible Society, circulation of the Scriptures is vigorously carried on ; and the number of Christian publications sold in the year increased steadily from 620 in 1892 to over 4,000 in 1905. Tours by the missionaries to all places within reach of their headquarters are a special feature in the methods of the Arabian Mission. It is admi e that baptisms of native converts have not been numerous; but a num er of persons who have come in contact with the missionaries ave confessed to the truth of Christianity and are reported to be living a Christian life, and the way is thus being prepared for future genera ions of workers. ^ ^ i, a V n Political Political complications arising out of the work of the^ Ara ia P° sit T u-Mission have been singularly few,—a happy circumstance which mus MiKsion^ lan be attributed chiefly to the discretion of the missionaries themse ves, and none have been serious. Some slight difficulties occuue ^ Bahrain after 1899, which are noticed in the history of that P rinc ^ pality; but they were easily surmounted, and they have not ie ^ iu . 1( j . The relations of the missionaries with the British Political an o rl . have been uniformly friendly and even cordial; and the suppoi o ^ latter has not been withheld in any case in which it could • granted.

Missions and missionaries of the Church of England. The Church A mission of the Church Missionary Society, as already Missionary was f 0UIlc [ e( j Baghdad in 1880. It still exists ; and the number 0 * . tants at Baghdad, for whom no other church than that of the Mis®2399 exists, is now about 200. Much good work is done bj the Society's mission at Hospital at Baghdad ; in 1904 there were 17 beds and on the average Baghdad about 12 in-patients and 70 out-patients were daily under treatment, besides whom 1,076 persons were attended at their houses; those who could not afford to pay were treated gratis. The staff consisted of a doctor of the Society, a dispenser, two dressers, and two servants ; and a lady, who was a trained hospital nurse, was giving her services to the institu tion. As the doctor, who received only a small salary from the Society, transferred all the fees which he earned to the Hospital, that institution, of which the expenditure was about £300 a year, actually cost nothing to the Society ; and the lady nursed services, it should be mentioned, were also given gratuitously. The work, however, was carried on under serious financial restrictions. After 40 years of missionary and religious work in India, the French 'i Right Rev. Thomas Valpy French, Bishop of Lahore, resigned his mission to bishopric to travel among Arabic-speaking peoples with a view to the ^ as&lt; l a t- propagation of Christianity among them. His attention was directed to Masqat by the appeal of Mr. Mackay of Uganda, to which we have already referred, and in 1891 he proceeded to Masqat, having met in the Eed Sea, as a fellow-traveller, Mr. S. Zwemer of the Arabian Mission, whose ultimate destination was at that time still unsettled. It was Bishop French's intention to start a mission at Masqat on his own account, in the hope that it might be taken over afterwards by the Church Missionary Society. He arrived at Masqat in February 1891, began work in the town, and had made arrangements for a journey into the interior; but, having received a sunstroke in travelling by boat from Masqat to Matrah, he died at the former place on the 14th of May 1891 at the age of 66 years. He was buried in the European cemetery at Shaikh Jabir, a small cove adjoining Masqat town on the east, but separated from it by rocky hills and practically inaccessible otherwise than by sea. Bishop French's grave was visited in December 1900 by the Right Rev. G. A. Lefroy, Bishop of Lahore, by whom the Consecration Service was read at the Shaikh Jabir cemetery and also at another cemetery near the American mission house, then recently granted by the Sultan of 'Oman for the burial of native Christians ; but no English successor to the veteran pioneer has as yet made his appearance at Masqat. The members of the Arabian Mission, on their arrival at Basrah in Other &lt; Eng- 1891, found there a Dr. M. Eustace, who was engaged in dispensary llsh mlsslon8 work among the poor; he co-operated cordially with them until his transfer to the hospital of the Church Mission^ Society at Quetta. In the allocation of missionary spheres among Christian bodies, the M akran and Persian coasts have fallen to the Church Missionary Society; but the Society has not as yet found means to occupy these districts effectively.2400 APPENDIX THE TELEGRAPHS OF THE PERSIAN GULF IN THEIR RELATION TO THE TELEGRAPH SYSTEMS OF PERSIA AND TURKEY.* Origin of the Persian Gulf Telegraphs. Interest of Britain and Turkey in promoting telegraphic communica tion in the Middle East. Dr. 0' Shaughnes- sy's scheme. The Junction Company's scheme, 1856. The inception of the Persian Gulf Telegraphs^ which formed from the first links in an intercontinental chain^ was dictated not by local interests, but by broad considerations of national advantage. The Crimean war of 1853-56 brought home to the Porte the slowness of communication between Constantinople and the outlying provinces of the Turkish Empire, while the Mutiny of 1857 taught the British Government a similar lesson in regard to India, and two of the principal Governments concerned were thus predisposed in favour of projects conducing to greater rapidity of communication between West and East. Perhaps the first practical scheme for establishing telegraphic communi cation between Europe and Asia was that of Dr. (afterwards Sir W.) (yShaughnessy, Superintendent of Electric Telegraphs in India, who proposed that a cable should be laid from Karachi to Masqat, Basidu, and finally Qurnah, a place at the junction of the Tigris and Euphrates ; that it should be continued by means of a subfluvial line in the bed of the Tigris from Qurnah to Baghdad ; and that the remaining distance from Baghdad to Scutari should be spanned by an ordinary land line. IJr. CyShaughnessy also suggested that a branch line should be carried ioi some distance along the bottom of the Euphrates, and thence, subter- raneously, across the desert to Suwaidiyah on the Syrian coast. A little later, in August 1856, the European and Indian Junction Telegraph Company applied to the Court of Directors of the East India * The principal authorities dealing specifically with the jsubject of the Persu Gulf Telegraphs are the following ; Col. Sir P. J. Goldsmid's Telegraph and l rc ! v J ' 1874 ; Mr. J. Possmann's Official History of the Persian Gulf Telegraph a &gt; 1889 ; Col. H. A.

Some negotiations with the Turkish Government ensued, but the Porte were averse from granting a concession to a commercial company; instead they gave assur ances,—-which they had neither the means nor the intention of fulfilling— that a line of the sort in question would be constructed by Turkey out of her own resources. Meanwhile work was in progress upon a rival route between Europe and India. In 1859, Egypt being already in telegraphic communication with Europe via Tripoli, Malta and Italy, a cable to India was laid by way of the Ked Sea, which, starting from Suez, touched at Sawakin, Aden, Hallamyah (an island of the KuriaMuria group) and Masqat, and finally reached India at Cape Monze (Has Munazi) near Karachi. This enterprise was undertaken by the Red Sea and India Telegraph Company on a guarantee of 4^ per cent, from the British Government. The cable was opened on the 1st of November 1859; but the Sawakin-Aden section failed in February, and the Aden-Karachi section in May 1860 ; and the whole enterprise was abandoned. The failure of the cable was due to the insufficiency of the marine surveys by which its course was determined, to its having been too tightly laid, and to technical faults in construction, for the art of manufacturing and laying submarine cables was then still in its infancy. One consequence of this fiasco was to deter investors from the support of projects that involved sea cables of any considerable length; and a further result was to concentrate general attention, for a time, on land routes towards the Persian Gulf which might contribute towards establishing reliable communication with India. Extensive enquiries and surveys followed with a view to the establishment of a Persian Gulf line. iigui and failure of the first lied Sea cable, 1859-60, Establishment of telegraphic communication between Europe and Baghdad, 1857-1861. In 1857 the Turkish Government, while maintaining their objections to the construction of telegraphs in Turkish Arabia by a foreign company, consented that the work should be carried out by officers of the British Government on the behalf and at the expense of the Porte; but only upon a distinct understanding that the whole line in Turkish territory should, when completed, be placed under the management of the Ottoman Department of Telegraphs. In pursuance of this arrangement the servi ces of Lieutenant-Colonel Biddulph, R.A., were lent to the Turkish Gov- crnment; in August 1858 work between Baghdad and Scutari was com menced under his orders, and by October 1859 some 325 miles of the line Jad been completed. About this time ill-health and Turkish obstruction brought about Colonel Biddulph-'s resignation ; but work on the line was ^ntinued by the remainder of the party, of whom a proportion were retired non-commissioned officers of the Royal Artillery. Anglo n Turkish Agreement, 1857.2402 Negotiations were continued meanwhile at Constantinople witli the object, on the part of the British Government, of ensuring the ultimate efficiency of the line as a means of communication between England and India. In September 1860 a draft Convention embodying the result of the discussions that had passed was prepared, but it was not signed; and the position remained unregulated by any formal agreement until 1864. In the draft Convention a wire for Indian traffic along the whole length of the Turkish line from a point on the Austrian frontier to a point on or near the Persian Gulf was conceded to the British Government, and the term of the whole arrangement was fixed at 50 years. A principal cause of the non'execution of the agreement was a difference of opinion which arose between the contracting powers in regard to the line between Baghdad and the Persian Gulf: this the Porte contended should be subfluvial for the sake of security from damage by Arab tribes, while the British Government preferred an aerial line as being less expensive to construct and more easy to maintain. In the meantime construction of the northern section of the linej between Baghdad and Constantinople, had been steadily proceeding; and by June 1861 through communication had been opened between the two cities. In the spring of 1861 Colonel A. B. Kemball, British Political Besident at Baghdad, marched from Constantinople to Baghdad, inspect ing by the way the entire line of telegraph between those places; an his report fully justified the adoption of the aerial system in this region. Extension of the line in Turkish Iraq from Baghdad to Fao and from Baghdad to Khanaqin, 1861-65. The work of connecting Baghdad with the Persian Gulf, which was th ^ next step towards the establishment of direct communication between^ rope and India, was not immediately undertaken, as it was u y icer ^ a i 11 v^ e route would be the best, below Baghdad, for a great intercontinen a ^ v follow. At one time it was considered that a line through Turkish ei , from Baghdad to the Gulf would be exposed to perpetual interrup i ^ ^ the Arabs through whose country it passed ; and the authorities we ] posed, in case it should be decided to rely on a single ^ route, to l? re p . | c ]j reaching the Gulf by means of a detour through Persia. Colone Stewart, however, whose views with reference to the scheme as ^ ^ad will be described further on, regarded a direct line from Baghdad o ^ of the Persian Gulf as an indispensable part of any general sys ® recommended that the political arranaements with the tribes n 1 | ve fl ^Iraq should be made through British officers. It was ultimate y i ^ ^ to construct a line connecting Baghdad with the head^of ^ i-j mee tft way of Basrah, and it was arranged that this land ^ ne ?f 0U - Qulf- cable from India which it had been decided to lay in the rersw In the spring of 1863 Colonel Kemball, by arrangement2403 Pasha, ihe^ Turkish Wali, made a reconnaissance from Baghdad to Basrah, which resulted in a decision that the telegraph should run from Baghdad to Hillah, follow the left bank of the Euphrates from Hillah to Qurnah, and at Qurnah cross to the right bank of the Shatt-al-'Arab. A more convenient route could have been obtained by crossing and recros- sing the Euphrates at more than one point between Hillah and Qurnah ; but the Turkish officials were anxious to remove the line as far as possible out of the reach of the Arab tribes upon the right bank, and th« route adopted was a concession to their fears. The total length of the line from Baghdad to Basrah was estimated at 313 miles. The Porte were unwilling that this Baghdad-Basrah line should be constructed by British agency and professed readiness to construct it themselves. Eventually the discussions resulted in an engagement, dated the 20th October 1863, between Great Britain and Turkey, by which the Ottoman Government undertook to construct an aerial line at their own expense from Baghdad to Basrah and another from Baghdad to Khana- qin near the Persian frontier, while the Government of India on their part assumed the responsibility of carrying a submarine cable to Basrah or to some point near the mouth of the ^Shatt-al-' Arab to meet the Baghdad-Basrah land line. It was further agreed that the necessary materials and a skilled staif for the construction of the land line should be supplied by the Government of India, and that the * cost of the materials should be repaid by the Ottoman Government out of the Turkish share of the revenue from, messages sent by either line from India to Europe. The Khanaqm line was not to be commenced until through communication by Basrah had been established, and certain principles were to be followed in the distribution of long-distance traffic between the two lines. Two of the clauses had for their object to expedite the completion of the Baghdad-Basrah line and of the sub marine cable. A basis of operations having thus been arranged, construction was begun at the Baghdad end in November 1863 ; and in the same month, on the arrival of Lieutenant Murdoch Smith and a detachment of Boyal Engineers at Basrah together with the necessary stores, work commenced at the southern end also. The difficulties encountered proved, in spite of contrary anticipations, to be of a physical rather than of a political nature; and by the end of March 1864 the wire from Fao-- the^ point finally selected for the landing of the cable, which was now rapidly approaching it—had reached Qurnah. Above this, in conse quence of trouble between the Turks and various Arab tribes, chiefly the Muntafik, there remained for some time a gap of 1?0 miles; but on the ^7th of January 1865 the two sections were successfully joined up in the neighbourhood of Qurnah, so linking Fao to Constantinople. The clause in the Anglo-Turkish engagement of 1863 relating to the post ponement of the Baghdad-Khanaqm line appears to have been dis regarded, for we find that it was actually in operation by the 13th October 1864, if not at an even earlier date.

J unction of telegraph at Fao. Conditions intended to secure efficiency. Matters of account and representa tion. In connection with the Turkish land lines it only remains to summarise a Telegraphic Convention concluded between the British and Turkish Governments on the 3rd of September 186^ largely through the exertions of Colonel P. Stewart at Constantinople. This document, which superseded the Agreement of 1863^ provided for the construction and maintenance by the Indian and Ottoman Governments respectively^ at their own expense, of (1) a submarine cable from British India to Fao, touching at Bushehr and (2) of land lines from Baghdad to connect with the cable at Fao and with the Persian telegraph system at Khanaqm. At Fao a joint Anglo-Turkish office was to be established under the general control of the Ottoman administration; but the British section of the office was to be exempt from Turkish interference in internal matters. The British staff, the strength of which was not to exceed 50_, were to inhabit the same building as the Turkish; but the space and apparatus allotted to the two were to remain entirely distinct, and telegrams for transmission were to be exchanged through a window. The general expenses of the station were to be divided equally between the two governments, and the Britisli staff were to be paid by the British Government. To ensure punctuality in working, the Turkish Government was to establish a permanent service, i.e.j a continuous night and day service^ at Baghdad and Fao and at a majority of the stations on the line between Constantinople and Fao ; and a staff possessing a knowledge of the English language was to be appointed to these. An office devoted exclusively to the transmission of Indian messages was to be establislied at Constantinople and manned by employes thoroughly conversant with English. One wire between Constantinople and Fao was to be reserved for Indian traffic; and, in case of a breakdown, its place was to he temporarily taken by the other, subject to certain conditions. Messages to and from India might be forwarded indifferently by the Fao or the Khanaqm route. Tariff and methods of account were fixed by the Convention; and the Indian^ Government were empowered to appoint a delegate to reside at Constantinople, the Turkish Government on its part being similai y entitled to a representative at the headquarters of the Indian Telegraphs, a stipulation under which the Indo-European Telegraph Departmen- now maintain an Agent at Constantinople, but of which the Porte have not taken advantage'^. 1869 ^ en the traffic accounts with the Turkish Government were setUed at Constantinople, the British telegraph representative there was a Com London 61, ' a in 4.

It is now necessary to revert to a period immediately preceding the Negotiations extension of the Turkish line from Baghdad to the Gulf. The desira- with the bility of a double connection between the Persian Gulf cable and P er8 i an Baghdad had been foreseen ; and negotiations with the aim of providing an auxiliary land line through Persia were set on foot in 1861^ but at first remained unsuccessful. In May 186^ Colonel P. Stewart^ already mentioned; who was now in charge of the whole Indo-European scheme in so far as it depended on the British Government^ arrived at Tehran to assist in the discussions; and^ though nothing was settled during his visit to the Persian capital^ which lasted only a month, a report by him gave clearness and force to the project of duplication. The most serious obstacle was the attitude of the Persian Government^ who at one time appeared disposed to support the scheme, but early in 1862 began to vacillate and to exhibit, probably under Russian influence, a preference for a line to run from Tehran to .Easht and be connected with the tele graphic system of European Russia. The British Legation at Tehran did not however relax their efforts; and in December 1862, Mr. Eastwick was successful in obtaining a draft convention which provided for the construction of a line from Bushehr via Tehran to Khanaqm on the Turkish frontier. The arrangement thus reached was embodied in a formal engagement, Anglo- which was accepted by the British Government on the 6th of February Persian 1863. The chief provisions of this document were that the line in Agreement question should be constructed without delay by the British on behalf ^^and rUC of the Persian Government; that the British Government should be management, entitled to make use of the line through the Persian Telegraph officers 6tli Febrnary on payment of the ordinary rates; that the materials required to be 18^3. imported should be supplied by the British to the Persian Government at reasonable prices; that the new line should be placed under the superin tendence of a British Engineer officer to be paid by the British Govern ment ; and that the Persian authorities should assist in the work of construction by supplying such materials as were locally available. The engagement also included certain stipulations of which the object was to give tho Persian Government a voice in matters of expenditure and account. The materials purchased in England were to be paid for by the Persian Government within a period of 5 years, reckoned frcm the date of delivery at the Persian frontier, by annual instalments. Preparations were immediately made for the despatch from England Field ^ the stores to be imported, and for the collection in Persia of the materials locally obtainable, chiefly timber. The distance fron Khanaqm ' ' Tehran to Bushehr was estimated at 1,10^ miles and materials were in the first instance provided for a single line 1,200 miles in length. The operations were placed in charge of Lieutenant Champain, R.E., assisted by a staff of civilian experts and of officers, non-commissioned 0 fficers and men of the Royal Engineers; Lieutenant Champain received2406 the local rank of Major^ and his headquarters were fixed at Tehran, where he arrived on the 20th of October 1863. On the 17th of Novem ber he reached Bushehr to meet a construction party sent from England; and shortly afterwards work was commenced in five sections, two of which lay between Tehran and Khanaqin and three between Tehran and Bushehr. Extraordinary difficulties, due to the apathy and in some places to the opposition of the local Persian authorities, were experienced in obtaining labour and local materials; and Major Champain was driven to take the extreme step of authorising* his principal snbordinatee to make payments out of their own funds for necessary labour and stores in supplying which the Persian officials had made default. But the ardour and determination of the British constructors were such as to surmount all obstacles, and on the 26th of September 1864 the whole line stood completed between Bushehr and Khanaqm It was not however opened for traffic until April 1865. The troubles, however, with which the new telegraph had to contend, were as yet by no means at an end. In particular the junction of the Persian and Turkish systems in the neighbourhood of Khanaqin was attended by serious embarrassment. From the first the Ottoman Government had regarded with no friendly eye the participation of Persia in the great Indo-European telegraph undertaking and its advantages; but to outward seeming the Turkish objections had been overcome when the Anglo-Turkish engagement of October 1863 was signed, providing for the construction of the Baghdad-Khanaqin line and for the distribution of through traffic between it and the Baghdad-Basrah line. Persia too, as we have seen, inclined to a scheme for separate communication with Europe ty way of Russia; but, in adhering to the engagement of February 1*^; she had apparently abandoned her opposition to the rival project. Botn powers, moreover, by means of a Turko-Persian treaty dated the 28th of November 1863, had agreed to the execution of the Khanaqin schema with or without modification, and had amicably regulated a number of the details connected with it. When however the junction a Khanaqin became an all but accomplished fact, both states, and specially Persia, evinced a disposition to withdraw from their engagements; an the difficulty was accentuated by a dispute which arose as to i e ownership of the country, and consequently as to the control oi ^ 0 telegraph line, between Khanaqin in Turkish ; Iraq and Qal'eh-^fea z in Persia. Discussions between JVlirza Husain Khan, Persian Envoy Extraordinary to the Porte, who happened to be passing throng Baghdad, and Namiq Pasha, Wali of Baghdad, resulted in a settlement of the question, and a junction was effected in October i ^ at the point agreed on between these two authorities; shortly a^ wards, however, the Governor of Kirmanshah, under .orders Tehran, again destroyed communication by causing the line to e at che point of junction. At length Colonel Kemball, ^the Resident at Baghdad, suggested a happy solution of the . ron ■ j difficulty; it consisted in the use, within the limits of the ^ tract, of alternate iron and wooden poles, the former of the pa employed in Turkish 'Iraq and the latter of the type identified ^^56 2407 the Persian telegraphs. By the end of January 1865 direct commun5^ cation had been established between Tehran and Baghdad; but the Turkish operators at first refused to receive messages coming from the Persian side. On the Tehran-Bushehr section the working of the new line was for some months obstructed^, and at one time altogether prevented^ by the opposition of Persian officialdom. The Persian Minister of Public Works at Tehran caused an instrument at Shiraz which was under the control of British operators to be disconnected in order to prevent their holding communication with Bushehr^ and on a protest being made by Major Champain, the British Director^ against the issue of such orders without any reference to himself, the wire between Shiraz and Bushehr was actually cut under the orders of the Minister^ and at Isfahan the Persian authorities attempted to take forcible possession of the apparatus in charge of the British employes at that place. The Director thereupon ordered the removal of the instruments from Shiraz and Isfahan^ caused those at Tehran to be disconnected^ and referred the whole dispute for diplomatic settlement. The result was satisfactory. The Persian Government apologised for the action of their officials at Isfahan_, and agreed that, while the Persian Minister of Public W orks should continue to be regarded as the head of al] telegraphs in Persia^ he should issue no instructions affecting the Tehran-Bushehr and Tehran-Khanaqin lines without the cognisance and consent of the British Director. It was arranged that from the date of resumption of communication with India the control of the telegraph offices and the working of the lines should remain in the tands of the British staff for a period of 5 months^ on the expiration of which it should be transferred to the Persian staff ; only one British Engineer officer and two assistants being thereafter retained at Tehran^ in a consultative capacity^ for a farther period of 10 months. The political difficulties were thus finally removed; but it was now found thai, in the interval during which communication between Shiraz and Bushehr had been suspended^ very serious damage had been done to that section of the line by villagers and travellers^ and by the Iliyat (or nomadic Persian tribes) in migrating from their summer seats in the hills to their winter quarters near the coast. Over a space of 20 miles between Shiraz and the Kutal-i-Dukhtar the line had been almost totally destroyed; many of the poles had been removed and used for firewood; the wire itself had been cut into pieces or thrown down; and out of BOO consecutive insulators only 20 remained intact. Part of the damage was attributed to the misbehaviour and bad example of a Kashkai chief named 'Ali Khan Baig, who himself broke an insulator by a shot from his gun. The Persian Government^ whose misunderstanding with the British telegraph officials had by this time been adjusted^ ordered the condign punishment of the offenders ; and ttie measures taken resulted in the arrest of ; Ali Khan Baig, who was kept in durance for two months and was not released until he jiad disgorged 1/J00 Tumans by way of fine and ) ^500 Tumans more in bribes to the persons employed for his punishment. Before this salutary example had been made., however ; the amount of damage done Friction with the Persian Government, 1864-65. Wanton mischief by nomads, 1864-65.2408 to the line had been nearly doubled^ and the Shaikh of Chah Kutah had destroyed^ or permitted to be destroyed, some 15 miles of the line— the mischief in this case extending to a point only 5 miles from the town of Bushehr. The work of repairing the damaged line was arduous, as the country was rugged and some of the spans were very long; but communication between Shiraz and Bushehr was restored by the middle of March 1865, after the interruption—due at first to the interference of the Persian Government and subsequently to the mischief done by the nomads—had lasted for five months. The Shah was now thoroughly interested in the success of the telegraph, and on the 21st of January 1865 he had personally visited the telegraph office at Tehran, where he remained for two hours conversing over the wires with the Governors of Shiraz, Isfahan, Kirmanshah, Hamadan, Kashan and Qum; he expressed himself as pleased with the arrangements made and impatient to be able to communicate with Europe and India. The Tehran-Bushehr line however continues, even at the present day, to suffer in an extraordinary degree from wilful damage; and in the year 1904-05 no less than 536 cases of wanton mischief were reported. Connection of the Turkish and Persian lines with the Indian system by way of the Gulf, 1863-68. The Rev. Mr. Badger's scheme, 1860-61. Colonel Stewart 's sclieme, 1862. The history of the principal and most striking section of the great Indo-European line of telegraph yet remains to be traced. Without it the Turkish and Persian sections would have remained mere provincial telegraphs, without general importance, and its construction was a necessary part of the Indo-European programme; but its commencement was postponed until the actual progress of the land lines in Turkey and Persia and the removal of political obstacles tad reached a point such as to make ultimate success appear certain, 'ne work in the Persian Gu]/ was one of great magnitude, but the difficulties to be overcome were here almost exclusively of a materia and mechanical nature. In 1861 the mode of connecting the Turkish line to Europe— when it should have been finished—with the Indian telegraphic system was already under consideration. Under instructions from Government a scheme for an aerial line from Karachi to Basrah had been propounde in 1860 by that versatile scholar, the Eev. G. P. Badger; and when his project was referred for opinion to the Commissioner in Siud an ^ to the British political representatives at Kalat, Masqat and Bush 6 11 three out of those four authorities pronounced in favour of its adoption. In 1861 Mr. Badger was deputed to enquire into the political sta us of Makran; but in the end his scheme was found to involve gr ea political difficulties and was therefore set aside. In 1862 the general conduct and control of the Indo -Euiopean telegraph operations were entrusted to Lieutenant -Colonel Pa -tncKy ? s&lt;r? 2409 p Stewart, an officer of the Bengal Engineers, at the time only thirty years of age, who thus became the first Director-in-Chief of the Indo- European Telegraph Department. The nebulous alternatives which he found under consideration were by him rapidly brought to a focus. A scheme which had found favour with a committee appointed to examine it, for establishing communication through the Gulf by means of a series of short submarine cables laid from island to island, did not commend itself to Colonel Stewart He had no difficulty in deciding that from Karachi to some point in Makran communication should in the first instance be established by land line ; but the choice between a land line and a submarine cable in the section between Makran and the head of the Gulf presented greater difficulties, largely on account of the risk inseparable from cables at the stage which the science of submarine telegraphy had then reached. From the first Colonel Stewart recognised and emphasized the desirability of duplicating the entire Indo-European system as a safeguard against interruptions. His final recommendations made to the Secretary of State for India were in favour of erecting a land Hue from Karachi to Gwadar or some point further westward in Makran, and of laying a cable thence to Eao, which he had selected as a more suitable landing place than Kuwait, the point originally proposed. Colonel Stewart added a recommendation that the section between Karachi and Gwadar should be duplicated from the commencement by means of a submarine cable. Colonel Stewart's proposals having been approved, the construction of the Karachi-Gwadar land line was taken in hand, under political arrangements concluded in 186with the Khan of Kalat, the Jam of Las Bailah, and the chiefs of Pasni and Kaij by Major F. Goldsmid, Assistant Commissioner in Sind, which had been confirmed by the Grovernment of India. Despite great physical and climatic difficulties this section, begun before the end of 1862, was completed in May 1863 under the direction of Mr. H. I. Walton, in the form of a single-wire line. The construction parties aggregated 25 Europeans and about 600 natives ; and water for man and beast was so scarce that ablutions had sometimes to be prohibited, and guards with drawn swords posted even over dirty pools. In 1863 preparations were made for laying the cable from Gwadar to Fao. The sea route from Gwadar to Jashk had been exhaustively surveyed by Lieutenant Stiffe, I.N., under the orders of the Grovernment of India in the years preceding 1863 ; and at the beginning of 1863 the bottoms from Jashk to Fao, and especially the marine approach to Fao, were surveyed by Lieutenant Stiffe in the steamer 'Johnston Castle 93 with reference to their suitability for the reception of the cable. The cable itself, 1250 knots in length, was despatched from England in October 1863 in the sailing-ships ' Marian Moore/' ' Kirkham,' Tweed,' a Assaye ' and ^f Cospatrick/ , while about 35 ttnles of shore-end pieces, more heavily made than the deep-sea sections, Were brought by the ' Amberwitch/' a small steamer which was to be retained permanently in the Gulf for the telegraphic service.

Bright, the celebrated electrical engineer, by Major Goldsmid and by Dr. Esselbach—the last in the Construction of the Karachi- Gwadar land line, 1862-63, Laying of the Gulf cables, 1863-64.2410 Gwadar to Maqlab, February 1864. Delay at Maqlab, February- March 1864. capacity of Chief Electrician^ left Karachi on the 27th of January 186^ on the steamer ' Coromandel ^ of the Bombay Marine, which had been placed at his disposal. On the 4th of February, a shore-end having been landed at Gwadar, active operations commenced; the cable was payed out at the rate of 5 miles an hour from the Kirkham/' towed by the steamer 'Zenobia' and piloted by the Coromandel ^ ; at Ras Maidani the ' RirkhamV' load of cable was exhausted and her place was taken by the ' Marian Moore. ;; Jashk was reached on the 8th of February. The expedition then crossed the Gulf of ''Oman and entered Grhubbat Ghazirah or Malcolm Inlet, where a shore-end was landed on the* 9th of February upon the isthmus of Maqlab, and communication with Jashk was established ; it had originally been intended to locate the station between Gwadar and Bushehr on the island of Larak ; but a site in the neighbourhood of Maqlab had appeared preferable to Colonel Stewart, probably as giving a shorter and more direct line. Thus was completed the first section of the work, which so far had proceeded without a hitch. At this stage a month ; s delay intervened, due to political difficulties with the uncouth Dhahuriyin of the villages adjoining Maqlab. Colonel Disbrowe, Political Agent at Masqat, had visited the^ Malcolm and Elphinstone Inlets in January 1864 and had spent a fortnight in making a reconnaissance of the country and in opening relations with the tribesmen. On the arrival, however, of the telegraph party, it was found that no honest work could be got from the local Arabs at tail rates; their cupidity was intolerable; and disorderly scenes 0 ^ c ^ e between the inhabitants of rival villages, especially of Maqaqah and 11 who were competitors for employment. On the 1 5th of February Coione Disbrowe joined Colonel Stewart at Maqlab, and, after some days spen in fruitless negotiations with the Dhahuriyin, the two officers procee e to Masqat to invoke the good offices of the Sultan of''Oman. There wa some uncertainty as to the jurisdiction in which the district concerne was situated, for some of the natives, repudiating the authority o Sultan, professed to be subjects of the Shaikh of Sharjah, while o claimed absolute independence. After a week^s absence Colonel Stewart and Colonel returned from Masqat on the ' Coromandel.'' The Sultan had assei ^ his claim to Maqlab and the adjoining country in unequivocal ^ ei . inS; ^ had furnished the telegraph party with authority to continue then op ^ tions and to deal with the tribesmen in his name; but material assistance, and the British officers had still to^ rely c on their own prestige and tact for the conclusion of a working al1 ? ment. Meanwhile, however, the Dhahuriyin had grown more accus o to the presence of the construction party, and various preiimm difficulties had gradually settled themselves. A land line was now carried across the narrow Maqlab dividing the head of Malcolm Inlet from that of IChor -ash-Sham Elphinstone Inlet, on which neck of land, had the conduct o Or, perhaps, one the 13th. r^s(f??i 2411 Dliahuriyin been more satisfactory, the telegraph station also would have been erected. A section of cable continued the telegraph from the west shore of the isthmus to a small unnamed island in Elphinstone Inlet, selected for the sake of a security which the mainland did not afford and thenceforth known as ' Telegraph Islet.'' Telegraph rights were conceded to the British Government by the Sultan of 'Oman in two treaties, the first dated 17th November 1864 and the second 19th January 1865 ; they related not only to his posses sions proper in Arabia and Makran, but also to territories which he then beld on lease from the Persian Government. In the former of these treaties the sovereign rights of the Sultan of Masqat over territory traversed by the telegraph were expressly reserved. As the title of Masqat to the isthmus of Maqlab and its neighbourhood was not undisputed, an Agreement for the protection of the telegraph 'in or near ^ their territories was obtained also from the Shaikhs of Trucial 'Oman. On the l^th of March the steamer ' Zenobia ' brought the ' Tweed'' with a heavy cargo of cable into Elphinstone Inlet; and on the 18th, after the ' Tweed^s cable had been connected with the instruments on Telegraph Islet, a start was made for Bushehr, the steamer {f Coromandel^ accompanying. On the morning of the 19fch the ships were abreast of Tunb Island, which lay about 4 miles to the south of them ; a slight detour had been made to avoid a place where the soundings were known to be irregular. At this point the ' Coromandel' was detached to pick up the cable ship ' Assaye,' then anchored off Lingeh, as a portion of her cable was required to complete the distance to Bushehr, and a messenger was sent in a native boat to summon the towing-steamer ' Semiramis ' from Basidu, where she was then coaling. Shatvar islet was passed on the forenoon of the 20th; and on the evening of 21st the vessels had reached a point 35 miles south of Bushehr. The following day was spent in transferring staff and apparatus from the Tweed,^ whose cable was now expended, to the ' Assaye; ' and in the early morning of the 23rd progress was resumed, the time of departure being so arranged as to ensure arrival off Bushehr by daylight. An anchorage 3 miles off Rishehr was reached at 9 a.m . on the 28rd, where, with the able assistance of Colonel Pelly, Resident in the Persian Gulf, the political and other arrangements on shore were completed during the time occupied in landing the cable; the special steamer ' Amber witch ^ conveyed the shore-end of the cable from the anchorage to within quarter of a mile of the beach. On the evening of the 24th of March communication was opened between Rishehr and India. As fair weather prevailed and its duration was uncertain, no time was lost, after reaching Eushehr, in undertaking the continuation to Fao. On the 25th of March 1864, one end of the cable remaining on board the a Assaye ' was landed at Rishehr with the assistance of the 'Amberwitch/' while the steamer Victoria^ proceeded direct to the neighbourhood of Fao carrying Lieutenant Stiffe, I N., who, as already mentioned, had made a special survey of the waters there about a year previously. It would have been a simple matter to carry the cable Telegraph Treaties with Masqat, and Agreement by the Shaikhs of Trucial 'Oman, 1864-65. Laying of the Gulf cables (conti nued), 1864.

This proved to be the most difficult operation in the whole work of laying the cable. The Assayed which had left Eishehr on the af ternoon of the 26th March; arrived soon after dawn on the following day at the entrance of Khor ■'Abdullah and was towed up that inlet paying out her cable in a depth of water considerably greater than would have been obtained had the Shatt-al-^Arab route been adopted. On the evening of the 27th the vessels anchored^ in 5 fathoms, at a point in Khor ''Abdullah due south of Fao. Daylight revealed terra firma at a distance of some 10 miles to the northward^ and subsequent observations showed that 3 or 4 miles of the intervening belt consisted of level, semi-liquid mud to which a further extent of or 2 miles was added at low water^ while off; the foreshore the water was so shallow that not even small boats could approach, in any state of the tide, within half a mile of the uncovered portion. At the first arrival of the vessels the weather was favourable, but before the operations were completed a strong south-east wind arose^ which drove the sea inland for a consider able distance over the fiats and greatly increased the difficulty of the landing operations. On the 28th of March Colonel Stewart, Sir C. Bright and Colonel Goldsmid left Khor ''Abdullah in the ' Victoria and, crossing the bar of the Shatt-al-'Arab, entered the river and steam ed up to Fao where the R.LM.S. 'Comet/' with Mr. Consul Johnstone from Basrah on b oard, was found at anchor. After an inspection of the ground between Fao and K hor ; Abdullah it was decided to dig a trench 2| feet deep from Fao for upwards of 8a miles to the landing place on Khor ; Abdullah and to lay the cable in it. For this purpose the requisite amount of cable was cut into lengths and brought ashore from the ' Comet' at a place on the bank of the Shatt-al-'Arab, a mile to the south of Fao, whence it was dragged by dint of great exertions to the trench that had been prepared. The labourers were Arabs from both sides of the Shatt-al-'Arab, a wild and somewhat unmanageable crew, but under Colonel Goldsmids skilful guidance this portion of the work was completed in ten days between the 30th of March and the 8th of April, the number of the workmen increasing from about 200 at the commencement ot operations to over 350 upon the last day. On the 5th of April a cable was brought ashore from the iC Amberwitch/' lying as close in* shore as she could in Khor ; Abdullah, was carried as far as possible land wards in small boats, and was stretched by manual labour over the re mainder of the distance. The ' Amberwitch ' then steamed off; paying' out the rest of the cable as she went; to the spot where the end of the cable from Bushehr had been dropped by the ' Assaye ; ^ and the two were spliced together. A fault which occurred between Khor 'Abdullah and Biishehr on the 29th of March had been located on the 1st and remedied on the 2nd o2413 my April; and so, on the Sth of April 1864, communicatioa was opened between Fao and India. The gaps, however, which existed in the alter native Turkish and Persian lines in the neighbourhood of Qurnah and Rhanaqm respectively, still prevented direct communication between India and Europe. A cable supplementary to the land line between Gwadar and Karachi was successfully laid under the superintendence of Mr. Webb, between the 28th of April and the 15th of May 1864, from Gwadar to Cape Monze (Ras Munazi), whence a land line, 24 miles in length, had been constructed to Karachi. The cable ships employed on this duty were the &lt;f Assaye ' and u Cospatrick''' , assisted by the steamers a Zenobia ^ Amberwitch ' and ' Sind.^ Here we may add that in November 1864, the cable having been chafed through in rocky ground ofP Cape Monze, the land line was abolished and the cable was carried direct to Manorah , whence it was prolonged by a short land line to the Karachi office; and that finally, in June 1866, this short line was replaced by a harbour cable. The Gulf cable of 1864 was probably one of the best ever manufac tured : its guttapercha was found to be in excellent preservation after 20 years of submersion. Interruptions have been due for the most part to friction on bad ground, to decay of the iron guards, to the attacks of teredos, to stabs of sword-fish and to the bites of other fish, and one was occasioned by the struggles of a whale which became entangled in the cable between Gwadar and Karachi and was drowned. The total cost of this cable was £411,751 or about £358 per nautical mile. Auxiliary cable laid from Gwadar to Karachi, April-May 1864. Quality of the 1864 cable. Completion of the Indo-European system of telegraphs, 1864-65, After finishing his work in the Gulf, Colonel Stewart visited Baghdad in hopes of accelerating the completion of the land line between Basrah and Baghdad, which, as before related, was delayed by political complications; but his visit had no immediate result. Colonel Stewart returned to India from Baghdad in April 1864, and soon afterwards left Bombay for Constantinople, where he arrived in July. He was joined there in August by Colonel F. Ooldsmid, already mentioned, who had come from the Persian Gulf by way of Turkish 'Iraq and Asia M inor, inspecting the Turkish land line by the way. Colonel Stewart remained at Constantinople, engaged in promoting the interests of the Indo-European telegraph, until the end of the year, when he was taken seriously ill. He passed away on the 16th of January 1865 at the early age of 32, worn out by the mental and physical strain of the pre ceding two years and by the effects of numerous illnesses and accidents. Colonel Stewart was an officer who commanded in the highest degree the confidence of his superiors and affectionate loyalty of his subordinates. On the 2 7th of January 1865, or less than a fortnight after Colonel Stewart's death, the Indo-European line was completed and a message Death of Colonel Stewart at Constanti nople, I6th January 1865. Opening of the line, 27th January 1865.2414 Colonel Stewart succeeded by Colonel Goldsmid, 1865. was successfully despatched from the point of final junction, near Qurnah, to England on the one side and to India on the other. In the course of the next month a few teleorams struggled through from India to England, one of which was sent by the Duke of Brabant, then travelling in the East; but the line was handicapped by the inefficiency of the staff on the Turkish and Persian sections; and the wretched state of telegraphic communication between Constantinople and the rest of Europe was^ an additional bar to successful working. At this time a message ordinarily took not less than 5 days to reach London from Calcutta. Colonel Stewart^ when overtaken by illness, was engaged in impressing upon the Ottoman Government the necessity of a double wire for the Indo-European service across the Turkish dominions, and of an improvement of the stafl: employed upon the Turkish sections of the line. On Colonel Stewarts demise Major Champain, British Director of Telegraphs in Persia, succeeded temporarily to the headship of the Indo-European telegraphs; and Major Champain's place at Tehran was taken by^ Captain Murdoch Smith. Major Champain proceeded to Europe via Baghdad and Constantinople and reached London on the 20th of April. A month later Colonel Goldsmid was summoned to England from Constantinople, where he had been employed on telegra phic business for a considerable period beginning before Colon el Stewart's death, and was permanently appointed to the ^Chief Direction of the Government Indo-European Telegraphs ^ in succession to Colonel Stewart, Major Champain thenceforward holding the post of Assistant Director-in-Chief and being in charge of the current duties during Colonel Goldsmid's frequent absences from London. Need for a regular Con vention. Conclusion and terms of the Conven tion, 23rd November 1865. Anglo-Persian Telegraph Convention of 1865 and doubling of the Bushehr-Tehran-Khanaqm wire. The first incident of Colonel Goldsmid's Directorship-in-Chief was his mission to Persia to assist in negotiating a regular Telegraph Con vention. On the one hand, the agreements which governed the situa tion in Persia were of a merely provisional nature, and the Persian Government were displaying some impatience to do away with British agency and control and to assume charge of the entire arrangements; on the other, in view of the unsatisfactory working of the Turkish tele graphs, there was a prospect that part at least of the through traffic might be diverted to the Perso-Russian systems which were now connected at Julfah; and for both of these reasons it was imperative that the telegraphic rights of Britain in Persia should be placed on a clearer and more permanent basis. ^Colonel Goldsmid reached Tehran on the 1st of August 1865, and, during his stay of four months there, a satisfactory Convention was con cluded, which was signed on the 23rd November 1865. This Convention provided for the addition of a second wire on the line connecting Bushehr and Khanaqin vid Tehran upon terms, as regarded2415 the supply o£ imported materials and technical assistance^ similar to those contained in the agreement of 1863. The new wire was to be reserved exclusively for international messages sent in European languages^ and ; should the amount of through traffic at any time exceed its capacity of transmission, the old wire - ordinarily to be used for the internal service of Persia—-might be requisitioned to supplement it. The employment of a British Telegraph Officer with a staff of not more than 50 members, exclusive of families, was sanctioned for the pur pose of opening communication by the new wire and of instructing Persian signallers in telegraphy. A Persian official was to be nominal head of the new, as well as of the older line ; but the authority of the British officer in executive charge was carefully safeguarded in all essential particulars. The line was divided for purposes of protection into six sections, each of which was to be placed in charge of a Yavar with horsemen under his orders ; the Yavar was to comply so far as practicable with the suggestions of the British Telegraph Officer. * Rules were prescribed for the keeping and adjustment of the accounts ; a tariff of rates was fixed ; and it was agreed that, should the receipts in any year exceed the sum of 30,000 Tumans, the surplus should be handed over to the British Government as a contribution to the cost of the establishment paid by them. The working of the line should be governed by the Paris Telegraph Convention of 1865, except in so far as the regulations thereby established might conflict with the customs of Persia, or with the terms of the Convention itself. Finally the Convention was to remain in force for 5 years only from the date on which a telegram was first despatched by the new wire; and it might be terminated even earlier, on its being proved to the satisfaction of the Persian chief of Telegraphs and the British Telegraph Officer, that the Persian staff had become thoroughly proficient in their duties. On the termination of the Convention the new line was to be made over in toto to the Persian Government. The hopes of the British Government, who had aimed at acquiring the Persian sections of the Indo-European line by purchase, were thus dis appointed ; but for immediate and practical purposes something had been gained. On the 2nd of September 1866 the ' Hastings ' carrying the material for the erection of the second wire arrived at Bushehr, and operations were started at once; but, in consequence of the physical and still more of the administrative obstacles by which it was retarded, the work was not finished until the summer of 1867. An instructive commentary uppn the expressed desire of the Persian Government to keep the entire undertaking in their own hands was furnished by the fact that, in the end, the entire current expenses were a defrayed by Her Majesty's Grovernment in the first instance, the amount thus eKpended being ♦ This system may have been tried under the Convention, but it no longer exists, The wires are now (1905) looked after by mounted and unmounted Ghulams, who are specially trained to telegraph work and are altogether under the orders of the British staff.2416 recognised as a debt by the Persian Government to be paid in instal ments or otherwise from the receipts of the international traffic Duplication of the Indo-European line between Gwadar and Bushehr by means of a land line and a cable, 1865-69. Alternative schemes considered. Reasons for The operation of doubling* the means of communication between duplication, Gwadar and Bushehr—the only portion of the line under British con trol which now remained single — was retarded by political difficulties and attended by an extraordinary series of natural mishaps. Attention had been drawn to the unreliability of a single line by a temporary inter ruption of the Gulf Cable in 1865 ; and the necessity of a second cable in order to cope with the increasing traffic had also been felt. It was more over indispensable to prepare for the additional strain about to be thrown on the Persian Gulf lines by the completion of the Indo-European Com pany^ line, to which we shall presently refer. The question of duplication first arose at Tehran during the progress of the negotiations which resulted in the Convention of 1865 ; and Colonel Goldsmid, in leaving the Persian capital for Bombay at the end of the year, arranged to travel by land as far as Gwadar and to make a tele graphic reconnaissance of the country on his way. He was accompanied on this journey by Major Murdoch Smith, who had now permanently suceeded Major Champain as Director of the Indo-European telegraphs in Persia. The two officers journeyed together as far as Kirman, where they separated to meet again at Chahbar, Colonel Goldsmid taking a route by Bampur, and Major Murdoch Smith one by Bandar ; Abbas, No insuperable obstacle to the construction of a telegraph line between Gwadar and Isfahan by either of these routes was found to exist; but it was suggested that a route preferable to either might be found by way of Bandar ^Abbas and Shiraz. No one of these alternatives, however, was destined to be carried into execution ; and, in the end, the object io view was attained by a different means. To assist in the conclusion of a freeh Convention for a telegraph between Gwadar and some point on the Bushehr-Tehran line. Colonel Goldsmid, who had meanwhile returned to England by way of India, was again deputed to Tehran and arrived there in Eebruary 1867. No agree ment with the Persian Government was reached during his stay at Tehran ; but the negotiations continued after his departure for India and thenpe for England ; and eventually, on the 2nd of April 1^68, a Con vention binding the parties for a period of 20 years was signed on be half of Britain and Persia. It provided for the construction and efficient working by the British Government of a land line from Gwadar to a point between Gwadar and Bandar ^Abbas, for the lending by the Persian Government of their good offices and authority in support of the enterprise, and for the annual payment of a sum of 8,000 Tumans by the British to the Persian Government on account of the facilities granted by the latter within Persian territory. It was decided to utilize the Anglo- Persian Convention for execution of the scheme, 2nd April 1868,2417 162 concession thus obtained by constructing a land line from Gwadar to whlch shoul&lt;i be continued by a new cable from Jaehk to Busbebr. Tbe cable required was ordered from England, but delay occurred in Laying of a manufacturing and despatching it; and tbe 'Calcutta' and 'Tweed ' second cable on wbicb it was shipped, were not ready to sail until January 1869. On J he 8th of February 1869 tbe ' Calcutta ' came into collision with a « fi a 0S ehr ' Russian barque off the Lizard and was so severely damaged she was abandoned by her crew and was brought back to Plymouth in a sinking condition The ' Tweed ' was delayed while the ' Calcutta ' was under repair, and the two vessels did not reach Bombay until the 21st of Sep tember 1869 Meanwhile the Peninsular and Oriental Company's stea mer Carnatic, _ carrying the members of the cable-laying staff, was tota y wiecked in the Red Sea; and, though the party escaped with their lives, one of their number, Mr. Latimer Clark, met with a severe injury and all their instruments and papers were lost. A start was finally made from Bombay on the 19th of October 1869, the 'Tweed ' being- towed by the British India Company's steamer 'Dacca,' and tbe Lalcutta by the Bombay Marine steamer ' Earl Canning.' The expedmon was headed by Major Champain, Assistant Director-in- X !l' w l 1 l 0 1 was accompanied by Lieutenant Stiffeand Mr. Latimer Clark. On the »7tn of October one end of the ' Tweed^scable was brought into an office which—as will subsequently be explained—had been opened at Jashk in 1868 ; and by the night of the 29th all the cable on board the ' Tweed ^ had been submerged and had completed the line to a point nearly opposite Qais island. The ' Calcutta' was then brought up irom Lingeh^ and operations were resumed under favourable conditions on the 31st. But the ill-fortune which clung to the second Gulf cable was not yet at an end, and on the 1st of November the 'Dacca/-' Calcutta and u Amberwitch' were struck by a sudden squall and were for some time in difficulties; a steam cutter was lost, the crew how- cver being saved ; and a steam barge which accompanied the ships nearly snared the fate of the cutter. On the 2nd of November another violent gale was encountered, and the ' Calcutta' was struck by lightning ut suffered no damage. Before sunset on the 3rd of November ushehr was reached ; and on the 6th communication was established between that place and Jashk. The caWe of 186 9 was of indiarubber and cost £223,194 or about of w9 p er nau ^ ca j m; Q e&lt; It has not resisted decay so well as the gutta- percha cabta of 1864 ; but this is partly due to the accident to the ^ talcutta/ , ia which 7 0 knots of the cable were thrown overboard and amaged, and to its having been laid too tightly. In places where it was fetched, across submarine hollows instead of being allowed to reach the o torn, it became coated with barnacles to the thickness of a man's body WaB eventually ruptured by its own weight. It remains to describe the construction of the land line between Construction wadar and Jashk, which was the necessary complement of the new of a land iRftc r ^ e countr 7 traversed was examined in the winter of a !| v ^ Groldsmid, who came from Europe for the purpose ; jgshkt 1869 n political arrangements for the protection of the line, involving the Bynient of subsidies, were concluded by him with the local chiefs and2418 were approved by the Government of Bombay on the 8th of June 1869. The actual work of construction was carried out in the summer of 1869 by a body of 400 native employes directed by Mr. Walker, a Superinten dent of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, and was completed on the 15th of August. Water was scarce, the heat was terrific, and the natives of the country g-ave some trouble; but the whole distance of about 330 miles was covered in 69 working days. Diversion of the Gwadar-Bushehr cable from Telegraph Islet to Jashk and Hanjam in 1868, Obiects of It is now necessary to revert to an important change in the course the transfer, of the first Gulf cable which had been carried out while the arrange ments for laying the second were in progress. It had early become apparent that Telegraph Islet in Khor-ash-Sham was a most ineligible site for a station, partly on account of the extreme heat to which two members of the small staff succumbed within two years, and partly on account of the hostile attitude of the neighbouring tribesmen, which necessitated the constant presence of a gun-boat of the Bombay Marine, Telegraph Islet was at the time of its abolition an important repeating station, while Gwadar, in consequence of its pestilential climate which rendered the maintenance of a large staff there inadvisable, was used as a station of observation only.* In doing away with the Telegraph Is e station it was found necessary to substitute for it two new offices a Jashk and Hanjam on the opposite side of the Gulf, the office on Hanjam taking the place of Telegraph Islet as a repeating station; these weie required because the instruments of the day were not sufficiently sensi ive to work direct between Jashk and Bushehr, a distance of over 500 kno s. Execution of The difficult task of substituting the new line for the old the work. serious interruption of traffic was carried out with remarkable expe 11 by Mr. Walton, Director of the Persian Gulf Section, assisted by ap am Stiffe, late of the Indian Navy, as engineer. Between the begmmng o October and the end of November 1868 the cable to form the n^ insertion was laid, and the points at which the old cable was to e c _ for junction with it were marked by means of buoys. A small diveifei of the old cable to a temporary office at Jashk, which it 8 ^ distance of only^ miles to seaward, was effected on the 3rd of Pecem * A ' repeating ' or *' translating ' station is an _ office in which mess ^ rentg taken down by clerks and re-transmitted by them, or in which the origin a of electricity act rpon an inatrument called a ' repeater' or ' translator . an a j j n it to transmit onward, automatically, currents similar in direction ^ duration, but greater in strength, than the currents reaching it.

The old cable was then brought to the surface to the eastward of Tunb Island where on the 9th of December it was cut and the portion of it running towards Bushehr connected with the new length. The a Amberwitch ' then hastened to a point off Kuh-i-Mubarak where the other juncture was effected in a similar fashion, traffic having been suspended upon this occasion for 52i hours only, of which 21 were occupied by the Ambermitch in steaming from the one end of the new section to the other. Meanwhile the staff and materials at Telegraph Islet were smartly transferred to Jashk; and by noon on the Uth of December 1868 Jashk was in full communication with Bushehr through the new cable, as well as with India through the old. At first there was no office on Han jam and the two ends of cable landed there were, as a temporary measure, directly united. Subsequently however a station was established at the north end of the island, and the teakwood house which had sheltered the staff at Telegraph Islet was re-erected there. The island of Hanjam was claimed by the Sultan of 'Oman, but the British authorities of the day regarded it as belonging to Persia, and on the 29th of March 1868 an authorisation for the establishment of a telegraph station on Hanjam had been accepted by them from the Persian Government. The boundaries and status of the telegraph station at Jashk were first formally defined in an A greement between the British and Persian Governments dated 25th February 1887, which appears to have been modified, in so far as the boundaries were concerned, by a local arrange ment made in the following year. The telegraph officials and their ' true, positive and salaried servantswere expressly exempted from pay ment of customs dues, whether on goods from abroad or on supplies from the interior, and they were debarred from affording sanctuary to Persian subjects unconnected with them.

Provision of an Indo-European line entirely through Persia, alternative to that through Turkey, 1865-1870. Soon after the establishment of communication between India and Bad working Europe by way of Baghdad it became evident that the working of the ^. e Turkish sections, that is of the lines from Fao to Baghdad, from Khanaqin ^1, 18 to Baghdad and from Baghdad by Constantinople to the Austrian frontier, was hopelessly inefficient and was likely to remain so. In 1866 messages for India sometimes did not reach Constantinople until more than 10 days after their despatch from London ; and a two months' visit paid by Colonel Goldsmid to the Turkish capital in 1866, while on Ms way to Tehran for the second time, was productive of no good results; indeed the working of the Turkish lines was never more deplorable ^ban it became at the end of 1866 and beginning of 1867, and the irregularity of the line was even more fatal to commercial success than 162 A2420 its slowness. Through telegrams were delayed for uncertain periods in the interests of purely local traffic^ and messages frequently arrived in a much mutilated form after being received and retransmitted 12 or 14 times by signallers of different nationalities. These considerations had moved Major Champain, who^ as already mentioned; remained in virtual charge of the Indo-European telegraphs during Colonel Goldsmid's absence from headquarters^ to recommend in 1865 the establishment of an alternative main route through Persia and Russia, and to press in 1867 for direct wires through Turkish territory to facilitate the Indo-European traffic. The Siemens' In the project for a Russo-Persian line between Europe and India ^868 eS8 ^ 0n5 ' , I n( l 0 'European Telegraph Department were supported by the British firm of Messrs. Siemens Brothers, London, who were prepared to take an important share in the enterprise, and the scheme was also favourably regarded by the Russian and Persian authorities ; the Russian system, it should be observed, had been linked with the Indo-European by means of a line between Julfah and Tehran^ constructed by Persia towards the end of 186^ and improved, with the assistance of the Russian govern ment, in 1866. A proposal to develope the Persian line, which was then in a very inefficient state and inferior in working even to the Turkish line, so as to meet the requirements of international traffic, was first broached in 1865, and in 1867 it began to assume practical shape; but the matter was one of some delicacy, and the British Government were anxious not to give umbrage to Turkey, with whom a telegraphic convention had but lately been concluded. In April 1867 ^ Major Champain was authorised to discuss matters at St. Petersburg with the Russian and Persian Directors-General of Telegraphs and with represent atives of the German firm of Siemens and Halske, Berlin and St. Petersburg, and of the Electric and International Telegraph Company ; he did so, and on the 1st of May, only four days after the assembling of the conference, he was able to telegraph to Colone Goldsmid at Tehran—' Affaire Siemens arrangee.'' The agreemen reached was of a most comprehensive kind. It included a concession from the Prussian Government, dated the 26th August 1867, foi^ t e construction and working of telegraph lines from London to the 1 German coast and thence to the Russian frontier; a concession from e Russian Government, dated 1st September 1867, for the Russian of the work; and a concession from the Persian Government, dated 1 January 1868, for the erection and working of a line of telegraph between Julfah on the Russian frontier and Tehran: the concessionaires ^ere Messrs. Siemens Brothers and Messrs. Siemens and Halske.^ The rou e arranged was from London by Lowestoft, Emden, Berlin, ^ ar6 S Odessa, Kertch, Tiflis and Tabriz to Tehran. Twenty-five years was ^ term of each of these three concessions; and in the case of the ^ er ®! a ' grant this period was to be reckoned from the date on which J! 1 was opened for traffic. It is not necessary to notice here in detai terms even of the Persian concession, for they had little direct bearing on the telegraph system of the Persian Gulf; suffice it to say that, m 1 event of the Anglo-Persian Telegraph Convention of 23rd Novem ei 1865 not being renewed on its expiration, the Tehran-Bushehr l 11 ^® to be transferred to the concessionaires, In the summer of 18 oq vflm 2m It BritiA PerS0 - RuSsian line was transferred from a Russian On the 24th of May 1869 a fresh agreement was concluded between the ersian Government and the* Indo-European Telegraph Company, incorporated on the 8th of April 1868, which had now, as permitted by an article in the original concession, taken the place of the firms of Siemens Ihis second agreement, which was due to resolutions adopted by the ^^ Telegraphic Conference of 1868 in fayour of a reduced tariff altered the financial arrangements between the Company and the Persian Government It also conyeyed to the grantees a monopoly for the construction of a line for international traffic between Shiraz and Bandar Abbas, a privilege of which no advantage was taken and which was annuUed m a subsequent agreement dated 12th August 1882. ,, T h j' 0U i h oommunicatio n between London and Tehran by means of January ISTO 0 ^ 11 Company's line was opened on the 31st of International telegraphic service in the Turkish domininons, 1867-68. In 1867 persevering efforts were made by the British representatives at Constantinople to secure some amelioration in the working of the lurkish sections of the Indo-European line^ particularly on the side between Constantinople and Europe. The exclusive use of one wire between Constantinople and Vienna was requested^ but was refused; and the negotiations ended with a promise by the Ottoman Government that two wires between Constantinople and Vienna^ one by Bosnia^ the other by Servia, 'would be especially affected to the international service, and that absolute priority would be given to Indo-European messages upon whichever of the two happened to be at the time in the better order. ^ ne : ^ roin -B a £^ad having proved adequate for as much traffic as could pass over the other sections in Turkish territory, the alternative line between Tehran and Baghdad via Khanaqin was abandon- sd, for international purposes, abotit March 1868.

The principal results of the Conference, so far as the Indo-Europeaa Telegraph Department and Company were concerned^ were a marked reduction of the Indo-European tariff and the application of that tariff to eight recognised routes, five of which were a Indo-Ottoman 3) passing through Fao ; and three a Russo-Persian 93 passing through Bushehr. Of the first group, one route traversing Turkey, Servia, Austria, Switzerland and France was recommended by the Conference for Indo -European business ; a ad the countries interested accordingly entered into a Conven tion among themselves for its special utilization. In 1869, the state of through communication being still far from perfect, the Director-in-Chief of Indo-European telegraphs moved the Director of the Telegraph Office at Berne, who had^ been nominated by the Vienna Conference to be referee and secretary in such matters, to circularise the different powers adhering to the Vienna Conven tion. Satisfactory replies were received from a majority of the govern ments addressed ; but Turkey, the real defaulter, while making many fair professions and attempting to cast the blame of her own snor - comings upon other governments, continued to block the way of retorm. With effect from the 1st of January 1869 the tariff, which in 1868 was £5-0-0 per 20 words bv the Turkish and by the reisian route, was reduced to £2-17-0 per 20 words and £1-10-0 per 10 words upon both lines.

The Anglo-Persian Convention of 1865^ which expired on the 12th of August 187^ was prolonged for a period of three months by an Agreement executed on the 19th of June 1872 ; and^ on the expiration of the extended period^ it was replaced by a new Convention, dated 2nd December 1872. Major Champain^ now Director-in-Chiefs assisted in the negotiations at Tehran, whither he had proceeded for the purpose. Among other matters the new Convention provided for the erection by the British Government of a third wire between Tehran and Bushehr; and it was arranged that, after the completion of this wire^ the first wire, set up in 1864, should be reserved for local use and be worked by employes of the Persian Government occupying rooms provided by the Persian Government and separate from the rooms used by the staff of the British Department. In accordance with the recommendations of Major Champain, who had personally visited Persia in 1870-71 to satisfy himself of the necessity for a change, iron standards were to be *substituted between Tehran and Bushehr for the existing wooden posts. As regards receipts from the Indo-European through traffic, it was agreed that the Persian Government should receive either a fixed subsidy of 12,000 Tumans per annum or a royalty of two francs per 20 words, the remainder of the. profits being shared by the Indo-European Telegraph Department and the Company of the same name in such manner as they might arrange between themselves. In respect of receipts from messages originating or terminating in Persia a different mode of distribution was arranged. The maintenance of the line, in which were included repairs and the appointment, control and payment of line guards, was to remain in the hands of the British Director; but the Persian Government were to pay 1^000 Tumans a year as a contribution under this head, and in case of wilful damage the cost of the repairs was to be defrayed by the Persian Government. The debt of the Persian to the British Government on account of telegraph construction and services, which now amounted to £47,217, was to be undertaken by the Indo-European Telegraph Company and discharged by them in 24) equal instalments. The new Convention should apply primarily to the Tehran-Bushehr line; but, in event of the British Director desiring at any time to resume charge of the Tehran-Khanaqin line, it should apply equally to the same, the questions of tariff and method of account upon that section remain ing however a matter for special arrangement. The Convention itself was to hold good until the 1st of January 1895, when it was to cease, and the whole of the wires were then to be made over absolutely to the Persian Government. On the 3rd of July 1887, by virtue of an Agreement, the term of the Convention of 1872 was prolonged to the 31st of January 1905. On the 7th January 1902^ a further extension to the 31st January 1925 was # The Persian Government undertook to pay 10,000 Tumans in ten annual instal- toents for the new iron poBts.

Since the 14th of December 1885 the Indo-European Telegraph Department have been responsible for the maintenance of a line ; constructed by the Persians at some earlier period, between Tehran and Mashhad. The arrangement does not depend upon any formal agreement and is understood to be terminable at the wish of either the Indian or the Persian Government, both of which pay annual contributions towards the expenses of maintenance. With a few modifications only, introduced when agreements were renewed or at other times by the consent of the parties, the Convention of 1872 was observed to the end in its original form. As the share of the Persian Government in the proceeds of the through traffic^ an annual sum of 12,000 Tumans was at first paid; but later the amount was fixed by agreement at the equivalent of 120,000 francs; and on each occasion of the Indo-European Telegraph Company's concessions being extended, in 1882 and .1891, this amount, was enhanced by lO^OOO francs. The gross receipts from through traffic, after deduction of the annual sum of 120,000 francs which is payable to the Persian Govern ment, are shared between the Indo-European Telegraph Depart ment and the Indo-European Telegraph Company; and the Company is responsible for the payment to Persia, out of its own share, of the two annual increments of 10,000 francs imposed in 1882 and 1891. For three years from the conclusion of the Convention, the Persian share in the income from international messages originating or terminating in Persia was leased to Great Britain at a fixed rate of 2,000 Tumans per annum; ^ but thereafter Persia was credited instead, as permitted by the Convention, with two-thirds of the actual income from this source. After 1887 the payment by Persia of 1,000 Tumans a year towards the pay of lineguards was remitted for special reasons. The debt undertaken by the Indo-European Telegraph Company was finally discharged in February 1884. With effect from the 1st April 1899, direct control of the Indo- European Telegraph Department was assumed by the Secretary of State or India, in place of the Government of India by whom it had been exercised since mL During the period from 16th February 1888 to olst March 1893 the Department was under the Director-General of e egraphs in India; at all other times it has been under the direct management of a Director-in-Chief of its own. i arJ nt exte ' s L i , ori of the Gnlf tekgraphs to include Bandar 'Abbas in . ai id the construction of a central Persian line from Kashan to •Karachi m 1902-04 are dealt with further on.Financial and administrative history of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, 1868-1907. In 1869 the principal objects of the Indo-European Telegraph Department were economy and retrenchment. Colonel Goldsmid, desiring to further these ends and considering that the head of the Department^ now that all initial difficulties had been overcome^ no longer required an Assistant, resigned his appointment in favour of Major Champain, who thereafter conducted the affairs of the department single-handed. On the 26th of March 1870 the British Indian Submarine Telegraph Companj^s cable connecting Bombay and Suez was completed, and communication with England by way of Malta, Marseilles and Paris was immediately opened. On the 14th of June 1870, the Falmouth, Gibraltar and Malta Telegraph Company having also finished their work, cable communication between India and England via the Red Sea became continuous but for a short section in Egypt, where there was a land line from Suez to Alexandria. The Indo-European traffic was thus distributed among three instead of between two main routes; and a reconsideration of the tariff fixed by the Vienna Conference in 1868 was demanded, on the ground that its lowness might oblige the commercial companies interested in the Eusso-Persian and Red Sea routes to withdraw from the field, leaving the inefficient but state-aided line across the Turkish dominions to cope with the whole of the traffic. The companies had in the meantime raised their rates to £4-10-0 per 20 words; but the Turkish line still secured 18 per cent, of the traffic on account of its ^greater cheapness, and the companies^ lines continued to work at a loss. A Telegraph Sub-Conference, attended by Major Champain and by Colonel Robinson, R. E., Director-General of Indian Telegraphs, was accordingly held at Berne in September and October 1870, by which it was recommended that the rate by the Turkish line should be increased to 112-50 francs or £4-10-0, a change to which the Ottoman Administra tion were induced to agree. A Telegraph Conference which sat at Rome in December 1870 and January 1871 was attended by the same British delegates. Major Champain on this occasion appearing for Persia also; and on the advice of this body the rate for the unit message of 20 words was reduced from 112*50 francs to 100 francs or £4-0-0. After an informal Conference held at Vienna in 1873, at which the Director- in-Chief of the Indo-European Telegraph Department met the Directors- General of the Russian and Prussian systems, the rate was again altered with effect from the 15th of November 1873, to 50 francs for 10 words a special charge for each word over ten. After a Conference at St. Petersburg in 1875, and with effect from the 1st of January 1876, the rate was made 5*50 francs per word via Tehran or Suez and 5 francs via Turkey ; from the 1st of April 1880 it was raised to S'GO francs Reduction of expenditure, 1869.

The two last reductions were made under a guarantee that the Government of India would bear a share in such loss of revenue as might result during a period of 10 years. After the completion of what may be called the first through cable between India and Europe in 1870, second and third cables were provided, a section at a time, between Suez and Bombay, the whole triplicate system being finally perfected in 1902. The table below explains the distribution of the Indian traffic over these lines by percentages taken at three different periods :— Route.

It may be noted here, though the enterprise was a purely Persian one and had no direct connection with the operations of the Indo -European Telegraph Department, that a system of telegraph lines connecting Ahwaz in 'Arabistan with Dizful, Shushtar and Muhammareh in the same province, was completed in August 1891, and was connected, early in 1892, with Burazjan on the Bushehr-Shiraz line of the Indo -European Telegraph Department by a wire from Ahwaz passing via Kamuz, Ben- behan, Dilam and Rig. An attempt had previously been made by tne Persian Government, in 1878, to connect Shushtar telegraphically with Tehran by way of Dizful. In May 1892 the Persian Telegraph Office at Muhammareh was undermined by the tide and collapsed. The 'Arabistan system of Persian Telegraphs is maintained, however, to the present day, but the working is inefficient, and long interruptions of communication are of frequent occurrence. tw Modifications of the telegraph system in the Gulf, 1869-1907. Removal from Bushehr to Risliehr, 1877. Alterations and extensions of the Persian Gulf telegraphs, sin their general completion in 1869, have not been many ; but some oi have been important. The telegraph office at Bushehr was at first in the town, and was connected with the landing-place at Eishehr by an aerial line 7 ^ 66 'J length. In February 1865 a double-cored shore-end was subs i u ed between Bushehr and Bishehr, but the insulation was defective, an it pi;.(i*AC 2427 was replaced in November 1865 by a single-cored shore-end landed at Bushehr, Finally, m November 1877, the cable was once more landed at Rishehr and the telegraph office was removed to that place from Bushehr. In January 1877 the cable-house on Hanjam was shifted from its original site_, at some distance inland^ and brought down to the water*'s edge. In 18b0 the station on Hanjam^ having* become superfluous for technical reasons through the introduction of more sensitive instru ments; was closed on the 11th of December; and early in 1881 the cable was replaced in the fair-way of the Gulf to the south of the island, the ends having been during the interim directly connected in the cable-house. The first Persian Gulf cable having, in 1884, become unserviceable between Jashk and Bushehr, and the second cable, that of 1869, having at the same time shown signs of deterioration, it was resolved to replace the former by a new cable. The material arrived at Jashk on the 13th and 14th of November 1885 on board the steamers Dacia^ and ' International' belonging to the Company by which the cable had been manufactured. The work of laying began from the Inter national ; on the 15th of November 1885 under the supervision of Sir John Bateman Champain, Birector-in-Chief, and early on the 17th the whole of the cable carried by the (c International 33 had been sub merged. Operations were resumed by the f ' Daciaon the afternoon of the same day, and the final connection was made at Eishehr on the evening of the 20th of November. The cable-laying steamers were piloted in their course by the Indo-European Telegraph Department's vessel Patrick Stewart ' ; but, through an error in the charts, several knots of cable were laid from the ' Dacia' on the 18th of November across a 17 fathom patch, from which they were subsequently removed into deeper water on the 29th of March 1887. The new Jashk-Bushehr cable was of guttapercha and cost £76,702 or about £145 a knot. In September 1893 Gwadar was abolished as a telegraph station and the cable was joined up at sea between Karachi and J ashk. In October 1894 the Gwadar station was re-established, but only as an office on the land line. In the interim telephonic connection had been main tained for the benefit of the British Agent at Gwadar, with Ormarah and Chahbar; but the substituted service proved unsatisfactory, and this was the main reason for the re-opening of the telegraph office. The inadequacy of communication between Masqat and the outside world had more than once formed the subject of official discussions in India; but it was reserved for Lord Curzon to take, as Viceroy, the first practical steps for remedying the situation. In 1879 Saiyid Turki, Sultan of Masqat^ had expressed a desire that Ms capital should be brought into connection with India by telegraph, and the matter was considered by the Government of India; but their decision, in view of the expensiveness of the project and the slenderness 0 f the naval and military advantages then to be derived from it, was adverse. Abandon ment of Haniam. 1880. Eelajing of the cable of 1864 bet ween Jashk and Bushehr in 1885. Abandon ment of Gwadar as a cable station, 1893. The Jashk- Masqat cable laid, 1899- 1901.2428 In 1898, when steamer communication with India was fortnightly only, 129 British Indian traders at Masqat petitioned Government for a weekly steamer service and for the establishment, if possible, of tele- graphic communication between Masqat and India. Arrangements were made to satisfy the first and principal wish of the petitioners: but the second was not granted. In 1899 a further memorial was received from the same community, suggesting that the weekly mail steamers, inward and outward, should call at Jashk for the purpose of despatching and receiving Masqat telegrams. The Government of India thereupon directed that the question of a cable to Masqat should be reconsidered from the political and commercial point of view; and a number of facts were elicited which placed the need for a cable in a very clear light. The nearest telegraph station to Masqat being at Jashk, vessels of the Royal Navy were frequently diverted from their proper duties and employed as despatch vessels to carry official messages between Masqat and Jashk ; never theless communication between the Political Resident at Bushehr, the Political Agent at Masqat, and the Government of India did not possess that rapidity which the crisis of February 1899 at Masqat had shown to be essential in an emergency. The course of trade also at Masqat was impeded, no less than the conduct of public business, by the want of telegraphic facilities; for it was generally impossible that merchants should place their orders in Indian markets at the moment when a favour able opportunity presented itself. Captain Cox, Political Agent at Masqat, further pointed out that telegraphic communication at Masqat might be ^ a valuable weapon against the trade of smuggling arms to Persia, which was then rife, more especially if the port of Bandar Abbas were also brought within the telegraphic system. The receipts at the British Post Office at Masqat during 1899 on account of tele grams sent to Gwadar, Jashk and Bushehr for transmission amounted to Rs. 4,329, and it was estimated that the revenue of a telegraph office, if one were established, might amount to Rs. 10,000 a year, and that there would be a saving of Rs. 13,500 per annum to the Royal Navy. In 1900 the scheme was referred to Her Majesty^s Government and was approved in principle; but the British Treasury declined to contribute to the cost of execution, and the time also was financially u n- favourable, inasmuch as important extensions of telegraphic communica tion were in progress in the Far East and there was a strong deman for submarine cable. The whole cost of the enterprise was ultimately undertaken by the Government of India, who were convinced of its g rea ^ importance ; and the work, after it had been sanctioned by the Secretary o State in May 1901 at an estimated cost of £49,00U, was commenced without delay. It had originally been intended either to divert the existing Karachi-Jashk cable so as to touch at Masqat or to lay an additional cable between those places passing vid Masqat; but ulti mately, for technical reasons, connection between Jashk and Masqat wae made by means of a new and direct cable, carried some distance to west- wards of the straight line in order to avoid excessively deep water. Land- at MaS( l at being already secured by the Telegraph Treaty oi iooo no special arrangement with the Sultan was necessary ; but ms2429 co -operation was requested and was obtained. The work was finished and communication established on the 26th of November 1901. From the first the gross receipts of the Masqat office exceeded the estimate which had been formed and in the first four months after the opening* of the line they amounted to about Rs. 6,000, w^hile they are now on the average about Rs. 14,600 per annum. The actual cost of the enterprise was Rs. 6,21,453. In accordance with Captain Cox^s suggestion, the Government of India, at the same time that they recommended the laying of a cable to Masqat, proposed the extension of the Gulf Telegraphs to Bandar ; Abbas by looping one of the existing cables between Jashk and Rishehr into the Bandar ^Abbas bay. As in the case of the Masqat cable Her Majesty^s Government approved of the scheme, but were unable to give any financial assistance; and the Government of India, partly in the hope that this unfavourable decision might be modified, and partly on account of technical doubts as to the best mode of effecting the junction with Bandar 'Abbas, temporarily laid the project aside. It may be noted that in 1898-94 the Persian Government had themselves been anxious that Bandar ^Abbas should be brought into the telegraphic system, and that a survey for a land line from Jashk was attempted, but was aban doned owing to obstruction in Bashakard. Early in 1902 the Naval Commander-in-Chief on the East Indian station suggested the opening of a telegraph station at Basidu; and in 1903 the Government of India approached the Secretary of State with fresh proposals regarding an extension to Bandar ^Abbas. They now recommended that telegraphic communication should in the first instance be restored with the, old station on Han jam, in order to secure a point of communication situated on the fair-way of the Gulf, at no great distance from its mouth and easily accessible to the ships of the Royal Navy. At the same time they suggested various modes of linking Hanjam with Bandar ^Abbas, giving the preference to one which involved a land line across Qishm island; the existence of this line would, it was argued, increase the influence of the British Government in Qishm, where the station of Basidu was already a British possession. It was estimated that an all-cable connection would cost £18,539, while one including a land section on Qishm could be constructed for £11,835. Some delay occurred through the Admiralty expressing a preference for Basidu, as the site of the new station, over Hanjam; and the question was not finally decided until after Lord Curzon^s visit to the Persian Gulf at the end of 1903, in the course of which the Viceroy personally investigated upon the spot the relative merits of the two places. While at Bandar Abbas, His Excellency received a request from the Indian mercantile community for an extension of the telegraph to that place; and the Salar-i-Mu^azzam, the Persian Governor of the Gulf Ports, privately supported the suggestion. On his return to India Lord Curzon advocat ed the claims of Hanjam as being superior for general purposes to Basidu, and this view in the end obtained universal acceptance. It remained to devise means for overcoming the opposition to the scheme which was anticipated on the part of Persia. After some discussion it was decided to re-open the station on Hanjam without The Hanjam diversion and connection with Bandar 'Abbas, 1904 -05.2430 consulting the Persian Government, upon the strength of the authority granted in 1868 and not subsequently revoked, and thereafter to negotiate for the desired extension to Bandar 'Abbas. The cable-ship ' Patrick Stewart ^ was accordingly despatched from Karachi on the 9tli of April 1904, and telegraphic communication with Hanjam was restored on the 19th of the same month after an interval of 13 years, at a cost of only Rs. 36^500. On the 10th of April Sir A. Hardinge, the British Minister at Tehran, on being apprised of these proceedings, informed the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs of the intention of the Government of India to reopen the Hanjam station and intimated that he would shortly approach the Persian Government with a request for the institution of a provisional Persian postal service between Hanjam and Bandar 'Abbas and with proposals for an extension of the telegraph line to Bandar 'Abbas. The Minister's note appears to have been mislaid or carelessly read by the Persian official to whom it was addressed, and it was not until some time in May that the Persian Government became aware ; through a report by the Governor of the Gulf Ports, of what had occurred at Hanjam ; they were disagreeably surprised, but confronted with the accomplished fact^ agreed to arrange for a temporary postal service. M eanwhile the British telegraph officials had instituted both a weekly and an express service for the delivery of Hanjam telegrams at Bandar 'Abbas; and some friction occurred when, in August 1^04, the Belgian Director of Customs at Bandar ^Abbas established a rival Persian post between Hanjam and the mainland and insisted that it should be exclusively used and that the bags sent by it should not be sealed. The farther proposals for the extension of the telegraph from Hanjam to Bandar ^Abbas were at first resisted by the Shah of Persia, who was at this time in a peculiarly uncompromising mood on the subject of concessions to foreigners, and seemed to be endeavouring by all means in his power to stifle the growth of European enterprises in the country. For a time the representations of the British Legation weie staved off by a pretence that the Bandar ' Abbas extension would be con structed by the Persian Government themselves ; but the British Minister continued to press the point and resorted to the argument that, undft Article No. 2 of the Persian Telegraph Convention of 1868, the Britis Government were entitled to construct a land line from Jashk to t e neighbourhood of Bandar ^Abbas and might avail themselves of this ola concession if permission to connect Hanjam with Bandar 'Abbas were refused. At length the desired extension was sanctioned by the 'Persian Government, but on conditions somewhat unfavourable to the Bn is Government, who had hoped for permission to construct and work new branch as an integral part of the system of the Telegraph Department. By an agreement executed on the 13th of a ; 1905 by Sir A. Hardinge and the Mushir-ud-Dauleh, Persian Minis e for Foreign Affairs, it was settled that a line across Qishm, to conne ^ Hanjam with Bandar 'Abbas, should be constructed on behalf o Persian Government by two engineers of the Indo-European Telegiap Bepartment, placed temporarily at their disposal; and that the ^ the cost of its construction—subject to a maximum of Bs. 75, ^ ^d been refunded by the Persian Government, should be handed ovei2431 the Persian Ministry of Telegraphs to be worked by a Persian staff. The objections of the Shah to control of the Hanjam end of the new line by British telegraphists proved insnperable,, and it was found necessary to include in the agreement a stipulation that there should be a separate Persian office at Hanjam and that telegrams should be transferred at Hanjam between the two offices ; it was, however, settled that, if the British Government desired it, a British signaller should be allowed to deal at Bandar J Abbas with all British state messages received at or despatched from that place. With the exception of this signaller and of the employes of the Indo-European Telegraph Department whom it might be necessary ^to engage for the maintenance and repair of the line, the Persian Government bound themselves to employ none but Persian subjects on the staff. The extension was forthwith carried out in accordance with the terms of this agreement, and communication between Hanjam and the shore at Bandar ^Abbas was established on the 31st of December 1905 ; but, in consequence of difficulties as to the position of the cable-house and office raised by the Persian Government on the advice of M. Stas, the Belgian Director of Persian Customs at Bandar ; Abbas, the line had not as yet in April 1907 been opened for public business. Meanwhile the shore-end remained under the control of the Indo-European Telegraph Department. The Central Persian land line, 1898-1907. In June 1898 a scheme was proposed in London by Mr. B. T. Ffinch, Director-in-Chief of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, which, having, been adopted in principle by Her Majesty^s Government, promised shortly to revolutionise the existing Indo-Persian system of telegraphs and to render obsolete the achievements of the past, particularly in the Persian Gulf. In 1883, when the first cable laid between Jashk and Bushehr began Bear to wear out, the substitution of a land line was suggested between Jashk SG0 P e ^ and Shiraz ; and a reconnaissance was accordingly made in January-March VY0 ^ 1884 by Mr. J. R. Preece, an officer of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, of the whole route from the latter to the former of these two places. Eventually it was decided to negative the scheme ; and the old cable was, as we have seen, replaced by a new one in 1885. In 1898, both the cables in the Gulf now approaching the period at which their reliability might be expected to fail, the same problem arose again in an altered shape and on a more important scale. Experience had proved that the ordinary life of a cable in the Persian Gulf was about 15 years only ; the maintenance of the land line between Karachi and Jashk was difficult and expensive, because of its proximity to the sea and the consequent extreme dampness of the atmosphere j and the line to Europe through Turkish ''Iraq, which the first Persian Gulf cable had been mainly intended to serve, was still so inefficiently worked in the2432 Anglo-Per sian Conven tion for con- struction'and working, 16th August 1901. TurMsh dominions as to be practically useless. On the other hand .British 13aluciiistan had been greatly developed during the preceding 20 years^ and recently a direct trade route had been brought into existence between Quetta ancl Sistan. These circumstances^ taken together^ indi cated the desirability of transferring telegraphic business from the sub marine Persian Gulf route, circuitous in relation to Persia though not to 1 urkish Iraq, to some more northerly and direct land line between India and Persia. Mr. Ffinch s proposal was, in effect, that the land line from Karachi to Jashk and one of the cables from Jashk to Bushehr should be abolished on communication being established between Europe and India by way of Central Persia; that the material of the abandoned cable should be used for the repair of the remaining one from Karachi via Jashk and Bushehr to Jao; and that ultimately cable communication in the Gulf might be done away with altogether, as also the Jashk station and the telegraph steamer, the line between Bushehr and Isfahan being afterwards maintained and worked as a branch of the Central Persian line. It was estimated that a line from Kashan to Karachi would be about l,4u0 miles in length, and one from Kashan to Quetta about 1,300 miles. Negotiations for the execution of Mr. Ffinch^s project were imme diately opened with the Persian Government through the British Minister at Tehran. .During 1899 and 1900 the objections of the Shah and his ministers continued insuperable, the former laying stress rather on the uncivilised character of the Baluchi country to be traversed, where incidents similar to the recent murder of Mr. Graves might be expected to ^ occur, * while the latter suggested that a telegraph concession to Britain in the south might provoke the Russians to ask a similar favour in the north,—-a demand which it would be impossible to refuse. In reality the Persians seem at first to have suspected that the new tele graph project concealed some political design on the part of Britain, and even that it was intended to utilise the troubles to which it might give rise as a pretex for introducing Indian troops into the country. ^ en £&gt;^ 1 on l^th of August 1901, these apprehensions having with difficulty been removed, a Convention for the extension of telegra phic communication between Europe and India through Persia was signed at Tajrish near Tehran on behalf of the British and Persian Governments. Ratification took place in January 1902. By this new onvention it was settled that, in addition to the present line of telegraph rrom Tehran to Bushehr and the submarine cable thence to India, a three-wire line of telegraph should be carried by the Persian Government 10m Kashan via Yazd and Kirman to the Baluchistan frontiei. Construction was to take place under the supervision and direction of the Indo-European Telegraph Department in Persia, the pay of the workmen employed being in the first instance advanced, and the necessary stores supplied, by the British Government as a loan repayable without mterest. The line, which on completion should become the property Qt the Persian G overnment, was to be leased to the Indo -European Kapch 0f makr an, page 2195.

The maintenance of the line (including repairs) was to be in the hands of the British telegraphic staff, and the cost of the same was to be defrayed by the British Government; the line guards also, who must be Persian subjects, should be appointed, controlled and paid by the British telegraph authorities. For the protection of the British officials and of the line itself the Persian Government assumed full responsibility; but the task was to be rendered as simple as possible by the location of the officials at large centres of population and by an obligation on their part to apply for escorts before proceeding into districts scheduled as dangerous. Of the three wires composing the line, one should be at the disposal of the Persian Telegraph Administration for local work, while the other two were to be reserved for international traffic. Provision was further made in the Convention for the allocation of the revenue of local, terminal and transit messages ; and certain articles of the Convention of 1872 were declared to be applicable to the Central Persian line. The term of the Convention was till the 1st of January 1925, or such longer period as might be necessary for the discharge of the debt due for construction by the Persian to the British Government • but power was reserved to the British Government to abandon the line at any time, after giving six months' notice, on condition of forfeiting any balance of undischarged debt which might still be due from Persia. One article, the Tenth, provided for the placing of an additional wire on the existing line between Tehran and Kashan; but this article, as will appear further on, it was subsequently found necessary to modify in practice. The construction of the new line, which consisted of three iron wires carried upon iron poles, was begun at Kashan on the 2nd of December 1902; and on the 21st of January 1904 a point 25 miles to the east of Bam had been reached. It was originally intended that the line should pass onwards to British Baluchistan by way of Bazman; but an alterna tive route was now suggested; and, after a pause for consideration, work was resumed on the 24th of February, not in the direction of Bazman but across the desert to Koh-i-Malik Siyah, the meeting point of British, Afghan and Persian territory. This prolongation was completed and connected with the British Indian system of telegraphs in the neigh bourhood of Koh-i-Malik Siyah on the 9th of May 1904; and direct communication by land was thus established for the first time between India and Tehran. The extension across the desert was, at first, a temporary single-wire line; but it is now understood that this will be made permanent, and that it may ultimately become a section of the main nne between India and Persia. Advantage was taken of the construction of the new Central Persian Ime to improve the alignment of the existing line south of Keshan. Construction.2434 Karachi 'branch, 1905-06. Duplication of the Tehran Kash in section, 1905-07. Cables and land lines. This was done by abolishing' the direct line between Kashan and Isfahan, which crossed a pass 8,760 feet high, and by connecting Isfahan with Ardistan, a station on the Central Persian line between Kashan and Yazd. By this means a lower level route was obtained; and various economies, some of a permanent character, were effected. At the end of 1904&lt; it was recommended by Mr. H. A. Kirk, who on the 1st April 1902 had succeeded Mr. Ffinch as Director-in-Chief of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, that a new line of telegraph should be constructed from Karachi via Las Bailah to Panjgur, and be connected, eventually, with the Central Persian line. This proposal, as the main part of it affected British territory only, was readily sanctioned; work was begun on the 14th of September 1905 ; and on the 25th of June 1906 the line stood completed to Panjgur. On the 3rd of August following a survey party left Panjgur to examine the various routes by which communication between Panjgur and a station on the Central Persian line might be * established. In the Tenth Article of the Convention of 1901 it was laid down that an extra wire should be added to the existing line between Tehran and Kashan to carry such additional traffic as might be thrown on it by the new Central Persian line. Examination of the old line however showed that, partly on account of the age of the materials and partly on account of faults of alignment such as irregular length of spans, the erection of an additional wire on the same set of posts would be danger ous, and that a new line of posts was required. With the assent of the Persian Government it was accordingly arranged that a new line of posts should be erected to carry in the first instance two wires only, one for the local service of the Persian Telegraph Administration and the other for international purposes. This work it was expected to complete by the end of June 1907. ANNEXURE NO. 1.—GENERAL ACCOUNT OP THE PERSIAN GULF SECTION OF THE INDO-EUROPEAN TELE GRAPHS IN 1906. The following are the cables and land lines at present controlled and worked by the Indo-European Telegraph Department in the Pereian Gulf or its approaches :— 1. A cable from Karachi to Jashk, opened in 1868 ; length 5S8knots; stations at Karachi and Jashk. 2. A two-wire land line from Karachi to Jashk, opened from Karachi to Gwadar in 186'1 and from Gwadar to Jashk in 1869 ; length 699-85 miles ; stations at Karachi, Ormarah, Pasni, Gwadar, Chahbar and Jashk. There was formerly a station at Sonflii' yani, between Karachi and Ormarah, but it was closed inJISTl. * The roube eventually chosen was from Panjgur to Nok Kondi, a point on the Indian Telegraph Department's line between Nushki and Kobat. A line was con structed to Nok Kondi; and connection was made at Eobat with the Central Persian Hne by a wire added to the Indian line from Nok Kondi to Eobat. The line trom Panjgur ^to Nok Kondi was completed on the 4th November 1907, and through n QAfF^k* 0 ^ or king between Tehran and Karachi was established on the 5th November jlyuz.2435 8. A cable from Jashk to Masqat, opened in 1901 • length 319 knots ; stations at Jashk and Masqat. 4. A cable from Jashk to Hanjam, opened in 1904; length 136 knots ; stations at J ashk and Han jam. This cable was origi nally laid in 1869 as part of a direct cable between Jashk and Bushehr. 5. A cable and land line from Han jam to .Bandar ■'Abbas^ crossing Qishm Island ; completed in 1905; aggregate length of cables 17*491 knots and of land line 30'75 miles; stations at Hanjam and Bandar 'Abbas. The management of this line,, which was constructed on behalf of the Persian Government^ is at present temporarily vested in the Indo-European Telegraph Department as the cost of construction has not jet been repaid. 6. A cable from Hanjam to Rishehr, opened in 1904; length 378*5 knots ; stations at Hanjam and Eishehr. This cable originally formed part of the direct cable between Jashk and Bushehr which was laid in 1869. From the Rishehr office short local land lines run to the British Residency and Persian Telegraph Office in Bushehr town and to the Resident's country house at Sabzabad. EJshehr is connected with Tehran via Shiraz and Isfahan by a three-wire line^ of which one wire is in possession of the Persian Telegraph Administration ; this is at present the Department's main line between India and Europe. Signalling is carried on direct between Karachi and Tehran, the electric current being automatically reinforced at the intermediate stations of Jashk and Rishehr. 7. A cable from Jashk to Rishehr, opened in 1885 ; length 521*6 knots ; stations at Jashk and Rishehr. 8. A cable from Rishehr to Fao, opened in 1864; length 152 knots ; stations at Rishehr and Fao.

In the Dashtyari district the whole subsidy of Rs. 1,000 a year pashtyari has, since the 1st of January 1904?, been divided equally between district. Mir ' Abdi Khan and Mir Mahmud Khan, the joint chiefs; and payments formerly made to petty headmen have been discontinued. To the end of 1901 the whole subsidy in the Bahu district was Bahu district, paid to the Chief. Since the 1st of January 1902 it is divided between the Chief {Rs. 600) and Mir Ahmad Khan of Bahu (Bs. 400). It will be seen that the total annual amount of the subsidies in Total. Persia is Bs. 5,840 a year, of which more than half is allotted to the Gaih district. Subsidies are paid, besides these, in British Baluchistan.

Tlie Persian Gulf line as an overland route between India and Europe* The purely commercial factories of the Hon'ble East India Company in the Persian Gulf were dependent, for communication with the outer world, upon visits of the Company's ships from India and the semi- political Eesidencies and Agencies by which they were succeeded, inherited, generally, their position in this respect. From an early period in the 18th century, however, Basrah enjoyed the exceptional advantage of direct though irregular communication with Europe by way of Aleppo j and when, towards the end of the century, fortnightly inter course between Bombay and Basrah was established by means of the Company^ cruisers, a line of camel post in connection therewith was organised under the supervision of the Company's representative at Basrah between that place and Aleppo, and was prolonged by a line of horse post to Constantinople. The Persian Gulf route was at this time the most rapid between Europe and India, and it was freely used by the British Government during the Napoleonic wars. With other thril ling intelligence of that period the news of the battle of the Nile was received through Basrah by the British authorities in India; and in 1801 Mr. Samuel Manesty, Resident at Basrah, received the thanks of the Governor-General of India for his ^ exertions in facilitating the communication between this Government and the British army serving in Egypt.' During the first quarter of the I9th century the East Indian official mail, or so much of it as was not conveyed by sea round the Cape of Good Hope, continued to follow the Persian Gulf line; but not long afterwards that line was abandoned for the Bed Sea (C over land 3i route, upon which was inaugurated a service of the Company's • The only complete authority on this subject is a Memorandum on the British Indian Post Offices in the Persian Gulf and Turkish Arabia, 1888, by Mr. F. B. O'Sbea (revised edition by Mr. F. Whymper, 1905); and from that work, and from the political records generally of the Government of India, the present Appendix has been compiled. A History of the British Indian Overland Mail by M. Loeper, PostaliDirector of Markirch, appeared in the international postal journal L'Union Fostale in 1883, and a translation is in the Library of the Foreign Depart ment, Simla. Capper's Observations, 1785, contain some interesting information regarding the mail route in his day between Europe and Basrah. The writer is indebted for numerous corrections and amplifications of the draft to His Britannic Majesty's Legation at Tehran ; to Major J. Eamsay, Political Resident at Baghdad ; to Major P. Z. Cox, Political Eesident at Busbehr; and to Mr. F. E* CroW, His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Basrah. Information in regard to specific points was kindly supplied by Mr. C. H.

The result of Parliamentary Committees which sat in 1834 and 1837 was the final adoption of the Red Sea route. When Colonel Chesney, after his survey of the rivers Tigris and Euphrates, tried to induce the Government of India to institute a fortnightly steamer service between Bombay and Basrah and to reopen the desert route, his views were not accepted; and in August 1837 the first monthly mail via Suez left England for Bombay. The Government of Bombay, indeed, proposed that the Red Sea and Persian Gulf routes should be used for official correspondence in alternate months but the Court of Directors of the East India Company ordered that the Gulf line should be employed only for the carriage of duplicate despatches; full use of it for this purpose was, however, to be made. The Red Sea route had a great advantage over that by Basrah in that it was equally well adapted for passenger and for mail traffic. Communication between the Persian Gulf and India, 1833-1862. Communica tion in abey ance for some years preoedicg 1S62. Kesimptiou of regular and direct oommunioa- tion, 1862. In 1839 interest in the Persian Gulf route was partially revived. The Court of Directors of the East India Company sent three specially constructed river steamers to Basrah for use on the Tigris^ and a letter post was instituted by their means between Easrah and Baghdad. In 1843 or 1844 the camel post between Mesopotamia and Syria was re - established^ but under altered conditions j for the point of departure was now Baghdad and the terminus Bairut^ Damascus forming an intermediate stage. The route thus opened, though it served the interests of Turkish Iraq, no longer secured a share of the Indo-European traffic; and the fact is instructive as illustrating the melancholy state into wbich direct communication between India and the Persian Gulf had now fallen. _ From this time onwards, until 1862, letters for India from Baghdad, from Basrah and even from Bushehr usuallv took a circuitous way by Damascus, Egypt and the Red Sea; and, what is more extra* ordinary still, the correspondence thus sent from Bushehr appears to nave been forwarded to Baghdad by land vU Tehran. Occasionally « r j t j rrl a veBsd of tlle Indian Navy from the Gulf to Bombay afforded an opportunity of more direct communication. British merchant vessels were at this time rarely seen in the Persian Gulf. • i rrh 1 e A eal :, 186 ^ S f^ a terin to tlie extraordinary state of inaccessibility into which the Gulf bad fallen, and ushered in a new political and commercial era *; it marked in fact the real commenceme nt of the modern2m naai; m period in the Persian Gulf region. The beginnings were modest. The establishment ' for postal purposes of^a line of steamers to run between Bombay and the Persian Gulf, and to call at Karachi on the way, was sanctioned by the Secretary of State forjudia in 1862 ; but the number of annual trips was at first limited to eight. The contract was under taken by the British India Steam Navigation Company; and in the same year the Secretary State for India accepted an offer by the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company to run, in considera tion of a subsidy of £2,400 a year, a monthly or six-weekly steamer between Basrah and Baghdad, connecting at Basrah with the new ocean service from Bombay. pf. Mail steamer service in the Persian Gulf, 1862-1907. Since its establishment in 1862, the mail service in the Persian Gulf has been repeatedly improved. In 1868 it became fortnightly and finally, in 1874, weekly communication was established.* The most recent improvement in steamer communications and postal arrangements in the Gulf was effected by an indenture, made on the 10th of November 1903, between the British India Steam Navigation Company and the Secretary of State j it consisted in the establishment of a double mail service under the names of ' Line No. 11 and ' Line No. 12^. Line No. 11 provided weekly communication between Karachi and Basrah via the Persian Gulf ports, and back by the same^ route, at an average speed of 8 knots an hour j and line No, 12 supplied weekly communication between Karachi and Basrah via the principal Persian Gulf ports, and back by the same route, at an average speed of 13 knots. A right was reserved to the Company to make the communication by Line No. 11 fortnightly, at times when they did not themselves require a weekly cargo service in addition to the fast weekly mail ^ service (Line No. 12)- but it was at the same time arranged that, in the weeks in which communication by Line No. 11 was omitted, the ports which were due to be served by the steamers of that line should be visited by the steamers of Line No. 12, except in so far as they could he served by Line No. Urn the alternative weeks, the intention being that the number of due calls should not be reduced. The Company were also excused from running the steamers of Line No. Ix beyond Bushehr, subject however to a proviso that the steamers of Line No. 12 should not be delayed for cargo considerations. The ports of call fixed for the slow cargo line (No. 11) were Karachi, Pasni, Gwadar, Masqat, Jashk, Bandar Abbas, Lingeh, Bahrain, Bushehr, Kuwait, Fao, Muhammareh and Basrah. Of these Pasni, Gwadar and Jashk were to be ports of call on each alternative voyage and return voyage while Lingeh and Bahrain were to be visited on every outward and every alternate mward trip and only every alternate Progressive acceleration, 1866-1878.

In the event of this slow line, being made at any time a fortnightly service, Bahrain might be treated as a port of fortnightly call in both directions. The minimum stay of vessels of the slow line at each port was fixed at 3 hours of daylight. The ports of call prescribed in the case of the fast mail line (^No. 12) were Karachi, Masqat, Bushehr, Fao, Muhammareh and Basrah, all of which (except Basrah, the turning point) were to be visited on both voyages. Line No. 11 is worked in connection with a slow, and Line No. 12 in connection with a fast line between Bombay and Karachi; and no change can be made in this respect without the sanction of Government. Government, by their chief political representative in any province of which the ports are concerned, may direct the Company's steamers to call at any port, or ports, in the Persian Gulf in addition to those men tioned ; but, in the case of the slow line, the limit of duration of the wnole voyage must then be extended proportionately; and, in the case of the fast line, the exercise of this power is subject to the condition that additional working expenses be not entailed on the Company. This last proviso does not, however, apply to additional calls made in conse quence of any intermission in the weekly running of Line No. 11. Government has also power, through the same officers, to detain vessels and alter the ports of call; but this does not include the power to cause any vessel to turn back, or deviate, from her regular voyage. The new contract came into force on the 1st of May 1904 and was to continue in force until the date of termination of the next Eastern Mail Contract, subject however to a minimum term of 7 years and to a maximum term of 10 years and 9 months from the date of its commence^ ment.t The total annual subsidy under this contract payable by Government to the British India Steam Navigation Company for its services in the Persian Gulf is Bs. 4,26^12-4, and of this the sum of Bs. 3,00,000 is on account of the fast mail service. The Company are at liberty, on expiry of the first three years of the term of the contract and provided that notice in writing of the intention to do has been given by the end of the second year of that term, to determine the contract in so far as it relates to the fast Persian Gulf line; and, in the event ot their exercising this right, the Government of India have the option o continuing the rest of the contract on a total subsidy to the Company o Bs. 7,00,000, as against a present total subsidy of Bs, 10,00,000, or o determining the contract altogether. The round voyage from Karachi and back is now made, under the conditions as to speed laid down in the contract, in about twelve days by the fast, and in about three weeks by the slow steamers. Masqat, wnic * For subsequent changes in the Kuwait servicej see next page, f The Eastern Mail Contract of 1897, which was due to expire on the 31«fc ^ January 1S05, was extended for three years, viz., to the 31st January 1908} an August 1907 a neW contract was concluded with the Peninsular and Oriental fetea .jj Navigation Company, which came into force on the 1st of February 1908 an * terininate on the Slst of January 1915. The object of the peculiar maximum arranged with the British India Steam Navigation Company was to secure a 81111 taneous falling-iii of the contracts with both Companies. ( f ;| ? y2443 until 1898 was served only by one fortniglitly steamer in either direction, has now a weekly fast and a weekly slow steamer both ways; the im provement began with the institution in 1898, on a request from the Indian mercantile community, of a visit by the weekly slow steamer returning to India, and &gt;t the beginning of 1899 the call on the upward journey was made weekly also. Arrangements were made, subsequently to the execution of the latest contract and without modifi cation thereof, for the inclusion of Kuwait, with effect from the 1st of December 1904), in the fast weekly service ; but in July 1905, at the desire of the Company, the Kuwait service was reduced to a fortnightly slow mail; and again, in October of the same year, a weekly mail by alternate slow and fast steamers was substituted at the instance of the Government of India. Dibai has been a fortnightly port of call for the slow steamers on the outward voyage since the 10th June 1904, and is also visited on the return voyage when inducement offers. The fast service in the Gulf was maintained for a few months, in the winter of 1904-05, by new turbine steamers able to run 18 knots an hour ; but these were subsequently withdrawn as they were unable to push their way through the mud on the bar of the Shatt-al-'Arab, their small rapidly-revolving screws being quickly clogged. Mail steamer service on the Tigris, 1863-1907. This service began in 1863^ in accordance with an agreement 1863-66. between the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company and the Secretary of State for India ; under the first contract* the subsidy was £2,400 a year and the service was six-weekly, being carried on in con nection with the six-weekly calls of the British India Steam Navigation Company's vessels at Basrah, arranged in 1862. The subsidy was paid, from the first, entirely by the Government of India. For several years the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company enjoyed a virtual monopoly of the river traffic ; their only competitors were native boats, taking sometimes 80 or 40 days to perform the voyage from Basrah to Baghdad, which was made by the steamers in 4 or 5 days. In 1866 the Tigris subsidy was raised to £4^800 a year in consideration of the service being made fortnightly ; and the Company of their own accord began to run three steamers a month, calling at ' , Amarah &gt; Kut-al- Amarah and other places intermediate between Basrah and Baghdad, in order to take advantage of the growing freight and passenger traffic. In 1867 a Turkish official concern, known as the Oman-Ottoman 1 line, established a rival service on the Tigris with the avowed object of running the British steamers off the river ; but it was badly managed, ♦A table of all the contracts for this service, up to date, will be found in Anuexure 2 to this Appendix.2444 and it hovered during the greater part of its existence upon the verge of dissolution. In 1869-70 the Turkish line made overtures, in spite of their notorious short comings^ for obtaining the contract, held by the British Company since the 1st of July 1863, for the carriage of the British mails; but their proposals were rejected on practical considera tions as well as for political reasons. 1875-83. In 1876 the subsidy of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Naviga tion Company was reduced to £3,600 a year, the Company binding themselves nevertheless to maintain a service of three steamers in the month. The Company were now extremely desirous of obtaining a concession to add a third steamer to the two which they already posses sed upon the Tigris ; and in the contract of 1876 they even undertook to provide a weekly service at a further reduced subsidy of £2,400 in case the British Government should succeed in persuading the Porte to grant the necessary authorisation. In 1878, without any alteration of the contract or the addition of a third steamer to their flotilla, the Company established a weekly service Lin both directions between Baghdad and Basrah which has continued without intermission until the present day. A third steamer was sent by the Company to Basrah in 1883; but its use was not, before 1905, permitted by the Turkish Government except as an occasional substitute for one of the othei two, and till then it was employed chiefly on the Company's Karun line. 1884-98. In 1884 j a fresh contract for the carriage of the mails was^ granted to the Euphrates and Tigris Company, and under the new indenture the Company were expressly relieved of the liability to carry, f ree 0 charge, specie and other valuables sent by post ; the change was highly advantageous to the Company, especially as the subsidy was maintained on a somewhat liberal scale, being fixed at Rs. 36^ per annum. In 1894 the contract was again renewed ; but the rec j g u fticient; in view of the services performed and of the prosperous condition of subsidy was reduced to Bs. 24,000, an amount which appeared sue the Company^s business. Latest con- In 1905 the mail contract between the Secretary of State for India tract and and the Euphrates and Tigris Company was renewed for 10 years wi conditions, effect from the 1st of May 1904, the subsidy being continued at tne rate of Bs. 24,000 per annum. The principal conditions were that Company should run a weekly steamer in both directions be wee^ Basrah and Baghdad ; that His Majesty^s mails and Government spec should be carried free, in consideration of the subsidy ; and that the v of the line should be placed at the disposal of Government, at a fixed in the contract, if required at any time for the transport of ro ^ or stores, for towage, or for any other purpose. Provision ^ aS made for regulating the times of arrival and departure and the p ace ® ^ call of the steamers. Failures to perform the contract were ^ condonable in case they arose from accident, insufficiency o ^ ^ in the low season, or other circumstances over which the Company a control, or when the strict fulfilment of the contract might be llic0 f^ e . ble with the reasonable requirements of the Company's ordinary ia ^ but the Company were made liable, in case of delays not excusable nn these rules, to a penalty of Rs. 15 for every hour lost.2445 'bs'/ Bstablisliment of Indian post offices in the Persian Gulf, 1864-92. The re-opening in 1862 of direct communication between India and the Persian Gulf gave rise to a demand for properly organised post offices. For a time letters were forwarded in packets from Bombay and Karachi to Basrah and other ports in the Gulf, and were distri buted by the agents of the British India Company, who also collected letters for despatch ; but the methods of distribution and posting were primitive and unsatisfactory. Some of the letters were prepaid with Indian postage stamps ; but the majority were either unpaid or insuffici ently paid, and no attempt was made to realise the proper postal dues. The need of a better system of postal communication having become apparent, the Government of India, on the recommendation of the local political officers, decided that it should be supplied. Post offices were opened at Masqat and Bushehr, on the 1st of May 1864 ; at Lingeh and Bandar 'Abbas, on the 1st of April 1867 ; at Basrah and Baghdad, on the 1st of January 1868 ; and at Gwadar, on the 12th of April 1868. Supplementary post offices, completing the system, were added at Jashk, on the 1st of September 1880 ; at Bahrain, on the 1st of August 1884 ; and at Muhammareh, on the 19th of July 1892, Discipline, control and inspection of the Persian Gulf post offices, 1864-1907. From the first a tacit understanding prevailed that the postal Discipline, employes in charge of the Gulf offices should be subject, in non-depart mental matters, to the authority of the political officers having jurisdic tion at their stations, and in some eases the offices were at first _ worked by members of the political officers^ establishments j but no principle was expressly laid down and some regrettable friction occurred, especially at Masqat and Basrah where the postmasters for a time succeeded^ in shaking off the bonds of departmental discipline as well as of political control. Since 1879, the Postmaster-General of Bombay has consistently- treated the Gulf offices as dependent on the political or consular establish ments to which they are attached; but even this did not prevent the occurrence of some trouble at Basrah in 1882-83. In 1884, however, a distinct ruling was given by the Government of India as to the position of the Postmasters at Basrah and Baghdad, since which year there has been no insubordination. The post offices in the Persian Gulf were at first included in the Coatrol. Bombay Postal Circle; but in 1869 they were transferred to the Sind Circle and placed under the Chief Inspector of Post Offices, Sind; in. 1879 they were re-transferred to the Bombay Circle and came again under the authority of the Postmaster-General of Bombay. In 1892 the post2446 offices of the Persian Gulf, including those of Turkish, 'Iraq, were consti tuted a divisional charge ; and it was ordered that, in view of the pecu liar character of the duties connected with the appointment, it should always be held by a European. The first Superintendent of the Persian Gulf division was Mr. O'Shea, appointed in September 1883 ; he made several visits to all the offices under his control, and under his auspices a post office was established in Bahrain and a postal service was provided for the town of Qisbm. In 1879 the headquarters of the Superintendent, which had hitherto been at Bombay, were transferred for the greater part of the year to Bushehr ; but during the months of June, July and August he was to be at Bombay. In 1893 the arrangements were again altered, and the Superintendent was replaced at Bombay with orders to spend four months of the year on , tour inspecting the offices of his division. From 1893 to 1899 the Superintendent, Persian Gulf, held collateral charge of the town sub-offices in Bombay; but in the latter year he was relieved of this duty j and in 1900 he was provided with a personal clerk. The first inspection of the Persian Gulf postal arrangements was made by Mr. Years, an officer of the Bombay circle, in 1867, when no regular offices as yet existed except at Masqat and Bushehr, but letters were informally distributed and collected for despatch at various places by the political staffs or by the agents of the British India Company. Mr. V ears's tour brought to light a number of abuses and irregularities, especially in the non-regulation offices, which steps were taken to remove ; and the establishment of regular post offices at Bander ^ Abbas, Lmgeh, Basrah and Baghdad,—at first on an experimental footing,—were among its principal results. The next inspection was carried out by tne ie Inspector of Post Offices, Sind and the Persian Gulf, in 1869. There was no further inspection of the offices till 1879 when Mr. Carter, e officer deputed for the purpose, died in the course of his tour, an was buried at Jashk. In 1880 it was arranged that the Gulf offices should, for the future, be inspected once a year by a qualified postal superin tendent or other officer; but departmental supervision was not mj introduced until 1883, since which year it has been thoroug an continuous. General working of the Persian Gnlf post offices, 1864-1907. The Gulf post offices, from the date of their foundation until 1903) were treated as belonging in every respect to the Indian inland system ; certain changes made in 1903, which will be described hereafter, were only partial, not affecting internal procedure; and the offices still aea with one another, and with offices in India, on practically the sam footing as if they were situated in India. In the present place we shall mention only questions of working which are more or less general to the whole division; and those wine affect single offices, or offices of a single political jurisdiction only, W1 be dealt with separately further on.2447 In 1877-79 a number of official letters addressed to officers in the Foreign Department of the Government of India by the Residents at Bushehr and Baghdad failed to reach their proper destinations, while others were greatly delayed in transmission, one from Bushehr being received in 61 instead of 20 days, and one from Baghdad in 49 instead of 28 days, after despatch. In more than one case duplicates specially sent to the Foreign Department in place of lost originals also dis appeared ; and in all 47 Persian Gulf letters and 5 Baghdad letters of the years 1877 and 1878 were missed. In 1879 there were two fresh cases of non-receipt. Some of the lost documents were important^ others unimportant. The correspondence of the Resident in the Persian Gulf with the Government of Bombay, however, continued to arrive with perfect regularity, and in one instance a registered letter reported missing was proved by means of the receipt to have reached the Foreign Department, from which circumstances it may be suspected that the correspondence in question was not really lost or delayed in the Post office, but mislaid after receipt (??). One of the special features of the Gulf postal division is a system of personal letter bags, which has been arranged by the postal author ities for the convenience of the British Consuls-General at Bushehr and Baghdad and of the Consuls at Masqat and Basrah. The system began on a request, made in 1882 by the Colonel Ross, Political Resident and Consul-General in the Persian Gulf, for a special bag which could be removed from the ship at the port most convenient for rapid delivery, and which should be treated in the same manner as the bags arranged for Her Majesty^s ships in the Gulf. Colonel Ross's request was granted, and the bag for the Resident in the Persian Gulf was at first made up at Bombay. In 1884 the Post Office^ of its own motion, provided similar bags for the other officers who at present enjoy the same privilege; and these special mails are now made up both by the Bomb ay-Karachi sea post office and by the post office at Karachi. Postal insurance was introduced in India from the 1st of January 1878 and was extended at the same time to the Persian Gulf offices; but the peculiar conditions under which trade is carried on in the Gulf led to unforeseen uses (and indeed abuses) of the insurance system, and ultimately necessitated its withdrawal. The facilities offered for the despatch of specie insured by post were taken advantage of by the Jewish and Armenian merchants of Baghdad, and to a lesser ex tent by those of Basrah, for sending money to Bombay—chiefly to Jewish firms—in payment for the drafts by means of which the remitters^ debts to foreign creditors were settled. The total value of the postal insur ances effected at Baghdad rose from Rs. 27,000 in 1878-79 to over 24 lakhs of rupees in 1882-83. In 1884 the Tigris and Euphrates Steam Navigation Company protested against this development of postal operations, on the ground that it not only robbed them of a large part of their income from the carriage of a specie but also saddled them with obligations more onerous than had been contemplated in the contract which they held for the carriage of the British mails. In 1884 the same question arose in a slightly different form in Bahrain, where the pearl merchants, immediately upon the institution of a post office there, Loss of Foreign Department correspond ence from the Persian Gulf and Baghdad., 1877-79. Personal letter bags, 1882-1907. Postal in surance, 1878-1907.2448 availed themselves of the insurance system for the despatch abroad of large quantities of valuable pearls. By this practice the British India Steam Navigation Company were the principal losers, and they too protested against the competition of the Post Office with their legitimate carrying trade. As the contentions of the two companies appeared to the Government of India to be reasonable and as there was considerable risk of loss of specie, especially in transhipment at Basrah or while deposited there in the unprotected post office, the faculty of insurance was abolished, with effect from the 1st of July 1885, in regard to articles despatched to, from or between the post offices of the Persian Gulf division. The aboli tion of insurance stimulated the demand for money orders ; but there was a loss of revenue to the post office which was estimated in the years immediately following the change at over Rs. 18,001) per annum and something like consternation at first prevailed among the native merch ants of Baghdad, whose established method of doing business was totally upset. Indian Cas- I n 1894, in consequence of the passing of the Indian Tariff Act, it m^ts^TsQl' Was or ^ ere( ^ ^hat all parcels despatched from the post offices of the Gulf I9Q7 # *' division should thenceforward be accompanied by customs declarations. Histories, in brief, of the various Indian post offices and postal stations in the Persian Gulf, 1864-1907. Before we pass on to consider political questions that have arisen in connection with British Indian post offices in Persia and Turkish ^Iraq it will be convenient to summarise separately the history of each of the Gulf offices.* Masqat, The post office at Masqat was opened on the 1st of May 1864, and 1864-1907. the duties of Postmaster were at first carried on, under the supervision or the Political Agent, by a subordinate of the Indian Medical Department, who was in medical charge of the British Agency ; the postal work was then transacted at a rented building in the town. In 1866, the disturbances which accompanied the accession of Salim to the Sult anate of ; Oman, no steamers called at iMasqat between March and July ; and the post office was temporarily closed. In 1869 it was found necessary, in consequence of the increase oi postal business, to appoint a, regular postmaster from India ; but the change gave rise to trouble which continued until 187a. The first Post master under the new system assumed independent powers vis a vts o the Political Agent and in 187^ accepted the local agency of the Oman Ottoman line of steamers—a Turkish interest; he was ultiinaey removed from the Masqat appointment and dismissed from the Posta Department. His successor proved corrupt and disrespectful and w aS transferred to another post. In 1871, during the struggle between Turki and 'Azzan in the neighbourhood of Masqat, the post office was # A fable of the exiating officeg in the Gulf, with particulars of staff, etc., tormi Annexure No. 3 to this Appendix.2449 II 164 located in the harbour for a few days on the barque ' Belle Isle ' from Sunderland. In 1873^ to obviate the administrative difficulties which had arisen^ accommodation was found for the post office on the ground floor of the British Agency^ and the postal staff was amalgamated with that of the Political Agent's office. In 1880^, in consequence of an increase in the regular work of the Agency establishment^ as also in the postal work^ the latter increase being due partly to the introduction of the money order system^ a separate official existence was once more given to the post office at Masqat; but it continued to be located in the Agency^ and the Postmaster remained subject to the authority of the Political Agent except in departmental matters^—an arrangement which still continues. In 1886 the Masqat office was deprived of the status of a head office^ which it had hitherto enjoyed^ and was reduced to that of a sub-office. At Masqat parcels arriving by post have from the beginning, in order to prevent smuggling, been delivered to the addressees at fixed times in the presence of a member of the Sultanas Customs Department. Newspapers which are considered objectional by the Sultan of Masqat have been, since March 1902, intercepted by the post office and consigned to the Dead Letter Office at Bombay. A post office was opened in Bahrain on the 1st August 1884 under Mr. (VShea, the first Superintendent of the Persian Gulf division ; it was located, until the appointment of a European political officer in Bahrain, in the house of the Residency Agent at Manamah, the commercial capital of the islands. Before this, from 1875 to 1881, the native agent of the British India Steam Navigation Company in Bahrain had received a small allowance from the Postal Department in considera tion of his discharging some of the functions of a post office; but his duties, though simple, were not satisfactorily performed. The abolition of postal insurance in Bahrain and the resultant increase in the money order business have already been mentioned. Commission on money orders in Bahrain was raised to two per cent, about 1890, on a complaint from the British India Steam Navigation Company that very large snms in specie were being carried in the mail bags between Bahrain and Bushehr, causing a loss to themselves in freight and a great increase in their responsibilities. The Shaikh of Kuwait in 1901 solicited the establishment of an Indian post office at his port; and when, in August 1904, a British Political Agent was posted to Kuwait, he was accompanied by an Assistant Surgeon, who was to attend, inter alia, to postal busi ness. No regular post office has as yet been inaugurated, on account of political difficulties ; but private and official letters are both despatched and received for distribution. In 1904 an Agreement^ of which the text will be found in Annexure No. 4 to this Appendix, was obtained from the Shaikh of Kuwait, that he would not allow the establishment of a post office at Kuwait by any foreign power except the British. There is not, and has never been, an Indian post office at Fao ; but bags made up by the Bombay-Karachi sea office and by the offices, at Bahrain, 1884-1907. Kuwait ■07. 1904 Fiio, 1907. 1867-2450 Karachi, Bushehr and Basrah for the staff of the British telegraph station at Fao, are regularly delivered there hj the mail steamers in passing. The Bombay-Karachi sea office and the Karachi office bags were insti tuted in 1904 to prevent delay at Boshehr; only paid unregistered corre spondence is enclosed in them, other articles being still bagged at Bushehr. The postal service at Fao began in 1867, in which year the place was made a port of call for the mail steamers. Until 18«6 letters, both paid and unpaid, for the Turkish officials at Fao and occasional letters for residents of Arab villages on the opposite bank of the Shatt-al- ; Arab were included in the bag sent from Basrah to Fao; but, as the telegraph officials had no means of distribution at their command and difficulty was experienced in recovering postage on unstamped letters, the practice was discontinued, except in the case of letters and packets for Turkish officials and departments entitled under agreement to free postage. The establishment of the office opened at Basrah on the 1st of January 1868 was among the results of Mr. Vears^s tour in the preced ing year; it w^as not however made permanent until July 1869. The management of the Basrah office was at first undertaken by the British Vice-Consul, with the assistance of a native clerk ; but by the end of 1870 public confidence had been attracted, and the work had increased to such an extent that a regular postmaster with a sufficient staff was appointed from India. In 1872, the ^ ice Consulate, which had hitherto been located at Kut-al-Farangi, was removed to its present site lower down the Shatt- al-^Arab, and the post office was transferred with it; but a branch office, which the Postmaster had opened without sanction at his private residence in the native quarter, continued to serve the town of Basrah. On the arrival of a mail the letters for the European settlement, adjoin ing the new V ice-Consulate, were distributed first, and the remainder were carried by the Postmaster to his office in the town for distribution; the outgoing mail also^ was dealt with in a similar fashion. The existence of the post office in the town was not apparently discovered bj the Postal Department until 1882, in which year an inspecting officer from Bombay, oblivious of the consular character of the post office, caused a pillar box for letters to be set up in the Suq Kadhim Agha and so further complicated the situation. The Turkish Government were at this time trying to obtain the suppression of the British post offices in Turkey and specifically requested the abolition of the Basrah town office; as, however, the office had existed for 15 years without objection, it w as deemed inexpedient that it should be closed on the mere demand of the Turkish Government; but the pillar box was removed in 1883 by the Vice-Consul of his own motion. In 1882-83, the Consul having to some extent dissociated himself from the affairs of the post office, the postmaster assumed airs of inde pendence, corresponded direct with Turkish officials, and for some time earned a red ensign at the stern of the boat which he employed; these proceedings led to his summary removal and to the passing of orders by the Government of India in 1884, which we have already described elsewhere. In 1887, suitable quarters for the postmaster having been tound m the neighbourhood of the Consulate, the town-office was closed2451 without reference to the TurVish demands; but the change, though satisfactory to the British political and postal authorities, was unwelcome to the native merchants of Basrah, who even presented a petition for its restoration. At Hasrah quarantine against India is now chronic, and, except when it is temporarily suspended, the mail from India is taken to the Bureau Sanitaire to be fumigated before being sent to the post office; the Bureau is at a place about quarter of a mile from the British Yice- Consulate. The post office at Baghdad also owed its origin to Mr. Years; it was opened experimentally on the same day as the office at Basrah- the 1st of January 1868 and became permanent in June 1869. It was placed at first in charge of the senior clerk of the residency staff, and this arrangement lasted until 1879, when, in conse quence of the heavy work entailed by postal insurance, then recently introduced, and by the money order system which was to come into force from the 1st of J anuary 1880, it was found necessary to appoint a trained Postmaster from India ; but until 1884 one of the residency clerks continued to draw an allowance for assisting in postal work. The introduction of postal insurance at Baghdad in 1877 and its abolition in 1885 have already been noticed in the paragraph on the general working of the offices of the Persian Gulf division. With effect from the 1st of July 1904 the Baghdad office was raised from the status of a sub-office to that of a head office, and from the same date the accounts of the office began to be kept in Tm'kish instead of in Indian currency*, the rate of exchange between Lirah and rupee being altered, as necessary from time to time, by the Political Resident; one object of this arrangement was to defeat the manoeuvres of Baghdad speculators, who were accustomed to make a profit out of the post office by sending money orders m one direction or the other according to the state of exchange; and another reason was the prohibition by the Turkish Government of the importation of foreign silver coin.t Muhammareh remained for a long time without steamer com munication or proper postal arrangements. In 1889 the opening of a British post office at Muhammareh was suggested by the British Yice-Consul at Basrah ; in 1890 Mu ammare became a port of call for the steamers of the British India Company on their return voyage to India; and, in October of the same year, as no special restrictions were then imposed by a visit to Muhammareh, a call upon introduced.

Bushehr, 1864-1905, Lingeh, 1867-1905. Steamer communication on the Karun River between Muhammareli and Ahwz having been opened by the Euphrates and Tigris Steam iSavigation Company, letters addressed to Muhammareh began to be posted at Basrah. ^ The British Vice-Consul at Basrah arranged at nist £or^ their distribution at IVluhammareh through the agents of the steamship company; but the necessity for a regular post office at JMuhammareh soon became evident, and one was instituted on the 19tli of July 1892. A Persian Post Office had been opened there in February 1892, and in 1892-93 a Persian postal service between Muhammareh, Shushtar and Dizful was established ; this service collapsed in November lb94 for want of funds, but it was subsequently re-established. 1 he Indian post office at Muhammareh has been from the first under purely departmental management; but it is located in the British Consulate building, and the Consul exercises a general supervision and decides questions that are referred to him. There is no regular British post office at Nasiri, but, since the opening of a British Vice-Consulate there in 1905, the Vice-Consul's mails are carried overland between Muhammareh and Nasiri, and vice versa, by couriers who are maintained as a part of his official establish ment. The Bushehr post office shares with that of Masqat the honour of priority in the Persian Gulf; it was opened on the same date, the 1st of May 1864. r lhere was then no Persian post office, and the delivery of letters, not only in Bushehr but also in some of the adjoin ing villages presumably only those of the peninsula, was undertaken by the Indian post office, and in 1869 a special postman was added to the staff for the better performance of this duty. The Bushehr post office was established within the precincts of the British Residency, where it has since remained; and it has been subject from the first to the control of the Political Resident. At Bushehr occurred one of the very few discreditable incidents belonging to the history of the Indian post office in the Persian Gulf. In 1886 the postmastership was held by an Asiatic who had served the British Government for upwards of 20 years, first as an interpreter in the Indo-European Telegraph Department and then for about 15 years in the Postal Department. A serious accumulation of unadjusted accounts having been observed, the removal of the post master was directed and a departmental enquiry was ordered, though there was as yet no suspicion of fraud. The enquiry, however, showed that ^ the posmaster had been guilty during several months in 1886 of misapplying Government money, and that he had committed defalca tions amounting to upwards of Rs. 5,000. H e was subsequently tried by the Sessions Court of Bombay and sentenced to six years' rigorous imprisonment. The office at Lingeh was established on the 1st of April 1867, on the recommendation of Mr. Vears ; it was located at first on the sea-front, later at the back of the town, and finallv, in 187l&gt;a ouse engaged by the Residency Agent upon the seashore about iOl yards from the Customs house. So long as the British occupationb^ndac 'Abbas, 1867-1905. of Basidu was maintained, a boat was sent from that station to meet each mail steamer, and, although there was no post office at Basidu, an exchange of mails was carried on ; these arrangements ceased with the abandonment of the Basidu station in May 1883. The most notable event in the history of the Lingeh post office is a burglary which occurred on the night of the 21st of April 189S ; the post office safe was broken into, and cash amounting to more than Rs. 5,000 was stolen. In consequence of this robbery, for which the Persian Government declined to acknowledge any responsibility, the rate of commission on money orders was raised at Lingeh to two per cent., in order to check the accumulation of money, and a permanent guard of three Persian soldiers was obtained on payment. General supervision of the Lingeh sub-office, which is undei Bushehr, is exercised by the Political Resident at Bushehr through the Residency Agent at Lingeh. The post office at Bandar 'Abbas was opened, concurrently with that at Lingeh, on the 1st of April 1867 ; not only the mercantile community but also the Persian Governor of Bandar Abbas had begged for its establishment ; and it was from the first in every respect a success, the income largely exceeding the expenditure. From a station of the Indo-European Telegraph Department which existed on an islet in Khor-ash-Sham (Elphinstone Inlet) on the opposite or Arabian coast from 1864 to 1868, a boat used to be sent to Bandar 'Abbas to meet the mail steamer, 'here was no post office at ' Telegraph Isletbut the Postmaster of Bandar Abbas received for despatch the mails sent from the telegraph station, and despatched in return such articles as were received m his office addressed to Telegrap Islet.' , In 188* a Persian post office was established at Bandar 'Abbas and a system of Anglo-Persian co-operation was arranged, m regard to mails for the interior, which is described further on m the paragraph on politi cal questions. In 1884 to avoid the consignment to the Dead Letter Office or numerous letters addressed to Qishm via Bandar 'Abbas, a letter box was set up in Qishm town near the residence of the Shaikh and was visited S . wiibj . postman bom B.nto 'Abba.; «... mojuro w„ pecuniarily a success and was a great boon to e ra a g had relations with Bombay and Karac l - e i,,, , Indian discontinued in 1903, in consequence of the delivery of le ^®' B ^ T post offices in Persia being restricted to the precincts of po t offices. Informal postal arrangements existed at Jashk from the fo^da jon ^ of the telegraph station at that place in 1868 mitd the ^ ^ 1880 when a regular post office was established. Previously to 1880 the Assistant Superintendent in charge of discharged the duties of: postmaster ; and since 1 performed bv one of the telegraph clerks, on an allowance provided by the Postal Department. Thf jLk office has little business b^s^ which depends on the presence of the telegrap s a a . ^ . 0 ] asge d military detachment. For the sake of simplicity in working it is classed i ^ 12454 not as a sub-office but as a branch office ; it is authorised^ however, to transact British postal order and Indian money order business through the head office at Karachi. The post office at Gwadar was established on the 12th of April 1868 ; and has undergone many vicissitudes of management; before its establish ment postal work had been carried on in an informal way by the Assist ant Political Agent posted to Gwadar in 1863, who received mails made up by the Karachi and Masqat offices and in return made up mails for those offices. The G-wadar post office was at first worked as a sub-office by departmental agency and occupied a separate shed; but in 1873-74 the management was made over to the Indo-European Telegraph Department, the duties of postmaster being thereafter performed by one of the telegraph clerks and the office itself being transferred to a room in the telegraph buildings. This- arrangement only lasted a year, for the unhealthiness of Gwadar necessitated frequent transfers of the telegraph clerks, and the postal work suffered from the repeated changes of personnel. In 1884, however, the working of the office was re-transferred to the Indo-Luropean Telegraph Department, with whom it remained until the abolition of the sub-post a telegraph station in 1893 on account of its unhealthiness ; a sub-postmaster from India then took charge. On the 5th of April 1895 telegraphic communication by land line having meanwhile been re-established at Gwadar, a combined post and telegraph sub-office which had existed on an experimental footing since October 1894, was made permanent, and this office still remains. Owing to the insalubrity of the station and the frequent illness or absence of the individual in charge it was found necessary, in 1899, to revise the terms of the appointment in such a manner as to improve the pay of acting substitutes, , Duty is not levied at Gwadar on parcels addressed to employes of the British Government; but it is collected on all other parcels by the customs officials of the Sultan of 'Oman.

At this period two services between BOshehr and the interior, initia- Inland ted apparently in 186-i, were maintained by the British authorities; the first was a weekly or fortnightly line between Bushehr and Shiraz, passing through the stations of the Indo-European Telegraph Depart ment ; the second, generally known as the Legation Chapar, was a four- weekly line between Bushehr and Tehran, running via Shiraz and Isfahan. From Bushehr to Shiraz (180 miles) the mail bags, partly on account of the difficulty of the track and partly for the sake of economy, were carried by Qasids or foot-runners, borne on the establishment of the Bushehr Residency ; but from Shiraz to Isfahan (300 miles) and from Isfahan to Tehran (2SO miles) they were conveyed by Ghulams of the Tehran Legation, who were mounted on horses hired from the Persian Chapar service. No charge was made for carriage by the Legation Chapar even of letters totally unpaid ; but after 1870, in consequence of an agreement between the authorities concerned, prepayment at Indian inland rates by means of Indian stamps was required in the case of letters posted in India for places in Persia or in Persia for places in India; and at the same time unpaid letters arriving in India from Bushehr or at the Bushehr post office from India were made subject to the ordinary rules of the Indian Post Office. A small delivery fee, which had always been recovered at the places in the interior served through Bushehr, was maintained to cover the cost of carriage in India and between India and Bushehr, but letters for telegraph stations were delivered free, and Persian officials who were permitted to use the line enjoyed the privilege of franking their correspondence. The Legation Ghulams were not prohibited from carrying letters, otherwise than in the Legation bag, for other employers; and the Ghulams between Tehran and ^iraz sometimes earned as much as Bs. 100 by this means in a single journey. It should be mentioned that there existed, side by side with the Legation Mail, a Chapar or horse post irregularly worked by the Persian Government between Shiraz and Tehran; the rarson d'etre of this line was the carriage of Persian Government despatches, but specie, parcels and letters were also accepted from private individuals for transmission. Special fees were charged on this Persian line for valuables ; but the rates for letters were fixed and ranged from 1 to 2 Qrans. Ejtabliah- ment d a. Persian Post al Depart In 1875 it was announced that the Persian Government intended to establish a postal administration of their own, and that they had improvised a postage stamp and engaged an Austrian postal official. In July 18/6 ^ ^ this employe, who had meanwhile succeeded in instituting a postal service 1875 between Tehran and Kurope via Tabriz, was appointed to the Director- 1877. ship-General of Persian Posts. In August 18/7, after the Government of India had been consulted by the Director of the International Office at Berne and had agreed to the proposal on certain conditions, Persia was admitted to membership of the International Postal Union with effect from the 1st of September 1877 In February 1878 an agreement for the interchange of closed mails was concl ded between Persia and the Oovernment of India, of which the following were the principal provisions: — a2456 Abolition 'of the Indian service between Bilslielir and the in terior, 1877. Establish ment of a (1) tliat on the Indian side the post office at Bombay and the Indian post office at Bushehr should be offices of exchange ; (2) that all correspondence for India^ and for countries served through India^ should be placed by the Persian post office in a closed mail for Bombay ; (8) that all correspondence for places in the Persian Gulf and for Basrah and Baghdad in Turkish ^Iraq should be sent in a closed mail to the Indian post office at Bushehr for sorting and despatch to the Indian post offices at those places ; and (4) that correspondence between India and Persia should be subject to certain special Union rates of postage. The first Director-General of Persian Posts organised an efficient system and placed it in a good working order; but he was dissatisfied with his position and resigned it at the end of his three years^ contract. A Russian, who had been his assistant^ succeeded him and maintained the efficiency of the postal system but was wrongfully* dismissed on a charge of peculation^ which was not established; and in 1880 the management fell into the hands of unqualified persons—French, Armenians^ Persians^ and others. The immediate result was disorgani sation, which at one time threatened a total collapse ; but eventually, in 189 the services as Inspector-General of M. Arnold, a German account ant j were secured^ and a state of comparative efficiency was restored. Au early result of the foundation of a Persian Post Office was the abolition of the quasi-public mail service maintained by the British and Indian Governments between Bushehr and the interior. In 1^76^ after the appointment of the first Director-General of Persian Posts_, a proposal was made^, apparently at his instance^ that the British Indian postmaster at Bushehr should be placed in charge also of a Persian post office at the same place ; and that the British arrangements for the carriage of mails between Bushehr and Tehran should ^be utilised to supplement others which the Persian Postal Department was about to introduce; both requests were however courteously declined by the British authorities. At the beginning of 1877, before the entry of Persia into the International Postal Union^ the Persian Government notified to the British Legation at Tehran that they had instituted a weekly post between Bushehr and Tehran^ and at the same time they asked that the Persian and British mails should be interchanged at Bushehr, and that all postal matter transmitted to or from the interior should in future be sent by the Persian mail; these proposals^ as will be seen from the agreement of February 1878 already quoted above, were accepted in so far as they related to the interchange of mails at Bushehr ; and^ though the British official up-country mail was continued, private correspondence was no longer allowed to be sent by its means, and the quasi-public postal service of the British and Indian Governments in Persia ceased. In 1882 a Persian^ post office was opened at Bandar ^Abbas ; and direct postal communication was opened by the Persian Government * The Persian Government had, in the end, to compensate him by paying him the amount of his salary for the unexpired period of his contract. % t!245? between that place and Yazd^ Tehran^ Mashhad and other towns of Persia. Interchange of mails on the same principles as at Bushehr was immediately after this arranged between the Indian and the Persian post offices at Bandar ^Abbas. At Bandar ''Abbas addresses not written in Persian are translated by the Indian office before the mail is handed over to the Persian postmaster. Notwithstanding the organisation of a Persian Postal Department^ the British Indian post offices on the coast of the Gulf continued to exist; and for a number of years no changes were made in their working, except such as naturally resulted at Bushehr from the abolition of the quasi-public service to Shiraz and beyond; at each office mails were still collected for despatch to the other ofeces of the Persian Gulf division and to India^ and mails were received from the same quarters and were dis tributed locally. In all cases postage was charged at Indian inland rates and was paid by means of Indian stamps. There were thus ano malies of procedure which it was not likely that the Persian Post Office, under European management, would long tolerate without protest; but no complaints appear to have been received until 1901, by which year the successful development of the Persian Imperial Customs under Belgian management had suggested to the Shah^s ministers the advan tage of restricting, so far as possible, foreign privileges which trenched upon the revenue or the authority of Persian Departments. In 1901, M. Arnold, who was now described as Administrator General of Persian Posts, called in question the propriety of a public mail service between places in Persia being carried on, as it was in part, by the Indian Post Office; his complaint referred to the interchange of Indian mails between the ports of the Persian Gulf at which there were Indian offices. Persian mails were interchanged between the same places; but the Persian offices received less patronage, even from the Persian public, as their rates were higher; and the Persian offices in the Gulf were at this time worked at a loss. The justice of M. Arnold's objections having been recognised by the Government of India, it was arranged that the Indian post offices at the ports of Muhammareh^ Bushehr^ Bandar ^Abbas and Lingeh should not in future accept postal matter intended for delivery at any place in Persia, and that articles posted at the Indian post office in contravention of the new orders should be treated as unpaid and transferred to the local Persian offices for disposal. Early in 1902, on receipt of information that Persian offices had been opened at Jashk and Chahbar, th3 same regulation was applied to the Indian post off ce at Jashk. Articles franked by British political and consular officers were, however^ exempted from the operation of these orders, and remained subject to the old regime. In 1902, apparently by way of assimilating the practice in Persia to that followed in Turkish 'Iraq, orders were issued to all the Indian post offices in Persian territory to discontinue sending letters for delivery out of the post office, except such as were addressed to high officers of the British or Persian Governments or to foreign consular officers. The abolition of the delivery at Qishm and of the town and suburban delivery at Bushehr was necessitated by this prohibition Since 1902 all deliveries have been effected within the precincts of the Persian service be tween Bandar 'Abbas and the interior, 1882.

British offices, except in the case of non-local letters, which are handed to the Persian post office for disposal; local letters not called for within three weeks are returned to the Dead Letter Office. The first practice of the Indian Post Office in Persia to be called in question by the recently reformed Persian Post Office, of which the management had been transferred to the Persian Imperial Customs in 1902, was the carriage of correspondence to and from India, and between the offices of the Persian Gulf division, at Indian inland rates. The point- was raised by M. Naus, the Belgian Director-General of Posts and Customs, who represented that, in consequence of the Indian inland rates being lower than the Union rates adopted by Persia, the Persian post office was being subjected to unfair competition. To meet the wishes of the Persian Directoi General, and to put an end to an anomaly which might have compromised the position of the Indian Post offices in Persia, the demand was conceded ; and from the 1st of June 1903 the correspon dence in question was made subject to the foreign rates and rules of the Indian Post Office. Parcels and British official covers were still, up to 1907, allowed to pass at the old rates; but no express or permanent concession was granted in this respect. The habitual use of Indian stamps in Persian territory was a delicate matter, which could not long, in the circumstances, remain out of controversy. As early as 1890 objections had been raised by the Persian Post Office to the franking with Indian stamps at Bandar ^Abbas of letters addressed to places in Persian territory on the Persian Gulf; and the use of Indian stamps for this purpose has now been forbidden. In 1904 M. Dambrain, Director-General of Customs and Post Offices on the Persian Coast, forwarded to the British Indian Postmaster the cover of an official letter sent him by the British Consul at Bandar 'Abbas through the Indian post office, and claimed payment of postage on the ground that the letter had been prepaid with Indian instead of Persian stamps. The claim was referred to the British Legation at Tehran, but up to 1907 no decision on the point had been reached. In 1905 the question of the stamps to be used on letters sent abroad was suddenly raised at Muhammareh. Hitherto letters posted at other places in Persia and stamped with Persian stamps had been accepted by the British Indian Post Offices for transmission abroad; but the use of Indian stamps on foreign letters posted at places where an Indian office existed had been rigorously insisted on, and by a tacit understanding the Persian post offices at such places had hitherto declined to receive any letters for abroad. It was this system which the Persian post office now sought to upset ; but their demands were resisted by the British diplo matic and consular authorities in Persia, and in 1907 the matter was still unsettled. The question of the parcel post, to which we have not as yet had occasion to allude, has, since the transfer of the Persian postal system to the management of the Customs Department, engendered differences more acrimonious than those arising from the letter post. r lhe first arrangement for an exchange of parcels between India and Persia was introduced on the 1st of July 1893. The British Indian and as2459 'f stoi® ! persian post offices at Bushehr were constituted offices of excliange, the former receiving Re. 1 for everv parcel sent from Persia^ and the latter Rs. 2-8-0 for each parcel sent to Persia. From the 1st of November 1898, the German Post Office began to exchange closed parcel ba^s with the Persian post office through the intermediacy of the Indian post office, which received a transit fee at the rate of a francs per parcel for its services. The interchange of both parcels and letters was only once interrupted at Bushehr in the spring of 1897 ; when the Persian Post Office, from fear of plague, for a few days refused to accept any mails from the Indian otfice; an assurance however that the mails were thoroughly disinfected sufficed to remove their scruples. When Persia joined the Parcel Post Union in 1903 the former arrangements were brought to an end ; and from the 1st of October in that year a parcel service on the ordinary international lines was insti tuted. Its operations were restricted—in the part of Persia with which we are concerned—to Muhammareh, Bushehr, Lingeh, Bandar Abbas, Jashk and Chahbar j but the Persian post offices at those places under took to convey the parcels to the interior of Persia and to recover the charges for conveyance inland from the addressees. The Indian post offices at Mnhammareh, Lingeh, Bandar J Abbas and Jashk were constitut ed offices of exchange, at first for parcels received from the Persian pos office and subsequently for parcels exchanged in both directions. Parcels from India intended for delivery at the places named above can now be prepaid either at Indian inland or at union rates at the option ot the sender; those prepaid at union rates are transferred on arrival to t e Persian post office for disposal. Trouble in connection with the parcel post arose at Bushehr in 1904 ; it was due to an intemperate onslaught by the Imperial Persian Customs on an established practice whereby, at that place, the Indian parcel mails were conveyed direct between the ship and Indian Post ortice. The dispute was not confined to the parcel mail but related also to the letter mail, which, so the Persian Customs and Persian postal offi^als contended, ought on landing to be handed over to the Persian Post Office The claim was based upon certain clauses of the Beglement Douamer ot 1904: but the British authorities refused to admit it, and argued that the old established privileges of the Indian Post Office had a political origin and history, and could not therefore be abrogated by a merely commercial arrangement such as the Reglement. The progress and final settlement of this contest at Bushehr, and of a similar but less important one at Muhammareh, are related m the Appendix on the Imperial Persian Customs and need not be described again m this place. In the end it was arranged that the Indian parcels should be conveyed direct, as formerly, between the mail steamers an ^ e Indian post office; but increased facilities were given to the Persian authorities for satisfyin , themselves that dutiable articles weie no smug gled into Persia by the Indian post. Hardly had this matter_ been settled when the Persian Customs raised a fresh difficulty by claiming that samples arriving by pos be treated as parcels and submitted for their examination. On the one D is mite con cerning the Indian sam ple post in Persia, 1905,2460 suggested postal con vention between IndiU and Persia. 1904. Articles pro hibited Persia. m hand the demand was in accordance with a clause of the Reglement Douanier of 1904); on the other, as the letter mail was not subject to inspection by the Customs^ compliance would have involved the^ elimi nation of sample packets from the letter mail, a procedure which could not be demanded in accordance with Union rules. M. Naus Minister of Customs and Posts^, represented that there was considerable danger of the sample post ^ being- abused for purposes of trade, and he pressed hard for a revised classification of mails in this respect; but in face of the British opposition he was unable to carry his point. The failure of the Persian Ministry of Customs and posts to get the better of the Indian Post Office in the three disputes with which we have dealt seems to have convinced them of the necessity for a new and more conciliatory policy. In May 1905, M. Naus expressed a strong desire to conclude with the Grovernment of India a postal convention which should settle all doubtful points and remove every cause of friction ; he suggested that an officer of the Indian Post Office should be deputed to Tehran for the purpose. The idea was favourably received by Sir A. Hardinge, British Minister at Tehran, and in June 1905 he was authorised by His Majesty^s Government to make, in consultation with the Government of India, a postal arrangement with Persia which should follow the lines of procedure observed by the British post office at Constantinople. The Government of India, on being consulted, declared their reluctance to engage in any negotiations which might result in the abrogation or curtailment of the privileges enjoyed by the Indian Post Office in Persia; they suggested the postponement of the discussion; and they urged that its scope should be confined to the question of the parcel post. The matter is still pending. Newspapers forbidden by the Persian Government have been liable, since 1899, to be intercepted by the Indian post offices and sent to the Dead Letter Office; but at the present moment there is no prohibited journal. Political and quasi-political questions connected with the Indian Post Office in Turkish Iraq, 1868-1907. Having completed the history of the Indian Post Office in Persia, we return to the period during which its arrangements took shape in Turkish ^Iraq. In 1867, at the time of Mr. Vears's tour, a rudimentary mail service of a very unsatisfactory character already existed, under the manage ment of the British political officials, at Basrah and at Baghdad. A mail bag containing letters for Basrah and Baghdad was made up at Bombay and closed for Basrah ; and this, along with letters placed in the ship^s letter-box at intermediate ports in the Gulf, was simply handed over to the Vice-Consul at Basrah for disposal. The arrangements in the reverse direction were of a similarly haphazard character, and nearly all the letters carried were unstamped, with the exception of those posted India itself. 1 in2461 The scheme for the establishment of regular British Indian post Original ao- offioes at Basrah and Baghdad received, in 1868, the cordial support of ^TTn^ish Sir A. Kemball ; Political Resident in Turkish. ^Iraq. Its execution was Government facilitated by the non-existence of a Turkish postal service^ and by the in the consequent absence of political opposition on the part of the Turks ; and arrange- the mail boxes and bags were landed, without objection or interference ^ggg 8 ' on the part of the Turkish customs officials, at the Vice-Consulate at Basrah and at the Kesidency at Baghdad. On the 25th of January 1868, Sir A. Kemball informed the Wali of Baghdad of the new arrangements and promised that the public correspondence of certain Turkish Government departments and officials should be carried free by the British post between Baghdad, Basrah and even Bombay, on condi tion that the official covers should be franked with the seal of the despatching department and should not contain private letters. These conditions were accepted both by the Wali and by the Indian Post Office, and the understanding, presumably, still holds good ; but the Turkish Departments do not now exercise the privilege accorded to them. For some time after 1868 Indian postage stamps were sold on board the steamers of the Euphrates and Tigris Company, and letters were delivered by the steamers at Qurnah, 'Amarah, ^ Ali-al-Gharbi and Kut-al- Amarah, as well as at other places where they touched. Stamped letters were also received on board the steamers for delivery at, or despatch through, Baghdad and Basrah. Various postal agencies and lines were maintained or established in Service at connection with the two British Indian post offices in Turkish Iraq. ^ e A regular delivery of letters was undertaken in the town of Baghdad, and an ^ letters for Kadhimain were kept in deposit until fetched by the 0 ^j ier pi HCeg addressees. * 3 ' n Turkish f t j* 1 q a £ Letters from India for Karbala, where a number of Indian Muham- madans are settled, were at first sent monthly from Baghdad to the care of the Honorary Native Political Agent at Karbala, who arranged for their distribution; under this arrangement, which seems to have begun about 1866, the mail was carried by two messengers, who were enter tained from the Oudh Bequest Fund for the purpose of maintaining official communication. In 1878 the Karbala mail was made weekly; but afterwards the service became irregular, and letters were sent out only ^ as opportunities occurred; and in 1887/at the request of the Turkish authorities the Residency ceased to forward private letters to Karbala. While dealing with the subject of Karbala, we may mention that after May 1894 correspondence received from abroad for Karbala r Najaf, Musal and other places in Turkish ■'Iraq was, for a time, transferred for distribution to the Turkish Post Office and that correspondence from those places for abroad has since then been received from the Turkish Post Office for transmission under Union rules ; but in 1898, in consequence of several registered letters for Karbala having been tampered with xn the Turkish post, arrangements were made for the retention of registered letters for Karbala and Najaf m the Indian post office at Baghdad until the addressees could appoint agents to take delivery at Baghdad. At the present time lists of the registered letters received at Baghdad are sent unofficially to the British V ice-Consul at Karbala in order that the2462 addressees may be informed | and the letters are not returned to India as unclaimed until the expiry of a month. Servioe A mail line very similar to that between Bushehr and Tehran existed from 1S64 ; or earlier, until about 1880 between Baghdad and Tehran; Tehran ^ ^ passed through Kirmanshah and Hamadan, and the principal stage 1864-1907. was Kirmanshah, corresponding in some respects to Shiraz upon the Bushehr-Tehran line. Between Baghdad and Kirmanshah (210 miles) the mail was carried by footmen, and between Kirmanshah and Tehran (290 miles) by a mounted couriers belonging to the establishment of the British Legation in Persia. At the beginning of 1870, as on the Bushehr-Tehran line, postage at Indian rates between Baghdad and Tehran was imposed; but letters forwarded by the British Legation at Tehran and those exchanged between a Persian Princes and N otables residing at Tehran and Baghdad ^ were carried free. Some 25 years later the ' British Haghdad-Tehran line was abolished; and since then correspondence by this route has been carried on, within the Turkish frontier, exclusively by the Turkish Post Office. In 1904, nevertheless, the British Consul at Kirmanshah having pointed out that communication with India was more rapid through Baghdad than through Tehran, it was ordered that correspondence for Kirmanshah should in future be sent via Baghdad unless specially superscribed for transmission via Tehran. The ' Desert 33 or u Dromedary 33 post from Baghdad to Damascus and Bairut, which existed before the installation of any regular post office at Baghdad, was never incorporated with the Indian postal system ; but it survived the development of modern postal arrangements for a time, • and its later history calls for notice. In 1818 the Political Resident at Baghdad, by whom the line was managed, was permitted to levy ' postage 33 at fixed rates on articles sent by it; and a grant of lis. 200 a month was sanctioned by the Government of India to supplement the receipts from this source, and to enable the line to be efficiently worked. In 1868 the mails by the desert route were carried on camels over the 500 miles between Baghdad and Damascus and by special horsemen over the 100 miles between Damascus and Bairut; they reached Syria on the average in 9 days, Egypt in 13 or 14, and Europe—via Egypt and Smyrna—in 24 to 27 days; and the monthly cost of the service was Ks. 489. In 1869 the Ottoman authorities demanded that the Baghdad mails should be conveyed between Damascus and Bairut on a line then lately established by means of a subsidised French diligence ; but the British Consulate at Damascus, in view of the unreliability of the new Turkish post, preferred the old arrangement, and it was for some time maintained. In 1881, in the course of a campaign which they had then begun to wage against the British mail service m Turkey, the Ottoman Government established a camel post of their own between Baghdad and Damascus ; it ran side by side with the British consular post and carried letters at a loss at Union rates. Already in 1871 ? the Government of India, for purely financial reasons, had withdrawn their subsidy; and, partly for this reason and partly because of the competition of the Turkish camel post ; the Baghdad- Bairut line fell into difficulties : its finances by 1885 had sunk to a low ebb. In July 1886 the British desert line was finally abolished; and2463 in March 1887 the Turkish Government^ perhaps as having achieved what was their real purpose at the time^ closed their own line also. In 1889, however, the Turus re-opened the post route by Damascus and Bairut, a dromedary thereafter leaving Baghdad every Thursday; and in M ay 1906 Aleppo was substituted for Damascus as the principal Syrian station. The courier on this line is occasionally robbed, or dies of intense cold or. heat, by the way; but the mail, in such cases, is generally recovered after a time : and this post is now habitually used by the mercantile community at Baghdad. A Tatar post for Constantinople via Musal and Diyarbakr also leaves Baghdad every Monday. We come now to a series of persistent endeavours, made by the Porte Attempt hj between 1878 and 1887, to oust the Indian Post Office from Turkish the Turkish t - n Government . i n i n p obtain the These begna at the International Postal Conterence held at rans m abolition of 1878, where the Ottoman delegates urged the suppression of all foreign the Indian post offices in the Turkish dominions ; the proposal was one which affected post offices, Great Britain, France, Oermany, Austria and Italy; and the Conference declined to entertain it on the ground that it involved diplomatic consi- ^^ihoent 6 derations and therefore lay beyond their scope. By adhering to the the i r m .j. Paris Postal Convention of 1878 Turkey succeeded in acquiring a more vileges, 1878* respectable, but entirely undeserved international status in postal matters. 1905. In 1881 the latent antipathy of the Turks to the Indian Post Office 1881-82. was translated into action and showed itself in official competition with the British Baghdad-Damascus service, to which allusion has already been made, and in a small matter connected with the delivery of parcels at Baghdad. In the same year the abolition of the British desert post was requested by the Porte, both at Baghdad and through the British Ambassador at Constantinople; but the demand was successfully resisted. In 1882 the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs recurred to the subject and pressed for the abolition not only of the desert post but also of the Indian post offices at Baghdad and Basrah; the demand was however withdrawn for the time, and a promise was even given that it would not be urged. In 1883 the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs attempted to 1883. renew the discussion on the subject of the British desert post, but the British Embassy took their stand on the promise given in the previous year and the matter dropped. The Turks about the same time resorted to local obstruction and made a half-hearted attempt, which was not successful, to detain at Qurnah the Euphrates and Tigris Company's steamer ' Khalifah ' proceeding with mails from Basrah to Baghdad ; a crisis and negotiations followed, during which H.M.S. 'Woodlark' was kept at Basrah in readiness for emergencies. On the 20th of August 1883, while those negotiations were still pending the Wali of Baghdad demanded the abolition of the town office and letter box maintained by the Indian Post Office at Basrah, both of which have already mentioned in the history of the Basrah post office; and he caused a notice to be posted up, forbidding the use of any but Turkish post offices and ordering the exclusive use of Turkish stamps under penalty of a fine of one to five Lirahs. The penalty was in one or two instances actually enforced, and some consternation was caused among the merchants and. Turkish officials2464 who had been accustomed to make use of the Indian Post Office for the transmission of valuables and letters of importance. On the 29th of August 1883 the Wali of Baghdad complained of the refusal of the Indian post office at Basrah to accept from the Turkish Post Office letters for India and other foreign countries unless stamped with Indian stamps. On the 11th of September 1888 the contest was renewed at Constantinople by a futile demand on the part of the Ottoman Government ' for suppression of the service with regard to the transport of letters and correspondence between Basrah and Baghdad by Messrs. Lynch &amp; Co/s steamers. 33 A partial concession was made to Turkish objections by the discontinuance of house-to-house distribution of letters from the Indian post offices at Baghdad and Basrah and by the substi tution of a window delivery; but the carriage of letters of Turkish subjects from Baghdad and Basrah to various river-bank places on the Tigris continued until February 1886^ after which it ceased and such letters^ when received by the British, were transferred to the Turkish Post Office. 1884, In 1884 the Porte returned to the charge with a Memorandum drawn up by their Director General of Posts and Telegraphs; this manifesto laid stress on the equality of the postal position of Turkey with that of the other nations which had joined the Postal Union; proclaimed the ability of the Turkish Post Office to cope with the entire mail arrange ments of Turkish •'Iraq; demanded the cessation of the British desert post; and asserted a liability on the part of the Euphrates and Tigris Company^ steamers to carry the Turkish mails free of charge between Baghdad and Basrah. The last contention, though a paragraph of the Paris Conven- t. tion was quoted in its support, was ill-founded; and the Ottoman demands were rejected in their entirety on the broad ground that they would entail a loss of facility in postal communication between India and Turkish ■'Iraq. Also in 1884, a system of searching passengers who disembarked from British steamers on the Tigris for letters not bearing Turkish stamps was introduced, but it was soon discontinued in conse quence of diplomatic representations made at Constantinople. 1885-87. In 1885 and 1887 fresh efforts were made by the Turkish Govern ment to obtain the abolition of the Indian post offices at Baghdad and Basrah, but, like those which had preceded them, they were abortive. 1893-1901. From 1893 onwards local letters posted at Baghdad for Basrah and j, vice versa were transferred to the Turkish post office for disposal; j formerly a quantity of correspondence between those and intermediate places had been carried free, in an irregular manner, by the steamers of ^ the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company. A scheme E of procedure suggested by the Turkish Post Office in 1894, which would have resulted in the virtual closure of the British Office at | Baghdad, was successfully thwarted. a Ship^s letters'', i .e., letters | containing bills of lading, etc., or relating to cargo on board, continued i to be carried unstamped by the Company's vessels until 1901, when j| portable letter-boxes were provided on board by the Ottoman Post Office for the reception of such covers; no use however was made of ^ the boxes, and after some months they were withdrawn. In 1901, m consequence of a difficulty made by the Turkish post office at Jiddah fkt In 1882 ^plaints \2465 regarding the delivery of a registered letter posted at the Indian post office at Basrah, the Indian postmasters at Baghdad and Basrah were directed not in future to accept for registration letters addressed to places in Turkish territory, if deliverable through a Turkish office. In 1903, when the Indian post to and from Persia was made 1903. subject to the rates and rules for foreign correspondence, the Indian poet offices in Turkish ■'Iraq were brought under the same regime ; but British official correspondence and parcels continued to be charged at the Indian inland rates. What has gone before relates chiefly to letter mails, and we may Questions now deal separately with the political history of the Indian parcels post, specially aff- Soon after the foundation of the Indian post office at Baghdad in 1868, it was discovered that native traders were making use of the eel post in British parcel post to evade the payment of customs duty. The parcel Turkish 'Iraq, service was thereupon temporarily suspended, and, on resumption, two 1868-190, new regulations were introduced: (1) that parcels should not be received for despatch unless accompanied by a pass from the Turkish Customs House and (2) that parcels arriving from elsewhere should only be delivered to the addressees in the presence of a Qawwas of the British Residency, by whom the addressees were to be at once conducted to the Customs House. In 1881, at the request of the Turkish authorities, a trifling altera- 1881. tion was made in the procedure; and delivery to addressees thereafter took place in the presence of a messenger of the Turkish Customs House. In 1882 a change in the management of the Baghdad customs led 1882 - to complaints by Turkish officials against the established parcel post usage, and it was modified. The parcel bags were still landed with the letter bags at the Indian post office; but from that place they were now conveyed by the Indian postmaster to the Customs House and made over to the Customs authorities, a list signed by a Customs official being taken by way of acknowledgment. Delivery was made by the Customs House on production by the addressees of certificates signed by the Indian postmaster. The procedure at Basrah before 1892 is not ascertainable, but it was probably much the same as at Baghdad. In 1892 the procedure was once more revised, and since then it has not 1892. been changed. The offices of exchange at Bombay, Karachi and Bushehr now prepare detailed parcel invoices, one copy of which is sent in a closed cover to the head of the Turkish Customs House at Basrah or Baghdad, as the case may be, and another to the Indian postmaster. The parcel bags are opened in the Indian post office, in the presence of a Turkish Customs officer who takes charge of them, conveys them to the Customs House, and signs the postmaster's copy of the invoice by way of receipt; afterwards the parcels are delivered to the addressees by the Turkish Customs on presentation of delivery orders obtained from the Indian postmaster. At Baghdad, since the abolition of insur ance, attempts are frequently made to smuggle precious stones and jewellery into the country by means of registered letters j and to prevent this suspected letters are now opened at the post office in the presence of the addressees, and, if found to contain dutiable articles, are either mads2466 Difficulties connected with money orders in Turkish 'Iraq, 1883- 1889. 1886. 1889. Articles pro* hihited Turkish 'Iraq. over to the Turkish Customs or returned to the senders. The time- honoured privilege of landing the British mails direct at the British post office has been maintained both at Basrah and Baghdad; but it is regarded with disfavour by the Turks. Turkey adhered to the Universal Postal Conventions of Vienna (1891) and Washington (1897), but she is not a party to any Conven tion or Agreement relating to the Parcels Post Service. Parcels for Turkey are accepted in India since the 1st of January 1896. The matter of money orders at Baghdad is a somewhat difficult one, chiefly on account of the remoteness of the place and of a prohibition issued by the Turkish Government in 1883 against the importation of foreign silver into the country. In order to obtain funds for the pay ment of money orders drawn on the Baghdad post office, the Political Resident, with whom the responsibility for the arrangements rests, is from time to time obliged to issue bills. These are sometimes accepted at a discount and sometimes at a premium, and special regulations have been found necessary to meet both cases. In 1886, when discounts prevailed, it was decided that commission should be levied at a rate of one per cent, in excess of the rate of dis count in order to maintain the rate of net commission at one per cent., and that when discount exceeded two per cent, the issue of money orders should be discontinued. In 1889, when the Residents bills were saleable at a premium and money accumulated too fast in the Residency treasury, the Resident was empowered to raise the commission on money orders, both at Baghdad and Basrah, to two per cent, when bills on India were selling at a premium of one per cent., and to stop the issue of money orders at both places when the premium rose above one per cent. In 1894 it was ascertained that the importation into Turkish ^Iraq of the following objects was prohibited :—arms and ammunition, poison ous drugs, worn clothes, articles likely to carry disease, and figures (other than simple portraits) of royal personages or other notabili ties ; to these have now been temporarily added a number of other articles considered capable of conveying plague. The exportation of antiquities is illegal; but it was carried on to some extent through the Indian post offices until 1895, when the practice was discovered and stopped by means of stricter rules regarding the acceptance of parcels. Books imported, except those obtained by foreign consular officers for their personal or official use, are subject to examination by the Turkish Director of Public Instruction in the capacity of censor; and in 1896 all book parcels received by letter mail were regularly sent him for scrutiny. Subsequently the custom fell into desuetude ; but at some time before 1903, when it was discovered by the Indian postal authorities that objectionable publications were entering Baghdad by the Indian book post, the British Political Resident assumed the responsibility of examin ing the mails and of returning unapproved books to the senders through the Dead Letter Office. Newspapers and other publications prohibited by the Turkish Government are regularly consigned to the Dead Letter Office; in the black list of these there are nearly ^00 names inserted between the years 1899 and 1903 alone.ANNEXUEE NO. 1.—TABLE OF MAIL CONTRACTS, PERSIAN GULP DIVISION (EXCEPT BASRAH- BAGHDAD LINE).

THE SLAVE TRADE IN THE PERSIAN GULF REGION.* Evolution of the anti-slavery policy of Great Britain, 1772- 1838. ' In dealing with the question of the slave trade in the Persian Gulf, or in any other part of the world, it should be remembered that the attitude of the British Government, which during the last century has played a principal part in the repression of the traffic,and nowhere more so than on the East African Coast and in South-Western Asia was formerly different. On board of the fleet which in 16^6 conveyed Sir Dodmore Cotton, a British Ambassador, with his staff from Surat to Bander ; Abbas there were more than 300 slaves bought by Persians in India, and the only remark which this circumstance suggested to Sir T. Herbert, the chronicler of the Embassy, was that a ships, besides the transporting of riches and rarities from place to place, consociate the most remote regions of the earth by participation of commodities and other excellencies to each other/' In 1772, however, it was decided by the English courts that a slave, as soon as he set his foot on the soil of the British islands, became free ; but the slave trade and the owning of slaves continued abroad under the British flag until a much later date, and it has been calculated that about 1790, out of some 74,000 slaves exported annually from Africa, not less than 38,000 belonged to British merchants. At length, in 1807, an Act was passed whereby it became illegal for any vessel to clear for slaves from a port in the British dominions after the Jst of May 1807, or to land slaves in a British colony after the 1st of March 1808; the penalties for disobe dience of this Act were at first only pecuniary, but in 1811 the traffic iu slaves was declared to be felony and was made punishable with trans portation. So far it had only been endeavoured to prevent commercial dealings in slaves by British subjects; but the movement against slavery as an institution continued; and at length, in 1833, proprietary right in slaves was abolished throughout the British dominions. The final libera tion of all slaves took place in August 1838,^ the transition having been effected, in most places, by means of a period of indentured apprentice- aip. * The following are the principal authorities in connection with the slave trade to and in the Persian Gulf : Bomhav Selections, XXIV, 1856 ; Captain P. D. Hender- son's Pr ecis of Correspondence relating to Zanzibar Affairs from 185 6J° 1872 J lieutenant H. L. Ramsay's Precis of Zanzibar Affairs, 1872 the Administration Reports of the Persian Gulf Political Residency, from 1871 to 1907; Mr. J. A. Saldanha's Precis on Slave Trade in the Grulf of Oman and the Persian W/, 1873—1905; Aitchisona Treaties; and Mr. R. N. Lyne s Zanzibar m Contemporary Times, 1906.2476 Repression of the slave trade in the Persian Gulf. Division of the subject. The general position of the British Government in regard to slavery being such as we have described^ it remains to enquire by what means and to what extent their policy in recent times ■—uncompro misingly hostile to the slave trade and adverse also to slavery as an institution—has been carried out in the Persian Gulf. In doing so we shall take account^ firstly, of the British agreements with foreign powers and of the British internal enactments by which action in the Gulf has been mainly governed; secondly, of certain ques tions, relating to the meaning and application of agreements and enact ments, which from time to time have come under discussion; thirdly, of subsidiary matters connected with British anti-slavery proceedings in the Gulf; fourthly, of the history of the external slave trade of the Persian Gulf and of British preventive operations ; fifthly, of the history of the internal slave trade of the Persian Gulf; sixthly, of domestic slavery in the Persian Gulf; and, lastly, of the general results of the British anti-slavery policy in the Gulf. In dealing with the legal elements of the situation it is necessary to proceed by jurisdictions, and a general view of the legal position in the Gulf will be possible only after the separate agreements and enactments have been analysed in detail. Agreements with the Saiyids and Sultans of 'Oman, 1822-1907.' Treaty of September, 1822. The first treaty with the ruler of Masqat for the suppression of slavery was concluded on the 4th of September 1822 by Captain Moresby of H.M.S. 'Menai', under instructions from Sir R. Farquhar, Governor of Mauritius, and was signed by Saiyid Sa^id; it prohibited the sale of slaves to Christian nations by the Saiyid^s subjects, it made punishable the buying of slaves by the same for the purpose of sale to Christians, and it empowered the British Government to establish an agent in the Saiyid^s dominions in East Africa to watch the trade and to seize, after the expiration of four months, any ''Omani vessels found carrying slaves to Christian countries. An additional clause, signed on the 9th of September, authorised the seizure by British Government ships of offending vessels found beyond (i.e., to the east or south of) a line drawn from Cape Delgado in Africa through a point 60 miles from Soqotrah to Diu in India, unless driven across it by circumstances over which they had no control. The provisions of this Treaty were confirmed in a subsequent Treaty of Commerce, concluded on the 31st of May 1889. * The Agreements, etc., mentioned in this paraarraph. will be found in Aitc]iison , s Treaties.2477 By the treaty just described means were provided for the extmction decision not of the slave trade between Africa and India; but a w ide belt within which the traffic continued to be lawful was intentionally left, connecting t; - on 0 f the east coast of Africa with ''Oman. In 18-37-38 the practicability of traffic, 1838, inducing Saiyid Sa'id and the Shaikhs of Trucial ^Oman to forbid all trade in slaves within their dominions was discussed; but it was found that such a prohibition would entail payment of heavy compensation to the signatories-—among whom the Saiyid complained of having already lost $! 00,000 a year by the treaty of 1822—not to mention a very large expenditure on preventive arrangements ; that the Muhammadan popula tions affected, by whose religion slavery was lawful and whose conveni ence had come by long custom to depend on a regular supply of slaves, would be greatly exasperated by so drastic a change; and, finally, that no beneficial result was to be anticipated, inasmuch as the trade would merely be deflected to Turkish and Persian territory and to the jurisdic tion of independent rulers, such as the Shaikh of Qatif, with whom no agreements had been formed in restraint of the traffic. In 1839, apparently in connection with fresh arrangements which were then being made with the Shaikhs of Trucial 'Oman, the Saiyid 1822^17^ of Masqat consented to an amplification of the Treaty of 1822 the December principal new provisions authorised the detention and search by British 1839. government cruisers of 'Omani vessels found beyond the restrictive line and suspected of being engaged in the slave trade, also the confiscation of the same if shown to contain slaves intended for sale beyond the restrictive line, provided that the presence of the offending vessels beyond the line was not involuntary. At the same time the sale of Somalis as slaves was declared to be, for the future, punishable as piracy, on the ground that Somalis were by nature ' Hurr ^ or free, that is, that they belonged to a race regarded as unenslavable by Muhammadan jurists. The restrictive line was modified by being made to pass from Cape Delgado two degrees seaward of the island of Soqotrah and thence to Puzimon the coast of Persian Makran; by this change, it will be observed, the Saiyid^s ports of Gwadar and Chahbar on the Makran coast were closed to the slave trade. On the 18th of August 1845 Saiyid Sa'id agreed on behalf of him- Salyid's ^ self, his heirs, and his governors, to assist in apprehending British ^ f nd ^ kin g subjects who might be engaged in the slave trade. This was apparently a condition which had been unintentionally omitted in framing the Treaty of 1822. Before the end of the same year a step further was taken Further Ag- in the conclusion of a further Agreement, dated 2nd October 1845 j o e T e o f &gt;, of by which the Saiyid undertook to prohibit, under the severest penalties, ^ u «tober the export of slaves from Ms African dominions ; to prohibit, also under the severest penalties, the importation of slaves from any part of Africa into his possessions in Asia; and to use his utmost influence with all the chiefs of Arabia, the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf to prevent in like manner the introduction of slaves from Africa into their respective territories. Saiyid Sa'id in this same Agreement, which was to come into effect on the 1st of January 1847, authorised ships of the Royal Navj^2478 and East India Company to seize and confiscate ^Omani vessels engaged in the slave trade, except such as might be found carrying slaves between certain ports on the eastern coast of Africa. Act of 15 th Provision was made for giving effect to the Agreement thus con- Septejnber eluded by an Act (11 and 1^ Vic 0 Cap. CXXVIII), dated the 15th 1848. September 1848, which authorised British officers to take action in accordance with its terms, and which regulated, at the same time the rewards that the captors of slave vessels under the Agreement should receive. Masqat Order A Masqat Order in Council of 4ith November 1867 empowered the in Council, British Consul at Masqat himself to try, with the aid of assessors, any K th i8fi7 Vem ' British subject accused of engaging in, or being accessory, to the pur- chase or sale of slaves, or of having slaves illegally in his possession, or otherwise to send such British subject to India for trial by the High Court of Bombay. On the 2£nd of May 1849, Sohar and the district around it eaeement 0 ' forming at that time a principality independent of Masqat, an Engage- •22nd May ment was obtained from Saiyid Saif-bin -Hamud, the chief of Sohai, 1849. by which he bound himself to prohibit, with effect from the ^Ist June 1849, the exportation of slaves from the coast of Africa and elsewhere in vessels belonging to himself or his subjects and agreed to the deten tion and search by British cruisers of such vessels, when suspected ot taking part in the slave trade, and to their confiscation in event ot the suspicion being found justified. Act of 9th As in the case of the Agreement of 1845 with the Saiyid of 'Omau, May 1853. legislative action was taken in Great Britain to give effect to the t-n- o-ao-ement of the Sohar chief ; this was done by the passing of an Act (16 and 17 Vic., Cap. XVI), dated 9th May 1853, of which the provi sions resembled those of the Act of 15th September 1848. Treaty of Saiyid Sa'id, in whose reign all the agreements as yet mentioned April 14th were formed, ruled over both Zanzibar and 'Oman ; but atter his deatn 1873 ' in 1856 these two territorial divisions became separate Sultanates. With the Sultan of Zanzibar we are hardly concerned, except to remark that the provision in the Agreement of 1845 which permitted the ship ment of slaves between ports in East Africa was abused m such a way as to cover a continuance of the slave trade between Kast Africa an the Persian Gulf, and that this circumstance eventually ^necpsitatccl revision of the Agreement of 1845. Colonel Higby, the Political g in Zanzibar, reported in 1861 that the Agreement had been a dead letter since its execution, and that m 1860-61 no less than 10,000 p, had been exported northwards from East Africa. A change was real y ^ required in the Agreements with the Sultan of Zanzibar on y; _ advantage was taken of the mission of Sir Bartle Frere to Zanzibarm |( ^ 1873 to obtain from the Sultan of'Oman also a Treaty moie app ISYO to ODtani xrom Lilt- ^uiuaii V. - ,' J „ V pi priate to the altered circumstances of that ruler than the Agreem n 1845. On the 12th of April 187S Sir B. Frere and his staff armed at Masqat, where, the obstacles to an understanding being less cottsidera T, than at Zanzibar, matters were quickly adjusted with the assistan Colonel Pelly, the Political Resident; and on the 14th of April a new Treaty was signed. By this instrument the importation of slaves tro %, agrcet2479 nei^ m M abroad into the Sultanas territories was absolutely interdicted; vessels engaged in carrying slaves were declared to be liable to confiscation by British officers and courts ; the closure of all public markets for slaves in his dominions was promised by the Sultan ; the Sultan undertook to protect all liberated slaves to the utmost of his power; and Her Britannic Majesty engaged that natives of Indian States under British protection should be prohibited at once from acquiring fresh slaves and, after a date to be fixed, from possessing any. But the most remarkable provision of the Treaty was one to the effect that all persons thereafter entering the Sultan's dominions and dependencies should be free. The Sultan of Zanzibar also gave way, though not till after the departure of Sir B. Frere from Zanzibar, and signed a Treaty for the complete aboli tion of the Slave Trade on the 5th June 1873. AgreemeDts with the Shaikhs of Trucial 'Oman, 1820-1907. * The first t agreement of all in restraint of the slave trade in the General Persian Gulf was one embodied in the General Treaty of i 820 which Treaty of followed the British operations against the Qawasim in 1819-1820; 1820. it was laid down by the 9th Article of that Treaty that the carrying off of slaves from the coasts of Africa or elsewhere and the transporting of them in vessels was plunder and piracy, and that the subjects of the signatories should do nothing of such a nature. This article appears to have been inserted in the Treaty at the instance of Captain J. P. Thompson of His Majesty's 17th Light Dragoons, who was Interpreter to Sir W. Grant Keir, the General commanding the expedition, and afterwards distinguished himself as a slavery abolitionist; and it was specially reported, at the time, that 'no persuasion was necessary to induce the acceptance of this stipulation''. In 1837-38 it was decided, as already noted in the paragraph on Decision not 'Oman Sultanate agreements, not to put pressure on the Trueial to press for Shaikhs or on the Saiyid of Masqat to abolish the slave trade in their ^ 0 f ^ dominions entirely. The reasons for this resolve were partly financial j ra (5 C) 1838. and partly political. In 1837 there were complaints of slave raids by Qawasim on the Agrasment East African and Somali coasts : and a Qasimi agent, who happened to 0l: i8d! '- be at Bushehr at the time, though he denied the more serious allegations of the principal informant, a certain ^Abdullah-bin-'Iwa^, admitted that the Qawasim had bought as slaves a number of prisoners of war taken from one another in Somaliland by two hostile tribes. On the 17th of April 1838, in consequence of these revelations, an Agreement was * The agreements, etc., mentioned in this paragraph are given in Aitcbison's Treaties. t With one trifling exception 11812) mentioned in the paraajaph on agreements ^Ith Turkey. I gg2480 obtained from the Qasimi Shaikh o£ Sharjah, authorising the detention and search of vessels belonging to his subjects, when suspected of carrying off: or embarking slaves, and the confiscation of the same on proof of slaves having been carried off or embarked. Similar agree ments were signed also by the Shaikhs of ^Ajman, Dibai and Abu Dhabi, but not, apparently, by the Shaikh of Umm-al-Qaiwain. Agreement I n the following year this Agreement was remodelled so as t 0 of 1839. authorise the detention and search of suspected, and the confiscation of guilty vessels and their cargo by British cruisers, only if found outside a restrictive line running from Cape Delgado to a point two degrees seaward of Soqotrah and thence to Gwadar Head; and confiscation was not to be enforced if the line had been crossed under stress of weather or otherwise involuntarily. It was added, this being a result of inqui ries to which the reports regarding the enslavement of Somalis had given rise, that Somalis were e ' Hurr ' or free, and that traffic in Somali slaves should therefore, after the expiry of four months, be punished as piracy. The modified Agreement of 1839, was executed by the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi on the 1st of July 1839, by the Shaikhs of Dibai and Umm-al- Qaiwain on the 2nd, and by the Shaikh of Sharjah on the 3rd of the same month. Apparently no Agreement was secured, on this occasion, from the Shaikh of ^Ajman. The Resident in the Persian Gulf, Captain Hennell, was warmly commended by the Governor- General of India in Council for obtaining these A greements, which, it was believed, would make possible the extinction of the African slave trade upon the coasts of India. Agreement of l n 1847 a further and more stringent Agreement was obtained 1847. from the five Trucial Shaikhs, whereby they engaged to prohibit the exportation of slaves from any place whatever on board vessels belong ing to themselves and their subjects, and consented to the detention and search, and—in case of guilt —to the confiscation, of such vessels by British cruisers. The new Agreement was signed by the Shaikhs at various dates in April and May of 1847, and it took effect from the 10th of December of the same year. Act of the To enable British officers and ships to take action upon the 1st August Agreement of 1847 an Act (12 and 13 Vic., Cap. LXXXIV), dated 1st August 1849, was passed ; its terms resembled those of the Acts of 1848 and 1853 relating to Masqat and Sohar. Engagement To further the objects of the Agreement of 1847 a fresh Engage- of 1856. m ent was secured in 1856 from each of the Trucial Shaikhs, by which the signatories bound themselves to seize and deliver up to the British authorities any slaves who might be shown to have been brought into their territories or into places subject to their authority, also to place an embargo on any boat which might have been used in the commission of a slaving offence and to hold it at the disposal of the British Political Resident.

Agreements with the Shaikhs of Qatar, Hasa and Kuwait. No agreements on the subject of the slave trade have been obtained from the Shaikhs of Qatar or Kuwait, or from those of Hasa. Until 1871 the latter province was, except for two brief intervals during which it was held by the Egyptians, a dependency of the Wahhabi Am irate of Najd. Agreements with the Turkish Government,* 1812-1907. But for an order obtained from the Pasha of Baghdad in 1812, in which Order of tlie it was directed that natives of India kidnapped and brought to Basrah for sale as slaves should be handed over to the British Agent at Basrah, * no arrangements for the suppression of the slave trade were made with the Porte until 1847. At the end of January in that year, at the instance of the British Imperial Government, a decree was promulgated by the Sultan of Turkey whereby 18 e ^ ee 0 merchant vessels under the Turkish flag were prohibited from engaging in the slave trade and were made liable, in case of disobedience, to confiscation, and the masters of the same to punishment; it was agreed that offending vessels might be captured by British as well as by Turkish men of war, and in the former case the vessels seized were to be delivered over by the captors to the Turkish authorities in the Persian Gulf. The Wali of Baghdad was at the same time instructed to publish the new orders, which were to take effect four months after the 27th of January 1847 ; and slaves coming into the hands of the Turkish authorities were to be repatriated. The Wali of Baghdad was warned to confine himself, in the case of vessels belonging to independent Arab chiefs which might contain slaves, to repelling them from Turkish ports. Finally it was ordered that slaves released should, according as * The agreements Trentioned in this paragraph are contained in Aitchison s Treaties, Full information regarding the Turkish slavery laws will he found m Young's Corps de Droit Ottoman, Volume II, pages 166-206. 166 I :,r ! i2482 they themselves preferred^ either be handed over to the British author ities for repatriation or allowed to remain in the Ottoman dominions under sufficient precautions against their re-enslavement. Treaty of These arrangements were made regular and authoritative by a ?sRr ^ anuarj treaty concluded at Constantinople on the 25th of January 1880 between the British Government and the Porte. By this agreement the Turkish Government undertook to prohibit the importation of African slaves into any part of the Ottoman dominions^ and not to allow the exporta tion of suchj except as domestic servants accompanying their masters or mistresses^ in which case they should be provided with certificates. Arrangements were made for bringing to justice persons other than Ottoman subjects who might commit slavery offences in Turkish territory; and it was laid down that all slaves found in possession of dealers should be liberated^ after which the Porte should take adequate measures to ensure their remaining free and being properly cared for. British cruisers were authorised to visit, search, and, if necessary, detain, merchant vessels proved to be or suspected of being concerned in the African slave trade, these rights to be exercised only in the Red Sea, in the Gulf of Aden, on the Coast of Arabia, in the Persian Gulf, OH the East Coast of Africa and in Ottoman maritime waters where there were no constituted authorities; and vessels detained were to be handed over to the nearest or most convenient Ottoman authority for trial, the slaves being delivered to the nearest Ottoman or other authorities with a view to securing their freedom. On the requisition of a British naval or consular officer the authorities at an Ottoman port should be obliged to search, and deal with according to the results of the search, any vessel which such British officer might denounce as engaged in the African slave trade. Merchant vessels under the British flag were made liable, in analogous circumstances and in the same localities, to search and detention by Turkish authorities or cruisers; but vessels seized, with the cargo and crew, were to be transferred to the nearest British authority for disposal, while the slaves captured remained at the disposal of the Turkish authorities. In cases of wrongful seizure suitable compensation was to be paid by the one Government to the other. To prevent undue interference by British cruisers with Turkish vessels manned wholly or in part by slaves, such vessels were to be provided with papers showing the number of slaves carried ,* and &gt; if a greater number of slaves than that certified were found on any vessel, the latter should be liable to detention.

In order to make these orders operative, a Convention, to take effect Convention from the 1st of January 185^ and to remain in force for eleven years only J 8 ^ gus from the date of the Convention, was concluded in August 1851 between the British and the Persian Governments through Colonel Sheil, the British Minister at Tehran. It provided that ships of war belonging^ to the Royal and Indian Navies should be at liberty to search Persian merchant vessels for African slaves, the Persian Government at the same time undertaking that none should be imported in Persian Govern ment vessels; but no search was to be undertaken without the parti cipation of Persian officials who were to be carried on the British war vessels. If slaves were found they were to be removed by the British authorities, who should dispose of them; but guilty vessels were to be handed over to the Persian authorities. Slaves in Persia, when about to travel by sea, should be provided with special passports by the Persian authorities at Bushehr; and they should not, if this were done, be inter fered with. The Convention of 1851 was renewed by Article 13 of the Treaty of Treaty of Peace between Britain and Persia, signed at Paris on the 4th of March Pea«^ 1857&gt; 1857 : and it was agreed that the period of its operation shouH be - extended by ten years, viz., from August 1862 to August 1872, after which it should continue to be in force until the expiration of one year after a formal declaration of annulment by either party. The Convention of 1851, as extended by ^ the Treaty of 1857, Conventioa remained in force until the 1st May 1882, when it was superseded by a 1832 Convention concluded at Tehran on the ^nd March 18 • _ ^ uew Convention made it lawful for British cruisers to visit and detain Persian merchant vessels engaged, or suspected of being or ot having been en^ao-ed, in carrying slaves, apparently without the co-operation ot Persian officials ; if slaves were found on board, the vessel and all in it were to be taken before the nearest Persian authorities tor trial; a u y authorised British officer was to be present at the adjudication ; i the vessel were condemned, the proceeds of its sale were to go to the Persian Government, any slaves taken being delivered over to the British authorities. His Majesty the Shah undertoo o _ pums severely any of his subjects or any persons subject to his jurisdiction who might be found engaging in the slave trade by sea, and to manumit and guarantee the safety and proper treatment of slaves imported by sea in violation of the Convention. Persons proceeding on pilgrimage and taking slaves with them were to be provided with a special Persian passport countersigned by a British Resident or Consu i and, if at theii return they were not accompanied by a greater nnmber ot | negroes than was mentioned in the passport, they should not be liable to interference. 166 ACouncil' 18th n Pers i! n Convention of 1882 was brought within the operation August 1882. . ^ a i e Act ' 187 ^ b y an Order in Council passed on the 18th of August 1882, General position and enactments, 1812-1907. Won/1812- C ' Be ! 0 ? Sf ; in ' fu . rther we ma .y briefly review the stages by which the 44 ■ present legal position as regards slavery in the Persian Gulf has been reached. In 1800 there was no legal obstacle to the slave trade in anv form many part of the Gulf. From 1812 the enslavement of Indians was treated as illegal by the Turkish authorities in-'Iraq. In 1820 the carrying off and transporting of slaves were stigmatised and made punish able as plunder and piracy by the Shaikhs of Tmcial J Oman and Bahrain • but, as we shall see further on, the expressions used were interpreted in practice in a sense narrower than that of which, possibly, thev were capable. In 1822 the Saiyid of Masqat undertook to prevent the supply ing of slaves by his subjects to those of Christian nations and agreed to the seizure of slaving vessels outside a certain line. In 1839 the Masqat restrictive line was modified, and the Trucial Shaikhs agreed to the seizure outside an almost identical line of vessels carrying !u cJ ir a g re e m ent superseded a more general one into which the Shaikhs had entered in 1838. r Jhe above were the only repressive measures brought into force up to 1844, and it will be seen that they n 6 w £ very partial character in so far as they concerned the Persian (jult; tor while they made it possible to destroy the trade in slaves between Africa and India, they left the trade from Africa to Persia, , wai t' Hasa and Qatar totally unaffected, and they permitted ot the contmiiance of a trade in purchased slaves from Africa to •'Oman, Irucial Oman and Bahrain, provided the slavers did not cross to the Indian side of an imaginary line. Later restric- • j • , • tions, 1845- .. ,. progressive restrictions imposed after 1844 were aimed at the S2, extinction of the trade from Africa to the Persian Gulf itself. In 1845 the Saiyid of Masqat and Zanzibar prohibited the importation of slaves into his Asian territories and made illegal all carriage of slaves by his subjects at sea, except in certain African waters. Tn 1847 the Trucial Shaikhs interdicted the carriage of slaves at sea in vessels belonging to their subjects; and in the same year the traffic was rendered ilWl for vessels under the Turkish flag. Tn 1848 the importation of African slaves by sea into Persia was prohibited. Various subsidiary arrange ments followed at intervals up to 1882; but by the end of ]84cS the present Isgal position had virtually been attained, the carriage of slaves from Africa to the coasts of the Persian Gulf in vessels belong'ins' to then subjecis had become contrary to the laws of all rulers (except those oi^ Qatar, Hasa and Kuwait) in the countries surroundino* the Gulf- an ious means of enforcing those laws, principally by British naval co-operation, had been provided. tan2485 lull Ifc is impossible to deal here with the subject of the legislation of General Act European countries in its bearing on the slave trade in the Persian Gulf; but mention must be made of the General Act of the Brussels Conference, Conference of 1890, which had for its object the repression of the 1890. African slave trade. Two important provisions of the Act were those contained in the 27th and 28th Articles; under the former, a slave taking refuge on board a war-vessel of one of the signatory powers must be immediately and definitively liberated, and, under the latter, the liberation of a slave detained against his will on board a native vessel might be pronounced by any agent, duly empowered for the purpose, of one of the same powers. By the 4/2nd Article of the Act, war-ships of the signatory powers were authorised to stop, and, if necessary, to arrest, on the high seas, vessels of less than 500 tons suspected of being engaged in the slave trade. The Act was ratified by Great Britain, France and Turkey, the three powers chiefly concerned in Persian Gulf waters, on the 2nd of January 1892 ; and it actually came into force on the 2nd of April 1892. By France certain important reservations were made in regard to the right of search by foreign war-vessels of craft under the French flag. Questions relating to the meaning and application of agreements and enactments. Having concluded this slight survey of the laws of Persian Gulf states with reference to the slave trade, and taking for granted all British legislation on the same subject, we proceed to refer to several questions of law which have arisen in practice. Legal doubts, arising chiefly from the complexity of the subject, from the insufficiency of the best-devised rules to meet every case, and from confusion of law or juris diction, have been frequent; and the feeling among British|officers that slavery of every kind is morally wrong, not to mention the pecuniary rewards decreed by British law for the liberation of slaves, has tended to multiply legal difficulties. One of the earliest points to come under discussion was the meaning of Meaning of Article 9 of the Treaty of 1820 with the Trucial Shaikhs and the Shaikh Article 9 of ^1 of Bahrain, whereby the carrying off of slaves and the transporting of ^ e ^g20 e . a ^ ^' them in vessels were declared to be plunder and piracy and were interdic- m ted. The intention of the framers of the treaty can be gathered only from G-eneral Sir W. Grant Keir's contemporaneous comment, that the article 'abolishes the slave trade of the subscribino- Powers, and must show distinctly the abhorrence in which it is held by the British Govern ment. ' The point whether this article should be held to prohibit the transporting in vessels of slaves purchased, as well as of slaves raided, was first raised* by Lieutenant McLeod, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, after a visit to the Trucial Coast and Bahrain in 1823; Lieutenant McLeod held that it would be extremely inadvisable, and even dangerous, to attempt to enforce the article in the wider sense, a sense in whicfy moreover, it did not appear to have been understood by the Arabs^2486 and he further pointed out the practical uselessness of stringent action upon one stretch of coast so long as the rest of the Gulf littoral remained opened to the slave traffic. In answer to this reference the Bombay Government ruled that the article referred to the carriage by sea of raided slaves only^ inasmuch as the mere transportation of pur chased slaves from one place to another could not^ except by an abuse of language^ be described as ' plunder and piracy.' The principle thus laid down was strictly observed in practice^ and no action against slave dealers has ever, it is believed^ been taken under the article ; but the meaning continued to be debated so late as 1841^ when the Govern ment of India held that, having remained a dead-letter for twenty years^ the article could not in justice or prudence be enforced suddenly and without warning in the wider interpretation. By the conclusion of the Engagements of 1847, relating to Trucial ''Oman and Bahrain, the question was deprived of its practical importance. Reception of The question of the reception of fugitive slaves on board British fugitive vessels, especially in territorial waters, and of their subsequent emanci- slaves on pation was a delicate one of which a solution was not reached without board pub lie difficulty ; its settlement depended not on the agreements with local 1 'is^- P owers ^ none of which dealt with the subject, but on considerations of X884. S ' international law and usage. 1856. 1856 a slave, not of recent importation, took refuge on board H. M.S. a Clive, ^ at the time lying off Bahrain^ and was restored by Lieutenant Disbrowe, Assistant Political Eesident, who happened to be on board, at the request of the owner; and the Assistant Residents action was held by the higher authorities to have been correct. 1871-73- In 1872 two slaves made their way on board H.M.S. 'Magpie' while at anchor in the inner roads of Bushehr, and their surrender was claimed from Colonel Pelly, the Political Eesident,—in one case by the Persian Slave Commissioner at Bushehr^ and in the other by a British protected subject; Colonel Pelly, on the ground that the incident had taken place in Persian territorial waters, handed over the slave de* manded by the Slave Commissioner, but in the other case, as the claimant was not a Persian subject and did not appear to be the actual owner, he liberated the slave. In August 1872 a somewhat similar case happened on the B.M.S. ' Hugh again in Persian terri torial waters; but in this instance Colonel Pelly refused to give up the slaves, though claimed by their masters, and caused them to be sent to Bombay. On the night of the 31st August 1873 a more important case than either of the preceding occurred, through the swimming off of a slave to the B.M.S. a May Frere near the uninhabited island of Zirko, from a fleet of 7 3 pearl boats anchored in the vicinity; the slave sought and received protection with the result that all the pearl boats near weighed and prepared to leave, lest their slaves should desert and be freed. 1876. This case led to a preference to Her Majesty^s Government, and a discussion followed which resulted, though not until August 1876, in the issue by the admiralty of definite instructions as to the reception The2487 of fugitive slaves on board British war-vessels. The gist of the orders was:— (1) that, when a fugitive slave had once been received on board a vessel of the British Navy and taken under the protection of the British flag, whether within or beyond territorial waters, no demand for his surrender on the ground of slavery should be admitted or entertained. (2) that, in receiving a fugitive slave on board a British war-vessel, the Commander should be guided by considerations of humanity, to which full effect must be given whether the ship were on the high seas or within the territorial waters of a state in which slavery was recognised ; but, in the latter case, conduct which might appear to be in breach of international comity or good faith was to be avoided. (3) that if any person, within territorial waters, claimed protec tion on the ground that he was kept in slavery in contra vention of treaties with Great Britain, he should be received on board until the truth of his statement had been examined into; that the examination should be _ made, it possible, after communication with the nearest British Con sular authority, and that the British Commander should be guided in his subsequent proceedings by the result. The consequence of these instructions was apparently to invest Commanders with considerable discretion as to the reception or non reception of applicants on board their ships; but a person received, unless provisionally received for the purpose of enquiring into an alleged breach of treaty, might not subsequently be given up as a slave. Similar instructions were issued by the Government of India in 1884. 1884 for the guidance of officers of the Indian Marine. In theseit was added that slaves should not be removed from shore and then treated as fugitives; and that, if m exceptional circumstances the removal of a slave should seem to be required ^'^in S Wd be humanitv. the Commander receiving him on board bis ship should be prepared to compensate the owner, ft was a | s0 added tion of a slave as a fugitive m temtona , , wa . el 'l 0 g ; jWance be alleged ill-treatment by his master should, in the first instance, provisional only, pending an enquiry into his case. ■ . ,o Qa On the 25th of November 1899, on the occasion of a visit to 1899.

On the 29th of April 1902 a difficult case occurred at Abu Dhabi through the escape to H.M.S. a Eedbreast' of a slave belonging to a relation of the Shaikh. The 'Redbreast ^ had brought Captain Cox, the Political Agent at Masqat, to Abu Dhabi for the purpose of making an arduous and somewhat dangerous journey by land from that place to Masqat; and it was highly inadvisable that Captain Cox's enterprise should be prejudiced at the outset by an act so unpopular as the manumission of a slave,—especially of a slave who appeared to have been in all respects perfectly well treated. The slave was accordingly landed, and Captain Cox arranged to purchase him with a view to giving him his freedom ; but in the end the man spontaneously decided to remain at Abu Dhabi, Meaning of In 1892 a question arose as to the exact effect of the direction the^M^ at containecl in Article 1 of the Masqat Treaty of 1873, that a persons Treaty ^of 1 ^ erea ^ er entering the Sultan's dominions and dependencies shall be 1873. free/ ; the occasion being an application for protection to the British Consulate at Masqat by a slave, born at Arbaq near Masqat, whose parents were slaves lawfully imported into the Sultan's dominions before the Treaty of 1873 ; the doubt in this case was due to the fact that the slave, along with his father, had more than once visited Calcutta in recent years and might therefore be said to have a entered 13 the Sultanas dominions after 1873. The ruling of the Government of India was to the effect that the slave in question, by entering British territory, had ipso facto become a free man, and that, had he been forcibly carried back to Masqat, he might have been regarded as imported into 'Oman after 1873 and therefore as entitled to his freedom; but they considered that, by voluntarily returning to Masqat, he had abandoned the privileges acquired by visiting British territory and had reverted to his original status of a lawfully owned slave. The Govern ment of India added that this principle would apply in the case of all slaves lawfully imported into the Sultan's dominions before 1873 and also to the cases of the children of such borne in the Sultan's dominions; but they explained that all slaves brought to Masqat for the first time and otherwise than voluntarily, after the date of the treaty, were entitled to their freedom. The In 1877 a case occurred at Bushehr, giving rise to several difficult 'Rokeby'' points which were not finally settled until 1881. The presence of slaves case, 77. 011 the British steamer 'Rokeby ' having been reported, that vessel was searched under arrangements made by Captain Clayton commanding H.M.S. 'Rifleman,' and seven imported slaves were discovered, who were seized, landed, and made over to Captain Prideaux, the officiating Political Resident. The surrender of an eighth imported slave, landed from the 'Rokeby ' by a Persian subject, was also obtained by Captain Prideaux through the Persian Kar^uzar at Bushehr. The proceedings in the case were held before Colonel Miles, Consul at Masqat, whose was the 'consular East African court' nearest to BusLehr ; it resulted in the forfeiture of the eight slaves, who were at the time at Bushehf) to Her Majesty the Queen. Doubts having arisen as to the validity of the proceedings, a reference was made to the Home Government; and it was held by the Law Officers to the Crown that the seizure of2489 figi# slaves on board a British private vessel lying in a foreign harbour was not justifiable without the intervention of the authorities of the country to which the port belonged, that failure to bring the slaves to be adjudicated on within the jurisdiction of the adjudicating court was a serious error, and finally that a slave did not absolutely obtain his freedom by having been on board a British private ship, and that, if such a slave returned to the country of his master, where slavery was recognised, the British Government could not properly insist upon his being liberated or held to be free. No clear decision was reached as to the jurisdiction of the Masqat court in the case; but the Law Officers apparently inclined to the view that, under the then recent Slave Trade (East African Courts) Act of 1879, the jurisdiction of the Masqat Consul need not be called in question. In May 1887, a British armed naval camp having been formed near Ras Madrakah on the South-Eastern Coast of 'Oman in support of anti- slaving operations, an African slave was received there as a fugitive by the Commander of H.M.S. 'Osprey, ^ carried to Masqat, and finally liberated. The Government of India ruled, with reference to this case, that the grant of protection to a fugitive slave at such a camp, without the cognisance of the Sultan of ''Oman or of the British political authorities, was irregular. In May 1896 Lieutenant Beville, Political Agent at Masqat, having received information that a Sur vessel carrying slaves was in the vicinity of Masqat, and there being at the time no British vessel of war upon the station, put to sea in a boat and captured her himself with 28 slaves on board ; the dealers and crew were handed over to the Sultan of 'Oman, by whom they were punished, and the slaves were variously disposed of. The opinion of the legal authorities on this case was that the seizure was irregular, inasmuch as it had been made neither by an officer commanding a vessel of the British Navy and so empowered under treaty to take action, nor by an officer otherwise specially empowered In 1897, a question having been asked in the House of Commons regardino- the surrender of slaves to their owners by British officers at Masqat and elsewhere, the existing practice in the Gulf was investigated under the orders of the Government of India. The result showed that slaves imported into Trucial 'Oman or Bahrain after 1847^ or into the ; Oman Sultanate after 1873 were treated as entitled to their freedom and were granted manumission certificates by the British authorities, but that those imported at earlier dates, or subsequently born in slavery in the countries mentioned, were returned to their masters ; at Masqat, however, slaves imported before 1873 were occasionally liberated, when it was shown that they had been badly treated, or when no mastei appeared within a reasonable time to claim them ] and both in Bahiain and at Masqat, in returning a runaway slave to his owner, the latter was required to sign an agreemen t binding himself to treat the slave * It seems doubtful however, as recently pointed out by Major Cox, the Political Resident in the Gulf, whether British officials are rea ly entitled, conformably with treaties, to insist on the liberation of slaves imported into either of these regions before the Enga-ement of 1866 ; vide text of that Engagement and of the Agreement of 1847. Has Madra kah caee, 1887. Case of a seizure by the Political Agent at Masqat, 1896. General prac tice as to the manumission of slaves by the British political au thorities in the Persian Gulf, 1897- 99.2490 with kindness. In Persia slaves were not manumitted by the British authorities otherwise than in accordance with the Treaty of 1882^ or, in other words, only slaves imported by sea after the signature of that Treaty were released. All slaves taking refuge on British war vessels were released under Article 28 of the Greneral Act of the Brussels Con ference of 1890. From a communication received in 1899, from the Secretary of State for India, it may be gathered that the practice followed in 1897 was approved by Her Majesty^ Government, subject to an understanding that the Sultan of J Oman, whose concurrence it had been customary to obtain, did not unreasonably refuse his consent to manumission when that course was recommended by the British Consul at Masqat. In 1899 the Governmentof India authorised the Political Resident in the Gulf to inform the various Shaikhs in his political charge, at such time and in such manner as he might see fit, that the British Goyernmen would welcome the extension of a system favourable to the liberation of slaves. Subsidiary questions connected with British operations in the Persian Gulf for suppression of the slave trade. of All charges in connection with the liberation f ,. slav . es ^ Persian Gulf were in the beginning met from their I^an ljudge y the officers through whom they were disbursed; but m 1883 the Go ment of India, having then for the first time become aware of this tact informed the Political Resident in the Gulf that, as the suppressio the slave trade was a .matter of purely Imperial concern, ^ey could not in future authorise any expenditure on slavery proceedings ^ Inton revenues. After 1883 the expenditure incurred was apparently debted to Her Majesty's Government; but none of th 5,, bll ^%^ eS ®' ^ rm ' llv apparently paid, and in 1883 the propriety o eel w , , ij n contested by Her Majesty's Treasury on the ground that an alter of the practice followed during 14 years was evolved and t expenditure in question had no direct connection with the slave trade the slaves for whose benefit expenditure had b®® 11 ]- ncurre n . , i ^ 'captured negroes.' The Government of India m reply pointed out that the charges* at Masqat-the only port at the t,me ^ question were entirely the outcome of the Treaty of 1873, and that the dutie of the Political Agent in regard to the liberation of slaves were per- formed by him exclusively in his consular capacity and under th rity of the Home Government. The view of the Government of Ind a in the end prevailed, and the charges incurred at . asqa P were defrayed in 1890 by Her Majesty s Government. In 1896, i a curious case in which—for the purpose of ascertaining the fate o another slave—it became necessary to ransom a slave from an owner in •The expenditure was chiefly on food for slaves detained under the protection of the Consulate, and for repatriation, etc., after liberation.2491 tte interior of ^Oman, the necessary sum of 1180 was advanced by tlae Government of India and was debited to Her Majesty's Treasury with the approval of the Home Government. Until 1889 it seems to have been the custom to deport liberated, Disposal of slaves, if unwilling to remain in the Persian Gulf, to Bombay ; but ®^ g cipa e at length, in the year mentioned, the Bombay Government animadverted on the constant increase, in consequence of this procedure, of an exci table and turbulent element in the population under ^ their charge. Efforts were accordingly made to discover an outlet in some other direction; but the Government of the Straits Settlements, Sarawak and the Fiji Islands were unwilling to receive emancipated Africans, and the reply of the Government of British North Borneo was not entirely favourable. Matters remained as they were until 1897, when the Government of India themselves began to entertain objections to the importation of liberated negroes into India and suggested to ^'©r Majesty's Governments an arrangement by which freed slaves should instead be sent to East Africa. The authorities in Zanzibar haying signified their approval of the scheme and held _ out a prospect ot employment for emancipated slaves in the Sultan's plantations m Zanzibar and Pemba, the Residents at Bushehr and Baghdad were also consulted; the former. Colonel Meade, replied that the proposal was unobjectionable, unless on the ground of expense; while the latter. Colonel Loch, reported that the slaves released in Turkish Iraq almost always belonged to the domestic servant class and were unwilling _ to leave the country after emancipation, and that, from the Baghdad point of view, no arrangements were necessary. The scheme was according y sanctioned by Her Majesty's Government in 1889 and has been conti nuously enforced ever since. Manumitted slaves are now ordinarily sent by native sailing vessels from Masqat to Zanzibar at a cost ot about Rs. 15 a head: but in some cases, when vessels under trustworthy masters are not available, it has been found necessary to despatch them by steamer at a cost of abont Rs. 160 each Between February 1900 and May 1902, 85 manumitted slaves were despatched irom Masqat to Zanzibar, of whom only 7 were sent by steamer. These arrangements have received the approval of His Majesty's Government, by whom the cost of the slaves' passages is borne. Until 1900 it was the invariable practice that fines levied on the ^P e sal ot subjects of Arab Shaikhs in the Persian Gulf on account of offences ^ o ^ nt connected with the slave trade should be recovered from the chiefs and of s ) ave . credited to the British Government, by whom all the charges connected trading with the suppression of the slave trade and the liberation of slaves were offences in defrayed. In 1900, however, on the recommendation of Mr. Gaskin the Gulf. Assistant Political Agent in Bahrain, and of Colonel Kemball, Political Resident, the Shaikh of Bahrain was permitted to retain a fine, on condition of not returning the money to the person fined; and the Secretary of State for India and the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury agreed that a similar procedure mi g ht ;, be future, in the case of the Shaikh of Bahrain and the Trnaa Sha khs and that the proceeds of fines need no longer be credited to the British Exchequer. The question of the disposal of the money m each case has2492 been Irft, however, to the discretion of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; and the sums realised are still withheld from the local authorities when there is reason to think that their return to the Shaikh might indirectly render the punishment nugatory. History of the external slave trade of the Persian Gulf and of British preventive operations, 1852-73. Commence ment of sjstematio operations, 1852. Operations during the KeBidentship of Captain Kembali, 1852-55. We now pass on to consider the manner in which the agreements obtained and the enactments passed by the British Government have been utilised for the suppression of the slave trade in the Persian Gulf; and in doing so we need not go further back than 1852, one of the earliest years in which the legal position in the Gulf, in consequence of the arrangements then recently made with the Turkish and Persian Governments, was such as to admit of general action^ With the Hrst operations of all, about to be described, though they did little more than demonstrate the magnitude of the evil, the names of Captain (afterwards Colonel Sir) A. B. Kembali and of Captain Felix Jones, Indian Navy, two successive Political Residents at Bushehr, are honourably associated. In the summer of 1852 the steam vessel Tigris^ of the Indian Navy, Lieutenant Tronson, was placed on slave duty in the Gulf with orders to watch the Batinah coast and other suspected localities; but her equipment was unsuitable for the duties that she had to perform, and the results of her cruise were inconsiderable. It was at once realised by Captain Kembali, the Political Resident, that no assistance was to be expected from natives of the Gulf • and, even at this early stage of the operations, the Resident suggested that preventive measures would probably be more efficacious if they were taken on the African coasts from which the slaves were exported. In 1853, the slave trade having been shown to prevail in the Gulf to an appalling extent, Captain Kembali recommended naval surveillance of the Batinah and East African coasts ; but there was a serious deficiency of ships, and the Government steamship ' Queen, ,, which was made available for a short time, apparently effected nothing; some slaves were captured, however, by the H.E.I. Company's Schooner Constance/'' A few months later, at the beginning of ]854 ; Captain Kemball renewed his representations and advised that a steamer, with a small sailing vessel to assist her, should be sent to cruise off the South Arabian coast in the latitude of Makalla from the 15th of March to the 1st of June; but again there was difficulty in providing a suitable vessel, and none was sent until 1855, when the ' Queen,^ in the month of July, began to cruise off the ^Oman coast between Ras-al-Hadd and Masqat, and was relieved later in the season by the corvette ' Falkland/'' The operations of 1855 were absolutely barren of results. From 1852 to 1855 inclusive, the number of slaves liberated by the British authorities in the Gulf was 78, of whom only 15 were rescued at sea. l|(f?7 2493 feiiil In 1855 Captain Kemball was replaced by Captain Felix Jones, Operations 11 iJ who quickly came to the conclusion that slaves for the Persian Gulf t^he ^Id were chiefly landed in southern ■'Oman and who recommended^ as his predecessor had done^ that cruising against slavers should be con- y e ii x Jones, ducted outside, rather than within^ the limits of the Gulf ; he suggested 1855-62. the formation of a slave squadron of specially equipped steam vessels, to patrol chiefly in the neighbourhood of Maslrah Island and of Zanzibar ; iJI j|j and he pointed out that serious political difficulties in the Persian Gulf would be avoided if the traffic could be dealt with at a distance and prevented from reaching the Gulf. The virtual legalisation^ by the Agreement of 1845 with the ruler of Masqat and Zanzibar, of the slave trade upon a section of the East African Coast was now found to afford nwi P rac ^ ce g^at facilities for a trade in slaves between those shores and the Persian Gulf. In the summer of 1856 the corvette ' Falkland 33 cruised against slavers in the outer Gulf between Jashk and Sohar^ with moderate success, but slaves continued to reach the Persian coast higher up in large numbers. In Trucial ''Oman, under the Engagement of 1856 by which the Shaikhs undertook to surrender imported slaves after landing, something was at length achieved in the liberation of a number of slaves. In 1859 the 'Tigris''' and ' Falkland ^ were employed to intercept, if possible, slavers known to be returning from East Africa to Trucial ^Oman; but only one considerable seizure was effected. The number of slaves captured at sea in 1856 and 1857 was 15, while the total number manumitted by British officers in the Gulf during the same two years was 96. No slaves at all were liberated in 1855 and, the figures for 1858 to 1862 are not ascertainable. In 1860 Captain Joneses proposals of 1855 were adopted, almost in their entirety, by Brigadier General Coghlan in reporting upon the East African slave trade. There is a deficiency of information in regard to the slave trade in I 862 the Persian Gulf during the years 186^ to 1873; but it would appear that, in the beginning at least, the trade was almost as active as ever. In 1834 Mr. Blane, the British Resident at Bushehr, placed the number of slaves exported in the preceding season from the East African coast in the direction of the Persian Gulf at about 12,000; but this number, depending on native statements only, must be regarded as conjectural. Calculations and observations made about ten years later showed the number imported by sea into the countries surrounding the Persian Gulf— exclusive, apparently, of the ^Oman Sultanate, Persian Makran, Qatar and Hasa—to be about 3,500 annually. In 1860 it was estimated by Brigadier General Coghlan that about 4,000 slaves were carried away every year from Africa to Arabia and the Persian Gulf; but in the following year Colonel Pigby, the Political Agent at Zanzibar^ was inclined to place the annual exportation from Fast Africa northwards at a figure so high as 10,000. In the circumstances it cannot be doubted, especially as British preventive action had not yet been made effective, that in the years immediately following 1862 the slave trade to the Persian Gulf still flourished with almost unabated vigour. Towards the end of the period under consideration however, the cruises against slavers making for the Persian Gulf began to yield better results. In June 1871 H,M.S. a Magpie ^ captured three slave ships off Ilas-al-Hadd ; 62 m2494 slaves thus obtaining their freedom ; and in September 1872 H.M.S. Vulture ' took possession of a large Baghlah, in which were 169 slaves, mostly women and children. In the latter case the Nakhuda of the vessel and his son were imprisoned by the Sultan of ; Oman, and the vessel itself was condemned and destroyed. In 1872. all chiefs having treaties with Great Britain relating to the traffic in slaves were reminded of their obligations under the same; and numerous other steps were taken for combating the trade. Conditions of It has been stated above that domestic slavery in the Persian Gulf the traffic bet- i s 0 f a type, but mildness was not a characteristic of the conditions ween East the Gulf was at this time supplied with slaves: on the ^PersMan contrary the methods of the exporters from Africa appear to have been Gulf. characterised by a barbarity equal to that of their compeers in^ any pait of the world. A number of the ' Times of India appearing in October 1872, contained the following description of the slave vessel taken by the Vulture*' :— 'The number of slaves it was impossible at the time to estimate; so l( crowded on deck, and in the hold below was the dhow, that it seemed but for the aspect of misery, a very nest of ants.^ The hold, fiom ' which an intolerable stench proceeded, was several inches deep in the foulest bilge-water and refuse. Down below, there were numbers of 'children and wretched beings in the most loathsome stages of small-pox 'and scrofula of every description. A more disgusting and degrading ' spectacle of humanity could hardly be seen, whilst the foulness of the dhow was such that the sailors could hardly endure it. When the slaves ' were transferred to the Vulture the poor wretched creatures were ' so dreadfully emaciated and weak, that many had to be carried on 'board, and lifted for every movement. How it was that so many ' survived such hardships was a source of wonder to all that belonged to ' the Vulture. On examination by the surgeon, it was found that there ' were no less than 35 cases of small-pox in various stages ; and from ' the time of the first taking of the dhow to their landing at Butcher e 'Island, Bombay, 15 died out of the whole number of 169, and since 'then there have been more deaths amongst them. But perhaps the ci most atrocious piece of cruelty of the Arabs was heard after war s ' from the slaves themselves ; viz., that at the first discovery of small- 'pox amongst them by the Arabs, all the infected slaves were at once ' thrown overboard, and this was continued day by day, until, they said, 'forty had perished in this manner. When they found the disease ' could not be checked, they simply left them to take their chance, and &lt;' to die. Many of the children were of the tenderest years, scarcely more ^ than three years old, and most of them bearing marks of the brutality ''of the Arabs in half-healed scars, and bruises inflicted from the lasH and stick/'' The exporters of slaves from Africa to the Persian Gulf were mostly Arabs, who were accustomed to proceed to Zanzibar for the purpose of legi timate trade during the north-eastern monsoon, that is between November and February, and who generally returned, bringing slaves, either just before or just after the south-west monsoon, viz., in the months of April, Hfri2495 j tf(f i¥. xMay and June or in those of September and October. The distance from Zanzibar to Sur is about 2,500 miles, and the voyage generally occupied 16 to &amp;5 days. History of the external slave trade of the Jfersian Gulf and of British preventive operations, 1873-1907. The attention of the public at home had now been attracted by the East African slave trade. In 1871 a Select Committee of the House of Commons was appointed to enquire into the subject; and in 1873 Sir Bartle Frere was despatched on a mission to Zanzibar and Masqat, at the latter of which places he succeeded in arranging a Treaty already described, with the Sultan. In 1874 H.M.S. a London ^ arrived on the Zanzibar station, where she had been sent for the express purpose of preventing the exportation of slaves from the East African coast; she remained at Zanzibar for nearly ten years and was instrumental, largely by means of her steam launches, in reducing the traffic to unprecedentedly small proportions. During the ten years which followed Sir Bartle Frere's mission to Almost corn- Zanzibar and Masqat the trade in slaves from Africa to the Persian Gulf seemed to have been practically suppressed. In 1873 proclamations were tra e de issued by the British authorities in the Gulf, warning British subjects f rom Africa, there of the penalties which they would now incur by engaging in the 18^-83. tmffic; and in the years following, until the attitude of tho British Government had become well known, these were periodically republished. In 1873-74 very few slaving vessels from abroad arrived in the Persian Gulf, and no captures were effected. In 1874-75 the position continued to be satisfactory. In 1875 H.M .S. a Daphne^ and H.M.S. Rifle man^, under Captain Foot, R.N., were specially employed in patrolling against slavers but none were captured. In 1876 it was reported that the wholesale importation of slaves had been abandoned by dealers, and that the slaves now arriving were brought in very small lots; but the dealers bad begun to conceal their operations by use of the French flag, which secured them against search by British vessels; and in one case a batch of 15 slaves was landed at Matrah from a vessel flying British colours, when no British war-vessel, unfortunately, was at hand to undertake pursuit of her. From 1876 to 1883 the operations of importers apparently continued to be on a very small scale,^ and hopes even began to be entertained that the trade would shortly die a natural death. In 1881 three native vessels were captured by H.M.S, 'Dryad' off the southern coast of Arabia, and of these one was subsequently condemned as a slaver. In 1884 a sudden and serious increase in the importation of slaves Revival of from Africa to the Gulf was remarked. By the British officials in the the trade. Gulf it was attributed to the removal of the ' London 3 from Zanzibar, an event which took place in 1883, and there was much force m their contention that strict surveillance of 500 miles of the African coast would2496 Caplures by H.M.S. ' Philomel' 1884 Captures by H.M.S. ' Osprey' and H.M.S. ' Ranger 1885. be both easier and more effective tban to watcb 2^500 miles of the Arabian coast from Makalla to Basrah; but reports from East Africa showed that other reasons for the increase also existed. The principal of these was a severe famine upon the mainland of Africa, which had brought down the price of slaves there to six shillings a head; but an impression also prevailed at Zanzibar that the British Government, in consequence of reverses in the Soudan, had at last withdrawn their opposition to the slave trade. Importations having become frequent, captures by British cruisers also commenced. In October 1884, when H.M.S. 'Philomel^, Captain Lang, was lying at anchor off Ras-al-Hadd, a native vessel was sighted coming up ' from the south-west and was pursued by the 'Philomel^ under sail only; on a gun being fired across her bows as a signal to heave to she made straight for the coast, but she was intercepted by the 'Philomel ', which had meanwhile got up steam. The Nakhuda of the Arab vessel and five slave dealers succeeded in escaping to the shore In a small boat, but three dealers were captured by the ' PhilomeFs ' boats and three on board of the vessel. The ship was found to contain 128 male and 26 female slaves of the Wazaramo tribe, all of whom were in a wretched condition, having been without food or water for two days; and corre* spondence was discovered on board which threw considerable light upon the slave trade. The prize, of which the destination was shown to^ be Khadhra in Batinah, was condemned, with her cargo, in the Vice- Admiralty Court at Masqat; and the slave traders captured were imprisoned by the Sultan of ''Oman in Fort Mirani. At Masqat Captain Lang received a telegram from the Admiral, directing him to proceed at once to Aden; and on the 18th of October, on his way there, he fell in with a suspicious Sambuk a little to the northward of Masirah Island. On boarding her she was found to be the &lt;( Fatah-al-Khair 33 of Sur, bound for a port in Batinah; she had on board 30 male and 21 female slaves; and besides the Nakhuda, who was also owner, she carried four passengers and a crew of eight men, the passengers being the proprietors of the slaves. The slaves were removed to the ' Philomel }&gt; and the Sambuk was at first taken in tow; as, however, she proved to be unseaworthy, the crew and passengers with their effects were transferred to the ' Philomel 33 on the 23rd of October and the vessel itself was burned. On the 26th of October the ' Philo mel^ reached Aden, where the slaves and cargo were disposed of accord ing to law and the destruction of the prize was confirmed by the Vice- Admiralty Court. The Nakhuda and the slave dealers were afterwards sent to Masqat and imprisoned there by the Sultan of ''Oman in Fort Jalali. In the early part of the ensuing season no vessels of the Royal Navy could be spared for cruising against slavers. Later on three ships were sent, and of these H.M.S, ' Osprey ^ succeeded, on the 19th of September 1885, in capturing a vessel with 73 slaves; and, ten days after, H.M.S. a Eanger' seized a fishing boat off Sur, in which were two slaves recently disembarked from a slaver. In the former case the vessel was condemned in the Vice-Admiralty Court at Masqat and the dealer punished with imprisonment by the Sultan of ; Oman, ft. he k % I ailie i 2497 It was remarked in this year by Captain Dowding^ R.N., the Senior Sur an Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf, that Sur was one of the chief emporia i m P or tant of the traffic from Africa; and he suggested that steps should be taken, Afrioan skve apparently by the British Government, to strengthen the authority of trade, 1885 the Sultan at Sur. The political authorities, however, whose informa tion led them to believe that Sur was not an obligatory port of call for slavers and that such vessels frequently ran direct from Murbat in Dhufar to their final destination, which was generally in Batinah, did not support the proposal, and no action was taken. In 1886 operations against slavers entering the Gulf were undertaken Extensive on a large scale; H.M.S. a Reindeer/■ , a Woodlark,^ a Kingfisher ' and British ' Sphinx 33 were employed on this duty from the 25th of April to the ^P|rations, 18th of June, and the a Woodlark 33 and 'Kingfisher^ from July to the 'ZSth of October. About 200 Arab craft were stopped and searched, but of these only one, captured by the ' Woodlark 33 on the 16 th of June, contained any slaves ; they numbered 21. Most of the vessels examined were found in ballast, and the masters explained that they had landed ordinary cargoes on the southern coast of Arabia. It was certain, how ever, that many slaves had been shipped for the African coast in this year, and subsequently, in a manner not fully ascertained, considerable numbers of ic raw 33 slaves began to reach Batinah and other parts of ^Oman, from which it was concluded that the trade had not been suppressed but only diverted into some new channel. Systematic cruising against slavers in the Persian Gulf and adjacent Course of waters was continued after this from season to season, but for a time events, 1887- there were no further successes; in 1890, however, H.M.S. ^ ' Cossack 33 took and destroyed near Eas Jumailah an Arab vessel which had fired on her boats. The trade, in some unaccountable manner, was still actively carried on and even appeared to increase, the inhabitants of Batinah being, as before, very deeply implicated ; and in 1890 the Shaikhs of Trucial 'Oman were formally reminded by the British authorities of their treaty obligations in regard to the traffic. The use of the French flag by slave traders to protect their vessels tjg e 0 f ^ from seizure by British cruisers had begun, as we have seen, about 1875 ; French flag and by 1891 it had become somewhat common among the subjects of the and growth Sultan of 'Oman. In 1892 the practice appeared likely to be extended to ^ ^t the vessels of Trucial 'Oman, and in the same year slave cargoes began to reach Basrah under French colours. It should be mentioned, how- 1896. ever, in extenuation of the responsibility of the French Government, that the use of their flag by slave traders was often unauthorised and fraudulent. The whole matter of the French flag is discussed, in its political aspect, in the histories of the 'Oman Sultanate and Trucial ; Oman, Here it is enough to mention that the Sultan of Oman was early assured, on the authority of the Government of India, that his subjects could not be removed from his jurisdiction by the acceptance of #1 a foreign flag; but the precariousness of that ruler's position at Sur and his fear of the French Government deterred him from taking action, and the evil steadily grew. 1891- mj—m—i iii ! i if; 5 || ii m3498 Inquiries made by Major Hayes Sadler, Political Agent at Masqat, i® c ^ ar t in 1894 showed that African slaves were being brought to Sur in vessels uesheam belonging to the port, most of which flew French colours, and that the south-&amp; slaves were ordinarily landed at Sur itself; but the owners of the vessels ike vessels had sympathisers at Ras-al-Hadd and other places, and, when British under cruisers were in the neighbourhood, they were accustomed to receive ishe was a timely warning and to disembark their cargoes at Jumailah or it MO sk Lashkharah on the south-eastern coast, whence the gangs were then le Prencli a marched overland to Sur. At this time the cargoes of slaves ordinarily id there consisted of only five to ten negroes each, but they occasionally amounted W' wei to 50 ; and the total number of slaves imported at Sur was estimated at iation of 300 per annum. The demand in the interior behind Sur was not great, i not slow for the system of irrigation in the J a'alan and Sharqiyah districts did ion. He t not demand slave labour; and the majority of the slaves were dander; consequently re-exported in small vessels to the Batinah district of fertlieless, t 'Oman, where irrigation is mostly from wells, and where some of them &gt; Nakhuds were retained. The balance were distributed from Batinah to Trucial Meed to i 'Oman by land and to the coasts of the Persian Gulf by sea. The ibeewase Jannabah tribe, who were deeply involved in the trade, now proclaimed Itfe openly that their object in taking the French flag was to protect their ^ slaving operations ; and it had become clear that the only way to put an i^ascar an end to the trade was to break up the Sur dep6t, and that the chief 'ili in obstacle in the way of such a step was the attitude of France in regard 5 masters, to her flag and the indifference of her local representatives to the opera tions which it sheltered. Subsequent events thus corroborated is a Probably o striking manner the opinion formed by Captain Dowding in 1885 ; and ler's seizin Sur quickly attained a disreputable prominence in connection with the iters was aft slave trade, not unlike that which Masqat about the same time began to An of t' acquire as a principal emporium of the arms traffic. ^ reeeive( In 1896 the traffic was in full swing at Sur and the slaves Jy ' re-exported thence were being sent chiefly to the port of Wudain in • ^ Batinah and that of Kalba in Shamailiyah, from the latter of^ which they were frequently smuggled by Bedouin dealers across country into the ^ territories of the Trucial Shaikhs. ^in five' Seizures by In 1896 seizures by the commanders of British war-vessels and British Wftr ' other authorities were resumed. In May, as related in an earlier i &gt; ? the y-JT etc ' , paragraph. Lieutenant Seville, the Political Agent at Masqat, himself ^ ^ t captured a vessel with 28 slaves. A few days later H.M J 0 ablet 'Lapwing' took another carrying 14 slaves; and, on information , supplied by the British Consulate at Masqat, the Sultan's officials rescued two recently imported slaves from a boat off Bandar Jissah. aves Two seizures were next made by Commander Baker of H.M S. , e ^rad 'Sphinx/' a very energetic officer of the Royal Navy, J £ •'^Mren cast fresh light upon the modus operandi of the Sur dealers and the • Ihese \ extent to which the protection of the French flag was being abused. , tor the Cruising down the South-Eastern Coast of 'Oman the ' Sphinx ' fell m, Fr e on the 23id of September 1896, with a Sambuk of suspicious appearance traders i] named the ' Salamah 39 ) she possessed French papers, but they were out ^ of tl of date, and about 30 slaves were seen on board. Commander Baker ^ agai^ ] a accordingly towed the Sambuk to Ras-al-Hadd and thence despatched J^derth ' ' % wao c2499 her, in charge' of a British officer, to the British Consul at Masqat, where she arrived on the 28th of September. Again proceeding down the south-eastern coast Commander Baker stopped two more native vessels off Has Madrakah. One of these was obviously full of slaves under hatches ; but her papers, which were French, were in order and she was allowed to proceed. The other was the cc Sa'ad/' carrying about 140 slaves, and, a flaw having been discovered in her papers, which were French also, she was towed by the 'Sphinx' to Masqat and arrived there on the Si9th of September. The ' Salamah' and the a Sa^ad 33 were handed over at 1M asqat to the French ^ ice-Consul for verification of their papers, and this official—the well-known M. Ottavi— was not slow to declare that both vessels were entitled to French pro tection. He also hastened to impugn the vigorous action of the British Commander; but it is understood that he found himself compelled, nevertheless, to hold that over 80 of the Africans on board were slaves. The Nakhudas of both vessels seem to have been subsequently sentenced to imprisonment by a French court at Bourbon; but the sentence was carried out at Masqat, and they languished in the dungeons of the Sultan until January 1898. The vessels themselves, which though according to their French papers they belonged to ports in Madagascar and the Grand Comoro, were in reality owned at Sur and Bu ; Abali in ''Oman, lay beached at Masqat, apparently until the release of the masters. Probably on account of the political difficulties created by Commander Jmportaticms Baker's seizures in 1896, slave cruising by British men-of-war in 'Oman at Suir, 1896- waters was after this virtually discontinued for three years; and the question of the importation of slaves into the Persian Gulf through ; Oman received little attention until 1900, when it was re-examined by Captain Cox, Political Agent at Masqat, in connection with the political problem of the French flag in ''Oman. In June^ of 1900, during a visit to Sur, Captain Cox ascertained by inquiry among the Indian community that during the season just over about 1,000 African slaves had been imported at Sur. Of this number 850 had arrived in five large vessels, of which three carried the French flag and had come into harbour during a visit of M. Ottavi, the French Vice- Consul, to the port; but M. Ottavi, it was observed, delegated the ^ duty of boarding these arrivals to his dragoman ''Abdul 'Aziz, Ruwahi. It was probable that the slaves carried had been disembarked shortly before reaching Sur, but the circumstances made it impossible to believe that M. Ottavi could have been altogether ignorant of the facts. The majority of the slaves imported at Sur in 1900 changed hands there; but a propor tion were gradually distributed northwards by land, and the demand was good, children fetching $120 ; male adults $150, and girls $200 to $300 each. These revelations were interesting, but they led to no practical result, for the French flag question was still unsettled and the danger of offending French susceptibilities made direct measures against the Sui slave-traders impossible : even a friendly appeal to France was considered to he out of the question. In the season of 1901 about 1,000 slaves were again landed at Sur, and six vessels brought large cargoes, three of them under the French flag ; in this year the selling price of strong youths was S130 to $175 and of slave girls $150 to $200. In 1902 it 167 a2500 was reported that slaves were abundant both, in the interior and on the coast of 'Oman, and that the trade was in a flourishing condition.^ The Sultan, however, disregarding the odium, gave all reasonable assistance within his power for the suppression of the traffic; and, with his co-operation, a considerable number of slaves were released at Masqat between 1898 and 1902. Large cap- At this juncture sudden retribution overtook the slave dealers of turea of Sur 'Oman in an unexpected quarter, at nearly 3,000 miles distance from slave traders homes. In the middle of February 190*2 information reached the huese'in East Portuguese Governor of Mozambique, through a Portuguese explorer, Africa, 1902. that a flotilla of Arab vessels of suspicious appearance was anchored m a small inlet of Samuco Bay, less than 100 miles to the north of Mozam bique, in a position such that they were screened from the view of ships passing at sea. The fact was that a body of 'Omani Arabs had formed a large camp at this place and established, virtually^ an armed occupation of the district, where, with the assistance of Nampuita Muno, Shaikh of Samuco, they were actively engaged in the purchase of slaves. An expedition from Mozambique against the Arab camp was immediately organised. On the 8th of March the Portuguese war-vessels San Rafael/' ' Liberal/' and ' Chaimite/' under the command of Captain Leima, met at a rendezvous outside Samuco Bay ; and on^the following day a contingent was landed from the ships and effected a junction \ntn a land force of armed natives commanded by Senhor d'Almeida. The Arabs were surprised in their camp, and terms of surrender were offered them, but were refused. The position was then attacked and^ captured with little or no loss on either side, the Arabs flying with their arms at the sight of the artillery which accompanied the column; they were, however, pursued and captured to the number of 114. Almost all were in possession of breech-loading rifles; and quantities of ammunition tel, along with the camp, into the hands of the Portuguese. The vessels belonging to the 'Omanis twelve in number, were also taken. Oil board ot them was discovered a mass of correspondence written in the Arabic charac •• er and Kiswahili language, which afforded ample documentary proof o o established slave-dealing relations between most of the prisoners and t e Shaikh of Samuco. In the camp 725 slaves were found, who had been collected by Nampuita Muno from various sources, chiefly in the interior, and sold to the 'Omanis at an average rate of £3 a head. Owing to ie enormous number of the prisoners and of the witnesses against them, an _ to the non-availability for a time of a competent judge, the case was no ^ finally disposed of until the 3rd of October 1903, by which time near y a third of the accused had died in confinement. Of the survivors 54 weie sentenced to transportation for 25 years to the^ Portuguese province o Angola on the west coast of Africa; and the Shaikh of Samuco also was brought to justice. ^ At the end of February 1902, a few days before the Samuco affair, an 'Omani vessel named the a Fatah Salam/' belonging to the same gang, was seized by the Portuguese Commandant of the district o Moma ou suspicion of slave-trading and was found to contain arms and ammunition, but no slaves. The crew were brought to trial on the 18tli | of May 1903, and thirteen of them, who survived long enough, were i\2501 transported for 17 years to Angola. The thirteen vessels taken in both affairs were all destroyed. It is interesting to notice that in the Samuco case four of the pri soners were shown to be natives of Stir, while all of them were subjects of the Sultan of ''Oman, and that the prisoners in the Moma case were all Jannabah, and therefore presumably belonged to Sur or its neighbour hood ; in fact the tendency of some inquiries made at Masqat was to show that, with the exception of a few ^Awamir of the Batinah district and five or six others, all the captured Arabs were Bani Bu ^Ali or Jannabah of Sur. The news of the catastrophe reached Sur about the middle of May 1902 and converted the town into a scene of wailing and lamentation. The number of the captives who might have claimed French protection was never ascertained; but it was admitted by one of them before the Portuguese authorities that two of the vessels captured, including that commanded by himself, flew the French flag. This disaster to the slave traders of Sur led to a serious increase in a Subsequent trade in Baluchi slaves which had for some time been carried on, in an eourse of the intermittent manner, from the coast of Persian Makran to the Batinah ^rade, 1892^ coast of 'Oman; but the facts, though of some general importance, will 19 '• be more appropriately described in local paragraphs further on. The Portuguese seizures of 1902 appear to have had a very depressing, and it is to be hoped permanent, effect on the trade in slaves, from East Africa to the Persian Gulf; but it is believed that it still, to some extent, continues. History of the internal slave trade of the Persian Gulf, 18734907. Having disposed of the slave trade of the Persian Gulf from 1873 ^0 1907 in its external aspects, we may now view it from an interior standpoint, with reference chiefly to the distribution of the slaves imported from abroad and to the local traffic in slaves. A division of the subject according to political jurisdictions will here be the most convenient for our purpose. Local history of the slave trade in the Sultanate of 'Oman, 1873-1907. The course of events in the 'Oman Sultanate has been, to some extent, described in reviewing the history of the import trade from Africa, and it is unnecessary to repeat in this place facts already given.2502 1873-75. In April 1873, after the conclusion of his Treaty with Great Britain, a proclamation abolishing the slave trade in all his territories was published by the Sultan of ^Oman; his attitude in regard to the Treaty also had been highly satisfactory, contrasting strongly in this respect with that of his brother Barghash, the Sultan of Zanzibar. For a time, partly in consequence of the fear inspired by Sir Bartle Frere's mission, the traffic in''Oman almost ceased; and in 1875, so far as could be ascertained, only 40 or 50 African slaves were imported, most of whom arrived under the French flag. 1876-77. In 1876 or 1877 several slaves, shipped as passengers, were detected at Masqat on board the British steamer 'Korsia' from Jiddah; they were landed, condemned as fresh importations, and sent to Karachi by the British Consul. About the same time a cargo of 80 ^ Abyssinian slaves was reported to have been landed in ^Oman ; but the circumstances of the case were such that it was impossible for the Sultan to take action. Liberation of In 1878 or 1879 two Indians were released from slavery in Rustaq; Indian slaves, and at the end of 1879 three Indian children were recovered from the 1878-79. possession of a gang of Hadhramaut Arabs, who had brought them from Haidarabad in the Dakkhan and had offered them for sale at Sur. In the latter case the children were sent back to India and the Sultan was left to punish the Hadhramis as he saw fit. 1884. In connection with the revival of the import trade from Africa the Sultan, in June 1884, issued a fresh anti-slavery proclamation in his dominions 3 and in October of the same year he not only repeated the proclamation but wrote letters to the Shaikhs of Trucial 'Oman, requesting them to seize slaves who might be brought to their ports by his subjects. Saiyid Turki, with whom the Treaty of 1873 had been made soon after his accession and who continued to rule until 1888, showed throughout his whole reign a praiseworthy disposition to support the anti-slayery policy of the British Government; and more than once he received the formal thanks of the Government of India for his efforts in the good cause. 1890-93. In 1890 or 1891 an attempt was made to introduce 25 slaves at Masqat from a French mail steamer on a voyage between Aden and Karachi; it resulted in the imprisonment of six Arabs by the Sultan. Similarly the British India steamer 'Kistna,' on arrival at Masqat in September 1891, was found to contain 25 African slaves in charge or Arabs; and the slaves, after being liberated with the assent of the Sultan were sent to Bombay,—a proceeding that elicited a strong protest froni Salih-bin-- , Ali, a turbulent political leader of the Sharqlyah district in the interior. In 1892 there was a marked increase in the slave trade m ^on ' Oman, especially upon the Batinah coast; but Saiyid Faisal, the ruling Sultan, whose attitude in slave trade as in other matters was less satis factory than his father Tnrkr's had been, made light of the question and did nothing beyond issuing a fresh proclamation based on the Treaty of 1873. 1894. in February 1894 an African freeman who had taken a passage on a Baghlah at Lingeh^ on his way from Basrah to Zanzibar, was landed by2503 ues^ 0 the Nakhuda on the Batinah coast and there sold into slavery; but^ information of this outrage having reached Masqat, steps were taken which resulted in the recovery of the negro, the confiscation of the boat, and the imprisonment of the Nakhuda by the Sultan. In February 1896 an armed party of the Yal ^a^ad kidnapped 17 men 1896, from the south Arabian coast, carried them by boat to Batinah, and sold them into slavery in the interior; the affair did not come to light until some time later, when it was reported at Masqat by one of the slaves who had escaped. The Shaikh of the Yal Sa'ad principally concerned was then imprisoned by the Sultan of Masqat and died in confinement, but of the persons abducted only one other could be traced; this individual was ransomed by the British Government from the Bedouins in whose possession he was found. At the end of 1896 a gang of slave dealers in Batinah, who had for some years been dealing with impunity in Baluchi slaves kidnapped from the opposite coast of Makran, were at length brought to book, as was also the Shaikh of Wudam, a port bearing the same relation to the Baluchi slave traffic as Sur to the African. The Shaikh of Wudam was said to be too ill to be brought to Masqat, but the Sultan was prevailed on—not without difficulty—to order the arrest of six of the gang, themselves apparently Baluchis. The accused were tried by a tribunal consisting of Lieutenant Beville, the British Consul at Masqat, and of a representative of the Sultan upon no less than 34 charges of slave dealing, with the result that five of them were convicted and were sentenced by the Sultan to fines varying from $100 to $500 and also to imprisonment. In 1900 a case came to light which pointed to the occasional 1900. exportation of children from famine-stricken districts in Western India, as slaves, to the Persian Gulf. In August of that year a Hadhramauti Arab, arriving at Masqat in the British steamer ' Simla,was^ found to be in possession of three Hindu children from Baroda, whom inquiry showed that he had either purchased or kidnapped and was holding in slavery. The children were sent back to India, and the Arab was extradited and made over to the Baroda State, by one of whose courts he was condemned to two years' rigorous imprisonment. Precautions were also taken by the police of the Baroda State against the recurrence of similar incidents. In 1904 'Abdullah, the Sultan's Jama'dar or military commandant 1904. at Sohar, was shown to have bought slaves exported from Makran to Soharby the Persian Governor of Bashakard and was sentenced by his master, on the representations of the British Political Agent, to three months' imprisonment. It transpired that two of the slaves fought by the Jama'dar had been presented by him to the Sultan himself, who Had accepted them. In 1905, in consequence of an unfavourable award by the Hague i Q05i Tribunal in regard to the French flag in 'Oman, the local repiesentative of the Republic began to exercise a closer supervision over the proceedings of native vessels entitled to use the French colours.2504 Local history of the slave trade in Trucial 'Oman, 1873-1907. was landed at a protest by the 1880-81. In 1880 or 1881 a British Indian subject residing in ''Oman was convicted of a slave trading offence and was punished with fine and imprisonment. 1884. In 1884 a freshly-run cargo of 54 African slaves Dibai, and the Shaikh of that place, disregarding British Residency Agent at Sharjah^ permitted them to be sold. The Agent was thereupon instructed to demand the surrender of all recently imported African slaves in Trucial -'Oman; and a letter was addressed by the Resident to all the Trucial Shaikhs^ reminding them of their obligations under treaty in respect of the slave trade. Later in the year Mr. Robertson^ the Assistant Political Resident^ visited the coast in H.M.S. ' Dragon ^ and was successful in recovering iil of the slaves who had been landed at Dibai^ while the Shaikh produced four others; for onch slave not recovered the Shaikh was obliged to pay a fine of $70. One slave boy was released at Sharjah ; and another at U mm-al-Qaiwain. 1890-91. In 1890 or 1891 fresh reminders as to their duty were addressed to the Shaikhs of Trucial ^Oman and resulted in the liberation of a few slaves. led a desig tk belief 1892. 1894.. 1896. In 189^ complaints become frequent of slave dealing in Trucial ^Oman^ and in November of that year Colonel Talbot^ the Resident, found it necessary to visit the coast in the R.I.M.S. 'Lawrence/' accompanied by H.M.S. a Sphinx and H.M.S. 'Cossack.^ In one instance 33 slaves were shown to have been brought—in a Sur vessel under the French flag—from Zanzibar to Ras-al-Khaimali, whence they had been carried to Khor Fakkan in the same jurisdiction and disposed of. In this case Colonel Talbot authorised a reduction of the customary fine of $70 for each slave, on the ground that the slave dealer and the Shaikh directly in charge of Khor Fakkan were mainly respon sible ; but the fine was nevertheless a heavy one. Five slaves having been recently landed at Hamriyah, the Shaikh of Sharjah was compelled to pay a fine of |550 on account of his feudatory, the local Shaikh; and at Dibai, where two slaves had been imported by a Bahrain subject and a demand by the British Residency Agent for their surrender had been refused, a fine of $250 was exacted. In 1894 the Shaikh of Ras-al-Khaimah was fined $195 on account of one slave sold at that place, and of five slaves brought there for sale by a native of Khadhra in Batinah, but not sold. In February 1896 the Political Resident visited the Trucial Coast in the R.I.M.S. 'Lawrence/' accompanied by H.M.S. 'Lapwing/' to enquire into the alleged importation of about 40 slaves at Abu Dhabi, The Shaikh could not deny the facts, though he tried to minimise them and to extenuate his conduct by alleging a general prevalence of the traffic and even connivance on the part of the British2505 ail; m: Residency Agent; accordingly, after he had produced nine of the slaves in question, he was compelled to pay a fine of $^100 on account of the estimated balance, most of whom were believed to have been shipped to Qatar and to other places. Subsequently it was reported that the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, in consequence of this affair, had formed a design against the life of the Residency Agent at Sharjah; and, as the belief appeared to be not altogether unfounded, a warning was conveyed to him. There was reason to think that the assertions of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi in regard to prevalence of the trade along the whole Trucial Coast had a considerable substratum of truth, but no definite proofs could be obtained. In the same year a party of Baluchi slaves brought from Wudam were sold in Dibai, and two who escaped from that place fell into the hands of Arabs at Khan; proceedings however were taken which resulted in the conviction, as already men tioned above, of a number of slave dealers in Batinah. In December 1899 Colonel Meade, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, visited the ports of the Trucial Shaikhs and urged them pjj to take steps for more effectively suppressing the slave traffic; the Shaikhs, however, were deaf to his exhortations, and with one voice denied that there was any importation of slaves into their territories by sea. The Shaikh of Sharjah alone went so far as to admit that slaves were imported by Bedouins from ''Oman into Trucial ^Oman by land. It was generally alleged on the Trucial Coast that large number of slaves were being imported into Qatar by sea; but no means existed of verifying the statement, which was considered to be in itself highly jjj y probable. tlieEei In August 1901 a slave girl was imported by sea from Ras-al- 1901 - Laffll Khaimah to Sharjah; she was manumitted and a fine of $70 was !' lH recovered. In 1904 two cases came to light of the sale at Umm-al- Siri Qaiwain of Persian boys kidnapped by Baluchis from the opposite coast; wki j in each case the buyer was fined $100 and was sentenced to imprison ment. On the 5th of September 1901 two slaves obtained their freedom on board H.M.S. 'Sphinx' at Dalmah Island. They stated that they had been kidnapped from Africa three years before and brought to Sur, whence, two years later they had been re-exported to Sharjah. This last case illustrated the well-known fact that the condition of slaves in the Persian Gulf is not a hard one, except in so far as they are employed by their masters for pearl-diving, and that on the Arabian coast it is generally the fear of being sent to sea that drives slaves to rr g]i abscond. on a® |r Local history of the trade in Bahrain, 1873-1907. rip( In October 1889 the British Residency Agent in Bahrain reported 1889. that more slaves than usual had been brought home by pilgrims return- fa ing from Makkah; the Shaikh however, in this case, showed loyalty ^ to his engagements, and 15 of the new slaves were traced and set at ^berty with his co-operation.2506 1895. In the autumn of 1895, during the presence of British warships off Bahrain in connection with the Zubarah crisis, a number of slaves took refuge at the British Agency in Manamah and claimed their freedom ; a number were found to be entitled to it, and on one occasion so many as 31 individuals were liberated. Three of the slaves emancipated belonged to the refractory colony of Dawasir Arabs at Budaiya' and Zallaq, who expressed great dissatisfaction and threatened to emigrate from Bahrain ; and the example of the Dawasir was followed by some of the Sadah of Hadd and of the Al Bu Falasah tribe. The movement for liberty among slaves in Bahrain seems at this time to have assumed serious proportions j and the British authorities apparently found it necessary to give an assurance to the leading men of Bahrain that the emancipation of all slaves was not contemplated; it was added, however, that all cases of fugitive slaves would continue to be investigated, and that &lt;( recent importations and ill-treated slaves ' would be freed. In November 1895 it was reported by the Commander of H.M .S. 'Pigeon' that the Arab slave owners of Bahrain had volun teered to give a written undertaking to the Shaikh that they would not in future buy, sell or give away slaves; but no advantage, apparently, was taken of this offer. After these arrangements had been made the Arabs again settled down • some Al Bu Falasah who had left the islands returned to their homes; and slaves ceased for a time to apply for manumission. 1900. In 1900 Ahmad-bin-Sa'ad, a native of Kuwait residing in Bahrain, was convicted of re-enslaving a boy who had received papers of manumission from the British Consul at Ba-srah, and was fined $100 by the Shaikh of Bahrain,—a penalty to which the Government of India took exception as inadequate. 1Qn . Matters continued on the footing of 1895 until ten years later, when Captain Prideaux, the Political Agent in Bahrain, brought it to the notice of the Government of India that the importation of slaves, chiefly Africans, steadily continued in Bahrain, the principal offenders being the Sadah of Hadd and the Dawasir of Budaiya/ and Zallaq; ne estimated that the number of the slaves in Bahrain who had been imported since 1847, and were therefore in his view entitled to freedom, miffht now be reckoned in thousands. Captain Prideaux recommended that steps should be taken to deal with the evil by the gradual extinction of the institution of slavery in Bahrain on principles which had been adopted in Zanzibar in 1891, and he made also some alternative suggestions; but the Government of India considered the objections ao-ainst the Political Agents proposals to be insuperable and directed, instead, that no effort should be spared to detect and suppress tresn importations of slaves j that every facility for obtaining manumission papers should be afforded to newly imported slaves ; that encouragement to applv for their freedom should not be offered to slaves who had been long domiciled in the islands ; and that, in the event of long domiciled slaves applying of their own accord for manumission, each case should be considered on its merits with especial reference to the treatment ot the slave, past and prospective, by his master. The Political Agen was also authorised for the future, on the analogy of the practice atMasqat; to issue certificates of manumission himself without reference to the Political Resident at Bushehr • in doing so he was to consult the Shaikh of Bahrain^ but he was not^ in practice^ to give the Shaikh any option of withholding his consent. We shall have occasion to return to this correspondence further on in connection with the question of domestic slavery in the Persian Gulf. In 1906 or 1907 the Shaikh of Bahrain^ at the instance of the 1906-07, Political Agents recovered a fine of Rs. 500 from an Arab who was proved to be in possession of a freshly imported African slave and to have acted cruelly towards two other slaves in his possession. Local history of the slave trade in Qatar, Hasa and Kuwait^ 1873-1907. The records of Government contain few references to the slave trade 1896-99. in Qatar, Hasa and Kuwait, where however it is undoubtedly no less prevalent than elsewhere in the Gulf. In 1896 reason was found for believing that there was some exportation of slaves from Trucial ^Oman to Qatar; and in 1899 it was stated in Trucial ^Oman that many slaves were being brought to Qatar by sea» In 1904 a female slave, who had been left for sale with an inhab-1904. itant of Bahrain by a native of Qatar, took refuge at the British Agency and was manumitted. A fine of $100 was recovered from the Bahrain . subject, and it was intended that the Qatari should be similarly punished • but in the case of the latter no means of enforcing the penalty could be found. Local history of the slave trade in Turkish 'Iraq, 1873-1907, It does not appear that the importation of slaves into Turkish ; Iraq has ever, at least in recent years, been carried on upon any considerable scale. About 1890, however, Colonel Tweedie, the British Resident at Baghdad, who was satisfied that the trade existed to a certain extent, requested the Consul at Basrah to persevere in urging the Wali of Basrah to do his utmost for its suppression. Reports were received from time to time of the passage of slave cargoes up the Shatt-al-'Arab, but in no instance were they fully substantiated, la 1891 or 189^ a proclamation, drafted in accordance with the terms of the Treaty of 1880 between Great Britain and Turkey, was received from his Government by the Turkish Consular Agent at Ling eh, for the iflformation of Turkish subjects residing at that place. In 1893 the Assistant Political Agent reported the existence at Basrah and in2508 the neighbourhood of a small trade in slaves, managed with great secrecy and care. At the present day, so far as can be ascertained, the importa tion of slaves by sea into the Basrah Wilayat has fallen to negligeable proportions. Local history of the slave trade in 'Arabistan^ 1873-1907. The attention of the Government of India has not, apparently, ever been drawn to any importation of slaves into ^Arabistan. Local history of the slave trade on the coast of Fars and at the Gulf Ports, 1873-1907. 1876-77. In 1876 or 1877 it was reported that slaves were being introduced into Persian territory through Qishm and Bandar 'Abbas, but the local Persian authorities declined to discuss the matter. The a Rokeby' case at Bushehr in 1877 has already been described above ; and here it may be added that, though it was clear that other slaves besides the boy recovered through the Karguzar had been landed from the steamer, the Persian authorities took no action upon very definite information which was supplied to them by the British Residency. The remissness of the Persian officials at Bandar 'Abbas and Bushehr having been reported to the British Legation at Tehran, a special Commissioner was nominated by the Persian Government to enquire into their conduct; but nothing seems to have resulted from this measure. 1881-82. In 1881 it was discovered that some Indian lads had been sold as slaves at Shiraz by Persian horse dealers, and action was taken by the British Legation at Tehran; in the result one of the slaves was recovered and several of the dealers were punished. In the following year another Indian boy was rescued from slavery at Shiraz. 1884. I n 1884 three Africans, residing in the British settlement of Basidu, were kidnapped near Lingeh; but the Residency Agent at the latter place succeeded in obtaining their release through the Shaikh of Mughu. 1888, In September 1888 information was received that seven fresh African slaves from Sur had been imported at Lingeh, and efforts were made by the British authorities to secure the release of the slaves and the punishment of those concerned in their importation ; but the action and attitude of the local Persian officials completely frustrated their endea vours in both respects. Curiously enough, however,, the Dallal who imported the slaves died from the sting of a hornet immediately after the institution of enquiries. Subsequently the Governor of the Gulf2509 Ports issued a notification to the effect that persons engaging in the slave traffic would be punished, and the customs farmer was enjoined to bring all cases of importation to the notice of the authorities. In 1890 two slaves swam off to the British steamer a Calder at ^0-91, Lingeh and claimed protection as British subjects from Aden. The trade in slaves was now brisk at Charak and on Qais Island, at neither of which places would the inhabitants suffer the Persian Deputy- Governor of Lingeh to hold any investigation ; but an order prohibiting the traffic was published by the Governor of the Gulf Ports at the request of the British Political Resident. In 1891 there were reports of impor tation of fresh slaves as Qishm, and an enquiry was held by the Governor of the Gulf Ports, who eventually declared the statements to be without foundation. In 1896 an attempt made on the Persian coast to re-enslave a free- 1896. man was defeated by his recovery at Lingeh, where he was taken on board H. M.S. 'Sphinx.' At Hanjam in 1904^ shortly after the reopening of the British 1904. telegraph station on the island, a Baluchi slave boy escaped from an Arab Baghlah belonging to the village of Suzeh on Qishm Island and took refuge in the telegraph station, complaining that he had been sub jected to ill-usage, and that attempts had been made to sell him at Lingeh and on the coast of Trucial ^Oman. This slave was liberated ; but no steps were taken, on account of technical difficulties, for adjudica tion of the vessel from which he had escaped. One consequence of the case was the extension to Hanjam of certain instructions, to be noticed further on, which had been issued by the Government of India in 1885 regarding the treatment of fugitive slaves seeking refuge at British telegraph stations on the Persian mainland; and notice was also drawn to the fact that the registration, naming, and numbering of native vessels were not qarried out at Persian ports in accordance with the terms of the General Act of the Brussels Conference, and that crew and passenger lists were not maintained on Persian vessels as required by the Act. The attention of the Persian Government was directed by His Majesty^s Legation to their neglect of these important provisions; and instructions were issued from Tehran, but without any visible result, to the local Persian officials in the Gulf. It was further suggested by Sir A. Hardinge, the British Minister at Tehran, that steps might be taken to obtain a transfer of the responsibility for enforcing the provisions in question from the local governors to the Imperial Persian Customs ; and M. Naus, the Persian Minister of Customs, privately signified his readi ness to agree to such an arrangement; but the Government of India deprecated the proposal on the ground that it would lead to indiscriminate detention and search of all native vessels by the Customs, and it was not proceeded with. It should be observed that the Persian Governor of the Gulf Ports at this time raised a contention that the Brussels Act was only applicable to African slaves. In 1907 it was reported by the British Resident at Bushehr that 1907. there were certainly in Shiraz, and probably throughout lars, large numbers of slaves who must have been imported into Persia by sea since reel3510 1882, in defiance of the Convention concluded that year for the sup pression of the traffic in slaves. It was said that since 1903 the Persian authorities at Shiraz had exerted the most ingenuity to avoid carrying- out the stipulations of the Convention, and that strong local pressure and frequent references to the British Minister at Tehran had been necessary. Local history of the slave trade in Persian Makran, 1873-1907. 1884-85. In 1884 or 1885 an Indian Khalasi, who had at some previous time been a slave but had succeeded in escaping to Karachi, was kidnapped at Chahbar by his former master and carried off to Parag. The Persian authorities were addressed on the subject, but with what result does not appear. 1896. In 1896, as already mentioned in the paragraph on the slave trade in the ■'Oman Sultanate, a gang of Baltic his on the Batinah coast, who dealt chiefly in slaves purchased or kidnapped from Makran, were brought to justice. At the time of its being broken up, the gang in question had been carrying on its operations with impunity for several years. 1%3. The traffic in slaves from Makran to Arabia again came to notice in 1903, when it was reported that some men of the Jashk district and some Jadgals of Bahu and Dashtyari were purchasing slaves, from the inhabitants of Bahu and from Kalat subjects in Dasht, and were selling them to merchants from the ^Oman coast, who came over to buy. The principal places of export were then Tank and Wank in the Bir district ; but slaves were also shipped at Galag and Sadaich. Many of the slaves exported were Africans, but among them were now some low class Baluchis who had been sold by petty headmen. Attention was first drawn to this trade by a sudden influx of fugitive slaves into the free port of Gwadar, as mentioned further on. 190!. In 1904 the trade, in its new form, was greatly stimulated by the lawless proceedings of Said Khan, Chief of Gaih, who scorned the country with an armed retinue, reducing poor Baluchis to slavery and selling them ; the profits of his misdeeds were mostly invested in rifles and ammunition. His example was quickly followed by Mir Barkat of Jashk, who formed a gang for slave-dealing operations and refused to desist, though frequent remonstrances were addressed to him by Mullas and influential Baluchis of Jashk. The victims of the traffic were now drawn not only from the districts already mentioned, but also from the Gaih and Bint neighbourhoods, and even from Bashakard. The enslavement of free Muhammadans is contrary to the law of Islam; but Said Khan and Mir Barkat nevertheless found many imitators on a smaller scale. One of those was a ruffian named Shai-bin-Sha J ban who at first made his headquarters at Jashk; and it was estimated that, from this port rJone. 450 slaves were exported to Arabia during the three years ending in 1904,3511 In 19D4 Shai-birt-Sha'ban came to a violent and well-deserved end in cronse quence of a quarrel with Mir Bark at, whom he had offended by transfer- ring 1 his operations from Jashk to Sadaich, a step by which Bark at was deprived of his former half-share in the proceeds of Shar's business. Shai ; ^ii having been decoyed to Jashk on a pretext of negotiations, was there trea cherously attacked at night by the Mir's men and lost 12 of his followers killed ; 'he fled to Jagin, but was pursued thither by Barkat and slain with 25 more of his men ; 27 others of his gang and the whole of his j property next fell into the hands of the hardly less infamous Mir. Shortly before his death Shai had sold 49 slaves at an average of $150 each, and it was said that the plunder taken by Barkat from his camp W| was ^ worth $4,000. Of Shar's followers only 11 escaped, but these were desperate men, and it was expected that they would afterwards give trouble in the Jashk district; up to the present, however, though there reyioust have been several scares, they have not succeeded in committing any out- is lit rages. In 1904 there was also another smaller, but active, gang of nine slave-dealers, established at Gabrig. About this time 'Ali Raza Khan, the chief of Bashakard, with his sons Muhammad Khan and Alak, raided Jagin Balad, a x^laceon the Jagin River about 45 miles north or north-east of Jashk, and captured a number of women and children whom he exported as slaves to Sohar in 'Oman. It was the purchase of some of these by the JamaMar of Sohar which brought that functionary into trouble, as already mentioned. Of 95 slaves manumitted at Masqat in 1904-05 no less than 60 were Persians or Baluchis who had been exported from Makranto the Batinah coast. In 1905 the export trade from Makran had again apparently ceased. Local history of the slave trade at Gwadar, 1873-1907. i'l The course of events at Gwadar, a dependency in Makran of the Sultanate of 'Oman, deserves a short separate notice. By a clause in the Treaty of 187B the Sultan of^ Oman had bound 18 7 5-91. himself to treat as free all persons entering his dominions after that date, and the British Assistant Political Agent at Gwadar frequently insisted on the liberation of slaves owned by the troublesome Rind tribe in the vicinity, who had escaped from their masters and taken^ refuge at the port. These manumissions, aided by other causes, occasioned, after 1875, some difficulties with the Rinds, which are fully described in the history of Gwadar, and by which the British telegraph establishment, as well as the Sultan's government, were from time to time sufferers. In May 1892 the Rinds demanded the surrender of 70 absconded 1892-94 slaves by the Gwadar authorities ; but it was refused, and, during the winter of 1892-93, fugitives continued to arrive at Gwadar, where by May 1893 they had collected to the number of several hundreds. At this point, in order to avert serious trouble, the refugees were persuaded to leave Gwadar for British India, some of them being even provided with the means of doing so by the British authorities. The situation, however,2612 1903. continued critical until the beginning of 1894, when, as related in the history of Gwadar ? an agreement was obtained from the Rinds by which they bound themselves to make no more disturbances at Gwadar on account of fugitive slaves, while the British Government, on their part, undertook that released slaves should not be allowed to remain at Gwadar for more than 15 days after their release. In 1903 there was a considerable influx into Gwadar of slaves who believed that their owners intended to sell them into slavery abroad ; it was by this influx that the attention of the British authorities was first directed to the trade in Baluchi slaves which had then recently sprung up in Makran. is, into Domestic slavery in the Persian Gulf. Policy of the British Gov ernment in regard to domestic slavery. ManumisBion of domestic slaves at Masqat. BSsidu case, 1877. Question of runaway sla ves at British telegraph stations in Persia, 1884. We have dealt, thus far, almost exclusively with the slave trade to and in the Persian Gulf as carried on by sea; and, as there is no importation of ' raw ' slaves from abroad by land, it only remains to add a few remarks on the subject of domestic slavery and the traffic in domes tic slaves. Domestic slavery, as practised in the Persian Gulf is of a comparatively harmless character ; and, among the rulers and inhabitants of the countries surrounding the Gulf, there is a strong social and even religious prejudice in favour of its continuance. Por these reasons, and on account of the difficulty of intervening with beneficial effect in the internal affairs of independent and quasi-independent states, the British Government have generally found it necessary to abstain from active interference with domestic slavery in the Persian Gulf; but their officers, as will be apparent from what follows, have none the less steadily exerted themselves to discourage slavery in all its shapes and forms. At Masqat, as has already been mentioned incidentally, it has been the custom for ten years, and probably for longer, occasionally to manu mit, with the consent of the Sultan, domestic slaves who are proved to have been badly treated or whom no owner appears to claim, and to require a guarantee of kind treatment from every master to whom a fugitive slave is returned. In 1877 Haji 'Abbas, the British coal agent at Basidu, was found to be in possession of several slaves, And the Political Resident, considering us conduct to be incompatible with his position under the British Govern ment, dismissed him from his appointment. The Government of however, in view of the facts that the man was a Persian subject, a slavery was recognised by the religion and law of Persia, and tba is duty as an employe of the British G overnment was ' to supply coal and not to regenerate society,^ questioned both the justice and the expediency o his dismissal; and in 1878 Haji ^Abbas was reinstated. In 1884 four runaway slaves took refuge in the British telegraph station at Jashk; and, their restoration having been demanded by the local authorities, they were delivered up by Mr. Patten, the Assist ant Superintendent in charge, on a written guarantee that they would2513 jes ^ 64 oii tl;,. not be ill-treated. The Resident in the Persian Gulf, Colonel Ross, thereupon ordered that runaway slaves should not in future be admit ted to premises owned^ in Persia by the British Government, as the result would be a great influx of slaves, leading* to political complica- tions, into the British stations. These instructions were approved by the Government of India, with the proviso that exception should ^ o! slaJ be made in cases where, owing to the slaves being placed in immi- sfeerj ak» n en t danger or otherwise, considerations of humanity might dictate an opposite course. In 1904, in consequence of a case, described above, which occurred there, the Jashk order was expressly made applicable to Hanjam. mntlj! On the 1st August 1890 a decree was promulgated by the Sultan Proposal to I of Zanzibar, putting an end to the traffic in domestic slaves in his restrict u i dominions, setting various classes of domestic slaves immediately at domestic | liberty, and making it easier for the remainder to obtain their freedom. It was suggested that the adoption of a similar measure should be pressed tanate reject- upon the Sultan of 'Oman ; but the local political officers, to whom this ed, 1891. the m tu proposal was referred, criticised it adversely, pointing out that in the id, as tte: peculiar circumstances of 'Oman any attempt to deal with domestic only Mffl! slavery would be altogether ineffectual on account of the extent and lie trafficiiit lawlessness of the country, while at the same time it might provoke a 'ersianGuI; |dangerous insurrection against the Sultan's authority. Eventually as it jrsandiiib appeared that the Sultan, who declined to issue the decree suggested, ongsocM; could not fairly be urged to do so unless he were also assured of British r these iea» support in case of untoward results, the project was abandoned, iefieialelect i 'When the British Resident, at the end of 1899, visited Trucial Failure of an states, w ^Oman to enquire into slave trade questions, he suggested that, as attempt to hstain J® | was done at Masqat, manumission papers might in some circumstances be * ntl ' 0 ^ u ? e . ; but W granted to slaves taking refuge at the British Agency; but even the of^omestic lesssteadiljfif Shaikh of Sharjah, who was the least obdurate, declined to entertain the s i a ves in Tm- orms. i proposal, on fch^ ground thai his subjects would demand compensation cial 'Oman, utaltyit M of him for every slave released. 1899. asionallj ^ We have already seen, in examining the question of the local slave Proposal to who are trade in Bahrain, that Captain Prideaux, the Political Agent there, restrict laiffl,anM suggested in 1905 the application to the Shaikhdom of the policy which 'lomestic _ whom 2 H had been adopted in Zanzibar in 1891. The Government of India, re^ however, while they declared that it was their object a now, as always, ^ c ted, 1905. ■gidu ^ discourage slavery under any terms, and to move steadily in the L consul f rec tion of its abolition,' considered that there was, as matters stood, 110 real analogy between the situations existing in Zanzibar and in tof ft Bahrain, and that a mistake would be committed if, by precipitate or sentimental action, a slavery question were gratuitously raised in the tlle ^ authorised the manumission of slaves in the future by the Political rSiaI1 JIW ^rsian Gulf.

It will be remem bered that, in Bahrain, it has been the custom for more than ten years to exact a written guarantee of good treatment from every owner to whom a fugitive slave is unavoidably restored. In 1905 it was reported by the Consul at Bandar 'Abbas that, during the preceding year, slaves had frequently sought protection at the Consulate because their masters wished to sell them to strangers: this appears to be principal grievance of domestic slaves in Persia, cor responding to the objection against being sent to sea which prevails among those upon the Arabian side. Parents and relations were, it was stated, selling children into slavery on account of the scarcity then generally prevailing. The report referred, perhaps, chiefly to the country eastward of Bandar'Abbas. Year General results of the British anti-slavery policy in the Persian Gulf. It cannot be questioned that the results of the policy pursued by Great Britain in the Persian Gulf have been highly beneficial. The importation of slaves by sea, whether from abroad or from one country of the Gulf into another, has been greatly restricted; and, in this branch of the trade, slaves are now smuggled with difficulty in small numbers instead of being, as formerly, conveyed openly in large cargoes. Domestic slavery has been greatly mitigated in the 'Oman Sultanate and in Bahrain by arrangements for the manumission of domestic slaves by the British Political Agent, in the former principality with the concurrence of the Sultan and in the latter virtually without the consent of the Shaikh; and domestic slaves are, in special circumstances, protected at British telegraph stations in Persia. The actual^ number of the slaves emancipated is obviously a most inadequate criterion of the goo ^ effected ; but the figures are of interest and are given below, so tai as ascertainable. Year. Number of slaves cap tured at sea and released. Number of fugitive, * recently imported, or domestic slaves released.

It may safely be conjectured that at least 8^000 slaves have obtained their freedom with British assistance in the last 55 years, either on their way to or in the Persian Gulf; and to these must be added the vast but uncertain number whose exportation HDEMlto from their native countries has been altogether prevented by British naval and other measures.

I t is now more than fifty years since the problem of opposing the spread of epidemic disease westwards from Asia began to engage the attention of the European powers ; and within that period the Persian Gulf, as a possible avenue of infection leading from the eastern to tne western continent, has acquired a considerable importance in the eyes of experts. In consequence of the multiplicity of jurisdictions existing in the Gulf and of the rivalries which prevail there between Turkey and Persia and between various European powers, the question of the sanitary precautions to be taken—a question in itself purely scientific and administrative—has become in part political; and it is necessary, there* fore, to give its history at some length in this Gazetteer. The subject, inasmuch as we are concerned with the movement of two distinct diseases—cholera and plague—in two continents, is somewhat complicated. We shall endeavour to simplify it as much as possible by dealing first with the history of cholera up to the present time and of precautionary measures against cholera up to the year 1894, when the * The general history of cholera and plague is given in the appropriate articles in the Encyclopaedia Britannica, 9th Edition, and new volumes. Notices of early epidemics of plague in Turkish 'Iraq will be found in the First Connection of the Honourable East India Company with Turkish Arabia, 1874, while accounts of more recent epidemics in that country are contained in the following communications of Dr. W. H. Colvill, Eesidencv Surgeon at Baghdad letters on Flague tn the Marshes of the Hindieh, in the Proceedings (Political) of the Government of India for August and October 1867 ; Bejport on the Plague tn Mesopotamia, Proceedings tor September 1875 ; and Eeport on the Plague at Baghdad, Proceedings tor Septembei 1876. The cholera epidemic of 1865 in the Persian Gulf is described by Dr. Colvih, in a report forwarded to the Government of Bombay by the Resident in the Persian Gulf Jth his letter No. 46 of the 4th May 1866. An article entitled Notes on Cholera in Persia, by Surgeon-Major T. Ffrench-Mullen in the Persian Gulf Administration Eeport for 1889-90 has a wider scope than its name suggests and gives a general account of the movements of cholera, especially in Western Asia, beginning in the year 1821.

On the Persian side the disease advanced from India along the coast of Makran to Minab, which it reached in May 1865, and spread to Bandar ^Abbas, but died away inland at Darab, Fasa and Jahrum. From Bandar ^ Abbas the cholera travelled along the northern coast of Qishm Island and arrived at Lingeh in August; then it extended along the coast to Kundarun near MughUj Charak, Chiru, Nakhiluand ^Asaluj at ^ Asalu it ceased to advance. In the meantime a separate stream of infection, originating in Hijaz, crossed Arabia in a north-easterly direc tion, visiting the towns of ■'Anaizah and Dara'iyah, and reached the Persian Gulf at Jahrah near Kuwait, where it broke out in encampments of the Mutair and Bani Khalid tribes. Kuwait escaped, but on the 25th or 26th of August the disease appeared in the Dawasir tract on the Shatt- al- Arab, and on the 8th of September at Basrah. In the autumn of 1866 there was a slight epidemic of cholera at Baghdad. Quarantine had already been informally instituted by the Turkish authorities at Basrah on the 25th of May 1864^, and it was formally notified there for the first time with effect from the 1st of January 1865. It is interesting to observe that so early even as 1864 the Turks appear to have contemplated the establishment of a quarantine station at Fao ; but their intention was not, apparently, carried out until later. The Constantinople Cholera Conference, 1866. Technical findings. The necessity of sanitary arrangements for the defence of Europe against Asiatic cholera was now recognised, and an International Con ference, proposed originally by the French Government, met in Constanti nople in February 1866 to consider the question. Eepresentatives of Turkey and Persia, as well as of Great Britain and other European powers, took part in the deliberations. The origin and propagation of cholera were fully discussed for the first time in their scientific aspects, and the Conference finally arrived at the following principal conclusions—that India, where it was permanently endemic, was the prime source of Asiatic cholera; that intercourse, between countries, especially maritime intercourse, was the chief means of propagation ; and that great deserts constituted the most effectual barrier to the progress of the disease. General # The Conference recommended that no efforts should be spared to ex- lecommenda- tinguish the disease at its source in India, and that a scientific system of quarantine by land and sea should be established to prevent its progress westwards, especially in the countries most nearly adjoining India, for it2519 wes terly direction. In 1831 it was reported for the first time in the &gt; M|l jji-jaz province of Arabia ; and in the same year it passed from the con- ^ s 4ji ^nent of Europe into the British Isles, where it occasioned over 50,000 4 ml ^ ea ths in England and Wales alone, and subsequently travelled to France, Spain, Italy and Northern and Central America. This was the first epi- demic^of cholera in Europe, audit continued intermittently till 1837. The second epidemic of cholera in Europe, 1847-49. The second European epidemic originated in India or China in 1841. It soon reached Turkish 'Iraq, Baghad suffering in 1846 and 1847, and the Hiiaz province of Arabia, and lingered in both for some time ; but its arrival in Europe was delayed until 1847, when it swept across Russia, Germany, the British Isles and France, extending a a a er period to America and the West Indies. Bushehr was V1S1 ® 16 disease in the autumn of 1851. This epidemic was more .deadly in Britain and France than the preceding one, and in England alone over 55,000 deaths were registered.

I 1 The Constantinople Cholera Conference, 1866. li Teohnical findings. General recommenda tions. The necessity of sanitary arrangements for the defence of Europe against Asiatic cholera was now recognised, and an International Con ference, proposed originally by the French Government, met in Constanti nople in February 1866 to consider the question. Bepresentatives of Turkey and Persia, as well as of Great Britain and other European powers, took part in the deliberations. The origin and propagation of cholera were fully discussed for the first time in their scientific aspects, and the Conference finally arrived at the following principal conclusions—that India, where it was permanently endemic, was the prime source of Asiatic cholera; that intercourse, between countries, especially maritime intercourse, was the chief means of propagation ; and that great deserts constituted the most effectual barrier to the progress of the disease. The Conference recommended that no efforts should be spared to ex tinguish the disease at its source in India, and that a scientific system of quarantine by land and sea should be established to prevent its progress westwards, especially in the countries most nearly adjoining India, for it2521 was assumed that sparseness of population^ comparative infrequency of in tercourse, and the existence of deserts and other physical obstacles would contribute to make precautions taken in those regions particularly effica cious. Rigorous quarantine against arrivals from an infected locality was to be restricted to a period of 10 days after entering the lazaret, and, in the case of ships fulfilling certain conditions, the days of the voyage up to a maximum of 9 might be reckoned days of quarantine. The question of direct communication between the Persian Gulf and Recommend- India appears to have been overlooked ; and the Conference, treating that ^ 10 ^ Q a sea only as a route by which cholera might pass from Persia into Turkish 'Iraq, was content to prescribe that arrivals in ^Iraq from the Persian Gulf Gulf, should be closely supervised at Fao and Basrah, while suspicious arrivals should be subjected to suitable quarantine. A recommendation was however added that all vessels sailing in the Gulf should be provided with bills of health. The various countries adhering to the Convention proceeded to bring their legislation into harmony with its terms j and the Turkish Regie- ment Quarantenaire of 1867 continues to be, in substance, the law of the Ottoman Empire in sanitary matters at the present day. The fifth epidemic of cliolera in Europe, 1869-74. Not long after the Constantinople Conference Europe was affected by a fresh visitation of cholera, the fifth of the series. The disease entered Europe via Persia and Russia; but whether Persia^ had been infected from India across Afghanistan or from Turkish Iraq, which cholera had recently invaded both from the Mediterranean and from the Persian Grulfj or whether two soparate streams of infection converged in Persia, cannot be determined. This epidemic did not become general in the west; bnt severe outbreaks took place in Europe, among which was one at Munich in 1873. Cholera epidemic in Arabia and Persia, 1871. About the same time the conclusions of the Conference of 1866 as to the virtual impassability of deserts (or tracts which they assumed to be such) by cholera were partially invalidated by the diffusion of the disease in 1871 from Najaf across Arabia to the Red Sea coast, it reached Hail in June, Madinah in September, and Makkah m October of the same year. This Arabian epidemic seems to have started fiom Bushehr in the Persian Gulf, where it appeared m February 1871, and whence, besides spreading to Turkish Iraq, it was carried ^ Kuwait to Bahrain, and to the pearl fleets at sea, Kuwait being apparently the point from which it penetrated to Hail*2522 Cholera Conference at Vienna, 1874, Technical conclusions. Practical recommenda tions. It was now felt that the time had arrived for a reconsideration of the question of cholera epidemics^ and an International Conference charged with this duty assembled at Vienna in 1874. The proceedings of 1866 were made the basis of discussion, and a number of the conclusions formerly accepted were re-affirmed. Among them were the opinion that India was the sole source of cholera and the view that cholera was transmissible by wearing apparel, and in a lesser degree by air, and that it might be conveyed by goods, animals and human corpses ; special stress, however, was now laid on the importance of water as a medium of transmission. At the same time a new departure of a great importance was taken by this Conference in recommending the abandonment of land quaran tine, as being not only prejudicial to commercial interests, but also impracticable and useless ; and the Conference, while agreeing with its predecessor as to the desirability of sea quarantine being maintained out side of Europe, advised that in Europe a system of medical inspection should be substituted. The sixth epidemic of cholera in Europe, 1884-87. For ten years after the Conference of Vienna Europe remained immune from cholera, but in 1884 the south of the Continent was invaded by a sixth and very serious epidemic, which, so far as could be ascertained, had begun in Egypt in 1883 ; the quarter from which it arrived in Egypt has never been determined. In 1884 this epidemic caused 8,000 deaths at Naples and in the following year a mortality of 120,000 in Spain ; it subsequently passed on to South America, and it did not entirely disappear even from the Mediterranean until 1887. The total deaths due to this epidemic were estimated at 250,000 in Europe and 50,000 in America. Cliolera Conference at Rome, 1885. Another International Conference on cholera took place at Borne, in 1885 while the sixth European epidemic was actually in progress; Great Britain and Turkey, but not Persia, were among the powers represented in the proceedings. dusicnis C0U ' v mos ^ res P ec ^ 6 ^e conclusions of this Conference were in advance of those of the Conference of Vienna. It was now clearly recognised2523 that amelioration of local conditions unfavourable to health and the effective isolation of the sick were the principal safeguards against cholera; the inutility of land quarantines was reasserted; and it was distinctly laid down, for the first time, that articles need not be regarded as infected merely because they came from countries where cholera prevailed and that, unless there were evidence of their having been exposed to infection, such articles need not be disinfected. The period of detention to which persons arriving in infected vessels Treatment should be subjected was reduced to 5 days from a previously established g minimum of 7 ; for Mediterranean ports, however, a period of 3 to 6 days J or s lps, detention was recommended in the case of arrivals by ' suspected' vessels, that is by ships free from suspicion of cholera on board but coming from infected or suspected places. The precautions recommended by the Conference consisted, in the case of suspected ships at ordinary ports, in a medical inspection to be made with the object of ascertaining that all was well on board and that measures of disinfection and cleanli ness had been carried out at departure and during the voyage, as required by other findings of the Conference ; and this inspection was to be followed, if the voyage had been of less than 10 days' duration, by 24 hours' detention and by disinfection of dirty linen and articles of personal use. As no special reference was made in the findings to India or to the Persian Gulf, the procedure in both of those regions was probably intended to be regulated by the ordinary rules. Tttfkisli quarantine in the Persian Gulf, 1881-88. In this connection we may observe that since 1881 the Turkish sanitary authorities at Basrah had persistently disregarded clean ^ bills of health in the case of vessels from Bombay and had subjected all ships from India, on the pretext that India was constantly a lieu contamine,' to 24 hours' detention and observation irrespective of the length of the voyage* At one time in 1888 this period of detention was increased to 3 days. Epidemic of cholera in the Persian Gulf, 1889- In 1889 cholera broke out in Turkish 'Iraq for the first time, so far Movements in as can be ascertained, since 1871. It first appeared at the end of July ,™ii or the beginning of August in the Muntafik country; on the 2nd ot August it was at Nasiriyah; on the 6th it had reached Basrah, on the 13th Baghdad and on the 31st Karbala; and it ultimately completed the circuit of the entire province by arriving at Najaf on the 7th ot September. The mortality was considerable, amounting probably to over 1,500 at Baghdad and to more than 400 each at the towns of Nasiriyah and Karbala. At ; Basrah, where the disease lingered until October, and2524 Turkish sanitary measures. Extension to Persia. where deaths in the town and its neighbourhood were said to have reached a total of 3,000, the victims included Mr. Robertson, the British Consul, and his two children; and at Baghdad, also, more than one casualty was sustained by the European community. Before the epidemic had appeared at Basrah the Turkish authorities endeavoured to prevent its importation into Baghdad by prohibiting the river-steamers on the Tigris from touching at intermediate points; and after the outbreak at Basrah they insisted on the journey to Baghdad being broken at Kut-al-Amarah, where the infected steamer from below was met by a clean vessel from above; but these measures, as might have been expected in a country which presents no obstacles to movement by land, proved ineffectual. When cholera, notwithstanding these precau tions and preventive posts at Musaiyib and iMahawil, gained a footing in Baghdad, the Turkish officials still tried to save Karbala, Hillah and Najaf by means of sanitary cordons between those places and the capital; but the result justified the conclusions of the Conferences of Vienna and Rome in regard to land quarantine, and the disease took toll of the western towns as it had done of the others in the province. In August 1889 the epidemic extended from Turkish ; Iraq into Persia ; and in the course of the succeeding two months outbreaks occurred in ^Arabistan (especially at Muhammareh and Shushtar), in Behbehan, and at various places upon the coast of Fars. Some cases occurred at Bushehr before quarantine was established; but suitable measures were taken by the British Residency Surgeon, and there the disease did not spread. Cholera Conference at Venice, 1892. Early in 1892 another International Sanitary Conference assembled at Venice; it was convened, not on account of any prevalence of cholera in Europe at the time, but in consequence of certain proposals which had been advanced by Austria in 1890. The principal objects of the Conference were, in large measure, attained; they were to remodel the Sanitary, Maritime and Quarantine Board of Egypt, to obtain a diminution of the quarantine restrictions imposed on vessels entering the Mediterranean from the Red Sea, and to secure lee, for certain classes of infected or suspected vessels the privilege of passing ^ the Suez Canal a in quarantine.'' By this Conference ships were still ^ classified in three categories as ' infected ' ' suspected ^ and ' healthy ; but the class formerly ' infected 33 had now been subdivided (according to the date of occurrence of cholera on board) into 'infected' and ' suspectedwhile the formerly ' suspected' class had become ' healthy further it was adopted as a principle by this Conference that restrictions on vessels should for the future depend upon actual disease on board ship, rather than upon a constructive contamination according to the health of the port of departure. '^ere tjr2525 The Convention framed by the Venice Conference of 1892 was ratified Ratifications by Great Britain on the 2nd of August 1892 and by Turkey on the 13th ^^ n Cotl ' of February 1893. The Turkish ratification took place subient to the remarkable condition that the Convention should not affect the ordinary Sanitary Regulations of the Ottoman Empire nor any exceptional measures which the Turkish Government^ in accordance with the resolu tions of the Board of Healthy might see fit to adopt in time of epidemic disease. Persia did not participate in the Conference nor did she adhere to the Convention. The seventli epidemic of cholera in Europe^ 1892-95. In the year of the Venice Conference a severe epidemic of cholera broke out in India and was carried by land with remarkable rapidity to Europe, its progress being undoubtedly accelerated by the recently finished Trans-Caspian railway. The stages by which the disease travelled are not without interest. Starting from the fair held at Hardwar in India in March 1892, it reached Kabul on the 19th of April. Herat on the l_st of May, Mashhad on the 26th of May, Baku on the 18th of June, Hamburg on the 16th of August, Grangemouth in Scotland on the 19th August, and New York on the 3lst of August. Outside Russia, where 150,000 persons are known to have perished, and Germany, where a mortality of over 8,500 was registered at Hamburg, its ravages in Europe were not serious, and in America it never gained a footing. Epidemic of cholera in the Persian Gulf, 1893. The year 1893 witnessed a fresh outbreak of cholera in the Persian Turkish Gulf ; it began, apparently, in Turkish 'Iraq, but in that country it was r I' not so severe as the epidemic of 1889. The disease made its appeaiance at Basrah in May and continued there till August, yet the whole number of deaths at Basrah was estimated at 750 only. About the end of August the cholera reached Baghdad, bringing the trade of the city temporarily to a standstill; in October it again disappeared fiom the place. Meanwhile, ho we per, the infection had spread from Basrah down both ^ er9;9n shores of the Persian Gulf. On the Persian side 'Arabistan was attacked in the month of June, and some loss of life occurred at Muhammareh and on the upper Karun : nevertheless, during June and July, quaiantme against Basrah was maintained by the Persian authorities ot the province. Cholera appeared also in various parts of Pars, especially upon the Bushehr-Shiraz road, and the village of Ahmadi m Dashtistan suffered severelv ; but at Bushehr, quarantine having been imposed by sea in June and by land in September and the wells of the town having been secured, there was no mortality.2526 Arabian Bahrain was affected in July and August^ and it is stated that 7,000 eoast, caseg occurred in the islands, but this is believed to be an overestimate ; about the same time the disease was prevalent in Qatif also. At the end of the summer a severe outbreak took place on the coast of Trucial ^Oman, but by November it had spent itself. It is not clear whether this epidemic in 1898 was connected with the Indian and European epidemic of the preceding year. Cholera Conference at Dresden, 1893. Recommen dations. Non-ad herence of the Govern ment of India. At a fresh Conference on the subject of cholera which met at Dresden in 1893 Great Britain and Turkey were as usual represented, but Persia again took no part in the proceedings. The conclusions of the Dresden Conference, which related rather to the control of cholera by land and sea after it should have succeeded in entering Europe, may be regarded as in the main supplementary to those of the Venice Con ference of 1892-; but some of them are of general interest. The Dresden assembly vetoed land quarantines, continned the therefold classification of ships as cc infected cc suspected ' and a healthy ', and laid down the principle that even passengers arriving by u infected ships should not be detained under observation for more than five days after arrival. Certain articles of commerce were declared ^ to be ' susceptible '—that is especially capable of conveying choleraic infec tion—and were consequently made liable to exclusion or disinfection, but not to detention, on arrival at a frontier. The ^ most important innovation, however, was the imposition of an obligation upon Govein- ments to notify to one another the formation of ' foci of cholera within their respective territories. On account principally of this last obligation the Government of India abstained from adhering to the Dresden Convention, but it was ratified by Her Majesty's Government and by the other principal powers of Europe on the 1st of February 1894^ It cannot be doubted that the article relating to notification of 'foci' would have been found difficult of application in India, or that under it the frequent prevalence of cholera in India would have been emphasized in a manner likely to mislead the sanitary authorities of Europe and to affect prejudicial y the commerce of the country. Turkish and Persian Quarantine in the Persian Gulf, 1872- 1894. the^rYo^ 111 ^ While the Conferences of Venice and Dresden were taking place in station. Europe, the Turkish Government were trying to overreach Persia politically^ enforcing upon all vessels navigating the Shatt-al-^Arab recogni tion of a sanitary station which they had established at Fao about il85, i 187^. A subsidiary object of the Turks was probably to secure the quarantine fees which they lost through passengers disembarking at Muhammareh and proceeding thence to Basrah by land. Early in 1892 the Turkish Government openly urged the necessity of a station such as Fao in order to prevent the evasion of sanitary control by passengers for Basrah who might disembark at Muhammareh; but their suggestions, aiming at international recognition of the Fao station, were opposed by the representatives of Great Britain and Russia upon the Constantinople Board of Health and were for the moment dropped. At the beginning of 1894, however, the Board of Health, yielding doubtless to Turkish representations, advised that a quarantine station should be established at Fao for the reception of arrivals from India, also a floating lazaret in the Shatt-al-^Arab above the mouth of the Karun to deal with passengers from Muhammareh to Basrah. The sanitary proceedings of the Persians in connection with the Persia. Gulf epidemic of 1893 have already been noticed above. Cholera Conference at Paris, 1894. iii Early in 1894, at the invitation of the French Government, there assembled in Paris another International Sanitary Conference; on this occasion Persia as well as Turkey and Great Britain was a party. This Conference, which was supplementary to the Conferences of Venice and Dresden, confined its attention to precautions against cholera in connection with the Makkah-Madmah pilgrimage by Muhammadans and to the introduction of a system of sanitary control in the Persian Gulf, a region of which the circumstances had not before received separate consideration. Ships in the Persian Gulf were treated by the Conference under the three heads, now well established, of ' healthy ' (C suspected and ' infected ', and the maximum period of detention for arrivals by an ' infected ' ship was fixed at 5 days after arrival, while it was recom mended that the passengers and crews of ' suspected ' ships such, namely, as had had cases of cholera on board but not within 7 days should be subjected to 5 days' observation reckoned from the time of quitting the port of jdeparture. Various other precautionary measures of a reasonable character were also prescribed in the case of infected and ' suspected 33 ships. It was further resolved that the sanitary management of the entire Persian Gulf should be centred in a large quarantine station near Fao, to be established on terra firm a and completely equipped m every respect. The existing sanitary post at Basrah was to be maintained, but it was to be supplemented by a small lazaret on an island near Basrah for the supervision of passengers who had escaped examination at Fao; and Treatment recommended for ships in the Persian Gulf. Sanitary organisation proposed for the Persian Gulf,2528 Opposition of Great Britain to the latter. Partial aoceptance of the Convention! by Great Britain and Turkey. Peculiar features of the Conference. Ratification of the Con vention by Great Britain and Persia. new sanitary posts were to be created at Muhammareli, Bushehr, Bandar ^Abbas and Gwadar on the Persian, and at Kuwait, Bahrain and Masqat on the Arabian side. This scheme was opposed by the British delegates on the grounds that its necessity had not been justified ; that the numerous stations created would be subject to at least four different governments ; that the governments of Turkey and Persia would be unable, owing to distance, to exercise effective control over the posts for which they were res ponsible ; that the expense would be great and would fall almost exclusively on British shipping ; and finally that trouble and delay, as well as expense, would be entailed on British vessels. Special exception was taken by the British Government to the detention of ships at Fao or Muhammareh, at neither of which places was it possible for the Basrah cargoes constituting the bulk of the trade to be discharged or shipped,—operations, that it had hitherto been permissible to carry out in quarantine at Basrah itself. The objections of the British delegates however having been overruled, a Convention in the sense explained above was adopted by the Conference and was signed by the representative of the British Govern ment on the 3rd of April 1894, subject to a declaration that Britain did not accept such of the provisions as related to the Persian Gulf, At the sixth sitting of the Conference the Turkish delegates had, under instructions from the Porte, unexpectedly announced that a 5 days^ quarantine of observation would, no with standing the recommendations of the Conference, be imposed on all Indian vessels with effect from the date of their arrival at a Turkish port in the Persian Gulf; and the signature of the Convention on behalf of Turkey was accompanied by a declaration that the Porte accepted only those articles which were in harmony with the sanitary regulations of the Ottoman Empire. It is difficult to understand precisely in what manner or by whom the Conference intended that the Persian Gulf scheme should be carried out, but its execution appears to have been left to the government of Turkey in consultation with that of 'ersia. and from Annexure IV of the Convention it may be gathered, though the point is not absolutely clear, that it was also the intention of the Conference to entrust the management of all the sanitary stations in the Persian Gulf to a committee of the Board of Health at Constantinople. In the light of later events it is interesting to observe that, in the course of the discussions, the Austro-Hungarian delegates proposed that an Interna tional Board of Health should be created at Tehran ; while the American representatives suggested that an international quarantine station should be brought into existence at the mouth of the Gulf near Ras Musandam ! neither of these proposals, however, was accepted by the Conference. The Convention was ratified by Great Britain and Persia on the 20th of June 1898, by Great Britain with the reservation mentioned above relating to the Persian Gulf ; its duration was fixed at 5 years in the first instance, but it was to be considered as tacitly renewed at the end of that time, and at the expiration of each succeeding period of 5 years169 r*-.- * •» —■ ■: v mm mikfl obJ ^ at^ 2829 except by such powers as might give notice of withdrawal six months before the end of a quinquennium. No separate acceptance of the Convention by India appears to have been deemed necessary on this occasion as it was^ apparently, after the Dresden Conference of 1893 ; and a strong protest was made by the Government of India against the action of Her Majesty^s Government, who in this instance committed them, without previous consultation, to a Convention some articles of which they disapproved. The Government of India also considered it their duty to warn Her Majesty's Government of the probability that any sanitary authority which might be delegated to the Turks in the Persian Gulf or on the Shatt-al-'Arab would be abused for political ends, and especially for the purpose of promoting the unwarrantable claims of Turkey to sovereignty over Bahrain and Muhammareh ; and they also laid stress on the undesirability of the Turks being allowed to interfere in the affairs of Arab principalities subject to British influence. Turkey herself did not ratify the Convention of 1894 . As might have been expected from the jealousy prevailing between the Turkish and Persian Governments, from the non-acceptance by Great Britain of the Persian Gulf articles of the Convention and from the sweeping reservations made by the Turkish Government at the time of signature, the scheme of the Conference, in so far as it concerned the Persian Gulf, remained entirely inoperative. The reduced precautions recommended by the Conference were not adopted by the Turks ; and at Basrah, which continued to be the sole sanitary station in the Gulf, qua rantine was regulated as before by political prepossessions rather than by scientific principles. The power to obstruct foreign interests that could not be excluded was too valuable in the eyes of the Ottoman Government to be lightly surrendered. Cholera in the Persian Gulf, 1894-1907. We may here conclude the subject of cholera with a short notice of the movements of that disease in the Gulf since 1894. In 1899 the Sultanate of 'Oman suffered from a severe epidemic of cholera, the disease having been imported from Karachi by way of Grwadar ; over 700 deaths from cholera took place in the towns of Masqat and Matrah alone, and the mortality in the interior of the country is believed to have been very serious, certainly exceeding 12,000. In October the disease manifested itself in epidemic form on the Shatt-al- 'Arab in Turkish ''Iraq and spread northwards as far as the town of 'Amarah. The filthy camps of the date packers in the Basrah neighbour- liood usually fall an easy prey to cholera ; and it has been noticed that at Basrah the disease is generally most rife during the date season, while these camps are in existence. In 1902 cholera again appeared at Gwadar, where over 500 deaths from the disease occurred between the beginning of July and the end of Objections of the Govern ment of India and non-ratific ation by Turkey.

General epidemic of 1904. 2530 October; and in December it occasioned about 30 deaths at Jashk. In the course of the year it also reached Minab, where it did not die out until January 1903 and where it unexpectedly revived for a time in the month of September. Early in 1904 cholera prevailed at Basrah, and from Basrah it made its way to Baghdad, where it assumed a serious form and caused trade to cease for about three months. Prom Turkish 'Iraq the disease seems to have spread into Persia by two lines meeting at Isfahan ; the first was by Kirmanshah, the other was by sea to the coast of Tangistan and thence by the Bushehr-Shiraz road. At Shiraz over 7,000 persons are said to have died, but the town of Bushehr escaped. It is probable that the infection also reached the centre of Persia vid ^Arabistan and the Bakhtiyari road ; for at Muhammareh, where over 200 deaths occurred, cholera was already prevalent in May, and between July and October its ravages at Ahwaz, Shushtar and Dizful were considerable. The Bahrain Islands were attacked in May, and by September over 1,200 deaths were said to have resulted ; many of the inhabitants fled to other parts of the Gulf. In July the disease arrived in Trucial 'Oman, where, at the time of its cessation in September, 8,000 fatal cases were believed to have occurred. It also visited the 'Oman Sultanate, spreading from one large place to another and causing great havoc in the interior. In Wadi Samailj Wadi Fara' (or Rustaq) and the ports of Batinah the deaths were estimated at 14,000 ; but at Masqat there were only 43, and at Matrah only 12 deaths,—a happy result which may perhaps be attributed to the sanitary measures enforced in those towns under the advice of the British Agency Surgeon. loir' j-was The early history of plague. I We turn now to the subject of bubonic plague,—a disease of whicli it may be said that, as a matter of intercontinental importance, it is more ancient as well as more modern than cholera ; for, while cholera is m Europe of recent introduction, and even in Asia cannot be traced back with certainty to an epoch more remote than the second decade of the 19th century, plague on the other hand comes down from a high antiquity and was in the middle ages so prevalent in Europe that the western continent may even be considered to have been at that time its principal seat. In Libya plague seems to have existed as early as the 3rd century B. C.^ and Europe suffered in the 6th century A. D. from a visitation of what must almost certainly have been bubonic plague. In the 14th century A. D., under the name of the Black Death, plague ravaged the countries of Europe after a fashion almost unparallelled in the history of epidemics, and destroyed (it has been estimated) not less than one-fourth of the entire population. The Black Death was believed to have been imported into Europe from the East, through Genoa; but, if this were the case, it soon became acclimatised in a remarkable degree, and it remained during the 15th, 16th and ]7th century a very common and ^taki2531 destructive scourge in western lands. The Great Plague of London in 1664- 65 was one of the last severe manifestations of the disease in the more civi lised countries of the west; in the 18th century plague gradually retreated towards the shores of the Mediterranean ; and at the beginning of the 19th century central and north-western Europe had become almost exempt from its ravages. Bubonic plague in the Persian Gulf, 1773-1877. But while plague relaxed its hold on Europe it continued to recur at intervals in the Persian Gulf^ or at least in Turkish ■'Iraq ; there, too, it was in all probability a disease of ancient standing, but its ravages did not attract much notice until after its decline in the Occident, Early in April 177.S plague manifested itself at Basrah, and, according to information received by the members of the British factory, the mortality there from the disease soon rose to 1,000 deaths a day. Of the representatives of the East India Company some shut themselves up in the factory in the town, while others betook themselves to ' Belvoir 3 \ a place about 4 miles off, in the hope that the violence of the disease would abate with the approach of the hot weather; but on the contrary it continued to increase, and on the 22nd of April the Agent in Council resolved to retire temporarily with his staff to Bombay. The party left Basrah the next day in the Company^s ships ' Drake ' and ' Tiger/-' of which the a Tiger ^ with her passengers—as elsewhere related—was captured at sea by the Persians; but the a Drake reached Bombay in safety on the 14th of May and was sent to perform quarantine at Butchers Island, where the four gentlemen who had arrived in her were detained until the 17th of June. On the 28th of October the staff of the factory again left Bombay for Basrah ; and when, after a long voyage, they arrived on the 5th of January 1774 at their destina tion, they learned that the plague had ceased after causing in the town and neighbourhood a loss of life estimated at 200,000.* They themselves found the inhabitants ' almost all dead, those few that are remaining dispirited/'' Again in April 1802 plague broke out at Baghdad and assumed alarming proportions ; the Pasha fled at the first appearance of the disease without taking any measures to prevent its diffusion. In 1831, plague having made its appearance in a severe form at Baghdad, the British 'Resident there (Major Taylor) considered it advisable to remove with his staff to Basrah ; but in January 1832 the malady attacked Basrah with such violence that he thought it better to return to Baghdad. In this epidemic, which did not altogether cease until 1834, the city of Baghdad is said to have been to a large extent depopulated,—a circumstance which renders more intelligible the phenomenal increase of its inhabitants during the last half century.

For more than 30 years after the great Baghdad epidemic the countries surrounding the Persian Gulf seem to have remained free of bubonic plague, but in May 1867 the disease was again detected, under the name of Waba in certain palustrine villages near the Shatt-al-Hindlyah in Turkish 'Iraq : this proved to be the commencement of a prolonged but not continuous epidemic which affected a large part of Turkish 'Iraq and atone time extended its ravages to Persian 'Arabistan. The outbreak was investigated on the spot by a Turkish sanitary commission presided over by Dr. Colvill, the physician of the British Eesidency at Baghdad, and the malady was declared to be plague ; but its occurrence at this time was fitful and sporadic, and the total ascertained mortality did not exceed 300. In order to protect Baghdad city, quarantine was established at the Kharr crossing and at Qararah on the Tigris, but almost at the same moment cases ceased to occur. In the spring of 1874, however, the disease, which had meanwhile been dormant or had at least escaped observation, reappeared on the Dagharah and at' Afaj, at Diwamyah town (where it occasioned 400 deaths), at Shina- fiyah and at Umm Nijris; during the summer following it was again quies cent, but in autumn it broke out afresh at Umm Nijris. In January 1875 it was reported on the Shatt-al Gharaf, and in March it was present at Fuwwar. The outbreak was still confined to a triangular block of country, mostly marshy, of which the corners were at Kut-al-Amarah, Suq-ash-Shuyukh and Shinafiyah, and in the rural districts it was restricted to permanent villages situated on low waterlogged ground. Within the limits described, however, it made serious havoc; and 13 per cent, of the population were estimated to have succumbed in two years, the heaviest mortality occurring at Suq-ash-Shuyukh, Qal'at Sikar and Hai town, where the deaths from plague amounted to 200, 450 and 500 respectively. In November 1875 plague began again in the neigh bourhood of Hillah town and, emerging at last from the region of the marshes, attacked not only Hillah, Najaf and Karbala but eventually Baghdad and Kadhimain as well; and this time the deaths attribu table to plague amounted in Baghdad alone to at least 3,800. In March 1876 the disease was carried by pilgrims, returning from Karbala, to the village of Jallakan on the Karun river, where more than a fourth of the population perished ; and it quickly spread to the towns of Shushtar and Dizful, About 2,500 deaths in all are believed to have occurred in Persian ^Arabistan, of which about 1,800 were at Shushtar. By the end of July 1876 plague was extinct for the season both in Turkish 'Iraq and Persian 'Arabistan; but in April 1877 the former province experienced a fresh visitation in which Samarrah, Baghdad and 'Aziziyah on the Tigris and Hillah on the Euphrates were involved. At Baghdad, as proved by accurate statistics obtained from the Chief Rabbi, 1,180 Jews out of about 18,000 died in the epidemic and the total plague mortality in the town was calculated at about 4,500. With the advent of the hot weather the disease, as usual, again disappeared. Preventive measures on any considerable scale do not appear to have been introduced by the Turks in Mesopotamia until 1876. When instituted they consisted chiefly in the isolation and disinfection of houses where cases had occurred and in attempts to stop communication between infected2533 localities and the rest of the country. Recourse was had to sanitary cordons^ the removal of bridges and similar precautions^ but the measures adopted proved equally futile and oppressive. House quarantine in particular gave rise to gross abuses, as poor families were shut in to be destroyed by the disease, while the rich were able to purchase exemption and carried infection with them in their movements. In July 1876, after plague had spread to Persian'Arabistan, the Turkish authorities reduced the period of their internal quarantines, which had hitherto been longer, to five da}^ ; but at the same time they very unreasonably imposted a severe quarantine of fifteen days by land and sea against the whole Persian kingdom, of which a small portion had been infected from their own territory. A small sanitary post which the Turks appear to have established at Fao in 1872 first came to notice at this time. In 1877 the people of Baghdad, spontaneously abandoned the city for the open country, and at the end of April about two-thirds of the entire population were encamped outside the walls, The movement was attended by immediate good results, and a sanitary cordon was withdrawn which had been established upon the Diyalah river to prevent the disease from spreading southwards. As a rule, in Turkish ''Iraq, the preventive measures were unintelligently and inconsiderately worked, and symptoms were even perceptible of their being regarded and treated as a profitable source of revenue. The quaran tine fees paid by the British river steamer ' Blosse Lynch ' amounted on the average to Es. 871 for the journey between Baghdad and Basrah. The attitude of the Persian Government, by whom the epidemic was Persian ignored until the spring of 1876, was different. In March the Governor- saD ^ ni, J General of Fars directed that vessels from Turkish ''Iraq should be care- fully inspected at Bushehr and that the advice of the British Political Resident should be followed in regard to the precautions necessary; these instructions were in accordance with an established custom by which, from 1864 if not from an earlier period, the sanitary control of the port of Bushehr had been practically vested in the British Political Resident. In April the Persian Government added a request for the assist ance of all the British agents and vessels in the Gulf in maintaining quar antine by gea. In May the Persian Government established a quarantine station on 'Abbadan island, opposite to Muhammareh town and were anxious that all ships leaving the Shatt-aVArab for Persia should be detained there for fifteen days; but this arrangement does not appear to have been rigidly carried into effect. In June a Persian Sanitary Commission was created at Tehran, which assumed charge of affairs and immediately imposed a fifteen days' quarantine by sea and land against arrivals from Turkey; and a steamer was sent by the Government of India to assist in the enforcement of quarantine at Bushehr, where Dr. Wall, the British Residency Surgeon, controlled operations. With the temporary subsidence of the epidemic all restrictions were removed m the autumn of 1876, but they were reimposed in 1877, in which year preventive posts were established in Persia at Qasr-i-Shirin and Muhammareh and between 'Amarah and Shushtar,2534 Sanitary measures of the Govern ment of India, 1876. Action was taken by the Government of India also in connection witla this epidemic of plague^ bnt it was not spontaneous. In 1876 they imposed at Karachi^ Bombay^ and Aden a strict quarantine of 15 days (reckoned from the time of leaving the last infected port or from the last case of plague on board) against arrivals from the Persian Gulf; but mail steamers were exempted unless plague had actually occurred on board. The object of the measure was simply to avoid the application to Indian vessels at Suez^ of a 15 days^ quarantine which would otherwise have been enforced by the Egyptian Government. A suggestion by Dr. Colvill^ the British Residency Surgeon at Baghdad^ that vessels bound for India should be detained in quarantine at the mouth of the Persian G ul£ was negatived by the Government of India ; but, in view of recent interna tional projects in a converse sense, the fact that it should have been made is interesting. Proposed Vienna Plague Conference, 1877. In 1877 an International Commission of Inquiry, in the form of a Medical Commission to visit the spot, was proposed by Austria for the purpose of studying bubonic plague in Turkish 3 Iraq. The preliminary meeting of the Commission should have taken place at Vienna on the 20th of April 1877, and the British Government were about to appoint Dr. Colvill their representative, but difficulties connected with the personnel of the Commission arose, and the Conference was postponed sine die by the Austro-Hungarian Government, Plague in the Persian GuH 1877-1894. JEpidemic in Turkish 'Iraq, 1881. Epidemic in Turkish 'Iraq, 1892. In 1881 plague revisited Turkish •'Iraq and was sufficiently severe to carry off, it is said, half of the inhabitants of the town of Najaf. Again in 1892^ the disease made its appearance in Turkish ''Iraq, be ginning apparently at Nasiriyah on the Euphrates, and spreading thence to Basrah and from Basrah to Baghdad. Four hundred deaths from plague are said to have occurred at Basrah on the worst day of this epidemic. Great epidemic outbreak of plague, 1894-1907. The year 1894 marked the beginning of a new era in the sanitary history of Asia. In May 1894 bubonic plague appeared in a virulent form at Hong Kong, imported probably from Yunnan in China, where according to some accounts it is endemic. In 1896 the disease declared %ial2535 itself at Bombay^ its existence there being officially notified for the first time on the 2nd of August; and soon after it began to spread over the whole of India with calamitous results which have become a matter of common knowledge and still continue. Since 1896 this epidemic of plague has extended to various countries and to other continents besides Asia; but^ except in India, it has not obtained a firm hold nor have its ravages been serious. The earliest cases in Europe were detected at Oporto in 1899 : it is not known by what route the disease reached that place. Plague Conference at Venice, 1897. The first event of importance which followed the outbreak of plague in India was the meeting at Venice in 1897 of an International Sanitary Conference to deal with the problems created by the unfamiliar disease. The resolutions passed by the Conference,—though only partially accepted and still less completely carried out by the powers concerned, —are important and demand examination; for they inaugurated new methods of preventive procedure and conferred the imprimatur of science upon an administrative scheme for the Persian Gulf which was, and still remains, diplomatically impossible. But first it is necessary to understand the constitution and status of The Constati the Board of Health at Constantinople,— a body which has already been mentioned and which will hereafter claim frequent notice, both as an Health? instrument of Turkish sanitary policy and as a mandatory of European opinion. The Constantinople Board of Health, more correctly known as the Conseil Superieur de Sante, was created in 1840 by the Ottoman Sultan of the day to facilitate measures for combating plague. Without restrictions on personal liberty and the imposition of special dues nothing could be effected; and without the concurrence of the leading Christian powers, whose subjects enjoyed rights of extraterritoriality in Turkey, the executive and financial ordinances of the Ottoman Government would have remained a dead letter in respect of foreigners. For the purpose, then, of associating the principal European Governments in the scheme and of securing their support, the Board of Health was called into exist ence by an Imperial Irade; it consisted (and still consists) of a Turkish President (the Minister, namely, for Foreign Affairs), of eight ordinary Turkish members, and of one delegate each of the 13 nationalities which are diplomatically represented at the Porte. The Board deals with all questions relating to the protection of the Turkish Empire against the introduction of disease from other countries. The decisions of the Board depend on a majority of votes of the members ; they are not operative, except in an emergency, until confirmed by the Turkish Government, The funds at the disposal of the Board are derived from dues levied according to tonnage on all vessels entering Turkish ports; from taxes on pilgrims, and on the corpses of Shi'ahs brought into Turkish 'Iraq for burial; and from quarantine and other sanitary fees. The position of the Board'in relation to the Turkish Government is undefined and has&gt;5 2536 The Mixed Commission for Revision of the Turkish Sani tary Tariff, General resolutions of the Conference. frequently been disputed, and contests between the Board and the Turkish Department of Public Health have been not infrequent. The Board, from the circumstances of its creation, is indisputably an Ottoman insti tution, but at the same time it possesses, as an advisory body, a quasi- international authority. The British Government have always resisted undue extensions of the power of the Board because of its irrespon sible character and the preponderance in its councils of the representatives of non-maritime nations ; and they have also at times had to insist on the responsibility of the Turkish Government for the sanitary policy of the Ottoman Empire and to protest against attempts by the Porte to shelter itself behind resolutions of the Board. There is also another international body at Constantinople, called the Mixed Commission for Revision of the Turkish Sanitary Tariff, which stands in close relations to the Board of Health and consists partly of the same members ; it apparently exercises a general control over the income and expenditure of the Board. The Conference which met at Venice in 1897 was the first, since that of 1851, to deal with the subject of plague j its functions were to devise measures for preventing the introduction and spread of the disease, and to arrange for systems of sanitary supervision with this object in the lied Sea and the Persian Gulf. Great Britain, Turkey and Persia were among the powers represented by delegates. The Conference took the conclusions of its predecessors of 1892, 1893 and 1894 as a basis, but, in view of the longer incubation period of plague as compared with cholera and of modifications which had recently taken place in scientific opinion, the regulations adopted by the Conference of 1897 necessarily differed in some respects from those enacted by the earlier Conferences. The Convention framed by this Conference was signed on the 19th of March 1897; among its leading provisions was one by which the Govern ments of the countries adhering to the Convention were bound to notify to each other by telegram the occurrence of j^lague within their territories. Another important result was that land quarantine was pro hibited for plague, as it had been in 1893 for cholera, power being however reserved to non-European countries, should they find it difficult to protect their frontiers, to close them absolutely to passengers and merchandise. The list of articles declared capable of transmitting infection was more comprehensive than that which had been adopted in the case of cholera. For the regulation of the Persian Gulf traffic vessels were divided as before into the three categories of ' infected/'' ' suspected ' and ' healthy an ' infected ^ ship was defined as one with plague on board, or on which plague had occurred within 12 days before arrival; a ' suspected ' ship as one on which plague had been present, but not within 1*2 days ; a 'healthy' ship as one on which, though coming from an infected port, plague had not manifested itself. Precautions to be observed in the case of ' infected' and ' suspected }) ships were laid down by the Convention, and it was directed that ' healthy' ships should receive free pratique immediately on arrival, whatever the nature of the bill of health, provided that they must in all cases have completed a period of 10 full days after the date of departure from the last infected port.y4 o? 2537 These were for the most part changes of detail rather than of prin ciple. But the proposals of the Conference in regard to the executive ^ apparatus required in the Persian Gulf were of a novel and revolutionary I a type, not foreshadowed in any earlier Conference unless by the sugges- tji tion of the American delegates at Paris in 1894. A sanitary station was to be created at the entrance of the Gulf on the island of Hormuz or on Qishm, or at some place in that vicinity, and was to be provided with a small hospital, disinfecting appliances,, and at least two doctors besides sanitary inspectors and guards, while, in the neighbourhood of Basrah, a station equipped with a large lazaret and disinfecting plant was to be brought into existence under a medical staff consisting of several doctors. All vessels visiting the Gulf were to call first at the outpost near the entrance of the Gulf and were there to be treated according to the rules ; but, on condition of taking a sanitary inspector and two guards on board, they might continue their voyage in quarantine up the Gulf to be dealt with finally at Basrah. Ships carrying passengers or goods for Persian ports might, after suitable sanitary arrangements had been instituted at Bushehr, disembark them at that place; but in the absence of such arrangements they should have no option, and must land them either at the Hormuz station or at Basrah. The sanitary posts at Hormuz and Basrah were to be subject to the control of the Board of Health at Constantinople, and the political arrangements regarding the Hormuz station were to be settled by an agreement between the Turkish and Persian Governments; in the meantime, however, a temporary post was to be established by the Constantinople Board of Health upon one of the islands at the entrance of the Gulf. These remarkable proposals appear to have been of French origin. Their effect was somewhat modified by a declaration which the British delegates made at the Conference, that it must be understood that the measures in the Persian Gulf should be applicable to arrivals from Indian ports only so long as those ports were infected with plague. The Convention of 1897 was ratified by Great Britian on the 30th of December 1898 and by Persia on the 31st of October 1899 ; the British ratification, apart from the declaration made during the sitting of the Conference, was unconditional. The Persians were anxious that the sanitary station at the mouth of the Gulf should be located on the Persian mainland, and soon after the dissolution of the Conference the Persian delegate on the Board of Health at Constantinople urged the suitability of Jashk (which however he described as an island !) for that purpose ; but the point was not pressed, and the Persian ratification was accompanied merely by a declaration that it ' remained understood^ that the flag flown and the armed guards employed at the Hormuz station should be Persian. The attitude of the Turkish Government was characteristic. They professed a desire to ratify the Convention, but only subject to a prepos terous declaration which substituted Kuwait for Hormuz in the Persian Gulf scheme, postulated the subjection of the entire sanitary system of the Gulf to the Constantinople Board of Health and enhanced the period of observation for plague from 10 to 12 days, power being further reserved to the Ottoman Government to extend it ad libitum in their own ports. Sckeme of the Confer ence for the Persian Gulf. Ratification of the Con vention by Great Britain and Persia. Non-ratifica- tion by Turkey.2538 Failure of the scheme for the Persian Gulf. These conditions were not such as the other powers could accept^ and the Convention therefore remained unratified by Turkey. Before the final refusal of the Turkish Government to ratify^ the Persian Government appeared to entertain an idea of forestalling the Board of Health by constructing a Persian sanitary station on the island of Hormuz^ and they even went so far as to enquire whether a guard-ship for the use of the station^ to fly the Persian flag^ could be lent them by the Government of India ; on becoming aware^ however, of the failure of the Turkish Government to adhere to the Convention they allowed the project to drop. The scheme of the Venice Conference of 1897 for the Persian Gulf was in conformity with the pet theories of certain French scientists^ who wished to stretch a ' net' for sea-borne cholera and plague between the continents of Asia and Europe and to deal with the Persian Gulf on a false analogy with the Eed Sea, making Hormuz a kind of second Kamaran. The conclusion should therefore be avoided that the proposals of the Conference, though politically disadvantageous to Great Britain and Persia and very favourable to Turkey, had a political origin. The Constantinople Board of Health however, as we shall presently see, immediately seized the opportunity to extend the sphere of their activity in the Gulf ; but in face of the apathy of the powers chiefly concerned, except Turkey, the Board were unable to achieve anything and the project of the Conference for the Gulf was not realised. Plague in the Persian Gulf, 1899-1907. Masqat and Bushehr, 1899. Matrah, Masqat and Qislim, 1900. For more than two years after its appearence in India there was no manifestation of plague in the Persian Gulf 3 and, though since 1899 the disease has shown itself at intervals in various ports of the Gulf, its movements there have been fitful and unprogressive, giving ground for the hope that it has not acquired a permanent foothold. Two imported cases of plague which were observed at Masqat in April 1899 were followed by no others ; and the arrival at Basrah in April 1899 of the Indian steamer 'Patna' from Bombay with one case of plague on board, and in the following month of the Indian steamer ' Haidari' with a suspected case of plague, produced no untoward results on shore. In June, however, the disease was discovered at Bushehr, where it possibly continued until July; but by August it had certainly become extinct without any considerable mortality having occurred. The actual number of cases at Bushehr was impossible to ascertain as the disease was care fully concealed, but two deaths from plague were fully authenticated- In January 1 900 plague appeared at Matrah near Masqat on a small scale, and its progress was at first very slow ; in March it began to assume more serious proportions and spread to the neighbouring town of Masqat ; finally in the month of May it disappeared after a total mortality had been reached which was officially estimated at 434 souls.In May, the month in which it died out at Masqat, plague was found to exist on the island of Qishm; but still none was present in Turkish 'Iraq, though a second steamer on which plague had occurred during the voyage from India had arrived at Basrah in February, and a third, the ' King Arthur/' in May 1900. In April and May of 1901, however, a few cases of plague, ten of which were fatal, occurred at Basrah ; and in May 1901 and January 1902 small outbreaks took place at Baghdad. In March 1903 two steamers arrived at Basrah on which deaths from plague had recently occurred, but the port remained unaffected; in April lind May, however, an outbreak at Masa^idah in the Zubair Qadha, not far from ''Amarah on the Tigris, was accountable for the deaths of some 40 persons. In April 1903 a mild epidemic of plague was said to have occurred in the Turkish Sanjaq of Hasa; and in May and June a smart outbreak took place in the Bahrain islands, off the Hasa coast, which is supposed to have claimed some 300 victims out of about twice that number of persons attacked. In May and June 1904 plague was present at Lingeh on the Persian coast, 146 cases being reported, and was carried from there into Lar; but the resulting mortality in that district is unknown. The disease suddenly disappeared on the arrival of an epidemic of cholera in the same neighbourhood. The only other outbreak of plague in the Gulf remaining to be recorded is one in Bahrain, which continued from the beginning of May to the end of June 1905. This epidemic was practically confined to the towns of Manamah and Muharraq, in each of which about 400 cases —half of them fatal—occurred j but there were also a few cases on board the fleets then engaged in pearling operations upon the banks of the Arabian side. Plague and Cholera Conference at Paris, 1903. Meanwhile the problem of preventing the ingress of Asiatic epidemic diseases had been discussed once more in Europe. The scope of the Paris Conference of 1903 was more ample than that of its predecessors, and its work included not only the revision and completion of the Conventions already in force ' but also a the definition, under one single agreement, of the measures necessary for safeguarding the public health against the invasion and propagation of both plague and cholera/' At this Conference all the principal countries of the civilised world were represented, among them Great Britain, Turkey, and Persia ; and Egypt for the first time took an independent part in the proceedings. The points considered by the Conference were partly of a technical and partly of an administrative order, and a number of them which had no bearing on the Persian Gulf fall beyond our scope. On the technical side a notable relaxation was made in the defini tion of vessels a infected' with and 'suspected' of plague, none Turkish 'Iraq, Hasa and Bahrain, 1903. Lingeh and Lar, 1904.

The obligation of the signatories to notify at once to other Governments the first appearance of certified cases of plague within their territories was maintained^ and cholera was now included in this provision ; but it was specially provided that the occurrence or not involve the treatment of The Conference recognised that capable of transmitting either only become dangerous through a first case of either disease should the country concerned as infected, no kind of merchandise is in itself plague or cholera, and that articles can contamination with the pTo ducts of plague or cholera ; the result of this conclusion was a marked reduction in the number of articles rendered liable to exclusion or disinfection in time of epidemic. It was also laid down that an epidemic should be considered to end five days after the isolation, death, or cure of the last case. These changes were mitigations of the existing rules ; but the instrumentality of the rat as a disseminator of plague having by this time been fulh/ established, the Conference found it necessary to insist upon the destruction (in certain circumstances) of rats on shipboard : the measures of rat destruction prescribed by the Conference were however less stringent than those which had already been adopted by certain countries on their own initiative. The system of surveillance permissible in other regions was still not extended to the Persian Gulf, where detention for purposes of observation continued to be the rule. The administrative scheme devised for the Persian Gulf by the Conference of 1903 resembled that of the Conference of 1897, but was not precisely similar. It was decided, as before, that a large sanitary station should be established near Basrah and a smaller one at the entrance of the Gulf, but the island of Hormuz was now definitely selected as the location of the latter, and apparatus should be provided there for rat destruction. Pending the installation of this permanent station a sanitary post should be opened on Hormuz. The provisions for the continuance of the voyage up the Gulf from Hormuz to Basrah in quarantine were maintained ; but the landing en route at Bushehr of passengers and cargo was now unconditionally sanctioned. All healthy ships should receive free pratique at Gulf Ports after five days' absence from the last infected port, and none were to receive it earlier at any place. Important recommendations moreover were made affecting the consti tution of the Constantinople Board of Health, which was destined by the Conference to be charged with the management of the Hormuz sanitary station, whether temporary or permanent, and with the financial respon sibility for the same. The number of Turkish members should be reduced to four, and every foreign country entitled to representation should have one delegate on the Board. The funds for the outlay to be imposed upon the Board in connection with the Hormuz post were to be allotted by the Mixed Commission for Revision of the Turkish Sanitary Tariff from the reserves at the disposal of the Board. The Convention embodying these and the other conclusions of the Conference was signed at Paris on the 3rd of December 1903, and the conditions of renewal were the same as those attached to the Veniceof India had not The reservations the consent of the Mixed Corn- Convention of 1897, The representatives of Great Britain signed Persia and subject to certain reservations^ and the representative of Persia ad abstention of referendum ; but the representatives of Turkey, who desired to qualify an tneir signature by reservations which virtually annulled the whole Convention, were not permitted to sign ; and the representative of India abstained from signing as the Government yet decided to adhere to the Convention, of Great Britain were as follows:—(1) that His Majesty^s Government to the assembling of mission for the Eevision of the Turkish Sanitary Tariff—one object of which would be to authorise the advance of funds for the Hormuz station—was conditional on a prominent position being given by the Commission in its programme to the reduction of the sanitary dues at Turkish ports ; (2) that the decisions of the Commission in voting funds for the Hormuz scheme must be unanimous; and (3) that no steps should be taken for the construction of the H ormuz station until the Constan tinople Board of Health had been reorganised in the manner agreed upon by the 1 Conference. The further views of His Majesty^s Government having first been stated, viz., that it had been proved by recent experi ence that no sanitary station at Hormuz was necessary for the sanitary defence of the Gulf and that in view of the collapse of the ^Oqair station it was doubtful whether climatic conditions would admit of the mainten ance of a post at Hormuz, the Conference allowed the British reserva tions to be registered. The Convention has not yet (1906) been ratified by Great Britain, for Non-ratifica- reasons which will appear below. Convention^ 16 by Great Britain. The Mixed Commission, already once referred to in connection with the Constantinople Board of Health, was convened early in 1905 for the fifth time in its history, and in 1906 its sittings still continued j the principal objects which it had in view were to obtain payment of a debt due by the Turkish Government to the Board of Health, to regulate the pay and pensions of the employes of the Board, to provide funds for the repair of Turkish lazarets, and to obtain—if possible a reduction of the sanitary dues payable at Turkish ports. The proceedings showed that the Board of Health had accumulated a reserve of more than £T 268,000 and that the Ottoman Government were in debt to the Board to the extent of £T150,000,—an obligation regarding the discharge of which, however, there were serious difficulties. In view of this superfluity of funds the Biitish representative on the Commission, Dr.Clemow, pressed for a reduction of the Turkish Sanitary Tariff by 25 per cent., and on his motion a number of useless or nearly useless sanitary posts were suppressed; none of these, however, were in the Persian Gulf. A sum of £T 20,000 was also allotted for the improvement of the existing sanitary establishment at Basrah, a measure to which the British delegates at the Paris Conference had drawn attention as being of greater utility than the establishment of a new post at the entrance of the Gulf. No grant at all was made for the proposed station at Hormuz, and a motion by the Kussian delegate that m Peman Gulf scheme frus trated by the M ixed Com mission, 1905-06. i2542 Obstacles to execution of the scheme. funds should be provided for a post a at the entrance of the Gulf was not accepted by the Commission. The obstacles in the way of the Hormuz project were in fact insuper- able^ for the Turkish Government refused to assent to the reorganisation of the Board of Healthy which was a condition of the adherence of Great Britain to the Convention; and deadlock also prevailed between the Governments of Turkey and Persia, each of which claimed that their flag should fly over the sanitary station of Hormuz. Mission of M, Paivre, 1905. The French Government, however, who were extremely desirous that the resolutions of the Paris Conference of 1903 should be carried out in their entirety, did not drop the matter. In Europe they continu ed to urge the powers that had made reservations to withdraw them ; aod in the meanwhile, at the beginning of 1905, they sent M. Faivre, Inspecteur Adjoint des Services Sanitaires under the French Ministry of the Interior, to the Persian Gulf to study the sanitary problem on the spot. It is most likely that the motives of the French in supporting the Hormuz scheme were other than political, for the plan was in accord ance with the French ' net' theory of protection, and the object of M. Faivre's mission was probably to discover a means of inducing the British Government to withdraw its objections, but M. Faivre relied for his information chiefly upon the Russian Consul-General and the French doctor (M. Bussiere) at Bushehr, and in the end he reported in favour of establishing the station upon the island of Hanjam instead of upon Hormuz. Such a course may well have been recommended by both the advisers of M. Faivre in the hope that such a station might act as a political counterpoise to the British telegraph station on Hanjam. Inasmuch, however, as the new proposal involves a modification of the text of the Paris Convention, it seems only to have complicated and intensified the difficulties by which the execution of the recom mendations of the Conference of 1903 was already attended. kaja Mission of Br. T. Thomson, 1906. In 1905, subsequently to the tour of M. Faivre, His Majesty's Gov ernment decided that a British expert should visit the Gulf region to report on its sanitary requirements in relation not only to Persia but also to Europe, on the necessity for a sanitary station at the entrance of the Gulf, and on the suitability for such a station at ll ormuz^ we we2543 feeal iktfc Hanjam and other sites: the principal object of the mission was to acquire data independent of those obtained by M. Faivre. Dr. Theodore Thomson^ Medical Adviser to the Local Government Board, who was selected to carry out this mission, arrived in the Gulf in February 1906 and remained there for a month on tour, the H.I.M.S. a Lawrence being placed at his disposal by the British Political Resident. The conclusion^ at which Dr. Thomson arrived, and which he embodied in his report, were entirely unfavourable to the Persian Gulf scheme of the Paris Conference. He pointed out that native sailing boats, which being able to approach the shore are more dangerous as carriers of infection than steamers, would avoid a sanitary station at the entrance of the Gulf and, after they had passed it, would be safe from de tection : in his opinion therefore the system proposed was even to be deprecated, as it would induce the masters of native vessels which had avoided the station and on which disease existed to conceal the facts after arrival at their port of destination. Dr. Thomson also remarked that, in case of plague or cholera obtaining a foothold, as had already mo v e than once happened inside the Persian Gulf, it would apparently be necessary under the scheme to require vessels from the infected ports to call either at the sentinel station ' near the mouth of the Gulf or at Basrah, and that the enforcement of such an obligation in practice would be utterly impossible. The proposed system,^ he observed, would be more severe than that established in the Red Sea, where there was no general a sentinel station at the entrance ; and, in consequence of the detention of vessels and of their deflection from their course, would be prejudicial 10 commerce, especially to that carried on by sailing ships. In case, however, a station at the mouth of the Gulf should be insisted on as necessary. Dr. Thomson was inclined to recommend Hani am as the site for the same, partly because of the superior anchorage there, and partly because of the slight deviation (10 miles) from their natural route to which steamers would be subjected. Dr Thomson's own recommendations were that attention should be chiefly' concentrated on the Kuwait-Basrah-Muhammareh line round the head of the Gulf, a fully equipped sanitary station being maintained at each of those places, and that Bushehr and Bandar Abbas on the Persian Coast should be similarly treated; from the standpoint of the security of Europe, he considered, Bahrain and the places on the Arabian coast south of Kuwait might be neglected. Plague and Cholera preventive measures in the Persian Gulf, 1896-1907. We may now take a brief retrospect of the prophylactic measures adopted since 1896 by the countries surrounding the Persian Gult, and' we shall find that they fall under two categories, viz., those2544 instituted by or under the advice of the British Government and those for which the Turkish authorities have been responsible. The regulations of the Venice Conference of 1897 were adopted imme diately on their appearance by the Government of India at their own ports, and in 1897 the pilgrimage to Makkah from India was forbidden as a special precaution; similarly the measures observed in Persia, ^Oman and Bahrain, suggested as they were by the British Government, were governed in the main by the spirit of the Convention of 1897 ; but the sanitary policy of the Ottoman Government, which we shall describe first, was conservative and peculiar. Sanitary regulations and arrangements of Turkey in the Persian Gulf, 1896-1907. Rules at Basrah, 1896 to January 1897. Proceedings in connection with Fao, Jnnuary 1897. In October 1896, after the appearance of plague in India, the sanitary authorities at Constantinople directed 10 days^ quarantine, reckoned from the date of arrival, to be enforced on Bombay vessels at Basrah ; the local authorities seem at first to have insisted on a period of 21 days, but it was never enforced. About the 11th of January 1897 quarantine was imposed at Basrah against Muhammareh as well as against Bombay ; and an attempt was made to withdraw the faculty of discharging and loading cargo in quarantine, the export trade of Turkish ^Iraq being thereby immediately brought to a standstill. At the end of January 1897 the entrance of Shi^ah pilgrims and corpses from India was absolutely interdicted. On the 12th of January 1897 it was decided by the Board of Health at Constantinople that, pending the construction of a lazaret at Fao, all ships having plague cases on board should be repulsed from Basrah; but this drastic resolution was rescinded after it had been enforced, in a single instance only, against a steamer of the Bombay and Persia Steam Navigation Company. A fortnight later it was announced that the Porte had decided on establishing a permanent sanitary station at Pao, —the existing post being in fact merely nominal,—and a Commission was appointed to select a site; but nothing more was done, and Fao remained as it had been since 1872 (and still is) a mere sanitary office in charge of a prepose and two gardes, devoid of a lazaret and of all sanitary apparatus. The Constantinople Board of Health further recommended that all ships from India should be examined at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, but nothing came of this suggestion which was opposed by the Government of India. Some of these developments seem to anticipate the results of the Venice Conference of 1897^ which did not however close until about two months later. # Fvom 1891 to 1894 the Turkish Government were anxious to transfer the Basrah quarantine station to Fao ; but their scheme, of which the motives were purely political, was frustrated by the opposition of the British and Russian delegates on the Constantinople Board of Health.f4os 2545 On the 2nd of February 1897 the Board of Health at Constantinople^ Designs in reverting to the proposals of 1894^ decided to establish posts at Kuwait Bahrain and and Qatif and in Bahrain and Qatar; but the greater part of the scheme was successfully resisted by the British delegate^ who stated that Kuwait was an independent Shaikhdom^ that Bahrain was an indepen dent principality under British protection, and that Qatar was not recognised by His Majesty^s Government to be Turkish possession. The proposals of the Board were carried into effect only at Kuwait and Qatif, at each of which places one propose and one garde were an( j stationed. The post at Kuwait had a brief existence only, viz., from April 1897 till September 1901 when the prepose was withdrawn and was not replaced; and even during his presence it was admitted that ' his role was purely platonic and his action nil ' The Board also decided that ships from infected ports arriving on Proceedings the coast of Hasa should be repulsed to Basrah,—a resolution very disconcerting to the local Turkish authorities in Hasa who feared that scarcity and rebellion would be the result; in the end, as a concession to the objections of the Turkish executive, a lazaret was by order of the Board established at 'Oqair. It was opened in March 1897, but it never served any useful purpose, and in six months'' time it had disappeared ; in the interval two of the staff had died, one had deserted, and the doctor with the remaining garde had withdrawn on his own responsibility to Basrah. The Board of Health also created about this time a skeleton organisa- Commissions tion for the sanitary control of the whole Gulf. It consisted of a Board Commission at Basrah and of two flying Commissions for the eastern and ® 90 ^ ea ' western shores of the Gulf respectively; the two flying Commissions, which visited the most important points on both littorals and collected a quantity of useful information, appear to have been headed by Drs. Camposampiero and Izzedine whose reports are mentioned in the footnote at the beginning of this Appendix. On the 12th of February 1897 the quarantine at Basrah against Changes in passengers from India was increased from 10 to 15 days, but about the a middle of March it was reduced to 12 days. At the beginning of July February to there was another change, the quarantine at Basrah against the ports of August the Persian Gulf being reduced to five days ; and again, at the end of the 1897. month, this quarantine was further reduced or temporarily abolished, and the entrance of pilgrims and corpses from Persia, which had been prohi bited, was again permitted. On the 5th of August quarantine against India was lowered to 10 days, the period being still calculated (as it always had been) from the time of arrival at Basrah, not from that of departure from India. After this matters seem to have remained unchanged until 1899, on Designs in the Uth of April in which year the Turkish Governor of Hasa, m an Bahrain official report, revived the proposal to establish a quarantine station in ' Bahrain; Bahrain was, of course, assumed to be Turkish possession, and the maintenance of quarantine in Hasa against Bahrain was strongly deprecated for very cogent reasons. The scheme, however, was thrown out at the instance of the British delegate on the Board of Health, who 1702546 Dr. Borers report, 1901. Relaxation of the rules at Basrah, 1903. Characteris tics of the Turkigh system. repeated that Bahrain was an independent state under British protection ; and an alternative proposal to re-establish the lazaret at ^Oqair was also vetoed. How the question of Hasa was finally settled does not appear from the records. In 1900 Dr. Borel, a Frenchman^ was nominated to the post of Sanitary Officer at Basrah; and in January 1901 he reported to the Board of Health on the whole subject of the sanitary defence of the Persian Gulf. He commented strongly on the severity of the system in force at Basrah under which^ between March 1896 and September 1900^ no less than 409 steamers had been quarantined and 8,000^ passengers and 20,000 members of crews had been subjected to isolation and dis infection without any useful result except that a net profit of about £4,000 sterling had accrued to the Sanitary Department from the operations. A recommendation by Dr. Borel, to the effect that quarantine against Gulf Ports not infected with plague or cholera should be reduced (except for ships from India) to 48 hours after arrival, appears to have been adopted. On the 26th of March 1901 the absolute prohibi tion of 1897 against the bringing of Shi'ah pilgrims by Indian ships was modified by the Board of Health, and such ships were permitted to bring in future a number of pilgrims not exceeding 5 per hundred tons register. On the 29th of December 1903 the Constantinople Board of Health, on the motion of the British and Persian representatives, and influenced doubtless by the views of the Paris Conference of 1903, decided that the quarantine of 48 hours then in force at Basrah against Persian ports should be replaced by a medical visit and disinfection, and also that ships from Indian ports which had been more than 12 days absent from India and had received pratique at an intermediate port in the Gulf should receive pratique at Basrah after a medical visit and disinfection only ; ships of the last mentioned class moreover, if they had been disinfected at Bushehr and had not touched at any place between there and Basrah, need not even be disinfected at Basrah. Effect was given without delay to this salutary decision; and further, on the 15th of June, the quarantine against ships from Bombay with clean bills of health but unable to benefit by the 12 days'' rule was lowered from 10 to 5 days to be reckoned as usual from the date of arrival at Basrah : in the case of vessels from India carrying Shi^ah pilgrims it was ordered, however, that the 48 hours' rule should only apply if the number of pilgrims on board was 1 per cent, or less of the registered tonnage of the snip. Indian pilgrims, as a rule, now disembark at Muhammareh, proceeding subsequently by Ballam to Basrah, where they are admitted on the production of proof that they have duly performed quarantine at Muhammareh. From the facts recited it will be apparent that Turkish quarantine has up to the present time remained, by reason of excessive stringency and constant variation of the rules, a serious impediment to commerce and travel in 'Iraq. It may be added that its protective value is at the same time very low. Many native passengers succeed in evading it altogether, and the equipment of the Basrah sanitary station was until lately very defective, there being indeed no hospital accommodation of any sort 5 but recently—as already mentioned—a considerable sum has2547 been voted for its improvement. After discussion it has been resolved to maintain the Basrah station at its present site on -'Ajairawiyah island, where 10 Jaribs of land will be permanently acquired for the purpose by the Turkish Government. Sanitary regulations and arrangements of Persia in the Persian Gulf, 1896-1907. We turn next to the sanitary precautions taken at the ports of Persia since 1896. In October 1896 the necessity of action became apparent to the Institution of Persian Government, and an effort was 4 at first made by them to carry quarantine, out the necessary arrangements by purely Persian agency. After much 1896 - discussion between the Persian Government and the British Legation in consultation with the Residency at Bushehr, an understanding was reached which involved the minimum of injury to trade compatible with adequate protection. For healthy vessels from India quarantine was fixed at five days from arrival in the ports of Bushehr and Muhammareh and at seven days in Persian ports nearer to India than Bushehr; and in the case of plague-infected vessels passengers and cargo^ were not to be landed, but the mails might be sent ashore without detention of the vessel. ^ The Persian Government appear to have been conscious of their inability to carry out the regulations satisfactorily, and almost from the^ first the management was practically delegated to the British Residency at Bushehr ; in the beginning, however, much obstruction was offered by the local Persian officials, who could not reconcile themselves to the loss of sanitary powers by which they might have grown rich veiy rapidly. In January 1897, the Russian Government being then on the point Arrange- of despatching Russian doctors to the Gulf ^ study the question of ^ plague prophylaxis, the Persian Government agreed to the deputation from the BrUiah India, at their expense, of two European Assistant-Surgeons to take anthoritiee, charge of the sanitary arrangements at Bandar' Ahhas and ^ingeh. T eee 1897. officers left India on the 9th of February 1897, and on the following day another Assistant-Surgeon of the Indian establishment was sent from Bushehr to take sanitary charge of the port of Muliammareh. The services of the Assistant-Surgeons at Bushehr and Jashk also were requisitioned for sanitary work at their own stations. In March it was reported that the Persian Government had sent definite orders to Bushehr confirming the authority of the British Residency Surgeon in sanitary matters and that the f riction with the local Persian authorities had been to a large extent removed. The Persian gunboat Pempohs at the same time received orders from the Person Government to crmse at the mouth of the Gulf and to prevent coasting-vessels g her crew were at the time in a state of mutiny, and it does not appear that the action directed was taken. In 1898-99 the quarantine at Persian V ort, a^inBt K^adu was 10 days from the date of departure m the case of healthy, and 10 days from the date of arrival in the case of infected ships. a2548 Plague disturbances at Busliehr, 1899. Partial substitution of surveil lance for detention, but not maintained, 1899. General results to 1903. The small outbreak of plague which occurred at Bushehr in May 1899 led to the deputation of Captain Rainier, I.M.S., from India for the purpose of devising a scheme to prevent the spread of plague in and from Bushehr. The activity of the,British medical officers in investigat ing the epidemic at Bushehr and the expectation that drastic measures would be applied gave rise to an ebullition of popular feeling which at one moment threatened to become serious. The Darya Baigi, then Governor of the Gulf Ports, at first gave assurances that all necessary measures could and would be enforced ; but he subsequently modified his tone and said that with the small garrison at his disposal nothing could be done in face of the general opposition. On the 31st of July a demonstration took place at Bushehr, in which the windows of the Persian Telegraph Office were broken and stones were thrown at the British Residency ; but the crowd consisted mostly of juveniles, and the Mujtahids of the town voluntarily supplied escorts to protect Europeans from annoyance. There were rumours, however, that requests for aid in resisting plague precautions had been sent to the chief men of Dashtistan, and the British Resident was given discretion by the British Minister at Tehran to bring Indian troops to Bushehr, in case of necessity, from Jashk and Chahbar. While the crisis lasted feeling ran high, and large gatherings were held in some of the mosques ; but on the 3rd of August the disturbance subsided, partly under threats from the Darya Begi who had obtained some men from Angali, Shabankareh and Dashtistan ; and on the 4th of August the bazaar, which had been closed, was re opened. In October some of the ringleaders were bastinadoed at the demand of Colonel Meade, the British Resident, and others were expelled from the town. As plague had meanwhile died out at Bushehr and did not subsequently reappear, the organisation of protective measures was discontinued, and in February 1900 Captain Rainier returned to India. In July 1899 the Government of India instructed Colonel Meade that surveillance for a fixed period after arrival might, at Bushehr and other Persian ports, be substituted for detention under observation in the case of all classes of persons whose daily inspection could be assured, and effect was given to the order by exempting first and second-class passengers and their servants from detention; this form of differential treatment, however, was badly received by the Persian Government, as it appeared to them to favour Europeans, and it became necessary to revert to wholesale detention without discrimination of status. The arrangements at all Persian ports worked smoothly, if we except the slight trouble at Bushehr in 1899, from 1897 to 1903 ; they were inexpensive; and they effectually preserved the country from infec tion. The cost to the Persian Government of the special staff and contingencies at Muhammareh, Lingeh and Bandar ' Abbas was less than £100 per mensem, and the expenditure in allowances and contingencies at Bushehr and Jashk, which amounted to £20 a month, was borne by the Government of India. The Persian Government were also represented in the Gulf during part of this time by a physician of their own, whose real function was to keep a watch upon the proceedings of the British sanitary authorities at Bushehr and elsewhere. This individual was at first a certain Zain-ul-^Abidm, appointed in 1899; but he was succeeded in 1900 linied to : , until Ma; in 1908, h isian Minis ifcthe co h\ politic itment wl ipt that t kj fees I G. n i Persia, an principal ] an dock m Lega ''ornajew; k and 1 ieven ordei ation on j U free o iffn that ■jted, in co State an ii No act; lie Biiti 'fsty's Goi inform a chi . ,et 'majesty'i 'ie Pe ? wd, tui ^reatmc the in / crenel 'rfthep J* of a '^setc visited iffii isi of tl taryby another Persian doctor, known as the Sadr-ul-Atibba. The latter continued to acconnpany the British Residency Surgeon on board ships, etc., until May 1901, when he was withdrawn. In 1908, however, difficulties arose, apparently in consequence of the Attempt to Russian Minister at Tehran having advised the Persian Government to transfer the transfer the control of sanitary operations on the southern coast from the C0nt I J 0 l British political officials to those of the Imperial Persian Customs—a authorities department which had hitherto had no connection with sanitary matters^ to the except that they had been made responsible for the collection of all Imperial sanitary fees and that they disbursed the money spent on sanitation by Persian the Persian Government. The Russians had from the beginning shown ^^ oms ' or pretended much concern at the prospect of plague being introduced into Persia, and the appointment of British employes to the charge of the principal ports had excited their political apprehensions. Several Russian doctors had visited the Gulf, including Dr. Marc of the Russian Legation at Tehran and Dr. Ost in 1897, Drs. Rodzewite: and Kornajewski in 1898, and Dr. Paschkowski, who remained, chiefly at Bushehr, from 1898 to 1899. In July 1903 the Customs officials at Jashk and Muhammareh attempted to interfere in sanitary matters and even ordered the Assistant Surgeon at the former place to enforce detention on arrivals from Bahrain after those islands had been officially declared free of plague on the 15th of July ; and in August it became known that M. Naus, the Belgian Minister of Customs, had^ been directed, in connection with the prevalence of plague at Bahrain, to institute an inquiry into the working of the sanitary arrangements in the Gulf. No action appears to have been taken by M. Naus under this order. The British Minister at Tehran was immediately instructed by His Unsuccessful Majesty's Government to protest in strong terms against any alteration British pro- of the system introduced at the request of the Persian Government in 1897, es * and to inform the Persian Government that the Customs officials appealed to be unfitted by want of experience for the supervision of sanitary work, and that a change prejudicially affecting British trade and shipping in the Gulf, where they held a preponderating position, would be regarded by His Majesty's Government as uncalled-for and even unfriendly* To this protest the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs replied that there was no intention of ousting the British medical officers from the positions which they held, but that they had resorted to an objectionable form of differ ential treatment at Bushehr and had shown laxity m their precautions against the importation of plague from Bahrain. A French doctor, M. Bussiere, had meanwhile been attached to the Proceeding^ staff of the French Vice-Consulate at Bushehr and was understood to be of ^Bussie- in receipt of an allowance from the Customs Department; m February 1904 he set out on an official tour in the Persian gunboat Persepohs officialS) i904, and visited Muhammareh, Lingeh, bandar Abbas and the same time the Director of Customs at Bandar Abbas took it upon Himself to issue peremptory executive orders to the A f ls t a ^-Suigeon in charge of the port; and in May 1904 the Sadr-ahAtibba, who after three years'quiescence now suddenly reappeared began to intrude into the solitary arrangements at Mnhammareh. Under instructions from2550 Successful British protest, 1904. the British Legation the Assistant-Surgeons met these attempted encroach ments by declining in courteous terms to recognise the authority of the Customs. On the 16th of May an ingenious attempt was made to under mine the authority of the British Residency Surgeon by constituting a ' sanitary council ' at Bushehr ; M. Bussiere being appointed Secretary, to concert local measures in view of the prevalence of cholera in Bahrain and at Basrah and of plague at Lingeh; by this council the town of Bushehr was subsequently divided into three sanitary sections of which one was entrusted to the British Residency Surgeon/one to the Assistant-Surgeon and one to JVI. Bussiere. The policy of the anti-British party was appar ently to call in question the right of the Residency Surgeon to direct sanitary measures on shore, and to restrict his authority, if possible, to measures affecting the harbour and shipping. A test case occurred about the 20th of June 1904 when M. Bussiere, without consulting Captain Condon, the Residency Surgeon, proceeded to visit some, cholera-infected villages in the neighbourhood of Bushehr against which quarantine had been instituted by the Persian Governor of Bushehr at the instance of the Residency Surgeon. On his return from tour on the 24th of June M. Bussiere was met at the town boundary by Captain Condon and brought in under a special exemption,—an act of politeness which he did not appear entirely to appreciate. At the end of July the Director-General of Cus toms at Bushehr caused some detention-sheds erected on the landward side of the town by the Residency Surgeon to be removed, and thereafter arri vals from the country were absolutely denied admittance ; and in the beginning of August the Director-General even went so far as to order the detention of a native vessel in the harbour although it had received pra tique from the British Residency establishment. On a protest from the British Resident, Major Cox, the detention- sheds were re-established after a few days; but the reply of the Director- General to his communication was highly unsatisfactory, and a strenuous protest founded on these incidents was accordingly made on the 22nd of August by Sir A. Hardinge, the British Minister at Tehran. The atti tude of the Persian Government, who ignored the wider aspects of the question and argued, not without plausibility, that the Shah retained his sovereign rights in sanitary matters and might therefore issue orders to the British medical staff through any medium including that of the Belgian customs administration, was obstinate ; and the possibility of a British war-vessel being sent to Bushehr and a guard landed in support of the British Minister's protest was at one time contemplated. At the beginning of September, however, the Persian Government yielded, and instructions were sent to the Customs authorities to abstain from inter ference in sanitary matters ; the precise terms of the orders are uncertain, and qualifications were probably introduced by the Director-General at Bushehr in repeating them to his subordinates, but the effect has been to put an end, since 1904, to the encroachments of the Customs on the duties of the sanitary staff. In 1905, however, a flagrant breach of quarantine was committed by M. Passek, the Russian Consul-General at Bushehr, but he with his whole house was placed in quarantine, and an explanation was demanded of him by the Governor of Bushehr acting on behalf of the Persian Government.2551 A so-called Conseil de Sante had been formed at Tehran in 1899, if not earlier ; and placed under the Ministry of Public Instruction ; but it was rather a society for the discussion of medical subjects than a branch of the public service, and it soon ceased to meet regularly. At length in July 1904 a permanent Sanitary Council for Persia, such as had been suggested by the Austro-Hungarian representatives at Paris in 1894, was constituted by Imperial decree upon a quasi-international basis; it was to meet once a month or oftener ; it was to discuss all sani- tary questions affecting the country ; it was to depend on the Persian Ministry of the Interior ; and it might correspond directly with similar bodies in other countries, especially with the Constantinople Board of Health and with the Office Sanitaire International Central de Paris proposed by the Paris Conference of 1903, should the latter ever be created. At the time of its formation the Sanitary Council of Persia included (besides representatives of various Departments of the Persian Government) the European physicians of the court and the medical officers of the foreign Legations, and the members of British nationality were then four in number as against two French, two Russian, one German, one American and one Turkish. The new Council has directed its attention to questions of practical hygiene, but chiefly to the subject of epidemics ; and some improvement of sanitary conditions generally, the foundation of a vaccination Institute and the opening of new hos pitals at certain centres in the provinces are claimed as the fruits of ^ its labours, but in the Persian Gulf there are not as yet many tangible evidences of its activity. The Council publishes a monthly report of its proceedings, and all consular and other European doctors in Persia are treated as corresponding members. Since the spring of 190o the Council has, as a matter of' courtesy, been supplied by the Eesidency Surgeon at Bushehr and the Assistant-Surgeons under his orders with information relating to the public health in the neighbourhood of the places where they are stationed ; but it is reported to have shown, under the presidentship of Dr Schneider, a French physician to the Shah, an inclination to disregard the official reports of the British Residency Surgeon and to attach weight to the irresponsible communications of M. Bussiere. A charitable dispensary under the Assistant-Surgeon in charge of quarantine was opened at Bandar 'Abbas in March 1906 and has been the means of relieving much suffering among the very poor; this measure 'jvas undertaken by the Government of India.

The case of 'Oman next falls to be considered The S nit an of 'Oman did not agree, until considerable pressure had been Mm, to the adoption of any precautionary measures ag^nst plague at his ports of Masqat and Gwadar. Eventually with e fi eo t apParent y from the ]3th of January 1897, rules drafted by a committee wmch consisted of the Foreign Consular officers at Masqat and a representative Apathy of the Sultan, 1897-98.2552 Independent action by tie Sulton, 1899. Arrange ments hand ed over to the British authorities, 1900. of the Sultan were made applicable at both places to vessels arriving from Bombay and Karachi; by these rules the landing of persons or of articles other than mails from vessels infected or nnder suspicion of being infected with plague was prohibited, and it was provided that passengers by healthy ships should be detained under observation at Haramul, 1| miles from Masqat, till the expiry of a period of 9 days reckoned from the time of the vessel leaving the last infected port. The Sultan insisted on adding a vexatious condition that cargo should be worked by ships^ crews and that coolies from the shore should not go on board vessels from India. The Government of India at this time considered that the period of observation ought to be 10 days, but the Sultan does not appear to have deferred to their opinion, for by the beginning of May 1897 the time had been reduced at Gwadar to 7 days calculated from the date of arrival ; and in April 1899, when plague first showed itself at Masqat, detention as practised there was for 6 days only. In his first alarm at the appearance of the disease in his capital in 1890 the Sultan increased the period of detention to 10 days from the date of arrival at Masqat; and at the same time he requested the Govern ment of India to undertake the sanitary control of that port on his behalf. The British Agency Surgeon having intimated what staff was necessary for the purpose, two H ospital-Assistants were immediately despatched from India; but the Sultan, on their arrival, declined to be responsible for their salaries, and, though they remained at Masqat until September at the expense of the Government of India, their services, in consequence of the objections of His Highness, were not utilised. The Sultan also refused to accede to a wish expressed by the Government of India, that the detention period of 10 days from arrival at Masqat should be con- Verted into one of 10 days from departure from an infected port; and on the 18th of July 1899, acting on the advice of the French Consul at Masqat, he rejected a fresh code of regulations which had been drafted by the British Agency Surgeon, Colonel Jayakar, and even abolished sanitary restrictions at Masqat altogether. In August, however, cholera broke out at Gwadar, and on the ^5th of that month restric tions were reimposed at Masqat. When in January 1900 cholera died out in ■'Oman and was suc ceeded by plague at Matrah and Masqat, the Sultan obtained by private arrangement two native practitioners with plague experience from India, and it seems to have been his intention at first to combat the spread of the epidemic without other aid or advice. While the disease was still prevalent, however, a Hospital-Assistant intended for the British Vice- Consulate at Bandar 'Abbas was temporarily diverted to Masqat for plague duty by the Government of India, and inoculation was success fully introduced among the people, over 200 persons being treated by Colonel Jayakar. The Sultan soon after this fell back on the good offices of the British Agency, now in charge of Captain P. Z. Cox; and at length, with effect from the 1st of October 1900, he handed over the entire protective arrangements at Masqat to the British Agency Surgeon, under whose orders he placed at the same time his own sanitary employes. This amicable arrangement still (1907) conti nues in force, and since its initiation all measures at ports of the ''Oman iliamo9 2553 Sultanate have been regulated by the principles of the Venice Convention of 1897. In July 1903, by means of a notification under the Masqat Order in Council of 1867, observance of the Sultan's sanitary regu lations was made binding on British subjects residing in his territories. Preventive measures in Bahrain 3 1896-1907. The only other principality of the Persian Gulf in which pre- auti onary measures have been applied since 1896 is Bahrain. In February 1897 the position in Bahrain was taken into con- Passive re- sideration by the Britisli Folitical Eesident in the Gulf with the result distance of that a non-medical agent was despatched from Bushehr to assist the ' Shaikh in creating a simple system of sanitary protection; and a local representative of the Resident, subsequently appointed, was placed under the authority of the Residency Surgeon at Bushehr and ordered to see that measures prescribed by the Residency were earned out by the Shaikh. The services of an Assistant-Surgeon were offered to the Shaikh of Bahrain by the Government of India, but the proposal was unpalatable to him and was not pressed The ^ ° receiving British assistance wag founded ^ostensibly on the repugnance of his subjects to scientific plague precautions, and m support of his statement the Shaikh submitted a petition to which a number of signatures were attached; but the real reason of his refusal was probably fW Klrp the Sultan of 'Oman, he disliked British interference in Siei of internal ffJvemment, .U«... 1. wished t, r.l.in c.nte.1 the highly ni-olltable institution of qnarantme, the odium of which it was SyX Wm t. t upun th.

The actual sanitary situation in the Persian Gulf may be summed up as follows : — The administrative scheme propounded by the Paris Conference of 1903 for the sanitary defence of Europe in the Persian Gulf has not come into force; and the obstacles to its execution are of such a nature that their removal at present appears improbable. In the absence of a general organisation^ local systems under the management of Turkey and of Great Britain continue to exist. At the Turkish ports rules prescribed by the Constantinople Board of Health are in force, which are stringent in a degree not justifiable under the Con vention of 1903 or even that of 1897, and which by their severity to a great extent defeat their own objects. Outside of Turkish territory, sanitary organisation, where it exists, is in the hands of the political representatives of the British Government and is worked in general harmony with the conclusions of the Conferences of 1897 and 1903, except that in Persia the procedure with respect to plague is regulated entirely by the Convention of 1897; but the rules, especially in regard to disinfection and the destruction of rats, are not as yet carried out in their entirety at all places. Since January 1905, under the instructions of His Majesty^ Government, the British Embassy at Constantinople has been kept in^ formed by telegraph of the sanitary state of the Persian Gulf ports and has been supplied with detailed reports of local epidemics by the British political and consular staff in the Gulf. Smallpox in the Persian Gulf. In concluding our remarks upon sanitary matters in the Persian Gulf, we may draw attention to the frequent presence in that region of smallpox, which at times assames an active epidemic form. In April 1802 vaccination was successfully introduced at Baghdad by the Civil Surgeon of the British Residency with vaccine matter obtained from Vienna ; and in the following month the operations were extended to Basrah. At the middle of the 19th century smallpox was generally prevalent and much dreaded among the populations of the Persian Gulf, and applications for lymph were sometimes made by natives to the surgeons of British vessels.*4^ 2555 Of recent smallpox epidemics one in 1891, accompanied by a serious 1891-189??. outbreak of influenza, caused considerable mortality in Bahrain and Qatif and on Qishm island. The disease was rife at Gwadar, where even Khojahs and Hindus refused to let their sick be isolated or removed to hospital, from March to May in 1892; and from June to October 1893 it prevailed, concurrently with cholera and remittent fever, upon the upper Karun. In 1897 there was much smallpox in Trucial ''Oman; and the 1897-1903. cholera epidemic of 1899 in the ; Oman Sultanate was preceded by a virulent outbreak of smallpox in which 6,000 persons are supposed to have perished. In April 1900 the malady recurred upon the coast of Trucial ''Oman and caused, according to one report, some 500 deaths in the town of Sharjah alone. In 1901 smallpox was prevalent about Basrah and Muhammareh and was responsible for a considerable mortality in the latter neighbourhood; and in the winter of 1902-1908 it visited Bushehr. The places of origin of these epidemics of smallpox and the con nection of the epidemics with one another are m most cases not discoverable. I - 'r-fl-2656 APPENDIX ); THE ARMS AND AMMUNITION TRAFFIC IN GULFS OF PERSIA AND 'OMAN.* THE The arms trade in the Gulf during and immediately after the Afghan War, 1879-1881. Pfecaution- arj measures in India. 1880. Prohibition of the trade in Persia, 1881. During the Third Afghan War the trade in modern arms and ammuni tion in the Persian Gulf attracted the attention of the British and Indian Governments for the first time. In 1880 ; when it was placed beyond doubt that large quantities of percussion caps exported from India to Persia were reaching the Afghan troops at Herat and elsewhere^ the Government of India ; recognising the political and military importance of the question^ instructed the Govern ment of Bombay to abstain from granting licenses for the export of heavy consignments of arms and ammunition to Persian Gulf Ports^ and to watch carefully the import of such articles at Karachi and on the coast to the westward. On the 1st October in the same year a notification was published by the Government of India to legalise the detention at Indian ports of cargoes of arms and ammunitions of war consigned to the Persian Gulf from other countries. Meanwhile the Persian Government had been persuaded to prohibit the exportation of percussion caps from Persia^ and instructions in this sense had been issued by them to the local authorities at Bandar ^Abbas, Bampur, Kirman and Yazd^ as well as to those in Khurasan. The Persian Government appear soon after this to have developed an interest in the purely Persian aspect of the question; and in 1881; at the personal instance of the Shah; the importation of arms and ammunition into the country was made illegal. The prohibitory edict came into force at Btishehr on or about the 1st of July 1881 ; and the principal firms doing business there under British protection were duly warned by the Political Besident of the change in the law. * This Appendix, compiled entirely from the records in the Political Department of the Government of India, was finished in its original form in May 1906, and was then revised on the spot by Major P. Z. Cox, Political Eesident in the Persian Gulf, by Major W. Grey, Political Agent at Masqat, by Major S. G. Knox, Political Trfby Mr. P. E. Crow, Consul at Basrah. By the courtesy of s ajesty's^Legation in Persia and of the Government of the North-Western on ier Province of India, the draft was also examined at Tehran and Peshawar. k2557 Gradual development of the traffic^ 1881-91, / t/i V heisfeife msigiel' lei top infcfc lalfe^ No large or systematic trade, however, as yet existed in the Gulf; and for several years no marked symptoms of expansion were observable. In 1881 a consignment of breech-loading rifles and ammunition was imported by French merchants at Muhammareh; it was at first seized by the local authorities, but was subsequently returned and sold off by the owners at very low prices. At Bushehr the pioneers of the traffic were Messrs. A. and T. J. Malcolm, a Persian Armenian firm under British protection. Messrs. Malcolm began to import arms in 1884, and they were followed by Messrs. Fracis, Times and Co., a Parsi and English house, whose first agency was established at Bushehr in 1887. On the East Coast of Africa the arms trade was an auxiliary of the slave trade, and a blow was struck at it in the General Act of the Brussels Conference of 2nd of July 1890, which was formally adopted by Great Britain on the 2nd of April 1892. The contraction of the African market compelled manufacturers and exporters to seek another outlet for their goods, and the unfortunate result was the diversion of the African arms trade to the Persian Gulf, which, lying altogether above the 20th parallel of north latitude, was not subject to the arms clauses of the Brussels Act. The diversion must have begun before the final closure of the African field; for we find that permission to tranship 1,477 guns, 44 pistols and 82,050 bullets at Zanzibar for Bahrain was refused by the Indian authorities at Bombay as early as 1888. The importation of arms at Masqat was now considerable, and the possibility of their introduction thence into the Native States of 'Western India was discussed; but inquiry revealed no real danger, and a slight supervision to be exercised over the trade by the British Political Agen at Masqat was regarded as a sufficient safeguard for the time being Attention was directed at the same time to facilities which were alleged to exist for the importation of arms and ammunition through Gwadar and Bandar 'Abbas into Afghanistan and the Indian frontier tract; and the facts were investigated by Sir Robert Sandeman Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan, under the orders of the Government of India. It was found that a number of guns and pistols were being imported at Gwadar and Chahbar, and to a lesser extent at Ormarah, from Masqat; but these were mostly smooth-bores of_ little value, received at Masqat from Zanzibar and said to be of American manufacture, and the number of them imported at Gwadar was only about 300 per annum. The existence of any regular trade with Afghanistan was not established, the dealers at this time confining their operations to Southern Balu chistan ; but it was shown that some of the arms found their way inland as far as Kharan. There was also a considerable importation of lead, gunpowder and percussion caps on the Makran coast, chiefly from Commence ment at Muham- mareh and Bushehr. Diversion of the African arms trade by the Brussels Convention, 1890. Prohibition of the trade at Gwadar, 1891.2558 Renewal of the prohibi tion in Persia, 1891. To meet the incipient danger in Makran the Sultan of 'Oman, at the instance of the Government of India, forbade by means of a proclamation dated the 3rd of March 1891 the importation and exportation of arms and ammunition at Gwadar.* In Persia, in the same year, the Shah's prohibitory edict of 1881 was reiterated in stringent terms, apparently in consequence of infractions of the law having come to the notice of the authorities through the sale of arms by British and Parsi merchants at Tehran. More rapid progress of the trade, 1891-97. Direct ship ments from Europe and growth of the Masqat mar ket. First interdict on exporta tion from 'Oman to Africa, 1892. Increase of the trade at Masqat. Increase of the trade Persia. m The stream of arms flowing from Zanzibar into Masqat continued to increase in volume, and it was estimated that, between April 1890 and June 1892, no less than 11,500 firearms were landed at the latter port. A large proportion of these were brought by the Sultan of Zanzibar's steamers, and the three principal Khojah merchants at Matrah were now engaged in the trade. Direct shipments from Europe had also begun, and at the end of 1890 a consignment of 420 Enfields from Austria-Hungary for Khojah merchants at Gwadar was stopped at Karachi. More than half the arms received were, even at this period, re-exported from Masqat to Kuwait, Bahrain and other ports in the Persian Gulf ; thus early was the development of Masqat into the chief arms emporium of the Middle East foreshadowed. A few arms were carried also from Masqat to Sur and other places on the 'Oman seaboard, and complaints began to be received through Zanzibar of exportation from Masqat to the Somali and Banadir coasts of Africa. The allegation was not clearly established ; but the Sultan of 'Oman, to satisfy the scruples of the British Government, by an order dated 30th April 1892 prohibited the re-exportation from his territories to Africa of firearms received from that quarter. The Sultan, how ever, from a fear that his subjects might be led to seek French maritime protection in increasing numbers, would not consent to the search of 'Qmani vessels by British men-of-war, and the order remained virtually a dead-letter. Year by year the trade continued to expand at Masqat, where it was in all respects legal and was favourably regarded by the Sultan on account of the large profits that he derived from the import duty on arms. About 1895 it began to assume really formidable dimensions. The importations of 1895-96 at Masqat were estimated at 4,350 rifles and 604,1)00 cartridges, and those of 1896-97 at 20,000 rifles with a proportionate number of cartridges. Nor were indications wanting of the progress of the trade in Persia, although in that country it had for 10 years been absolutely forbidden * This prohibition was inconsistent with certain of his obligations under com mercial treaties. It is difficult to understand why its propriety has not even yet been questioned by any foreign power. ict jbut ,. ) wj 'A the 'or■ -■ [a p^ riles 2559 by law. In 1892 or 1893 about a thousand Martini-Henry rifles were imported at Bnshehr by native mercliants from Kuwait. In December 1893 a consignment of 220 Snider rifles, 40 Martini-Henry rifles and 4 cases of ammunition from London, ostensiidy for transhipment ^ to Masqat, was seized at Bushehr under the orders of the Persian Government; and again, in 1895, a large consignrreut of arms arriving at Bushehr by sea fell into the hands of the Persian autho rities. Seizures were, however, the exception; as a rule contraband arms and ammunition found easy entrance into Persia, on payment of blackmail to Persian officials ; and a number of firms, including several of British nationality, but not those of the highest standing, continued (o be engaged in the trade. The appointment of a Persian preventive officer in January 1&gt;96, under the title of Amin-i-Aslihah, made no difference to the traffic, and it soon became evident that his real function was to tap the stream of bribes paid by arms dealers for the benefit of high Persian officials, or even of the Persian Government itself. Bushehr had by this time developed into a great arms and ammunition port and it was estimated that in 1897 no less than 30^000 rifles were landed there, on which the Local Governor recovered illicit duty at a rate of from 8 per cent, to 10 per cent, ad valorem * Shiraz had become an important distributing centre dependent on Bushehr, and the Kashkai tribe and the Tangistanis were now excellently armed, Bahrain, too, had grown into an emporium of secondary, but still con siderable, importance for arms and ammunition. At this time, with the exception of a good many Belgian rifles made at Liege t and of a small number brought from France, the arms and ammunition imported at Masqat were entirely of British^ origin, and the trade was chiefly in the hands of Messrs. Joyce and Kynoch : about two-thirds of the shipments were received direct from the United Kingdom and the remainder via Bushehr. Germany, it was understood, prohibited her subjects from joining in the Masqat arms trade, on the ground that the nearness of that place to the prohibited zone Brussels Convention endangered the efficient working of Act j but precise information on this point is not available. Partici pants in trade. of the the Brussels The arms in the Masqat' market were now all breech-loaders, for muzzle-loaders had ceased to be saleable in either Arabia or Persia. »ome at were disposed of locally to tribesmen from the interior of Oman, some to visitors from other parts of the Gulf, and some to Nakbudas of coasting vessels; but the greater quantity were re-shipped to Trucial Bahrain, Qatar and Kuwait, or were smuggled into Persian and lurkish territory in the Gulf concealed in bales of goods and cases of Halwa or dry limes ; while a few were even despatched to minor ports m the Red bea at which there were no customs houses. * Or even more According to the statement of an ex-dealer, made later, the cort price of a rifle waTat tbis'time £3.10-0 to £4 ; the amount paid to the Governor on each was £2 ; and the selling price was £8 to ^1U. f Some of these were distinguished by a gilt lion and sun on the barrel. ■ ! i i 12560 The attention of the Government of India attracted by the trade in the Gulf, 1896-97, The importance to the Government of India of the arms trade in the Persian Gulf ; perceived at the time of the Afghan War, had for a time been forgotten. At the end of 1896, however, the military authorities in India became desirous of knowing the destination of the enormous quantities of military material which were now being poured into the Gulf, and local enquiries were set on foot which showed that about 60 per cent, of these imports found their final market in Persian territory, while about 25 per cent, were absorbed by the Turkish possessions in the Gulf and the remaining 15 per cent, by non-Turkish Arabia. In 1897 the Sultan of Masqat—on pretext of checking a trade dangerous to the stability of his government which had been severely shaken by a rebellion in 1895, but in reality only for the sake of increas ing his customs-revenue—proposed to enhance the duty on arms and ammunition imported at Masqat to a rate above that of the 5 per cent, fixed in his commercial treaties with European powers. The British Gov ernment, in view of the check which, however slight, the measure might have imposed on the arms trade, suggested to the Government of the French Eepublic that the treaties might be modified to admit of a duty of per cent, being taken on arms, but the proposal was not favourably received and was abandoned. The Sultan however, acting on his own initiative, soon afterwards raised the rate of duty to 6 per cent., at which figure it has since been maintained without protest on the part of the dealers or of any foreign government. Less than six months had elapsed after the investigation made at the instance of the Indian military authorities^ when the tribal risings of 1897 on the Indo-Afghan frontier suddenly brought the question of the Gulf arms trade into great prominence, and the theory was propounded that a part of the tribal armaments might have been derived from the Persian Gulf. It was decided, however, without waiting for definite proofs that the frontier of India was affected, to take measures against the illicit trade in arms between England and Persia,—an evil in itself of no slight magnitude. Attack by the British Government on the illegal trade in arms, 1897-98. To this end the Persian Government were moved through the Hon'ble C. Hardinge, then British Charge d^Affaires at Tehran, to take steps for enforcing the actual law and for confiscating the stores of arms which2661 had been illegally imported into Busliehr and were accumulated there. The British proposals were heartily welcomed by the Persian Government, themselves now thoroughly alarmed at the proportions which the trade had attained ; nor were their fears without justification. In the neighbourhood especially of Bushehr, no grown man any longer enjoyed social consideration or could obtain a wife who did not possess a rifle; the Bushehr-Shiraz road was frequently closed by the heavily armed tribes of Tangistan, who, if they had been united among them selves, might even have been able at this time to capture the town of Hushehr; and in fact, as aptly remarked by a Persian, ' Martini Khan v was now Shah of the south of Persia. On the 11th of December the Persian Government announced that orders had been given for the confiscations to take place, and on the 15th of December they went so far as to agree that all mercantile vessels trading in the Persian Gulf under their flag might be searched for arms and ammunition by British men-of-war, any contra band found on board being handed over to themselves. They also associat ed themselves with the British Government in a request to the Sultan of 'Oman that he would warn his subjects of the illegality of exporting arms to Persia, and would authorise British war-vessels to search British, Persian and ^Omani vessels in his territorial waters, and to seize and confiscate the cargoes of arms owned by British, Persian or 'Omani subjects which might be found on board, if destined for illicit importa tion into Persia. In pursuance of the Anglo-Persian understanding the Sultan of ; Oman was approached by Colonel M. J. Meade, then Political Resi dent in the Persian Gulf, and the adherence of the Masqat Government to the arrangements was secured ; not however without difficulty, for the Sultan apprehended that interference with the arms trade would result in a diminution of his customs revenue. A notification and proclama tion in the sense required, applying equally to British, to Persian and to 'Omani subjects and vessels, were issued by the Sultan on the 13th of January 1898. At Bushehr the Persian Government had appointed the Malik-ut- Tniiar a former governor of the port, to be preventive officer, on the curious condition that one-third of the arms confiscated by hus instrn- mentality should be given him as a reward; and on the 7 th ot December operations commenced with the seizure of 150 rifles and 149,000 cartridges belonging to Messrs. Fracis, Times &amp; Co Searches continued to he made intermittently at Bushehr until March 1898 and resulted in the seizure, altogether, of some 5,339 rifles and 1,241,253 rounds of ammunition, a small proportion of which were subsequently restored as having been landed at Bushehr by mistake, or as belonging to other than British or Persian subjects. Of the arms seized, 4,000 rifles and 933,294 cartridges, mostly belonging to Messrs. Fracis, Times &amp; Co were the property of firms under British protection ; the remainder mostly belonged to Persian merchants. There was some excitement' at Bushehr during the seizures, and, although the losses fell chiefly on ^reign sub^ts, a certain risk of popular disturbances was incurred The confiscated arms were sent by caravan to Tehran m Apn an une • was at first feared that in Persia the arms trade, after it had been considered impossible for the firms under British protection, would be r 171 Preliminarj arrangements in 'Oman. Seizure of arms at Bushehr by the Persian Government.2562 I Seizure of the « Balu chistan 'in 'Oman waters by H. M. S. ' Lapwing January permitted to continue in the hands of Persian subjects and foreigners of non-British nationality j but the Sbah issued an autograph, order enjoining strict enforcement of the law against all nationalities alike, and this order seems to have been obeyed with an exactitude unusual in Persia. At Masqat, action was taken with even more striking success. The ' Baluchistan a vessel of 2,409 tons gross tonnage belono-ing to Messrs. F. C. Strick &amp; Co. (the Anglo-Arabian and Persian S. S. Co.) of London, which had left Europe towards the end of 1897, was known to have on board a heavy cargo of arms and ammunition, partly consigned to Persian ports ; and preparations were accordingly made for searching her in the territorial waters of 'Oman under the Sultan's pro clamation of 13th January 1898. The a Baulchistan ^ was stopped outside Masqat harbour, on the morning of the 24th of January 1898, by H. M. S. 'Lawping', Commander Carr. The destination of the arms and ammunition originally intended for Persian ports had been altered in the course of the voyage to ' Masqat ; but this was not considered to affect their liability to seizure, and they were accordingly landed, to the number of 7,856 rifles and 700,000 rounds of ammu nition, and deposited in the British Consulate. An unforeseen difficulty occurred through the refusal of the Sultan to convene a court to try the seizure, though made under his own authority in his own territorial waters, and he at first appeared anxious to throw the entire responsibility on the British Government; but his! objections were in the end overcome, and the court w r hich he appointed arrived without difficulty at the satisfactory conclusion that the arms and ammunition seized were intended for Persian ports, that the change of destination upon tihe voyage conferred no immunity from seizure, and that the seizure was in accordance with the Sultan's proclamation of the 13th January 1898 and was consequently legal in every respect. The arms and ammunition taken remained in deposit at the British Consulate until the spring of 1900, when, all legal actions arising out of the matter having been decided, they were made over to the Sultan. By this time the rifles had suffered much from neglect, and their value was estimated not to exceed Rs. 25 apiece; but the concession of a claim on which he had laid much stress, and which at first had been treated by the Government of India as doubtful, gave great satisfaction to the Sultan. Seizure of arms belonging to Messrs. Fracis, Times and by the Shaikh of Bahrain, 1898. Co. The growth of a secondary arms depot in Bahrain has already been mentioned ; and, shortly after the seizures of arms at Bushehr and Masqat, an important confiscation took place there under the orders of the Shaikh, m circumstances which it is now necessary to explain.^4 2563 In 1895, when an attack on Bahrain by Arabs of the mainland was threatened^ there were not a hundred rifles in the principality, and the weakness of his position was forcibly brought home to the ruler of the islands. On the 21st of January 1896 the Shaikh issued an ambigu ous proclamation, forbidding the importation of firearms into Bahrain under penalty of a fine (or special customs duty) equal to one-fourth the value of the arms ; but, immediately afterwards, he granted a special ex emption or monopoly in favour of his Wazir 'Abdur Hahman-bin- 'Abdul Wahhab. This concession was for the life of the grantee and W included a special stipulation that arms should not be sold to inhabit- P ants of Bahrain, Qatar, or the Arab coast except the coast of ' Oman; but iit 1 its principal provision was one designed to secure a supply of arms to the Shaikh, by which the concessionaire undertook to pay an annual royalty of 30 Martini rifles and 6,000 cartridges in addition to customs duty in kind at the rate of three rifles in every hundred and 200 cartridges per rifle. The Wazir without delay transferred his concession to Agha Muham mad Rahim, a respectable Arab merchant who was also political repre sentative of the British Government in the islands ; and he in his turn, on certain conditions as to division of profits, passed it on to the now entirely Parsi firm of Fracis, Times &amp; Co., a house of doubtful reputation, whose profits from the Gulf arms trade were supposed to have amounted by the middle of 1897 to not less than £40,000. This firm, as already mentioned, had established their first agency in the Gulf at Bushehr in 1887, and one of the partners took up his residence at that place in 1891; in 1895 they opened an agency under Agha Mu hammad Rahim in Bahrain, and in 1896 another under Damodar Dhar- amsi at Masqat. In July 1896, after the creation of the Bahrain mono poly, Messrs. Fracis, Times &amp; Co. sought to obtain a letter of recom mendation from the British Resident at Bushehr to the Shaikh of Bahrain ; bui - as they failed to give an assurance^ that they would refrain from the traffic in arms, the British Residency withheld its good offices. Want of official countenance, however, did not deter the firm from establishing a business ; and, under the concession obtained by them, the jaiiuarms trade at Bahrain increased with phenomenal rapidity, the value of the jessionof' imports rising trom Rs. x4,850 m 1894-95 and Rs. 95,400 in 1S95- Ibeen^ 96 to Rs. 1,42,880 in 1896-97 and Rs. 4,67,790 in _ 1897-98. tigWi 1 On several occasions shipments were made from Bahrain to Bushehr and even to Masqat ; but the majority of the arms disposed, of at Bahrain were sold to visitors from Bandar ' Abbas, Lingeh, Tahiri, Kangun, Bushehr and Muhammareh on the Persian side of the Gulf, to purchasers from Kuwait, Najd, and ' Oman on the Arabian side, and even, m defi ance of the terms of the concession, to natives of Bahrain and Qatar. Til# A p r ii X897, the Shaikh became alarmed at the growth of the trade I and the Wazir intimated to Agha Muhammad Rahim that operations must be discontinued for four months. A little later a rupture occurred between Agha Muhammad Eahim and Messrs. Fraeis, Times &amp; Co. over J the division of profits ; and in January 1898 the Shaikh, either m co n- # « neotion with this dispute or because the concession was being mtnnged ibetrfl by the sale of arms in Bahrain, attached the whole stock of the firm, &gt;rso^ amounting' to 3,667 rifles and 637,500 cartridges. His action 171 A Monopoly of the arms trade estab lished in Bahrain, 1896. Large business established by Fracis, Times &amp; Co.^ 1895- 98. Confiscation of their stock by the Shaikh, 1898.2564 was not in any way prompfced by the Britisli authorities, but it may have been instigated by Agha Muhammad Eahim ; who, besides having private claims against Messrs. Fracis, Times and Co., had recently become aware that the British Government, whom he represented, viewed the traffic with disfavour. Colonel Meade, the British Political Resident at Bushehr, arrived in Bahrain on the 4th of February 1898, and partially examined the arms seized ; but he declined to intervene in the matter, either by taking charge of the arms, as suggested by the Shaikh, or by pressing 1 for their release, as desired by Mr. Fracis—one of the partners—-who was then pre sent on the spot. In September 1899 an attempt, noticed in the history of Bahrain, was made by a favourite of the Shaikh to tamper with the confiscated arms and gave rise, in consequence of an assault on Hindu British subjects which it involved, to some unpleasantness between the Shaikh and the British authorities ; but it did not in any way affect the general issue of the disposal of the arms. Eventually in April 1900, Agha Muhammad Rahim being then dead; the Shaikh became desirous of restoring the arms to Fracis, Times and Company, and on the 2nd of June 1906 they were handed back to the owners, in a much damaged condition, on the understanding that they should not be sold in Bahrain, or Qatar, or on the Arab Coast. Consternation among dealers and litigation fpllowing the seizure, of 1897-98. The seizures at Bushehr, Masqat and Bahrain made a profound sensa tion and excited much indignation and anxiety among the firms and traders in England, whose interests were involved. The Foreign Office in London was inundated with letters and besieged with representations from the manufacturers, exporters, ship-owners and underwriters, whose pockets had been touched in various ways. The nefarious business itself was even depicted in moving terms as an a honest trade, carried on for nearly twenty years, and now threatened with extinction by the action of the British Government.^ Legal proceedings against Government officers followed. Messrs. Fraeis&gt; Times &amp; Co. brought a suit against Commander Carr of the Lapwing'^ for the value of their arms seized on the a Baluchistan ^ and they instituted another against Colonel Meade with reference to the confisca tions at Bushehr and Bahrain, for which, they alleged, he, and not the territorial authority, was responsible. In both suits the defence was undertaken by the Treasury, and the final result in each case was favour able to the defendants and to Government. In the suit against Commander Carr it was finally ruled by the House of Lords on the 8th of July 1901 that a British jury could not go behind the decision of the Masqat court, which had held that the munitions seized were intended for Persia, that not ling had been done contrary to the law of Masqat, and that the seizme was legal. In Colonel Meade's case judgment was given for the2565 defendant on the 22nd of May 1901 in the court of Mr. Justice Bigham from whom Colonel Meade received hig-h credit for having ' acted not only with great discretion and ability, but also with the strictest regard to the requirements of the law/ ; By these proceedings Messrs. Fracis, Times &amp; Co. were reduced to bankruptcy ; and a salutary but temporary check was inflicted on the arms and ammunition traffic in the Gulf. Part at least of the losses fell upon underwriters in London ; and their efforts to obtain indemnification did not cease until 1906, when their claims were finally rejected by a Liberal, as they had been previously by a Conservative Government. Partial repression of the trade^ notwitlistanding various obstacles, 1898-1905. We now proceed to describe the course of the arms and ammunition traffic, subsequently to the seizures of 1897-1898, in the various districts of the Gulf. The attitude of the British Government was, during the period 1898 to 1905, one of vigilant attention, without the power to intervene directly or effectually. By a notification under the Arms Act, dated 13th April 1900, the TransMp- Government of India prohibited the consignment of arms and am muni- p ers j an q u i £ tion to the Persian Gulf through Indian ports without transhipment, p ro hibited at transhipment having been already made illegal in 1880 ; but the effect of Indian ports, the prohibition was small, inasmuch as the bulk of the trathc was already 1900. carried by vessels running direct between Europe and the Gulf, and there was no reason why the whole of it should not be so carried. A new measure of repression was adopted by Her Majesty's Gov- Arms ernment in 1900, viz., the Arms Exportation Act, ' passed in that ^ x P 0r ^ tl011 year, which empowered the Sovereign to prohibit hy proclamation the export of arms and ammunition from the United Kingdom to countries or places where they might be employed against British tioops or subjects. It has since, however, been ruled by the Admiralty that British war-ships have no general power to search even British vessels for arms on the high seas, and that they may only take action m British territorial waters in virtue of special regulations, or m the territorial waters of Persia and 'Oman in virtue of the agreements formed with those countries in 1897 and 1898 ; thus the role of the British Navy m connection with the traffic is now somewhat closely restricted. The trade at Masqat, 1898-1905. At Masqat the importation of arms and ammunition continued to Establish- be legal ; and the trade in arms and ammunition at this port, as ment of2566 French and Russian arms dealers at Masqat. Growth of the trade. Loss of British Government ammunition. Impossibility of interna tional action. To the leading Indian traders^ his operations would be exempt will be seen from Annexure No. 1 at the end of the present Appendix, soon recovered from the depression into which it had been thrown by the seizures of 1897-1898. In March 1899 M. Goguyer, a French merchant of whom mention will be found in the recent history of the ''Oman Sultanate, established himself at Masqat with a European assistant, and began to deal in arms, whom he interviewed, he explained that from British interference^ as he would export arms purchased from him in native vessels flying the French flag. In May 1899 M. Goguyer proceeded on a voyage to Bahrain, which, although the trade had been interdicted there, was doubtless connected with the extension of his business. In 1901^ the trade of M. Goguyer, at the outset retarded by his want of capital, began to increase rapidly ; and in 1903 the Odessa firm of Messrs. Keverkoff &amp; Co., and in 1905 the Jibuti house of Messrs. Baijeot &amp; Co., were added to the list of arms-dealers at Masqat. When the trade began at Masqat the arms and ammunition imported, though a proportion were of Belgian manufacture, were exclusively of British provenance ; but in 1899-1900 about one-seventh of the imports were from France^ and by 1905 the proportion of French arms had risen to four-tenths. During the five months ending on the 31st ol October 1899 no less than 3,79 ^2 rifles were sold at Masqat by British subjects alone. An inquiry held in the same year showed that, of the arms and ammunition brought into Masqat, only about 5 per cent, now remained in the Sulta nate of 'Oman, while 40 per cent, were forwarded to Trucial ^Oman and Kuwait, and 55 per cent, to the ports of Persia, especially Ma^shur, Hindiyan, Lingeh and Bandar 'Abbas, in the proportion of 20 per cent, to Bandar 'Abbas and 35 per cent, to the other ports named. During the first six months of 1902 the total number of rifles that paid import duty at Masqat was 8,732 and of cartridges 726,110 ; and there is reason to believe that in the year 1904-1905 the number of rifles imported was not less than 20,000. It may be mentioned in passing that in 1898 a leakage of ammuni tion from Her Majesty's ships was detected at Masqat, where 3,800 rounds of Martini-Henry and 100 rounds of Lee-Metford ammunition were recovered, chiefly from the bazaar. The offence was traced to a native interpreter, who was dismissed the service. A proposal was pressed by the Government of India in 1902-1903 that France, the United States, and Holland should be approached with a view to the modification of the commercial treaties by which the Sultan of 'Oman was restrained from prohibiting the traffic, and they under took to pay reasonable compensation to that ruler for any diminution which might ensue in his customs revenue ; but^ in view r of the un- propitious relations of France and Britain in regard to the 'Oman Sultanate, where the French flag question was still a cause of friction, no such action was considered possible by His Majesty's Government. Measures at Masqat were accordingly restricted to impeding by all possible means the export of arms to countries where their introduction was unlawful,— a category in which were included, by the end of 1902, not only India, Persia and the Turkish dominions in the Gulf, but also the states of Tmcial 'Oman, the principalities of Bahrain and Kuwait, and ai fyalldeI f4f« 2567 ^ fei i 'f/ 1 hIb to)' t# measures at Masqat. British and Italian Somaliland; in other words, the contest resolved itself into a crusade against smuggling from Masqat to all neighbouring countries. It was at first thought that, if some degree of supervision were main- Counteractive tained at Masqat, the effect might be to retard the growth of the trade ; and on the 24th of September 1898 a notification was issued by the British Consul under the Masqat Order in Council, requiring British sub jects to give information regarding arms or ammunition obtained or dis posed of by them. In January 1900 the Sultan was induced to adopt a similar policy, and to supply the British Consulate with a weekly return of the transactions of the principal 'Omani arms-merchants ; but the trade of foreigners necessarily remained unregistered, and the registration of British and Arab merchants' transactions was soon found to afford no practical advantage, while it rather hampered them in competition with their rivals. Exportation in detail was carried on by native boats ; and in 1899 it was reported that hardly a vessel left the harbour which did not carry arms for places abroad. In order to enable the preventive authorities, both in the 'Oman Sultanate and elsewhere, to discriminate between con signments lawfully exported to other places in 'Oman and illicit cargoes destined principally for Persia, the Sultan now insisted that permits should be taken out for removal from Masqat to other 'Oman ports. The result however was far from being satisfactory. The real arms port in Batinah was Masna'ah, whence a caravan-route runs to Bustaq and Nizwa in the interior ; but large numbers of permits were taken out for Sohar, and these were used merely to protect arms from seizure till they had reached the end of the Sultan's territory and could be carried over to Persia without danger of interception. Whenever Masqat harbour was left without a British man-of-war a general exodus followed of native craft carrying contraband arms. A few seizures were made of arms not covered by permits, perhaps the most important being that of a Kuwait Bam by H. M. S. a Sphinx' on the 1st of September 1898; this vessel was found to contain 56 Martini-Henry carbines and 5,596 cartridges, and the consignment was confiscated by the Sultan ; but the Nakhuda escaped punishment, as he was able to prove Turkish nationality. In August 1903 some captures of smugglers by the Persian preventive vessel a Muzaffari ' in Persian waters brought the trade to a temporary standstill, but the lull was of short duration. The question of the exportation of arms from the 'Oman Sultanate to the East Coast of Africa was revived by the Italian Government in con nection with the introduction of arms into Somaliland ; but the existence of a regular trade was no more clearly established than on the former occasion, and it seemed evident that the arms reaching Somaliland were nearly all derived from Jibuti. In 190S, however, one Masqat vessel was captured in Aden waters in the act of conveying arms and ammunition to the Somali Mulla. The Sultan of 'Oman at length, in deference to the wishes of the British and Italian Governments, issued a notification on the 17th of October 1903 prohibiting the export of arms and ammunition from his territories to the African coast and islands (including Soqotrah) under British protection and situated to the north of Cape Guardafui, as also Supposed exportation of arms from Masqat to Somaliland. Second interdict on exportation from 'Oman to Africa, 1903.2568 to the Italian possessions on the East Coast of Africa, conferring power on British and Italian war-vessels to search suspected 'Omani vessels on the high seas and in the territorial waters of ; Oman, and ^ conj denouncing the penalty of confiscation against offenders. A correspond- ® aor ^ ing notification was issued by the British Consul at Masqat to British ^ subjects. After t is were The trade in Trucial 'Oman, 1898-1907. Progress of the trade. Agreement for suppres sion of the trade, 1902. As shown by Annexure No. 1 at the end of this Appendix, the growth of the arms trade in Trucial ^Oman corresponded at first with its progress at Masqat, inasmuch as it attained its maximum in the years 1896-1898 ; but thereafter it showed symptoms of decline, due probably to the glutting of the local market and to the absence of communications with profitable markets in the interior. The chief depdt on the Trucia] coast was, in the beginning, at ; Ajman ; but, later, the trade became general and was carried on mostly at Dibai. In September 1902, 100 Martini-Henry rifles were imported at Sharjah, 120 at Dibai and 80 at Abu Dhabi ; and in the next month 100 were landed at Ras-al- Khaimah and 200 at Dibai. In 1902 the traffic, of which the Trucial Shaikhs had become some what apprehensive for personal reasons, was brought to an end by a joint Agreement concluded between the Shaikhs and the British Resident, Colonel C. A. Kemball, on the 24th, 25th and 26th of November 1902 and by a Notification which the Shaikhs at the same time issued, forbid ding the importation of arms and ammunition into their respective terri tories, as also exportation from the same. The intelligent chief of Dibai led the way in the matter. The text of the Trucial Shaikhs' Agree ment and Notification forms Annexure No. 2 to the present Appendix. The trade in Qatar and Bahrain, 1898-1905, Question of Qatar. Prohibition in Bahrain, 1898. The peculiar political situation of Qatar, one of the principal entrances by which arms and ammunition reach Southern Najd, was an insuperable obstacle to the institution of preventive measures in that promontory ; but in Bahrain, adjoining it, a satisfactory arrange ment followed close on the seizure of Messrs. Fracis, Times &amp; Co/s arms. During his visit to Bahrain, in February 1898, Colonel Meade had been able to persuade the Shaikh of the necessity for action ; and, on the 30th of April following, the Shaikh signed an Agreement with Britain and issued a Proclamation and Notification whereby importation and export ation of arms were rendered unlawful in Bahrain and made punishable by2569 confiscation, and British and Persian vessels of war were empowered to search Bahrain vessels in British, Persian or Bahrain territorial waters, and to confiscate arms and ammunition on board if intended for India, Persia or Bahrain. Annexure No. 3 to this Appendix contains the text of the Agreement, Proclamation and Notification. After this prohibition came into force small seizures of contraband arms were made from time to time by the Shaikh's officials. The trade at Kuwait, 1898-1905. The arms trade did not begin at Kuwait until after the accession of Beginning Shaikh Mubarak in 1896 ; it appears to have been prohibited by his of the trade, immediate predecessor from fear of the Turks. At Kuwait its develop ment was probably slower than elsewhere, for it did not attract notice until 1899, when it was reported that fairly large quantities of arms were passing from Masqat to Kuwait. A duty of was at this time levied on each rifle by the customs contractor of Kuwait port, and a further royalty of $4 apiece was taken by the Shaikh himself. Shortly after this, though arms continued to be imported in small Momjnal quantities only and not On a large scale, there were indications that Kuwait prohibition of was likely to succeed Bahrain as the principal arms mart of the upper 19 Q 0 same ' Persian Gulf. Measures were at once taken to prevent, if possible, such a result; and, on the ^th of May 1900, Colonel Kemball, the British Political Resident, was successful in persuading the Shaikh to execute an Agreement and to issue a Proclamation and Notification by which the trade was prohibited in Kuwait territory and powers of search and confiscation were conferred on British and Persian vessels of war, analogous to those secured from the Shaikh of Bahrain by the Agreemen of 1898 : the documents in question are reproduced in Annexure No. 4 to the present Appendix. Shaikh Mubarak entered into these arrangements with unexpected readiness ; but the circumstance that Kuwait boats then flew the Turkish flag made it inexpedient for British war-vessels to exercise their right of search ; British interference with the importation of arms at Kuwait was avoided also for the additional reasons that Ibn Sa'ud of Southern Najd drew his supply from this place, and that to cut it off would have been to influence materially the course^ of Centra Arabian affairs. It is probable that, with the exception of those received through Qatar, nearly the whole of the arms and ammunition imported into Najd for use in the wars of 1900-1904 were brought into the country through Kuwait, the remainder of the Kuwait ^P^ts bemg divided at this period in almost equal proportions between ^ ^urkii and the Persian dominions, into both of which they were smuggled. ^ In Februarv 1904 the ubiquitous M. Goguyer paid a visit to Kuwait, Continued where he remafned for some time, practically as the guest of the Shaikh^; t ami shortly afterwards the rate of xmportaUon became ve y rap ^ JL Goffuver's consignments being introduced, it was said, as the bhaikh s private property^ In the first week of August 1904, 12 cases of arms2570 were landed at Kuwait; about the 18th of the month 29 cases arrived and were placed in the Shaikh's godowns; and at the end of August 800 rifles were imported^ chiefly for sale in Persia. At the beginning of 1905 it was estimated that importation was proceeding at the rate of about 1^000 rifles a month^ of which about five-twelfths were received by steamer and seven-twelfths by native vessels^ and that the Shaikh was deriving an annual income of $50,000 from the trade which he had undertaken to suppress. Shaikh Mubarak^ who at the time of the Agreement of 1900 had minimised the actual importance of the trade in terms that were considered suspicious, now denied its existence altogether; while M. Goguyer, on the other hand, asserted that he held written authority from the Shaikh to import arms into Kuwait, with which port he now appeared to transact most of his business. In fact, except as regards importation by British vessels, the position at Kuwait in 1905 was hardly more satisfactory than at Masqat. The trade in the Turkish dominions, 1898-1907. Of the history of the arms and ammunition trade in Turkish territory, including Hasa, very little is known; but importation is prohibited, there at least in name. At the beginning of 1901 a consign ment of 250 rifles and 12,000 cartridges, said to be of English manu facture, were brought to Basrah, having been seized, it was stated, by the Turkish gunboat ' Zuhaf ^ on board a Persian sailing vessel near the coast of Qatar; these arms were said to have been intended for Shaikh Jasim-bin-Thani, who protested vigorously against their seizure. In 1904 and 1905 rifles were reaching Turkish ; lraq both vzd Kuwait and from Persian territory; and occasional small seizures were made in the Basrah Wilayat. The lurks seem to have done nothing to facilitate the obtaining of rifles and ammunition from the Gulf by Ibn Rashid of Jabal Shammar, their nominal representative in Central Arabia, during the war in Central Arabia. The trade on the Persian Coast, 1898-1905. Continuance In Persia, in the provinces of 'Arabistan and Fars and in the Gulf of the trade. Ports, the importation of arms and ammunition seems to have con tinued virtually unchecked until the institution of the Persian Imperial Customs at Bushehr in March 1900; and, even then, the firms impli cated were slow to give up the hope of continuing their operations by indirect means. In 1900, an Armenian dealer at Bushehr still un dertook to dispose of 5,000 rifles annually for a Belgian firm in -Europe, provided they were suitable for the Persian market and could be c e ivered at Masqat. Soon after the inauguration of the Imperialjf a 2571 Customs, however, the trade was in a great measure suppressed at Bushehr and at some of the other principal ports ; the control^ of it, however, at less accessible points and upon the unwatched coast-line was attended by difficulties which could not be surmounted. In 1900 the traffic was brisk at the northern ports of Ma'shur, Persian Dilam and Rig. Even at Bushehr indications of continued smuggling coast north still came to light from time to time, in November 1900 the British firm of A. and T. J. Malcolm &amp; Co. was found to be in possession of 380 Martini-Henry rifles and 183,000 rounds of ammunition, which were conHseated by the Persian authorities ; and, at the end of January 1904, on the information of herd-boys who had seen some Afghans dig ging, 80 Martini-Henry rifles were discovered buried in the sand near the quarantine station at Bushehr. Small captures at ontlying places were frequent, but large quantities of arms were successfully imported ; thus it is known that, at the middle of May 1903, a consignment of 400 Martini-Henry rifles from Masqat was disembarked at Hasineh near Lingeh and scattered broadcast over Shibkuh, Lar and even the Shiraz district, and that many similar shipments had before_ this reached Lar through the Shibkuh ports. Some trade in arms continued at Lmgeh, but it was of a restricted and local nature. At Bandar'Abbas the arms trade, already in full swing in 1897, was Persian but little disturbed by the seizures of 1897-1898. From 1898 onwards coa.t south of contraband arms and ammunition for the Bandar 'Abbas market ceased L,n ^ h ' to be carried by steamer, unless to a limited extent as passengers lug gage, or even to enter the town of Bandar 'Abbas ; but the merchants engaged in the business, among whom was one Hindu British subject, continued to have their headquarters m the town. After 1898 the arm imported from Masqat into this ne^hbourhood weremoBUylanded at uninhabited places upon the coast, especially in Khur Mmah and unt 1 the effectual extension of the Imperial Customs regunc to tWeg on the town of Khamir and the islands of Qishm, Hanjam, Larak a d Hormuz were regular depots of the trade. As lately as January 1904 a cache of three camel loads of Snider ammunition was discovered in a sand hill near the Bandar 'Abbas quarantine station, and was captured by Customs guards, after exchanging some shots w th a gang Afghans The establishment of a British Vice-Consulate at JJandar 'AbSs in February 1900 had for one of its motives the suppression, by tff Sn Government and holding them *o ^ of the arms trade between that region and the countries to the west ot t /-i 1 • W 1 Wn done by the Imperial Persian Customs Activity of Some good service had been a y ^ -pn r g an( i the the Persian in checking the importation of arms and ammunition into iars and tn Vn -tf hut in 1904, a year in which an unaccountable spirit of in ' 1 'i denartroent, their activity in this respect meddlesomeness P 0SB ' , 0 d ] n Mav 1904 the Director-General was pushed ^^Per boun • t0 ' 00EfiBca te all arms found on of CustomB at BuBhehrclamed g ^ (iestination . and an att e m pt. board ship m Persian waters « Arab ggell rs from Masqat to the .&lt; .he2572 al-'Arab which were of doubtful legality * provoked much resentment at Kuwait, and led to a British protest.

Finally^ in ^ ^ January 1905, the Bushehr Customs would have confiscated, on board a 8661186 British ship, the military arms of a party of three Turkish officers and i 011 ^ twelve Turkish soldiers belonging to the Hasa garrison, who were ^ ^ returning to headquarters at Basrah ; but the British Eesident was able *6; ti to transfer the Turks with their arms to a mail steamer for Basrah, under ^ the protection of a British military guard. The British Minister at ittorise Tehran was privately willing to concede that arms carried as cargo but not iincreai entered in a ship^s manifest, as well as arms declared to be personal icontrolk baggage but excessive in number, might be seized in Persian ports on ktini-He suspicion of being intended for Persia ; but he firmly resisted the claim %alon( to seize arms consigned to non-Persian ports, and he considered that even mses of to place such arms under seal while in Persian waters was a vexatious us of cart and unnecessary precaution. itration The trade in Makran,, 1898-1905. into ii India, Institution The arms and ammunition trade in Persian and British Makran . of theTrad notwitllstallL( i iQ g' t ^ e proximity of the Makran coast to the Masqat iUthouo # market, of somewhat tardy development. The Persian expedition of ?ioii Wag b 1897-98 against the Karwanis, described in the history of Persian iieiyi n ^ Makran, showed that modern rifles were at that time scarce in the leernedt] country ; but immediately after, or even during the operations^ a more or mi . less brisk traffic seems to have sprung up. In February 1898 twenty ?0 packets of Martini-Henry ammunition were found in the house of a ^ headman of Pasni in British Makran, and, in the same month, three ■ een . c Pathans in possession of a Martini-Henry carbine were arrested at Ormarah in the same district j the offenders in the second case proved to ^ be Powindas of the Dera Ismail Khan District in the North-West ? rs of Frontier Province of India, who, after making a pilgrimage to Baghdad, had purchased twenty rifles at Masqat and, in attempting to carry them j upcountry, had been robbed of all but one by Nausherwanis of Kolwa. ^ At the end of 1901 the number of rifles in Persian Makran was found ^ of to have increased to a surprising^ extent; some of the chiefs possessed ^ k Lee-Metfords; and, about this time, a consignment of twenty rifles and i^^aiu ten boxes of ammunition destined for the chiefs of Gaih and Qasrkand was seen in transit between the port of Tank and the interior.

Some Afghan refugees settled at Bahu Qalat in Persian Makran were now engaged in a regular trade in arms ; and another Afghan arms-dealer, besides whom there were believed to be many otherSj had established himself at Dizak in Persian Makran. The Persian authorities in the interior were at length awakened ineffectual to a sense of the danger from the traffic to their own administration; Anglo-Per- and, on the 8th of March 1902, the Farman-Farma, Governor- Bian arrange- General of Kirman, entered into an agreement with Major H. L. Showers, the British Political Agent at Kalat, to prevent, within his J902. ' own jurisdiction, the importation of arms and their possession by unauthorised persons. Arms continued nevertheless to be introduced, with increasing rapidity, at the small ports in Persian Makran, as yet uncontrolled by the Persian Imperial Customs. In 1904 about 1,500 Martini-Henry rifles from Masqat were believed to have been landed at Galag alone ; and, on the 30th of January 1905, some 800 rifles with six cases of cartridges, and, on the 10th of February, 700 rifles and five cases of cartridges, were brought ashore at the same place. Filtration of arms and ammunition from the Persian Gulf into Afghanistan, and towards the North-West Frontier of India, 1898-1905. Although the importation of arms and ammunition into the Gulf region was a grave matter, even from a purely local standpoint, it was chiefly in its relation to Afghan and frontier problems that the traffic concerned the British Government and the Government of India. The idea that the Persian Gulf was already, or might shortly become, Early coujec- a source of military supply to the Indian frontier tribes^appears to tures, 1897. have been originated by Mr. Lee-^arner in the India Office in London. An investigation of this theory, commenced by Colonel Meade ^ in the Persian Gulf in October 1897, was discontinued to avoid alarming the owners of the contraband shipments of which the seizure was then contemplated, but not before it had been demonstrated that large consignments of arms and ammunition were being despatched from Masqat through Bandar 'Abbas to unknown destinations inland. At the end of October 1897 Captain P. M. Sykes, British Consul for Kirman, left England with special instructions from the India Office to ascertain whether the suspected trade in arms^ between the GruK and the North-West Frontier of India really existed, and, should such be the case, how it was carried on. From Captain Sykes' inquiries it appeared probable that there was a considerable trade m arms from the Bandar 'Abbas district to Afghanistan, and possibly to the Indian frontier ; but conclusive evidence concerning the suspected trade was still wan ting: and an examination in India of the arms surrendered by the frontier tribes in 1897 and 1898 yielded negative results.

Kynoch and the Societe Cartoucherie Beige, which may have been imported from the Persian Gulf. At length, at the end of November 1898, a Martini-Henry rifle marked a Fracis, Times and Company, 27 Leadenhall Street, London'^, was purchased from a Ghilzai trader in Kurram by Captain G. O. Roos-Keppel, Political Officer of the valley, who reported that the Ghilzais had that season brought rifles for sale in unusually large numbers, and that almost any number of trade rifles corresponding to this and to another specimen obtained by him were available in the neighbourhood. Four other trade rifles of different patterns were subsequently bought by Captain Roos-Keppel in Kurram, which it did not appear could have reached the frontier from the Indian side. In 1901, in the course of the Mahsud blockade, overwhelming evidence was received of the arrival in Waziristan of Persian Gulf arms and ammunition in large quantities. A cartridge case dropped by a Mahsud raiding gang between Girni and Sarwekai in the summer of 1901 bore the letters F. T. C.and a double-headed eagle, the device of Messrs. Fracis, Times and Company* ; large quantities of similar cartridges were found shortly after in the belts of the Darwesh Khel Wazirs of Wana ; and the Political Officer of Southern Waziristan reported his ability to purchase Messrs. Fracis, Times and Company's cartridges locally at the rate of 5,000 a week. On the dead body of Jan Khan, son of the chief Mahsu Malik, killed in action towards the end of 1901, was found a revolver with the stamp ' Made for Fracis, Times and Company, London. ' During the winter of 1901-1902, the Powindas migrating into India by the Gumal route deposited, among others, 31 rifles which appeared to be of Persian Gulf origin in the armoury at Tank, Dera Ismail Khan. In short, it was clearly proved that arms and ammunition from the Gulf had begun to reach the Indian frontier ; and the observations in Southern Waziristan in 1901 showed that the importations were becoming extensive. The Indo-Afghan border trade was for a time restricted by the strong demand for rifles, and by the high prices obtained for them in districts nearer to the Gulf ; but, once the intervening markets had been glutted, the frontier market, in which rifles bought at Masqat for Rs. 40 or Rs. 50 sold for more than Rs. 300 each, began to secure an increasing share of the Gulf imports. This change seems to have come about gradually, and cannot be assigned to any particular year. It is uncertain by what routes the rifles and cartridges from the Persian Gulf first found their way northwards and eastwards to the frontier of India; and it seems clear that the trade was not, originally, in any sense a direct one. The disorders that prevailed in Makran during 1897 and in sub sequent years may have blocked, for a time, the most direct avenue from Masqat towards the Indian borderland; and the mishap in 1898 to a Pathan arms caravan travelling northwards from Ormarah, of which mention *By a peculiar coincidence this cartridge case was obtained and forwarded to Gov ernment by the present writer, who was then Political Officer in Southern W azirist^n.has been made above, had probably a salutary effect in deterring adven turers from experiments in that quarter. In 1898 it was stated by headmen of the Wazirs that most of the Gulf rifles in the possession of their tribe—for even at that date there were some, thoug-h they had not as yet been identified by the local officers —were such as, drifting northwards from hand to hand, had reached the Helmand valley in Afghanistan, and had been brought thence by Powinda traders to Waziristan : they added that attempts had been made to bring arms by direct caravan, meaning probably from the Makran coast, but had failed. Up to the beginning of 1898 the Afghan traders in arms seem to Growth of an have resorted freely to Masqat and to have made their purchases in person ; but, during the next few years, their orders were placed for the Bandar most part with agents at Bandar Abbas. Some of these Afghans habi- 'Abbas 1898. tually travelled to Bandar J Abbas by steamer from Karachi, at the time of the annual spring migration of the Powindas from British to Afghan territory, while others were accustomed to proceed thither in the autumn months with large caravans of camels from the neighbourhood of Ghazni—a custom of ancient standing, dependent on considerations of general trade, but one which at this time lent itself to the develop ment of the arms traffic. The leading spirit among the Afghans who went to Bandar ^Abbas by land bringing their transport with them was, at first, one Nur-ud-Din Khan, Lohani ; but, by 1903, the chief place bad been taken by a certain Ghulam Khan, Nasir. The success of the Afghans stimulated the Balfichis of the Khanu neighbourhood in Rudbar to compete, and in 1903 the latter had. secured a considerable share of the traffic. The arms ordered from Masqat by the Afghan and Baluchi dealers were mostly smuggled in sailing craft to lonely places on the coast near Bandar 'Abbas and Minab, where they were picked up by the purchasers, and on the journey inland they were carried concealed in camel-litters and in the framework of camel-saddles. The bulk of the Afghan trade seems at this period to have passed Direction across the Narmashir district to the east of Bam ; and, up to 1901, a very ^ J' ' e northerly route into Afghanistan by Sistan and Mashhad appears to have BaIldar been in favour. In the summer of that year, 26 rifles and a large quan- 'Abbas, tity of ammunition were captured through the efforts of Colonel G. F. Chenevix-Trench, then British Consul-General at Mashhad, from a single Afghan caravan, Ghulam Khan, the dealer, being arrested and sentenced to imprisonment in this case by the Consul-General ; this inci dent, which made a great stir among the Afghan community at Mashhad, was probably one cause among others of the trade subsequently adopting a more southerly course. At the end of 1901, as indicated in an earlier paragraph, there were Approaching symptoms of the opening out of new channels through Makran, and transference about this time two natives of Swat were seen at Sarbaz in Persian of the trade Baluchistan, whither they had come in quest of rifles. But it did not ' appear that the westerly route through Narmashir had as jet been superseded. f f M li2576 General course of the trade in the Persian Gulf proper, 1905-1907. Trucial Oman. Qatar. Bahrain. From 1905 to 1907 the traffic in arms and ammunition continued and even increased, but it no longer followed tlie same lines as in the beginning. To its progress in the Sultanate of ''Oman and in Persian Makran, the two countries now chiefly in question, we shall return later on, recording first only such facts connected with the trade as belong to the region of the Persian Gulf Proper. In Trucial ^Oman the traffic apparently continued at a standstill, notwithstanding a visit paid by M. Goguyer, the French arms-dealer at Masqat, to Dibai and Umm-al-Qaiwain in December 1905 and January 1906. This state of affairs may have been due partly to the observance of their engagements by the Trucial Chiefs ; but the absence both of further local demand and of facilities for exportation to the interior were probably factors of greater value. In Qatar, towards the end of 1906, a flourishing trade was known to exist at Dohah, where it was estimated that about 2,000 rifles per month were received from Masqat, entirely by native sailing boat. Several Shaikhs of the influential a1 Thani family were interested in the traffic, and six Arab merchants of substance were engaged in it; the price of a rifle was here higher by Rs. 15 than at Masqat, and a duty of Rs. 8-8-0 was paid to the Shaikh of Dohah by the professional dealers on account of every weapon imported. Most of the arms and ammunition sold in Qatar were still destined for the Central Arabian market; but about a quarter of the whole was now exported to Bahrain for sale to Persians. In a memorial which the Shaikh of Bahrain submitted in October 1905 to the Government of India and to the British Government, he complained that he had been compelled to interdict, to his own loss, the sale of arms in his territories ; but in reply he was reminded that he had himself shown signs of alarm at the growth of the trade in 1895 and 1898, and that his prohibition of it in the latter year had been voluntary. In November 1906 it transpired, partly in consequence of information given by M. Heynssens, Director-General of Customs at Bushehr, to Major Cox, the British Political Resident, that Bahrain was being utilised as a depot for the export of arms to Persia, part of tbe material being brought secretly by steamer from Masqat and a larger quantity shipped over from Qatar in native sailing vessels ; in this manner the Persian purchasers and the Qatari vendors, who did not willingly visit each others' ports, were brought into correspondence. A secret association including among its members some influential persons in the entourage of the Shaikh of Bahrain, existed for the exploitation of this business; it was ascertained that the Shaikh's son Hamad was in their pay ; and the Shaikh himself, who may even have been an interested party, was at the best an apathetic spectator. By the activity of the British Political Agent in searching steamers the direct import from2577 172 J-8f of inform^ em ufciii antif 601 Masqat was virtually stopped ; but the indifference or covert opposition of the Shaikh prevented the application of any effectual check to the trade between Qatar and the coast villages of Bahrain. Early in 1907 an allegation that British steamers were being utilised by persons engaged in the arms trade with Bahrain and Kuwait was brought by the Secretary of State for India to the notice of the head office of the British India Steam Navigation Company, and an imme diate inquiry into the matter was undertaken by the latter. A very brisk despatch of arms and ammunition from Masqat to Kuwait Kuwait, partly by steamer and partly by native boat ; was carried on during the period under consideration, notwithstanding the agreement signed by the Shaikh in 1900. In December 1905 the Russian steamer a Trouvor ^ landed 25 cases of arms at the port; in the same month a consignment; estimated at 3^000 rifles with ammunition, was discharged there by 2 Bums from Masqat; and in February 1906 the arrival by sea at Kuwait of 4,500 rifles and 1,500 cases of ammunition was reported. In these circumstances His Majesty^s Government, after consulting the British Ambassador at Constantinople, who regarded the free import of arms at Knwait as open to misconstruction by the Turks, authorised a remonstrance with the Shaikh on the subject of the trade. The ques tion was accordingly broached to him by Captain S. G. Knox, the Polit ical Agent, in April 1906 ; but the Shaikh took the rebuke in bad part, denied the existence of any considerable trade, and showed such unmis- takeable signs of displeasure that it was considered inexpedient, in view of the political importance of his friendship, to press further for a strict observance of the prohibition of 1900. There was a slight lull in the trade at Kuwait during the progress of this incident; but, by the month of September 1906, it was once more in full vigour. On the Persian side of the Persian Gulf something had already been p er sian effected by the Imperial Persian Customs towards the suppression of Coast, the trade at the principal ports ; but, in most cases, this merely signified a diversion into new and more obscure channels. On more than one occasion attempts made by Customs officers to take action^ at a distance from their own headquarters, against smugglers of arms ended in igno minious failure. By August 1905 it was reported the arms trade had been extin guished on the coast between Minab and Lingeh ; but the state ment was at least premature, for, in March 1907, a heavy consign ment of contraband goods was landed in Clarence Strait by a sailing vessel from Masqat which eluded a Customs launch sent to capture her, and on shore the smugglers, who had with them about 80 camels and were fully armed, handled the Customs guards of the Gachin post severely on their attempting to interfere, afterwards disappearing in the direc tion of Lar. Even in the neighbourhood of Bushehr itself the state of affairs was hardly better. In October 1906 a boat from Masqat, chartered by the Shaikh of Chah Kutah and others and supposed to contain 1,200 Martini- Henry rifles and 10,000 cartridges, reached Bulkhair and successfully2578 discharged her cargo near that place, notwithstanding that the Customs steamer a Muzaffari^ was in the neighbourhood and that a Customs official with 8 armed guards had been posted in Bulkhair itself. In Sep tember 1907 the trade was particularly brisk at Bushehr, the principal smuggler being, apparently, the Persian Commandant of Artillery. While the trade was thus but imperfectly checked at the two extrem ities of the Persian coast, arms were believed to be pouring in without let or hindrance through the intermediate Shibkuh ports, where the Customs had either no representatives at all, or only such as were dependent for their safety upon the local Shaikhs to whom they were accredited.

Commander Somerville's report. The subject of the arms trade in the Gulf of 'Oman, as distinguished from the Gulf of Persia, cannot be separated, after 1905, from the history of the measures by which the British Government sought to check it, and we shall accordingly treat of the two together. In October 1905 it was found that the importation of arms into Makran was taking place chiefly through the coast villages of Tank and Galag; and it was observed that the number of arms in the interior had very greatly increased, especially in the neighbourhood of Dizak. Sardar Sir Nauroz Khan, Nausherwani, of Kharan, was said to be an extensive purchaser of the newer kinds of rifles, among which were now some of German patterns. The problem of preventing the despatch of arms from Masqat to the Persian coast, or otherwise of intercepting the consignments en route, was carefully considered by the British naval authorities in the Persian Gulf during the winter of 1905-1906. During the month of Jan uary 1906, H. M. S. 'Redbreast,' Commander H. B. T. Somerville, lay continually at Masqat,—an arrangement by which the trade was for the moment completely stopped, but at the cost of immobilising a ship. At the end of February and beginning of March 1906, under the orders of Vice-Admiral E. S. Poe, Naval Commander-in-Chief, the Makran coast was carefully watched by H. M. S. ' Fox/' which kept in close touch with Chahbar ; but no captures were effected. After some experience of Masqat and the Makran coast Commander Somerville reported, as the result of his observations, that the season of transporting arms across the Gulf extended from November to March; that a native vessel could make the passage in about 36 hours in a moder ate Shamal; that Friday, after general prayers, was a favourite time of departure from Masqat; that Galag, on account of its proximity to the Karwan district, was the chief port of entry on the Makran side, but that Tank, and to a lesser extent the mouths of the Rapch and Sadaich rivers and the western side of Chahbar Bay, were also frequented by smugglers 0 f arms; and that it was the practice to store the imported arms at places ield aQ42Z) 2579 in the Karwan district until a sufficient number had been collected to load a caravan. Commander Somerville^s principal suggestions were that a ship based on Jashk, or preferably on Chahbar, should be employed to patrol the coast, and that the movements of Afghans trying to procure camel transport near the coast should be carefully watched by the employes of the Indo-European Telegraph Department. A little later, Vice-Admiral Poe himself visited the Gulf and reported Vice- Admiral to the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty on the subject of the traffic ^ &gt;0 ® ,s ^port. in arms. He thought that there was little hope of the trade being sup pressed by the British war vessels on the station, which were too large and drew too much water for the purpose, especially as their whereabouts must always be well known and their movements were carefully watched by the Arabs. He anticipated good results, however, from the possession by the Persian Imperial Customs of some steam launches, which had recently been built for them at Bombay. The next event of importance in connection with the trade was the ^P uta ^oii deputation of Captain F. McConaghey, Assistant Political Agent in ^Conaghey' British Makran and Commandant of the Makran Levy Corps, to Persian to Persian Makran, to confer with the local officials and with a representative whom Maki-an the Persian Government proposed to send from Tehran. Captain April to June McConaghey marched along the coast from Pasni via Gwadar to Chah- 1906 * bar, where he met with Mirza Mahmud Khan, the local Mudir of Customs, who had in the meantime been substituted for the delegate from Tehran. The party left Chahbar on the 18th of April, and, after visiting Parag, Kair, Bir, Bandani, Tank and Galag by the way, arrived at a camp near Balak on the Rapch river. As the Governor of Bampur, the Sa'ad-ud-Dauleh, who was then at Gaih, could not be induced to come down to the coast. Captain McConaghey and Mirza Mahmud Khan started on the 1st of May for Gaih, which they reached, via Bint, on the 7th. With much difficulty, after 10 days' persuasion, the Governor consented to return with the delegates to the Karwan district on the Rapch river, which was clearly shown to be the prin cipal seat of the trade. Here, on the 27th of May, the Sa^ad-ud-Dauleh held a public Darbar at which he informed the Chief of Gaih and the notables and headmen present that the importation of arms into Persia by sea was strictly prohibited between Chahbar and Sadaich, and that they would be held responsible for preventing it. A regular agreement also, dated 26th May 1906, was executed , ree _ in acknowledgment of this obligation by 13 headmen of the district ^ ent, 26th affected, was endorsed by Said Khan, Chief of Gaih, and was May 1906. attested by the Sa^ad-ud-Dauleh, by Captain McConaghey and by Mirza Mahmud Khan. A little later it was formally accepted at Chahbar by the Ittila/-ud-Dauleh, Karguzar of Muhammareh, whom the Persian Government had deputed as a second representative or their part to deal with the question of the arms traffic in Southern Persia. The text of this Agreement forms Annexure No. 5 to the present Appendix. The investigations of Captain McConaghey threw much fresh light upon the new conditions of the trade. He found that almost every ^ptain 7 inhabitant of the Karwan district was armed with some sort of breech- MoCona- m a2580 ghe/s enquiry. Impotance of tlie Persian authorities. loading rifle; but up country the number of arms of precision eeemed to be less than 30,000/the figure at which they had been estimated by the Persian Governor of Bam pur. The weapon most prized was the Martini-Henry rifle or carbine of English manufacture ; but the *303 carbine had begun to find favour with the well-to-do classes. The arms carried by the poor were generally obsolete military rifles of Russian, French and German models^ and these were sometimes obtainable at a price so low as Rs. 12. With regard to the history and development of the trade in Persian Makran, it was ascertained that importation by sea had actually begun some eight years previously, but during the first four or five years it had been conducted on a small scale only, to meet a purely local demand. The persons engaged in it had been, and still were, Baluchis and natives of Masqat and of Qishm, who kept small shops at the harbours on the coast, or at central places in the interior such as Gaih, Qasrkand, and even Dizak and Bampur. The beginnings of an Afghan trade had first been noticed in 1903-1904 ; but in that year only a few Afghans visited the coast, and the caravans were small. In 1904-1905 the Afghan business became more organised, and two large arms caravans for the far interior left Galag, while one marched from Sadaich ; the number of arms carried north by these was esti mated at 3,000 rifles. In 1905-1906 operations had commenced in November and a brisk season was expected, but the advent of the Anglo-Persian commission somewhat marred its success. In Decem ber 1905 about 900 rifles were landed at Tank and about 400 at Barak, all of which were brought to Karkindar in the Karwan district ; and, at the end of March or beginning of April; two separate consignments of 500 and 700 rifles respectively were safely brought ashore at the mouth of the Rapch river. These consign ments were accompanied by unusually large quantities of ammunition. During this winter only one caravan for the north left Karwan ; it was supposed to have conveyed away some 1,500 or 2,000 of the rifles accumulated in the district and a corresponding amount of ammunition. This caravan, which started early in April, was said to have consisted of about 100 Afghans with 150 camels and to have proceeded via Raigan. With reference to repressive measures, Captain McConaghey reported that the agreement of 1902 between the Governor-General of Kirman and the Political Agent, Kalat, had been disregarded by the Persian authorities, who, for want of material force, were in fact powerless to enforce it : their hold upon the country was already precarious, and they did not care to expose it to any additional strain. The local chiefs, among whom the principal were Said Khan of Gaih and Islam K han of Bint, were pecuniarily interested in the traffic, inasmuch as they received from one to three dollars on each rifle in transit. In some cases these chiefs were in rebellion against the Persian Government, in others on bad terms with their own subjects ; and anarchy consequently prevailed throughout the country. In such circumstances the excuse given by local headmen for their failure to prevent the traffic, viz., tnat the^ had not received any orders on the subject, either from the Persian officials or from their own chiefs, was one which it was difficult to dis pute, and one object of the Karwan agreement was to remove it for the future. The existence at Karkindar in Karwan of a small Afghan2581 s colony presided over by a certain Mulla Khair Muhammad, better known as the ' Khalifah Sahib was noted as a circumstance calculated to assist the Afghan arms trade. Various practical recommendations as to the best means of securing the observance of the Karwan agreement were made by Captain McConaghey. Not long after Captain McConaghey's tour in Persian Makran reports began to be received from Afghanistan of the arrival of large consignments of Masqat Martinis in that country. In September and October weapons of this class were found to be plentiful in Qandahar ; and proof was obtained of the favourable attitude of the Governor of that district towards the trade. In November a balance of about 800 of these arms had reached Kabul ; and it was reported that l;000 had been disposed of en route by the importers, who were Nasirs, in the Qandahar and Ghazni districts. The cartridges introduced into Afgha nistan at the same time were estimated at 90,000. Another party of Nasirs were said to have brought 1,600 Masqat Martinis and 70,000 cartridges into the districts of Qandahar and Ghazni alone ; and it was stated that His Majesty the Amir had remitted the customs duty on these importations. In this year considerable quantities of European-made rifles, said to have been brought from Masqat, were reported to have appeared in the Afghan districts of Ningrahar and Birmal adjoining the Indian frontier. The appointment of a British Vice-Consul to Bam in the spring of 1906 was made partially with a view to ascertain whether anything could be done from that side, with the help of the Persian authorities to arrest the flow of arms northwards from the coast of Persian Makran to Afghanistan. In the following winter (November 1906 to January 1907) Lieutenant G. D. Ogilvie, the first Vice-Consul, made an extensive tour, in the course of which he travelled 644 miles in 52 days, visiting Bampur, Fahraj, Magas and Sarbaz, and was hospitably received by the Akram-us-Saltanehj the Governor of Persian Baluchis tan. The result of this journey was to show that the route usually followed by smugglers lay to the east of Bampur, and that the vastness of the distances and the inhospitable nature of the country made it impossible to take action against them with any chance of success. An additional, and in itself sufficient, reason for not expecting any result from energy expended in this quarter was the weakness of the local administration, for the Persian officials were unable to obtain information of the approach of caravans and, with a force of only 400 inefficient troops at their disposal, they naturally shrunk from conflicts with the smugglers, who moved in large and heavily armed gangs. The sympathy of the local chiefs and of the populace, who were found to be well provided with every kind of modern firearm, lay with the smugglers ; and they would do nothing to facilitate the arrest of the latter. In Lieutenant Ogilvie's opinion, restraint, in order to be effective, must be applied at the coast and not in the interior.

S. Poe ; the efforts by sea to stop the importation of arms and ammunition into Persian Makran were resumed and redoubled. At least one gunboat was continuously engaged during the next three or four months in patrolling the coast between Chah bar and Jashk; ingenious expedients were adopted to defeat the watchful ness of the smugglers^ who had ; it was believed^ a system of signals ; and wireless telegraphy was utilized as a means of communication between ships: but the task proved impossible^ and the only result was a heavy and unremunerative expenditure of coal. Successful elusions were of frequent occurrence, and it appeared that the destination of vessels carrying arms was now generally altered after leaving Masqat,—a precau tion which frustrated every attempt to obtain useful intelligence through informers. On the 5th of January 1907 a vessel left Masq&amp;t for the Makran coast carrying 300 rifles, and on the 13th was followed by another with 400 ; but, though these departures were telegraphed to Jashk and H.M.S. 'Lapwing^ and 'Redbreast'' kept a sharp lookout along the Persian coast, both apparently succeeded in reaching their destination. Again, between the 3rd and the 5th of March, three Badans carrying arms purchased by Afghans at Masqat, left 'that port, and H.M.S. c&lt; Proserpineon receipt of the news made vigorous search for them along the opposite coast and examined a number of sailing vessels, but without result; later, it became known that on the 7th of the month about 1,000 rifles had been landed at J agin by a large vessel belonging- to Dibai, to which, as subsequent inquiry showed, they had been transferred from the Badans off Masna^ah. At this time there were about 100 Afghans present in M asqat, more than half of whom appeared to be living there at the expense of M. Goguyer, the French arms merchant. On the 12th of March another vessel with arms left Masqat and on the i8th succeeded in discharging her cargo at Gabrig, where H. M.S. ^ Redbreast ^ had examined four native boats only 48 hours before, and where H.M.S. ' Proserpine' arrived a few hours afterwards2583 '4^4 to find the vessel empty and a watchfire still burning. On the morning of the 20th of March a further consignment was landed near Lash in the Jashk district. In each of the cases last mentioned the movement of a number of Afghans towards the coast had attracted atten tion towards the point where the arrival of the arms was expected by the consignees^ but in both instances the necessary intelligence was received and communicated too late. In May the Nakhuda of a vessel believed to be carrying arms was reported to have thrown the cargo overboard on sighting H.M.8. 'Sphinx' near Jashk; the true nature of the incident however, remained somewhat doubtful. By the end of the season the officers of the Eoyal Navy, among whom Commanders Hose and James had taken the largest share in the operations, were satisfied of the prac tical impossibility of checking the arms trade by sea; but, at their sugges tion, Mr. R. New, Assistant Superintendent at Jashk of the Indo-Euro pean Telegraph Department, was officially thanked for the trouble he had taken in organising a system of intelligence along the coast by means of telephones and special watchmen. Meanwhile preparations for striking a blow, if possible, at the Afghan arms trade had been made by Major F. C. Webb-Ware, Political Agent, Chagai; and, on receiving news of the departure early in April 1907 of a large consignment from Jagin, he caused the routes which lead from Persia across the extreme north-western salient of British Baluchistan into Afghan territory to be watched with special care. On the 27th of April a caravan of 200 camels, accompanied by 80 armed Afghans and headed by one Muhammad Jan, Kharoti, arrived from the south at Kacha Thana, where they halted for a few hours, intend- inp- to proceed via the Eacha gorge to Gudar-i-Shah on the Shelag river, and so to Band-i-Kamal Khan on the Helmand. Major Webb-Ware on being informed of the circumstances by telegraph, sent orders to the tew levies at Saindak and Rob at to delay the passage of the caravan through the Kacha gorge, by firing at the camels, while troops were despatched to their assistance. The Saindak levies reached the gorge about 10 p. m the same evening, and an hour later the caravan made its appearance ; but the number of the smugglers enabled them to force the passage,—not however without loss, as was proved by bloodstains and the abandonment of a case of 2,900 rounds of Kynoch ammunition. Meanwhile a partyof 50 regu- lar native infantry had marched from the Kohat post; but although they covered a distance of 62 miles in 22 hours, in a temperature by day ot 98° F. in the shade, they arrived too late; and on reaching the Afghan border, which the caravan had by this time crossed, they were obliged to retrace their steps. It was subsequently ascertained that the caravan carried about 1,500 rifles and 200,000 cartridges ; that the members of it on entering Afghanistan refused to pay import duty on their goods though demanded by the Afghan officials; and that the destmation of the whole consignment was Ghazni. With the caravan were eeen two IWu 8 who spoke Panjabi, and were not, apparently, Bamyae from Afghanistan. Dispositions were at once made by the' Political Agent, Chagai, for the reception of a second caravan which was following '^he wake of the first; and, by the timely co-operation of 30 rifles of the Robat escort with the Saindak and Eobat levies, it was effectually broken up in the Preventive measures in British Baluchistan, 1907.

Kacha gorge on the 2nd of May, being driven by the levies from behind on to the regular infantry who lay in ambush at the exit of the gorge. This caravan consisted of about 100 camels, and it was accompanied by 40 or 50 armed Afghans, who scattered to the surrounding hills and main tained a stout fight from behind cover until the afternoon. In all 795 rifles and nearly 67,000 rounds of ammunition were abandoned by the smugglers, and over 70 of their camels were either killed or captured. A Baluchi guide who conducted the caravan was killed in the engagement, and a number of other casualties were believed to have been inflicted. The pecuniary loss to the owners, including two camel-loads of cartridges which were exploded by bullets striking them, was estimated at not less than Rs. 1 ,00,000 by local value, representing a very much larger sum in the Ghazni market. Examination of the captured arms showed that the majority were Snider rifles of private manufacture or Martinis which had been publicly sold by various Australian Governments, while the remainder were mostly Martinis of private manufacture or rifles of European Continental patterns, the last being probably condemned military arms. Some papers taken indicated that the Afghan Governor of Herat was cognisant of the trade in arms, and that he befriended those engaged in it. Four months later the affair became a subject of corre spondence between His Majesty the Amir of Afghanistan and the Viceroy of India, the former complaining that certain of his Nasir subjects of the Qandahar district, lawfully engaged in the arms trade, had been waylaid and plundered by the servants of the British Government* In a letter dated 11th September the Amir stated that two of the traders had been killed and three wounded, while five were still missing; of all of these the actual names were given. This success of the British authorities encouraged the Persian Govern ment to apply, at the end of May, through the British M inister at Tehran for the assistance of British troops, if required, on the Persian side of the frontier in order to capture a third Afghan arms caravan, which was believed to be moving northwards in the neighbourhood of the boundary. Chiefly on account of the disturbed state of general politics and of popular feeling in Persia, the request was declined; it had, indeed, almost imme diately been withdrawn by the Persian Government themselves, in so far as it related to British co-operation in Persian territory; and subsequent enquiries made it somewhat doubtful whether the supposed caravan ever really existed. Meanwhile the routes used by Afghan gun-runners in the neighbour hood of the Perso-Afghan frontier had been studied by Major R.L. Kennion, His Britannic Majesty^s Consul for Sistan and Qain. In September 1907 Major Kennion reported that north of Bazman there were two groups of routes, viz., those leading to Herat and those leading to Qandahar; and that travellers to Herat generally entered Afghanistan near Lash-Juwain, while those whose destination was Qandahar made for Band-i-Kamal Khan on the bank of the Helmand, or for some place m that vicinity. From Major Kennion^s report it was clear that arms caravans proceeding to Afghanistan from the south were not obliged, in any circumstances, to enter British territory at all; also that in Persia there was no prospect of effective action being taken by the authorities gainst smugglers of arms. According to Major Kennion's information iuo.2585 five arms caravans for Afghanistan had started during 1907 from the Makran coast, of which only the two attacked at Kacha had passed through British territory: the first one and the last two of the series had travelled on Persian soil the whole way from the sea to the Afghan border. By the failure of the means tried for the repression of smuggling—' except the measures taken in British territory, through which there was no necessity that importers should pass—the reader will have been prepared to learn that the Afghan trade up to the end of 1907 continued in a flourishing condition. The arrival of the following consignments from Masqat on the coast of Persian Makran were reported during the months which followed the seizure at Kacha TTndiminish- ed pros perity of the arms trade with Afgha nistan, 1907.

In the month of October 1907 it was reported by the Political Agent at Masqat that rifles were beinff carried over by Baluchis to the Makran coast at the rate of 200 a week, a statement which, by the information reaching the telegraph officers on the Persian side, was fully confirmed. Meanwhile it had been shown that Sir Nauroz Khan, Nausherwani, Kharan Am of Kharan in British Baluchistan, while preventing the passage of arms Agreement, caravans through his territory, was accustomed to purchase a number of °™ 7 J u v Masqat rifles from Jalk and Dizak and to take others by way of fine from caravans crossing his border. As there was reason to fear that he2586 might in the future be tempted to import rifles on his own account from Masqat^ he was induced on the 8th of July to execute an agreement that he would not do so without reference to the British authorities in -Baluchistan. This was, however, a matter of internal administration and did not at all affect the arms trade in its wider aspects. Present policy of the British Government and position of the trade, 1907. Recommen dations of the Govern ment of India and orders of His Majesty's Government, 1907. Statement of the situation in 1907. In February 1907, the inadequacy of local preventives and palliatives having become very apparent, the Government of India, in an exhaustive despatch to the Secretary of State which was supported by full evidence of the dangerous growth of the trade, reverted to their proposals of 1902-1903 and again recommenced the closure by international agreement of the Masqat market as the only complete and satisfactory solution of the arms trade question. Various methods were also suggested by which, after agreement with Turkey, a check might be applied to the influx of arms and ammunition into Kuwait and the Turkish possessions on the Persian Gulf; but these were expressly declared to be of secondary importance. The reply of His Majesty^s Government, received in the following April, indicated that the time was not propitious for the negotiations proposed by the Government of India, but that suitable instructions would be given to the British Plenipotentiaries at an international Arms Conference which was to be held at Brussels early in 1908. The present situation is therefore as follows. Since 1902 the arms trade has been nominally prohibited at every port, except Masqat, in the Gulfs of Persia and ''Oman ; but smuggling and connivance at breaches of the law are so universally prevalent that arms and ammuni tion continue to be distributed from Masqat over the length and breadth of the Gulf region, and a brisk and regular trade in arms has sprung up between Masqat and Afghanistan. The importations at Masqat, though the small local demand of the 'Oman Sultanate must long since have been satisfied, are still on the same scale as before the general prohibition of the trade in 1902; but they now represent the whole, or nearly the whole, instead of a part only of the trade. It has been proved, at the cost of an immense expenditure of energy by British establishments, that the illegal dissemination of arms from the free port of Masqat cannot be prevented, or even appreciably hindered, by naval means; also that measures, however efficacious, taken in British Baluchistan do not and cannot influence the course of the Afghan traffic; while officers who have studied the question on the spot in Persia agree that the Govern ment of that country are incapable, however much they may desire to do so, of putting down the trade across Persia between Masqat and Afghanistan. . -J- 11 Middle East, where, besides intensifying anarchy and bloodshed in Central Arabia and in some of the smaller states, it has weakened the authority of the Persian and Turkish Governments and threatens2587 in the end to produce widespread and incurable disorder^ the arms trade is at least as great a public evil as the slave trade; and^ for this reason^ it is much to be regretted that joint action by the civilised powers of Europe for its suppression, beyond the zone within which it is already prohibited by the Brussels Act, should have been so long delayed. In the interests of British India, also, it is very desirable that an end should be put to the supply of arms and ammunition via the Persian Gulf to the tribes of the Afghan frontier.

In discussing the recent reform of the Persian customs^ it should not be forgotten that the customs of Bushehr town were once placed^ for a brief space of time^ under British management; this event proved to be the precursor^ at a short interval^ of a modernisation of customs methods through the whole of Persia. In April 1898^ in accordance with the terms of a loan of £50^000 made by the (British) Imperial Bank of Persia to the Persian G overnment^ the customs house at Bushehr came under the direct control of the Bank. Some local excitement was caused by a report that the goods of Persian merchants^ which, in consideration of Rahdari and other internal duties paid by Persian but not by European traders, had hitherto been taxed at the rate of 2 per cent, or 3 per cent, only, would in future be liable to a uniform tariff of 5 per cent., and a few Mullas were even induced to stigmatise the transfer of management as contrary to the Muhammadan religion. At the outset a serious [riot was only prevented by British bluejackets being stationed in a launch off the customs house ; but the regime of the Bank quickly recommended itself to the people, and its popularity was still increasing when, by repayment of the loan in August 1898, the control of the Bank was suddenly brought to an end. * This Appendix has been compiled chiefly from the records of the Government of India in the Political Department; but the following sources of information have also been utilised : the annual Administration Reports of the Persian Gulf Political Residency ; a summary of events in Persia during the year 1906, by Sir 0. Spring- Rice, His Britannic Majesty's Minister at Tehran ; a report on the customs of the Persian Gulf, Pars and Makran, addressed by M. Naus to the Mushir-ud-Dauleh on the 3rd February 1907 ; and a report on the customs of Persia, addressed by M. Naus to the Shah on the 8th of February 1908. The Appendix was carefully revised by Majoi P. Z. Cox. Eesident in the Persian Gulf, and by Mr. G. P. Churchill, Oriental Secretary of the British Legation at Tehran, both of whom made important corrections and additions. The materials for Annexure No. 1 were supplied by Messrs. A. and T. J. Malcolm, Bushehr, and those for Annexure No. 2 b}' the courtesy of MM. Hejnssens and W a 8 n er, the Directors-General respectively of the customs of the South and of Arabistan. The situation of the customs posts from Dilam to Jashk is shown in a Mough Tracing of Map showing Customs Stations, Tests, etc., in Directorate eneral of the South, 1906, which is map No, 1394 in the Library of the Foreign Department at Simla, r j ■ ?2595 The funds with which their obligations to the Bank were discharged appear to have been obtained by the Persian Government from a Russian sonrce; and this^ at least, is certain^ that the Russian Government had regarded the arrangement with jealousy. Reorganisation of the Persian customs as the Imperial Persian Customs. Until 1899 the realisation of customs revenue in Persia continued to Former take place on old-fashioned Asiatic principles. In other words the system, duties were farmed to officials or local magnates, and there was no uniformity of system nor—except in the case of foreign traders—of tariff ; while the proceeds which reached the Persian treasury were small in relation to the sums actually collected from the people, and the arbitrary powers of the farmers were highly unfavourable to trade. The financial embarrassments of Persia, beginning about the year Reasons for 189^, were the instrument by which a reform of this wasteful and the change, pernicious system was at length brought about; for European loans could only be obtained on tangible security; and efficiently managed customs were the only such security which Persia had it in her power to create. Early in 1898 the Shah obtained the services of M. Naus, a Belgian Employment customs expert, who was accompanied by two professional Belgian of Belgian customs officers, M. M. Priem and Tbeunis; and on Nauruz, the 21st ® x P0 rts - of March 1899, the management of the Customs of Persia was handed over to M. Naus. In this first year, which was devoted chiefly to observation, the customs of Azarbaijan alone were taken under direct management and entrusted to M. Priem; but the results were satisfac tory and reform proceeded apace; M. Naus was shortly recognised as Minister of Customs at Tehran) and within the next two years every customs house in Persia was taken out of farm and placed under the direct management of a new department of Imperial Peisian Customs, in which all the superior posts were held by Belgians. The principal objects of M. Nans were, from the first, to establish a Main prin- uniform and efficient system of collection by state officials; to obtain a oiples of readjustment and general enhancement of import duties; to stimulate retorm. exports by a reduction of export duties^ and by a total abolition of transit dues-chiefly Rahdari and octroi—in the interior; and to put an end to the embargoes and arbitrary restraints on trade which were imposed, generally for corrapt purposes by local governors. In all of these objects, except the last, M. Naus was in the end successful; and, by insisting that customs duty should be taken m specie, he greatly increased the value of the collections, of which two-thirds had hitherto been paid into the treasury m Government bills that could not be cashed in the market unless at a discount of 30 to 50 per cent. 173 A2596 Extension of the new system to the Persian Gulf, 1900-02. Bushehr, Lingeh and Bandar 'Abbas taken over, March 1900. Native opposition to the change. Increase of revenue, 1900-01. On the 21st of MarcK 1900 the Bushehr customs, which since the withdrawal of the Imperial Bank's agents had been indifferently managed by the Governor of the Gulf Ports as lessee, passed under the control of the new department, as did ako the customs of Lingeh and Bandar 'Abbas. The first Director-General of Customs at Bushehr was a M. Simais, who had formerly been a commercial attache in the Belgian Legation at Tehran. The change of management at the principal southern ports, accom panied as it was by an attempt to introduce a uniform 5 per cent, tariff applicable to native merchants, was met by strong and concerted opposition on the part of the Persian trading community, especially at Bushehr and Shiraz, wbere no imported goods were cleared for a month. A lower scale of duties, which was substituted as a temporary concession to the agitators, was at first similarly resisted; but by August it had been successfully enforced ; and not long afterwards the uniform 5 per cent, rate was brought into operation, octroi and Eahdari being however abolished by Imperial decree as compensation for the enhancement of tariff against Persian merchants.* Altogether about two months were lost to trade generally by this contest between the Persian Government and the Persian mercantile community; and the British Legation at Tehran, though in no way antagonistic to the policy of the Belgian Customs officials, were obliged to insist on the respon sibility of the Persian Government for the detention by agitators at IShiraz of the goods of British merchants which were on their way from Bushehr to the interior. The results obtained by the Imperial Customs during their first year in the Persian Gulf were remarkable, and the grand cordon of the Lion and the Sun, conferred on M. Nans at Nauruz 1901, was in every respect a well-merited honour. In spite of the two months 9 cessation of trade in 1900, the net customs revenue of the Gulf in 1900-01 was 319,742 Tumans as against'250,000 f Tumans—'the amount for which they had last been farmed to the Darya Baigi, Governor of the Gulf Ports, but of which only a portion reached the Persian Government, the greater part having been expended—so it was alleged by the Darya Baigi—in payments chargeable to the Government. * The 6 per cent, import duty exigible from foreign subjects had been in some cases collected in two instalments, viz.i 3|- per cent, at the poit of entry and 1| per cent, at the place of destination. At times, however, the full 5 per cent, would be collected by the customs farmer at the coast and a further amount taken by the inland authorities, and inl89l-92 the British Indian traders at Mashhad complained that the duties thus extorted from them aggregated 8 to 9 per'cent. in all. The trouble was generally at Bandar 'Abb&amp;s ; but sometimes customs were taken twice on the Kftrun, once by the Shaikh of Muhammareh and again by the customs farmer of the Persian Government. Overlapping and double collection also occurred between the Khans of Dilam and Kig on the one hand and the customs lessee of Bushehr on the other. t '^ome particulars regarding former leases of the Gulf customs will be found in Anneiure No. 1 to this Appendix.2597 Resistance to the establislimeiit of Imperial control over tie customs was attempted in the 'Arabistan province and in the Hayat Davud district, in both of which it was for the time successful j and elsewhere, except at the largest ports, the efforts of the new Department were in a great degree frustrated by obstruction of a more passive character. The year 1901 was one of great activity on the part of the Imperial Other posts Customs in the Persian Gulf, and before it closed, posts had been established, established at Dilam, Khur Imam Hasan^ Kung, Bandar Mu^allim, -^01-02. Birkeh Sifleh, Khamir and Minab, and upon the island of Qishm. The customs of Chahbar and Gwatar were, at the time of their being taken over in January 1902, farmed for two years to British Indian contractors under an agreement executed so lately as April of the previous year; but the lease was repudiated by the Customs on the ground that the official by whom it was granted had acted without authority. The farmers were accordingly advised by the British political authorities to relinquish the farm and lodge a claim for compensation with the Persian Government; this they did, and eventually obtained a portion of the indemnity sought. Posts were brought into existence during 1902 at Charak, Mughu, Jashk and Chahbar, and on Qais Island. The struggle between the Shaikh of Muhammareh and the Persian Local resist Government in regard to the customs of 'Arabistan is narrated in the ance to the history of that province; it involved large political issues and was l ^5 ) ^ riiS ' closely watched by the British Government; and its termination, in September 1902^ was favourable to the Persian Government in the matter of customs control.* The abortive preparations made by the customs at Bushehr in 1902 for coercing Haidar Khan, Zabit of the Hayat Davud district, who refused to admit their posts at Rig and Ganaveh, are noticed in the history of the Persian Coast; and it only remains to add here that control of both these ports was eventually obtained by the customs in 1903 without resort to military compulsion. Revision of the Persian Tariff, 1901-03. We now enter on a new era in the fiscal history of Persia. In 1901, the commercial relations of Russia and Persia were governed Position by the Treaty of Turkmanchai, concluded in 1828, under which the custom duties on both sides of the frontier were restricted to a maximum Great Bri of 5 pef cent, ad valorem. Great Britain, by virtue of her Commercial tailli Treaty of 1841 and the Treaty of Peace of 1857, was entitled to the treatment of the most favoured nation, and she consequently participated in the benefits of the Treaty of Turkmanchai. * H may be mentioned that in 1883-81, before any qaestion of ha ^ arisen, the Persian Qomnnent lud soight to esUblish a costoms ' onse »[ the ' at MuhammarA; but the attjmpt was saocesstolly staved o£E by day.2598 Position as regards Turkey and Egypt- Principles and. revision^ The only power besides Russia^ wliicli had a cuBtoms tantt, as distinffuished from a most favoured nation arrangement, with Persia was Turkey; and the situation, as between Persia and Turkey, was o-overned. in regard to customs duty, by the Erzeroum Treaties of and 184)5. Under these Treaties the rate of duty payable by importers was fixed at 4 per cent, ad valorem j but the Persian Government claimed the riffht to levy an additional duty in case of the goods being subsequently sold in Persia; and they actually collected 6 per cent, upon coods imported from Turkey and 12 per cent, upon goods exported to Turkey, no stipulation in regard to export duty being contained m Treaties. The Porte retaliated with duties of equal amount; and tne commercial regime thus established had existed, in 1901, since about six years. The mutual obligations of Persia and Egypt were still regarded as defined by the Erzeroum Treaties, inasmuch as Egypt^ which at a later date obtained independence in its commercial relations, was m 184 an integral part of the Turkish Empire. Such was the position when M. Naus, as Minister of Custom^, be^an to press for revision of the Persian tariff. His plan, framed m accordance with his general ideas, on reform, was to substitute a specitic tariff, yielding larger revenues, for the existing duty of 5 per cent, w ic applied to the goods of most foreign countries, and to abolish most expor duties except those on opium and grain. The Russo-Persian Trade Declaration of 1901. Conclusion of the Russo- Persian De claration, 27tli October 1901. failure of an attempt by Kussia to obtain permanent control of Persia's commercial relations. Kegotiations Were opened in the first instance with Russia alone , and, though His Majesty's Government became aware of their progress in 1900, the British Minister was not successful in obtaining admittance to the discussion. Assurances were given by the Persian Government that nothing would be finally settled by them with Russian without previous consultation of the British Government, but they were vioiatedi The Declaration by which the new commercial arrangement between Persia and Russia was constituted was signed at Tehran on the 27t October 1901; but no copy of it could be procured by the British Lega tion, and it was only in February 1902 that Sir A. Hardmge was able to obtain, from a secret source, a statement of its principal con i- tions. The terms of the Russian Declaration need not be stated here &gt; those of the British Convention of 1903, which We shall shortly nave occasion to describe, were almost precisely similar. The Russian delegates to Tehran, headed by M. Goluboff, made strenuous efforts, in negotiating the Convention, to obtain from Persia an engagement that she would conclude no fresh commercial arrangements with other foreign powers except after previous agreement wit , and through the intermediacy of Russia; but their design was frustrated by the firmness of M. Naus, who pointed out to the Persian Government that the stipulation proposed involved all the inconvenien-2599 ces without the benefits o£ a Kussian protectorate^ and that it might debar Persia from entering into advantageous arrangements with other countries. The Turko-Persian Trade Convention of 190&amp; Only one means of resisting the application of the new tariff to Conclusion British o-oods remained in the Turko -Persian treaties of which of the Turko- 1902. Britain, as a most favoured nation, might claim the benefit, for the . validity of an argument founded on the rights of Egypt under the 5th s epte] ^. Treaties of Erzeroum was regarded as problematical; and this last ob- staole to the universal application of the new Russo- Persian tariff was adroitly removed by the Persian Government. In April 1902, the Persian Ambassador at Constantinople proposed that the existing Turko-Persian commercial regime should be replaced by most favoured nation treatment on both sides ; and the scheme was received^ not unfavourably by the Porte, as under it the duties to which Turkish ex ports-chiefly raw materials—were liable would be lighter than those actually in force, while Persian imports into Turkey would still pay duty at 8 per cent. ad valorem. The Grand Vazir of imkey had assured the British Ambassador at Constantinople, Sir Nicolas O Conor, that no arrangement modifying the commercial articles of the treaties of Erzeroum would be made without consulting the British Embassy ; but the pledge was broken ; and on the 5th of September 1902, during a visit of M. Naus to Constantinople, a most favoured nation agreement was concluded between Persia and Turkey by an exchange of diplomatic notes constituting a Convention. The Convention was m^e ermmaWe on one year's notice given by either country, a clause of which as we shall see, Turkey afterwards took advantage, with the result tha. the regime of the Erzeroum Treaties was restored. The Anglo -Persian Trade Declaration of 1903. The British Government were ^ serious situation.

Sir A. Hardinge went on to propose a special agreement^ by which Britain should accept the new tariff and Persia in return should undertake not to alter it without the consent of His Majesty's Government. M. Naus was at first disinclined to subject the Persian tariff to British as well as to Russian control; but eventually^ notwithstanding his opposition^ it was decided to conclude a commercial treaty between Britain and Persia very closely resembling that between Russia and Persia. One secret article^ attached to the Russo-Persian Declaration; was not reproduced,—an article that debarred Persia from granting a more favourable tariff to other countries without the consent of Russia, but at the same time empowered her to enhance the duties fixed by the tariff against countries refusing to grant her most favoured nation treatment. There were also several other differences of detail between the British and the Russian Declarations. The Anglo-Persian Declaration, drawn up in order to avoid delay in French and Persian instead of English and Persian, was signed at Tehran on the 9th of February 1903 and was sent to England by Lord Downe's Mission, which quitted the Persian capital upon the following day. The Declaration was a perpetual agreement; and it is therefore not open to modification at any future time without the assent of His Majesty's Government. It provided that certain fixed tariffs, detailed in special appendices, should be applied to imports into Persia; that imported goods should not pay any custom duties besides those levied under the tariff at their entrance into the country—this condition, however, not to preclude the levying of fees by the Customs for services rendered; that British traders and goods in Persia should continue to enjoy, under all conditions, most favoured nation treatment; that duties should not be levied on goods exported from Persia except in the case of a few articles specified in an appendix, namely certain articles of food, live animals, tobacco, opium, raw silk, and precious stones; that Rahdari and other road taxes should cease in Persia,, except upon carriage roads constructed under concessions, and that upon such roads a certain fixed rate should not be exceeded; that the system of farming the customs should be discontinued throughout Persia and replaced on every frontier by an efficient organisation under the direct management of the Central Government ; that bonded warehouses should be established in which imported goods might remain without payment of duty for 12- months from the day of arrival; and, finally, that a Reglement General, defining the executive arrangements and procedure of the Persian Imperial Customs, should be established by the Administration in agreement with the British Legation at Tehran. The customs of every frontier of Persia were expressly declared to be included in the scope of the Declaration, which also contained an article providing for proportional modification of the duties in case of serious fluctuations in the value of the Persian Qran. By means of observations appended to the body of the Declaration it was agreed that customs duties might be paid in Bank of England notes, so long as repayment of such notes in gold continued to be guaranteed by the British Government; that cases of infractions of the rules should be adjudicated upon by the local Director of Customs in consultation with a British ConsularJ III 2601 officer or his deputy ; and that appeals from the decisions of Directors should be determined by the central Customs Administration at Tehran in consultation with the British Minister or his representative. The terms of the Declaration were interpreted and amplified by an exchange of notes^, which took place on the 12th February 1903^ between Sir A. Hardinge and M. Naus. As a safeguard against accidental errors the tariff sanctioned by the Declaration was now expressly declared to be the same as that established under the Russo-Persian Declaration of 1901 ; the 14th of February 1903 was fixed as the date of the new tariff coming into force in Persia; and an undertaking was given by M. Naus that any reduction of tariff which might be granted to Russia would be simultaneously extended to Britain as a matter of course. The Declaration had reference chiefly to British trade in Persia; but the interests of Persian trade in the British dominions were not over looked. The principal stipulation under this head was that Persian merchants and merchandise should receive most favoured nation treat ment in the British Empire^ it being understood that a British Colony having a special customs tariff, which might cease to grant most favoured nation treatment to Persian imports, should forfeit the right to claim such treatment for its own imports into Persia. In case of the United Kingdom establishing—otherwise than by previous agreement with Persia—duties on goods liable to pay customs when imported from Persia into Russia, and in event of the duties so established being higher than those provided for in the Russian Declara tion of 1901, Persia should be entitled in her turn to impose correspond ing duties on articles of the same class arriving from the United Kingdom; a special Convention would be negotiated for this purpose, and, in default of agreement, the Declaration of 1903 would become void and both parties would revert to the regime established by the Treaty of Peace of 1857. It was made clear, by means of the notes exchanged on the 12th of February 1903, that the special Convention just mentioned would become necessary only if the reciprocal augmentations of taiiff should be contested. The question whether the preferential tariff of a British Colony in favour of the United Kingdom could be regarded as disentitling the Colony to most favoured nation treatment in Persia was raised, and was eventually settled in the negative. The Declaration was so framed as to apply in its entirety to Persia and the United Kingdom only ; and the British Colonies, the separate circumstances of each of which would have required much time for consideration, were left provisionally under the most favoured nation regime. This arrangement was made possible by the courtesy of M. Naus, who, though at the beginning he had opposed the idea of an Anglo- Persian Declaration altogether, m the end did his best to expedite the negotiations in order that it might not e oc e by Russian interference. His attitude in the whole matter was unpre judiced and conciliatory; and it went far to clear Ins administration from the charge of Russian proclivities, _ and to prove that he was actuated by a single-minded regard for the interests of Persia. The ratifications of the Declaration were exchanged at Tehran on the 27th of April 1903. Great displeasure with Persia was expressed by tne Supplement ary agreo ment, 12tli February 1903.

Russian Government at the secret|conclusion o£ an agreement conferring on Great Britain a control over future tariff revision, 'which had hitherto belonged to Kussia alone. 5 ^ The enforcement of the tariff of the 14th of February 1903^ was sudden ; but it had been long foreseen in commercial circles^ and various applications for refunds of duty made by British firms on the ground of insufficient notice were not supported by the Legation at Tehran. The tariff was unpopular with native merchants^ and there was agitation at Tabriz, Bushehr^ and Shiraz ; but disturbances^ which were at one time anticipated^ did not occur. This is not the place in which to discuss the commercial bearings of the tariff; but one such matter of importance deserves to be mentioned here ; especially as it was the subject of a misunderstanding on the part of the British Government. The duty on tea was fixed by the Anglo- Persian tariff at 18 Qrans per Batman on white^ and at 12 Qrans per Batman on black teas^ but it might be reduced by the Persian Govern ment to 6 Qrans,—a form of expression borrowed from a declaration put in by M. Argyropoulo ; the Russian Minister, in signing the Russo- Persian Declaration of 1901. The duty actually charged when the tariff was brought into force was 10 Qrans on white and 6 on black teas, to which a special rate of 7 Qrans on mixed teas was subsequently added. The British Government understood that these rates, having once been introduced in virtue of the power of reduction possessed by the Persian Government, could not be subsequently enhanced without the consent of the British and Russian Governments; but this construction of the Declaration and of the tariff was not admitted by the Persian Govern ment, who explained that a low rate had been adopted in^ the first instance merely in order to avoid trouble with their own subjects, and asserted a right to enhance the duties at any time, subject to the maximum fixed by the tariff. The import of tea into Persia amounted at this time to about six and a half million pounds per annum, and the additional revenue to be obtained by even a trifling increase of the duty was thus large, making the Persian Government reluctant to forego the right of enhancement which they claimed. In the end their claim was conceded by the British Government. The Reglement Dcmanier of 1904. Difficulty as to penalties for offences. It still remained to draw up and establish a code for the ^ working of the customs ; this code had been mentioned in the Declarations of 1901 and 19C3 under the title of Reglement General, but it was more frequently described in later negotiations as the Reglement Douanier or Reglement Legal. The treatment of offenders against the customs regulations originally proposed by M. Naus, the Minister of Customs, was exceedingly severe. * A copy of the Russo-Persian tariff sent to the Government of India showed the duty as 10 Qrins on white and 6 Qrans on black teas, but this was a clerical error.2603 sind was objected to both by tbe Russian Government and by the Govern ment of India. M. Nans was desirons that the importation of goods in contraband or by unauthorised routes should be punishable^ on European analogies^ with a fine equal to 10 times the value of the goods^ with confiscation of the goods themselves and the means of transport^ and^ in some cases, with imprisonment. The opposition of the Russian Govern ment to these penalties was uncompromising and prolonged ; and M. Naus was at one time inclined to advise the Persian Government that they should appeal to the International Tribunal at the Hague and lodge a claim for damages on account of the loss of warehouse and other fees resulting from the delay. Eventually, at the instance chiefly of the Russian Government, the penalty of imprisonment was abandoned ; and confiscation of transport and goods became the maximum punishment under the Reglement for importation in contraband or by unauthorised routes. M. Naus was most unwilling to renounce the power of confiscat ing the means of transport, the only deterrent which, in his opinion, could be enforced against the carriers as distinguished from the owners of goods j in the end, however, in deference to the wishes of the British Government, he agreed that—except in the case of habitual offenders and in certain other circumstances—the option of a fine not exceeding £60 might be allowed when transport had become liable to confiscation, and tbe option of a fine not exceeding the value of the goods when goods were subject to forfeiture. The Keglement was signed by the British Minister at Tehran on the 29th of August, 1904?, a few days after it had been accepted by the Russian Government; and it came into force on the 1st of September following. The concession, due to British objections, of an alternative to the confiscation of transport and goods was, instead of being incorporated in the text of the Reglement, embodied m a special declaration made by M Naus at the time of signature. Sir A. Hardinge accompanied his signature by an important^declaration, to which we shall revert* m connection with another subject. The Reglement was, in substance, an elaboration of the Declarations of 1901 and 1903 ; and it is therefore unnecessary to enter in much detail on its provisions. The liability of merchandise to import and export dutv was defined, and the various fees were particularised which mikt be recovered for clerical assistance, for seals, for warehouse and bonded-warehouse accommodation, for the use of cranes, for labour, and for surveillance, when provided by the Customs Administration. The in troduction of goods into Persia, except at points where custom houses qualified to receive them existed, was forbidden; the importation of fire arms and ammunition, of coin other than gold or silver, of aniline dyes and of seditious, irreligious and immoral publications or objects was prohibited; the exportation of carpets dyed with aniline was also made illegal; and power P was reserved to prevent the exportation of other articles, especially food-stuffs, upon public grounds. Confiscation was prescnbed as the penalty for attempting to import or export prohibited objects.

Acceptance of the Eeglemetit by Great Britain, 29th August 1904. Substance of the Reglement. Wi2604 Administra tive appendix to the Reglement. interpreters or dragomanand student interpreters, were admitted to a similar privilege, along with professional Consuls and Vice-Consuls, and the interpreters and non-Persian secretaries of Consulates ; the corre spondence, including parcels, of foreign Embassies, Legations and Con sulates was not to be subject to examination ; and ordinary mail bags, containing letters only, were also to be passed free of scrutiny provided they had been regularly closed and sealed by a foreign post office, and that they were handed over to the agents of the Persian Post Office. Provision was also made for the establishment of warehouses and bonded warehouses; and the articles relating to frauds and contraventions were drawn up in the terms agreed on between Russia and Persia, to which reference has already been made. The Reglement was followed by a table which showed the location and grouping of all the customs posts either established or proposed to be established in Persia, together with the status and functions of each. In the Persian Gulf two main divisions were constituted, styled respec tively ' ' Arabistan ' and a I he South.^ ^Arabistan was given only one a principal ^ post—Muhammareh ; the South had three-Bushehr, Lingeh, and Bandar ^Abbas. At the principal posts every kind of customs business might be transacted; but the numerous subsidiary posts were only authorised to deal with coasting craft running between one Persian port and another, and with sailing vessels engaged in foreign trade. Progress of the Imperial Persian Customs in the Gulf, 1902-04. Creation o£ a separate cus toms division of 'Arabis- tan, 1903. Vessels pro vided for the preventive service, 1903-06, The tables of posts at the end of this Appendix are evidence of the unremitting industry of the Customs Administration in the Persian Gulf during the time that the Declarations of 1901 and 1903 and the Regle- ment itself were undep discussion, and afterwards. The customs of 'Arabistan, after the controversy with the Shaikh had been settled as described in the history of that province, were brought under direct management with effect from September 1902; and in February 1903, after they had been for some months managed by the Director-General at Bushehr, the ^Arabistan Customs were constituted a separate division under M. WafOelaert as the first separate Director- General. Steps were also taken to improve the general efficiency of the preventive establishment. At the beginning of 1903 the Belgian steam yacht' Selika '—which in 1901 had achieved a certain political notoriety in the Persian G ulf—was purchased from Europe and, under the name of ' Mozafder/^ was employed for the prevention of smuggling; she carried a couple of small Hotchkiss guns and was officered in the begin- ning by four Europeans, two of whom were engineers, but later the places of the European engineers were taken by natives of Baghdad. In the autumn of 1903 funds were provided for the purchase of 5 armed sea-going steam-launches of 10 knots for the preventive service ; in the following year the contract for their construction was placed by the # Vide page 2247 ante.(i4%£ 2605 Persian Government with the Royal Indian Marine dockyard at Bombay ; and in June 1906 two of them had been completed and were ready for delivery after the monsoon. In 1902 the Imperial Persian Customs received charge of the Persian Post Office postal system throughout the country; and in March 1904 they were and Trea- entrusted with the control of all treasuries and with the payment of s ^ r ^ s Pj ace( l official salaries^ etc.^ therefrom^ subject to proper administrative sanction, imperial 0 In April 1904 M. Dambrain^ Director-General of the Customs of the Persian Souths was received at Lingeh and Bandar ^Abbas with salutes of 7 Customs, guns^—an incontestable mark of the prestige that now attached to 1902-04. his office. Aggressive conduct of the Imperial Persian Customs, 1904. In 1904 the Imperial Persian Customs^ partly at the instigation of the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs,, who was believed to be acting on the advice of the Russian representative at Tehran^ and partly impelled -by professional zeal, embarked on a course of meddlesome activity that nearly provoked a political crisis. In the spring of 1904^ as related in the history of Trucial ^Oman, Jurisdiction they established posts on the Arab islands of Bu Musa and Tunb, where asserted over they lowered the Arab flag; and their occupation was only brought to B^ Musa, an end by British threats of forcible intervention. An attempt^ noticed Timb an ^ in the history of the Persian Coast^ was made about the same time to Shri. enforce complete control over the island of Sirri; but the opposition of Great Britain^ by whom the claim of Persia to the island was not admitted, prevented the establishment there of a regular customs post. In the course of the summer of 1904, a sustained effort was made Attempt to by the Department to obtain control of the sanitary administration of oust British the Persian Coast, especially at Bushehr, by gradually encroaching on s c a 0 n n ^ a 0 1 1 y 0n the authority of the British officers employed in the Persian sanitary * the pe rs ian service; but this endeavour, which is described in another Appendix, Coast, was frustrated by British diplomacy. In September 1904, as related in the histories of 'Arabistan and Interference Kuwait, to the alarm of the Shaikh of Muhammareh, who considered his executive authority to be invaded, and to the annoyance of the ryingarrag&gt; people of Kuwait, who were the principal sufferers, the Mozafter was posted at the mouth of the Shatt-al-'Arab and began to search vessels for rifles and ammunition and to seize those possessing any, even for self-defence against pirates ; the methods employed were so vexatious that the Government of India were constrained to protest against them. Towards the end of 1904 a customs post was established on H^iijam EsUblkh- Island, apparently as a counter-move to the reopening of the British custo gt telegraph station there. This step it was clearly withm the rights of on Hanj , m&lt; the Persian Government to take; but much opposition on the part of the Arab inhabitants of the island was provoked, and the local situation continued critical until 1905. ~ # gee the Appendix on Epidemics and Sanitary Organisation, page 2517,— Interference with British mails at Bushehr, 2606 The new anti-British policy of the Customs Administration culminated in an attack, in the autumn of 1904, on the privileges of the British Indian Post Office at Bushehr. The question appears to have been raised at Tehran by M. Lavers, a young and indiscreet Secretary- General of Customs belonging properly to the Postal Department, during the absence of the more tactful M. Naus; it^ was made possible by certain articles of the new Reglement Douanier ; and it may have been prompted by a desire on the part of Customs, who had now been for more than two years in cnarge of the Persian Post Office, to get rid of a rival institution. In 1900, shortly after the introduction of the Imperial Customs regime at Bushehr, an arrangement had been reached by the British Political Resident and the Director-General of Customs at Bushehr in regard to the British post office there. Under this arrangement the contents of the mail bags were examined by the British postmaster and the parcels addressed to persons exempt from payment of customs duty were immediately delivered, after which a list of the parcels received foi non-exempted persons was sent to the Director-General of Customs, who had them fetched from the Residency and arranged for their distribution to the addressees on payment of customs duty. The responsibility for preventing dishonest practices was thus thrown chiefly on the British postmaster. In 1900 the Director-General had agreed to recog nise as exempted persons not only the Resident and his Assistants, the Residency Surgeon and officers of the Royal^ Navy and of the Royal Indian Marine, but also the Residency clerical staff ce of superioi service.^ M. Layers, in challenging these privileges, took his stand on the Reglement Douanier of 1904 and claimed that by virtue of Articles 51 and 27, to which as to the rest of the Reglement ^ the assent of Great Britain had been given, he was entitled to require that mail bags con taining letters only should be handed over to the Persian Post Office, and that the parcel post should be taken straight from the ship to the customs office. He also contended that, while diplomatic and consular immunities must be respected, exemptions of any other sort, of Hospital Assistants employed on quarantine, were not permissible. Mr. Grant-Duff, British Charge d' Affaires at Tehran, argued that the ancient privileges of the British-Indian Post Office could not be with drawn without the assent of the British Legation and the ordeis of the Persian Government ^ and he believed that he had succeeded, at an interview held on the 24th of November 1904, in persuading M. Lavers to await the result of a reference which had been made to the Govern ment of India. But such was not the case. On the 1st of December 1904, the sepoy guard at Bushehr, having been sent as usual to fetch the Residency mails, were detained at the customs house ; Captain Trevor, the Assistant Political Resident, then went to the spot himself for the purpose of removing the mails ; but M. Waffelaert, the Officiating Director-General, caused the gates to be closed and took possession of ten cases and six bags belonging to the Residency. Mr. Grant-Duff immediately applied to the Persian Government for restitution of the mails and informed the Mushir-ud-Dauleh, Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, that he had2607 v Assisi instructed the ReBident to resist by force any further tampering- with the British mails. The mail which had been seized was returned on the 8th of December at the British post office by M. Wagner, the Assistant to the Director-General of Customs^ in person. Eventually it was arranged at Tehran that an official of the Imperial Persian Customs should in future be present at the opening of the mail bags in the Residency post office^ and that parcels for persons other than British exempted persons should be sent to the customs house for declaration and^ if necessary, examination; and the privilege of exemp tion from customs duty was at the same time withdrawn from the Residency Surgeon and the Extra Assistant Resident. At Muham- mareh, where also trouble had occurred, a similar regime was adopted by agreement. The subsequent course of matters is described in the Appendix on Mail Communications and the British Indian Post Office in the Persian Gulf. Progress of the Imperial Persian Customs in the Persian Gulf.* At the end of 1904 a customs post was successfully established on Establish- the island of Kharag in the jurisdiction of the recalcitrant Khan of ment and Hayat Davud: an earlier attempt, made in October 1904, had been removal of foiled by the expulsion of the customs officials by the Khan immediately P 08 ^* after the departure of the steamer in which they arrived. A number of new posts, as will be seen from the tables at the end of this Appen dix, were opened in 1904 and 1905. In October 1905 a customs house was set up at Laz on the island of Shaikh Shu^aib, on which a provi sional post had existed since the preceding February. Also in October 1905, inland examining posts which had been placed at Godar Balutak and Daliki on the Nasiri-Isfahan and Bushehr-Shiraz roads, respectively, were removed, the explanation given was that they were no longer required, but the real causes of their abolition were probably the com plaints of merchants and muleteers, from whom the guards did not fail to extort money, and the representations of the British Legation at Tehran. The abolition of Rahdari and other harassing taxes, under a decree Abolition of obtained by M. Naus, known as the Law of 9th Zilhajjeh 1318,t and RahdSri and also under the Reglement of 1904, has now been partially carried out, other vexa- in spite of the covert resistance of Persian officials. In May 1904, however, Rahdari was still being forcibly levied on the road from Bandar 'Abbas to Bam; and in the following year the Shu'-as-Saltaneh, Governor-General of Ears, continued to derive large profits from illicit dues upon the Bushehr-Shiraz road.

A threat that compensation would be claimed on account of the exactions of the Shir'-as-Saltaneh resulted in the discontinuance of Rahdari on the ^1900 Bushehr-Shiraz road in October 1905; but other abuses continued. Caravans remained liable to the extortions of the Tufangchis or road guards, to whom the privilege of ' protecting ^ the road was generally let for high sums by the Persian authorities, the amount obtained in this manner for the Burazjan section of the Bushehr-Shiraz road amounting in 1905 to 500 Tumans ; and travellers were still compelled to purchase their supplies at extortionate rates from the official 'Alafdan M01 or Ambar-i-^Alaf at each halting-place, 1 -1902 General results of the reorganisation of the Persian Customs. 12 -1903 The general results to Persia of the reorganisation of the Customs service have been, on the whole, highly creditable to M. Naus and his Belgian assistants. Expansion of From the fiscal standpoint the reforms were altogether satisfactory ? revenue. for they resulted in a large increase of revenue to the state, due prin cipally to an average enhancement of the rates and to more systematic collection, but partly also to other causes. Under the ancient method of leasing the customs of the country by provinces, a competitive reduc- 1503 -1904 tion of dues sometimes took place in two adjacent customs divisions, e.g., Bushehr and Kirmanshah, with the consequence that, when the contracts were again sold, lower bids for both had to be accepted by low 1905 the Government. Again, payment of customs duty in specie was now obligatory, whereas formerly customs lessees hadbeen won^t to discharge as much as two-thirds of their liabilities to Government in State bills, which in the open market only fetched from 50 to 70 per cent, of their face value.

The full benefit of the new tariff began to be reaped in tbis year. Business generally was depressed by cholera in Persia and by the Russo-Japanese war ; and receipts in the Gulf were reduced by the diversion of tea imports from the Gulf to the Caucasus route in consequence of operations by the Russian S. N. and T. Co. There was an exten sive failure of the opium crop in Persia; while in the Gulf the diversion of tea in creased, and evasion of duty was general.2610 Other econo mic reforms, Unavoidable difficulties experienced by the Department. In 1906-1907, in consequence of tlie political troubles whicli agitated Persia during the year, the prestige and authority of the customs suffered, and the receipts for the first six months were less by 69,000 Tumans than those of the preceding year. Notwithstanding the abolition of octroi and Rahdari, the general suppression of export duties, and unfavourable political conditions by which progress was retarded, the net yield of the Persian Customs during the first seven years of partial or complete reorganisation stood in a proportion of 31 : 14 to the receipts of the seven years immediately preceding. Various other advantages of a non-fiscal character, but none the less real, were attained under the change of system. By the abolition of the arbitrarily collected octroi and Rahdari and by the consequent equalisation of customs duty to all, Persian merchants were placed for the first time on the same footing as their European rivals, and trade received a great impetus. The abolition of export duty on many kinds of merchandise still further stimulated commercial activity. In 1907 it was calculated that the foreign trade of Northern Persia had increased within the last few years by 80 per cent., while the actual, as distin guished from the apparent, increase, in Southern Persia between 1903-1904 and 1905-1906 was estimated at not less than 20 per cent. The growth of exports was specially remarkable, for while imports had increased by 68f per cent, exports had risen by no less than 99 per cent.; and, whereas in 1900-01 the proportion of exports to imports was only 36 to 64, in 1905-06 it stood at 44 to 56. The progress described above was achieved in the face of unusual difficulties,—chiefly the powerlessness of the Persian Government in parts of the country, defects in the administrative system, the interest of local authorities in contraband operations, and the existence of great geographical facilities for smuggling. All these unfavourable conditions were present in a high degree in the Persian Gulf region. In many places custom houses either could not be established at all, or, when established, were unable to fulfil their functions; and contempts of the authority of Customs officers, and even violent resistance^ to their proceedings, were of common occurrence. The coast districts of the Gulf were divided between the administrations of the Shaikh of Muham- mareh, the Governor of the Gulf Ports, and the Governors-General of Fars and Kirman, which in some localities were intermingled ; and the result was an almost entire absence of uniform and successful action along the coast from Muhammareh to Gwatar, for each administrator was indiffer ent to what happened in the jurisdiction of his neighbour. The Khans of Rud-hilleh, Tangistan, Dashti and Gaih were deeply implicated in ^ the contraband trade and even maintained customs houses of their own, especially the Khan of Rud-hilleh, who was said to guarantee the safety of goods landed under his auspices against capture by the Customs until they should have reached Khushab. The results of these ' frauds/'' as they were officially styled, or rather of this open defiance of the Customs, were often very marked; thus at Rig, where the Khans had been granted compensation for the loss of the customs at the rate of 5,000 Tumans a year, the amount collected never equalled this annual allow ance ; in Tangistan smuggling was so rife that tea there sold 40 per cent, cheaper than in the neighbouring town of Bushehr; at Minab.40' ii 2611 where a yearly indemnity of 7^000 Tumans was paid to the local autho rities; the yield of the post was considerably less ; and in Makran the Khans derived a revenue estimated at 20,000 Tumans a year from a large illicit importation of rifles alone. From Masqat, Bahrain, and Kuwait, cargoes of the more highly taxed articles, especially arms and ammuni tion, tea, spices and indigo, were run over to the Persian side and were landed either clandestinely at ports where there were custom houses or openly at others where there were none; indeed, in the eyes of the Imperial Persian Customs, Bahrein and Kuwait, were simply large contraband depots and by that Department the growth of their trade was regarded with deep suspicion. In addition to these obstacles, for the existence of which the organisers of the Imperial Persian Customs were not responsible, there were others which arose out of their own methods. The rates of duty on certain articles were, under the tariff of 1903, pitched so high as to afford a positive inducement to smuggling; and the procedure established by the Heglement of 1904 was too complicated and inelastic for an Oriental state such as Persia. Latterly some of the officials of the Department have shown themselves disposed to admit that a simple universal rate of only 8 per cent, on all goods imported would probably Id crease the revenue, besides making the smuggler's trade unprofitable and removing many other difficulties; but much is expected, in regard to the suppression of contraband trade, from the sea-going launches which have been constructed or ordered at Bombay. Incidental results of the reorganisation of the Persian Customs. The regime of the Imperial Customs has borne somewhat hardly Decline of on the once flourishing port of Lingeh in consequence of its being a port of transit, to the conditions of which the regulations of the new department are not well adapted. In 1900 and 1901^ the tiade of Lingeh was considerately handled ; but about the beginning of 1902 a transhipment duty of i Qran per package and a special duty of ? Qran on each package landed and re-exported withm 20 days were imposed, and full export duty was levied when the period of 20 days was exceeded. The time allowed for re-exportation was too short and the duties to which food stuffs became liable on its expiration were crushing : thus, at the beginning of 1902, rice and ghee were subject to an export duty of 10 per cent., and wheat and barley to one of 15 per cent., although the bulk of these commodities, having been re ceived from India, had already paid an import duty of 5 per cent. In March 1902, no less than 15,000 bags of Indian imports, destined tor Arab ports, were lying uncleared at the Lmgeh customs house and. already some steamers had accepted freights direct from India for Dibai and Lingeh merchants had sent orders for their sailing craft, then loading in India, to run straight to the Arab Coast without calling at Lingeh. Eventually the export of the 15,000 bags was permitted duty-free; but the confidence of merchants had received a shock from which it has m a transit, 1902-07 !2612 Inconve nience in regard to gnppliea for British Government vesBels 1902-07. not since recovered; and the prosperity of Lingeli was, in 1907, still declining'. The transit trade of Lingeh has now, in a large measure, passed to Dibai, notwithstanding the inferiority of both the climate and anchorage there, and the transference bids fair to be permanent; indeed Dibai may even be said to have become the port of transhipment— by smugglers—for Lingeh itself. The rules relating to the transhipment and exportation of provision have been a cause of some inconvenience to ships of the Royal N avy and Royal Indian Marine. Since July 1902 duty at one per cent, ad valorem has been charged on coal placed on board ship from depots on shore. No import duty being levied on coal, this tax is regarded by the Imperial Customs as one on transhipment rather than on re-exportation. In December 1901 the Customs at Bushehr began, contrary to old- established usage, to levy a duty of 5 per cent, on all goods sent from shore on board British men-of-war in the harbour ; many of these, being supplies imported from India, had already paid duty at 5 per cent. In March 1902 the rate was raised to 10 per cent.; and in November 1902, this duty of 10 per cent, on other supplies being still maintained, one of 20 per cent, was placed on livestock for ships. At length it appeared that these duties, were claimed not by way of customs, but as a a taxe de dispense ' or the price of exemption from the prohibition—at this time almost permanent—against the exportation of food stuffs and livestock from Persia. The innovation was contested, without success, during 1903, and in 1904* the ' taxe de dispense' was regularly established, its amount being fixed at 10 per cent, on both cattle and cereals; ^ but the rightfulness of the charge has not been admitted by the British Government, and correspondence on the subject still continues (1907). In June 1903 customs duty was claimed for the first time on rations imported from India for the British military detachment at Jashk, and has since been paid under protest both there and at Chahbar; a refund has, however, been claimed by the British political authorities, ^nd the matter is not yet settled (1907). The British. Government and the Customs of Southern Persia. Britiah connection with the Cnstoms ol Southern Persia. Of greater importance however, at least to the British Government, than the administrative success or failure of the reorganisation of the Persian Customs is the question whether those of the Gulf are liable to be hypothecated to a European power in return for a loan; and the position in this respect must now be stated. Great Britain has always possessed a special interest in the custom of Southern Persia; a loan of £500,000, raised in London in 1892, to enable the Persian Government to pay off compensation payable to the (British) Imperial Tobacco Corporation on account of the concellation of their concession, was secured upon them, and for that reason bore interest at the favourable rate of 6 per cent.; while, as we have seen, a2613 British bank^ in connection with another loan, actually controlled the Bushehr customs for some months in 1898. Furthermore, in connection with a Russian loan proposed in 1892 for the purpose of enabling the Persian Government to discharge their liability to the Tobacco Corpora tion, the British Minister of Tehran, under orders from His Majesty's Grovernment, informed the Persian Government that any act by which the Shah might hand over to a foreign Government his control over the customs revenue of the southern ports of Persia would be an alienation of his sovereign rights to which the British Government would be justified in objecting, and that a formal protest would be entered by them against any such proceeding. In 1897, in the course of discussions relating to a proposed Persian Assurance loan in Europe, the Hon'ble C. Hardinge, the British Charge d' Affaires at Tehran, acting under instructions from Lord Salisbury, was successful Governmen t in obtainino* a written assurance* from the Mushir-ud-Dauleh, Minister i n regard to for Foreign Affairs, that the Customs of Southern Persia (or rather, the Customs perhaps, certain of them only) would never be plaoed under foreign supervision or control; this pledge, which was dated the 23rd of October 1897 and was subsequently communicated by Mr. Hardinge to the Dutch Charge d'Afiaires at Tehran, has formed ever since a principal bulwark of british interests in Southern Persia against Russian designs. In the course of the negotiations which led up to the conclusion of the Russian Loan Agreement of 190 ii , repeated reference was made to this Guarantee by the British Minister at Tehran, and a copy of it was formally communicated to the Sadr-i-Azam at his request in December 1899 Meanwhile, in March 1899, the question had been again discussed between the British Legation and the Shah's Government on the basis of its including all, and not only some, of the Customs of Southern Persia. Later, however, perhaps through inadvertence, the discussion had come to turn on the customs of 'the ports on the Persian Gulf.' When the Russian Loan Agreement of 1900 was published, it meaning of appeared that the security for this first Russian loan consisted of the th t customs of the whole of Persia except those of Fars and the Peisian ' Gust.,m S cf Gulf', and that, in case of default in repayment of pnncipalorin Southern ^ payment of interest by due date, control mig c assum y 'Customj of Banque d'Escompte—an Agency of the Russian fetate Ba Kar^ and the the customs hypothecated. Immediately a doubt arose whether the tWan customs of ' Fars and the Persian Gulf ' must necessarily be legar Gulf, 1900. as identical with those of Southern Persia; or whether the Persian Government, in violation of the pledge of 1897, had m effect agreed to the contingent control by Russia of the customs of a part of Southern Persia not covered by the phrase ' Fars and the Persian Gulf. taken The first place brought specifically to notice 1 e in to safeguard customs of which it was proposed at the beginning of 1900 to place m t]ieri ^ of customs ot wrnon F £ ld be ascertamed) Muham- Bl . itain charge of a Belpan offioer. bo ta custom houBes pl edged to unl.r the ri,rd cul™, tb.u g ht th.t xu of j — — 1897. * The text of this written assurance is reproduced in Annexnre No, 3 to this Appendix.2614 it must be considered a port of the Persian Gulf; but the Persian Government could not be induced to state definitely whether in ^ their opinion the Muhammareh customs were, or were not, included in the security for the Russian loan. They sought in fact to avoid the ^ dis cussion ; and they obviously suspected that the object of the British Minister was to obtain an admission which would give the British Government a right of interference at Muhammareh, and which would create a recognised British sphere of influence in that region. In 1902, on the conclusion of a second Russian loan, the Persian Government were reminded that Britain could not recognise the inclusion of any of the customs of Southern Persia in the guarantee, but they did not reply to the British communication. On the separation, in 1903, of the Customs of 'Arabistan from those administered by the Director-General at Bushehr, the British Minister at Tehran, under orders from the Foreign Office, once more sought to obtain a statement from the Persian Government as to the inclusion ^ or non-inclusion of the 'Arabistan Customs in those of Pars and the Persian Gulf; but the answer obtained was evasive. In 1904 the Persian Government expressed their inability to alter or even to interpret, the conditions of the two Russian loan contracts without the assent of Russia; but they formally admitted that in signing these contracts there was no intention on their part of prejudicing the assurance given to the British Government in 1897 regarding the Customs of Southern Persia. Note having been taken by the Foreign Office of this admission, the Persian Government were told that their reply was in other respects unsatisfactory, and that His Majesty s Government held them bound by the assurance of 1897, which was anterior to the Russian loan agreements; His Majesty's ^ Government could not admit a solitary exception from the assurance in the case of Muhammareh aud its dependencies, or of any of the ports of 'Arabistan, and they would take the necessary steps to ensure respect for their rights in the event of any attempt on the part of the Persian Govern ment to ignore them. A note to this effect was handed to the Mushir- ud-Dauleh on the 31st of August 1904 by Sir A. Hardinge and was read aloud in his presence by the Persian Minister, who took no excep- ^ tion to its substance ; no formal reply, however, was demanded, and none was received, by the British Government. In signing the R^glement Douanier on the 29th of August 1904, Sir A. Hardinge was careful to put in a declaration, of which act was taken by M. Naus as Minister of Customs, on the subject of the South ern Customs. This declaration stated that the Reglement was signed on behalf of Great Britain subject to the reserve that the customs division now denominated ' The South ' should not be held to be alone subject to the assurance of the 23rd October 1897, and that the assurance in question should not be regarded as in any way affected or limited by the administrative distinction drawn in the Reglement between the customs of the South and those of 'Arabistan. That Muhammareh is a port of the Persian Gulf, and that its customs therefore cannot in any circumstances be pledged to Russia, appears to be indisputable. The Hydrographer of the British Admiralty2615 has stated that Muhammareli^ being situated on a tidal river and being accessible to ships navigating the Persian Gulf^ must be regarded as a Q^bar and port of that sea. In a list of Persian post offices supplied by the Persian Q wa t iar ar e Government to the International Bureau at Berne in August 1903^ the situated in post office of Muhammareh appears under the heading ' Golfe Persique.' the Persian Finally in the Reglement Douanier of 1904, framed by the Persian and ^un accepted by the Russian Government^ in the remarks on the customs post at Muhammareh the words occur—' arriving from another post in the Persian Gulf/'' Jashk, Chahbar, and Gwatar are similarly covered by the wording of the post office statement and of the Reglement Douanier. The immunity of the Customs of other places in Southern Persia from Russian control still depends^ in cases where their situation within the limits of ' Ears and the Persian Gulf ' is doubtful^ on the indefinite but comprehensive pledge given by the Persian Government in 1897. In conclusion it may be mentioned that a loan of £2(00^000 by the (British) Imperial Bank of Persia^ dated 4th April 1903 ; and a supple mentary loan of £100,000, dated 1st September 1904, are both secured, in the first place, upon the revenues of the Caspian Sea fisheries ; in the second, upon the revenues of the Posts and Telegraphs; and, finally, upon the customs of ' Fars and the Persian Gulf Precarious position of the reorganised Persian Customs, 1906-07. From the first the new Customs Department has had much prejudice Hostility and and interested opposition to encounter, while the mere fact of its being controlled by Europeans has placed an effective weapon in the hands of its adversaries. Incredible as it may seem, moreover, e Persian Government have shown themselves almost indifferent to the brilliant results attained. In September 1904, M Naus was actually in danger of losing his appointment, for which theNizam-us-Saltaneh had offered £40,000 ; and in 1906 his position had become so difficu on account of the general unpopularity which he had incurred that he tendered his resignation; but it was not accepted by the Sh h. 1 1905, in consequence of the strictness of M. Heynssens, the Director-General of Customs at Ilushehr, who insisted at first on oo signees appearing in person to declare their goo s, w o visi penalty the sliihtest discrepancy between invoices and goods ^ ^o tried to prohibit the use of private wharves, a serious agita^ aro^ at Bushehr in which Mullas as well as native merchants paiticipatea, whik even European firms complained through on the necessary concessions being made, the trouble again subsided.

Naus and his Belgian Officials, 1906-07. Dismissal of M. Naus, 1907. M. Nans had already sounded the Belgian market, but unsuccessfully, under a Russian guarantee. Capable, energetic and ambitious, he had gradually brought the whole financial system of the country under his control; he made no concealment of his power; and it was expected that he would be employed, in September 1906, to represent Persia in certain financial negotiations at St. Petersburg. The Persian Govern ment, however, made suspicious by the anxiety of Russia that he should be sent, declined to nominate him. On the 7th of October 1906 the new Persian Assembly began its sittings at Tehran; and M. Naus and his subordinates were at once made objects of attack by a party headed by the Sa'ad-ud-Dauleh. The charges against M. Naus were, mainly, that he had been guilty of corruption and extortion and had amassed a large private fortune by improper means; that he had provided too many appointments, upon large salaries, for Belgians ; and that, in the selection of native employes, he had favoured Armenians at the expense of Muhammadans. With regard to the first of these accusations it was subsequently stated, on the authority of a high Persian ofiicial, that there were no grounds for believing M. Naus to have committed malversations, but that for three years he had rendered no formal accounts, and that it was difficult to verify or arrange the papers which he had submitted. The Assembly, notwithstanding the opposition of a moderate section who were aware of the value of M. Naus's services, now yielded to popular clamour and opened a campaign against the Customs Department enquiring whether M. Naus was a responsible minister and pointing out that thei Customs, Treasury, Post Office, and Mint were now under his contro but that, when information in regard to these branches of the administration was demanded by the Assembly, M. Naus did not appear, while the Minister for Finance professed himself merely an accountant and stated that M. Naus was not under his control. Finally the Assembly insisted that a li^u of responsible ministers should be furnished; the Sadr-i-A'zam complied; and the name of M, Naus was not found in the list. The Assembly were now in a position to require that M. Naus, not being a minister, should be deprived of his title as such and of his powers of control. The Shah reluctantly submitted and removed M. Naus from the ministry, and M. Priem. from the Director-Generalship of Customs. This change took place, apparently, on the 9th of February 1907, less than a month after M. Naus had been confirmed in his position and his powers extended by the new Shah. No decided action was takert by any of the foreign Legations at Tehran, not even by those of Belgium or Russia, and the future of the Persian Imperial Customs was plunged into uncertainty.

The five highest posts in the South, namely the Director-Generalship, Inspectorship and Comptrollership at Bushehr and the Directorships at Lingeh and Bandar •'Abbas, are at present occupied by members of the Belgian Customs Service, who have been seconded and placed at the disposal of the Persian Government by the Government of Belgium; the initial contracts with the Persian Government of these and of the other Belgian Officers in the Department were for three years, and were renewable, at expiration, for either three or five years. All the other superior appointments in the South are held by Persians, who have the rank of Directors and are styled Mudirs. The subordinate grades of Farrash or civil orderly, of Mustahfiz or watchman, of Kashikchi or night watchman, and of Tufangchi or armed guard are filled by natives. The Tufangchis fluctuate in number according to the season of the year, and are frequently changed; they are mostly recruited at Bushehr and in Baluchistan. The staff of each minor post consists of a Mudir, lower in rank than a Director, having under him two or more subordinates. Mere observation posts are manned by one or more watch men or Tufangchis, who are under orders of the nearest Mudir. In some ports and on some stretches of coast—especially in the districts of Rud-hilleh and Tangistan, and of Persian Makran from Jashk to Chahbar—the Customs have been unable as yet to establish their system, owing to the opposition of local chiefs who refuse to part with the farm of the customs and cannot at present be coerced. In these localities the customs duties are levied according to the ancient methods, and arms and other prohibited articles find their way into the country. Control of the coast line is maintained, so far as possible, by the Customs vessel 'Mozaffar' and the Persian man-of-war ' Persepolis,' supplemented by the launches constructed at Bombay. An experiment was tried, in 1905 or 1906, of watching the coast between Lingeh and Bandar ^Abbas by means of mounted patrols ; it was not successful on account of the unsuitability of the country to horses, but it was intended to repeat it with the substitution of camels for horses.

The preliminary arrangements for the tour were begun in August 1903, and shortly afterwards the formal approval of His Majesty^s Government was sought and obtained. Departure from Karachi and voyage to Masqat, 16tli to ISth November 1903. The R.I.M.S. ' Hardinge^, carrying the Viceroy, started from Karachi harbour shortly before 5 p.m . on Monday, the 16th of Novem ber; as she passed Manorah a land battery fired a salute of 31 guns. Lord Curzon was accompanied by Her Excellency Lady Curzon. The East Indies squadron under Rear-Admiral Atkinson-Willes, specially strengthened for the cruise by the addition of H.M .S. a Argonaut^, a first class cruiser of 11,000 tons then on her way from the China station to England, was lying in readiness off the entrance of the harbour; on the approach of the ' Hardinge ' it was formed in columns of divisions line ahead, the starboard division consisting of the flagship H.M .S. ' Hyacinth second class cruiser, with the third class cruiser, u Pox^, two cables astern, while the port division was composed of H.M .S. 'Argonaut' abeam of the flagship, followed by H.M .S.

The ships, which had dressed with masthead flags on the arrival of the * The principal authorities are the official records of the Government of India in the Political Department and the letters of newspaper correspondents which appeared in the English ' Times ' of the 28th and 29th December 1903 and of the 2nd, 5th, 11th, 12th and 18th January 1904, and in the Indian 'Pioneer' of the 22nd and 26th Novem ber and of the 2iid, 6th and 9th December 1903. The writer has also drawn up his pornonal recollections of the cruise, and the article has been revised by Sir L. l)ane who accompanied the tour as {Secretary in the Foreign Department.v 2627 Viceroy in Karachi, were now manned, guards were paraded, the bands played the National Anthem, and, as the Hardinge 33 steamed to the front between the divisions, each vessel saluted her with 31 guns. The (( Hardinge' preceded the squadron till nightfall and then took up a station astern, where she remained until Masqat was neared. The sea was smooth, and the relative positions of the ships were so admirably maintained that the lights of the squadron as seen by the night from the deck of the ' Hardinge ' presented an apparently stationary pageant. Throughout the cruise, both at sea and in port, the ships were dressed with masthead flags during the hours of daylight, The visit to Masqat, 18th and 19th November/ Soon after sunrise on the 18th of November the coast of Oman was sighted,—'an apparently unbroken line of precipitous cliffs, rising diaphanous and opalescent out of the pale blue waters of the Indian Ocean/' It had originally been intended to strike the coast in the vicinity of Ras-al'Hadd and follow it to JMasqat, but time did not admit of this, and a direct course was accordingly shaped for Masqat, where the R.I.M.S. ' Lawrence' with Colonel KembalJ, British Eesident in the Persian Gulf, and UM.S. a Lapwing' were already lying. As the squadron entered the harbour at 10-30 a.m . the flagship greeted the port with a salute of ^1 guns which was returned, gun for gun, by one of the Sultan's batteries ; and, as soon as the ships had taken up their billets, a salute of 31 guns was fired by the land batteries as a welcome to His Excellency the Viceroy. The white town in gala array formed a strange contrast with the grim cliffs by which it was encircled, a contrast that found its counterpart in the resplendent hulls of the ' Hardinge and ' Lawrence 33 , backed as they were by thtf dark line of warships lying across the entrance of the harbour. A deputation from the Sultan shortly arrived on board the « Harding-e ' • it included the Sultan's elder half-brother Saiyid Muham- mad, the Sultan's eldest son, Saiyid Taimur, by whom the State of 'Oman had been represented at the Delhi Coronation Darbar, the Com- mandant of His Highness's land forces, and the Governor of Matrah A metrical welcome in Arabic was read by one of the deputation, of whxch the translation ran as follows : The welcome and auspicious tidings have reached me, and I have been cheered with deep andlmpWe happiness at the arrival of His Exalted and Noble Excellency Lord Curzon. ., At his coming the suns of joy and gladness have risen and the moons of happiness and good cheer have shed their light.

Visits of the French and American Vice-Consuls -i Visit of Lord Curzon to the British Agency. After inquiries as to His Excellency^ health the deputation again withdrew, under a salute of 13 guns, specially awarded at the Sultan's request in consideration of their exalted rank. As soon as the deputation had reached the shore, His Highness Faisal-bin-Turk i embarked in person to visit the Viceroy, accompanied by his suite and by Major Cox, the British Political Agent at Masqat. After steaming in a launch round the entire squadron and acknowledging the compliments of the crews of His Majesty's ships, the Sultan was received on board the ' Hardinge ' and conducted to His Excellency's presence on the quarter-deck, where a state reception room had been fitted up and decked with gold-worked carpets and handsome embroideries. Greetings were exchanged and a short conversation took place, after which the members of the Sultan's suite were severally presented to the Viceroy. Eefreshments were then served, and a few moments later the Sultan took his departure under a salute of 21 guns fired by H.M.S. ' Fox.' Between noon and one o'clock the Vice-Consuls of France and America at Masqat, M. Laronce and Mr. Mackirdy, proceeded on board the a Har- dinge ' to pay their respects to the Viceroy; they were accorded separate interviews and received the salutes of their rank at their departure. At about 1-30 p.m ., Lord Curzon left the ' Hardinge' under a Vice regal salute, the ships of the squadron being at the same time dressed nd manned, and landed with Eear-Admiral Atkinson-Willes and staff at a jetty which had been specially erected at the Customs wharf; here he was received by Colonel Kemball and Major Cox, and from this spot the Viceregal party walked—by a narrow, but carpeted and gaily decor ated street— through the Indian quarter to the British Agency building, where they were entertained at lunch by the Political Agent. The Sultan's palace, his steamer the a Nur-al-Bahr ' and the forts of Jalali and Mirani were profusely decorated with flags ; and at the Sultan's desire, in order to symbolise the community of interests and sentiment between the Gov ernments of Britain and 'Oman, the flagstaffs of his palace and the British Agency had been linked together by a graceful arc of bunting 300 yards in length. After lunch a deputation representing the different classes of British subjects and proteges residing in 'Oman, principally Indian Muhamma- dans, Hindus, Parsis and Goanese, waited upon the Viceroy in a verandah of the Agency with an address which was read in English by Mr. Par- shotam Uhanji, member of a Masqat firm of Hindu merchants. The address, which was presented in a silver casket of local design and manu facture, representing an Arab, a date tree and a camel, ran as follows :— May it please Your ^Excellency^ —We, the entire community of British subjects, both Hindu and Muhammadan, and other British protected persons, settled in the towns of Masqat and Matrah,* most respectfully beg, on behalf of ourselves and onr feliow- snhjects residing in other parts of His Highness the Sultan's dominions to offer Your Excellencies a most heartfelt welcome on the occasion of your visit to Masqat. In doing so, we venture to congratulate Your Excellency, with much respect, on being the first Viceroy and Governor-General of India, since the passing cf the destinies of the Indian Continent to the British Crown, to visit these distant shores, and to have thus inaugurated a new and vigorous political departure in a sphere where so many Indian interests are involved ; and it has been a source of enhanced gratification * In this and in the other citations contained in the present Appendix the spelling of proper names has been altered so as to agree with that used elsewhere in the Gazetteer.io us to know that, since Your Excellency's happy decision to accept an extension of your term of office (a decision which has been received by all classes of His Majesty the King-Emperor's subjects with lively satisfaotion), the first great act of policy which Tour Excellency has undertaken has been this most auspicious tour in the Gulfs of 'Oman and Persia. Accustomed, as the races peopling these shores are, to take impressions from out ward appearances, we cannot but feel confident that this happy undertaking will prove to be an epoch-making event in the progress and enhancement of British prestige and influence. It will serve, too, as an abiding demonstration to the inhabitants of the littoral that the preponderating influence of Great Britain in these waters is no shadowy or remote force but a lively and dignified reality, and that the Viceroy of the King-Emperor, who holds benevolent sway over the millions of the vast continent of British India, watches with no less zeal and keen interest the welfare of His Most Gracious Majesty's subjects scattered all over the Gulf. Except to give Your Excellencies a respectful and hearty welcome and to give ex pression to our loyalty and devotion to the Great Government whose subjects we are, we have little cause to trespass on Your Excellency's time, and, so far as our own local and particular needs and circumstances are concerned, have an encouraging tale to tell. We enjoy in Masqat the rights and privileges of the most favoured nation; our interests are carefully guarded by our Consular authorities ; and we experience complete toleiation in matters of religion. There is an absence of unnecessary litigation amongst us British subjects ; and justice is readily and promptly obtainable in the Agency Court. In matters connected with our dealings! with the natives of 'Oman, while we are aecustomed to receive a courteous hearing from His Highness, neverthless we often ex perience difficulty in obtaining relief; and this is partly owing, no doubt, to the unset tled state of the interior. In this latter connection we make bold to explain to Your Excellency that whereas, considering the degree of enlightenment among the Bedouin Arabs, inter-tribal strife and turbulence are within the nature of things, and when they are limited to the interior of the country do not immediately affect our welfare any more than that of other peaceable members of the community, nevertheless, when as is sometimes the case, the scene of the strife is transferred to the coast ports, or their immediate neighbourhood, our commercial interests do immediately suffer, and we are put to anxiety for the safety of the lives and properties of our fellow-subjects. For, as Your Excellency is aware, in many of the coast towns of 'Oman (often far removed from the capital) small communities of British Indian subjects reside, in whose hands all the local trade is centred, and who, in however humble a capacity^ are the pioneers of British Indian commerce in these waters. Thanks to the vigilant activity of successive Political Agents, and men-of-war, at seasons of unrest, there is perhaps little actual danger to the lives and properties of these our fellow-subjects ; but the detriment to their trading operations and ours is great, and we venture to hope that Your Excellency's Government will see its way, either by strengthening tha hands of the Euler, or by active interference on the coast, where necesuary for^ the preservation of British interests, to take measures which will deter the nnmly tribes men of 'Oman from disturbing the commerce of the country by their dissensions. In matters of commerce generally we continue to prosper, and, though during the last few years signs have not been wanting of foreign competition, Indian imports rule the market. There is one depressing factor, however, of comparatively recent growth to which we make bold to draw Your Excellency's benevolent attention, and that is the de moralising fluctuations in the silver exchange. Since the closing of the Indian mints in 1898, and the consequent fall in the price of silver, the local dollar exchange has not ceased to exhibit remarkable fluctu ations, which greatly prejudice and impede the local import trade, from the fact that the currency value of the rupee is fixed, and that of the Masqat dollar is not. We therefore humbly commend the matter to Your Excellency's wise consideration, in the hope that, in co -operation with the Local Government, some means may be devised of bringing about a better state of things. In conclusion,- we beg to reiterate our welcome and to assure you that this visit of Your Excellency and your gifted consort will be a landmark in the history of Masqat, and will live green in our memories ; and it is our earnest prayer to the2630 Supreme Being, in whose hands the destinies of us all lie, to vouchsafe to Yout Excelleucy a continuance of bodily health and strength to enable you to render further great services to the Empire, and to bind fresh laurels on your brow. His Excellency replied in the following terms Lord Curzon's Gentlemen^li is with much pleasure hat 1 have received the loyal and well- speech. composed address which has just been read, and that on crossing the sea from India to the shores of another country I find a large and prosperous community of the subjects of His Majesty the King-Emperor existing and plying their trade here in conditions of security and contentment. I have made some attempt to ascertain the number of British Indian subjects who are thus to be found in Masqat and the other ports of 'Oman, and I find that they amount to no fewer than 1,300 persons, the majority of whom came originally, or come now, from the opposite shores of Sind and Kathiawar. The fact that these two coasts face each other at so inconsiderable a distance, and the well-known aptitudes of the particular communities that you represent, sufficiently explain the close mercantile connections that have grown np during the last century between Masqat and India, and leave one ^ in no surprise at the commercial predominance of Great Britain in the trade and shipping of this State. Gentlemen, the political stake of one country in another is sometimes measured by its commercial interests, but does not always lend itself readily to precise or mathematical definition. On the other hand, the commercial stake is more easily reduced to figures and calculations the effect of which is not open to dispute. I will take for instance the time in which I have been connected with the Government of India, namely, the last five years. When I find that during that period the British proportion of trade with the port of Masqat has averaged 84 per cent., and that of the total number of steamers that have entered and cleared from this port in the same time the average British percentage in each year has^ been 97, I am satisfied that the predominance of Great Britain in the mercantile interests of the State is supreme and incontestable, and I realise that in addressing you I am receiving a body of gentlemen who represent a not unimportant outpost of British commercial enter prise in the East, and whose labours have contributed, and still contribute, in no small degree to the material welfare of 'Oman. I am glad to hear from you that in the pursuit of these peaceful avocations your interests are safeguarded by the successive Political Agents—and by none I am sure more diligently than by Major Cox—who have been sent here to represent the Government of Indian that you obtain justice; that you abstain from litigation ; and that you enjoy complete religious tolerance. These conditions are all favourable to the success of your operations, and they leave you with little ground for complaints In one paragraph of your address you have spoken of tbe disturbances that sometimes spring up in the interior, and which occasionally travel down to the coast ports and affect the security of the places in which you reside, The British Govern ment have never embroiled themselves in this internal strife, which appears to be a hereditary legacy in 'Oman. But undoubtedly if it were to reach a point that seriously menaced the interests or imperilled the lives and property of British subjects lawfully trading upon the coast, we should feel called upon to intervene for their protection, and by no one, 1 am sure, would such intervention be more loyally wel comed, or more cordially assisted, than by His Highness. You have referred in your address to the depreciation in the local exchange. This is a matter which I will take into consideration. Gentlemen, I am obliged for the kind words in which you have welcomed me to Masqat. I understand that among those who present the address are representatives of other communities, such as the Portuguese of Goa, who enjoy British protection in this State. To all of you I wish a continuance of the conditions under which your trade exists and flourishes in 'Oman, and I rejoice that there has been presented to me the opportunity, while I am head of the Government of India, of testifying the interest which I feel in this outlying colony of Indian influence and trade. It only remains for me to thank you for presenting your address in a specimen of sliver work so characteristic of the tastes and customs of the locality. It will always be a memento to me of this agreeable meeting on the occasion of my present visit to Masqat,The next item in the programme was the return by the Viceroy of the visit which the Sultan had paid him on board the a Hardinge. - ' From the Agency Lord Curzon returned by boat to the jetty, where he was received by the Sultan in person, a guard of honour of 30 British marines with a band being also in attendance; the way from the ^ pier to the Sultanas palace lay along a street carpeted, sheltered by awnings, and completely lined by a guard of His Highnesses ^Askaris. At length the Viceroy and his staff on foot, individually conducted by the Sultan and his suite, reached the Barzah or audience chamber of the palace, a long room upon the sea-front with an elevated dais at one end upon which the two principal personages took their seats; the staff and suite lined the Walls, and in the body and at the further end of the hall Were accom modated some 70 or 80 Shaikhs and representative men, from various parts of the interior, who had been summoned to Masqat for the occasion. The room was adorned with inscriptions in English capitals upon coloured grounds expressive of friendship for the British Crown* As soon as formal greetings had been exchanged, the principal native ^ members of the assemblage Were brought forward and presented to the Viceroy by the Political Agent, and thereafter an Arabic address of welcome was read on behalf of the Sultan and was cordially ^ acknowledged by the Viceroy. Refreshments were next served, Saiyid Taimur, the heir-apparent, person ally Waiting upon the Viceroy. The harmony of the proceedings was at one moment slightly disturbed by the conduct of Saiyid Muham mad the Sultan's half-brother, who stood up and requested a private inter view with the Viceroy for the purpose of making a representation; it was understood that he wished to press his claims to succeed Saiyid Faisal, should the latter abdicate, in preference to Saiyid Taimur, but he was easilv pacified. At an interview with the Political Eesident and the Political Agent the next morning, Saiyid Muhammad pressed his claims to the succession ; but, when the weakness of his case Was explained_to him, he agreed to drop the matter. It should be noted that, at the^ Sultan s desire Saiyid Muhammad received precedence over Saiyid Taimur on all ceremonial occasions during the Viceroy's visit upon tbe ^round of hiB seniority in years. At the conclusion of the interview the Sultan con ducted Lord Curzon back to the pier, and the Viceroy returned on board the ' Hardinge 'at about 5 p.m . Motley crowds of Masqatis and 'Omanis from the interior thronged the beach and streets throughout the day and evinced both curiosity and friendliness. _ Meanwhile H. M. S. ' Sphinx' had arrived from Bushehr bringing Sir A. Hardinge, His Britannic Majesty's Minister at Tehran, wjo desired to confer with the Viceroy before his arrival on the Persian Coast. Tberc were now lying in the haAour six vessels of the Royal Navy, besides the 'HarLfe' and the « Lawrence, '-by far the most powerful sqtiadron that had ever flown the flag of a single power m the waters of Masqat. in the evening Their Excellencies gave a large dinner party on board the 'Hardinge,' to which Sir Arthur Hardinge, Rear-Admira Atkinson-Willes, the senior naval officers of the squadron, the local officers and the Consular representatives of France and America were invited,—in all about 70 persons; and about 60 additional guests attended a reception which was held after the dinner.

During and after the dinner the forts of Jalali and Mirani and the foreshore of the harbour were brilliantly illuminated with myriads of small lamps outlining the salient architectural features ; and, beginning at 9 p.m ., a display of fireworks was given from the high terraces of the two forts. This last exhibition was arranged by the British and Indian communities of Masqat and Matrah in honour of Lord Curzon's visit. The fleet also contributed to the magnificence of the spectacle, for, a whilst a network of coloured lanterns along the sea front and showers ' 'of rockets from the forts were reflected in tremulous lines of colour 0^'' 'the placid waters of the bay, the ships of the squadron suddenly stood ' ' ablaze against the deep blue sky, hulls and masts and funnels outlined in' ' fiery relief by the electrician's magic wand,—a vision of stately ' ' beauty and power which startled even the stolid impassiveness of the v ' Arabs into admiring awe.^ On the next day, the 19th of November, a great Darbar was held at 11-30 a.m . on board the ' Argonautwhose quarter-deck, ablaze with rich hangings and gold-embroidered carpets and draped with the flags of all nations, had been transformed into a splendid pavilion ; a raised dais on the poop was reserved for the chief participants in the ceremony; and, at the opposite end, the elevated muzzles of two heavy guns frowned over the space which was about to be occupied by the body of the assem blage. Brilliant sunshine and a smooth sea lent beauty to the scene. For an hour before the commencement of the proceedings, boats contain ing native Darbaris continued to reach the 'Argonaut'; and, as the appointed time drew near, the booming of guns announced arrival on board first of tlie Naval Commander-in-Chief, then of Sultan of 'Oman, and finally, when all were in their places, of Excellency the Viceroy, who was received by a guard-of-honour 100 British marines with a band. On the Viceroy's right, upon tuc high dais, sat His Highness the Saltan of 'Oman, on his left the Naval Commander-in Chief and the British Minister in Persia with their staffs; behind were seated the Viceroy's Private and Military Secretaries and His Excellency's Personal Staff. To the right front of the Viceroy on a lower level were placed the Political Agent at Masqat, the Sultan's half-brother Saiyid Muhammad, the heir-apparent Say id Taimur, the Sultan's attendants, and the native spectators, all except the Political Agent in Arab costume; opposite these on the left were the representa tives of the^ Foreign Department of the Government of India and the officers of His Majesty's ships, in full dress uniform. The Darbar having been declared open, the chief Arab notables were presented to the Viceroy by the Political Agent, and an Arabic address was read aloud on the Sultan's behalf by Shaikh Rashid-bin-'Ozai», Wali of Samail, His Highness's most erudite official; it was to thp following effect:— Your Excellency,—-X trust it will not be amiss if I take advantage of this auspici- ous occasion to convey to Your Excellency some public expression of the pleasure and honour which it affords to me and mine, in the first place to be able to welcome our two Excellencies and His Excellency the Admiral and your imposing and _ ^guiahed escort to our modest capital of 'Oman, and in the second place to be thus X«W. a f n + 0P Fw U o ,ty of J^^ng our sentiments of sincere friendship and to His Mm'p t Tr ^ rea 4 ^ 0vrernmen t ol India, which Your Excellency directs, and in these far Off ouL^ mS Per0rO PPyname,whoSeVioeroraud .T 011 are the the His of the2633 It is now more than a century since my forefathers first entered into treaty relations with Great Britain and that an English Resident has represented the Great Govern meat in our Territory, and for a long period before that Masqat had been in constant commercial touch and intercourse with the English through the trading ports of India. During that period the Rulers of 'Oman have been on terms of the closest friendship withGreat Britain, and at many of those hours of need and difficulty, which are wont to arise so suddenly in an Eastern State, I and my forebears have been the grateful recipients, on innumerable occasions, of that moral and substantial support which the British Government, in the person of the Viceroy of India, has been ever ready to afford. I am therefore in no way different from my predecessors in owing a large debt of gratitude to the Viceroy of India; but there is one point in this connection in respect of which I do stand alone among the Saiyids of 'Oman, and that is in experiencing the great honour and pleasure of being able to welcome a Viceroy of India in person to Masqat, and to express my feelings to him face to face ; and it is with grateful appreciation, and with the knowledge that my relations and my loyal subjects will fully endorse what I say, that I declare that at no time in Masqat history, and from no Viceroy, has greater sympathy and kindness been extended to us than by this great Viceroy, Lord Curzon, whom I am privileged to address to-day. I consider myself particularly fortunate, therefore, in being able to testify before this august assemblage to the reality of our obligations and the sincerity of our appreciations of them. More than this I beg Your Excellency to believe me when 1 declare that neither I nor my brother nor my children, should they be called upon to follow after me, will ever cease to be mindful of the claims of that stiong and ancient friendship which in time past has kept secure the bonds of union existing between Great Britain and ourselves, and that we will at all times remain loyal to those ties. I am afraid that Masqat offers few attractions to the experienced traveller; and, except to put our houses and highways in order as far as circumstances have permitted, and to proclaim a general holiday during Your Excellencies' august presence here, there has been little that it has been possible for us to do in honour of this great occasion. In this regard I can only ask Your Excellency to call to mind the •entiments of the poet who sang : — 'It is not every thing that a man wants that he can achieve; nor can the speeding barque command the wind that she listeth.' At any rate I hope that Your Excellency and your fair and precious Lady, Her Excellency Lady Ourzon, will not carry away with you from Masqat any but kindly recollections. After the address had been interpreted by the Political Agent, Loid Lord Cur- Curzon rose and replied in English in these terms zon's reply. Your Sighness, Your Excellency, and Gentlemen,—Youv Highness has already addressed me yesterday in terms of warm welcome to your Capital and State ; and to-day you have anticipated much of what I desire to say in the speech which you have just spontaneously delivered, and in which you have spoken m feeling language of the historic connection between the British Government and the State of Oman. It was Your Hio -hness's own great grandfather with whom the first Treaty was concluded with the East India Company 105 years ago. As you have further reminded me, for more than a century has a British representative been stationed at Masqat; and during that time the friendly intercourse between the two Governments has beek demonstrated by a series of Treaties or Conventions of which I can trace no fewer than nine, and which have provided for the closest political^ and commercial relations, as well as for the suppression of the slave trade and of piracy, and for the extension of the electric telegraph. This series of agreements sufficiently testifies to the connections that have grown up between the two Governments and that have linked the State of 'Oman to the British Government by quite exceptional ties. But they have also been strengthened, as Your Highness has pointed out, by the suppoit which has been given on critical occasions by the British Government to Recessive rulers oi'Omanl while a farther and natural bond of union is supplied by the fact that Masqat lies just opposite to the shores of India, that its trade is not only for the most part with India, but is largely in Indian hands, that a large number of2634 British Indian subjects reside here, and that the prosperity of the State is mainly dependent on these conditions. It is not surprising therefore, that the Government of India should feel a particular interest in this place, or that a Viceroy of India should desire to visit it and to make the acquaintance of its ruler. ^ His pleasure m doing so is greatly enhanced when he learns from Your Highness s own hps that vou^and your children will ever be mindful of these strong and ancient obligations, and that to them you and they will always remain loyal. These are words which I shall cherish in friendly recollection not only on my own behalf, but on behalt ot the Government which I represent. Your Highness has now ruled your State for fifteen years. I had the pleasure of visiting it when you had only just succeeded f ourteen years ago; and I am glad to congratulate Your Highness on the progress that has since been made. The volume of Tour trade is steadily increasing; the wise step winch the Government of India so strongly urged on Your Highness a few years ago, of taking over the Customs of your State in preference to farming them to others, has been attendedwith lar^ey increased Drofits : and it gave me much satisfaction two years ago, « ness's permission, to brin'g your capital into still closer connection with the outer World hy laying a telegraphic cable from Jashk to Masqat. I also personally se ec ^ Maior Cox as an officer in whose discretion and ability I had perfect confidence, to Kpresen° the Government of India at your capital; and Your Highness has already assured me that jou have found m him a prudent counsellor and tnend. At Delhi in January last, though Your Highness was unaWe yourself to accept toy invitation to the great ceremony that we held thereto celebrate the Coronation of His Majesty the King-Emperor, I bad the pleasure of welcoming your son, Taimur, and of conversing with him about the condition and welfare of Oman. I have referred to the fact that the British Government have extended a peculiar measure of protection in the past to the State of'Oman and its rulers. They have on more than one occasion intervened to save it from rebellion or ■ tt Highmss may rest assured that this policy will not be departed from. Oolong as the rulers of 'Oman continue to observe their Treaty engagements to the G 0 ^;™ India, and to administer their State with enlightenment,and justice, they wiU CM » to receive the support of the British Government, which is interested m preservrng tbe peace of the country and the security of its trade. We cannot regard ^h fahsfaction the attempts of discontented classes or persons Jitrong Your 3 disfnrh the tranauillity of your State, because m so doing not only do th„y Your Highness's authority, but they are apt to injure the interests of J also. These irterests we are hound to protect/or onr own sake as well as for your ^ We hope that Your Highness will continue to triumph over a.l such adversaues future as you have done in the past. I trust that this important occasion, when for the first time a ruler of Oman am the representative in India of the illustrious British Sovere.gn exchange greetings in the waters of Masqat, may be a landmark in the history of the ever widening and deepening connection between our two States; that the firm frienclship between them taay continue to grow, and that Your Highness may be blessed with health and long life to rule over a pacified and loyal people. I have still one agreeable function to perform. Only yesterday I received the Bractons permission of His Majesty the Eirg-Emperor to confer upon Your Hishness the high honour ot the Grand Cross of the Order ot th e Indian Empire, ibis dist nc- tion ^ll be a proof to Your Highness of the sincere sentiments of friendship which are entertained towards you by the British Government; and it is also a recognition of the lovaHy to which Your Highness has given such fervent expression on more than one occasion in the course of yesterday and to-day. It will now be my pleasing duty as Grand Master of the Order, to proceed to the due and solemn investiture of Your Highness. A translation of this speech was read by Khan Bahadur Ahdur Rahim Hakim, Native Attache in the Foreign Department, and was followed with the closest attention by the native spectators ; the anounce- ment with which it concluded, in particular, was received With much applause. It should be mentioned that Saiyid Faisal^ had recen entertained an idea of abdicating in favour o£ his son Taimur, and that on188 ilt ■0m 'fllisf ndsiii] di a11 . tie# f4so 2635 the morning of the 19th Colonel Kemball and Major Cox were sent to interview the Sultan^ who readily agreed to place himself, in the matter of his proposed abdication, in the hands of the British Govern ment, and in no circumstances to take any further step in that direction except under their advice and with their concurrence. The only obstacle to his investiture had thus been removed. The Darbar having been closed, the Viceroy retired to a robing room to prepare for the ceremony of investiture. A few moments later he returned dressed as Grand Master of the Order of the Indian Empire and resumed his seat upon the throne. A Chapter having been constituted, the Sultan Was brought before him with due ceremony and Was invested, according to the usual forms, with the ribbon, badge, star and collar of the Order. This concluded the proceedings, and^ the assembly dispersed, the native Darbaris returning to the shore in a flotilla of country boats which had lain alongside the ' Argonaut ' dur ing the ceremonies, while the Viceroy, the Sultan and the Naval Com mander-in-Chief also quitted the ' Argonaut' in the order named, each receiving his appropriate salute as he left. The Sultan followed Loid Curzon on board the ' Hardinge ' in order to receive a personal inter view and to bid farewell to his'distinguished guest. At this meeting, which took place at 1-15 p.m . and lasted about half-an-hour. Colonel Kembatl, Major Cox and Mr. L. Dane, Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, were present. The Sultan had only two requests to make; the first was that his cousin 'Ali-bin-Salim might be allowed to return from Masqat to Zanzibar, whence he had been expelled for engaging in political intrigues; the second was that some mercy might be shown to 'Omani slave-traders who had been captured by the Portuguese in Mozambique in 1903 and sentenced to 25 years' imprisonment on the West Coast of Africa. Lord Curzon promised to see what could be done in both matters ; but he considered that, as regarded the second, there was little hope for the time hems' that the Sultan's wishes could be ^ gratified* At Major Cox s suggestion Lord Curzon impressed upon Saiyid Sir Faisal the ^desirability of his employing a financial expert or a competent committee to audit his accounts, and of his ceasing to draw in advance upon the receipts of his Customs, which were virtually the sole source of his revenue. The Sultan admitted that his expenditure was m excess of his income, but he was unwilling to make an innovation of the kind suggested j he Was understood, however, to say that he would do what he could to meet His Excellency's wishes. The interview was free and informal; and the demeanour of Saiyid Sir Faisal was distinguished by dignity, courtesy and friendliness. He assured the Viceroy that he and hi^ son Taimur were entirely at His Excellency's orders; nor did he withdraw until he had thanked His Excellency repeatedly for the honoui had unui 116 coming to Masqat and investing him with the g S i - E The receipt of this decoration had evidently afforded the Sultan much pleasure- . , , The 'Hardinge' left Masqat the same afternoon, accompanied by ine tiara S , . ^ two dayg 0 f the Viceregal visit had been the ships of h ■ holiday; and the native festivities culminated fnZllS SlcTwhi th. iip. were .» get »d.r Close of the Darbar.

LordCurzons On his visit to Masqat^ in its political aspect, Lord Curzon subse- reporfc on his quently reported as follows to His Majesty^s Government:— visit to Mas qat. His Higlmess the Sultan on all these occasions conducted himself with simpli city and dignity, his demeanour wab that of a loyal feudatory of the British^ Grown rather than of an independent sovereign, and it is clear that he trusts implicitly to the British Power for support and protection. He did not plead for any further engagements, nor did he seek to extract any fresh pledge. The situation and its surroundings were evidently sufficient in his eyes to confirm him in reliance upon our friendship, and in an attitude of deference to our wishes, which is not only of good omen for the future, but which reflects the greatest credit upon Major Cox, the Political Agent whom I appointed to Masqat in 1899, and who in little more than four years has converted the ruler from feelings of suspicion, if not of direct hostility, to those of confidence and regard. On the other hand, in proportion as the desire of the Sultan to range himseU goto speak, alongside of the Indian Princes jn their relations to the British Crown was made manifest, so did the incongruity of his international position become more apparent: while the contradiction between the actual state of affairs — with a ruler, a people, and a trade almost entirely dependent upon ourselves—and^ the theoretical status, under which France, represented only by a Consul, with no subjects, and next to no trade, enjoys a treaty equality with Great Britain—was such as to emphasize the desirability of terminating with as little delay as possible a situation so anomalous and it might almost be said so grotesque. Examination of the Ruus-al-Jibal coast, 20th November. m Early on the morning after leaving Masqat, the squadron came sight of the Ruus-al-Jibal headland; and the whole day was devoted by the Viceroy and the Naval Commander-in-Chief to an exploration, in the ' Hardinge', of its more important and interesting inlets. On the eastern side of the promontory the ' Hardinge ■' penetrated to the head of Grhubbat Ghazirah or Malcolm Inlet; in passing from the Gulf of ^Oman to that of Persia she made use of the famous Jb'akk-al-Asad strait, between Musandam island and the mainland; on her way down the western side of the peninsula she steamed slowly through the Khor Quwai channel under the shelter of Ghanam Island; and at length, early in the afternoon, she entered Khor-ash-Sham, passed Telegraph Islet on which the plinth of the old telegraph station was still visible, and anchored opposite the village of Sibi near the head of the inlet. Here Lord Curzon went ashore and ascended with a few members of his staff to the summit of the Maqlab isthmus near the point where the telegraph line formerly crossed it; from this place a fine view was obtained of the Malcolm and Elphinstone Inlets and of the surrounding mountains. In the evening the ' Hardjnge ' dropped down Khor-ash-Sham and re-entered the open sea. The results of this day's work were subsequently placed by Lord Curzon before His Majesty^s Government in connection with the question of a British naval base in the Persian Gulf* one ifmmmmmrnrnam Darbar on H. M. S. 'Argonaut,' 2637 The visit to SJiarjah, 21st November. An anchorage off Sharjah was reached early on the following day; hut Arrival off the shallowness of the water prevented the squadron from approaching Shavjah. the shore^ and a low-lying coast^ with a fringe of date-palms and a line of substantial yellow buildings, was all that could be described from the decks of the ships. No salute was fired by the squadron on arrival, partly on account of the distance of the ships from the shore which was about five miles, and partly because the Shaikh of Sharjah had no means of returning oce if given. A heavy swell, which was rolling in from the north-west, necessitated some changes in the official programme. The Shaikhs of Trucial ''Oman were already collected on board the Indo-European Telegraph Departments vessel ' Patrick Stewart' in charge of Mr. Gaskin, Assistant Political Agent in Bahrain; Colonel Kemball also was present, having hastened on ahead from Masqat in the ' Lawrence and it only remained for the weather to moderate in order that the Darbar, which it was intended to hold, might take place. Even tually, but not without some difficulty, the Trucial Shaikhs—who, des cendants though they were of pirates and buccaneers, had suffered severely from sea-sickness on board the ' Patrick Stewart '—were transferred to the ' Argonautwhere a Darbar room had been arranged on the quarter-deck in the same manner as at Masqat; and a number of the leading residents of Sharjah also were brought off to the a Argonaut ' in a steam launch. The transhipment of the British spectators of the Darbar from the other ships to the a Argonaut' was attended by considerable incon venience, on account of the heavy sea; but, the Admiral and the Viceroy having safely reached the ' Argonaut' under the salutes appropriate to the occasion, the proceedings commenced at about 3-30 p.m . The ceremo nial of the Darbar was much the same as at Masqat, and all officers were in full dress; but the place upon the dais ai the Viceroy's right hand was filled by the Political Kesident, and, Sir A. Hardinge having proceeded direct from Masqat to arrange for the impending visit of the squadron to Bandar 'Abbas, the corresponding place on His Excellency's left was occupied by the Naval Commander-in-Chief and his staff alone. A guard of honour of British marines with a band was in attendance. The Shaikhs present in person were Shaikh Zaid of Abu Dhabi with two sons; Shaikh Saqar of Sharjah and Shaikh Maktum of Dibai, each accompanied by one son; and Shaikh 'Abdul 'Aziz of 'Ajman alone, his son being ill: Shaikh Ahmad of Umm-al-Qaiwain, an old and infirm man who died a few months later, was represented by his son Eashid who has since succeeded to the Shaikhship. Ihe Shaikh of Harmiyah, who had for some time been endeavouring to assert an independence of Sharjah not recognised by the British Government, was not invited to attend. The Shaikhs present were all elderly or middle-aged men, and their dignified and independent air and the manly appearance of their followers occasioned general remark. After the Shaikhs had been formally | | hit- ili I ' 1 presented to the Viceroy, His Excellency deliveied an address m2638 English^ which was in effect an epitome of British history in the Arab waters of the Gulf during the preceding century and ran as follows Chiefs of the Aral Coast who are in Treaty relations with the British Government, —I have come here as the representative in the great Empire of India of the British authority which you and your fathers and fore-fathers have known and dealt with for more than a hundred years; and my object is to show you, that though you live at some distance from the shores of India, you are not forgotten by the Government, but that they adhere to the policy of guardianship and protection which has given you peace and guaranteed your rights for the best part of the century ; and that the first Viceroy of India who has ever visited these waters does not quit them without seeking the opportunity of meeting you in person and of renewing the assurances and engagements by which we have been so long united. Chiefs, your fathers and grandfathers before you have doubtless told you of the history of the past. You know that a hundred years ago there were constant trouble and fighting in the Gulf ; almost every man was a marauder or a pirate ; kidnapping and slave-trading flourished ; fighting and bloodshed went on without stint or respite ; no ship could put out to sea without fear of attack ; the pearl fishery was a^ scene 01 an nual conflict; and security of trade or peace there was none. Then it was that the British Government intervened and said that, in the interests of its own subjects and traders, and of its legitimate influence in the seas that wash the Indian coasts, this state of affairs must not continue. British flotillas appeared in these waters. British forces occupied the ports and towns on the coast that we see from this deck. The struggle was severe while it lasted but it was not long sustained. In 1820 the first general Treaty was signed between the British Government and the Chiefs; and of these or similar agreements there have been in all no fewer than eighty In 1839 the Maritime Truce was concluded, and was renewed from time to time until the year 1853 when it was succeeded by the Treaty of Perpetual Peace that has lasted ever since. Under that Treaty it was provided that there should be a complete cessation of hosti lities at sea between the subjects of the signatory Chiefs, and a f£ perfect maritime truce'—to use the words that were employed— 4 ' for evermore ' ^that in the event of aggressions on anyone by sea, the injured parties should not retaliate, but should refer the matter to the British Resident in the Persian Gulf; and that the British Govern ment should watch over the peace of the Gulf and ensure at all times the observance of the Treaty. Chiefs, that Treaty has not, of course, prevented occasional trouble and conflict; it has sometimes been neglected or infringed ; but on the whole it has well deserved its name ; and under it has grown up a condition of affairs so peaceful and secure that the oldest among you can only remember as a dim story the events of the past, while the younger have never seen warfare or bloodshed on the seas. It is now eleven vears since the last disturbance of the peace occurred. Chiefs, out of the relations that were thus created, and which by your own consent constituted the British Government the guardian of inter-tribal peace, there grew up political ties between the Government of India and yourselves, whereby the British Government became your overlords and protectors, and you have relations with no other Power. Every one of the States known as the Trucial States has bound itself, as you know, not to enter into any agreement or correspondence with any other Power, not to admit the agent of any other Government, and not to part with any portion of its territories. These engagements are binding on every one of you, and you have faithfully adhered to them. They are also binding in their reciprocal effect upon the British Government, and as long as they are faithfully observed by the Chiefs there is no fear that anyone else will be allowed to tamper with your rights or liberties. Sometimes I think that the record of the past is in danger of being forgotten, and there are persons who ask—Why should great Britain continue to exercise these powers? The bistoiy of your States and of your families, and the present condition of the Gulf, are the answer. We were here before any other Power, in modern times, had shown its face in these waters. We found strife and we have created order. It was our commerce as well as your security that was threatened and called for protection. At every port along these coasts the subjects of the King of England still reside and trade. The great Bmphc of India, which it is our duty to defend, lies almost at your gates. We saved you ircm extinction at the hands of your neighbours. We opened these seas to the ships of all nations, and enabled their flags to fly in peace# We have pot seized or held your territory. We have not destroyed your independence but havepreserved it. We are not now going to throw away this century of costly and trium phant enterprise; we shall not wipe out the most unselfish page in history. The peace of these waters must still be maintained ; your independenae will continue to be upheld ; and the influence of the British Government must remain supreme. There is one respect' in which the Chiefs themselves can avert any renewal of trouble in the future. The British Government have no desire to interfere, and have never interfered, in your internal affairs, provided that the Chiefs govern their territories with justice, and respect the rights of the foreign traders residing therein. If any internal disputes occuv, you will always find a friend in the British Resident, who will use his influence, as he has frequently done in the past, to prevent these dis* sensions from coming to a head, and to maintain the status quo, for we could not approve of one independent Chief attacking another Chief by land, simply because he was not permitted to do it by sea, and thus evading the spirit of his treaty obliga tions. I will mention a case that seems to lend itself to friendly settlement of the character that I have described. You are all of you aware that the strip of coast known as the Batinah* Coast on the'opposite side of the 'Oman Peninsula, is under the authority of the Chief of the Jowasmis. Nevertheless his authority is contested in some quarters. It is desirable that these disputes should cease, and that the peace should remain undisturbed. Chiefs, these are the relations that subsist between the British Government and yourselves. The Sovereign of the British Empire lives so far away that none of you has ever seen or will ever see his face ; but his orders are carried out everywhere throughout his vast dominions by the officers of his Government, and it is as bis representative in India, who is responsible to him for your welfare, that I am here to-day to exchange greetings with you, to renew old assurances, and to wish you prosperity in the future. An Arabic translation o£ this address having been read by Mr. Gaskin, Assistant Political Officer in Bahrain, handsome gifts were distributed; each Shaikh attending in person received a sword from the Viceroy's hands, besides which a gold watch and chain and a sporting rifle were given^ to every Shaikh, and a rifle to every Shaikh's son. As the month of Ramadhan had now begun, no refreshments were served. JDhe Darbar was then closed, and the Viceroy, the Naval Commander-in-Chief and the Shaikhs in succession took their departure from the ' Argonaut each receiving the guns due to his rank as he cjuitted the ship. In the evening the squadron with tire Viceroy left Sharjah for Bandar 'Abbas, The visit to Bandar 'Abbas, Hormuz and Qishm, 22nd November.

A salute of 31 guns was fired hv the Persepolis' in honour of the Viceroy's arrival, and a deputation was sent by the Governor in the « Persepolis' to enquire what time would be convenient for his visit; m consequence of a mistake, this deputation at first proceeded to the Argonaut instead of the Arrival at Bandar 'Abbas. Bead &lt;c Shamailiyah.' n 11 l2;a Hardinge'. At H a.m . the Governor came off from tlie shore and was received on the main deck of the a Hardinge ^ where 1 he Shah^s message was officially delivered to the Viceroy and was acknowledged by him. Subsequently the Governor's visit was returned on shore by Sir A. Hardinge and Mr. Dane^ Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, who were received by the Salar-i-Mu'azzam in a tent upon the quay ; the quay was covered with carpets, a guard-of-honour was in waiting, and the Minister's salute was fired by a shore battery. Later in the day a deputation of the British Indian subjects itish an ^ traders residing at Bandar 'Abbas, over 30 in number, were received sub- by the Viceroy on the main deck of the ' Hardinge ' ; they were intro duced by Captain Grey, Vice-Consul at Bandar ^Abbas, who accompanied the cruise from this place to Bushehr, and they presented an address of welcome which ran as follows :— Mai/ it please Your Excellency y —We, the British Indian Subjects and Traders of Bandar'Abbas, beg leave to offer to Your Excellency a respectful and cordial welcome. Owing to the situation of this port at the entrance to the Gulf, the subjects of the British Empire residing in Bandar 'Abbas are privileged to enjoy the unique honour of being the first to welcome the first; Viceroy of India who has visited the shores of this country. We welcome Your Excellency to the land of ancient Iran, a land which has passed through troubles and changes above its share, and which has ever been, and will ever be, to the rest of the world a land of absorbing interest, if orly on account of its historical connections ; we are, moreover, privileged to welcome Your Excellency not as a stranger, but as one who is intimately acquainted with Persia, and who takes the liveliest interest in her affairs. The port of Bandar 'Abbas, although it is well known to be unhealthy, and has the reputation of being one of the hottest places in the world, enjoys an importance peculiar to itself. The neighbouring islands, in addition to the ruins of ancient fortresses, which were in former times scenes of encounters between powerful European Powers, abound in rich mineral ores, which will employ the attention of traders for many years to come. Our port itself, with its valuable import and export trade, may be considered the great empoirium for the marts of Central and Southern Persia; and the fact that British subjects can, under the protecting hand of Govern ment, lay claim to the greater part of this trade, is to us a source of pride and satisfaction. Another fact which we beg to record on the present occasion is that of the estab lishment of a Vice-Consulate, which has taken place during Your Excellency's tenure of the Viceroyalty, and, for this marked proof of the interest taken by the Imperial Government in the advancement of our interests, we beg to offer our grateful acknowledgments. Since this Consulate has been founded our community has increased, our trade has risen to a higher level, and our merchants have penetrated into the furthest towns of Central Persia; and, although there are still adverse circumstances to contend with,—notably the absence of telegraphic communication with the outside world,— our unbounded confidence in the benignity of British rule leads us to hope for greater facilities in the future, to the increasing prosperity of British subjects, and the consequent enhancement of British prestige. In conclusion, we desire humbly to express the hope that Your Excellency's past associations with this historic land will he strengthened by the present visit, and that of the memories of your tour in these waters not the least pleasant may be that of Your Excellency's reception by the British subjects in Bandar 'Abbas. Lord Curzon replied to the address in the following terms:— Qentlemen, —In thanking you for your address, let me express my pleasure at meeting here a community of British Indian subjects of His Majesty the King- Emperor, enjoying the hospitality of a foreign and friendly land, and engaged in a2641 MlOllt trade which is equally beneficial to this country and to yourselves. I am glad that reisia returns the compliment by Bending a large number of her own gifted and intelligent subjects to trade in the ports of British India; for these relations are meieJy the continuance in modern times of a connection between Iran and India that has lasted for centuries, and that is based not merely upon geographical proximity alone, but upon original affinities of civilisation, language, and race. Bandar 'Abbas, both under its present name and under its former title of Gombrun, has also been innmately bound up with the history of British mercantile enterprise in Persia and the Persian Gulf, and I suppose that there is hardly a scene in the world that has witnessed more struggles for commercial supremacy, or has experienced more startling vicissitudes of political fortune, than the waters and islands that we can see from this very spot. Should ^ any one enquire why the Viceroy of India, while in the discharge of the duties of his office, should visit this place, the answer may be found in the facts which I have^ already mentioned, namely, in the uninterrupted historical connection which has existed between this locality and India for hundreds of years, and in the residence here of a flourishing colony of British Indian traders and trade. But the explanation goes much further than that, both in its local and in its general application ; for here we are at the mouth of a sea which has been one of main and most beneficent areas of British exertion in the continent of Asia. The great maritime highway of the Persian Gulf has never failed to attract these nations who held, or aspired to hold, the ports of India ; and having embarked upon the Indian enterprise in which tbey ultimately out-distanced all other competitors, it fell naturally to the British to pursue their successful activity in this direction, and thus gradually to acquire an ascendancy of trade and interest in the Persian Gulf which has never wavered until the present day, and which has been so far from selfish in its operation that it has brought wealth and security to the States and communities that are to be found upoia these shores, has smoothed the path of every ship that navigates these waters, and has won for us the friendship and gratitude of the principal Governments, such as that of His Majesty the Shah, with whom we have been brought in contact. The ascendancy of which I have spoken is demonstrated by the fact that out of a total value of trade in the Gulf—including under that designation the ports on the Arab as well as on the Persian Coast, and embracing Muhammareh in the latter, but not including Basrah—amounting to nearly 6| millions sterling in the last recorded year, 1901, close upon 5 millions of which was external trade, that is, trade with ports outside the Gulf, the British percentage of this external trade was 77, and the corre sponding percentage of British steamers leaving and entering the Gulf ports was 97. If we restrict our observations io the Persian ports alone, we find that the total volume of trade in 1901 was close upon 4J millions sterling, of which £4,232,000 was external, and that of the latter the British proportion was 66 per cent., and, the shipping by which it was carried 97 per cent. These figures show that, even in the much more acute competition that now prevails, the commercial superiority so long enjoyed by Great Britain in these seas still exists, if not unchallauged, at least unimpaired. On the other hand there are circumstances in the trade and position of Bandar 'Abbas which shew that the keenest efforts will be required to retain for this port the advan* tages which it has hitherto eojoyed. You have called attention to other symptoms of Indian interest in Bandar Abbas^ My Government is represented here by an officer, appointed for the first time since I came to India, to safeguard the interests of British Indian trade in this place, and I am glad to learn from you that his arrival has been followed by an extension in certain aspects of your business, and that you 1 ave already derived benefit from his labours. It is to be remembered that Bandar 'Abbas, though it^ has been shorn of much of its ancient fame, is the starting point from which almost immemorial caravan routes penetrate far into the interior, carrying what are for the most part British and Indian goods to the great towns of Central Persia on the north and west, and to the bazaars of Khurasan, Afghanistan, and Central Asia on the north-east and east. This is a very important outpost, therefore, of Indian trade. Again, let it be remembered that India is no remote country which is here busying itself at a great distance from its base. On the contrary, we are the nearest neighbours of Persia along her entire eastern frontier, firstly in the territories of Baluchistan, and 1762642 A next in those of the Afghan ruler, whose foreign relations are in our hands. Countries and Powers which are thus placed in relation to each other can hardly fail to develop, and ou^ht to encourage, the closest connections; and the more that those who are responsible for their administration see of each other and learn of each other's views and needs, the better must it be for both. I think that I have said enough, therefore, to show that if it is a novel thing it is yet no unnatural thing that the Viceroy of India should come here to pay you a visit and to see how Indian interests and Indian subjects are faring in this allied aud adjacent country. Perhaps in my own case the instification is not weakened by the fact that I have for many years taken a deep interest in Persia, and have always entertained the warmest desire that the ancient friendship between the British Government and the illustrious Sovereign of this country should be strengthened and deepened as time goes on. Gentlemen, I concur with yon in thinking that it would be a great advantage to you to be connected by telegraph with the outer world ; and nothing would give me greater pleasure than to be instrumental, with the good offices of the Persian Govern ment, in bringing about such a consummation. In conclusion let me offer you my best wishes for your continued and increasing prosperity in the future. Visit to In the afternoon the Viceregal party landed on the islands of Hormuz Hormuz and arir | visiting the Portuguese Fort on Hormuz and the town of Qishm; the reception by the natives of Qishm o£ their unexpected guests was remarkable for its cordiality^ and an ode in honour of the occasion was improvised and recited on the spot by a local bard. These visits to the islands afforded further material for a discussion between Lord Curzon, Sir A. Hardinge and Kear-Admiral Atkinson-Willes of the question of naval defence and strategy at the mouth of the Gulf. In the evening the town of Bandar 'Abbas was illuminated^ but a display of fireworks which had been arranged was countermanded on account of the death of a Persian princess^ a daughter of His Majesty the Shah. Examination of Hanjam, the southern coast of Qishm, and Basidu the 23rd and 24th November. ?ei of vis The squadron^ which halted for the night off Qishm town, reached ^ Hanjam at dawn on the morning of the 23rd of November^ and a visit was paid to the site of the former British telegraph station; the result of the observations made here, and subsequently at Basidu, was to convince both the Viceroy and the Naval Commander-in-Chief that Hanjam was ^ a better point than Basidu both for landing a submarine cable to establish ^ telegraphic connection with Bandar 'Abbas, and for a signalling station g at the mouth of the Gulf. From the Hanjam anchorage the ' Lawrence^, ai with the Viceroy, and H.M S. ^ Sphinx ^ carrying the Naval Comman- ^ der-in-Chief, started in the early morning of the 24th and coasted ^ along the southern shore of Qishm ; a landing was made at two places near the Namakdan salt caves. In the evening the two ships reached Basidu, having followed the inner channel which adjoins the south-west ern corner of Qishm Island. At Basidu the Viceroy's party went on shore about 5 p.m ., and the site of the British station there was inspected.2643 Visit to Lingeh, 24tli to 25th November. Lord Curzon's speecli. Lingeh was reached on the evening of the same day, the 24th of at November, the ' Lawrence^ and ' Sphinx ' being rejoined at this point Xangeh- by the East Indies squadron, which had parted from them at Hanjam. In the evening the town and the Persian war-vessel Persepolis were brilliantly illuminated, and the Viceroy entertained the Governor of the Gulf Ports and his brother, the Mujir-us-Saltaneh, Deputy Governor of Lingeh, at a dinner on board the ' Hardinge. 33 After dinner Lord Curzon proposed the health of the Shah in these terms:— I rise to propose the health of His Imperial Majesty the Shah of Persia. IVo days ago, when we touched at the first port in His Majesty s dominions, I had the honour of being received by our guest of this evening, the Salar-i-Mu azzam. Governor of the Gulf Ports, who had been specially deputed by his royal master to greet me, and to whom it is my pleasant privilege to return the comphment thiB evening. A few days hence, when we arrive at Bushehi^ I undeistand that I am further to be welcomed by one of the most distinguished of I er^ian 8 . . , the A'la-ud-Dauleh, Governor-General of Fars, who has ^ been specially commissioned by the Shah for that purpose. I desire to return my sincere thanks for the ment thus conveyed to me, and to the Government which I represent, by Imperial Majesty. There is not one of us who does not feel 'a peculwr pleasure m touching upon Persian soil. For many centuries the British Persian people We b connected together by the closest ties of friendship and esteem. . ® et 3nol interest Persia in particular there exist very intimate relations of po i i , ' and trade.

I u formal visit of the Viceroy to Manamah. Address by Hindu traders. ' Hardinge', accompanied by the a Pomone^ 'Sphinx' and 'Law rence 33 only, had worked her way up to the inner anchorage. Meanwhile a salute of 31 guns was fired on shore; and_, soon after the ' Hardinge' had dropped anchor, Shaikh Hamad, the heir apparent to the Bahrain Shaikh- ship, and the Wazir of the Shaikh of Bahrain came on board to enquire after the Viceroys health and to ask when His Excellency would be pleased to receive the Shaikh. At 1-80 p. m. Shaikh 'Isa himself, accompanied by Mr. Gaskin, Assistant Political Agent in Bahrain, and attended by three sons, his eldest grandson and his Wazir, arrived on board the ' Hard- inge.' Guards were paraded in his honour on board H.M.S. Pomone. 33 The Viceroy received the Shaikh standing, and showed him to a seat at his right hand; on the right of the Shaikh were seated the Political Resident, the Assistant Political Agent in Bahrain and the Shaikh's attendants ; on the left of the Viceroy were the British Minister at Tehran, the Foreign Secretary and the Viceregal staff. Undress uniform was worn upon this occasion. A short conversation ensued in which the Shaikh referred to the prosperity of his State, attributing it to the British protectorate, thanked the Viceroy for taking so long a journey to show his interest in Bahrain, and expressed his gratitude for the formal recognition of his son Hamad as his successor, as well as his appreciation of the character of Sir L. Pelly, who had played an important part in the affairs of Bahrain nearly forty years before. After the conversation the Shaikh^s sons and officials were presented to the Viceroy and, with the Shaikh, received valuable presents; the interview then terminated, and Shaikh'Isa left the a Hardinge ' under a salute of five guns. It was observed that the Shaikh kept his sandals on throughout the interview but his omission to remove them was evidently due to nervousness. In the afternoon the Viceroy with his staff paid an informal visit to the town of Manamah; he was met at the landing-place by the Shaikh, who conducted him to the British Agency. After sundown coffee was served at the Agency, and the attendants, in accordance with Arab custom, poured rose water on the hands of the guests and perfumed their beards and faces with the smoke of burning aloes. The Viceregal party then returned on board. The arrangements made for the landing and embark ing of the Viceroy and his staff were inadequate, and the tide at both times was low, consequently 1J hours were lost in coming ashore and 2 hours in returning to the ship; the Shaikh also, after escorting Lord Curzon to the place of embarkation, was guilty of some discourtesy in leaving the spot before the whole party had got off in safety. For these shortcomings, however, he subsequently apologised through Colonel Kemball; and it must be remembered that the departure took place in the month of Ramadhan at sunset, when the Arabs must have been impatient to break their long day^s fast. After the Viceroy had left Manamah for the ' Hardinge, an address by the Hindu traders of Bahrain was brought forward; but, presented as it was unexpectedly, no opportunity for replying to in could be found. The address ran as follows :—• May it please Your Excellency, —We, the undersigned British Indian Merchants I ln —-r^ ' a h™in 3 have pleasure in taking advantage of your Lordship's visit TiarriA 8 * 6 l^ands of the Gulf, to extend to you a most hearty welcome in the name of our community. a unenqi ip UP ¥ : Hsi) 2645 We hope you pave had a pleasant passage ou your way up the Gulf, that your snort stay here will be agreeable to Your Lordship, and that your reiuro voyage will be accomplised in safety and comfort. We consider our83lves specially fortunate in having this opportunity of meeting Your Excellency, as the Gulf was never honoured with a visit from a Viceroy of India and, as we know that Your Lordship takes a keen interest in questions affecting the Persian Gulf and the East in general, we sincerely hope and trust that this visit will be a harbinger of prosperity, felicity, and peace in the Gulf. We beg to acknowledge the manifold blessings we have derived from the just and kind British rule. May it be known to Your Lordship that we came up to the Persian Gulf about two hundred years ago, when no steamers visited the Gulf and all business had to be done by means of sailing boats under very trying and disadvan tageous circumstances. But now the times are changed, and British protection has brought with it its usual blessings—peace, safety, and prosperity—which reflects great credit on the British enterprise and civilization in the Gulf. We have no desire on this occasion to trespass unduly on Your Excellency's precious time, but humbly venture to lay beforo you one or two questions of vital importance and considerable interest to Bahrain trade. This port is naturally placed in a very favourable situation for trade and is a commercial centre for Hasa, '0»jair f Qatlf, Qatar, and their hinterlands ; and to accelerate the trade of this port a piar at Manamah is absolutely necessary to enable lighters to ply at all times and tides, to give the steamers a speedy despatch. We most respectfully beg to put this want before your kind consideration. In 1864 we opened trade relations with Qatif and did large business there. We generally command respect and enjoy some prestige in the Gulf, but, through mis- government at Qatif, we were not only ignored but we snstalned heavy losses and wore exposed to insults. In 1895 one of us was attacked by pirates and his right hand was severed and pearls worth lis. 40,030 were plundered from him. Our un protected condition placed us at a great disadvantage there, and we had finally to retire from Qatif. Since Bahrain enjoyed unexceptionable tranquillity and great advantages for trade, both Arab and Persian traders have come and settled down here. The keen competition now prevailing here has made it necessary for us to seek new fields, and we are anxious to share in the growing trade of Qatif and Qatar, and pray Your Excellency to appoint officers at those unrepresented ports, or, if it be imprac ticable, to extend the authority of the Bahrain Political Agency over them. In conclusion, we offer our prayers to the Almighty to bless and prolong the life of His Most Gracious Majesty the King-Emperor, under whose benign rule we are able to live here in peace and contentment, and we sincerely wish Your Lordship a happy sojourn, prosperous career and long life. On the morning of the 27th of November, at 11 a.m., a private visit was paid by Shaikh ■'Isa to His Excellency on board the ff Hardinge' ; the Shaikh was accompanied only by Hamad, his eldest son and recognised successor. Mr. Dane, Foreign Secretary, and Colonel Kemball, Political Hesident, were present; and Mr. Gaskin, the Assistant Political Agent in Bahrain, acted as interpreter. The Shaikh having stated that he had no requests to make. His Excellency referred to the murder of the Shaikh's relative, Salman-bin-Di'aij, on the Arabian mainland and advised the Shaikh to await the result of the negotiations then pending with the Porte adding that, should these fail, the propriety of taking further steps would be considered ; and he also enquired what form of lepaia- tion would be acceptable to the Shaikh. The Viceroy then passed to the subject of the mismanagement of the Bahrain Customs and firmly impressed on the Shaikh the advantages and necessity of reform, not only in his own interests, but also in those of the British Government^ by whom he was protected, and of the son whose title to succeed him had been recognised by the British authorities. The Shaikh showed himsel very obstinate on this point and asked that the matter might be post poned during his lifetime, but this was not conceded. Eventually Private interview of the Shaikh with the Viceroy. 1 :2646 Shaikh ; Iea said that he would consider the subject with his sons and brother^ and His Excellency admitted that this was a very proper course; but at the same time he warned the Shaikh that the matter could not be dropped^ and that definite proposals for a change must be submitted shortly. After the interview had lasted more than half an hour the Shaikh took his leave. Expected An opportunity had been arranged for Shaikh Ahmad of Dohah in Shaiktfof ^ a ^ ar mee t the Viceroy at Bahrain for the purpose of paying his Do^iah. respects and stating his views concerning his relations with the British Government. Had he appeared he would have received an assurance^ authorised by His Majesty's Government^ that the friendship of the British Government would be continued to him so long as he abstained from entering into engagements with any other power ; but ; in consequence of the invitation sent by Colonel Kemball not reaching him in time, he was absent, and the assurance remained uncommunicated. The visit to Kuwait; 28th and29tli November. Arrival and informal visit of the Shaikh to the Viceroy. Formal visit oftbe Shaikh to the Viceroy. At 10-30 )&gt; a. m . on the morning of Exploration of the bay. Visit of the Viceroy to Kuwait town. the 28th of November, the 'Hard- mge' reached Kuwait, whither the larger ships of the squadron had preceded her, and was accompanied by H. M. S. 'Pomone' to the inner anchorage. A salute of 81 guns was fired from an antiquated battery in front of the Shaikh^s residence, and the ' Hardinge' had scarcely dropped anchor when Shaikh Mubarak himself stepped on board, accompanied by Colonel Kemball, the Political Kesident, to enquire for Lord Curzon^s health and to learn the time fixed for his official visit. At 3 o^clock in the afternoon, the hour appointed, he returned to the ' Hardinge ' accompanied only by Shaikh J abir, his eldest son, and was received with precisely the same ceremonial and etiquette as had been observed at the formal visit of the Shaikh of Bahrain. Among the presents he received was a sword, and on taking it from His Excellency's hands the Shaikh remarked that he also required a belt, as he was now ' one of the soldiers ^ (ahad min al ''asakir),—by which perhaps he meant a military official of the British Empire. At his departure he was honoured with a salute of five guns. After the Shaikhs visit. Lord Curzon proceeded in the 'Sphinx' to examine the headwaters of Kuwait Bay, in the neighbourhood of Kadha- mah,— an operation which occupied the remaining hours of daylight and in the course of which the a Sphinx ^ was temporarily aground. At 10 a. m. on the 29th of November the 'Viceroy left the ' Hardinge ' under a salute of 31 guns from the a Pomone and landed at Bandar Shuwaikh, a boat anchorage about three miles from the town, ' where ' Shaikh Mubarak, with his sons and chief retainers awaited him at the ' 'head of a gallant gathering of Arab horsemen. The Viceroy and' ' Mubarak entered the only carriage which Kuwait boasts of, horses were ' ' provided for His Excellency's suite, and then, amidst the firing of guns ''f V ' and the guttural shouts of the Arabs, the procession set off, helter- 3) ' skelter, for the town across the great open plain, surrounded by a crowd 33 ' of horsemen, who galloped wildly ahead, hurled their spears or dis- 33 l( charged their carbines in the air, curvetted, pirouetted, and went 33 ' through all the time-honoured evolutions of an Arab field-day. It 33 ' was a strikingly picturesque scene ; the bright colours of the cavalcade, 33 ' their flowing robes of orange and red and golden brown flung to the 33 ' wind as they careered about on their spirited Arab steeds; the more 33 ' sedate and compact bodies of camelry trotting with silent footfall; the 33 ' moving crowd of spectators shuffling along on foot; well-fed townsmen 33 ' in their best dresses; Arabs from the desert, lean and hungry in their 33 ' ragged 'Abas; veiled women with dark indigo cloaks thrown over their ;&gt; ' heads and long trailing skirts of gaudy cotton prints ; black-eyed and 33 ' brown-skinned children in every stage of undress; and in the back- 39 ' ground, behind the black tents of a large Bedouin encampment, the 33 ' white walls and flat roofs of the town gay with bunting, and far u away across the pale blue waters of the bay, girt with the yellow 33 ' desert, the fleet lying at anchor, grey and grim, with the ' Hardinge , 33 u all in white, conspicuous in their midst.'' In this reception over 200 horsemen and 20 camel riders took part, besides about 4,000 footmen, many of whom carried Martini-Henry rifles or carbines. The flag borne was a red Arab banner with the motto a Trusting in God ' (Tawakkulan 'ala Allah). The Viceroy drove through the town to the Shaikh's residence on the sea front, where on his arrival a salute of 31 guns was fired. An interview followed in an upper chamber which^is used by the Shaikh as a reception room and which was ornamented, on this occasion, with colouied portraits of the King and Queen of England and of Her late Majesty Queen Victoria. After the younger sons of the Shaikh had been presented to the Viceroy coffee was served. The Turkish flag, which had been flying over the Shaikh's house on the previous day, does not appear to have been hoisted on this occasion. At 2 o'clock in the afternoon Shaikh Mubarak paid a private visit to the Viceroy on board the ' Hardinge The Shaikh, on being invited to speak, said that he had renounced his connection with the lurks and had come under the British protectorate; he had further refused the advances that had been made to him by the French and the E,ussia,ns ; and he hoped therefore that he might receive a title, or a decoration and an allowance. He dwelt at some length on the financial difficulties of his position. He then requested that his terntory at Umm Qasr and Bubiyan might be freed of the presence of the lurks who, he said, had seized it bv stealth. To these remarks of the Shaikh Lord Curzon lejomed that he was gl«l to have learnt what the Shaikh had in his mind, and that he would fully consider his requests, though he could not piomise that any of them would be granted. The case of the Shaikh s Basrah atent who had been imprisoned by the Turkish Government for treason, was then mentioned ; and the Shaikh was told that the Brit sh Ambassa- dor was trying to secure a mitigation of the^ sentence passe upon him. Finally His Excellency reiterated the warmngs which had already been sVioi'L-h through the Political Resident in the Gulf, that he should abstain from interference in the affairs of Central Arabia; the Shaikh promised to be guided by his advice m this respect, and withdrew after repeatedly thanking the Viceroy for his visit to Kuwait and for the Private inter view of the Shaikh with the Yiceroji2648 Visit of the Shaikh to H.M.S.

Mr. Dane, Foreign Secretary, and Colonel Kemball, the Political Resident in the Persian Irult, were present at this interview. Jh'om the ' Hardmge ^ Shaikh Mubarak was taken by the Foreign becretary on board H.M.S. 'Hyacinth the flagship of Rear-AdmiraJ Atkinson-Willes; this was the first time that the Shaikh had set foot on deck of a man-of-war, and he was much interested in the ship and her guns. After taking coffee in the Admiral's cabin, he left for the shore under a salute of five guns. • j 1 ' 8 ®T Cellcncy theVicero y left Kuwait at 10 P-M- the same evening in the_ Lawrence', accompanied by the 'Sphinx', for a visit of inspection to Khor -'Abdullah and Khor Musa; but the remainder of the squadron remamed at Kuwait until the morning of the 1st December. The . of November was devoted by those who remained at Kuwait to the exploration of the town and its environs; and Her Excellency Lady launch 1 members 0f tlle sfcaff made a t0u1 ' of ba y in a ste am In reporting the results of his tour to the Secretary of State, Lord Curzon subsequently remarked, with reference to his visit to Kuwait : — Here, as at Masqat, I found that the visit itself, quite apart from any fresh promises or engagements, was regarded by the ruler as finally hindini; him to our cause and as setting the seal npon the protection and overlordship of the British Power. 'f • r, ? e ^t in his private conversation with me the Shaikh, after stating explicitly that he had severed all connection with the Turks, and that he repudiates relations with any other power than the British, asked that he might receive from us 11 i'A 'I 0 l. oii and an allowance. But these favours were evidently sought, as ratification of a relationship regarded by the Shaikh as already in existence rather than as vhe initial steps m a new and more defined regime. Investigation of Khors 'Abdullah and Musa, 30th November and 1st December. ,Ab - Tlle ' Lawrence ' and ' Sphinx ' entered Khor 'Abdullah early on the morning of the 80th November, and masthead flags were lowered at 6-30 a.m . in order to avoid the necessity of exchanging courtesies with luikish posts in view of which it was necessary to pass, the existence of which was not recognised by the British Government; the first of these was the Ras-al-Qaid post on Bubiyan Island, where the Turkish flag was found hoisted. The 'Lawrence ' and ' Sphinx ' arrived at 11 -30 a.m . at an anchorage below the junction of Khors Zubair and Umm Qasr, the Lawrence having touched slightly at the eastern end of Warbah Island through shaving the spit too closely. The Umm Qasr fort, two fl 160 mi i eS i taIlt \ was seen occu pied ; but no flag was visible on e nagstaff there during the stay of the ships^ which lasted from 11-30 ^ even i n ^ when the ships passed down Khor Abdullah on their return to the open waters of the Gulf, the Turkish flag was stiU floating over the post at Ras-al-Qaid.

When this difficulty had been surmounted, the ships ran at full steam up Khor Musa to its junction with Khor Qanaqeh^ and thence for a short distance up the Khor Qanaqeh branch. In the evening the a Lawrence' and a Sphinx ^ rejoined the squadron at a rendezvous in latitude 29° 48' north and longitude 49° 8' east. As a result of these explorations Major Burton, Vice-Consul at Kesults of Muhammareh^ was ordered to investigate the land approaches to Khor inB P ectlon * Musa, and subsequently despatches were addressed by the Government of India to His Majesty's Government in which the extreme importance of both inlets was explained. In that relating to Khor ■'Abdullah the desirability of steps being taken to secure the withdrawal of the Turks from Bubiyan Island was strongly emphasized. No opportunity occurred for a meeting between the Viceroy and the Correspon- Shaikh of Muhammareh in the territories of the latter, and it was dence with considered inexpedient to arrange for an interview elsewhere. Shaikh the Shaikh o£ Khaz'al however sent Lord Curzon a very courteous letter by the hand of Major Burton, Vice-Consul at Muhammareh, to which the Viceroy n replied in a similar tone. The visit to Bushehr, 2nd and 3ra December. Bilshehr, which was reached on the morning of the 2nd December, Arrival at was the scene of an incident by which the success and completeness of the Buahehr. Viceroy's tour were to some extent marred. In order that the circum stances may be understood, it is necessary to explain the arrangements which had been made with the Persian Government for the Viceroy's visit to the ports of the Persian coast. The subject was first broached at Tehran in a note which Sir Preliminary A. Hardinge, the British Minister, addressed on the 26th of September arrange- 1903 to the Mushir-ud-Dauleh, the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs ; ^® at p er ^^ in this note the character and object of Lord Curzon s intended cruise Q 0lir t t were described, and it was suggested that receptions suitable to the Viceroy's rank should be arranged by the Persian Government at the places in Persian territory where he might touch. The Persian Govern ment received the suggestion favourably, and about the 19th of October the A'la-ud-Dauleh, at the time Governor-General of Fars was selected to welcome the Viceroy at Bandar 'Abbas on behalf of his royal master. On the 22nd of October Sir A. Hardinge informed the Viceroy of the detailed arrangements which he wished to propose to the Persian Government, and on the 25th of October Lord Curzon expressed his entire approval of Sir A. Hardinge's programme, which the Persian authorities also accepted without demur. In view of this fact, and of the difficulties which subsequently arose, it Is advisable that the principal items of the original programme should be2650 Modificatioas of pro gramme in troduced by the PBrsian GoFernment. placed on record. At Bandar ^Abbas, the first port to be visited, the Persian Governor of the Gulf Ports would proceed on board the Viceroys vessel and accompany the Viceroy ashore; at the landing place the Viceroy would be received by the Governor-General of ¥ars, who would then accompany him to the British Vice-Consulate and pay him the first official visit; later the Viceroy would return the Governor-GeneraPs visit at the Persian Government House, and in the evening would dine with him. At Lingeh there would be no ceremonies of importance. At Bushehr the Governor of the Gulf Ports would visit the Viceroy on board his ship and present the Karguzar and other Persian officials; in the evening the Governor-General of Pars would dine with the Viceroy, and the next day would entertain him on shore at lunch or at dinner; but separate official visits would not be exchanged, these having taken place already at Bandar ''Abbas. On the 25th of October Sir A. Hardinge had a farewell audience of the Shah and was charged by His Majesty to convey to Lord Curzon assurances of his warm esteem, and of the pleasure which he felt at Lord Curzon's revisiting Persia; and on the 27th Sir A. Hardinge with Major Douglas, Military Attache at Tehran, started from Tehran to join the Viceroy in the Gulf, leaving Mr. Grant-Duff, a Charge d'Affaires/' to act as his locum tenens. The British Minister arrived at Eushehr on the 15th of November and left the same day in the 'Sphinx' for Masqat, where, as we have seen, he met and conferred with the Viceroy on the 18th 9 Hardly had Sir A. Hardinge quitted the capital when the Persian Government began to depart from the accepted programme* The A^la-ud-Dauleh had already commenced to make difficulties about meeting Lord Curzon at Bandar ^Abbas, which he said he could not reach in time, and he had demanded the sum of £5,000 from the Persian Government to enable him to take a large armed escort with him; but Sir A. Hardinge informed the Persian Government that it was desirable that the first meeting should take place at Bandar ^ Abb as, rather thaii at Bushehi^ and he also pointed out that, as the streets could be lined by the local garrison, the provision of a special escort was unnecessary. On the ?j6th of October however, before his departure from Tehran, Sir A. Hardinge was constrained to telegraph to the Viceroy inquiring whether he could visit Bushehr before Bandar ^Abbas, as the Governor- General of Ears was travelling with a large retinue and asked for more time to make his preparations. To this Lord Curzon on the 28th of October replied that, in consequence of engagements already undertaken, it was impossible that the order of his tour should be altered. On the 29th of October it became certain that the Governor-General of Pars would not meet the Viceroy at Bandar ''Abbas, and that it would be necessary to agree to a reception there by the Governor of the Gulf Ports. Subsequently, on the 11th of November, the Persian Government officially informed Mr. Grant-Duff at Tehran that the Salar-i-Mu'azzam, Governor of the Gulf Ports^ Would receive the Viceroy on the 22nd of November at Bandar ^Abbas, and that the A^la-ud-Dauleh would meet him at Bushehr on the 2nd of December. ^ As we have already seen, the Salar-i-Mu^azzam did, in accordance with this arrangement, meet Lord Curzon at Bandar ; Abbas;but His Excellency did not land as lie would have done had the Gover nor-General of Ears been present there^ as at first intended. The second modification which the Persian authorities desired to introduce into the programme was of a more serious character, and their efforts to obtain it gradually brought about a situation in which Lord Curzon found himself obliged to decline landing at Bushehr. The first step was an offer made by the Persian Government on the 27th of October—the day of the British Minister's departure from Tehran— to provide a residence for the Viceroy at Bandar 'Abbas and another at Bushehr; the terms in which the offer was made seemed to imply that the Persian Government expected the Viceroy to live on land during his stay at both places instead of on shipboard, and Lord Curzon accordingly asked Sir A. Hardingeto explain to the Persian Government the reasons which made it difficult for him to take up a fixed residence on shore. The Persian Government, however, continued to press their offer, and, on the 28th of October requested that the Viceroy would consider the house which they would provide as being an official residence foi the reception of visitors on land; their invitation, as reported by the British Charge d'Affaires at Tehran, concluded with the significant 'phrases— a This will enable the Governor-General of Ears to pay the' 'Viceroy the first visit. If the Viceroy has not an official residence^ ' provided by the Persian Government, the latter wish the following ^ ' change to be made in the programme The Governor-General of Pars ' ' to receive the Viceroy at the landing place, and to proceed together to the ^ ' Persian Government House, where the former will receive the Viceroy/ This was the first indication that the question was regarded by the Persians otherwise than as one of courtesy merely; but as they asked for an immediate reply, it seemed that they attached some importance to its settlement. On the 29th of October Sir A. Hardmge- then at Kashan on his way to Bushehr-recommended, m order to save discussion, the acceptance by Lord Curzon at Bushehr at least, of a pro formd official residenee on shore for the purpose of receiving the Persian Governor-General's official call ; and the Viceroy on the same day decided to act upon this recommendation and also agreed to the proposal, advanced bythe Persian Government on the 38th, that he should aceom- pany the A 'la-ud-Dauleh to the Persian Government House. On the 30th of October further light was cast upon the attitude of Negotiation, the Persian Government by a verbal message which the Mushir-ud-Dauleh sent to Mr. Grant-Duff, the British Charge d 'A &amp;ires at Tehran ; xt was to the effect that the Persian Government expected the Viceroy to make the first visit unless he had an official residence provided by the Persian Government. This suggestion elicited a vehement protest from Sir A H ardiLe, who had now reached Isfahan in the course of his journey j and on refeipt of the Minister's letter from that place, about the 12th of November, the Mushir-ud-Dauleh endeavoured to repudiate his mes- + Wv r rarit-Duff His explanations were incredible, for the mes- ' Naww&amp;b Husain Quli Khan, an official of SVenir rS Offio., f. consultation with «hom Mr. G re „t-D.« the Persian joreig re porW the message and by whom a copy of t\t^rhSJt g Xn e Lay for the information of his chief.On the 2nd o£ November it transpired that the Governor-General of Fars wo aid reside, daring Lord (Jurzon^s stay at Bdshehr, at a house which was five miles from Bushehr and was connected with the town only by a very inferior road ; also that he proposed to give the official Persian banquet in Lord Curzon^s honour at this highly inconvenient place. The Viceroy, who at this time was suffering from indisposition, on becoming aware of these circumstances gave it to be known that, unless the banquet could be arranged in some Persian official residence at Bushehr town, he would be willing to dispense with the compliment- altogether. Later it appeared that the house selected by the Persian Govern ment for the Viceroy^s residence on shore was one known as the Mid-hat - ud-Dauleh's (or the Malik's) at Eishehr, ^ very difficult of access from Bushehr; and on the 22nd of November the Persian Government enquired whether the Viceroy would prefer this house or the Persian Government House, generally known as the Chaharburj, at Bushehr ; in asking this question the Mushir-ed-Dauleh intimated, not obscurely, that it was hoped the Mid-hat-ud-Dauleh's house would be chosen. On the 25th of November Sir A. Hardinge, replying on behalf of Lord Curzon to the Persian Government's inquiry of the 22nd, explained that the Mid-hat-ud-Dauleh's house was unsuitable, and proposed that, unless the official residence for the Viceroy could be provided in Bushehr town, the A'la-ud-Dauleh should pay his ceremonial visit to Lord Curzon on board ship or, preferably, at the British Kesidency at Bushehr. On the next day, the 26th, orders were given by the Persian Government to prepare the Chaharburj for His Excellency's reception; but, notwithstand ing this, on the 27th a hint was indirectly conveyed to Sir A. Hardinge that the Shah would be annoyed, and would probably attribute it to the Minister's advice, if the Chaharburj were selected instead of the Mid- hat-ud-Dauleh's house. It should be noted that when Sir A. Hardin^e met Lord Curzon at Masqat he did not anticipate any trouble about the arrangements at Bushehr; nor, indeed^ did the difficulty become serious ftntil the arrival at the latter port. On the 30th of November Colonel Kemball arrived at Bushehr from Kuwait, and had an interview with the A'la-ud-Dauleh and his assistant, Nawwab Husain Quli Khan, C.B., the Persian Foreign Office functionary once already mentioned ; this individual belonged to a family having connections with India, he had for may years been First Secre tary of the Persian Legation in London, he spoke English and French, he had accompanied the Shah on his European tour of 1902, and on the present occasion he was attached to the Governor-General of Fars as a representative of the Persian FWeign Office. At his interview with Colo nel Kemball the A'la-ud-Dauleh announced that he had received distinct orders from his Government and from t|ie Shah which precluded his paying the first visit to the Viceroy at the British Residency; while Colonel Kemball on his side pointed out that, as the A'la-ud-Dauleh was himself occupying the Chaharburj, it could not be regarded as the Viceroy's exclusive residence, and that an interchange of visits between the two while occupying the same building would be little better than a farce. Various alternative arrangements were then discussed, and # rhe Micl-hafc«d«Dau leh or Malik-u-Tuj jar was a former Governor of the Gulf Ports2653 it was finally proposed that a house in Bushehr, on the sea face near the British Residency^ which had been occupied by the late Kargnzar, should be prepared for the Viceroy's use ; this was the a Amlriyeh/ , a house built^ and formerly occupied by the Darya Baigi, Governor of the Gulf Ports. Regarding this suggestion the A^la-ud-Dauleh promised to consult the Mushir-ed-Dauleh at once by telegraph, for, the Shah being now atQum^his personal orders could no longer be obtained- Colonel Kemball at this time reported that great trouble had been taken by the A^la-ud-Dauleh in providing proper landing accommodation, and also in preparing the Chaharburj. On the first of December Mr. Grant-Duff at Tehran visited the Mushir-ud-Dauleh, by whom he was informed that it was quite impossible that the Governor-General of Fars should visit the Viceroy at the British Residency, but that a telegram had been sent to the A ; la-ud-Dauleh directing that either (1) another house should be prepared as the residence of the Viceroy, where the first visit should be paid him by the Governor-General, or (2) when the Viceroy arrived he should be conducted to the Chaharburj and there receive the Persian official visit; the Mushir- ud-Dauleh added that the programme had been approved by the Shah and could not be altered further, and that Lord Curzon, being the guest of the Shah, could not be allowed to occupy any but a Persian house. On the same day a second interview took place at Bushehr between Colonel Kemball and the A^la-ud-Dauleh, at which the latter stated that the &lt;c Amiriveh ^ then in the occupation of the Persian Imperial Customs, had been chosen for the V iceroy's official residence ; and that he r the A la ud-Dauleh, would accompany Lord Curzon to it from the Chaharburj and pay him the first visit there. The Salar-i- M ii/azzam, alarmed at the turn matters were taking, now feigned sickness and asked for the services of the British Residency Surgeon. Such was the position of affairs when Lord Curzon arrived off Bushehr on the 2nd of December, and it was immediately placed before him by Sir A. Hardinge. The &lt;&lt; could not be properly ar ranged in time, and it was out of the question that Lord Curzon should reside under the same roof as the A^la-ud-Dauleh, as in that case it wou be believed in Persia that no visit had been paid him by the Persian After consultation it was decided that, as no suitable Decision of tlie Viceroy, not to land at Busliehr. representative. . ,, i i ? house had been provided by the Persiau Government adherence should be required to the spirit of the original programme by which the A la-ud- Dauleh was bound to pay the first visit to the Viceroy at a British consular building. Sir A.

Mr. Grant-Duff then went in search of the ^Ain-ud-Dauleh^ but that official also succeeded in eluding his visit, although Mr. Grant-Duff remained in attendance at his house until 10 p.m . The same day, in compliance with telegraphic orders from Sir A. Hardinge, Mr. Grant-Duff addressed a note to the Mushir-ud- Dauleh, informing him that the Viceroy had explained to the Governor- General of Fars through the British Political Resident that the positive refusal of the Persian Government to authorise the ordinary courtesy of a first visit at the British Residency made the question one of principle, involving the dignity of His Majesty's Government, on which His Excellency could not compromise; that the Viceroy was accordingly compelled to abandon the idea of landing at Bushehr ; and that he would sail for India on the evening of the next day. This note remained unanswered until the 5th of December, and the squadron left Bushehr on the evening of the 3rd. The reasons for declining the offer of the Amiriyeh ' were that it was a hurried makeshift, acceptance of which would compromise the dignity of the Viceroy in the eyes of the Persian people, and that, after the stratagem used by the Persians to inveigle the Viceroy into paying an apparent first visit to the A^la-ud-Dauleh at the Ghaharburj, it was necessary to make that dignity apparent by insisting on the Persian official visit being paid at the British Residency * ; nevertheless the refusal was tempered by an offer on the part of Lord Curzon to make use of either the ' Amiriyeh ^ or the Chaharburj after the official visits had been exchanged. Two other questions which entered into discussion had assisted to aggravate the controversy. The first was that of salutes. At Bandar ^Abbas no difficulty arose in connection with salutes; the port was saluted by the British flagship with 21 guns, which the Persian gunboat ' Persepolis ' returned ; 31 guns were fired also by the Persians in the Viceroy's honour; and the Salar-i-Mu-'azzam on boarding the a Hardinge ' was received with a salute of 17 guns. On behalf of the Viceroy a salute of 31 guns was at first claimed at Bushehr, this being the number ordinarily fired in his honour by the Governors of the French and Portuguese possessions in India; but the Persian Government, in promising to allow the Viceroy 31 guns at Bushehr, stipulated that the Governor- General of Fars should receive an equal number in case he visited any of the British ships. Lord Curzon had no objection to this arrange ment ; but, as under the British Admiralty Regulations not more than 19 guns could be fired in honour of the Persian Governor-General, it had to be renounced; and Lord Curzon consented to be received with 21 guns, the number originally proposed by the Persian Government. The second point occasioning friction was a suggestion which had been made to the A'la-ud-Dauleh, that, instead of paying the first visit to the Viceroy at the British Residency, he should pay it on board the ' Hardinge. 33 This suggestion was not strongly pressed, nevertheless it was misrepresented * In 1906 it was ascertained that it had always been the custom for the Governor of the Gulf Ports to pay the first visit to a British Admiral arriving at Bushehr, and that at the British Residency in the town. In April 1906 the Governor went eyen further and paid the first visit to Vice-Admiral Sir E. Poe on board the British flagship.2655 by the A^la-ud-Dauleh to his Government as an arbitrary demand that he should come off to the Viceroy^s ship ' like the Sultan of Masqat/^ and also as having been made by the British authorities an indispensable condition of the Viceroy's landing*. The A^la-ud-Dauleh also failed to return an official call which was paid him by the British Naval Com mander-in-Chief. The incident^ terminated on the spot, immediately became the Subsequent subject of diplomatic discussions in which the initiative was taken by discussions the Persian Government; on the 9th of December the Persian Minister in London informed Lord Lansdowne of the facts as communicated to him by the Persian Government and drew His Lordship^s attention to &lt;e the very discourteous action of the Viceroy^ which would be extremely JJ ' injurious to the relations of the two Governments On the minuter features of the controversy which followed it is unnecessary to dwell. The opinion of His Majesty^ Government, reached on the 12th of January 1904, was that the matter was not one justifying a demand for a formal apology from the Persian Government. In the first place it could not, according to international practice, be claimed as of right that the Viceroy should be received as the King^s represent ative when visiting, in the course of a tour, the dominions of an independent sovereign at whose court the King was already represented by a duly accredited Envoy : all that could be asked was that he should be treated with the courtesy and respect due to an official of the highest rank. Again, there was no precedent for the claim that a Persian Governor should conduct a foreign representative, or official of whatever rank, to the Consulate of his country and there pay him the first visit; on the contrary, the ceremonial insisted on by the Shah was in exact accordance with the procedure laid down by the protocol of Turkmanchai for the reception of foreign Ambassadors in Persia. Besides, it would be difficult to argue that there was any want of courtesy or friendliness in the programme proposed by the Shah, inasmuch as it had been at first accepted in full by Lord Curzon. Nor was it unnatural for the Shah to feel that, by the adoption of the ceremonial desired by Lord Curzon, he might appear to acknowledge a claim on behalf of the Viceroy to some pre-eminent authority in a part of Persia; and, more over, the ceremonial at Bushehr would form a precedent for the reception of a Russian Governor-General in Northern Persia. Accordingly^ on the 25 th of January, a memorandum was delivered to the Persian Minister in London in which was stated that His Majesty's Government saw no advantage in a discussion of the details of the incident; that they fully appreciated His Majesty the Shah 's desire to give a fitting and honourable reception to the Viceroy; and that they greatly regretted that His Imperial Majesty's intentions should have been defeated by local difficulties and objections : at the same time they thought that the arrangements made at Bushehr were hardly in accordance with the Shah's courteous intentions, and they considered that the main responsibility for the unfortunate failure must rest with the Persian authorities. Attention was also drawn to the A'la-ud-Dauleh's omission to return the British Admiral's call. The Persian Government, however, did not accept this view of the case, and the discussion was almost immediately re-opened in consequence2656 King Edward's message to the Shah. Misrepresen tations by the Persian Government. of a statement by Lord Percy in the House of Commons on the 3rd of February 1906^ that a the form of ceremonial originally arranged between ^ a the Persian Government and His Majesty^s Minister at Tehran was*' ' subsequently modified by the former in certain particulars before the ' ^ Yiceroy's arrival at Bushehr/^ and that a the desire and intention ' ' expressed by His Majesty the Shah of showing courtesy and hospita- ,} 'lity to the Viceroy was unhappily frustrated owing to the arrangements ' ' locally made.^ On the 22nd of February the Persian Government^ through the Persian Minister in London^ formally signified their dissent from Lord Lansdowne^s memorandum of the 25th January and their own opinion that the British officials were responsible for the Bushehr incident. The matter was now submitted to His Majesty King Edward. His Majesty was pleased to approve Lord Lansdownc's memorandum of the 25tK January^ and he commanded a special message to be conveyed to the Shah. In this message, while emphasis was laid on the friendly sentiments animating both nations and on the cordial reception given to the Viceroy at Bandar ■'Abbas, it was intimated that the King was unable to consider that the proposals made by Lord Curzon and Sir A. Hardinge as to the ceremonial at Bushehr were in excess of what was suitable, oi that the Viceroy was otherwise than justified in deciding that the alternatives offered to him were not such as could properly be accepted; but it was added that, in view of the friendship happily existing between the two countries, it would be a mistake to make the incident the subject of prolonged discussion. About the 23rd of March the A^la-us- Saltaneh, the Persian Minister in London, had an audience of the King at which a communication in the above terms was made to him, and the mess age was also sent to Sir A. Hardinge at Tehran for delivery to the Shah. When the royal message was delivered by Sir A. Hardinge to the Mushir-ud-Dauleh, a special audience of the Shah not having been deemed necessary,—it was found that the Persian Minister in London had conveyed to his Government an erroneous idea of the purport of the message, and efforts were thereupon made by the Persian authorities to obtain a modification' of its terms. This was of course refused, and the British Minister at Tehran was cautioned to avoid using any expression which might be construed as an apology. The affair thus ter minated. While these discussions were in progress, the Persian officials and Government did not neglect means of giving currency to their version of the case. Shortly after Lord Cnrzon^s departure an article appeared in the Persian newspaper ' Muzaffari ^ at Bushehr, in which it was stated that, according to the arrangements agreed upon, the Viceroy was to have visited the A^la-ud-Dauleh first at the Chaharburj and that his call was to have been returned at the ' Amiriyeh and the whole incident was represented as a striking example of British bad faith. It was believed that this article was inspired by the A^la-ud-Dauleh ; but the Salar-i-Mu^azzam showed scant consideration for the editor, whjm he arrested and caused to be bastinadoed on the 11th of December. On the 25th of January 1904 the Persian Foreign Minister sent a cypher telegram to the Yamin-i-Nizam in Sistan in which, various essential particulars being suppressed, a misleading account was given of the arrangements for the Viceroy^s visits to Bandar ^Abbas and Bushehr uponv ■ if and the m ; i ■jit ? prfi i vano«s^ ' -veb » 2657 and the breakdown was attributed to Lord Curzon^s insistence that he occupy, and be conducted by the A^la-ud-Dauleh to, the British Resi dency instead of the house provided by the Persian Government. In the beginning of March 1904 a further written communication was received by the Yamm-i-Nizam in which the false statement was added that the Viceroy had demanded that the A^la-ud-Dauleh should come on board his ship and conduct him ashore ' as the Imam of Masqat had done' : this second communication was in the form of a circular addressed by the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs to all Persian Ambassadors and Ministers at Foreign Courts and it was dated the 14th of January 1904. Finally on the 13th of Julj* 1904 the Persian Foreign Minister telegraphed to the Yamm-i-Nizam that the King of England had ' personally expressed his regret ^ to the Persian M inister in London, and that the incident might be considered closed. That the Persian Government originally intended to give the Viceroy a highly honorific reception does not admit of doubt, nor that the visit was at one time within measurable distance of being an unprecedented and unique success. A friendly article which appeared in the Tehran newspaper 'Iran' of the 3rd November 1903 exemplified the general state of feeling in Persia at the outset. The A^la-ud-Dauleh, who was deputed to meet Lord Curzon, was a Qajar of the Persian royal family ; he brought with him, to do honour to the Viceroy, 2,000 men from Shiraz besides the chiefs of many of the principal tribes in Southern Persia ; and he incurred lavish expenditure in decorations and other preparations at Bushehr. According to a statement made afterwards by the Mushir-ud-Dauleh it had been arranged that, during the banquet to be given in honour of the visit by the A^la-ud-Dauleh, a personal telegram should be received by the Viceroy from the Shah, conferring upon him the order of the ' Timsal ' in diamonds, which is usually bestowed on special Ambassadors. After the incident it seemed to be expected that the A^la-ud-Dauleh would be made a scape-goat, for he showed signs of great perturbation and disappeared suddenly from Bushehr on the 9th of December 1903, giving out that he was going to Basrah,but on the following day he unexpectedly returned, In February 1904 he was summoned to Tehran on business, and in the course of the year he temporarily lost his employment under Government, but the cause remained unknown. It is noteworthy that soon after Sir A. Hardinge^s return to Tehran at the end of January 1904, at an audience which he had of the Shah, His Majesty's demeanour was extremely gracious and he made friendly inquiries about the Viceroy without referring at all to the Bushehr episode. The unfortunate occurrence at Bushehr may probably be attributed, in part, to a remonstrance which it had been necessary to address a few days previously to the Persian Government with respect to Sistan affairs j in part to a fear, which gradually overcame the Shah, that the reception of Lord Curzon in the manner that the latter desired might be construed as an admission that the Viceroy of India enjoyed an exceptional position' in regard to the coast of Southern Persia; and, in part, to wilful misre presentations by the A'la-ud-Dauleh, who was possessed by inflated ideas of his own importance. It is possible also that the Viceroy's visits to Hormiiz, Qishm and Hanjam may have produced an impression which was not anticipated upon the Persian mind. ^ Explanation and results of the inci dent.2658 On the whole the Persian Government^ who posed as the aggrieved party yet did not obtain the reparation which they sought, must be regarded as having had the worse of the diplomatic encounter. The failure of the Bushehr visit probably gave satisfaction in some quarters, and the A'la-ud-Dauleh received a letter from the Russian Consul-General at Bushehr, of which he made free display, congratulating him on having struck a notable blow in the cause of Persian independence. As reported by His Highness the Agha Khan of Bombay, the non-official classes in Persia were much annoyed at the failure of the visit to Bushehr and ascribed the action of the Government at Tehran to Russian influence.* ^British 11 To return from ^is digression : on the afternoon of the 3rd December, subjects and before leaving Bushehr, the Viceroy received on board the ' Hardinge' address by a large deputation of British subjects and residents, who presented an Lord Curzon. address of welcome. The address was couched in the following terms :— May it please Your JExc ellency, —We, the British and British Indian subjects of His Majesty King Edward VII, Emperor of India, beg to offer to Your Excellency, on this memorable and auspicious occasion, our respectful welcome to Bushehr, and to express the gratitude which we feel towards Your Excellency for having deigned to visit these shores. As residents of Bushehr, the most important trade centre in the Persian Gulf, and the place, which (since the year 1763) has been the headquarters of British commerce in the Gulf, we feel that our claim is a good one to welcome Your Excellency on behalf of the whole community of British subjects throughout the south of Persia. Your Lordship will no doubt have observed that Bushehr possesses few natural facilities as a harbour and port of call for our steamers. Its position, however, as the startingr point of the principal caravan route from the south into the interior of Persia, and^ the fact that it has been, for more than a century, the headquarters of the Resident in the Persian Gulf (an officer serving under Your Excellency's orders), have given it a special importance of both a commercial and political nature. Of late years the stress of foreign co npetition has been somewhat severely felt, and we were, at one time, afraid that the interests of British trade might be to some extent forgotten. The recent action, therefore, of His Majesty's Government, in concluding a separate Commercial Agreement with Persia, thereby preventing any further alteration of the Customs Tariff without the consent of His Majesty's Government, is gratifying to us, as being a welcome, thouofh perhaps a tardy proof, that our interests are not being neglected. We may also allude to the recent Commer cial Mission to this country, and the advantages of the more rapid mail service, for which, we believe, we have to thank Your Excellency's Government, as further proofs that our Government is alive to our welfare. ^We think there are several points of interest deserving consideration, among&amp;t which we would ment'on the want of harbour facilities, the inadequate arrangements for the landing and delivery of carsro, and the great necessity for the imurovement of the caravan communication with the interior. It would also be satisfactory if the Persian Government could carry out a scheme of reform, which, we have reason to believe, has for some time engaged the attention of its European advisers, for insuring the more rapid and efficient settlement of commercial claims. At present, com plaints are frequent as to the difficulty of obtaining such settlement, owing to the dila- toriness of the existing procedure, the frequent conflict between concurrent authorities, and the consequent difficulty of procuring execution of judgments, even after the}' have been pronounced. We trust that the scheme of reform, to which we hare ventured to allude above, will do something to remedy these evils. It is a source of special gratification to us that it is Your Excellency who is the first Viceroy of India to pay a visit to the Persian Gulf. Your Lordship's interest in Persia is well known j the country and its politics are known to no one better; and the book which was written by Your Excellency some 13 years asjo, still retains its place *Four years later the fact of Russian interference and irrefragable proof.2659 as tlie standard work on Persia in any language. We take this visit therefore to be a signal proof that Your Excellency's interest in tlie country remains unabated ; and if we may be allowed to say so, it gives us a special encourageinent in our endeavours to maintain the pre-eminence of British, trade in the Persian Gulf and south of Persia. We should take this opportunity of expressing our high appreciation of the valued assistance rendered to British interests and commerce by our esteemed Resident, Colonel Kemball. In conclusion, Your Excellency, whilst reiterating most respectfully lour welcome, we trust that Your Excellency's tour in theae waters has been a pleasant one, and that Your Lordship will carry back to India not unpleasing recollections of your visit. We beg to subscribe ourselves on behalf of the British and British Indian Com^ munity of Bushehr. ^ « Your Excellency s Humble bervants, r E. Gentleman. G. 0. Gunning. G. A. L awes. W. Van Lennep. T.

From here the Bushehr is the he ^^ er mild co n trol 0 ver the waters of the Gulf, and over the wlefupSofpS Bhor«. the results of wh.ch I have enjoyed so many op^tum-ties of observing during my present cruise. From this place the principal caravan route strikes into the interior of Persia, tapping its chief cities in succession, and ultimately reaching: the capital; here the wires of the Indo-European telegraph which in their earlier stages have brought Persia into connection with Europe, which nave done so mucn to strengthen the authority of the Shah in his own dominions, and which carry the vast majority of the messages from India to England, dip into the sea; here is the residence of the Persian official who is charged with the Governorship of the Persian Gulf Ports by his Government, with whom our relations are invariably those of the friendliest nature ; and under these combined auspices—the British bringing the bulk of the trade and policing the maritime highway and the Persians gradually consolidating an authority which, though once precarious, is now assured— this place has grown from a small fishing village into a flourishing town of 20,000 inhabitants ; it has become the residence of foreign Consuls and Consular officers; the leading mercantile communities who trade in Southern Persia and Turkey have their offices and representatives bere ; there is seldom a day in which steamers are not lying off the port; and Btishehr has acquired a name which it is safe to say is known in every part of the world. This development is the more remarkable because, as yon have pointed out, no one could contend that trade is conducted here under favourable conditions ; ou the contrary there are few, if any, of the conditions that naturally mark out a place as an emporium or channel of commerce. Bushehr can hardly be said, even by the widest stretch of imagination, to possess a harbour. Landing is difficult and often impracticable. The trade-route that penetrates into the interior is one of the most difficult in Asia ; and in land you do not find a people enjojing great wealth or a high standard of comfort or civilisation, but instead you encounter tribes leading a nomadic form of existence ; and even when you come to the settled paits of the country and the larger cities, the purchasing power of the people does not appear to be great. The fact that a large and flourishing trade has grown up in spite of these drawbacks is an irrefutable proof of the dependence of Persia upon outside supply for many of the necessities and most of (he luxuries of life. Since 1 first visited Bushehr fourteen years ago I have always indulged the hope that, as time passed on, progress would be made in all these directions, and I agree with you in thinking that the Persian Government could embark upon no more remunerative form of expenditure than the improvement both of the maritime and the inland approaches to this place. During the time in which I have filled my present office in India T have done my best to facilitate the prngress of trade, and to ensure the adequate protection of British interests in the Gulf and in the adjoining provinces and territories. His Majesty's Government at home have also been warmly interested in the matter. The result of these efforts has been that we have gradually developed the Nushki-Sistan trade- route, which is now a recognised channel of commerce to Eastern Persia. We have appointed a Consul in Sistan, and are about to extend the telegraph thither. We now have Indian officers residing as Consul at Kirman, and as Vice-Consul at Bandar 'Abbas, where we are about to build a Consular residence ; we have connected Masqat by cable with Jashk, and we hope for further telegraphic extensions in the interests of trade. We have established a Political Agent at Bahrain, and we now have a Consul at Mnhammareh and a Yice-Consul at Ahwaz. The Karun trade-route has made substantial progress 5 , and has been supplemented by the newly opened road, with caravanserais and bridges, through the Bakhtiyari country to Isfahan. A British Consul has also been appointed to Shiraz. We have improved and accelerated the mail service to all the Gulf ports. British India steamers now call at Kuwait as well. During the same period British medical officers have been lent by us to the Persian Government to conduct the quarantine arrangements in the Gulf. Simultaneously British interests have found a most vigilant spokesman at Tehran in His Majesty's Minister, Sir Arthur Hardinge, who has been good enough to accompany me through out my present journey, and with whom I have enjoyed many opportunities of discussing common interests of the Home and Indian Governments in Persia. I hope that our discussions may be fraught with advantage to the interests that we jointly represent. Altogether, Gentlemen, I think it may be said that in Bushehr, you receive an amount of attention that is not always extended in similar measure to places so remote head-quarters, while the fact that a British Resident lives in your midst and is able personally to look after your conoerns, which I am glad to learn from your address2661 that he does entirely to youi* satisfaction, is a farther guarantee for their protection. I hope that the position which British interests thus enjoy, and which is neither artificial in origin nor recent in growth, since it is the result of nearly a century and a half of patient and laborious effort both by Government and by private enterprise, may long be maintained, and that Bushehr may continue in the future, as it has done in the past, to be the centre from which this benign and peaceful influence radiates throughout Southern Persia and the Persian Gulf. Soon after the conclusion of this ceremony Sir A. Hardinge took leave of Lord Curzon and returned to the British Residency^ whence he proceeded a few days later to Muhammareh and the Karun, afterwards returning via Basrah, Baghdad and Kirmanshah to Tehran. The squadron also dispersed, H. M. S. 'Fox' alone remaining on duty with the Viceroy and being despatched in advance to the port of Pasni in British Makran. Shortly before midnight the c&lt; Hardinge' left her anchorage off Bushehr and the return voyage to India was commenced. Departure from Bosh' ehr. f rour ^ i End of the cruise, 4tli to 7th December. On the 4th of December the Persian coast remained in sight to the northwards during the greater part of the run. Bare mountains, cleft by ravines and totally devoid of vegetation, appeared to rise directly from the water's edge though really distant many miles inland; here and there small fishing villages of a few huts, surrounded by trees, could be descried upon the shore. Eocky islets, among them Hindarabi, Qais and Farur, were passed bv daylight, and, rounding Has Musandam by night the ' Hardinge' again entered the Gulf of 'Oman. On the morning o e 5fch of December she reached Jashk, where a the mountains in the back- ' ground are as bare as on other parts of the coast, but under the Eastern ^ ' sun they present every shade of colour, from lilac and ochre to an almost ashen white.' After a short halt at Jashk for the purpose of despatching and receiv ing telegraphic messaages, the Hardinge' proceeded on her way to Pasni, where she arrived early on the 6th of December and was received with the usual honours by H. M. S. Fox,' the ' Patrice Stewart a so being- present in harbour. Lord Curzon landed to inspect the port, and m the afternoon a Darbar was held on board the ' Hardmge for the Chiefs and Sardars of Western and Southern Baluchistan, who were accompanied bv Colonel Yate, Agent to the Governor-General m Baluchistan itus was the first visit paid by a Governor-General of India to any place in Makran. Just at sundown the Agent to the Governor-General left the ' Hardinge. 1 ' immediately his salute had ceased, the bugles sounded the retreat and the flags fell simultaneously on board all three vessels, o-iving to the cruise a fitting and dramatic conclusion. I he Jdardmge weighed anchor after nightfall and entered Karachi atnoonthe next day, — - 1 1 - 0 01 pmns from the Manorah tort. the 7th of December, under a salute of 31 Voyage down the Gulf. Durbar at Pansi. From Buslielir to Jaslik, a distance of 494 miles, the ' Hardinge _ Speed of had maintained a speed of 154 knots an hour, and from Jashk to toyage a speed of 17 knots, the latter distance being 344 miles. Between | j 1 I ll2662 Jashk and Pasm the speed sometimes even exceeded 18 knots and was possibly greater than had been attained^ up to that time, by any vessel in Persian or even in Indian waters. General Remarks. Weather. Political results. The cruise was favoured by bright and pleasant weather, and the sea was smooth throughout, except during the visit to Sharjah. The heat of the sun at Masqat was considerable; but at Kuwait, on the contrary, the sky, after the Viceroy^s departure on the a Lawrence,^ was overcast, and a cold breeze blew from the north. During the last two nights in the Gulf the moon was full, and its radiance, reflected from the sea, outvied the flashing fields of phosphorescence which had been a remarkable feature of the cruise by night at its commencement. The tour was an effectual demonstration of British power and influence, and it was carried out at an opportune moment, shortly after the stress of foreign rivalry in the Gulf had been overcome by other and more substantial means; it was without precedent in the history of the Gulf; and it is likely to remain for long an event without parallel in local annals. Perhaps the most solid results of the cruise were the joint observations made in connection with questions of naval strategy by the Viceroy and the Naval Commander-in-Chief; but the political results, also, must have been great, and on the whole they were auspicious. In Persia, it is true, the cruise had an ending which was not calculated to re-act favourably upon international relations; and it was afterwards reported to have excited alarm in Turkish ^Iraq and to have aroused Anglophobe feelings among the Turkish official class. On the Arabian coast of the Gulf, however, the visits to Masqat, Trucial ^Oman and Kuwait were entirely successful, and appreciably strengthened the political bonds which connect those principalities with the British power; of the visit to Bahrain it can only be said that, if it was not foUowed by any visible improvement in the behaviour of the recalcitrant and wrong-headed Shaikh of the islands, it marked at least, in an unmistakeable manner, the intention of Great Britain to exclude all foreign influence from that important centre.2663 APPENDIX BRITISH AND FOREIGN DIPLOMATIC, POLITICAL, AND CONSULAR REPRESENTATION IN THE COUNTRIES BORDERING ON THE PERSIAN GULF.

Explanation of the system of transliteration. A few remarks are necessary to explain the system of transliteration adopted in the Gazetteer. Classical Arabic can be transliterated accord ing to fixed principles, for not only is the spelling of every word well established by usage but the phonetic values of the characters are also invariable; in other words, the letters are known and they are always pronounced in the same way. Transliteration of the names falling within the scope of the present Gazetteer is, however, as will appear from the following considerations, a more difficult and complicated matter. In the first place, though a majority of the names are Arabic, many are Persian and some are Baluchi. Further the correct spelling of a large proportion, even in the native character, is uncertain; indeed it may be said that those alone have an established orthography in the vernacular that are derived either from proper names or from common- nouns, and that the spelling of names of uncertain derivation is a matter of conjecture. More disconcerting still is the fact that local authorities frequently differ even as to the sounds of the names which they are invited to reduce to Arabic character. A final insuperable obstacle to 'transliteration' in the strict sense is the circumstance that the same Arabic letter is not always pronounced alike in the various parts of the Gulf or even throughout the same district. In the circumstances it has been deemed best to attempt as far as possible &amp; phonetie rendering of each name into English supported in every case by the equivalent in Arabic character : the place in the Gazetteer of the equivalent, which has invariably been obtained from native sources, can be ascertained by means of the index. An advantage of this double system is that it enables us to do away in the English with a multiplicity of marks distinguishing different uses of the same consonant and to dispense in the Arabic with vowel-marks which from the phonetic standpoint would sometimes be positively misleading. The above considerations have therefore led to the adoption of the following system of Transliteration for the Gazetteer 1—Vowels. 1. The Vowel Fat-hah I- is represented in all cases by A. except in the majority of names, etc., in Persia when the vowel is followed by Persian He (^) in which case it is represented by E. Examples—Bahrain, Bandar ''Abbas, Musallamiyah, Bushehr, Muhammareh, Nasiriyah and Nasiriyeh. 2. The Vowel Kasrah 7 is represented by I. Examples—Lingeh Dizful, Sikandariyah.2738 3. The Vowel dhammah ± is transliterated U or O according to pronunciation. Examples—Kun^ Muharraq, Hormuz, Fao, Hofuf. 4. The combination of Fat-hah and alif I ^ is represented by A. Examples—Makran, Ahwaz, Sohar. When^ however, the combination occurs at the end of a word the alif is usually phonetically short, and is therefore treated as short A, e* g.y Karbala. 5. The combination of Fat-hah and yai cj ? jl is represented by A I. Examples—Bahrain, Wais, Kuwait. 6. The combination of Kasrah and Yai ls ^ is transliterated I. Examples—Minab, Qasim. When, however, the combination occurs at the end of a name, it is treated as an ordinary Kasrah and is represented by short I. The vowel in this nosition is as a rule short. jl Examples—Qalali, Liravi. 7. The combination Fat-hah and wao ^ is written A U or O according to pronunciation. Examples—'Hautah, Dohah, QaFeh Nau (p. 1237). 8. The combination dhammah and wao j) ^ is represented by tJ and in some cases also by O. Examples—Karun^ Shusk, Bd Musa, Ruas-al-Jibal Khojah. j -L has also been spelt as short O in a few exceptional cases e. g, Khor (Zoral) Audhan and Zirko. In these instances the sound is short as in f so Where the sound is distinctly long, U is used in accordance with the main rule e.g. Khur Mmab. When the combination of j occurs at the end of a name, it is as a rule phonetically short, and is therefore treated as a dhammah and represented by short U or O. Examples—Mughu^ Basidu, Hilu (Wadi al) , Zirko. The comparatively few cases of final j ~ having the sound of long Us are however represented by U according to the general rule. Examples—Samait (al Bu), Mahair (al Bu). II,—Consonants* The consonants are transliterated as shown below. Persian. Remarks. B A A Or ^ alif maksurah is represented by B A e. g. Bu Musa PThe above system, of which £ and o are notable instances, has been jadopted throughout, even in transliterating old and well-known names generally spelt otherwise. Examples—Makka, Madinah, Jashk, Qishm ; Khurasan, Qtadhi and Masqat. Ill—Signs. 1. The sign Hamzah L, has been omitted in transliteration as its effect is otherwise sufficiently distinguishable by the marks used on the vowel occurring immediately before or after it, e. g. Zaid oil; Pain ^ * 2. The tashdid —is represented by doubling the consonant over which it stands e, g. Muhammareh, Jinnah. In certain names Tashdid has also been placed on the last consonant to indicate the local pronun ciation, e. g., Hadd, HajJ, Rass, Shaqq, Sirr and Taff. 3.^ Accents [i. e. syllabic emphasis) have not been marked, as there is ordinarily no accent when all the vowels of a word are short, and when two or more of the vowels are long, the stress is generally distributed equally between and among the long vowels and, when there is only on long vowel, the accent falls upon it. The accent is however indicated in certain more important and pronounced cases by the sign e. g, Jahalah, Kahafali, Kibisah, Matti (Sabakhat), Qumarah, Sahabah. IV.—Compound Words. (a) The two components in a compound name (in the absence of the Izafat or JI between them) has each been written with a capital and without a hyphen connecting them, e. a,. Bandar ^Abbas, Hayat Davud. (5) When, however, the second member of the compound is a verbal root or is inseparably connected with the first, the whole has been treated as one word whether written in vernacular as one word or two, e. g., Imamzadeh. Sabzabad {c) Components of a compound name of a thing (not of a person or place) without J| or izafat between them, have been treated as one or two words as in Rule (£) and {a) above according to local usage : examples—Alifdan, Ab Ambar, Namakdan. {d) Where there is an izafat, it is represented by I enclosed between two hyphens, as for example in Ab-i-Diz, Band-i-Qir, The Arabic J) has been treated similarly. Examples—Bait-al-Falai Ruus-al-Jibal. (e) The J or J) has been modified to correspond in sound with the following consonant, as for example - Jabal-ad-Dukhan, Sua- as h-S huy ukh.2741 {/) The vowel of J| has been written A when the Jf is not preceded bj another word in composition with it and also when it occurs in the middle of a compound word. But in some Persian names, when the JI occurs in the middle the vowel is represen ted by U instead of A. Examples—Shahab-us-Saltaneh, Muin-ut-Tujjar. (j) The Arabic article J! prefixed to names has, in the majority of cases, been omitted in English. The Arabic equivalents have been utilised to indicate the principal cases in which the use of the article is obligatory. (A) The word ' bin J occurring in the name of a person is written enclosed within two hyphens, e. g. t Yusuf-bin-Ibrahim. When however the word occurs in the name of a tribe or family or of a place associated with the name of a person or tribe, the hyphen is used only between Bin and the tribal or family name, e.g., A1 Bin-Ali and f0 Ain Bin-Muhanna (p. 1524). (*) Compound names composed of more than two words, when not coming under rule [h) above, have usually been treated in accordance with rule [a). Example—Balad Bani Bu Hasan. General. Where necessary to prevent mistakes words have been divided into two syllables by means of a hyphen, e.g., Is-haq which might otherwise be mistaken for I-shaq (j^l, and Rud -hilleh^ ^ ^ for Rudh-illeh ilyi j or W) 18Sxliv CHAPTER 11.

At the end of 1882, it was understood that the Prince had definitively failed to secure, not only a special British concession for navigation such as Colonel Ross sought, but even the opening of the river to foreign trade in general^ in regard to which he had corresponded with Mr. Thomson. The Shaikh of Muhammareh at this time possessed a steamer of some size, the Karun which made voyages on the river. While the above negotiations were in progress the Ahwaz rapids^ which formed the chief difficulty in the way of steam navigation on the Karun, were visited, carefully surveyed, and reported on in December 1881 by Captain H. Wells, R.E., who was accompanied by Mr. W. Baring, First Secretary of the British Legation at Tehran, and who also examined the road question. In 1882 the practicability, as a trade route, of the Karun supplemented by a road leading northward was discussed, with reference to both physical and political obstacles, by Sir H. Bawlinson, Sir O. St. John, and Mr. W. Baring of the Tehran Legation, in elaborate papers. The opinion of Sir H. Rawlinson was most unfavourable, he regarding ' the whole question of opening up the Karun^ as &lt;f a delusion and a snare'; and the opiniors of the other authorities were guarded. Their memoranda were reviewed in the follow ing year by His Britannic Majesty^s Minister at Tehran, after a report on the road question had been submitted by Captain Wells; but the final result of the whole discussion was vague and inconclusive for want of precise data in the form of surveys. During the lull which ensued in the British proceedings with reference to the opening of the Karun, a curious scheme was propounded to the Zill-us-Sultan by M. Vauvillier, a French engineer in the Persian service. His report, dated 26th February 1883, though closed at Kermanshah, bore no internal evidence of personal acquaintance with the country to be traversed. His idea was to connect the Diz river and the Karkheh near Dizful by a navigable canal; and the means of exploration which he suggested were two or three steam launches and a short transportable Decauville railway, the launches to carry the railway where there was a sufficiency of water and the railway to carry the launches where there was not, the whole expedition thus progressing triumphantly from Muhammareh to Kermanshah, It does not appear whether any steps were taken to give effect to this seemingly crude fantastic project,</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000884.0x000149_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/20/C91/2</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000884.0x000149</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/20/C91/2</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf.
