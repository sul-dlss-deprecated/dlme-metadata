(riecelyed under ooYer of Colonial iUffice ifeleBpatcti dated ^OUi i&gt;eceiat&gt;€r 19Si&amp;j JL~ Lady Lorotdy Mills called to see me this afternoon. She has arranged to leave London on the 18th for Port Said which will be her headquarters for some time. The plans for her further journey are very vague and would be dependent on what opportunities offer themselves. She would certain ly visit Egypt and the Hejaz. She had introductions to the Governor of Jedda and Sir Andrew Ryan, our Representative there. She hoped to obtain facilities from them that would enable her to see something of the country. If it were feasible she wanted to make her way as opportunity offered from Jedda to Aden, thence l^y way of the Hadramaut coast, Oman and the Persian Gulf to Koweit and Basra, then travelling through Iraq, probably by the Nairn route, to Damascus and thence to Transjordania and Palestine. She realised that her proposed journey from Jedda to Koweit might present difficulties and that it would probably be quite impossible to make any part of the journey over land. She thought it might be possible to travel by stages along the coast by vessels trading between various ports. In that way she might see something of the people and the country. Her plans, however, would depend entirely on the advice and assistance she received at Jedda. She hoped that the introductions she held would serve to enlist the help of the authorities in the Hejaz for the furtherance of her plans but she would be guided entirely by the advice she received from them. She understood fully the risks she might run if she acted contrary to official advice. On one of her previous journeys she had had an actual experience of this and had been told ( I think she said it was by Sir Percy) that her action on this occasion might have caused the despatch of an expedition for -A herler rescue and that she was not worth it. ^ She does not propose to stay for any length of time in Iraq which she has Tisited before and she has signed the usual undertaking, of which a copy is attached. Lady Dorothy Mills holds passport Ho.195852 dated December 16,1925. This has been endorsed for Egypt, Sudan, Hejaz, Persia, Iraq, Syria,Palestine and Transjordania. She has been told that endorsement for Yemen and Oman cannot be given and she has been warned of the very grave risks that she may incur unless she conforms strictly to the advice given her by His Majesty^ Representatives at Jedda, Aden, and elsewhere.
