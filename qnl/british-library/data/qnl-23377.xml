No. 643 Bahrain, Octr 25th, 1932. i V l V I enclose for your information and comments two copies of a letter from Major Holmes, which I myself suggested that he should write, pointing out the danger of the artesian water supply diminishing owing to lack of control. I suggested that he should write such a letter as he is an expert in the matter of well boring. In a covering letter to me he says, 'It may be that you consider that the letter has too strong a political flavour, coming from one whose desire is to avoid any semblance of meddling in the affairs of the Bahrain Government. I would therefore ask you to hand a copy of the letter to the political Agent of Bahrain before forwarding it to H. E. Shaikh Hamad; after taking the opinion of the Political Agent I leave it to your discretion as to whether you b think it wise to forward the letter or not' / ld^ ^ . r s (ddiflf ^ Jt, \ ■xd- 2 - I do not think that the letter is in any way political and I see no reason why it should not be forwarded to Shaikh Hamad as an opinion from an expert on a technical matter. A statement from Major Holmes on this subject would be more convincing to Shaikh Hamad than the opinion of a layman. You yourself have constantly drawn my attention to the danger of boring too many wells but until we can make some definite legislation on the subject it is difficult to refuse permission to persons who ask to bore wells and at present all well owners refuse to believe that there is any danger from waste or bad boring. Some of Shaikh Hamad’s near relations are the worst offenders in this respect. Cautain G. G. Prior, I.A., Political Agent, Bahrain.To BAHRAIN, PERSIAN GULF, Dated September 24 t\i 1932 . His Excellency, Shaikh Hamad Bin Isa al-Khalifah. RULER OF BAHRAIN. Y our Excellency, Greetings : As the person icho suggested to Major C. K. Daly, the Political Agent, at the time (A. D. 1925) in Bahrain that the lack of a satisfactory Fresh Water Supply for drinking purposes for the Islands of Bahrain may be overcome by the judicious drilling of boreholes to tap the Artesian Waters which l surmised from surface indi cations existed beneath the surface of a considerable area of Your Excel lency s Dominions, I wish to enume rate the following facts for the serious consideration of Your Excellency. In order to test the theory of the presence of Artesian Wdters being available in Bahrain, Your Excellency sanctioned the drilling of a number of boreholes. The work of boring these was carried out under the writer s supervision. The results obtained from the aboee mentioned boreholes were most satisfactory as the wells yielded an ample and pure fresh Water Supply, which because of the liberality of Your Excellency, was made available free of cost to the whole of your people, rich and poor alike. It is to be noted with much satisfaction that since the Artesian Water has been in use for all domes tic purposes, no serious epidemic of it WW tl ji •il a,**)! i it • *• ; VjbxI ^r&lt;l2T JU; .i), ^ji Jr ti aljll c~i- ^ .U jnu &gt;i-i Alfcj c.^ 4 ««|U«»N diiJ s\mA J V—»*■ j\ a)i 9 »V . • juadl A J ill ft A** ti* ‘A-—* f+S' (jr •jifti jV 'Vi j}# jj jS •A.lj • j\ 1^.# jWI - aJK A&gt; d*j A.Ci «La Oajl jl &gt;*l*.m* &lt;jUVt \tld- Zj •Ll) *jt» ^ *S*a»&gt; j — isc - »&gt; A^jlyjVf «Ai/ (j- A* ^ A 0 * 0 A^jU Ajl j“j)l\ old!

Every care should be exercised to preserve the Water Supply as a permanent monument to the wisdom of Your Excellency and benefit to your people' In order to secure the permanency of the Artesian Waters, strict Govern ment control of all existing wells and future boring and, equipment of new wells should be instituted without delay. The water-carrying strata which yield Artesian Waters are four in number, situated on horizons ranging from 120 ft. to 400 ft. below the sur face of the ground. The bulk of wells drilled in Bahrain tap the first, second, and third water bearing zones. Luring the past 5 years, almost with out exception, the head (Artesian Pressure) has been reduced; and the quantity of water-discharging from these wells has in some instances, diminished en volume by as much as SO per cent. The surface head has fallen from 24 ft. to 14 ft. during the same period (Five years) — a very dis turbing fact—and such evidence of impairment of production cannot be regarded with impunity or indifferen ce by the Bah rain Government. . .LfiVI ft ijjuij jsXiS •iijij uu .LU ^ fj? fp ol A—i J 4 ;* . ^1 jjJiMiPij Jjix-dt aaIILi ( i)j~f Jf t&gt;i Jl \ Y • -A*.'

In other words, a gradual exhaustion—at its storage area, — of &gt; the Artesian Waters is taking place—a most alarming state of affairs to contemplate. I consider that the steady dimi nution of the Artesian Water flow is due to two facts (a) The entire absence of Govern ment control of the Artesian Wells and well boring (b ) The wells being permitted to flow unchecked-both night and day-which allows an enormous amount of water to run to waste Whereas if the flow of water from the wells were placed under control which can be done by the most simple and economical of mechanical methods and the waste of water thereby reduced to a minimum, there would, be less danger of injuring the Artesian Waters at its most vital piont i.e. its storage area. Without Government control I see grave danger and risk of seriously depleting the Artesian ] I niters of Ba h ra in. The foregoing portion of this I&lt;tter deals with the A rtesian Waters drawn from the 3 upper water bearing Zones.

It is the * deepest seated, and lies between 280ft. a nd 400ft. below the surface. It is imperative that great care be exercised in drawing from this formation, as it is the formation from which the numerous Natural Springs of these Islands derive their water. loo liberal and uncontrolled tapping of this stratum will cause the Natural Springs to gradually diminish in out flow of water and lessen the head of the incoming water. Thus, owing to gradual lowering of the level of the Natural Springs, the area of land it is possible to irrigate from any of the Natural Springs will steadily decrease. I respectfully submit to Your Excellency that regulatians should be framed by the State Government and put into immediate operation, having as their object the preservation and control of the Artesian Waters.-the most valuable N it aval Asset these Islands possess. If some control is not organised without delay T fear that the Artesian Water Supply is in very grave danger of being seriously damaged and its benefits greatly impaired. I respect fully submit the folloiv- ing points in connection with the Artesian Waters of Bahrain as to aduit requires immediate attention and my reasons for recommending that they be given most careful atten tion.

(2) In all countries where irri gation of agricultural and garden area is in vogue, the Government of these countries, without exception, insist that all waters capable of being used for irrigation or power purposes shall be under the sole control and be the property of the Government, to be used so that the greatest benefitfrom such waters should devolve upon the people as a whole and not upon indi viduals. All waters irrespective whether their source be from Rivers Darns, Springs or Artesian borings are invariably the property of the Government. (3) The domestic Water Supply where the whole of the population benefit is one thing and it is good thai Your Excellency decreed that the domestic waters should be free to all, but Your Excellency has not decreed that the Artesian Waters are free to be tapped, indiscriminately to be used for agricultural purposes without cost, permissiom or any Gov ernment supervision or control and tapped in a most unscientific manner: thereby endangering the very existence of the Artesian Waters. The Bahrain Government, at present, are not drawing revenue from the water used for agricultural purposes.

Memorandum:- With reference to the question of Government control of water from artesian wellik; I propose asking Shaikh Hamad to approve of the following regulations which are * partly based on Major Holmes T letter on this subject. I should be obliged if you would let me know what you think of my proposals and whether anything should be added or altered. Proclamation regarding artesian wells . In order to preserve the water of Bahrain which is now being wasted so much that the level of the water is sinking, and to prevent waste water from lying about which breeds mosquitoes and has in recent years increased the amount of Malaria in the towns of Bahrain, the Govt, has made the following regulations. 1. The public are reminded that the water of Bahrain that lies under the surface of the ground is the property of the Government, as in all other countries, and not the property of the individual who owns the ground. '2. No wells may be bored without permission of the Government which must be applied for in writing. No more wells may be bored at present in the towns of Manaman, Muharraq, niad ana Gaxali wnere the water nas n •i M *has already become a danger to public health. ‘'S. Every well which shall be bored after this Alaan, and every well which now exists, must be pro vided with a valve and a pipe above the ground to a height of four feet in excess of the head of water for the purpose of preventing water being wasted. ,/ 4. The minimum amount of pipes (casing) to be used is 90 feet and only casing of good quality must be used, in order,to prevent leakage under the sur face and contamination of the ground. If it appears to the Government that a well is leaking below the ground it will be closed down. ,f 5. iiil wells are xiaole to inspection uy an official of the Government from time to time. '6. bepth and grade and size of casing used in each well will be decided by the Government. *7. a license must be taken out by every person wishing to bore a well on which a stamp of Rs 100/- must be fixed. 8. At present a fee of Rs 50/- per annum will be charged for each well used for agricultural or other private purposes. if 9. It was previously decreed that artesian wel used as a domestic water supply shall be free to all, but this decree does not apply to wells used for agri cultural purposes. Since drafting this letter 1 have received your D.O. No. 61. I have discussed the price and matter of valves with Haji Khalil Kanoo who has already put in severalf —s -3- several whicli are very satisfactory. He tells me they could not be made locally but would cost about Rs 100/- including labour, joints and the extra upright piping. I have during the last week put one in on the well in H. 11.

I understand that there is a certain amount of difficulty over the siting of the artesian well which we require for the water supply for the new R.A.P. Camp on Muharraq Island, and my Works Officer at Bahrein sent me a drawing showing alternative sites which have been proposed for the siting of this well. Both these sites are shown at the centre of the North and South boundaries of the landing ground, but I fear they would be quite impossible as it will be necessary to have a pump and pump house at these sites and this would constitute a danger to aircraft in that position. The pump and pump house would be necessary owing to the distance from the new suggested sites to the position of Jfche tank in the Camp. zj You will of course realise that the camp entirely depends upon having a satisfactory water supply and when the siting of the camp was first arranged there was no idea that a well would not be allowed inside it. 3 . I would be very grateful if you could possibly get the Bahrein aovernment to waive their conditions that no new well can be nearer than one mile from an existing well. I understand that the three wells existing in the date gardens adjacent to oujb camp site to the West, are normally running all the time, and would therefore appear to be used wastefully* The installation of a well in the centre of our camp would it seems not really affect these wells if they were to be controlled. 4, Failing permission to sink a well at the originally proposed site in the Camp two other sites are possible. One is at the North West corner of the landing ground near the officers mess and the other is at the North Bast corner near the patch of land where we have allowed a Sheikh to encroach on to a corner of the landing ground. Both of these sites will entail2 . alteration of our design in the water pumping plant which has already, unfortunately, 'been submitted to the Air Ministry and possibly the Plant may- have been ordered. These two sites fail, however, to fulfill the conditions of being a mile from any existing well. 5 Had it been realised that there was any question of a well not being allowed with in the camp site, arrangements would have been made earlier to site the well at some different place. I should like to add that from a point of view of security also it would be preferable if we could have the well within the boundary of our camp, rather than across the other sine oj- the landing, ground. Should you be able to get the Bahrein^ Q-ovennment to agree to either of the sites within the boundaries of our camp, that is the original site or a site near the officers mess, X shall be glad if you will signal me and inform the Works Officer at Bahrein so that he may take action to get the well commenced, as the water is required for building operations which will be starting shortly* Copy to Works Officer Bahrein. lt n Section Officer Basrah£*GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN. 1 7 ) D. 0.

Dear Hallows, I discussed with Shaikh Abdulla and Shaikh Sulman the question of granting permission to the Royal Air Force to drill an artesian well at Mohar- raq. It is a matter of general importance not only affecting Shaikh Abdulla’s water supply. We appreciate the necessity for the water sup ply. Shaikh Abdulla is not willing to give a pipe from his well as he thinks this might cause misunaer- stending in future should the water decrease. Shaikh Abdulla has three artesian wells in his garden at Busaiteen and there are two wells in the garden south of his property. I We agreed that permission should be given for an artesian well to be drilled near the ’’Police Hut” shown on the Royal Air Force map or at the north east corner of the landing ground, whichever site is most convenient. The site near the Police Hut is inside the R.A*F*^closed area and as far away as possible from Shaikh Abdulla’s garden. I am sending the map with this letter.

Reference your memorandua CE/939/1/C, dated the 23rd August 1939. 2. The question is one of considerable difficulty in relation to efforts now in progress to conserve artesian water supplies in B; hrain. Unrestricted drilling of artesian wells has unquestionably had grave effects, and in response to advice from the Hoa*ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to the Bahrain Government to take effective steps for the conservation of water the latter have only recently restricted the spacing of new wells to a interval. 3* It will be readily understood that any attempt to bring pressure on the Bahrain Government to agree to the location of a new well within 260 feet of an existing well belonging to the senior member of His Highness the Shaikh’s family can only have the most unfortunate repercussions on the efforts now being made to conserve water. It Is an admitted fact that the rigorous application of the one«»mile rule would rule out any possibility of the R.A.F. drillinga well at all in their new or old property in Muharraq,, and the Bahrain Government have of course no intention of applying their rule to the detriment of the H*A.F* On the other hand it will be accepted that every effort shoud be made to meet their views in regard to the location of a well* 4 * X forward herewith a copy of a corainunication received from the Adviser to the Bahrain Government in regard to this matter* Xhe map referred to th&amp;M is 'Muharraq Island Proposed Layout, No.CF. 115/39*, on which the 'Police hut* is shown* 5 * I strongly recommend the acceptance of the so-called Police Hut site for the well from every point of view* I have explained the situation in detail to the Air Liaison Officer, Bahrain and to your Works Officer both of whom, I believe, appreciate the necessity for the offer of this advice. It is regrettable that it may result in slightly increased costs for a pumping installation, but I suggest that freedom from future difficulty may well Justify this* 6 * I must refer to the remark in paragraph 4 of your memorandum — *we have allowed a Shaikh to encroach on a corner of the landing ground** I do not think that there has been any encroachment on B*A*F* land* Bahrain*H'fn’ - 6 / 49 .

However, the irrigation ditches in the garden are deep (approximately $'0 n ) and a well could be drilled and provided with a flow pipe at irrigation ditch level, This will alleviate the present acute shortage of water in the garden; such a well, however, would not be a prolific producer.

Jufair No.2 It is recommended that this well be completed to produce from Water Zone T, B Tf only. In order to do this it will |e necessary to pull the existing casing, ream the hole to approximately 250* (exact depth oo be determined by sample examination^, cement casing at that depth and deepen the hole to approximately 360* to take advantage of full penetration of Zone rt B”. Care will have to be taken 4 ? place cement opposite the Zpne 'A' members to prevent migration on the outside oi the casing. This, however, should present no difficulty. Jufair No.3 If the recommendation for Jufiair No2 is carried out, we would recommand that this well be completed to produce from the conforamole members of Zone. 'A' by cementing casing at approximately Idu (exact depth to be determined by sample examination;.

In this case well No.3 should be similarly completed or. in view of the fact that there is not much advantage to be gained by having two wells m close proximity completed in one zone, plugged to sun ace with cement.
