Rai Bahadur Gokhaldas Khemji, wealthy merchant v of Muscat, has been approached by Khan Bahadur Mirza Muhammad Ahmad (former Persian now Iraqi subject) and Dr. Puransingh (renegade Bikh now Iraqi subject), both of Basra, to invest capital in, and accept Directorship of Bank which they are promoting to be called ’’India and Persian Gulf Bank Limited”. Proposed Initial capital is five lakhs of Rupees, Bead Office of Bank is to be in India under direction of Puransingh's brother and branches are proposed to be opened in Dubai, Kuwait and possibly Muscat. 2.

It is regretted that, due to an error of procedure, the consent of the Gov rn. .ent of India under Rule 94 A of the Defence of India Rules to the issue of caoital for this bank was granted without consulting you. It will be seen from the enclosed copies of correspondence between the Government of India, Finance Department, and the Reserve Bank of India that application for capital for the floatation of this bank was made at the end of last year, and that the Reserve Bank of India's recommendation in favour of issuing the capital, on the strength of which the Government of India acted, was based on purely financial criteria, in respect of which the proposals appeared unobjectionable. Your comments would be appreciat ed in this connection on the points made in paragraph 2 of the Reserve Bank of India's demitofficial letter of 28th June, 1945. 3. It should meanwhile be pointed out that consent to the issue of this capital under Rule 94 a of the Defence of India Rules does not in any way prejudice the subsequent attitude of the Government of India to the operations of the hank and in particular to the establish ment of branches in Dubai, Kuwait, Muscat and elsewhere. Should the bank wish to open branches at any of these places its requests will be dealt with on their merits and the fact that it has been allowed to issue capital2 . in India will not affect the decision in any case. The issue of the above has been authorised. I NaROTTaM 1 ML CONFIDENTIA L No. C/218. Office of the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Camp, Shiraz. - 22nd August, 1945.

No. ACD .779 / B.S.E. 94-45 dated 28th June 1945 from the Reserve Bank of India, Agricultural Credit Department, Bonbay to the Finajnce Department, Government of India, New Delhi. With reference to your letter No.D 7103-F.I./45 of the 19th June '45, the promoters of the India and Persian Gulf Bank Ltd., made an application towards the end of last year for the necessary permission to make an issue of capital which was referred to us for our recommendations by the Examiner of Capital Issues. It was stated in the application that the Bank will engage in the business of financing trade between India, Iraq, Iran and the Middle East countries generally, and would be meeting a greatly felt need, banking facilities being rare in those territories. After making the necessary enquiries with regard to the promoters of -ed the Bank, we recommencLthat permission may be granted for the issue of capital to the extent of 10,000 ordinary shares of the face value of RslOO/- each, at least 50 per cent paid up, provided that the head office of the Bank is established at Karachi. We were unable to recommend permission being given for the Bank to have its head office in Bombay which is already overcrowded in the matter of banking offices. A copy of our letter to the Assistant Examiner of Capital Issues in this connection is enclosed herewith. Our recommendation to Government on the application was given on its merits as a financial proposition having regard to the relevant criteria laid down by Government for purposes of the control of capital issues in terms of Defence of India Rule 94-A. Our recommendation did not take cognizance nor were we aware, of considerations such as those advancedin paras 3 and 4 of the telegram from Galloway Bushire. Reference is made in para 4 to the bank being incorporated with Iraqi capital and direction* This seems to be only partially correct as although we have nc information as to the relative distribution of its share capital between Indian and non-resident share-holders, a majority of its Board of Directors will be Indians and it is presumed a substantial proportion of its share capital will be held by Indians. As the considerations referred to in Galloway's telegram are of a political character, we do not consider ourselves competent to tender advice with regard thereto except in so far as they concern the methods of financing the trade of India with these countries. TMstrade is at present financed largely by primitive methods, e.g. by remittances of cash in the form of notes and coin, or the drawing ofdrafts anc bundles by private merchants and firms, as bankingfacilities on modern lines are lacking in these areas. In so far as the institution proposed tqbe set up will aim at supplying this need and thereby contribute to the development of the trade of India withthese countries, there could be no objection, on financial and economic grounds to its establishment. gOKFIDENTIAL Copy of D.O No. ACD/70?/BS. C 94-45 dated 15th June 1945 from Reserve Bank of India, Agricultural Credit Dept. Bombay to K.A. Master Esq.,Deputy Examiner of Capital Issues, Governmen of India, Finance Dept. Capital Issues . Reference your D.O. letter No. R/56-EC1/45/2044 dated the 24th March '45. Our opinion on the application of the India and Persian Gulf Bank Ltd. (proposed) is as below. The enclosures to your letter are returned herewith. THE INDIA AND PERSIAN GULF BANK LTD. BOMBAY. v (Proposed)I Authorised : 10,000 ordinary shares of Es 100/- each Es 10,00,000 Proposed Issue : 10,000 ordinary shares of Es 100/- each Es 10,00,000 (Es7,00,000 paid up) It is proposed to start a bank as a private limited co. pany at Bombay with an authorised capital of Es 10 lakhs divided into 10,000 shares of Es 100/-each. The promoters are willing to have the head office at Karachi and a branch at Bombay, if there is any objection to the bank being allowed to have its head office at the latter place. It is stated that the business between India and Iraq, Iran and the Middle East countries has grown considerably and that after the war it may increase further. It is also stated that .banking tr facilities in these countries are limited and the establishmen need of the proposed bank will not only fulfil a very deeply feltZ but will also be very much appreciated by the commercial community trading between India and the Persian Gulf countries The objects clause of the draft Memorandum of Associatior is generally on the lines of Section 277 F of the Indian Companies Act. Under clause 55 of the articles of Association every share carries one vote and as all the shares are of one class and will be uniformly called up, voting rights will be equitable. Under clause 69 the number of directors is not to be less than two or more than seven. Under clause 71 Dr. Puran Singh shall be the Chairman of the directors so long as he remains a director and holds in his own name or in the names of his nominees 25$ of the share capital of the company. Under clause 75 his remuneration shall be Es 6,000/- per annum. Clause 89 provides for the appoint ment of Dr. Puran Singh as the first Managing Director of the nank for a period of five years with a monthly allowance of not less than Es 500/-. Under clause 90 the Managing Director will be an ex-officio Director and will not be subject to retirement by rotation. It appears from the application and from the information we have received from l flthe bank*s solicitors that the number of the proposed directors is nine (4 from Basrah and 5 from India) which would violate clause 69 of the band's Articles of Association. Either the number of the proposed directors will have to be reduced or the clause will have to be amended. The four directors from Basra are stated to be very influential and one of them, Mr. Peter D*Souza, is at present the Manager of the Imperial Bak of Iran, at Koweit, and is stated to have banking experience since 1919. Under clause 70 of the Articles of Association, Khan Bahadur Mirza Muhammed, Dr. Puran Singh and Mr. Seth Abdul Hussain Kaji Nur Mohammed will be the first Directors of the company unless otherwise determined by the company at a General Meeting and will not be liable to retire by ro-tation or to be removed from office by an extraordinary resolution. According to the information supplied by the Solicitors the following five are the proposed directors from India: (1) Mr. Haji Nur Mohammed. He is a Managing Partner of Haji Jethabhai Gokal &amp; Co. which is carrying on business as General Merchants, (2) Mr. Moosabhoy Ebrahim Khetani, Cutch (Bhuj), an export and import genera 1 and provision merchant with business connections in Bagdad and Basrah. On enquiry Mr. Khetan has informed us that he is unable to be a director ov/ing to ill-health but is interested in the proposed bank. (3) Mr Mohindar Singh Behr, Rohtak, a senior prosecuting Sub-Inspector of Police. (4) Rai Bahadur Gohaldas, Merchant and Financer, Cutch, Mandvi. (5) Mr Malik Shankerlal B.B., LL.B., Manager Messrs Malik &amp; Co., Lahore. The confidential reports which we have obtained on the proposed directors indicate that they have sufficient means for the issue of the capital applied for and they have either already agreed to join it as promoter directors or are other wise interested in its ostablishment. Besides, there appears to be scope for a well managed bank for financing trade between India and Persian Gulf countries. We, there-5 fore, recommend that the bank may be permitted to issue 10,000 ordinary shares of Rs.100/- each, to be at least 50^ paid up, of the total face value of Rs.10 lakhs \ provided that the head office of the bank is established at Karachi. We are unable to recommend a new bank with its head office at Bombay which is already overcrowded.® a S C H E T Office of the Political Heaidant Persian Gulf, Bahre&amp;n. 25th October 1945 BAHRAIjST riccei/pt, Proa Ud^Q...

The period of the agreement should be 10 years end the Bank shall have the option to stop business or close down the branch after giving you a six months' notice in advance* The Bank owned by us is registered with the Government in Bombay and a large number of its ahare-holders are British subjects. An extract of its deeds and rules is recorded with the Registrar of the Bombay Province fc pd therefore as you are probably aware no one can impugn its ri&amp;ht in that it is a purely commercial institution and does not interfere in the political matters of the State in which it carries out its business. The terms offered $ou by us have never previously been conceded by any Company or Bank to the Govenment of any State in the world* It would hcve been possible for us to appoint an agent to represent us in any of the ports and to conduct the business of the bank on Agency basis but we prefered to follow a very straightforward and honest policy, our aim at the same time being that the country in which we uo business will benefit from us. The Khoja and Hindu merchants in your country made considerable profits curing the pest 50 years but have paid nothing at all to the local Government and X am quite certain that if you examined this point carefully you would surely realise arid apprpqiate the enormous profits of which your country has been deprived and you will notice that it is essential to grant the required permission for our Bank to go business here* toe now offer 2q% of the net profits of the bank branch ana we reiterate that no company or Banking house has ever made or will make such an offer to the Government of the place in which it wishes to function. Should oui' proposal be acceptable to you, kindly let us know, we will then submit to you a draft agreement which we propose to conclude with you and when agreement is reached on its terms and contents, our Managing Director, dt. puransingh, will arrive for the signing of the agreement.
