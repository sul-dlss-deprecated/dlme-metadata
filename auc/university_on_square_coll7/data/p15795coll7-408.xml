Learning of the January 25 demonstrations through the We are All Khaled Said Facebook page, she returned from France to participate in the protests and took part in most of the days of protests at Tahrir Square prior to President Mubarak’s departure. ###### characterized the demonstrations as a time when “it was as if everything good in the Egyptian character was present in those eighteen days in the Square.” She depicts Tahrir Square as a place where the “complete cross-section of Egyptian society” gathered, with interactions among Muslims and Christians and Egyptians of different social classes. She states that in preparing her book ###### which featured images of signs people held at the demonstrations, she “very carefully tried to pick photographs that showed the different ranges of people who were there,” in terms of socioeconomic class or dress. ###### gives a portrait of the scale of the crowds at Tahrir and describes the organized communal services, like the media tent, nurseries, medical clinics, and food and blanket distribution. She tells of the volunteers providing security at the entrances to Tahrir Square, contrasting this with her experiences of being questioned several times by soldiers when trying to enter the Square with her camera. ###### stresses the importance of internet bloggers and details her own use of social media in staying informed as an alternative to news media outlets. She discusses the diversity in opinion about the revolution, and how that complicated subsequent social interactions. ###### mentions significant events (some violent) from February through November 2011, as well as the developing mood of apathy and disappointment that contrasted with the hope, unanimity, and cooperation of the original demonstrations.</dc:description><dc:date>2011-11-01</dc:date><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:identifier>20111101</dc:identifier><dc:relation>University on the Square: Documenting Egypt's 21st Century Revolution</dc:relation><dc:source>University on the Square: Documenting Egypt's 21st Century Revolution oral histories; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2012, American University in Cairo.
