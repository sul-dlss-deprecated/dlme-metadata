CROSS REFERENCED UNDER:— PRECEDENTS NOTED UNDERon tho nowly-fopnod Eastern Bureau and tho fimcticns of the Basrah Branch. In December last it was decided by His Ma3esty f s Government that in order to combat highly organised German Turkish pro- par 5 anda which were then making rapid headway, a Bureau should be established for the collection and co -ordinr.tion of Islamic and AraMaa Intollic^ce. Its functions wore to cormunicate in formation to the authorities and persons concerned in London, Mesopotamia, India and the Vediteranean, and to prepare mater ial for propaganda in the Indian British and French Press and pamphlets in various are ^s. The Central orking Office was to be located in Cairo. This Bureau has now taken shape; the Cairo Office is conducted by the Head of the Soudan Intelligence Department under the orders of the High Commissioner, Egypt. It communicates through the latter with the Poreign Office London ind direct with the Ccvermnerit &lt;f India and th3 Mesopotamia Expeditionary Force on the other. Although at present its work aa d fuictions will have a special connection with the prosecution &lt;f the war, it is intended that the Bureau shall be a permanent institution for use after peace has been proclaimed. , r A.B. Fforde, I.C.S. has been deputed to Cairo to represent Indian interests on the Bureau. The Mesopotanian Office of the Bureau is located at the Head quarter Office of the Chief Pcliti'cal Officer, Mesopotamia Expeditionary Force, Fho has been placed in charge of the Bureau work by tho Army Comiaandor. Miss G.LJJell has boon ap- pointed as Corresponding Officer to work under Chief Political Officer's supervision.

My own view, which ia confirmed by information received from truatworthy aourcea, io that the local population is far more intereated in the local Pearl Market then in reli^io-politioal matters which take place in foreign parta, and that aa long aa the pearl market remains pood - aa at preaent - the Bahrainia will not have much intereat to expend on other affairs. II Feeling regarding Turkiah Atrocitiea at Kerbala . The account of tho TutMah atrocities in erbala for warded here by the Chief Political Officer, copies of whioh were distributed amongst the Persian and Shia community -fears, haa made a great impreaaion. Sheikh Khalaf bin Sheikh Ahmed the head Shia Qazi of Bahrain^who came to aee me the other day, without any prompting whataoever himaelf broached the aubject, and held forth vigoroualy in the atrongeat terms of opprobium on the 'inchuman', w savage n , and w irreligious' action of the Turks on the occaaion in queation. I am in formed that he expreaaea the aame viewa to hia followera in hia Moaque, and other placea of assembly. The Sunni com munity, whoae feelings aa Sunnia are of courae hoatile to Shiaa, are - aa wan to be expected - more or leaa indifferent to .to the peraeoutions of Shiaa bv their fellow aeotarians# III, General Moalem feeling In Bahrain towards Turkey . The looal feeling towards Turkey will alter aocordinj? to various changing factora, even auoh apparently diaoonneoted ffaotora aa the fetate of the looal pearl market, but neverthe less there are certain other faotora which will incline, in my opinion, to keep the local feeling atable within certain limits. In order to indicate theae I venture to ma lr e aome - remarka which - though they include Bahrain in their view - have neceasarily alao a wider application. Ho non-Turkiah locality of the Viddle Eaat, includinr of course Bahrain, which haa had any experience of Turkiah rule, either direct or indirect, either by ita own exnerience or by more fortunately witneaaing the experience of othera, haa any doaire for Turkiah rule. The people of the Middle Faat ha«e had ample opportunity to teat the truth of the Arabic (or Kurdiah) proverb that W where the Turk aeta hia foot the grasa never growa' • At the aame time to the Bahralnl Voalem rvunni, as to other Sunnia throughout the world, the Sultan by reaaon of his holding the Khalifate, ia of courae hia Spiritual Head, and to all ?^oalema - Sunni and Shia alike - the Turkiah Empire renreaenta the laat great Islamic atate. The non- Turkiah Moslem may, in fact haa, no liking for the riovemment of the Sultan, he nay much prefer to live under the flag, ot the protection of the infidel, but aa a matter of aentiment ho feela that if, and when, the 'urkiah ^nrnire falla, there falla with it lalara aa an Independent political power in the' world. In estimating therefore Mohammedan aentiment probably juat aa much weight haa to be given to the political, aa to the religioua, preatige of the Turkiah Empire, and the local feel ing here with regard to the Hedjaz revolt aeema to go to prove thia. The loaa of M occa, to aay not' ing of aif and Jeddah, ahould have had - if we regard the religioua view-point aione - a very aerioua effect in alienating local feeling from the Turka1 7 ''urks, yet guoh haa not beon tbe oane, and thourh tbo reli- gioua prestige of the ^urka may have received a blow, yet enough of their political preeti^e atill remains to keen the Bahrain Sunnis oro-Tirrk and anti-3herif. . I have atated above that to the :&gt;hia alao, the ^urlriah Enmire haa a political if not a reli^ioua appeal. But the TurMah atrocities at Kerbala, already alluded to, have in my opinion completely alienated Bahrain Shia opinion. On the other hand memoriea in the Eaat are aometimea ahort, and any further propaganda on the aame aubject - even if it contained nothin/?; new - would havo a rood effect here. To aum up:- (1) No Hahrainia either Shia or Simni, have, or ever will have, any deairefor Turkish rule. (ii) As lon^ aa the Turkish Empire remains an entity there will always be, amongst the Gunnis here, an under-current of pro-Turkish sympathy, and since thia sentiment ia baaed aa much on political aa relisrioua /rounds it will not be very much affected by occurrences lowering only the religious prestige of Turkey. (Though of course the Hedjaz Revolt is of military and political significance also) (3) The Bahrani Shias, alienated by the ^urkish atrocity at Kerbala, are at present anti-Turkish, and will in all probability remain so, especially if ']'ept un to the mark' by further propaganda. jj.

A short note on the Bahrain trade with the Arab mainland - Hassa, Najd, and Qatar - may be of Interest, as I notice that Oommeroe is one of the subjects which comes within the scope of the Bureau. Some information on this subject is supplied in the Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, under the headings I'assa, Qatif, Oqair, and Qatar, but some fresh information is now presented, and the firures for trade have not been ^riven before. With regard to the firures it must be remembered that they arc very approximate. Trade with the mainland is carried on in native boats, which of course carrv no maiiiifests, and details have been obtained through rouprh estimates kindly supplied bv the local Customs and some Indian merchants. A glance at the map shows that Bahrain, situated as it is in the centre of the ^ulf of the same name - at least we can call it so, since it has no other - and beinjr the only steamer-nort for the mainland which frin ges this Gulf, is in a very favourable commercial posi tion. F'or any imnorts or exports for or from the main land, intended to reach or be brought from the outside world by steamer, Bahrain is the natural, and indeed the only, clearing-house, and we mi^ht exnect its comrercial radi/usradiua to oxtond from tba East Ooast of Qatar - nay from the Khor-al-Odaid beyond which the oomnaroial radiua of the other ateamer-port Dehal nrobably beprina - to Qatif, and aome further j.ndeterminate diatanoe beyond to wards Koweit. Qatar import b Piece-frooda. Rice, and Coffee• Ita only export is pearla which ita Sheikha, in whose handa this trade is, oell in Bahrain. Dates, the inhibitanta of iatar procure for their own conauinption direct from Qatif, and their other neceaaitiea of life - which are verv few - fron Hahrain. There are no Hindu merch mts in Qatar nor would they be welcomed locally ahould they po there. The importance of Haaaa i.e. the district of that name, liea in the fact that it not only takes rrooda for ita own conauription, but that ^ooda for Southern Najd, with its capital Riadh, muat naas through it to roach their destination. Of the two porta of Haasa - Oqair and Qatif, the formor nervea Hofuf, and Najd, and the latter merely the oasis of the aar^e name. nome 50 yeara a/'O thore waa a amall colony of Hindu marchanta in Qatif, whoae busineas could have been by no means unprofitable aa they had a share in the trade oatinated at 15 lakhs of rupeea. Inconaiderate treatment however on the part o^ the Turkish authorities, and general insecurity of their lives and property, forced them to evacuate their position. There are now only two Indiana resident in Qatif now, the representativea of an Indian firm in liahraln. The affairs in Hasaa have of late yeara, however, tak^n a decided turn for t' e better. Greater security « will probably prevail there under Bin Baud t^an under the ma'- e-believe rule of the Turks, and the fact that both Ilaaoa and Najd will be under one ruler friendly to us cannot13 oannot but have a aatisfaotory effect on trade relations between Bahrain and the rainland. It ia at leaot pro bable that trade with Haaea via Bahrain oould be appre ciably increased by judicious ^nushinp^ by obtaining facilities fron Bin Saud for instance for the residence of Indian traders in his dominions etc - but any action in tMs direction would better perhaps be nostponed until it is seen more clearly what is likely to be the stability of Bin Baud's rule in Haaaa, and whether he is likely to retain a firm ptrip on it» Preaent indi- cationa would seem to point to a continuance of his rule there• It may be noted here that Hindu traders are not popular on the mainland, where by their rrroater business ability, and more powerful bac^inc in the wav of orga nised capital, they tend inevitably to take the trade out of the hands of their local comnetitors. So the present method of trade by which Arabs of Bahrain enter into contracts with the Hindu merchants, which contracts the former carry out by visits to the mainland, is the least likely to create friction, and is therefore pro bably the most suitable for the time bein^* At the same time auch a method ia by no meana the best commercially, and for trad© intercourse between Bahrain and Hassa to reach its maximum it would be necessary for ^Tlndu traden to be actually resident on the mainland.

Ho states t&gt;'at he was very well received in Ha&gt;aa, and that no difficulties were made as to his obtaining: his recruits. The general feeling in Hassa is, according to his statement, extremely friendly to us. The whole district seems to be quiet, and caravans ( come and go without molestation from robbers. Abdul Latif Handsel, Bin Saud^ financial agent, is now in Hassa en gaged at the request of Bin Saud in re-oreranising the taxes Customs dues etc. Some of his nchemos have given rise to discontent among the principal merchants, but tMs feeling need not be regarded as of important at present. On the whole the present state of a^fiirs in Hassa seems to be most satisfactory. Abdulla bin Naser appears to be an intelligent and capable individual.

As noted in the Bahrain Trade Report for 1915-1916 Japanese sugar for the first time - to the extent of so-ne 10 per cent of the total import - was introduced into Bahrain via Bombay# and in the last few months from en quiries addressed to local merchants by Messrs. Mitsui Bussan Kaisha Ltd. of Bonbay#the starting of the new Bhtrail line with Bahrain as one of its ports of call, and the increase in Japanese goods introducod into this market, it appears evident that the Japanese are endeavouring to capture at least a share of the Bahrain trade.

'Abdul 'Aziz ibn Sa'ud, the present Hakim of Najd, may be said to have begun his reign in 1901, when he was proclaimed governor of Riyadh by his father Abdul itahman. The Sa ud family were at that time in exile, hav ing been dm en out of their dominions, in 1891, by their hereditary foe, ibn Lashid. In 1902, Abdul 'Aziz with the help of Mubarak ibn Sabah, Shaikh ol Kuwait, iccovered Jliyadh in a daring raid which he led in person and by 190(3 he had so far re-established the old supremacy of the Sa'ud as to carry hostilities to the gates of Hail. During the years succeeding his return to Riyadh he acted in close alliance with the Shaikh of Kuwait, who had every reason for desiring the curtailing of Rashid influence. For the Rashid were allies, and in a remote acceptation of the term, vassals of the Ottoman empire subsidized and backed by Constantinople, and they represented in Arabia the Turkish policy of centralization which the Shaikh was covertly resistin 0 * m his own territories.^ His geographical position on the shores of the Persian Gult had placed him in relations with the British Government; since 1899 we had had a friendly understanding with him and had promised to support him against Ottoman aggression. Put the existence of this connection made us unwilling to see him drawn into the confused and uncertain feuds of the interior, and acting on the principle laid down in 1897 that we were ' not disposed to interfere more than was necessary for the maintenance of ^eneral peace in the 1 ersian Gulf ', we had discouraged him from embroilin 0 * himself in Central Arabian affairs. Ibn Sa'ud, in spite of his growing importance, was outside the limits of our interest, thus appointed, and it was not until Ull that special attention was drawn to him in our official reports. In that year Captain Shakespear, the Political Agent at Kuwait, while on tour, met him by chance in the desert and was hospitably entertained in his camp, ibn Sa ud expressed to him a desire to be received into a recognized relation ship with Great Britain ; he referred to Colonel Pelly's visit to Riyadh in 1865 and to the overtures made to us by his father 'Abdul Rahman in 1901 when a British Agent was first appointed to Kuwait. He spoke in strong terms of the hatred which the Arabs entertained for the Turks and of his own lesentment of their occupation of the Hasa, a province which he was parti cularly anxious to regain, not only because it formed part of his ancestral dominions, but also because it would give him access to the sea and control o^ 0r bribes from Riyadh to the coast. He regarded with grave apprehension 1 11the aggressive policy of the new regime in Turkey and would welcome, if he recovered the Hasa 3 a British Agent in one of his ports, and lie added that our trade would benefit from the increased security which he would maintain on the caravan routes. Captain Shakespear could make no other rejoinder than that the British Government confined its interests to the coast and had never challenged Turkish claims to the ordering of affairs in Central Arabia, with which we had no concern ; that we were moreover on amicable terms with Turkey and should be averse from anything in the nature of intrigue against the Ottoman Government, but in his comments on the report of this interview, Sir Percy Cox pointed out that as the Porte seemed disposed to be intractable in the adjustment of matters relating to British interests in the Gulf, we could not afford to ignore ibn Sa'ud*s attitude. His personal authority had greatly increased, and it would be well to entertain cordial if distant relations with him. The Foreign Office, however, decided that it was impossible at that time to swerve from our policy of strict non-interference. Two years later ibn Sa'ud, without the assistance which he had tried to obtain from us, though he was credited throughout Arabia with having secured it, overran the Hasa, ejected without difficulty the small Turkish garrisons and established himself on the coast at Qatif and Ojair. Captain Shakespear, on his return to England in June 1914, from a long projected journey across Arabia in the course of which he had visited Biyadh, bore witness to the strong personal domination which ibn Sa'ud's vigorous and commanding personality had established, and from other reports it was clear that he was regarded beyond his own frontiers as the coming man. He proved more than a match for the ineffective efforts of the Turks to retake the Hasa; they resorted to diplomacy and opened negotiations with him through Saiyid Talib of Basrah. Early in May Tal'at Beg had formulated in private conversation at the British Embassy the expectations of the Ottoman Government in terms which seemed to his hearers little consonant with actual conditions. He proposed to estab lish a strictly delimited frontier between ibn Sa'ud and ibn Bashid, place repre sentatives of the Sultan at Riyadh and at Hail, and rely upon the guile of these officials to control without the aid of force the actions of the two Amirs. As for the Hasa, ibn Sa'ud would be appointed Mutasarrif of the province, but the collection of the customs would remain in Turkish hands and Turkish garrisons would be replaced in the ports. Nothing was more certain than that ibn Sa'ud appearance on the coast must ultimately bring him into direct contact with ourselves whether we welcomed it or sought to avoid it; and this anxiety underlay and possibly accelerated the action of the Porte. But at the moment Turkish fears were groundless. We were concerned wholly with the conclusion of prolonged nego-^ tiations with Constantinople touching interests in Mesopotamia and the Gulf which w T ere of vital importance, and were less inclined, if possible, than before for Arabian adventure. We made a friendly offer of mediation w 7 hich was refused, and when, in April 191A, the Amir met the British Agent, Colonel Grey, outside Kuwait, he was given to understand that we had recently con cluded a comprehensive agreement wdth Turkey and could hold out to him no hope of support. Ibn Sa'ud was thrown back on his own resources, but these were considerable, and the secret treaty which was signed in May by himself » u n Q ,, n , 1Qlft and the Wali of Basrah, fell short of Tal'at Arab Bureau, 8th October 1916. tt i 1 , Beg s anticipations. He accepted the title of Wali and Military Commandant of Najd which was offered to himself and his descendants as long as they should remain loyal, and engaged to fly the Turkish flag, but he was to have charge of the customs, on behalf of the Ottaman Government, raise his own levies and provide the garrisons for Qatif and Ojair. Deficiencies in the Najd budget were to be met from the customs, and no revenue from any local income was to be paid to Constantinople until such time as there was a surplus—an eventuality of doubtful occurrence. But while exercising in his own territories an authority which w r as in all but the name that of an inde pendent ruler, his correspondence with foreign Powers w 7 as to be conducted solely through the Porte, and in case of war he was to come to the assistance of the Sultan.What wculd have been the upshot of a treaty which so imperfectly re flected the convictions of the contracting parties can scarcely admit of doubt The guiding trait of ibn Sa'ud's character is what must be called a racial rather than a national patriotism, but this sentiment was not likely to evoke sympathetic consideration from the leaders of the Committee of Union and Progress, who were blindly determined on the Ottomanization of the Arabs. As a strict Wahabi, the new Wali of Najd looked with abhorrence on the loose religions principles of the Turks and was far from admitting their pretensions to represent and direct Islam. He had, in conversation with Captain Shakespear, spoken with unexpected vehemence on this point, saying that in his eyes the infidel was preferable to the Turk, since the latter broke the rule he yrofessed to follow while the former acted in accordance with his own law, and to the same listener he declared that he had accepted the terms of the agreement only because he was assured privately that even the . . oo ^ t i small measure of sovereigntv accorded to Arab Bureau, 22nd July 1916. mi u i i • i mi Turkey would never be claimed. The Kuwait treaty was put to the test by the outbreak of the European war and found wanting. The disquieting attitude adopted by Turkey on the outbreak of war between Germany and the Entente Powers produced a profound altera tion in our policy towards the Porte. It became necessary to reckon up our assets in Arabia, and early in October Captain Shakespear, who was in England, was ordered to return to the Persian Gulf and get into touch with Ibn Sa'ud so as to prevent if possible the outbreak of unrest in the interior, and in the event of war with Turkey to ensure that no assistance should be rendered from that quarter. Before he could reach his destination war had been declared. A message had been despatched to ibn Sa'ud informing him of Captain fehakespear's impending visit, recognizing his position in Najd and the Hasa and guaranteeing him against reprisals by sea or land if he would commit himself to enter the lists against Turkey. The Turks, on their side, lost no time in approaching the Amirs of Central Arabia. Their scheme, which was that ibn llashid should aid in the campaign against Egypt while ibn Sa'ud opposed the British advance in Mesopotamia, showed that they were as unaware of the feeling towards them which prevailed among the Arabs as they were ignorant of the conditions of the desert, where the network of tribal feud permits no man to withdraw his forces on a distant expedi tion without fear of attack on his unprotected possessions Ibn Sa'ud, apparently in order to gain time, took advantage of his abiding enmity with ibn Rashid and launched into open hostilities against him. In vain Enver Pasha urged him to abandon private quarrels, sent him a gift of money for the expenses of co-operation with the Sultan's armies, and ultimately entrusted Saiyid Talib with the task of bringing about a re conciliation. At this juncture Saiyid Talib was busily engaged in endeavour ing through the intermediation of Shaikh Khaz'al and His Majesty's Consul at Muhammareh to drive a bargain with the British Government providing for his adherence to us in the event of war with Turkey, but the terms which he put forward were so extravagant as to be impossible of acceptance, and he was still hesitating over Shaikh Khaz'al's advice to him to abate them when the declaration of war left him stranded. Then it was that he saw in his proposed deputation to Najd a providential means of escape from Basrah where his position had now become highly precarious, and he left hurriedly for Ibn Sa'ud's camp, via Zubair. Meanwhile the Wahabi Chief, in response to Turkish ex hortation, had pleaded that he could spare no troops for the 'Iraq till he had reduced ibn Bashid to his rightful state of vassalage. To the British message he replied that he was unshaken in his long-standing desire for intimate rela tions with us. But he was not unnaturally reluctant to take open part with us until he was satisfied that our change of front towards himself was likely to be permanent, and in spile of his personal confidence in Captain Shakespear it was with some misgiving that he consented to his visit. The meeting took place on December 31st at Khufsah near Majma' in Sudair. Ibn Sa'ud spoke with great frankness. Before compromising himself wholly with the Turks he asked that our assurances of support should be embodied in a formal treaty.the terms of which were drafted forthwith. They included a guarantee of complete independence on our part and an undertaking on the part of ibn Sa'ud that he would have no dealings with other Powers except after reference to the British Government. He informed Captain Sbakespear that he had been in communication with the Sharif and with the heads of the northern 'Anazah confederation and that they were resolved to stand together. He was holding in detention a party of four envoys sent by the Turks to urge him to join ibn Rashid in a jihad against us, but after consultation with Captain Shakespear the Turkish mission was dismissed with the reply that ibn Rashid's forces were camped within two days of ibn Sa'ud and that there could now be no question of peace between them. On January 17th a messenger arrived from Mecca bearing a letter from the Sharif's son 'Abdullah who wrote that the Sharif had been called upon to proclaim the jihad and was temporizing till he heard what line ibn Sa'ud proposed to take. Ibn Sa'ud made answer that he saw no advantage to the Arabs in joining the Ottoman Government and had himself dismissed a Turkish deputation empty-handed. Upon the reports sent by Captain Shakespear from ibn Sa'ud's camp, Sir Percy Cox was authorised to proceed with the negotiations for the treaty, but on January 24th battle was joined between ibn Sa'ud and ibn Rashid and Captain Shakespear, unarmed and present only as a spectator, met his death. Ibn Sa'ud's version of the disaster was that he was shot dead by a Shammar rifle-bullet, but this statement is in any case based only on second-hand in formation, as it is undisputed that Captain Shakespear had taken up a position in a different part of the field than that where his host was located. Since then various and divergent accounts of what happened have been recited, one of little more value than another, but the balance of evidence goes to show that he was first wounded in the leg and disabled, and soon afterwards killed in the charge of ibn Hashid's cavalry which overwhelmed the flank on which he was posted. In the sauve qui peut which ensued it is feared that he was either abandoned or forgotten, but the precise circumstances of his untimely death will probably never be ascertained. Ibn Sa'ud expressed profound regret for the loss of one whom he regarded as a brother, and always refers to him with respect and affection. The action was indecisive: both parties claimed the victory and both were temporarily crippled and forced to retire. It was an unexpected and a somewhat disconcerting result, for ibn Sa'ud's preparations had been made on an exceptional scale and his forces were said largely to outnumber those of ibn Ilashid, though he was inferior in cavalry. The accounts given by the Arabs attribute his defeat to the treachery of the 'Ajman. Ibn Sa'ud's personal courage is beyond question, but he not uncommonly falls short as a tactician, and Mubarak of Kuwait pronounced him to be a poor leader in battle. But if he had not dealt ibn Rashid a crushing blow, he had at least put him out of action and prevented him from joining the Turks, as he unquestionably would have done. The intervention of ibn Rashid in the early part of the Mesopotamian campaign might have added considerably to our difficulties. Nevertheless Captain Shakespear's death was a heavy price to pay for the advantage of immobilizing him. The two chiefs held apart without further hostilities till the summer when an agreement dated June 10th was concluded between them. Ibn Rashid recognised ibn Sa'ud's claims, except that of overlordship which he could scarcely ., , , be expected to acknowledge, and undertook Ami. Bureau,heioMth c. close.. ^ p] a y a treacherous game towards the Turkish Government but to incline towards whichever Government was in alliance with ibn Sa'ud. He confined his own jurisdiction to Hail and its villages and the Shammar tribes, while ibn Sa'ud was acknowledged to hold all Najd from Al Khahaf to Dawasir. A1 Khahaf is no doubt the Kahafah of Hunter's map, a little north of latitude 27°. In a tribal country the adjustment of frontiers can never be very exact, but it is clear that ibn Rashid renounced all pretensions to the Qasim, a province whose rich oases had frequently changed hands. It is of interest to note that the tribes reckoned as subject to ibn Sa'ud are the Mutair, 'Ataibah, Harb, Bani 'Abdullah, 'Ajman, Murrah,5 Manasir, Bani naja, Subai, Salmi, Qalitan and Dawasir, but this catalogue must not be taken as exact, for the \lutair are mostly in Kuwait territory and the Ataibah and Jlarb come for tlie greater port under the Sharif. After Captain bhakespear's death ibn Sa'ud sent an immediate request that another oilicer should be accredited to him or, failing this, that negotia tions should continue through his agent in Basrah, 'Abdul Latif Mandil. No suitable oilicer was available, but ibn Sa'ud was advised to sign a pre liminary agreement on the lines of Captain Shakespcar's draft and leave all details to be settled later. He signed and returned the new draft which had been sent to him but with some important modifications concerning which it seemed better to postpone further discussion till a meeting with the Chief Political Officer could be arranged. For the time therefore the conclusion of the treaty was suspended, ibn Sa'ud being wholly engaged with internal ail airs His position at home at this epoch was the reverse of secure. His reputation among 1 he tribes had suffered Irom the unsuccessful operations against !bn llashid during which he had incurred much loss in material and equipments, and during the greater part of 1915 he was engaged with a dangerous rising in the Hasa on the part of the 'Ajman. He himself believed that the revolt was instigated by the Turks and Ibn' Rashid, but it is doubt ful whether his view was correct. Mubarak of Kuwait was convinced that there was no evidence to support it, but Mubarak, during the last few years of his reign, was not a lenient critic of ibn Sa'ud's difficulties. His opinion is so iar borne out that the troubles 'with the 'Ajman seem irab Bure.u, 25th July 1916. haV i e be ' U11 with Occupation of the Hasa by the Amir in 1913. Up to that time the tribe had been on good terms with him and had generally recognized him as suzerain, but the extension of his direct authority to the Hasa, which is their headquarters, had strained their allegiance. He attempted to impose a poll tax upon them and stopped them irom taking dues from caravans passing through the country, a toll which they had been accustomed to exact in tno days of the Turks. The discontent of the 'Ajman was fanned by members of ibn Sa'ud's family who had long been at enmity with him, the 'Araif, grandsons of his uncle Sa'ud. Two of the 'Araif cousins, Fahad ibn Sa'ud and Salman ibn Muhammad, had taken refuge with the Shaikh of Bahrain. The Shaikh made a half-hearted attempt to patch up a reconcilia tion in 1914, but the 'Araif refused his mediation and sought the protection of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, irom whom they received some countenance when hostilities were renewed with ibn Sa'ud in 1915. The rebellion now assumed serious proportions. Ibn Sa'ud sent for more troops from Kiyadh and asked help from Kuwait, but before the arrival of either reinforcement be attacked the 'Ajman by night near Hofuf and met with a reverse, due partlv to the cowardice of the Hofuf town levies. His brother Sa'ud was killed and lie himseli wounded. Por a time his fortunes were at a very low ebb. He Mas in want of money and arms, and for all practical purposes was besieged m Hofuf. Ibn Kashid, oblivious of the agreement recently signed, seized the oppoitunity to raid the Qasim, but his advance was easily stopped and the arrival of a force from Kuwait under the Shaikh's son, Salim, turned the balance in the Hasa. The 'Ajman were routed in September, harried on their retreat northwards by the Bani Khalid and forced to take refuse in ^ Kuwait territory, where they remained until Shaikh Mubarak's death in December. Fahad ibn Sa'ud was killed in the retreat : Salman made his peace with ibn Sa'ud at the end of the year. During the struggle we had facilitated the despatch of ammunition to ibn Sa'ud from BahraiiTand done what we could to restrain Abu Dhabi : in October we presented ibn Sa'ud with 1,000 rifles and gave him a loan of £20,000. The Turks had not yet abandoned all hope of winning him over, and in July previous to ibn Hasina's raid a Turkish emissary, Salih al Sharif al Hasni, communicated with him and proposed a meeting: but his request was refused, and on December 2oth ibn Sa'ud met Sir Percy Cox at Qatif and the long delayed treaty was completed and signed. Subject to certain safeguards it provided ibn Sa'ud with a dynastic guarantee in the dominions now in his possession and promised him the support of Great Britain in case of unprovokedaggression from foreign Powers. On his side ibn Sa'ud engaged to hold no correspondence with any foreign Power and to grant no concessions to foreigners, to keep open the roads to the Holy Places and to commit no aggressive act on other Shaikhs under our protection. Ibn Sa'ud was unaware of the exceedingly confidential correspondence which we had been carrying on with the Sharif during the winter of 1915-1910, but the results to which it led could not leave him indifferent. Relations between the Hijaz and Najd had been dictated by conflicting sentiments. The Sharif had even more reason than ibn Sa'ud to fear the Turks, but he was jealous of ibn Sa'ud's position as an Arab Chief, and the feeling was reciprocated in Kiyadh. The fluctuating allegiance of the tribes is a rich source of discord in Arabia, and the absence of any defined frontiers enhances the uncertainty of claims and obligations. In 1910 the Shaiif 'Abdullah, asserting that he acted on behalf of the Ottoman Government, marched to the borders of the Qasim for the purpose of re-asserting an authority which was probably a thing of the past and must at the best have been shadowy. The tangible results of the raid do not seem to have been more than a re-insistance on the Sharif's suzerainty over the distant sections of the 'Ataibah, a tribe which had once been under ibn Sa'ud but had largely seceded to the Sharif. 4. smull tribute to Mecca from the Qasim villages was stipulated for by 'Abdullah before his withdrawal, but it is unlikely that it was ever paid. Prom 1913 the Sharif showed strong anti-Turkish proclivities, and before the outbreak of war he and Ibn Sa'ud drew together. They were in dence when Captain Shakespear paid his first visit to Riyadh in of 1914. In January 1915, they were acting in concert, and ibn Captain Shakespear that in his view the Khalifate would revert to correspon- the spring Sa'ud told the family of the Prophet, of which the Sharif was the representative, if it dropped from the hand of the Sultan of Turkey. In November J915, 'Abdullah reappeared in Najd, with what object is not very clear. His own explanation was that he was sent on a mission to ibn Sa'ud, with the further purpose of collecting dues in the Qasim and Sudair. Except for a doubtful suzerainty over wandering sections of the 'Ataibah, the Sharif does not seem in Beduin estimation to have rights in either province, his limits eastwards being some where between Longitude 44° and Longitude 45° at Sha'arah, Duwadmi, Jabal Dhurai and Jabal al Nir. 'Abdullah is not reported to have advanced much beyond Sha'arah: he collected dues from the 'Ataibah, subdued the small allied section of the Buraih (by origin Mutair) and returned to the Hijaz : but ibn Sa'ud, barely emerged from a perilous contest in the Hasa, not unreason ably regarded tho expedition as inopportune and even suspicious. (These sentiments were reflected in his conversations with Sir Percy Cox in He rtninded the Chief Political Officer that the Wahabis no Khalif after the first four, and was careful to add that if the Sharif should assume the title it would make no difference to his status amonsr other December, recognized &amp; rose in open of the Arabs. rulincr o Chiefs.) rebellion Ibn Sa'ud, against writing Arab Bureau, 2nd August 1916. expressed his satisfaction In June of the following year the Sharif the Turks and declared the independence in July to the Chief Political Officer, acknowledged the receipt from him of official news with regard to the Hijaz, at the discomfiture of the Turks, but put forward his own apprehensions that, the Sharif might proceed to claim authority over parts of Najd, and in support of this fear observed that in declaring the inde pendence of ' the Arabs ' the Sharif appeared to treat them as a compendious whole, an attitude which he regarded with anxiety. In August he wrote again, saying that he had now received a letter from Arab 91b A,.gu.t 19:6. tj 16 Sharif in . , the latter announced the occupation of Mecca and asked him for his help. Ibn Sa'ud gave a summary of his reply, and a copy of the original Herewith enclosed. letter liaS sinCe been received. He * assured the Sharif that he would render all assistance which was in his power, but asked for a written undertaking that the Sharif would abstain from trespassing in his territory or interfering with his subjects. Ibn Sa'ud went on to ask Sir Percv Cox whether his £ *I relations with the Sharif might be regarded as a matter which affected the two chiefs alone, or whether they touched on our interests, in which case he w T ould be guided by our wishes. According to Arab reports received at Kuwait the Sharif wrote three times to ibn Sa'ud asking for aid, and on two occasions sent him £2,000. Not improbably there is some truth in the rumoured remittance of soiall sums.

TT • j -i , i • , j lie pointed out now important it was to the Arab cause, which it was the policy of the British Government to support, that all the great Arab chiefs should work together and in co-operation with us in the common task of expelling the Turks from Arabia As to ibn Sa'ud's own position he need have no misgivings lor he had been acknowledged by us to be an independent ruler and the Sharif must recognize the full import of the treaty. The British Government had no reason to believe that he enter tained any hostile intentions against the tribes and territories of Najd. In the negotiation ovei the treaty in December 1915, Sir Percy Cox had discussed with ibn Sa'ud the possibility of his giving us assistance against ibn Kashid. The Hakim of Najd then thought that ibn liashid would either come in or maintain a strict neutrality, if however he showed himself actively hostile, ibn Sa'ud would attack him and incite the northern 'Anazah against him. This • •1-1 intention however he failed to carry out. During the spring and summer of 1916 he was occupied with a rebellion of the Murrah, following on, and perhaps connected with, that of the 'Ajman, which endangered his communications with the Hasa. Though a large proportion of the fighting men of the Shammar had gone north with ibn Kashid against the 'Iraq, no effective attack w T as made on Hail in their absence. In late June or early July, ibn Sa'ud's son, Turki, raided Jabal Shammar, and the news may have hastened Ibn Rashid's retreat from our frontiers. In September or October Turki renewed hostilities against some of the Shammar Shaikhs and an allied section of the Harb, but the affair resulted only in the capture of a small amount of booty, and ibn Sa'ud's doctor, passing through Bahrain, brought a message to the effect that the Amir could do nothing against the Shammar as long as the fugitive 'Ajman remained cn his flank. The true reason for his inactivity was no doubt his own insecurity at home, but the implacable hostility which he entertained towards the 'Ajman, whom he regarded not only as rebels but as the murderers of his brother Sa s iid, threatened to become a problem, of some difficulty. - When Shaikh Mubarak died in December 1915, ibn Sa'ud pressed his son and succosyor in Kuwait, Jabir, to drive out the 'Ajman Shaikhs. Jabir made a temperate reply. He was unwilling to eject the 'Ajman, fearing that they would be thrown into the enemy camp ; but he could not hold out against ibn Sa'ud's insistance without creating an open breach and he expelled the tribe in February 1916. As he anticipated, they turned for protection first to Ajaimi and then to ibn Bash id, but in May they asked and obtained permission from jff V the Shaikh of Zubair to settle quietly near Safwan and subsequently several of the leading SJ'aikhs made submission to us. 'When ibn Bashid returned to Hail only two of the 'Ajman Shaikhs remained with Ajaimi and they had little or no following. Ibn Sa'ud's ardent desire to direct his energies upon the extermination of this tribe was not one with which we had any sympathy, at all events at the present juncture.8 Shaikh Jabir, new to his office, could not hope to exercise the influence over ibn Sa'ud which had been possessed by that practised and weighty diplomatist Ids father : moreover for some years before Mubarak's death relations between Riyadh and Kuwait had been growing cooler. Ibn Sa'ud bitterly resented Mubarak's attitude during the negotiations between himself and the Ottoman Government in the spring of 1914. According to his account the Shaikh had at lirst counselled him to accept the Turkish offers, but when he readied Kuwait in April Mubarak changed his note, without explanation, and advised ibu Sa'ud not to come to terms with the Tu ks, refusing, at the same time, to be present at his meeting with the delegates. So indignant was the Amir that he expressly stipulated with Captain Shakespear that Mubarak should not be con sulted in the negotiations with ourselves. The asylum given to the 'Ajman was . . . ., imfl another grievance, and in 1916 ibn Sa'ud Arab Bureau, oth Apnl 1910. , . 0 , « ,i . .i complained ot the incidence ot the transit dues which had been, from time immemorial, levied in Kuwait. While ibn Sa'ud's anxiety as to the ambitions of the Sharif, and his growing estrangement with Kuwait showed that the chiefs allied with ourselves had not reached a satisfactory understanding with each other, there was evidence that the Turks were still active in Arabia, News was received from ibn Sa'ud and from other sources of the despatch of an agent (Muhammad) Taufiq ibn Fara'un of Damascus, for the purpose of buying camels for the Ottoman Government; the emissary was well chosen, for he was a personal friend of ibn Sa'ud and had visited Najd on the same business the previous year. But on this occasion o . , the Amir was pressed by us to prevent Arab Bureau, 19th September 1916. . /. * , •, 1 mm Irom obtaining camels: ne accord ingly arrested ibn Fara'un, confiscated 700 camels which had been purchased in the interior and sent them* to Kuwait. Various reports, some of which .. . « came from ibn Sa'ud, indicated that Arab Bureau, herewith erxlosed. , , .. . . ., t-» i • i another attempt to stir up ibn iiashid against us was in the wind. Rushaid ibn Lailah, ibn Eashid's representative at Constantinople, joined him at Hail with a few German and Turkish officers, a small body of Turkish soldiers and some guns; accounts varied as to the exact composition of the mission, but its presence in Hail in some form seemed fairly certain. Ibn Sa'ud had written in September that he would be glad of a personal interview with the Chief Political Officer to discuss the question of co-operation with the Sharif or offensive action against ibn Rashid. In October he repeated the request urgently, and on all grounds it seemed advisable to accede to it. Sir Percy Cox met him at Ojair on November 11. Ibn Sa'ud explained to him his position in detail. He iiad lost considerably, in men and material, in the fight with ibn U ash id in January 1915. Since then he had been almost continuously in the field, first against the 'xVjman and then against the Murrah. Most of the normal trade of jSajd was with Syria, and the tribes were accustomed to sell their camels to Damascene dealers: the strict blockade imposed by ibn Sa'ud—the seizure of ibn Fara'un's camels bore witness to its reality—grew more and more galling : the Najdis grumbled, the tribes were restless, all asked wherein lay the alvantaee to themselves:, of their Chief's attitude, and it was increasingly difficult for him to keep them in hand. With regard to the Sharif, Sir Percy Cox was able to give ibn Sa'ud the fullest reassurance Our treaty with the Amir had been communicated to Mecca, and when the Sharif announced to us his intention of proclaiming himself king of the Arabs on November 5, we had insisted on a formal admission that he claimed no jurisdiction over independent rulers. The news of the coronation at Mecca, had not yet reached Central Arabia and was not discussed. During conversation with the Chief Political Officer at Basrah ibn Sa'ud made a passing remark about the Sharif's calling himself ' Sultan but his mind seemed to be set completely at rest on hearing that his rights were safeguarded by us and that the Sharif had explicitly denied any design on the independence of himself or his compeers. Ibn Sa'ud having expressed to the Chief Political Officer at their meeting at Ojair his inclination to pay a brief visit to Shaikh Jabir of Kuwait before returning home, the project was cordially encouraged as appearing eminentlyexpedient, and Sir Percy Cox recommended that he should be presented with the K.C.I.E. at a riiajlis which was to be held at Kuwait where the Shaikh was to be invested with the C.S.I. When he intimated to ibn Sa'ud that this honour was to be accorded to him, the Chief Political Officer was authorised to inform at the same time that his rights had been carefully reserved in all dealings which the British Government had held with the Sharif, and ibn . , n v . ,, Sa'ud in his reply said that he was Arab Bureau, herewith tor warded. . , i • /» -i i • • j entirely satisned on this point. The majlis took place on November 2Cth. The Shaikh of Muhammerah had come to Kuwait for the occasion and many Beduin were present, including the friendly headmen of the Shammar Aslam, and Dhafir, and Shaikhs of the Mutair. The Chief Political Officer, in presenting the decorations, alluded to our satisfaction in feeling that the great Arab chiefs were bent with us upon a common purpose. The Shaikh of Muhammerah followed him with words which were warmly pro-British, and ibn Sa'ud struck the key-note of the meeting in a speech which was as spontaneous as it was unexpected. He said that the Turks had placed themselves outside the pale of Islam by the iniquities which they had committed on other Moslems. He contrasted their policy with that of Great Britain, pointing out that the Turks had sought to weaken the Arabs by fomenting their differences, whereas the British Govern ment encouraged them to unite in their own interest. He praised the action of the Sharif and urged the obligation of all true Arabs to co-operate with him in forwarding the Arab cause. When he had brought his speech to an eloquent close, the three chiefs, Kuwait, Muhammerah and ibn Sa'ud, swore together that they would work with us for the achievement of a common end. This scene made a deep impression on the local notables and on the Beduin Shaikhs present who will no doubt carry the tale far and wide. 'During the receptions at Kuwait, ibn Sa'ud showed in all his utterances how clearly he had grasped the principle which guides our relations with Arabia. He quoted as an example of eur benevolent policy towards the Arab cause the fact that we were ready even to promote a reconciliation between himself and ibn Eashid if the latter would abandon his attitude of hostility. The arrival of ibn i'ara'un's 700 fine camels, each branded with the wasm of that well- known dealer, gave a dramatic completeness to the Kuwait gathering. From Kuwait ibn Sa'ud went to Muhammerah as the guest of Shaikh Khaz'al who co-operated most heartily in the endeavour to make ibn Sa'ud's visit profitable to him. The two chiefs arrived at Basrah on the evening of Ncvember 26. Early next morning the Chief Political Officer accompanied by two chief military representatives of the Army Commander present in Basrah went on board the Shaikh's launch and presented ibn Sa'ud with a sword of honour and a message of welcome from the Army Commander. The day was spent in exhibiting to him the Base Camps and organisation and the latest machinery of warfare including the aircraft in which he took an eager interest. Dhari ibn Twalah and Humud al Suwait, Shaikhs of the Shammar Aslam and the Dhafir, were present, while Shaikh Ibrahim of Zubair and several Sunni notables of Basrah and refuges from Baghdad had an audience with ibn Sa'ud on the launch. The Kuwait Durbar and ibn Sa'ud's visit to Basrah have placed us in a singularly strong position. Three powerful chiefs have made public protesta tion of their friendship with each other and their confidence in the British Government. A telegram received from the Sharif, congratulatim? them upon their zeal in the Arab cause and regretting that he had not had time to send a representative to Kuwait, confirmed the identity of his aims with their own, and in a further message he apologized for any deficiencies in his previous letters, on the ground that while he was in the throes of war he might un intentionally fall short as a correspondent. The dream of Arab unity which engaged the imagination of the Liberals of Damascus during the year before the war, has been brought nearer fulfilment than dreams are wont to come, but the r61e of presiding genius has been recast. Instead of the bril liant, unscrupulous Saiyid Talib, gyrating in the blast of his own ambition, the chiefs of Eastern and Western Arabia have united at the instance of the British Government.10 Besides this knitting together of Arab leaders, the meeting at Kuwait has produced certain immediate results. In the first place the extent and nature of ibn Sa'ud's share in future hostilities with ihn llashid, if such should occur, W3s agreed upon. He undertook to maintain 4*,000 men undci ninis if ibn Rashid moved in force towards the 'Iraq he would move up parallel with him towards Zubair and join the friendly tribes and a contingent from Kuwait. He informed the friendly Shaikhs that he would support them if ibn Rashid threatened to attack them in strength. If, however, ibn Eashid should remain at Hail, ibn Sa'ud would harass and attack him as opportunity offered, using the Qasim 3S a base. In view of the strain upon his resources during the last two years, he has been given 3.000 rifles with ammunition, as well as four machine guns, and granted a monthly subsidy of £5,000 to cover the expenses he will incur in maintaining his men in the field. Active co-operation with the Sharif was not considered practicable, but ibn Sa nd was ready to send one of his sons with some 40 men to Mecca as a sign of good-will, if the Sharif would make a special request for them. Secondly, a letter was written by ibn Sa'dun, in the name of the three chiefs, to 'Ajaimi ibn Sa'dun urging upon him the harm which he was doing 'to the Arab cause by his present attitude, Arab bureau, herewith enclosed. inviting him to enter into communication with them and promising him friendly consideration and an opportunity lor honourable submission. Finally, with the co-operation of Shaikh Jabir of Kuwait and the diplo matic skill of the Shaikh of Muhammerah who was throughout of the highest service to the Chief Political Officer the delicate problem raised by the presence of the 'Ajman among the friendly tribes reached a satislactory solu tion. For the period of the war a truce between ibn Sa'ud and the 'Ajman was agreed upon and instructions were drafted defining the position ot the fugitive Shaikhs with respect to all tribes Arab Bureau, herewith enclosed. under our protection. Onhis return to Basrah, Sir Percy Cox called in the 'Ajman leaders. They had been pro- foundly disquieted by the advent of ibn Sa'ud thinking that it augured ill for themselves, but the principal and more courageous headmen met the Chief Political Officer at Zubair and accepted the proposed terms, in return lor which they were promised a monthly allowance similar to that received by the other friendly Shaikhs of the Shamlyih ^hey evinced-little doubt that the remaining headmen of the 'Ajman, including the two who were still with , Ajaimi, would come in as soon as they heard of the happy issue of thcii own venture. Letters have been written to Fahad Beg ibn Hadhdhal informing him of the Kuwait meeting and inviting him to join the league of Arab chiefs m expelling the Turks. These have been sent through a man from Fahad Beg's tents who was in Basrah at tie time of ibn Sa'ud's visit and went to see him at Muhammerah, where he received advice and ^ instruction from Shaikh Khaz'al in full measure. He was entrusted also with letters from the Sharif which have been waiting opportunity of despatch to Fahad Beg, Hachim al Muhaid, 'Ali Sulaiman of the Hulaim and others, and with presents in money to guide Fahad Beg's decision and to encourage the amicable disposition of the 5 Shaikh of tlie Dahamshah, Jaza' ibn Mijlad. Communications of the same nature are on their way to 'Ativah al Qulal of Najaf and Muhammad 'Ah Kamunah of Karbala. Enclosure No. 2. Copy oj a translation of an Agreements dated the 26th JR a jab 1333 {10th June 1915). between Shaikh ALdnl Aziz bin Abdur Rahman al Faisal, Buler cf Najd, and Shaikh Sa'ud bin Abdul Aziz bin Bashid, Amir of Hail and Shammar tribe. (.Note by bin Sa'ud.—This is a verbatim copy of the paper executed between myself and bin llashid.) In the Name of God the most Merciful and Compassionate. This is the agreement between me Sa*ud bin Abdul Aziz bin Eashid and Abdul Aziz bin Sa'ud. That is to say.11 I, bin Rashid, hold jurisdiction over my territories, i e., Hail and its villages and over the Shammar tribe as they belong to me (bin Eashid) and the control of them rests with me. All the demands of bin Sa'ud from them (Shammar) in respect of losses, etc., and everything that they may owe to the subjects of bin Sa'ud I, bin Eashid, am answerable for it. That Najd and all the interior from A1 Kahaf to the valley of Duwasir and all territories of bin Sa'ud and the encampments of Mutair, 'Ataibah, Harb, Ban! 'Abdullah, 'Ajman, A1 Murrah, Al Manasir, Bani Hajar, Sabai, A1 Sahul, Qahtan and Al Duwasir and everybody included among them are subjects of bin Sa'ud. I, bin Eashid, have nothing to do with them. I, bin Rashid, will protect all Beduin of bin Saud and his subjects who may be in my terri- torry. The casting of lots of Shammar will be as usual. And similarly bin Sa'ud will protect my adherents and I, bin Eashid, will not interfere with bin Sa'ud at all. Nor shall I act treacherously with him vis-a-ois the Turkish Government. It is incumbent upon me to incline with him to whichever Government is allied with him, and I have no intention to oppose his views. And hereafter there shall be uninterrupted brotherhood and friendship between us. I hereby give you, bin Sa'ud, my -oord upon my honour and on the oath of God that there shall be no deception or treachery and I will not betray you or deceive you as regards what we have mentioned above. Upon this bond is the assurance and the oath of God and God is witness of what I say. SA'UD bin ABDUL AZIZ AL EASHID. (Seal.) Enclosure No. 3. Translation of letter from Abdul-Aziz ibn Ahd-er-Rahmun al-Faisal to Sir Percy Cox, dated 2lst September 1916. Alter compliments. After paying respects and enquiring about your precious health, I beg to say, in case you enquire about me, that I am quite well, thank God, and pre serve my regard and friendship for you. And my affairs, thanks to God, are prospering. Previous to this, I sent you several letters, but have not yet received replies, may the motive be favourable. And I beg to state that in these days, my son Turki has proceeded to wards Hayel to take his revenge of them. On his way, about one day's run from Hayel, he came across several parties of ibn Eashid's Arabs, who had come to him for refuge with him from the Shammar and Harb and Hatim and God helped Turki against them, and he pursued them getting from them much booty and killing a lot of their men ; I am consequently pleased to tell you this. I am awaiting the good news of your victories over the enemy, and the victories of the Great Government and her Allies. With regard to the news from the Hejaz and the fighting of the sons of the Sharif against the Turks, encounters and skirmishes have taken place between them, but I have not yet ascertained the true facts and, inshallah, I will certainly apprise you of them after ascertaining same. And I beg to inform you with effect to 'Ajman who are located at Safwan that you are aware of their relations with me and that nothing during that time prevented me from punishing them except the hot weather ; for if we wished to march against them via the coast of the sea, water would have been abundant in Kuwait sides, where they had certainly confederates and spies who would have warned them, and they would have cleared off before we could reach them, moreover the distance was great. On the other hand on the inland side our towns are barren and devoid of water. It is only now and later that we can operate when the weather is cool.12 ' They have in these days sent to me messengers with letters asking that I will amnesty them. But I know that they do n©t really aim at a truce nor will they make confidence in me, on account of their bad deeds in the past which are not hidden from you. They hope to deceive me and thus attain their purposes, and by wasting time make off to any other place they like. More- over they are ignorant, their knowledge and control being in the hands of Dhaidan and Khumsiyis, wdio is now with bin Rashid's men and with bin Saedun. The former is their overlord and they do not act without his orders, while the latter is influencing in any way he wishes. I have, however, granted them amnesty, provided they come to the direction of Jsajd, and provided their Shaikhs come to me. It is probable that they will accept that. My intention is to clear them off from this direc tion, for if they remain on this side, they may cause disturbance in one of the two following ways -Either they will be at the bidding of bin Rashid and bin Sa adun at any time they like, or else they will certainly aggress on my tribesmen, who will then be forced to pursue them. As I have meutioned above, it is known to you that operations on this side which are in your hands will harm some of the tribes. If therefore you think it better that they should clear off from the side of Zobier and Kuwait, I should find it, too much more convenient as I depend firstly on God and secondly on you, and am acting in pursuance of your orders to me, and secondly 1 ' because the harm caused by their remaining there will be great. Interested people or persons ignorant of the real facts may say to you : ' I am afraid that if they go they will side with bin Hashid or with bin Sa'adun, and then some hostile action on their part may ensue. As regards the possibility of their joining the said individuals they are looked upon as some of their very subjects, and it is only by the previous machinations of bin Hashid that they have become so, may God confourid them. Therefore I wished now to express to you my thoughts, and there is no doubt that you are more careful on my interests than I am myself. Also your policy must have been well acquainted with their affairs in relation to bin Rashid. I have, to say the truth, stated too much, for which I request you to be so kind as to forgive. May the Creator keep you safe and may He protect you. (Seal.) Dated 22nd ThiUKidah 1334—21st September 1916 % Note .—A solution of this question—the feud between ibn Sa'ud and the 'Ajman—was arrived at the personal meeting of bin Sa'ud with Shaikh of Kuwait and Chief Political Officer at Kuwait on November 21st, 1916.

After profound salams: This is to enquire about your august health. As regards ourselves, we are, thanks to God, quite well and happy. While expectant of good news of your success and prosperity, we received with the, hand of affection your letter, announcing your well being, and we13 were very glad to read it, and hoped for continuance of same. As regards your expressions of desire and wish for close relations, this is a proved and well known fact, more manifest than the sun at noon. May God perpetuate uninterruptedly this friendly attitude so long as days and years endure. As to your good news regarding the hostile operations conducted by your honoured son Turki against certain Arabs, and his victory over them, we thank God for this success. Inshallah, you will always be prosperous and victorious. Further we beg to offer complete salams to your noble father, your brothers, and all your sons. Here, our son Jasib and his brothers present their deep salutations. Please continue always sending your letters, informing me of your well- being, and also keep me informed or your requirements, which will be duly carried out. This is for favour of information. Salams. 21st Dhil-Rijjah 1334, 9th Octohev 1916, Postscript. We beg, merely for the sake of information, to write to you what occurs to our mind, namely that it is acknowledged and known that our three famines, i e., yours, al-Sabah's, and ours, are completely united, and are considered as one dynasty, the interests of which are all the same, for thus runs adage, ' \ush for your friend what you wish for yourself'. 'With reference to this Power, Great Britain, their regard for Your Excellency, and their kindness to all is not hidden. Their^motto being to appreciate the merits of their loyal friends. We cease not (and God is witness) to behold their friendship for you. All representatives of this Great Government are statisfipd with you, especially His Honour Sir Percy Cox, who always manifest to his satisfaction with Your Excellency. Therefore we request Your Excellency to grow more and more in your loyalty to this Government, for they appreciate their obligation to their loyal friends. Even the humblest merit does not pass unrecognised by them, and their justice is famous. Though to apprise you of such facts is a liberty on our part, we were merely by way of correspondence desirous of telling you (although ycu are well aware of the attitude of this Government and of the' inner intentions of their sincere representatives) that we desire that our three families should adopt one policy, and should consider the only interest of this Great and Just Kingdom. Abdul Aziz ar-Robai will certainly apprise you of the strength and organization which he has seen to exist in Basrah, which are increasing daily. Further JPostsci'ipf. As regards yo.ur previous letter, it duly reached us, and because it was in reply to our letter, that is why we were slow to answer soon. Your demand which you mentioned with effect to the 'Ajman was, by the Grace of God and according to what we heard, performed in the mode you wish, they did not dare to do anything on account of your brother. Shaikh Jabir's attitude. The union of our three families is, by God's will, becoming more com plete day by day. There exists, moreover, affection on the part of your brother, Shaikh Jabir, towards you, even more than that of his late father though the latter w r as accepted as the father of all. But, truly. Shaikh Jabir desires to confirm by any means his regard for you. Inshallah you will, by and by, behold what will increase your confidence in his regard and concord. You are doubtless certain in your mind that we are exerting/ 14 ourscWes rcry fully in cementing the fiiendly relations of our three families and descendants, for we feel it is our duty and obligation to do so and your man Abdul Aziz ar Eobai will certainly corroborate the regard and accord he has experienced from us. And we are pleased to learn from your brother, Shaikh Jabir, that you haTe a mind to proceed to the place of all, Kuwait. Please God this good news, which I was glad to receive, will take shape, so that, inshallah, we may meet you happy countenance. and in good health, and may be fortunate to see your AMIN. Enclosure No. 5. - Translation of a letter from Sharif IIus sain of Mecca to Abdul Aziz ihn Sand, 6th Zill Qoiada 1334, After compliments. Your Honour's letter of 13th Shawalhas reached me and the contents have been understood, and what you mentioned about the continuance of your good health has pleased me. But as regards your observations, they can only emanate from a man bereft of his reason or of an absent mind. But thank God we are capable of enduring more than this from persons of less amount than you, and this time it is one duty to bear it also from you. But O 1 Father of Turki, if you believe in God and in the Day of Judgment it is to be denied that you should not busy yourself with what there is no cause for. You see that I am convinced that we are co-partners except in regard to what God has forbidden. This is the right and the truth and there is no mystery behind it. If you realise this and rid yourself of doubt and suspicion (which are not right on the part of people like yourself) this is what is to be expected from the sagacity and perspicacity of persons such as you. Be it otherwise, I shaU realize that God has given you up, and there is no method in His will. But the request will demonstrate the truth. At any rate we are waiting to see how you have carried out what we communicated to you in our letter sent to you by Homaidhan, which dealt with the Asaiba and their news. This is what had to be explained and on (?) of the above it has been written. Seal of Sharif. P. S. —Your letter and its enclosure are sent by us enclosed herewith so that you may reflect in what you wrote to us in them. As regards what you desired us set forth in the enclosure, if God has dispersed your doubts there is in my opinion no need for it, while if your doubts are still being revived by the intentions of ibn Taraon and people like him, then there is no use in it, for the result in writing in that sense will be that I shall receive from you a letter asking for its cancellation, just as you have asked me now to cancel what you wrote to us in this sense, and which Nasir bin Farhun brought to us under your confirmation, and which is in our hands. And God is with us and with you in good fortune. Seal of Sharif of Mecca. Enclosure No. 6. -i Translation of letter from ihn Saud to the Sharif of Mecca, dated 13th Shawal 1334=15th August 1916. After presenting you with profound salams, and praying for thee that God may rest on you his blessings always, and after offering our obligatory regards I v SLI P€ &gt; i Er15 and resy.ects to you, we beg to state that, previous to this, a letter was des patched to your honour, in whicli we told you what was sufficient. Your Honour ( may God preserve you) knows that everything is based on its foundation, and the foundation of religion and of the world is Truth. And we (may you be pveserved) in the first place deal with you and correspond about matters of which some are not true ; but it is not, please God, with any intention that there should be any estrangement between us. But we see that whereas many of our enemies and interested people are with you and you believe what they tell you and become suspicious of us, yet we are convinced that the real facts will be proved, in contrast to the gossip of enemies and people in general, which cannot endure ; and we have dealt with you in a manner which should neither displease you nor cause prejudice to you, and we will follow you for better or for worse. After the departure from here of your men bin Homaidhan and bin Twaiq, the messengers whom we had sent with bin Faroan, our intention was that they should incite the 'Ainzah against bin Rashid, returned to us. It is known to you that on their arrival in Syria, the Turkish authori ties lavished gifts on them, particularly in camels, and gave them large presents. No doubt from information which has reached me, they have exaggerated matters and are pleased (with their experiences). But our servants have, undoubtedly, apprised us of deeds done by the Turks, at which every Moslem and Arab closes his eyes with disgust. It became established and known to me that their only aim is the annihilation of Islam and of Moslems and especially Arabs ; and it is therefore incumbent that we should resolve to be sincere to you and to co-operate with you in any case, so that, inshallah, we may attain our subject, and that God may con found our enemies. Thus we shall not be blamed and shall he concentrating our energies and shall not have cause for regret. Well, O, Sayid ! Now you are aware that even in the invocation we say ' O my God, forgive me and my parents '. In the past there existed a misunderstanding between us, which was increased last year by brother Abdullah and by his treating our brothers with contumely and his abuse of our religion and our chiefship. You know that the Hasul (may God bless him) said, ' In the event of a calamity happening, ransom ye yourself with your possessions without sacrificing your life, and if the calamity increases then pay the ransom with your life without sacrificing your religion Now, if you (may God make you prominent) are a man desirious of our services, and if you desire us to co-operate with you, and that our forces be united, sooner or later, and that we should be, like a building, cemented with each other, these we desire you to give us a promise and your word on the lines of the paper enclosed with this letter, so that Our mind may be at rest, and that we may exert ourselves, and in order that the feelings of our subjects may induce them to help us in anything we desire. By God, you should understand that we do not mean by these words any thing more than :— {i) That God may help you and us, that we may co-operate in the question of this religion, and (ii) That we are afraid of what we have seen of the actions of the pre sent Government towards Arabs and towards the mosques, which they have turned into quarters for troops. Their only object is the destruction of Islam and Moslems. Also when we saw their activities in these expeditions, we were exasperated at it. But if our object was to attain worldly ambitions or achieve our own interests, you are aware of how others are exerting themselves. All that we16 desire we can have, but God refuses that we should prefer our worldly interests to the zeal of Moslems and Arabs, and —• (iii / That we rest assured in regard to your attitude, as we already- mentioned, so that we may actually co-operate with you to our utmost power for the benefit of us all. Except on these terms, there can be no permanent understanding between us, especially regarding the question of interference with our tribes and subjects. So we request you to accept what we say and hear with it as advice and that you wall perform w 7 hat w T e ask in order that, inshallah, the purpose may be achieved and that co-operation may be afforded. This is what was necessary for your information. Please convey our salams to your noble sons. Here, our respected father, and our brothers and sons salute you. May you be preserved in safety. (Seal.)

Previous to this I sent you some letters dated 15th Shawal 1334 (15th August 1916), 10th, 13th and 22nd Dhill Qaadah 1331 (9th, 12th and 21st September 1916) in which I informed you in good time what was necessary to be communicated, but I regret to say that I have not received answers to them as yet and am indeed wondering at the non-arrival of replies, for your honour is aware that the continuance of correspondence during such days is a matter of the greatest importance. I therefore hope that the answers are on their way to me. You have already been informed that I have detained bin Faroun in custody and seized the camels he bought for the Turks. I have also made more strict the blockade against trade, and communications generally, with the Turks everywhere in my territory. In opposition to this action of mine, the Turkish Goverment sent to bin Eashid 25 (twenty-five) German and Turkish officers accompanied by guns (cannon), arms, and other necessaries and also about 300 soldiers and bin Eashid's agent in Constantinople, Eashid bin Laila, and two days after arriving in Hail, the aforesaid Eashid proceeded with two German officers and a Turkish officer towards Iraq. Up to date I have not got fnformation as to the movement of Bin Eashid and the soldiers mentioned above; but I am watching their movements and surely they w r ill attempt some advance. I would a 1 so state that I would like to have a conference with you for w T hich I have made up my mind to be in Hassa on the 10th of Muharram 1335 (7th November 1916). I request you to send an immediate answer as to whether I can have a chance of meeting you at the place you will fix and the time at which you can get leisure or else you will let me know your opinion. According to information I have received about the movement of the troops in Medina, they have given up the idea of marching to Holy Mecca and have fortified Medina with trenches. They have also taken steps to protect the railway and have also kept troops in Medina for defence, and the remaining soldiers whom they wanted to send to Mecca have returned to Syria. This is all I know and only wish the permanance of your friendship and the continuance of the news of your welfare. May God preserve you.17 Enclosure No. 8.

Asked why they take quinine to prevent fever, they say that is a different matter. Captain, Political Agent,Bahrain.Mo.74-0 To, The Ist ilay 1917.

A CONTRIBUTION TO THE HISTORY OF TRIBAL FIGHTS IN THE SHAMI- YAH DESERT. Compiled from Arab reports recorded by A. P. 0. Zobeir. Human nature being what it is and at bottom the same in the Arab as in the European, pugnacious, ambitious and covetous, sometimes loyal but mainly treacherous, occasionally enlightened but always restless, the tribal fights in the Shamiyah desert may be expected to exhibit the same to and fro change and interchange, of alliances as may be found in the history of the relations between the various nations which compose Europe. The redeeming feature of the picture is its comparative bloodl^ssntss. Normally an Arab fight means the taking of an enemy by a surprise raid and the casualties may be in some cases more, in other rather less than those of an American football match. As a rule no prisoners are taken. By that it is not meant that they are killed, ill-omened as the phrase is to us more barbarous Europeans. A man who surrenders gives up his rifle, his horse, and even his clothes except the bare minimum that will save a blush. He is then let go. At a time however the fight is waged without respite and without mercy, and considering the numbers engaged with sanguinary results. The history of these fights has its own intrinsic interest apart from any lesson it may convey as to the possibility of relating the tribes together under the influence of an external power. For those concerned the story has landmarks as great to Bedouins as are Has.ings and Waterloo to us. What to Ibn Rashid and Ibn Suwait are Hastings or Waterloo compared with the battle of the Reeds or the Battle of Neba ? We will bfegin from the time when Sad'un Pasha the Muntafik Chief had been driven back from north of the Euphrates and made the Shamiyah desert his own particular ' dira ' and sphere of influence. The great Muntafik family of Sa'dun—not native to Iraq by origin, for they boast themselves descended from the nobles of Mecca—had built itself a ring of wells and forts extending from Chabashiyah through Chabdah and Shagrah to Abu Ghar and Neba', a ring of defiance to any attempt of the alien Turk to reduce their proud souls to subjection. The great Sa'dun had once carried his arms to the very walls of Basrah itself. When the disciplined forces of the lurks at length drove this unruly element into the desert, Sa'dun Pasha set up his standard ^.here and virtually proclaimed himself king of the Shamiyah. But there was another enemy beside the Turk. These desert forts were both a defence against the inevitable raids of Arab enemies and a base for their o^n raids. The Beduin has 110 work and no play. His only work and his only play is the ' Chazzu ' or raid The fashion was set and sealed Dy that 820 r &amp; p i)2 arch raider, the prophet; and though a raid appears to us in the light of mere theft, to the Bedouin it is a legitimate ebullition of spirits, albeit it has rules more binding with them than the rules of International Law with us. To return to Sa'dun, if one man could be regarded as king of the desert more than another, it was Ibn Eashid the great Turkish Amir, His traditional enemy, Ibn Sa'ud, Emir of Najd, was at this time at the lowest ebb of his power. There was no one to contest Ibn Rashid's supremacy. When, therefore, Sa'dun Pasha set up his standard in the Shammy ah, Ibn Eashid said: 'this cannot be. There cannot be two standards in the desert.' Whether his or Sa'dun's actions were influenced by secret encour agement from the Turks, it is difficult to say. At any rate some sixteen years ago rumours came to the environs of Khamisiyah that Ibn E-ashid was prepar ing a great raid on Sa'dun. Sa'dun, therefore, collected his forces and made all ready to repel the attack. Besides Muntafik tribes he had with him the Dhafir, a Bedcuin tribe part of which comes orginally from Hijr, north of the Iledjaz who had long ago been driven out and had settled in the distiict between Kuwait, the Sham mar, and the Euphrates. This tribe in its day has been as strong as any in the Shamiyah. In the time of the pr-sent Shaikh's grandfather Sultan Ibn Suwait, or of his brother, Ja'lan, its easily dissolved elements were united by the personal influence of the Shaikh. Without such personal influence, the temptations to disunion are obvious from the position of the tribe, situated as it normally is between Shammar and Muntafik, and therefore requiring to have influence with both sides. On this occasion a number of the Dhafir were with Sa'dun. Many of them did not enter into the affair at all. The Muntafik and the Dhafir together were ready for all emergencies. But no raid came. Thinking they had been collected by a false alarm, the tribes to a great extent dispersed Sa'dan himself remaining encamped east of Khamisiyah by the reeds. This was Ibn Rashid's chance. And one day Sa'dun's followers observed a mys terious cloud of dust on the southern horizon. They sent out the usual scouts who returned to report the coming of a host of Shammar. It was too late for all Sa'dun's followers to flee. He himself escaped towards Sakhariyah. The Chammar easily defeated the rest and captured a great booty of horses and camels. This was the well-known battle of the Reeds, Al Bariayah. Ibn Rashid encamped for a time at Tell-al-Jibarah and then retired to his own country. Sa'dun Pasha, desirous of avenging his defeat, took advantage of a quarrel belween Mubarak Ibn Sabah, Shaikh of Kuwait, and Ibn Rashid to ally him self with Ibn Sabah. A famous merchant of Kuwait, one Yusuf al Ibrahim who had seceded from Mubarak after his act of fratricide (he had killed his two brothers Muhammad and Jara) went over to Ibn Rashid. Mubarak, angry at his defection, employed some of his wealth in the arming of Ibn Sa'ud and readily accepted the invitation of Sa'dun to join forces against the common enemy This time Ja'lan ibn Suw ait, Shaikh of the Dhafir, refused to join the confederacy. The three, Sa'dun, Ibn Sabah and Ibn Sa'ud joined forces in the Najd. But Ibn Rashid w as too strong for them and defeated the confederacy with ease in a battle known as ' Al Turafiyah ' from the place where it was fought, this took place the year after the Battle of the Reeds. From this time there appears to be a gap in important events. Though there were continual raids, there was no fight of any importance. Ultimately a quarrel arose between Ibn Sabah and Sa'dun. A section of the Dhafir, called As Sa 'id, consistently friendly to Sa'dun captured a number of Ibn Sabah's camels. Ibn Sabah asked Sa'dun to procure their return. He refused and his refusal led Ibn Sabah to call in aid from Ibn Sa'ud, Ibn Sa'ud was not strong. Tw o of his tribes, the Mutair and the Ajman, had left him. Hence it w as only a meagre force he sent to the help of Ibn Sabah. Such as they w ere, their forces 0 reached Arkhaimiyah where they were surprised by a mixed body of Dhafir, Zayyad, and Muntafik (including the Budur) under Sa'dun. The Zavyad are not a Muntafik tribe. They belong to a confederacy knowm as the Beni Muchaim and dwell south and about Samawah. But their friendship with the Dhafir dates back to many years ago and bodies of them continuallyappear in Sliamiyah fights There was no real battle on this occasion. Tiro forces of Ibn Sabah and lbn Sa'ud were captured without a struggle hence this event Is known as the ' Hadiyah' or the Gift.' That such events are pos&gt;ible is only intelligible to those who know the distance and peace that can be accomplished by Arabs intent on a raid. The f fladiyah ' took place in the spring nine years ago.^ The following summer Sa'dun went to Baghdad on a visit to the Wali Kadhim Tasha. The Mutair, a Najdi tribe, normally of the following of Ibn Sa'ud heard of this, and judged it a good opportunity for a raid. They came to Ibn Sabah and sf id ' Now that Sa'dun has gone to Baghdad, there is great chance of booty from the Dhafir and the Mantafik. Let us make a raid upon them. ' ^ Not loath to attempt revenge upon the Dhafir for his late disaster, Ibn Sabah and the Mutair made a considerable raid on the Dhafir at Shagrah and succeed ed in capturing much booty. News of the raid came to Sa'dun at Baghdad and was reported to the Wali. The Wali offered to establish Sa'dun in the position of Emir of the ' Iraq tribes and Kuwait if he would overthrow Ibn Sabah. Sa'dun always ambitious, agreed to the project, and set cut to collect his forces. Among others he took with him the Dhafir. His forces arrived as far as the Ashgag, between Safwan and Jahrah to the west. Ibn Sabah hearing of their approach, and always in touch with the Dhafir, to the extent even of allowing them to take 4 Khawa ' on goods going from Kuwait or paying them a certain sum to forego their ancient practice, got into secret touch with the leasers of this tribe. The mare of a Sa'dun noble, Yusuf-al- Mansur, was killed by them and made a ground of quarrel, with the result that the Dhafir quietly deserted Sa'dun and frustrated the enterprise. Sa'dun gave up his quest, but though still nominally friendly with the Dhafir deter mined to take revenge for their treachery. He wrote secretly to Ibn Eashid inviting him to co-operate in the punishment of the Dhafir. Were he to a^ree to this, he was to appear with a following at the Dahanah, the sandy desert in the middle of Shammar territory. Meanwhile, Sa'dim himself would take his following including the Dhafir to the Dahanah. Ibn Hashid fell in with the plan, and the parties met at the Dahanah. Ibn Eashid called the head men of the Dhafir to him and asked tfiem for an explanation of their conduct. There seems to have been no excuse for them, and Ibn llashid fined them 500 camels. The Dhafir were fairly trapped and had to submit to this imposition. But Sa'dun knew them too well to let Ibn Ilashid depart without taking further safeguards against the future conduct of the tribe. Hence it was arranged that five of the Dhafir chiefs should go as hostages with Ibn Eashid. So the parties dispersed. But the Emir's chiefs, whether of their own free will or under the secret persuation of the captive Dhafir, came to the Emir and represented the harshness of his judgment. Had not the Dhafir already paid their fine of 500 camels ? Was it just fui'ther to take captive five of their chiefs? The Emir was convinced by their arguments and released the hostages two days after he took them. As might be expected, the liberated chiefs hastened to their tribe, intent on revenge, collected their 4 Khail' and ' Jaish,' and overtook and routed Sa'dun and his following south of Shagrah at Al Jaraibyat. Sa'dun retired to Khamisiyah while the Dhafir settled in the environs of Zubair at Safwan and Shwebdah. One section of the Dhafir, the Sanid, ^ere at the time with the Shammar, but now came to join Sa'dun at Khamisiyah. Sa'dun and his following with the additions of the Saiid moved to ' Alowi. This was within easy distance of the Dhafir, who straightway collected their forces, drove Sa'dun out, and returned to their tents. The Turks had chosen this timo to send agents to Basrah and to approach Sa'dun on the question of making him Emir of the dirat al Muntafik on the Shatt al Hai, Mubarak Ibn Sabah was then at Muhammerah and had got into touch with Saiyid Talib. It is said that he offered Saiyid Talib 3,000 liras to persuade the Government to seize and imprison Sa'dun Saiyid Talib agreed and represented to the Turkish agents how fatal a policy it would be to make a turbulent spirit like Sa'dun head of a combine of tribes notorious for its unruliness. '* Let me only bring Sa'dun to Basrah ' he said ' and the rest is easy.'What follows is famous in Arab history. The Turkish agents complied with the infamous proposal of Saiyid Talib. Sa'dun was invited to his house, the well-known bait al Naqib, accepted the invitation without suspicion, and duly appeared. By arrangement of Sa yid Talib, Sa'dun was to sleep secure lor the night, and was next morning to be invited to a repast while Saiyid Talib was to excuse himself on the plea that he had business in the haram. When Sa'dun had eaten, tlie Turkish agents sent men in the guise of emissaries of the VVali to invite him to appear before the Wall at the Sarai. The plan was successfully carried out. Sa'dun left bait al Naqib with the supposed emissa ries of the ali. When, however, they reached the Sar&lt; i, they were told that the T\ ali had gone to Ashar. Sa'dun still unsuspecting ? was taken to Ashar in a bellam and from there straight to a Turkish gunboat where he was informed he was a prisoner. The boat left quietly in the night, and on his arrival at Baghdad Sa'dun was taken to Aleppo wiiere he remained a prisoner and ulti mately died. From the time of Saiyid Talib's signal act of duplicity, the great Muntafik chief passes out of history, and his place is taken by his second 'son, 'Ajaimi. 'A jaimi was at this time besieged by the Budur in a fort north-west of IVi asiriyah, at Maiyah. The Turkish agents secured his release and let him go. Kc fled to the Ghazzi. But the Shaikh of the Ghazzi, Ibn-Hubiyib, was not prepared to take the onus of protecting this restless spirit on his shoulders, and 'Ajaimi was compelled to seek protection elsewhere. Isolated but not despairing, he mounted his dhalul, rode almost alone to Hail, and knelt his camel before the great Emir. I claim your protection, O Emir,' he said, ' and your help to avenge me on my enemies. Ihis you owe me as a right. For it was while under your protection my father, Sa'dun, was set upon and defeated by the Dhafir.' At Hail he stayed for sometime until at length Ibn Eashid consented to help him attack the Dhafir. 'Ajaimi went to call in help of Juwarin. Ibn Eashid on the first occasion he met the enemy fled and brought in the help of Dhari Ibn Tawalah and the Aslam. Ibn Eashid return ed to the fight and attacked and defeated a combined body of Dhafir and Budur between Shagrali and Abu Ghar. 'Ajaimi arrived one day late. Ibn Eashid returned to Hail and left the Mutair, whom he had also called to his help as a protection to 'Ajaimi. This was in the spring of 19 . Next winter the Dhafir and the Budur returned from their summer quarters north and west of Nasiriyah. 'Ajaimi was still able to call in the Mutair, but fearing he was not strong enough to renel attacks, he appealed to the Muntafik sympathies of sections of the Bani Malik and drew a body of them to his side. The opposing forces met somewhere between Shagrah and Arkliaimiyah. But before they met, the Budur had entered into secret negotiations with the Bani Malik, for the Budur too are a Muntafik tribe. The Bani Malik either fled or offered only a weak resistance, with the result that 'Ajaimi and the Mutair were routed, and their effects and aniinals were captured. 'A jaimi fled with his scattered forces to Safwan, where he remained until the summer. He then removed to Ghabashiyah,' where he perpetrated a ruthless act of robbery upon an unoffending relation. His father's cousin, Mazyad came to settle with him and deposited in a build ing known as ' Mazyad's treasury ' the sum of 60,000 liras, 'Ajaimi appro priated the whole vast sum and moved to the Shatt-al-Hai. Another winter arrived and the Dhafir as usual began to move south east towards their well-known settling places, Diraisiyah, Dafinsh, Abu Ghar and Sulaibiyah. Mazyad who had -been looking about him for opportunities of revenge went to the Dhafir and appealed to them for help. Meanwhile, 'Ajaimi too crossed the Euphrates with the idea of revenging himself for his late defeat. Always generous with his money, whatever its source, with the sum he was able with the sum robbed from Mazyad to attract a band of 400 mercenaries from various directions. His force consisted of some Mutair, some Shammar, some Bani Malik and other miscellaneous mercenaries. With these he invaded the Dhafir district and brought up against the Dhafir and the Budur at Naba. Then ensued one of the bloodiest fights in the history of tribal warfare in the Shamiyah desert. The Dhafir and Budur infficted a severe defeat on Ajaimi and his following.and are said to have killed nearly 300 of them, their own losses being 40~ killed. The following day Mazyad, overjoyed at the result, mounted his horse and galloped and curvetted before the victorious Arabs; This incongruous act met with disfavour in the eyes of Nemesis, and the unfortunate old man—he was then 80 fell and broke his neck 'Ajaimi was now at the end of his resources and was reduced to making peace with his enemies. Hence he invited Humud ibn Suwait, Chief of the Dhafir, to join up with him near Chabdah. Humud consented and settled alongside of him with some fifty tents. The rest of the Dhafir repudiated his overtures. Whether 'Ajaimi originally meditated treachery or was driven to what he did by the unfriendliness of the rest of the Dhafir, it is difficult to say. At any rate he quietly sent w^ord to the Mutair, acquainting them with this splen did opportunity of revenge. The Mutair arrived, all out for a raid. Humud ibn Suwait protested to 'Ajaimi against this gross act of treachery, and 'Ajaimi repenting attempted to dissuade the Mutair, but the Mutair were inexorable. They had come for a raid or a fight at 'Aj .imi's express invitation and were determined to carry it out 'Ajaimi had to submit to his own arrangement, and reverted to his original intention in calling up the Mutair—' Qalab ala ibn Smvait,' as the Arabs say, that it turned round against him. ^ Humud and his 60 tents fell an easy prey to the Mutair, and this affair is since know r n as the Qalbah. A speedy revenge overtook 'Ajaimi. News of the event soon reached the Budur, ancient friends of the Dhafir and their refuge in time of trouble. And two months after the Qalbah the Dhafir and the JBudur defeated 'Ajaimi at Shagrah. As the fiercest of Arab fights cannot permanently weaken a tribe, in asmuch as prisoners are normally released and live to fiofht 'again another day, there was no hope that 'Ajaimi was put out of court for good and all. So little depressed was he by his late defeat that not more than two months later he engineered a raid by Ibn Eashid on the 'Arail Section of the Dhafir at Tugayyid, while he himself and the Mutair defeated the Suwait Section at A1 Qasair. Meanwhile, greater events than any tribal dissension were looming, over Arabia, Turkey had declared war on Great Britain, and the Turks who were joined by 'Ajaimi with 250 sowars were gradually driven from Fao and Basrah. But other events, not of such significance to the world at large, though the greater purport to the Jazirat al Arab, began to make their appearance events which introduce us to elements and dissensions not within the scope of this account, which concerns chiefly the Shamiyah desert. But it will be useful to describe one great struggle so as to explain certain elements which can never be altogether out of relation with the Shamiyah. This is a famous fight between Ibn Sa'ud and Ibn Rashid. The events which led up to it are somewhat as follows :—Ibn Sa'ud delivered an ultimatum to the Mutair, w^ho are really one of his own tribes, though they had of late joined Ibn Rashid or 'Ajaimi indifferently when ihey offered occasions for plunder. He demand ed their return to his suzerainty on pain of permanent hostility. The Mutair were willing to return to their old allegiance, and celebrated their decision by pilfering a caravan o f&gt; thousand camels which was on its way from Zubair to the followers of Ibn Tawalah, Chief of the Aslam Section of the Shammar. They were then ready to return to their own country and join forces with Ibn Sa'ud. At the beginning of their war with Great Britain, the Turks had tried to persuade Ibn Eashid to attack Ibn Sa'ud in force- Ibn Eashid nothing loath, collected his forces ; meanwhile the Turks changed their minds. It occurred to them that if they could persuade Ibn Eashid to keep them in the ' Iraq and Ibn Saud to attack Kuwait, they would at the same time completely overawe the Arabs of the Iraq and overthrow a great stronghold of British influ ence. It was accordingly decided to call upon the notorious Saiyid Talib to proceed on a mission to Bin Saud to induce him to co-operate. At that moment Saiyid Talib was occupied in offering us his services on extravagant terms and while he was still hesitating to abate his demands, the sudden declaration of war precepitated matters and placed him in a dangerous situation from which the-mission to Bin 8a'ud offered him a providential means of escape. On reaching Ibn Sa'ud he placed himself in communication with the British authorities and was allowed at his own suggestion to proceed to India via Kuweit. Meanwhile, when the possibility of Turkey's entry into the war had become likely His Majesty's Grovernment had decided to send an emissary to, Ibn Sa'ud in our own interests in the person of Captain A&gt;. II I. Shakespear, formerly Political Agent at Kuweit, who was then in England. By the time lie had reached the Persian Gulf, war had already been declared, but it was none the less desired to maintain touch with Ibn Sa'ud and if possible to get him to move up towards' Iraq in our interests. Captain Shakespear accord ingly proceeded from Kuweit on this mission and found Ibn Sa'ud with a large force moving towards the Shammar country to attack Ibn Hashid, and very confident of success. His force included contingent of the Ajman tribe, a redoubtable though at the same time disreputable tribe from the A1 Hassa district who had long been estranged from their overlord but were still under his suzerainty and obeyed the order for a general union of forces. The Mutair too were on their way to join and in the circumstances, it w r as believed in the desert that Ibn Sa'ud was bound to defeat his traditional enemy for, in addition to the large numbers of his fighting men, he had with him three or four Turkish mountain guns with trained gunners. But there is one factor in any Arab fight which is outside prophecy and that is treachery. It is believed that there could have been no doubt as to the result, had it not been (according to the tales of the Bedouin) for the treachery of the Ajman. They are said to have turned upon their own side at a critical stage of the conflict, killed large numbers, confused the rest, and made off with a large booty of camels. Adherents of either side naturally give very different versions of what occurred, but there is no doubt that while both parties suffered severely from the shock of the encounter and from the depradations of the Ajman and other marauders after it, Ibn Sa'ud was the hardest hit and was for the time crippltd. It w T as in the course of this action that Captain Shakespear, who insisted on being present as an interested spectator, though pressed by his friend and host to remain at a distance, met his lamented and untimely end. No two accounts give the some version of the precise circumstances of his death, and until the clouds of war have passed over and reliable sources from both sides can be reached under conditions of peace, it is hardly possible that they can be ascertained with certainty. But to return to the fight. The Mutair were some distance away when the fight began. When they diew near and heard the sound of shots, they worked round the fight for south and finally came up right behind the Sham- mar to where they had left their camels. These they seized and made of with and secured large booty. They then returned to their own country and to the defeated Ibn Sa'ud said : 'Why did you fly ? See, we have captured the very dhulul of Ibn Rashid himself.' As indeed they had. But nothing could compensate for the reversal of fortune created by the treachery of the Ajman,, And to this day Ibn Sa'ud cherishes the hope of wiping them out to a man. Only their repute as fighting men—and it is often said there are no Arabs their equals— has preserved them from extinction. For they have many enemies and no friends. Arabs themselves say that of Bedouin the stoutest fighters are the Ajman, and of the Muntafik the Budur. The Shammar too are redoubtable, as are the Zayyad, who occasionally appear to the help of the Dhafir. Less reputable fighters, though famous raiders, are the Mutair and the Dhafir. There is no tribe to touch the Dhafir for what seems to us mere thieving, though it is dignified by the Prophet under the name of a raid. It will be noticed in this brief history of tribal dissensions that the Budur continually saved the Dhafir from disaster. And indeed the Dhafir owe everything to the Budur. Certain tribes like the Azairij are distinguished nghters on their own ground but helpless for a field. It is not so with the Budur. At home or abroad they display the same consistency of valour, and they have a quality almost peculiar to them the quality of always rallying to the standard of their head chief in the face of a common enemy, notwithstand ing their internal quarrelsomeness and a certain reputation for ruffianism. Itis different with an another similar tribe, the Juwarin, who certainly at the- present time find no chief round whom they will readily rally at need. So with the Zayyad, who belong to a western confederation known as the Bani Huchaim. Brave enough as fighters, they are split up into so many ill-united sections that one cannot concieve them rallying to one standard. Most of the Shamiyah tribes have taken part on one or other of the many raids and fights recorded in this history, Dhafir, Budur, Juwarin, Ghazzi, Zayyad. BuAhe protagonists are the Dhafir and the Budur. It is a curious alliance, Bedouin and camel with Muntafik and donkey tribe, originating in a blood feud against a common enemy ' Ajaimi. Unlil the latter is eliminated from Shamiyah by inducement or force, be will remain, though of no military importance, a chronic source of intrigue and centre of unrest and as such a nuisance to us and a valuable asset to the Turks. So much so that Ibn Bashid is said to resent 'Ajaimis competition for their favours and st this moment their relatiors are definitely strained. It may be too that it was because they realised the incompatibility of these two ele ments that the Turks after inviting Ibn Eashid to sit on our flank in the Shamiyah desert finally asked him to return to Hail and await a more favour able opportunity for a second visit to the 'Iraq. For ^jaimi had gradually won the powerful Zayyad tribe to his side, and the Zayyad cannot tolerate the Shammar at any price. It says much for 'Ajaimi's ascendency that though Ibn Rashid has departed, the elements he has left behind with us are in closer touch with 'Ajaimi then they are with their ancient overlord. Even Dhari ibn Tuwalah, who should know 'Ajaimi seeing that he was with him only a year ago, reluctantly pays a tribute to 'Ajaimi's personality. 'Ajaimi is a f nafar/ as the Arabs say of him, an individual, a man who counts. The 6th December 1916. 0 J G. P. J,, Delia—No. 820 F. &amp; 1' L) -27- 2-17—30.SECRKT. POLITICAL AGENCY.
