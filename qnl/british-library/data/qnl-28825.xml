A more serious proposition as far as British trade is concerned are the Hussion activities in connection with the piece-goods trade. For many years predominant in the Persian market,British piece-goods have of late years been meeting with more and more serious competition,notably from Italy. Since tho transport company n Irtrans H came into operation very large quantities of Italian goods have made their way into the market,and owing to the cheaper cost of transport via the Caucasian route,the British goods have found themselves at a great disadvantage,and have lost ground accordingly. H'U) Russians tiiemselvos have recently managed to produoe a very limited quantity of cotton prints, but in their determination to upset British trade at all coots,they have actually been importing British goods via JUssia, and underselling the Persian market with them. They have boon particularly active in this respect in the lieshed urea,whore,profiting by the existence of the Quetta-Lbsdab railway, Indian traders had ouocoodod in establishing a growing business, and had begun to import considerable quantities of piece-goods and other merchandise from India, fhe Russians felt their own commercial position weakening,and promtly threw quantities of goods on to tho market. The Indians found themselves being undersold by goods identical with &amp;ose that they themselves were importing.

Kor ie there any indication on the surface that a collapse is even re-aotaly probable. On the contrary,many people who have been to HuBoia recently have come baek with a strong impression that the Soviet Government is stronger than it ever was be fore,auu that it is,if anything,the most stable govornnont in the world. Strangely enough,neither those who prodiet the speed* downfall of tho Soviets,wor those whs Insist on their stability,appear to attaah due impor- tn-.ce to one vital factor,-tho real skeleton in Ihs Soviet cupboard-nanely the vory voxad qu®etion of tho Augaiaa Pea-jaatr:;, It has slTrays boon a generally accepted axiom that a -overumont, •.hetevor its nature,cannot endure for long if it is um ble to food its peoplo. In the case of Russia one might modify this slightly and say that no govern ment an Russia can possibly last if it Conner appease its peasantry. Wa will not say ’feed’ in the literal sense,for tits Russian peasantry is perhaps the one element in Russia that is capable of feeding itself.But oven Russian pea sants do not live or. bread aleme.and it is Just in the failure of the Central Government to provide the peasantry with the other articles of necessity that is the basis of the whole trouble. r fhs picture can be quite simply put together. Russia is essentially an agricultural country,and its population is overwhelmingly rural.! true in- uustrial proletariat never existed in Russia,and does cot exist there today. Ihe present government calls itself a 'Workers and Peasants Government',but it is based on a porkers' dictatorship,noi a Workers and Peasants hiotatorship .2 -ot even in naae f therefore,let alone in practice,do the peasante figure as factors in the dictatorship* The slogan is 'workers of the ^orld Unite 14 ,but there is no mention of an/ peasants* Since Russia is ruled by a dictator ship, and the peasants do not figure among the dictators,they must bo among those who are dictated to•There fore they cannot be considered as a part of or on a par with the workers*Henoe in/ the ouch vaunted symbol of the hammer and the sickle is as compatible me it is meaningless* Mow since the peasantry,who fora the great majority of the Russian population, are among the ruled, it ie obvious that they must bo either well dis posed towards thoir rulers or hostile to thenuThey may possibly regard them selves as neutral and hold themselves aloof,but if the overwhelming majority of the population hold themselves aloof or neutral,where then ie the dictator ship? Unthuslastio supporters of the Soviets would tell ue that the peasantry are ardently in sympathy with the present dictatorship.iiiis,however, is contradiotod by the frequent declarations of the Soviet leaders themselves that the question of the day is how to pacify the peasantry* Out of their own mouths,therefore,do the Soviet Dictators admit,not only that the peasantry are dissatisfied,but that they must be pacified* In other words there ie a breach- one might safely call it a gulf-betweon the diotatore and the peasantry, be twee: the town and the ountry* his bveaeh has existed since the beginning of the Soviet regime* It would not bo apparent in the throes of the actual revolution,nor in the turmoil ofiithe civil war that followed it,but it became evident the moment or der began to emerge from chaos,and while it would have existed naturally in any case,the Bolshevik policy s|mply emphasised it and made it stronger*3 Lot us consider the respective interests of the two elements and see how they diverge. Take the ease of the lUot&amp;tors, They based their power from the first on the proletariat.The latter is a misnomer as far as Russia is oonoemed t but it did comprise the industrial workers y and the lower classes of the towns 9 and included the scum of the slums and the prisons.lt had nothing in common with the peasantry. As for the leaders t townspeople all of them 9 Jews most of thea» -not one of them with any real ties with the peasantry;not one of them whose name would inspire confidence or sympathy among the oountry-people.The Dictators wore Communl3i8 9 -a creed entirely inacceptable to a rural population. Their attitude towards the peasantry was from the beginning one of intolerance and repression. Ono can leave out the ported of the civil war 9 for the behaviour of neither hites nor Reds was conducive to muon sympathy on the part of the peasantry. After the civil war,however,when the Cornualst Covornawnt settled doun toi rule,it iunediately fell foul of the rural population, ^he latter were called upon to produ ce.and to play their i&gt;art in the communist stats by supply ing grain and stock for the good of the ooumninity. hen they failed to produce with the enthusiasm due from one party in a communist community to another,the Dictators sent out Coimslssare to enquire the reason. The commissars met with little sympathy and employed force.drain and supplies were confiscated,and from that moment there was war to the knife between the peasants and the Soviets. Peasant risings occurred,but were easily suppressed.This did not improve the temper of the country people^ibey returned to their villages with hatred in their hearts. The Dictators might take by force what they had,but they eould not take what was not there .Thereafter the peasants began to produce only just . so much grain as was necessary for their own needs,and left the rest of their newly acquired land fallow. For once the Government were thwarted .Commie cars who were sent to the villages were murdered or otherwise mishandled .The CentralLfeseov began to understand that force vas no good,and attempted oonoifclatory measures.But how could they possibly conciliate the peasantry,what could they offer the®? 'Itoe pennants held the land;they were independent. Ihen came mat erial changes in the Rod Army.It become impossible to feed the troope.The Army was remodelled on something approaching a territorial basie,and troops were disbanded and returned to their own Tillagee* For a time there was no further interference from the towne.Thc country- people began to take heart,and the Soviets went so far as to encourage them.by providing them with motor traotors,and instructing them in the use of mechan ical cultivators. The peasant took to this with unexpected keenness.Larger areas come under cultivation,and the villagers began to acquire wealth. Jhe Soviets wore pleased,but were pussled how to get the grain. They dared not use force,for that would have merely resulted in stalemate.They ultimately found a solution.They would buy the grain from the peasantry• his would be a simple matter,for while the New Economic Policy permitted private trade with in the country,it did not permit individuals to indulge in foreign trade.That remained solely vested in the hands of the Soviet Governaent. Grain for ex port could therefore only be bought up by the Government,and since the peasant had no other way of disposing of it,the Government woe able to fix its own p price,and the producer was compelled to sell at that price. The price was a very low one-an unfairly low one,-but the peasant was powerless to do any thing, and had to sell. Tho fact that he was being cheated of what he consider ed his due rankled,and his feelings for the town were still more embittered. Meanwhile,at this point,it is neoossary to envisage the whole pic ture of Soviet trade. The N.S.P. vac much talked about,but beyond the fact that it was a definite departure from pure cojxnunist principles ana policy, there was no tiling important about it. It merely permitted private trade in5 (3 the interior, and hud no baaring irhatover on tha general situation,beyond playing into the hando of Jewish and other petty speculators who,ns often as not,got shot pour enoouragar los antrae. But tohat did i&amp;ntter was the whole syetesi of State trading,and in particular the fact that all trade with foreign countries was exclusively in the hands of the official Soviet departaenta• These did not make a great success of things,mainly because they were inefficiently staffed,and their operations hsndicappsd bybthe presence of controlling ooaaiissars,biit also because foreign traders did not trust tfisa,and declined to deal with thou. Changes were accessary,and in due course the system was modified* Traders in London and Berlin hesitated to deal with the Vneshtorg,with all ite sinister connections,but they felt acre *t their ease in discussing business with atcos, a £&gt;erfeotly good British limited liability company with a credit balance in a London bank. Arcos was the forerunner of many other trading drgmUat ions .The inefficient staffs were gradually eliminat ed, and capable business people,maiJily Jews,took their place. Similar in stitutions wore established in Berlin, Constantinople and in Persia* These various quasi-official trading companies had vested in them the sole export mid import taade of Soviet Russia. Their methods var ied somewhat in the different countries,but the principles underlying their activities remained tne same. They exported Rueaian produce,such as Coal, Oil,Cement and Sugar etc.,and disposed of it on the foreign markets rapidly for whatever it would fetch.They could thus undersell the produce of for eign competitors,but entailed a very heavy loss to themselves in the prooegnith tfc* money realised xhey pure liased such artiolee of foreign manufacture as the population required,imported them into Russia,and disposed of them to the Russian consumers at prices sufficiently high to oovor the loss on the exports and leave a little profit in hand* Zh other words,the Soviet authori ties have been throwing away their own staple produce,which forme part of the basic wealth of the country,and have been making good the deficit by buying foreign produce and making the wretched consumer,who is mainly the peasantry, pay exorbitantly for it, h more wasteful and ruinous policy cannot be imagin ed, for analysed it means that both ths country and its population are being exploited by the Soviet trade departments,who are the Soviet Government,and who alone are making capital out of the process, Ihe country is being impoverished,and the population is being fleeced. The Soviet Departments are able to ruin the foreign markets,and cover them- selves at &gt;ho expense of their wretched conoicaors.Small wonder that the Soviet Government are unwilling at any price to relinquish their hold on Russian foreign trade. The moment they do so,their main sources of revenue themselves/ are cut off,and they/are finished. The question is how long can this present policy continue?Ths an swer is Just so long as the Russian consumer will continue to pay the exor bitant prio«s demanded of him. Since the Russian consumer is,practically opeaking,ihe Russian peasantry, cannot the Peasantry find seme way of retal iating, and turn the tables on their exploiters. The answer is in the affir mative* They have already done it, V/e have already seen how,once they were left alone,the peasants went ahead with their cultivation,and with the assitanoe of improved anetra implements produced more grain than they had ever produced before, £«t-whemr It war only whan they vautod to soil tha grain that their troubles began. They discovered that there r/as no such thing as an open uorket.The selling price of grain was strictly contx‘ollod f a3ad was a v*r/ low one.The buyers vere the Govenment. Discontent arose,and It wan nggrav&amp;ted by the exorbitant prices they wore called upon to psy for lemons and cloth,and every other or* tide of necessity which nowadays has to be imported from abroad .And then the peasants had a brilliant idea.... Although the selling price of grain was state controlledthere \ was no such control on the selling price of butter and eggs and other local produce .Henceforth, therefore! it would be a question of no leaons-no grain* in other words,instead of accumulating ^ r &amp;in and selling it to the Govern* mont,they would use it themselves for rearing and fattening stock and poul* try.ihio they could always sell profitably in tho neighbouring towns,and would furthermore have the double satisfaction of feeling that they were both getting a little of their own back on the townspeople by selling to them at their own price,and were alee thwarting the Soviet authorities by hav ing no grain to sell them, lliis policy was carried into effect last year with the very greatest success. It will be remembered that early in the year the Soviet authorities predicted a very large exportable surplus of grain.When the harvest came there was no grain for export.The markets of the world were affected,and the boviet Goverauent were accused of issuing misleading reports In point of fact,however,the Soviets were guilty of nothing so clever.They had simply not calculated on the peasantry,who disposed of their grain for local purposes,and had none left over for export. The blow was a heavy one for the Soviets,end led to very grave discussions in Ihsoow*Aim It van that M.’lukharin mod othero of tho uoro sorioud laadere got up and doclared that tho poaoa^try imui u« bom m&lt;me aunt bo at roaso&amp;able priced found of supplying thor/r,-itli suuh forti^n aanttfaatupos as lk*y roquirod and which Ttuesla could not produce, and tliai this could only be done if the pres ent *yf*tm of etato ccntrollod f^rei^a trade were abolished. 'Aen it was,in the autumn of last year,that Conrads 'inoviov arose and rotorted that suoh action won vorctionFU'y and tantsnc&lt;unt to poll ileal suicide, that whatever happanod,tho diotatorship of the Workers must be mintainsd,and that if the peasantry would not do their duty and sell their grain at reasonable prices, recourse Bust he had to sterner measures. xliat,said 2iukharin,wuuld mean putting back the oloek three years,and ttas simply out of the question. ftiereupon began the aohism in the party .Comrade Zinoviev was sent back to heningrad thoroughly disgruntled,and tho question of the p&amp;cifionise tion of the peasantry was put doen as one of pressing urgency to be brought up at future conferences. Meanwhile the months have gone by,and the question appears td be no nearer a solution .All parties admit that the peasant question consti tutes the crucial problem.All admit that aone changes au&amp;t be made in the present esonomic system. Yet none have yet so far had the oourags to propose seriously the ab lltion of the State monopoly of foreign trade,for they know that once that goes,they will have net only eoianitted political sui- oide 9 but they will also have lost their financial hold over the country. Such a moment might well mark the practice! end of the Dictatorship of ths Russian orkers.SM6/ei/S4). “A, i 1 . J* 4 IMHNI.tlF^: ■, ,. .1, 18tb kajr 1938.

My dear Hoare, The India Office have suggested to us that it would be very interesting if you could let us have a review of the general effects of Soviet commercial methods in Persia with special reference to the political aspect of the question. 2. I imagine that this will not be a very easy job, and perhaps the present moment, when Perso—Soviet relations are in so . luid a condition, may not be the best possible time at which to undertake it. So far as that goes, there is no immediate urgency, and you may prefer to wait a little until the situation as regards the outcome of the Persian boycott and the possible revision of the existing treaty position is clearer. But we should be grateful if you would some time or other consider the possibility of letting us have a memorandum or despatch which would give us a more general view than one gets from Lingeman*s reports, and which, as I said above, will deal more particularly with the political side. The whole Perso-Soviet commercial relationship is so complicated that it is extremely hard to follow from here, and at the same time it is of course of the greatest interest to us. Indeed, v;e feel that it would be rather a good plan if you could conveniently start a regular series of such despatches or memoranda reviewing the situation at intervals of a few months. (Sd.)

INDIA OFFICE |fiffQcts of the Persian Trade Monopoly Laws and the Perso-Soviet Treaty upon Soviet commercial penetration in Persia. It seems convenient to start this note with a very brief description of the so-called Persian Trade Monopoly Laws. The original Trade Monopoly Law consisted of a single article, passed on 25th February, 1931, declaring foreign trade to be a monopoly of tne state which reserved to itself the right of import and export of natural and industrial products. This was followed on the 11th March by an annexe to the original Law consisting of eighteen articles, the chief provisions of which were as follows: (1) The import of goods into Persia is made dependent on the export of Persian products of a like value. (2) Individuals or commercial concerns are allowed, on special conditions and under special permit, to import products which the Government does not wish to import directly itself; import permits for such goods are to be issued on presentation of certificates which can be bought from importers, showing that exports of equivalent value have been made. (3) Exporting is to be more or less free from restriction except where the Government itself undertakes the export or gives the sole right of exporting to another party. (4) The export of oil and fishery products does not give any right to import in exchange. (5) Every year the Government will publish a list of goods that may be imported during the following twelve months within certain limits,as well as the quotas that may be imported through each customs post. , qa inn yipt cent*, of 'their foreign (6) Exporters must sell 100 per cen exchange/2 exchange to the Ooveminent, but certain exporters may be liberated from this obligation. (7) If an exporter within the period prescribed for the sale of his exchange to the Government imports goods which it is open to him under the law to import, the obligation to sell his exchange will be reduced proportionately to the value of the goods imported by him. t&lt;r ,«aA r %%&lt;4'~Y ?.z. **/n The idea underlying the Trade Monopoly Laws was that all imports into Persia should be balanced by the export of an equivalent value of Persian goods other than oil and fishery products. It was hoped at the time that the whole of the oil royalties accruing to the Government could be devoted to the building up of a gold reserve with a view to the introduction of a gold standard in Persia. But it was also frequently asserted by the Persian Minister of Court and by other members of the Persian Government that one of the chief reasons for the introduction of the trade monopoly regime was the desire to check the flooding of the Persian market by the dumping of Soviet imports. They appear to have thought that this object would be attained by imposing on the Russians the obligation to export Persian goods to the value of their imports into Persia, but actually the law was bound to favour the Russians, who are the principal consumers of Persian agricultural products. Also the organisation of Soviet trade in Persia in big state trading concerns made it better suited than most of its competitors to the conditions of the new regime. The initial advantages of the Russians were considerably increased by the special privileges granted to them by the Perso-Soviet Treaty (signed on 27th October, /sr&gt; 1931/1931, and ratified on 22nd June, 1932 ) in return for an undertaking that Perso-Soviet trade would be exactly balanced. The relevant provisions of the Treaty are contained in Article X. ’'Persia permits Russia to import and Russia undertakes to import into Persia goods the nature and volume of which will be indicated in an annual list to be determined on the basis of the annual quotas published by the Persian Govemment'. Such a list is to be drawn up at the moment of the signature of the Treaty and subsequently while the convention remains in force (viz. for three years from the exchange of ratifications) at the end of each Persian economic year which commences on 22nd June. The parties will take into consideration the necessity of maintaining the percentage of Soviet participation in the import of each of the goods included in the list, in order that that percentage may not be less than that of the original list. The U.S.S.R. is to receive its share of any increase in the quotas. The U.S.S.R. also reserves the right to demand, at the latest at the end of the first six months of the year, a reduction in the volume of their quotas except in the case of sugar and matches (Article X(l))« In view of the fact that trade will be exactly balanced, Persia agrees, in the case of goods included in the list, not to make the issue of import licences subject to '^previous presentation of export certificates (Article X (2)). For the same reason Soviet economic organisations in Persia are exempted from the obligation of selling their foreign exchange to the Government (Article X (3)). The Russian percentages of the quotas are importable through any customs post (Article X (4)). The/The U.S.S.R. if? to supply the whole of Persian requirements of sugar and matches which are a Persian state monopoly (Article X (6)). Actually the Russians were allowed to import o without previously producing export certificates even before the signature of the Treaty, and they took the opportunity of the confusion and uncertainty which resulted from the introduction of the Trade Monopoly Law to entrench themselves firmly in the Persian market. Other importers were often afraid, or could not afford to tie up their capital in export certificates, and the Russians were able to buy up certific abea, thus assuring themselves of a monopoly of the right to import. Their exemption from the obligation to produce export certificates before importing was a great advantage owing to the seasonal nature of Persian trade, since it enabled them to spread out their sales and purchases throughout the year. The import quotas granted to them (including their monopoly of sugar and matches) amounted to over 50 per cent, of the whole import trade into Persia. Several protests were made by our representatives at Tehran against the operation of the Trade Monopoly Law and the Perso-Soviet Treaty but these were of no avail. The Persians merely replied that if we also agreed to balance our trade with Persia,they would conclude a treaty with us on the lines of the Perso-Soviet Treaty and allot to us a proportion of the 'free' quotas not already granted to the Russians. It was difficult to persuade them that it might not be possible for other nations whose trade was organised on totally different lines from Soviet trade to enter into agreements of this kind (all the more so in the face of Soviet/5 . &amp; ^ .. ^ E ~o. u^/n ** Jur /c Tfa c S &lt;\ u^«^' &lt;^oC (X^tw/' inJt It i r C* tk. ^ Soviet competition). The Trade Monopoly Law did not succeed in balancing Persian trade largely owing to the systematic over valuation of exports and under-valuation of imports at the customs, and a new Trade Monopoly Law was passed on 10th July, 1932, in an effort to ensure a true balance of trade and of exchange operations by making payment for imports dependent on the price obtained for Persian exports. Thus applications for import licences are only to be accepted if supported by certificates of exoort, the exchange for which has already been sold to the Government, and exchange bought on the market and not obtained from export will not be accepted for the purpose. There are, however, two exceptions to the above. Import licences will be granted without the production of export certificates (1) to those who have made special arrangements with the Government (i.e. the'Russians); (2) to those who present an engagement guaranteed by a bank that exchange to the value of' imports effected by them will be sold to the Government, unless certificates of exoort and of sale of the relative exchange are produced within six months. By this new law, the Russian position remained a- unchanged while that of others was made more difficult by the requirement regarding prior sale of exchange, and the Commercial Secretary at Tehran thought that the bank guarantee arrangement, which might have gone some way to reduce the advantages of the Russians, would not work in ^ f.? 27?^^ practice. The position regarding it is still somewhat obscure. The Russians made the most unscrupulous use of their dominating position in the Persian market. Among other things, Persian merchants complain that the Russians insist/6 . insist on early payment for their goods but only buy Persian /&gt; produce on long credit terms which are often broken; that goods bought in Persia by the Russians are dumped abroad at uneconomic prices to the detriment of Persian trade; that the Russians offer advantageous discounts to Persians who can pay for their goods in foreign exchange and then, having obtained foreign exchange for their own goods, claim that they have not enough Persian currency to pay for Persian produce; that at times they refuse to sell stocks when they are needed in order to force prices up and then again try to break competitors by selling at uneconomically low prices if other goods are introduced; that the obligation to balance their trade at the end of the Persian economic year, inaccordance with the Treaty, is not being observed; that Soviet offices in Persia are a centre for subversive propaganda; etc. etc. It has been suggested that the Russians are actually trying by these tactics to arouse distress and discontent^ so as to discredit the present 'Julers of Persia as the authors of an unpopular economic system and thus bring about a social upheaval. In view of this suggestion, a remark once made by M. Petrovski, the Russian Minister in Tehran, to the Belgian Minister is possibly significant. S'crirutA M. Petrovski said that/Russia was not out to dominate the Persian market; its interest in Persia was political rather than commercial since it had other outlets for its goods. Relations between Persia and the U.S.S.R. are at present extremely strained. The Persians have attempted to counter Soviet tactics by ^ monopolistic institutions under the control of the Persian Trade Corporation, and I understand that the Russians have threatened/threatened to close the Russian frontier to Persian goods It is possible that the Perso-Soviet Treaty, which appears to be in abeyance, may be revised in the near rn*JL &lt;ri #JL Ccry* future so as to meet rne Persians, or, alternatively, that it may cease to exist altogether.Draft Paper. rOLiri a .^Department d.&lt;aFT C.F.A.

This note sent from Tehran of a farther conversation with Gen* Ayrom, the Persian Chief of Police, is again very interesting/^/z *&lt;!/*&gt; ' ^/j Inter alia it mentions the ase made by the Soviet of their trade agents as propaganda agents. In Persia, onlike south eastern Afghanistan, the Soviet have, of coarse, in any case ample opportunities for propaganda through their consulates throughout the country. But this reference to propaganda by trade agents goes to confirm the wisdom of the Afghan Govt, in refusing a commercial treaty of the kind pressed upon them by the Soviet. The Afghan Govt., as they informed us, have learnt from Persia’s experience of her commercial treaty with the Soviet which, apart from the political dangers that it may have for Persia, is understood to have/c w have proved to be of little commercial advantage to her, while giving great advantages to Russian trade, which the Soviet exploit to the full. Mr. Baggallay, who is on short leave from Tehran, had a long talk with me the other day, mainly in regard to the internal situation in Persia and the effects of the Russian commercial treaty. Under this treaty the Soviet is given quotas (in some cases amounting to 1C0%) of the imports of various commodities into Persia, and engages to take in exchange Persian goods of equivalent value. They are able to work this arrangement (e.g., by shutting down and releasing Russian exports to Persia as it suits them) so as to get the maximum of advantage without any regard to Persia's interests. Mr. Baggallay thought that an effect (if not an object) of Soviet trade policy in Persia is to increase economic distress and consequently political discontent. The whole of the conversation with Gen. Ayrom recorded in the present paper is interesting. He seems to have a clear insight into the dangers of Soviet economic ■pressure and other activities in Persia. /ta t-v— l?l.

Department. &gt; 9.32 It is clear that there are two possible ways in which the Soviet might achieve their object of obtaining political domination of the Asiatic countries bordering the Soviet Union:- (1) by obtaining a predominant influence over the existing govts, of those countries; (2) by stirring up internal discontent and disaffection, with a view to upsetting those govts, and replacing them by others more amenable to Soviet influence. Where the existing govts., as in Afghanistan, and also Persia and Sinkiang, distrust the U.S.S.R., the Soviet's difficulty in obtaining their object by the first means is likely to make them have resort to the second. From this point of view, the unpopularity of the Soviet with the governing classes in Persia is not such a comfort to us as it might otherwise appear. The danger is that, through economic and political discontent (very likely fostered by the Soviet), the present Persian regime may be upset; the first result would probably be (in present circumstances) a period of confusion, which might give the Soviet their chance of setting up a pro-Soviet administration, or migjit, perhaps more probably, imperil the unity of the country which has been achieved and is somewhat precariously preserved by the present Shah. Though the weakness and disunion of Persia might in some ways make matters easier for us in the Persian Gulf, this advantage - if itb®—•He - would, I think, be certainly greatly outweighed by the sacrifice of a relatively strong/,X£P In mii y furtlier nommuniontion on thi^ subjert, please quote N »- E (oV\'l\\^ti\3U i —vot to any person by name, but tc and address —not to any person By name, but to— ‘The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. 1.

Sir, With reference to ay despatch No. 390 of September 10th I hare the honour to transmit to you an account of a further conversation between the Acting Oriental Secretary and General Ayrom, the Chief of Police, on the subject of Soviet activity in Persia. General Ayrow’e statements have every appearance of being sincere. 2. His majesty’s Consul-General at Isfahan also reports that there are occasional echoes of Soviet propaganda in Isfahan and the neighbouring districts. A little while ago, for instance* the brother-in-law of a certain Yusuf Zadeh, the dragoman of the Soviet Consulate-General, was found to be organising committee/ of young men for the purpose of distributing communistic liter ature. ifce brother-in-law was arrested and Yusuf Zadeh ordered to leave the country, in spite, it was said, of strong protests by the Soviet dabaesy. The Soviet agents are said to be mainly employees of the Pcrseznaft. 3. The Tabriz manifesto which forms the subject of my despatch No. 4^3 dated November 1st comes as a further comment ary on general Ayrom’s statements. 4. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 220). I have the honour to be with the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant* (Signed) R.H.HOARE. The Right Honourabls Sir John Simon G.C.S.I., etc., etc., etc.,I called on Sartlp Ayrom yesterday and he again spoke at length about Soviet propaganda in Persia* He began the conversation by saying 'How long are the JSuropean powers going to allow the Soviet to carry on their propaganda so freely? w I asked him whether his remark Implied that he had obtained further information about their activities in this country* He then stated that as a result of the discovery some weeks ago of the espionage system in Tehran and also as a result of the deportation of Soviet agents, their former organ isation had been fairly effectively broken, but that they were busy forming another intelligence and propaganda system* He repeated that the whole Soviet representation in this country, from the Ambassador to the humblest officials in their trade offices were all active propaganda agents* He was doing his best to impress this fact on the Persian Government, but they seemed extremely reluctant to believe it* He had found Feroughi part icularly difficult to persuade, but he was glad to say that he thought that the lhah was beginning to realise the real state of affairs. He had been requested on one or two occasions to attend meetings at which Teymourtache, Davar and the Minister for Foreign Affairs were present, to explain his case and produce proofs. He thought he had succeeded to a certain extent, but the Ministers were still very anxious to avoid friction with the Russians. He would give the following example of the extent to which the Soviet agents could influence the Ministers* At a meeting held a little while ago between the Soviet Ambassador, Teymourtache and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, it had been decided that Soviet trade agents in this country should obtain their permis de sliour from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and not from the Police. This meant that the Police would haveno control oyer Soviet agents in this country. A case in point had arisen at Meshed where the Soviet trade agency had applied to the Governor-General and obtained a pernit for one of their staff without reference to the police. Ayron had cancelled the permit. He had flatly refused to allow Soviet employees to obtaii their permits from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. He had quoted the Law concerning the Hesidence of Foreigners in Persia and asked whether one law was to be applied to the Kussiaas and another to all other foreigners. He had won his point much to the annoyance of the Kussians who began to say that a new influence had arisen in the councils of the Persian Government; that until recently the Government's policy had been dictated by Teymour, but that now there were two conflicting policies. I asked Ayrom whether he could give any reason for this apparent friendliness towards the Soviet* He *aid that the Ministers were very anxious to make commercial agreements with the Soviet and that in their efforts to gain some small temp orary commercial victory over the Soviet Government they were » quite blind to the danger of Soviet propaganda in this country* Recently Teymour had mentioned with great satisfaction n profit of seven million Rials that Persia had gained through her sugar transactions. Ayrom retorted that seven hundred million would I be of no use when in a few years time the country had gone Bolshevik. Ayrom continued that for some time he had urged the Govern^* j ment to adopt a firmer attitude towards the Soviet. It was he who had recently persuaded the Government to send a stiff reply to a Soviet note which constituted an unwarrantable interference in Persian affairs. The argunrntB Ayrom used with the Persian Ministers were roughlyroughly as follows M I Persia was exposed to Russian attack in two ways: by military invasion, which she could not possibly hope to resist unaided; and by economic pressure. With regard to the former, he argued that in these days of the League of Nations etcetera, the danger of military invasion was remote. In any case Persia^ southern neighbour could surely not stand by and let Persia be overrun. Economic attack, on the other hand, was already being used, but he felt sure the Soviet Government would not go so far as to refuse entirely to trade with Persia. They were now looking to the East to carry out their plans and a complete break with Persia would do no good to their chances of gaining their ends in Eastern and Moslem countries; besides they needed their trade with Persia and the profit derived therefrom. He thought therefore that there was no real danger in taking a firm stand against Soviet action in this country. He thought his arguments together with his proofs of their prop aganda activities were at last having some effect on the Ministers. Ayrom continued that the Soviet were especially anxious to obtain information from four of the Legations in Tehran - the British, the French, the Japanese and the Polish. He advised us to take all precautions with our post and added that he was not yet certain that the Soviet did not have some agent in our Legation. But he had no proof of this. In the ^ench Legation they were interested int the Military Attachd or rather in a lady who was his friend. Ayrom claimed to be very well informed of Soviet activities to know most of their secret agents etcetera. Because he was taking no active steps against them at present the Soviet thought he was ill-informed. But his Inaction was dictated by the Persian Ministers who were still afraid to risk a quarrel with the Soviet.A 6^74 - -5f O (E 5585/47/24) b^' CrU&gt;a {mi /^*4 -&gt;^ 6«M Y v */* v4Mt ^ '• ^ FOHEIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. 17tli November, 1932. £i*4' A/c*. »,».

You have since received Farrer's comments on this essay, and I fear we have little to add and no constructive suggestions to make. Blanch's general conclusions, though disquieting, do not appear to us to be exaggerated, and while we do not question the accuracy of Farrer's criticisms, the fact remains that as far as Persia alone is concerned the Soviet Union has the power to drive us right out of the market, and is likely to exercise that power to the full. 3.

Moreover it is arguable that the South should prove on the whole more susceptible to Soviet propaganda than the North, which is constantly reminded of the realities of life in the Soviet Union by the steady stream of Mohammedan refugees from beyond the two frontiers. 4. The Persians themselves are of course not anxious to come under the exclusive economic influence of Russia;mlHussia; but the trade monopoly legislation and the new Perso-Soviet treaty suggest that they are not likely to be able to react to any purpose.?SH 9&lt;^ lx C: ^ ^ .

But even allowing for this the general picture painted by Mr. Blanch is a disturbing one, though I fear there is little, if anything, which we can usefully do at the moment beyond keep a watch on developments. 5.

From this ooint of view they are apparently inclined to doubt whether'Russia’s trade with Persia is of much advantage to her, and consequently whether the increase in it will be permanent. But this ignores the point made in the last para, but two of the memo., where Mr. Blanch recognises that the Soviet does not gain much advantage in the form of foreign exchange, and that 'their motive may therefore be assumed to be political'. From our point of view, this, of course, is the crux of the matter. It is for consideration whether the F.O. might not be asked to obtain from Mr. Hoare his appreciation of the question of the risk of Russia's commercial expansion in Persia leading ultimately to a dangerous increase in her political influence in that country. * Vz, n.

Dear Rendel, Many thanks for your letter E.4627/47/34 of the 8th October, which I found waiting for me on my return from leave. 2 I have read Blanch’s memorandum with great interest. As you know, the subject of Russian competition in Persia generally, is one with which we have been closely preoccupied here for many years, and our view is that Blanch’s memorandum is an excellent contribution to a most intricate subject. Crowe is, in fact, asking Gye to make a note on Blanch’s private file regarding this excellent piece of work. 3. While I should not like it to be thought that I was in any way impugning the value of the memorandum I feel that, from a purely commercial point of view, it is not altogether exhaustive. For in dealing with the competition of one country within the confines of another, it is obviously necessary if one is to make any forecast of real value, to take into account not only the conditions of the country in which the competition takes place, but the relative strength of the competitive country itself and its industries. Blanch has attempted to do this on page 4 of his memorandum: - but naturally enough his data regarding the tendencies within the Soviet Union to pay are incomplete. Furthermore, probably owing to having no access to official Soviet figures, I am not quite certain that he assesses, at its proper and comparatively small value, the relative importance of the Persian and Persian Gulf markets as compared with the total export markets at present enjoyed by the Soviet Government. 4. If the memorandum were to be expanded by dilation upon these two points, I think it would be found that the picture was a little less depressing. The Russian figures show that in N spite/spite of these intensive efforts in adjacent and chiefly Oriental markets, their total excess of imports into Russia continued to exceed the value of their total exports^for the year ending December 3let/ ^his adverse balance was no less than 30 million sterling, while for the first six months of the present year the adverse balance was over 13 million sterlings that means in the absence of invisible exports that the Soviet Union cannot indefinitely continue the process of feeding upon its own tail, anl also that the more intensive her efforts to increase her export trade in one or two contiguous markets, the lower sinks the level of value received for them, owing to a natural fall in price. Even if, therefore, she obtained the ole of the Persian Gulf market, it would not necessarily save her economic soul. 5 * With regard to the reference to the development of towns in the Soviet Union ( M the huge industrial cities springing up like mushroom growths all over the country'*) I think it must be remembered that although the industrial capabilities of the Union may be sufficient to swamp the Persian market, they are very far from sufficing at present either for purchases of internal consumption or for providing the Soviet State with the necessary valuta to pay for her imports, what does matter, of course, is the development of Russian raw materials and agricultural products, and upon this aspect of Russian competition, namely, the differentiation between the commodities which she had to export, i.e. raw semi-manufactured materials on the one hand, and fully manufactured on the other, the author is silent. It would, in our view, be even more depressing were it to be found that the Soviet Union was competing successfully in raw materials, as that would mean that she was trying to develop upon the right lines. I have sent a copy of Blanch’s memorandum to Paton as you suggested. Please forgive so long a letter. (signed) Cecil C. Parrer.INDIA OFFICE, AHITiiiALL, 3. W. 1. 24th October 1932.

Russian Trade with South Persia. the following memorandum, written by Mr. Probationer Vice-Consul Blanch was forwarded to the Foreign Office on the 1 st August by Mr. Hoare “ as a valuable contribution to a subject that is becoming increasingly serious ” Foreign Office, September 28, 1932. Memorandum respecting Economic Characteristics of Russian Trade with the South of Persia as Compared with British. IN 1913 the United Kingdom could look back upon a period of 150 years and more during which British trade in the Persian Gulf and Southern Persia had enjoyed steady, uninterrupted, and, with the disappearance of the Portu guese and Dutch trading establishments, almost unchallenged progress. During this time, and in particular during the latter half of the nineteenth century, British enterprise had established in this region important commercial interests, so that by the beginning of the twentieth century British goods constituted in the neighbourhood of 75 per cent, of the total imports of Southern Persian ports. A virtual monopoly of the sea-borne trade of the Gulf was in the hands of the B.I., Strick and Bucknall shipping companies. Banking was entirely in the hands cf the Imperial Bank of Persia. In 1913 Russia could look back upon a bare ten years of a commercial activity in the Gulf, which consisted solely in the annual despatch to those waters from Odessa of four vessels of the Russian volunteer fleet. This undertaking cost the Russian Ministry of Commercial Marine some £20,000 a year in subsidies, and could not, by the outbreak of the Great War, be said to have achieved results of a commercial nature which were in the least encouraging. The Russian steam ship service to the Gulf, however, while actuated no doubt to some extent by the desire to obtain an early foothold for Russia in the promising markets of the Middle East, owed its inauguration in large measure also 'to the need for upholding Russian prestige in the Moslem world and to counteract the ever- extending growth of German influence in Asia Minor and Arabia. I hus Russia s appearance in South Persian markets was largely due to political motives and did not, in the period preceding the war, constituted 'serious menace. In Isfahan, within the Russian zone and towards the northern fringe of what may be termed the almost exclusively British market in Persia, Russian penetration was more apparent. The relative position of both Powers had, however, been virtually stabilised by the 1907 agreement. As regards the total trade of the country Russia predominated, claiming over 50 per cent, of the aggregate figure, the British Empire appearing as a bad second with 25 per cent. Furthermore, Russian imports were at this 'time little, if at all, in excess of the British figure, and were approximately balanced by her exports of Persian produce. Thus there seemed grounds for the Russian contention that their country’s trade with Persia was founded on a very much better balanced and, from the Persian standpoint, a more beneficial basis, than the British. Certainly, Russia would appear to have been a far better customer for Persia. With the advent of the world war and the Bolshevik revolution. Russia disappeared from the Persian trade picture and the British Empire stepped into her place. It was not until the end of 1921 that Soviet Russia, till then fully occupied with the establishment of a new order of things, was able to look outside her own [579 ee—1]borders and devote attention to the recapture of lost markets in Persia. In the autumn of that year was begun a big Russian commercial attack in the north of Persia which was to drive out British trade and sweep all before it till it reached the Gulf. Representatives of Vneshtorg and other kindred Soviet Government trade institutions established themselves in the principal trading centres of the country, penetrating as far south as Shiraz. But this first attempt by post-war Russia to re-establish her commercial preponderance in Persia did not meet with much success. The Caucasian trade routes were not reopened and Persian merchants were antagonised by the high-handed methods and monopolistic tendencies of the Soviet trading institutions. After some two years’ activity, this phase of Bolshevik commercial penetration came to an end. As the trade figures show, it did not achieve any very striking results, the total volume of Russian trade remaining insignificant compared with British. As a purchasing agency for the agricultural product of the northern provinces, desperately needed by famine-stricken Russia, it may have met with a tolerable measure of success. In the south, its effects were in no way felt. It was otherwise with the second phase of the Russian attack on the Persian markets, which may be said to have had its beginnings in 1923, under the aegis of the Sharq Company, and only terminated with the liquidation of that psuedo- -commercial organisation in the early days of 1932. The Russians, realising that the undisguised Communist nature of 'their first attempt was meeting with no success, decided to conduct their activities through the medium of this more commercially-constituted concern, in which Persian merchants were invited to invest capital. During this period Russian imports increased from about 10 per cent, to 40 per cent, of the total. A network of Russian commercial institutions was spread all over the south, including Shiraz, Kerman, Mohammerah, Bushire and Bandar Abbas. Russian sailings to the Gulf were resumed, making man) more trips, and landing far more cargo than ever did the pre-war service. Finally, two trade agreements were conchided (those of 1927 and 1931), the second of which, under the Persian Trade Monopoly Law, concedes to Russia over 50 per cent, of the country’s total trade. This second wave did not actually reach Southern Persia until 1927, or assume a threatening aspect until the following year. By then, however, Soviet oil products and cotton goods were being dumped in Shiraz and Kerman at prices with which it was impossible for normal traders to compete. In Kerman, in particular, with the arrival of cotton goods and sugar landed at Bandar Abbas by the first Russian ships to resume sailings to the Gulf, the flourishing trade conducted through India in these commodities by Hindu traders was entirely disorganised, while in Shiraz even the longest established distributors of British imports found themselves in serious difficulties. It looked as if the “Forced Export Campaign’’ of the Soviet Five-Year Plan had adopted as one of its objects the complete dislocation of trade in this hitherto unassailed British preserve. Apart from disorganising the market, a secondary objective appeared to be to secure as much foreign exchange as possible. This latter feature, wdiile readily understandable when the special need of foreign exchange for the purchase of American machinery and American expert advice under the Five-Year Plan is taken into account, hardly appeared in keeping with the terms of the 1927 agreement, under which Russo-Persian trade w-as supposed to balance, for it obviously denoted an excess of Russian exports ( into Persia. In actual fact, ever since 1926, when the Russians closed their frontier to Persian produce, the two countries’ trade has always shown a balance in favour of Russia. The 1927 agreement also provided for a new customs tariff in place of the 1903 convention, which, ever since the reopening of trade relations, had been forced upon Persia by the Russians to their manifest advantage and corresponding harm to British imports, subjected to the higher rates of duty fixed by the terms 'of the Anglo-Persian Commercial Agreement of 1920. It is somewhat curious that, in spite of the tariff advantage thus enjoyed by the Russians, they did not sooner make an appearance in Southern Persia. By 1928. when the really serious penetration of Russian trade into the south began, they had lost this advantage. On the other hand, the Tariff Autonomy Treaty of 1928 had abolished the old agglomeration of road tolls, which in former days had discriminated against that merchandise which had furthest to travel from the frontier. These road tolls had always militated against British goods incompetition with Russian in Northern Persia before the war, and would no doubt have similarly handicapped Russian goods travelling all the way from the Caspian to Kerman, Shiraz and further south. In any case, the results of the Russian attack on the south, as far as British interests are concerned, have been disastrous. Ever since the first Russian steamer arrived in the Gulf in the early part of 1928 there has been a steady rise F in Russian imports through the southern ports. In 1929 these were important rather on account of the disturbing effect they had on the market than by reason of their quantity, but in 1931 the imports themselves represent a considerable proportion of the total, and the Sharq agencies have established a virtual control of the sugar and piece-goods markets, commodities which constitute as it were the backbone and ribs of the commerce of the south. At one time extending credit, at another withholding it, now raising, now lowering their prices, their main policy would appear to have been to upset the market as much as possible. In this they have been greatly assisted, almost from the first, by the dislocation of trade caused by the closing of the Bushire-Shiraz Road in the summer of 1929, and subsequently by the blighting effects of the Persian Government’s efforts to control the exchange situation in 1930, followed by the introduction of the Trade Monopoly Law in March 1931. This latter, much advertised in its early days as an anti-Russian dumping measure, provided them, on the contrary, with the means to exercise an even greater degree of control over Persian markets than formerly. Its basic principle, namely, that imports can only be made against corresponding Persian exports and permission for their entry only accorded against applications accompanied by customs certificates of such exports, was bound to favour the Russians, the biggest •consumers of Persian agricultural produce. In addition to this, its provision making export certificates saleable put at their disposal a ready means of cornering as much of the import quotas as they wished. By October they had negotiated a commercial treaty under the terms of the Monopoly, which conceded to them, among other things, 100 per cent, of all sugar, oil and matches and 50 per cent, of manufactured cotton imports, the total of the import quotas allotted to Russia aggregating over 50 per cent, of the total permissible imports. The treaty specified besides that Russian trading institutions should not be required, like other merchants, to attach actual export certificates to their applications for import licences; a provision which, in view of the seasonal nature of Persia’s exports, conferred upon them a very notable advantage. It is only necessary to state that in 1930-31, of the total weight of imports through Bushire, 70 per cent, was accounted for by sugar and 30 per cent, of the total value of imports by cotton goods, for the full significance of the future Russian menace to British shipping interests resulting from this treaty to become apparent. Heretofore the bulk of sugar and cotton imports have been carried in British bottoms. Such, then, is the achievement of Soviet Russia in the past five years. She has wrested from United Kingdom and Indian traders not only their dominating position in the Persian market as a whole, but, with alarming rapidity, extended the scope of the Soviet commercial activities throughout those districts of Persia heretofore considered the very strongholds of British trade and struck at the very foundations upon which this trade rested in the south. Her goods are now familiar and current from Bushire to Shiraz, from Bandar Abbas to Kerman. In 1913 a few Russian traders struggled to introduce their goods into Southern Persia. They lacked knowledge of the conditions of the market, they lacked the ability to inspire confidence and they lacked adequate official representation. Their sugar was of the wrong kind, their piece-goods of unfamiliar dimensions. Above all, they were endeavouring to compete on an economic basis, in a market far removed from their manufacturing centres, with rivals whose connexions in that same market had been built up over hundreds of years, who enjoyed a full measure of confidence, whose goods were the standard by which all others were judged, and who benefited by a virtual monopoly in the supply of the shipping and banking facilities whereby the trade of the whole Southern Persia was carried on. With the Russia of 1932 it is very different. The individual trader is replaced by the State. The State-run factories manufacture the goods, State-run ships transport them, and Vneshtorg, the Russian State Trading Organisation,I distributes them. From start to finish every factor in the cost of production is absolutely controlled by a gigantic organisation that is a law unto itself, and for whom, so long as the object in view be achieved, the immediate commercial loss involved is of little importance. Such competition is backed by the combined and co-ordinate resources of the whole State. Against it the individualistic and disunited trade organisations of the capitalist State cannot hope to compete. /—s It has been said, by way of consolation, that the strength of Russian competition in South Persia is based on artificial factors which cannot be indefinitely maintained. With their removal, orthodox trade will be quick to recover lost ground. This view may have had much to support it in the earlier days of the attack, when there seemed every reason to suppose that Russian goods were being dumped in Southern Persia and sold regardless of the loss involved. At the present time their methods have assumed a far more normal business /ispect, and, in view of the concrete advantages afforded them over all competition by the 1931 Trade Agreement, there seems every prospect of their being able henceforward to hold the position acquired, and to extend it at will, if not profitably, at least at no very great expense. The outlook cannot be said to be in the least reassuring. The future of Soviet foreign trade is presumably largely dependent on the measure of success attained by the present schemes for the industrialisation of Russia. Perhaps their achievement may automatically bring about a contraction of Russian exports of which the underlying cause is the pressing need of the Soviet Government for the foreign exchange essential to the execution of those schemes, and which, with their consummation, will presumably automatically cease. Perhaps, also, the frantic efforts of the Soviet authorities to make of Russia in a few years an industrially independent unit may utterly break down. As regards the first alternative, it may at once be said that Russian exports to Southern Persia, though undoubtedly partaking of the nature of forced exports, in that textiles and sugar are both commodities of which there is a famine in Moscow, do not now appear to be contributing, or to be intended to contribute, to the Soviet Government’s supplies of foreign exchange. Their } motive may therefore be assumed to be political, and success of the Soviet industrial 'policy, far from resulting in a release of the economic pressure now exerted, may consequently be expected to result in its intensification and extension. The menace under such circumstances is no longer confined to British commercial interests in Persia alone, but becomes a challenge of the first magnitude to the trade supremacy of Britain in the Gulf as a whole, the under mining of which may be expected to constitute one of the earliest objectives of a successfully industrialised Russia. \ The second alternative would appear rather in the nature of a hope than of a probability. The first Five-Year Plan may not have achieved the standard set, but it cannot be said to have failed. In 'spite of two unpremeditated adverse factors of the first import, namely, the destruction by Russian peasants of 25 per cent, of the country's live-stock in the early days of the plan, and, secondly, the unprecedented slump of raw material prices on world markets, achievement has come within measurable distance of the objective. With the help of American engineers and machinery, Russia is arming herself with industrial weapons of the first order. Will she be able to use them? Are the huge industrial cities springing up like mushroom growths all over the country destined to become derelict monuments testifying to the failure of the greatest social experiment ever attempted ? Do the leaders of the State possess the ability to evolve in Russia a new order eventually capable of standing without the support of ruthless force ? If so, then the prospect of a Russian State possessed of boundless natural resources, exploiting those resources with the labour potentialities of a rigidly controlled population of 180 millions, and animated by a fieice fanaticism tor a social creed such as has formerly characterised only great religious movements, introduces factors of world-wide significance and limitless possibilities. But the Russian Colossus has never yet achieved results commensurate with its size.

October 25, 1932. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. [E 5572/47/34] No. 1. Mr. Hoare to Sir John Simon.—(Received October 25.) (No. 421. Very Confidential.) ^i rj ' Gulhek, October 6 , 1932. IN continuation of my despatch No. 409 of the 24th September on the subject of Perso-Sovietic trade relations, I have the honour to report that at the interv iew with Teymourtache, recorded in my telegram No. 149 of the 29th September, 1 asked his Highness whether there had been any recent developments. 2 . He set oft at full speed, asking me to treat his remarks a.s quite private and confidential; he began with the sweeping statement that the Soviet represen tatives in this country were unquestionably the most shameless liars in the world, as evidenced by the dementi inserted by the T ass Agency quoted in the enclosure to my despatch under reference. It was fantastic to deny, as the commercial representative of the Soviet Government had done, statements to w T hich, roughly, forty persons could bear witness. 3 . During his own illness, the Soviet Ambassador and his subordinates had conducted a vigorous propaganda, intended to convince the Persian Government and the commercial community generally that, in the present disastrous economic state of the country, the Soviet Government could not deliver the imports which they were bound to deliver unless the transactions were financed by the Persian Government, and they had apparently been so far successful that the I rime Minister, Minister of Finance and others had given some vague endorsement to this astounding thesis. The result was that on his Highness s return to work he had to act with considerably energy. In fact, he told the Soviet representatives that whatever his colleagues might have said not one rial of credit would be granted by the Persian Government in order to relieve the Soviet Government ot their obligations. „ , . .. , 4. His High ness went on to say that one of his preoccupations when negotiating the commercial treaty had been lest the Soviet Government, by one means or another should manage to evade their obligations to import. Such a development would, of course, be absolutely disastrous to the normal economic life of the country, but at the time he had found no means of definitely guarding against it. He had now found himself confronted with this danger, and he had little doubt that the Soviet authorities were seeking to place him in the unpleasant dilemma of having to choose between a shortage of imports, with all the odium that would attach to the Government, and accepting financial responsibility tor them which would strengthen the economic and political position of the Soviets. 5 He had told the Soviet representatives precisely what he thought ot their barefaced attempt to have it both ways and had then arranged the meeting men tioned in my above-quoted despatch. At that meeting, after the Persian mere mn s had out forward their grievances, he had summarised them and then proposed, as subsequently published in the “ Iran,” that if the Soviet Government were Genuinely short of funds in Persia and were really under the impression that Persian buyers were not in a position to effect payments the I ersian Government would purchase all Russian imports and deposit all sums as they became due in a bank the fund thus formed being available for Sovietic purchases in this country. Teymourtache went on to tell me that though of course such a proposal which would deprive the Soviet organisations of contacts to which they attached importance from propaganda even more than from the economic vmw ^ould hardly be welcomed, none the less there was no shadow of doubt in his mind that, subject perhaps to reference to higher authority, the Soviet ie l l) | 1 ! l e ^ tative had accepted it. The subsequent categorical denial justified the la &gt;el ot “ the world’s most shameless liars.' n ■ a- ^ 6 I asked whether it was true that the Soviets were freely oflering- discounts of 50 per cent, if payments were effected in foreign currency, and whether this was the reason why, as I understood was the case, the Soviets were experiencing [607 bb— 1 ] EMLCdtfC WEEKI.V I ettfk *510 m. 1952 HWM secretary, political and DEPT. In&amp;IA OFFKiE2 difficulty in paying for their purchases of Persian produce. Teymourtache replied that there had been a number of cases in which such discounts had been given for payments in foreign balances held abroad and this was part of the reason why the Soviet Government were short of funds in Persia; he had obtained a definite undertaking that the practice would be discontinued. He went on to explain, as a further reason for the shortage, that Persian customs statistics made it absolutely certain that the Soviet trade organisations had exported considerably more than they had imported; indeed, very considerably more than was shown by the export certificates which they had obtained. I asked how this could possibly be the case, and the reply was that it was due to administrative incompetence; Persia was, indeed, bad in this respect, but her inefficiency was nothing compared to that of the Soviets. As an instance, perhaps, of their inefficiency, Teymourtache went on to say that in respect of the sugar monopoly he had completely got the better ( (i roule ') of them. A reference to paragraph 2 of my despatch No. 279 of the 15th June shows that there may well be some truth in this claim. Subsequent enquiries have not confirmed the statement of Teymourtache to the effect that the Soviet exports from Persia have exceeded their imports. 7. Teymourtache's opening remarks furnish an interesting commentary on the rumours which are still circulating, that he is on the eve of disappearing either to Paris in partial disgrace or into the limbo of final disfavour. 8 . As I took my leave of him he said that if only he could lay hands on £5 or £6 million he would put the Soviets in their place. I was inclined to think that at the back of his mind was the idea that a British loan to this amount would be a suitable price for Hen jam and Bahrein, but there was nothing in what he said to give body to this impression. 1 have, &amp;c.
