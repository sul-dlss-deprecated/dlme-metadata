How that I had arrived I hoped that my stay would be a long one. The mention of Spain led His Imperial Majesty to observe that here I should find a country full of interest and activity, and entirely peaceful. To this I replied that, as he already knew, it was the sincere desire of His Majesty's Government to see Iran strong and peaceful. 2.

I have embodied in my telegram referred to above the reply whieh the shah requested me to convey to Hi© Majesty. The Shah also told me that he was causing a message on similar lines to be delivered to IShe King through the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs. I at the same time presented Sir Km Hoar ©*b Letters of Recall. able to have with His Imperial Majesty consisted mainly or generalities. I thanked him for the courtesy shown to me at the frontier and on my arrival and expressed interest in the journey and admiration for ttie work which is being done in improving the capital. I also said that I had been greatly impressed with the variety and quality of the Persian products on view in the industrial exhibition recently opened in Tehran by the Shah. His Majesty, who had by then somewhat relaxed from his initial stiffness of demeanour, announced that the Exhibition was a permanent institution and that the exhibits would be renewed from time to time, *especially the fish*. 3 # I was able to give His Majesty an opening to The few minutes of conversation which /say The Bight Honourable Sir John Simon, Q.C.3.X., eta., etc., etc., The Foreign Office2 U say something about the relations between the two countries. He assured me of the friendly feelings which he entertained for Great Britain. I replied that the friendship of Great Britain for Persia had frequently been expressed in the past and that I was convinced that the mutual friendship of our two countries was essential to both. His Majesty reciprocate* this sentiment and I said I should remember what he said. That sentiment would form the basis of my work here * there would be inevitable difficulties# but I should be perfectly frank and not hesitate to say at once when any question was raised on which I could not meet the Persian point of view, however much the Persian Government and I tkyseif might regret it. Hie Majesty seemed to appreciate this statement and I followed it up by expressing the hope that I might feel that 1 should from time to time be allowed to come and talk matters over with Hi© Majesty. To this the £hsh replied M X am always here”, an answer which* though perhaps not warmly encouraging# may be worth bearing in mind* 4 . x then presented the Staff of Hie Majesty’s Legation and a few more minutes conversation took place, ending with a loud burst of laughter on the part of His Imperial Majesty# who then withdrew.
