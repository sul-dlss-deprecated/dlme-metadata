It has a few tufts of grass and swarms with birds, being covered in the season with their eggs and young. There is a deposit of guano a few inches deep over surface of island. KASR (UMM) —Plaee with a Turkishfortified post, hut no other houses, on west bank of a creek of same name, which joins Khor-as-Sabiyah opposite Warba Island. Umm Kasr is 10 miles south-east of Safwan and 25 to 30 miles south east half south of Zobeir. There are no wells on the direct road between Zoheir and Umm Kasr and caravans prefer the western road by Jebel Sanam and Safwan, where they are plentiful. Except in caso of rain coupled with a strong south wind the tidal flow docs not generally affect the marshes much bevond Umm Kasr. The fort is a small rectangular enclosure for 41) men with loop* holed mud wall and banquette inside. It is J of a mile from the creek and 7 miles by the creek from Warba Island. Close by is an old ruined fort. Umm Kasr is a general watering place for Arabs of the desert. Iribal quarrels at the well are frequent and often lead to bloodshed. The family of the Sheikhs of Koweit were originally pirates with their head-quarters here, and the present Sheikh of Koweit claims the ownership. There is a good water-supply and grazing for sheep but not for horses, KASR (KHOR UMM).—So styled by Kemp in his recent suryey, is an inlet leading from the junction of the Khars (?) Abdullah and As-Sabiyah, at the west end of Warba Island, for about 6 miles in an average north-west direction. Opposite the Umm Kasr fort it divides into two branches—one continuing north-west, the other running north towards Zobeir. The sound ings between Warba Island and this point of divergence range from six to nine fathoms and the average breadth of this section of the inlet is about ^ of a mile. The north-west branch opposite Umm Kasr fort is, at low water, nothing but a mud-flat with a shallow channel not more than 3 or 4 feet deep on the west side ; while at high tide there is a wide expanse of water to the east as far as tlie eye can reach and this extends inland, following a natural depression of the ground, for some miles to the north-west. KAT3AMA (DUHAT and HAS).—The innermost cove of Koweit Bay, between Ras Asheirij and Eas Kathama. The south side of it lias a west, south-west direction for 5 miles from the former point; the cove shoals gradually from the entrance, which is 4 miles broad, towards the head at whic^ Jahara village is situated. Has Kathama is a low swampy point, only just above hi^li water, running out some three furlongs from the northern shore of the bay ^it is protected partially by a naturally formed bank of sand along the high water line. It is believed that the Germans wished to acquire here a plot ^of land about 20 square miles m extent, as a terminus for the Baghdad railway. See also under Koweit Bay. KIIUTEI or KIIATER —Second stage from I^oweit on (? toast) route to Basra. Distance about 15 miles from Jahara. KOWEIT.—Principality. (1) Boundaries are somewhat indeterminate except on east, where formed by Persian Gulf. Sheikh claims Safwan on north and llafr oa west and Bombay Records (probably on authority of Brucks 1825) state that his authority extends as far south as Khor KhufiTa^ee (? Khafji). Palgrave in 1863 carried the Koweit boundary in his map al o«t *0 miles south, 30 miles west and 60 miles north of the town. Pellv in 1865 considered the country within a radius of 8 or 10 miles only to belong to Sheikh of Koweit; at another lime he placed the south boundary at Malah, about 15 miles south-south-east of Koweit. In the present precis, all places north of Ras Mishaab and south of Koweit have been provisionally included in the Koweit sub-section; also all places on the west and north as far as Ilafr and Safwan res pectively. (2) Names of districts are not known, unless, following Pclly Ad an in which Koweit town stands, Shug to the south of it, and Debeneh which possi bly includes loth the others (3) The physical geography of various portions is described under lailaka, Bubiyan, etc. To begin from the north there is a desert south of Salphoon (? Safwan) with pebbles and iun -le-erass alternating, and here and there shallow beds of nullahs. Towards the Khor- as-Sabiya the mainland is a sandy waste impregnated with salt, with here a id there a few tufts of brushwood. At 9 hours south by west of Salphoon59 sarulstone begins to crap out and continues for two bouri!. From a point 5 hours north of Jabara begin undulating plains covered, in spring, with grass and flowers. These continue for 4 hours when the sandstone ridge of Aghthi is readied and passed through, 3 miles from Jahara. To tlie soutli and west of Jahara is undulating country covered, in spring, with grass and flowers, but without water. The shepherds of that region have water sent to them on camels. Between Jahara and Koweit is a low, flat, salt plain, here and there slightly- raised, with sa id and a little grass. General character of country is horizon- bounded prairie, undulating like long, low waves. South and west'of Malah are boundless, slightl.v undulatiog plains with flowers and grass just sufficient in spring to give a glow of green. The Delaa-el-Chebreet and i)elaa-ed-Delaa (q.v.) ave features of this part of the district; se« also articles on Khor Karein and Shug. For 30 miles south of Koweit coast is a st my, brown- coloured desert, rising gradually to a height of 200 or £00 feet at a'few miles inland. For 1 hour east of Koweit on route to Malah. is scant grass; and thereafter, for 4i hours to south-south-east, plains sprinkled with low brush wood. Generally the country is arid and barren, but there is some cultivation in neighbourhood of forts, (i) Climate of Koweit town is separately dealt with. Kegarding remainder no information except that great cold sometimes prevails in tract n';rth of bay of Kovveit. In the winter of 1862-G3 in the neighbourhood of Salphoon (? Safwan) nearly all the sheep died of cold and on 2nd March 1863, at the same place, Colonel Pelly's water-skins wera frozen. (5) Such information as is available regarding routes will be found in the following authorities quoted at the beginning of this sub-section, viz No. 7, pages 117—119; No. 9, pages 16—22, and Appendices IV, VI and VII * No. 18, pa^es 25—23 and Appendix A. Cassim Izeddingives the caravan distances from Koweit as 15 days to Hail, 12 days to Aneyza and 8 days to Hasa. Felly makes it 8 days to Katif, 10 to Hasa, Ojair or Zalfah in Nejd, 12 to Kaseem in Nejd, 13 to Jebel Shammar, 18 to Hazui-er-ilaji and 26 to Mecca, rate bein*- 8 hours a day on camel-back. (6) (a) Products are nil (?). {b)—{d) Trade is most ly of a through character, and is therefore dealt with under Koweit town (e) The only commercial centre is Kowcit town, {f) The currency is cosmopolitan Tne Mam Theresa dollar or rial (=Rs. 1-8-0) may be considered the standard, but Indian rupees, Persian krans and Turkish copper coins circu late, and even English sovereigns are found. It is said bills can be obtained on Basra, Bushire, Bombay and even the capital of Nejd. (7) {g) (^). There is no estimate of the population of the principality except Kemball's (1903) of 20,000 people in Koweit town and 30.000 Bedouins owning allegiance The inhabitants of Koweit town are believed to be mainly Uttoobees and those of the country to the south mostly A1 Ali (a branch of the Beni Khalid) Forty families of Ejman are found at Shiaiba. There are also wandering parties of other tribes, including the Montiiik. Coast population live on dry tisu and a tew dates; inland people on dates, corn and camels' milk- in Bedouin encampments both families and horses sometimes subsist exclusively on camels milk. Both Bedouins and townspeople store locusts l eople smoke Persian mrgeilah with tobacoi of Lar from Lin^a, or Turkish* chebook with tobacco brought by the Tigris from Mosul o? via Mocha iioin lemen. In the desert the Arab sabeel is generally smoked (8) The Gov ernment is patriarchal. The Sheikh exercises political and the Kazi indicia! functious. Punishment is rarely inflicted and there is little interference with the liberty of the subject. No tribute is exacted from the tribes and except for small offerings at the gate, or from merchants, there is no svstem of customs, and trade is entirely free. Stocqueler (1832) differing from other authorities mentions an import duty of 2 per cent. Pelly (1863) estimated the Sheikh s receip.s to amount to Es. 20,000. Koweit flies the Turkish flao- but the meaning of this is disputed ; and the Sheikh denies having ever paid tribute to lurkey. The fighting force at the disposal of the Sheikh consists of 6 000 men m Koweit town and doubtful number from among the Bedouins Do'wd mg describes their organisation, armament and efficiency in his report. The Turks regard koweit as a Kaimmakamlik of the Basra Mutasarriflik. KOWEIT.---Town. (1) Capital of the Koweit principality, having its north end situated in lat. 29° 22' 56' north and long. 47° 59' 51'' east, about■: ; ■ ■ t ■ ■ ■60 80 miles south and slightly east of Basra, almost 180 miles west by north of Bushahr and nearly 2b0 miles north-north-west of Bahreio. (2) Town stands on loose sandstone covered with sand on southern shore of Koweit Bay, about $ of the way from its entrance at Ras-al-Arz to its head at Jabara, and faces north-west. Greatest length is about 1 mile from north-east to south-west and breadth is between J and ^ a mile. Inland a desert of white sand stretches away from the very walls: town and surroundings are almost destitute of verdure and cultivation, but there are a few date-trees. There are some stone houses, but most are of sundried brick. They are occasionally faced with coarse chunam, but exteriors are bare and uniform ; usual design is a central courtyard surrounded by chambers looking into it, with flat roofs. Streets are wider than at Maskat or Bushalir and some have a gutter down the middle; Pelly described the place as clean and active with a broad and open main bazaar, Cassim Izeddin (1897) considered the streets narrow, but not very dirty; he com mented, however on, the absence of latrines except in the houses of notables and on the abuse of the sea-beach and plain behind the town and even of roofs anil streets. There is a large suburb of mat huts outside town-wall on south side, near main gate ; this is point of arrival and departure of up-country caravans' and quarter chiefly frequented by Bedouins who do most of their trade here. Shoal water extends ahout 8 cables off the town, and the beach dries out to a coti- aiderable distance, but at high water the sea washes up to the houses ; the native boats are hauled up on the beach, inside substantial breakwaters of loose stone which form tidal harbours. Landing at low tide is inconvenient. Town is said to contain about 3,000 houses, 600 shops, 3 caravanserais, 6 cofTce-bouses, ^ schools and 4 mosques, as well as numerous warehouses and stores. About 30 new houses are built and 40 uew shops opened every year (1902). Climate distinctly good as compared with many- ports in Persian Gulf. In December and January it is bracing in mornings and evenings and never unpleasantly hoL In not months north-west wind is tempered by blowing across bav» Fever practically unknown and dysentery and ophthalmia rare. Nights arc^aid to be cool in the hot weather. (3) In 1S32 town was defended oil side next desert by wall not one foot thick, having 3 gates, each protected bv 2 honev- combed guns. In 1902 town was surrounded by low wall with towers which however were not m a good condiiion for defence. About 1 mile outside town is line of sandhills and broken ground which could be made strong enouch to resist any probable attack. (4) Population appears to be regularl /and rapidly J c C J&lt;f a5 l 1Dg ^ 839 or earli01, &amp; was estimated at (5,000 ; m 1SV) at 8 000 • in. 1897 at 3a0(J0 (CassfmlzeddinL ^lOO? 10 OoHo 12 000 ( ?M W Tr g ■ • 0m ? r 0 '' ever (,900) mal&lt;es population tmlv 10,000 to 12,000.

There is also an active coasting trade; much of Gulf carrying trade centres in Koweit and61 there are always many Kovveit boats moving between Koweit and Basra whence dates are brought. Kovveit sailing vessels run as far as Bombay and Il'd Sea; one or two of these are said to be lost in the Indian Ocean every year. All carry dates and bring rice, cloth, wood, etc., from India, rice and cloth from Maskat, and coffee from Red Sea. In lLi39 there was also an import of tobacco and dried fruits from Persia ; of grain and dates from Basra ; of cloth, dates and tish from Bahrein ; of spices and sugar from India ; does the trade in these articles still continue? Irom Bombay to Koweit takes days uith a favourable wind. There is an extensive boat-building yard at Kovveit. More baghlas belong to this port than to any other in the Gulf. The trading fleet lias been variously estimated, e.y., in 1^29 at 100 sail of vessels large and small ; in 1839 at 150 trading boats of 15 to IcO tons and 15 big baghlas of 150 to 400 tons; in 18'0 at V00 trading baghlas; in 1808 at 130 vessels of 20 to 800 tons. Doweling says that there are vessels of as much as 1,000 tons running to Bombay and Mesopotamia. Gulf Pilot (1898) says Koweit sends40 boats topearl-tishpry and these do not go south of Abu Ali. Dowding (1903) states the pearl-fishing: fleet at 600 boats with crews of 15 to 40 men each. Pelly in 1863 estimated the imports from India at 2 lakhs of rupees (chiefly long-cloth, rice, coffee, planks, spices, etc.) and exports at l^s. 3,80,000, viz., 800 horses, Hs, 2,40,000 ; wool, Bs. 40,000 ; dates, Bs. 60,000 ; and miscellaneous, lis. 40,000. At an earlier period the total imports were estimated at 5 lakhs of dollars and the total exports at less than 1 lakh. (7) Local resources are small. 'Ihe harbo 'Jr yields an abundance of excellent fish, including soles. Onions are the only (?) vege table grown, and water melons the only (?) fruit. Only agricultural resources are at Jahara where a small amount of cereals and green fo Ider and dates is raised. During winter there is sparse grazing for goats on plain near Koweit ; but best pastures, much frequented by Bedouins, are those round Jahara, Kathama Bay and thence along north shore between Aghthi and water's edge. Barley and wheat are (or used to be) brought from Basra and Indii, rice from Mangalore, dal from Basra and Bushire. Cattle, sheep, poultry, milk, butter, truffles and fuel are obtainable, supplied by the local Bedouins. Stone and chunam are plentiful, the latter cheap and good. Plenty of teak plank obtained from Bombay for boat-building, used to bo available ; also a hard wood (what?) from Maskat for knees and timbers. There is abundance of dates from the Shatt-al-Arab. Ilorse forage comes in part down Khor-as-Sabiya from Bander Zobeir. Water is brackish. The best in 18G3 came from wells ^ a mile south of the (own ; now it apparently comes from a place 2 miles distant. (8) (9) (10) Government has already been dealt with under Koweit principality. It may be noted that Bedouins are not allowed to enter the toa r ti armed, [' Koweit ' appears to be an Arabic diminutive of the non-Arabia word ' Kot a fortitied place. The older name, spelt Grain, Grane or Graine, w r as probably taken from the adjacent islet of ' Kurein ' (little horn). Pelly says that this namo was applied rather to the shore-line of the whole bay than to the town.] KG WEIL 1 BAY.—Large inlet of remarkable form leading out of the ex treme north west corner of the Persian Gulf, on the southern shore of which stands the town of Koweit. Its extreme length east and west is over 20 miles, and breadth north and south 10 mile?. Its shape approaches a crescent with the convex side to the north and one of the horns pointing south-west. The Bay proper is an indentation in the true Arabian coast line re presented on the north by the western bank of the Khor-as-Sabiya and on tho south by the coast south of llas-al-Arz ; but its shore line is artificially prolonged on the side towards the Shatt-al-Arab by a mud- flat extending 20 miles south-east from the mouth of Khor-as-Sabiya, on which stands the island of Failaka. The entrance to the bay between this mud-flat and llas-al-Arz is about 4 miles wide and open to' the south-west and south-south-west. In the southern shore of the bay are 3 minor coves ; the easternmost cove between Ras-al-Arz and Bas-al-Ajuza is shallow, and vessels are recommended not to enter it; the middle cove, between Eas-al-Ajuza and Has Asheivij contains Koweit town on its eastern shore, a large mud-flat known as A1 Akkaz in the centre, the islet of Kurein at the south east corner of A1 Akkaz, and the island of Umm-an-Namil near Has Asheirij ; the westernmost cove (Duhat Kathama) between Eas Asheirij and Has Kathama forms the head of the whole bay and contains the village of Jahara. In most C912ED Q62 parts of the bay is water of ground. Soundings are ^ ® t entrarlce of Dull at Kathama.

Irom this point a track runs south-west to Zulfah in Nejd. MADERA.— Third stage oa (? coast) route from Koweit to Basra, about 48 miles from Koweit. MALAH.—Eort 5 hours south -south-east of Koweit, first stage on route to Eiadh and Tioint at which track ends. Around fort are some wells, a little cultivation and a few temporary huts. Pelly considered this the south boun dary of Koweit territory in 1865. MARADIM (UMM AL).—Low, sandy islet, 25 miles south by east of Jezirat Kubbar, under i a mile in diameter, covered with brushwood, but dis- titute of water. MASHKAN.—Low, sandy islet lying on the Tharub mud-flat between Failaka and the mouth of the Kbor-as-Sabiya, 2 miles north.viest of Eailaka.

REDAIE.—Name of a few remarkable sandhills forming a landmark on the route from Koweit to Riadh, between the Shug and Wuriya districts. RUMMAH (WADI-EK).—Valley in which Hafr is situated. See Section III, Sub-section B. SAB HA.—See Sabria. SABIYA (KASR).—Uninhabited square enclosure belonging to Sheikh of Koweit, situated on west bank of Khor -as-Sabiya near its mouth. Oppo site Kasr Sabiya direction of Khor is due north and south and width about miles.■63 SABIYA (KHOR-AS) —Called also K-l.or Bubiyan. A remarkable salt water inlet running from the north-east corner of Koweil Bay to ^ arba Island, in the neighbourhood of which it moets Kbor Abdnllah from the enst andKl oi Lmm Kasr from the north-west, and separating Bubiyan Island from the mam. Its length is over 30 miles, average direction north -north-west-and south-sonth- eist and average breadfh about 1 mile (one authority says ^ a mile). Out side the mouth navigation is difficult o^ing to a number of knolls almost drv, and native bo:»ts can enter only at lialP flood. The b&lt;tnlvs aie swampy , but there are a good many boulders, especially along oast shove. Most con venient landing place is on we&gt;t bank, about | of the distance fiom the south end. According to Felly (1863) the depth in the middle is nowhere less than 5 fathoms, but the latest chart shows soundings of 4, 3 and even 2. Pelly men tions a branch about 40 feet wide, thrown oil by the Khor SaMya at its head in a direction north J west; he tracked up this branch for 5 miles and entered a larger Khor, 250 yards wide, whieh opened into the Khor Abdullah ( ? Khor Umm Ivasr). Is this branch the ' boat-channel marked in Kemp s recent survey, between west of Warba Island and the main ? SABRIA —Or Sabha.

SALPIIOON —Plaee about 10 mi 1 es south by west of Zobeir and about 17 ho irs from .lahara on route from Pasra to Koweit. In 1S63 it consisted of 3 square enclosures or forts, each containing a large well. AA ater was bitter, but drinkable. Garlic, lucerne and grass were grown by irrigation from wells, but wheat and barley were notpnduce l. No barley or straw was obtainable for horses, nor breid for men, and but little brushwood for fuel. One hour's distance to west is hill of Isphuan This appears to be same as Safwan above ; both are on direct route between Basra and Koweit, but whereas Colvill places S ilphoon about 16 miles south of Zobeir and about 50 miles north of Jahara, Dowding puts Safwan 29 miles south of Zobeir and 41 nonh of Jaliara. Dowding notes however that individual riders can cover the distance between Zobeir and Safwan in 4 hours. SANAM (.TEBEL).—Mentioned by Zwemer ns lying west of route between Koweit and Basra. Dowding shows it in his map about 45 miles north and slightly east of Jahara. Can this be identical with Colvill's Isphuan ? SliLAIB —Tribe, so called in Syria and appnrently on east side of Arabia ; in Central Arabia they are spoken of as Sulaba (singular, Sulabi,. West of Hail they are generally called Khlua (singular, Khelui), i e., 'Solitaries' or contemptuously Kilab el-Khala, 44 dogs of the desert.' (1) No reli able account of their origin seems to be extant. They have a tradition that their patriarch forbade them-to keep cattle, and ordered them to subsist by the chase. They arc not, apparently, Arabs. (2) No information as to their sub-divisions, except that there is said to be one, called Ghuneymy in East ern Arabia, that will not intermarry with the others. (3) There is no estimate of their numbers, 'ihey are found in Nejd, Irak, etc., and in the neighbour hood of Koweit; they extend from Svria to Yemen and, as among the Bedouins, the various sections have their own fixed localiries. (&lt;*) They are peicelul and markedly hospitable and seem more intelligent than the Arabs. They have a more European than Asiatic cast of countenance, and according to Palgrave those in Central Arabia by 'tlnir fair complexion and open,6 -1 sometimes handsome, features and light eyes show the Syrian rather than the Arabian type ; while their careless gaiety of manner strongly contrasts with the cloudy and suspicious physiognomy of the wanderers among whom they live. M Doughty remarks on the full faced beauty of then children. Felly says the women have the finest features of any wandering tribe; but are dirty to 9 proverb. In character they are tolerant and humane, being themselves despised and oppressed ; Bedouins will not drmk out of a vessel after a Selaibi. The term Selaib is burled as a reproach at other inferior tribes of Central Arabia, such as the Ueteym, Sherarat and Sunna ; yet a weak ly Bedouin child is sometimes name '* Sulabi' or Khelui, for luck, m the hope that it may grow up. Their women beg at Bedouin tents, though probab y better fed than the Bedouins. (6) In some cases they conform outwardly to Muhammadanism, but among themselves they have their own religious observances. They believe in one God and respect Muhammad as a man, but deny his mission. They believe also in some anonymous heavenly personages styled the 'confidential friends of God. ^ They pray 3 times daily; 'once as the sun rises, so as to finish ere the disc is, full on the horizon; secondlv, before the sun dips from the meridian ; and thirdly, so as to finish with the setting of the sun. The Selaib of Irak are said to have a purer worship and to have preserved certain sacred wiitmgs in Assvrian or Chaldaean, including the Psalms of David and some cf the Jewish Prophets. The Selaib fast 3 times a year ; 30 days in Ram7,an, 4 to 7 days in Shaban, and from 6 to 9 days in one of the summer months. The belaib adore the Pole Star (which they call -Tab) and reverence it by facing it and spreading out their arms so as to form a cross. They also adore a star called Jedy in the constellation Aries. They respect Mecca, but consider their own proper place of pilgrimage to be Haran, in Irak oi Mesopotamia. ^ ihe Selaib of the desert seem to have conformed to the ceremonies of the dominant religion, until from generation to generation they have lost their own. They declare they were originally Sabaeans, but Pelly considers this erroneous. PaWave says they have a strong, unchanging hatred of Muhammadanism. Doughtv, however, represents them as Muhammadans, know ing no other religion; perhaps this holds of the Sulaba of Nejd. (6) ihe Selaib will eat any thing, including sheep and camels that have died a natural death ; but their diet is mainly dates and locusts, with the milk and butter afforded by their numer ous herds and flocks. Any surplus they sell on the seaboard, wheie they pitch for about 4 months of the year, wandering about for the remaining^ 8 months and tending their sheep and camels. Their tents are of black goats'hair, and so handy as to be readily transported. Ihey eat the flesh of the gazelle, w hich they shoot, and wear a long shirt of its skin coming down to their feet. Doughty says, they work for the Bedouins while they can get milk from them and in summer go off to the desert and live by hunting. Their hunters drink 2 hours before dawn and not again till noon, (7) They hunt the gazelle, and in Central Arabia the ostrich; and are reported excellent marksmen and unrivalled in the pursuit of both. In land craft they are as superior to the Bedouins as the Bedouins to the fixed population of the oases. They act as drudges and guides of the Arabs. They are the safest guides and best water-finders in the desert. Tney come in at Koweit on white donkeys, riding cross-legged on a peculiar saddle and without a bridle ; they bring for sale at tie town much the same things as the Arab Bedouins. Their donkeys are famous, and with them they go hunting, and make desert journeys which are diificult even for Bedoums on dromedaries. According to Palgrave, the Selaib are cre dited by the Arabs with the performance of difficult surgical operations. They are tinkers and tin the brass kettles and pots of the Bedouins, whose arms they also mend. They make hatchets, sickles and flint steels, but their work is ruder than that of the Sunna (Section HI, Sub section A). They work also in wood and construct camel saddles of desert acacia, well pulleys and milk vessels. They are farriers and cattle surgeons to the Bedouins. (A few in the direction of Mesopotamia are said to keep cattle of their own ) The Sulaba also take away the vessels of townspeople at Kheybar, etc , to be tinned or mended and return with them after a time; what money they make they aie said to bury in the desert. (8) Language is Arabic (?). (9) Forty days after the birth of a child it is immersed 7 times in water, and a male child must be cir cumcised before it is 7 years old. At a circumcision some sheep are killed and65 all are welcome to the feast. The marriage ceremony is simple and is performed in the presence of the respective fathers, or nearest of kin, of bride and bride groom. Voluntary consent of the parties is necessary, also the permission of the lather. The girl's father receives a certain payment. A mulla or greybeard then asks the parties if they consent to the union, receives a fee and sends them off to cohabit. There seem to be no particular burial ceremonies. Like the Muhammadans they wash their dead, cover the corpse with a white shroud and inter it with a prayer. Afterwards they kill a sheep and distribute its flesh among the poor. When a shroud is not procurable the Selaib is buried in a new deerskin frock. The characteristic feature of certain festivals of the Selaib, especially of circumcisions or weddings, is the planting of a wooden cross, draped with red cloth and topped with feathers, at the door of the tent where the ceremony takes place. This serves as general invitation to neigh bours to collect and dance round the cross. From this apparently is derived their name (Saleeb=cross). They have a peculiar dance in which the man lightly kisses his female partner on the shoulder, but may not touch her waist or hand. (10) (11) (12) The political position of the Selaib appears to he one of semi-subordination to the Arabs. They wander among the Arabs and are friends with all tribes yet remain entirely distinct. The Arabs never intermarry with them. They take no part in Arab feuds, etc., and the tribes disdain to plunder them ;Bedouins, says Doughty, would not. even rob a soli tary Sulabi of a valuable ostrich skin. They are too useful as guides and menials to be injured. They pay no tribute (.^o Pelly says but Doughty says they pay a small tribute wherever they go) and the tribes* scorn to borrow from them. The Selaib have a patron in every considerable tribe, to whom thev appeal in case of necessity and the difficulty is then disposed of by mediation. They themselves never plunder. In camp they pitch apart from the Arabi. SELOO.—Two marches from Koweit on one of the routes to Katif. SIIAAYBAT.—First stage on one route from Koweit to Hasa. S11ETNA (KIIOR).—A somewhat confused description of this Khor ^ill bo found at page 578 of Bombay Records, Selection XXIV ; and the name Khor Shetana also occurs in the Admiralty Chart of the Mouth of the Euphrates, but so placed as not to afford any assistance. It is described as a branch of Khor Abdullah ' formed by 'Warba Island and the main, which continues navigable for large boats above Bussorah. ,, In Admiralty Chart No. 2374-2S37&amp;, Persian Gulf (1903), a semi-conjectural Khor somewhat corresponding to the above description is shown ; but the still later survey of the Khors Abdullah and Umm Kasr by Kemp seems to show that no such Khor exists. What then is Khor Shctna P Is it merely the northern channel bet ween Warba Island and the main; or is it identical \mh Khor Umm Kasr or Khor Zobeir? In 1903 the Vice-Consul, Basra, found a Khor some what corresponding with the semi-conjectural one mentioned above. SHIAIBA.—Small square fort on the Koweit coast, c-J miles south of Abu Ilalaifa. Inhabited by 40 families of Ejman tribe. Beach is sandy, but land ing at low water is did)cult. In 1898 there was a young date -plantation and some water in wells; the people were herdsmen and cultivators. SHUG.—District immediately south of that called Adan by people of Koweit. It appears to be enclosed between southern part of the parallel ranges shown in Felly's map as beginning from the Delaa-ed-Delaa and Delaa-el Cheb- reet hills and running west and then north. The surface rises gently from the sea. SHUWAIK (BANDAPt).—See under Kurein. SULABA.—See Selaib. THAKUB.—The great mud-flat on which Failaka Island and the islet of Mashkan stand.

Around it meet the Khor Abdullah from the south-east, Khor-as Sabiya from the south, and Khor Umm Kasr from the north-west. The is 1 a«.d is 8 miles long east and west and shaped like a orescent with its concavity to the south. Its greatest breadth is over 2 miles. Depth of channel between it and mainland on north is 4 to 6 fathoms. Channel between it and mainland on west is described as a &lt;e boat-passage.' Ko information as to southern channel separating it from Bubiyan Island, except in Admiralty Chart No. 2374-2837-6, which indicates soundings of 4 to 10 fathoms. WARFRA or WUBREH.—Locality between the Karain Khor and the Delaa-ed-Delaa. Pelly calls it indifferently Warfra and Wubreh.l ' Map of Parts of Arabia and Persia ' gives Wabrah. Pelly says this halting place is quite uninhabited and derives its name from the lands of Wubreh which lie a little to the eastward. WUBREH.—-See Warfra above. ZOWAR,—See under Failaka Island. 6. C. Prw, Simla, --No, C-012 T d.— 17-11-34—3a, -J . D.49 700 feet liigh. In another place Palgrave calls this peak Moscharrif. Average elevation of range may be 200 to 300 feet. It is not clear whether long isolated rid&lt;?e north east of Hasa, mentioned by Palgrave, is part of this system. The isolated ridge in question is of basalt and sandstone, about 400 feet high ; it is pierced by natural caverns, which give it its name Moghor, and re orted to by the inhabitants of Hasa for relaxation. Is this ridge the same as Garah above ? MOGHAZI (JEBEL).—Translated by Palgrave as ' mountain of mili tary expeditions ' which ne explains by referring to the defeat of the Muslims by the Carmathians in this neighbourhood about 287 A. H. Palgrave says it extends for at least 100 mile* north of Hofhuf as far as Wab ; he makes the general elevation about 1,400 feet above the sea and 400 above the desert adjoining on the west, highest part being opposite Juniah. According to same authority the mountains of Hasa (Mogharat as well as Moghazi) contain here and there limestone, but main components are granite and sandstone with occasional quartz and granite. Their sides are often eaten out into caverns and whole look is fanciful and desolate. MOGHOE.—See Mogharat, MOHANNA.—Place where refugee Amayir from Katif landed in 1879.

Near Mubarraz is a salt lake rendering some acres of ground barren ; and 100 yards north of town is a hot spring forming a pond. In 1862 ptincipal object in the town w^as a large and not inelegant mosque erected by the Wahabis. (3) There was as late as l t '62 a detached fort to the west of the town (surrounded in 1819 and 1841 by a dry ditch) but it is not mentioned by Douglas (1896). The town was described in 1819 and lbt32 as unwalled, in 1865 as ruinous, and in 1896 as walled. (4) Sadlier estimated population at 10,000 with fighting strength of 400, Palgrave at nearly 20,000. (5) Douglas notes that the population is entirely Arab. (6) According to Palgrave the inhabitants represent more of the landed and less of the commercial interest than those of Ilofhuf. Douglas says the obbas for which the district is famous are manufac tured here. Weekly fair in 1S62 was held on Mondays, (7) (9) (10) Is head quarters of Mudirlik of same name. MUGHRIS.

(2) Its length is 7 miles north-west and south-east and breadth :} miles at west end. Its shape is that of a badly- shaped wedge with base to the north-west and point to the south-east. (3) It stands on an extensive flat of mud and sand with rocky patches, which extends south-east from the mouth of Khor-as-Sabiya. Island is very low, and at high spring tides is broken in upon by the sea and must be a veritable swamp in rainy season. Not visible more than 6 or 8 miles, so that it is not often seen when entering harbour. It has two outliers viz., Uha, small sandy islet on the reef, about 3 miles from its south-east extremity, and Mashkan, a low sandy islet on the great Tharub mud flat, 2 miles from Eailaka towards north-west.

(6) Mostly Joasmis, Al Abu Alis and Shihiyyin ; some Sunnis, others Wahabis; with 70 British subjects, Khojas and Hindus. Zwemer says it is still a Wahabi centre and that tobacco has to be sold secretly. (6) Sends &lt;i50 boats to pearl fishery. Several baghalas belong to this port and fine bakaras and batils are built. In Palgrave's time it was principal port of west Oman, resembling Linga as an entrepot, and unrivalled on its own coast between Bidaa and Dibba. In 1863 it was principal mart on Pirate Coast for camels, donkeys and slaves; there were weavers who made light red cloaks, robes, carpets and curtains, also gold and silver-smiths. Shops were neat and well-built and there was general air of solidity and wealth. At south end of town was market place divided into Suks; in centre Kaisariah (long and lofty vaulted building); at north end weavers. (7)—(10), SHARGA. —District (1)—(4) (6). There is route from Sharga to Bereymi in interior, distance 86 hours, see Bombay Records, XXIV, 1856; also one from Sharka to Khadhrawain in Batina (Ross's Map of Oman). Uncertain to what distance these lie in Sharga territory. (6)—(8). SHARGA.—Principality. Consists of 3 districts, vie., Sharga Proper, Ras al Khaima, and Sharki, For particulars see articles on these districts. 912FD D14 agARKI—Is this propel name to apply to district surrounding Fujaira ♦rihiitarv to Shares Chief ? South Dibba is apparently its most northern Tillage Mid Kalba its most southern ? Is it exactly co-extensive wub Shameiliya ? (2)- flOl In 1902 Joastni flag flew at Kalba, Khor Fakan and Qherefa and there was at each of these places a representatiTe of cousin of Chief of Sharga, who hflld villages in fief and levied what tribute he could in date season. Present revenue said to be $ 2.500 annually of which $ 1,500 from Dibba. SHAKKIY YIN.—Tribe in Fujaira and neighbourhood. One of their sections is Nakbiyyin. SHEM.— Little village on north side of Khor ash Shem, 4 miles within entrance, immediately under Shem Peak ; with wells of brackish water. Alter native settlement of inhabitants of I^.ana, SHEM (JEBEL).—Mountain, elevation 3,000', overlooking entrance of Khor ash Shem (Elphinstone Inlet) from north; has great precipice on south, east side. SHEM (KHOR-ASH).—Or Elphinstone Inlet. Extensive and wind ing inlet on west side of Oman promontory, running south at entrance and north-east within ; 8 miles long and in parts less than half a mile wide; overhung at its east end by Jebel Shem. Largest village in inlet is Sibi and best water is said to be found at Mada. Inlet is divided from Ghubbat Gbazira by Maklab isthmus, only J mile wide in places. Near Maklab is Tele graph Islet. Only danger in inlet is one sunken rock near Telegraph Islet. SHETAia (BENI). —Section of Shihiyyin mentioned by Cox at Lima. SHIHIYTIN —Or Shihus. Tribe. (1) Himyaritic and Hinawi. Miles regards them as distinct from the Arabs whom, he says, they avoid dealings with, as far as possible. (2) Ross divides them into Beni Hidiyah and Kumazireh. Cox regards the latter as not really Shihiyyin though now merged in them and mentions a section called Beni Shetair at Lima. What then are divisions of Shihiyyin proper ? Miles mentions a subtribe called Makadeheh. (3) They number 12,000 to 16,000 souls and inhabit practically whole Oman promontory north of line joining Dibba Bay to Rams on Pirate Coast, except the Malcolm and Elphinstone Inlets which are occupied by Zahooriveen. Lima, Kumzar and Khasab are their chief places; in first and last of the populatioa is fluctuating. They are also found on island of Larek. (4) Inoffensive, ignorant and super stitious. According to Wellsted they have no clothing but small loin-cloth and are not lighter in complexion than other Arabs. (6) Sunnis. According to Palgrave their villages have no mosques, but in some are cupolas fenced in and surrounded with a grove and styled ' mezar ' or ' saiyid/' (6) Mostly herds men and fishermen. Some subsist largely on shellfish. Their fishing hamlets are many of them moveable. Majority are extremely poor and accept pre sents of rice and dates with gratitude. They keep a few poultry, including ducks not seen in many places in Arabia, During date harvest numbers seek employment at Khasab and Dibba or in Batina. Some have date planta* tions of their own at the two former places. Wellsted says the majority live in caves and hollows, the rest in circular huts of loose stones about 4 feet high, or within walls built under overhanging rocks. (7) Fishing, goat- herding and date-harvesting ; Bombay Records XXIV add pearl-fishing. (8) Corrupt dialect of Arabic (?). Zwemer says it resembles Uimyaritic dialect of the Mahras. Miles says Shihiyyin of Kumzar and Larek speak a dialect unintelligi ble to the Arabs. (9) (10) (11) Practically unarmed. (1'2) Political position of bulk of tribe is uncertain. Those of Shuam, Ghaleelah, Khoweir and Rams are at present subject to Ras al Khaima. Remainder are regarded by Government of India as being independent.

It is said to be 15 miles from Odaid and one day's march from the Sabkheh. There are springs of sweet water at surface and acacia jungle. another account it is ^ a day from the sea. Limit of JDhafreh. SIR.—Or Julfar. Seepages 14 and 42 of Bombay Government Records XXIV, 1856. These names do not occur in modern correspondence. Do they mean lias al Khaima ? According to Niebuhr (Description de PArabie, p. 266) the whole Oman promontory north of a lino joining Khor Eakan and Sharga is called Sor or Julfar, the name Ser being Arabic and being derived from a place near Sharga which had a good port, and that of Julfar being Persian and taken from a cnpa called Ras Julfar. If those designations really exist they would supply a much needed general name for the promontory. SIR (ABU).—Island. Off north face of Oman promontory, miles west of Musandam.

TRUCIAL CHIEFS' TERRITORY.— (1) Extends from Shuam to Odaid alone south -east shores of Persian Gulf, distance of over 350 miles, of wbioh only 160 miles (Shaam to Abu Dhabi) can be called mhabited(?). This territory includes former Pirate Coast which began at Rams on north and extended to Dabai, though Dahai itself was hardly considered as a Pirate port. Boun dary is sea on west and north. Inland limits are undetermined. (2) Pol itical divisions are Sharga (including Ras al Khaima and Fuja ira districts as well as Sharga proper) ; Umm ul Kawain ; Hamriya ; Ajraan; Dabai; Abu Dhabi. Each of these divisions is dealt with under its own name. (8) Coast from Shuam to Ras al Khaima is low and nearly straight, with hign land in background ; and soundings off coast decrease from north south- wards. There are date palms at Shuam and a dense palmgrove extends from Rams to Ras al Khaima. The hills are miles from coast at Shuam, 6 miles distant at Ras al Khaima, and south of this the maritime plain widens very rapidly. From Ras al Khaima to Abu Dhabi coast is low and sandy throughout. The coast towns generally are very similar in appearance and consequently difficult to distinguish. There are many creeks, often com municating with each other inland and forming back-waters. Between Ras al Khaima and Umm ul Kawain shoal water and reefs extend about 2 miles from coast. There are date trees at Umra ul Kawain but none at Jezirat al Hamra, and no trees at all at Hamriya. The country from Ras al Khaima to Ajraan is not exactly sterile but neither is it well cultivated The tidal stream sets parallel to shore on this coast with a speed of 1 to 2 knots. The great Pearl Bank begins opposite Sharga and covers whole space south of 20 fathom contour line. Haira, Fasht and Sharga have date groves which extend some distance south from last mentioned place. Inland from Sharga the land is a flat sandy plain. From Abu Hail to Dabai there are no groves. From 4 miles south-west of Dabai to Abu Dhabi coast has average direction about south-west: throughout this stretch it is barren and uninhabited, very low and uniform in appearance, consisting of sand hillocks with coarse grass in tufts and cut up by creeks and extensive swamps, without any tree larger than mangrove bush. Jebel Ali, 220 feet high, is only landmark in these parts. As Abu Dhabi is approached a succession of intercommunicating creeks and extensive swamps and backwaters is passed. These extend many miles into interior and are separated from sea by small strip of sand only : they yield fish and fire-wood. From Abu Dhabi to Bereymi the country seems to be chiefly sandy desert, shale and shingle cropping out with dip of 30° to north. There are only a few stunted date trees at Abu Dhabi. Three miles south of Abu Dhabi is large bay, unexplor ed, S'2 miles wide at entrance and perhaps 20 miles deep. Beyond this point coast is sandy or stony, with rocky hills and sandhills of moderate height. It soon assumes a west direction which it preserves till near Odaid when it turns north-west. About opposite the island of Dalma is the mouth of the Sabkheh, a wide depression or morass w r hich separates Oman from Nejd. From Abu Dhabi to Odaid the coast is barren and desolate, with water at but few places, and there indifferent. Great reefs extend as much as 30 miles to seaward, one of the principal being Bazim which has a length east and west of 53 miles and running parallel to the coast forms an inlet or blind channel called Khor Bazim about 60 miles long; entrance of this channel is at its west end, 19 miles east of Sir Beni Yas. The whole of the great bay between Abu Dhabi and Odaid is full of islands, reefs and shoals and is but imperfectly known or surveyed. Only inhabited island is Dalma. Even Arab vessels larger than pearl boats seldom venture here and Arab mariners seldom visit mainland in these parts. Fishermen fre quent the islands to catch fish and turtle. Pilots for this sea are obtained at Abu Dhabi. (4) The heat is intense in summer. Palgrave however considered the atmosphere at Sharga to resemble that of India rather than Arabia. (5) There are routes from Sharga, Abu Dhabi and Ras al Khaima to Bereymi.17 TTamcrton (18i0) gives the following stages on the route from Sharga fo Hamaton \ J X 3 llours south .by east to Pellah, where there is a well ®ith y gooa water hut no habitations nor trace of road; from Fellah 10 hours It „ ,fi, p«t to Bir Mobaflz where there is fine well but no forage what- ever a gradual ascent over sandhills ; from Bir Mohafi. 3i hours south by east and' south-south-east to Ghuroef, an old ruined fort in th.ck babool iurHe with several wells of good water and good forage for camels in cold sRason ■ from Ghureet 6i hours south by east and south-sonth-east to Jebel Yifp over hard sandliills with habool jungle, including some considerable trees, on right; from Jebel Yiii 13 hours south to Bereymi, very heavy road over and round high sandhills, difficult for camels. Route from Abu Dhabi to Be rev mi is described as follows : general direction a little south of east; Abu Dhabi to Maktaa, 4 hours; Maktaa to Narsaila or Hisn Ibhs, 5i hours ; Hisu Iblis to water -holes 11 hours; waterholes to lloweil wells, 0 hours; Howeil wells to water -holes, 10 hours; waterholes, to Boreymi oasis, 4.i hours; total 4' 1 hours (Cox). Zweruer makes it 33 hours, but he and Cox agree in making distance about 100 miles. Cox says there is no grazing on way for camels but Zweraer says camel-grass and tamarisk shrubs are plentiful after passing Remlali el Kabira which in his map is about midway between Abu Dhabi and Bereymi. Water is scarce. Zwemer has a half ruined village, Nachshila, about equidis tant from Berevmi and Ramlah el Kabira. Route from Ras al Khaima to Rerey- mi has not been described. (6) Pearls, fish, dates, wool and cheese are among principal products. Cattle are good but the bullocks seldom exceed 200 lb. in weight. Sheep and goats a.*e found and fowls are good and plentiful but small; eggs, cheese and butter are abundant. Pish teem, particularly mullet which are caught in nets in the back-waters. Red rock-fish, occasional seer- fish, small sharks and dogfish—the latter numerous and much esteemed by natives are taken at sea. Fish are used to feed domestic animals and even for manure (?). (b) {c) According to the Administration Report, 1902-1903, the chief imports of the 'Arab Coast' are date^ (lOM^O cwts.), rics (114,550 cwts.) wheat (23,953 cwts ), provisions (Rs. 93,240), salt (38,200 cwts.), coffee (9,020 cwts.), building materials, (1,035 tons), coir and coir rope (6,800 cwts.), white, grey, dyed and other shirtings and prints (1,321 packages), colours and paints (502 cwts. and 200 drums), gold lace and gold thread (6,200 tolas), hardware and cutlery (Rs. 22,660), tanned leather (Ks. 21,402), mats and mat bags (54,202 pieces), metals (1,140 cvvts. iron, 3S2 cwts. copper, 247 cwts. brass, 60 cwts. tin and 1,244 cwts. other metals) kerosine (4,254 cases) and other oils (4,080 cwts.), perfumes (421 carboys rosewater and Rs. 37,446 worth of other perfumes), porcelain (16,180 cases), silk piece-goods (3,600 pieces), spices (1,560 cwts. turmeric, 680 cwts. black pepper, 59 cwts. ginger and 1,046 cwts. other spices), su^ar (Rs. 3,998 loaf, cwts. 10,120 soft), tallow (1,532 cwts.), timber, Rs. 18,999), rafters (14,992 pieces), broad-cloth and other piece and manufactured woollen goods (498 pieces), specie (Rs. 8,36,395). In 1902 the Arab ports were entered during the year by 21 steamers (all British) with a tonnage of 21,000 and 872 sailing vessels (about -I Persian, J Arab and J Maskat) with a tonnage of 19,650). (d) The exports according to the same authority were pearls (Rs. 59,89,998 but this suddenly fell in 1902 to Rs. 8,00,000 only), gunnies (1,500 bundles), sharkfins (Rs. 2,500), shells (cwts, 3,000), woollen goods (2,653 pieces, local manu facture ?) and tobacco (653 cwts , locally grown ?). There cleared from the Arab ports in the course of the year 21 steamers (all British) and 772 sailing vessels (more than J Persian and most of the remainder Maskat) with ton nages respectively of 21,000 and 17,650. {e) Dabai (?) is now chief commercial centre. (/) (h) (5) (a) Whitelock in 1835 estimated (adult male ?) population at 11,000 to 12,000. (ft) Principal tribes are Joasmis, Beni Yas and Manasir with some Shihiyyin, Tannagis and Naim in more northern parts. (' ) Men wear loin cloths, woollen robes (camolines) and silk Wahabi headdress; shave their heads, trim their beards and moustaches. Women wear blue shirts or very loose gowns, with kerchief on head and masks having eyeholes: they are much fairer than the men. In early life men are slender and in old age attenuated; but between 30 and 40 thickset and of very powerful build. They are lazy but capable of great and united exertions and inured to privation, fatigue and danger from their youth.18 Their character is cruel and vindictive and so suspicious that intermcdiar' are generally employed in bargains. In spite of this they have few quuref 8 and among them old age is respected and filial duty faithfully dischnroJ)' Their hospitality is proverbial; but in manner they are stern; triviality i* not understood ; and firmness of mind and body are the only oualifcip* vpqtw J S {d) Some are Wahabis, others Sunnis. Bigoted and intolerant but do nnf carry these traits into small matters, {e) Food consists chiefly of fish dif bread and milk. Eicher classes indulge in rice. Much coffee is drunk ev™ by lowest orders and smoking is not uncommon in spite of prevalenoe nf \Vahabi tenets. All are dirty in person. Principal amusements are frennenf mg coffee-houses and gambling. (/) Their sole peaceful occupation' are pearling and fishing : the former can only he prosecuted from Juno to SentemW and, during had weather in winter, sea-fishing is impossible. They have therefore periods of enforced idleness which in former times led to piracy and still perimns drives them to tribal warfare. There is practically no agriculture. („) Men marry as early as they can support a family and when one wife passe hei prime they take another. Women marry as young as 14. The people treat their slaves with kindness and are formally polite to one another (VI iVi Arms in 183d were matchlock, spear about 7 feet lonsr, rich dagger in girdfi and long double-edged straight sword with long handle and no guard (8) /«)-!

BEHAin.— Section of Al Morrah tribe, by whom relations of Bahrein Chief were murdered in 1900, BIDAA-Large town in lat. 25° 17' north and long. 51» 31'east situated in deep bay on east coast of Katar promontory, about 65 miles south by east of its extremity at Bas Bekkin. Reefs oft the bay make it a natural harbour, but the entrance is shallow and somewhat difficult, and vessels of more than 15 feet draught cannot pass. Land on west side ol bay is stony desert, 40 or 50 feet above sca-level. South-east point of bay is quite low. Harbour basin is 3 miles in extent with regular soundings of 3 to o fathoms, bottom whi e mud or clay. Bidaa is built up the side of the rising ground and there is a fort in the town. There are two towers on high land above town and 1, miles south-east of town another tower near the wells, where there is a htlle c Tation, the rest of tbe country being desert. Other accounts place the wa er- supply 3 miles from the town. Doha-as Saghira immediately adjoins Bidaa on east and beyond it, without interval, comes town of Doha. places together cover a mile of sea front and contain population of about 0,00 of mixed tribes, always at feud with Bedouins. No large baghalas but many pearl-boats ; and inhabitants are all employed in pearl-fishery. Little cai1 obtained in way of supplies. Water is dear and indifferent, best bem 3 brought in skins from desert. Firewood comes from interior and trom Clarence Strait (Gulf Pilot, 1898). Kemball (1845) says that inhabitants are mostly Soodan, and that there are 300 houses and tOO to 700 men. Palgrave (1803) describes town as consisting of mass of small ana dingy houses separated by irregular lanes, with a long, narrow and ir y market-place; population 6,000 including Bahrein shop -keepers an ar i- sans and immigrants from Hasa. Palgrave describes male population as over-engrossed and shattered in health by pearl diving. He men ions two mosques, one in simple Wahabi taste, the other smaller and mor handsome m semi-Persian style. According to Ross there were here in no less than 250 pearl boats working under the Chief: but, from his remar that Bidaa had been formed by recent coalescence of 2 small villages, it wou C9I2FD ^22 seem tbat lie meant to include Doha and Doha-as-Saglnra (!'). He mentioned Sheikh's rosidence as at extreme south end and Turkish fort and garrison as in centre of town (of Bidaa proper ?). Most of Indian traders were only visitors coming with borrowed capital to trade at Bidaa and visit the islands for 4 or 5 months in the pearl season. In 1882 there were only 3 settled Banyans who w^ere cloth-sellers : 2 of them were bakers as well. CHAB SAIL—A tribe some of whom took part in Katar raid on Abu Dhabi in 1888-9. CHI BIS A—A tribe originally settled at Bidaa, who left it on account of difficulties with Urair tribe. In 1873 they owned about 25 fishing boats and removed from Khor Hassan to Zubara, being at that time allies of the Nairn. CHITEBH (UMM-AL).—Name of a pearl-bank (?).

ALT.—Small tumble- down village, about one hour's ride from Manama in the centre of Bahrein Island. Apparently connected with Manama by remains of an ancient made road. Immediately outside of it are 25 or 30 large tumuli from 40 to 50 feet high and 40 to 50 yards in diameter at base. These are adjoined by chains and groups of innumerable smaller tumuli extending to the south and west of the village. One large and one small tumu lus was opened by Durand in 1879 and the same by Bent in 1889. Ivory fragments found in the interior of Bent's larger tumulus where pronounced by an expert to be of Phoenician workmanship. Pottery is made here. ALI (AL BIN).—Tribe called by Douglas one of the largest sections of the Bahreinis. AMAMERAH.—A Bahrein tribe. ARAD—Peninsula forming part of Muharrak Island, from the south of which it projects into the horseshoe bay formed by the island on that side. On it are a date grove and laige double fort. From Buckingham it would appear that the whole of Muharrak Island was formerly called Arad. ARAD FAMOIIAY.—Mentioned at page 560 of Bombay Records XXIV as an island of the Bahrein group. ARZA.—Islet, situated on reef, f mile north-east of Kalali. Has remains of a building and two fresh-water springs near it. ASKER.—Fishing village on east coast of Bahrein Island about east-north east from Jebel Dukhan. AWAL.—Niebuhr gives this name to Bahrein Island. Palgrove ridicules Niebuhr, declaring that Awwal means ' shark ' and is not the name of any island in the Gulf. Zwemer says that the name Owal still lingers. BAHREIN.—Group of islands formiug a principality. Includes the islands of Bahrein (or Awal ?), Muharrak (or Arad ?), Sitra and (?) Umm Nahsan, which arc described under their own names, (i) The Government of India have decided that the Sheikh of Bahrein has no territorial possessions on the mainland though ho owns rights of pasture, etc., there. The boundary of Bahrein in every direction is therefore the surrounding sea. From Ritter it would appear that a tract extending along a considerable portion of the east side of the Gulf once bore the name of Bahrein and was the abode of the Carmathians. (2) No information as to sub-divisions. (3) The physical char acteristics of the separate islands are described under their names. The principal features of the group are the lowness and levelness of the land and the shallowness of the surrounding sea. The whole Gulf of Bahrein is a mass of reefs and shoals fromRas Rakkinto lias Tanura,a distance of 70 miles, except for one clear and fairly wido channel running north and south, off the east side of Muharrak Island. The most extensive obstacles to navigation are the Fasht-ad-Dibal, 5 miles long from north to south by 2i broad, between Muharrak Island and Ras Rakkin ; and the Fasht-al-Yarim or Teignmouth Shoal, 13 miles in length from north to south by 8 miles in breadth towards its north end. The latter'protects the Manama anchorage from the north and west. The shallow waters of Bahrein may be considered to extend to the Rennie Shoal, over 50 miles north of the island. There is a passage from Bahrein to Katif south of the Fasht-al-Yarim available for vessels drawing not more than 15 feet: it is called the Kbor-al-Bab. Many of the reefs dry in patches at low water, and the island of Muharrak is29 tripled in area wlien the tide has receded. A remarkable feature of the Bahrein islands are the fresh-water springs which exist, both on land and under the sea near the shore. The largest on land is the Adhari which rises about 3 miles south-west of Manama near the head of the Nabbi Sali creek : it forms a perfect river of fast-running water, 10 feet broad and 2 deep, which irrigates many miles of date-groves, being conveyed by an ancient stone aqueduct. The Abu Zeidan spring flows from stone ar/h under small mosque at Belad -el-Kadim : it is built round and reserved for Chief of Bahrein and his family. There are also the Gassari spring between Manama and Belad el Kadim, and the Umm Shaoom spring 1 mile east of Manama. Bent mentions one called Garsari (is this same as Gassari above?) and Bitter speaks of an A in Marilgha and an Ain Ghadar. According to Bent the Arabs think springs are fed by an underground continuation of tho river Euphrates. The marine springs lie mostly around Muharrak Inland, there being one on Saya islet, 3 inside Khaseifa opposite Dir, 2 on Arza islet opposite Kahli, one at Bu Shahin and one called Bu Mahir near Muharrak Port (see the articles on these places). There is also a fine fresh marine spring on the Khor Fasht about north-west from the Portuguese Fort on Bahrein island and GJ miles from the nearest land, from which Whish obtained 700 gallons of good drinking water in one day in 1859. Most of these springs are brackish (?) and Zvvemer says those on the north part of the island are luke-warm. The best water in the islands is found at Hanaini whence it is brought daily to Manama by caravan. (4) Ac cording to Bombay Selection (1818) the climate is bad, and the inhabitants more prone to suffer from contagious diseases than elsewhere in the Gulf, cholera being specially virulent here : Gulf fever is prevalent and strangers sleeping on shore are liable to be attacked by it. Palgrave experienced violent gales at Bah rein in January iSO'J, accompanied by rain, hail and thunder; trees were blown down, huts unroofed and ships swamped or cast away. Durand states that the climate is delightful from October to April. Zwemer says the climate is not so bad as has often been stated by casual visitors. October, November, December, March and April are pleasant months, the temperature indoors rang ing from 60° to 85°. January and February when north winds blow and it is cold enough to light fires are the most rainy and least healthy months. From May to September weather is hot, but till the middle of June tho nights are cool and the heat is tempered by sea breeze {barih). Land breezes from west and south continue irregularly all summer; when they fail thermometer remains persistently above 100°. In the summer of 1S93 at Manama the mini- mum indoors was 85° and the maximum in the shade 107°. The prevailing ^vind is the Shemal, which in winter is violent and endangers shipping : only other strong wind is Kaus from south-east which blows irregularly between December and April. (5) No information, except that there are traces of a made road to Ali, that caravans ply between Manama and Hauaini, and that some excel lent donkeys are obtainable for transport. (0) (a) Products are pearls, dates, figs, citrons, peaches (?) and loazi almonds, of which husk is eaten as well as kernel; also limes, oranges, pomegranates and grapes and a few vegetables of several kinds including onions. Clover (?) and lucerne are grown fur fodder. Bombay Selections mentions mulberries and melons, and Bitter speaks of corn. Palgraye thought the vegetable produce of Bahrein, except citrons, was below mediocrity : palms were numerous but the dates wretched, and generally speaking vegetable growth was rank but quality poor. Small gazelle are common in the rocky highlands. Camels arc kept but do not thrive; the white donkc}s of the place are celebrated for strength and swiftness. Mignan says the horses are renowned for their ' gentility. ' Sheep are few. Oxen and kine are not rare, but the beef is poor. Fish are abundant and good, (b) ?. ln 'P rma tion about internal trade except that the agricultural inhabitants sell their surplus produce at Manama, {c) Imports, mostly from India are rice, cloth, cotton, calico and spices to the value of $ 000,000, of which J is for local consumption and f for re-exportation (Bombay Records, 1818). Imports are (a es and ghee from Basra; goats, sheep, bullocks, cows, camoleens, dates, on eys and horses from Arabia; sugar, cloth, gunpowder, swords and n\n C -f i i! ico-\ r ^ ce ' indigo, thread, needles, etc., from India ^ ^ ice » sugar, indigo, iron, metals, ghi and Malabar timber for ship building arc imported (Hitter, 1816), Douglas (1890) mentionsa trade worth about one lakh of rupees annually in rifles, mostly Martini rifles and carbines, purchased at IU 100 each and nearly all re exported to the mainland. He says rice is imported from India and wheat from India and the Persian ports, large quantities being re-exported to the Arabian coast. Ac cording to the Gulf Pilot (1898) imports are pieje-gcods, rice, cotton, coffee', timber and other shipbuilding materials ; also, largely for re-exportation, cattle,* fuel, grain, drugs, tobacco, sugar, oil, etc- Zvvem r (UiOO) calls Bahrein the rice, timber and piece-goods dep6t for all eastern Arabia. The followino- were the principal imports in 1903 and their approximate values in lakhs of rupees : pearls 45J, specie 43, rice 20|, cotton piece-goods 9, dates 4J,coffee 3^, tobacco 2f, timber and wood 2, wheat If, ghee and sugar each, silk piece- goods li, and cattle lakhs. An arms'import, worth 4 lakhs a year only a short time before, had entirely disappeared. The total value of the imports for 1903 was 154 lakhs, of which 87 lakhs fiom India and 52 lakhs from Turkey. About J of the coffee, J of the cotton-goods, | of the dates, J of the grain and pulse and vo of the specie were re-exported, also the whole of the pearls. In 1903 no less than 71 steamers with cargo, all British, aggregate tonnage 102,876, enter- ed Bahrein, {d) Exports, according to Bombay selections (1818) are p &gt;arls, dried dates and bullion, worth $800,000 annually. Bahrein boats were calculated to collect 350,000 crowns' worth of pearls annually, and more than that quantity to be brought to Bahrein for sale from other places. Whitelock (1835) mentions wool camoleens and dried fish ; als ) tint date^, horses, pearls and dried fish are taken to India by Bahrein vessels. The Gulf Pilot (1898) gives pearls and dates as principal exports, adding hides, cotton sail-cloth, grain, datemats of fine tex ture, wool, cattle and a few remarkably fine horses and donkeys. The following are given as the strengths of the Bahrein merchant fleet at different periods 1,400 fishing boats, of which 700 large, 300 intermediate and 400 small (Bombay Selection^, 1818). Some large baggalas, built for trade and Mar, which made 2 trips to India in beginning of north-east monsoon (Whitelock, 1S35). 25 merchant baggalas, some of large size, 12 bateels and ghoonchas, 800 pearl boats (Bombay Selections, 1829). Six large baggalas trading t &gt; India besides 30 or 40 of size used in Gulf trade and 500 to 600 pearl boats as compared with 21 large merchant vessels, 500 fishing and cargo boats and 1,500 pearl bo its at an earlier time (Bombay Selections, date uncertain). Latest passage in same autho rity (probably about 1850^ gives 20 large boats of 110 to 350 tons and 10) of from 40 to 120 tons. Gulf Pilot (1898) mentions only 300 to 400 pearl boats and 200 native craft of from 20 to 300 tons, besides many of smaller size. Ac- eording to Bombay Selections 30,001 inhabit mts out 70,000 live by pearl fishery. Hie chief expor.s in 1903 were (in lakhs of rupees) : pearls 102grain and pulse 6^, specie 4^-, dates 3^-, cotton piece-goods 3^, oyster-shells 2^-, and coffee 1|- lakhs. Except pearls and oyster-shells these appear to have been almost entirely exports of imported goods. The total value of the exports in lakhs of lupe es was 130, of which 106| went to In lia and 15 to Turkey. In 1.^ Reamers clearing from Bahrein with cargo numbered 38 of which .7 were British, total tonnage of latter was 56,055.

Mignan (1S39) says the men (Balireinis ?) are tall, slender, short-lived, with wenk and scanty bt-ard, their heads covered with an immense bush of hair anointed with fetid grease and that they wear only a handkerchief secured round their loins by leather thongs. (Does this refer to pearl divers in general or to aboriginal Bahreinisp) Bombay Selections (1851) makes the aborigines to be of Persian descent : in another place it speaks of them as a mixed breed be tween Arab and Persian. l J algrave describes the country people (aborigines ?) as living in clusters of thatched cottages and maintaining little intercourse with Manama. Me says they have an almost savage look, the result of their isolation; that a few in the centre of the island live by hunting, those on the coasts by fishing and rest by agriculture. He calls the town people a hybrid race fused into a distinctive type, with round features and of medium build. Bent referring to inhabi ants of vill'ges (aborigines ?), says they have little or nothing to do with pearl fisheries but are an industrious race of peasants. From the above confusing accounts it is hard to say how inhabitants of Bahrein should be classified, (g) No information as to character of Arabs B ihrcinis are said to have more of the indolence and cunning of the Persian than of the frank and open boldness of the Arab, and to be despised by the Arabs. Palgrave says that the town people are intelligent, easy, good humoured, better adapted to peace than to war, to trade than to agriculture, not equal to Omanis or Indians in regular business, but making excellent weavers, workers in metal, wood and leather, tailors an d dyers, (d) Shiahs apnarentlv predominate ('T* this only among Bahreinis or aiso among Arabs ?) Nicbuhr says that in his time Persians cime here to study the Koran in Arabic, and Bahrein was called the Shiah University. Palgrave remarks that the Sunnis of Manama are curiously enough, Malikis. (c) Nothing is said of mode of life of Arabs. Some of the information under (J) above refe s to life of B ihreinis. Mignan remarks that pearl divers' families live in cabins of date-leaf and reeds, ~ Bent notes, apparently with regard to the Bahreinis, that some oat seaweed and that they make sheerah for their own consumption out of slightly dried dates with d; te juice and an addition of sesame seed, walnuts or ginger-powder. Occupa tions of the Arab population are not distinguished from those of Bahreinis Bent says villagers feed their cows on green dates, date stones and fish bones boiled together and give green dates {salang) as fodder to their donkevs: water for irrigation is hoisted by charsas worked by donkeys or bullocks and'the water is distributed from the channels to the date trees bv balanced buckets The groves are manured with the fins of the ray-fish (a,ml), (g) (j) No information. 11 f A y Records) the yearly revenue of the islands was esti- mated at 1U0 ,000 tomans of 12 piastres Bumi each, f of whieh was con- Sidered to be obtained by extortion.

In 1898 Sheikh had some very fast sailing war vesseis (batils). Zwemer (11300) writing of the present Chief says most of his time is devoted to hawking and the chase ; judicial authority is exercised by a Kadhi and oppres sion, blackmail and bribery are universal. BAHREIN ISLAND.—Island 27 miles long with maximum width of 10 miles. According to Bombay Records (1856) about ^ of the island is well-watered, thickly inhabited and partly cultivated, the rest is in equal proportions hilly and deseit. The soil of about ^ is rich and capable of much improvement as, with the exception of the date plantations and a few barley, wheat and clover fields, it lies entirely waste. Whish (1859) described the road from Manama to Jebel Dukhan as leading through rich date plan- tations and gardens in the direction of some minarets, passing which a back- water was reached m )ro or less ford ibla according to the state of the tide. Beyond this, | a mile, nn open space began, covered at first with tumuli but later subsiding into a level plain, swampy in places. A rocky path between steep cliffs, 40 or 50 feet high, then lei to elevated ground, barren and very stony. From this point there was a gradual ascent to llufaa followed by a des cent into a vast crater surrounded on all sides by cliffs. Over the bottom of the crater the road ran for 5 miles through uneven ground of rocky formation to Jebel Dukhan, a mass of rock standing almost alone in the centre of the crater. From Rufaa to Jebel Dukhan ground was covered with stones, which were coated with green lichen and contained beautiful crystallised spar. Palgrave (186^) described, the west side of the island as consisting of dark tenacious mould steeped in moisture. Many paths crossed the north end of the island leading to little clusters of thatched cottages. Durand (1879) found that Jehel Dukhan com manded a perfect view of the encircling sea and mainland. The top was visible from both Muharrak and Manama and the hill was surrounded by a ring of cliffs, facing inwards, at a di-tance of 3 or 4 miles; the land surround ing these sloped down more or less gradually to the sea on all sides. Formation was apparently not volcanic as rocks were limestone and sandstone. To the south and east the island was very bare, but almost due west of Jebel Dukhan palms be^an to lino the coast and stretched thence all round the north shore. To the north-east, nearer the coast, white dusty ground everywhere intruded and mighty mounds bare of vegetation towered above the palrn-groves. The mounds stretched in endless chains all round the slope that falls from the cliffs to the sea, clinging rather to the higher ground but occurring also in separate clusters near the sea. The parent group of mounds was at Ali, but they were found also at Balad al Kadim, on the road to Rufaa and at Sirabe. From Manama west to Balad al Kadim were lines of date gardens. Principal trees are date, vine, fig, pomegranate, almond, hair, peach, tama rind, citron, apricot, mulberry. Castor oil plant nourishes and lucerne grass is- largely cultivated. Camels are mostly from Arabia but a few are bred in the marsh.es. Horses are carelessly bred and inferior, cows good but race dying out as no poor man or cultivator can keep them. White donkeys famed,'but few except with Sheikhs and rich men and those not so good as Persians. Ordinary donkeys common. Wild animals are gazelle, hare and mongoose. Bent (1889) described the island as an almost dead-level of sandy desert relieved by palm-groves, with a good supply of water and occasional cultiva tion. The hills in the centre are limestones ; the rest of coral formation. The Gulf Pilot (1898) describes Jebel Dukhan as a small square lump of dark hills and says the north end of the island has a bolt, 2 or 3 miles wide, of very fertile land covered with dato-groves. Zwemer (1900) states that the slightly elevated table-land in 4he centre of the island is mostly barren, BALAD AL KADIM.—Ancient site dating from before Portuguese occupation.

Cabins of palm-leaf formed majority of houses; they were of varying size and arranged mostly in streets and rows. There were some houses of brick and stone in Persian (Bent calls it Saracenic borrowed from Uasa) style with latticed windows and balconies, but 2 ere falling into decay.

HAJIR (BENI).—Large tribe occupying district for about 20 miles each side of Katif town. 1 hey wander as far as Odaid, sometimes commit small piracies and bear a bad reputation. Palgrave regards them as among original Arab settlers of Ilasa and says they are a Kahtanic tribe. He calls them one of the most spirited and courteous of the Bedouin tribes, better armed and clad and more civilised than the others owing to intercourse with towns of Hasa. H AMADIL—Place marked in Pelly's map, near coast about 80 miles m ^ Ivatit town. It is a stage on the route from Hasa to Koweit via. Taj. IIARB.

(6) Trade is dealt with in the articles on component districts. (7) («) Sadlier, 1819, estimated population of plain at 75,000. According to Ross, population declined from 85,000 in 18 20 to only 20,000 in 1865 ; but Cassim Izeddin (1897) estimated it at no loss than 500,000, residing in 2 towns (Alubarraz and Hofhuf) and 3(i villages. (This last estimate is the more excessive if it was intended to apply, as seems probable, to the district of Hasa Proper and not to the division of Hasa). According t^ Turkish official report, quoted by Zwerner, total population of province is 250,000. (b) According to Palgrave (1865) the original settlers in Hasa were the Kahtanic Arab tribes of Beni Khalid and Beni Hajir, followed by the Fezarah, the clans of Kelb, Belee, Tenooldi and various branches of the Kodaa. Douglas simply mentions agriculturists and Bedouins, of whom the former are a majority in Hasa proper. Among the Bedouins he mentions the Ejman, Beni Hajir, Manasir, A1 Morrah and Mutahir. Niebuhr described the whole district as belonging, iu his day, to the Beni Khalid who appear since that time to have declined in power. The Persian Gulf Pilot speaks of the Beni Hajir as occupying the country round Katif and of ' the remnant of the once powerful tribe ' of the Beni Khalid as now being incorporated, between Uasal Gliar and Koweit, with the A1 Ejman ; also of the Al Morra and Mukhatiba as two other tribes in the neighbourhood of Katif. Kiebuhr mentioned also families of Turkish descent as owning con siderable land but taking no share in the government, which was at that epoch Arab, (c) The inhabitants (of the villages ?) are good sized and well propor tioned ; they are sallow and less muscular than the Nejdeans, but as much superior to them in intelligence as they are inferior in military qualities and physical force. They wear gold and silk without scruple and smoke tobacco, while the turban, Oman vest and light red cloak of the east coast frequently replace the kefiya and Arab smock. They are fond of literature and poetry and indulge in pleasure parties, song and dissipation. Their features are regular but not so marked as those of Nejdeans. The Bedouins are averse to all forma of settled government and unlikely ever to fight for the Turks but would probably be willing to attack an invader for sake of plunder, (d) Niebuhr says most of the inhabitants of the towns, especially near the coast, are Shiahs ; while the Bedouins and villagers of the interior are Sunnis. According to him there are many Sibaean Christians and a few Jews, (e) {f) {g). The Arabic of itasa is loss copious, pure and flexible than that of Nejd. (/?) (i) Douglas estimates the fighting strength of the Bedouin tribes at 4,600 men. (j) Nation* al arm of the Bedouins is the lance, but about 15 per cent, have breech-loading rifles, mostly Martinis, and some of the remainder muzzle-loaders of different kinds. (8) The Mutasarrif is appointed from Constantinople but is under VTali of Basra. In the districts of Hasa and Katif, and, perhaps, though to a lesser extent in the southern part of the Katar peninsula, Turkish authority is firmly established. The poor agriculturists are easily kept under control by military force, and fear of the lurk is very real; but both agriculturists and merchants are disaffected and favourable to extension of British influence, llegular garrison in 1896 consisted of troops of 6th Army Corps relieved periodi cally from Baghdad, viz., 2 squadrons cavalry, 1 battery of light guns drawn by mules and four battalions of infantry. One battalion infantry was at Bidaa, all other regulars at Hofhuf. Local Commandant had rank of Lieutenant-Colo nel. There were also a special corps of 50 Bedouins, mounted on camels and armed with Sniders to act as guides, etc., and six buluks or companies of Dhabitias of which four were mounted. The Dhabitias are specially raised for local service and are an armed police, occupying small posts in the populous parts and furnishing escorts for travellers and caravans, the four mounted buluks, three were Arabs and Kurds mixed, and the C912FD42 other entirely Kurdish, commanded by a Kurd chief who drew all the pay and found 100 men and horses. Pay of Dhabitia infantry was Rs. 16 a month and of cavalry Es. 30, Government supplying only Snider rifle and uni form. There were 50 mounted and 30 foot Dhabitias at Katif, 20 mounted in Katar and r 0 foot atOjair; rest were at head-quarters (Douglas). Accord ing to Zwemer (1900) there are only 600 troops at Hofhuf and 3u0 in Katar and Katif. The divisions according to this authority are the ' cazas ' of Neid Katar and Katif and the three together compose the ' sandjak ' of Hasa : the Mutasarrif resides at Hofliuf, and Katar and Katif have separate Wmmakams. There are the usual Turkish tribunals and each Arab tribe has its represen tative with the Governor. Turkish report mentions three schools and 3 510 pupils. * HAS A (PROPER).—Fertile oasis or strip of country about -iO miles inland from the coast, forming one of the 3 districts of the Turkish administrative divi- sion of Hasa.

Horses vary from the pure-bred Arab, at an enormously high price, to the common kadish or baggage horse. Large numbers of good serviceable animals, showing some breeding and able to carry a rider 100 miles in 3 days, can be bought for 20 to 40 liras. Bedouins own mnny very ^ood riding camels and a well-bred camel costs 20 liras on average but often much more : they are only inferior to those of Oman. There are a few buffaloes on the marshy lands about ilofhuf. feheep are fewer and meat dearer than in Nejd. Fine cloaks {ahbas are made of silk and wool mixed, embroidered with gold and silver thread. There are workers in copper and brass and the coffee-pots made here are good. (5) (&lt;?)

(8) In Niebulir's day justice was well administered under an Arab regime. Kevenue in 1865 was $270,000. The present Turkish Kaimmakamlik of Ilasa Proper is divided into the Mudirliks of Ojair, Jafar, Uofhuf and Mubarraz. HASEN.—Place in Beni Hajir country. H ASS AM (BENI).—Mentioned by Z vvemer as one of principal Arab tribes in Hasa. IIEDEEYAH.—Village placed by Palgrave about 50 miles north of Hofhuf. Sadlier describes it as a walled village with cultivation and flocks of sheep. HERKUZ.—Mere sandbank, about 1 cable in length, hardly above the level of high water. Lies 26 miles west from Jazirat Earsi. HEWEVERAT ( or IIOWERAT ?).—Mentioned by Sadlier as walled village, surrounded by large date plantation and well supplied with water from a hot spring and a large lake. Lies about 5 miles north-north-west of Hofhuf (P). Adjoining desert is barren and dreary. EIILLAT MEHAISH.—Walled village on mainland in Katif district south of Jarudia and north of Khewaildia. Appears to be identical with the Hilutumhesh of Sadleir, which in his day was unwalled and had population of 1 ,200. HOFHUF.—.Chief town and administrative capital of Hasa, situated in P 10 P e ^- gives latitude as 25° 20' 06' North and longitude as 19° 40' 50 Last. Douglas says it is about 50 miles south-south-west of Ojair. It /own v0n . ^ days distant from Riadh and 6 from Bidaa by caravan, { ) o^vn is an elongated oval, ^ mile broad and 1 to Ij miles long. is surrounded by date groves and gardens. Palgravo (1862) shows j,ai ens anc fields on every side; Jopp (1841) describes the ground to the south anc east as clear and on the north as clear to a distance of £00 or tiOO yards, hut says e a^c groves adjoined the wall on the west side. The houses are of n« 0n( l^- ant + C U roofs. There is a regular Municipality. Streets ccok mg o some authorities are narrow and dirty; others say they are wide Tvof C ?'f n ^ an e ^ em town. Palgrave divides the town into 3 wards: (i) the or 1Q n orth-west corner; U«) the Rifeeyeeyah or 'high' quarter in pjnifory fr?p Proportion of the older and nobler families reside; it forms the la 0 0 and Palgrave describes it as containing tolerable and- . - ■u even hfindsoniG houses, wlnte-plflstered find ornfimetited, with circhcs j ho says the situation is high and the quarter the healthiest in IIofhuF, getting some sea-breeze; (Hi) Naathar, the largest quarter, on the south and west forming a good half of town and containing all classes of inhabitants ; in it are the principal mosque, a few gardens and occasional trees, chiefly fig and citron. Town has 7 gates; and public square, 300 yards long by 75 broadj is at meeting point of all 3 quarters. (Palgrave 's book contains sketch plan of Hofhuf). (3) Town is surrounded by a high wall in bad repair environed by ditch which can be flooded. Port has been described by Sadlier (1819), Jopp (1841). Palgrave (1862) and Douglas (1896) and the accounts vary somewhat in details. It appears to be a large square construction of small stones in mud, with sides from J to | of a mile long. In 1841, walls were 20 to feet high and 7 to 8 feet thick, with towers 40 to 50 feet high at intervals of 40 to 50 yards; there was a dry ditch 15 to 20 feet deep and the same wide outside the wall, and on a level space between the two, round the whole circuit of the town, was a breast-work of stone and mud commanding the ditch. There was an entrance on the north and another on the east. On the south and east tbere were houses outside close to the walls but on the other sides the ground was clear. On the east side of the north entrance was a keep with high walls and towers at intervals. Within the fort were numerous houses and a mosque of which the dome was the most conspicuous object in the town. In 1862 there were 4 gates and the population of the fort was 2,000 to 3 ,000. There were then 15 or 16 towers to each side of the fort most of them round, with w inding stairs, loopholes and machicoulis. The keep was small but strong with towers 40 feet high. In 1896 the Turkish barracks and residences of all Turkish officials were inside the fort. Palgrave noted a detacdied fort called Khoteym at a short distance south of the town ; a fort on a conical hill between it and the town; and another fort on a hill to the north of the town. (4) The population was estimated at less than 15,000 in 1819 ; at 23 000 or 21 ,000 in 1862 ; and at lo,000 in 1897. (5) No information as to races or occupations. Half population are Sunnis ; remainder Shiahs and Wahabis. (6) In 1841 there was a Thursday market to which villa gers brought their goods for sale. In 1862 the chief seat of trade was at the Keysareeyah, a long barrel-vaulted arcade in the Hifeyeeyah quarter. Here weapons, cloth, embroidery, gold and silver ornaments were sold. Around it were alleys devoted to sale of foreign merchandise and local manufactured articles. Dates, vegetables, wood, salted locusts and small ware were sold in booths in the open square. In 1897 there was much intercourse with Neid and one caravan a week came in from Riadh bringing butter (ghi ?) and taking back nee, sugar and cloth. The average number of pilgrims starting annually from Hofhuf for Mecca was 400. In 1900 Hofhuf was still celebrated for the manufacture of elegant richly embroidered with gold and coloured thread and Oma^^) 0 —^lO^ 3 ^ 0Uri0US tliese beins ex P orted as far as Basra ly in ^^ rAREIN -'~' Accordin g to Ritter . a town of the Abd-el-Kais, apparent- ( AL )-— Tribo ' apparently in Hasa; see Bombay selection XXIV, page nt i^n L f T ' A ^ ~ Sma11 forfc on Katit coast about 6 miles north few fishermen! lIe3 south - 0ast o£ Katif town, inhabited by a which^m^s^l ^^trrd 'to'^urkish^omiuation 0116 ^ tribeS ^ side village, a little over 1 mile from Jisha, on left to Dousrlas it is nnn^ r /!

Sadlier enumerated 9 separate walled towns with population of 19,360 and 7 unwalled villages with population of 5,840, total 25,200. Cassim Izedin says the Caza of Katif (is this coextensive with Katif district ?) contains 16 villages and 20,000 inhabi tants. Gaskin reckons only 19 towns or villages on mainland, all with walls, and 4 unwalled on island of Tarut; he makes total population 40,000. (5) Among tribes are Beni Khalid, Amayir, Ejman, Beni Hajir, Al Morrah and Mukhatiba. According to one authority the country between Katif and Ojair is held by Uttoobees. Palgrave describes the village population as predo minantly Arab though with a strong Persian strain ; the town people are a mar- grel breed, largely Persian, {d) According to Cassim Izeddin all the inhabi- tants of the ' Caza of Katif ' are Shiahs. ((?) Rice and fish are the principal foods, {f) (h) (i) Gaskin estimates the fighting strength at 4,000 men. (/) Most of these are armed with breech-loading rifles (8) Governor is a Kaim- makam subject to Mutasarrif of Hasa. Superior officials are Turks but subor dinate officials and Kazi are Arabs, and the Arabs are left to themselves so long as the revenue is paid. Turks have a force of about 60 foot and 40 mounted men distributed through the district. They have no field artillery, but there are 2 brass and a number of iron muzzle-loading guns for which shot are sml to be kept at Katif town and Dammam. Pilgrims to Mecca travel via Hasa. There is a broken-down masonry aqueduct about 5 miles long in the district, the work of rulers prior to the Wahabis. Sadlier (lS19j estimated the revenue at 20,000 German crowns from the Jahand or war-tax (payable by villagers and townsmen as not being liable to be summoned to arms) ; 50,000 to 60,000 from tithes of agricultural produce collected in kind ; 5,000 to 6,000 from sea customs and lesser amounts from fishery and anchorage dues besides a small revenue from pearl fisheries. KATIP. lown, (1) Situnted on the coast about 37 miles north-west of Bahrein Island and 70 miles from Ojair. (2) In 1839 dense date groves sur rounded the town on all sides except to seaward. In 1862 it was environed by a network of rivers and buried in an interminable succession of gardens. Town itself was gloomy, crowded, damp and dirty. The west gate had a high stone arch of elegant form, lianked by a wall and towers, but all ruinous and dismant led. In IS Jo half the population resided in the fort and the remainder in the straggling town on south side of it. The ' Sarai' or government offices and the public buildings were located in the fort, but the bazaar and residences of most of the richer inhabitants were outside. Only the part of the foit next the sea was occupied ; the walls and houses in the remainder were dilapidated. According to Gulf Pilot, 1898, the town is scattered through the date groves that surround the fort. Most of the houses are of stone and some of thom are good. The streets are narrow and dirty, and water, though plentiful, is of bad quality. Gaskin (1902) says the proper name of Katif town is ivelat, and differs from Douglas in placing the fort to the west instead ot the north of the town : except for the space adjoining the fort the town is surrounded by date gardens. Harbour is unsatisfactory and landing inconvenient. Boats of more than 6 feet draught cannot reach an inner berth. The largest boats enter by a channel opposite Saihat which takes them as far as Buri Abdul Lif Ihero is a-passage round northern side of Tarut Island, only navi-able at high water, which joins the other from Burj Abul Lif opposite Katif town. N tne boats even can only enter and leave convenientlv at high water Cas- s.m Izeddin regards the anchorage between EasTanura'and Tarut Island as the A ^ S f, yS ^ V'® '; R ' ttl for a11 T ' rki ^ Government vessels! (.5) Mam defence is the old (Wahahi ?) Fort which has a citadel ot (Por tuguese .-;coiisti-uction at its north end. Sadlier (1810) described it as irreeular oblong with main face to the sea; it had three gates and citadel was sunnCl a^m^Vo^rvJd (189 ? ) SiveS ifc a bSio^d wall ind vaids r f / • a ' a . a y the sea, and a depth of 300 mo , Tn r P oi fort 18 ^niaret 80 to 100 feet hieh. According to Gas- kin (1902) fort walls are about 20 feet high. There is aL fsmal) fori called47 Burj Abul Lif on a reof in front of the town. (4). In 1839 tbero were 500 houses and 500 fighting men. Douglas (1896) was unable to estimate population but placed it between 5,000 and 12,000. Gassim Izeddin (1897) reckoned 5,000. Ga^kin (1902) puts it at 7,000. (5) There were no Hindus or Christians in 1819. Palgrave found the people a mongrel race with Persian blood predominating : they were mostly Shiabs or belonged to even more heterodox sections of Islam. Z werner also describes them as Sbiahsof Persian origin, abhorred by both Turks and Wahabis. In Niebuhr's day, also, the inhabitants were Shiahs and were believed to be mostly natives of or refugees frwm Bahrein. (6) In 1819 trade, owing to unsettled state of country was trifling, chiefly with Eahrein, in spices sugar, etc., of Indian provenance. A weekly market was held on Thursday out side the south gate of the fort. Accordingly to Cassim Izeddin (1897) about 300 sailing ships arrive annually from Bahrein bringing sugar and rice and taking away dates, while about 20 larger ships come yearly from Bombay (taking 20 days on the passage) to obtain cargoes of dried dates. Steamers seldom enter the port on account of its dangers. Date-branches, wood, reeds and dates are exported to Bahrein. (7) Water is plentiful but not good. (8) (9) (10). There is a Municipality but it is inefficient. Douglas mentions a few Turkish officials in the customs, etc., and a gendarmerie about 80 strong (50 mounted, 30 foot). According to Oassim Izeddin there is a Capitaine de Port (harbour master ?) at Katif. The revenue is £12,000 Turkish a year. The post goes via Hasa, which carriers reach in 24 hours, to Basra which it reaches in 7 days from Ilasa. KEDAIH.—Walled village on Katif mainland, south of Alawamia and north of Behari.

KHALID (BENI).—In Niebuhr's day whole ot Hasa belonged to this tribe, then one of the most powerful among the Arabs, and extending so far into the desert as often to annoy caravans between Baghdad and Aleppo. The other tribes of Hasa at that time recognised the sovereignty of the Beni Khalid. Palgrave mentions them as a Kahtanic tribe among the first to immigrate into Hasa ; he describes them as among most spirited and courteous of Bedouins, and as partially civilised by contact with towns. According to the Gulf Pilot, 1898, the remnant of this once powerful tribe has become incorporated with the A1 Ejman, between Koweit and llas-al-Ghar. In 1874 this tribe furnished the Turkish Governor of Hasa. k-HATT. Ihis name is said to bo applied to a coastal strip of the main land adjoining Bahrein and including Katif. __ . KHEWAILDIA.
