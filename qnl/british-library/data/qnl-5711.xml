Persian Gulf Turkish Jurisliction along the Arabian Coast. (Part I.) * To Foreign Office, I st Aug. 1879, No. 581. Secret Letter from Ind 127, ilnd Ma 1879. r J' | 01 T ard i n S this letter oa to the Foreign Office, the Secretary of State has reserved Lis opinion on the important questions raised 1 j it pending fuller consideration of all the papers eon- nected with them. That consideration will, perhaps, be assisted by a rather full summary of the correspondence which passed in the years 1871-72 in regard to the Tuikish expedition to N^ejd, which resulted in the establishment of the Sultan's authority, to a certain extent, over the Wahabees in the interior of Arabia; and from it the present complications are a direct outcome. It will be convenient, in the first place, to briefly the existing state of territorial posse, along the southern shore of the Gulf, so far as ^ undisputed, and the treaty relations of the I Government with the tribes along the coast ' north shore, from Mohammerah to Cape, ' . under Persian administration,! and is not m/ question. From the mouth of the Shatt el Arab to a nearly opposite the island of Demam, just soi Kateef, between the 26th and 27th parall latitude, Turkish suzerainty is acknowledg This is the sea line of the El Hassa district. nlcr South and east of Demam extends the El (or Guttur) coast, as far as latitude 24° 10', longi tude 53°. This is the tract of country to which the present discussion more immediately relates. Along it are situated Ojair, Zobarah, El .Bidaa, and Odeid. The following account of this district is extracted from a letter from the Acting Resident in the Persian Gulf, dated the 4th September 1873 :—§ ' It will be observed that there is an extensive cape or promontory called by the general name of Guttur, or properly Katr. The greater part of this tract is desert land, but a few Bedouin tribes find pasture for their flocks. On the coast aie fishing villages, such as Zobarah, Khor Hassan, El Bidaa, &amp;c., 'the most considerable being Biddaa. The whole coast is called the Guttur Coast, and the population is fluctuating. The question of the sovereignty over Guttur generally has never ye been decided. It has, perhaps, been a debateable 29^2. I. 883. ii7land, between Oman on one side and the Wahabee power on the other. At one time the Chief ot Ahoothabee is said to have exercised authority in Guttur. Later the TJttoobees, having settled here and at Bahrein, became paramount. T^ese turn had to pay religious tithe to the Wahabee Ameer, who established a Governor of his own at Bl In a deep bay, formed by the peninsula spoken of abgxe with the mainland, is the large island ot From longitude 53° the coast as far as the pro montory of Ras -ul-Kheimah, generally known as the 'Pirate Coast,' is occupied by the s^- call( J d t£ Trucial Chiefs ' of Aboothabee, Debay, Shargah, Ejman, Amulgavine, ^ and Eas -ul-Kheimah, )e- longiiiff to the Beni Yas, Al-boo Felasah, El Joasim, and Al-boo Ali tribes of Arabs These ChMs are described by Aitchison* as all paying tribute to the Wahabee Chief of Nejd, but as u really independent.' The first part of this statement, however, seems to require verification. It was no doubt true at one period of time,t but it seems very unlikely that, at the present, the position of the trucial Chiefs in regard to the 'Wahabees is at all different from that held by the Sheikhs of Bahrein, who are stated by Colonel Ross, oho Resident in the Persian Gulf, in a letter dated ^ 20th January last,t to have been ' practically reed from their engagements regarding payment ' tribute (or black mail) to the Wahabees ' by Virkish occupation of El Hassa and attempted gation of Nejd, resulting in the destruction of ower and influence of the Ameers. Ras -ul-Kheimah begins the territory of the n of Muscat or Oman, which extends south- 5 to and beyond Ras-el-Had, the extreme ern point of the Gulf. ie British Government has treaty relations M Bahrein, the trucial Chiefs, and Muscat. Hje following concise account of the history of Bahrein is extracted from Aitchison (Vol. /, p # 39) § ; —The island, owing to the richness of its ' pearl fisheries, was long a field of contention &lt;{ between the different powers that have held st supremacy in the Persian Gulf. Erom the ' eleventh to the beginning of the sixteenth cen- t( tury the inhabitants of Bahrein, to whom an ' Arab and Persian descent has been variously ' assigned, were subject to Chiefs of their own race. In the time of Albuquerque the island fell ' into the hands of the Portuguese, and was ' retained by them till 1622, when they were expelled by the Persians. After the death of ' Kureem Khan in 1799, the petty Chiefs of the ' Persian Gulf, who had been kept in check by the t£ strong hand of Nadir Shah and his successors, ' became involved in contests for supremacy, and ' in 1783 the Uttoobee tribe of Arabs, who had for ' some years inhabited Zobarah, on the mainland, ' and were virtually independent, made themselves. Vol. 45. t Colonel (Sir L.) Pelly, in his report, on the Wahabee country, written in 1865 (Coll. to Political Despatch to India, No. 11, dated 22nd February 1866), remarks as follows on this point:—'There are tribes u independent within themselves, whose Chiefs ' the Ameer has not authority to remove, but ' who nevertheless pay him tribute, although ' they cannot claim protection or aid. Under ' this class fall the Sultan of Muscat, the ' maritime Arab settlements of the Pirate ' Coasts, and the Chieftain of the Bahrein ' Islands, all of whom pay tribute : Sultan of ' Muscat, ^6.000; Chief of Bahrein, ,$4,000; ' Maritime Chiefs, from Ras-ul-Khyma to ' Aboothabi, ,$12,000.' An agreement, concluded between Colonel Pelly and the Wahabi Envoy in April 1866 (Coll. to Political Despatch to India, No. 61, dated 23rd August 1866), contained an assurance on the part of Imam Abdullah bin Feysul that he would not ' injure or attack ' the territories of the Arab tribes in alliance ' with the British Government, especially in ' the kingdom of Muscat, further than in ' receiving the ' zukat' (religious tithe) that ' has been customary of old.' It would appear from this that the ' tribute' mentioned in the first quoted extract is identical with the ' religious tithe ' referred to in the second. x Enclosure 15 in Secret Letter, No. 127 of 1879. § For further particulars, see India Letter ^ 0 * I® (Secret) of 1879 ; also Memorandum by Sir E.

The treaty by which our relations with the Sheikh of Bahrein are at present regulated is that concluded by Captain Pelix Jones, on the part of the British Government, on the 31sfc May 1861, the terms of which are as follows :—* ' Preliminary.—Considering the tribe disorders which arise, and are perpetuated from maritime aggressions in the Persian Gulf, I, Sheikh Mahomed bin Khuleefa, independent Ruler of Bahrein, on my own part, and on that of my heirs and successors, in the presence of the Chiefs and Elders who are witnesses to this document, do subscribe and agree to a perpetual treaty of peace and friendship with the British Government, having for its object the advancement of trade and the security of all classes of people navigating or residing upon the coasts of this sea. ' A rticle 1. ^ ' I recognize as valid and in force all former treaties and conventions agreed to between the Chiefs of Bahrein and the British Government, either direct or through the mediation of its repre sentatives in this Gulf. 'A rticle 2. ' I agree to abstain from all maritime aggressions of every description, from the prosecution of war, piracy, and slavery by sea, so long as I receive the support of the British Government in the main tenance of the security of my own possessions against similar aggressions directed against them by the Chiefs and tribes of this Gulf. 'A rticle 3. ' In order that the above engagements ^ may be fulfilled, I agree to make known all aggressions and depredations which may be designed, or have place at sea, against myself, territories, or subjects, as early as possible, to the British liesident in the J SI |;4 Persian Gulf, as the arbitrator in sucli cases, pro mising that no act of aggression or retaliation shall 'be committed at sea by Bahrein, or in the name of Bahrein, by myself or others under me, on other tribes without his consent or that of the British Government, if it should be necessary to procure it. And the British Resident engages that he will forthwith take the necessary steps for obtaining reparation for every injury proved to have been inflicted, or in course of infliction, by sea upon Bahrein, or upon its dependencies in this Gulf. In like manner, I, Sheikh Mahomed bin Khuleefa, will afford full redress for all maritime offences which, in justice, can be charged, against my subjects, or myself, as the Ruler of Bahrein. 'AL/nCLB 4. ' British snLjects of every denomination, it is understood; may reside in and carry on their lawful trade in the territories of Bahrein, their goods being subject to an ad valorem duty of 5 per cent, in ■cash or in kind. This amount paid shall not be demanded again on the same goods, if exported from Bahrein to other places; and in respect to the treatment of British subjects and dependents they shall receive the treatment and consideration of the subjects and dependents of the most favoured people. All offences which they may commit, or which may be committed against them, shall be reserved for the decision of the British Resident, provided the British Agent located at Bahrein shall fail to adjust them satisfactorily. In like manner the British Resident will use his good offices for the welfare of the subjects of Bahrein in the ports of the maritime Arab tribes of this Gulf in alliance with the British Government. ' Article 5. 'These Articles of Alliance shall have effect from, the date of ratification or approval by the British Government.' Our first treaty with the Sheikhs of the Pirate Coast collectively was concluded in 1820 by Major- General Grant Keir, on the successful close of an expedition which had been despatched from British ^ India for the purpose of suppressing piracy, which was carried on to an intolerable extent. Its pur port and that of subsequent instruments is thus summarized by Aitchison* : — # Vol. 7, p. 46. ' By the 9th Article the carrying off of slaves from the coasts of Africa or elsewhere, and the transporting them in vessels, was declared to be plunder and piracy. This was not interpreted as forbidding traffic in slaves, but as prohibiting kid napping only. A very extensive trade in slaves was carried on from the ports of the Red Sea and Persian Gulf with Kattiawar, Kutch, and the Native States on the west coast of India, which, under the interpretation put on the Treaty of 1820, the British Government had no power to interfere with.

In 1856 le trucial Chiefs and the Chief of Bahrein ' agreed to the following supplementary Article :— 0 &lt;c W hensoever it shall become known and certain that from any quarter whatsoever slaves have been brought to my territories, or to any places subject to my authority, I, of my own free will and accord, will seize the said slaves and deliver them over to the British vessels of war. Further, should it be ascertained that slaves have-been carried in any of my vessels, or in the vessels of people my subjects or dependents, and it should happen that the Go vernment cruisers did not fall in with the said vessels, then, no matter where the slaves have been landed, do I hereby bind myself to place an embargo upon the delinquent boat and her nakhoda until such time as instructions have been received from the Resident at Bushire regarding them.' ' The Treaty of 1820,' says Aitchison, ' did not limit the right of the maritime Chiefs to carry on acknowledged war with each other by sea, that is to say, war proclaimed and avowed by one Chief ' upon another. All other hostile aggressions, how- ' ever, were declared to be piratical. But under the ' name of acknowledged war, many acts of piracy ' were committed, especially during the season of ' the pearl fishery. The Chiefs were therefore in- &lt;c duced, in 1835, to bind themselves by a maritime ' truce not, under any circumstances, to engage ' in hostilities by sea for a period of six months, on 44 the understanding that the British Government ' would not interfere with the wars by land. The fC effects of this truce was so marked that the ' Chiefs were easily persuaded in the following year, and again in 1837, to renew it for eight months. Thereafter it was renewed annually 2982.6 ' till 1843, when it was prolonged for 10 years. ' On the expiry of the 10 years' truce in 1853, a treaty of perpetual truce was concluded, which. &lt;&lt; provided that there should be a complete cessation of hostilities at sea between the subjects of the ' subscribing parties; that in the event of aggres- *' sions on any one by sea, the injured tribe should ' not retaliate, but refer the matter to the British &lt;t authorities in the Persian Gulf, and that the ' British Government should watch over the peace &lt;£ of the Gulf and ensure at all times the due ' observance of the treaty,' of which it may oe as well to give the text, as follows* # Aitchi80D,Vol. 7, p. 67. ' We, whose seals are hereunto affixed. Sheikh Sultan bin Suggur, Chief of Ras-ul -Kheima, Sheikh Saeed bin Tahnoon, Chief of Aboothabee, Sheikh Saeed bin Butye, Chief of Debay, Sheikh Hamid bin Bashed, Chief of Ejman, Sheikh Ab- doola bin Bashed, Chief of Amulgavine, having experienced for a series of years the benefits and advantages resulting from a maritime truce con tracted amongst ourselves under the mediation of the Resident in the Persian Gulf, and renewed from time to time up to the present period, and being fully impressed, therefore, with the sense of the evil consequence formerly arising from the prose cution of our feuds at sea, whereby our subjects and dependents were prevented from carrying on the pearl fishery in security, and were exposed to interruption and molestation when passing on their lawful occasions, accordingly, we, as aforesaid, have determined, for ourselves, our heirs and successors, to conclude together a lasting and inviolable peace from this time forth in perpetuity, and do hereby agree to bind ourselves down to observe the fol- lowiog conditions :— 'Article 1. &lt;£ That from this date, viz., 25th Bujjub 1269, 4th May 1859, and hereafter, there shall be a com- ^ plete cessation of hostilities at sea between our respective subjects and dependents, and a perfect maritime truce shall endure between ourselves and between our successors, respectively, for evermore. 4 4 Article 2.

We further agree that the maintenaace of the peace now concluded amongst us shall be watched over by the British Government, who will take steps to ensure at all times the due observance of the above Articles, and God of this is the best witness and guarantee.' In 1868 an agreement was signed between Colonel i elly and Mahomed bin Thanee, the principal Chief of Guttur, by which the latter, although not a party to tbe maritime truce, bound himself not ' at any ' time to put to sea with hostile intention,' and to refer to the British Hesident any dispute or mis understanding which might arise. To the treaties with Muscat no special reference is necessary, as that territory lies entirely outside any limits over which the Porte has even the shadow of a claim to jurisdiction, and they have no bearing on the general question. We come now to the correspondence which com menced in 1871 on the subject of the Turkish pro ceedings in Nejd, the seat of the Wahabee power in Central Arabia, which on the east is limitrophe with the district of El Hassa extending to the shore of the Persian Gulf. On the 30th December 1870,* Her Majesty's Consul General in Egypt reported to the Eoreign Office that the Khedive had mentioned to him confidentially that, from information he had re ceived from Constantinople, he was persuaded the Ottoman Government was secretly preparing a force at Bagdad, with a view to an occupation of some positions on the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf, preparatory to a more direct interference in the affairs of Arabia. On receipt of this information, the Duke of Argyll suggested to the Eoreign Officef that Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople should be instructed to inquire of the Porte as to the circum stances alleged, and, if true, to seek an explanation of tbe causes of a movement ' which must be very ' embarrassing to Her Majesty's Government. About the same time a similar rumour reached the Government of India,t but (18th November 1871) was pronounced by Colonel Herbert, the Political Agent at Baghdad, to be without apparent foundation, there being no troops availably taere. An assurance to the same effect was also given by the Turkish Government to Sir H. Elliot. Nevertheless,§ on the 27th March, Colonel Hei- bert telegraphed to the Indian Government that, under orders from Constantinople, an expedition by land and sea was about to be sent towards Nejd to pport the Wahabee Sheikh Abdullah against his t t rni O i V vvt o/-vo o 1V p0&lt;T brother Saood. The force sent by sea-six ments and 12 gans—was to disembark at Xateef or Demam.8 Colonel Herbert having sent information in the same sense to Constantinople, the Ambassador, under instructions from the Foreign Office, ad dressed the Porte on the matter, and reported the Grand Vizier's views to Lord Granville as follows, under date the 3rd April :*— fC The Porte ' felt itself under a necessity not to reject the ' appeal for assistance made to them by Abdullah, ' the Kaimakam of Nejd, whom and espe- ' cially in whose religious tenets the Grand Vizier ' (Aali Pasha) feels no interest whatever, acknow- ' lodging that he would have been quite as well ' pleased if the respective positions of the two ' brothers had made it incumbent upon the Porte ' to support Saood rather than the representative ' of the Wahabees. The credit of the Sultans ' authority was, however, engaged, and the action ' of the Porte had to be guided by that rather than ' by any other consideration. With regard to the ' nature of the expedition, I might assure your ct Lordship that no maritime operations were con- ' templated in the Persian Gulf, and least of all ' against the island of Bahrein, respecting which ' he was aware that Her Majesty's Government ' were not indifferent. The object of the expedition ' was a perfectly legitimate one, for he did not ' suppose there was any disposition to dispute the ' Sultan's right over the Nejd, but as it was not ' possible to send the force/by ooa (oio) a ^cerfain^ ' number of transports had to. be collected to convey 'it nearer to the scene of its operations. I said ' your Lordship would learn with satisfaction that ' no naval operations were contemplated in the ' Gulf, as they would not have been seen with ' indifference by Her Majesty's Government.' In concluding his report. Sir H.Elliot remarked:— 'No real authority whatever is exercised by the ' Porte over these Arab tribes, but the fiction of it ' is clung to with extreme tenacity.' In a report to Sir H. Elliot, dated 29th March, of an interview with Midhat Pasha, the Governor General of Baghdad, Colonel Herbert disputed the application of the title ' Kaimakam ' to Abdullah. He wrote :t 'Abdullah may indeed have been recog- ' nised by the Porte as Governor of Nejd, after he ' bad succeeded his father Eeysul as positive ' sovereign of that country; but it is evidently erroneous to speak of him as a kaimakam or a ' nominee of the Ottoman Government, of which 'he has hitherto sustained his perfect inde- ' pendence.' Referring to current rumours. Colonel Herbert wrote in the same report:—' There can be no ' doubt that there is a great wish on the part of ' Midhat Pasha, and probably on that of the ' Ottoman Government, to obtain command of ' Bahrein and Kateef, and to establish the supre- ' macy of the Porte over the whole of Central and ' Southern Arabia, and this desire, together with a ' growing jealousy of British influence in the * Home Correspondence, Vol. 67, p. 419.

His Highness seemed excited and annoyed, and remarked that all mdependent States were perfectly at liberty to deal with their internal affairs as circumstances mio-ht require. Nejd being an integral part of the Sultan s dominions, the Porte could not be debarred Irom the exercise of its authority over it. Abdullah was not an absolute ruler as supposed, but a func tionary holding his appointment as kaimakam in virtue of ^ an Imperial firman, and therefore entitled to be supported by the Government against those who attacked him. The Ambassador might give the most positive assurances to Her Majesty's Government that the Porte entertained no inten tion whatever of obtaining the supremacy over Bahrein, Muscat, and the independent tribes of Southern* Arabia, and did not contemplate any attack upon them, or harbour any design to subdue them. The true and sole object of the present enterprise was to pacify the two brothers, to prevent the protraction of disorders, and to restore tran quillity. In reporting these explir It declarations to Lord Granville,J Sir H. Elliot ooserved that, supposing Midhat Pasha to be actuated by the designs, attri buted to him by Colonel Herbert, of extending the authority of the Porte, he could detect nothing at Constantinople to lead to a belief that any such project would be encouraged by the Grand Vizier, although His Highness showed himself excessively sensitive to any remark which he considered to imply a doubt of the rights of the Sultan over the Nejd districts. In a further conversation with M. Pisani, on the 11th May, with reference to later despatches from Colonel Herbert, Aali Pasha used much the same language as before. § His Highness stated that ' the Sultan being recognized by the whole ' Mahomedan populations as the only Khalif, as ' such he could not allow the turbulent Sheikhs &lt;£ to become masters of the keys of the holy cities ' of Mecca and Medina without prejudice to his ' dignity and the prestige of the Khalifat, and ' without losing his paramount authority over all ' the Mussulmans.' Aali Pasha declared again that the Porte &lt;£ entertained no intention nor har- ' boured any design over the independent tribes, 2982. C10 4 ^'but at the same time it could not permit the &lt;; Sheikhs to deal with their possessions as they 4&lt; pleased.' 5 He quoted the instance of Sheikh Seyd, ' who disposed of the port bearing his name^ in favour of a French Company for the purpose ' of getting a few thousand dollars, and thus 44 placed the Porte in an awkward dilemma.' After commenting on the indifference shown by the British Government to Uussian advances in Turkestan, Aali Pasha observed, rather in an angry tone, 'that, in his humble opinion, it did not ' behove a great power like England to avail itself ' of the pretended weakness of the Porte to en- ' deavour to countenance the Arabs, and interfere ' in the internal affairs of Turkey, which were of ' vital importance to her.' He repeated again that it might be reckoned upon that ' not the ' slightest idea was entertained of making new &lt;c conquests or subduing independent tribes. The ' Porte's sole desire was to restore peace and tran- ' quillity in its dominions, but so long as foreign ' countenance was given to those turbulent Arabs, ' the action of the Porte, as a matter of course, ' was paralysed, and the Arabs were encouraged ■' in their illegal acts against the Sultan's autho- ' rity.' As Aali Pasha's language seemed to indicate a suspicion that the disaffection of a section of the Arabs was countenanced by Her Majesty's Govern ment, Sir H. Elliott assured His Highness that there were no grounds for any such supposition. All that Her Majesty's Government desired was that the existing state of things in Southern Arabia should not be disturbed. The declarations of the Turkish Government were communicated by telegraph to the Govern ment of India, who, in a Despatch dated the 23rd May 1871 (No. 26, Secret), made the following observations on the subject of the expedition :— ' Although the assurances so explicitly given by the Turkish Government may for the present allay any immediate apprehensions, we think it not im probable that the expedition to Nejd may, from the force of circumstances, assume more serious pro portions than the Porte at present contemplate. : ... It is, therefore, highly desirable, both in the interest of the Porte and the peace of the Persian Gulf, that the expedition should be stopped, and if that is, as we fear, no longer feasible, that the Government of the Porte should be advised to limit its proportions as much as possible. 'Your Grace is aware that it has been the policy of the British Government for a long course of years to prevent all such expeditions in the Persian Gulf as calculated to disturb the maritime peace, of which it has, with the best results, become the protector. ' The position we have assumed was partly forced upon us by the necessity of protecting the lives and property of our subjects, great numbers of whom have, on the faith of the security created by our * On the Arabian coast of the Red Sea, opposite Perim. f Despatch, No. 200, dated 17th May 1871.

The scope of these .nants, howerer, is exceedingly limited. Thev affect only those Chiefs who are parties to them Bat our general position in the Gulf rests on other evo^f ^ str011 ^ of ^Pinion that no • jf 1 0 policy ayo have hitherto pursued those waters can be permitted without great risk of our influence being shaken, and our power o preserve the peace at sea between those who are not parties to the treaties being weakened, if not altogether destroyed. If the Turkish Government proceed against Saood by sea we could not rea sonably prevent Saood himself, or any of the Chiefs on the coast whom he might attract to his standard, trom attacking by sea the Turkish expeditionary force If the result were a defeat of the Arab Chiefs we could not prevent the Turks from exer cising over them all the rights of successful war, and establishing their supremacy over the Arab country. If, again, the Arab Chiefs, remaining quiet now, should hereafter seek to effect an armed movement by sea against any parties who have not subscribed the treaty of peace, permission could not be denied on any intelligible grounds after a similar movement had been effected by the Turkish power without challenge on our part. Or if Persia, desirous as she is to possess a fleet in the Gulf for the purpose of establishing her claim to supremacy, should throw herself on some foreign power and procure vessels of war, there are no grounds on which the British Government could remonstrate except such as are equally applicable to the pre vention of this expedition. The occurrence of any of these events, which do not by any means exhaust the list of probable contingencies, would probably occasion the abandonment of the policy and the loss of that position which the British Government has come to occupy in the Persian Gulf.' In the same Despatch, Lord Mayo's Government referred to several earlier communications which they had addressed to the Secretary of State, on the subject of their position in the Persian Gulf, but which had been left unnoticed. This will, perhaps, be the most convenient place to quote the material paragraphs of the papers in question, which put the whole case very clearly, and are as appli cable to the situation created by the action of the Porte, as to the immediate circumstances under which they were written. The earliest and most important of them was dated the 18th February 1870, (No. 18, Secret). Its main subject was the Persian claim to Bahrein,12 but the following paragraphs relate to the general question of the British supremacy in the Gulf. In para. 15, the Government of India quoted a remark of Colonel Pelly, previously reported :— ' The Persian Foreign Minister would pretend to dread that we may use force against Persian islands. The simple reply to this is, that Persia owes the possibility of trade in the Gulf, and the tranquillity of her Gulf littoral, wholly to the British maritime police of the Gulf. Persia has not a gun afloat to protect her own shore, and the Arab Chiefs have, on more than one occasion, ex postulated with me for preventing their old sea . raids, and have frankly admitted that, if it were not for the British Resident, they would seize every Persian merchant craft and plunder the Persian seaports. My opinion, based on many years* observation and experience, is, that if we were to abandon our maritime protection of the Persian Gulf, trade in these waters would soon become impossible, and the ports on the Persian littoral would become subject| to hostile attack, and per haps fall into the hands of Arab Chiefs.' They continued, para. 17 :— ' The Persian Government, we may remark, are, at the present moment, powerless to stop distur bances at sea. They have no navy, and even if they were in a position to purchase vessels of war, we could not surrender to them the protectorate of the Gulf without the certainty of hostilities, not only with Muscat and the Arab Chiefs of the littoral, who would not tolerate the pretensions of Persia, but also with the Wahabees, and probably even with Turkey, who could with equal show of reason put forward obsolete claims to supremacy which our position as guardians of the peace of the Gulf alone prevents her from reviving. The obli gation, moreover, which we have contracted with the Arab Chiefs to watch over the peace of the Gulf, to put down aggressions by sea, to take all necessary steps for the reparation of injuries in flicted on them, are such as we cannot abrogate. The only security for peace and the safety of trade in these waters lies in our preserving that position which, with the consent of the turbulent tribes, we somewhat reluctantly took up, which for more than half a century we have, not without difficulty and at considerable cost, maintained, and which Persia, with her feeble resources, and the scanty respect paid to her by the Arab Chiefs of the littoral, could never assume.' The Despatch concluded as follows :— ' Apart from the positive engagements which we have contracted with the Arab Chiefs, and from which it is neither possible nor desirable that we should recede, the present is not a time when we can encourage the revival of old and unfounded claims such as those which Persia now puts forward. During the years of peace that have followed the„&gt; S • a 13 Gu ^'SrLf P 0Ur SUp f macy iu the ^ ers ian noi h v r, v Tr z now ply weekly from oae end of the Gulf to the in the ^ ?'i r , sul !j ects 1 ' ave embarked large capital m the pearl fisheries on the coast, and in the com- meree of Mesopotamia, Persia, and Arabia. Every day the importance of the Gulf as a commercial highway between Europe and the East is increasing. iiven it the political engagements which we have contracted admitted of such a course, and Persia were possessed of an adequate naval force, it would be almost impossible and certainly impolitic to commit to her the guardianship of these vast and varied interests. Any indication on our part even 01 a desire to do so would probably be followed by the decline of trade, the outbreak of hostilities, piracy, and plunder, and a return to the disorder and lawlessness which during the last half century we have so successfully restrained.' In a further Despatch, dated the 20th May 1870 (No. 28, Secret), Lord Mayo's Government pointed out that the action of Persia in regard to Bahrein had had the effect of reviving equally obsolete claims on the part of Turkey, and declared the real status of the island to be that ' of an independent ' State, subject neither to Persia nor to Turkey, ' neither to the Wahabees nor yet to Muscat, nor ' yet to the British Government.' They then went on, para. 12 :— 'We have already, in our Despatch of 22nd February, so fully explained our position and policy in the Persian Gulf that we have little or nothing to add. 'We can only repeat that our protectorate in the Gulf is a matter of obligation rather than of right; that we have pledged ourselves to the Arab Chiefs who are parties to the maritime peace to watch over the peace of the Gulf, to put down aggressions by sea, and to take all necessary steps for the reparation of injuries inflicted on them, and that from these obligations we cannot, in good faith, recede, Persia has not the means, even if she had the will, to undertake the duty of pro tecting the peace of the Gulf. She has no naval force. Her interests, as the present correspondence so well illustrates, are antagonistic, not only to those of the petty Arab Chiefs, but to those of the other great powers whose dominions extend to the shores of the Gulf and the neighbouring seas, and it is our deliberate opinion that even were we pre pared to abandon engagements to the performance of which British faith is pledged, our withdrawal from our present position would most probably be followed not only by war but by a return to that state of piracy and anarchy against which our long course of action in the Gulf has been so successfully directed. , . ti - ' We cannot too strongly impress upon Hei Majesty's Government that there is no middle 2982. Di - 14 course between maintaining the present state of things and an absolute abandonment of it, and withdrawal from the protectorate of the G-ult at the expense of our own £?ood name, and ail tlie benefits that have flowed from our policy for the last half century. The Arab Chiefs have no con- fidence in Persia, and we cannot consent to be associated with Persia in a duty which the Ohiets have committed to our hands alone, or to be en- tangled in all the complications which concurrent action or jurisdiction with her would bring about. If we are no longer prepared to continue the per formance of the tasks we have undertaken, we must withdraw altogether; but the consequences of such a step would be so disastrous, not only to our national honour, but to the peace of the Gulf, to the prosperity of the tribes inhabiting the littoral, and to the lives and property of our subjects, who, during the peace of the last 50 years, have settled on the shores and embarked enormous capital in the pearl fisheries and the trade with the mainland, that we cannot contemplate this course as one the consideration of which Her Majesty's Government •could for a moment entertain.' Lastly, in a Despatch dated the 3rd April 1871 &lt;No. 13, Secret), having primary reference to the affairs of Muscat, the Government of India wrote, para. 6:— 'Whether our policy in the Persian Gulf rests on engagements contracted with the Arab Chiefs of the littoral, or on measures adopted for the security of our subjects and the protection of com merce, it is one which we have constantly pursued for the last fifty years, with the happiest results as regards the peace of these seas. It is a policy from which, for reasons already set forth at length, it is neither possible nor desirable that we should recede.' Ueturning to the Nejd correspondence, it is to be noticed that the Indian Government did not stand alone in its uneasiness. On the lith May 1871,* Her Majesty's Minister at Teheran tele- * Home Correspou graphed that the Shah was desirous of obtaining &lt;lence, Vol. 67, p. 603. some assurance respecting the Turkish expedition ' as affecting Bahrein.' On the 30th May 1871, the Viceroy of India inquired by telegraph whether, in case of need, he might instruct Colonel Pelly to stop by force ' any ' military operations by sea on the part of the &lt;c Chiefs either for or against the Turks.' Lord Mayo advised this course, and that the Turkish Government should be informed accordingly. The Secretary of State replied on the following day: ' Trucial Chiefs may be interdicted from ' maritime operations, but no others.' These orders were reported by Sir H. Elliotf to Aali Pasha, who ' expressed his thanks for the com- ' munication, and having in unequivocal terms ' repeated his assurances that the Porte contem- ' plated no naval operations, said that it had no 4 i / / t Despatch, No. 225 dated 8th June 187l'.

In executing these instructions, Sir H. Elliott took the opportunity to intimate to Server Elfendi, the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs (?) the opinion of Her Majesty's Government of the ' follv 'and danger' of the expedition, and to ur^e the Porte to restrain Midhat Pasha if he should attempt to give it any extreme extension. Server Effendi replied that he thought an exaggerated importance had been attached to the operations, and that there was &lt;c no intention of any kind of extending them ' beyond the Nejd district properly so called.' The assurances of the Porte were not regarded as at all satisfactory by the Government of Bombay, to whom at that time the Hesident in the Persian Gulf was directly subordinate. They wrote to the Government India on the 18th July 1871J 'The Porte proposes that its only object is to ' restore the authority of its Kaimakam, the ruler ' ofiNejd. His Excellency in Council fears it will ' be found that this covers a claim to the alle- £t giance of all the littoral tribes. The Ameer of ' Eiadh ' (Nejd) ' has received tribute from ' Muscat, has never ceased to claim authority over ' Bahrein, the Guttur Coast, and also Aboothabee. ' If Sheikh Abdullah is restored with the support ' of a Turkish force, His Excellency in Council ' does not doubt but that the Ameer's claims will ' be renewed, and, if renewed and successfully resisted, there appears nothing to prevent Turkish ' interference with the littoral tribes. His Excel- ' lency in Council confesses to apprehensions of ' great embarrassment in the future.' Colonel Herbert communicated to Midhat Pasha certain instructions which were given to Colonel Pelly, (1) to inform persons interested in the pearl fisheries that their interests would be protected, and (2) to intimate to &lt;{ all Chiefs, trucial and others,' that the Turkish Government contem plated no attack on them, and had no intention to obtain supremacy t£ over any independent State or tribe.' In reply, Midhat Pasha expressed his thankful ness that Colonel Pelly should have been directed to exert himself, and 'assist in preserving' order and tranquillity in the Gulf; he remarked that the expedition had no concern, originally or even-16 tually, with tribes 'not within the country of Nejd, ts that is, under the jurisdiction of Abdullah bin 44 Feysul;' but he protested against ''the existence, ' or possibility of existence, of an independent ' tribe in the country of Nejd.' This protest was considered by Colonel Herbert to be important, when taken in connection with an article which appeared about the same time in the local Government journal, and to which was ap pended a list of the towns, houses, &amp;c., in the province of Nejd. Among the towns mentioned was Bahrein, as also three towns belonging to trucial Chiefs on the Oman coast.* * In case of the Porte obtaining, at least for a time, a nominal supremacy over the province of Nejd, Colonel Herbert suggested that occasion should be taken to ' bring about a settlement of ' the long pending question of the frontier between ' Oman and JSfejd.' The Bombay Government considered that this report of Colonel Herbert strongly corroborated their view above quoted as to the probable results of the Turkish expedition, and the real designs of the Governor General of Baghdad. In a further letter they observed :—' But what are the boun- ' daries of Nejd ? It has been pointed out that the ' Ameer of Riadh has always claimed a suzerainty ' over Muscat and Bahrein, and it now appears ' that the official paper at Baghdad distinctly in- eludes Bahrein and the country of Oman to the ' east within Nejd territory. It i^ impossible to ' foresee to what complications their pretensions ' may lead.' The Government of Lord Mayo did not view the matter so seriously as did that of Sir Seymour Fitzgerald. The Foreign Secretary, Mr. Aitchison, recorded his views in a note, dated the 28th July 1871, of which the following extracts may bo quoted, as they relate to questions which are extremely likely to be raised in the discussion that is probably im pending :—f ' The Government of India are quite aware of these possible complications. The complications may arise by land or in the Persian Gulf. With the former we have really no concern, except as they affect our position in the Gulf. It is really a matter of indifference to us whether Bereymee belongs to Nejd or Muscat; and it would be the same with Aboothabee, Debay, and Shargah, were it not that we have treaties with these which affect our position in the Gulf. ' Whether or not these places are included in Nejd is a question of fact. If they are included, the degree to which they are dependent on Nejd is also a question of fact. Even if it be admitted that Nejd is a Turkish Pashalik, and the Ameer a Turkish officiaU and even if the places above named be within the limits of what is known as Nejd, it by no means follows that they form part of the Turkish Empire, or that they are not independent. It is17 StSt^&amp; at Ti «« Arab Chiefs have thev ^nnU to Nejd, and there is no reason why hey shoiild not continue to do so. The navmoTif 0 tribute is by no means inconsistent with sovereign independence.— (See Wheaton, p. 67; and PhT more, I., 116.) i-min- * * * ^ &lt;c It is a matter of absolute indifference whether these quasi-independent tribes are sovereign or absolutely controlled by Turkey. Probably the establishment of a strong Turkish influence in their internal administration would be rather an advan tage than otherwise. As regards their external or national relations, it is a matter of fact that they _iaye had for many years, and still have, certain re lations with us which are expressed in the treaties; as a matter of fact these relations were formed independently of Turkey or any other power. In lespect to their relations with us as expressed in . lie tieaties, these tribes were and are independent nations. Even if they were to part with every other attribute of national independence, that would not affect the question so far as we are concerned. The Turks may make them pay tribute, or may put a stop to their power of fighting on land, or destroy any other of their national attributes; but they have no power, without our consent, to touch those relations which as independent States they have formed with us. It follows, therefore, that our position at sea in respect to these tribes is in no way affected by their quarrels on land either among themselves or with Turkey. There is nothing, therefore, in our maritime position to call for our interference on land. Is such interference required by other con siderations ? I think not. I think it would be rather an advantage than otherwise to establish a firm Turkish rule along the coast. As for Colonel Herbert's suggestion, that we should attempt to interfere and define the boundary between Nejd and Oman, it would, in my opinion, be most im politic to do anything of the kind. We never attempted it during all the wars between the Wa« habees and Muscat, why should we do it with the Turks? To do so would involve our interference every time the boundary was violated, and as the Turks will never be able to maintain anything but a nominal control over Nejd, there are likely enough to be frequent quarrels between Nejd and Oman as there have been any time within the last 50 years. 1 would, therefore, limit our action to the main tenance unimpaired of our position at sea. * * * * 'The pretensions of Midhat Pasha to the pro tectorate of the pearl fisheries, assisted by Colonel Pelly, should not be allowed to pass unnoticed. In paras. 12-14 of our Despatch, No. 28, of 20th May 1870, we have shown that we cannot be associated with Persia in the protectorate of the Gulf, and have given powerful reasons for main taining unimpaired our old position. The same 2982. Earguments apply with even greater force to Turkey, and should be repeated.' Lord Mayo and his Council generally concurred in Mr. Aitchison's views.* The following are extracts of a Minute by the Viceroy, dated 21st July 1871 ' I always thought that it was one of the well known maxims of diplomacy, that a Government who desired peace should not initiate the discussion of complicated and difficult subjects, and should not reply to anticipated questions until they were put. I see no necessity whatever for expressing any opinion as to the boundaries of Nejd, Muscat, any portion of Oman, or the littoral of the Persian Gulf, though we are perhaps in a position to offer a sounder opinion on those subjects than any other Government, administration, or power. * Henvey's Precis, p. 47. ' The Government of India are quite aware of the possible complications that may arise out of the unwise action of the Turkish Government in this matter. We have expressed our views to the Secretary of State in the strongest language, and at the very first declared our opinion that every possible amount of diplomatic pressure and per suasion should be exercised to induce the Sultan to abandon this dangerous undertaking. We have received assurances more satisfactory than I had at first expected. * * * I do not know what the Bombay Government want us to do; but all I can say is, that if their advice is to be interpreted into this—that we should take the present opportu. Hy of attempting to define relations and boundaries as between the different Chiefs and States in these districts, I consider it to be a most unwise proposal. * * * Our obligations with regard to the Gulf itself, and the preservation of maritime peace, are sufficiently onerous and difficult without entering into further enterprises. ' I agree in the opinion that no provisions for a joint protectorate of the fisheries, come from what quarter they may, can be admitted.' On the 22nd August 1871 Sir H. Elliott reported to Lord Granville,f that having received a telegram from the Viceroy of India, inquiring whether there was any ground for a report that Turkish troops were to be thrown upon the Guttur peninsula, and that fortresses were to be erected at Kateef and Ojair, he had communicated with Server Effendi, who declared that after looking through the correspondence he could not find any confirmation of the report. Sir H. Elliott added' The Turkish ' Government is not disposed to be particularly &lt;£ communicative when questioned upon their pro- ,c ceedings in what they regard as their own &lt;f provinces,' i .e., Nejd and Yemen. With regard to Guttur, however, it is certain that, some time in the month of July, the Turkish flag under circumstances nowhere clearly ex plained—was hoisted at El Bidaa, a port on the east coast of the Peninsula.

Elliot reported to Ijord Granville that, in conversations he had held with Aali Pasha subsequent to the Uth May {see ante, p. 9) of which the primary object was to dis abuse the Grand Vizier's mind of any suspicion that ' Her Majesty's Government were disposed to ' question the right of the Porte to act as it ' thought proper in the quarrel between Abdullah ' and Saood for the administration of Nejd, which ' he regarded as an integral part of the Ottoman Empire, he had made the Grand Vizier under stand that, ' although we might have our own ' opinion of the wisdom and policy of the course that was being followed with regard to the two ' brothers, he need not fear any difficulties on the ' side of Her Majesty's Government, so long as ' the action of the Ottoman authorities was exerted ' strictly within the Saltan's dominions ; but that ' Her Majesty's Government would not see with ' indifference any attempt to disturb the arrange- &lt;c ments existing with regard to the Arab tribes on ' the Persian Gulf.' This assurance had contented Aali Pasha, and Server Effendi had since shown himself equally satisfied; but, in an interview on the 5th September, Sir H. Elliot had warned the latter that ' further avoidance of misunderstanding ' would depend greatly on the care shown by the ' leaders of the expedition in not overstepping the ' legitimate limits of the Sultan's recognized ' dominions.' In September, Colonel Pelly reported to the Government of India the arrival of two Turkish men-of-war in the Gulf, and rumours that the Ottoman squadron in those waters was to consist of ten vessels. With reference to these reports, the Government of India addressed the Secretary of State as follows:—I 'Tour Grace will readily comprehend the diffi- ' culty which the continued presence of a Turkish es naval force would throw in the way of our main- . ■'■•■I20 ' taining that position in the Persian Gulf which ' the British Government has, with the best results, come to occupy, and which it is, we are more than ever convinced, our true policy to uphold. ** * * * * In view of the many possible con- tingencies in the neighbouring parts of Asia, we &lt;c conceive that at no time was the maintenance of ' our position in the Gulf of more material impor- *' tance than at present to British interests, to the encouragement of trade, and to the preservation of the peace of the Indian seas. * * * We would, therefore, earnestly impress on Her Ma- &lt;c jesty's Government the necessity of taking ' immediate measures to ascertain definitely what ' is the policy of the Porte with regard to the ' Persian Gulf and whether it is their intention to ' constitute it, for the future, one of their naval &lt;f stations. If any such intentions have been ' formed by the Government of the Sultan, it is in 41 our opinion necessary that * * * no effort ' should be spared to induce them to abstain from ' a line of policy the adoption of which we could ' not contemplate with indifference, and which we ' believe would be injurious to the best interests of ' Turkey herself.' v This Despatch was communicated to the Poreign Office,* with a request that Lord Granville would ^ * 25thOct. 1871. Home take such steps as might be deemed expedient to C o rrespondence, Vol. 69, carry out the suggestion of Lord Mayo's Govern- p ' ment. Sir H. Elliot having, in accordance with instruc tions, addressed Server Pasha, reportedf that he f 1 Des P^ cll ' r j No ' ,07?' liad been again assured that the Porte entertained correspondence,' not the least intention to attack, nor obtain any Vol.62 ,p. 593; also Herts- supremacy over, the independent tribes on the let's Memorandum, p. 28. coast of the Persian Gulf, nor did it harbour any design of subduing them. With regard to Nejd, Server Pasha observed that it formed an integral part of the Ottoman dominions, and that the Porte, as a matter of course, was endeavouring to assimi late it to the other provinces of the Empire, and felt anxious to establish there permanent order and tranquillity. With regard to the construction of Turkish naval stations in the Gulf, Server Pasha said that all the Ottoman steamers had always I)een stationed there, on account of the proximity of the rivers connecting Baghdad with the Gulf of Persia, and that their numbers were daily increasing. In a subsequent conversation with Sir H. Elliot, on the 20th December,^ Server Pasha stated that at the Turkish Admiralty the Persian Gulf had always been noted as one of their naval stations; a small naval force had constantly been maintained there, but the opening of the Suez Canal had placed it within the means of the Porte to maintain it on a more efficient footing, which would for the future l)e done. ' Server Pasha,' wrote Sir H. Elliot, ' did not ' make any declaration of general policy in the J Despatch, No. 429, dated 21st Dec. 1871.

In a Despatch, dated the 15th March 1872 {No. 16, Secret), written before they had heard of oerver Pasha's fuller statement on the 20th De cember previous, the Government of India again adveited to the naval question in the folio win 0 ' terms:— 0 ' We conclude, from the reply of Server Pasha to the interpellation regarding the Turkish naval armament in the Persian Gulf, that the Turkish vessels are located there solely for pur poses connected with the internal administration of their possessions in Turkish Arabia, and that no interference in the maritime affairs of the Gulf is contemplated. Should this view be correct, we would suggest, for the consideration of Her Majesty's Government, that a representation be addressed to the Porte to the eifect that it would be a satisfaction to the British Government, and would remove all cause for apprehension from the minds of the littoral Chiefs, if the Turkish naval force stationed in the Persian Gulf were reduced and limited to the strength necessary for the pro fessed object. We would observe that the main tenance of unnecessary armaments cannot fail to create much uneasiness, and render it extremely difficult for the British Government effectively to discharge those obligations which it has contracted by treaty with many of the Chiefs and tribes on the shores of the Persian Gulf. The location of a powerful naval force in the Gulf would also be viewed with much apprehension by Persia, and would probably give rise to the very serious com- plicatioDs pointed out in our Secret Despatch, No. 59, dated 26th September 1871, to which we would again invite your Grace's attention.' • In communicating this Despatch to the Foreign Office,f the Duke of Argyll requested to be favoured with Lord Granville's views ' on the general ques- ' tion of the policy to be pursued in connection ' with the Turkish expedition to Nejd.' Those views were stated in a letter fiom the Foreign Office, dated 9th May 1872,1 as follows ' As Ions as Turkey is engaged in upholding its legitimate authority in the Gulf, Her Majesty s 2982. F22 'Government cannot reasonably ask it to ciirtail the means which it considers necessary for doing so. u Her Majesty's Government may, however, fairly say to the Porte that they trust and expect that no attempt will be made to extend that autho rity which would raise questions between the Indian Government and the Porte, the maintenance of the existing state of things in the Gulf and on its borders being considered a matter of great import ance to the general tranquillity of those quarters ; and that the presence of large Turkish armaments is calculated generally to disquiet the bordering countries, and must necessarily cause the British Government to take counteracting steps to reassure the public mind. ' If the presence of an excessive Turkish force requires the Indian Government to increase the British force in the Gulf, the Native mind will see in the latter an encouragement, not only to resist, but to thwart the Porte, and things will go on from bad to worse, till at last, even in the admitted Turkish districts, a general feeling of uneasiness will be produced, and will cost the Porte more to subdue or mitigate than the country is worth.' Sir H. Elliot was instructed * to address the Turkish Government in the above sense, and at the same time to intimate that Her Majesty's Govern ment would ' gladly use their good offices to restore ' peace, and bring matters back to a normal state ' of tranquillity.' The result was reported to Lord Granville by Sir H. Elliot, on the 23rd June 1872, as follows:—f ' Server Pasha repeated the assurance, already so ' often given, of the absence of all intention on ' the part of the Porte of doing more than re- ' establishing their legitimate authority in those ' districts where their right was undisputed, adding ' that Her Majesty's Government might be satis- ■' fied that, since the recall of Midhat Pasha, there &lt;t would be less than ever a disposition to extend ' the field of operations. With regard to the 4t presence of a large Turkish force in the Persian ' Gulf, His Excellency thought Her Majesty's ' Government must be under some misapprehen- *' sion, it being in reality of very insignificant pro- ** portions, amounting in all to four ships of war, *' of which two are ordered to Constantinople to ' refit. The other vessels are hired transports that ' had been taken up for the conveyance of the ' troops sent to the Nejd.' Sir H. Elliot did not elicit from Server Pasha any intimation of a willing ness to accept the proposed good offices of Her Majesty's Government in restoring peace. The correspondence in regard to Nejd now suddenly collapsed in a rather remarkable way, considering the vigour with which it had been con ducted up to this point. The records in this Office do not even indicate either the course of the Turkish expedition, or its ultimate results, so far as the greater part of the interior of the country is con cerned. All that is certain is that the Turks # Home Correspondence, Vol. 70, p. 846. t Despatch, No. 61. Home Correspondence.

' As regards Odeid, my opinion is that it is pro perly subordinate to Aboothabee; but I would let this question, like others, remain in abeyance until we see what really are the meaning and intention of the Turkish Government in striving to occupy the littoral of peninsular Arabia.' The discussion with the Porte in regard to Nejd died out; but it was succeeded in 1873 by a still more acrimonious controversy, provoked by attempts on the part of the Turkish authorities in Yemen, the South-Western district of Arabia, to interfere with the Sultan of Lahej, one of the so- called 44 stipendiary ' Chiefs near Aden who are dependent on the British Government. 1 . i24 Reference to this matter is only necessary here because in the course of the discussion the Porte put forward in plain terms a claim to sovereignty over the whole of Arabia, a claim which, of course, has a material bearing on the question now under consideration, but which, as will be shown, was re jected in decisive terms by Her Majesty's Govern ment. A year before, in December 1872, Sir B. Prere, then on his way to Zanzibar as Special Envoy, for warded to the Poreign Office a memorandum,* by the Rev. Mr. Badger, of tbe conversation which that gentleman had in Paris with M. de Remusat, the Erench Minister for Foreign Affairs, and Server Pasha, then Ottoman Ambassador to Erance. In this memorandum, after observing that ft , om what had passed he inferred that the Porte had ' signified to Erance its claim to the entire seaboard ' of Arabia, extending from Suez to the head of ' the Persian Gulf, and therefore including Oman ' or the principality of Muscat.' Dr. Badger continued;— ' Tbe claim of Turkey to the provinces of Yemen and Nejd, and to the intervening maritime pro vinces, including Oman, is founded on the fiction tbat a lineal descendant of the Abbasside Khalifahs of Baghdad invested Selim II., after his conquest of Egypt and his successes on the shores of the Red Sea, with the sovereignty over the whole of Arabia. It is indisputable, however, that during the existence of that dynasty nearly the whole of Arabia had revolted from its authorities and set up native principalities and chiefdoms, which have maintained their independence until the recent attempts made by the Turks to subjugate them in Yemen and Nejd. All that they can can fairly lay claim to is the seaboard of Arabia from Suez to Mokha, which they have held with occasional intermission since their first conquests in the Red Sea in the 16th century, As regards Oman, the native annals of the province incontestably jirove that it became independent of the Baghdad Kha- lifate in the 10th century, and has never since been subject to foreign rule except for a short time to the Persians. The same is true of the Arab chief doms in the Persian Gulf, whose history is inti mately connected with that of Oman; moreover, it is indisputable that neither the Turks nor the Egyptians have ever exercised any jurisdiction over the territories referred to, and that the Turks them selves, in 1847, virtually admitted the independence of the Imams and other Arab chiefdoms in the Per sian Gulf, is proved in the following extract from a vizierial letter addressed to the Pasha of Baghdad on the subject of the - slave trade as given in Aitchison's Treaties, Vol. VII., page 192 ''Votre Excellence sait qu'il y a dans ces environs la des Gouvernements, et des Imams in- dependants et, cela etant, des chatiments dout il s'agit, ne peuvent pas etre appliques a leurs batiments.'

It remains to notice the correspondence which lias passed since 1874 in reference to the affairs of the Persian Gulf, and to the piratical acts which have made the question of Turkish jurisdiction in those parts an urgent one, and have led the Govern ment of India to put forward the proposals now before the Secretary of State. This can most con veniently be done in a separate paper, which is herewith submitted. A. W. M.

The correspondence is from the period 1870-1874 and is principally between various British Government departments and offices connected to the region, and the Turkish Government.The Turkish expedition called into question the sovereignty and jurisdiction of much of the Arabian Peninsula, as well as the coastline and islands of the Gulf. The correspondence contains discussions of these matters and reflects British fears of a loss of their monopoly over the control and security of the Gulf, and a disruption of the treaty relations they maintained with rulers in Bahrein [Bahrain], Guttur [Qatar], the Trucial Coast, Muscat, and Aden.The author quotes extensively from the correspondence and other sources, notes on which are to be found in the margin throughout.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office, Assistant Secretary to the Political and Secret Department,</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of the Ottoman Empire</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Qatar</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Arabian Peninsula</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Aden</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Muscat</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Persian Gulf</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Trucial Coast</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>El Hassa</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Sovereignty</topic></subject><subject><topic>Imperialism</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000788.0x0003da#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
