Had anv one hut an Enrir^sr made sucii an ^q^rtinn I should not believe iL . Perhaps the masonry round the tail-end of the cable is broken owing to vibration of the cable. (1) . Did Hr. Douglas examine the rock around the anchorage, and did he see any signs of a movement or cracks in the rocks which led feim to believe that the anchorage has given way ? Perhaps it is the case that the cable has stretched a little. (b) . If the rock is giving way at the anchorage it is an extremely grave matter and prompt measures should be taken to save the Bridge from destruction. ( 2 ) I do not think that unequal strains, due to the wind-bracing^ are of any great importance. It might oe advantageous to slacken slightly the cables of the wind-bracing on the downstream side. The expenses of sending Mr. Heed to make an examination would not be very great. He should open the masonry round the anchorage and examine the Thimbles and Turnscrews of the ancnorage. Mr. Heed should also examine the rock inside the anchorage. For this work he will require one mechanic and one inferior mason Two sacks of cement will be needed for replacing the masonry round the anchor. (c). The whole trouble with this Bridge is that there exists no regulation whatever of the Traffic passing over it. ihe rough wear which Godar Bridge is called upon to stand is so appalingly severe that it is not surprising that troubles are continually occurring. THien I left the Bridge in January 1914, the Bridge was in a perfectly sound condition after everything has been done to preserve the Bridge. Over and over again the Bakhtiari Khans have been told that great care should be taken in regulating the passage ox traffic across the Bridge. Sd. B. Botham, 11 December, 1914.f N).

In continuation of my despatch No. 27—174 (Camp), dated 31st August 1914, and my telegram No. 20—93, dated 30th November 1914, from Ahwaz, I have the honour to forward herewith a further report, which, at my request, Mr. Douglas lias submitted to me on the present state of the Lynch Road, dealing with that portion of the road not dealt with together with a review of certain points already dealt with, in his report, dated 4th August 1914. The improvements reported done were effected in response to my letter to the Sirdar-i-Jang, written in connection witli my despatch No. 1—46 (Camp), dated 2nd July 1914, to Your Excellency. I would call especial note to the state of the anchorage of the Rul-i-Shalu, as noted by Mr. Douglas in his report, and have already informed Mr. E. A. Wilson, Messrs. Lynch’s Ahwaz Agent, of the danger of allowing it to remain without proper attention. Similarly, I have warned both Mr. Wilson and the Sirdar-i-Jang of the fact that the crown of the Brick Bridge at Dopulun is sinking and requires attention. Since I last passed over the road, serais have been constructed at Kala Tul, Gazin and Regheva, which is a slight improvement on the old order of things, but, much requires yet to be done before road affairs can be said to be in anything like satisfactory condition. It will be noted that the total cost of repairs from Ahwaz to Ispahan is now estimated at £7,300, and that the cost of converting the present caravan road into a cart road would be £115,000, being a slight reduction on the original estimate of £132,000; while the estimate for a light railway to Malamir has been increased by £75,000, e.g., from 200,000 to 275,000. Mr. Gillespie of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company having now arrived, I am arranging to confer on the matter of the road with him and Messrs. Lynch’s Agent, Mr. E. A. Wilson, with a view to seeing what, if any, joint action they would be willing to take, and to discuss the general question of the road with Mr. Wilson, in the light of the conference which I had with the Sirdar-i- Jang, when in Malamir, en route to Ahwaz, this winter. It being useless to trouble Your Excellency with the details of the conference with the Sirdar-i-Jang alone, without being able to say how far they may be modified by the views of either Mr. Wilson, Mr. Gillespie, or both, I will, in a further despatch, inform Your Excellency of the result of these conversations. India, Fore* on REi/vRi |Mo/ cj, M, dated 4: RiBiDibEnclosure Eo. 2. dated the 11th November 1914. From-P. Gordon Douglas, Esq, of the Persian Railway Syndicate Survey, To— Captain J. G. L. Ranking, His Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consul and Assistant Resident, Ahwaz. As I have recently been over portions of the Lynch Load again including that between Malamir and Nasiri, which I had not previously seen, I can now complete my notes with regard to its condition amphfjii'g my lettei oi the 6th of August to you on this subject. Referring to my previous figures, there are a few additions and correc tions as follows: — Malamir to Sar-i-Tul-Some improvement has been made between 17} and 19 1 miles including the grade at the cr^st at 17f, but these are only of a very temporarv nature, and the first few rains will leave the road no better than before. On the bridge the road surface is badly worn down and the Poor plates have begun to show; this road surfaci &gt;g is a small matter, hut it should be looked to. The anchorage of the back stays on the western side is bad, especially at the north-west end, wdiere one of the stavs has pulled out from the masonry a full inch : this, I think, has occurred since last I went over the bridge. These back stays are anchored in rubble masonry pillars, and their angle with the horizontal is too small. The anchorage should he brought back into the solid rock, or a laro-er angle given so that the actual'“ weight” of the masonry is used to better advantage. I believe, for facility in counting, the bridge is often filled up with loaded animals stressing the bridge heavily. It would be advisable that the road inspectors should be warned as to the condition of the bridge and instructed to report on any further developments. Sar-i-Pul to Between 0 and 4J miles, there are portions not only narrow, but also steep and stony, which need attention. The bad descent to the Bazuft river I previously put at from 6 — 9 miles, but it should be from 7 to 9. There is, however, about 2U0' of bad ascent at 0 miles. Shalil to Sarkhun .— Between 0—2}- miles, there are one or two rather steep portions and the path is very narrow and badly worn, in places hardly giving sufficient footing for one mule, and much worse than the first time I saw it. At 3}, there is 150' of very bad rough road; this is also very much worse, as the waste irrigation water from above has been pouring down this, washing out all earth and small stones. Between 3}—7} 1 describe as “extremely easy ”, it wmuld lie more coneet to change this to “ fair”. With regard to the portion between Malamir and Nasiri, and not in my first report, I will describe as if proceeding from Malamir southward towards Ahwaz, as this was the direction in which 1 travelled. Malamir to Kola 'Ini via Tang-i-Nashalil. —We cross a stream and enter Tang at miles. The approaches to ford w 7 ant a little attention, being rather soft; otherwise there is little to he done. From 3} to the crest of divide at 9? miles the road is rather stony, hut grades easy. We crossed the Nashalil stream (Ab-i-llalagun) eleven times, but only a little work is required to avoid ten of these. From 9} to II ^ we descend and cross by a fair ford, a stream flowing south-west; a little work will be required as the approaches, especially to left bank, are steep. We are now in Kala Tul plain, and from here on to the fort at 15 miles the road is easy ; a few places require raising and ditching. Kala Tul to Jl Khurshid. —At ore mile the road is very soft indeed and wants diteliing on upper side, but it might be as well to take road up hipef on side hills up to 1} miles. Between 2 miles some work is lequiren, especially at 2}, where there is some 500' of very rough stony ground. At 4 &gt; we reach plain, which is level, up to the village of A1 Khurshid at 7 Just opposiie village and for a quarter of a mile on, the road is sunk some lo below plain level; the ground is clay, and the grade rather steep ; this when wet is almost impassable for animals, and wants widening, regrading, raisii‘o and ditching.Al Khurshld fo Cheshmeh Raughani .—Crossed river at J mile by ford, which would prove difficult in flood time. Ascent up from river very bad and steep; too narrow for caravans to pass without danger; we ourselves only just avoided a bad accident to some animals and men. Up to miles, the road is bad and in places very bad; there are several little streams to cross, which in the rains become torrents, and while crossing one of these, one of our men was washed away and drowned. Some of these streams are in the bottom of small gulleys, and the road approaches to all these are very bad, as here the road acts as a tributary, the water pouring down washing out all loose material, leaving rough uneven rock. At 6J miles we crossed a stream 60' wide (after heavy rain), and this would be difficult in high flood. The ascent up from this is again very bad, and the road to 7J miles is very narrow as well as rough. This portion wants improving badly. Trom 7f to Hi the road on the whole is much easier, but there are again several gulleys to cross, all with bad approaches. From Hi to Cheshmeh Faughani at l3i the road is easy. Cheshmeh Raughani to Jaru .—Over this portion we have alternate portion 3 of fairly easy plain and rolling gypsum hills, with one or two streams to cross- Some of the hill portions are bad, this is specially true between and 2i miles and at about 9 miles. We reach Jaru at 13i miles, after two miles of easy country. Jaru to Reghiva .—Here again the road alternates between fairly easy plain and gypsum hills. The roughest part is between If- and 6J, and there is a bad ascent at 7 miles, and a bad descent near 9 miles. We pass the Gazin caravanserai at 13J miles in flat easy country, we cross one more range of gypsum hills and reacU plain of Arabistan at 19J. The portion through these last hills is winding, hut grades are ea&lt;y ; sme work required through- out. From 19£ to 23J grades aud road easy, one or two soft portions requiring some raising and ditching. Reghiva to Weis .—Easy and almost level road. S ime sand hills to cross where the going is very heavy; this is especially so at 8 miles. Also at 8J the stream is cutiing into its left bank and encroaching on road. Some places soft, requiring raising and ditching, the worst place being near 13J miles. We reacti Weis at 22J. JFeis to Ahioaz .—Flat and easy. Some drainage required and resurfacing of portions of road. Distance about H| miles. I was again impressed with the bad state of the caravanserais.. The only ones, and these are new, that have any accommodation for even natives, are at Malamir, Kala Tul, Gazin and Reghiva. Good serais should be built, and, in each one, one or two rooms set aside for the use of Europeans, and some sheltered stabling should be provided. The cost of putting the road between Malamir and Ahwaz into good repair for caravan traffic I should put approximately as follows:— £ ]Vlabmir-Kala Tul ... • • • ... ... ... 150 KalaTul-Al Khurshid • •• ... ... ... 150 Al Klmrsh id-Cheshmeh Raughani ... • • • ... 600 Cheshmeh Raughani-Jaru ... ... ... ... 300 Jaru-Reghiva ... ... ... ... 275 Reghiva-Weis ... ... • • • ... 50 Weis-Ahwaz ... ... • •• Total ... 25 ... 1,550 Grand total for the whole road of 5,800 plus 1,550—£ 7,350. Fora cart road, I should say from Malamir to Ahwaz, would cost in region of £35,000, making a total for whole road of £80,000 plus £35,000=£115,000. The question of a light railway I have not gone into very much, but I should say now having seen the road that from Ahwaz up to Malamir the cost would be somewhere about £275,000.

No. 20—478, dated the 12th December 1914. From- -Captain J. G. L. Ranking, His Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consul and Assistant Resident, Ahwaz, To—His Majesty's Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of His Imperial Majesty the Shah of Persia, Tehran. In continuation of my despatch, No. 15—447, dated 5th December 1914, I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that I have discussed the question of the Lynch Hoad re-organization with Mr. E. A. Wilson, Messrs. Lynch Brothers’ Ahwaz Agent. The first decision arrived at was that Mr. Wilson wished to examine, from the point of view of his own firm, and report to them on all schemes affecting the Lynch K, ad prior to considering the question of any joint action with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. We discussed, the general question of re-organization on the lines of the scheme reported in my despatch, No. 1—46, dated 2nd July 1914, the older of which I will adhere to for facility of reference. We considered the question of road surface, and Mr. Wilson agreed with me that it was in a had state and required considerable attention. I informed him that the estimated cost of putting it into repair was £7,300, as reported in my despatch No. 15—447 of 5th December 1914. Similarly, as regards caravanserais, we were agreed that they were required to be built at the following places :— Chashma-i-Roughani, Kharaji; and Ardal; and that the existing ones should be repaired at— Sar-i-Pul, costing about 1,000 Tomans, Shalil ,, a »&gt; Sarkhun „ it a »» Dopulun „ jj 400 „ ; and that later, caravanserais should be also built at— Al Khurshid, and Naghun. Of these Shalil and Sarkhun are the most important and should be taken in hand as soon as possible. Kharaji has house accommodation, but insufficient, and being the junction of an alternative route, in the summer, with the Lynch Road proper, should have adequate accommodation ; especially vis-a-vis the treatment meted out to caravans by the inhabitants of Shamsh- abad, the home of Yusuf Khan, Amir-i-Mujahid, which is half a stage neaier Ispahan. It appears to be the policy in Shamshabad to discourage caravans from stopping there. The inhabitants refuse to sell supplies, and, if caravans try to stop, having brought their own supplies with them, the muleteers are treated to personal violence and beaten.) 2 // f On this account, muleteers stop when possible at Kharaji, in addition to using it as a junction. Ardal will become an important stage in a diversion, which I have suggested to Mr. Wilson, and which I deal with later in this despatch. The buildings at Naghun and A1 Khurshid are merely for convenience and could easily be left till later. While on the question of buildings, we also discussed the question of bridges on the road. I re-iterated my warning regarding the Pul-i-Shalu anchorage, and Mr. Wilson informed me he had already taken steps in the matter. I also mentioned that the road-way plates of both this and the Amarat bridges were exposed and required covering with earth. Another point which I mentioned was a twisting of the Pul-i-Shalu, due, in my opinion, to unequal tension in the wind bracing. I also told Mr. Wilson that I had told the Ilkhani that he should have the brick bridge at Dopulun, the crown of which was sinking, attended to, and a new bridge built over the Sabza Kuh river, to replace the one washed avvny in the spring rises this year. We also decided that, in view of the diversion above mentioned, a brick or stone bridge will be required at the place where the road, after passing northwards through the Darkash Warkash, crosses the Ab-i-Junaghun at the head of the defile. As regards the forts, I told Mr. Wilson that, as they were at present, they were useless, and that I agreed with the Sirdar-i-Jang’s policy of getting to the root of the evil at once and reducing the Kuhgelus to order, rather than spend ing large sums of money on forts, which the raiding parties could get round. We next discussed the question of supplies on the road. On this point we did not see eye to eye. I advocated Messrs. Lynch taking in hand the whole fodder supply of the road, while Mr. Wilson said that he was not prepared to do more than fodder their own caravans in the 6 hill marches. We each had our reasons for considering our own scheme the most advantageous. My reasons are known to Your Excellency; Mr. Wilson’s main reason w^as that his scheme afforded him an easy means of testing the proposition without any risk. He met me by saying that, should his scheme prove a success, he would expand it into the scheme i advocate of foddering all caravans on the whole road. The question of protection I did not touch on, beyond what I have said above, as I consider it a matter entirely between His Majesty’s Government and its representatives on the one hand and the Ilkhani of the Bakhtiaris on the other. Mr. W ilson stated that he was perfectly satisfied with the state of the road on this point. He also informed me that he has abolished the Hoad Inspectors as being too costly and not worth the 25-30 tomans paid to each of them monthly. I referred the matter of the “ dokash ” system to him—which he said was difficult to stop also the suggestion to dump goods on the destination side of the Burra Murda Pass in early winter. Your Excellency will recollect that in my despatch. No. 17—140, dated 17th August 1914, 1 reported that I intended to try and find a diversion, which could be used in the winter as an alternative to using the Burra Murda 1 ass, w Inch becomes closed for a certain period of the winter. I have now found what I consider might be a feasible alternative. The point of diver gence is Sarkhun, whence the road passes through the Tang-i-Hazar Jarib to GanduniKar, thence via the Tang-i-Mamu to Sar-i-Maur, and on to Ardal, via Kaj. From Ardal the road would pass through the Tang-i-Darkash Warkash and rejoin the Lynch Hoad at Kharaji. I have given Mr. Wilson full intormation, with heights and distances, etc., and suggested to him that he send somebody to inspect the diversion on his behalf. , suggested route is one short march longer than the present one, avoids the woist place on the Lynch Hoad in the winter I also suggested another alternative route for regular summer use. but3 In this case the point of divergence is Bopulun,—thence to Ardal, thence via the road made by the Sirdar-i-Muhatsham to Silagun, rejoining the Lynch Road at the latter place. Mr. Wilson thought favourably of both suggestions, and, I believe, is writing to his London Office on the subject. TVe now come to the most difficult aspect of the case—the financial question, which, besides being the most difficult, is also the deciding factor. The amount of money required for the re-organization scheme is not very large, but the difficulty is who is to find it. According to Mr. Douglas* estimate, it will cost £7,300 to put the road in a proper state of repair ; then, at the lowest estimate, it will cost £2,200 to build the new and effect the necessary repairs to existing caravanserais; repairs to and construction of new bridges will probably cost not less than £500 ; while necessary work on tne proposed deversions would probably cost not less than £600—in all, I let us say, of £11,000. That is to say, about a whole year’s bridge tolls in a normally good year. On the question of finance, the Sirdar-i-Jang tells me that the Khans would not be willing to find any such sum, either in part or in toto, though they are willing to allocate some sum annually from bridge takings for maintenance and upkeep of road. Mr. Wilson tells me that Messrs. Lynch Brothers would not either find any or all of the money, unless the administration of the road were to be put into their hands. Personally I think, if Messrs. Lynch were to find some of j the money required, the Khans could be talked into finding the rest, but Messrs. Lynch would, no doubt, still demand the administration of the road, and this is a question which would inter-act with the whole of our general policy in South-west Persia. Air. Wilson is, I understand, writing to his London Office his views on the re-organization scheme above dealt with, besides such other schemes as cart or motor road to Ispahan, via the Fields, etc., etc. When discussing the question with Sirdar-i-Jang, he showed himself very willing to help and to meet my wishes. 1 informed him of urgent repairs, for the execution of which he issued orders immediately. I brought the unsatisfactory state of the supply question to his notice, and demanded the punishment of two of the “ dalundars ”, the story of whose exactions had reached me. The Sirdar showed them no mercy and they got their deserts. Their fate should have a salutary effect on others of their kidney. I suggested to His Excellency the Ilkhani that, till the re-organized fodder scheme materialised, he might, with advantage, put the whole supply of the road under one man. I suggested his Nazir, Haji Ali, whom I know, and think would do it well and fairly honestly. The Sirdar said he would try to arrange it as I desired ; meanwhile he would issue stringent orders to “ dalundars ” to sell only at the fixed prices and with the authorised weights. The Sirdar admitted that, by putting all supplies under one man, to whom all “ dalundars ” would be responsible, the supply question would probably be ameliorated and prices kept more w ithin bounds, but, stated that there were certain caravanserais and villages en route, which were the private property of various of the Khans, and in these he could not interfere, viz .:— Dopulun, Naghun Shamshabad Kharaji Kaverukh the property of Sirdar-i-Fateh, ,, Munazarn-ul-Mulk, ,, Amir-i-Mujahid, „ Amir»i-Muffakham, „ Aluntazim-ud-Dowleh. In the above cases there are only two remedies:— (i) get the caravanserai or village put officially under the Sirdar-i- Jang, and this, I am afraid, is impossible ; (ii) make the owners themselves issue orders that the sale of supplies must conform to the rest of the road. I have written to the Khans concernei, or their resident Agents, and would suggest, should any of them be in or visit Tehran, that the matter be personally impressed on them also.4 I raised one other point with the Sirdar. Since 1909, I have been trying to get a permanent settlement of the Bakhtiaris at Gandumkar, at the foot of the Burra Murda Pass, but only partially succeeded before I left in 1911. I have now taken up the matter again. A settlement is absolutely necessary here, especially if the Burra Murda Pass is to be used at all in the winter. ^ In conclusion, I would say that my recommendation is that Messrs. Lynch £ Brothers, London, should digest the various schemes put forward and come to some decision, particularly with regard to the financial aspect of the case, as to what they are prepared to do. After which, when I have been informed of what they wish done, I will do my best to negotiate the matter with the Bakhtiari Khans for them. foreign k Politic*!

Owing to a mis- interprelation of the obligations undertaken by Messrs. Lynch Brothers (the predecessors of this Company) under the terms of the agreement with the Chiefs, tney refused to pay more than Krans 300,000 or £5,500 and His Majesty’s Government did not see their way to support Messrs Lynch Brothers claim for the full amount expended on the road, the result being that the Bakhtiari Chiefs are gainers and this Company are losers of £3,000. 2. Under Secretary of state, Foreign Office.2. Since the road was opened in the year 1900 this Company have not received one penny of profit out of the undertaking while the Company’s Directors and their staff have given their services gratuitous ly to the development of the route in spite of the dilatory and obstructive policy adopted by the Chiefs, and the frequent criticisms of His Majesty's Consular Officials, who doubtless in ignorance of tne terms of the agreement with the Chiefs, attribute the present condition of the road to this Company's want of enter prise. 3. The terms of the agreement with the Cniefs have not been carried out by them, inasmuch as they have not kept the road in repair - a condition they expressly undertook under Clause No.IV of the agree ment, nor have they set aside any money out of their toll revenue for the purpose of repairs. The annual instalments of repayment of capital and interest have been frequently delayed and two instalments are now in arrears. It may be excusable to draw attention to the fact that the Chiefs were quick to seize the advantage they gained in receiving the support of His Majesty's Government when disputing the claim for payment of tne full cost of construction of the road; they have shown no disposition to comply with the repeated requests of His Majesty's Minister at Teheran to carry out the terms of the agreement in regard to the repairs of the road. Having regard to the unsatisfactory nature of past experience my Directors consider that they are justi fied in asking for a clear understanding of the obliga tionsobligations this company is expected to fulfil in regard to the proposal put forward in the letter under acknow- ledgnent, and also in regard to the future development of the whole of the trade route from Ahwaz to Teheran, before committing themselves to any undertaking, and they respectfully suggest that the Chairman of this company should be allowed an early opportunity to discuss the whole question with His Majesty's Government with this object in view.

(No&gt; \ (January 11, 9-20 p.m.) V MINISTER for Foreign Affairs came to see me yesterday to talk about Persia. His Excellency, who seemed greatly depressed, commenced by saying that were it not for the war he would place his resignation into the Emperor’s hands as the only means of escaping from impossible situation. He attached even greater value to close relations with England than with France, and all his personal feelings prevented his nursuing a policy' contrary to ours. He could not, however, march m line with us if we continued to regard Russia with inveterate suspicion. We refused to recognise her vested rights and interests in North Persia, and, forgetful of process by which we had acquired our Empire in Asia, we opposed the slightest extension of Russian influence for fear of it bringing her nearer India. He had often enough been told what Russia might not do, but he would like to know what we would allow her to do and what was the definite policy of His Majesty’s Government m Persia. Natural deduction to be drawn from creation of spheres of influence m 190/ was that neither of us was entitled to interfere with what the other did in his sphere, but we had never observed this rule. If we thought our sphere too small he would let us extend it, and partition of neutral sphere was, in his opinion, the most practical solution. ^ were opposed to this owing to our mistrust of Russia and to fear of anything m the shape a coterminous frontier. , , . . , I said it was but natural that we as an island kingdom should not desire to see India limitrophe with any Great Power, however friendly our feelings for that Power might be. We had even objected to being connected with France by a channel tunnel. Statesmen had to look ahead, and we should have to provide for defences o India even were it our friend and ally who was India s next^oor neighbour B was not fear of bringing Russia nearer to India, but the fact t a y _ your signature to an agreement under which Persian integrity anc in p , , to be maintained that made you unwilling to adopt a course a vou ^ t first step towards the partition of Persia. We did not dispute Russia s predommant position in North Persia, and if she would only respect iegitimate susceptibditi^ o^ Persian Government, Russia’s interests there could be amp y sa eg word of complaint on our part. When the time came for revision ^ define ment we ought, instead of embarking on a policy of parti ron, neutral more precisely our respective rights and obligations bot i m oui SPh Teferring to the next complaint his Excellency has recently made aW Ae Persian Government, I said that latter, in asking Russian overn . , honest their troops, had not been prompted by any hostile feeling o u ’ Russian desire to prevent Turkish advance into Persia, which had since a „ P . t j ie military authorities seemed to have so ignored real situation a , was j n preceding evening the acting military attache had been informe '^HTExcellency admitted that he himself had not kept accurately^ormed of the intentions of military authorities, and stated that t ere &lt; declined orders and counter-orders sent to general in command at Tabriz He Oeclmea altogether to accept my defence of conduct of Persian Om emm i , j sav they were of persistently pursuing an anti-Russian policy, m which e + re '» , savin «■ that encouraged bv His Majesty’s Legation. I denied this latter ^^ement sa^ym^Uiat support which Sir W. Townley had given to request for withdrawal of R P had been fully justified by what had taken place since. [121—407j2 Minister for Foreign Affairs then said that he had had a long conversation with Shoa-es-Sultaneh, and that, though he did not place implicit confidence in him or any Oriental, he had been struck by his intimate knowledge of all that was going on in Persia. Speaking of the present Government, Shoa had remarked that they were unlit to cope with a critical situation like the present, but that Russia would not be able to get rid of them by herself, and that in order to do so she must secure co operation of England. Unfortunately his Highness had added that everybody at Tehran knew that the two legations no longer worked together, and from all that he had heard M. Korostovetz was not the proper man to represent Russia at Tehran. Referring next to your telegram No. 26 of 8th January 7 , contents of which I had 1 , communicated to him in a private letter, his Excellency said that Ala-es-Snltaueh and his son must go. I then told him that in a conversation which I had had with Minister of Finance on preceding day I had spoken to his Excellency on the subject of an advance. In reply to question which he had addressed to me about suggested amount I had told him that you had not specified it in your telegram, but that Persian Minister had informed me that his Government was asking Russia and Great Britain to advance 300,000?. each. His Excellency had replied that as Minister of Finance he was opposed to any advance, but that if Minister for Foreign Affairs considered it necessary, he thought he might consent to one of 200,000?. Minister for Foreign Affairs said that he would speak to Minister of Finance, and gave me to understand that he would agree to advance this amount provided that changes desired were effected in Persian Government.jThis Document is the Property of His ftritan nic Majesty^ Governm/ift , and * should be returned to. the Foreign Office when done with unless required for official usej RUSSIA ^ ’ * \s' i ZQ LITJCA J,. Cypher Telegram to Sir G. Buchanan (Petrograd) Foreign Office, January 18th, 1915. 6.45.p.m. No. 67. Your telegram No. 38. The question of extension of Russian or British in fluence respectively in Persia has not entered into any thing I have said about Persia since war began. I have been anxious that Russia should not quarrel with Persia or be aggressive to Persian Government, solely because the effect in uniting all Mussulmans on Turkish side might cause trouble in India and Egypt/that would im pair our strength in the war in Europe. Also it seemed to me that the action of Russian Of ficials in Northern Persia was not calculated to serve Rus sian interests against Turkey. I thought there were two possible courses for Russia to pursue.* 1. To send sufficient Russian troops to drive Turks out of Azerbaijan and stop their advance into Northern Persia. 2. To withdraw Russian troops and get credit at Teheran for doing so, thereby either securing opposition c Persians to Turks or else if Persian Government did not re sist the Turks and sided with them acquiring the right for Russia to take things into her own hands later on when she was abier to do so. The employment of Shuja seemed worse than useless, because it began with a quarrel with the Persian Government and was bound to end in failure against Turkey. WhetherWhether Russia adopted course 1 or 2 it was for her to decide, but it is unfortunate that the Russian officials did not adopt either. They have now incurred the odium of having used Shuja against the will of Persian Government, the withdrawal of Russian troops has taken place but Russia has got no credit for it at Teheran, on the contrary it ap pears to. Persian Government as if they owed the withdrawal to the advance of the Turks, I would therefore earnestly ask Minister for Foreign Affairs to believe that any suggestions I have made about Persia during the war have been influenced by a feeling of the solidarity of Russian and British interests in the war and a belief that neither Russian nor British interests were being served by the policy pursued by Russian official in Persia, For rne the sole consideration is whether policy pur sued in Persia is likely' to help or hinder the progress of t |l the war. During the war the Persian question does not iij exist for me apart from its effect on the war. I hope that Russian victories in the Caucasus will far outweigh strategically any ground gained by Turkey in Persia, but I fear that Turkey has gained a certain diplo matic footing and goodwill in Persia that may be embarrass ing in the I Mussulman world generally, which is a matter of serious consequence to us. What military steps can be taken to recover lost 'round it is for Russia to decide. f Diplomatically I can see nothing except to attach Persian Government to our side by meeting the pressing re- quest that they are making for an advance of £100,000, !e rould advance half of this if Russia agreed to advance the ■vblier. Does Minister for Foreign Affairs think this desirable and if so on what conditions? It is no good mking stiff or disagreeable conditions now, if we are to mike the advance at all.

I have the honour to address Your Excellency in continuation of my despatch No. 9 - 88 , dated 18 th July 1914 ; from further information received, which is independently corroborated by His Majesty’s Consul-General, Ispahan, it appears that the Russian party are still persevering in their efforts to win Kan-ul-Mamalik over to their cause. Latterly—within the last fortnight or so—two attempts have been made by the Mullah-i-Daulatabadi, Sayed-ul-lraquain and others of the same party to interest Kafi-ul-Mamalik in assisting to engineer demonstrations against bamsam -us-Sultana, the Governor-General of Ispahan, which however have failed for the present. In pursuance of the instructions received some ten days previously, from Sardar-i Jang, Kafi-ul-Mamalik left Ispahan yesterday morning en route for Chighakhor and Surk. At the former place he has been instructed to go into Bakhtiari Revenue affairs, on Sardar-i-Jang’s behalf, with Sardar-i-Bahadur, the Acting Ilbegi, and at the latter place to inspect the Sardar-i-Jang’s private estates and see that everything is in order. Shortly before leaving, Kafi-ul-Mamalik came to take his leave of me. As far as I was able to gauge his temper, he was bitterly disappointed at the question of the Ispahan Governorship dues being yet unsett ed and annoyed at the non possumus attitude taken up by the Governor-General. The latest news from Bakhtiari sources is to the effect that the Schneider gun f ro m Shiraz, with a gun team of eight, and a.Gendamene escort of 20 men under a Non-commissioned officer, is due to arrive in Behbahan in a day or two, and that the Sardar-i-Jang’s movements are again uncertain—that he may now carry out his original plan of coming to Chighakhor via Deh Dasht. If I am correct in my estimate of the Kafi-ul-Mamalik s frame of mind, I foresee that he may, if he meets the Sardar-i-Jang, advise him to resign the post of Ilkhani of the Bakhtiaris on the grounds (i) that he has had to meet large expenses and has received none of his share of the Ispahan revenues, which were guaranteed to him, (ii) that by so doing he may get a Governorship elsewhere more lucrative and ouUi 4 €&amp;s.jvorry attaching to it than to his present post. 30 NOV 15 %, ^ iL India, Fdre^ii Secretary’s No 4: 5 ’ dated ^ MOV i914The question of the payment or non payment by the Samsam-us-Saltana to the Sardar-i*Jang of a share of the Ispahan revenues is not within my jurisdiction, and only concerns me indirectly in its effect on the Sardar*i*Jang s policy, but I consider I should be failing in my duty, if I did not warn Your Excellency that it is my opinion, based on the tone of correspondence, which has passed between the Sardar-i-Jang and myself, that he is rather sore over the non-payment of his share of the Ispahan dues, and that I consider it to be quite possible that he would follow such advice in a fit of pique. From conversations which I have had with His Majesty’s Consul-General, Ispahan, I am aware that it has not been desirable to press the point, on account of the danger of the Samsam-us-Sultana resigning the Governorship in consequence. I further understand that, although the Russian Government is pressing for Samsam-us-Saltana’s recall, the matter has not yet been finally decided ; it may therefore still be undesirable to press the question of payment on the Samsam-us- Saltana’s notice. It is, however, equally desirable that Sardar-i-Jang should receive some reassurance, so that he may continue whole heartedly to carry out the onerous duties of Ilkhani, to the benefit of British interests, and not remain in a frame of mind favourable to the reception of bad advice. I mistrust Kafi-ul-Mamalik, and should like to re-assure the Sardar-i-Jang, before the former can bring his influence to bear upon him. Will your Excellency authorise me to inform the Sardar-i-Jang, that the ques tion of his share of the Ispahan Governorship dues has not been lost sight of by His Majesty’s Legation, and will be dealt with at a suitable moment in a manner which will ensure to him his just share ? Such an assurance will, l hope, put the Sardar’s mind at rest, and at the same time leave the settlement of the question entirely in the hands of His Majesty’s Legation, to be effected whenever the moment is considered favourable.

M. the Shah of Persia, Tehran. In continuation of my despatch No. 1-46 of 1914, dated 2nd July 1914, page 9, paragraph 4, I have the honour to submit herewith Mr. Douglas’ report on the Lynch Road, and his rough estimates of the cost of the various alternative projects I had in mind for the improvement of same. His report is of interest as it corroborates, from a technical point of view, the opinion expressed in my above quoted despatch. To put the road into a fit state of repair for caravans, he estimates a total sum ofXs 800 will be required; from this sum must be deducted £450 on account of repair of road, which lies outside the Bakhtiari Country, between Kaf-i-Rukh and Ispahan, and about £300 added for repairs to the section from the Arabistan- Bakhtiari border at Gardan-i-Alwaniyeh to Malamir, which Mr. Douglas did not traverse—making a net sum of ^5,600 in round numbers, on account of repairs to existing road within the Bakhtiari Country. Now with regard to making the road possible for cart or motor service and other projects, which were touched on in my above quoted despatch. It is estimated that it would cost a total sum of ^1,32,000 to make the road fit for motor traffic throughout, from Ahwaz to Ispahan. If, however, as suggested in paragraph 3, page 9 of my despatch No, 1-46, Messrs Lynch Brothers, Limited and Messrs, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company were to combine, the total cost of making a combined cart and caravan road would come to less, vis. ^61,000. This is arrived at thus Messrs, the Anglo Persian Oil Company intend to build a new cart road from Ahwaz to the Fields for their own use 1 he use of this having been arranged for, to continue the cart road thence to Malamir would Cost £30,000. From Malamir to Shalamzar or Dehkurd we should have a caravan road, costing A°oo to put into a proper state of repair and from the caravan terminus to Ispahan a cart toad, cotsing £26,000 making in all a total of £61,000. If we consider the question of a light railway to Malamir and a cart road thence to Ispahan, the total cost would be £2,82,000 exclusive of rolling stock ■ &amp; \ 30 NOV 19 ! 4 i C123FD India, F i'RE No 45: bE~RETARY3 datedthus, light railway from Ahwaz to Malamir 2,00,000, cart road from Malamir to Ispahan ^82,000. As a matter of interest I asked Mr. Douglas what the cost of a railway from Ahwaz to Ispahan would be. In reply he gave me the following figures:— Ahwaz to Malamtr £2,00,000, Malamir to Shalamzar £7,00,000, making a total sum of £9,00,000 from Ahwaz to practically the Bakhtiari Ispahan border. If we allow £2,00,000 for the remaining section to Ispahan, the total cost from Ahwaz to Ispahan w r ould be £1,000,000. I have received news today that the Sardar-i-fang. Ilkhani of the Bakhtiaris intends to remain in Behbahan, and not to come up to the high country at all this season ; I shall therefore have to leave the discussion of road matters with him till later in the year. On return to Ahwaz, I shall discuss the whole question with Messrs. Lynch Brothers’ Agent there and see if they are willing to take the question in hand, with a r to view remedying defects and improving the situation by such means as may be possible. Mr. Douglas’ report has been submitted as it stands; no corrections either of place, names or distances having been made—with the exception of the addition of names in the margin to define localities and render comparison possible with the route report on the Lynch Road already given in the Report on South West Persia, Volume VI. As the financial aspect of the question is the deciding factor, I can make no recommendations till I have seen Messrs. Lynch Bros . Agent in Ahwaz, and found out what they are prepared to do and how far, if at all, Messrs. Strick Scott &amp; Co., ^Messrs, the Anglo Persian Oil Company), are prepared to co-operate. Such a combination, if it could be arranged, would make infinitely better use of the possibilities of the Lynch Road, than Messrs. Lynch Bros, alone are at the present doing. The whole system of the road requires overhauling and rejuvenating, and the administration the infusion of some ‘‘ push”, which hitherto it has sadly lacked. I say this without in any way reflecting on Mr. E. A. Wilson, Messrs. Lynchs’ Ahwaz Agent, whom I believe to be as anxious as I myself am, to get road affairs in a satisfactory condition. While on the subject I venture to say what I have so many times before said, that so long as IV essrs. Lynch Bros’. London Office persists in their niggardly and shortsighted policy of understaffing their Ahwaz Office, and having only a Persian in charge of their Ispahan Office, so long will the Lynch Road not only fail to be a success, but also deterioate from day to day. The road in all its aspects may be as satisfactory as it is possible to make it, but without sufficiently and efficiently staffed officers at each end, it cannot be fed in a manner to make the most of its potentialities, and to make it respond to efforts made to ensure its success. Copy of a letter dated 4th August 1914, from Mr, P.G. Douglas of Messrs. S. Pearson &amp; Son, Ltd., whose services are at present lent to Messrs, the Railway Syndicate, to Captain Ranking, His Majesty's Vice-Consul, Ahwaz % Camp Ispahan, With regard to the state of the road between Ahwaz and Ispahan, I have, as you requested, taken a few notes on my way up and herein embody these notes in a description of the Lynch Road as it appeared to me on my journey up here between 20th June and 7th July. You have also asked me for figures in connec tion with the putting of the present road into decent repair. I append a few figures in this connection, but these are necessarily very approximate, as I have not gone into the question in anything like sufficient detail to give accurate figures. The mileages referred to below are arrived at from the time taken between the various points and the estimated rates of speed, these latter naturally varying considerably according to the type of country traversed.f To Malamir. Journeying from Maidan-i-Naftun we struck the Lynch Road about three (i) At Haiagun, see pages 1567, Malamir. niiles before reaching the large Karavan- ^l« i S''B^^ byR,okine ' ser * f, Malamir (,). For this three . miles (1) the road is quite good for pack animals, though the small stones on the road would make it somewhat rough for carts. &amp; For some distance back from where we actually joined the main road we got a fairly good view of it; it was apparently quite good for at least three miles before we struck it, but whether the ford across the Ab-i-Halagun is passable in the rains I cannot say. This river apparently rises in the hills on the South side of the valley before the latter joins up with the Malamir plain proper. There is a drainage divide 2 miles before reaching the Malamir Serai, but heavy rain (2) Bed of stream broad, and as far as i know round the district should give a rapid and ''' impM, * b,e for ,&lt;&gt;n *- heavy rise in this stream (2). The Karavanserai at Malamir belongs to the Bakhtiari Khans (3) it is large (3) Munt azs ,m-un.Dowieh. in the area covered built of locally made brick. It is well built but now beginning to fall into disrepair. There are no rooms fit for European travellers and but little sheltered stabling. Fresh water is plentiful, but that near the building is not of the best. Previous caravans have made all the ground in the immediate vicinity of the Serai in a pretty dirty state, and there are naturally plenty of flies and mosquitoes. Malamir to Sarpul. Leaving Malamir the road in summer is good for the first 6 miles, but from about 2J-3 miles the road shows every appearance of being flooded during the rains; this portion should be raised up and a causeway built at least 2 above the present level ; other portions may also require raising, but not to so great an extent. At 6 miles we cross a shingle bed, which should not give much difficulty even in the rains. At 6 miles we climb up a range reaching the top (4) o,td.n.i.s.,r.it. at 8 miles (4). Grades here are not too heavy, and a considerable amount of work has been done here originally, but I should say that nothing in the shape of maintenance has been attempted. The surface is at present very bad, consisting of very uneven rocks and stones, in some places steps would be preferable to the existing conditions. This surface could be made level, but unless done carefully and well the maintenance would always be heavy. From 8-ioJ miles the road is much better and could be put right with very little expense. Two small shingle beds are crossed. At io| miles we cross /r . p . . _ , . e , . another stream bed, and begin to descend a (5) ravine, and at 123 miles reach the bot tom ; the descent is steep but not excessive, but the surface is very bad indeed and a considerable amount of work will be required to put this right. It is similar to the length between 6 and 8 miles, only more so. 123-163- the road is fair as regards surface, but is in some places too narrow for karavans to pass with safety and should be widened. A stream is crossed three times and two of the crossings look as if a bridge might be required during the rains. From (6) the surface is fair, but the road narrows here, however, the width is not of so much consequence as the ground traversed is much less steep. The last 150' however is at an exceedingly steep grade and this portion should be improved as soon as possible. From i7|*i9J (Bridge) (7) the descent is somewhat steep and the surface far from good ; this latter is however easily improved. The two approaches to the bridge, especially the Malamir side, are disgraceful; they are too steep and exceedingly rough, and should be altered ; the bridge itself appeared in good condition, its camber is however rather flat. No wind bracing beyond the floor4 system seems to have been put in originally, but recently various tie rods have (8) Page 16, Ahwaz d;*p»tch No. I.-4&lt;5» dated been erected. The Serais ( 8 ) here are two and July 1914. in number. The upper one was deserted at the time and in a filthy state. It consists of two or three small rooms and very J) small covered stables ; the courtyard wall is only some 2' 6' high and it must be very bad in winter, i he lower one is very small and has no courtyard and very little level ground round it on which to picket animals. Both are built of mud and some stone. Fodder available in small quantities, but several karavans would clear them out. I believe the nearest supplies are 7-8 miles away. Sarpul to Deh-Diz. From the Serai to 4! miles (9) the grades are fair but the road in places is far too narrow and should be widened (9) Pages 157-9, Deh Diz, ‘ BaMuan R ep° rt . as at present it-is extremely difficult for two loaded mules to pass each other in some of the places. From 42—13! (Deh Diz) the road is good and on a gradually ascending grade. We cross four ravines, which entail some rise and fail but even here the grades are quite respectable ; six shingle beds are crossed, but these all have very small watersheds and I do not think would give any trouble during wet weather. The karavansarai at Deh Diz is well situated, but in summer most of the karavans camp near the spring up on the hill side above the village. Plenty of fodder available with excellent water. Deh-Diz to Shalil. Deh-Diz is on the (10) Gardan-i-Deh Diz, or buland. slopes of a range; we climb immediately up a steep Gardan-i-Belut ascent with surface rather soft and sandy and reach first crest (10) at 1 mile. 1—3 miles is very fair and suiface good with easy grades, but at some places the camber is bad and might be improved with very little work. From 3—4f miles is a steep descent and the surface is alternately soft and sandy and is on whole poor and needs improvement. From 4J—6 miles is ascent, surface not bad but road is again on steep hill side giving a camber of 1 —6, in many places no attempt has been made to cut out any sort of road. For the last 200' the grades are excessive and the surface very rough and should be improved as soon as pos- , . r . . D sible. 6—o miles is very steep (n) and very rough. This length is the worst m the road, and dangerous to animals ; this whole section should be regraded and a better surface obtained ; it was originally built with too steep grades. The last 1J miles is especially bad, as are also both approaches to the bridge (9 miles). (i 2 ) 1 , 4&lt; From the bridge at 9 miles to the serai at 11 miles (12) the road is fair except for the last } mile which requires some improvement. A stream has to be crossed if one wishes to camp in or immediately round the serai. This serai is built of stone and in very bad repair, and is I think the worst on the road, there is practically no stabling and only two habitable rooms which have recently been built. When we were there we could get no barley, wheat or tibbin owing they said to several large karavans having been through during the last few days. There was tibbin within two miles over a hilly path and barley some two hours’ journey away and then in limited quantities. Shalil to Sarhun. From Shalil to 2J the road or rather the pass (13) is narrow but grades are (13) Along the bank of the Ab-i-shaiii. eas y« a good deal of rise and fall has been ,, . put in to avoid a few pounds work.

From 0 - 3 } the road is rough and ascends fairly steeply. The first part is rinse to a stream bed, whose drainage area is, however, small At 3 } we are on top of the hill ( 15 ) and from here to 4 J (t 5 ) Gardan-i-Gandum Kar. the road is fairly level except for one rather sharp descent which might be eased off. From 4J we descend to 5} where we cross a stream bed, which might contain a fair volume of water during flood. From 5i-7f we ascend valley at easy grade with fair surface most of the way. There are in several places along here springs near the road which at present run for some considerable distance along its surface, these should be led straight across into the stream. At 7 miles we cross the valley stream, here the road is bad, and is soft and wet by the leakage from irrigation streams. At 7 - miles ( 17 ) we climb more steeply, the surface at the commencement v r. 4 ™ j Po c t am rnn« 5 d#»rin&lt;r very rough indeed and the rather large (17) Barra Murda Pass. I am considering 7 &amp; , . , . .P possibility of a diversion here, but will have to and sharp loose Stones which Strew the wait till 1 am in the vicinity again. roa( J at p D j n t should be removed. The general ascent up to 9 miles is fairly steep and in some places rough. At 11 miles we reach a second crest having passed over easy ground since leavino -9 miles, and little requires to be done here. From 1112 miles we descend, in some places the grades are bad and some short lengths are ex ceedingly rough. From 12-18 miles where we reach the Karun at Dopulun we have a lot of rise and fall to overcome, the road surface being loose and dusty with some stretches of rough rock. The road here might take an easier route, but this would probably mean that a bridge would have to be built in a less favourable place than the present one. The approaches to the present native bridge, especially on the Dopulun side, are again very bad indeed, and some- thinS should be done there in the near future. The bridge consists of a brick arch which looks weak and shows signs of sinking at the crown; it is at present underpinned and supported by timber, but will bear watching. The serai here ^ ( 18 ) is very broken down and has no ( 18 ) Entirely negligeable, being uninhabitable. acc0 mmodation Worth talking about, but the supply of fodder is generally sufficient. Dopulun to Nahun. A i mile below the serai the tributary stream ( 19 ) was crossed close to its 4 junction with the Karun. This ford was by no means easy and is probably impassable in the rains, and a bridge ( 20 ) should be built over the stream some few hundred feet above the junction, this should not nean a span of more than 15 or 20 feet. Directlv after crossing we commence to climb ( 21 ) until we reach 2 ! miles Directly alter crossing where you look into the Ardal Valley.

At about 3 miles we branched off the main road on our way to Chiga. khor, but we could see the road to Shalamzar as far as the top of the crest (23) of the next range at about 5 £ miles. There (21) zirreh Pass. j s a sera j at (24) used by the Khans which is used by most of the karavans instead of staying at Naghun, the ascent to the crest (25) at 5} looks steep, but not excessive, the surface good. This road after reaching the summit descends directly to the Shalamzar plain and reaches the town at about 11 miles. From 5J—6J miles I should say was rough, but from here on across the plain it looked very easy with one stream to cross before reaching the town. Kharageh is reached at 17 miles. If the road over , . CL , the hill behind Shalamzar is followed there is a fairly steep (26) but short ascent with a descent which is rather rough in several places. The stream (27) at Kharageh is crossed by a bridge of several (10?) small spans in good condition and with an exceptionally good road surface over it. From Kharageh to Shamsabad at . . AU . ^ 4 22 miles the road is easy, another 10 span (27) Ab-i-Qia!shutar. t ‘j • j ^ i m / \ r“ w bridge is crossed at 20J miles (27). We were informed in passing through Shamsabad that they had no barley but there are supplies available in the Armenian villages a couple of miles away. From 22J miles w r e climb gradually up to 25 miles passing a large garden (28) Gardan-i-Huria. on the we the n ascend (28) more steeply over a rather stony road up to 27 miles, thence descend again reaching the Qavehrukh plain at 29 miles and the town itself at 32 miles. The plain had just been badly flooded and the road, especially the last two miles, was very soft indeed, and in places could not be used at all. It is much below the level of the cultivated land on each side of it and had evidently acted as a water-course for a considerable distance. The road should be diverted to the higher ground and well protected bv ditches, especially on the hill side. Four stream beds were crossed none of which how ever would give trouble on ditched road. There are several serais in the town and plenty of accommodation and stabling, but we saw nothing that would tempt an European to forsake his tent. A good camping ground near the town is diffi cult to find, as all the available space in the vicinity has evidently been used as the camping ground for numerous native “ kafelas ”. Qavehrukh to Bistagun. After leaving the town we continue over a stony plain reaching a low crest ( 29 ) Gardan-i.Rukh.

Cart Road. With regard to the cost of making the present road into a road capable of taking wheeled traffic, including motor traffic, I offer the following figures : Between Malamir and Ispahan the work required over the different sections can be classified under the three heads (i) easy (2) medium and ('ll “ difficult ihere is about 82J miles of (1), 58 miles of (2), and 22 4 miles of (3 ; an approximate estimate for this length is £82,000. From what I “n gather the portion between Ahwaz and Malam.r would contain about 50 miles of (1), 54 of (2 P ) and 5 miles of (3); giving £50,0000 for the section, or a total between Ahwaz and Ispahan of ^i 3 2 i 000. Railway to Malamir. You have asked for figures for a light railway as far as Malamir. The permanent way for a 2' gauge, steel sleepers would cost you £1,200 a mile laid,8 and with gradients of 1: 25 as maximum your line would cost £20,000 U p to Malamir There may be however “special” features in the country between the D | a ins and Malamir, (f have not seen this portion mysef) which might raise this figure considerably. If a cart road were continued from Malamir to Ispahan the total cost of the two combined would be ^282,000, exclusive of rolling stock. Cart Road and Caravan track. Suppose again a cart road be built up to Maidan-i-Naftun, arrangements being made to utilize this in conjunction with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, from Ahwaz to Maidan-i-Naftun, the cost of continuing this road as far as Malamir would be approximately £30,000, the putting of the present road into good repair for caravans from this point to Shalamzar would be £5,000, and the construction of a good cart road from there to Ispahan £26,000, making a total of £ 61,000 from Maidan-i-Naftun to Ispahan. 1 A road from Ahwaz to Ispahan would militate to some extent against the I Mohammerah-Khurramabad Railway as at present proposed, it would appear that when the Railway had reached Khurramabad, a road from that town to Ispahan, would meet every requirement, and at a less cost than that above proposed. I must apologise for the length of the descriptive matter in this letter, especially as so much of it must be already known to you ; I hope however it may meet your requirements.

Ranking, LA., His Majesty’s Vice-Consul, and Assistant Resident, Ahwaz, To—His Excellency Sir Walter Townley, K.C.M.G., His Majesty s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary, at the Court o . . • the Shah of Persia, Tehran. I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of a copy of Your Excellency’s despatch No. 215, dated 30th July, I9&lt;4&gt; to the address of His Majesty s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, forwarded under cover of a letter dated Tehran, 30th July, 1914, and acopy of a letter from Messrs Lynch s gen at Tehran, forwarded under cover of a letter, dated Tehran, the 19th August, 1914. - ^ - With regard to the Khan’s contention, mentioned in paragraph 5 , page I, of Your Excellency’s despatch No. 215 , that they could not agree that the 11 was the chief disintegrating factor, I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that I have consulted Mr. Douglas, whose opinion, being that of a technical man, the Khans would doubtless give some weight to. His opinion is that the small hoofed animals—such as donkeys, etc., cause much the most damage, as their small hoofs tear the packing from the interstices in the road surface. With regard to Mr. Weber’s remarks, contained in his letter dated nth August, 1914 , to Your Excellency, I have the honour to offer the following observations. I will deal with the points seriatim as they occur in his letter. Re ( 0 - ■ , ... , Messrs Lynch’s Agent at Tehran anticipates “ violent opposition on the part of the Bakhtiari Khans ” if the II are prohibited from using the Lynch Road. It may be of interest to record that the matter has already been taken up, and the Sardar-i-Jang has already issued a prohibition, from the operation of which only the Il-i-Zaraswand and the Turks are exempt, as was suggested in my despatch No. I -46 of 2 nd July 1914 * There has been no “ violent opposition as yet. INDIA, r v t.. No \ 5 5 NOV iy|4 C125FD2 Next he says “ such a step would result in a loss to the Khans of the greater part of their toll receipts ”, and a little further on “ we have reason to believe that the tolls derived from the migration of the II amount to something like 100 per cent more than those produced by the transport of merchandise”. I am afraid Messrs. Tynch’s Agent is labouring under a misapprehension. The tolls due from such II as pass over the Bridge, do not in toto exceed 6,000 Tumans, of which sum some 2,000 Tumans are remitted to personal retainers of the Khans and privileged persons, such as the Ahmed Khusrois, leaving a nett total actually collected of some 4,000 Tumans. Toll, it should be noted, is only taken from the II on the upward journey, the downward being free. The Bridge takings last year amounted to, officially, in round numbers, 50,000 Tumans, though I believe from what I heard on the spot when I came through that the actual amount taken was nearer 60,000 Tumans. Further comment on the relative amounts of tolls produced by the II and the transport of merchandise is superfluous. It is also stated that “ the nomadic tribes are compelled to cross one of the bridges, Godar-i-Balutak or Amarat on their journey As a matter of fact “ the nomadic tribes ,f follow three routes, vis., speaking broadly :— the Il-i-Zaraswand ... the Turks the Dinaruni the Sheikhha-i-Dopulani and some smaller sub-divisions the Dinaruni of Susan and Malamir the Babadi ... ... the Behdarwand... the Chahar Lang fie (2). “ The present state of dilapidation of the caravanserais is due to their destruction by the Kuhgelus in 1911, and their reconstruction has never since been attempted.” I must beg to entirely differ from this statement. The Kuhgilu burnt some of the merchandise stored in the caravanserais, but did not destroy the caravan serais themselves. “ The present state of dilapidation ’* is entirely due to neglect, and to no other cause. ** (3). ( Messrs. Lynch’s Agent ascribes the primary cause of scarcity of supplies ‘to the land not having been cultivated during the past five years, owing to the pre-occupation of the Bakhtiari Khans in political affairs, and to the lack of labour due to the tribes having been sent up country to serve the Nationalist cause.’ Up to the summer of 19 11 , I can say from personal knowledge that the usual amount of cultivation was done, and during the past three years, I learn on enquiry that the same has been the case. The “ pre-occupation of the Bakhtiari Khans in political affairs ” does not prevent the Bakhtiari tribes from sowing and reaping as usual. . ^Use the Bridge route. . Use the Susan route. . ^Use the Bazuft route.Further during this “pre-occupation “ the tribal executive Chiefs remained in the Bakhtiari Country and carried out their duties as usual—revenue was collected and affairs internal and external were dealt with. “ The tribes ” were not “ sent up-country to serve the Nationalist cause.” Some sowars were sent. If my memory serves me, a liberal estimate puts the number of men away at one time from their homes at not more than 2,000 men. This would not produce the “ lack of labour” talked about. It is very easy for Messrs. Lynch’s Agent at Tehran to talk about keeping “ a close watch on prices ” but quite another matter to ensure that the prices, fixed by the Sardar-i-Jang, are not exceeded by the “ dalundars ” in the Bakhtiari Country. The Sardar, who has everything to gain and every desire to see his orders obeyed, has considerable difficulty in enforcing them. I have already stated my opinion as to the probable results of Messrs. Lynch’s plan to fodder the hill section. If put into force, I shall do my utmost to assist it, but on account of inherent difficulties I have little hope of its success. We next come to a paragraph—“ A fresh fact * • • * * belonging to the Bakhtiari Khans ”,—which shows a deplorable ignorance of the conditions of the road. Leaving aside “ the characteristic timidity ” of the “ nomadic tribes ” which, unfortunately, I have failed to notice during the course of extensive touring in a tract of country embracing the Kuhgilu, the Bakhtiari, and the Pusht-i-Khuh Countries, I would point out the very relevant fact that, in the proximity of that part of the Lynch Road traversed by the II, the Bakhtiari Khans own personally not a single square yard of cultivated land, except at Dopulun itself, where the land, belonging the Sardar-LFateh, is let out by him to rayots on a long tenure. Beyond taking his “ sikub ” share, I doubt very much if Sardar-i-Fateh bothers his head about this land. Elsewhere the land is tribal property, and if proof were wanting, I could quote incidents where such damage to standing crops has caused 6ghts resulting in bloodshed between of the owners the land and the II, whose cattle caused the damage. Re ( 4 ). Messrs. Lynch are chiefly concerned with getting a safe trade-route; for this safety the Bakhtiari Khans are entirely responsible. If the latter consider that the best results will be obtained by the employ ment of the Kuhgilu, I consider it is not within Messrs. Lynch’s province to dictate the means, by which the safety is to be attained. The “ P rc ] 0 f °f t ' ie pudding is in the eating ”, and hitherto the arrangement has worked satisfac torily. Re (5). Cartage Scheme. The only ' objection ” to Messrs. Lynch undertaking this enterprise them selves is that the said firm seem to have no enterprise in them.. They have a the road in their hands now for some 16 years, and I consider its present state is a disgrace. I suggested co-operation with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in the hopes that the infusion of new blood might render their policy with regard to the Road more virile. 1 have already submitted to Your Excellency, figures dealing with the cost of making the road fit for motor traffic, as mentioned by essrs. ync s Agent at Tehran, in his letter now under comment.Re (6). The benefit which the Inspectors will afford to the road, will be in direct ratio to their honesty. It yet remains to be seen if they will be of any benefit to the road. Such merchants and firms as I have met in Ispahan do not as yet appear to have perceived any quickening up in the period of transit of goods on the road or any amelioration of the causes of complaint. Messrs. Lynch’s Agent at Ispahan informs me that the “rapid transit” caravans have not yet commenced to run. Messrs. Lynch’s Agent at Tehran appears to be anticipating events slightly, when he says the new arrangement of Inspectors has permitted the formation of a “rapid transit” caravan, etc. I regret I cannot agree with Mr. Weber in his opinion that the state of affairs does not differ very greatly from 1910. The state of the road is worse now than I have ever before seen it, and I trust that it will be found possible to do something to improve it, though from the tone of the last paragraph of the letter under comment, it is difficult to be sanguine of any effective effort on the part of Messrs. Lynch. In conclusion I would venture to say that I am astonished that Messrs. Lynch’s Agent at Tehran should have committed himself to statements, which betray such a regrettable lack of information and ignorance of the conditions connected with the Lynch Road.

Foreign Office November 14th, 1914 I Sir I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th ultimo, ^ P.3795, regarding the measures suggested for the rehabilitation of British interests in Southern Persia. The Marquess of Crewe calls attention to the views expressed by His Majesty’s Ambassador at Petrograd as to the advisability of His Majesty’s Government arriving at some understanding with the Russian Government before the end of the war. Sir E. Grey is disposed to consider that the proposal - which was made only ten days after the outbreak of war - was limited to certain details then causing friction between the two Governments, and he does not think that Sir G. Buchanan desired to suggest any general or comprehensive arrangement on the whole Persian question,which, in fact, could only be reached by a conference of experts discussing the subject without any regard The Under Secretary of State India Office.(60468/14) regard to the war or its possible results. Such a course Sir E. Grey would be reluctant to adopt, as It would, he considers, not be feasible to detach the question so completely front other International considerations; and t moreover f the present moment does not appear to offer encouraging facilities for its final settlement. His Majesty's Government are at present concentrating their efforts on the acquisition of the islands in the Persian Gulf, and there is little prospect of their being able to proceed in existing conditions with a railway policy in Southern Persia. In these circumstances I am to enquire whether Lord Crewe concurs in the terms of the annexed draft telegram which Sir E. Grey would propose to dispatch to His Majesty's Minister at Teheran on the subject. I am, Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, £&lt;r- ^’^5-ijr&amp;xk Telof,raiu to Sir W.

No. 1. a copy of a financial statement laid before the Cabinet by the Treasurer-General, in which a suggestion was made that a solution of the present financial embarrassments might be found in the sale of certain territories to Great Britain and Russia respectively. I was surprised, in the course of a long conversation which I had on the 2(ith ultimo with the Prime Minister, to see that the suggestion put forward by M. Mornard has had a favourable reception in Ministerial circles. Ala-us-Sultaneh explained that people are in despair, and are so heartily sick of the situation that has been created by Russia’s steady encroachments upon Persia’s prerogatives that they are prepared to jump at any solution, however heroic, that might offer a chance of reaching a clear understanding. His Highness said that the manner in which Russia has laid hands upon the collection of revenue in the north from her subjects and protected persons, who are becoming countless, and is insidiously taking possession of the administration of the country through her consuls, has become so intolerable that he believes that a Medjliss would welcome even such a drastic solution as a sale of territory, provided that such conditions were attached to such a sale as would safeguard Persia from a continuance of Russian intervention in her internal affairs, and would guarantee her liberty of action in her own house. 1 would respectfully venture to submit that the scheme appears to me to offer a possible solution of the Persian question, which, without some such radical step which will clearly define the true position and intentions of all parties, seems to me destined, sooner or later, to lead to serious differences between the British and Russian Govern ments. It may injustice be said that the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907, in so far as it concerned Persia, has done a great work. It lias undoubtedly preserved Persia from total disruption, but it has done its work, and if persevered in, will eventually j prove a failure. If it be granted that both Governments were genuinely imbued with a 1 desire to maintain the integrity and independence of Persia at the time of the signature of the convention, it cannot, I think, be gainsaid that circumstances have caused Russia to in a measure, at least, overlook the underlying principle of the convention, and that the recent action of the Russian legation and consuls has been of a nature to endanger the continued existence of Persia as a sovereign independent kingdom. As co-signatory of the convention of ]907, Great Britain would appear bound to use her best endeavours to remind Russia of her undertaking under the said convention ; but constant reminders of this nature are likely to produce friction, and it may, perhaps, be rightly held that the protection of Persia’s rights under the joint guarantee of the two Governments is not of sufficient importance to risk jeopardising the good relations which it is of the first importance to maintain. There is, however, another side to the 1 picture which cannot be lost sight of: the steady encroachment of Russia by means of the leasing of properties, and the intervention of Russian consuls which that entails, is rapidly spreading southwards from Ispahan into the neutral zone, in which, under the letter of the convention, Russia has equal rights with ourselves. It would appear to me inevitable that some day —and that day is not far distant at the present rate of progress—Russian interests will clash with old-established British rights in South Persia, and a quarrel may ensue. Already, I understand, at Ispahan the British and Russian residents pass each other as strangers. Under such conditions, would it not, I venture to suggest, be well to take under careful consideration the question whether or no the scheme of zones of influence has been proved sufficiently successful to justify its continued maintenance ? It appears to me to threaten to-day dangerous complications. Russia’s aspirations in the north have been so far satisfied that either she or zealous consuls who are seeking their own self- advancement are looking for fresh fields in which to make her influence felt. It is hard O [2251 h —9] Opv to Endf'a 16 OCT 19142 f ' to see how this tendency can be checked, unless the zones are delimitated afresh in sucli a manner as to give almost the entire neutral zone to Great Britain. It is improbable j that Kussian public opinion would accept such an arrangement. Were the Persian Government to propose to the two Powers a sale of certain : territories as sketched in M. Mornard’s memorandum a condition would doubtless be I attached that the system of zones should be abolished, in order that Persia might hav^ complete liberty of action in what remained to her, all due assuiances being of course given for the proper protection of the British and Russian interests already established. I am of opinion that such an arrangement would be greatly to our advantage as things stand to-day. We could easily make our own terms to protect our various interests and we should no longer feef that the steady Russian pressure from the north is jeopardising our rights which under the convention aie very vulnemble. Our position in the Gulf would be rendered unassailable by our possession of the islands, cpnte apart from the possible future value they may have as oil-producing units or for purposes of storage. I X presume that His Majesty’s Government are of opinion that British interests are best served bv a Persia sufficiently strong to act as a butler between Great Britain and Russia in the Middle East. Such a Persia can never, it has been clearly demonstrated, be created under the P.)07 convention. Half the country is directly under Russian influence, a portion is undecided, and the insignificant remainder from the point of view of Tehran politics, owns British allegiance. Meanwhile, the Central Government has no authority and never can have any authority so long as its hands are tied by the necessity of considering the wishes of one or other Power, or of both. A hank protectorate would afford the country a better chance of making progress than the present most unsatisfactory system. If Russian aspirations in Azerbaijan or elsewhere could be satisfied by a sale of territory, Persia could be rendered free to look after her own affairs; she would have money with which to pay her most pressing creditors, and she would still have money over with which to carry out public works and maintain a sufficient force to guarantee law and order. Given a chance to manage their own affairs themselves, there are plenty of men in Persia to-day capable of doing so, and I feel convinced that, if she were given a fair start, Persia could not only rise again, but she could become a much more enlightened and useful State than she has ever been before. r l he position at Ispahan could be settled with a stroke of the pen. If the arrangement made between the Zil-es-Sultan and the manager of the Russian Bank were cancelled, the situation would become normal again as far as the interference of the Prussian consul-general in the administration of the province is concerned. This question of Ispahan is one that is likely to be fruitful of much trouble for our interests if the Russians are to be allowed to maintain the paramount position they have acquired there. The Bakhtiaris are closely identified with Ispahan. For the last four or five years the Governor-General has been a Bakhtiari. Should a Russian nominee, other than a Bakhtiari, be appointed, it is more than probable that the chiefs of this fickle and money-loving tribe would make up their minds to come to terms with the Russians much in the same way as the Zil-es-Sultan has done. All Persians are prone to side with the stronger, more especially if pecuniary advantage is likely to result therefrom. We have seen from recent reports from Ispahan that there is good reason to believe that the present Russian consul-general, inspired doubtless by the manager o the bank, who knows the local conditions thoroughly, has made overtures to t e Bakhtiaris through the representative at Ispahan of the Haji ilkhani family, whose fidelity to British interests is perhaps Itss well assured than that of the ilkhani family. At the same time certain of the khans residing at Tehran have warned me that, n a seen that the British Government means to abandon Ispahan to the Russians, we sha lose their allegiance. This would mean that the important Ahwaz-Ispahan trade route would pass under a foreign influence inimical to the penetration of bntis commerce into Central Persia, and that a hostile wedge would be _ driven down m ^ Arabistan. We should, moreover, lose an invaluable link in the chain of that raI H a ^ of protection by local levies which seems to me essential for the protection o British oil interests now established along the Gulf littoral. _ . . the Ever since I have been at Tehran 1 have been at great pains to maintain ^ cordial relations I found existing between this legation and the Bakhtiari k ans. think that I have had some measure of personal success, but I feel that the pom ^ ^ ephemeral and that for that rea c on it is most desirable that some means S10U j found of torging a stronger and more durable chain binding together our f!' n ^ Bakhtiari interests. Much might be done by the presence of British ofhcers -3 advisers among the Bakhtiars, but it is probable that such a step would arouse resent ment at St. Petersburgh, more especially if, as would appear to be the case from the policy of the Russian consul-general, reported from Ispahan, it is intended to endeavour to alienate the khans from their tacit allegiance to us. Again, the situation that must be created in Luristan, if the British railway .^iterprise, to which His Majesty’s Government and that of India appear to attach great importance, is to be carried through successfully, may well be productive of friction between Great Britain and Russia in the future. In order to succeed, not only in the execution of that undertaking but in its subsequent smooth working, it will be essential to create a pro-British atmosphere. A start has already been made in that direction by enlisting the sympathies of the Yali of Pusht-i-Kuh, but there is small doubt that the Russians are watching developments, and are likely to favour any move that may be calculated to render the railway scheme abortive. This was clearly evident when Nizam-us-Sultaneh was in Tehran. For the above reasons, and for others of a more remote nature that will only mature if our aims in Luristan and Bakhtiaristan are frustrated, it would appear to me highly desirable that a limit should be set to Russian penetration into the neutral zone. A total abolition of the same could, in my opinion, only he effected at a sacrifice of interests of great value to us, and would also entail the eventual partition of the Kingdom. Under the purchase scheme, if Russia could be induced to buy under certain essential conditions what she has already acquired, Russian penetration south might be effectively checked. It is possible that the best means of inducing Russia to adopt the idea of purchase would be for His Majesty's Government to carry through the purchase cf the islands in the Gulf first. Russia would then probably demand a quid pro quo in the north, and the desired result would have been achieved. It may possibly seem that the procedure suggested has a “ tricky ” appearance among friends, but I would venture to point out that despite reiterated assurances, Russia’s policy in Persia, more especially in the matter of the Ispahan arrangement and Kermanshah, has not been marked with whole-hearted sincerity towards a friend who has loyally carried carried out the terms of the bargain made in 1907. It is of course by no means certain that any Persian statesman would be found sufficiently courageous to take a step which would involve the alienation of a portion of the national territory, but the brusqueness of recent Russian action has awakened the semi-somnolent Persian to a realisation of the fact that certain parts of what is still called Persia have alreadv passed into Russian hands never to be returned, and that, if a halt is not called to the present insidious policy of grab on Russia’s part, Great Britain, whom the majority of Persians still look upon as a friend, whose good intentions towards Persia are inspired by the greatest of incentives, self-interest, will find herself forced in sheer self-defence to adopt a similar policy, in order to preserve her interests and position. Nothing can stop the development of what is in full swing to-day but the adoption of a scheme which would not only enable Persia to treat for freedom in the management of her own affairs, but would also put her in possession of funds with which to put her house in order and make a start upon a programme of public woiks which will immensely improve the economic situation of the country.

It would accordingly, in the opinion of the Russian Government, be preferable for Samsam to be succeeded by a member of another branch of this tribe, e.g., Sardar Mohtashem, especially as Sardar Bahadur has always displayed hostile sentiments towards Russia.

Ranking, I.A., His Majesty's Vice-Consul, and Assistant sident, Ahwaz, To His Excellency Sir Walter Townley, K.C.M.G., His Majesty s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court ot His Imperial Majesty the Shah of Persia, Tehran. I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that the new Russian Consul in Isnahan. through Haji Muhammad Ibrahim, the Russian Agent, has com menced to make overtures to Kafi-ul-Mamalik, the Ispahan Agent and repre sentative of the Sardar-i-Jang. A few days ago, Haji Muhammad Ibrahim, accompanied by a local Mullah known as Mullah-i-Daulatabadi, went to the Sardar-i-Jang’s Agent and after the usual preliminaries got to business. Kafi-ul*Mamalik is by birth a Khorassani, and has estates in Turbat-i- Haidari. The Russian offer was that Kafi-ul-Mamalik should inform the Russian Consul of the name of his Estate Agent in Turbat, that it would be arranged to nav this man 30 Tumans per mensem pro forma, and under cover of being a Russian employd, be granted Russian protection for his person and property, and of course for the Kafi-ul-Mamalik’s property also. Further, that they would extend Russian protection to Kafi-ul-Mamalik should he desire it. This was the bait to catch the unwary Kafi. Now what did they want out of him ? . , . • Their obiect was twofold. Firstly, to enlist his sympathies and assistance in A imr the Sardar-i-Iane into the Russian net, and secondly, to enlist his, an through him, his masti’s Assistance by playing on the enmity existing between them and the Samsam-us-Saltana, with a view to securing the latter s dismissa from the Ispahan Governorship. They held out also a bait to the Sardar-i-Jang. Being aware of the arrangement whereby 50 ^^'Abjang, and also that the Ispahan Governor-Generalship a P X some jigj cu i t y i s being ex- these moneys have not yet been pai h dgwn .&lt; 30000 Tumans periencen in came to ” “ the ° r his - Age - nt and ejectment.2 Up to the present the influential persons of this clique are, the A'ent h’ self, Sayed-ul-Iraquain, Mulla-i-Daulatabadi, Akhund-i-Kalbasai, ShaiklTMulia 1 ^' mad Baqir, youngest son of the late Agha Nejafi, and the Raes-i-Naza mp ^ of Ispahan. yetl One of the Mullahs, who is not of this party, conveyed to the Samsam secret warning on the occasion when he went to the Musjid-i-Shah, in connection with the obsequies of the late Agha Nejafi, to be on his guard against the intrigues of this party. The Kafi-ul-Mamalik is not unwilling to listen to these blandishments as evidenced by his biassed award in the case of a money claim by the late RaesT Nazamiyeh—now Russian Munshi-bashi—against the Governor-General; in which case Kafi-ul-Mamalik was appointed one of two arbitrators, his confrere beine the Mirza of Samsam-us-Sakana, Governor-General of Ispahan. I do not think the Sardar-i-Jang is very likely to fall into the Russian snare, though of course the money bait might tempt him ; of his agent I am not so certain. I shall watch the situation and report further developments. Meanwhile to relieve the Sardar-i-Jang’s most pressing immediate needs for money and keep him as far as possible out of the way of temptation, I have been casting about and find there is still to his credit in the l. B. P., Ispahan, through an oversight, the May instalment of the oil subsidy, for the payment of which I am making arrangements. I have communicated by telegraph with the Sardar-i-Jang, and shall inform Your Excellency on completion of arrangements. I have today communicated the contents of this despatch to His Majesty’s Consul-General, Ispahan, for his information, and have forwarded a copy to His Majesty’s Political Resident, Bushire.

Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received October 5 .) (No. 237.) Tehran, September 3 , 1914. IiSi ordei to understand all tlie difficulties that beset the appointment of a Governoi-General at Ispahan it is necessary to consider the special connection of the Lakhtians with that city ; their family differences ; the enmity prevailing between the Bakhtiaris and the family of the Zil-es-Sultan ; and the predominant interests created for the Russians by the placing of the Zil’s vast properties under the manage ment of the head of the Ispahan branch of the Banque d’Escompte, or Russian Bank, as it is generally called. I he Bakhtiaris claim that Ispahan is of vital importance to them as a market for their produce; that without having control of the city through one of their own number, or through someone entirely devoted to their cause, they cannot maintain a proper control over the Bakhtiari road, or make sure that their large vested interests would be properly safeguarded. Such importance do the khans attach to the presence of a Bakhtiari Governor-General at Ispahan that, as soon as it was known that the Russians were seeking the downfall of Samsam-es-Sultaneh, they threatened to leave Tehran in a body, summon 5,000 Bakhtiari horsemen to assemble at Ispahan and hold the city against all comers. If the Belgians, they argued, could hold their country for so long against the German army, surely Bakhtiaris could hold Ispahan against any Russian force that might be sent against them. Of course there was much bombastic bluff in this threatening language which was fortunately confined to family councils at which Mr. Churchill was present, but it serves to show how much importance is attached to the presence of a Bakhtiari Governor-General, and, should they resort to extreme measures, a most uncomfortable situation might be created. I am fortunately on terms of close personal intimacy with the leading khans, and without alluding to the intemperate language used in Mr. Churchills presence, it has been possible to make them understand that His Majesty’s Government has their best interests closely at heart, but that any violent action on their part would be viewed with displeasure. It has transpired in the course of recent conversations that the steady growth of Russian influence in Central Persia is beginningto make itself felt upon the Bakhtiaris. They have not hesitated to assert that it is impossible for them to feel sure of their ground so long as the Russian consul-general and bank manager are all supreme at Ispahan. They have expressed openly their opinion that, as long as Ispahan remains in the Russian zone, His Majesty’s Government will be unable to give them such assistance as is necessary to induce the Russian Government to send instructions to their consular officers to refrain from meddling in the administration of the province, and to forbid the manager of the bank to usurp all the most essential administrative functions of the Governor-General. They have made it clear that, though they consider themselves bound by special ties of friendship and gratitude to His Majesty’s Government, in the event of it being impossible to protect their interests, they will be constrained to follow the example of the Zil-es-Sultan and seek protection from those who can afford it them more effectually than we can. The assurances given by the Russian Government concerning the Bakhtiaris are' doubtless genuine, but I am convinced that the authorities at Petrograd have little or no knowledge of the doings of their local agents, both official and unofficial. The Russian consul-general has denied stoutly that any overtures had been made to Sardar-i-Jang through his local agent in Ispahan, but Captain Ranking would appear to have satisfied himself of the truth of the story he reported The consul may well know nothing about such proceedings, which are habitually conducted by some member of the swarm of official, semi-official, and unofficial myrmidons who are attached to Russian consulates in Persia and whose actions are easily disavowed. That Russian agents are eagerly on the lookout to detach Bakhtiaris from British allegiance there can be no doubt. M. Poklewsky made no concealment of the fact, though he perhaps placed too much confidence in the assurances of goodwill given him by some of the khans, such as Sardar Zafar, who came temporarily under his influei [2269 e —3] Co n V r ('•? r t ul G 6 t!0V 1914 soon as2 it was seen that Morteza Quli Khan, the son of Samsam-es-Snltaneh, had incurred displeasure, overtures were made to him by various Russian agents, but in suc ?? manner that they could be easily denied if a question had been raised. ! It has also transpired that the reason why the Bakhtiaris have not gone on witli ^ the proposal which originated with themselves to have British officers to instruct the'^ men has been because they have felt that such a step would bind them completely t* British interests. They feel that as long as Ispahan remains in the Russian zone they must leave a door open through which they can go over to the Russian side, if it should I at any time suit their interests to do so. Certain members of the Ilkhani family, such as Sardar Assad, Samsam-es-Sultaneh, Sardar Bahadur, and probably his brother Amir-i-Jang, and Morteza Quli Khan would probably never do so, but Sadar Zafar who on one occasion openly declared that he was Russia’s nominee at Ispahan and all the members of the Haji Ilkhani family might well transfer their allegiance. The presence of British officers among the Bakhtiari would serve several useful purposes They would create a strong defensive barrier in the mountainous district lying to the north of the oilbearing regions. They would serve to restrain the khans from even considering such dangerous measures as a resort to arms in defence of their interests It may be hoped that they would succeed in transforming the wild freebooters into a disciplined body of men who would be of much greater use to the Persian Government in an emergency than can be the undisciplined tribesmen who are to-day more feared than the robber bands they may be called upon to suppress. Finally, they would bind the warlike tribe definitely to British interests, and so check the attempts of Russian agents to win it over to interests that cannot fail one day to come out in antagonism to those of Great Britain. Although at moments it would appear as if all family quarrels among the Bakhtiaris had been patched up, the hostility 7 between the Ilkhani family and the Haji Ilkhani family is deep rooted and ineradicable. The feud dates from the day when the Zil-es-Sultan sought with no small success to break the power of the tribe by setting the one family against the other. To achieve this end, he oppressed the richer and more important Ilkhani family and even went so far as to cause their leader, the father of Samsam-es-Sultaneh and Sardar Assad, to be murdered in 1882. The Zil meanwhile exalted the less important Haji Ilkhani family^ and raised them from comparative poverty to a certain measure of opulence. Whereas the members of the Haji Ilkhani strongly 7 supported the Constitutional movement and were in no small measure responsible for the fall of Muhammad Ali Mirza, their cousins have always been suspected of reactionary leanings. They are also more favourably disposed towards theZiT s or Russian party in Ispahan. Ihe Ilkhani family has again become the more powerful in the Bakhtiari country, and though it would, I think, be unwise to support the one family against the other at the present moment, a day may well come when we shall find ourselves bound to support the branch of the tribe upon which most reliance can be placed, in order to safeguard our important interests that are seriously threatened by the steady growth of Russian | influence in the southern centre. It may seem strange to have to harbour such suspicions at a moment when our two countries are making common cause in Europe, but one cannot shut one s eyes to to the fact that it is generally held in Persia that Russian interests are hostile to British. The actions of Russian consuls in opposing all . who are supposed to be friendly to us is certainly not calculated to dispel this belief.' lai £ el y 1° the machinations or intrigues of Akbar Mirza, Sarum-ed- Dowleh, the most able and active of the Zil’s sens now in Persia, that there lias been deteimined Russian opposition to Samsam-es-Sultaneh ever since the ex-Prime Minister took up the appointment of Governer-General at Ispahan. It is probable that this hotheaded old gentleman has been wanting in tact in his treatment of the Russian question, and he has doubtless repeatedly given himself over into the hands of his enemies by the use of intemperate language, but the fact cannot be denied that he was warned t lat he would meet with strong Russian opposition from the day that he should assume the reins of office. This, moreover, in spite of the fact that his appointment was arranged in concert with the Russian Legation, and after the consent of 1 etrograd to his nomination had been given. It was early apparent that Samsam s was not a nature that could brook the state of semi-tutelage in which the Russian o icials at Ispahan, perhaps even more the manager of the bank than t e consul-general, seek to hold the Governor-General. There can be but little doubt tha Samsam made many mistakes and occasionally allowed his tongue to run away wi him m his outspoken expressions of dislike of the Russians and their w r ays, but 163 old chieftain has been highly tried and no concealment was made of the fact by Akbar Mirza and Von Kaver that no stone would be left unturned to get him out. * Under such conditions it is easy to understand that the Cabinet of Petrograd has been persuaded that he has been consistently hostile to Russian interests. He has doubtless oeen so, if a genuine endeavour to recover some of the Governor-General’s natural administrative attributes which had been filched from his more pliable predecessors by the manager of the Russian Bank, with the aid of the consulate-general, can be so classified. One can imagine what the situation must be when a bank manager can boast that he can put 1,000 armed men in the field, and when the Governor-General is forbidden, under the specious pretext that his men would illtreat the villagers, to send a representative to punish evil-doers into any village of which a Russian subject or protected person owns or administers an infinitesimal part. How is it possible under such conditions foi a 1 eisian official to arrest such a scourge to the postal service and commerce as has become Reza Khan Joozani ? Akbar Mirza has himself said to me that it is not in their interests that this miscreant should be caught, which is at least equivalent to an avowal that he would be sure of a safe harbour in any village under Russian protection. V hen such a state of affairs prevails, it is not surprising that a Swedish oflicei at Ispahan should complain that M. von Kaver intrigues against the gendarmerie. Phe establishment of a strong and impartial road police could hardly be expected to meet with the approval of a bank manager who has arrogated to himself the position of Supreme Lord of Ispahan. It is clear, however, that this haughty banker can be influenced by a word from Petrograd or the legation at Tehran, and that Russian consuls and other officials are not so independent as they have represented. In consequence of some hostile act that the Governor-General was said to be meditating, M. von Kaver recently openly summoned 300 armed retainers from the Zil’s villages and lodged them in the Prince’s residence at Ispahan. When it was agreed with the Russian Government that Samsam should be allowed to depart peacefully, without appearing to have been dismissed, it was arranged that his Excellency should be advised to adopt a more conciliatory attitude, and all outwnrd show of opposition to him, of a nature to create a public disturbance, should be stopped. 1 learn that simultaneously with the receipt of my telegram advising Samsam to be more friendly, M. von Kaver has demobilised, doubtless upon the receipt of an order from a higher authority. Sardar Bahadur is without doubt the most capable of the khans to succeed Samsam-es-Sultaneh. If the Russian Government consents to his appointment, it wall be soon apparent from the attitude of the Zil’s adherents and the Russian Bank whether or not it will be possible for him to succeed. He is an able young man, but only time can show whether or not he will be able to cope with an extremely delicate and difficult situation. Should Russian opposition prove insuperable, it will be probably best to try Sardar Mohtashem, now at Kerman where he is doing well, at Ispahan, but his name should not be put forward by us.

Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received October 5.) (No. 234. Confidential.) Sir, Tehran, September 2, 1914. I HAVE the honour to transmit to you herewith two very interesting despatches which I have received from Captain A. T. Wilson, Acting British Commissioner on the Turco-Persian Frontier Commission, describing the state of affairs prevailing in the districts of Urmia and Soujboulak. A perusal of these documents will show the skilful manner in which the peaceful Russian occupation under arms of the rich Persian province of Azerbaijan is being carried out by Prussian consular officers, despite the repeated assurances of the Russian Government that they have no desire or -intention to annex any part of Persian territory. The same methods are being employed in a greater or lesser degree throughout the entire Russian zone. The war has caused a temporary check to the colonisation of the Turcoman countr } 7 between Asterabad and Gumbat-i-Kabus, to which reference has been made in previous despatches. All the Russian immigrants who had been installed as agricul tural colonists on lands that did not belong to those who sold them have been with drawn, and have rejoined the colours. I n Q O AT O WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Captain Wilson to Sir W. Townley. (Confidential.) Sir, Camp Mawana, August 15, 1914. I HAVE the honour to submit for your information the following observations upon the state of affairs at present existing in the Urmia district so far as it has come under my notice :— Political matters affecting Azerbaijan are altogether beyond my competence, but in view of the exceptional facilities that I have enjoyed for studying certain aspects of the situation on the spot, and for ascertaining the views oi the Russian officers in regard thereto, and as some time has elapsed since the district reported on has been visited by a British official, I trust that the following remarks may receive indulgent consideration :— Distribution of Russian Troops. 2 . Previous to the outbreak of war in Europe the following was the distribution of troops covered by this report:— At Urmia .—Two infantry battalions 5th Caucasian Tirailleurs (each consisting of four companies nominally of 250 men each, one squadron Cossacks (Gorski Mazdoksky Regiment), for light field guns, and details. . . At Mawana (15 miles west of Urmia).— Fifty men 5th Caucasian Tirailleurs. At Hakki (20 miles north-west of Urmia).— bO men 5th Caucasian Tirailleurs. At Ushnu (40 miles south-south-west of Urmia). 150 men 5th Caucasian Tirailleurs. The Cossack squadron has since left for Erivan, and I understand that the detachment at Ushnu will shortly be replaced by Persian Cossacks under a Russian [2^'69 e —2] B2 officer. It is rumoured that troops will before long be stationed in the Solduz Hiof • south of the lake, _ Stnct &gt; There is a general consensus of opinion amongst missionaries and others that th behaviour of these troops has been good ; there is no indication that their presence ' resented by the local population; on the contrary, everything that I have seen a I heard indicates that their presence is welcomed by all the Christian villagers and th I townspeople, who together form the greater part of the population, and by a maiorit 6 of the Mohammedan villagers, on account of the security which they have imposed on j the district, by force when necessary. Had they not taken active steps to restore and maintain order, I have no doubt that their presence would be as much resented now as it was when they first arrived but, as it is, they have made themselves indispensable, and their withdrawal would in the eyes of all but the lawless Kurdish tribesmen on the frontier be regarded as a calamity, and as the abandonment by Russia to pillage and robbery of many thousands of her co-religionists, to whom (as will be shown below) the fullest measure of official protection has been extended since 1911. The mere rumour that such a step was contemplated, on the outbreak of war in Europe, caused the greatest depression amongst Christian villagers, and a corresponding elation amongst the Kurds. Everything, however, goes to show that the possibility 7 of the withdrawal of Russian troops, at all events from Urmia, is officially considered a very remote one. Substantial brick barracks for a regiment on the outskirts of Urmia are nearing completion ; they are being built by a Russian subject on land purchased by him for the purpose, and partly at his own expense, the Russian Government paying a proportionate rent. Part of the cost appears, however, to have been subscribed for by local Persians, at the suggestion of M. Vedensky, the Russian vice-consul at Urmia, who appears personally responsible for most of the various measures that have been taken locally to consolidate the position of Russia. It should be noted that the regiments selected for service in Persia are drawn entirely from the Caucasus, and some of the men of these regiments, who speak the Turkish dialect of Azerbaijan freely, are Mohammedans ; they are on much the same . plane of civilisation as the local population, with whom they fraternised freely, and I understand that they have even gone so far as to enlist a few drummers locally. Russian Ecclesiastical Policy. 3. The Orthodox Church must be reckoned second in importance only to the Russian army 7 in creating solid bonds of interest between Russia and the people of Urmia. Half-a-dozen Russian priests of the Orthodox Church, with several Syrian colleagues, are stationed at Urmia with a Russian bishop, a man of some education and great energy, at their head; they exert considerable influence and occupy a prominent place at all official public Russian ceremonies. , It was the bishop who, amidst a crowd of complacent Persians, laid and consecrate the foundation stone of the Russian school, built by public subscriptions, derived large Y from rich Mohammedans and others, and when, on the 6 th August, a general parade o Russian troops and Persian Cossacks (Mohammedans) was held in the main street o Urmia to pray for the success of the armies of Russia and her allies, the wfiole Russian body ecclesiastic, in full canonicals, with acolytes, &amp;c., celebrated Mass in the street, m the presence of a large crowd of Persians; the local Governor, and a leading Seyyi» occupied a place of honour, and showed no embarrassment when they were, a e conclusion of the ceremony, sprinkled with Holy Water. _ • I- Thanks to the suostantial temporal advantages which membership of the Church confers on proselytes (all such becoming at once entitled to Russian protec io the enoitsof the bishop in this direction have met with great success, and the § re L part of the local Nestorian Church has adopted orthodoxy, at all events in naan®- baptism of converted Moslems is performed publicly, a proceeding unique, I he ieve, Persia or Turkey. r j r 5 I am informed, moreover, that the bishop and his assistants are endeavour' ft doubtless at the suggestion of high authority, to extend their missionary el ?^ ea ? 0 , peI1 a section—already pro-Russian—of the Syrian Church in Turkey; a meeting bet Mar Shimm the Syrian Patriarch and the Russian Bishop of Urmia, was rec) arranged and was frustrated only by the summary arrest of the former by the and his deportation to Van.Russian Commercial Interests. G. Since Russian troops first arrived, in 1911, Russian trade with Urmia has greatly increased. Numerous well-built shops and extensive warehouses, built and owned by Russian subjects, have spr-ang up in the town. Russian telegraphists, installed in the Russian consulates at Khoi and Urmia, monopolise the single wire of the Persian Telegraph Administration, to the practical exclusion of the regular Persian telegraphists, and facilitate communication in the Russian and Armenian languages with Julfa and Tabriz. The general security which the continued presence of Prussian trooos has engendered, has encouraged Persian merchants to follow their example, and on every side solid brick buildings are being erected, and the streets, under the auspices of the ubiquitous M. Vedensky, widened and paved. The presence of troops at Ushnu and Mawana is producing a similar effect, and a brisk trade has sprung up at these outlying towns, principally with Turkey, Russian exports through Urmia across the frontier having, I believe, greatly increased during the last twelve months. &lt; . Urmia, which is supplied to some extent direct from Julfa, is tending to replace Tabriz as a distributing centre for goods consumed in the Soujboulak district (including Solduz) and Turkey, and is, in any case, the centre of a district unsurpassed for fertility anywhere in Persia. Local Administration. 7. (1.) Municipal —A fairly efficient municipal administration is maintained; the streets are lighted and regularly cleaned, as also are the water courses ; money for the purpose is raised by direct levies, and it is understood that a considerable proportion of the sum raised is embezzled, as elsewhere in Persia. It is even suggested, with what truth I do not know, that the Russian vice-consulate is financially interested m the municipal administration. , . , The Governor, Itimad-ed-Dowleh, is a mere puppet, well content to take his orders from his old friend the Russian vice-consul to whom he owes his present position. So Iono- as he remains subservient, keeps order, and administers some sort of justice, M. Vedenskv lets him make his pickings in the time-honoured way. It is important to note however, that the latter, with a regiment at his back, has been able to make the exercise by the Itimad-ed-Dowleh of his rights of “ mudakhii; dependent on the performance, even if perfunctory, by the latter of the primary duties of a Governor. The Russian vice-consul enquires personally or by deputy into complaints made against the local Government, and, when necessary, tenders authoritative advice to the Governor, whose political complexion is sufficiently indicated by the fact that he informed me that the only Persians alive who could make good Prime Ministers were Sevyid-ed-Dowleh and Shuja-ed-Dowleh . , . ' ( 2 .) Judicial .—The “ Court of Appeal” recently established here has, I understand, formed the subject of some discussion at Tehran. . I attach, in case it has not already come to notice, a copy of the proclamation which announced its genesis. H is, o course, the product of‘'the fertile brain of M. Vedensky, who, with a frankness born of enthusiasm rather than of effrontery, thus explained to nie its or ^y?* . . . f. On his arrival at Urmia from Tabriz, he said, he had found the administration^ o justice chaotic. There were half-a-dozen or more minor tribunals, rehgmus or otherwise, to whom a plaintiff could have recourse, but none of these Courts could e a decision, or enforce compliance with theft* orders. No tribunal existed to which appea s from outlying Courts, and from the religious tribunals m Urmia could be carried 0 the other hand owing to the great increase in the number of Russian subjects and proteges (the latter being accorded in judicial matters the same privileges as Russian subjects) the legal duties of the vice-consulate had greatly increased; indeed, few cases came before the Governor to which a Russian subject or pro ege ^ aS ^ ^ ^ J' j He had therefore arranged to sit with the Governor twice a week to hear s appeals and was glad to be able to say that the system was working we 1. The people were well pleased with this expeditious, simple, and inexpensive tribunal, and (,is I can quite well believe) considered his presence thereon as essential to the administiat iustice. He added, in reply to a question from me, that m the unlikely event of a c ‘'se coming before the Court involving a foreign subject other than a Russian, he won d glaffly^stand aside. He assured me that a similar Court had been in existence for some ^^IgJtherfrom local enquiry that the presence of the Russian vice-consul is in no4 way resented locally, and is even “ appreciated ” by the few people who k existence of the Court. now Collection of Taxes by Russian Consular Authorities. 8 . Your Excellency is no doubt in full possession of all the facts relating t Hr branch of what my Russian colleague on this commission is pleased to call ‘‘ ° ^ 1S financial and economic policy of penetration in Azerbaijan.” The followino- however, be of some local interest:— ° s ma y) M. Yedensky told me that there were about 2,000 families of bond fide E 1 subjects (exclusive of the families of Russian soldiers) resident in his distriT^ statement which I am unable entirely to believe ; 500 would be nearer the mark C ’ &amp; When asked, however, how many families claimed to be Russian proves h replied that it would be easier to say how many did not claim this honour. 1 ^ ’ ne 9. Of the nine districts included within the governorship of Urmia,-' two-thirds of Ushnu, he said, comes under Russian protection, being the property of the Zarza Kurds who, like their chiefs Sulaiman Khan, Mansur-ul-Mamalik, Rashid Beer &amp; c w ’ Russian proteges. (I saw a good deal of Mansur-ul-Mamalik, however, when I was at Ushnu, and doubt if he realises the honour that is thus being thrust on him and his people). Dasht-il-Bil is owned by a Russian subject, Margawar, Targawar, and Dasht are controlled by one man, who js a Russian protege, with the result, the Russian vice- consul assmed me, that the cultivators in these districts (who are mainly Christians) are also entitled to Russian protection. J ' In Baradust and Somai, he said, there were at present no Russian proteges. I have since ascertained that at all events as regards Baradust, this is not the case At angachin, the chief village of Baradust, a large Russian church was built last spang. The district of Enzel, and a part of Urmia, was, he said, almost entirely owned by a Russian protege, Nasr-ed-Dowleh. Of .the Urmia district itself, a considerable proportion was owned by Russian subjects or proteges. 10 . In view of the foregoing, I found no difficulty in crediting M. Vedensky’s assertion that he had more than enough to do collecting taxes from his subjects and proteges, but known facts give the lie to his protestations that he had no concern with e axes o genuine I ersian subjects. Part of the Russian vice-consulate at Urmia has een se apmt as a ie\ enue*office, and three busy clerks, beseiged by a crowd of would-be axpavers were proudly pointed out to me in support of the complaint of overwork referred to above. r • • m ^n ! lien 10mn £ to M.

It is interesting in this connection to note that the head of the American mission at Urmia, the Rev. W. A. Shedd, told me that he was only deterred from teaching ^Russian instead of English in the large and well-managed schools which his organisation supports here by the difficulty of finding suitable teachers; should such be obtainable, he would not hesitate, in the interest of his pupils, to make Russian and not English the medium of instruction. 13. M. Vedensky hopes before long to establish a public Russian hospital and dispensary in the town, the present military hospital being of little use to the towns people. The matter is under active consideration and the inevitable hat will soon be sent round, under the auspices of the Governor. Both these institutions are doubtless designed to counteract the influence of the American mission at Urmia, which has for many years maintained an excellent school and well-equipped hospital in the town. Russian Policy on the Turco-Persian Frontier. 14. I asked M. Vedensky whether the Russian Government still adhered to their former policy of subsidising certain tribes on the frontier with a view to maintaining order. He replied in the negative, saying that the system had proved to be unsatis factory, and that they now protected impartially all chiefs and all tribes, showing ik&gt; favouritism whatever. Since the deportation to Tabriz in the spring, of Sheikh Tahir, a firebrand whom they had at first assisted, but who later on proved treacherous to their interests, profound peace had reigned on the frontier, and so long as Russian troops remained at Urmia he had little doubt that this state of things would continue. It is to be regretted, however, that until recently the Russians have connived at the harbouring of their proteges of brigands from the Turkish side, who have taken refuge in Persia when hard pressed by the Turks. 1 understand that the Russians are by no means unpopular with the tribes on the Turkish side of the frontier, who contrast their methods favourably with those of Ottoman troops, who do not, as a rule, pay for what they take. 15. The conclusions to which I have been led by the observations recorded above may be summarised as follows : — Russian influence^, at all events in the district under report, is the product factors, political, geographical, commercial, religious, linguistic, and others more difficult of analysis which are brought into play where a powerful State borders upon a weak and disorganised one. It is sedulously fostered by Russian agents, working with the approval of their Government, on a well-considered scheme, in the execution op which they have wide powers of initiative, and there is no longer any popular patriotic or fanatical opposition worth mentioning to its continued growth. ^ Neither in object or in methods has Russian policy m Azeroayan anything in common (as has sometimes been suggested) with British policy m Southern P ersia A were not our aims so totally dissimilar we could learn a good deal from the methods have described above. . . ,, -l-.lt Lastly, though in no way competent to express an opinion on the subject, 1 venture to hazard the view that any set-back to local Russian policy which we can encompass by diplomatic means is likely to be temporary and unsubstantial: even, foi examp e the Russian vice-consul were to cease to sit m the Court of Appea! the influence he ca bring to bear on his puppet the Governor would still enable him to affect ^ ^icts and the withdrawal of troops, by whomsoever replaced, would inevitably be Mowed by pillage and murder on a sufficiently large scale to necessitate ^Iffieireaily reti .

(Confidential.) gj r Camp Mawana, August lo, 1J14. ’ IN continuation of my despatch dated the 15th August, I have the honour to submit for your information a further report Healing with Russian policy m theSouj- boulak district of Azerbaijan. I am indebted to Captain F. L Dyer, 93rd Burma Infantry, Indian army (attached to this commission) for _ practically the whole qi t ie material on which this report is based, he having twice visited Soujboulak (once in the absence there of the Russian vice-consul) at my request, to investigate and report upon the situation there. Captain Dyer is a competent observer with a good knowledge o Persian, and full reliance may be placed on the accuracy of the facts recorded by him. Distribution of Russian Troops. 2. These first came to Soujboulak with the vice-consul in October 1912, and numbered at one time approximately 2 , 000 . The force now statione leie of— One company 5th Caucasian Tirailleurs. . One squadron of Cossacks (Gorski Mazdoksky regiment). Two field guns (under orders for Urmia). i A r\r\ A consular guard of twenty Cossacks. A total of about 400 men. The whole force is under the command of Colonel Mikoief, a Ca.u^ian Prince. _ The above force is somewhat inadequately housed in lured buddings ^ quarters for officers are, however, being constructed by the private enterprise o' Kussian [2269 e —21revenue, 450 mythical yeomanry being kept up in lieu. Sakiz and Baneh pay about 6,000 tomans each, and belong properly speaking to Kurdistan, having been placed under Azerbaijan as recently as December 1912, after the vacation of these districts by the Turks and subsequent to the arrival of the Russian vice-consul; they have only been actively administered by Soujboulak during the past four months. Russian subjects, who are stated to have leased about 150 villages in the district, pay their taxes into the vice-consulate, hut with this exception taxes are remitted to the Persian Treasury at Tabriz ; there appears to be no representative at Soujboulak of the Belgian financial administration. The owners of villages, and not the lessees, are responsible for paying the maliyat. 7. there is at present no Russian school or hospital m the district, nor is there any demand for them the common people are exceedingly suspicious of all foreigners, who they imagine despite denials to be Russians ; there is, however, no local opposition to the Lutheran Orient Mission, which .has been established here for some years. In the districts of Sardasht, Baneh, and Sakis, anti-Russian feeling is very marked, and was productive of some incidents during the summer, Russian survey parties (independent of the commission) who have been working over tiie first two districts having been the object of hostile demonstrations. In the district of Lahijan the extent of Russian influence is somewhat obscure. The tribesmen are undoubtedly hostile, but some of their chiefs, swayed by motives of personal ambition, have been intriguing for the support of the Russian vice-consul to their candidature for the chiefship, and there is good reason to think that the present chief of the Mangur Bulbas, Baiz Pasha, who was the Turkish nominee, retained his position when they evacuated the district by means of a substantial bribe to the Russian vice-consul (five or ten mules and 1,000 tomans). 8 . A comparison of the state of afiairs recorded above with that set forth in my f immediately preceding despatch, warrants, I venture to think, the following deductions :— Russian influence in Soujboulak is of recent and artificial growth. The despatch of troops there was demanded neither by the state of the country nor by existing Russian interests, and their withdrawal would do no real harm to legitimate foreign interests. None of the strategical, geographical, political, economic, religious, or linguistic factors which tend to lend strength and permanence to the Russian position in Urmia exist in the case of Soujboulak. The Russian vice-consul is a political missionary engaged in collecting a flock, and the sphere of his corrupt but successful activities is likely to spread to Kurdistan, a province which is at present unique in Persia in being practically untouched by foreign influences of any sort. His position and influence, however, are mainly personal, and were he to be succeeded by an officer of ordinary talents, the influence of the vice-consulate would be considerably lessened. If the general correctness of the foregoing distinction between the state of affairs in the Urmia and Soujboulak districts be admitted, the question arises whether it would not be possible, in the event of Russian action in Azerbaijan coming up for discussion, to recognise in some way her exceptional position in the districts north of latitude 37 °, which would exclude the whole of the Soujboulak district^ except Solduz, which is closely related by language to the Ushnu district of which it was formerly a part. Soujboulak might then be placed under Kurdistan, thus creating a buffer province out of the Kurdish-speaking tribes, who are, ethnologically and politically, a race wholly apart from the Turkish tribes of Azerbaijan ; finally Great Britain and Russia mUht asfree not to send consuls or otherwise interest themselves in the affairs of Kurdistan. *. . . . , * I make these suggestions in entire ignorance of what the views of His Majesty s Government on the subject may be and with the greatest diffidence, and trust that your Excellency will pardon me for the liberty I have taken in addressing you at such length on subjects which lie altogether beyond the sphere of my present duties.

I reminded him that when I first made represen tations to him on the subject I had been informed that the only object which the intervention of consuls had in view was to facilitate collection of revenues, but that none of revenue thus collected ever found its way into the Persian Treasury. I trusted that, in view of what you had said in your telegram No. 958 of 1st November, that he would take this opportunity of giving Persia proof of his good-will by instructing the consuls to hand over proceeds of the taxes which they had collected to the Persian Treasury. His Excellency referred once more to the necessity of providing for repayment of advances made by Russian Bank to certain Persian subjects, while I contended that bank had no right to recover its bad debts at expense of Persian Government. Minister for Foreign Affairs promised to go into the question and to let me have an answer shortly. [1104 — 192]Secret: Coinm SecretCONFIDENTIAL. 0 Sir W.

WITH reference to my telegram No. 210 of the 27th ultimo, I have the honour to forward to you herewith translation of the memorandum presented to the Persian Government by the Russian Legation on the 25th July, in reply to the Persian memorandum of the 27th June, embodying the grievances of the Persian Government against the Russian Government. It is not clear to whom allusion is made in the last paragraph. I understand that the “ Russkoe Slovo,” of Moscow, in publishing the Russian reply has stated that His Majesty’s Legation is meant. The French Minister tells me that, having learnt from one oi his staff, who has close relations with the Russian Legation, that he and I were accused of having drafted the note, which we had subsequently caused to be presented to the Persian Government by the German Minister^ He spoke very strongly to M. Korostovetz upon the subject, pointing out that it was intolerable that he should have allowed his staff to give credence to and circulate such an outrageous story. M. Lecomte has also complained of the incident to the French Government^ As far as I am aware, there is no reason whatever to suppose that the Persian Government sought the advice or assistance of any foreigner in the matter of the drafting of the memorandum, though it is possible that the document may have been shown to the German Minister, and perhaps also to the Austrian Minister and the Turkish Ambassador, before it was presented to M. Korostovetz. My French colleague, 1 am sure, had no previous knowledge of its contents, and, acting on your instructions, Sir, I refused to discuss the matter. I kept my Russian colleague informed of the preparation of the memorandum and of the attitude I had adopted throughout. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure in No. 1. Memorandum communicated to Persian Government by Russian Legation, dated Ramazan 1, 1332 (July 25, 1914). IN reply to the memorandum dated the 23rd June, presented by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I am instructed by the Imperial Russian Government to bring t e following points to the notice of the Persian Government. 1 . There is no objection to the abolition of the arrangement come to with the Treasurer-General respecting taxes due from Russian subjects, and proteges, provi e that the proper coHection of such taxes from such persons continue to be supervisee &gt;y the Imperial Russian consulates ; provided that the whole of the taxes of the northern provinces of Persia be paid over at once to the Banque d Escoitipte m sue i a va\ as may be acceptable to the said bank ; and provided that Russian consulates have the right to control expenditure of the taxes in question. , T • i 2. As Shuja-ud-Dowleh wishes, for reasons of ill-health, to resign, the Impel la Russian Government, in order to meet the wishes of the Persian Gov ernmen , agrees o the appointment of his Royal Highness the Heir-Apparent as Governor enera o Azerbaijan, but only on condition that (to avoid his entourage interfering m e administration of the province, with the difficulties and troubles of a un s u ensue) His Royal Highness should not proceed to Tabriz, but be content wi i is nominal appointment to the Governor-Generalship. 1 o meet the wis es o e ei sian [225 l h— 8 ] 16 OCT 1914 h50CWl4;Government the Imperial Russian Government agree to the appointment of Prince Farman Farma as acting Governor of Azerbaijan. 3 Th e Imperial Russian Government is utterly unable to accept the construction out by the Persian Government on article 5 of the Treaty of Turcomanchai, viz., that^ Russian subjects have not the right to acquire landed property in I ersia. 4. The Imperial Russian Government consider the recall ol the Russian troops' from Persia inopportune as yet, and they further state that the ultimate withdrawal of those trooos depends largely upon the increase of the Imperial Cossack Brigade and a recognition of the brigade’s right to maintain law and order. The Russian Government will Shortly be in a position to improve and to reform the brigade. { In conclusion, the Imperial Russian Government draws the attention of Persian Ministers to the impropriety of the Persian Government having recourse to unsuitable quarters for assistance in matters which concern the Persian Government alone. The latter must have learnt by past experience that the Imperial Government do not allow anyone to interfere with their relations with Persia, and such action (on the part of j only prevents the friendly solution of difficulties betw een the two Governments.#3 h Pat away with CONFIDENTIAL.

I have the honour to address Your Excellency on the subject of the Lynch Road. I had intended to submit this report directly on arrival in Ispahan, but have been prevented by more pressing work. The subject resolves itself into several heads, which I will deal with sertattm. 1. Road Surface.—] regret to say that the road is worse than I have ever before seen it. The attached Schedule, No. I, shows the places where repair, diversion, or attention, is imperatively necessary. I use the word advisedly, for had I said necessary 1 should have had to mention almost every mile of the hill section. The road is in an awful state and its difficulty is testified to by the numerous skeletons and corpses of transport animals of every kind, in all stages of nauseous decay, which strew the hill section. 2. Caravanserais and FoWs.-Had anybody taken the trouble to climb up to the 'forts” and to inspect the caravanserais, about which so much has been written in despatches during the last couple of years, the absolute futility of te former and the inadequacy of the latter would have been exposed at a glance. Both “ forts ” and caravanserais are but such in name, having no being whatever. Schedule II shows the 'forts” and the degree of their futility in detail suffice it to say here that one is a heap of ruins, another is merely an u .^ n ‘ sh ® d b n ®f‘j work’with neither door nor roof, one is so hopelessly commanded at a r g 600 yards from surrounding hills as to be absolutely .untenable, the rnajonty are so far removed from water as to render the garrison liable A e r ^ u , straits for water in a very few hours, there not even bemg any provis on for stonnp either food or water. The caravanserais are little better. Schedu ' e ^ state in detail, their owners and their leasing value per annum. Malam, caravan serai is good and in good repair, all the rest are in all stages of disrepair, decay, and consequent inadequacy. 3. Supplies and /Wrfer-Famine prices rule throughout the Hill secfon.wkh | consequential inflation of hire rates, and subsequent hampering “ u * 111 gives, in the form of a comparative table, the rise m prices from Arabistan to the hill section and thence the decrease to the Chahar Mahal end of the road- the unit remaining constant throughout. There are various causer giving rise to these high prices, fi r f'lnd^is'let tem itself. Each serai belongs to a separate Khan or p At the end of out by them for a large sum of money annually to a a • the season, on one pretext or another, the owner fines the lessee a ' arge ^ ( hese pockets the cash. It will be, therefore, seen that in order to cover ^these heavy drains on his resources and also to make is quo , Another is that exorbitant rates for supplies. This is the primary cau e. Another &gt;s tha the 11, when migrating use this road and make free , with the young mops, to the detriment of the ultimate outturn. Anot er is C98FD (■ ' IV \ 15 OCT 1914,t, 4 / India, i FtL.ud Secretary’s No 38 M, dated 17 SEP 1914 32 cultivation in the vicinity of the road in the hill section is not sufficient both to support the inhabitants and to provide for large numbers of caravans; conse quently wheat and such food stuffs have to be brought up from Malamir and the surrounding districts, and down from the Chahar Mahal. Another cause incidental to this year, is the scarcity due to last year’s shortage of rain, but this is only incidental and in no way accounts for the enormous rise in prices, which has been going on during the past 3 years. Even in the last few years the rise has been unprecedented—hire rates which I can remember were 70 Krans are to-day 210 Krans. 4. Protection .—Next comes the most important question, that of protection f of the road. I am glad to say that up to the present, this season, the safety of the road has left nothing to be desired. When on the road, information reached me of the presence of a large band or Taibi marauders, who were awaiting a favourable opportunity, in conjunction with a fordable Karun, to harry the road. The river was at the time high and 1 reckoned on some 10 or 12 days respite, and in response to urgent representa tions which I made to him, the Sardar-i-Jang made such arrangements as have preserved the safety of the road intact up to date. It may not be out of place, briefly, to recapitulate the arrangements made tor Your Excellency’s information. The protection of the road itself from Darra Barfi (vide page 157, March 9 , Deh Diz. 1 he Bakhtiari Tribes and their Chiefs ” by Ranking. Darra Barfi is situated between Kulmut and Deh Kuneh) to Gandumkar (vide item page 158, March 12, Du Pulan) has been handed over to Reza Khan of Deh Diz and his adherents, the Aulad-i-Haji Ali and others. The sons of Ali Murad Khan Taibi, and All Murad Khan, Bahama!, have been handed over to the Sardar-i- Jang as hostages for the good behaviour of their tribes, and lastly, the fords over the Karun leading to the Gardand-Belut Buland, Shalil, and Sarkhun, have been handed over to the Kuhgilu to protect. As yet I am unaware of the exact quid pro, which the kuhgilus receive for their services, but expect it wnll be about 5,000 I, for the season. • . 5 - Tr Transport animals on the road are scarce owdng (i) to the high prices of fodder, (ti) the difficulty of the road, and (iu) lack oUccommoda- edlv LhXTm ho P e when defec ‘s have been remedied, as they undoubt- a Genuine efinr^ eSSrS ; ^ ? r0th . erS a ? d the Bakhtiar i Khans will really make arfanpemenu rt ‘h' P ut , su Sg estl&lt; ’ n ?

Lynch Brothers will be lost altogether. ' Already we have Persian firms competing successfully, and now the Germans have entered the lists, and will, I foresee, before very long have Consuls or Vice- Consuls in both Ahwaz and Ispahan and will make a strenuous effort to capture the trade of the road. They are already competing, as I have already reported in the transport business in the person of Haji Fathullah Fathi of Ahwaz. Reference /.—I had intended to talk over the question of road repairs with the Sardar-i-Jang in the High Country, but unfortunately he has his hands more than full with the Kuhgilu Campaign in the Low Country—when he comes up I shall see him, but in the meanwhile I am writing to the Sirdar-i-Bahadur on the subject. Annual repairs are necessary, but at best are but temporary palliatives—we want to get to the root of the evil. The chief disintegrating factor is the II. In their annual migrations up and down the road, they go along it in hoardes, with their flocks, herds, and cattle which straggle all over the hill side, above and below the road—those above send showers of stones and earth on to the road, those below dislodge stones and earth the hillside gives way and down comes the roadway. I have travelled with the II in past years and have seen what havoc they can cause. The remedy I suggest is that all the Khans be approached to forbid the II, or if the Khans are willing for the Sardar-i-Jang to do so, with perhaps the ex ception of those having their habitat in Chighakhor, and on whom the prohibition would impose unnecessary hardship, from using the Lynch Road. They would have to use the Susan route, coming out in the Upper Dinarun Country. Thisw’ould necessitate the Khans making some form of petty arrangements at Susan for crossing the Karun. In such years as the present this might be attended with some difficulty, but the crossing, when last I saw it, was not such as would be by any means impossible. This prohibition of the II and regular annual repairs, properly carried out, would remedy the first evil. Reference 2 .—The forts should be made so in reality and placed in places of strategical advantage, in the proximity of water and be made habitable, so that in cases of necessity they would be of use, and not as at present, useless for the purpose for which they have been built. They have been an expense to the Khans, who have evidently been badly cheated by the building contractors. The caravanserais should be put in a proper state of repair, so as to afford shelter and accommodation to caravans using the road. Reference 3 .—The question of supplies is the key-note of the whole situation. Till the present inflated prices can be brought down, the road will not be a success. When Mr. Tod of Lynch Brothers came to inspect their Ahwaz Agency in May last I made a suggestion to him, and similarly to Mr. Wilson, whom I met at Malamir, en route to relieve Mr. Abel in the Ahw r az Agency. The suggestion was that Messrs. Lynch Brothers themselves should take over the leases of the serais, put their own agents therein, and fodder the hill section. Mr. Wilson expressed his willingness to do so, but only in so far as it concerned their own caravans. My own personal opinion is that these half measures would only make confusion w’orse confounded. We should be faced with the anomoly of two les sees in each caravanserai—one Lynch’s, one the Khan’s—and unless I am much mistaken, the Khan’s man would find ways and means of making his colleague’s position untenable. It must be all Lynch or no Lynch. The main opposition we have to expect to the scheme is from the Khans themselves. Why? Because the sources of annual income from fines would be shut off, if Lynch were the lessee.4 I broached the subject also to ‘he Arm J frankl what j expected, prior to his departure for Europe, and told h. ^ ^ ^ ^ lossto the £^ but pointed out to him that financia y fodder and supply question being with every hope even of a financia gam The increase and satisfactory, muleteers would be attracted to the roao r with it the bridge tolls, which go into the Khans pocke . It is not worth while, in the present nebulous s ‘f^^^’^^up^the whether Messrs. Lynch Brothers would or would ^ t be '' Uln ^° p ro pos?tion whole contracts for the serais, to go into the financial a ®P ect = T ’ but I may here state that the leases for the current year a f^ ated ‘; : and there is no doubt that there is money to be made 'P ' e , wise the Khans would get no one to { ake ‘p 61 ', ?' n : ts as n e cts with many Ahwaz, 1 have talked about the Lynch Road in all '‘^spects wtftmay merchants, both there and in Ispahan, and have tried ‘ 0 0 ! 3,aia their VleWS to find where the shoe pinches, with a view to remedying detects. Inter alios I have been in close touch with the Amin-ut-Tujjar of Ispahan, who U the local agent of the A. P. O. C„ and have been trying to consort w. h him plans whereby we could lessen freights and particularly as regards oil, to be able to compete with the Russian oil. One point which I am suggesting to the A. P.a C, is that they should reduce the size of their drums by half,-this will allow ° f acl '’ f tleS l '. ka ?“ ling, allowing of other transport besides camels being used, allow of the01 '° g taken into the surrounding districts, both of Ispahan and the Chahar Maha . by the smaller traders on donkeys, and will secure a more ready market locally t the large drums. One means of reducing freights would be to run a cart service from Ispahan to Dehkurd, primarily to bring in the oil landed at the latter p ace on ran ^P animals, and at other times such local freight as may be offering, a / agricultural produce. The Amin-ut Tujjar is very favourably disposed towards the scheme and is willing to charge only a nominal freight for the 01 • .. I am collecting statistics with a view to seeing if the potentialities o e market here offer sufficient inducement to the improving of the Awamyen- Malamir section of the road, to allow of carts bringing up the oil to Malamir. Should cartage be possible at each end. as I am convinced it is this end, it would reduce freights enormously, and we should be able to underse t e Russian oil here in Ispahan itself, with possibilities of expansion. The cartage scheme, if a success, might even be expanded into a. combine between Messrs. Lynch Brothers and the A. P. O. C., for the carriage o a freights offering for Ispahan, besides oil. This would make Malamir and Deh Kurd at each end of the hill section the termini of the pack transport, and would necessitate the establishment o depots in each place. Both are admirably suited as regards space, fodder, water, etc., the nrotection of Malamir heina the onlv nuestion in troubulous years. 1 I have asked Mr. Douglas of the Railway Syndicate to look at the road for me on the way up to Ispahan, my intention being to see if it would be wort while suggesting a feeder line from Ahwaz, or wherever the Railway line passes in its vicinity, to the foot of the Gardan-i-Sarrak near Malamir, besides getting his technical advice on the road as a whole. The greater part of this line wou be a ** surface line ” and comparatively cheap, and if the Mohammerah-Diz u section of the Railway is taken in hand first, it would both act as a feeder to this section, whereby commencing its earnings at as early a date as possible, an at the same time fit in with a scheme for reducing freights on the Lynch Road. Reference 4 .—The question of the safety of the road is another extremely important one. It is not possible to lay down any hard and fast lines, as eve ^ thing depends on the political situation, which varies from year to y ea L u speaking generally, I can see no reason to modify the opinion, which I have always held that the best results will be obtained by interesting the Kuhgilu in the prosperity of the road.The correctness of this opinion was demonstrated, I understand by the satisfactory results attending their use as road guards last year, and similarly this year, since they were put to guard the fords. I further advocate entering into direct relations with the Kuhgilu tribes them selves, in pursuance^ of which policy I made a tour in the Kuhgilu country in 1909, with the happiest results, for it twice saved my caravan from being looted en route to Arabistan in the following year. On two occasions, once at the Gardan-i-Lugham r ir and once at Oala Madrasseh two bands of marauders, numbering 40 or 50 Kuhgilus stopped me at the head of my caravan, in tne former case opening fire on us, but it so hap pened that each party contained men I had met down in the Kuhgilu country, and the whole party escorted us along the road through the danger zone—and then turned back and looted the next caravan ! This shows the value of per sonal relations with them. Reference 5.—l have already outlined the means by which I propose to strike at the causes conducing to scarcity of transport on the road. The causes re moved, the scarcity will disappear. Reference 6.—The road inspectors, if they work honestly, should be able to do much to assist traffic on the road and obviate unnecessary delays. Reference 7.—I propose to remedy this defect by stationing a man of my • own choosing at Deh Diz, where all caravans must pass, who will be solely in my employ, who will have no cause to understate figures, unless he is heavily bribed by the bridge-keepers and this l think is unlikely, and who will know that unless he does his work thoroughly and well that he will be removed. I shall so arrange his report that I shall be able to use the figures which I shall get from Messrs. Lynch Brothers as a check on him ; but this scheme I can only put in force if Your Excellency can see your way To allotting me another 5 T. per mensem. The value of correct statistics is such that at io-T. per mensem they will not be dearly bought, where incorrect statistics would be a waste of even 5 T. per mensem. While dealing with this branch of the subject, I would request Your Excel lency to transfer to the Ahwaz Vice-Consulate account with the Imperial Bank of Persia, Ispahan, such sum as may be due under this head as soon as possible so as to enable me to make the proposed arrangement prior to leaving Ispahan this autumn. Reference 8 .—The “ dokash ” system will be difficult to stop, for it enables muleteers to graze their cattle in the Low and High Countries in their respective grazing seasons. The only thing to be done is to restrict it as much as possible on contracts and to enforce the penalty clause, if the period is exceeded, with far greater severity than heretofore. I saw a good example of how delays occur, on my way up this year. A num ber of Turks took loads on contract from Lynch in Nassiri for Ispahan and took them to Malamir, where they dumped them. Thence they returned to their “garmsir ,, , picked up their families and cattle and proceeded to take them by leisurely stages to their summer quarters in the High Country. After which they proposed to return and take their loads to Ispahan. At the rate they were travelling when I met them, they would exceed any reasonable time for delivery in Ispahan, but seemed to have no fear of their penalty clause being enforced. The system is particularly noxious towards the end of the season, upward loads getting dumped on the Ahwaz side of the Burra Murda Pass, and similarly downward loads mutatis mutandis. In years of heavy snow fall, when the Pass becomes impassable, these goods get shut out till the Pass opens again. The inspectors would be useful in such cases to see that loads were dumped on the destination-side of the Pass. If this were done, not only would the system be rendered inocuous, but even might be made the means of keeping the trans port business in full blast even with the Pass closed. For winter traffic a serai is badly needed at Gandumkar, with sufficient accommodation for both man and beast, and sufficient supplies, especially cf fuel.There is yet another cause tending to militate against the general efficiency of the road. The serias at various stages in the upper section and Chahar Mahal are, - like those in the hill section, the property of various owners, viz., Naghun, be- * longing to Muntazzem-ud-Dowleh, Shalamzar belonging to Samsam-us-Saltana, Shamsabad to the Amir-i-Mujahid, and Kaf-i-Rukh to the Munazzem-ul-Mulk. In these serais the right to sell supplies at any price they choose is claimed by the owners or their agents, and there is not the pretence even of a fixed rate and a fixed weight, as in the hill section. In both sections the “ dalundars ” make the utmost they can, but to the rapacity of those in the upper section then* are no bounds, as they are not officially under the Ilkhani. The only check on their rapacity is that muleteers can often buy from villagers. Some arrangement should be come to by which the serais also can be put officially under the orders of the Ilkhani, to the extent of the prices to be charged, and punishment in cases of disobedience. It will not do away with extortion, but will lessen the evil. Lastly, in every question concerning the road, and in every other Bakhtiar question, we are faced with the obstacle represented by the inter-family enmity which is at the bottom of nearly everything, which takes place in the Bakhtiar Country. I would tender my apologies to Your Excellency for the length of this des patch, but it has been impossible to compress it into less. SCHEDULE I.

Foreign Office, London. 0 '&gt; 0 ' , Sir ..iu„ reference to your letter of the 29th of June last, F. 225b, regarding possible means of rehabilitating British interests in South Persia, I am directed by oecretary Sir Edward G-rey to transmit to you herewith, to oe ia ^ oe i° re the Marquess of Crewe, a copy of a telegram c,nci oi a despatch from His Majest 3 / ,, s Minister at Teheran on the subject. Lord Crewe will no doubt concur in Sir E. Grey's opinion that the international political situation, which has since arisen* renders undesirable, if not impossible, the adoption of many of the measures advocated by Sir W. Townley: but he considers that with a view to strengthen the British position in Arabistan, the present opportunity might well be taken to give to the Sheikh of Mohaimierah the amended assurances proposed by Sir P. Cox in Paragraph 17 of his despatch to the Government of India No. 3713 of 7th Ihe Under Secretary of State, India Office.(47403/14) 7th December, 1913. Tx Lora brewe is of the same opinion Sir E. Orey hopes that His Lordship will cause the necessary- instructions to oe sent to His Majesty's Consular officers at Bushire and Mohamnerah without delay. Sir E. Drey does not think it necessary to make any communication to the Persian Government on the subject at present. He would however propose to make a confidential communication to the Russian Government as soon as the assurances shall have been given to the Sheikh.

(Telegraphic.) YOUR telegram No. 153 of 14th July. Viceroy of India’s telegram of 11 th June Tehran, July 23, 1914. Can His ]\[ajesty s Government persuade Russian Government to so far abandon men present policy in Persia as to return to status quo existing at the time of the signature of convention of 1907 ? If the answer to this question is in the negative and we know the answer before even the question is put, there would appear to be no alternative but to adopt policy which must lead to partition sooner or later. Russia cannot withdraw from the position she has created for herself in the north Her subjects have acquired large landed interests impossible to abandon, unless Persia could buy them out. She cannot relinquish her claim to refuse Persian authorities permission to enter villages bought or leased without an intolerable loss of prestige. rurther, regeneration of Persia depended, in my opinion, upon the European- administered institutions. Attitude of Russia towards the gendarmerie and the Belgian financial administration has so discredited these institutions as to render their future utility more than problematical, unless they can be re-established in public esteem by some marked act of open support. Therefore it would seem that the British Indian policy proposed is the only one to be adopted at the point we have now reached, but the less stress laid upon the integrity and independence of Persia the better. Even, however, after the sacrifice of that chimera, the 1907 convention seems to me to remain a working proposition, provided that the present areas can be maintained by an understanding between the two Governments as to what each can do in its own zone, and, above all, if the position of each in the neutral zone is absolutely and clearly defined. \ ital British interests concerned demand that this zone in its almost entirety should come under the preponderating influence of His Majesty’s Government. Public opinion in Russia would probably never tolerate open avowal of this. It seems therefore essential that we gradually acquire tacit consent of Russia to protect our own interests. This could probably best be done by putting British officers on trade routes, in manner suggested in the Viceroy’s telegram, in the place of Swedes, and by getting the various important tribal chiefs from Turkish frontier to Kerman to ask for loan of military advisers. I propose to deal with the other points mentioned in India Office letter by despatch. It would almost appear as if w r e have now reached point where a semblance of Persian independence can alone be maintained by means of a loan with a commission of control.

IN accordance with the instructions contained in your teleeram Nn ttio 14th u timo, I dealt in my telegram No. 203 of the 23rd ultimo with what appeared to t i e m °i St lm P° rtant P omt f touched upon m the letter from the India Office of the 29th June last upon the subject of the rehabilitation of British interests in No^l69^ of S the^ls^ultnno. ^ t0 t0 me with des P atch t adove “ men ^ 0 / ie d l^ e ^ ram I expressed my concurrence with the broad lines of the telegram from the Viceroy of India of the 11 th June last if His Majesty’s Government had made up their mind that British intervention in the south has become imperative, and that Persian independence and integrity can no longer be maintained even m effigy. It is true that recent Russian actions in Northern and Central Persia have robbed those sonorous words of any effective meaning; but it appears to me hard to shut one s eves to the fact that the policy advocated must inevitabD lead to a partition, at a, sooner or later date. It is possible that the Marquess of Crewe may be right when his Lordship expresses the opinion that the proposed measures, carried* out in the spirit which animates His Majesty’s Government, would in reality tend actively to promote the_independence and integrity of Persia. It is clear that such would not be the impression made upon the average mind, and I think that it would be fairly safe to assert that such would not be their actual result. It is probable that this desirable aim might be achieved were His Majesty’s Government alone in the field to grapple with the Persian question, but it is clear that the Russians would not under stand such a policy in this light, and that they would adopt an attitude in Northern Persia that would force the hand of His Majesty’s Government, and leave but little left of the phantom of Persian independence and integrity. j The Russian reproach that His Majesty’s Government would appear to be seeking the monopoly of railway construction in the neutral zone made it amply clear, though I have been more than once assured to the contrary by M. Korostovetz, that the Government of St. Petersburgh is by no means prepared to let Great Britain have a free hand in that zone, in which all our most important commercial interests are concen trated. Such being the case, it would appear most desirable that no revision of the zones should be attempted, but that the tacit consent of the Russian Government should be secured by diplomatic methods to our taking the necessary measures to protect our interests already long established before the convention of 1907. • It is the difficult problem of how to safeguard British interests in the neutral zone, in face of steady Russian penetration southwards, which has caused me to cast about in an effort to disc ove r some alternative sc heme acceptable to both parties which might obviate a consideration offhertiwEward^question of the neutral zone. The subject has ieen gone into fully in an accom panying despatch, and I need only add here, in connection with the neutral zoneTFifficuTty, fL'aFTT would appear to me that it will be v ery hard to secure our position in the Gulf and lands bordering thereon unless some anangement is reached with Russia under which she agrees not to push her influence urther south. Persians are very susceptible to external influences, and, as long as hussia appears to hold a predominant position in Central Persia, we shall never be able to rely with any amount of confidence upon the loyalty of tribal friends, unless we ake practical steps to bind them to us by more than moral ties. ;* As regards the attitude that should be adopted towards Sheikh Khazal and his cus in order to strengthen our position in Arabistan, I feel that I am not qualified to give an opinion, and that His Majestj-’s Government can be much better guided in this uiatter by the local authorities in the Gulf region. I would merely observe that it vouid appear to me that, in dealing with the nature of protection can be properly r- _ 0 &gt;'• '' \ [2251 A—12] Copy f - 0 ;rc&lt;^a \accorded to the Sheikh, it would he well to bear in mind that the Bakhtiaris have some claim upon our good-will, and that their estrangement from the British cause might be followed by unfortunate consequences for our position in Central and South-Western^, Persia. There has always appeared to me to exist a tendency at Bushire and Moham- * merah to consider the Sheikh can do no wrong, and that he must always be right in his differences with the Bakhtiaris. I do not think that this is always the case. Quite recently we have seen the Sheikh supporting Hussein Khan, Bahmai, secretly in his rebellion against the Bakhtiaris. The action was taken at the instigation of Amir-i- Mujahed, Bakhtiari, one of the worst and most troublesome of the khans, who is a close friend of Sheikh TChasal. ( y As regards the suggestion contained in the India Office letter that the Anglo- Persian Company should be required to maintain at its own expense a corps of local levies, it is not quite clear whether the Oil Company or the Railway Company is meant. As far as the affairs of the latter company are concerned, I am inclined to the opinion that an arrangement can well be made with some powerful local chieftain, such as the A ali of Pusht-i-Kuh, under which the safety of the railway works can be secured and at the same time an effective native barrier established in the mountains of Luristan, which should serve as an invaluable check to any unexpected pressure from the nonh that might at any time bear down disadvantageously upon the oil-bearing districts and the important interests that, it is hoped, will be created by the railway. It should not be beyond the power of diplomacy, exercised both locally and at Tehran, to effect such an arrangement with the knowledge and the approval of the Persian Government, which would not, I think, raise any objection to measures, even if they included a subvention, intended to strengthen Persia’s position in those districts. It is a feature of the situation that requires careful attention, because there is small doubt that this British railway venture is regarded with very jealous eyes in Russia. We have recently had ample proof at Kermanshah that Russian friendship is not deep enough to re.dst the temptation to encourage a state of local disturbance that is inimical to British trade entering Persia. \\ e may certainly expect that every possible obstacle v ill be put in the way of the execution of the Mohammerah-Khoremabad Railway, the fermenting of local disorders it one of the easiest methods of blocking the enterprise. We may be sure that it will be resorted to in such a favourable district as unstan unless we can assure the position beforehand by binding a really strong e einent to oui side, such as the \ ali of Pusht-i-Kuh, by some arrangement of a remuneratwe nature to himself and to the Governor-General. 7 16 question connected with the lease or purchase of the islands in the Persian VT w b f e t n u d T lt W1 n el ? ew kere and does not appear to call for comment here.

Cs&amp;iiess in spending money and a want of consideration for3 a In the north the good work done by the Swedes is more apparent. The road from Harnadan to Kazvm, which was infested by robber bands, is now safe, and little ha” ^en heard for some time past of disorders round Tehran. As far as the radius of the .ndarmene extends there is perfect order. The road from Tehran to Kum and from me latter place to Sultanabad has been only occasionally troubled by a band of robber” whose chiefs have been killed and themselves dispersed. Posts have been established on the road from Sultanabad to Buruprd, a district that was last year harried by Lur raiders, and the presence of the gendarmes at Burujird and on the road to Khoremabad has enabled N i/.am-es-Sultaneh to inaugurate measures for the pacification of Luristan under much more favourab e conditions than could have been anticipated a year ago, when no Governor-General would have been found to undertake the task. This improved state of affairs may have valuable results for the safety of the British railway survey party which it is hoped to take through this autumn from Dizful to Khoremabad. , 0 Ike question of the replacing of the Swedish by British officers in the neutral and British zones has been fully dealt with in preceding despatches. At the present moment the position of the Swedes is a precarious one. Their prestige was sorely i shaken by the announcement made by M. Korostovetz soon after his arrival here that ■ they did not enjoy the confidence of the Russian Government, which did not wish to see the scope of their duties extended into the north of Persia. From the day of that announcement they have felt no security in the continuation of their mission in Persia and their work has suffered. Now Persia is confronted with the difficulty of findino- the necessary funds for the upkeep of the gendarmerie, and the Swedes not unnaturally refuse to be held responsible for the good conduct of their men when they no longer receive their pay regularly. It would appear to me that a collapse of the gendarmerie under the conditions prevailing in Europe, which make it improbable that either Great Britain or Russia would be able to spare officers to take the place of the Swedes, would he a catastrophe. It is impossible to foretell what may happen should the gendarmes get out of hand or should the gentry who recently made the roads unsafe realise that the iron hand of order has been relaxed.

IN conversation yesterday, Minister for Foreign Affairs said that he had heard irom lehran that even in such centres of Russian influence as Resht and Tabriz o() per cent, of Maliat was to be paid into Imperial Bank. He could not, he said consent to an arrangement so humiliating to Russian prestige. I explained that Imperial Bank had the right by charter to conduct financial transactions all over Persia, and as its terms were far more favourable than those of the Russian Bank, the Persian Government naturally preferred to have dealing with it. 6 His Excellency reverted to the subject again this morning, when I handed him an aide-memoire embodying Tehran telegram No. 275+of Iflth September, and first paragraph of your telegram No. 231 of 22nd September to Tehran. As his Excellency had mentioned the fact that Russian Bank had been foolish m advancing considerable sums to Persians who were more or less insolvent, I said that reason why Persian Government objected to proceeds of taxes beiug paid into Russian Bank was the fact that these funds were used, for recouping bank for its bad debts or to satisfy other claims. r Ihis objection might be got over if Russian Government would guarantee that taxes paid into bank should not be used for such purposes, but should be remitted integrally to Persian Treasury. His Excellency contended that nearly all the loans made by Russian banks to individual Persians had been made with the approval of the Persian Government, and that the latter were therefore responsible for them. I argued that so long as the war lasted, and until we had time to discuss the whole Persian question thoroughly, we ought not to increase Persia’s financial difficulties by pressing the claims of our respective subjects, and I suggested that Russian Bank might be instructed to make over to Persian Treasury all the sums paid into it on account of taxes. His Excellency said that he would examine this question as well as the aide-memoire which I had given him, and send me a written answer. As the conversation then turned on the Persian situation, I took the opportunity of reading certain notes which I had made on Sir W. Townley’s despatches Nos. 237 and 238, in order to show that, in spite of assurances which I had received last June, conduct of Russian consuls had not changed for the better. On my repeating what I lave so often said before, that North Persia was fast becoming a Russian province, his Excellency retorted that Southern Persia and the Gulf districts were virtually British. 1 replied that they were not in the occupation of our^troops, and that, while we did all we could to act up to both the letter and the spirit of the 1907 agreement, Russian consuls were acting in such flagrant opposition to the principle on which it was founded, Riat 1 was afraid that Russia might one day be accused of having as little respect for a written agreement as Germany. I knew it was difficult to do anything at present moment, but I trusted that at close of war we should be able to arrive at some definite agreement that would remove all possible misunderstandings in future. His Excellency expressed his entire concurrence and asked me to send him a copy of notes which I had read out to him. I promised to do so on understanding that tt was to be regarded as a private communication, as despatches in question had not yet reached you. ^3' g)In any further communica tion on this subject, please quote n °-wK j and address— j The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London.

I had intended to submit thin report directly on arrival in Isfahan,but have been pre - vented by more preaeing work. The subject resolves itself into several heads, which I will doe! with seriatim. U) woed gervi e . I regret to say that the condition of the road is worse than I have ever before seen it. The attached schedule, Ho. l.showF the places where repair if, divers ion, or ettention is imperatively necessary. I use the word ad - visedly,for had I said necessary I should have had to men - tion almost every mile of the hill section. The road is in en awful state and its difficulty is testified to by the numerous skeletons of horses,of transport animals of every kind,in all stages of nauseous decay which strew the hill seotion. (*) aravanaerajs ic rorts . Had anyone taken the trouble to climb up to the 'forts** and to inspect the caravanserais,about which so much has been written in despatches during the last couple of ye are, the absolute futility of the former, and the inad equacy of the latter would have been exposed at a gl&amp;noe. Both 81 r W.Townley.K. .1.0., •» £to •, &amp;c. %V r» oth # forte ' and dft-avanserais are but euch In naiiie, having no being whatever. Schedule 2 shows the 'forte* t.nd the degree of their futility in detail - suffice it to &amp;(%y here t at one is a heap of ruins # another is merely an unfinished breaatwotk. with neither door o nor roof, one is so hopelessly ooLmanded at a range of six hundred yards from the surrounding hille as to fe abec* utely u; ^tenable, and the i^ajority are so far removed from water as to render the garrison liable to be re duced to straits for water in a very few hours, there not even being any provision for storing either food or water, fhe Caravanserais are little better, sottedule 2 ahovs their state in detail, their owners, and their leasing value per annum. Lalaair caravans rat is good -nd in good repair, all the rest are in ail stages of d srepa.r, detay, and ooneequent inadequacy. g&gt; Supplies and fodder. Famine prices rule throughout the hill section, w th consequential inflation of hire rates, and subse quent hampering of trade. Sohedule 3 gives, in the form d of a Comparative table, the risfeag- in pride from jkrab- istan to the hill &amp;e tlon and thence the decrease to the r oahar kahal end of the road - the unit remaining con stant throughout. ©lere are various causes giving rise to these high prices, first of all the system itself. Each serai belongs to a separate Fhan or pair of Khans and is let out by them for a large sum of money annua 1 ly to a 'dalumdar* . At the end of the season, on one pretext# or another, the owner fines the lessee a large sum, and poccets the cash. It will be therefore seen tliat in orderto cover these heavy drains on hie resources and also to make his Quota t the lessee must charge exorbitant rates Tor supplies. This is the primary cause. Another is that the IX,when migrating,use this road and make free with the young crops to the detriment of the ultimate outturn. Another is the area under cultivation in the vicinity of the road in the hill section aa* not sufficient both to support the inhabitants and to provide x*or large numbers of caravans ; consequently wheat and such food stuffs havd. to be brought up from halsmir and down from the chaha/^ yahal. Another cause .incidental to this year ,1s the Scarcity due to last year's shortage of rain ; but this is only incid ntal and in no way accounts for the enor ~ Mas rise in prices .whih has been going on during the pasl* three years. Even in the last few years the rise has been hire unprecedented — hrtWr rates which I can remaaber 70 krans.are today ttlo krans. (4) Prof oUon. most Next comes the important question .that of protection of the road. 1 am glad to say that up to the present .this season, the safe ty of th~ road has left no ~ thing to be desired. When on the road, Informat ion reached me of the presence of a large band of Taibi marauders, who were awaiting a favourable opportunity,in conjunct ion with a fordable larun.to harry the road, fhe river was at the time high and 1 reckoned on some 10 or 12 days respite,and in response to urgent representations which I made to him,the Serdar Jang xaade such arrangements as have preserved the safety of the road up to date. It may not be out of place briefly to recapitulate the arrangements made for Tour Excellency's information.inror nation. protection of the roed Itself froa Earl's Barfi (vide p.l57 f ;_*rdh S.Dehdis,'the Bakhtiari Tribes &amp; Their hiefs' by Banking ; Darra Barfi is situated between KuXciud and peh Kuneh) to Qanduzokar (vide idea p.l58 f iaroh 1*.Dopolun) has been handed over to Resa Khan oi‘ Dehdis and his adherents, the Aula i-Raji Ali and others. OSae sons or All r.urad Khan # Taibl ,and Ali lurad Khan,] ahmai,have been handed over to the Sard&amp;r-i-Jang as hostages for the good behavi our of their tribe,and lastly the fords over the Karun leading to the Gar dan-i 'elut Puland.Bhalil ,wid Sarkhun, have been handed over to the luhgslui to protect. As yet I aia unaware of the exact quid pro quo which the ruhgsluis receive for their services,but expe t it will be about 8,:)00 Toiasns for the season. Transport anicals on the road are scarce owing i/ to the high prices o- fodder, i/ the difficulty of the road, and 3/ lack of acoOi..odation. I have every hope when thet a defects have been remedied, as they undoubtedly can be, if Lynch Bros, and the Ba htiari Khans will really Lake a genuine effort to put suggestions into force, and not simply make mythical arrangenents, which have no being, that transport prices will go down, and the road become, what it should be, one of the main arteries of trade from the routh. 6. Ini &amp;t ot.org. Messrs Zjyn^h Bros, have established a servi.s of road Inspectors, eight In all, but their duties and respective spheres of ac tion have not as yet been clear ly defined. It is intended to appoint one inspector to everyevery two marches, to wat h trai*flo generally. 7. Lj&amp;d ctat.stiog . An effort has been made to obtain statistic® of the trade and animals passing up and down the Lyn h road, but with no very conspicuous succee® ao far. It has been attempted to obtain the statist!os from the bridgeiteeper at Godar i f alutan., but three causes mi Im itate against successful wor ding, 1/ tiie remuneration, 5 tomans per mensem, is not sufficiently incentive, 2# the man in question is constantly being changed, 3/ t)M he pui'posely understate • numbers to £over his own pec ulations, 6 . hieoellan-ous. Lastly the syfitem, at present largely in force, that of ’•dokash' and ,, aika^r:ll‘ , , as it is called, results in inordinate delays in delivery, and in some cases which I have in mind, has resulted in goods consigned to a British firm in Ispahan, being temporarily lost in one of the dumping stations and only found after a &lt;onsiderable amount of trouble and acrimonious cor- respondents. Such are the main defects and obstacles to the efficient working of the road; I will now pro ceed to outline how I propose to obviate them. I will premise my remarks by saying that I con sider tli© present moment a crucial one in the life of the Lyn h Eoad, as viewed from the standpoint of Brit ish interests. Unlesp a genuine effort is made, the road will go from bad to worse, and the already reduced of | trade carried by kes^rs lynch Bros will be lost all to gether. AlreadyAlready we have Persian rims competing sue cess ~ fully,and now the Germ ane have entered the list®,and will,I foresee,before very long have ^©n-uls or Vice • consuls in both Ahwas and Isfahan and will make a stren uous effort to capture the trade of the road. They are already competing,as I have already reported,in the transport business in the person of Haji 'ethullah athi of Ahsas. X had Intended to tal$ over the Question of road repairs with the Serdar-i-Jang in the High c ountry ,but unfortunately he has his hands more than full with the at Kuhgel^l campaign in the Low country — when he comes up I shall see hie.,but in the meanwhile I am writing to the Sordar-l-Fahadur on the subject. Annual repairs are necessary,but at best are but temporary palliatives — we want to get to the root of the evil. The ohlef disintegrating factor is the XI. In their annual migrations up and down the road,they go along it in hordes,with their flocks,herds and cattle, whioh straggle all over the hill side .above and below the road — those above send showers ox' stones and earth and on to the road,those below dislodge stones earth, the hlll~elde gives way and down comes the roadway. X have travelled with the II in pact years and have seen what havoc they can cause. The remedy X suggest is that all the Khans be approached to forbid the II,or if the Khans are willing forfor the Sardar-Wang to do ao.wlth perhaps the excep- tion of those having their habitat in Chighakhor r aad on whor^ the prohibition would impose unn^cespary hard— ship f from using the Ijynoh road, ^fhey would have to use the 8usan route # ooming out in the Upper Einarun Countr^^ Thiu would necessitate the Khans making some font! of ferry arrangements at Susan for crossing the Karun. In such years as the present this might be attended with some difficulty,but the crossing,when I last saw it, was not such as would be by any means impossible. This prohibition of the II and regular annual repairs, properly carried out, would remedy the first evil. Reference 2. The forts should be cade so in reality and placed in places of strategic advantage in the proximity of water and be cade habitable, so that in cases of neo- essity they would be of use and not as at present - useless for the purpose for whidh they have been built. They have been an expense to the rfaans who have evid ently been badly cheated by the building contractors. The aravanserals should be put in a proper state of repair so as to afford shelter and accomodation % caravans using the road. Referen e 3. The question of supplies is the keynote ax' the whole situSSion. Till the present inflated pr-ces can be brought down, the road will not be a success. When Mr Tod, of Lynch Bros, Csse to inspe their Ahwaa agency in lay last, I made a suggestion to him, and similarly to hr Wilson, whom I met at Lalamir, en route to relieve Ur Abel in the Ahwas agency. The suggestion was that hessrs lynch Bros, themselves shouldin the contract* - othenri.e the Khans would get no ° Re to tKiC ® the,a u * &gt; - 81n '« I have returned to Ahwas.x have talked about the lynch road In all its aspects, with aany merchants.both there and in Isfahan, and have tried to obtain their views and to find where the shoe pinches,with a view to remedying defects. £JLlli 0r I have been in close touch with the Amin-ut-TuJJar of lefahan.who is the local Agent / of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company,and have been trying to Concert with him plans whereby we could lessen frei ghts and particularly as regards oil,so as to be able to compete with the Russian oil. me point which I aic suggesting to the A.P.O is thet they should reduce the site of their drums by half, — this will allow of facilities in handling, allowing of other transport besides camels being used, &amp;Uow of th0 011 b * ln e into the surrounding dis tricts, both of Isfahan and the Chahar kahal.by the smaller traders on donkeys,and will secure a more ready market locally than the large drums. One Bieans of reducing freights would be to run a cart service from Isfehan to Dehkurd,primarily to bring in the oil landed at the latter place on trans port animals,and at other times such local freight as i-ay «e offering,and / or agricultural produce, 'he Amin-ut-TuJJar is very favourably disposed towards the ric.. ; and is willing to charge only a nominal freight for the oil. further I am collecting statistics with ft view to fteeing if the potentialities of the Oil/here suificient indUv.ezaont to the iiaproving of tiit Alwaniyeh-imlstnlr section of the road f to allow of oart^* bringingbringing up the oil to kela&amp;ir.

Ehis would make VAlasir and Deh-kurd at each end of the hill sec tion the termini of the pack transport,and would ne - oessitat© the establishment of depots in each place. Poth are admirably suited as regards space,fodder, water &amp;u.,the protection of ialamir being the only question in troublous years. I have asked Mr.Douglas of the railway Syn dicate to look at the road for me on the way up to Isfahan,my intention being to see if it would be worth while suggesting a feeder line from Ahwas,or wherever the railway line passes in its vicinity,to the foot of the Oardan-i-Sarrak near lalamir,besides getting his technical advice on the road as a whole. The great* er part of this line would be a •surface line* and &lt; oxxparatlvely cheap,and if the l lohammerah-fi%ful section of the railway is taken in hand first,it would both act as a feeder to this section,thereby coamen- cings its earnings at as early a date as possible,and at the same time fit in with a Scheme for reducing freights on the lynch road.

Reference 8. — The 'dokash'* system will be difficult to stop.for it enables muleteers to graze their cattle in the low and high countries in their respective grazing seasons. The only thing to be done is to restrict it as much as pcsrible on contracts and toto •nforo« the penalty clause, if the period la ex ceeded, with iiaich greater severity than heretofore. I saw a good example of how delays occur on ny way up this year. A number of Stovie tock loads on contract from lynch in IJasniri for Ispahan and took them to .^alauuir, where they dumped them. Thence they returned to their *gar»eir' , picked up these families and cattle and proceeded to take then by leisurely stages to their summer quarters in the high country. After which they proposed to return and take their loads to Ispahan. At the rat© they were travelling when I iaet them, they would exceed any reasonable time for delivery in Ispahan, but seer.ed to have no fear Of their penalty clause being enforced. The system is particularly noxious towards the end of the season, upward loads getting dumped on the Ahwas aide of the Burra kurda pass, and similarly downward loads autatis mutand is. In years of heavy snowfall, when the pass be comes Impassable, these goods get shut out till the pass opens again. The inspectors would be useful in such saaas to see that loads were dumped on the destination side of the pass, if this were done, not only would the system be rendered innocuous, but even might be made the means of keeping the transport business in lull blast even when the pasr* closed. F*or winter traffic a serai is badly needed at C-andumkar, with sufficient accorodatlon for both nan and beast, and sufficient supplies, sspscially of fuel. ; ■ ' \ There is yet another cause tending to militate against the general efficiency of the road.Ibe »*ralt at various stages in the upper section and hahar rahal are f lik© those in the hill property or various owners,vis. —— N xghun belonging to Ituntaasec-ueH^owleh ,8halaiQaar belonging to Saasam-us-Gultaneh t Shaiuflabad belong infe t '° Afiiir-i-i ujahid t and raf-i-Eukh to the . unasaett-ulH/ulk. in these serais the right to sell supplies at any priue they choose is claimed by the owners or their agents,and there is not the pre - tence even of a fixed rate and a fixed weight,as in the hill section. In both sections the 'dalundaro' the utroet they can,but to the rapacity of those in t.cc? upper section ther is no bounds,as they are^oivi - daily under the Ilkhani,the only check on their rapacity is that muleteers can often buy from villagers. Some arrangement should be come to by which the serais can also be put officially under the orders of the Ilkhani,to the extent of the prices to be charged and punishment in cases of disobedience. It will not do rway with extortion but will lessen the evil. vastly,in every question concerning the road, as in every other ^htiari^we are faced with the obsta cle represented by the inter-family enmity which is at the botton of nearly everything which takes place ip the Fakhtiari country.
