He recounts the several years he spent growing up in a military camp there before moving to England for secondary school and university. After teaching at universities in England and abroad in the 1970s and 1980s, Croxford joined the American University in Cairo in 1983 as a member of the English and Comparative Literature Department, of whose chair Doris Shoukry he provides a portrait. Croxford served as Director of AUC's Freshman Writing Program, which he covers in detail. He also addresses his participation in efforts to launch AUC's Core Curriculum, and the sometimes contentious issue of AUC's role as a liberal arts institution. Croxford, who published a novel set in Alexandria, also touches on his career after AUC including serving as an administrator at the British University in Egypt for over a decade after 2005.</dc:description><dc:subject>American University in Cairo--History.</dc:subject><dc:publisher>Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:publisher><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:source>AUC Oral Histories; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2017, American University in Cairo.
