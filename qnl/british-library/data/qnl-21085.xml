L. The Bahrain Government realise that,in the circumstances Ahich obtain today,it is impossible to retain the transit trace through Bahrain by aggressive action or by political devices,ana i tnat it can only be conserved by making the Port of Brnrain so attractive tnat the trade will flow to tne ort of its Gvm volition, rney appreciate,moreover,tnat it is necessary to endeavour to come to a mutually satisfactory agreement ,vxth me | U ' udi ^rnb Government if tne transit trade xs not to oe ruined to the detriment of all concerned in it. o.

The Bahrain Government are prepared to bring into force at once their proposal (aj in the previous paragraph, that is to say,to allow uirect transhipment witnin Fort limits of consignments of goods,either subject to a minimum of 1,000 bags or without the minimum,and I understand tnat tney ai'e communicating with you on the subject. 5. The Bahrain Government are,not unnaturally,opposea to considering a reduction in the duty on gooes in transit, unless ail other measures for conserving the transit trade fail. 6. it is hoped tnat it may be possible to effect an arrangement between the Banrain and the Sa f uai Arab Governments with a view to placing tne transit trade on a mutually satis factory basis ana the best means of uoing so is now under active discussion. The Bahrain Government ao not,therefore, wish to make public the concessions mentioned in sub-paragraphs (b) ana (c) of the third paragraph of this letter,as tney may prove of use in bargaining vith the Ga 1 uai Arab Government,ana i trust that,in the eircu^stances,you will agree tnat the view5 oi' the Bahrain Goverainent is sound. 7.

Understand Anplo-^ere ian Oil Oomnany have? arranged oil distribution centre with direct nhiument at Doha and have arrerd ahiy direct to Das ^anurah provided payMent made at Bank or to their agent at Bahrain before shipment is made. ISnds. He sident.On the evening of the 16th April 19 33 Mr. W.H. Dowling had called on me at Sabzabad and mentioned one or two points in connection with the distribution of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s products in the Persian Gulf, especially on the Arabian side. I told him that I would Lj see him about it on the afternoon of the 18th April. i- f 2. Mr. Dowling is, I understand, managing the dis- l tribution of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s products in the Persian Gulf area. I 3. On the 18th April Mr. Dowling told me that he had been to Gwadur, Shargah an&lt;^Doha. At Shargah they had had some difficulties but they have now arranged that the! Company shall build a suitable store-house to take 10,000 tins: that they will pay nothing to the Shaikh for the first year for rent or guards. After the first j year the warehouse will become the property of the Shaikh who will lease it to them for Rs*140/- per mensem plus Rs.60/- per mensem for guards. Mr. Dowling proposes to place these arrangements (which were given • in writing by the Shaikh/as an alternative to a proposal of their’s, according to Mr.Dowling) before his Company on his return to Abadan and if they approve to send an engineer of the Company to Shargah by Imperial Airways to supervise the construction of the warehouse. They hope to be able to take advantage of the personnel collected by Imperial Airways for the construction of the Rest House. I said that I thought that it would be a wise thing if they were to send with the engineer(who I understand will be a European and who will not know Arabic) a good interpreter. I said that I thought that it/id' it would be preferable that he should not send a Persian with which Mr. Dowling cordially agreed, and that if possible he should be a Gulf Arab and not one from Syria or ’Iraq, as Arabs from these places are not altogether persona arata in Arabia proper. 4 . Mr. Dowling told me that they had made arrange ments with the Shaikh of Q,atar for an oil store at Doha, and that the ’Khuzistan’ was going to call there. 5. Mr. Dowling also told me that they were negotia ting with Bin Saud about direct shipments of oil by the •Khuzistan’ to Ras Tanurah. They were anxious to get a footing in the oil market of Hejd and the Saudi Govern ment were anxious to develop the port of Ras Tanurah. The Oil Company had agreed to ship direct provided that payment would be made either to their Agent or to the Bank in Bahrain before each shipment was made. Mr* Dowling thought that this request for payment might prevent business being done, but he felt that unless they had money down they might find themselves unable to recover their debts. 6 . I asked Mr. Dowling if he was conversant with affairs on the Arab Coast, and he said that he was not, because he had been for the last six years in Northern Persia. I said that I thought I had better tell him about the position as regards transit trade in Bahrain not because I had any wish that he should alter his business arrangements, as I thought that trade must necessarily flow along its natural channel where profit was to be found, but because it would be as well for him to know what the position was. I explained briefly that/9./ -3- that in the past owing to difficulties of navigation and insecurity on the mainland Bahrain had become the distributing centre for Q,atar* ilejd and Hasas that now that there was comparative security on the mainland and the Saudi Government wish to make their own port, the situation was rather different than in the past, though Bahrain might well keep some of the transit trade owing to the facilities, such as bank, wireless, properly-lit harbour, which it possessed. I added that the question was much complicated by individual and national jealousies and pride, so that the transit question and the future of Ras Tanurah was not al together purely a commercial matter. 7. Mr* Dowling had never seen Ras Tanurah and I told him that I had been there and that it was an excellent harbour but that I said that there were difficulties about water and that although the anchorage was excellent it would need careful navigation to get there unless the place was properly buoyed. He said that Haji Williamson had said that there were quite a fair population there now. He is of course in a position to know so that I daresay that some water arrangements may have been made, possibly bringing it in tanks or boats from Qatif or elsewhere. 8 . I mentioned a rumour which I had heard in Bahrain of the Soviet having given Bin Saud 1200 cases of oil. I said that it was no more a rumour but that more than one or two persons had told me of it and all had agreed on the figure 1200. i said that probably their own people would know more about this.-4- 9. I mentioned to Mr, Dowling merely as a matter of interest that there seemed to be a certain feeling against the Anglo-Persi an Oil Company distribution because of the comparatively high prices charged. I emphasized that I was not in a position to criticize or to support this complaint, but that it was - so far as I knew - a general one, and that he might like to look into the matter. 10. I emphasized when talking about Doha and Shargah, i that the Political Agent, Bahrain, exercised a certain supervision over that part of the coast owing to communica' tions being easier for him than the Political Resident and that it would be as well if he would keep both the Political Resident and the Political Agent, Bahrain, informed of any steps which the Company might be taking about their distribution. I said that we naturally did not wish to interfere in any commercial transactions but that it was often possible, if we were informed beforehand, for us to give them advice which would help them and possibly at times to prevent difficulties such as had arisen at Gwadur and Shargah. He cordially agreed and promised to let me have las Political Resident and also as Political Agent, Bahrain) information of any steps which they propose to take. 11 . I asked him to stay with me on shore if he ever came to Bahrain in the ’Khuzistan’. 12. I think that Mr. Dowling is a pretty sick man and understand that he suffers from gall-stone. 13.

I strongly deprecate second alternative, both for the reasons you give and because it would make I bn Saud even readier than he will in any case be, to contend that the 1920 arrangement was in reality bilateral. I understand position to be that Bahrain Government notwithstanding recent grant of fiscal autonomy, are prepared to maintain transit duty of two per cent, and merely wish to ensure payment thereof on goods which have recently escaped or (mat. ) escape it. If this assumption is correct I suggest that best course would be to inform Saudi Government officially and without oral preliminaries which I previously contemplated that changes since 1920, both as regards the facilities afforded by port improvements at Bahrain and as regards methods of handling goods for the mainland, as well as financial necessities, make it necessary not to increase dues but to ensure their payment on all goods, including over-side goods handled at Bahrain; that His Majesty’s Government, who have granted fiscal autonomy to Bahrain, regard the 1920 arrangement as unilateral and terminable but that being anxious to reconcile the interests of all con cerned, they propose conference on the lines indicated in your telegram Ho.18.31 - 2 - I do not think that even the Saudi Government could seriously regard such a communication as an invitation to informed about the correspondence with Ibn Jiluwi.

My dear Loch, We are sending you by to-day's air mail copy of a note of the proceedings at a recent interdepartmental meeting about Bahrain transit dues and copy of correspondence with the Board of Trade and the Foreign Office on the same subject. It is proposed to discuss the question generally with Fowle when he arrives here next week, but there are some points on which we are by no means clear and on which we should be grateful if you could let us have a report. Perhaps if you see no objection you could telegraph a brief reply and let us have a following statement by air mailjin rather greater detail if you thought this necessary ? No doubt Fowle will be able to give much of the information required, but as you have been in such close touch with the matter at Bahrain we feel it would be very valuable to have your detailed comments. The points on which we would welcome further information are these: The Bin Jiluwi Agree m ent . We have no copy of the letter from the Shaikh of Bahrain to which Bin Jiluwi's letter^ which constitutes the Agreement in question, replies. Bin Jiluwi'a letter is itself exceedingly vaguely worded and we should greatly appreciate it if you could let hs have a statement of what, in your opinion, it may properly be regard ed as covering. (It would incidentally be of great assistance : if it were possible to have a copy of the Shaikh of Bahrain’s letter, but there may be difficulties about this). There are two points of detail on which, in particular, we are anxious for information: U) Does it cover steamers as well as sailing Ui)/ craft?- 2 - (ii) Does it cover transhipment overside outside as well as inside Bahrain territorial waters? (b) Is the Jiluwi Agreement still in force despite the difficulties which have arisen over the ’’Ahmedi” cargo and the official protest made in that connection by che Saudi Government? Are we correct in assuming that its operation was not and has not been confined to a single case and that it has, in fact, been a working agreement covering a variety of shipments over the period since it was entered into? (c) Has there been any further attempt to evade the Bahrain transit dues since the •'Ahmedi” incident and if so of what nature? If the answer is in the negative, have there been any important shipments for Hasa via Bahrain which have paid transit dues in the ordinary way, under the provisions either of the Bin Jiluwi Agreement or of the Agreement of 1920? fill you be so kind as to repeat your reply to the Minister at Jedda? I am sending copies of this letter to Metcalfe. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) J.G.Laithwaite.v . . - id (received under I n dia Office endorsement Uo. P.iu.2016/33). COPY SE1CT TO INDIA. &amp; Col . Fowle. IMPOBTANT , P.Z.2016/33. INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL,S.W.l. 7th April,1933. Dear Msrker, With reference to our discussion yesterday at the meeting on the Bahrain transit dues, I vrite to say that the point on which we are anxious for a definite ruling from the Board of Trade is the extent and the conditions subject to which the Bahrain Government, having regard to general international practice, could deal by retaliatory measures with the threat to the prosperity of their port constituted by the efforts which are beii-g made by interested parties to ivoid the payment of transit dues at Bahrain on goods consigned to Ibn Baud’s Hasa ports. The principal methods of evasion are by overside delivery outside Bahrainterritorial waters, by direct shipment in vessels not calling at Bahrain or using Bahraini harbour facilities, or by through shipment in vessels which, without disembarking any of their Hasa cargo or paying transit dues on it, do in fact use Bahrain harbour facilities going to or returning from the Hasa c oa s t, 2. The State at present charges a transit due of 2% on goods consigned to Hasa. No port chargese re levied at Bahrain and we understand that the transit due actually charged does not in practice cover the cost of providing harbour facilities, supervision, etc. at Bahrain. While the position is not quite clear, it appears, |rom the correspondence we have had, first, that cargoes for the Hasa coast are likely to be too small/ irker,Esq., Board of Trade.6./ - 2 - small by theinselvea to fill a single vessel - in other words, that the average ship will find it to its advantage to combine a shipment for Hasa with a shipment for Bahrain. Secondly, at any rate in the case of certain points on the Hasa coast, that vessels must lighten themselves at Bahrain if they are to make the Hasa coast. 3. The steps which the State has contemplated taking to deal with the threat to its prosperity referred to above are, first, the *repatriation’* of alien merchants living in Bahrain who indulge in the traffic to which exception is taken; secondly, the refusal to steamers engaging in the traffic of any facilities in Bahrain harbours and of permission to land cargo in Bahrai n. 4. The general sense of the meeting yesterday was against 'repatriation', and I need not make further reference to it in this letter. 5. Bahrain is not, of course, a party to any of the international shipping conventions, but in accordance with our general policy we are anxious that her practice, so nearly as possible after allowance for special local conditions, shall conform to the general line of those conventions. We should therefore be grateful if you could let us know whether either under general international practice or for any other reason a refusal of facilities such as the State has under consideration would be a legitimate step. If, in the view of the Board of Trade it would not, could they make any suggestion as to methods by which pressure could be brought to bear on offending shipping? As I explained yesterday, the question is one of much importance to Bahrain, particularly in view of her present economic difficulties. Indirectly it is also of considerable iraportance to His Majesty’s Government, for if Bahrain loses the transit trade or the bulk of it and the financial situation becomes very serious we may be faced with a demand for some c ontribution.-3- 6. For convenience I might isolate the different issues. (a) Ships proceeding direct, say, from India to the Hasa coast without passing through Bahrain territorial waters or using Bahrain harbour facilities . The State seems to recognize (compare paragraph 6 of the Financial Adviser’s letter of 31st October 1932} that it cannot prevent or control ships making the direct voyage. Would the State be justified in applying any retaliatory measures against such shipping in the event of its putting into the harbour of Bahrain either on the return journey from the Hasa coast or on some subsequent occasion unconnected with the Hasa traffic? (k) Ships en route to Hasa passing through Bahrain territorial waters, but not using Bahrain harbour facilities . Would any retaliatory action, and if so what, be possible and legitimate in these cases? (It could, of course, be taken only on the occasion of a subsequent visit or such a ship to Bahrain). ( c ) Ships engaging jn overside delivery of goods intended for Hasa outside Bahra-xn territorial waters . Would the State be justified in isfusing harbour, etc. facilities to such ships as a deterrent measure? Ships (as, in the case of the 'AHMADI')touching at ...en route for Hasa lightening themselves by discharging cargo consigned t o Bahrain^ but, since no transhipment took .P.ftying no tr ansit charge on the Hasa cargo in their hold . Would the State(subject to the provisions of any special agreement that might be in force with Bin Saud) be entitled to charge transit dues on the Hasa cargo(particularly as no port dues are levied) despite the fact that it had not been transhipped? If not, could they be entitled to retaliate against/-4- against such shipping on the lines suggested in paragraph 3 above? 7- It is unnecessary to consider the case of transhipment within Bahrain territorial waters from sailing ships into dhows, since this can be dealt with by the strict application of the terms of 1920 with Bin Saud, which provides for free transhipment in such circumstances only when transhipment is from steamers. 8. I am sending a copy of this letter to Warner. I understand that you have been so kind as to arrange with the P. 8c 0. that they should see us next Tuesday to discuss the question generally, and the opportunity could be taken to consider both the desirabil ity of imposing port dues at Bahrain as one method of dealing with the situation, and Johnstone’s suggestion about tonnage discrimination. Yours sincerely, (Sd.) J. G, Laithwaite.P.Z.2016/33. INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL,S.W.1 12th April,1933. My dear Warner, Marker and I went yesterday by appointment to see the P. &amp; 0. in connection with the Bahrain transit dues, our object being principally to ascertain, first, what their reaction would be to a proposal to impose port dues, and, secondly, to sound them on Johnstone’s suggestion as to discrimination on the basis of tonnage* 2, They were emphatic that they would see strong objection to any proposal to impose port dues. Their service was already by no means profitable and |ort dues would hit it still more heavily. Moreover, acceptance of a liability for port dues by them at Bahrain would inevitably result in demands from other ports of the Persian Gulf and would constitute a most embarrass ing precedent. I must admit that after detailed discussion with them both Marker and I reached the conclusion that we could not hope for ary advance in this direction, and a a further argument against imposition is that contained in Biscoe’s despatch .N0.436-S dated 29th June 1932,(copy sent to Foreign Office under our printed letter P.Z.4032/32 of 8th July last), that the imposition of port dues would inevitably result in an increase in the cost of living in Bahrain, many of the inhabit ants of which are already not far removed from the starvation level. 3. The results of our discussion were, I fear, equally negative as regards tonnage discrimination, for it seemed, on going into the figures, that it would be most difficult to devise any system which would not seriously affect the British India Company, and which would be likely to work satisfactorily in practice. 4. / .F.A.Warner, Esq., FOREIGN OFFICE.4.

I cannot do better than re-state the general principle which I mentioned at the inter-Depart mental Meeting on Thursday. Thie should, we think, guide you in regard to Bahrain. (1) The authorities at Bahrain ought not to attempt to interfere in any way with vessels which do not make any use whatever of the Bahrain territory or territorial waters for the purpose of their trade with Hasa. (2) The mere fact that vessels pass in transit (without stopping) through Bahrain territorial waters in the course of their voyage to the mainland of Rasa should not be regarded as in any way invalidating the principle stated in (1). (3) If and in so far as vessels ar© bound to make use of the port or territorial waters of Bahrain for the purposes of their trade with Rasa, the levy of trsneit duties on all gbods in these vessels which ar© destined for Hasa might perhaps be defended,even though they are not actually transhipped in Bahrain or in Bahrein territorial waters. The answers to the questions in paragraph 6 would therefore seem to be (a), (b) and (c) Ko; (d) possibly defensible. Foley concurs in the terms of this letter.

Minutes of a Meeting he 6 th April 1933 to discu Trans Id at the India Office on ss the question of Bahrain it Dues*(Received under IlGiA OFFICE endorsement No.P.^.2129/3S.), Minutes of a meeting held at the India Office on 6th /.prii 1333 to discuss the question of Bahrain Transit Dues. Present; Mr. Laithwaite India Office (In Mr. C.F.A.Warner ) Mr. K.R.Johnstone ) Foreign Office, Mr. F.H.Marker Board of Trade. Mr. C r omb i e India Office. Mr. Laithwaite briefly summarised the history of this question, a detailed analysis of which was contained in Mr. Johnstone’s note which had been circulated by the Foreign Office. Nejd and Bahrain were to? ome extent mutually dependent, since Nejd needed the facilities of the port of Bahrain while Bahrain needed the revenues which it derived from the entrepot trade. It was relevant that vessels above a certain tonnage could not apparently approach certain parts of the Rasa coast v/ithout first lightening themselves •*'' elsewhere, and that steamers of any size were unlikely to find it worth their while to carry traffic for Hasa only. As the result of pressure by H.M.G. Bahrain had in 1920 agreed to reduce the transit duty on goods consigned to Ibn maud’s dominions and landed at Bahrain in transit to the main land to 2 per cent &gt; and., to allowcfree transhipment of goods so consigned direct from steamers into lighters in Bahrain waters Serious/Serious difficulties had now arisen in connection with the . second of these two concessions as the result of efforts to evade the payment of transit duty. In the first place an attempt had been made to extend the right of free transhipment within Bahrain territorial waters to goods transhipped from sailing craft. An agreement reached with Ibn Jiluwi, Ibn Baud’s Governor of Hasa, appeared to have disposed of this, although a point to some extent left obscure in the agreement (though the answer appeared to be in the affirmative) was whether or not it covered steamers as well as sailing cajrft. Secondly, there appeared to be some danger of transhipment outside Bahrain territorial waters. Thirdly, cases had arisen (principally that known as the ”Ahraedi , ‘case) of direct shipment of goods to the mainland in vessels which, while touching at Bahrain, had neither landed cor transhipped their r®inland cargo, ana so claimed to evade the Bahrain transit dues. The 'Ahmedi' incident had led to formal protests from the Saudi Government and to a request for consideration of the whole position. There seemed fairly generaly agreement now among the interested authorities that the quest! cm could best be dealt with in the first instance by an informal conference at Bahrain between representatives of the Saudi and Bahrain Governments, with the assistance of the Political Agent, Bahrain, the results of such conference to receive ultimate confirmation through the diplomatic channel at Jedda. If this view was accepted the points for immediate consideration vrere the strength of the Bahrain case and the arguments which coulkjbe suggested for use by the Bahrain representatives in any such conference. The matter was one of some urgency, since the India Office had just received reports that the Saudi Govern ment had purchased a small steamer of its own at Glasgow, presumably/-3- presumably for use in the Hasa trade. Prxma facie there seemed much to be said for aiming as the outcome of discussion at a, convention on the general lines of the Bin Jiluwi agreement. Mr. V/arner remarked that the wording of the so-called Ibn Jiluwi agreement was very vague. Apart from the question ef its applicability to steamers it was not, for instance, clear whether it covered transhipment outside Bahrain territorial waters. Subject , however, to the elucidation of these points, the Foreign Office were disposed to regard a convention on the general lines of the Ibn Jiluwi agreement as in principle probably the best solution and were in general agreement with the proposal that the matter shouldbe dealt with by an informal conference of the nature suggested. Mr. Laithwaite said that on the assumption that there was general agreement on these points the next question for consideration was what arguments of substance could be advanced by the Bahraini representatives and to what extent they could, for instance, in the event of the ^audi representatives proving intractable, take action on the lines of the proposal made by them at an earlier date that the facilities of the port of Bahrain should be refused to shipping which engaged in tranship ment or direct carriage of goods to the mainland without payment of transit dues. He asked Mr. Marker what the position would be in regard to such action from the point of view of inter national practice, bearing in mind that while Bahrain, like the other Arab States of the Persian Gulf, was not a party to any international shipping conventions, our general policy was to secure that jn practice she conformed as closely as might be, after allowance for local conditions, to the line of such conventions. mi- # Marker .xiought tnat it would not fee possible f ox* the Bahrain/'1 -4- Bahrain Government to impose any restrictions on direct transhipment outside Bahrain territorial waters, or any sanctions on ships in respect of the direct carriage of goods to the mainland. Mr.Laithwaite quoted the statement of the Financial Adviser, Bahrain, that no action would be taken if a ship went direct from India, for example, to Nejd, but that the State might impose penalties if such a vessel called at Bahrain on its way to or from the mainland. Mr. Marker said that in the case of a ship, such as the rt Ahmedi , % proceeding to Hasa via Bahrain and carrying goods for Bkhrain as well as Hasa, the prohibition of the landing at Bahrain of the Bahrain cargo was, in his view, rather high handed. He was, however, inclined to agree that in cases where ships would be unable to proceed direct to the mainland without lightening themselves at Bahrain or where for any other reason they used Bahrain facilities en route to the mainland, the Bahrain authorities might properly levy a small duty in order to cover expenses of upkeep of the port, etc. on that portion of the cargo which was consigned to Hasa, on the ground that it was transitting Bahrain territorial waters and enjoying the benefit of the facilities provided by the Bahrain Government. He doubted if retaliatory action couldjbe justified where a ship proceeded direct to the mainland before calling at Bahrain. Mr.ferner referred to the political objections to any overt discrimination against ships carrying goods for Bejd and suggested that the possibility of charging port dues on all shipping might be further explored. Would it be possible to deal with the matter by requiring that all goods carried in vessels passing through Bahrain might be made to pay a small duty? Considerable/-5- 73 •«) Considerable further discussion took place as to possible methods of countering the endeavours which were being made to evade the Bahrain transit duties* To the imposition of a duty on all goods passing through Bahrain there was the objection of the possible effect on cargoes for other ports in the Gulf and especially for Basra carried by the mail steamers touching at Bahrain. To a proposal that the mainland duty might be charged on the whole cargo of a ship calling at Bahrain for the specific purpose of or in furtherance of its trade with the Basa mainland, there was the objection that this constituted a definite discrimination against Bin Baud. A suggestion by Mr. Johnstone that it might be possible to discriminate in accordance with tonnage, was reserved for further considera tion. It was finally agreed that the India Office should write to the Board of Trade setting out in detail the difficulties which had arisen and asking for a ruling by the Board as to the extent to which Bahrain, having regard to general international practice, was free to take retaliatory action against ships which indulged in direct shipment to the Hasa coast to the injury of the port of Bahrain and the nature and limits of such action, Mr.Laith waite then referred to the suggestion put forward at an earlier stage by the Political Agent, Bahrain, that the State might 'repatriate' alien merchants residing in Bahrain who indulged in direct transhipment. Action on these lines had been taken (without equally substantial justification) against Hindu traders in Nejd by Ibn Saud, but the objections to it were patent. The general sense of the meeting was that action on these lines was undesirable both on broad grounds and because of the danger of retalitation. j/V Mr. yarn er/Mr,Warner pointed out that, the arguments of a general nature in favour of any early and amicable settlement apart, it was definitely in the interests of Bahrain to lose no time in reaching a settlement and if need be to make some slight further concession to Ibn Saud* The discovery of oil in Hasa might, if the field proved worth working, lead to the development of the port of Has Tanura and it might well be that it would pay Bahrain better to take the risk of direct shipment if she could obtain a satisfactory convention on the lines of the Bin Jiluwi agreement, rather than by standing out to risk the loss of the bulk of her transit trade. Mr,Warner further raised the question whether it was desirable in approaching the Saudi Government regarding the proposed conference at Bahrain, to intimate that Bahrain had definitely decided that it could no longer continue the concession of free transhipment granted by it in 1920 or whether it might be better that no threat should be made nefore the conference was held. The objections to giving the Saudi Government any excuse for complaining that it was being asked to negotiate under a threat were pointed out, and it was finally agreed that the Foreign Office should cooisult Sir Andrew Ryan on the point. The conclusions of the meeting were as follows:- (a) that the best prospect of advance was by an informal conference at Bahrain, with the assistance of the Political Agent, of the nature referred to above* lb) that it was desirable that this conference should take place at the earliest possible date, not only on general grounds, but because of the recent purchase by the Saudi of a steamer probably for use in the Hasa traffic, and the danger that oil development in Hasa might lead to a develop ment of the port of Has Tanura. Further, it was admittedly desirable/-7- 'A desirable from all points of view that a friendly agreement should be reached without delay between these two States, whose interests were to so large an extent interdependent• (c) that in the light of the considered opinion of the Board of Trade on the extent to which and the manner in which it would be possible for the Bahrain Government to retaliate against individuals indulging in direct transhipment, and of Sir Andrew Ryan’s view on the question of the line to be taken with the Saudi Government, the whole question should be further discussed with ColonOl Fowle on his arrival with a view to reaching a decision as to the line to be followed by the Bahrain representatives at the conference.

Mr. G.E. Cromhie India Office. Mr. Laithwait e referred to the conclusions of the meeting of 6th April and to the developments which had taken place since that date. In the first place the Board of Trade had advised that in the cs.se of ships such as the 'Ahmedi' touching at Bahrein en route for Hasa and lightening themselves hy discharging cargo consigned to Bahrein hut, since no transhipment took place, paying no transit charge on the Hasa cargo in their hold, the imposition of a duty on the Hasa cargo might he defensible, though they did not much favour action of this nature and would prefer in any event that some phrase other than 'transit” dues should he used. No retaliatory action would in their view he justified against ships which, en route to Hasa, either did not * pass through Bahrein territorial waters, or, while passing through those waters, did not use Bahrein harbour facilities, or which engaged in overside delivery of goods intended for Hasa outside Bahrein territorial waters. Secondly, discussion with the P.&amp; 0. had shown that the Company would see strong objection to the institution of port dues at Bahrein and that a tonnage discrimination against vessels hound for Hasa would not he feasible. Finally/Finally, Sir Andrew Ryan had now expressed his views, which were shared hy the Political Resident, on the general ^ question of tactics. He recommended that the Saudi Government should he informed at the outset of our correspondence with them that the 1920 arrangement was regarded as unilateral and terminable. He advised further that it might ease matters if the task of the conference were expressed to he the production of a working agreement for a period of, say, 3 to 5 years in the lirst place; and that it might he preferable to say nothing in our official communication to the Saudi Government about the Bin Jiluwi and marzuk Agreements. The meeting agreed generally not to pursue further the question of port dues or of tonnage discrimination, and, subject to the modification that it would be preferable to say nothing or very little about the grant of fiscal autonomy to Bahrein, to approve the general line oi tactics suggested by the Minister. Colonel Fowle mentioned in this connection that the precise degree of authority of the Bin Jiluwi Agreement was by no means clear. It was quite possible that it was merely a local arrangement entered into without reference to Ibn Saud. km. Laithwaite said that the next question was that of the tactics to be adopted by Bahreini representatives at the proposed conference. It looked at though the only weapon with which we could furnish them was a threat to impose dues on the Hasa cargo of vessels such as the 'Ahrnedi' which called at Bahrein en route to Hasa ports. It would be necessary to use this weapon with care both on international and other grounds. Mr. Warner said the Foreign Office were averse from using this threat. 1/Yhile recognising that consideration3 must te given to the interests of Bahrein it was important to avoid any action which, hy prejudicing our general relations with Ihn Baud, might prejudicially azfect matters of major importance such as the Transjordan negotiations. The test course seemed to he to work at the proposed conference for a friendly agreement on the lines of the Bin Jiluwi arrangements, possibly accompanied hy a 'gentleman's understanding' that 'Ahmedi' cases would not recur; hut that if they aid it would he necessary for the Bahrein Government to consider retaliatory action. Colonel Fowle and Mr&gt; La1thwaite , while recognising the force of the Foreign Office objections, felt strongly at the same time that the chances of a satisfactory agreement woulu he much improved if it was possible to furnish Hie Bahreini representatives with some weapon for use if the Saudis proved intransigent. Cases of the 'Ahmedi 11 type were a serious problem, and likely to become still more so in the event of the Saudis acquiring steamers of their own, though admittedly vessels of a certain draught might evade any question of dues by calling at Has Tanura and discharging H&amp;sa cargo there before discharging cargo at Bahrein. Moreover, while there were obvious objections to a marked discrimination, the Hasa-Bahrein situation presented special features which had resulted in the Agreement of 1920 and which might be regarded as justifying some degree of special provision. After considerable further discussion, Mr. Marker suggesting, in particular, that a duty might be imposed on Hasa cargoes, possibly unaer the name of a 'customs control charge' if justifiable on the ground of preventing smuggling, it appeared that all the suggestions made for circumventing evasion of Bahrein transit dues were open to the/4 t/li6 objection either of constituting &amp; speciiic discrimination against Saudi goods or of imposing an undesirable tax on British shipping. Colonel Fowls said that if it proved impossible to find satisfactory arguments with which we could arm the Bahreini representatives in the forthcoming conference the only alternative was to allow them to deal with the Question on quits general lines? and endeavour to make at the conference a friendly agreement of the most satisfactory type possible. He was not himself without hopes that when the two parties got together results would be achieved which in practice would be satisfactory, even if they did not conform in all respects to western standards. The main thing was to reach some agreement, hov/ever provisional, 'which could be reconsidered later if difficulties arose. After further discussion hr. Warner suggested that the Bahreini re presents, fives might take the line at the Conference that they had made a very substantial concession in 1920 in lowering the transit due on goods for the Hasa from 5% to 2%; that in existing economic conditions it was essential for them to seek an increase in their revenue; and that after careful consideration the conclusion had been reached that in the circumstances it would be necessary to raise their general transit due on goods for Hasa from 2% (which was understood to represent a preferential rate in existing conditions) to 3% or above; but that, the interests of the two States being closely allied, they would be prepared to explore other possibilities of increasing the revenue derived from the preferentially treated goods destined for the Hasa, e.g. an/ *0 %c an agreement on the general lines of the Bin Jiluwi Agreement, supplemented hy a 'gentleman*s agreement' in respect of direct consignments such as that carried by the 'Ahmedi'. Some play might possibly also be made over the retention of the concession which had been made to Bin Saud in respect of the passing of baled goods unopened on payment of a charge of Rs.20 per bale. The meeting generally agreed that action on these lines seemed in all the circumstances the most hopeful course. As regards procedure it was agreed that as a first stage the Foreign Office, in reply to sir Andrew Ryan's telegram No.69 of 17 tii April, should outline the general line of tactics which it was proposed to adopt and should authorise him to make the necessary approach to the Saudi Government. Copies of this telegram would be sent to the Government of India and to Bushire. Formal instructions to the Political Resident would have to wait until Sir Andrew Ryan's comments had been received and the reaction of the Saudi Government to his communication to them ascertained.

Marker Mr.Grombie India Office (In the Chair) Foreign Office. Board of Trade. India Office. Mr.Laithwaite briefly summarised the history of this question, a detailed analysis of which was contained in Mr.Johnstone’s note which had been circulated by the Foreign Office. Nejd and Bahrain were to some extent mutually dependent, since Nejd needed the facilities of the port of Bahrain while Bahrain needed the revenues which it derived from the entrepot trade. It was relevant that vessels above a certain tonnage could not apparently approach certain parts of the Hasa coast without first lightening them selves at Bahrain or elsewhere, and that steamers of any size were ’unlikely to find it worth their while to carry traffic for Hasa only. As the result of pressure by H.M.Cr.Bahrain had in 1920 agreed to reduce the transit duty on goods consigned to Ibn Baud's dominions and landed at Bahrain in transit to the mainland to 2 per cent.and to allow free transhipment of goods so consigned direct from steamers into lighters in Bahrain waters. Serious difficulties had now arisen in connection with the second of these two concessions as the result of efforts to-evade the payment of transit duty. In the first place/place an attempt had been made to extend the right of free transhipment within Bahrain territorial waters to goods transhipped from sailing craft. An agreement reached with Ibn Jiluwi, Ibn Baud’s Governor of Hasa, appeared to have disposed of this, although a point to some extent left obscure in the agreement (though the answer appeared to be in the affirmative) was whether or not it covered steamers as well as sailing craft. Secondly, there appeared to be some danger of tranship ment outside Bahrain territorial waters. Thirdly, cases had arisen (principally that known as the 'Ahmedi” case) of direct shipment of goods to the mainland in vessels which, while touching at Bahrain, had neither landed nor transhipped their mainland cargo, and so claimed to evade the Bahrain transit dues. The 'Ahmedi' incident had led to formal protests from the Saudi Government and to a request for consideration of the whole position. There seemed fairly general agreement now among the interested authorities that the question could best be dealt with in the first instance by an informal conference at Bahrain between representatives of the Saudi and Bahrain Governments, with the assistance of the Political Agent, Bahrain, the results of such conference to receive ultimate confirmation through the diplomatic channel at Jedda. If this view was accepted the points for inmediate consideration were the strength of the Bahrain case and the arguments which could be suggested for use by the Bahrain representatives in any such conference. The matter was one of seme urgency, since the India Office had just received reports that the Saudi Government had purchased a spdl steamer of its own at Glasgow, presumably for use in the Hasa trade. Rrima facie there seemed much to be said for aiming/aiming as the outcome of discussion at a convention cn the general lines of the Bin Jiluwi agreement. Mr.lvarner remarked that the wording of the so-called Ibn Jiluwi agreement was very vague. Apart from the question of its applicability to steamers it was not, for instance, clear whether it covered transhipment outside Bahrain territorial waters. Subject, however, to the elucidation of these points, the Foreign Office were disposed to regard a convention on the general lines of the Ibn Jiluwi agreement as in principle probably the best solution and were in general agreement with the proposal that the matter should be dealt with-by an informal conference of the nature suggested. Mr.Laithwaite said that on the assumption that there was general agreement on these points the next question for consideration was what arguments of substance could be advanced by the Bahraini representatives and to what extent they could, for instance, in the event of the Saudi representatives proving intractable, take action on the lines of the proposal made by them at an earlier date that the facilities of the port of Bahrain should be refused to shipping which engaged in transhipment or direct carriage of goods to the mainland without payment of transit dues. He asked Mr.Marker what the position would be in regard to such action from the point of view of international practice, bearing in mind that while Bahrain, like the other Arab States of the Persian Gulf, was not a party to any international shipping conventions, our general policy was to secure that in practice she conformed as closely as might be, after allowance for local conditions, to the line of such conventions. Mr/Mr .Marker thought that it would not be possible for the Bahrain Government to impose any restrictions on direct transhipment outside Bahrain territorial waters, or any sanctions on ships in respect of the direct carriage of goods to the mainland. Mr .Laithwaite quoted the statement of the Financial Adviser.Bahrain, that no action could be taken if a ship went direct from India, for example, to Nejd, but that the State might impose penalties if such a vessel called at Bahrain on its way to or from the mainland. Mr .Marker said that in the case of a ship, such as the M Ahmedi', proceeding to Has a via Bahrain and carrying cargo for Bahrain as well as Hasa, the prohibition of the landing at Bahrain of the Bahrain cargo was, in his view, rather high-handed. He was, however, inclined to agree that in cases where ships would be unable to proceed direct to the mainland without lightenirg themselves at Bahrain or where for any other reason they used Bahrain facilities en route to the mainland, the Bahrain authorities might properly levy a small duty in order to cover expenses of upkeep of the port, etc. on that portion of the cargo which was consigned to Hasa, on the ground that it was transitting Bahrain territorial waters and enjoying the benefit of the facilities provided by the Bahrain Government. He doubted if retaliatory action could be justified where a ship proceeded direct to the mainland before calling at Bahrain. Mr..Warnex referred to the political objections to any overt discrimination against ships carrying goods for Nejd and suggested that the possibility of charging port dues on all shipping might be further explored./explored. Would it be possible to deal with the matter by requiring that all goods carried in vessels passing through Bahrain might be made to pay a small duty? Considerable further discussion took place as to possible methods of countering the endeavours which were beirg made to evade the Bahrain transit duties. To the imposition of a duty on all goods passing through Bahrain there was the objection of the possible effect on cargoes for other ports in the Gulf and especially for Basra carried by the mail steamers touching at Bahrain. To a proposal that the mainland duty might be charged on the whole cargo of a ship calling at Bahrain for the specific purpose of or in furtherance of its trade with the Hasa mainland, there was the objection that this constituted a definite discrimination against Bin Sand. A suggestion by Mr .Johnstone that it might be possible to discriminate in accordance with tonnage, was reserved for further consideration. It was finally agreed that the India Office should write to the Board of Trade settirg out in detail the difficulties which had arisen and asking for a rulirg by the Board as to the extent to which Bahrain, havirg regard to general international practice, was free to take retaliatory action against ships which indulged in direct shipment to the Hasa coast to the injury of the port of Bahrain and the nature and limits of such action. lOGhaithwaite then referred to the suggestion put forward at an earlier stag© by the Political Agent, Bahrain, that the State might 'repatriate' alien merchants residing in Bahrain who indulged in direct transhipment* Action on these lines had been taken (without equally substantial justification) against Hindu traders in Nejd by Ibn Saud, but the objections to/ / 6 . it were patent. The general sense of the meetir^ was that action on these lines was undesirable both on broad grounds and because of the danger of retaliation. Mr .Warner pointed out that, the arguments of a general nature in favour of an early and amicable settlement apart, it was definitely in the interests Oi Bahrain to lose no time in reaching a settlement and if need be to make some slight further concession to Ibn Saud. ihe discovery of oil in Hasa might,if the field proved worth working, lead.to the development of the port of Ras Tanura and it might well be that it would pay Bahrain better to take the risk of direct shipment if she could obtain a satisfactory convention en the lines of the Bin Jiluwi agreement, rather than by standing out to risk the loss of the bulk of her transit trade. iv.r.banner further raised the question whether it was desirable in approachir^ the Saudi Government regarding the proposed conference at Bahrain, to intimate that Bahrain had definitely decided that it could no longer continue the concession of free transhipment granted by it in 1920 or whether it might be better that no threat should be made before the conference was held. The objections to giving the Saudi Government any excuse for complaining that it was being asked to negotiate under a threat were pointed out, and it was finally agreed that the Foreign Office should consult Sir Andrew Ryan on the point. ££&gt;Tlclusions of the meeting were as follows:- (a) that the best prospect of advance was by an informal conference at Bahrain, with the assistance of the Political Agent, of the nature referred to above. /(b) that it was desirable that this conference should take place at the earliest possible date, not only on general grounds, but because of the recent purchase by the Saudie of a steamer probably for use in the Rasa traffic, and the danger that oil development in Rasa might lead to a development of the port of Ras Tanura. Further, it was admittedly desirable from all points of view that a friendly agreement should be reached without delay between these two States, whose interests were to so large an extent interdependent.

Political Resident, BUSH1RE. Political, Bahrain. tr.O I enclose copies of telegrams 117 and 118, both dated the 23f’d May, from Minister,Jedda. 2. Two main points arise from these telegrams. The first is the tactics to be pursued vis a vis the Saudi Government, and subject to your remarks I think the best line to take would be that indicated by Minister in the last paragraph of his telegram 118: Subject to other views I think best course might be to express regret at refusal of conference proposal: to say that it leaves Bahrain Government no alternative but to notify termina tion of 1920 arrangement: and then to watch developments for two or three months before taking any definite final decision.” ^* The second point is whether the Saudi Government, as indicated by Minister,(tide first part of the last paragraph of his telegram 118), are trying to bluff us with a threat of cutting out Bahrain altogether, or whether they, i.e. the Saudi Government, can really make Has Tanura into a proper port. {Signature) tfith/ &gt;CFP—33S&amp;P—(G-37)—25-5-31—15,000. ( Designation)- 2 - With regard to this last question various factors have to be considered port to be made: at the tip of the Ras or further in, (b) Channels, tides, prevailing winds, etc. ic) Facilities on shore: whether, for instance, drinking water is available or can be found by the sinking of artesian wells; communications with the Interior, etc. In the latter case I presume Q,atif will be used as an entrepot for the port ? (d) How much work are the Saudi Government actually putting in at Ras Ta.nura with a view to making it a port. or not we are working in the dark. Once we get reliable information on this point our way will be much clearer. Could you please get the information on the above points and any other that occur to you as being useful, as soon as possible, and let me have a report as soon as possible. 5.

Reply goes on to say following on incident which provoked Saudi note of November 15th last Nejdi merchants pressed for creation of a port on S(audi) coast and that arrangements were made for ships and goods to go direct to Has Tanura. Saudi Government do not wish to stand in the way of any arrangements which Bahrain may consider it to its advantage to make for transit trade provided goods in transit for S(audi) Arabia are not treated less favourably than those destined for other countries.

Fuad foreshadowed this reply in conversation on 19th May. 11 e referred in obscure language to our con tention that 1920 arrangement was unilateral and terminable, to which I replied that throughout prolonged discussions leading up to our proposal we had had no doubt on that fcoint. Saudi note ignores it and also ignores proposal for conference. Fuad made out that much progress had been made with port at Has Tanura. I said that it was because further developments might affect the outlook of Saudi Government no less than that of Bahrain that we had suggested possibility of agreement for fixed period. Abdur Rahman Q.usaibi happened to call on me yesterday. Conversation turned on this subject. He suggested that Bahrain ought to extend more liberal treat ment to goods imported in Ibn Saud's name even if intended for Government ae opposed to purely personal use. He rather laughed at the idea that Ras Tanura could be regarded seriously as a port at present but ended by asking me whether I thought the British India Company would be willing to call there, say, once a month, I naturally evaded this but urged advantages of our proposal for a conference of experts to concert mutually advantageous agreement, answer to whichI had not yet received. C^usaibi wag non-committal but spoke of trying to arrange something on his return to Bahrain. I find situation baffling. I cannot judge how far S^audi) Government, realising difficulty of contesting unilateral character of 1920 arrangement, are trying to bluff us with threat of cutting out Bahrain altogether. Subject to other viev/s I think best course might be to express regret 7 ** at refusal of conference proposal: to say that it leaves Bahrain Government no alternative but to notify termination of 1920 arrangement: and then to watch developments for two or three months before taking any definite final decision. I do not know by what right I bn Saud claims most-favoured-nation treatment but I gather from your 58 that ^atar alone has hitherto shared benefit of two per cent, transit duty. / AJjl SrW.'-'VA RYAh -CONFIDENTIAL. ^°*S&gt;61-S of 1933« plitnents to The Senior Officer, Persian Gulf, H.M.S.'Bideford', and has the honour to transmit to him a copy of the undermentioned docu mentor. remark that the two telegrams mentioned there in contain a threat from the Saudi Government of making a port at Has Tanura and the point at issue is to clear up if possible whether ltdttidi fcas iflr ifoKia fide intention or merely a blaff. and Consulate-General, BUSH I RE.

Your Excellency, With reference to your letter wo, 6511306/43/15) of the 13th May 1933, regarding the transit dealings between the Sa’udi Arab mainland and Bahrain, I have the honour to state that His Majesty the King a long time ago discussed the question with Sir Hercy Cox and the late Sir Gilbert Clayton and intimated that, whatever the facilities afforded in foreign ports in respect of goods relating to the territories of His Majesty might be, it was inevitable that internal arrangements should be made with a view to improving one or more ports on the coasts of His Majesty's territories. Since the incident led to the despatch of the note of this ministry to Mr. Hope Gill in Rajab last (November last) Nejdi merchants have become more restless and have pressed for the opening of a Sa'udi Arab port on the coast of His Majesty' territories. Accordingly arrangements were then made for ships and goods to go direct to Has lanura. -^he Government of His M a j es ty do not desire to limit the freedom of Bahrain in respect of whatever arrangements it may think advantageous for it to make regarding transit trade, on one condition, namely no prejudice should be imposed on the transit trade to the Sa'udi Arab mainland and it should not be accorded less (favourable) treatment than transit (trade) to other countries With highest respects, 3d.

The possibility of artesian wells must not be lost siftit of. (c) Work aahore is reported to be proceeding energetically. A shed approximately 130 feet by 40 feet has been built. A olei r approximately 100 feet, long has been constructed. At low water # the end 4s on dry ground but depth of sea 300 yards away is said to be 6 fathoms. The Shaikh of Kuwait, stio called at Was Tanura about 19th .Tune in his on all yacht en route for Bahrain, confirmed that there was great activity at Was 'anura but said that nothing was done tfhile he was there. 1) In 1908 cargo transhipped into dhows at Was Tanura/Tanura waa landed at A1 Katif “but their would now aiipear to he no ineuperahle difficulty to its being landed at ^an m anura i^eelf and distributed inland either from there or from Qo*if as a base. 3 * Prtea faele therefore the Ba*udi OoTernment’e threat to out out Bahrain and derelop Bas n ‘awura is serious and not a mere bluff.

Our principals desire us to point out that in view of :heir complying with the wishes of the Bahrein Government and the Political Department to discourage shipments direct to the mainland, -hey are losing considerable traffic in not competing with such teasels as the above. They also desire us to emphasise the loss this level opment entails on the revenues of the Bahrein State and the urgent need for reconsideration of the State*s attitude towards this Luestion. It is apparent that trade demands direct shipments to the &gt;©rts on the Mainland and our Company will sooner or later be obliged |o cater for this traffic to avoid competition from outside tonnage. ti|7^I. II-I ■g^ - 2 - \ Under these circumsta.nces it does not appear equitable that other Steamship Companies he allowed to cater for the traffic when it is expressly desired that the British India Company should not undertake it. We shall he glad to hear from you in this matter. Also whether any further devJbpments have taken place in regard to the Conference contemplated between the Hedjaz and Bahrein Governments^ on the subject of Transit Traffic. ^ We would mention that Messrs.Ebrahim Yusef Zainal Ali Reza have their own offices at this port. Further, that it is hardly likely that the steamer ,, Haideri w will be able to pay for her voyage out of the fx'eights received for the mainland shipments and that she is bound to bring(f^^v'^yrd! cargo for Bahrein also. Tne small shipments coming forward by the B.I. 'Vessels at this season would also support this view. Yours faithfully,\%\ Ko;C/286-l-a/13.

I have the honour to acknowledge your c/286-la/l3 dated 19th July 1933. 1 ‘ The Bahrain government anpreciates the friendly action of the British India Steam Navigation Co. Ltd., in endeavouring to discourage shipments direct to the mainland. If this traffic became regular it would injure both this government and the British India Steam Navigation Co. financially. In the case of the present steamer the government can take no action as from informa tion which I have received I understand that the cargo consists of 32,000 bags of rice destined for His Majesty King Ibn Saoud and 2000 bags which are the property of the owner of the ship, further I am informed that the[5% the ship is sailing direct from Bombay to Has Tanura and having no cargo for Bahrain she does not propose calling here. I believe it unlikely that a direct boat will be sent to Has Tanoura except once each year when H. M. King Ibn Saoud is accustomed to import a large quantity of rice which he destributes to the Arabs of Hassa, this takes place each year about this time. I have discussed the matter with H. E. Shaikh Hamad who feels that in this case we can take no action. If vl am aware that the British India Steam Navigation Company consider that the government would be well advised to reduce the ?jfo direct transhipment duty, but H. E. Shaikh Hamad is not prepared to take this action. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Adviser to the Government.left /Vo r Confidential .

Post Box No. 163. Calcutta, 15th June, 1933. The Secretary, British India- oteara Navigation Co. Ltd., London. year Sir, MAINUNj PORTJ VIA BAHREIN . With reference to your Private and Confidential letter No. 110 of the 13th April and our reply No.158 of the 4th ultimo on the subject of shipments to mainland ports via Bahrein we have now to advise that the situation has developed and, in order to keep you informed of the progress of events, we give you below a summary of what has occurred. A conference between the Hedjaz Government and the Bahrein Government has been proposed and endeavours are being made to hold it shortly. In the meantime the Hedjas Government are pressing shippers of rice to arrange for direct shipments to be taken to Fas Tanurah probably with the object in view of strengthening their position at the coming conference. The Bahrein Government are doing all they can to prevent shipment to mainland ports direct and our Bahrein Agents inform us that, in the event of the Company arranging for this direct shipment, the attitude of the Bahrein Government will be unfriendly. The Bahrei n Go vernment apparently have in view that if direct shipment is made to a mainland port it will weaken their case for the imposition of the 2$ transit duty now in force and it will eventually mean that cargo for mainland ports will be shipped direct and not via Bahrein as hitherto. It is clear therefore that if the Hedjaz Government can arrange for a consignment to go forward to a mainland port before the conference is held they will be in a strong position to insist on the Zfo transit duty being abolished. The Hedjaz Government are Ringing pressure to bear on the two largest shippers of cargo destined for the Hedjaz, namely Mr. Elmarzook and Mr. Ali Reza,to arrange for the direct shipment of 30,000 bags available from Calcutta and Rangoon for prompt shipment to Ras Tanrah and these shippers have approached us to arrange tonnage. They have produced letters from Ministers of the Hedjaz Oovernment demanding that, in the event of the Company being unable or unwilling to provide the necessary tonnage, the shippers should arrange for an outside steamer to lift the cargo and we understand Mr. Sheriff Hassam of the Eastern Steam Navigation Company has offered to berth a steamer at Rs. 16/- per ton. ie desire, if possible, to avoid doing anything which would antagonise the Bahrein Government, but we consider that their attitude in this matter is entirely unreasonable and in our opinion if the trade for Bas Tanurah is likely to develop the Company should be ready to cater for it, particularly as it is practically certain that the cargo for mainland ports will be cargo which under the present arrangements would have been shipped by the Company's Subsidiary Gulf Mail steamers to Bahrein. In any case to refuse to cater for the trade to mainland ports would not assist the Bahrein Government in any way as the cargo would still go forward by outside vessels. Although, as mentioned above, we are prepared to berth steamers for the direct trade to mainland ports, we have been unable to do so owing to our Nautical Advisers being definitely of the opinion that the approaches to Pas Tanurah are too dangerous unless aids to navigation are provided in the shape of two buoys. Y«e have accordingly informed, shippers that we are meantime unable to offer them a steamer owing to the approaches to fos Tanurah being insufficiently marked, but have indicated to them that, should the Hedjaz Government be prepared to place two buoys in positions considered by our Marine superintendent to be suitable, we woula be prepared to send a vessel there. &amp; ttticipate that in order to strengthen their case at the coming conference the Hedjaz Government will be prepared to supply the buoys in question and they already indicated their willingness todo so over a year ago, but as it is possible that they have no one capable of giving them expert advice as to the most suitable position in which to anchor the buoys, we have given Bombay i\gents authority to give then the services of a Company’s Officer in case of need and at the request of the Hedjaz Government, As mentioned above, the attitude of the Bahrein Government likely to become unfriendly towards the Company if a steamer is berthed for mainland ports. We do not think that the Bahrein Government is in a position to injure the Company’s interests to any extent and we hope on fuller realisation of the situation they will see that the Company have acted in the only way open to them in their capacity as transporters by sea. We shall advise you of any further developments in this connection. We are, dear dir, Yours faithfully, (ogd). MACKINNON 'ACKENZIE &amp; 00.

This competition, for which the Bahrein Governments levy is directly ^responsible, does not only involve the Company in loss of traffic, but has and will continue to involve the Bahrein Government in considerable loss 01 revenue.

My dear George, P Many thanks for your letter of the 19th Decexnher, Ho.E.7741/368/25 , about Bahrein transit dues. 2. We read with much interest the account of your discussion with Hafiz Wahba. It seems clear that the deterrent effect of the Ahmedi incident has been quite as great as the local authorities reported at the time, and that what the Saudi Government are anxious to do is to obtain some sort of reassurance as to the future, which will make it possible for them to interest British shipping firms in direct shipnents to Ras Tanura. 3. It has, I think, been fairly generally accepted that the action of the Bahrein authorities in the Ahmedi incident was possibly open to criticism and the ground on which they stood not very strong; and, as you say, we have been anxious so far as possible to merge discussion of this particular incident in a general discussion of the question of transit dues. We, like you, are not anxious to ventilate the incident if we can avoid doing so. On the other hand, we regard it as most important to do everything possible to safeguard the interests of Bahrein in this matter and we do not feel that the Saudi Government (who have for the last 13 years derived substantial advantages to which they have no real claim at the expense of Bahrein as the result of the arrangement approved by His Majesty's Government in 1920) •TORendel, Esq. , C.M.G. , Foreign Office, S.W.l.cansafc expect much sympathy from us if they now try to press Bahrein at a time when, as we both know, the condition of Bahreini finances is very unsatisfactory. Apart fran this, in the first place, the record of the Koweit blockade to which you refer in your letter is not such as to encourage us to give way lightly to Saudi representations on matters such as the present; while, in any case, all our experience of Ibn Saud is that any sign of v/eakness on our side encourages him to press for more. 4. We should in these circumstances be disposed, I think, to suggest that the line to be taken with Hafiz Wahba should be firstly that we see no profit in a discussion of the Ahmedi incident and that in the interests not only of friendly relations between Ibn Saud and Bahrein, but of placing this vexed and intricate question of transit dues on a footing satisfactory to both parties, we have consistently urged the summoning of a preliminary conference at Bahrein, the results of which could be confirmed through the diplonatic channel and that we have made it clear that we are prepared to give all possible assistance in connection with such a conference, at which the British Political Agent in Bahirein would be present. Secondly, if he presses Ibn Saud's question as to the precise importance of the incident itself, the answer might be that the Saudi Government should not take this incident as indicative of any settled policy; that no policy has in fact been settled pending the result of the discussions which we have offered to arrange; but that it would be unwise to overlook the risk that, as the Ahmedi incident illustrates, serious difficulties may arise from their point of view unless a friendly arrangement is entered3. into with Bahrein. Finally, it might perhaps he made clear to the Saudi Government that so far as His Majesty's Government are concerned the interests of Bahrein must come first and that so far as we are concerned they need expect no support from us in endeavouring to induce British shipowners to ship direct to Ras Tanura unless and until negotiations with Bahrein on the subject of the transit dues have been undertaken and have failed. 5. A slightly aggressive policy of this nature would, we think, be much the most likely to bring the Saudis to reason. I do not propose in this letter to enter in detail into the arguments on the merits or otherwise of the Ahmedi incident contained in your letter. But I might perhaps say that we cannot, as at present advised, accept the Foreign Office attitude in the matter. In the first place, we cannot agree that the action of the Bahrein State in any event constitutes a blockade of Saudi Arabia. It is merely an endeavour by Bahrein to defend its own interests, and to secure some recanpense for its outlay in equipping and bringing up to date the harbour at Bahrein, and shippers are perfectly free to ship direct to Ras Tanura if they wish to do so and if they do not mind facing any possible consequences with Bahrein; or to use any other channel for imports into Saudi Arabia. Secondly, we do not think it desirable to link this question up with that of the Koweit blockade, save to the extent that we can at a pinch use the history of the blockade to bring home to the Saudi Government the fact that their own record is not immaculate. Bahrein and Koweit must be dealt with separately on their merits. It is a matter of no concern to Koweit whether the Sheikh4. yk VJfO of Bahrein secures transit dues from Ihn Saud or not, and equally, I think, the Sheikh of Bahrein would probably care little about the raising of the Koweit blockade so long as his own difficulties with Saudi Arabia remained unsettled. The real basis of the Bahreini action is necessity. We agree with you that we d o not want to adopt too positive an attitude about it so long as there is any hope of an agreed settlement. But we feel also (and I am sure you will agree) that the Bahrein Government have so far adopted a completely reasonable attitude, and that in so far as obstacles have been placed in the way of a reasonable settlement they have not cane from the Bahreini side. It may well be that in a situation such as might result fran a failure to reach agreement they would cone off worst: they are probably fully alive to such risks as there may be, and they may ( and possibly would) be willing to^ conpremise with Saudi Arabia on the points in issue. But it would, I think, be both unfair to Bahrein and a tactical error to suggest to the Saudi Government that we are likely to adopt an accommodating attitude in the matter or to go any way to meet them at this stage. It would equally be a great mistake to attach o^er much importance to this petty local dispute, or we think, to deal with it in all respects on the lines which might oe applicable if it was a dispute between two great Powers. 6. I am sending a copy of this letter to Marker. I shall, of course, be very glad to discuss the line suggested in it with you at any time. Yours ever, GILBERT LAITHWAITE ' 'IS(30PY SENT TO F.Z. 91/34.

Dear Rendel, Your letter of the 19th Decemher (E.7741/368/25) regarding the Bahrein transit dues. I find it rather difficult to offer any useful observations as apparently things can be, and are done, in these parts of the world which would create a storm if done elsewhere. You are aware of the views of the Board of Trade on the question of these dues and I really cannot add anything to them* As you know, the British lines would not view with favour an increase in the port dues. On the other hand, Bahrein is entitled to levy reasonable transit dues on vessels making use of Bahrein waters in their trade with the mainland. To try and enforce the payment of dues on vessels making no us© whatever of Bahrein waters, and objecting to pay the dues seems to us high-handed to put it ao higher than that. I am sending Baithwaite a copy of this letter• Yours etc., (Sd.) E.H. MARKER. Rendel, Esq., C.M.Gwill change their ’ninde and Agree to B conference. S. ^smrhlle, there are one or two points in. your letter which I should like to take up. g 0 far as I can see, the present noUcy of the Bahraini GOtern?5ent in thl * ts twofold* (a) they intend to levy transit dues on all cargo destined for Saudi. drahia which peseee through their harbour or territorial watewa. whath^r* 3 m t,ner cargo is transshin^ed or not, and ( h ) they wish to ensure by means of preSJ5Urc on companies that no trade goes to the Hass coast direct hut that all trade rith that 00mi P»»ee» through Bahrein anfl psys those dues. v * aS (a), it is perfectly true, as you point out in paragraph £ of your letter, that the B *' m Gover nment have for the last 13 years enjoyed, at the exoense of the Bahraini Government, the exceptionally low rate of the dues charged on cargo Tor houdl Arabia.. On the other hand, these dues h&amp;v© been exacted only on goods which were transshiooed. ''® are huite prepared to agree that, so long ns vessels use - \i ; L | Hidtscrljiinatoiy netare or tti e Bahrein tranalt .laes whlah o«.o„ to o t to be the funaaoe-ota^ re.*,,,* of w^sicneBa nr th., Bahraini Qovernneat• a ooeltio,.

Tf that were oo, an ahlpolng using the harbour should pay the dues end not only that which happens to be carrying cargo for Saudi arable. But Bahrain - ould of course never dress of taking this high bended line with cargo destined for Persia or rod b - J o .- u the shipping eopounics put up with It. 6 - As regards (b! It seems to we that since the Bahreini Oovernvent are stontedly sluing at the suppression of nil trede with the Hess const which does notSfsuaia pre fer t :&gt; e their strivi on ?/hat ?-'e believe to be their legitimate grievance, v?ni it not be to His ?%,1eotyV.

It was in anticipation of sn appeal of this kind from the iau.d.1 Government that I asked you in paragraph B nf my letter of the 19th December to let us have any arguments which you could supnly Ir defence of the ’'Ahmedi' 1 policy. I must odmll that after considering y~&lt;nr reply to my letter, I still feel that our case in regard to thr-t incident Is hopelessly weak.

My dear George, Many thanks for your letter of 28th February, No.E.1167/101/25, and for your previous letter No.E.142/101/25, of 31st January,on the Bahrein Transit Dues. 2. X neea not enter in detail into the points taken in your letter of 31st January, in view of the developments reported in your letter of 28th February, ana I write only to say that we agree entirely with the line adopted by you in your conversation, reported in that letter, with Hafiz Wahba, which seems to us to offer very much the best prospect of a satisfactory outcome to this question. Our general view I „, remains as stated in my letter to you of 3rd January, P.Z.3178/33, and if we can get the Saudis and Bahreinis to get together there ought to be some hope of a reasonable settlement. 3. As regards the points taken in paragraph 4 of your letter, we, as you know, take rather a different view from that held by the Foreign Office. But I ao not think there is any question of the Bahrein authorities 'persisting', to use your own words, 'in the attitude which they have taken up in regard to British ships taking cargo direct to Saudi-Arabian ports', if by that you mean creating further incidents of the same type. Our evidence is to the effect that, v/hatever the merits of the 'Ahmedi' incident, its results have been very satisfactory from the point of view of Bahrein, and, while we should/ii mm should not, of course, wish to say this to Hafiz Wahha, it seems unlihely, while things remain as: they are, that any necessity mil in fact arise for dealing with a further case of the same nature. 4. I am sending copies of this letter to Marker at the Board of Trade. Copies are also going to Fowle and to the Government of India, who have had copies of the previous correspondence. J. G.

It emerges from your telegrams to the Government of India No.47 of January 18 and No.67 of January 26, 1933, that the Ahmedi incident was held to have involved a violation, not of the Jiluwi Agreement, hut of an agreement with Marzuk. In the former telegfam you referred to your despatch No. 773S (r;ic in my copy, hut I think a mistake for 778s) of October 14, 1932. The despatch just mentioned describes a proposal made by Marzuk to Prior and a counter suggestion by the Bahrain Government but I cannot trace anything further in my files. las the agreement actually concluded on the basis of the proposal and the counter-sug, estion and, if so, did it ever assume written form? I presume that in any case it applied only to Marzuk and that he was the shipper of the Ahmedi cargo. It has always worried me a bit that, if I should again have to discuss the Ahmedi affair with the Saudi Government, which God forbid, I should not myself be clear on this point, whether or not I had any occasion to use it.

At this point I said that, although there were other outstanding questions, I did not wish to trouble His Majesty personally with them, and I proceeded to make a suitable little speech of ihrewell. After hearing it, the King said he had something further to s^eak about. His Majesty's Governmant were worried about restrictions on trade with Kuwait. What of restrictions on trade with Nejd? I asked what he meant and found that he referred to the action taken at Bahrain in regard to direct shipments to the Hasa Coast, and was under the impression that 'the Government' had prohibited such shipments . On my asking whether he meant His Majesty's Government or the Bahrain Government he Mighed scornfully at the mention of the latter. I said that I knew of only one incident, in which the Bahrain Government had taken action to prevent an abuse of the facilities afforded by Bahrain, by a ship which had tfcied to take advantage of these facilities to land cargo at Bahrain and so lighten herself sufficiently to be able to land cargo on the Hasa coast, where the ports were not equipped to receive cargoes in the ordinary way. I observed that the ship had proceeded before the matter could be rex erred to higher authority, but that His Majesty's Government had subsequently proposed a discussion of the whole subject of transit, including that of direct shipments to the mainland. The Saudi Government had rejected this proposal, and, on receipt of a further communication from the Legation, had transferred the negotiations to London, with the result that I had/-2- 'i^'h had not been concerned in them for nearly two years. 23. The King was insistent that no obstacles should be placed in the way of direct shipment to his ports. If it was a question of port equipment, ha said, he could complete the equipment in two months, but what would be the good, if ships were prevented from taking cargo to Has T^nura? And why should that port be treated differently from Debai, Basra or any other port? He asked for an assurance that, if he did equip Has Tanura, ships should not be prevented from going there. Indeed, at one moment he asked that they should be told to go there, to which I replied that His Majesty's Government could not in normal times direct the movements of ships. I pressed him on the subject of the alleged prohibition and at last elieited the admission th.t he could not substantiate the allegatioi , though he still evidently thought that an adverse attitude was being taken up. I promised to report what he said, but adhered to my own view that the Saudi Government would have done better to fall in with the proposal of His Majesty’s Government for a general discussion with the object of reconciling the interest of Bahrain and the mainland by an agreement, which could, if necessary, be made operative for a fixed time.

My dear George, I enclose a re-draft of the proposed Instructions about Bahrain Transit Dues. I haa a few further words with Laithwaite on Monday evening and he agreed that it might he a good thing to improve the sequence and give them greater precision. I told him that, as regards the substance, I was still nervous about the last phrase in the original draft and he suggested that it would suffice to shew that the question of a drastic refusal of exemption had been considered but that such a threat should not be used prematurely. I have assumed that the instructions to Jedda and Bushire will go by despatch, so that the increased length will not matter. I have made tne re-draft somewhat hurriedly, not wishing to miss the post. I leave it confidently to you to pull it about as much as you like. You know all my ideas on the suoject and will not need to refer back to me. I hope to puo all these things out of my mind until I see you again on October 22. Yours in haste, (Sd.)ANDREW RYAN.0 rreneral line tn hfi t.ni^on lAl3eaiin K witTT^QMg nog^M^I^I^^ ^ ''’ S policy of His Ivj&amp;jesty's Government to press for an early discussion of tills Question at a Saudi-Bahraini conference, to Oe held at Bahrain, with tne assistance of the political authorities, to explore all the issues and endeavour to arrive at a settlement which would he confirmed in due course through the diplomatic channel, see the 1932 correspondence, the record of Sir A. Ryan's conversation with Ibn Saud at Taif on July 13th last and the record of the conversation with iuad Bey Hamza at the Foreign Office on September 21. 2. If the Saudi Government now agree to this local conference and a settlement acceptable to the Governments concerned results from it, cadit Quaestio . if a settle ment does not result, the ground will be clear for further discussion with the Saudi Government in the course of the general negotiations contemplated after sir A.Ryan returns to Jedda. • 3. If, as a condition of agreeing to the local conference the Saudi Government press for a statement by His Majesty's Government as to their attitude regarding tlx imposition of restrictions by Bahrain on direct shipments to the Rasa Coast, Mr. Calvert, or in due course sir a. Ryan, is authorized to make a statement on the following lines, using discretion as to the precise form to be given to it;- (a) The action of the Bahrain authorities at the time of the isolated Ahmedi incident was an expedient adopted by them in conditions of urgency ana did not represent a consiuered policy of His Majesty' s Government. (h)/ •. v-- 2 - (t)) Neither His Majesty's Government nor the Bahrain Government have forbidden shipping companies to accept cargo for direct shipment to the Hasa Coast, under penalty of not being allowed to call at Bahrain, although, in the single case of the Ahmeai, transit duty was claimed. His Majesty's Government cannot in fact issue instructions to shipping companies regarding such matters in normal circumstances. It is for the companies themselves to consider applications for facilities for direct shipment, having regard to all the factors affecting them, including such regulations as may be made oy the Bahrain Government in the exercise of their sovereign rights. (c) His Majesty's Government are, however, anxious to promote the removal of all causes of difficulty in connexion with the general Question of shipments for Hasa. If the local conference is agreed to and produces favour able results, they will urge the Bahrain Government to refrain from any future action analogous to that taken in ' the case of the Ahmedi. (d) It is owing to the influence of His Majesty's Government, which was exerted strongly with the Bahrain Government in 1920, that Saudi importers have for many years enjoyed the benefit of a very favourable rate of transit duty, which has in recent years been insufficient to cover the cost of the increased facilities provided at Bahrain for goods in transit. His Majesty's Government cannot, however, ignore the importance of the transit trade to the economic life of Bahrain, while recognizing that the fostering of direct trade to the Saudi mainland is/mmmi BSHHI is a matter entirely within the rights of the Saudi Government, they must equally recognize that any considerable diversion of trade from its present channels would seriously affect the revenues of Bahrein and would necessarily compel the Bahrain Government to compensate themselves Toy raising the dues on goods continuing to pass through Bahrain. The interests of Bahrain and Hasa must continue to he interdependent for many years to come and the case is one for a mutual accommodation of those interests. (e) His ivajesty's Government consider that this statement should remove any misgiving on the part of the Saudi Government as to their attitude, which is inspired solely by their desire to promote the desired accommodation of interests, as a result of a free exchange of views between experts qualified by local knowledge to aavise on the best means of attaining it. 4. If the Saudi Government should now agree to the local conference and its proceedings should nevertheless be delayed by insistence on the Saudi' side on the grievances alleged by Ibn Saud, the political Agent will have authority to make a statement on the above lines at any stage, where it may seem to him appropriate. 5. The Saudi Government have made a special point of urging that goods consigned to Ibn Saud or his Government shoula be exempted from transit dues. If the local conference is agreed to, this point will doubtless be raised and it will be necessary to define the scope of any such exemption. If no settlement is arrived at, it may become necessary, not only to raise the dues, but to restrict the exemption or to refuse any exemption whatsoever/whatsoever, even in the case of goods for Ibn sand's personal use. It is left to the discretion of the Legation in Jedda and the political Agent to include a hint as to the ultimate possibility of a severe restriction of existing exemptions in any statement on the above lines, but care should be taken to avoid any premature pronouncement which might be construed as a threat aimed at Ibn Sana personally.Confidential .

I told them that I was just going away and could not aiscuss matters in detail,but told them that the Hon’ble the Political Eesident had examined their petition on nis last visit,and told them that all that was possible was being none to conserve the transit trade for Bahrain. 2. They mentioned that they nad information that a ware house was oeing ouilt at Has Tanoura and tnat Bin Sa’ud’s Government nad bought a ship,though they did not nave details about the ship. 3. They produced the argument that if they were not allowed to go to Saudi Arabian territory,wny snould Sa f udi Arabian merchants oe allowed facilities in Bahrain. It is,of course, in theory unanswerable,though as practical persons we must recognise that there is a aiiierence. A. They would like the limit on cargo of &lt;t,u00 uags to oe cancelled at once to enable them to compete in the trade as they did not want to ship amounts as xarge as ^,000 oags. 5. After the interview I telephoned to the Adviser, who says ne nas received an acknowledgment to nis telegram about the i,000 bags limit from the British India Steam Navigation Company Limited but not a specific answer to the enquiry. 6 .

Mr.Russell interviewed Colonel Loch on the 27th May 1933 in regard to certain matters raised in telegrams and letters he had received from his Principals in Bombay. These were:- (a) that A1 Marzuir-was endeavouring th arrange a direct shipment to mainland ports,and (b) asking the Agent to press for a withdrawal of the 2 per cent R.E.Puty Colonel Loch forwarded copies of the telegrams and letters to the Resident with his comments,and a.dvised the B.I to have patience until the conference with the Sa’udi Government. 3. In regard to: vj (a) . There has been no direct shipment to the mainland by Steamer since the ’Ahmedi’ incident. The Company’s only competitors in this have been country craft . (b) . A withdrawal of the 2 per cent R.E.Duty will mean the.t the Bahrain Government will have no interest in the transit trade,as they v/i 1 *! have nothing to gain. ! i 4. With reference to the proposed Conference: it would appear from Jedda telegram No:143 to the Resident that it is the intention of the Sa’udi Government to reject the conference idea, H.B.M’s Minister proposed sending a lurther note on the same subject before he left Jedda on the 16th July 1933. It is not known whether he has done so and what the present position is. 5. I have not heard of a local firm of the name of Messrs Ibrahim Yusuf Zainad Ali Reza.but am asking the Head Munshi to find out. ' 6 . If the report is true that this firm is trying to charter the s.e •Haideri' for the carriage 0 f goods to mainland ports and joe.olbly to Bahrain,it nay be necessary to consider what action should be taken if and when she arrives at Bahrain. 7.

I discussed this question with Mr.Belgrave on the 30th November 1933 and pointed out that it was difiicult for us to ash the British India Steam Navigation Company Limited to continue to refuse to ship direct to the mainland as it merely drove a certain amount of freight into other peoples’ pochets without any benefit to Bahrain. At the same time we did not wish to encourage the Sa’udi Arabian Government to go on with their port at Ras Lanurah. But it seemeu probable that the Americans,if they found oil, would develop Ras Tanurah or some other port on the main land. I said that I had suggested to the Resident that a/r (g) possible line of action would be to raise the transit dues at once to 5 per cent in order to get the benefit of showing; independence towards the Sa’udi Arabian Government,having regard to the fact that ‘in any case Bahrain was likely to lose the transit trade: we (the P.R and myself) had,however, agreed that it was too early to take rather drastic action of this nature. 2. I asked Mr.Belgrave if it was not possible to try to save something out of the wreck by reducing the transit trade rate to 1 per cent,as then it would be much less paying to tho-direct shippers^ind might save the transit trade to Bahrain. He said that he would go into the matter and see exactly what such an action would cost Bahrain,ana that he would talk the matter over with Mr.de Grenier. 3.
