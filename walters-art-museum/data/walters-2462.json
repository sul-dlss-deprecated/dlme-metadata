They also served a funerary function, perpetuating the donor's name. Offerings continued to be made to the statue long after the owner's death. Irj-aa, a priest of Amen, is shown wearing a double wig, a style fashionable in the New Kingdom. The statue type and wig demonstrate how 25th Dynasty artists drew on earlier periods for inspiration. On the left side of the body is a carving of Irj-aa adoring the Osiris symbol of Abydos, the god's burial place.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters, 1912", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/27993", "Provenance": "Dikran Kelekian, New York and Paris;  Henry Walters, Baltimore, 1912, by purchase;  Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest. \r\n", "Dynasty": "25th Dynasty", "OnView": 1, "PublicAccessDate": "2008-09-25T17:13:39.05", "Creator": "Egyptian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL9_22.141_Fnt_SL_T.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL9_22.141_Fnt_SL_T.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL9_22.141_Fnt_SL_T.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL9_22.141_Fnt_SL_T.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL9_22.141_Fnt_SL_T.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1544582", "ExhibIDs": "", "Images": "PL2_22.141_Fnt_BW.jpg, PL9_22.141_Fnt_SL_T.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Centre Street: Second Floor: Egyptian Art"}
