I have the honour to inform you that there has been some trouble with the 1. Petition dated the oOth December 13S4 of eight Baharinah to His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad bin ! Isa A1 Khalifah* 2* Reply dated the 29th January 19S5 from His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad bin 'Isa A1 Khalifah to the Petitioners. 5, Political Agent's address on the 1st February 1955 to the Baharinah Petitioners. Baharinah and to enclose a copy of the mrginally noted documents on the subject 2. As you know, the Baharinah, who are Shi'ahs, inhabited Bahrain before the coming of the A1 Khalifah, who are Sunnis. The A1 Khalifah and Arab portion of the population look down on the Baharinah (who form perhaps tv /o-thirds of the population) and have at times in the past definitely oppressed them. Since the abdica tion of the late Shaikh Sir f Isa bin Uli A1 Khalifah their position has been much improved owing to our influence and the tolerance of His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad bin 1 Isa A1 Khalifah. S. The ill-feeling between the Baharinah and the A1 Khalifah has, however, again become acute owing to a series of incidents in the past year; the conversion of one of the A1 Khalifah to the /Shi 1 ah--- ■■■lill.i II. |H M —■-.r:- Shi 1 ah faith, date garden troubles due to the fall in prices which has seriously affected the tenancy system in vogue, a feeling that they are not sufficiently provided with educational facilities, the depredations caused by camels belonging to the Shaikh^ alleged unfair judgments by Shaikh Salman bin Hamad in the Bahrain Court and other smaller matters, 4. The improveinent in their position and the impact of modern ideas in Bahrain has rendered the Baharinah less ready to accept their lot and has given them aspirations, some of which are under standable and reasonable, but has siso, unfortunately, caused them to make political demands of an extravagant nature and by intemper ate methods. 5. You will remember that in November 1934 vie discussed with the Adviser to the Bahrain Government certain demands which the Baharinah were thinking of making, including a request for the introduction of a Code in the Bahrain Courts. It was decided that, if the matter was brought up, a start should be made by collecting all the Proclamations of the Bahrain Government and appointing a Committee to go into the possibility of drawing up a Code. It was further decided that it would be in-appropriate for the Adviser to serve on the Committee, though he would (as would the Political Agent) be ready to help and advise from the background. 6. On the 20th December 19M eight leaders of the Baharinah, who held what purported to be an authority signed by the leading men of all the villages, were permitted by His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad bin ^sa A1 Khalifah to submit to him a petition (couched, as the result of advice from the Adviser and others, in temperate language) making three demands:- /CDCD (li) (iii) At the same time, however, they started to hold excited meetings in the Matams (religious centres) and formulated further demands, some of which were most extravagant* The villagers, among whom are many unemployed and who have suffered mach from the fall in prices, were enticed into Manamah on the plea that if they . came to the meetings and paid two bezahs (half an anna), work would be obtained for them on the Oil Field. ?• The position regarding the three points mentioned in the petition and the action taken on them may be summarised as follows:- ( a ) The Code * The Sunni and Shi 1 ah Qadhis were consulted in writing and welcomed the principle of a Code, with certain reasonable reservations by the Sunni Qadhis about the use of Shara 1 laws in certain matters (marriage and so on). (b) • Proportionate representati o n on the lla.jlis al TujLiarah and the Baladiyahs . His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad approved of a substantially increased representation of the Baharinah in both bodies; indeed, increases on the Baladiyahs had already received his sanction - in Manamah up to equality with the Arabs. (c). Education . Three or four years ago a so-called Board of Education had to be abolished owing to dissensions and inefficiency and control of Education placed in the hands of Shaikh ? Abdulla,h bin 'Isa. The schools are all open to the Shi 1 ah Baharinah (indeed, one at Suq al Khamts is entirely Shi 1 ah) as well as to the /Sunnis that a Code for the Bahrain Courts should be drawn up, that proportionate representation on the Majlis al Tujjarah and on the Baladiyahs (Municipalities) should be accorded to them, and that certain alleged rights in connection with Education should be restored to them./9. Sunnls and they attend in large numbers. Unfortunately financial stringency has so far prevented the establishment of village schools which would be more useful to the Baharinah than to the Arabs, but it is intended to proceed with the establishment of more schools as soon as funds are available. There is a large element of personalities in this question and among their spoken demands was the appointment of a certain young man to be Head Master of the Manamah School, 8. On the 30th January the four Manamah leaders called on the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Two were civil but the other two were very rude and referred to the Shaikh's letter in vulgar terms. They said that none of their requests had been granted and that as they had failed to attain their ends by lawful means, they would use other means, and pointed out that there was great excite ment among the Baharinah all over the Island, They compared their position to that of people in other countries, for example, f Iraq, but would admit no comparison with Sa f udi Arabia where, they said, sheer oppression reigned. They threatened that people in India would support them and that they had friends who would write to the Press (including 'The Times'), They appeared to feel most strongly about education, but chiefly on the ground that the nephew of one of the petitioners ought to be the Head Master of the Manamah School, They seemed almost uninterested in the question of establishing more schools in the country villages, which are entirely Shi'ah. They claimed that but for their backing Shaikh Sir Hamad would not have become Shaikh, and there are points of resemblance between the present trouble and that which arose just before the abdication of the late Shaikh Sir 'Isa bin 'Ali A1 Khalifah,9. On the 129th January His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad replied in a letter to the eight petitioners in reasonable terms, but they affected to disbelieve his good faith and resorted to organized agitation, and he granted them an interview on the Slst January. 10* Either during the course of the agitation or at the inter view, the Baharinah leaders pressed their original demands in quite unreasonable forms and also put forward a number of further demands of an extravagant nature. They demanded that the whole perso n ne l of the Committee to draw up the proposed Code should be Baharinah; that an individual, f Abdul Kerim son of the late Hajji Salman, -&amp; should be made head of the Police; that they should have a majority on the Baladiyahs; that the Majlis al Tujjarah, which forms an integral part of the Courts of Justice, should be elected instead of appointed; and that a third Shi'ah Qadhi should be appointed. They claimed that the Baharinah were not being employed by The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited and not enough employed by the Bahrain Government. They threatened to destroy the bridges on the road to the Oil Field and to shut up their shops, and one of the leaders even went so far as to say he would leave the Island (this is regarded locally as the last word in threats). Though some of their demands were reasonable, others were extravagant and foolish, and the leaders showed themselves ignorant, boorish and lacking in any sense of proportion. His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad, who Is usually most peace-loving, was angered by their impertinence of demeanour and by their wild demands and threats which, he considered (as was indeed true), meant handing over the administration to them, and rebuked them sternly. The situation was sufficiently uncertain j for His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad to send his family to Miharraq /and *• Actually the question of training him was under active consider ation, but such a demand from a section of the population is impossible to concede.and to come to the interview with armed retainers. The Armed Police were ordered to be ready in case they were required. I should, however, make it clear that in these matters the country Baharinah, who are decent folk, have been led astray by certain evil townsmen. 11♦ When a copy of the letter of the eight leaders to His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad was first sent to me by the Adviser at their request I refused to see them as the matter was one with which the Bahrain Government should deal, but after His Excellency's reply and after the stormy interview mentioned above, I felt that it was wiser for me to see them in order to make it clear that they need expect no support in their unconstitutional agitation from His Majesty 1 s Government. I, therefore, granted them an interview and addressed them in terms of which I enclose a trans lation and which may be summed up as follows:- (a) that the matters were internal and for the Ruler to settle, (b) that the Ruler was attending to their represent ations, and (c) that, if there was any trouble, they eight and not the common folk would be held responsible. 12. I understand that the agitation died down as soon as it was clear that both the Ruler and I would hold the leaders respons ible and I hope that there is now little risk of violence. 13. I have counselled His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad to proceed with doing what is reasonable and right for his Baharinah subjects and have emphasised that these matters are for the Ruler and not His Majesty's Government to settle. 14. The appointment of a Committee to deal with the Code is under active discussion: the number of Baharinah on the Manamah Baladiyah has been increased (sanctioned before the agitation) in the forthcoming elections from three to six, that is to the same number that the Arabs have. Two seats will be given to them /on the7 on the Baladiyah in Muharraq. If suitable Baharinah merchants can he found, the appointment of more of them tothe Majlis al Tu.1jarah will be considered. i5rf Education is a more difficult matter, but the financial position seems to be improving and, if so, it should be possible to establish schools in the villages. It may be, too, that the present circumstances will afford a suitable opportunity for taking all schools in Bahrain under the Bahrain Government. 16® Beside the political and administrative grievances of the Baharinah, there is a complaint of long standing that the camels of the Al Khalifah eat their crops. There is some foundation for this complaint and I shall try to persuade His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad that steps should be taken to control these voracious beasts. 17. I would conclude by saying that I have sympathy with the country Baharinah, and with the ordinary townsman, and I believe that His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad is ready to improve their position (as he has already done in the case of the Baladiyahs), but it is quite impossible in a place like Bahrain to tolerate threats of violence or agitation. At the same time the nature of some of the demands which have been submitted and the fact that certain Arabs have been talking of counter-demands show that the disruptive political tendencies of the present time are at work even in Bahrain. It will not be easy for the Al Khalifah to maintain their tribal form of rule, but it is in many respects well suited to the Island and measures are gradually being taken to adapt it to the complicated and changing circumstances of the Bahrain of today. I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant Colonel, Political Agent, Bahrain.10 Ly Translation of a letter dated the 23rd Ramadhan 1353 (30th December 1934) from eight Bahama leaders to His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad bin *Isa A1 Khalifah, K^G.I.E., Ruler of Bahrain. After Compliments. We, your loyal Baharnah subjects, beg to make the following three demands for reform which are necessary for the existing state of affairs First: Court cases should be dealt with properly in accordance with law, namely, in every judgment passed in a case the section of proper law applied should be quoted so that the Judge passing such judgment will not be accused of injustice and that the person against whom a judgment is passed will be satisfied that justice has been administered in his case and that the Judge has been impartial. By means of these, the rights of the individuals will be protected. Second: As we form the majority of the inhabitants, it is but just that we should be represented on both Majlises - Baladiyah and 'Urfi - with a proportionate number. Third: We request you to do us justice by restoring our rights on the Board of Education of which we have been deprived for many years and have been considered like foreigners although the foreigners have not been deprived, the fact which is contrary to justice and equity. Your Excellency will see that these are fair and reasonable demands ^nd there is nothing improper in them. We, therefore, request you to give the matter your just and kind consideration and give orders for justice, for which you are known. Nevertheless, to put these demands into practice it will show your good policy and the zeal you take for administering justice and extending reforms which is the quality of the Kings. We assure Your Excellency that the reason for making these demands is the belief among your subjects of your desire for justice, equity and reforms. However, they are all your loyal subjects.„ •&gt;&gt; C 1 I Translation of a letter from His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad bin iisa A1 Khalifah, K.C.I.E., Ruler of Bahrain, to the eight Baharinah leaders. After Compliments« We acknowledge the receipt of your letter which you handed to us on 23rd Ramadhan in which you stated that you approached us on behalf of our Baharinah subjects living in Bahrain/ We under stand from your letter that you ask us for the following things:- (a) That the Courts of Bahrain should adopt a Code in order that every judgment of the Bahrain Court should refer to a certain clause of this Code similar to the system existing in the Agency Courts. (b) That the number of your representatives on both the Majlis Tujjarah and Baladiyahs should be more than at present. (c)• That you should have equal rights in the Education which is provided by the Government* S. Regarding the question of the courts, we will consider the matter according to your request which is also desired by our other subjects and the Sunni and Shi f ah Qadhis, but before instituting a code it is necessary to compile and publish the existing code which is contained in our proclamations which we have issued from time to time during our rule. Also it is necessary to determine the amount of punishment which persons disobeying this code will deserve. For this purpose we will appoint a committee to examine our previous proclamations and suggest, after consideration and consultation suitable punish ments which will be appropriate for all forbidden things. After completing this we will publish our proclamations in a book and % this will be the local law. At the same time we will examine some codes which exist in other Muslim countries and we will adopt a criminal and a civil code for cases which are not sent to the Shara ! courts. But I would remind you that this matter is of great importance and requires hard work and much consideration nor can it be undertaken lightly or completed in a short time. 3. Regarding the representation of our Sunni and Shi ! ah subjects on the two Municipal Councils we agree that the number of representatives of our subjects should be more than the number of representatives of subjects of other countries, although as you are aware, the foreign nationalities, especially in Manaraah, hold an important place in regard to commercial affairs and fin ance. Insha ? Allah we will deal with this matter during the coming elections. 4. Regarding the members of the Majlis Tujjarah, as you understand this Majlis consists of leading merchants of all nationalities who are capable of examining and giving reports on cases relating to accounts and commercial affairs which are referred to them by our courts or by the courts of the Political .Agency. If we can find some Shi * ah merchants who are suitable and important and who have knowledge of commercial practice and custom in that case we shall be pleased to appoint them as members of the Majlis Tujjarah. wh^v, &lt;0 5 egar&lt; ? ing J ducation ' we are ha PPy to see the progress •AMulish^ ?? u® s-^'in-i-stration of our brother.

These are all internal matters and you have quite rightly addressed His Excellency the Shaikh, who has written you a just and king answer and has also seen you. I know that he is con sidering what can be done for you in these matters, but this is bound to take time. In the meantime I advise you to be very careful, for if there is any trouble or any intrigue among the Baharinah or in the villages, or any act like the collecting of bezahs which was done the other day, you eight people will be held responsible - Xou eight and not the poor and ignorant will be held responsible. You are permitted to go.19/169 ! ts Telegr&amp;.m G.T.C. From Political Resident, Bushire. To Political, Bahi'b.in. No•266. Dated the 3rd March 1935.

To:~ The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian ^ulf, Bushire, Sir, ft-- fD / I have the honour to refer to your telegram No:S56 dated the 3rd Jilarch 1955 containing a message for the Adviser to the Bahrain Government and his reply contained in rny telegram No;44 dated the 5th March 1935 that His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad bin T Isa A1 Khalifah is appointing Shaikh Salman bin Hamad, Hajji Yusuf bin Ahms.d Kanoo and Ifensur al Arayidh. 2, After your and Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen 1 s visits Shaikh Sir Hamad bin f Isa Al Khalifah went on an hunting expedition, but on his return I saw him and Shaikh ♦Abdullah bin ! Isa on the ^nd March at Sakhir* 1 told them (l had previously spoken to Shaikh 'Abdullah on similar lines) that I was afraid of the trouble caused by the Baharinah, not because of the Baharinah but because of the troubles experienced all over the world owing to the common people derrianding ; for good or ill, a share in their own Government. I pointed out that the trouble in Bahrain was not confined to the Baharinah for the Arabs had started talking of counter claims♦ I emphasised that the distance between a demand for a share in the Government and a republic was not great and that it behoved Rulers to consider these matters. In the particular case under discussion. His Excellency had promised to consider certain claims which had been put forward and had, indeed met some of them. He had /promised/3 2. promised a Corainlttee to examine the possibilities of a 'Qanun^, If he appointed a Committee he had a good answer to any public clamour: if he did not do so or delayed doing so and clamour were to break forth, he would have no answer to give to the people, and that I could not help him. I informed the Adviser of this conversation before leaving on tour and asked him to press the matter when he next had a suitable opportunity, which was fortunately made by your telegram* 4. The position at the moment is that His Excellency has appointed Shaikh Salman bin Hamad, who is I believe really interested in the question, las head of the Committee, and that Hajji Yusuf bin Ahmad Kanoo and Mansur al Arayidh (who is in Bombay) are being asked by letter and telegram respectively if they will serve on the Committee. 5. As soon as replies have been received, an 'Alan will issue appointing the Committee and explaining that the pre liminary collection of material will start forthwith. 6. As I said in the last paragraph of my letter No:C/112 dated the 18th February 1935 it will not be easy for the Al Khalifah to maintain their tribal form of rule, but it is in many respects well suited to the Island and measures are being ^ ■■ ■ ' ■ gradually to adapt it to the complicated and changing circumstances of the nhrain of today# I entirely agree that this Committee should be appointed and start work without delay and that the other matters should be attended to (increased representation on the Manamah Baladiyah has already been granted) These matters really, however, affect only the townsmen and I feel that it is even more important that His Excellency and the Al Knalifah should set themselves to win over the large numbers /ofs. of country Baharlnah and if possible to keep them content.

W [J I have the honour to enclose copies oi two letters from Co lone X Loch, Ko .C/J^S-l.V®, dated the 18th February 1935, and N0 .C /X6O, dated the 6th i !arch 1. 35, on the subject of unrest amongst the Baharinah subjects of the Shaikh of Bahrain. ' 2. The situation briefly is as follows. In 1780 the Al Khalifah, (the present ruling family of Bahrain), migrated from the Arabian mainland, and took the Bahrain Islands, of which the original inhabitants were the Baharinah. The latter are Shi*ah, and are looked down on by the Al Khalifah and the Arab portion of the population, (as Colonel Loch points out in paragraph 2 of his first letter), who have in the past oppress ed them. Since the abdication of the last Shaikh their position has much improved owing to our influence and the tolerance of the present Ruler. 3* There has never been any attempt at a census of the Bahrain population but it is believed to be some 120,000 or more. Of this the Al Khalifah family number perhaps two hundreds The other elements according to a very rough estimate which is all that is possible, might be as follows. Arab Sunnis /-2- Sunnla 20% of the total population^ and foreigners 20% of whom most are Nejdis and other Arabs^ but some ox whom are Persian Shi'ahs, Baharinah 60%. Whatever aaount of guess work there may be in this computation it is agreed that the Baharinah number well over half of the total inhabitants• 4, The Baharinah are now certainly better treated than they have ever been in the past, but it is an interesting paradox that people do not generally rise, or become restive| when they are actually being oppressed (the very fact of being oppressed prevents this), but when, from one cause or another, they get better treatment which (as indicated in the case of the Baharinah in paragraph 4 of Colonel Loch's first letter quoted above) gives them at the same time new aspirations and new opportuni ties for turning these aspirations into realities# Moreover at the present time one might say, not so much that the idea of self-government(for those communities without it) is in the air, as that the air is saturated with it. This is the case in most of the countries of the Middle Kast with which Bahrain is in touch, while in India - with which Bahrain is closely connected - the idea of self -government is about to be given a practical form on a vast scale* In these circumstances, and having regard to the position of the Baharinah, it is not at all surprising that they show some signs of unrests on the contrary it would be surprising if they did not» 6» So much for general considerations* The main concrete demands of the Baharinah, as stated in Colonel Locl^s letters and from various conversations which I have had with him arid with the Adviser (Mr.Belgrave), appear to be as follows: A. * Reform of the Bahrain Courts. B. Proportional Representation on the mmicipal Councils of the two Townships of Manama and Muharraq. C. Better educational facilities.-3- yith regard to A . There are four Bahrain Courts,(as opi^osed to the Agency ones) f tlie equivalent of Small Cause and Sessions, aiKi a Court of Appeal which consists of the Shaikh himself, and the Shara 1 (or Ecclesiastical) Court. There is also the Majlis al Tujjarah which is a body of merchants to whom commercial cases are referred from the secular Courts lor an opinion* ?• The Lower Court is presided over by one of the al Khali i ah family, as is the District Court. The Baharinah complain that this being so they do not get justice from these Courts, that in civil cases where Baharinah end Arabs are concerned awards are given against the former, and that in criminal cases ouch severer punishments are meted out to convicted -iaharinah than to Arabs. Colonel Loch informs me that in his opinion these complaints are not without foundation# \ B. To meet these complaints in part the Shaikh for some I in - rtf imi-wffwuHr-ii ii t - ,.: - ' years pact has on the Joint Court placed Mr.Belgrave as Joint Judge and Magistrate with the AX Khalifah official. This practice naturally has ensured the administration of justice, but it is in my opinion definitely undesirable. irom the administrative point of view Mr.Belgrave has quite as much as he can do in attending to the financial affairs of the State, as well as commanding the Police which he already does in addition to his other duties, and his valuable time should not be wasted in trying court cases. Krom the political point of view it is undesirable that we should be associated in public opinion with a measure of interference in, and responsibility for, Bahrain internal alfairs, as is implied by there being a British official(even though not in our service) as Judge. It is not our business in Bahrain to administer justice for the Bahrain Govern ei t, but to induce and /1 -4- and teach tne latter to administer justice themselves, and it is a reflection on the judicial system of that Government that justice can only be ensured by the placing of a foreigner on the Bench. 9. The main Baharinah demand in connection with the Courts is that a Code should be draum up which would prevent injustice. The Baharinah are very vague on the subject of this Code but apparently what they have in mind is something on the lines of the Civil and Criminal Codes in use in the Agency Court. To meet this demand I have, as a first step, recommended to Colonel Loch and the Adviser that the numerous Notices issued from time to time during the past years by the Bahrain Government dealing with multitudinous subjects, important and otherwise, should be \ t codified. These Notices form the only law on which the ■ i fi decisions of the Bahrain Courts are based. I was of opinion that &amp;r.Belgrave himself should not be a member oi the Conmittee so that t&amp;is preliminary concession to the Baharinah demand, (though of course it does not go as far as they would like), should appear as coming from the Bahrain Government, without interference from us. This would not of course present Mr. Belgrave assisting the Committee with his experience from behind the scenes. I was also of opinion that a Baharinah j shoulxl be a member of the Committee so that that community / 4/ i' \ should be associated in public opinion with the work under taken. The Shaikh is appointing a Committee on which a Baharinah will sit and which will commence their labours shortly. When they have completed their codifying it will be possible to see how much law actually exists in Bahrain, and how much more it will be advisable to add. : 10. The preparation of complete Civil and Criminal Codes, aa demanded toy the Baharinah (though without any real |\ appreciation /appreciation of what is involved), would be a very difficult and complicated work, and I am by no means certain that such a Code would on the whole be advantageous to that community. 11, On the supposition that the codifying of the otices gives a satisfactory minimum of law to carry on with, an alternative to complete Civil and Criminal Codes (or at any rate to a Civil Code, a simple Criminal Code would be easier I to draw up) would be to add to th^Khalifah Judge of the Small Cause and District Courts one or two joint judges, or assessors, one of whom should be a Baharinah. This would probably satisfy the Baharinah and ensure their receiving more even-handed justice* However, until the codifying of the TTotices has been completed no steps can be taken in this direction. 12. With regard to the Majlis al Tujjarah, the Baharinah demand is for proportional representation. This demand cannot be acceded to: no body of coianiercial experts can be selected on these lines. as pointed out in paragraph 7 (b) in Colonel Loch 1 s letter of 18th February the Shaikn has agreed to increas- * ed representation of the Baharinah on this Court, provided suitable men can be louna. The Baharinah are, indeed, but little affected by tae Majlis al Tujjarah, for they do not enter to any extent into commerce. /■. . 13• With regard to the Shara* (ecclesiastical)Court. The 3 Sunni Kazis try their cases in a body, while the two Shi 1 ah Kazis who deal with the Baharinah cases try them separately. There is a demand from the Baharinah that a ohird Kazi should be appointed and that the Shi 1 ah Kazis should adopt the collective method of their Sunni colleagues. I think that this____ „ - -n -6- 14• With regard to B » Before 'Uie election for the present Mimicipal Council in Lanama took place (about a month ago), the Shaikh had already agreed (before the recent agitation) to an increase in representation of the Baharinah (vide paragraph 7 (b) of Colonel Loch's letter of 18th February). In Manama where there are a large number of Baharinah this representation was increased up to equality with the Arabs. There were | rumours that the Baharinah would not be satisfied with this increase and would refuse to vote# When, however, it came to the x &gt;oint they voted in greater strength than ever before# The next Municipal election is not for another two years so this particular damand of the Baharinah is not an urgent one. 16. With regard to C # -Education. This important matter is touched on in paragraph 7 (c) of Colonel tioch's letter of 18 th February and will require further and careful consider a- tion. 16. Apart from the actual details of what concessions are to be made to the -^aharlnah, it is most advisable that the Shaikh - &gt; . -r-. ; ; j' as well as his relatives (who have coiJisiderable local influence) should be acquainted with the general facts of the situation as they appear to His Maje8ty # s Government, and I ^ i; propose, subject to the approval of the Government of India, at the first opportunity to have a serious talk with the Shaikh and the more important members of his family on the following lines: That I have reported to His Majesty's Government at length on the Baharinah question, and that I am instructed to convey the following message verbally to His excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad bin 'Isa Al Khalifah. That however well adapted J J purely autocratic methods may have been to conditions in the 1^ &lt;j| past, times have now changed and governments must now depend, t to / 7: ' - ■-7- to a large extent, on the public opinion of the majority of their subjects• That the majority of His i £)ccellency's subjects are Baharinah# His Majesty's Goveniment have learnt from me with pleasure the better treatment which these people have had under the enlightened rule of His Excellency, ani have noted with satisfaction the wise concessions which His i ^xcellency has granted the Baharinah in the matter, for instance, of larger representation on the lunicipal Councils aud on the Majlis al Tujjarah, and in the preliminary' seep of setting up a Committee to codiiy the Notices which have from time to time been issued by the Bahrain Government. It may be, however, that further steps (perhaps of an economic nature) will be necessary to meet the legitimate aspirations of the Baharinah* His Majesty's Government are content to leave the details of these steps to His Excellency who will doubtless take advantage of my advice# They wish, however, to bring the following general considerations to the notice of His Excellency. Should the legitimate asjairations of the Baharinah not be flilfilied, (an eventuality which His Majesty's Government naturally dn not anticipate), and saould trouble occur, His Excellency can hardly look to His l^kjesty's Government, who as His Excellency is aware are about to give self-government to India, for syn5&gt;athy. Should however His Excellency meet the reasonable claims of the Baharinah, (and 'they have asked me to report on the matter from time to time), and should the Baharinah in spite of this continue to give trouble then His Excellency i£iay rest assured that His Majesty's Government will approve of any reasonable measures which he may find necessary in order to uphold his V : • ' ■ , ' . • - ■ ■ •_ ' - , , , - .. , , &gt; - , .: i ; \ t ■ - administration* 17. I think a frank homily on the above lines (which I have drawn up in consultation with Colonel Loch) will have a good effect. Shaikh Sir Hamad bin 'Isa Al Khalifah himself is a kindly / k \ ■ fA viHBH i ll'ii in kindly and tolerant man, while the most capable ana influential member of his family - his brother Shaikh Abdullah - is quite shrewd enough f so I gather from what 1 have seen of him, to appreciate the fact that 'it is better to march with the times than to be dragged along in the procession'• IS# It will be observed that the general lines of my suggested message to Shaikh Sir Hamad follow, what I understand to be, (to compare a very small problem to a very large one), those which the Government of India have adopted aa their policy of recent years in India: on the one hand to meet legitimate demands for self-govemment and on the other to suppress factitious ana dangerous agitation. In this connection I approve of the reply given by Colonel Loch to the Buharinah leaders in paragraph 11 (c) of his letter of 18th February which I note (from paragraph 12 of the same letter) had an excellent effect# 19# I should be glad to be informed at an early date whether the Government of India approve in general of ray views, and in particular of the contents of paragraph 16# I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, efc 'A - Lieut# -Colonel* Political Resident in the Persian Gulf# Copy forwarded to Political Agent, Bahrain, under P.L, No. C/44, dated 18th March 1955,Co nfidept' No:C/207.

The assumption of such a responsibility would not accord, at any rate in present conditions, with the general policy of His Majesty's Governnent and the Government of India vis-a-Jis the Arab principalities in the Gulf, and for this reason the Government of India would prefer that any representations which it may be necessary to make to the Shaikh should be on much narrower lines than those proposed in paragraph 16 of your letter, more particularly as that letter and Colonel Loch's letter, forming an enclosure thereto, make it clear that the Baharinah, escept possibly as regards their grievance relating to the free pasturage of the Shaikh's camels, are now better treated than formerly, 2. It remains to examine the specific grievances relating to the working of the administration in Bahrain. ia) R efom s of the Bahrain Courts. It appears from Colonel Loch's letter that the complaints of injustice arise immediately from the conduct of certain cases by Shaikh Salman in the absence on leave of his Go-Judge, the Adviser to the Bahrain Government. To such miscarriage of justice theJV -2- the Government of India consider that strong exception might' well be taken in conversations with the Shaikh. These incidents show that the ruling family still have much to learn in the matter of judicial probity. But for this very reason they would be reluctant to concur in the suggestion that the presence of a European State Official on the Bahrain Gourt should be dispensed with. The local inhabitants hs.ve become accustomed to the present procedure and it offers a definite guarantee of justice. They admit that the addition of this duty to the multifarious duties of the Adviser must result in over-work to Mr. Belgrave, but they would suggest that the solution lies not in any suggestion to remove him from the Gourt but to provide him once more with an Assistant. They have observed that your proposal for a slight increase in the emoluments of this post was combined with a recommenda tion that the suggestion for the appointment of an Assistant Adviser should be dropped. They think, however, that the matter requires some re-examination in view of the growth of oil, air and naval interests in Bahrain, coupled with the inadvisability in their view of removing Mr. Belgrave from the Bahrain Uourt, and will be glad to receive your further observations on this point. The proposal for the collation of past proclamations is obviously sound, but they would suggest that the introduction of a Civil Gode may present unnecessary complications for a simple community, whose commercial relations with foreigners are already dealt with by the Agency Courts, As regards the Criminal Code they agree that the introduction of a simple code, founded on the Indian Penal Gode, such as the Sudan Penal Gode, has much to commend it* (b) P roportional representation on the Municipal Council s of Manama and Muharraa. and on the Mailis-al-Tuiiarah . The Government of India agree generally with the action taken by Shaikh in this matter. (c) Education. In this matter the Government of India /f* observe that the representations of the Baharinah deputation seem to have been entirely confined to serving the interests of a schoolmaster whom the leaders wished to instal in a city school. The Bahrinah are mainly a rural community, and the Governments l G-ovemment of India agree in Golonel Loch's conclusions that too little attention has hitherto been paid to village and primary schools. They would suggest that it should be possible to expand these institutions on a wide basis without great expense by offering encouragement to private or mosque schools already in existence in the villages. (d-) F ree Pasturage . The complaint that the camels of the A1 Khalifah are permitted free pasturage among the crops of Bahnrinah is of long standing, and they think that pressure should be brought to bear on the Shaikh to abolish this practice. 3. To sum up, the Government of India feel that no representations should be addressed to the Shaikh suggesting the introduction of popular institutions of a democratic nature, or carrying the implication that the support of Government to the ruling family will depend on the degree in which the Ruler meets the aspirations of the Baharinah (as only one class of the inhabitants of Bahrain) for the introduction of popular or self-governing institutions. Such homily as may be necessary should be directed to the importance of ensuring that substantial justice is done in the Courts and that genuine grievances, such as that relating to the pasturage of the camels, are removed.

There are no suitable candidates locally and, as the two present QacLhis are both from Easa, it is undesirable that there siioula be a thirci from that area. It would be most unsuitable from the political point of view to employ a Persian. Even if obtainable, a ^adhi from Egypt or Syria would no doubt be expensive and, unless the Bahrain Government chanced on an exceptional man, he would probably find it difficult to accustom himself to conditions in Bahrain. On the whole, though I should prefer a suitable local man if he existed, I see little objection to the proposal, provided that the terms of his employment (which should, I think, contain a definite period of tenure, with possible extensions for good service) are appropriate. 3. I understand that Shaikh ? Abdullah bin f Isa ■ &gt; | (brother of the Ruler; knows personages in T Iraq. through whom a suitable man could be obtained. In the past the otner Qaanis have been got by similar informal meansfrom Easa and I think that it would be sound for us to agree to this method of recruitment aSj althougia foreigners are affected by the persons employea as . t aanis, the cases referred to the ^aoiiis by our Courts are usually Muhammadan domestic cases. In such circumstances I should prefer to regard tne appointment of ^adhis as an internal matter and for responsibility for the men appointed to rest primarily upon tne Ruler. I would, however, arrange that a reference should be made to me before an individual is finally selected, lest some obviously undesirable individual be brought to Bahrain. 4. As the proposal is of some importance, I siiould be grateful if you would inform me whether you see any objection to it.

I am replying demi-officially as L can only give an outline of the matter at present. 2. Owing to Hamadhan and the absence of Shaikh f Abdullah bin 'Isa (whose help is advisable) on the mainland, I have had to delay talking the matter over with the Shaikh. 5. The position at present is that there are two fudges sitting together in the Lower Bahrain Court, and three Judges (sitting together) on the Sunni and two (now sitting together) on the Shi'ah Shara* Courts. Arrangements are being made to get a third Judge for the Shi 1 ah Shara T Court (see the corres pondence ending with your telegram No;1025 dated the 19th 4. Belgrave has for some time left as much of the Upper Court work as possible to the second Judge (Shaikh Salman bin Hamad till he went on leave, and now Shaikh 'Abdullah bin Hamad), but the fact that he is so much absent from the Court is the subject of some local comment. I propose, as soon as Shaikh 'Abdullah bin 'Isa returns, to try to get his support for the proposals discussed with you on the 22nd November 1955 (a) that there should be (in addition to the Adviser) two Judges on the Upper Court who would settle the lesser cases, but would sit with the Adviser on important cases, (b) that the Adviser and December 1935). /Court arable atenant-Colonel T.C.Fowle, C .B .E«, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.Court in consultation should decide whether a case was to be deemed important for this purpose, and (c) that appeals from the Lower Bahrain Court would be heard by the full Upper Court (including the Adviser)• 5. I have taken advantage of the holidays to discuss with Belgrave the question (of which the Court work forms part) of freeing him for important advisory and supervising work, which will increase rapidly as money becomes available from the oil royalties. 6. While we appreciate that it is most desirable to employ the Ruling Family as far as possible, we agree that it would be well nigh impossible to employ any one of them as an Assistant to the Adviser owing to their lack of education or experience. On the other hand we think that certain of them might well be trained to take over specific posts in the administration, 7. Beigrave himself is much in favour of a British Officer as an Assistant to him, to whom he could delegate in particular, some of his supervising work. We are also considering the possibility of having an Assistant of the type of a Registrar or Fxtra Assistant Commissioner, an experienced man of (what we call) gazetted status, who would be responsible for the adminis tration of the Adviser's office and for the proper checking and putting up of schemes, especially from the financial point of view, but would have no executive powers unless directed by the Adviser to do some specific task. There are a number of important considerations affecting this question and I should like, if I may, to discuss them with you on your forthcoming tour. 8. In the meantime I enclose a table showing roughly how Belgrave and I visualise the distribution of work in the Bahrain /GovernmentI K 3.

I reminded His Excellency of what had passed, as reported in ipy letters No: C/112 dated the 18th Febrdary 1935 and'C/160 dated the 6th March 1935, and recalled in particular the principal grievances of the Baharinah, that is to say , in regard to the Oanun (Code of Laws), representation on the Baladiyahs (Municipalities) of Manamah and l&amp;iharraq, the lack of schools and the uncontrolled grazing of his camels. I informed His Excellency that you had reported the matter to tne Government and that I had now received their reply. I said that they were happy to hear that the 'Alans (notices containing orders) of the Bahrain Government -were being collected and that His Excellency had himself granted, before the trouble, further representation of the Baharinah on the Baladiyahs. I said that I had explained /to theI V, | ! f ; 1 &amp; 9 to the Government His Excellency's intention, that as soon as money was forthcoming the number of schools in the villages should be increased and I am glad to say that His Excellency informed me (I had heard it before from the Adviser) that a start had been made by opening a school in Bitrah. I would cdo that His Excellency observed with a chuckle that in fact the people of Sitrah seemed more keenly interested in fish than in education! I then opened the distasteful subject of the uncon trolled grazing of His Excellency's camels and said that the Government had noticed this grievance of the Baharinah with concern, and especially so because it was this type of grievance, small in itself, which bred serious trouble for the rulers of countries. I pointed ny talk by telling His Excellency of the revolt in La Vendee which was largely due to just such grievances of a peasant people. I said that I should like to be able to reassure you and Government. His Excellency showed much less feeling than usual on the subject, which frankly annoys him, and said that the camel- men were now all Baharinah. His Excellency also pointed out that people should fence off their cultivation along the roads with 'saf (palm fronds), which was cheap and easily done and exclaiEied that in future if damage was reported that for one rupee's damage he would give two, and for five rupees ten. He added that he would give orders for one camelman always to go behind a herd to see that the animals did not stray into gardens. I know that, just after the recent trouble. His Excellency dismissed the wild Hasawis whom he had hitherto employed and I have recently been told by cjuite independent persons that the depredations of the camels have diminished of late. YJhile I am fully aware that the camel question cannot be regarded as finally settled, yet even this improvement is satis factory. As arranged during your last tour, I propose to follow /upup ny conversation with a letter after I have had an opportunity of speaking to you next week, 4, I would add that Shaikh 'Abdullah bin f Isa has just- returned from the mainland and I will consult him about the question of improving the Bahrain Courts in certain respects, 5* In this connection I understand that the collection of *Alans is finished and that some of the Baharinah are about to interview the Adviser on the subject of the Code. I have warned the Adviser informally that Government consider that a Civil Code would be likely to present unnecessary complications in the circumstances which obtain in Bahrain (especially as commercial relations with foreigners are already dealt with in the Agency Court s).

Sir, t I have the honour to refer the fourth and sixth paragraphs of your Memorandum No :C/2S dated the SSnd January 13?6 regarding the Bahrain Court, ^, On the l^th February 1936 I took an opportunity of discussing with His Fxcellency Shailrh Snr Hamad bin Isc. A1 Khalifah in the presence of Shaikh T Abdullah bin ' Is a ana the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, the question of relieving the Adviser from his heavy work on the Bahrain Court. I told the Shaikh of our discussion on the subject during your recent visit and that you would have spoken to him on trie suigect, hdd it not been for His late ?.fe.iesty ? s death. I then explained tnat the Bahrain Government were in a fortunate position of expecting a considerable revenue from oil and that there would no doubt be many plans for the betterment of the administration, v ¥hich had been impossible when there was no money available, and that it was desirable that the Adviser, T^hose primary duty was the supervision of the finances of the State, should be free to devote more of his time to that object. I told the Shaikh, that the most promising field in which the Adviser's present labours /could r&gt;; 7 v' P.. could be lightened seemed to lie in his work on the Courts, which took much time and was largely of so straight-forward s nature that it could 'be done 'by others. I put forward for his consider- ation, and was well supported by Shaikh ! Abduliah and the Adviser, the suggestion that a second Judge of the A1 Khalifah shoulc be appointed to the Court and that the Adviser should confine his work on the Court to cases in which there might be special- reasons for his attendance• I did not specifically mention tnc..t it was proposed that the Adviser should sit on the Court when dealing with appeals from the Lower Court, as to d clouded the issue, but that can easily be arranged now that the general principle has been accepted. His Excellency appreciated the value of the suggestion and agreed to it in principle, only stressing that the Adviser's help shoulc 1 be aveilable to the Co'rt in difficult cases. Shaikh 'Abdullah suggested that the ■ms...&lt;,v1-.cvvtrms ,r.ini r --'i-i'■'■ ' arrangement should be tried for one year to see hov it worVed &lt; ^ ,-waw akT^ntioned that I thoucht that an allowance should be fixed to the second Judge. I asked the Shaikh to discuss v;ith Shaikh 'Abdullah and the Adviser the question (a sorrewhat thorn:, problem) of who should be appointed. 5, I will inform you in due course of the result ox their discussion.

Subjects Remedies for the grievances of Baharinah in Bahrain. ^ / &gt; Sir, f 1 I have the honour to refer to your letter Ko•F.230-N/ 35, dated the 6th November 1935, and to reply ©s follows. 2. Reforms in the Ba hrain Courts . (Paragraph 2 (a) of your letter under reference). The Grovernment of India suggested the t with the object of retaining Mr, Belgrave on the Bahrain Court, he should, be given an Assistant to help him to carry out his other duties, and asked for nay opinion on this point. In view of the general considerations advanced at the end of paragraph 8 of my letter &gt;T 0. C 4 ^ of 18th March 19oo, i.e. that it should be our policy in Bahrain (as it is now else where throughout our possessions and protectorates; not to administer for the Bahrain Government, but to teach and induce them to administer for themselves, I am not in lavour of this proposal - at all events at present. 10 add a tiiird British Officer to the Bahrain Administration (in addition to the Adviser and the Customs Director) would naturally mean that the Bahrain Government instead of doing more for themselves would do less. Moreover the various problems connected with Bahrain administration need the personal attention of Mr. Belgrave // -• -%?. 7 -2- Bel grave and not that of an Assistant. rhe addition 01 an Assistant would cost the State an appreciable sum in salary, and would doubtless not be generally popular. If, however, objections in spite of these ^ I find that in the future such an appointment is necessary I shall not fail to reconunend it# 3, In the meantine after discussions with Colonel Loch, Mr. Belgrave, and His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifah, (in the course of which the Ruler's brother, ShaiKh ♦Abdulleh, was most helpful, as he bas been on past occasions)^ I have devised the following re-organization which h&amp;s been agreed to by His Excellency. (1) On the Lower Court (see paragraph 7 of iny letter quoted above) there are at present two Judges, who try all cases together. No change will be raade ^n this Court. (2) On the Upper (Sessions) Court, besides Mr.Belgrave, there is only one Judge. An Additional Judge will be posted to this Court and all ordinary cases will be tried by these two Judges. (3) Ur. Belgrave will sit with these two Judges to try more important cases, (4) Whether any particular case comes within this category will be decided by the two Judges and Mr. Belgrave in consultation. (5) Appeals from the Lower Court will be tried by the full Upper Court - including Mr. ^ el grave. (6) The Ruler, as at present, will remain the final Court of Appeal. The advantages of having an Additional Judge on the /11 / •» 3'- the Upper Court are - to put the matter frankly - that two judges are more difficult to bribe, and to influence unduly, than one, and they will thus serve as a check on one another. 4^ vith regard to the collation oi pagt proclamati ona • This work is now reaching completion, and when the proclnmatiofi have been properly sifted and classified the result may well constitute in itself, with perhaps some additions, a s -mple Code, Civil and Criminal, sufficient for the needs of Bahrain. This Code will be printed and issued in a cheap form by the Bahrain Government, and all concerned, the Courts and the public, will know exactly where they stand, which they are far from doing at present. -.'his Code will have the advantage of being based on customary Bahrain law, as contain ed in the proclamations, and will therefore not be considered as an innovation by the Bahrain public. With regard, to the introduction of a regular Civil Code, I entirely concur with the lovernment of Indie that it ia unnecessary, vide paragraph 10 of my letter quoted above. 5 # With reference to the Majlis al Tujjarah and the Bhia 1 Shara 1 Court (vide paragraphs 12 dnd 13 of my letter already quoted). On the former no change is contemplated. On the latter the Baharinah have now persuaded their Kazis to sit together and His }rjccellency has concurred. 6. Representation on Municipal Councils . (Paragraph 2 (b) of your letter). I note that the Oovernment of Indie, approve generally of the action which has been taken on this matt er• 7, Jgduca ti on . (Paragraph 2 (c) of your letter.® A start has /1« 1 -4- has been made by the Bahrain Government in extending education by opening a school at the village of Sitra, though when ,3: informing Colonel Loch of this His Excellency remarked that he thought the people of Bitra (which is on the sea) were more i nt er es t ed in f ish t han edu cati on. Free Pasturage . (Paragraph 2 (d) of your letter). In view of the instructions of the Government of India I addressed no general homily to the ohaikh, but Colonel ijoc-ii on my behalf approached His Excellency on the subject of the depredations done to the crops of the Baharinah by the carnels of the Al Khalifah. Colonel Loch pointed out tactfully that it was this kind of grievance that roused feeling out of a-i-1 P- opor— t i on to the damage actually done, and that he would iiKe to be able to assure the Government of India and myself that this practice would cease. His Excellency, who took Jolonex xjoch s observations in good part, replied that he had dismissed the Has saw is whom, he formerly employed, that cue cornel— men vere now all Bahar i ^ah, and that in future, If claims were put in for d ^rrage, for every rupee claimed he would give two. It is hsrdly necessary to ssy thst this last statement need not be taken at all literally, but Colonel Loch informs me that the depredations of the camels have diminished of late. If any further complaints are made the Shaikh will ha^ e to oe approaclir ed once more* 9 o To sum up , I venture to think that the arrangements now made meet in a practical manner both the wishes of the Government of India and the needs of the situation. kr.Belgrave will rercain on the Upper Court, but as he will only deal with important cases, and in an Appellate capacity, he will have far /-5- far more time to give to the questions 01 oil, air, and naval interests in Bahrain, to vrhich. the Government of India have referred, and/the supervision of the Police, which is — - —- - y&amp;w now In his charge (paragraph 8 of my letter already quoted), rhe i ^aharinah will iiai'e more chance of fair dealing by the re-organizati on of the Upper Court, and at the same time the Bahrain Government will be given a reasonably free nand in the administration of Justice. The 'Baharinah and the public in general will benefit by the compilation of a simple judicir:,! Code accessible to all. A beginning has been made in the direction of more general education outside the towns of Manamah and Muharraq, and the irritation caused by the depredations of the Al Khalifah's camels has been - partially at any rate - removed. 1 have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, vie -if Political Resident in x ^ , A/ - ^ Lieut.-Colonel, the Persian Gulf.N ijleut-Colonel, Political Agent, Bahrain.

No. C/666-1.V5 Dated the 27th October 1938. | r nEBip-^cvj r . | Dc?ro. ? « I v.^.^ ,u„.* i,; t l_ In my telegram No. 160 dated the 13th October 1938 I indicated that there was some recrudescence of agitation in Bahrain and promised a report. I arn afraid that this report has been delayed owing to my preoccupation with Dubai affairs and with the question of the Bahrain Unallotted Area. 2. So far we are only at the beginning of agitation, * and at present it is being directed mainly against the Bahrain Courts (in particular the Shia Shera Court), and , at the Education Policy of the State. As usual the Manama b section of the Baharana are particularly active, led by Mohsin and Mohammad Ali A1 Tajir, Said bin Sayid Khalaf, Abdu Ali Alewat, Mansur al Areyeth, Sayid Ahmad Alawi, and most dangerous of all, the ex Shia Qadhi Shaikh Abdullah. The Arabs {or Sunnis) chiefly implicated are Ali bin Abdullah \ Abul of Muharraq, Ibrahim bin Jodr of Muharraq, Said bin Ali Shamlan, ModaacKDiad bin Khalifah al Fadhal and Mohammad al Fadhal, Khalil Moyad, and some of the Kanoos. Most of these latter have personal grievances, including the supreme grievance of having at one time or another been detected in some particularly disgraceful villainy. 3. Although it would be wrong to suggest that there is any immediate danger of the agitation becoming so violent that it might involve revolutionary changes in the form of/- The Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowle, K.C .I .E., C.B.E., Politics! Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. U . t\*~-of administration in Bahrain, still there has been some talk of demanding the creation of a Legislative Council, and there are rather more predisposing factors towards the growth of agitation than I care to see. These can 'be noted briefly as follows; (i) The possible (at one time it seemed probable) opening of the succession to the Shaikhdom in the near future. (ii) The examples of Kuwait and Dubai. (iii) Trade depression. (iv) The failure of the pearl industry. (v) Dissatisfaction with the Law Courts. (vi) In particular the scandal of the Shia Shera Court. (vii) Dissatisfaction with the progress of education; and to a less extent with the Police. (viii) The perennial complaints of 'British Colonisation' and the excessive employrnent of foreigners by the Bahrain Petroleuir Company. I propose to discuss these points separately. (i) The question of the succession has of course been of interest to certain members of the community for some years, and I understand that about five years ago it was being actively discussed in Manamah. Later people lost interest in it but with His Highness 1 pilgrimage and his recent illness, interest has revived greatly. In itself the question of succession does not provide a cause for agitation for I am convinced that the likely competitors are far too intelligent deliberately to organise parties themselves; but clearly it provides a convenient facade for agitation, for the staging of demonstrations and so on; and of course party leaders must always expect that if their nominee is successful they will be able to exercise control over him. Indeed rumours have been put about that Shaikh/-I -? /' loi -3- Shaikh Salman bin Hamad has 'been associated with the meetings of the agitators, though Belgrave is convinced, and T agree with him, that this is not true. There is nothing we can do about this, for Sir Hamad will never, I fear, nominate his successor except possibly on his death-bed: end we must rely on family cohesion to prevent the question of the succession being exploited by the agitators. (ii) Information in Bahrain in regard to what has happened in Kuwait is astonishingly inaccurate, and there was ® belief that His Majesty^ Government had deliberately elevated the Council there in order to destroy the power of the Shaikh.^ ^ A* to?* It v/as for this reason that I asked you to let me know tele graphically the latest developments in the situation of Kuwait and I told the Shaikh and his family the whole story. They v/ere extremely interested and I hope that as the story spreads it will do much to remove any suspicion that a 'Reform Party' might expect support from us. I have less anxiety about Dubai since Bahrain is in much closer contact with Dubai and receives less garbled version of what occurs there. Nevertheless, the fact that reforms of a sort have been introduced both in Kuwait and in Duoai must obviously provide agitators with useful material on which to base demands for constitutional 'reforms' here in Bahrain, however different conditions may be here, and however much may have been done to promote the welfare of the people, (iii) and (iv). The bazaar is, I am afraid, by no means as prosperous as it was. Clearly worxd conditions must affect prosperity here and the critical situation in Europe in the late summer had its full effect in Bahrain. Simulta neously the buying capacity of the personnel of the Bahrain Petroleum Company has declined. Europeans and Americans have/-wo) I si have decreased in nuiLbers by 90 in the last year or so, Asiatic foreigners 'by over 250, and subjects of Bahrain by 1700. Everyone of course knew that as construction was completed large numbers of employees would be laid off, but the fore-knowledge that t his was coming does not make the depression any the more tolerable. Reduced employment in the Oil Camp, like the failing pearl industry, hits the towns most, though it is not altogether without effect also on the villages, which after all must sell- their produce in the towns. It follows therefore that careful consideration must be given to the question of providing employment for the town Arabs since it is axiomatic that unemployment end loss of trade among the smaller shop keepers must provide fertile ground for the growth of agitation. As it happens, there will during the winter be employment for numbers of people on the extension of the Customs Pier and the building of the Muharraq sea road, and in due course there will be further employment for a certain amount of unskilled labour when the causeway between the two islands is completed and the bridge constructed. But to my mind the Bahrain Government should look for some thing more permanent. I confess it is not easy to suggest anything, and at the moment I can only think of the establish ment of a button factory. I know this has been thought of and talked of mn the past, but I think it might be followed un more effectively now. There is quite a trade in mother- of-pearl being exported mainly to Germany, and I should have thought that something could be done in the way of a Govern- ment—subsidised factory in Bahrain without the State running any danger of serious loss. For the villages I feel that the objective might be collective farming, though nothing much can happen till we get the Agricultural Advisees report (which is already months overdue). If this is to be made a ^ , f;J p- ' ( ' { , 4 ' success/- LjZin m -5- .1 ■; success His Highness, and possibly other members of the A1 Khalifah family, must provide land for cultivation (preferably for market gardening); the State must arrange for irrigation, and probably for seeds and marketing; and the most careful arrangements must be made for a fair i share-out of the profits♦ This is scarcely the place to discuss such a proposal in detail, but I think that much might be done in this direction, (v) The Bahrain Courts, I fear, provide a reasonable cause for complaint. The Senior Court consisted of Shaikh Rashid bin Mohammad and Shaikh Abdullah bin Hamad. The latter has, as you know, been away in England, end in view of the promise that be shows T consider it to be of the utmost importance that he should be reappointed to the Court. Shaikh Rashid is practically useless, but seems to be tolerated because of his age and very extensive knowledge of human weaknesses- Neither of these seems to be a parti cularly solid qualification for a senior member of the Judiciary, and the sooner he goes the better it will be. Although there have been suggestions ffom various quarters that Eelgrave should again sit with the Senior Court, I would not personally recommend this, since in the first place he has no time for this work and in the second the Court should as far as possible be staffed with local talent The Lower Court consists at the moment Ox Shaikh Mohammad bin Ali al Khalifah, Shaikh Ali bin Khalifah bin D a t ij and Shaikh Da 1 ij bin Hamad, who are totally untrained and against whom objection is taken on the score that they are too young, uneducated and inexperienced. These complaints are entirely justified. I see many advantages in manning the Magistracy from the Al Khalifah family, buo in my opinion/-Ita 110 -6- opinion we should advise the Shaikh that no member of the family should be appointed to any of the Courts unless he h8S had some training outside Bahrain, This of course is not too simple. India is useless as a training ground owing to language difficulties; we cannot consider * Iraq where the courts are so corrupt; end the choice must be between Egypt and the Sudan, Cf these the latter would be preferable, but it is a long way from Bahrain. Incidentally I might mention that I have had to suspend the Junior Joint Court as Shaikh Ali bin Mohammad (son of Shaikh Mohammad bin ^Isa), the Bahrain representative, was involved in a parti cularly disgraceful drunken brawl a fortnight ago. I am inclined to think that the Bahrain Government would be well advised to try to find a retired Arab magistrate of good repute from Palestine or Egypt (in the latter case one who has served in the Sudan), to inculcate some ideas of procedure while Bahrain 'hopefuls' are being trained. (vi) The Shia Shera Court is at present the main focal point for agitation. As you know it has for some time been a public scandal and we have recently aided the Bahrain Government in obtaining the services of a new Qadhi from Najaf, by name Shaikh Abdul Eusain A1 Halli. Though both Belgrave and I like the new Qadhi very much I agree with Belgrave that it would be taking too much 'of a risk to appoint him as sole Shia Qadhi. I gather that the present idea is to remove Shaikh Ali bin Jaffar, who is rather a dangerous individual, from the Court, to retain Shaikh Ali bin Hasan who is very old but might be harmless if Ali bin Jaffar 1 s influence were removed, together with Shaikh Baqr al Asfar who has hitherto constituted the minority of one in the divergent rulings given by the Court., and to appoint oneA\\5 Ml n ' (' one more local man. The new Najaf Qadhi v/ould then constitute a sort of a Court of Appeal from their decisions. Simulta neously the clerk of the Court, a thorough scoundrel, is to 'be replaced by a Sunni clerk. Obviously this does not * at once remove all possible cause for complaint but the proposal has many advantages and might well be tried out. If it fails then some other experiment must be made. It must of course be realised that Shaikh Ali bin Jaffar will not go without a struggle and that his dismissal will be followed by a certain amount of agitation on his behalf* Also it will be necessary to try to wean Shaikh Baqr from the influence of the villainous ex Qadhi Shaikh Abdullah, and that again will not be too simple. (Personally I should like to see Shaikh Abdullah exiled). All this, however, must be faced since there is unfortunately no short cut to real efficiency, honesty and public satisfaction. (vii) As for Education, I think some people have regretful memories of the profitable (and disgraceful) days of the Bahrain Educational Committee, while others are besotted with the Eastern idea of creating a machine to turn out unlimited numbers of half—baked graduates. The main trouble however is that Shaikh Abdullah bin ! Isa, who has of course no real qualifications for the post of Education Member, does not take sufficient interest in it and practically evervthing is left to the Syrian Inspector ox ochools. This man is, I believe, quite competent, but he is conceited, holds aloof from Manamah and Muharraq society and takes little trouble to disguise his contempt for it. Belgrave finds it difficult to interfere too much in Shaikh Abdullah bin 1 Isa 1 s department, but there is little doubt that it is mainly due to him that it runs at all, and it is interesting to/--8- to note that the numbers of boys at the Manamah school for instance continues to increase,, I should think that sooner or later the Syrian Inspector will have to go; but once again the great difficulty is to find someone to replace him and it is quite likely that efforts will be made to prevent the post being filled at all if he does go* When some change is made I would recommend that it should include an arrangement for State inspection of and control over private schools. My own view is that Bahrain should aim at more or less universal primary education, continued and possibly extended technical education, and limited higher education to provide for the 'intake' needs of the Govern ment itself and of commercial houses. One great difficulty is to kill the belief that any youth who has acquired a little education is ipso facto too accomplished a person to undertake manual labour. It is interesting to note that the experience of the Bahrain Petroleum Company is that it gets far better results in training coolies for semi-skilled work than it does with ex school-boys. I imagine that other countries have had similar difficulties and it would be very interesting, if it were possible, to obtain information on the methods that they have adopted to prevent education interfering with the labour market. Some sort of propaganda in schools in regard to the 'dignity of labour' is obviously required and any assistance which we could provide in this respect would be extremely valuable. I am bound to admit however that I do not know how we set about getting it. As for the Police, there have been one or two cases lately in which complaints have been made that respectable people have been arrested without cause, but I should antici pate that with Belgrave 1 s return things will be better. To my/-7 fn -9- my mind the Police Force requires strengthening, and of course the sooner Belgrave can get an assistant to help in training and running the Force the better it will 'be. This brings me to the next point• (viii) The complaints of colonisation are of course hardy perennials in the Arab press♦ The immediate importance is that although His Highness and the Shaikhs have agreed in principle that Belgrave must have an assistant, and - f ix p* f(re appear to b e satisfied that Byard will be a suitable choice, Shaikh Abdullah enquired from Belgrave a few days ago whether he really thought that the present was an advisable moment to appoint another Englishman* Admittedly if Byard is appointed in the near future there will be a recrudescence of the colonisation outcry in the press, but the advantages to be gained by the appointment so greatly outv/eigh the disadvantage of providing fuel for press agi tation that I think we should advise the A1 Khalifah to go ahead. If I could see any alternative I should, I think, be more cautious in suggesting this course, but we have been over the ground so many times and everyone is satisfied that there is no reasonable alternative likely to be efficient As for the complaint of excessive employment of foreigners by the Bahrain Petroleum Company I think it is mainly due to misapprehension. People still do nou fully realise that children born of Persian parents in Bahrain are Bahrain subjects, and continue to regard them as xoreign— ers. Meanwhile the Company is getting rid of foreign Asiatic employees as fast as possible, and I am satisfied that they are making a genuine effort to comply with the Bahrain Government's wishes in this matter• 4, A new phenonp.enon m this agitation was the posting in Manamah, Muharraq and Kedd of manuscript notices, the translation/-\\t? nu- -10- translation of which is as follows:- 'Congratulation to you, 0' Noble Public. The oppression will now be waived. You have heard from your leaders and speakers what has proved to you that the oppression v is almost over.. Be ready and await further order.' Shaikh Hamad was at first extremely angry about this, but afterwards had the extraordinary idea of publishing an 'Alan saying that if any person had any complaint to make he should go direct to him. Shaikh Hamad. Shaikh Mohammad was furious at this suggestion and wanted to publish an exactly contrary 'Alan prohibiting the exhibition of notices. Shaikh Abdullah took the more sensible point of view that these notices could be ignored. Their main interest is that they disclose the existence of a party which is deter mined to promote agitation in the State, and if they continue it will soon become necessary to consider what action should be taken against their authors, who are at present unknown but will, I feel sure, soon be detected. 6, To sum up. My own view is that it is urgently neces sary to remove causes for agitation by a 'clean up' of the Bahrain Courts and in particular of the Shia Shera Court. Schemes to provide employment, mainly for the towns and also for the villages, should be examined and put into effect as soon as possible. Some change in the education system, is required, but this is an intricate subject reauiring more qualified advice than I myself can give* Committee fervour might be appeased by the early appointment of a Public'' Health (rather than an Education) Committee. And finally, since it is already evident that there will be new difficulties to face in the next year or two, making heavy demands on Belgrave's time, I think we should press for/-H? IIS -11- for the immediate appointment of Byard as his assistant. T have now been told by Belgrave that Hamood bin Sub ail, one of A1 Khalifah family, is mixed up with this agitation. You may recollect his name, since he was convicted some years ago of organising attacks on Baharana villages. He has always been hostile to us and to the Bahrain Government.

EDUCATION They want that the present Inspector of Education and the schoolmasters to be replaced by some better teachers as the Inspector and schoolmasters are not efficient and since the appointment of the present inspector about 9 5 years ago, not a single boy who passed the 5 5 examination and left the school has been aole 5 . . 5 to work even as a junior clerk. 2.

They say that all of them are ignorant of law, have no judicial experience and even some of them are illiterate. In all their judgments which they have Passed in the cases brought before ohem they have always simply said 'The Court deemed it necessary' to give such and such order, with out giving any grounds for delivering such an order. Moreover the hearing and disposal of cases are delayed for considerable time and some/- iDo 3/ Not true Nonsense A wild accusation He is a very good fellow, if a bit shy in procedure Ye; some of case records are lost by lapse of time and carelessness. On many occasions the people have been ordered to file fresh suits and pay court fees again. 3. POL ICS DHiPAHTl^NT First of all there is no head for this Department. There is no discipline and every policeman considers himself as the Head of the Department. Mr. Narayan (Adviser's Secretary), Muhammad Khalil, Superintendent, Land Department, Mr. Jalaluddin, Passport Officer and others interfere in the affairs of the Police Department whenever they like. Innocent people are kept in custody by the Police Department before they are produced in the Court unless they pay something to them. Prohibited drugs such as opium, when discovered by the policemen, would not be taken to the Court concerned but sold by them for their own benefits. They are very rude in their deal ings and insult the people without any cause in order to exact money from them. The present Police Prosecutor for Bahrain Court cases is a Persian, opium smoker who is almost illiterate and cannot speak Arabic properly. 4. 3HARA COURTS The Sunni Shara Court requires reorganisa tion. The settlement of cases are considerably delayed . The Qadhis are to be ordered to submit a quarterly report on the working of their Court to an official who should be appointed by the Council. The present Shia'h Qadhis are not wanted by the people. They intend to elect their Qadhis themselves• 41 ; ' ' ' i jm a ; ' '1 ll 11 r [ ll| | 9 A m ; .its--3- \\(] Nonsense s'ii'i ' Absurd 5, BAPCO Skilled and unskilled labourers are paid at the rate** of annas 10/- per day when they are first engaged* Then the Company raises the pay of skilled labourers up to 'Rs. 3/- per day after a long service. Wh£n they reach this stage, the Company intentionally finds some fault with those labourers who receive Hs. 3/- per day and dismisses them from service. As there is no work in Bahrain the said labourers who have been dismissed are obliged to go to the Company for employment and by the Company if they are given employment/they will have to start on a pay of annas 10/- a day. If the Com pany do not dismiss the skilled labourers they fine them for a slight fait for at least 5 days* i wages and sometimesfjeat them. The labourers been have/warned that their pay will be reduced next month. The Bahrain Government do not listen to the complaints of the labourers when they approach them and tell them to go and settle with the Company. The Company are accustomed to bring in efficient Indian labourers who receive Hs. 5/~ or more a day and order other local labourers who receive nch more than Re. 1/- and Rs. 1/8 a day tc teach such Indian labourers their work which they have to do. 6. MIMIC IPALITY The present Secretary of the Municipality is absolutely a useless and inefficient man. The clerks who have been engaged by him in the . uni- cipality office are all bad character boys and the tax collectors are pimps. It is said that one/-hey have been on ostile terms for , long time. I aspect the latter s responsible for lost of this stuff. -4- one of the tax-collectors is distilling Araq for him in the Municipality Garden. The Muni cipality materials are used for the repairs and building the houses of his boys. The Muni cipality car is always used by him for his pri vate affairs and the cost of petrol consumed is charged to the Baladiyeh. For example, a contract was given to a certain man for filling up half of the pond situated behind the Mission Hospital for Hs. 3000/-, whereas for the other half, which the Secretary undertook to fill up, charged Hs. 11000/- and the work has not Jset been completed. It is said that before the de parture of the Adviser on leave to England a 5 5 disoute arose between the Secretary and the 5 5 Cashier of the Municipality. The latter re ported to the Adviser and told him that he could prove the amounts which have been embezzle; by the Secretary who, as soon as he heard about the Cashier's complaint,went to Mr. Narayan, Adviser's Secretary, who helped him in getting the matter dropped. Mr. Narayan supports the Secretary in every respect. Every year a certain amount of money is allotted in the Budget for expenditure but the Secretary always exceeds the allotment and the accounts are not checked by the Accounts Committee who pass every item of expenditure without scrutiny.. The Secretary shows privately all the official correspondence of the Municipality to Ahmad Fakhroo and takes his advice on which he acts. All materials required by the Municipality are purchase^/--5- There is certainly iot enough ice for sale, but the rest is pure exaggeration, Impertinence Some of those who used to make 'big profits out of H .H 1 s property do. Mostly Persian inspiration here. purchased by the Secretary from Ahmad Fakhroo. It is believed that the Municipality will go bankrupt if the present Secretary holds his post longer. During the hot season the people could not get sufficient ice because the Sec retary was taking two blocks of ice everyday to his house for his own use (apparently free of cost). Besides that he was supplying free ?lce to his staff and special friends in large quantities which were above their requirements. The people want this Secretary be dismissed. 7. FACTOR TO HIS HIGHNESS Sardar Abdur Rahman Khan has been brought to look after the property of His Highness. H© receives a high pay of Rs. 500/- a month plus free house, car, etc., whereas a local man can arrange the affairs at a very low pay. The people want that Sardar Abdur Rahman should be replaced by a local man. 8. PASSPORT DEPARTMENT This Department is in a state of confu sion. No one can leave this place without paying something to the passport officials. For instance, if anyone wants to go to Qatif, he will not be given a pass for return unless he pays something other than the usual fees. When certain individuals were arrested for entering Bahrain without passports, a great number of them were released after payment of money to the Passport Officials who had origi nally allowed them to enter Bahrain without passports. The present Passport Officer has got his own rules and acts in a manner to suit his/-nu) Nonsense As the Department has some Hs, 16000/- outstanding in bills consumers have very little right to complain. The Customs Depart ment is very well run. Absurd Is he to be a sort of super- nakhuda? his own purposes. The people want that the Passport Department should be reorganised •j and tneir work inspected by an inspector who will be appointed by the Councils 9. EL3GTRIC DEPAHTMEIJT This Department is run jointly by the Municipality sind the Electric Department. Every year the Municipality has to lose a certain amount and when the details of the accounts are callel for they are not furnished hy the State Sn^lneer. The Klectric Det)artRient do not pay attention to the requests of the people when they ask them to put their lights right and thus keep them without lights for a number of nights. 1.0 • CUSTOMS DEPARTlvIBrr The Hindu employees of the Customs are harassing the people. The luggages of Hindu passengers arriving in Bahrain are not inspected i r. 1 1 but a local man 1 s luggage has to remain for at least 2 days in the Customs after which they handle the luggage in such a manner which causes damage and losses to his things. The Customs Officials and naturs are very rude and treat the people in a rough manner. The Hindu employees receive much higher pay than those which the few local men who are engaged there are getting although the work which both of them do is the same. 11. PORT OFFICER The Director of Customs is also a Port Officer but he does not know anything about navigation. The people want that another man who is fit to hold such a post should be ' '.»l| appointed. 19/ - k I /)-7- The very people against whom they coniolain.

Every high official of the Bahrain Government makes use of the pri soners. For instance Mr. Narayan takes the pri soners to his house to clean his latrines, bath room and car every day. Similarly K.S. Mohammad Khalil of Land Department, Mr. Jalaluddin, Pass port Officer, and others make use of the prisoners Some of the well-to-do prisoners pay money to the Babu (clerk) of the Fort and the Hawaldars in charge of the prisoners and consequently are not made to work at all* They are allowed to eatthe food which is brought to them from their houses and get a fair treatment and spend an easy ^nd comfortable life. 15.

Report Reference my yesterday's report. The object of the persons who moved the question of reforms is to form a Council of Administration like that of Kuwait consisting of 10 members - 5 Bahranis and 5 Araba Besides the Council, they want to form a Committee t) whom all the orders passed by the Council are sent for confirmation. The Head of this Committee will be Shaikh Abdullah bin ' Isa who has also been earmarked for heir-apparentship. The people do not want Shaikh Salman to be an heir-apparent though Yusuf Fakhroo is trying to get the people on his side. Shaikh Hamad will remain as before as the Ruler of Bahrain. My informant told me that they also do not want Mr. Belgrave to remain any longer in Bahrain but if the Political Agent insists that he should remain, they have no objection on condition that he should be a 'Financial Adviser' and his duties to be limited to keeping and checking the accounts of Bapco and at the same ! time be under the Council. But if the Political Agent agrees that Mr. Belgrave should leave Bahrain and does not appoint another man in his place as a Financial Adviser and entrusts the Council with the financial affairs they are prepared to undertake the work and submit the accounts to the Political Agent for inspection. oOo— \\ Secret BUSH IRE RESIDENCY .

There are the following developments to report this week. 2. Early in the week Shaikh Abdullah bin 'Isa and Belgrave came to see me and to talk over the situation. Shaikh Abdullah said that they wanted to put an end to this agitation quickly and that he recognised that there were one or two items in the Administration that needed refom. He thought that if these were put right there would remain no justifiable cause for further agitation. He asked me for my views and I told him that I had reported the whole situation to you so that I could not say anything officially to him at the present moment; but purely unoffiical- ly I thought that something must be done pretty quickly about the Courts. With this he agreed and said that arrange ments had already been made for the reform of the Shia Shera Court, but what was to be done about the Bahrain Court? I asked him if he thought that His Hig hness would agree to send some of the younger A1 Khalifah to Egypt / /VX/VN #1 &gt; i«I or elsewhere for training and he said that he did jnot think so. After some discussion we came to the conclusion that the best solution would be to get two retired magistrates or other well-qualified and reputable 'men of law' (probably from Egypt), one of whom would, with the aid of a Committee, firish off the work of codifying law in Bahrain, while the I.I .-ini w'wwwiwiww other/- i Hobble Lieutenant-Colonel n n v&gt; Sir Trenchard Fowle. t-C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gull, Bushire.-2- other would undertake the training of A1 Khallfah magistrates, sitting In Court with them and generally showing them how things should be done. I heard afterwards that Shaikh Abdullah had made this suggestion to His Highness who approves strongly and instructed Bel grav e to set about finding two men I did not discuss any other administrative details with Shaikh Abdullah but. spoke merely of the desirability of removing any genuine cause for complaint before it could be used effectively for the purpose of agitation. I was particularly pleased to hear afterwards that His Highness has adopted this as the main basis of future policy. Before leaving Shaikh Abdullah requested that I would, not as Political Agent but as a friend of the family, always tell them if I saw anything wrong with the Administration and would suggest means of improvement. 3. No time has been wasted in reorganising the Shia Shera Court. Shaikh All bin Jafar has been dismissed and also the disreputable Court Clerk. Shaikh Baqr, Shaikh All bin Hasan and a new man Shaikh Mohammad A1 Kari have been appointed to the reformed Shera Court 6n nine months 1 probation, and Shaikh Abdul Husain al Halli has been appointed as a kind of Appellate Qadhi. I attach to this letter a copy of the Notice issued by the Bahrain Government on this subject. This action by the Bahrain Government seems to have been received favourably by the Shias in general, though some people are upset, probably because they hoped to become Qadhis themselves or are annoyed with the Government for having found a compromise which satis fies most people and deprives the agitators of a cause for complaint. 4. On Thursday a deputation of the leading Bahama sa w Belgrave, and it is interesting to note that they never once mentioned the Shia Court. They complained about the Bahrain Court/-3- i%) Court and said that it was entirely wrong that all the judges should be appointed from the A1 Khalifah family whether they had any qualifications or not. They admitted however that they knew of no one else at present better qualified for the Courtsj and on the whole they talked quite reasonably. They also had something to say about the Baladiyahs and Education^ but Belgrave says that their main concern seemd to be to increase Bahama rep resentation and that they complained that there were too many Arabs in the Baladiyahs and that the Arabs or Sunnis were balpg favoured in the schools.. Belgrave told them that HiTs Highness was considering plans for the Courts; while as for the Baladiyahs the Shias had their members and it was up to them to speak up in the meetings and put before the committee any grievances that the Shia communities in the towns might have. He promised also that a general survey would be made of the State Education system. Not once during the whole meeting which lasted for two hours did they so much as mention a Council. 5. There is of course unending talk all through Manamah and Muharraq and the most astonishing stories go around. Ramadhan is of course a bad month for this sort of thing, but at the present moment there is nothing in particular to worry about. There may be a strike of Bahraini clerks, motor drivers and so on at the Oil Camp, but I am not sure about this yet. x he possibility of .joint agitation by Shias and 'Arabs* 1 seems to be receding. His Highness is at the moment extremely angry with some of the latter, and has ideas of exiling at least one of them to Hawarl Yours sincerely,12/ o. 26/1357. GOVERNMENT OF B^HRaIK. NOTICE.

I think it would have been better in the first place if you could have ausimarised the subject into one report instead of three. Secondly, in none of your reports do you make any reference to the previous correspondence on the same subject of which there was a good deal some years ago. I referred to this correspond- .r, ftu ence in paragraph 3 of my telegrem No.T/298, dated the 14th October 1938. The last letter on the subject is my letter No. sn 160-3, dated the 22nd February 1936, to.the Government of India, f.il copy sent to you under my Printed letter Ho. 161-3, dated the 22nd February 1936. You devote a good deal of space to the personalities connected directly or indirectly with the agitation. These personalities however convey little to me and I do not think we are so much concerned with personalities as with the broad outline of the agitation in generale 3. With regard to the reform in the Law Courts. tfhat is far more important than any particular personality is the drawing up of a Bahrain Code (collation of past proclamations). I note that in paragraph 2 of your report of the 5th Kovember ) i&gt;* ! - (■ you / H. Veightman Jsquire, 1.0.3., Political Agent, Bahrain.-2- you mention this code without ho^ev.er referring to the laat occasion on which it waa taken up, i.e. paragraph 4 of my letter of 22nd February 1936 quoted above# tfith regard to the views of the Oovernment of India on this collation of past proclamations as well as a Criminal Code, please see paragraph 2 (a) of Govern ment of India letter No.y.230-N/35 f dated the 6th November 1935, copy sent to you under my Printed letter ^o.882-3» dated the 16th November 1935. Do you thinK a Criminal Code is necessary or will the collation of past proclamations be sufficient, or can this question not be answered until we see what this collation will bring forth ? In any case there would seem to be no need for a Oivil code. The collation of past proclamations, which for sake of convenience can be referred to in future correspondence as the Bahrain Code, should of course have been finished long ago. I do not know why the Bahrain Governraent have not completed it. It should now be finished as soon as possible. 4. The previous agitation was carried on almost entirely by /ft &amp;o the Baharinah (see paragraphs 2-4 of my letter No.C/43, dated the 18th March 1935, to the Oovernment of India&gt; copy sent to you /f- z1 under ray Printed letter No.C/44, dated the 18th March 1935. Is it still only the Baharinah who are agitating or have the 'Arabs' 1 Joined in with them generally? I note that the Committee mention- U.ul P i ed in paragraph 1 of Report dated the 26th October 1938, received with your letter of 29th October 1^38, is composed of Arabs as well as Baharinah. &amp;• With reference to paragraph 8 of my letter of 22nd February 1936. Have there been any further depredations on the crops of the Baharinah by the camels of the Al Khalifah ? This is exactly the kind of grievance, as Loch pointed out to the Shaikh at the time /3- tiffle# wiiicii at'oubes reeling out of all proportion to the da&amp;age actually done. 6. pleas® resubmit a brief auiaraary of the situation as it now stands with the previous correspondence on the subject as a basis, excluding peraonalitxea as far as possible, and specifying the concrete grievances for which the agitation demands redress, giving your opinion as to the validity of these grievances and iy/iat steps you uhink should be ta^en to redress them or wh&amp;t steps the 'Bahrain Government have already ta^en. #ith this summary before me and your previous reports I shall be able to draw up a eummarised picture for the information of the India Office and the Government of India. 7, m here is however one point on which I can give an opinion Btrai^hu avay i« e* 'tlie employment of 'Bayard -» vide paragraph 3 - \\2&gt; — —- (viii) of your letter of 27th October 1938, I entirely concur with you that we should advise the Al Khalifah to employ him^^^2 As you will see from previous correspondence - vide paragraph 2 of my latter of 22nd February 1936 - that while the India Office and the Government of India were in favour of an Assistant for 3elgrave I was not at that time. In view however of present conditions in Bahrain and the volume of work: and responsibility thro/n on Belgrave I am now definitely in favour of it. With an Aasiatant he would be able to get free of the details with #hich he is at present encumbered and turn to wider issues, auch as guiding the Reforme, which are no^ so necessary in Bahrain,Confidential D.O. No. C/691-l.b/5 Dated the 12th November 1938. cw Isy Subject:- Agitation in Bahrain There have been quite considerable developments during in the last week in the agitation going on in Bahrain. 2, His Highness the Shaikh was much upset by various —'' —• yx****** imwwil offensive remarks passed about him personally by some of the Arab agitators, and on Saturday he instructed Belgrave to arrest a number of them. This was done and on Sunday morning there was a partial strike in the Bahrain Petroleum Company* s offices and in the Field, the leaders being the transport drivers, the gangers and the 'office boys r, (i.e» the youthful semi-intelligentsia). There was a certain amount of picketing on the road from Manamah with the % result that Field coolies were turned back, but the picketers were arrested and the coolies immediately began to trickle back to work- Shortly afterwards a crowd of young men assembled in the Juma 1 Mosque and demanded to see me. As they were all Bahrain subjects I naturally refused and they went into the bazaar where they made themselves objectionable and frightened the shopkeepers who immediately closed their shops. A body of Police was taken into the bazaar to disperse the crowd and a few people received injuries during a charge. ■ i; !,&lt; t &lt; li i :M| 1 /.ji i i 1 '¥ ■ L i ;| The main ring-leader was a man named Ali bin Khalifah al Fadhal who escaped but gave himself up the same night. Meanwhile strenuous efforts were made to induce the Bahama to join in demonstrations/- aourable Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowle, K. C. I. E., C. B. E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. i if i . Jl c-2- demonstrations and an attempt was also made to fetch in the divers from Muharraq. Both these attempts were un- successful. There was some alarm in the bazaar but on my suggestion Belgrave issued a notice promising the public protection from interference by crowds of irresponsible persons and later the bazaar reopened. The arrests on Saturday had, I believe, disorganised strike and demonstration plans under preparation. 2. On Monday Belgrave saw the leaders of the Bahama who undertook to keep the Bahama quiet. Most of the Bahrain Petroleum Company's coolies returned to work and some of the office boys also • The bazaar was shut again as the result of a stupid rumour but quickly reopened. And finally a small crowd of boys assembled in the road outside the Agency, and was dispersed by Shaikh Abdullah bin Hamad ■',,■ ■■rinninriin.iiiMBiwiiii' and his servants, who happened to be passing. Belgrave and I saw the managers of the Bahrain Petroleum Company who afterwards issued a general notice that men who failed to return to work by Wednesday morning would be liable to dismissal or 'such action as seemed necessary 1 *. 4. On Tuesday the Bahrain Petroleum Company was practical ly up to full strength and there was a quiet day in Manamah. Wednesday was also quiet but on Wednesday night more notices were stuck up in various parts of Manamah and Muharraq demand ing the release of the persons who have been arrested, order ing a strike of the Bahrain Petroleum Company^ employees, the boycott of the cinema, and threatening that those who opposed the 'Society of Free Youth' would endanger themselves. Today I received two communications by post from 'A1 Shabab al Umnah' of which I enclose copies. 5. I must emphasize that the Bahama of the towns and villages have taken no share in this overt agitation. Their leaders/-3- Ilk leaders have seen Belgrave on frequent, occasions) they appear to be pleased with the overhaul of the Shia Shera Court, and generally they hdve behaved quite reasonably so far* They have some rather Utopian ideas which I gather are to be sub mitted on paper, but it should not be difficult to prevent any recrudescence of Baharna agitation* With the town Arabs on the other hand, the difficulty is that everything is so intangible. One cannot ascertain specific grievances, they have no leaders except for the irresponsible agitators who have been put under re£traint, and in fact this is an irrational Youth Movement exploited by semi-criminal persons for their own ends. Foreigners in general have held aloof, and so far the divers and the cooly classes in the towns have not res ponded to the Young Men's Appeals. But these latter classes are scarcely noted for stability and the wild stories that go around must have an unsteadying effect5 for even people of the better class seem to believe every absurd rumour they hear. 6. One of the most dangerous rumours which has gained wide belief owing perhaps to past history in Bahrain and distorted stories of happenings in Kuwait, is that the agitators will have the support of the Agency. Though I have consistently refused to hold any communication with any Bahrain subject interested in this agitation, I learn that even quite sensible people have been led to believe that the British Government always sympathise with so-called 'reformers' and that conse quently the Political Agent must support this ridiculous Youth Movement. This is a serious matter, for I fear it helps to keep the idea of forcible agitation alive. Were there any acknowledged leaders amongst the town Arabs I would request permission/-permission to send for them to disabuse them of this idea, but in their absence 1 can only suggest a widely published noticea I realise 'that, 'there are objections 'to such a course, but since it is essential to eradicate this mis conception and since there is not the least doubt that His Highness and his Government are genuinely prepared to do their best to remove any reasonable grievance and can therefore fairly claim our sympathy and aid, I propose a notice on the following lines:- lf It has come to my notice that certain ill-disposed persons have spread rumours to the effect that the British Government, through the Political Agency in Bahrain, intend to support agitation against Hia Highness the Shaikh and the Bahrain Government. These rumours are entirely false. The British Government are fully aware of the efforts which His Highness and his Government have made and are continuing to make for the improvement of the conditions of all classes in Bahrain, and the public should understand they will in no circumstances afford support to un lawful agitation organised by irresponsible persons. ,, 7. If this is done, and if the Bahrain Government strengthen their Police Force (as they should) to control unlawful agitation, the right atmosphere ought to be created for the examination of reasonable demands. As one example, the suggestion has now been made that a Bahrain Government „ , „ —**-—-IDWIlHtf ^ un ■'VAC W- ^yil||ll^|lN«^|pilllllWllil iji' i &gt;' ■'W representative should be accredited to the Bahrain Petroleum Company, to explain and interpret the ideas and views of ' ' ' ■''' —- * — - ■ — —- - employers and employees to one another. We all see much advantage in this, if the right man can be found, but such n /5- I UO) /3? an appointment could certainly not be made under the threat of agitation and strikes. 8. Might I have telegraphic instructions in regard to paragraph 6? Yours sincerely, '^\ssyi\y l/ ~ t/ ^Translation SM /5f To H. B. M's Political Agent, Bahrain. After Compliments. We, the Bahrain Jiouths, beg to submit these our demands amending what we have already submitted, with a firm hope that all these demands will be fulfilled through you. The whole nation has been experiencing various sorts of chaos in the Courts, corruption in the education and schools and mishandling of ^L1 the resources? a state of affairs which has made them impatient. They are appealing to you and demanding their rights and you represent the justice of Britain in our country. The (British) Govern ment have, since a long time, been looking after us and we have appreciated - and wilj do so in future - their favours in protecting and defending this nation. Our demands are as follows:- 1. Release of all the native prisoners who w ere arrested — without committing saiy act of disturbing the peace and order. 2. Formation of a Council for the Education Department —- which is to prepare schemes for education and supervise their management. This question is now of great importance as it has caused dissens^ion between the nation and the Government. 3. Formation of a Council for judicial affairs to be ^ composed of natives. This Council is to undertake the task of inacting a code on which the local Courts are to act as our present 'Courts are an example of chaos which is a disgrace to the prestige of a nation protected by the greatest organized Government in the world. 4. These two Councils are to be composed of natives select- ed by the nation. 6. Administration of justice in the case of the labourers and establishment of a Committee for them. Enquiries are to be made from, and negotiations in respect of these demands, with the leaders of the nation who are under arrest.IlpO ~2~ i . We are deeply sorry for the insult and highhandedness [ of the Police to us during our calm demonstration without any justifying reason* We hope that these reasonable demands will b e ful filled as an aa:t of equity towards this oppressed nation, lest they may indulge in activities which may lead to bad consequences should the authorities refuse to grant them their proper rights. We have a firm hope in your justice and equity.

The Government of the native country dealt v. ith the youths who claimed thsir reasonable rights very severely in suppressing and exterminating them* We have the honour to s et forth before you the chief reasons which led to this pitiable state of affairs. As you are aware the Government arrested Sa'ad —.nwn—■ Shamlan and Ahmad Chirawi without any obvious reason and kept them in prison♦ When the news of this incident was spread a general resentment w^s felt in the national quart ers in respect of the national cause which concerns only organization of the internal affairs of the country. When those two persons were arrested a strike was made which is known to you and we, the young men conducted a peaceful d emonstration as a result of which we were beaten very severely by the Police and many of our injured com panions were taken to the prison by the Government. In view of these acts 9 the conditbn became critical and we decided yesterday morning to come and see you and to report to you our grievances. We gathered in front of the Agency but the Government sent one of their responsible men with a number of bedotiins who teat us and made us disperse. We therefore submit this our protest against the action of the Government and have the honour to set forth our demands to yourequesting the justice of the British to intervene between us and those authorised tm in solving the problem:- 1. Release of those who have been arrested in — the present events; 2, Issue of a general amnesty in respect of all those — who took part in this peaceful movement Now we are satisfied with these two demands as after the release of the prisoners by the Government their/-\ U-U -2- their leaders and others willte in a position to negotiate with you in respect of the national demands which we hope will receive your attention and will be solved by you. - Al Shabab al Watani -19/169 • Telegram O a# jtotii To Political Resident, Bushire Political Agent, Bahrain, NOo 358.

It might urge them to more activity in future if yew were to give tnem this opinion from me, only more politely expressed, verbally and unofficially, 6, It seems to me that the whole essence of the agitation is that the people of Bahrain of all elements have no le&amp;al means of putting forward their grievances, whether real or imaginary, and are therefore reduced to illegal channels such as agitation. In the old patriarchal days every Bahrain subject could approach the Shaikh at hia morning Majlis and put his grievances before him. This is the traditional Arab and democratic way of settling affairs, and Shaikh Hamad's idea of publishing an alan tnat any person with a complaint could come direct to him - the Shaikh - vide paragraph 4 of your letter Ho,G/666-l,b/o, dated the 27th October 19SB - was in my opinion by no means so extraordinary as you tnink, thougn doubtless it was put forward at the wrong time. As the administration in Bahrain has become inevitably more complex, personal touch between /between the Huler and his subjects ha* beoame more difficult - an unf ortunate piienoiaenon wiiicn is not con! ined to S&amp;lax&amp;izi# (In India for instance the District Officer owing to an increase ©f paper worac finds it difficult to maintain the sane personal toucb with the people of hia district as did hi® predecessors of oldO 7. The obvious remedy appears to me an Advisory Council to be set up b^ the Shaikh, and, subject to y ou nave to say on the subject, I propose giving this advice to Shaikh Ha/aad and the ^Bahrain government. (Ihether I gave this advice from itself or from His Majesty's Government I shall have to decide later.) I gave exactly the saiie advice to two other Shaikhs - Kuwait and Debal. Th^y did not taKe it and the consequence is that both of them have now been forcibly saddled with executive Oouncils. In other words, instead of the Shai&amp;h sitting on the Councilt the Council sits on the ..&gt;n.aisn • exactly the same thin^ will happen in Bahrain in my opinion sooner or later unless my suggestion is put into force. i^he popular movement« though not vary at rem n at the aaomentj, sill no doubt grow in power and be Joined by other elements who have hitherto held aloof, i.e. the laharanah, divers, coolies, r foreigners, etc. 8. It would of course hare been better if the Bahrain Governiaent had exercised reasonable foresight and instituted some such council before the present agitation, but it is now a case of better late than never. The advantage of such a Council in clearing the a*r, meeting the legitimate grievances of the popular party, and giving the latter some of the hard experience and responsibility of self-government, seems to me /'(/I mm mo clear# tn®r # haTin^ made this large eoucessior*, #3t4ioh vrill give a Xe^al focus for exyreeaion of grievauces, the Saiai'ain aovernmeiit will be in a stronger po ait ion to deal firmly with t.iose who emplaiy illegal meam*# 9. the essence of the Oounoll would be that the members would ce nominateu by the Shaikh.

The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. ^ i (33 in,-; • 10; ■ -j, r* - iiiif,« ^h:, ; J. ,, ill I Vide 18th 22nd Sir, I have the honour to submit the following report on the occurrence of agitation in Bahrain. 2. I must state, at the outset, that this agitation is almost exclusively urban and that, though certain fea tures of the administration which provided cause for the Bahama agitation of 1934-35 have again excited criticism, your letters No. G/443 dated the f the origin and nature of March 1935 and 160-S dated the 5 February 1936. n • from that of 1934. It has so far been distinguished by the virtual absence of specific public grievances and by the disproportionate influence of personal motives. 3 # The contributory causes can be described briefly as follows (i) A Youth Movement Increased educational facilities in recent years have produced a class of young men with a veneer of education who respond readily to press propaganda, listen to broadcasts and develop political feelings. They believe themselves to beA u i the present agitation are 1 of vastly different characterI '{I be progressive and despise their illiterate parents who, since the youths are earning quite good wages, have lost all influence over thenu They are nationalistic, especially since they see foreigners earning more money than they them selves do* They know that they are better educated than the ruling family and are inclined therefor® to despise them. They come mainly from Manamah and Muharraq, and most of them work with the Oil Company, in Government offices and with firms in Manamah. (ii) Examples of Kuwait and Dubai Recent happenings in Kuwait, invariably misinterpreted, and to a lesser extent in Dubai, have suggested to certain people in Bahrain that the time is ripe for the people to take over control of the Government and particularly of the treasury. The memory of the end of Shaikh 1 Isa 1 s rule lends support for the almost universal belief that the popular movements in Kuwait and Dubai were encouraged and supported by the British Government and that similar support will be forthcoming for ♦'reforms* 1 in Bahrain. Extravagant descriptions of sudden vast benefits to the public of Kuwait and Dubai resulting from the transfer of control from the Shaikh to the Council have been widely circulated and believed. (iii) Economic Unemployment has increased owing to a reduction in the labour force employed by the Oil Company, while at the same time the divers have fared badly owing to a poor pearl season. This causes dullness in the local markets and shop keepers are by no means as prosperous as they were. The centre of wealth has passed from the one time powerful merchants to the A1 Khalifah family, bankrupt merchants are aggrieved because they cannot obtain large loans from the Government, and/-fS-U ! -3- and lavish and wasteful expenditure by some of the ruling family arouses resentment. (iv) Nationalism Nationalistic tendencies have come late to Bahrain, but find ready acceptance by the semi-educated young men, and to a lesser extent by some of the older people• The young men complain that they do not earn wages comparable with those of foreign Asiatic employees of the Oil Company, and they believe, quite inaccurately, that their services are at least as valuable as those of Indians and others with infinitely better technical qualifications. By an inverted process of reasoning the blame becomes attached to the Education Department of the State, for boys leaving school in Bahrain do not obtain as highly paid posts as their parents expect. It is unfortunately necessary to employ a number of Syrians in the Education Department (in the absence of qualified Bahrainis) and naturally much of the blame goes to them; and this is followed by efforts to foster hostility towards all other foreign employees of the Government. 4. Unfortunately the restlessness thus affecting a small section of the community has coincided with a genuine public complaint in regard to the Bahrain Courts and the Shia Shera Court. In regard to the former complaint has been made with justice that the magistrates, all of whom are of the ruling family, are ignorant, incapable and un educated, in most cases much too young, lacking in experience, open to influence by the Court Clerk, and slow in settling cases; and though there are now no allegations of preferential treatment to one or the other section of the public, there has undoubtedly been a lack of uniformity in the decisions of/-ot the Courts. It was, however, the disgraceful condition ot ^he Shia Shera Court which provided opportunity for agitation to crystallise. It had long; been recognised by the Bahrain Government that this Court must be over hauled, but there was unavoidable delay in reorganisation. The leaders of the Manamah town Bahama in ventilating the legitimate complaints of the Shias in respect of the Court took the opportunity to raise vague demands on various other matters such as education and the increased representation of the Shias on Municipal Councils and in the employment of the Government. Certain Arab Sunnis of the towns, well- known to be ill-disposed towards the Government, associated themselves with the Bahama leaders and produced other com plaints. Both the alleged grievances and personal motives however were so divergent that inevitably there was a split between the Sunnis and the Shias, and the reform of the Shia Court which was effected in October resulted in the Bahama withdrawing. The Arab malcontents, having failed to obtain open support from leading notables, turned their attention to the young men and led them in a somewhat violent agitation against both the Government and the Oil Company. 5* The arrest of some of the Arab leaders led to a premature strike in the Oil Company^ premises and to a demonstration by about 500 youths in Manamah. The latter was controlled without difficulty, a few more arrests were made, and the strike proved abortive. Attempts to enlist the aid of the Muharraq divers and the lower class Bahama failed, and conditions outwardly returned to normal. The young men, however, are still obsessed with their revolutionary ideas, hostile notices continue to be exhibited, and though the public is generally apathetic there is always the danger n l^ir e. U l f ii i : i that/-irt -5- that the ceaseless stream of distorted rumour and complaint may unsettle the people• The Bahrain Government have therefore been axious to obtain a statement of genuine grievances and proposals from representative people of position and a memorandum, of which a copy is attached, has now been presented to the Adviser. Of the signatories three are leaders of the Manamah Town Bahama, one is an ex Persian Sunni (who now wishes to withdraw his signature) and one an Arab (who disclaims any concern with the contents of the memorandum) • It is, therefore, far from representing a general demand for reforms, but it serves as a basis for discussion. It is particularly to be observed that even now specific grievances are not mentioned. 6, His Highness* preliminary views on the various items in this memorandum have been communicated to me as follows:- (i) Education His Highness approves of an Advisory Committee on Education provided that the Committee should not control expenditure or have authority to appoint or dismiss the staff. Their duty would be to suggest new lines of edu cation and perhaps to v isit the schools and submit sugges tions to the Government. If possible an official from the Ministry of Education, Baghdad, should be asked to visit Bahrain and report to the Government on the schools* administration. Comment ;- In my opinion His Highness 1 ideas go as far as is reasonable and necessary. (ii) Courts His Highness regards these demands as being entirely unconstitutional. All magistrates should be appointed by the Government and not elected (though this does not of course apply to the Majlis al Tujara which is an Advisory Court). He strongly resents the proposal that all the pre sent magistrates should be summarily dismissed, but ih I H M i iff sTl -6- acknowledges that they need instruction. He proposes to complete the work of composing a Code of Laws for Bahrain and I enclose a copy of a letter which I have received from him asking assistance in obtaining expert aid for the two purposes mentioned. Comment ;- His Highness is undoubtedly right in rejecting a demand for a partially elected judiciary. In the circumstances of Bahrain there are great advantages in selecting the magistrates from the A1 Khalifah family, but they undoubtedly need instruction. The completion of the Bahrain Code, which is in effect a collection of Standing Rules and Orders, is of vital importance, but it must, in my opinion, be supplemented by simple Criminal and Civil Codes. I gather that the Bahrain Government themselves hold this view, for it is recognised that ignorance of elementary principles of procedure has led to conflicting decisions in similar cases and has been one of the main causes of complaint by the public. Expert aid is unquestionably required for the preparation of these Codes and I suggest that an attempt be made to obtain the temporaey services of two retired magistrates or Judges from Egypt or the Sudan, one of whom will devote his time to this task while the other gives practical instruction to the A1 Khalifah magistrates both in and outside the Courts. (iii) Baladivah His Highness considers that the matters complained of should be dealt with by the Municipal Councils themselves. Comment ;- With this view I agree; I may add that there are few foreigners permanently employed by the Municipalities. (iv) Labour Committee His Highness wishes to appoint one person as a Bahrain Government representative with the Bahrain Petroleum Company to act as a go-between in discussions between the Company and/ .-7- and Bahrain subjects working there. He is not prepared to accept the suggestion that a committee should be elected or appointed for this duty or to interfere in Labour questions elsewhere. Comment :- The suggestion for the appointment of a committee is clearly full of danger, whereas the proposal for a Govem©ent representative with the Company is one which I have already reported to you, and to which you have given approval in your telegram No. 368 dated the 16th November 1938. (v) His Highness sees no need for any committee to mediate between his Government and the public. He considers that such a committee would merely embarrass the Government and give rise t o disturbances; and he points out that there are already various local bodies, partly elected, to represent i| various sections of the public, e.g. Municipal Councils, Waqf Council and Minor Estate Council. Comment :- I entirely agree with His Highness r views. I detect here an attempt to inaugurate a Council to displace the existing Government. It represents no public demand, and is purely an expression of personal ambitions. 7. His Highness has requested me to discuss these views an d proposals with him and his brothers, and I would solicit early instructions. I see no immediate need for other action, beyond the strengthening of the security forces (and His Highness has already decided to add one hundred i 1 men to the Police) in order to deal with possible factitious agitation. I anticipate that efforts will be made to arouse dissatisfaction in the Bahrain Petroleum Company's labour force, but I propose to report on this at a later date. I consider that in due course it will be advisable to organise some sort of Bahrain Government propaganda to dissipate ignorance/—8— ignorance and misunderstanding, but that also requires fuller consideration.

After Compliments. We have the honour to submit this letter in connec tion with the demands which we request the Bahrain Govern ment to grant as we believe that these will give rest to the Government and satisfacfion to her subjects:• 1. Education. To form a committee of eight members, four Sunnis and four Shias: this committee to supervise education, arrange curriculum of studies for the schools, employ headmasters and teachers from outside and send students abroad. 2* Courts * To improve the courts by changing the present magistrates and to form a bench of three judges, two from the public, viz., one Sunni and one Shia and the third one to be according to the choice of the Govern ment, for each court. To form a special criminal court of one judge only employed from Iraq. He should have good reputation and should be employed temporarily until such time as a Bahrain subject will be able to take his place. 3. Municipalities. To improve the municipalities by appointing Bahrain subjects in municipal employments in place of foreigners. 4. Labour Committee. To form a labour committee acknow ledged officially by the Government to look after the affairs of Bahrain labourers whether they are employed by companies or any others and to protect their rights. 6. To avoid any unintentional misunderstanding in future between the Government and the people we request the selection of six persons, three Sunnis and three Shias to represent the people.

Dated 19th Ramadhan 136712th November 1938 from Bahrain^ Shaikh of Bahrain to the Political Agent, Greetings. As you are aware there has recently been some complaint about the administration of justice in our law courts. This matter has been discussed between you and our brother Shaikh Abdulla and our Adviser and the possibility of obtaining an expert on law from abroad to assist us for a short time has been talked about. We have now decided that we require one or two capable and experienced judges to be lent to our Govern ment for a stated period, perhaps a year, who will assist in the work of composing a code of laws for Bahrain and who will at the same time give instructions to the members of our family who sit on the Courts. We think that it is essential that these persons should be Arabic speaking so we suggest that it might be possible to find one or two suitable men in Egypt or the Sudan who could be lent by their Governments to Bahrain for a stated period. We should be grateful if the British Government could assist us in this matter.

There is no common platform for the Town and ohe ^ountr^, for the Sunnis and the Shias or for any section of either of/- Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowle, K.C.I.S., C.B.S., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire..1 -2- of them, for the young and the old, for the seml-educ^ted and the uneducated. Apart from the matter of the Courts there are no specific public grievances; and practically it comes to this that the Bahrain Government have had to use the Manamah Town Bahama leaders to elicit a statement of demands; this in spi^e of the fact that the Bahama dis satisfaction with the Shia Court has been met and the Bahama, save for the politically minded 'townees', are satisfied. 4. There are of course all sorts of so-called grievances aired by individuals but they are based solely on self- interest and personal motives and do not represent public feeling, I have not therefore troubled you with a detailed list of them. 5. With regard to the Bahrain Code. Work on this ceased owing to the apathy of the members of the Committee, but even when it is completed as it should soon be, it will be no more than a colledtion of Rules and Orders. I am quite convinced that something in the way of a brief Penal Code and brief Criminal and Civil Procedure Codes is absolutely essential. I think it is true to say that the people want this, and the Bahrain Government are quite prepared for it. Simplicity must of course be the key-note and I see no reason why it should not be attained.

AS I indicated in that telegram I am in communication witn teigntman and will gubiait a full report later. In the meantime however tnere is an immediate step to be taken - vide paragraph 3 below* 2. The present agitation though it differs in some respects from th%t of 1935 (vide correspondence ending witn my letter So.ieo-S, dated the 22nd February 1936, to tne aovernment of India) has some of the same objects in view i#e. tne publication of a Bahrain code, and improvement in the administration of Justice in the Bahrain Courts. In this respect tne Bahrain Government are in my opinion much to be blamed. Thougn tney accepted in 1935 my suggestion for a collection of past proclamations (i.e. alans ) issued by the Banrain Government, on which a Bahrain Code could be based, and actually set up a Gomraittee for this purpose, tne collection still remains uncompleted, further, in spite of the reforms suggested by me and approved by tne Government of India which the Bahrain Government instituted in tneir Courts at tnat time tney have again allowed inefficiency and corruption to prevail, particul- ^rly in the Shia Shera Court.

The Youth Movement, of which advantage was taken by self-seeking malcontents, is very far from popular. And I k O to exemplify how little even the memorandum, of which I sent you a copy with my official report, represents real public opinion, I enclose a copy of a petition now received tjy His Highness from all the leading Arabs of Hedd. I understand a similar petition is being signed in Manamah Island. I regard this petition as particularly significant for I know it is purely spontaneous. 4. May I put in here a plea on behalf of the Bahrain Government? Admittedly the Bahrain Code has been unduly delayed/- honourable Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowle, K.C.I.E., C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. &lt;?|e* - i . vMdelayedj but we inus't remejiiber tJiatr 'tiie Conani't'tee dealing with it was largely composed of the reputed representatives of important sections of the c&lt;H!imunity and it was those rep resentatives who lost interest and absented 'themselves from meetings. Of course they ought to have been replaced, but I hold that the Bahrain Government are far from being solely to blame. As for the Courts, you will recollect that the Bahrain Government began their search for a really reliable Shia Qadhi years ago. I would % invite a reference in parti cular to this Agency lefte^ No. *511-G/6.V.O. dated the 19th September 1937. Their efforts (and ours) were finally successful just before Belgrave went on leave. To attempt to reorganise in his absence was to court failure, and since his leave coincided with the diving season the court was closed until his return. Then reorganisation was effected inside a month. In regard to the Bahrain Court, there have been no allegations of corruption, only of inefficiency. From frequent comments I have heard in the past few days, I think there would have been little complaint if Belgrave had been able to sit constantly with the Senior Court. But we all agreed that that was impassible and I fear that the possible results were not fully appreciated. 5. I am afraid I must also contest the statement that the public of Bahrain have no legal means of putting forward grievances. His Highness sits in Majlis daily, and he is accessible to everyone and all sorts and conditions of people go to him with their petty affairs. Similarly Shaikhs Mohammad, Abdullah and Salman constantly hold public Majlises, and Belgrave is himself fully accessible to all classes of the community. (My comment on the Shaikhs proposed ^lan was/--3- was due to this very fact. The public would have been puzzled by so utterly unnecessary a proclamation, and in searching for motives might well have assumed it indicated an intention to destroy the whole fabric of the existing Administration.) Finally there are the Municipal Councils, which do not by any means restrict their discussions to matters of pure Municipal administration. The very fact that, apart from the question of the Courts, no one would take advantage of the many recognised methods of airing complaints indicates to my mind not only the absence of genuine complaint and of a genuine popular movement, but also that the agitators themselves realised the insincerity and perversity of their case. They could not afford to come into the open; their obvious line was misrepresentation and false rumour designed to whip up the revolutionary fervour of youth, and to affect the judgment of the ignorant. They knew as well as we do how gullible and credulous the people of Bahrain can be, and they hoped to profit by it. Hence my suggestion for official propaganda♦ 6. I learned something from the files of the situation that arose in Kuwait, and I have first hand knowledge of affairs in Dubai and Bahrain. I will not burden you with arguments in detail, but I venture to assert that there is no point of genuine resemblance between the Kuwait and Dubai agitation on the one hand and the situation in Bahrain on the other. In considering what advice should be given, not only must this fact be borne in mind, but I suggest we must try to look at the question through the eyes of the Shaikh and of the people of Bahrain, to forecast what motives they will impute to us and to assess the probable effects 7A9/- \W ,10 -4- 7. They 'believe that the Kuwait and Dubai Councils were sponsored by us partly for our own ends and partly because of our dissatisfaction with the Shaikhs 1 adminis trations, Those who give us credit for reasonably honest motives at any rate believe that we advocated reform in order to remove grave abuses. Thus at the moment, to Bahrain the word 'Council' denotes the degradation of a Shaikh following gross maladministration. 8. What do they think they have seen us do in Bahrain? Depose Shaikh ! Isa, elevate Shaikh Hamad, appoint Belgrave, push and prod the administration into the shape it now has. If, then, official advice to appoint an Advisory Council is communicated I expect the following reactions. Whatever explanation one might give no one would appreciate the sig nificance of the word 'Advisory' except perhaps as sugar for a bitter pill. There would be, on the part of the Shaikh and his family, horrified surprise that we class Bahrain with Kuwait and Dubai, that we disapprove of the administration we ourselves have set up; and there would bw grievous resentment and a conviction of British treachery. The vast majority of the people would be astounded and would begin to believe that these self-interested agitators must have been right after alll The agitators themselves could scarcely fail to profit ultimately, if not immediately. Belgrave's position would be intolerable, and de Grenier and the rest scarcely better off. (An Adviser can be appointed after a Council has come into existence but not a Council during an Adviserate regime except with radical re-orientation) In a word, circumstances are so fundamentally different that a solution which would save Kuwait or Dubai would be disastrous in Bahrain•m -5- 9. To put it in another way. There has been revolution in Kuwait and Dubai owing to crass folly and abuse of their power by the Shaikhs. In Bahrain there has been, and should continue to be, — evolution* Slowly but surely representa tives of the people are being drawn into the administration, into the Baladiyahs and the other Majlises; and this process can continue. Ultimately no doubt the functions now performed by Belgrave and his colleagues will be taken over by natives of Bahrain, and it is by no means unlikely that in time a Ministry on a tiny scale may be fomed. 10. I do not believe it to be inevitable that agitation should increase and spread to other classes. Admittedly one must not ignore the spirit of the times, and great care and deep foresight must be employed. Propaganda is essential to dissipate ignorance and misconception, and there must be active steps in support of it. (I have indicated one or the 27th October 1938). Belgrave must be relieved more and more from routine. And we ourselves should show that while we encourage the increasing association of the people with the Government by methods of evolution, we have no sympathy for the activities of the revolutionary. two possibilities in my demi-official lexter No. C/666 dated 10 y Yours sincerely,Translation of a petition from the people of Hedd to His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad, received by His Highness on the 24th Ramadhan 1367.

I am sending you separately a copy of my letter to Peel regarding the terms etcetera for the suggested retired magistrates or judges, and I am sure you will appreciate the difficulty we have had here in trying to work out any definite proposals for pay. The main thing is that His Highness will pay whatever is thought proper by those in Cairo or Khartoum who have better means of assessing suitable terms. 3. In regard to other matters. Considerable pressure has been brought to b ear on His Highness to release the agitators who are now in jail, end even the Sunni Qadhis have written two letters to him proposing the release of 'the misguided young men^. I succeeded in stiffening His Highness this morning and he is about to write to tell the Qadhis to mind their own business. 4. In regard to the Bahrain Government representative with the Bahrain Oil Company, I found that His Highness and his Family advisers had rather a wrong idea of the functions which he is to perform. My approach on this question had been hitherto via Belgrave and Shaikh Abdullah separately, but apparently they had not quite managed to get across what was really wanted. However I explained it in careful detail this morning and it should not be long before this matter is settled. The Shaikhs of course think the Company/- Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel _ _ _ Sir Trenchard Fowle, K.C.I.E., r Political Resident in the P e ^sian^Gulf ,-2- Company should pay for the representative and I had to point out that there was nothing in the Concession requiring this from them (though I shall try to get the Company to contribute a little). The job will be nothing like a full- time one, and my own preference is for the Amir of Rafa 1 , who is already on the Civil List - an important point. J*. IfZ 5. Will you now please refer to paragraph 7 of my official report No, C/704 dated the 19th November 1938? A statement of complaints against the Bahrain Petroleum Company has now been submitted to the Bahrain Government by the three Baharna leaders and Yusuf Fakhroo. 1 enclose a copy herewith. From internal evidence it is quite obvious that this has been made out by the 'young men' out at the Camp and merely handed in by the so-called representatives, who indeed seemed to want Belgrave's advice in preparing a memorandum of grievancesl They acknowledge quite cheerfully they know nothing about these alleged grievances themselves, but it is at least of use to have brought the thirginto the open instead of allowing underground agitation against the Company to grow. A great deal contained in the statement of grievances is the purest nonsense, but Belgrave and I are seeing the Bahrain Petroleum Company Triumvirate (Lipp, Davis and Black) on Monday morning and I will make a fuller report on this matter next week. Yours sincerely.1. Me find that the ^Sherika' recruits labour locally. There are nationals and foreigners. The national workman gets Rs -/1CA per day. The foreigner gets at least Rs 2/- a day. #Vhy this dit: erence? The national who gets Rs -/10/~ a day does the same w ork which the foreigner does, the foreigner who gets Rs. 2/-. This small wage is deducted for Fridays; that is four days in a month; he therefore gets wages for 26 days, which is Hs. 16/4. Is this small amount sufficient for supporting his family? This indicates that the national is prevented a?2im enjoying the benefits (khairat) of his country and the foreigner enjoys them at the ecpense of the national without any right. Perhaps the 'Sherika' says that the workman of the Saouidya 'Sherika' receive the same wage as the Bahrain workmen. But v/e say - Has the 'Sherika' noticed that all the men who are working there a re subjects of Saoudi Arabia? But here, the workmen whi are nationals are very small in proportion to the foreign ers consisting of Persians, Baluchis, Indians, Omanis, Hassa- wis, Ne^dis and others. Let the 'Sherika' know about this army of foreigners as compared with the few nationals, the sons of the soil, without work, a d if they are going to pay here the same wages as in Arabia, let them at least take only nationals. But if a national and a foreigner apply for work the foreigner is given preference and this is not justice, 2. Secondly toe ability of the national is more than that of the foreigner. The national and foreigner are doing the s ame work and after some time the foreigner is given in creased wage while the work is same and even while the national works feetter. Unfortunately the f oreigner slways scores in pay over the sons of the soil who hal?e a right to such benefits, mat is this but cruelty of the 'Sherika 1 * on the son of the soil? And there is no one to help the national and prevent such bad treatment. They do not have any one to report their grievances to. Such instances of partiality are many. We give two examples. i-2- (i) The gaugers. There are two divisions, one divi sion in the new camp and one in refinery. The national and foreigner do the same work. But the national works under the foreigner even if the foreigner is not in any way abler; in almost all cases the national is abler in his work* The 'SJerika' always refuses the right of the national even if the national is abler. (ii) The proof that the w Sherika rf gives the foreigner better wages than the national. There is a place in the refinery called 'place of distillation'. Before the people there in charge of the work/were Indians. But three months ago the 'Sherika' replaced them with Ara\?S) but on reduced wages. The Indian was receiving Hs. 5/- a day and the national now gets Rs« 2/- a day at the most. Let it be known that this work used to b e formerly done by Indians and is now done by nationals. 3. Facilities given by the , !Sherika ,, t&lt;&amp; the foreigners and are denied to the nationals. (i) Pay. We have already deaIt with this point. (ii) In cases of sickness or an accident while on duty. The foreigner gets pay during sickness and also is given com pensation for any accident. The son of the soil does not get pay if sick and is not given any compensation inoase of accident except oneweek after the accident when the 'Bharika' gives half wage and after recovery the 'Sherika' on takes him/only if it finds c^ite fit for work: if he Is not quite fit it refuses to take him back to work and is refused any compensation. The foreigner is thus given enough monqy in such instances. (iii) Living quarters and other facilities. The foreigner is given stone built houses with electricity^ the national 4s given huts which are full of dust 4n breeze and the sane is the c ase w ith bathrooms and the kitchens and the cooking arrangements. The foreigner is given all comforts in everything-3- which the national is denied. There is not much difference between a man living outside and one living inside these miserable huts. Has the 'Sherika' noticed this and tried to treat them equally? The national has a better claim to these comforts. Among the facilities and comforts which a re enjoyed by the foreigner is one that if the foreigner worked for some time and is in class III he is promoted to class II and enjoys all the resultant comforts given by the ^Sherika' to those of that class. The national is not given such lifts even if he works hard. The 'Sherika' finds that the national is not competent so that he can be given such lifts? It can b e noticed that the 'Sher ika' has given special t ransport for fhe transport of Indians from the working place to Manamah every d ay with the Jews who are classed underclass III. There are nationals who are working with them (the Jews) at the same plsce and doing the same work, yet the national is forbidden to obtain these facilities. In truth this is a simple nt tter but we wanted totring this to your nts notice the plight of nationals efen in simple matters such as these. 4. Many of the Americans and Englishmen have dashed or run their cars over Bahrain subjects and our Government is quiet about it. The 'Sherika 1 * does not pay any compensation at all. The poor peopled This is the result of the non-existence of a committee which wi 11 go through such matters and wrest the right of the national. 5, Three fourths of the workmen in the 'Sherika' are now foreigners while there are many nationals without work. If there existed a committee it would have preferred the national to the f oreigner who claim Bahrain nationality when he wants work and lives at the expense of the nationall(i)/- f sf '' / 5 ' (U // r GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, Department, [bushireresidency.

In paragraph 10 of your letter No# 597-S dated the 17th November, you instructed me to submit my views after consulting Belgrave confidentially. This I did and the views expressed in paragraphs 7-9 of my leifer No. C/720 dated the 26th November represent the opinions held both by Belgrave and myself. I would add that I have been in the closest consultation with Belgrave throughout and that our views on all points have been unanimous. I have, however, again consulted Belgrave verbally and he has asked me to communicate the following remarks from him:-:&gt;} if i i- . -2- (i) 'The words Executive 1 or 'Advisory 1 mean nothing to the people of Bahrain. The institution of a Council by orders of the British Government would be universally regarded as the forcible removal of power and authority from the hands of the Shaikh and his successors. The Shaikh and the Ruling Family would regard the imposition of a Council by orders of the British Government as a betrayal of the trust which they placed in the British Government and of their long friendship with England. Shaikh Hamad and his Family are genuinely loyal to Great Britain. In these days of increasing anti-British feeling in this part of the Near East is it not impolitic to reduce the authority of one of the few really well-disposed rulers and to antagonise the Ruling Family and the Arabs of Bahrain ? The real Arabs of Bahrain are ^ solid in their support of the present regime. A petition \ has now been made by all the Arab leaders in the same words * as the one from the Arabs of Hedd. Although Shaikh Hamad \ 1 See enclosure to my demi-official letter No. C/720 dated the 26th November 1938. T in his present condition 5 j might be persuaded, against 5 his will, to agree to having \ a Council, if ordered to do so, nobody would believe that he V agreed except under pressure. (ii) 11 The idea of a Council has been discussed by the Shaikhs since the recent political unrest. They one and all regard any suggestion of a Council as being the swan-song of the Khalifah as Rulers of Bahrain. The Shaikhs believe that the British Government would not wish to undermine their position as the Rulers of Bahrain. They are certain that with a Council in Bahrain (however it might be styled or formed) the Khalifah would not remain the Ruling Family. (iii) 11 The Shia Bahama do not want a Council and have never asked for one. I believe that they are satisfied with their/-their present conditions. Even the politically minded Bahama of Manamah, who are a very small group and have no real justi fication for assuming the position of representatives of the Shia Community, have made no demand for a Council. (iv) 11 There remain the ^olis 1 who are in fact Persians but Bahrain subjects resident over a generation in Bahrain. They are politically unreliable and are closely connected with Persia. They must bear much of the responsibility for the recent trouble. They are not Arabs and have no real sympathy for the Arabs. These are the only people who would like a Council. (v) 11 The need for a Council would imply an unsatisfactory existing state of Government. As I have so much to do with the Administration it is a little difficult for me to sing its praises, but I know that the Arabs in Bahrain and in other parts of the Gulf have for many years regarded Bahrain as the most progressive and successful of the Gulf States. (vi) ' Is the suggestion of a Council being made as a remedy for maladministration ? If so the defects in the Administration should be pointed out before such drastic medicine is inflicted. Is it being suggested because Councils I have been set up in Kuwait and Dubai ? There can be no com parison between conditions there and here. In Bahrain for years there has been an ordered Government, regular administra tive organisation, law and order and financial stability. The country is ruled by the Shaikh though mfest of the business of the State is entrusted by him to his brothers, his son and .ho (o™, in f.=t, th. mj*. unofflcll 1 The Shaikh is accessible to everybody as are his relatives and myself. None of the important xs* reforms and developments in Bahrain have been carried out without the knowledge and approval/-approval of the British Government, I see no cause for changing the present form of Government which is acceptable to the Ruling Family and to all except a few of the irres ponsible and of the undesirable elements of the people. If the British Government force the Shaikh to accept a Council the public would regard it as a sign that the Administration which had been approved by the British Government for so many years had suddenly become a failure. It has been incessantly stated that the British Government do not wish to interfere in the internal administration of this country. Has any event occurred in Bahrain to justify the British Government suggesting a completely different form of Govern ment ?' 3. You will see that many of Belgrave 1 s arguments are based on his opening sentence which is of paramount importance. 4. Your paragraph 2. The matter of the Advisory Committee on Education awaits the communication of official advice to His Highness, vide the first sentence of paragraph 7 of my /iTX- letter No .^C/YCH dated the 19th November. 6. In regard to the projected visit of an Educational Adviser, both Belgrave and I think that there would be little danger of hostile press propaganda resulting from a visit by an official from the Iraq Education Department. There have been no manifestations of official Iraqi hostility towards Bahrain, and on the contrary the Iraq Government have been quite helpful in various ways (e.g. finding a Shia Qadhi, allowing Bahrain girls to attend Iraqi medical schools, etce tera). Moreover Shaikh Abdullah bin ^sa, the Head of the Education Department in Bahrain, is on excellent terms with many important people in Iraq, and I understand, though I have not seen it, that there was recently a favourable article/-article on Bahrain Education in one of the Iraqi papers. Admitting that education in Bahrain is still almost in its infancy, it is thought here that there will be no scope for active hostile criticism sponsored by an Iraqi official in the Iraqi press. Indeed I understand that there are several Englishmen in the Iraq Education Department and it might be possible to arrange that one of them should visit Bahrain. 6. I do not think, and Belgrave agrees with me, that a visiting official from India would be of much help, and recent experience of the delays attending advice from India has not been particularly encouraging. The disadvantage of obtaining someone from the Sudan lies mainly in the long journeys involved and consequent probable delays, plus heavy expenditure. / Political Agent, Bahrain.nonfidentaal D.O.

Will you please refer to paragraph 5 of my demi-official letter No • C/738 dated the 3rd December 1938 and the memorandum of grievances against the Bahrain Petroleum Company enclosed with that letter? 2. The meeting with the senior officials of the Bahrain Petroleum Company was duly held and I now enclose a copy of the minutes of the meeting and of the Company 1 s memorandum which was read at the time. (These have only just reached me, and I am afraid there is no time to make additional copies before the mail leaves). The minutes were recorded by a Cont- pany^s stenographer, and are not as I should have recorded them myself; but presumably they have been shaped for consumption in the Company's own Head Officel 3. I have the following brief comments to make. (i) Housing There are two difficulties here. First that married Bahraini employees of all classes are reluctant to take their families up from Manamah and Muharraq to the Oil Camp or its surroundings since they and their wives thus lose the pleasures of the town. The Company could not therefore undertake a large scheme of building married quarters which would probably remain vacant. On the other hand it is important from the operational point of view that a number of Bahraini employees should live close to the Refinery or the Field and although most people of this type have lived for generations in barastis they now demand pucca/- onourable Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowle, K.C.I.E., C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. iH : : | I'.Ipucca houses♦ The Company have, as the minutes show, schemes on a bachelor basis on hand for meeting this demand Of course the majority of the Refinery coolies live in villages in the vicinity, in Rafa* and Sitra. (ii) Drinking water I am satisfied from personal observation that Bahrainis in the Company's employ get far better water than they would in their own housed Personally I believe the main cause for complaint in regard to water is that it has not been cool enough. As shown in the minutes adequate steps are being taken to meet this» (iii) Comparative pay of foreigners and Bahrainis The plain fact here is that the Bahrainis are on the whole not worth even one half of the pay drawn by Indians. This point is very fully brought out in the attached memorandum. Obviously the local managers cannot ignore the need for satis-' Si fying Directors and Shareholders, for it is after all/bommercial concern; and I consider it would be unreasonable to press the Company to increase the rates of wages drawn by semi-skilled Bahrainis. As for cooly rates, it is a matter for much satis faction that the ten anna wage for casual labour has disappeared. That wage is common, and I think adequate, in Manamah itself, but the objection to it as a Company rate of wage lay in the fact that most of the casual labour on this rate came from the towns, and an undue proportion of it went in meeting the cost of transport. The Company cannot be expected to provide free transport for its whole force between Manamah and the j! Field or the Refinery, partly on account of cost, and partly because they cannot specifically encourage labour to live at a distance from the scene of operations. Civ) A(vii)/- f f 2.- -3- (iv) CompensatiQfi for Accidents and Sick Pay The Bahraini employee is treated on exactly the same lines as foreigners in these respects. It is quite untrue to suggest that Bahrainis who are injured do not receive compensation and this allegation is due solely to false propaganda. It has been arranged that Class II and III employees who need 'hospitalization' will b e dealt with in either the new Bahrain Government Hospital or in the Mission Hospital, Manamah. There are many advantages in this, one being that non-Company doctors cannot tje accused of minimising accidents when questions of compensation arise. (v) Transport of Labour has been dealt with above, and in the accompanying memorandum. (vi) Excessive employment of foreigners There is some misapprehension here. Local people are inclined to forget that children born in Bahrain of e.g. Persian parents, are Bahrain subjects unless they divest themselves of Bahrain nationality. There are, I am convinced, a good many of these in the Company's employment, and there can be no question of their dismissal on the grounds that they are foreigners. The number of real Persians employed by the Company is steadily decreasing, and the same can be said of Indian employees. We believe that there are con siderable numbers of Nejdis and Hassawis masquerading as Bahrainis, and every effort is being made to stop this. Any cooly now applying for work must produce a c ertificate from the Bahrain Government that he is a Bahrain subject, and to prevent the s ale of such certificates, Belgrave has been asked to arrange for photographs to be attached to such certificates.'■ vll; question of leave with pay and Provident T?»n^ At the present moment every Mohammadan employee receives six holidays a year with pay. It is impossible to d emand that every employee should b e given every Friday off with pay I do not think that labourers receive such a concession any where in the world. The Company have had under consideration for some time a scheme for short yearly leave on full pay for cooly labour, and I shall continue to press for an early deci sion on this. Similarly the Company are considering a Provident Fund scheme and the local managers suspect that the demand made in the memorandum of grievances is based on leakages from their correspondence with their New York Office 1 . Here again it is reasonable to press for as early a decision as possible, for such a scheme is obviously in the Company^s own interests in ensuring continuity of work on the part of their employees. 4. On the whole both Belgrave and I were satisfied that the Company were prepared to givegsnerous consideration to reasonable suggestions for improving the lot of their employees. It must not be thought that there is any g enuine feeling of grievance shared by the majority of their employees of all classes, and employment with the Company is no less popular among the labouring classes in Bahrain than it used to be. Even when the ten anna rate was in force there were dozens of applications for e very|vacancy, and of course care must be taken not to upset the labour market in Manamah. Mevertheless Belgrave is already engaged in collecting information on present day costs of living. Cur main immediate object is to put a stop to the underground flow of false rumour and c omplaint designed to unsettle the labouring classes, and with the information now at our command it should be possible to do something/-something in this direction. Simultaneously we should try to encourage the Company to institute generous concessions in the way of leave, Provident Fund and improved living conditions, which though far beyond anything that Bahrain has experienced in the past should serve t o improve the standard of living, and in a measure to ensure that large sections of the people realise that they benefit directly from the increased prosperity resulting from the discovery of oil here. 6. In regard to the Bahrain Government representative with the Company, I am seeing His Highness on Monday and hope that the matter will be f inally settled then. It is intended also to call together a number of representative persons to whom a general explanation can be given of the Company^ treatment of its Bahraini employees, in a further effort to dissipate ignorance and misunderstanding. Yours sincerely, / t \'(fXw 1 ^ m ■ 1 Bahrein Island, Persian Gulf. December 9, 1938. Meeting held at 10:00 a.m. Monday, December 5th at the Awali Main Office of The Bahrein Petroleum Company, Ltd*, to discuss the complaints registered on behalf of Class III Bahreini employees by the so-called 'Leaders' in letter ad dressed to the Political Adviser, dated 29th Ramadhan. The following were present: Messrs. E, .Veightman C. D, BeIgrave F, A. Davies M. E. Lipp C. Davis J. 3, Black The primary purpose of the meeting was to provide Messrs. Weightman and Belgrave with information on the basis of which they would be able to answer the many points raised. The letter submitted by 'The Leaders' was discussed point by point as follows: 1. Irovidin^ better housinp; for the local employees It was pointed out that — a. The Company now have approximately 12o Class III men housed in gutch and feroosh quarters -- gaugers, refinery operators, and houseboys® b. There should be in the near future additional accommodations for Class III men through moving certain buildings into their camp and by reason of the vacating of the present temporary Class II and III hospital when facilities become available in Manama. Co Study is at present being given to the type of construction best suited for the housing of the Class III men the Company will want to kee x close to the operations• In response to the complaint that some men are^re- auired to 15 ve with others of different status in c ai1 be stated that the men are in general permitted bo pick their own roommates, providing they are willing to Jlo so J* 0 ^ attempt to occupy a room by themselves or with a smaller number than it is planned for. 2. Drinking? lA^ter. 1 i | r ^sJi ■ —iH'l I - 2 - £• Drinki&gt;v-: (Cont'd.) At the Refinery every man working there can have distilled water -- the sa e as Class I people have in their houses. The only difference actually is that the water at the Class III drinking places in the Refinery is not iced, but coclirc coils have 'been installed and it is quite cool enough to drink, even more * * * Next surfer coolir~ w* ' rol-^blv be The drinking water delivered to the Rafa camp is a half and half mixture of ^ellak well water and distilled water. The domestic, running water there for washing, etc is Refinery well water. In the Refinery barastl camp, Zel! well water is supplied for drinking. In the field, it is piped to all camp3 for T 1 mrposes. Zellak well water is iland and is probably better among the best well waters on the than what most of the employees have been accustomed to all their lives, some distilled wal 1 * : c U ^ . cc ^* dering it more healthful than Certainly, it contains no 'microbes' — periodic examinations are made to assure tb tlying Mr. Weightman mentioned that water piped to ou stations such as the G-a the ring Stations probably arrived very warm, and that this warmth was the basis for some of the complaints. It was pointed out that porous, earthenware jars such as are used generally to cool v/ater in this part of the world, which should ve The men ater cool as ^„ are accustomed to, have been provided in certain locations. 3.

Many of the Indians have had as much as 10 or 15 vears' experience at Abadan and elsewhere before coming here, -r g-nite of this the Company has reduced its Indian personnel at the Refinery from 230 to 132 during the past fourteen months.xd If? - 4. Company records ac a Bahrein!. It is probable that a fair number now appearing c the CompaaS rolls as Bahrein 1 are in fact foreigners, hired luring rush periods in the past and kept or. a^ per - nt • There is apparently some selling and unlawful transfer! * ig of certificates and the Government is giving consideration to affixing a photograph to each certificate. t.:io st^te'.ncnt that the Company employs a large number of foreigners -- Persians, Baluchis, Indians, Cmanis, lias a wis , Nejdis, and others, Belgrave said that the local people do not realize that many lersi^ns a; ■: Zaluchls as well as other races are in fact Bahrein subjects -- having been born here, which fact automatically gives them Bahrein citizenship. Mr# Belgrave also mentioned that there are quite a few Hasawis and Nejdis ' 1 it ■ . „ f 2) As stated before — if the Bahreini proves he can do as well as the foreigner, he vd -ll receive equivalent wages. It is understood, of course, that the Company does pay a premium to a man who leaves his native land to come here and work at the Company* s request. rv* ~ a universal practice# The attached memorandum covers this situation generally. The representative of the working man, referred to in this paragraph, was discussed at some length. Everyone realised that a cow ittee s-ich as the one suggested at V * start of the grievance letter would not be helpful in the least. All agreed, however, that if some one man with a reputation for fairness and who enjoys the respect of the Bahreini, could be found to act as intermediary 'betv/een the Company and the employee his appointment as such would he an experiment well worth trying. The average Bahreini seems to he afraid to talk to any of the Class I employees with regard to gri : w . -.3 even the more intelligent type are dumb if^asked to say what complaints they have, ^ Hie statement was made that such a man would he hard to f ind, the ^u-esent Amir of Rafa heirg cited as th type of man desired. It was mentioned that this matter of c*. representative had been disc ssed a f lays previously by Sheikh Hamad, his brothers, Mr. SZ/eightmai - d Mr. Belgrave. 3) ossihilit- of taking care of ^lass II and III employees in L'anama hospitals is being developed. It was pointed out that the reason the Company very often toes not get the chance to tre^v a .lass I-LJ- ^ ' ^ he merelv stavs away from the job and no one knows whether he is sick or just absei ting himself for a couple of days# To prove sickness he must produce a certificate, signed by a Doctor recogrized by the Company#r- l(Sl~ 119 r ..v J n iiaousaive Ziiii) , psrtainine to living quarters and other facilities, it was explained that 5 or 6 Class III men usud -i . v w c x w* ri ^r an c iiad a cook to prepare the^r food. The Company has built two feroosh kitchens in the Main Class III camp as an experiment with a view to replacing all I' the present Jarasti kitchens i.ith new ones of that type of construction. The question of whut constitutes a living wage then arose. I.Ir. :_a? j-c^ter} that it prc-hahly costs about | Rs.l/- per day, figured as folic rs, for a married employee who travels back and fortl to -lanama each day. 1 rr jllw • r / p'~ ^ s /- 1-3 ♦ 26/ - he p ! .r - f avfil ly in L:anai7i£ daily transport cost of living at Awali per month or Rs.l/ per day These figures were admitted to be only estimates and Mr. Belgrave is going to try and develop them further. Ee will also tabulate wages being paid by the Government and different business concerns in town. The Company's wage, according to its information, is quite in line with that being paid by others — even allowing for transport in most cases. The advisability of keeping rates in line was stressed The period of time after which a new employee' wage should be sufficient to enable hin to travel back and forth to Manama each day if he wished, and the Company did not require his presence at camp, was discussed. One year was mentioned but no definite stand taken. It was pointed out that often when a Class III man*s rate is raised, he merely takes a few more days cf^— pos ibly indicating that in general an income above the subsistence rate isn't of particular interest to him at the present time. Mr. Weightman stated he was anxious to see the lot of the Bahreini improved but that it was a matter which would re quire much study. There followed a discussion of the 17 points detailed in the first part of the memorandum from the Labor Committee# 1) No discussion. 2) Taken care of elsewhere in this memorandum. 3) Taken care of elsewhere in this memorandum. 4) Taken care of elsewhere in this memorandum. 5) Taken care of elsewhere in this memo ran dura®- 6 - A provident fund, such as the Company is con sidering now will, if installed, take care of this. No considered worthy of discussion, A vacation plan for Class III men is being con sidered at the present time. This should add to the permanence of the Glass III labor — as absences without leave would automatically limit their vacation. At the present time they are given six holidays a year with pay. If they work on one of these holidays they get paid double time. Practically every Indian here has a Bahreini apprentice working with him. Also the Company has a 7v el ding School, The men building the new big tank are all Bahreinis who are getting specialized training doing this work under Indian and Class I supervision, -^reed that there was no basis for this complaint as there is a strict watch being kept to prevent any abuses of this nature. Taken care of elsewhere in this memorandum. Considered unworthy of discussion. Suggested amount of time off for 10 years work^ out of reason. Some system such as this is in use by the local G-overnment but, of course, nothing of this magnitude. Some such plan worthy of investigation and consideration. The Companv has two schools in which it teacbes English and Arithmetic. There is also one typing school held at the Main Office, About 16 or 17 attend the school at the refinery and about 7 or 8 at Awali with a similar number at the typing classes. Pour of the men who have been attending the typing classes are now employed doing copying and filing work. Considered unworthy of discussion• Provident fund is being considered at^the present time. Mr, Belgrave pointed out that the Government Provident fund did not extend beyond the clerical class and did not apply 'C 1 labor, Onlv discussed generally. 'Vhat the Aratian Company had doge was pointed out — a contribution toward the cost.? ru&gt; Jt)/ 7 ~ In conclusion, Mr* ieightman said he thought they had been put in a position to answer most of the points raised in the Committee's letter and that the subject of what constitutes a living wage would be studied further. ■ I i iB 1- C HAND U M iJ^pfr ■ ] f'v hks» . . jt a On Tecember 1936 tbere were approximately 900 Class III employees in the Llaintenance 8c Operating Departments of the Refinery. Of this number 710 were native Bahreinis, according to the records recently compiled. These records were obtained 'by Mr. Lusgrave r/ho personally interviewed each of the 900. On this date there were four Class II-B and five Class III Jews in the Refinery.

This boy was personally hired by one of our Refinery Superintendents 2-1 /2 years ago at 12 annas. He could not spea^ any English at all. During the past 2 -1/2 years he has been taught to read and write English and has advanced steadily from. 12 annas to Rs.2/8/-« Performance record of Educated Type of Bahreini We have had very poor luck with the so-called 'School Boy' type of Bahreini. They refuse to do any kind of mahual labor, want high wages, and only want desk jobs ana so on. Since they do not know how to do anything except write their names and possibly a few figures, it is necessary that they be started at the bottom of the ladder. The Company 's best luck has been with natives of the 'coolie' type that are taught English and brought aloug. Recently the Company experimented with 'school hoys * in the laboratory as oil testers. Hers was a Jot in an air- cooled room, at desks, in clean surroundings, io ins the 3 f®® type of work as Class I, and starting at Rs.l per » . _^?; ne : JUS 'school bovs' were tried and none were found that v,^ damn. We finally took the 'garden variety' of Bahrein! and have so far four of thera fairly well trained. They are making from Rs .1 /4/- to Rs.1/8/- and have replaced one Indian.

It is obvious that until such we .is in key jobs -www ^ j. ^ LiD U U V XU'-Xij UXitLL until time as the Bahreini is sufficiently ••industrialized 1 ; 7 cannot do away with Indians entirely, or place Bahreinis It has been noted in many cases that increasing the wages of Bahreinis decreases their attendance. In other words, if they c„n .alee enough aoiey in four days to satisfy their wants, why work six ? This would seem to refute the argument that they are not paid a living wage. ItVa^e Scale for Bahreinls A scale of wages is provided for each job » The men advance according to their abilities from the lowest job to the highest* The same type of scale is worked out for the maintenance department, Each and every Indian in the refinery, with the exception of 7 men at the lower Plant, has a Bahreini apprentice training to take bis job. H oy / soon the Indian Is displaced depends on the Bahreini. Out of a total of 456 Class III employees in the Operating Dex&gt;artment only 86 are receiving less then Es.14/ - and they are mak*ig Hs.-/lE/-. In the Maintenance Department out of a total of 447 Class III employees only 225 are making less than Hs.~/14/- and they are making Rs.-/l2/-.

A ** &gt;■ v X ,l^ b fill you pleaae refer to your ixpresa Letter Ho,q/751- 1,b/5, dated the 8th Beceraber 1938, on the subject of Bahrain Agitation. If in paragraphs 7 - 9 of your letter Ho.0/720-1. b/5 # dated the 26th November 193 8 1 you had mentioned that you had consulted Belgrade and that the views expressed were his as well as yours there would have been no doubt that you had consulted him. As, however,you did not state that you had consulted Belgrave there was nothing to show that you had done so. m. 2. With regard to the Advisory Council I suggested, it ia fairly clear that you and Belgrave are strongly against it I I ffill of course pay due weight to your objections before finally making up my mind. There would in any case be no question of '♦forcing'* the Bahrain Government to accept our advice as to the formation of such a Council. We would merely advise the Shaikh to form one, and if he did not do so and things turned out as they have done in Kuwait and 'Dubai, the responsibility would of course be entirely his. 3. There is however one aspect of the Agitation which I think you and Belgrave have not envisaged, and that is that even when an autocratic government is a good one people agitate against it for the simple reason that they have no hand in its in other words 'good government is no substitute for 8elf-government ,4 .

This however did not prevent an agitation for Indian self-government before which we had to retreat. Similarly in Bahrain no matter how good the government of the Shaikh may be it is autocratic and therefore by its nature attracts agitation. 4. With this important consideration in mind I feel personally that sooner or later the agitation will become so strong, as ^•\W\ pointed out in paragraph 7 of my letter ^0.597-S, dated the 17th November 1938, that the Shaikh will have an Executive Council forced on him, and that therefore it is better for the Bahrain Qovermaent to grant minor concessions now rather than be foreed to give major concessions later. Short of the Advisory Council I suggested could more publicity be given to the un- ^ t official Council referred to by ^elgrave in paragraph 2 (vi) of your ijxpress x»etter under referenced Tould it be a good thing for instance for the Shaikh to sit with his Council, once a week say, to receive petitioners ? The advantage of this would be that the various heads of the departments would be present and some sort of redress could be made, or an assurance of investiga tion given on the spot, which is the sort of thing that Arabs like. 5.

With reference to your letter No.C/753-»l.b/&amp; &gt; dated the 10th December 1938, on the subject of the grievances of Bahraini subjects against the Bahrain petroleum Company. /hile of course the political Agent should interest himself closely in the grievances of the British Indian employees against the Company I doubt whether he need intervene actively in the grievances of Bahrai n subjects, especially as he has so much else on his hands. Once therefore you have established the machinery for conciliation and liaison between the two parties by the appointment of the representative of the Bahrain Government with the Company - vide Paragraph 4 of your letter Ho* c/738-1. b/5, dated the 3rd jecember 1938 - would it not be better for you to recede into the background and let them settle matters for themselves, only giving a helping hand/7 -4- hand when especially called on ? H i 8* I am afraid that all this correspondence on the subject of Bahrai n Agitation must be giving you a great deal of extra work when you are single-handed in the absence of Howes.

Sir, &lt; /•'&gt; f I have the honour to invite a reference to my letter No. C/704~l.b/5 dated the 19th November 1938 on the subj«ct of agitation in Bahrain and to forward herewith a copy of a letter No» 1822-9.A dated the 9th December 1938 received from the Adviser to the Bahrain Government. This letter sets out in some detail the system of administration of justice in Bahrain, comnents on the recent causes for complaint and indi cates the steps which it is proposed to take for improvement • 2. In view of my many recent reports, both official and demi-official, on the question of agitation, it is, I think, unnecessary for me to comment at length on this report from the Adviser* I should however perhaps make some remark in regard to the Sunni Shara* Court. It is sufficiently obvious that this Court, in its present composition, leaves much to be desired, but since the officially appointed Qadhis discharge wider functions than the mere holding of a religious court, it is incumbent on the Bahrain Government to act with extreme caution and to take care not to proceed too far ahead of public opinion. They may well use pressure to ensure the more rapid disposal of casss, but for a more complete reorgani sation of the Court it is essential that they should keep a careful finger on the pulse of public opinion. Were they, for instance, to attempt at once to replace the present Qadhis _ . I/-&lt;l\$ • 2- .91 ■I'V I should apprehend very strong public objection. It is therefore correct to say that this is not a matter of any urgency, though I would propose to urge the Bahrain Govern ment not to delay consideration of the steps that they might take for improvement when, as the Adviser states, a suitable opportunity occurs. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant, V A/\ h Political Agent{ Bahrain. *&gt;1No-. 1 ; - \ ('Aof 1357 Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain. Abated, ^hawaal 16. 1357 December 9, 1938 From To C. Dalrymple Belgrave, Esquire, C.B.E., Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, Bahrain. His Britannic Majesty's Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to refer to a matter which has recently become the subject of public criticism, that is the administration of justice in Bahrain Courts. The allegations which have been made by some of the public against one of the most important departments of the State are viewed by His Highness and his Government with grave concern. Having sat regularly for about twelve years on the senior Bahrain Court I know, more than any one else, what the work consists of and am acquainted with the capabilities of the various Shaikhs who have acted as magistrates and also with the numerous ^adis who have sat on the Shara' Courts as well as the members of the Majlis Tajara, 2. The Courts consist of the two Bahrain Courts, the Sunni and the Shia Shara' Courts and the Majlis Tajara, which is an advisory body of local merchants. The magistrates on the Bahrain courts are appointed by His Highness and are Bombers of the Ruling Family.3. Regarding the Shia Shara 1 Court, for thirteen years, irom my personal experience, there have been complaints among the Shia Baharna about their ^adis and I am sure that as long as there are Shia Shar'a Courts there will be factions and disputes and complaints. The record of the'Shia Qadis in Bahrain for the last fifty years is notorious. Th© only ^acii who was not accused of corruption died just before a scandal ocurred* The reason for this state of things is lack of religious and legal edu cation among the local Shia Ulema from whom the Qadis are chosen. The recent re-organisation of the Shia Shara f Court is at present causing satisfaction, the three local viadis are working under the supervision of an experienced i «iadi from f Iraq, but it is more than probable that after some time the various Shia factions will become discontented. To remedy this state of things the Government has started a school where Islamic law is being taught to half a dozen selected students all of them from the families who in the past have provided the Ulema of Bahrain and one young Shia is being educated at the religious school in Lucknow. No results however can be expected from this education until after a number of years. 4 e The Majlis Tijara is a body of twenty merchants divided into two committees, one of which sits once a week under the presidency of a Shaikh of thft B&amp;liag Family. They deal with commercial and diving cases and act in an advisory capacity to all the courts. The members are appointed by the Government. Certain members who are acquainted with diving customs deal with diving cases. Both now and in the past very . great difficulty has been experienced in persuading L —/ ^ -3- porsnadxiig stii table people to becosie meinbers of this court. The choice of the Shia Baharna aneiabers is re stricted owing to the fact that there are no important Bahama merchants in Bahrain and the majority of the Bahama are uneducated# The only Bahama of any commer cial and financial standing are pearl brokers and nakhudas# 5» The ounni ohar'a Court consists of three Sunni ', irr-i-if^immj m l t ii W n i. n .nini U _., ftadis, they are ignorant of modern methods and have no real legal training. The youngest of the trio controls the court. They are slow and inrariably seek for com promises instead of giving judgments; this in itself is compatible with the ethics of Islamic law but is carried to an excessive degree# There is complaint about their dilatory methods. Both in matters of law and in general matters they are ignorant, narrow minded and unprogressive, they are however typical of the Sunni Ulema of Bahrain. It is not at present desirable that the Government should urge any reforms in the Sunni Sha^a Court as public opinion • on this matter is uncertain but when a suitable opportunity occurs improvements will be made# 6. The main subject of complaint is about the Bahrain Court and the junior Bahrain Court. It has never been suggested that these courts are corrupt# If any grounds for such an accusatipn existed it would certainly have been made# The complaint is that the magistrates are untrained. The only training and experience which they have had was acquired by those who sat with me on the Court. It is an invidious statement for me to make but I feel that I should say that His Highness and his brothers and the people who have voiced their complaints have all stated tnat if 1^had remained on the court the present complaints would not Jiave been —-4- been made. I know that this is true. It has however been the policy of this governaent to encourage the members of the Ruling family to take an interest in public affairs by appointing them to positions oi responsibility such as magis trates on their courts. The degrees of ability of the various Shaikhs depend not on their education, because almost without exception they are uneducated, but on the amount of commonsense which they possess and on their ability to resist outside influence. In this respect I would refer to a note written by the Political Agent of which I have a copy. No. C/656 of 14th September 1937. 7. The chief fault of the lower Bahrain Court is that the magistrates try to avoid the responsi- bility of giving judgments by transferring auay many as possible of the cases to the Majlis Tajara and the Shara courts. The cases which they deal with are badly recorded and without considered judgments. This court deals almost entirely with civil cases. There is however the right of appeal from judgments in the lower court to the court immediately above it, but appeals are infrequent, 8, The Bahrain Court is the highest of the Bahrain courts, it deals with civil and criminal cases including capital offences and civil claims which have often amounted to lakhs of rupees in one case. Froiii my experience on this court I can state tfcat many \ ' of the cases are very complicated and difficult to decide and for competent handling of cases is essen tial that the magistrates should have some^legal train ing. The court has to deal with a great variety ofof claims, estate cases, bankruptcy cases, land disputes, fist; trap cases, diving cases, water rights as well as criminal cases of every descrip tion. Pttring the last thirteen years there have been great changes in Bahrain and life has become more complicated owing to the growing needs of the people, disputes ere no longer settled by private arbitration and the courts are resorted to on the least provocation. In the past the administration of justice by the Xhalifah magistrates by commonsense methods satisfied the public. The methods and the type of justice which is meted out are still the same but the people themselves have changed. iilhile the present magistrates are not less experienced than their predecessors the public standard of education and general knowledge has improved. The Bahrain courts are compared to the courts in India and Iraq, obviously the Bahrain courts suffer by this comparison. Although there are causes for complaints about the competency of the Bahrain courts the abuse which has been aimed at them lately is not entirely justified. Each of the leaders of the present agitation who are now in custody, have particular reasons for resenting the magistrates• Ali bin Khalif&lt;ah the chiel agitator, has a long criminal record and was convicted in the Bahrain court for misappropriation of wakf propeity, he was also dismissed from his former position as municipal secretary owing to his anti-gov^rnHent activities. Saad bin Shamlan was forbidden to practise in the Bahrain courts as a waidl owing to dishonest mbhods. Ibrahim lamal was sentenced to nine months hard labour by the Bahrain court for misappropriation of minors' property and Ahmad Chirawi had recently-6- / recently been warned that he would be forbidden to appear as a wakil. The Bahama leaders who demand the dismissal of the existing magistrates and their substitution by magistrates chosen by the people iroia the people are not Eerely seeking to improve the administration of justice. Their object is that the Bahama as a community should obtain more power. When discussing the matter of the courts with them they stated emphatically that they did not suggest that they or any of the public — except perhaps one young man who used to work in a wakil's office in India — were more qualified or capable of acting as magistrates than those now holding the appointments, they considered that because the Khalifah magistrates were not more expe rienced than the Shia man-in-the-street therefore the Shias might rightly be represented on the courts. 9. The question of a Code has also come up again, though it is significant that it has not been ^ \ mentioned in any of the demands recently put forward^^- (j)first suggested that the court3^hould_adQ£t a^egulaj^ code about five years ago and(2)obtained Arabic copies ^ . of the Sudan Penal Code and various regulations which ^ since then have been referred to by magistrates on the Bahrain Court for guidance in criminal caaes though no penal code has been officially adopted. About three years ago the Bahama made some agitation and asked/for a code though at that tiroB, as now, most of the general public took no interest in ths cooe or viewed it'with some suspicion. A committee was appointed to deal with the matter and it began by codif ying gom e of the existing proclamations such as the diving rules,3 -a&amp;a.. v -7- rules, but only a tew of the goverMaent proclamations relate to matters which can be included in such a code. The bulk c: the proclamations are about trivial and tem porary matters. The members of the committee, after a few sittings, shov/ed a lamentable lack of interest in their task, the leading Arab, Khan Bahadur Abdur- rehman Zayani, very soon retired on grounds of ill health and the other members constantly failed to put in an appearance# It was decided before the committee was appointed that I should not take any part in composing who the code. When the court clerk,acted as secretary to the committee, went on long leave and Shaikh Abdullah bin Hamad went to England and the most intelligent member died, the committee ceased to function. During their sittings however, they codified almost all the relevant proclamations and in addition they drafted numbers of rules on various subjects. They did not commence work on a Penal Code nor did they propose any punishments for infringements of government regulations. The subjects which they dealt with include diving laws, pearl sale, fish trap rules, bankruptcy, land regula-t tions, division of iaimoveable property and pre-emption, all rules and regulations which are now in force in Bahrain Courts, What is now more essential than codi fying proclamations or adopting a criminal code is the preparation of rules for court procedure and the conduct of cases and instruction to the magistrates, A local committee is incapable of doing this work, 10. If the young Khalifah Shaikhs are given ins truction in the duties of magistrates, if the procla- mations which have been codified are edited and published and some existing criminal code is modified and made s uit' able for local needs, there will remain no cause for genuine complaints. These things cannot be done withoutwithout the aid of experts and the temporary employ ment 01 suitable persons for this purpose has now been approved by His Highness. It will take time to obtain the services of the legal experts and in the meantime the work of the law courts has to con tinue. A As a temporary measure, in order to help the magistrates, who will now be particularly sub jected to comment and criticism, I propose to sit on , ... n , ^ M the Bahrain Court when important cases occur. This arrangement has the entire approval of His Highness c, | . -HI ■mi I, i . .I.IIIMI ■ iiriTWn *ti -«v rrrf ''^''' ,, '' l * IM, * ll ' l ' l ''^*&lt;wmni^L,j.j^wLi-nii» &gt; i'' l| * n ' l '^iiii Shaikh Sir Ha&amp;ai* I have the honour to be, oir, Your most obedient servant, - Adviser to the Government.&gt;4 iqlM GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, D bpartmint, gUSH IWE RESIDENCY N» t.Mj.it - CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS EXPRESS LETTER Confidential /&gt;.

The matter was mentioned in the reports on the Bahama agitation in Bahrain in 1934-35 (vide A-' paragraph 7(c) of Political Agent*a letter No. C/112 dated the 18th February 1935 and paragraph 15 of your letter No. C/43 dated the 18th March 1935 to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India). The Government of India in their letter No, F.230-N/35 dated the 6th November 1935 suggested that village and primary schools might be expanded by offering enc ouragement/- U |C'-encouragement to private or mosque schools already in existence in the villages; 'but on a report being received that a village school had been opened in Sitra (vide paragraph 7 of your letter No. 160 dated the 22nd February 1936 to the Government of India) the matter was allowed to lapse» 3. For a picture of the educational system in Bahrain I cannot do better than refer you to the section on Education A / / ■■ ™ in the Government of Bahrain* s Administration Report for the years 1926-37 and their Annual Report for 1937-38. These were forwarded to you with ray Printed letters No. C/204-8/9 dated the 27th March 1938 and No. C/564-8/9 dated the 6th Sep tember 1938. I need only add that there has been some expansion of the Technical School 9 that three girls are being trained as teachers in the British Syrian Training School, that all schools show an increase in numbers, notably 30 in the Manama Girls 1 School, and that boys leave school earlier than they used to in the past, owing to the opportunity of employment offered to them. 4. As for the policy which might be suggested for future expansion and improvement, it seems to me that there are two predominant factors to take into consideration. The first of these is financial. Unless we are to modify the advice which we have given to the Bahrain Government in regard to the creation of a Reserve Fund as rapidly as possible, I do not think that Bahrain can afford much more than Rs» one lakh I to Rs. one lakh and a quarter per annum for education. In this respect please refer to ray Note dated the 22nd November 1937 on the formation of a Reserve Fund for Bahrain. The second is the attitude of th« people. The poorer classes are slow to send their children to school, for the simple reason that they want them to work; and even the more prosperous merchant classes will not keep their children at Bchool once/- 1 ? • yHjU y -3- o n C6 they have reached 'the mlnlmuxn s'taiidai*d of education at which they qualify for some sort of employment. There is in whis cl&amp;ss the almost universal belief that manual labour is derogatory and that the object of education is to provide for a livelihood at a desk; and finally parents decline to exert any effort towards the discipline of their children. These factors are of extreme Importance in considering any development of the educational system in Bahrain. 5. I have consulted Mr. Belgrave and we are of the opinion that every effort should be made to put education here on a purely utilitarian basis. The object we should aim at isj so far as possible ^ universal primary education^ enabling all classes to read and write in a simple manner in their own language and to obtain an elementary knowledge of arithmetic. The latter is of particular importance to such classes as divers and cultivators. Secondary education should, we think, be concentrated in the two main towns, and it might well be possible to provide that children of more than usual intelligence from the villages should be given small scholarships to enable them to go to the towns for secondary education, there to be accommodated in hostels. For higher education it is impossible to provide in Bahrain itself. Here again the scholarship system might be adopted to enable particularly bright children to go to other countries for higher education. Obviously the scholarship system should be based on exceptional merit and competition; and it should, we think, be so calculated that it will not provide an excess of educated young men beyond the capacity of the Government itself and the commercial fims to absorb into their offices. 6. Technical education might be expanded, though there are many difficulties to overcome, particularly the hostility towards manual labour to which I have referred above. There would/- m I . 1 1 r ijwould, for instance, be much advantage in teaching school boys masons 1 work 5 but hitherto it has not been found possible to obtain even a small nucleus for a technical class of this nature* Nevertheless this may come, for the Technical School itself has only been in operation for a short time and it is to be hoped that there will be a fuller realisation in future of the advantages to be gained by attending it. In the village schools efforts should be made to introduce agricultural classes and the Adviser already has plans for making a beginning on such a project, though these plans must necessarily await the arrival of the Agricultural Expert*s report. 7. These are the very broad outlines of the policy which the Adviser and I think should be aimed at for the future so far as boys r education goes, and it is clear that they require very much more detailed examination with expert aid. As for the girls, it is noteworthy that female education seems to be gaining rapidly in popularity, particularly in view of the stress laid on its utilitarian value. That is to say, much care is bestowed on classes for cookery, sewing and similar household duties, and it is a matter of interest that Her Highness has now sent her two grandchildren to the Girls* School in Muharraq. My personal ignorance of female education is profound, but I would suggest that in view of the growing popularity of the girls schools here it would be as well to allow the existing system to persist * for some years to come. 8. As for immediate measures, the main needs seem to be to attempt to rouse public interest by the creation of an Advisory Educational Board, whose functions must necessarily jfp be very strictly controlled (vide paragraph 6(i) of my letter No. C/704 dated the 19th November 1938) | to obtain expert advice/-(tllto OGi '''v/' i' ■ cn ¥ -6- advice as to the adequacy or inadequacy of the teaching methods at present employed in the Bahrain schools (vide reference quoted immediately above); and to obtain expert advice also on the means to train Bahrainis for employment as schoolmasters in Bahrain schools. 9. I would strongly recommend that, except for approval of broad outlines of policy, no decision be taken in regard to Education in Bahrain until an expert adviser has visited here and there has been an opportunity of detailed examination of all sides of the problem with his aid* 'fk Political Agent, Bahrain* I have Just received a message that His Highness is anxious to arrange for the young Shaikhs to be taught English. It may be possible to combine this with an improved Schools Inspectorate* , :s%. ? '! «V| Kfjffy ; ft &lt; confident iaj.

There is one point I do not quite understand. In paragraph 6 of his letter of December 9th Belgrave saye: rt It is an invidious statement for me to make but I feel that I should say that His Highness and his brothers and the people who have voiced their complaints have all stated that if I had remained on the Oourt the present complaints would not have been made. I know that this is true. 1 * In paragraph 10 of his report Belgrave writes: * as a temporary measure, in order to help the magistrates, #ho will now be particularly subjected to oamment and criticism, I propose to sit on the Bahrain Oourt when important cases occur. This arrangement has the entire approval of His Highness Shaikh Gir Hamad.** 3. 4 If you will refer to paragraph 3 (3), (4) and (5) of my letter ^0.160-S of ^2nd February 1936 to the Government of India, copy sent to Bahrein under my Printed Letter No. 161-rj of the same date, you will see that what Belgrave now suggests as apparently something nevr and 'temporary 1 is precisely what was arranged between B His Highness, Loch, Belgrave and myself nearly 2 years ago. (See also Loch's letter to me No.C/TK)-!.b/5 of 15th ?ebruary 1936). Do Belgravs^s remarks indicate that in the meantime he has not sat on the rjourt at all ? If so I do not understand why. Could you please clear / Nightman '58 qui re, I.C.3., Political Agent, Bahrain.clear this point up ^ith him and let me )aiow the result. fv'O 4, The reasons for relieving ^el^r&amp;^e of some of his Court work are given in paragraph 9 of my letter quoted atove: ••Mr• Belgrave will remain &lt;*1 the Upper Court, but as he will only deal with important cases, and in an Appellate capacity, he will have far more tine to give to the questions of oil, air, and naval interests in Bahrain, to which the Government of India have referred, and to the supervision of the Police, which is now in his charge --'H (paragraph 8 of my letter already quoted).'*Confidential * The Residency, Bushire, the 27th December, 1938. 1). 0, NO. 776-3. Many thanka for the prompt report contained in your express Letter No.a/779-1 .b/5, dated the 16th December 1938, In reply to my telegram No.415, dated the 13th December 1938, on Bahrain education. In addition, as you point out (paragraph 3 , ^ , v ^ £h l ^ rtL or your letter), Belgrave^ Admini at rat ion Report for 1926-37 and his Annual Report 1937-38 give a clear picture of the aubj ect. 2. The value of the educational expert*a visit will largely depend, as ia uaually the case with experts, on the clearness of his terms of reference, and before the Bahrain Government get their expert it seems to me that they will have to make up their minds on the following points: (a) Finance. Before one asks an architect to plan a house one lets him know how much one is prepared to pay for its cost, and before an educational expert can plan a system he has to know what funds are available. Before the Bahrain Government therefore call in an expert they will have to decide how much they can expend per annum on JSducation. I see you suggest one ;*&gt;. x v&gt;- . lakh and a quarter per annum (paragraph 4 of your letter). (b) The next point on which the Bahrain Government will have to make up their minds will be a general idea of the sort of education for which they wish the expert to plan. (To pursue the analogy of the architect f the sort of house they want built.) Yours and Belgrave^ views on this, in which I entirely concur, are contained in paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 of your letten (1) / Weightman 158quire, 1.0.3., Political Agent, Bahrain.-2- (1) Primary, with scholarships for (2) Secondary, with scholarships for (3) Higher. (4) Technical. (5) Girls. It is satisfactory that this side of Bahrain education has been so suooesaful. It will be for the Bahrain aovernment also to decide what importance they attach to each of these branches by allocat- ■ jllll ing to each roughly a due proportion of the total yearly Education HI -al grant. ^c) Education in Bahrain is not compulsory and it is free (page 31 of the Administration Report already quoted). Yith the former I am in entire agreement but not with the latter. In the first place people generally value only what they pay for, and in the second free education of too extended a nature will only aggravate the present situation described by Belgrave on page 24 of his Annual Report for 1937-38; '•In spite of the openings for employment with the Bahrain Petroleum Company there do not exist in Bahrain a vast number of clerical posts to be filled by locally trained boys and any large increase in the number of young men who are educated in the schools is likely to be a source of trouble in the future.' It seems to me therefore that the Bahrain Government must decide now before they get their expert whether: (i) Education is to be free as at present, or{ suggest ions of my own) (ii )Ffee for Primary schools and with fees for the Secondary. (Higher Education which has to be under taken outside Bahrain will of course have to be paid for.) or / • - , inBH * - ■■ a ;i ■B 'i'l i mask&amp;mi S33 -3- or (iii)K'ee for the Secondary schools also but only up to a certain standard. After that fees *ould have to be paid, (d) The general administration of Education in Bahrain, I understand that this is at present in the hands of Shaikh Abdullah bin •Isa# the Minister for Education. He is certainly not an expert in education, but equally certainly he has not only a modern mind, but a mind of his owj . He is also prepared - I gather from tiae Administration Report «■ to deal firmly with agitat ing students, and if I read the signs of the times correctly there will be plenty of agitation in the future in Bahrain of all kinds, I presume that the Bahrain Oovernment intend thut he should remain in charge of Education, with the assistance of the Advisory Educational aom^ittee menticned in paragraph 8 of your letter, Will the School Inspector and Belgrave ex officio be on this Advisory oommittee, or will Shaikh Abdullah and these two form an inner Executive Committee ? 3. There will be no need for you to answer this letter, for which you are doubtless thankful after all the writing you have had to do lately, as I shall be coming to Bahrain in tne middle of January on my way to Muscat to sign the new Treaty. You, Belgrave and myself can then discuss this question at our leiaure. In the meantime, however, please get Belgrave*s views, yhen we have discussed the matter the next step will be I think for the Shaikh to lay down in writing what the general policy of the Bahrain Government is, and for the Bahrain Oovernment then to get an expert on a temporary visit who will draw up a scheme within the four corners of their policy as laid down;\&lt;\ &gt; 'k A By Air Mail.

As you will see, it has been impossible to propose either precise periods of engagements or detailed conditions oi service. As regards the former, however, three months is suggested for the officer who is to compile the Bahrein Code and ' at least a year 5 ' for the officer who is to give practical instruction to the magistrates of the ruling family, As regards conditions of service no suggestions are made, but the authorities in Banrein are prepared to pay whatever I uhe Cairo Embassy or the Sudan Administration think suitable I t . .. for/ i.

Exact form can o'hly be decided after matter has been discussed with Shaikh. 3. It seems preferable that matter should be dealt with by the Shaikh 1 s government and that we should keep out of it.
