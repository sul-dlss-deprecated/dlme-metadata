The Shaikh of Fujairah called on me on 4th April after his return from Abu Abu Dhabi where he paid a courttesy visit to Shakhbut. He expressed his friendly attitude towards the High v British Government and his desire to strengthen his frindly relations with them. He said that he was ready to grant all facilit ies required in his country whenever required and to come to under standing with the British Government in all matters of mutual interests 3. From his talk with me I made out that he is anxious to induce us to recognize him as an Independent shakh having the same status as other Trucial Coaat. Shaikhs. 4.

Fujairah is one of the Shamailiyah villages of which there appear to be 24. Fujairah has 150 houses and appears to be about the same size as Kalba. Many of the other villages however are nearly as big. The whole area is, nominally, under the influence of the Shaikh of Sharjah although he appears to have little or no influence there now. Kalba was acknowledged to be independent in 1936 by the British Government but that was, as you know, in connection with the grant of landing ground facilities there. There is no such question in regard to Fujairah and I see no benefit to obtained by entering into relations with him and recog nising his independence. 3. Could you please make further enquiries and let me know the reason why the present Shaikh is making this request when his predecessor had sworn allegiance to the Regent of Kalba. Possibly it has something to do with prospects of oil development. It is also to be considered whether the Shaikh of Sharjah would not make objection^. Political Agent, BahrainC onf id ential* No•G/621-3/5(L)• British Lgency, Sharjah, 26th July 1941. To The Political Agent, Bahrain. Memorandum 2 . Reference your memorandum No.C/600 dated the 14th June 194] The policy of the present Shaiidi of Eujairah differs great deal from that of his predecessor. He considers him self to be the lord of his own land and that he is strong enough to protect his interests and maintain his independence without the help of others. He does not acknowledge Shaikh Khalid as his over- lord but deals with him as his friend and ally. During uhe recent conflict between the Shahuh and the Q&amp;wasim, the shaikh of Fujairah had been one of the peace-makers but Shaikh Khalid, although; out wardly, shows himself as very friendly and y unlike his nephew Shaikh Humaid, follows a policy of appeasement, does not trust Fujairah and thinks that his policy was one of ' divide and rule **• 3. According to my enquiries, the Shaikh of Fujairah*s main object^is to put himself on the same status as other Trucial Shaikhs : and have the freedom to deal with the British Government as free Sheikh. I have been informed that Wien he visited Dubai he called on Mr.Lermitte of the P.C.L. but in my opinion his object was more to entice him for oil and indirectly induce the British Government to recognize his independence. 4. The Shaikh of Sharjah claims from Kht-tam Mala hah (Kalba) to Dairah(Dubai) and would undoubtedly raise objections about Fujairah if such objections can be accepted. The Shaikh of Sharjah’s \ sphere of influence does not extend to Fujaix'ah nor his will or authority are enforced there. Therefore, a Shaikh whose commands receive no obedience, and who cannot, when necessary, execute those commands by means of force, has, in my opinion, no right to make such objections.

The Shaikh of Fujairah has recently approached the Residency Agent, Sharjah, expressing a desire for treaty relations with His Majesty's Government, including 'an agreement on all matters (which) they may require in my country'; this refers presumably to oil or air facilities. He informed the Residency Agent verbally that he desired to be recognised as an independent Shaikh having the same status as other Trucial Coast Shaikhs. 2. Fujairah is one of the Shamiliyah villages, of which there were 24 at the time of compilation of the Gazeteer. Fujairah has (or had) 150 houses or so and appears to be about the same size as Kalba. Some of the other villages however are nearly as big. The whole area is, nominally, under the influence of the Shaikh of Sharjah although he appears to have no authority there now. 3. The late Shaikh of Fujairah had sworn allegiance to the Regent of Kalba and was under his influence, but the present Shaikh, Muhammad bin Hamad, brother of the late Shaikh, has followed a different policy and considers himself independent of both Kalba and Sharjah and able to protect his own interests and maintain his independedce. There /-*• 2 — There was, in 1939, some question regarding Fujairah coming under the influence of Muscat (vide confidential memorandum No. 932 dated 5th July 1939 from the Political Resident to this office) but nothing more has been heard of it since. 4. Fujairah is a very petty Shaikhdom and past dealings of the Shaikh with Kalba and Muscat show that he perhaps finds difficulty in maintaining himself alone at times, nor does he seem very trustworthy judging by recent reports regarding the harbouring of pirates in his village (vide my confidential report No. C/796 of 26th July 1941 and Politi cal Agent Muscat’s communication, copy forwarded to me under your Printed Letter No. C/388 dated 26th August 1941). 5. It appears that the Shaikh is interested in prospects of oil in his area and would like to make sure of his inde pendence in order not to risk having to share any proceeds with others. At the moment there seems to be no necessity of taking any action on the Shaikh's letter beyond asking the Residency Agent to thank him for his friendly sentiments. 6. The Political Officer, Trucial Coast, might however study the question further and visit Fujairah during the coming cold weather when it will, perhaps, be possible to see whether the Present Shaikh is likely to be able to maintain his stability in the future and whether it is worth entering into relations with him. It will also be necessary to ensure that the Shaikh takes proper steps against the pirates at present harbouring in Fujairah. 7. I would be grateful for instructions on the subject. Sd. R. G. Alban.

I discussed the case with Pally and Khan Sahib Abdul Razzak on my visit to Sharjah last month. Khan Sahib Abdul Razzak explained that the Shaikh of Fujairah's letter of 4th April 1941 (copy of translation enclosed) contained the sub stance of a friendly talk which the two of them had; and it was at the Residency Agent's suggestion that the letter was written, as Khan Sahib Abdul Razzak thought it would be useful to have recorded in permanent form the Shaikh of Fujairah's willingness to come to an agreement with the British Government about any concessions they might desire in his territory. 3. The Shaikh of Fujairah has not asked for, and prob ably does not expect, an answer to his letter (which w&amp;s written nearly a year ago). Colonel Prior expressed the view some time ago (vide para 5 of his letter No .932-14/242 dated 5th JUly 1939 to the Political Agent, ?JUscat) that the question of the Shaikh of Fujairah's status was one which 'we should try to keep at arms' length for as long as possible'. With this view I heartily agree, and I suggest that, unless and / untiluntil the Shaikh of Fujairah makes another move, the matter should be allowed to lie dormant* 4* In regard to Pelly f s preliminary examination of the question, he has wisely refrained from going to Fujairah and making detailed enquiries on the spot - inquiries which, had they been made, would undoubtedly have inspired in the Shaikh of Fujairah hopes that his representation was being seriously entertained. Nor has he been able to study in detail the history of the case, since old records are not available to him. He has, however, kept his ears open for information relevant to the case, and this, Z presume, was all that was expected of him*The Political Agent, Bahrain, Presents his compliments to :— The Residency Agent, Sharjah, and has the honour to send him a copy of the undermentioned document (X3C) The Agency, BAHRAIN, Persian Gulf Dated JL2tlL-May 1942 Reference to previous correspondence : Bahrain Agency Printed Letter No.C/350 dated 22nd March 1942 to the Political Officer, Trucial Coast.

Dear Sir, FUJAIRA. We have been asked by our Bahrain Office to obtain details of the extent of the influence of Mohammed bin Hamad ash Sharqi of Fujaira, We should therefore be very grateful if you could possibly let us have any information your office may have on this subject. We are particularly anxious to discover the approximate area of his territory with names of towns or villages and numbers of inhabitants. As we have also been asked to supply information on the degree of his independence, we wonder if you could help us to answer the following question:- (a) Does the Sultan of Muscat or the Regent of Kelba collect ’zakkat 1 from Shaikh Mohammed bin Hamad ash Sharqi or from any people in the area he claims to be under his control? (b) Does he receive any fixed annual or periodical payment from the Sultan of Muscat or the Regent of Kelba ? (c) Does the Sultan of Muscat or the Regent of Kelba claim suze rainty over any part of the area which Shaikh Mohammad bin Hamad ash Sharqi claims to be under his control ? (d) Do any people living in the area he claims to be under his control question his authority or refuse to recognise his control ? We should be grateful for any assistance you can give us on this matter. Yours faithful!British Agency, Sharjah* D.O.No.474.0210 Dated the 13th May,1948., Subject; Fujairah.

The information required by P.C.L. as far as it is available here is as follows j- The territory of Fujairah which is at present in the de facto control of Shaikh Muhammad bin Hamad ash- Sharqi is composed of the following: Fujairah town and the surrounding area, including the mountains and Wadis to the west of it of which the most important are Wadi Ham and v Najdiyaynj the coastal strip extending from Kalba to Khor Fakkan, including villages Ghuraifah, Mirbah and Gidfa; and the coastal strip extending from Bidyah upto and including Diba/Ghurfah and the steppe and mountains to the west of it. Towards Has al Khaimah Fujairah territory extends to Habhab, about two miles south of Khatt. The chief towns and villages are: Fujairah Ghraifah Diba/Ghurfah Sambrair Bidyah Sikamk&amp;m Masafi Si ji (a) Neither the Sultan of Muscat nor the Regent of Kalba collect^any zakat from the Shaikh of Fujairah or from any of the people in the area he claims to be under his control. (b) He does not receive any fixed annual or periodical payment from the Sultan of Muscat or the Regent of Kalba. (c) The Sultan of Muscat considers the Shaikh of Fujairah to be his subject; but the latter does not recognize this claim. The Regent of Kalba does not claim suzerainty over any part of the area which the Shaikh of Fujairah claims to be under his control. (d) Not as far as is known. 3. Much of Fujairah*s present territory used to be under Jawasim control but the father of the present Shaikh of Fujairah broke away from their control during the time of Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr,Ruler of Sharjah, who died in 1914.

Dear Sir, FUJAIRAH We thank you for your No.C/L-23 dated 19th May, 1948, in which you gave particulars of the ter ritory of Fujairah. 2. From your abovementioned letter it appears doubtful whether Fujairah can be considered as being included in the Muscat or any other concession. Should this be in fact the case it wou^d mean that Fujairah remains the only area over which we have not obtained an agreement. 3. We should be grateful if you would inform us whether in the event that Fujairah territory is considered to be of sufficient geological or other interest it would be in order for us to enter into negotiations with a view to obtaining an oil concession. Yours faithfully, (SGD) B.H. LERMITTE Manager.British Agency, Sharjah, The Sth June, 1948. CONFIDENTIAL. D.O.No.647.0210 My dear Felly, Please refer to your demi-official letter No# C/S-19 dated the 31st May, 1948. 2. While I agree that we should not increase by recognizing Fujairah's independence the number of Shaikhs on the Trucial Coast with whom we have direct relations, I am afraid I am opposed to the idea of recognizing Fujairah as subject to Muscat. His territory is clearly situated North of Khatim Malaha and Muscat renounced all claim to it 99 years ago — vide the enclosures to my draft letter sent with my demi-official letter No.328.0226 dated the 8th April, 1948. 3. In the past he was subject to Jawassim influence which at that time meant Sharjah; but as halba broke away from Sharjah so did Fujairah and the late Shaik)' of Fujairah swore allegiance to the Regent of ffalba — vide Alban's memorandum No.K/7 dated the 6th September, 1941. One of the reasons urged against our recognizing Fujairah's independence in the past was, I believe, our desire not to offend the Jawassim. 4. To regard him as a subject of Muscat would be a complete break with tradition and a serious handicap for Kalba, for Fujairah's territory is an enclave in the middle of Kalba. • 6. Further, Fujairah is hostile to both Muscat and Sharjah. For the Sultan of Muscat actively to try to establish his authority over him would lead to fighting and probably to a setback for Muscat; and the Shaikh of Sharjah would almost certainly suffer the same fate. I regard the chances of the Company getting a concession through Muscat or Sharjah as remote indeed. Fujairah is, however, believed to be well disposed to wards the new Regent of Kalba and, provided the Regent guarantees him a sufficiently large proportion of any receipts from the Oil Company, he would perhaps agree to approach the Company through Kalba or could be approached in that way. 6. Such an arrangement would also have the advantage of reconsolidating end eventually strengthening Kalba which may one day again be amalgamated with Ras al Khaimah. I would not suggest that tie new Regent would have much if any control over Fujairah at first; but at least the two Shaikhs would be on good terms, whereas the Sultan of Muscat or the Shaikh of Sharjah would be equally powerless and at the same time vigorously opposes* by Fujairah. If he is warned by us not to do so, I do not apprehend that Fujairah would try to usurp the Regency of Kalba. 7. If you could agree that Fujairah should be approached (or should be told, when he next raises the subject, to make his own approach) through Ka ba, I would now ascertain the reactions of the new Regent. The alternative regarding Fujairah as subject to Kalba is, I think, to recognize him as independent. The Sultan of Muscat will almost certainly claiim that he can give an oil concession for Fujairah; but he will be quite unable to help the Company to work it, if they ever wish to do so. C.J.
