A summary of the political occurrences in 'Oman during 1 the year under review is contained in the Report furnished by Major E. Mockler, which forms Part II of this Adminstration Report. The Resident visited Muscat in April, July and December, and on the latter occasion received the chief officers of the Wahhabi garrison and spoke to thetn about the complaints against their followers. No fresh outrages have lately occurred. 2. Pirate Coast. 2. The following are the independent chiefdoms and chiefs on this coast:— (1). Kas-el-Khaimah: Chief, Hameyd-bin-Abdallah ; tribe, El-Kowa- sim (Jowasim). (2.) Umm-el-Kawain : Chief. Abmed-bin-Abdallah ; tribe, Al-Bu-Ali. 'Ajman : Chief, Rashid-Bin-Ha meyd; tribe, Al-'Btj-Ali. Shargah : Chief, Salim-Bin-SultanJ; tribe, El-Kowasim(Jowasim). Dabey : Chief, Hashar-Bin-Maktoom ; tribe, Al-Bu-Falasah. Abu-Dhebbee : Chief, Za'eed-Bin-Khaleefah; tribe, Beni-Yas. 3. During the year 1882-83 no breach of the maritime peace occur red, and the several chiefs have adhered to their engagements. 4. The hostilities between Ras-el-Khaimah and Umm -el-Kawain, the commencement of which was reported in the previous year's report, were continued, and some raids were made by the Umm-el-Kawain men on theterritory of the enemy. The chief of Umm-el-Kawain personally of a bolder and more turbulent disposition than his rival of Ras-el-Khaimah, and he has command of a more warlike set of people, amongst whom the Bedouin element is largely represented. f lhe Ras- el-Khaimah chief has had the support of his fellow-tribesman, the chief of Shargah, and also of a portion of the El-Na'eem tribe, whilst Ajmau has sided with Umm-el-Kawain. 5. In January the chief of the Beni-^as sent his brother Dhiyab to mediate between the Jowasim and Umm -el-Kawain, and a peace was agreed to, both sides letting their claims and grievances drop. 6. In the month of June it was discovered that a number of boats belonging' to 'Ajman had been concerned in a piracy committed on a vessel (the Faih-el-Kareem, under Turkish colours) in the Red Sea, and a quantity of property plundered from the vessel was landed at 'Ajman. Steps were taken to detain the 'Ajman boats until the chaige was clearly established, when Her Majesty's ship Arab was sent to the pirate coast, and nine of the boats concerned in the piracy were publicly burnt, and the value of a quantity of the cargo of the plundered vessel was recovered.4 administration report of the persian gulf political 7. The chief of Dabey has conducted himself satisfactorily, and hag remained on good terms with his neighbours of Shargah and Abu- Dhebbee. 8. The chief of Abu-Dhebbee was, in the summer of 1882, annoyed by a raid made on Leewah by a party of the Al-Morrah from El-hasa, and he sent a force to endeavour to retaliate, but with little success. Some of his followers of the Manaseer tribe, however, are reported to have come upon a body of Al-Morrah and Beni-Hajir, and to have killed four men and carried off 150 camels. 9. In April the Political Resident, accompanied by the Assistant Resident, visited the various ports of the pirate coast, and received visits from the chiefs to whom the customary presents were given. 3. Bahrain. 10. Happily for the islands of El-Bahrain, there is nothing of importance or interest to add to the annals. Shaikh Ahmed-bin-Ali, brother of the Chief, went for a second time on a pilgrimage to Mecca and returned safely. The mercantile community are desirous of the establishment of a regular post office at Manamah, and the matter is under consideration of the Postmaster-General of Bombay. 11. During the year the Political Resident paid several short visits to the islands, aud Her Majesty^s vessels^ on the station frequently called. 4. Nejd, El-Hasa, and El-Katr. 12. In the interior of Nejd, events have occurred during the past year which are not without historical importance. In the autumn of 1882, 'Abdallah-bin-Feysal endeavoui'ed to recover the district of Majma in El-Kaseem, which had latterly placed itself under Mobammed- Ibn-Rasheed, Ameer of Jebel-Shammar. This attempt brought the latter chieftain into the field, aud 'Abdallah, outnumbered, retired to Riadh. There he learned that Ibn-Rasheed had entered into correspond ence with his nephews, the sons of Su^ood, and had made overtures to them in view to inducing them to take part against their uncle, or else to remain neutral. This, apparently, alarmed 'Abdallah, who placed his relations with his nephews on a new footing. The present arrange ment seems to be that ^Abdallah-bin-Feysal is recognized as 'Imam/' or religious head of the W ah a bees of Riadh, and the military power is entrusted to Mohammed-bin-Su^ood as Military Commander. Those conversant with the history of the Wahabees of Nejd are aware that » , under former Imams or Ameers a similar arrangement was in vogue, the heir-apparent to the Ameership being usually the leader of the forces. 13. Mohammed.bin-Su'ood, supported by the tribes El-'Ateybah, Suhool, and Sobeyyah, marched against the tribe Burey3 T ah, and carried away numerous camels and cattle. 14.. Hostilities have since been proceeding between the Al-Su'oodand the chief of Jebel-Shammar. The chief tribes which rallied to the standard of Mohammed-bin-Su'ood are the J Ateyk.h, the Kahtan, the Mote\ r, the Sobey a,the Suhool, the Dowasir, the 'Ajman, and Al-morrah, or rather fragments of those tribes. Mohammed-lbn-Rasheed commands ' • -A' ■ -mresidency and muscat political agency for 1882-83. 5 the Shammar, Harb, and Bureyyali tribes.

Eventually the Shaikh summarily ejected the Indian traders resident at El-Bida'a, causing- them to suffer considerable pecumaiy loss. The Shaikh alleged various false reasons for this unjust proceeding, ,. pa i m0 iive being- to monopolize the trade in pearls. 17.

During the night of the 11th March 1882, Ibraheem-bin-Keis (Alboo Saeed) took Mesna'aby surprise. The commander of the ganison was Eussufi Abdur Raheem (Belooch), and the Wali of Mesna^a at that time was Masood bin-Sad-bin-Suweilim, cousin of Suleiman-bin-Suvveilim, Wali of Dhofar. Three of the garrison were killed, and the remainder, having been disarmed, allowed to depart. The persons and property of the British subjects carrying on business there were not molested. Ibraheem-bin-Keis informed the Political Agent of the fact by letter. 2. On the 2ith March His Highness Seyyid Toorkee requested that the British subjects in Mesna'a might be warned to leave the place and remove their property, as it was his intention to retake it by force of arms. Commander Edwards, Her Majesty's ship Heady, was accord- ingly requested to proceed thither to give notice to the British subjects, and, having done so, returned on the 27th March. On the 4th April His Highness Seyyid Toorkee started for Mesna'a by sea in his steam yacht IJar-el-Scilaam, taking with him an 18-pouuder siege gun and some 15'' men, and at the same time sending about an equal number by land. At Burka His Highness landed and got together an additional force, composed of men from different tribes, which he also despatched to Mesna a. On the 4th April Her Majesty's ship Ready proceeded to Mesna'a to watch events. Mesna'a was bombarded during the 9th and forenoon of the lUth April, and at about noon on that day was taken by storm. 1 he place is said to have been obstinately defended, and there was considerable loss on both sides. Ibraheem-bin-Keis was himself at Rustak, organising, it was said, a descent on Muscat. Her Majesty's ship Ready returned to Muscat during the night of the 10th April, bringing some 21 wounded men from Mesna'a, who were immediately sent to the civil hospital. The crew of Her Majesty's ship Ready made a subscription on board for the wounded, for which act of kindness His Highness desired his thanks to be conveyed to Com mander Edwards and those under his command. His Highness Seyyid looikee returned the following morning, and immediately visited the wounded in hospital. Some of the Hindu merchants at Mesna'a complained that the Sultan's soldiers had pillaged some of their property. A lepiesentation was made to His Highness Seyyid Toorkee, who replied lat a fortnightly notice had been given them to clear out, and their c aims were disallowed. A certain amount of prestige has, doubtless, accrued to His Highness Seyyid Toorkee from the successful termination or these operations. ^ Ma y a collision was expected to occur between ie Beni Jabir (Ghafree) and Beni Booaha (Hinawee) in Wadi Samaeel in consequence of the former having destroyed some date trees belonging o the iatter. These two tribes are always at feud. On 30th MayRESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE 1882-83. Seyyid Feisnl proceeded to Samaeel to mediate between them, and, hav ing succeeded iu patching up a peace, returned to Muscat on 12th June. 4. The death of Ali-bin-Saeed, brother of Hamood.bin-Saeed, was reported during this month, but turns out to be incorrect. 5. On the 21st June it was rumoured that Seyyid Abdool Azeez, the Sultan's brother, with a large force, accompanied by Hamood-bin-Saeed-al- Jahafee, Sheik of a section of the A1 Waheebeh and a notorious robber, had got through the pass of 'Ak, one of the two passes practicable for animals leading from the Sharkeeyeh, for the guardianship of which the tribes inhabiting these passes, the Nidabee-een and Rahbee-een, were subsidised by Seyyid Toorkee. On the 22nd June information was received that Seyyid Abdool Azeez and Hamood were at Wuteiyeh, about 6 miles from Muscat and 3 miles from Muttrah, and on the morning of the 23rd June a letter was received from Abdool Azeez in reply to a communication from Major Grant, saying that he intended attacking Muttrah and Muscat, and requesting that British subjects be warned to remove themselves and property. On the following day, 24th June, Her Majesty's ship Arab, Commander Stopford, came into port. Her arrival tended much to allay the fears of the British Indian subjects, and in course of the same day a message came from Hamood-al Jahafee to the Sultan expressing a desire to come into Muscat and treat, if he were given safe conduct under the protection of Sheik Yoosif of the Beni-bu-Ali, Nasir Juweizanee, a Wahabee Chief, Shamis bin Hasan al Amaree, and Nasir-bin-Hamaid, Sheik of the Beni Hasan. On the following morning these Sheiks were sent to Wuteiyeh, and before noon returned, bringing with them Hamood-al-Jahafee, who returned to Wuteiyeh the same evening, having received a present. On the 28th June the following terms were come to : Seyyid Abdool Azeez to receive a monthly allowance of £200, Saleh-bin-Ali, who was included in the arrangements, £50 a month. Hamood-al-Jahafee got a present ot money and rice, with permission to visit Muscat once a year with 50 followers, to receive presents of course. Upon these terms Seyyid Abdool Azeez retired to Semed, where he still is, and Hamood went to the Wudi Marawal to collect some money owing to him. The whole force of Seyyid Abdool Azeez and Hamood only amounted to some 80 men of the Al Waheebeh, but, by allowing none of the country-people to come near their position, they managed to conceal their true numbers, which were consequently magnified by report into many hundreds. 6 In July Seyyid Feisul was sent to punish the Sheik of the Nidabee- een (Suleim-bin-Seif), who had given Seyyid Abdool Azeez passage through the pass of 'Ak; on his approach, however, Suleim went to Abdool Azeez and Saleh-bin-Ali, who sent letters to both His Highness Seyyid Toorkee and Seyyid Feisul, declaring that they would resent his being molested, and, on the receipt by Seyyid Feisul of the letter to his address, he immediately returned to Muscat. The reason assigned for the defection of the Nidabee-een on this occasion was that the inhabit ants of a small date plantation, named Saroor, at the foot of the pass, who had hitherto been considered as allied to the Nidabee-een, vvere given recognition by His Highness Seyyid Toorkee as belonging to the Beni Jabir, whom they preferred, thus giving the Beni Jabir a piepon-20 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN Gl'LF POLITICAL derance of strength at the cost of the Nidabee-een. This at any rate was their excuse, but I think the true source of their disaffection is to be found in the usual fickleness of the 'Omdnees. 7. For the remainder of the official year, the tranquillity of the country generally remained undisturbed. 8. On the 16th August Seyyid Mahomed, Wali of Sohar, His Highness Seyyid Toorkee^s eldest son, came to spend the ^Eed of Ramad- zan in Muscat; he returned to Sohar on the 26th August. 9. In the beginning of October, a Sindhee, named Ismaeel Eesa, was robbed at Muttra in open day by some Wahabees, and was further insulted and threatened in presence of Seyyad Feisul by a Sheikh of the Wahabee mercenaries. After some pressure His Highness Seyyid Toorkee imprisoned the Sheikh for 10 days and made him pay $13 to the Sindhee by way of compensation. The other offenders, however, escaped. 10. During this month Saleh-bin-Ali (A1 Harith) of Ibra asked per mission to visit the Sultan in Muscat, accompanied by 150 followers. His Highness declined the proposed visit. 11. About this time also the Makabeel and Naeem were reported to be devastating the country about Sohar, not, however, from any political motive, but solely for the sake of plunder. 12. On the 4th November, Seif-bin-Musin (Beni Hina), commander of the garrison (composed of Beni Hina) of the strong fort of Hazam in the Batineh, which for the last 12 years has belonged to Ibraheem-biu- Keis (Alboo Saeed), returned from a visit to Hilal-bin-Zahir (Beni Hina), (one of the most leading men in the country) at Nezwa, and im mediately turned the wife and all the servants of Ibraheem-bin-Keis out of the fort. Hilal-bin-Zahir, who was undoubtedly at the bottom of the affair, wrote to His Highness Seyyid Toorkee, that if he would give him active support, he would also seize the fort of Rastak, which was then garrisoned by the Deni Hina; but Ibraheem-bin-Keis, on hearing what had occurred at Hazam, called upon the Beni Rooaha to take the places of the Beni Hina in Rastak, which they did without any collision occurring, and Hilal s opportunity was lost. His Highness Seyyid loorkee endeavoured to get Hazam made over to him, but in January 1833, through the mediation of the very learned Mahomed-bin-Suleiyim (A1 Gharabee) and influence of the Yal Sad, the fort was restored to Ibiaheem-bin-Keis by the Beni Hina, and is now garrisoned by his dependants. 13. On the 9th January 1883 His Highness Seyyid Toorkee pro ceeded to Gwadur for change of air and returned on the 30th January, having benefited by the change. tj ^i 8 mon ^h a fight took place near Ibra between A1 ar 1 lt j 1 ^ Musakara, in which 15 men were killed on both sides. c -t wv 8 * eil( ^ Januar y a letter arrived from Suleiman-bin- buweilim, Wali of Dhofar, saying that the people of Dhofar (Awameer, e ' 1 1 a , - besieged the fort and asking for reinforcements, and on the 1' tli February His Highness sent 70 men and a 10-pounder gun to Uhotar, but in the meantime the fort having proved impregnable, the baclr ^ 6611 raiS an&lt; ^ ^e reinforcements were therefore sentdpi] V- ilil'j i || RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1882-83. 21 16. On the evening of the 6th March an attempt to shoot Mahomed- bin-Juma, brother of Ali-bin-Juraa, one of His Highnesses most confiden tial servants, was made by a Rahbee in charge of the Sedab gate on account of some private quarrel. The Rahbee was afterwards seized and imprisoned, 17. Since the seizure of the fort of Hazam by the Beni Hina, corre spondence of a friendly nature had been passing between His Highness Seyyid Toorkee and Ibraheem-bin-Keis which led to a monthly allowance of $ 100 being offered to, and accepted by, Ibraheem-bin-Keis, in March.

The author of the ' KesJif^d-Ghummeh 1 ' brings the 'Annals of 'Oman ' down to the year A. D. 172S, when, on the death of the (ihafiree Imam, Mohammed-bin-Nasir, the Ya'Arabeh Imam, Seyvid Seyf-bin-Sultan, was restored to power. A narrative of subsequent events down to the death of the Seyyid Sa^eed-bin-Sultan was compiled by one Hamad-bin-Mohammed-bin-Razik, and translated by Mr. badger, and from that source much of the following summary is taken. No sooner had Seyf-bin-Sultan been installed than he was opposed by BePArab-bin Himyer, also of the Ya'Arabeh Seyf-bin-Snltan, family, and the latter was successful in some parts of ^Oman, and acknowledged by a portion of the population. This led to Seyf-bin-Sultan having recourse to the aid of foreigners, and a force of Persians having been sent, it is said, liy the Governor of F£rs, overran 'Oman and obtained possession of manv important positions, including Muscat and Ras-el-Khaimah. At that period Nadir Shah was King of Persia, but this expedition is not, I think, mentioned in the Persian history of those times. It may be that the Persian force was inconsiderable, as, owing to the distracted and divided state of 'Oman, a small army would probably easily be success- iul. About the same time a Persian force under Mirza Takee Khan, Governor of Fars, captured the islands of Bahrain, and it is not unlikely that, force, or part of it, which was subsequently engaged in 'Oman. The invasion of Bahrain took place in A. 1). 1735, and the expedition to 'Oman seems to have been later. At this juncture it was that the founder of the now reigning dynasty emerged from obscurity. Ahmed-bin-Sa'eed-bin Ahmed-bin-Moham med of the Al-Bu-Sa'fd family attracted the notice of the Imam Seyf, and was eventually appointed Governor of Sohar, where he became noted for his liberality and ability. The Imam became at one time jealous of his growing reputation, and endeavoured to seize him by treachery, but failed. He, however, obtained possession of his son Hilal, who, on the appearance of the Persians, was restored to his father. Seyf-bin-Sultan joined the Persian force at Ra&lt; el-Khaimah, whence they marched to Bereymee and El-Dhahireh, defeating the 'Oman tribes under Bel'Arab-bin-Himyer. They subsequently reached Muscat, via Nezwa, and are said to have committed great atrocities in their cam paigns, which lasted from 1736 to 17^8. After the experience of a first campaign the ^mam Seyf got disgusted with his Persian allies, and separated from them. This led to a reconciliation with Bel 'Arab- bin-Himyer, who resigned his own pretentions in favour of Seyf, with a view to united action against the common enemy, the Persians. Mean time the latter had divided their forces, one division of which was be sieging Sobar, another before Batka, and a third at Bahla in the interior. The two latter divisions were forced to retreat to Ras-el-Khaimah, the 1 a translation of this history executed by the undersigned was printed hy the B- A. Society of Bengal in 1874.

This was the position of affairs when a part of the population deposed the Imam Seyf-bin-Snltan, and elected Sultan-bin-Murshid, also a Ya'Aribee, in his stead in 1738. Sultan-Bin-Murshid proceeded to operate against Seyf-bin-Sultan, and wrested from him Muscat and other places ; Sultan-bin-Murslud, whereupon Seyf again Joined the Persians at Imam ' Has-el-Khaimah. The Persians recommenced operations and captured Muscat, and laid siege a second time to Sohar. Finding them faithless to their promises, Seyf once more withdrew, and shortly afterwards died in retirement at El-Hazm. The Imam Sultan-bin-Murslnd fore 3d his way through the Persian forces into Sohar, but was wounded in doing so, and died in Sohar. Thus terminated the rule of Ya^Arabeh in ^Oman. Having succeeded in defending Sohar against the Persian, Ahmed- bin-Sa^id concluded a convention with the Persian invaders, according to which they were to depart unmolested from 'Oman. This convention was violated by Ahmed, who is said to have massacred a number of the Persians of 'Oman. The reputation and popularity acquired by Ahmed-bin-Sa'eed led to his being elected Imam in A. I). 1741, and the Al-Bu-Sa'eed has since been the reigning family of 'Oman. This Imam's reign may be considered one of the most successful re corded in the annals of 'Oman, and it lasted for The Imam Ahmed-bin- thirty-four years. Imam Ahmed's sway was Sa'eed. established over all the districts of 'Oman from the east coast to El-Bereymee. He was at the outset opposed by Bel' Arab-bin-Himyer, Ya'Arabee, whom he defeated and slew. The demands of the Persians for tribute were refused by Ahmed-bin- Sa'eed. In A. D. 1770, a naval demonstration was made from Muscat against Bushire, but was a failure. For some years desultory hostilities had taken place between the Persians and 'Omanees, and in 1775, when Busrah was attacked by a Persian fleet of boats, the Imam Ahmed sent a Muscat fleet to the rescue, which succeeded in dispersing the Persian boats and provisioning Busrah. This led to friendly relations between Turkey and 'Oman. On the recovery of Busrah from the Persians, in the time of Kurreem Khan, and the loss of Bahrain by the Persians, the power of the latter was finally broken in the Persian Gulf, and a period of much confusion ensued, each petty State contending for power. During these disturb ances Imam Ahmed remained neutral and refrained from interference in the affairs of the Persian Gulf. He, at one period of his reign, suffered reverses in EI-Dhahireh at the hands of the Ghafiree tribes, the hereditary opponents of his race. Towards the close of his reign, the Imam Ahmed had to deal with a rebellion raised by his fourth and fifth sons, Seyf and Sultan, who, after having b( en once forgiven, renewed the conflict and seized the Muscat forts. This quarrel was also made up, but soon after those young men seized their elder brother Sa'eed and imprisoned him. The Imam, on hearing this, marched with a force from El-Bastak on Muscat and hostilities ensued, in the course of which Seyyid Sa'id escaped to bis father. A force of Arabs from the north-west of 'Oman, taking advantage of this strife, besieged El-lvastak, and this caused the rebel- Mll ||[ | si Its 124 ADMINISTBATION REPORT OP THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL lious sons of the Imams to come to terms. This reconciliation restored peace to the country. The Imam Ahmed died in 1875 at El-Rastak, and, owing to the ill- health of the elder son Hilal, Sa'eed, the second son, was elected Imam. Sa'eed-bin-Ahmed was the last of the elected 'Imams' of 'Oman. He spent most of his life in retirement at El- Ahmed Sa ' eed bin ' Rastak, allowing others to administer the affairs of the country. For some time Khalfan-bin- Mohammed, Al-Bu-Sa'eedee acted as his agent at Muscat, whilst his brother Kais-bin-Ahmad was Governor of Sohar. The Imam's son Hamad ousted Khalfin from Muscat, and became virtually the ruler of 'Oman till his death, which occurred in 1792. The Imam Sa'eed then appointed his second son Ahmed Governor of Muscat, resuming his retired life at El-Rastak, whence he never again emerged. He died during the reign of Sa 'eed-bin-Sultan. In the year l/9&lt; Sultau-bin-Ahmed, brother of the Imam, sue- PcTridSultin-bin-Ahmed. firing and Mattrah and established his authority over most of Oman, being generally recognized as its ruler, though without the religious title which was borne still by Sa'eed. The rulers of 'Oman 1 henceforth bore only the title of ' Seyyid ' (Lord). Seyyid Sultan soon became engaged in hostilities with certain mari time tribes of the Persian Gulf, and he was threatened with an attack by the Persians. Having concluded a peace with the Jowasim chief, Seyx id Sul an threatened Busrah on aecouat of some long-standing claims on the Government of that Tuikish port. Meantime, in A. D. 1|9S, the British Government entered into a com ention with Seyyid bultan, whereby the French were to be excluded from his territories. In the following year Seyyid Sultan, in alliance with the Govern ment of Fars, attacked and oc^cupied the Bahrain islands, then in pos session of ot the Ki- I toob Arabs, and placed his son Salim there as Go\ernor. The El- I t&lt;K&gt;b, however, shortly aftef recovered their inde- IKndence and expelled Seyyid Salim. In I SCO, a second convention 1 was concluded between the British Government and Seyyid Suit An, and in the same year the Wahabees of ejd mvaded El- Dhahirah and occupied the fortress of El -Berevmee.

The ports of Gwadur and Charbar on the Mekran coast were also acquired by Seyyid Sultan. On the death of Seyyid Sultan, his sons Salim and Sa^eed became joint rulers of 'Oman, Muscat being now the recognised capital. Their uncle Sa'eed continued to hold the title of 'Imam' and to reside at Rastak, but the temporal power had passed from him. It may be noted that the title ' Sultan,' which is now applied to the rulers of 'Oman, has never been generally employed by the 'Omanees to their rulers; it is really, as applied to them, of foreign origin- Although Seyyid Salim was the elder son of Sultan, and nominally -joint ruler, he appears to have yielded precedence to his younger brother Sa'eed, who really administered the affairs of the government. Of the elder branches of the family of the Imam Ahmed-bin-Sa'eed, Seyyid Kais -bin-Ahmed was Governor of Sohar at the time of the succession of Seyyids Salim and Sa'eed, and their cousin Bedr-bin-Seyf, who was engaged in an unsuccessful rebellion in the time of Seyyid Sultan, had taken asylum with the Wahabee Ameer. A Wahabee garri son garrisoned El-Bereymee, and the province of El-Dhahirali was virtually independent of Muscat. Seyyid Keis lost no time in opposing his nephews and succeeded in taking possession of several places on the Batinah coast, and Seyyids Salim and Sa'eed were forced to have recourse to their cousin Bedr-bin Seyf, who, from his influence with the Nejdian Ameer, was able to obtain the aid of a Wahabee force. Civil war was waged between the two factions for some years with varying success. Eventually Seyyid Keis was restricted to Sohar. The power and influence acquired by Seyyid Bedr-bin-Seyf, and his position with the Wahabees, aroused the jealousy and apprehensions of Seyyid Saeed, who resolved to get rid of him, and murdered him, under circumstances of great treachery, at a place near Burka. 1 his event led to a reconciliation between Seyyid Sa'eed and his uncle Seyyid Keis. And the two, in alliance, engaged in an attack on the Jowasim at Khor Fakan, on the Batinah coast, on which occasion the Seyyids wera defeated, and Keis slain. His sou Azzan then became Governor of Sohar under the protection of Seyyid Sa'eed. In the year 1806, during the ascendancy of Bedr-bin-Seyf, the British and Muscat naval forces acted in concert against the Jowasim pirates. In 1808 the Wahabees established their influence as far as Muscat and commenced to propagate their tenets forcibly ; a certain amount of British support was accorded to the Muscat State, but it was not thorough and so unavailing to repress the Wahabee aggressions, and in 1810 the Wahabee Ameer Su'ood's sons and his agent Mutlak-el- Muteyree overran •'Oman to its eastern shores, and the Seyyids of 'Oman were obliged to consent to pay a yearly ' zakdt,' or tribute, to the Wahabee Ameer. The subsequent reverses of the Wahabees relieved 'Oman from their aggressions for a period of some twenty years. Seyyid Sa'eed (for his brother Salim appears to have taken little or no share in the government) was chiefly engaged at this period of his reign in fighting the Jowasim, and on two occasions, in 1811 and 1815, attacked Bahrain, but without any good result to himself. On the26 ADMINISTUATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL Rooond occasion, he was signally defeated, and his younger brother Hamed killed. In 1819 Seyyid Sa'eed co-operated with the British force which acted against the Jowasim of Kas-el-Khaimah under Sir W. Grant Keir. In 1820 a small British force suffered a disaster in Ja'alan. The Beni-Bu-'Ali tribe of Ja'alan had embraced the Wahabee faith and renounced allegiance to Seyyid Sa'eed; they had also en-aged in the plunder of certain vessels. A messenger, who had been sent ashore at Soor by the British Political Officer, having been murdered, that officer proceeded to tiike active measures and landed at Soor a force of 380 sepoys and 4 guns These were joined by Seyyid Sa'eed in person, at the head oi 1 ,000 Arahs of different tribes. This foree advanced on the position of the Beni-Bu-^Ali, but, on being attacked by the latter gave way, and nearly the whole detachment and all the officers were slam. In 1821 a larger British expedition, under Sir Lionel Smith, pro- ceeded to Ja'alan to retrieve the honour of the British arms On this occasion 500 of the Beni-Bu-'Ali were killed, and the remainder made prisoners and taken to Bombay. Subsequently the prisoners were restored to their country, and a sum of money given to them to enable them to rebuild their houses. i i 1 t i ie I e v Se ^ ld S ® 1,m die(J - Previously the Imam Sa'eed d,ed ** n-astak, and the title was not claimed by, nor conferred od , any other member of the Al-Bu-Sa'eed family. 1 Li 1^28 Seyyid Sa'eed once more attacked Bahrain, but suflfered defeat and returned to Muscat. It is recorded that in the year 1829 Seyyid Sa'eed seized and im- prisoned his cousin Seyyid Hilal, the son of Mohammed-lbn-el-Imara Ahmed. Ihe j^rt of Soweyk, on the Batinah, had been assigned to that branch of the family as an appanage, and Seyyid Sa'eed seems to have ^suspected Hilal of disloyal designs. In the same year Seyyid 8a'eed proceeded to Zanzibar. He soon afterwards captured Mombasah from the Beni-Mezru a Arabs, the chief of which tribe he deported to Hormuz m the Persian Gulf. On leaving 'Oman for Zanzibar, Seyyid Sa'eed appointed his nephew Mohammed-bin-Sal im, all or Governor, of Muscat, with full power to administer the government of 'Oman generally. As soon as Sa'eed had sailed for Africa, disturbances broke out in the Batinah. A sister of Seyyid Hilal first raised the tribes about Suweyk to avenge the treacher ous seizure of her brother, and Soweyk fell into her hands. Encouraged by the success of this lady, Hamood bin-'Azz^n, a nephew of Seyyid Sa eed, moved on Sohar, and succeeded in recovering that hereditary appanage of his branch of the family of which he had soon ttr - by 1,8 ''t- Hamood ' P- s '-g his advantage, const and T'T 1 . 0ther the Batinah coast and the whole of that province was for the time lost to Seyyid foil^W ' a ™ od 1 even /^^Pted the capture of Muscat, and was onlv foiled by the timely arrival of a body of Ghatirees from the interior. At this junctui-e the British Government prepared to support the govern- 1 Except 'Arran.RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1882-83. 27 ment of Seyyid Sa^eed actively, and vessels of war were sent to Muscat with this object. In 1830 Seyyid Sa'eed returned to Muscat and at once proceeded against his nephew Hamood, but was unable to reduce Sohar and was obliged to conclude a treaty with Hamood, by which Sohar and some other districts were made over to the latter, who agreed to pay a yearly tribute of 8,000 German crowns. Early in 1831, however, Seyyid Sa'eed again attacked Hamood-bin- Azzan and invested Sohar. This campaign also resulted in disastrous failure, and, after having been obliged to renew the treaty of peace on nearly the same terms as before, Sa^eed returned to Muscat. Meantime Seyyid Hilal had been released, and his appanage of Soweyk restored to him. In 1832, Seyyid Sa'eed once more sailed for Zanzibar, leaving his son Hilal in charge of Muscat. Shortly after Su'ood-bin-Ali, another cousin, who was Wali of Burka, seized Hilal, but released him to ransom. At this juncture the Jowasim chief of Rds-el-Khaimah seized Khor Fakan and a strip of territory on the Batinah coast, which has since then remained in the hands of the Jowasim. In 1832 Seyyid Sa'eed returned from Zanzibar, and Su'ood-bin-Ali was transferred to Rastak. On the Seyyid's leaving again for Africa, he appointed his son Thoweynee to act for him. In the year 1833, the Wahabees menaced Muscat, and it was agreed that the Muscat Government should pay them a tribute of 5,000 German crowns per annum. During the following few years, there were continual struggles between Seyyid Sa'eed and his representatives, on the one hand, and Hamood-bin-Azzan, on the other, Hastak passing into the hands of the latter. An attempt was at one time made to set up Hamood as ' Imam,' but, after finally declining the office, Hamood retired for a time from public life, leaving his son Seyf in charge of Sohar. This youth, having thrown off his father's authority, was, in 1819, murdered at the instiga tion of Hamood, who resumed commaud of Sohar. Eventually Hamood was captured by Thoweynee-bin Sa'eed and died in captivity at Muscat. A brother of Hamood, however, Keis bin-Azzan, got possession of Sohar and held it against Thoweynee. On the return of Seyyid Sa'eed from Zanzibar he attacked Keis and ousted him from Sohar, conferring on him instead the fort of Rastak. Seyyid Sa'eed then appointed his son Toorkee, present Sultan of Muscat, Wali of Sohar. In 1852 'Abdullah, son of the Wahabee Ameer Feysal, threatened the Batinah coast, and the Muscat Government was compelled to agree to pay a tribute of 1 2,( 00 dollars a year, besides arrears. The Wahabees on this occasion agreed to render assistance to the Muscat Government in case of need. In 1852 Seyyid Sa'eed's officers were ejected from Bunder 'Abbas, Kishm, &amp;e,, which Muscat had held in lease from Fersia for about a ceu- tury, by the Persians, and Seyyid Sa'eed, hastily returning from Zanzibar, pent a force to Bunder 'Abbas, but he was obliged to patch up an arrangement with the Persians by which he received the lease of the districts on much more unfavourable terms than before.ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL In 1856 Seyyid Sa'eed died at the Seychelles islands on his way to Zanzibar at the age of 65 years.

It was agreed between the two that Seyyid Majid should compensate Seyyid Thoweynee for the superior richness of the Zanzibar inheritance by paying an annual sum of 40,000 dollars to Muscat, but Seyyid Majid having subsequentlv refused to abide by this agreement, Seyyid Thoweynee prepared to attack Zanzibar, which place the Arabs of the 'Oman could have easily subdued. The dispute was settled in 1860 by the arbitration of the British Government, which decided that the Ruler of Zanzibar should pay the Ruler of Muscat a yearly sum of 40,000 dollars without prejudice to the complete independence of the former. This decision was well received by both the brothers and continued to be acted on without interruptioa until the death of Seyyid Thoweynee. Meantime Seyyid loorkee, the third son of Seyyid Sa'eed, remained in his government of Sohar by no means satisfied with his position. He was pacified only through the mediation of the British Govern- ment. ^zzan-bin-Keis also caused uneasiness to Seyyid Thoweynee by his intrigues with the Wahabees, who, in 1865, overran'Oman to the eastern coast and plundered Soor. The British (Government there upon encouraged Seyyid Thoweynee to resist, to the best of his power, the aggression of the ^ ahabees, and His Highness proceeded to Sohar to make preparations. There, in 1866, he was murdered by his son Salim, who immediately rode to Muscat and seized the reins of power Seyyid Toorkee was rescued at Sohar by the opportune arrival of the British Resident, else he would probably have shared Thovveynee's fate. Seyyid Salim s title to be Ruler of 'Oman was quickly disputed by Seyyid-Salim-bin -lhowey- his uncle Seyyid Toorkee, who would doubtless nee . have succeeded but for certain interference on the paifc of tliG British (joveriiment, which had meantime (1^66) recognised Salim as liuler of 'Oman. After capturing Matrah in 1867, and reduc ing Salim to abject panic, Seyyid Toorkee was induced to accept a pension and reside in India. In October 1S68, Seyyid 'Azzan-bin-Keis, a bold and able leader, suddenly seized Muscat, and the Government of India having decided not to afford Salirn active assistance, the latter had to fly. Subsequent attempts of Seyyid Salim to recover 'Oman signally failed, and he died eventually of small-pox in Sind. Seyyid Azzan-bin-Keis proved a vigorous ruler, and reduced the whole Seyyid 'Azzau-bin-Keis country to obedience, ejecting the Wahabees T am i • j from Bereymee. He was, however, in the hands ot a bigoted priesthood headed by the'well-known Sa'eed-bin-Khalfan, Elkhaleylee, who was his chief adviser in all matters. The intolerance of the Mettowwas gave much offence in Muscat, and probably prevented the recognition of Seyyid 'Azzan's government by the British. By the priests Seyyid 'Azzau was formally proclaimed ' Imam ' of the true believers; meaning the Ibadhi sect, the only case in which the title has been used by rulers of 'Oman in recent times. In the beginning of 1870 'Abdullah-bin-Peysal, the WahabeeRESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1882-83. Ameer, prepared to re-occupy Bereymee, and ^Azzan-bin-Keis and his brother Ibraheem hastened to meet the danger. The Wahabees, how ever, retired to Nejd on account of difficulties in their rear. Seyyid Toorkee, who was now free to act in ^Oman, thinking the time favourable, appeared on the scene, and landed on the so-called ' pirate coast' in the spring of 1870. On this occasion Seyyid Toorkee was unsuccessful and obliged to return to Bunder ■'Abbas, but in Sep tember, the same year, he again landed in ■'Oman, and defeated ^Azan- bin-Keis at Dhank in El-Bhahirah with heavy loss. Seyyid Toorkee then proceeded himself to the south-east of 'Oman, gathering considerable forces as he went. Of these he placed a portion under command of Seyf-bin Suleiman, Chief of the Beni-Riyam. In January 1871 Seyf-bin-Suleiman attacked Matrah, and ^Azzan- bin-Keis, having fallen in the encounter, Matrah and Muscat fell into the hands of Seyyid Toorkee's adherents. Seyf-bin-Suleiman, the victorious leader, was also killed on this occasion. The accession of Seyyid Toorkee was generally popular in 'Oman, , the tribes having somewhat resented the vigor- Se„id Toorkee-bin-Sa eed, ^ centralizing policy adopted by Se y y i d 'Azzan and El-Khaleylee. The latter person died a few days after the capture of M uscat in confinement. ^ The leader of the ^Azzan faction was thereafter Ibraheem-bin-Keis, who, for some time, maintained himself in Sohar. During the next few years desultory efforts were made by the late Saltan Seyyid Salim, and by Seyyid 'Abdul 'Azeez, a younger brother of Seyyid Toorkee, to oust the latter. These proceedings led to both princes being arrested on the sea by British authority, and detained in Sind, where Seyyid Salim died in 1876. Seyyid 'Abdul Azeez was subsequently invited by Seyyid Toorkee to return to Muscat to assist him in the administration, but jealousies soon arose, and the plan was unsuccessful. Seyyid Toorkee, feeling his position embanassing, letired temporarily to Gwadur, on the Mekran coast, leaving Seyyid Abdul 'Azeez to deal with the affairs of the State. Ihe latter, having scanty funds at his disposal, and being besides naturally less open-handed than Toorkee, soon became unpopular and encountered opposition. Seyyid Toorkee returned suddenly to Muscat in his brother s absence, and resumed the reins of government. 'Abdul 'Azeez retired to theintenoi, where he awaits an opportunity of possessing himself of the chief power. During Sevyid Toorkee's reign, which has been the reveif-e or vl gp i ' ous, several attempts have been made to capture Muscat, in which Ibraheem-bin-Keis, Salih-bin-Ali, El-Harthee, and Seyyid Abdul Azeez have at times taken part; but these expeditions have not been conducted with much skill or earnestness. . Who will eventually establish his power in succession to the present Sultan cannot with any confidence be predicted. Seyyid loorkee s sons are young and inexperienced, and in Seyyid 'Abdul 'Azeez and beyvi Ibraheem they will have formidable rivals. There are not wanting also symptoms of plotting on the part of leaders of the Hinawee ac ion o 'Oman, with a view to a complete change of dynasty. E. C. ROSS. January, 1883. i30 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL PART III. REPORT ON TRADE OF THE PERSIAN GULF FOR 1882. A marked depression of the g-eneral trade in South Persia was observ able during the year 1881, which was partly attributable to overstocked markets, and partly to the impoverishment of the population from partial failure of the harvest in 1880. It was mentioned, also, in the report on the Trade of 1881, that failures had occurred amongst Persian merchants resulting from overtrading in previous years, combined with depreciation of Persian opium in China. The figures in the Bushire tables of exports and imports for the year 188^ shew an apparent recovery in the trade ; but, although the transactions were larger, notably in import of Manchester goods, they carried with them but small profits to the importers. Goods being imported in excess of the consumptive demand led to fluctuations in prices, and an unhealthy condition of trade. The further depreciation of opium abroad led to more failures in Persia, but, as the mercantile firms of Bombay to whose China branches most of the Persian opium was consigned, have now restricted finance facilities, it is probable that a less speculative trade in opium will obtain in future. It is thought that the import supply has continued to exceed the demand of the country, a state of affairs which has led to disappearance of adequate profits to traders, and which, if continuing, must lead to fur ther losses and failures. Shipments of wheat to Europe from Persian ports were on a moderate scale. Ihe population of the wheat-producing districts were remarkably prosperous, the prices of grain being exceptionally high in proportion to the season s yield. This exjKH't trade is hampered by frequent, rather unseasonable prohibitions imposed by the Persian Government, and also by the practice in vogue amongst the cultivators of adulterating the wheat by mixing it with barley. In some instances one half a lot con sists of barley. A considerable increase occurred in 1882 of import of metals, which is attributable to a more prosperous condition of the ryots. European liquors and mineral oili are becoming more in demand. A considerable export trade in Persian tobacco has sprung up of late yea i s and is increasing. 'Ihe tobacco is largely shipped to Syrian and 0 1 mi n I'O'ts since the prohibitive tariff has been removed. Ihe trade of Lingah shows a falling off. This is to a great extent owing to the growth of a direct trade by steamers between Bombay and ahrain, the general trade of which place is increasing. '' ie pearl season of 1882 was unfavourable and disastrous to many o those engaged in the trade, so much so that capital is with difficulty rorthcommg for the operations of 1883. It seems probable that, as concerns the supply of the southern and central districts of Persia, foreign trade has nearly reached a limit whichRESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1882-83. 31 only increase of the population and general prosperity would enable it safely to overstep. i . i1 i n . i To enable goods from the south to compete in the markets ot the north of Persia^ better or shorter lines of communication would be indis pensable.

The accompanying' returns show a considerable increase both in Ex ports and Imports over those of last year. The date crop was excep tionally good and the amount of dates exported shows an increase of nearly two lacs of dollars over that of the preceding 1 year. There seems, however, to have been a good deal of speculation or over-trading, which, considering the difficulty of collecting outstandings from the Arabs, is certainly unwise, and a larger number of insolvencies than usual has been the result.
