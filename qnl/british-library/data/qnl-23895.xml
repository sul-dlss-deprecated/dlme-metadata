I sent a copy of your letter to Dr. Bertrarri for his ad vice and I now enclose herewith a copy of his reply The suggestions in this letter seem to us very useful and I should be glad to know whether you decide to pass them on to the Shaikh and if so what his reactions to them are. It may be that the question of the development of the Muscat fisheries d&gt;s one which affects both the Persian Gulf States and the whole of the south coast of Arabia and might, therefore, best be considered in the context of a general project in which all the states involved and His Majesty’s Government might participate; and it is possible that the Overseas Food Corporation or the Colonial Development Cor poration (from the point of view of Aden) might be induced to help. We hope to go into this question shortly with Dr. Bertram and with the Departments concerned here, with parti cular reference to the forthcoming visit to the Middle East of Dr. Finn, head of the Fisheries Department of FAO I will keep you fully informed on this matter. As you will see from a separate letter which we have sent to the Residency, you should very shortly be getting copies of Dr. Bertram’s Muscat report from the Sultan. Yours sincerely, C. WATER!OW. Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I.E., C.S.I.,COPY 7th March 1949. Ref. Your: E.2739/1951 /91 of 3.3.4 9. Dear Miss Waterlow, I refer to Sir Rupert Hay's query. My Muscat Report would not be of irrmediate value in sol ving the Bahrain problem but it should be enough to provide the Resident (who has seen it in typescript) with enough background information on fisheries to walk very warily. I have asked the Sultan, as an act of both courtesy and expe diency, to make copies available to the Resident as soon as the main stock reaches Muscat. The problem is the same as that which besets the A.I.O.C. at Abadan, namely a greatly increased population which has far outstripped local fishery resources. The A.j.O.C. asked me for advice on the subject both in 1944 and in 1948. They have made some progress, mainly by the better organization of local fishermen and by guaranteed prices for the catch. Ample ice too is made available. Men from further afield are attracted and so augment the local fishing labour force. The problem however has far from yet been solved. Sir Rupert is now proposing that the local Shaikh should fall into the same error as has the A.I.O.C., though the lat ter had far greater justification. Because in north west Europe trawlers are the standard large scale fishing instrument, our administrators and others overseas expect them to catch fish in tropical waters. I can think of no really successful tropical fishery anywhere based on trawling. A.I.O.C. has carried out experimental work with a trawler at the head of the Gulf with extremely disappointing results, though it is said that hospitals at Basra in 1918 were supplied with trawl fish. The people of Bahrain should NOT embark on trawling until and unless the A.I.O.C. prove it feasible. The Persian Gulf is too infested with coral anf far too many of the fish prefer to swim on the surface. Fisheries development at Bahrain is most unlikely to be possible except by slow stages, by the employment of competent technical fisheries officers, erperimental work and so on. The problem will be rendered more difficult by the fact that probably already fishing labour is attracted from the sea by more lucra tive employment ashore. To obtain quickly substantially greater quantities of fish at Bahrain involves the same method as I have advocated to A.I.O.C. namely to go down to the Gulf of Oman and Muscat waters for it: that is to say seek supplies in the nearest area which is extra- ordinarly productive of fish already (in a way which the Persian Gulf itself is not) and which has already a large export trade in fish because production greatly exceeds even the enormous local demands. Reading of my Muscat report should make this abundantly clear. If the Shaikh of Bahrain has money enough let him fit out a refrigerating and cold storage vessel with the aid of compe tent low temperature engineers, and then send it down to Muscat waters for fish. In Muscat waters either labour would have to be organised to supply fresh fish over the side for quick freez ing aboard, or a freezing plant would have to developed ashore by a suitable agent and the frozen fish collected in bulk at intervals by the Bahrain cold storage vessel. /IfIf one or other of the great oil companies and/or the Shaikh of Bahrain would put up a plan, and the necessary funds and technical experience for large scale fish freezing and stor age in Muscat (or on the Batinah coast), that would in my view be the proper solution. The Sultan of Muscat would see the start of modern fishery development which he desires, and great quan tities of high grade fish could be merde available at the head of the Persian Gulf and at Bahrain. Alternatively lower grade dried or salted fish products could be obtained from Muscat by simple organization and purchase. 4 that is the position as I see it. I hope some such deve lopment will take place. The Gulf of Oman is a fish-exporting area: the adjacent Persian Gulf now needs to be a fish-impor ting area - though that should not prevent the inevitably slow development of the Persian Gulf's own resources. I am certainly glad to help in any way I can. Yours sincerely, (G.C.L. BERTRAM) Miss C. Waterlow, Foreign Office, Whitehall, W.l.@ PERSONAL .

I spoke to King-Webster about this case and his advice was the same 'as Bertram’s. He said that the only sensible course for the Bahrain Government to follow was to purchase a depot ship with cold storage, which might cost up to £ 100 , 000 , and send it to purchase fish direct from the fishermen in the Gulf of Oman. It would be necessary to offer them fixed prices and avoid bargaining, or else to offer them goods in exchange for the fish. I doubt, however, if the Muscat Government would approve of t the latter course. It will be essential for cold storage to be available in Banrain for storing the fish on arrival there. This method of collecting fish is at present being carried outPERSONAL No.C/L-136 POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN, The 17th April, 1949 The undermentioned paper is forwarded The Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Bahrain* (SD.)

I fancy that an offer of about £15,COO would buy her. Her name is ,, Derna M and she is owned by the creditors of the East African Fishing Co. Ltd. Mombassa. This news might be of interest. Yours sincerely, Sd. C.F. HICKLING. MISS C. WATERLOWcipy Colonial Office, Sanctuary Buildings, Great Smith Street, S.W.l. 19888/80/49 23rd April, 1949. Dear Miss Waterlow, Dr. Hickling has now returned from his tour of the Best Indies and I have shown him your letter to Mr. Locke, Ministry of Agriculture, of the 3rd March (£*2739/1351/91) about the Bahrain fisheries. Dr. Hickling says that the Anglo-Iranian oil Company at Abadan have been operating a small iefrigerated trawler, but with very poor results. There may be fish in the deeper waters of the Persian Gulf (see Blegoad - Fishes of the Iranian Gulf, Copenhagen, 1946) and if Bahrain can afford it, they mights consider chartering an oil-fired steam trawler (or diesel trawler) with crew, for a six months survey.^ The cost would be about £20,COO, less the value of any fish caught, and it is assumed that ice will be available, in quantities of 20 tons at a time at weekly intervals, for such a ship. There are a number of oil-fired steam trawlers at Cardiff (Neale &amp; West Limited, Wharf St., Cardiff), Milford Haven (Secretary, Milford Haven Trawler Owners * Association, Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire) and ileetwood (Secretary, Fleetwood Fishing Vessel Owners' Association, Dock St., Fleetwood, Lancashire); and, as some of the linns' ships are not doing very well, it might be possible to hire one. There is also a Hull trawler called the ,, Derna M which has been refitted for tropical fishing. It has been operating in East African waters with very poor results and is now laid up at Mcmbassa where, we understand, it has been attached for a debt and is now for sale. This vessel might be examined to see whether it is suitable for work at Bahrain. Yours sincerely, Sd. R.H. BURT.© A No.1578 POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN, The 22nd June* 1949.

Rowe who informed us that he intended setting up an organisation to Investigate the possibilities of commercial fishing in the Persian Gulf. From his conversation we gathered that he had himself formerly been a professional fisherman and was about to leave his present employment with ARAMCG for a Partnership with one or more other ex employees of Aramco in a Venture to be called 'The Persian Gulf Associates'. Mr. Rowe has apparently done some initial 'Prospecting' and has told us that the inaications are favorable. He is purchasing a motor launch from The Mercury Boat Lines for immediate purposes and re understand that one of his Associates has investigated the building in United Kingdom of a trawling vessel having refrigerated space. It is apparently the .Intention to undertake fishing on a fairly large scale and perhaps erect a canning establishment in Bahrein. According to Mr. Rowe, the Adviser to the Bahrein Government has been kept fully informed and has given his approval to the Venture. Gray Mackenzie has been asked to undertake a certrin amount of Agency work for tho craft which Persian Gulf Associates may owns at the outset these duties will merely consist of giving assistance in a general manner at the various ports in the Gulf where such crafts may call.

We do not anticipate there would be any difficulty in financing the Company, and a number of Interested parties have already signified their willingness to take up substantial blocks of Shares. 3* The Company would be registered and managed under properly drawn Articles of Association, prepared by a competent firm of British Commercial Solicitors* /Oontd/2..» Sheet Two (So) 6 V The direction of the Conqpenj would he vested in a Board of Directors of British and Hus cat i Gentlemen, nominated by and representing the Interests of the various Shareholders* By this means full control could he exercised over the activities of the Company to comply with the special conditions apartaining to Muscat and Oman* 7* The size and scope of the project would he settled in consultation with your Government, after preliminary discussions with the interested parties. d.

Since we wrote this letter we have had further consul tations from tine to time with Captain Kendall who is, he tells us, making progress with his investigations regarding the development of the fisheries. His aim is to form a limited company in Muscat, in which the Sultan and local merchants would have shares, which would undertake the development and possibly also to form a similar company in Bahrain for the sale of fish and fish products there, and to contribute capital for the whole, operation. Captain Kendall thought that there was probably no precedent for the forma tion of such companies in these States and that it might be necessary for us to give assistance at some stage in persua ding the Rulers to agree to these plans. We have promised Captain Kendall that if, when the time comes, he needs our help we will consider his proposals sympathetically. He has, we understand, been in direct correspondence with ycu regar ding his forthcoming visit to Muscat*to discuss his plans with the Sultan and ascertain on what terms the latter might be prepared to grant a concession. 3. We shal be glad to have your views on these plans in due course, though you may wish to defer comment until ycu have talked them over with Captain Kendall. 4.
