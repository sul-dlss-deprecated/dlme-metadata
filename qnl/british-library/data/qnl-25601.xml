Mr. Marline) to Sir Edward Grey. —(Received February 1, 1916.) (No. 157.) Sir, Tehran, December 5, 1915. THE forecast which I made of Mustawfi-ul-Mamalek’s probable policy in my despatch No. Ill of the 2nd September has unfortunately proved only too true. He has been lavish in promises, but sparing of fulfilment, always alleging that to enable him to take any step whatever running counter to public opinion— i.e., to German interests—we must make some concession. Take, for instance, the dismissal of Mukhbir-us-Sultaneh from the governorship of Ears, which is, as a matter of fact, the only measure taken by the Government which can be described as anti-German, and is typical of their attitude throughout Mustawfi’s tenure of office. At his formal reception of the foreign representatives on the 20th August, the day after he assumed office, the Prime Minister informed me spontaneously that he recognised the necessity of recalling Mukhbir-us-Sultaneh, as the people of Ears were very discontented with him, and the Government intended to replace him by a more suitable man at once. I said that I was delighted to hear it, for, as his Highness well knew, we had been urging the necessity of that step for a long time past. I could not, of course, avoid mentioning the attack on the consulate at Bushire, but in doing so I purposely avoided saying that among the demands which His Majesty’s Government would make for satisfaction of the outrage would be the dismissal of Mukhbir-us-Sultaneh, so that Mustawfi could truthfully say to his Democrat supporters that his dismissal was not a concession to us in that connection. When I next saw the Prime Minister, however, it was abundantly cleur that the Democrat influences in Cabinet and Medjliss, and more particularly in the Government offices, were not going to allow him to meet us half-way, and the dismissal of Mukhbir- us-Sultaneh accordingly became the chief point in the settlement of the Bushire outrage. You are aware from my telegrams of the unsatisfactory arrangement finally reached, but, as the Government of India had decided against the use of force inland, there was no other course open but to try conciliatory means and to feign belief in the Government s good-will. The history of the moratorium points to exactly the same conclusion. The Persian Government put forward request after request which were one by one accorded by the two Powers, but when the arrangement was finally put into the shape which they described as essential in order to placate public opinion, no mention was made in the Persian note of acceptance of the implied condition attached by us to the subvention. On the contrary, the Minister for Foreign Affairs intimated that the Persian Govern ment were then disposed to enter into a discussion of an entente with us, by which Persia would in future adopt an attitude of benevolent neutrality in exchange for various concessions from us, which he summarily indicated under six headings. In fact, during this whole period from the 19th August, when the Mustawfi-ul-Mamalek took office, to the 2nd November, when the Russian troops started from Kazvin towards the capital, the policy imposed on the Cabinet by the Democrats and the gendarmerie, the real force behind them and the backbone of German intrigue, was to ask much and do nothing. So far as results are concerned, there was indeed little to choose between the Mustawfi regime and the preceding six weeks, when there was no Government at all. Mustawfi, himself, I believe, recognised the dangerous situation towards which Persia was drifting, and would have liked to do something to arrest it ; but he is terribly susceptible to what he calls public opinion, i.e., the opinion of the Democrat by whom he is constantly surrounded, and the views of the German-paid newspapers. He is also one of the least businesslike people in this unbusinesslike country, and can waste, as I know by painful experience, any number of hours in futile discussions, so that he allowed the whole work of the Ministry of the Interior (the portfolio of which he held) to slip into the hands of the Secretary-General, one Mirza Suleiman Khan, possibly the most active of the many pro-German Democrats with which the public service swarms. Thus the instructions sent to the provinces at my [2546 a—1] — B2 request were usually drafted by Suleiman Khan, and so drafted ;\s to convey to the fg] recipient the impression that they were not to be taken seriously. Thus Kavam-ul- | ]y[ ( Mulk, who was, in accordance with my demands, appointed temporary Governor of Fars on the 16th September, and Soulet-ed-Dowleh were constantly left in doubt ns tg_ ^^im the Government’s real wishes, while the gendarmerie, on the other hand, werT 1 ^hoi encouraged by Suleiman to continue their attitude of defiance towards the Governor, and crave Wassmuss and his cut-throats every assistance and protection. wi In Ispahan, where the Bakhtiaris might very well have taken effective measures, rei the khans were invited to assemble a force, but again the vacillating conduct of p 0 Mustawfi prevented any real measures being taken. Similar weakness on the part of ]y[j the Prime Minister was exhibited when our consuls attempted to return to Kirmanshah, p r( and a very dangerous situation was allowed to develop at Sultanabad, Yezd, and £ n Hamadan. All this time the Germans were straining every nerve to import arms, ammunition, bombs, machine guns, &amp;c., into the country before the fall of Bagdad c ] e should close the road via Kirmanshah, and were also augmenting the number of their f th agents, Turkish and German, while with the help of the Persian foreign Office and the etr Karguzar at Meshed, Austrian prisoners of war were being smuggled across tbe frontier ]rK from Transcaspia and on to Tehran and other centres of German activity. in On our side it was difficult to take effective action. We had, it is true, our on newspaper organs, and one of them, the “ Asr-i-Jadid,” most ably and loyally conducted f th by Matin-us-Sultaneh, has done a great deal to open the eyes of the public, not in Tehran only, but all over the provinces, to the perilous position to which “ neutrality ” de was leading the country. But this sort of influence, valuable as it was, could not alone w f prevail against German methods. G&lt; Neither the Bussian Minister nor I had sufficient money at our command to work on the same lines as the enemy, nor had we the agents to carry out such a scheme, and hif even if attempted we should have found it frustrated by the gendarmerie. Our only Fc course was to endeavour to retain the loyalty of our old friends in the provinces, or Sr rather to prevent them from going over to the enemy, who were working very actively M to seduce them from us, and who it seemed certain were achieving a certain measure of ul success among the more ignorant and venal of the minor khans and sub-tribes. To pr prevent the great tribal chieftains from coming under German influence so long as war an was not declared, and thereby to delay that eventually was as much as I could hope to ul do ; for-it was perfectly clear that whatever engagements their chieftains might have th entered into with us, and whatever promises we might have made to secure their of loyalty, they would not, in the event of war, throw in their lot with us, uidess we were w? prepared to give them effective military assistance and protection. Considering the en means they have of judging of the great struggle going on in Europe and the knowledge G&lt; of what they stood to lose if, without active assistance from us, they espoused our G&lt; cause against their own sovereign, I can well sympathise with their attitude. Even br the Bakhtiari khans, with whom we have had closer relations than with any other in chieftains except Sirdar Arfa, said quite openly that they would place their loyalty to w&lt; the Shah before their friendship with us. We might prevent them from attaching themselves to the Germans, but we could not bind them detinitely and in all circum- L( stances to ourselves. The Bakhtiaris were of course my first pre-occupation. The attitude cr of the khans here, though not always quite satisfactory, was friendly enough, but at ju Ispahan the passive attitude of the Governor and other khans in the face of the active pr German propaganda had allowed a dangerous situation to develop, culminating on the wi 2nd September in the attempt on the life of His Majesty’s consul-general. Mr. Bristow’s b} mission to the Bakhtiari khans must, I suppose, be considered a failure ; but in the w circumstances, as we afterwards know them to exist, I think success was scarcely possible. w A reign of terror had practically been created. Akbar Mirza, on whose co-operation I o\ had largely counted in sending Mr. Bristow, was plainly warned that he would pay for -h it with his life if he used his influence against the Germans, and had escape from the town be secretly at night, while the Bakhtiaris—in the absence of direct orders from the Government—had no stomach for a conflict with the formidable force that the Germans d had collected. It is beyond qestion that some of the khans, possibly all of them, had made acquaintance with the colour of German gold. So bad was the position, that Captain Killander informed Mr. Grahame and ^ Mr. Hildebrand that their lives were in imminent danger, and as you are aware, the two 1U consuls with their colonies and the French residents left- the town on the 14th September. \ sc This unprecedented step had, on tbe whole, good results, for if, on the one hand, it gave w practical proof of the strength the Germans had acquired, it also taught more sensible as people of the danger of allowing it to increase still further, while the mercantile classes 111( 2 ) ) the m-ul- or of as to weiv / 3rnor, sores, ct of irt of ishah, , and arms, igdad their d the mtier 3, our ucted iot in dity ” alone work e, and r only 3es, or tively ure of i.

Moreover, Mr. Bristow’s mission had a certain effect, for though the khans at Ispahan did not care from sheer fright of the Germans to meet his advances, there was ^immediately afterwards a very perceptible change in the attitude of the senior khans ^ Doth here and in the provinces. In another important quarter also I endeavoured to strengthen our position, namely with Soulet-ed-Dowleh. Quite early in the summer Nimtaz Khanoum—a somewhat remarkable personality if only for being the only woman who takes a public part^ in politics—who acts as Soulet’s confidential agent in Tehran, approached the Bussian Minister and me on his behalf, and as you are aware we eventually gave him letters of protection on behalf of our Governments. I believe that this measure, coupled with the financial inducements which Major O’Connor at Shiraz was authorised by the Government of India to hold out to him, was of the greatest value in keeping Soulet clear of German influences. Of Kavam-ul-Mulk I could be fairly sure, but it was of the greatest importance to prevent his great rival in South Persia from going into the enemy camp. That this has so far been achieved is clear from the fact that with the most lavish expenditure of money Wassmuss was never able to bring him over, things in Shiraz were bad enough, the British vice-consul, All Quli Khan Nawab, was murdered on the 7th September, a munshi of the consulate was w-ounded, and a gholam killed on the 23rd October, and on the 10th November His Majesty’s consul and the entire British colony were seized by the gendarmerie. The responsibility for all these deplorable events lies primarily with Mustawfi-ul-Mamalek, and in the second place with the gendarmerie. The gendarmerie has been wholly beyond the control of the Government for months past. When Farman Forma w’as Minister of the Interior in Ain-ed-Dowleh’s Cabinet, the commandant, Major Edwall, told me himself that he took his orders from Mouin-ul-Vizareh, the “chef de cabinet” of the Persian Minister of Foreign Affairs, and one of the most pestilent of the Germanophil party, and from Suleiman Khan, whom I have already had occasion to mention in this despatch. Ministers were perfectlv aware of this, but so pusillanimous a personage as Mustawfi- ul-Mamalek, whose respect of what these two German agents represent to him as being public opinion, could never take such a drastic measure as to dismiss Major Edwall or any of his subordinates, and so bring the Swedes to their senses. Consequently Kavam- ul-Mulk at Shiraz who, with Soulet-ed-Dowleh, might have very well have dealt with the local gendarmes, have been afraid to do so in the face of the orders from the Ministry of the Interior, i.e., Suleiman Khan, which the gendarmerie could always produce. It was the same in Kirman (where, however, Sirdar-i-Zafar Bakhtiari showed a decree of energv very gratifying when compared with the inertia and timidity of other Governors), in Sultanabad, Hamadan, and Yezd, and finally in Tehran itself. The Government blandly declined to admit that there was anything unusual in the situation ; but even while they denied notorious facts, they were palpably uneasy, there was, indeed, good reason for their apprehension—for by the middle of October the Germans were virtually masters of Tehran. Their headquarters were established in two houses adjacent to the American Legation, and here were stored large quantities of arms, ammunition, and bombs (fairly credible reports say 2,000 rifles and 3,000 bombs and grenades), while 300 yards away, just outside the town walls, were the “ barracks,” where some 200 escaped Austrian prisoners of war were lodged. In addition to this very useful European nucleus, there were a number, said to be some hundreds, of mujahids, recruited in German interests by such well-known ruffians as Sirdar-i-Mohi, Amir-i-Hishmet, and Ilussain Zadeh, which with 600-700 gendarmes, on whom the Germans could implicitly rely, formed, with resolute leaders, a force quite sufficient to overawe the timid Government presided over by Mustawfi-ul-Mamalek. Against it could be arrayed the Cossack brigade, say 500 men, and the police, 1,000 strong, under M. Westdahl; but the loyalty of both forces was more than doubtful and the latter, scattered as it necessarily was all over the town, would have been of little real avail had the Germans attempted a c0?-tp d’Etat. How the coup was to be carried out I do not know, but Colonel Edwall’s anxiety to ascertain what attitude the Armenians would adopt shows that he knew that some thing was anticipated. After the occurences at Sultanabad it seems quite possible that the plan was to kidnap M. de Etter or myself; at any rate, reports of an intended attack of this legation came in almost daily, and that they were not without some foundation in fact is evident from the fact that the German military attache, whom we had known very well at Constantinople, secretly sent a letter to my wife assuring her that he would give her warning of any attempt, as “ Germans do not make war on women and children ” ; while Assim Bey sat up all night, so he informedthe Spanish Minister, so as to be able to run to our assistance. This, however was some ten days later. On two occasions, also, M. de Etter and I were warned while at the Palace that it would be prudent to return home by a different route. Nevertheless, I cannot say that I had any special apprehension of an imminent German coup until on the 21st October I received from you, Sir, the information that the Oerman Government expected to conclude a convention with Persia within a few days. Your subsequent telegrams pointed to the conclusion that the signature of the alleged convention was only a matter of hours. Subsequent facts show that whatever lopes Germany may have had of concluding a convention, its realisation was still distant • hut at the ^ same time, although I and my Russian colleague were fairly well satisfied that the Prime Minister was no party to any such arrangement, the attitude of the Persian Government was more than dubious. They had just accepted our financial support in the shape of a moratorium, but in spite of their constant lamentations of the imperative want of money they did not draw on the moratorium credit account opened at the Imperial Bank of Persia in their favour. The obvious inference was that the Cabinet did not dare to commit themselves to us by acceptino- our money. ^ ^ » ^ al ' s ° ae ® ms .probable to me that the Germans, who must have known that the difficulties of Russia as regards the supply of munitions had been overcome, had got wind of the resolve of the new Viceroy of the Caucasus to deal militarily if necessary, with the Persian situation, and that they would anticipate any Russian action by a coup in Tehran which would entail a precipitate departure of His Majesty’s Mission from the capital. In these circumstances, and particularly in view of the repeated reminders you sent me of the necessity of preventing the archives from io! 1 o g in I ?^ G ? rn ? an hands ’ 1 caused the bound papers of the legation for the years 1912-1914 to be burnt. - J 1 am still wholly unable to understand why the Germans did not act. On a the W 1 h ° 1 le circu mstances, I am convinced that at any moment between the 18th October and the 6th November they could with the greatest ease and with a minimum of disorder have forced the Persian Government’s hand It is clear enough from the anxiety shown by Colonel Edwall to ascertain what the Armenian community would do in the case of disorders that something was anticipates, while a general sense of impending calamity pervaded the town, and a number of peop e talked of leaving Tehran. Thus Farman Farma began to ask me whether he should not accept the governorship of Khorasan ; Akber Mirza announced that the Zih-us-Sultan had telegraphed to him to go to Europe ; and a young Persian 7. Sma ! Khan .’ '' ho is wed known as a strong and useful Anglophile, disappeared for a ev\ days. As a matter of (act, however, I believe that the enemy missions were them selves as nervous as when in July on the news that a part of the Kazvin force had moves out of that town towards the east, they began hastily to pack their effects and hire transport. 1 can only imagine that they feared that the Russian troops mb-ht attempt to capture them. ^ ° On the 7th November the news that, while reinforcements were landing at Enzeli V KueS ' a k n troo F )S w f e moving eastwards from Kazvin, put a new complexion on a fairs Ihere was, of course the possibility that the Germans might chance an attempt, at the eleventh hour, but lodging from the panic which the movement of a few hundred men had produced in July when the German Minister packed up his onging foi instant flight, the contingency seemed fairly remote, the intelligence caused consternation to the Persian Government and Court but strangely enough at an audience which the Russian Minister had of the Shah to present his leuteis of credence on his definite appointment, no mention of the all-absorbino- M P d P Ftt mat t La r “G- 16 , afte . rnoon the Minister for Foreign Affairs called on M. de Etter and myselr at this legation to protest, and about 9 P.M. Shahab-ed-Dowleh came for the same purpose and remained till 1 a.m. Roth were told that in view of the attacks and murders committed on our consuls in all parts of Persia and of the o a allure on the part of the Persian Governments to take any measures whatever to protect them or to punish the aggressors, our Governments, seeing that there was a grave risk lest similar events should occur in the capital where 'the Germans were making quite unconcealed preparations for a coup of soine kind, had decided that it was ntcehsaiy to bring a small force closer to the capital for our protection. That was the • i o yect, and the advance of the troops implied no hostile design against Persia emer ^ e Capital exce py‘'‘ — ofdisorders 8 B u D th MmiSrs assuied us that the Persian Government would take every measure to secure our5 (S safety ; they promised that the German mujahids would be removed, that the arms and bombs would be seized, and that the Austrian prisoners of war would be removed to a safe distance from the capital and kept under strict surveillance. We said that ^such measures when carried out would no doubt reassure our Governments; but meantime the Government, with the gendarmerie notoriously in German pay, had no force to carry out such measures. We must also remind them once more that our Governments had certain information that the Germans expected to conclude a convention with Persia ; we were ready to believe that the Cabinet was innocent of this design; but what was to prevent the Germans from bringing off a coup d'Etat and putting in office a Cabinet of their friends pledged to sign a convention already prepared ? It was also rather suspicious that the Government was endeavouring to form a force here, which was to bo officered by Persians who had received their military education in Constantinople. It was scarcely likely that the new force would be inclined to act against the Germans, Austrians, and Turks. In the circumstances it was impossible for us to suggest to our Governments that the troops should be recalled to Kazvin. They would come as far as Keredj, 26 miles from Tehran and remain as long as the existing state of alfairs continued in the capital. Nothing, of course, was done by the Persian Government to fulfil their promises of protection, unless futile suggestions to the Austrian Minister for the removal of the Austrian prisoners of war are to be so reckoned ; rather the contrary, for the police force in the vicinity of the legation was sensibly diminished. However, a somewhat bantering letter from me to the Minister for Foreign Affairs produced a guard of “ sarbazes ” of the old regime armed with unserviceable rifles and one cartridge apiece ! This, I must say, was rectified the next day, when tolerably good rifles were served out, and inconveniently strict watch was kept round this and the other allied legations. Meantime in the enemy camp all was in commotion ; Prince Reuss, Assim Bey, and M. Logotheti began hastily to pack up such of their effects as remained in their houses and to transfer them to the United States and Spanish Legations or adjacent buildings rented for the purpose, while the arms, &amp;c., stored at the German military attache’s house were got ready for removal. On the 11th the wall separating the garden of the house taken by Prince Reuss from that of the American Legation was pulled down so as to allow instant access to the latter, and on the 13th a board bearing the words “ United States of America Legation ” was placed over the gate of the former. The gendarmerie was meanwhile collecting all available beasts of transport at the barracks at Bagh-i-Shah, close to the-Kazvin gate, which gave rise to rumours that they were going to dispute the arrival of the Russian troops at Keredj. On the 11th also the Russian Minister also informed me that the advance guard of the Kazvin troops had actually reached Keredj, and the next afternoon that 1,500 men had left Yengi-Imam in the morning, so that on the evening of the 12th I was in the belief that the bridge of Keredj w r as held by something like 2,000 men. As a matter of fact, not a single Russian officer was in sight of Keredj until the afternoon of the 14th ! It is remarkable that, for the whole of the three weeks under review, the Russian Legation has been kept in entire ignorance of the number of the Russian troops and of their movements, and to-day (2nd December) neither M. de Etter nor I have any knowledge whether there are in Persia 10,000 or 20,000 men. Though somewhat irritating, this ignorance is not without its advantages, as it allows us to say that we know nothing of military movements, which are beyond our control. During these five days, the Cabinet was in almost constant session, and the two representatives of the enemy Powers had endless consultations with the Government. M. de Etter and I, however, feeling fairly secure now that the troops were actually moving, were more sparing of our attentions; but on the 12th, having heard through Mr. King Wood of the capture of His Majesty’s acting consul and the British colony at Shiraz, I called on the Minister for Foreign Affairs to ask whether the Government had news of any* serious incident in that city. No rumour had, however, reached the capital, and I therefore, professed myself reassured, as if the intelligence of the facts—of which I could not at the moment be absolutely sure—would unquestionably have been injurious to our interests. The Shah meantime was, we learn through our friends at the Palace, exceedingly nervous. His Majesty was, as we know, surrounded by enemy influences in the persons of Moin-el-Vizareh, the Minister of the Court, Hakim-ul-Mulk, and others, and we therefore obtained audience of him on the 14th, and endeavoured to reassure him of the friendly object of the movement of the troops. The interview, which lasted two and a half hours, was thoroughly unsatisfactory. According to “ absolutely reliable information,” the night of the 14th-15th had [2546 a—1] C6 been selected for an attack on this legation, and it was on this night that the Turkish Ambassador was on the watch to come to our defence. My confidence, however, in the moral effect of Russian troops within easy reach to prevent disturbance was justified, and we slept as usual. Monday, the 15th November, was a critical day. At 9.30 a.m. Sipahdar am*' Samsam-us-Sultaneh came to the legation and announced that the Shah found it impossible to remain in his capital while Russian troops were at the gates, and that His Majesty intended to remove the Court and Government. I said that the Russian Minister and I had explained to His Majesty only the day before the reason of the movement of the troops, namely, the necessity of protecting the two legations and the large British and Russian colonies in Tehran from being treated like our consuls in so many Persian towns; we had shown great and even excessive patience, but when the diplomatic representatives of the two Powers were threatened, it was impossible for them to remain passive. The measure was entirely precautionary, and the instructions given to the troops were that so long as there were no disorders in Tehran the troops would remain at Keredj. Their Excellencies would probably like to have this assurance from the Russian Minister, and I had already telephoned to him at Zerguendeh to ask him to come into town. (I must here explain that the Russian Legation was being transferred from its old premises in an old and most disagreeable quarter to a large garden contiguous to His Majesty’s Legation, but that the necessary alterations in the new house were not undertaken till very late in the summer, so that M. de Etter was compelled to remain at his country residence—a most inconvenient arrangement. The French Minister and I had offered to find accommodation for himself and most of his staff, but his Excellency had always declined. However, on the 17th he consented to become my guest until the 29th November, when it was possible for him to occupy his own house. The spectacle of the Russian Minister lodged in the British Legation has caused no little amusement in Tehran.) M. de Etter appeared about 12.30, and repeated the a ssurances I had already given. Mostofi-ul-Mamalik had since asserted to me that the assurances I gave at this moment decided the Shah to remain in his capital. If it w T as so, I can only say that at the meeting of “Elder Statesmen” to which my Russian colleague and I were invited in the afternoon both acting and staging were incomparable. After a hasty lunch we reached the Derbar at 1.45 p.m., and in a small waiting room met Ain-ed-Dowleh, Motemin-ul-Mulk, Mushir-ed-Dowleh, Mostofi-ul-Mamalik, Motesham-es-Sultaneh, Shaheb-ed-Dowleh, and Vosugh-ed-Dowleh. They informed us that the Shah could not tolerate the presence of foreign troops so close to the capital and that, unless we ordered them to withdraw, His Majesty would leave Tehran at once. We replied that the troops had come, as we had explained to His Majesty the Shah, with no unfriendly purpose, but solely in order to guarantee us against the German forces ; and we pointed out how* necessary their presence was as in spite of the promises the Government had made to us when the troops first moved from Kazwin that the German mujahids would be arrested, the Austrian soldiers removed all the depots of arms, &amp;c., seized, absolutely nothing had been done to fulfil these assurances; the Government in fact was incapable of dealing with the situation created by its own toleration of German agitation. After some three hours’ discussion, in the course of which white-faced messengers from the Shah came in every few minutes to repeat that His Majesty was getting into his carriage, or to summon a Minister to soothe the Imperial agitation, we finally agreed to recommend to our Governments the following arrangement: that the Cabinet should be reconstructed by the inclusion of Ain-ed-Dowleh and Farman Farma so as to give a guarantee to the two Powers that the Persian Government would carry out the engagement it had already accepted in consideration of the financial support given them by means of the moratorium, and that when the Cabinet had been actually formed and conversations had commenced as to the measures to be taken for that purpose the troops should be removed ta Yengi Imam, i.e., about half way to Kazwin, and eventually to Kazwin itself. I then suggested that it might reassure the Shah if M. de Etter and I personally informed him of the proposed arrangement. The suggestion was adopted with alacrity and we went across the gardens which separate the Derbar from the Palace, and entering the orangery which leads to the rooms in which the Shah usually grants audiences we found assembled on the stairs all the great Persian princes and dignitaries, Kamram Mirza, Akber Mirza, Shoa-es-Sultaneh, Farman Farma, Samsam-es-Sultaneh, and many others. The Shah himself was painfully agitated. His usual high colour had vanished, and his face and hands were constantly twitching, and he had all the appearance of nothaving slept, as he toll us, for four nights. We described to him the arrangement come and W de Etter said that he was sure that it would be approved by his Government. The Shah was very anxious to know how long it would be before the troops would be removed, and we had great difficulty in persuading him that it was not in our ^power to give the order ourselves; curiously enough, he seemed to think that the power rested with me ! ATcei a quarter of an hour’s talk the Shah became quite cheerful. He said that he quite understood that it was quite vital for Persia to be on good terms with her two great neighbours, and hinted at the desirability of an understanding with them for something more than benevolent neutrality on the part of Persia. His Majesty then fell to abusing Germany and everything German in the roundest terms, and when we left him he said he was quite reassured and would he able to sleep. One precaution we took to prevent a hasty departure by His Majesty was to remove an essential part of the engine of his motor-car. We have since learnt that practically only four of his many councillors really exerted themselves to dissuade the Shah from quitting his capital, namely, Kamram Mirza, Farman Farma, Mustaufi-el-Mamelek, and Sahib Baktiar, and that among the most active to urge him to go were Mohtashem-us-Sultaneh, Serdar Bahadur, Bakhtiari, Moin-el-Vizareh, and Mustasha-cd-1)owleh, the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs; while Colonel Ed wall, the chief of the gendarmerie, outbid all others in his efforts to induce the Shah to take the fateful step. Meantime a great exodus of Germans, Austrians, Turks, gendarmerie, and Democrat deputies was in full progress. All public carriages and many private ones, with horses, mules, and camels, were ruthlessly commandeered by the gendarmerie ; the Government archives were ready packed, as also the Crown jewels, a small number of the most valuable of which, in a small leather case, never left His Majesty’s sight. The German Minister, who for tbe past two days had not occupied his own legation, left about 2 o’clock with his Austro-Hungarian colleague, but the Turkish Ambassador remained in the town two or three hours longer, Prince Reuss and Assim Bay having handed over the protection of German and lurkish interests to the United States Minister; while M. Logotheti obtained similar services from the Spanish representative. Till long after dark the road to Shah Abdul Azim was crowded by the procession of Germanophiles, and an eye-witness has stated that Count Kanitz, military attache of the German Legation, and Major Poussette, of the gendarmerie, dressed in full uniform, were waiting for six hours at the city gate to receive and escort with due honour a Shah who never appeared. The exodus continued on the 16th, and by the 17th a very perceptible percentage of the inhabitants of Tehran had disappeared, while not a single carriage plving for hire was to be seen in the streets. Moreover, all down the Kum road the gendarmerie commandeered grain and forage of all kinds to such an extent that it is said that there is scarcely sufficient grain left for sowing purposes, and that Tehran may be threatened with famine next summer. These high-handed proceedings have, at all events locally, destroyed much of the popularity of the Swedes. For a day or two the failure of the plot to get the Shah away seems to have left the enemy without any pre-arranged plan ; but eventually a committee, styling itself the Committee of National Defence, was formed at Kum, where Prince Reuss had arrested his flight, while Assim Bey and M. Logotheti remained at Shah Abdul Azim in touch with the capital, and those of their friends such as Mustesham-ed-Dowleh, Motesham-es- Sultaneb, Hakim-ul-Mulk in the Cabinet, and Moin-ul-Vizareh out of it, who were fairly sure that the official positions they occupied guaranteed them from molestation. 1 he committee endeavoured to invest itself with something of the authority of a national assembly, as some fifty deputies were at Kum ; and Mirza Suleiman Khan, the secretary* general of the Minister of the Interior, flooded the country with official-looking telegrams announcing that a revolution had broken out in iehran, and that the British and~Russian Ministers were in flight, i did what was possible to counteract these lying reports by informing His Majesty’s consuls and all the offices of the Indo-European Telegraph Department of the true state of affairs, but for some days the gendarmerie at Kum interrupted the wires, and it was only owing to the invaluable support and resource of Mr. King Wood that our messages were sent through. Practically all the Government messages were held up at this time by the orders of the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs himself, and even now it is only too evident that he is still abetting the enemy cause in this manner; but so precarious is the position of the Cabinet that M. de Etter and I have not thought it wise to insist on his removal, for fear of provoking a Ministerial crisis. This command of the telegraph service —borrowed, of course, from the Committee of Union and Progress in Turkey—has been of the utmost value to the enemy, and the disability under which the Cabinet has suffered in this matter must be [2546 a—l] D8 ii n kept m mind to enable a proper judgment to be formed of their difficulties in dealing; with the agitation in the provinces. . ^ refcurn ey ents in Tehran : on the 16th November M. de Etter and I were invited to attend at the Derbar to assist at the reconstruction of the Cabinet. When we reached the Palace the Ministers were discussing the question among themselves^ and from time to time one of them came to report progress or to ask whether such and such an arrangement would be acceptable to us. But by degrees the more important Ministers assembled in the reception-room, where we were waiting, and we took a direct part m the conversation. The President said that the Ministers, including himself unreservedly placed their portfolios at our disposal, and expressed the opinion that Ain-ed-Dowleh should become Prime Minister, with Farman Farma as Minister of the Intelior. It at once became clear that Ain-ed-Dowleh was the obstructionist, and though I cannot say that my experience of him in May and June last was encouraging I strongly urged him to accept office, because I felt that the prestige of his name would give great weight in the provinces, if not in Tehran. His Highness, however, flatly refused, and would give no reason for doing so. In these circumstances it seemed to M. de Etter and me that the best combination was to retain Mustafi-el- Mamelik as Premier and Farman Farma as Minister of the Interior. The latter would unquestionably, by reason of his stronger character and greater energy, have been more suitable to hold the reins of power at so critical a moment; but as against this his Highness has been so identified with Bussian and British interests in the past six months, and has incurred so much hatred on the part of the German Democrats and pro-Germans, and is, moreover, no favourite with the Shah, that it is probable that he would have been deserted by half the Ministers, and would have had to enter on the . g. painful task of forming a new Cabinet. Mustafi, on the other hand, is implicitly trusted by the Shah, and his continuance in office would further * be acceptable and reassuring to all moderate public opinion. As Farman Farma himself said, the circumstances were such that he could not even look over the wall, while Mustafi could carry off the horse. It was still necessary to carry out the compact of the day before that Ain-ed-Dowleh should take a seat in the Cabinet, but he modestly declined all the more important portfolios and expressed a preference for the Ministry of Commerce. Ain-ed-Dowleh as Minister of Commerce would have been farcical and it was finally arranged that he should enter the Cabinet without portfolio, while Farman Farma took over the Ministry of the Interior from Mustafi, who had previously directed that Department. A few days later we succeeded in gettiim Akber Mirza (Saram-ed-Dowleh), the Zil-es-Sultan’s son, appointed Under-Secretary to Farman Farma—a very valuable arrangement. The Shah, however, was still very nervous, his apprehensions being sedulously kept alive by Colonel Edwall, who was constantly in attendance at the Palace poisoning His Majesty’s mind with stories that the Bussian troops were advancing from Keredj for the purpose of securing his person. His activity .as a German agent was, however, by no means equalled by his courage, for, on a fantastic report that the Armenians intended to throw a bomb into his house, the chief of the gendarmerie took bast in the United States Legation for about a week—a comically undignified proceeding. Colonel Edwall probably had some apprehensions as to his own fate in the event of^a Bussian occupation of the capital, and I am told that for three or four days he found it necessary to have constant recourse to the whisky bottle to steady his nerves. From all I know of him, the story is probable enough. The conduct of this ex-officer of the Swedish army, as well as that of Major Frick and Captain Poussette, showed perfectly clearly that they were privy to and actively abetted the German endeavour to induce the Shah to leave. Three days before the Bussian troops had reached Keredi they were collecting transport, were openly assisting the Germans to send awav their arms and ammunition, and connived at the departure of the Austrian prisoners of war whom the Government had promised to intern; while when Farman Farma bad been appointed Minister of the Interior, Colonel Edwall point-blank refused to obey his orders. It was no fault of theirs, unless it was their lack of courage to create a little disorder m the neighbourhood of the Palace, in which case I am confident the Shah would have left, that the plot failed; but even by the 17th, though we had got round the sharp corner, the road was by no means plain. The Shah was in constant need of reassurance, and sent for M. de Etter that day. The Minister found His Majesty almost as nervous as ever at the presence of the troops at Keredj, and I fancy that M de fitter must have given a very positive pledge to obtain their withdrawal, for when on his return to my house, where he was then staying, he found a telegram to tne euect that the Grand Duke was opposed to taking that step,; he observed that, if9 His Imperial Highness persisted in this view and the troops remained on, he would have to resign. Otherwise the Shah was most friendly. He told M. de Etter that alter the war he would like to pay a visit to Petrograd, and he telegraphed a message to the Emperor in the same sense. From this moment the danger of the Shah retiring Ai Kum or elsewhere had practically disappeared, though the Government archives remained packed up for three days longer, and the official notification that the intention to do so was abandoned did not appear till the 23rd. On the 21st the troops began the backward march to Yengi Imam, and Keredj Avas completely evacuated I believe on the 25th, but in this as in every other instance it was impossible to get any accurate information as to their movements. On the 22nd we received the news that the gendarmerie had attacked the Persian Cossacks at Hamadan. It will be within your recollection that about the 25th October Colonel Prozorkievitch, at the request of M. de Ett ; r, had ordered a force of some 300 men of the brigade to Hamadan to protect the Russian and British con sulates, who were being threatened by the levies of Herr Weber, the German vice- consul. The appearance of the Cossacks had a magical effect, for the mujahids prudently disappeared, but at the same time the gendarmerie force at Hamadan, in whose loyalty the Government professed to believe, was somewhat strengthened, until their numbers were not far short of those of the Cossacks, and by degrees also the mujahids also began to return ; the situation again became dangerous, and the Russian Minister instructed his consul that in case of danger he should retire towards Kazvin, until he met a force of Russian troops that was to be sent to relieve him. Under general instructions from me, His Majesty’s vice-consul was to conform his movements to those of his Russian colleague. It would seem as if the Germans thought it necessary to make a counter-stroke to neutralise the depressing effect which the flight of Prince Reuss from Tehran and the failure of the endeavour to get the Shah to follow him must have produced on their partisans, and accordingly a coup was arranged at Hamadan. Very early on the morning of the 22nd November the gendarmerie surroundea the caravanserais on the hill called Musallah. just outside the town, where the Cossacks were quartered, and after a very mild exchange of shots, the latter surrendered. The gendarmes, who were under the command of Captain Kaelstrom, then plundered the bank. The Russian consul left the same day, and was followed by his British colleague the next morning, both parties and their colonies reaching Kazvin without incident. The news of the attack caused a great sensation in Tehran, which was greatly intensified by the fact that beside Captain Kaelstrom, three other Swedish officers, namely, Major de Mare, Captain Hellemark, of the gendarmerie, and M. Ericksel, of the Kazvin police, were concerned in it, and that the notorious Captain Sonesson, of the Kermanshah gendarmarie, was moving towards Hamadan with the command and a number of tribesmen in German pay. The gendarmerie was now in open rebellion. The Government, however, as usual was in favour of temporising, and, influenced bv perfectly groundless fears of the consequences in Tehran, still hesitated to follow our insistent advice to dismiss Colonel Edwall and replace him by Major Nystroem. They even deprecated an immediate advance of the Russian troops, and succeeded in inducing M. de Etter to telegraph to General Baratof a request that the sotnia which, as mentioned above, had been sent to Hamadan—too late, as events proved—should remain strictly on the defensive, and avoid a collision with the German force. Whether in consequence of M. de Etter’s request, or, as I believe, rather because General Baratof was not at the moment able to send a sufficient detachment to make sure of dealing with the numerically formidable forces which the Germans had collected at Hamadan, said to number 12,000 men, the wishes of the Persian Government were fulfilled, and with the unfortunate result that the Russian Cossacks, who had got as far as Rezan about the 30th November, coming in touch with a handful of mujahids, retired from that point as far as Aven, thus abandoning to the enemy the formidable defile and pass of Sultan Bulagh. The incident was promptly reported by the Germans to every part of Persia as a signal defeat of the Russians, and was celebrated at Kum by the illumination of the town. It was, however, quite impossible that with 10,000 troops at Kazvin, Russia should tamely allow her consul to be driven out of Hamadan, and on the 2nd and 3rd December a force left Kazvin with the intention of occupying Hamadan. As usual, I am still quite ignorant of its numbers and composition. In his telegram No. 1798 of the 1st December, Sir G. Buchanan reported M. SazonoTs statement that 10,000 men would be sent on this duty. As against this, M. de Etter, who has hitherto talked of the Kazvin garrison as comprising 16,000 to 18,000 men, now tells me that 11,000 is an outside estimate of the troops between Kaj and Tehran.Of these, 500- a quite insufficient number to watch Tehran—are at Yengi Imam, so that it is a safe conclusion that General Baratof will not entirely denude Kazvin by sending 10,000, as M. Sazonof stated, to Ramadan, unless large reinforcements are already landed at Enzeli, of which I have as yet no indication. I have no exaggerated opinion of the value of 12,000 Persians, even with twenty-five or thirty Germans and Swedes iTv lead them ; but it does seem unfortunate that General Baratof should have voluntarily given himself the task of capturing the Sultan Bolagh Pass, when the despatch of a regiment instead of a sotnia would have secured him the passage. At this moment, indeed, an indecisive action may be fraught with grave consequences. A severe blow to the Germans and their supporters might perhaps counterbalance the news of the reverse sustained by General Nixon outside Bagdad, and so give us time to negotiate the proposed alliance with Persia; but, politically speaking, the situation will be very seriously jeopardised by anything short of swift and complete success by the Russians. f °fher towns of Persia, too, the Germans have shown by their activity how well they recognise the necessity of neutralising the unfavourable impression produced by i ^ ie failure of their plans in Tehran. At Sultanabad they have succeeded in driving our consul and colony to take refuge under the American flag, and have, as usua^ pillaged the Imperial Bank of Persia. At Yezd, where the Bakhtiari Governor, Morleza Kuli Khan, with an intelligent appreciation of impending difficulties, resigned some two months ago, the situation has been growing steadily worse, and it is to be feared that, in spite of stringent instructions from the Minister of the Interior, the Actino- Governor will not prove resolute enough to prevent the Germans, who arrived there', with a strong party of partisans, from Ispahan, from making themselves masters of the town, which, as a jumping-off place for Afghanistan Ga Tun and Tabbas, has particular importance for them. At Kerman also, Serdar-i-Zaffer, whose hitherto fairly resolute espousal of our cause has been shaken by the ambiguous messages he receives from the Bakhtiari khans in Tehran, is not likely to make any serious resistance if the Germans appear there in force. In the capital itself there has been an apparent lull. The Turkish Ambassador and the Austrian Minister returned from Shah Abdul Azim on the 27th November, and the lesser lights among the German partisans have been timorously following their example. 1 hey are busy endeavouring to reorganise their forces, which have been grievously shaken by the defection of Prince Reuss. The conversion of Mustafi-el- Mamelik and of the Shah to our side must have been a disagreeable surprise to them, and the two enemy representatives and their friends are now straining every effort to prevent the proposal of alliance which I have with difficulty coaxed out of the Govern ment from taking material shape. But the present despatch, sketchy as it is, has already reached proportions for which I must respectfully ask your indulgence, while reserving the story of the contemplated alliance for a future report. 1 I have, &amp;c.

In accordance with the instructions contained in Government endorsement in the Political Department, No. 7467-W., dated the 26th October 1915,1 have the honour to submit the result of the further examination of the German subject Haji Ali. The information obtained is somewhat fragmentary. Haji Ali has been closely questioned at frequent intervals but, though apparently quite willing to impart to us any information that may be of interest, he is unable to tell us anything more worthy of note. (1) A man named Sorabji residing at Bunder Abbas is the agent for Jamshidian, a Persian firm in the Gulf, and also the agent for the Hamburg- American Line. He always reports to Wonkhause’s firm at Lingah commercial and political intelligence from Bunder Abbas. Sorabji has frequently ex pressed to Haji Ali very pro-German sentiments. (2) An Indian Muhammadan named Mirza Abdulla alias Mirza Mohamed Ali is a political agent of Wassmuss. He resides generally either at Borasjun or at Kazrum. (3) Just at the time of the outbreak of war between Great Britain and Turkey, Haji Ali met a man at a cafe at Lingah, who told him first that he was a Turk and they conversed in Turkish. As Haji Ali speaks Turkish fluently he noticed that his companion’s pronunciation was very foreign and he did not believe him to be a Turk. On being challenged by Haji Ali^ he admitted that he was a Greek. The Greek questioned Haji Ali about various political movements in Lingah and about the feelings of the Persians towards the British and the German Governments. When Haji Ali told him that he was not able to answer these questions, the Greek asked him to take him to Wonkhause s house. Haji Ali then took him to the firm, where he introduced him to the ' ■ ; * ^ Manager Mr. Mainke, a German. The Greek had a letter of introduction from the German Consul of Shanghai. He left next day for Koweit, en route to Basrah. He had an Indian Muhammadan as his servant, who accompanied him all the way. He also told Haji Ali that he had been arrested at Karachi and confined for 11 days before be came to Lingah. Description of the Greek :—* Age about 40, height about 5' 7', complexion fair, moustache -dark and turning grey.

Cited 142 (4) The Germans of Wonkhause’s firm keep- their political doings very secret from their servants. Except one Persian named Gulam Husain, the former servant of Hr. Eicterman, who is at present with Wassmuss, who is aware of a number of the political activities of the firm, the employes of Wonkhause are kept in the dark. IS o subordinate who can read or write German or English is ever employed by them. (5) H hen Haji Ali was on his way from Shiraz to Lingah he passed through Champa. Here 5 horsemen came and arrested him. They took him to Maharakhan, and they told him that the Governor of Maharakhan had sent out soldiers as well to catch him. All this was arranged by Hussain Mundighan who was instructed by the British Consul of Lingah. Thence they took him to Busmeits, where they took rest near the well. About 4 yards on the sea-side of this well is a praying platform (mussalla). About 5 yards or so further on, on the right front, is a small tree, just the other side of a small ditch or channel (wadi) which runs to the well, between the “ musalla ’* and the tree. About a span from the foot of the tree at a depth of a few inches are buried the two k e ys of the sales of the Lingah branch of Wonkhause’s hrm. Erom Bussmeits they took him to Kung, where he was kept for 3 days in charge of 10 soldiers. Then they put him into a sailing boat and kept him out in the sea for 20 hours awaiting the S.S “ Chakdara”, by which he came to Bombay. The attached is a rough plan to show where the keys are hidden. Haji Ali says that the plan should be given to IChan Bahadur, the Secretary to the British Consul at Lingah, who will understand it. Mustafa, the servant of Haji Ali who is at present with Haji All’s family, will also understand the plan as he was with Haji Ali at that time near the “ Musalla ”. Haji Ali states that he was ordered on no account to allow these keys to fall into the hands of the British authorities. He imagines that Wonkhause feared that if the British obtained possession of the keys, they would find a way of opening the safes at Lingah and extracting the confidential papers of the Pirm (6) Dawood Ali is also known amongst the Persians as Moosa Ali. (7) Bunstprff, a German, is the agent of Wonkhause &amp; Co. at Baghdad and also the principal assistant of Wassmuss in political intrigues amongst the Persians against the British Government. He left some time ago for Af f) Tanis* tan. ° ‘ (8) In June last, 3,000 Austrian soldiers and a number of non-commission ed officers, prisoners of war, captured by the Bussians, who were interned at Askhabad made good their escape. The Bussian Military Authorities were bribed and they vere let out and 1,700 of them came over to Tehran where the Austrian Ambassador supplied them with arms and ammunition and sent them on to Asfahan. 700 were sent to Kerman passing through Yezd. At Kerman they received orders from the German Consul. One party proceeded to Baluchistan and another party to Afghanistan. Two Captains belonging to the Hambur°-- American Line, named Harlich and Puster, were sent over to Persia from Germany on the outbreak of the war. They first went to Tehran to receive their orders from the German Ambassador. Tehran is the central place for such purposes. They were sent out to Persia to make political mischief amongst the 1 ersians as they speak the Persian language fluently. Puster was the chief ofiicer about 12 years ago on the Persian Man-ofAVar “Persipolis ”, which was bought from Germany about 19 years ago. These two Captains took charge of the Austrian soldiers at Kerman. . (9) Mahomed Ahmed Ishak Huda, a Persian from Lingah born at Bastakhi arrived m Bombay per S.S. “ Chakdara ” with Haji Ali. He is a correspond ent for various Persian newspapers in the Gulf as well as for the Calcutta paper Hablul Matin ”. He visits India nearly every year. He is always in correspondence with Wassmuss. He receives newspapers from Wassmuss and distributes them amongst the Persians. His object of coming into India is political, to collect news, etc. He gets his news mostly through Persians tra\elling between India and the Gulf. He is considered a very clever man m the Gulf and Haji Ali is of opinion that he does a lot of harm to the English Government in India. He was surprised that he was allowed to land m Bombay and more so that the British Consul at Lingah did i ot inform the Local Authorities about his doings in the Gulf. Haji Ali3 says that he was sure that Mahomed Ahmed Ishak Huda would be arrested on his arrival in Bombay. Haji Ali was responsible for introducing this man to Wassmuss, and Wassmuss wrote and thanked him for the intro duction of so valuable a man. (10) Haji Ali is of opinion that Persians going to the Gulf and coming to India should be searched and carefully watched. He also considers that Indians going to the Gulf become there very anti-British, as they are put up there by different Indians engaged by the German Government for that purpose. The Indians mentioned by him have been in the habit of dressing up on several occasions in military uniform, sometimes as medical people and so of coming into contact with the Indian Troops whom they agitate against the British Government. As regards item No. 9 above, we were able to trace Mahomed Ahmed Ishak from the description given by Haji Ali. He comes to Bombay every year ostensibly to purchase sugar, tea, cloth and other merchandise for despatch to Lingah. He is known in Bombay under the name of “ Junab-e-Ali ”. A telegram was despatched to the British Resident at Bunder Abbas about him. He replied that the individual in question is decidedly anti-British and pro- German. Mahomed Ahmed has been closely watched since Haji Ali revealed to us his tendencies, but we have been unable to obtain any indication that he has even exhibited his own political views, far less indulged in any political activities since his arrival in Bombay. As watching him in this manner has not led to the discovery, as I hoped it would, of possible political agents in Bombay, it is a matter for consideration whether we should not either intern or deport him on the strength of the information supplied by Haji Ali and the British Resident at Bunder Abbas. As regards Haji Ali himself, I would suggest that he should be returned to Jutogh as early as possible. He is not a fit subject to he interned in His Majesty’s House of Correction where the accommodation is most unsuitable for European or semi-European political prisoners. 2 Telegram B., dated (and received) the 1st January 1916.

Wassmuss possibly arranged this before leaving Shiraz in case the Kharis- should try and make some arrangement, vide my telegram No. 772-C. I will in the circumstances keep here Wassmuss’ last two letters until communication is opened again. 8 No. Cf.-4G1, dated Bushire, the 27th December 1915 (received 3rd January 1916) (Confdl.).

The chief holders of grain in istan are Hisam-ud-Daula, his cousin Haidar Ali Khan and Sardar Purdil Khan. On December 4th, and again on Decem ber 27th, I appealed to Hisam through Consul-General, Meshed, to sell us grain. He telegraphed twice to Haidar Ali who has been obdurately declaring that he had no surplus at all. I heard on January 4th that Haidar Ali and another agent of Hisam had been sending quantities of grain into the town by night from their villages and that they were emptying granaries and distributing contents among houses in their villages: also that Haidar Ali was on the point of leaving for Meshed. Purdil Khan has for several months been displaying latent hostility. He refused to give us any Levy sowars. He dissuaded Khudadad Khan for several weeks from doing so and he even repudiated contracts made with Indian supplier. When summoned by Karguzar he refused to come to Sistan. Eventually?) his son Ali Khan came in and on January 5th visited me. I demanded 800 khar- wars Tabrizi of barley from his promising three times the price for it. After much discussion he promised to give 200.

From—His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Delhi. (Sent to Foreign Office and Petrograd.) Persian Government are preparing scheme for augmenting Cossack brigade to 10,000 men. Colonel of Brigade has sufficient Persian officers trained under him for this purpose. They would be paid for out of mora torium and armed with rifles taken from gendarmerie. This project is to be included among terms of a general agreement between Persia and two Powers and Persian Government hope that provision will be made under it to finance this force on permanent lines. I have intimated to Persian Government that while His Majesty’s Govern ment might in order to enable Persian Government to assist Russian troops in dealing with existing situation agree to create such a force they would scarcely relish its employment in South of Persia and would certainly never adnit that after war only force in Persia should be under command of Russian trained officers. They would certainly demand institution of any force that might be required to maintain order in south where British interests are so great should be similarly under British influence. Such an arrange ment would lead to a definition of spheres of influence not far removed from actual partition. It is difficult in existing circumstances to object to increase of brigade as it is only feasible means of providing Persian Government with a force of any military value. Scheme has been prepared by Russian party and Sipahadar, Sipahadar’s object being to embarrass Barman Parma who although he sees difficulties to which it may lead does not wish openly to lay himself open to attack by Russian party by opposing it. Russian Minister is disposed to agree to scheme as a temporary measure though he understands that we could not agree to operations outside Russian sphere of influence by the brigade.10 I learn as to general agreement above alluded to that among its chief points will be cancellation of Persian debt, tariff revision, and subsidy of war. I have intimated that opportunity for big demands which might have been listened to two months ago has been lost and that I was sure that certainly in Petrograd suggestion as regards debt would be rejected and very likely in London also. 24 Telegram P., No. 223-D.

As regards your telegram of December 10th, No. 311-0., Government of India find it difficult to judge of defensive measures necessary in Sistan, parti cularly in view of absence of news since evacuation of Kerman as to what is happening further west. Should you now or later consider it desirable to increase number of Baluchi levies you are authorised to do so at your dis cretion up to a limit of a further 200 men. You should keep Government of India fully informed of action taken. It should, however, be distinctly understood that addition sanctioned is for men to be employed on local purposes only and that for the present recruits should on no account be enlisted from Persian military Or gendarmerie establishments. 25 Telegram P.

Cox’s telegram 3098-B. A point 'which I fear I did not make very clear originally is that according to refugees from Shiraz and other sources reports of our inhuman treatment of prisoners, cruelty to Persian women, etc., have been spread everywhere by enemy and are gaining credence. Reception of letters from Sheikh Hussem and AVassmuss seemed to me to afford opportunity of giving lie to these calumnies. If no notice is taken of these letters it seems to me enemy will hold this up as a proof that reports are correct besides possibly carrying out their threat to stop all communication with Shiraz prisoners. No doubt to have^ any deal- in°*s with AVassmuss and Sheikh Hussein except punitive measures is undigni fied, hut I respectfully submit that by force of circumstances our position in Southern Persia for some months past has not been very dignified.

In Sistan there are, I think, ample stocks of wheat hut holders must be urged to bring them to market. There is also barley suitable for camels and mules; it is, however, so much mixed with wheat that it is rejected by the Officer Commanding for cava ay horses.

AV ould Government of India be prepared to provide Bahadur with rifles and ammunition for these men provided that situation here so developes that we can count on Bahadur’s loyalty.

P Trevor, C.I.E., Deputy Political Resident, Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department, Bombay. I have the honour to forw r ard herewith a copy (together with a translation) of a letter from Herr Wassmuss to Doctor Listemann, lately German Consul at Bushire, and now interned at Ahmednagar I understand. It will probably be within your knowledge that Herr M assmuss who had been acting German Consul at Bushire, returned to Germany just before the war began. The war broke out before he got home, and I understand the ship he was°on was detained a short time at Port Said, but he was able to get through to Germany wdth the German Consular Officials from Egypt. Aitei a short stay in Berlin he was sent out to the East vid Constantinople and Baghdad in charge of a special mission to excite enmity and hatred against the British in Persia, Afghanistan and India, and if possible work up the Muham madan Clergy to preach jehad. He brought with him two or three Indian seditionists and a lot of seditious literature and pamphlets m the principal Indian languages. He arrived in Arabistan via Pusht-i-Kuh at the beginning of the year and as he was obviously violaiing the neutrality of 1 ersia and no steps w r ere taken by the Persian Government to stop him an attempt was mac e to arrest him, this failed but his Doctor—the Dr. Linders alluded to m t e letter—was arrested and the papers, etc , with the mission seized. Subsequently Wassmuss turned his attention to stirring up the tribes in the hinterland to attack Bushire, and since May last has devoted almost the whole of his energies, expended large sums of money, and distributed large quantities of arms and ammunition with this object. He has, as is wefl known, achieved considerable success. He has now got wdiat he considers a trump card in the shape of the British Consul and Colony from Shiraz who were arrested on the 10th November by the Gendarmerie, wdio had long been rabidly pro-German anc now, having apparently heard that the Persian Government was swinging to the side of the Allies, have openly declared with the Germans and revolted against their own Government. The Shiraz Colony consisting of A ajor O’Connor, C.I.E., the Consul, and seven men are now at Ahram in dan gist an in charge of Herr Wassmuss and two local Khans Zair Khidhar and Shaikh Husaim These persons wish to use their captives either to exchange with Germans and Persians arrested on Persian soil, or at least as a means ot getting concessions a, to the treatment of the latter. With these preliminary remarks, for the length of which I apologize, especially as much of this is ancient history, I come to Herr Wassmuss’ actual letter. It js misleading in many respects and should, in my opinion, be censored before delivery.For instance the “ Persian women and children ” to whom Herr Wassmusg alludes in second paragraph of his letter consisted of one family only, which had to be expelled from Bushire by the military authorities during the occupation owing to one of the female members, who is a Tangistani, and in the habit of going across there, being strongly suspected of giving information to the enemy. This family was detained at Mohammerah with a subsistence allowance and allowed to return to Bushire at the end of Oclober at the conclusion of the military occupation, so there is not much ground for reasonable complaint in this regard. In the list of privileges which Herr AVassmuss states are enjoyed by the male prisoneis, he mentions in clause (1) the Postal authorities as supervising the prisoners’ letters This is not so. Letters are censored either by AY assmuss himself or his minions, or by one of the Khans’ Munshis, who knows English. The postal authorities have nothing to do with the matter and have no post office at Abram. The other “privileges” also require some comment, so I will deal with ther clauses seriatim. (2) The English papers are seen by Herr Wassmuss first. (3) Some of their servants have stayed and some have left. (4) The rations provided are of course very inferior as the Tangistani standard of living is not high ; we supplement this from Bushire as far as we can * * * * (5) AY r e have also sent some books belonging to Major O’Connor which had arrived here and some tobacco, etc. (6) Ordinarily they are confined to the courtyard in the local fort, but they are allowed to go for walks The baths, I understand, are taken in some hot springs near by which nature has fortunately provided, otherwise baths would be few and far between I imagine, (7) The prisoners have all to live in one small room, there is also a very small room which is used as a hospital for any one who is sick. Herr AVassmuss in claiming free communication as a privilege makes a virtue of necessity. In enumerating the prisoners who, he says, &lt;£ have been taken prisoners by infraction of International Law and Persian sovereignty,” Herr A^assmuss has omitted to mention that they were all infringing Persian neutrality and carrying on hostilities against us. Dr. Listemann himself was arranging with the Tangistani Chief, Bais Ali (since killed while making a night raid on one of our outposts) to make a night attack on the British here then quite defenceless and living scattered about the Island. He was also waiting for a suitable opportunity to cut our cable and damage our wireless installations, and further was arranging the transmission of arms up country for seditious purposes. Kefer- ring to Herr Wassmuss’ list we find that— (1) Dr. Linders, as previously mentioned, was in AVassmuss’ own mission for stirring up Persia, Afghanistan and India. (2) Mr. Eisenhut was actively engaged as one of the firm of R. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. in supplying funds to German secret agents to stir up trouble and otherwise working against us. (3) and (4) were corresponding with the Turkish force and the German officers and adventurers with it, which invaded Arabistan. (5) was not arrested on Persian soil but * * * (6) was mixed up in the intrigues to create a rising in Oman and an attack by Tangistanis on Bahrain, besides being in active corre spondence with the Turkish authorities at Basrah, supplying them with very prompt and accurate news of our expeditionary force.7 This being so I would suggest that the whole of the first part of this letter down to the word (&lt; Persian Gulf ” should be expunged by the censor, unless our prisoners are enjoying all the privileges mentioned by Herr ^assmuss It this is expunged the words for “here” and “on the points enumerated should also be expunged. Major O’Connor has suggested, and I tliink the suggestion is a good one. that a report might be made as to the treatment of the German prisoners from the Gulf and the Bushire deportees by some neutral person. 1 venture to suggest that, if the Government of Bombay see no objection, the Amenean Consul or some other Consul of a neutral power mot being an Englishman ol course) might be asked to make a report with special reference to the points enumerated by Herr Wassmuss. It is hardly necessary to say that the position of Major O’Connor and his seven companions in misfortune is a very uncomfortable and even precarious one. If therefore it is possible to ameliorate it, or even to prevent it, being made worse, by proof that the German and Persian prisoners from the Gult are well treated, it appears most desirable that steps should be taken to procure and produce such proof. I may add that Shaikh Husain and Zair Khidhar in sending Herr Wass- muss’ letter to me and one from themselves to the principal Persian prisoners at Basrah, stated that if these letters were not sent and favourable replies received, hey would cut off our communication with the prisoners. These Khans have got into the habit now r -a-days of writing threatening letters and very probably do not mean much, but as the lot of the prisoners would be much harder if communication with Bushire were cut off, it seems desirable to humour the Khans in this matter. I venture to suggest, therefore, that the letter, after being duly censored, mav be delivered to Dr. Listemann and a reply obtained as soon as possible, together with a report by a neutral Consul. In order to avoid the necessity for censoring Dr. Listemann’s letter by the military authorities here it would be advisable that it should be in general terms, and this makes another reason toi expunging the first part of Herr Wassmuss’ letter. Annexure to enclo. to Serial Iso. 253. Translation of a letter. Dea.r Dr. Lisiemann, More than 20 natives and Englishmen are here as prisoners up to the present, they have been treated with the utmost consideration. The w omen have been allowed to go free without further action, and have o&gt;one to Bushire, we have therefore expressed a hope that also the Persian women and children who have been compelled to leave Bushire, will be allowed to return there and also that Erau Eisenhut will be at liberty to return to Germany, or to any place which she may herself chose. The male prisoners enjoy the following privileges : (1) They are allowed under supervision of the postal authorities to send and to receive letters. (2) They receive English papers to read. (3) They have retained their own servants. (4) In addition to the rations provided, they are allowed to obtain any V ; food and drinks, which they desire, and to have them prepared by their own cook. (5) Other personal items, such as books, clothes and tobacco they may V obtain according to their desires.8 (6) Morning and afternoon they are allowed to go walking, and obtain baths daily. (7) No restraint whatsoever is placed on their communication with one another. There remains, therefore, to be confirmed whether equally good treatment is being meted out to you and to the other Germans who have been taken prisoners by infraction of International law and Persian Sovereignty in the Persian Gulf. As far as I can ascertain there are, apart, from yourself, the following Germans :— (1) Dr. Linders, who is a prisoner in Bunder Big. (2) Mr. and Mrs. Eisenhut of Bushire. (3) Mr Holst of Mohammerah. (4) Mr. Helmig of Naseri. (5) Mr. Harling of Bahrain. I would ask you, on receipt of this letter, w T hich is being sent through the British authorities, to get into communication with these gentlemen, and to invite them to send a statement as to whether their treatment is on a pa? with that of the English prisoners here or whether they have any complaints to make on the points enumerated. Please send your answer to me via Bushire, addressed to Ahram. I trust that your present misfortunes are not arassing you over much and that you will soon obtain your liberty again. Please remember me cordially to the gentlemen named, especially Dr. Linders. Dated 4th December 1915. I remain, With best wishes, Yours sincerely, W.

I am, however, sending a copy to you, and one to the Government of India, so that Major O’Cornor’s views may be known. It is unnecessary for me to comment on the telegram, and so I will not trouble you with any remarks, beyond observing the Khans are doing more than holding these prisoners up to ransom : they are attempting to arrogate to themselves the powers, or at all events some of the powers, of the Persian Government.

With regard to proposed exchange of prisoners might I venture to urge that attempt should be made to arrange this matter direct with Khans of Tangistan on conditions fiist proposed, namely, our release in return for release of German and Persian subjects deported from or confined on Persian terri tory and repayment of monies confiscated from Khans. There are eight Europeans including Dr. Azzopardy and Mr. Christmas now held prisoners in South Persia, one Ceylonese British subject and some thirteen or more Indians. Private and Government property confiscated on botn sides would presumably be exchanged at same time. Amount of such property at Shiraz is very considerable. With regard to question of Bushire I venture to suggest that A'our Excellency should endeavour to arrive at mutually satisfactory arrangement with Persian Government simultaneously. There is no doubt that some suit able arrangement could be devised and in any case nothing could be more unsatisfactory than present situation involving as it does complete stoppage of trade and perpetuating hostilities with Khans and people of Southern Persia. In case objection 'should be raised to negotiating directly with Khans regarding exchange of prisoners might I venture to point out that similar cases have occurred in other countries where British subjects have been held to ransom in which case negotiations have necessarily had to be held with per sons in actual possession of captives and terms made with them. I venture in conclusion respectfully to submit that conditions under which we are forced to live are such as render life very difficult for Europeans and that in case of sickness most elementary necessaries and comforts are entirely lacking.

By same post as that which brought me Bushire No. 439, I also received a letter from Trevor No. 432, enclosing a communica tion from Sheikh Hussein of Ahmadi to certain Tangistani prisoners captured at Bushire who are now under detention here. Letter is on same lines as that from Wassmuss to Listemann. I have every sympathy with British prisoners but the status of Wassmuss is that of a pirate and that of Sheikh Hussein that of a rebel and according to my judgment it is both inexpedient and undignified that we should have any such dealings with them. I have laid both letters before Army Commander and he takes same view and in so far as the custody of Tangistanis gives him concern in matter he objects to delivery of Sheikh Hussein’s letter to Listemann and I am of the opinion individual who sent it to Trevor should be informed that if ho and Wassmuss wish to obtain information regarding treatment of interned persons by British authorities it is open to them to move their Government who are in a position to obtain it by recognised means.

Up to the time of v/riting no further news has been your telegram of the 24th informed us that everything possible was being done. Communications received from them stated that they were being well treated - be that as it may but it is highly advisable that certain members of the party should be freed, amongst whom is Mr. Ferguson vhose health at present, is far from normal. We are all at a loss to understand why the home Government does not move in the matter. The Resident here has written to Shaik Hussain, in whose charge the Party apparently are, suggesting the exchange of individual prisoners. I understand that negotiations are proceeding with the Persian Government; these can only be futile as the tribes recognise no Government except themselves. This matter has been fully explained in Mrs. Ferguson’s report. received regarding the release of the Prisoners, although (Signed) V/. Forbes Mans on.REPORT OR THE SEIZURE OP THE SHIRAZ COLONY. Bushire, 26th November, 1915. On Wednesday xJovemoer loth as Ivir. Ferguson, Manager of the Bank, was proceeding to Office at 9 a.m. he was arrested by a body of Gendarmes, who stopped and surrounded his carriage, while an Officer, Seyed Abul ioreb, Khan, jumped in and held a revolver against his chest. He was told that the Bank was finished, that he was to be taken to a safe place and would have to give up his keys. He was then taken to the Gendarmerie Head quarters in town where he was forced to hand over all his Bank keys and to send for the Cashier, a Persian, to oring his too. In the meantime, Mr. Ayrton the Account ant, having also been arrested in the street, arrived and his keys were also formally taken from him. At the same time Mr. Ferguson was made to write to his wife and family and on the plea of trouble in town to order them to join him in town. Mrs. Ferguson and family were also at their usual morning duties when they received this message which they immediately obeyed, stepping into the carriage just as they were and not having the slightest idea that they were to be deported from Shiraz. As they drove through the town gate they were greeted with hostile shouts from the Gendarmerie guard but were conducted in safety to join Mr. Ferguson. Soon after them came Mr. Livingstone - Mr. Zeytoon, who is not a British subject, was very early on the scene as a prisoner and his wife was brought in later. In the meantime the party received a note from Major O’Connor and his arrival with his ten IndianIndian Sowars and accompanied by Mr. Smith, the head of the Telegraphs, all riding with a strong Gendarmerie guard under a white flag, was the signal for a tremendous hurst of shouting ,f Long live the independence of Persia. Down with the English’ 1 . Major 0 T Connor mentioned that he received an ultimatum to surrender on pain on bombardment of the Consulate by the maxim gun fixed in Mr. Zeytoon T s house opposite accompanied by threats against the English women. He v/as given half an hour to consider and was also informed that the English were to be taken towards Bushire, the men to be detained in Borasjoon as exchange for German and Persian prisoners but that the v/omen would be allowed to go on to Bushire. Major O’Connor was given three hours notice to pack up some necessaries, was allowed a servant and promised that each traveller should have a servant and three mules each. This promise was not kept. Major O’Connor and Mr. Smith, who had also received three hours notice only arrived at the Gendarmerie at mid-day, having been busy handing over and had managed to get some things packed as well. The Bank Party and Mr. Livingstone on the contrary, had received no notice whatever and were utterly unprepared for a journey. Mrs. Smith and Mr. Pettigrew, who was suffering badly from a recently healed broken leg and who was almost a cripple, were also brought in and then it was decided to send off the party immediately. Mrs. Ferguson in vain begged that she might be allowed to go up to her house for a few minutes and get a few things together. The question was referred to the ’’Chief” in the next room and who was supposed to be identical with the German Consul who had been seen to go in, and was refused. Mrs. Ferguson’s servant, however, was allowed to go and toto collect some things for the road also Mr. Ayrton T s man, hut when they returned with them they found their masters gone and were not allowed to follow them, though they expressed their willingness to. The women folk having protested against riding mules were promised n kajevehs 5f hut they were not allowed to wait for them hut were permitted the use of the Bank Manager's can iage and hurried off out of Shiraz. The men were allowed to ride their horses of vfoich there were sixteen belonging to the British Government v/hich the Consul drought away with him. It was now 3 p.m. and the party duly started without having had any food since 8.30 a.m. At the last minute Mr. Pettigrew was kept hack as v/ell as Mr. and Mrs. Zeytoon. The first halt was made at the Bagh Jennett, then after a half hour's rest the Party arrived at dusk at Chenandar and Qopsd to spend the night unere, all oeing tired out. But on the arrival of the baggage and 'Kajavehs' at midnight they were roused again. Mr. Pettigrew and Mr. Misso also arrived, the latter a Cingalese Bank clerk having refused to remain behind. -i-hev o rlanceo each other in r7 Kajavehs ,r and go ti e oarty of 7 men and 4 women folk - one of them a girl of 11 - and 10 Sowars besides a British Indian refugee from Mesopotamia travelled the whole night in hitter cold, on the coldest stage on the whole road, arriving benumbed and worn out at 7 a.m. at Khaneh Zenian on November 11th. The Party was in charge of the Officer who arrested the Bank Staff and v/ho now became quite friendly and chatty. He allowed them to stay there all day and to make them selves as comfortable as possible, at the same time guard ing them very strictly and allowing them no liberty what ever. An early start v/as made next day and after a short rest at Dastarjin Telegraph Office, Miankotal was reachedeD in safety and no untoward incident occurred. But the next day T s march was a very different affair. Till now the Gendarmerie Officers had heen outwardly friendly and had talked freely with their prisoners and accepted the latter T s offers of smokes, giving no hint of the hostili ty in store for them at Kazeroon. As the little party approached the town they were met first - 1-g- farsakhs away by a large body of horsemen headed by the Nasr-i- Divan who rode up and joined the Consul. At the same time some 3,000 townspeople of all sorts poured out to meet the little cavalcade. Boys and men closed in on both sides of the prisoners hooting, jeering, cursing and screaming insults at the womenfolk. They spat at them and insulted them in every manner, while bands of women placed at different points of vantage uttered a shrill whining cry of derision in chorus. The mullahs headed separate detachments and raised the cries against the British and for the independence of Persia, but after a time utter confusion reigned and no cry was distinctly audible beyond a hoarse shout of rage and nothing visible but a seething mass of people surging in clouds of dust. The Britishers never moved a muscle which enraged the populace and when they began to throw stones the Gendarmes looked uneasy and anxious. Finally the procession arrived at the Gendarmerie Garden where amid renev/ed hoots the party were dismounted and shown to their quarters. These were a pleasant surprise and a Gendarme Officer expressed his apologies for the behaviour of the mob, although he well knew that an organised hostile reception was awaiting the prisoners. He promised that they should not be subjected to any further demonstration in Kazeroon and on the morrow there was no crowd to witness the departuredeparture. But the next unpleasant surprise was the con fiscation, just as the start was being made, of all the horses; and order from the 'Shiraz” committee for the preservation of the independence of Persia, as it called itself came by wire ordering the confiscation of all the Government horses (16 in all) as well as Mr. Ayrton T s private horse, were kept. Mir. Livingstone T s horse had been stolen the first day out while his groom was bringing it after him. Mr. Ferguson had been riding a Government horse, his carriage and two horses having been seized at Chenardar at the first long halt. From Kazeroon onwards the men had to ride baggage mules, all except Major O’Connor who was given a horse. At Kamaridj another body of tribesmen rode out to meet the prisoners and escorted them into the strong Gendarmerie fortress; in intense silence and with great dignity. Here they were handed over to Sultan Ahmed Khan, Captain of the Borasjoon Gendarmerie Post who came up to meet them and who treated them with kindness and respect. He was always ready to converse with any member of the party and his serious and sincere manner commanded their respect and confidence. Both at Kamaridj and Konartakhteh he arranged comfortable quarters. At the latter place he allowed other Gendarme Officers and Gholam Hussain Kashguli, a Kashghai Chief known to the British Consulate to come and see Major O f Connor and talk the matter over. The Kashguli talked of the possibility of the Saulat Dowleh conferring with the other heads at Borasjoon, vtfiich happy idea however was not carried out. There was no incident at Daliki and the prisoners began to realise how utterly they were in the grip of the enemy as they approached Borasjoon. The big Caravanserai was a veritable fortress, bristling with0) with armed men at every point. The parly arrived on the 9th Moharram and passed in silence through crowds of Sowars, being placed in a ,! balahkhaneh Tt with a very strong guard all round. They were told that Mr. Wassipuss was there too. Soon after the arrival, the Moharrem cere monies were started and the party was warned not to show itself to any Persian below. Here a conference was held and Sultan Ahmed Khan explained the danger of keeping the men in Borasjoon as at first suggested on account of the determination of Gazanfer Saltaneh, who was in the neighbourhood, to get possession of Mr . Ferguson T s person in revenge for the confiscation of his Bank deposit*by the British Government. It was here stated that no prisoner would be accepted in exchange for the Bank Manager, that he would be held till Tomans 40,000 were * paid against him. There were one or two Persians in Boras^oon v/ho spoke English and acted as Interpreters. The next morning, the 10th Moharram, the populace worked itself into such a state of frenzy that it rushed the Caravanserai courtyard and swarmed upstairs to attack the prisoners with shouts of rage, before they were driven down by the Gendarmerie guard. In the meantime Mr. Wassmuss had walked several times through the prisoners courtyard, dressed as a tribesman. The Consul thought it advisable under the circumstances to see him and so asked for an interview, which was granted. Mr. V/assmuss ex pressed his regrets for Major 0 T Connor T s present state and said that the individual must suffer for his Government. The little band of 10 Indian Sowars were here told that they must remain in Boras joon‘though they begged to be allowed to accompany their Consul. The senior duffadar waswas granted leave to go with him to Shoak, where it was decided to send him hack to the others. When the little party left in the afternoon for bhoak, going East of the Ahmedi road, Mr* Wassmuss accompanied it.and conversed a little with the ladies with fthom he had been well acquainted. Arrived at Shoak a Tangistani village of straw covered huts, there were two large tents ready and after a meal another conference, including kr. Wassmuss, bultan Ahmed Khan and Shaikh Hussain T s son was held. At this meeting Sultan Ahmed Khan combated the demand of the others that two ladies should be held as hostages for Mrs Eisenhut and carried his point. Otherwise the demands were the same as before viz (1) the recall of all Germans deported by the British and the giving back of all prisoners of war, (2) the return of all confiscated monies, (3) the withdrawal Of all troops from Buthire, this latter demand heing made for the first time at Ghoak The prisoners were formally handed over to the Tangistani Chiefs, Shaikh Tyzl Khan deing head. On the morning of the 18th the parties were separated the men's baggage was put on camels, the womenfolk, still in the care of Sultan Ahmed Khan were taken to Chakootah while the men were to proceed to Ahram, Mr. Wassmuss' headquarters. On the way Mrs. Ferguson was rather ill from distress and the dis comfort of the 'Kajaveh' so Sultan Ahmed Khan called a halt at Chakootah for a little rest. Mr. Wassmuss was riding alongside and talking with Miss Ferguson which the tribesmen greatly resented. Mr. Wassmuss at Chakootah invited the ladies into a carpeted room, and on Sultan Ahmed Khan's explaining that he had a private room for them Mr. Wassmuss replied that it was not necessary for English women, as they did not cover their faces. Mrs. Ferguson immediately seeing the drift of this remark got up and accepted Sultan Ahmed Khan T s offer of a more privateprivate room. Thereupon, on the ladies retreat, there was quite a scene. Sultan Ahmed Khan severely reprimanded Mr. Wassmuss for talking to the ladies and trying to associate with them and Mr. Wassmuss shouted that the ladies wished it. Thereupon a man rushed over and inquired of Mrs. Ferguson if this was so and on her reply that she trusted implicitly to Sultan Ahmed Khan and would sit where he wished her to, the messenger dashed hack in triumph with the answer, and orders were given aloud that Mr. Wassmuss was not to he allowed to go near the ladies. An immediate start was made again and Mrs. Ferguson overheard the men cursing Mir. V/assmuss and saying he was the cause of the death of so many of their men. Arrived at Ahmedi the ladies were conducted to Shaikh Hussain’s private house and comfortable quarters allotted them; after a short interval Shaikh Hussain asked per mission to see them and was ushered in. He came to business directly and charged Mrs. Ferguson with delivery of his message and terms to the Resident in Bushire. He explained at length his 18 years firm friendship with the British and its rupture through the violation of the neutrality of Persia by the deportation of the G-erman Consul and Mr. and Mrs. Eisenhut. The fact that there being a lady in the case seems to have roused the tribes to a pitch of fury. They contracted the treatment meted out to the ladies present to that accorded to Mrs. Eisenhut. Shaikh Hussain was very decided on this point and declared nothing would satisfy the tribes but the restitution to the neutral soil of Peris of the deported people. He demanded the monies as mentioned before the withdrawal of English troops from Bushire. Mrs. Ferguson asked him v/hom the British Government was to treat v/ith in this case as the tribes were in revolt and did not acknowledgeacknowledge the Persian Government. He replied emphati cally that he was the leader of the tribes in the South and that all communications must he addressed to him. Asked what protection the British would have in the case of withdrawal of the troops, he said he would guarantee the life of every Britisher and would also undertake to keep complete order in the District. When asked what would become of Mr. Ytfassmuss in the event of the British yielding to his demands, he said that the latter would be immediately removed and all other German Agents. He expatiated at length on his intense desire for peace. At the same time he said the whole of the South of Persia is in revolt, that the tribes were all ready and the northern army is on its way from Kazeroon. That they were a poor people but that every man was ready to die for the independence of Persia, that they would not tolerate British interference any more. Shaikh Hussain said that the tribes were more powerful than the British thought, that the Gavam and the Saulat were utterly powerless to raise a finger against the ’’mileti' as this new popular movement is called and would undoubtedly go with them in the event of hostilities. Also that the Germans were gradually getting through to Constantinople and would be able to send an army to help them. Shaikh Hussain was particularly bitter against Mr. Chick and complained that Bushire was treated as a portion of India, and not a free independent kingdom. Finally he charged Mrs. Ferguson to tell the Resident that he gave him four days grace for a reply of some sort. That if on the fifth morning no reply came, the war would begin and that he meant every word he said in deadly earnest. Mrs-. Ferguson promised to convey these messageswmammmm messages and Shaikh Hussain also wrote them down', - at least the demands - and handed the letter in Persian to Moussayeb Khan, Major 0 T Connor T s confidential servant who accompanied the ladies. Next morning a tribeswoman was sent in to the ladies to search their persons and belongings for any papers, of which of course there were none. When the ladies said M Goodbye n to Shaikh Hussain he harangued them at some length in a loud voice before all his people reiterating his demands of the previous evening; then he let them go. Sultan Ahmed Khan now took the opportunity of having his say. He expatiated greatly on the insult to Persia in the deportation of the Germans and also on the love of the Persians for their strip of sandy desert which they v/ere determined to have to themselves. He said he longed to place a friendship with England but as long as the British annoyed them, they would not be friends. He was very frank about Mr. Wassmuss and said that the Persians cared nothing for Germany v/hich was far away and v/ere only making use of Mr. Wassmuss for their ov/n ends. Directly they v/ere friends with Britain they would deliver Mr. Wassmuss to her dead or alive - that as long as they were enemies with England they would be friends with Mr. Was sinus s and vice versa. He was very calm and decided and very up to date in his facts. He said that England could not permit a second Mohammedan war just now, that if Persia went to war v/ith her, Afghanistan would most certainly join in and also the Turkoman tribes- and that in this way India would be seriously threatened and no one knew where the war would stop. He admitted the fact that Mr. Wassmuss v/ould do his best to prevent a peaceful solution of the difficulty. He said he knew Mr.Ij.-. Wassmuss did not want the British to withdraw from Bushire as that would foil his purpose of creating war. He argued that England's test and wisest plan was to comply with Persia's demands through the 'Meliti' and ohus cut the ground from beneath Mr. Wassmuss' feet leaving the Persians no further reasons for complaint. In this event rersia would welcome a return to friend ship with England which she ardently desires with the strict preservation of her neutrality. As Sultan Ahmed Khan is a member of the 'Committee for the preservation of the independence of Persia' at Shiraz, it is to be presumed that these are the views animating the whole of the Gendarmerie. Sultan Ahmed Khan brought the ladies \&gt;ith every consideration to just beyond the last Gendarmerie Post where he parted from them, sending them on with six Gendarmes v/hora he recommended to Mrs. Ierguson's care, who handed the ladies over to the British and who in return v/ere treated kindly and not detained a minute.

Cabinet is on eve of dissolution. Reports that Mujahids have made a successful attack on Saveh are false.

S., to Kerman.4 Owing to unexpected arrival of Russian troops German plans which were laid for early Spring have had to be hastened on but they still await arrival artillery. Von der Goltz is at Baghdad and will shortly move with 30,000 Turkish troops to Kermanshah. He will be joined by German levies and Gendarmerie and by considerable force contributed by Vali of Pusht-i-Kuh who has had gift of 30,000 pounds and has been given three batteries 7*5 centimetre guns and 12 Maxim guns brought in by Haupt. In Sultanabad 170,000 tomans were spent in about week. Only w r eek ago there were at Sultanabad 3,000 Mujahids but most of them left in direction of Hamadan near which place enemy have 20,000 men. Vice- Consul passed between Sultanabad and Kum a party of 800 Mujahids. Germans boast that Persia will have declared war on us in three weeks. Eleven million marks have been brought in by Major Klein in gold. There is no silver coinage in circulation there and even smallest transactions have to be done in gold coin. Goltz’s kit (?) has arrived there while German Minister is at Kermanshah. As to minor events nearer Tehran there is some evidence of a skirmish near Saveh. At Hasanabad Gendarmerie aro drilling daily and practising musketry under Erick. They are being paid in gold coinage. 224 Telegram P., No. 533-F., dated the 15th (received 16th) December 1915. From—His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary tc the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Delhi. (Addressed to Foreign Office. Sent to India and Petrograd.) Persian Cabinet has decided to retain office and to endeavour to conciliate public opinion with a statement (that ?) an offensive alliance against Turkey is not contemplated. I do (?) not think their efforts will do anything to improve situation, which depends on success of operations of Russian General Officer Commanding. Government is quite powerless. They cannot send message central and southern provinces, telegraphs being in hands of Germans. Even if they could their instructions are not obeyed. Germans have a very considerable force of local levies of little or no military value compared with their numbers, but by their means they control all Persia south of Yezd, Kum, Sultanabad, Kermanshah line. Even north of this line democrats(?) are so active in German interests that Government’s authority is very slender, while south of it and in Kerman whole population is cut off from all but German news as to events in and out of Persia. This news is dressed up to suit German interests, and population is wholly under German influence in consequence. It is to be assumed therefore that German levies will be increased largely (I know indeed for a fact a considerable force, including even Bakhtiari, has started for Kum from Ispahan) so that it is probable enemy force may soon reach a figure too great to be crushed at once by Russian General Officer Com manding’s troops which have to operate over a very wide front and against an enemy whose tactics will be to avoid actions of a decisive kind. It is most necessary Mujahids and gendarmerie should be crushed before Turks appear, for all south-west Persia will join them if only a quarter of 40,000 suggested by my telegram No. 531 should reach Kermanshah. Ten thousand more Russian troops in fact may be able to effect to-day what thrice that number will find difficult in(?) spring or whenever Turks appear. It seems to me that Turks will arrive betore spring. Although in these regions military operations are difficult and sometimes impossible in winter their presence will attract recruits and there will be time to give them organisations. I would urge General Baratoff’s force be without delay considerably increased.5 225 No. Cf.-4-29, dated Bushire, the 7th (received 13th) December 1915.

I am not sure whether the High Government will not want something more definite from the Committee and the Gendarmerie, but we can wait about that. I would merely remark that the two last terms you mention in your letter were not mentioned by the Committee. hat I write to ask now is would you be prepared to negotiate for the prisoners separately or not. What I mean is that there are Mr. Ferguson and Mr. Smith whose wives are here whose cases I should be glad to settle first if possible, and also that of Mr. Pettigrew who has, I understand, a had leg and so his case should be settled also quickly. Please let me know about this point. Also what about the 10 sowars, they have not done anyone any harm— Would you be prepared to exchange them for an equal number of the persons deported to Bombay, supposing that Government approved of my entering into negotiations with you.

Your esteemed letter intimating that you are willing to negotiate for the exchange:of Mr. Ferguson, Mr. Smith and Mr. Pettigrew and 10 sowars who are prisoners has been received and we have noted the contents. Firstly, you should know for certain, in the first place, that we will take no steps, which may be against the interests of all the nation, particularly (the people of) Shiraz. Similarly, the Ulema and people of the place have relied on every step taken by us, and confirm them as being in consonance with expediency. We are willing to exchange Mr. Pettigrew, whose leg is wounded, for the German Doctor, and the 10 sowars and the other 4 Indians for the 14 men taken prisoners and wounded in the fight. If you are willing please inform us in reply. *6 Enclo. 3 to Serial No. 225. Telegram No. 145-1317, dated 3rd December 1915. From— Major A. P.

About 1st instant Governor of Gulf Ports received an undated letter from ^ one of his men at Shiraz, who writes “ On the night of the 8 th Muharram (15th November) Gendarmerie went to Imperial Bank of Persia, Shiraz and took 14,000 tumar.s and that the young German who was in Shiraz (PB oever ) has been sitting in Imperial Bank of Persia, Shiraz, the past three days. ,r ~’ He adds that Gendarmerie and democrats who drill every day occupy all important points while Qawam and Baharlu only hold Masjid Nasr-ul-Mulk and gate and cannot do* much. On the other hand, a messenger sent by me with letter to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, says that when he left Shiraz, Qawam was holding his quarter and people were daily expecting a fight between Gendarmerie and Baharlu. It would appear that Qawam is improving his position and I think it might be useful if Persian Government wmild send him stringent and definite orders to make every possible effort to suppress Gendarmerie and secure relese of His Britannic Majesty’s Consul and party in co-operation with Soulet.

(Repeated Basrah departmentally.) Fars situation .—Por some time past rumours have been rife that Mr. Makertich, an Armenian Signaller of Indo-European Telegraph Department of long standing, had been killed, Various letters and finally one from one of Darya Begi’s men in Shiraz leave little doubt that reports are unfortunately true and that he was shot by the Gendarmerie, apparently for his pro-British activity. Special messenger to Malcolms here brings news that Gendarmerie forced Mr. Hai Malcolm, a British protected person, to pay up a large sum of money— 18,000 tumans being at first demanded ; this was reduced to 10,000 tumans on intercession of some leading Persian merchants. In short Gendarmerie have been terrorising Shiraz ; they are no doubt seizing all the money they can lay hands on. 226 Telegram R., dated the 12th (received 17th) December 1915. From—His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Delhi. (Addressed Ahwaz, repeated Basrah and Government of India.) Your telegrams of December 10th and December 11th and my telegram No. 382-E., December 3rd.Khans here and particularly (Sardar ?) Bahadur are playing into the hand of enemy. On December 9th they concocted a letter purporting to be from their kinsmen in Ispahan and Bakhtiari and saying (?) “ Remember tribe is Moslem.” This letter was shown to Prime Minister with result that for the present idea of Persian alliance is wrecked. I hear also that they have signed an agreement with gendarmerie which is very pro-German binding themselves not to interfere with proceedings of gendarmerie at Ispahan in exchange for which service (?) they are to seize Zil-es-Sultan’s lands. 227 Telegram P., No. 34-F., dated the 15th (received 16th) December 1915. From—His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Sistan and Kain, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Delhi. (Addressed to Tehran.) From a private source I have heard that whole of English and Russian community of Kerman consisting of more than forty persons are probably coming to Sistan. Russian Consulate is in a dilapidated state and it will be difficult to accom modate so many. Do you think all ladies, children and missionaries should be sent straight on to Quetta ? I have no news of the cause of sudden exodus. Has any German force unexpectedly arrived in Kirman ? 228 Telegram P., No. 35-F., dated the 15th (received 17th) December 1915. From—His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Sistan and Kain, Robat, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Delhi. (Addressed Tehran ; repeated Delhi, Quetta, Meshed.) Captain Bennett, Commanding at Kacha, reports that Sarhaddis of Mirjawa are saying that Hisam-ud-din Dowlah whom they regard as anti- British is about to succeed Shaukat. At his farewell visit Monsieur Romanovski informed Mr. New that he had heard from Tehran that we were getting Shaukat supplanted. In Birjand this prematurely and possibly incorrect announcement may do us some good but not in Sistan and Sarhad. Russians are, it appears, all very hostile to Shaukat and some of the evil reports about him in Meshed may originate from a Russian source. The attitude of Governor has not been satisfactory. I am however certain that behaviour of Romanovski towards him during the past year is largely responsible for this. Mr. New thinks Governor is now more amenable as he appears willing to punish the soldiers who have been recalled from Yazdan. J Governor has shown a telegram from Farman Farma dated the 10th December to Vice-Consul announcing improvement of relations but not men- tionin g any necessity for co-operation against the Germans. 229 Telegram P., No. 535-F., dated the 16th (received 17th) December 1915.

Russian Minister has received confidential information that, in conse quence of news twenty thousand Turkish troops have crossed frontier at8 * Kasrishirin, Shah is preparing to leave. If, as seems probable enough, this news is true only immediate despatch of reinforcements of at least equal strength to Baratoff can maintain situation here. 230 Telegram P., Nn. 86-F., dated the 16th (received 17th) December 1915.

From Kerman I have no news since December 11th when telegraphic communication was suddenly cut, but in previous two or three days situation had evidently (?) developed as Consul 'was making arrangements for evacuation of the place. His intention then was to make for Bunder Abbas, only Indo- European Telegraph Department staff going to Bobat. There was, I understand, only one German at Kerman, but he had active assistance of gendarmerie and Karguzar and his force of Mujahids was too strong for Governor’s Sowars whose ammunition was insufficient. 233 Telegram dated (and received) the 16th December 1915. From—The Director, Persian Gulf Section, Indo-European Telegraph Department, Karachi, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Delhi.

Your telegram 448. Begency Council threatened proposed (?) would I fear be quite unworkable in Persia where personal jealousies and intrigues outweigh all considerations of public interest. Bussian Minister entirely agrees with me.9 1 agree with Sazanoff’s view that our best course is to endeavour to induce present Shah to remain as he seems inclined to do and that we must bring back his father if he should abdicate. Russian troops are about to move towards Kum and when they are established there I think, except in event of serious reverse to Russians at Hamadan, there is but little danger of Shah going south. 237 Telegram No. 545-F., dated the 19th (received 20th) December 1915.

From—His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Delhi. (Repeated Petrograd.) To-day Russian Minister was invited to Palace. He found Shah very anxious to conclude alliance to effect which His Majesty said a change of Cabinet is necessary. Shah himself was in favour of a Sepahdar’s Cabinet, but this combination is a half measure at best and I think our position is now strong enough to discard such measures. Sepahdar, moreover, though we can trust his good intentions is too flighty and his Cabinet already formed on paper would contain elements of a very undesirable kind. On the other hand Barman Parma has succeeded in acquir ing a great (?) influence with Shah and he is I believe capable of inducing His Majesty to entrust him with formation of new Cabinet which w'ould be both friendly and homogeneous. I think we ought to give our best support to Barman Barma. 240 Telegram P., No. 36-F., dated (and received) the 20th December 1915.

About the 10th instant two or three hundred Baluchis (?) passed Naiband in the direction of Yezd. They are, in all probability, identical with the party which was also heard of at Khabis.

From—His Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Sistan and Kain, Robat, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Denart ment, Delhi. p In laying in supplies to carry troops up to next harvest, namely August we are experiencing great difficulty. —Officer Commanding has in hand only two months’ supplies of barley for horses alone. He cannot issue to his camels and although he has been author ised to hire four hundred mules locally to make his supply arrangements (?) for force more mobile he finds the barley problem insuperable and therefore cannot avail himself of sanction given. It is well known that four or five Persian landholders have in hand large stocks which they are concealing to some extent with a view to sell later on at very high rates. Our two Indian (?) contractors are giving just as much trouble to us. The Quetta agent of Seth Suleiman informed Divisional Supply Officer that his firm possessed in Sistan 40,000 maunds barley. Seth Suleiman himself says that he has 2,000 maunds only. After the arrival of 40 Hazara sepoys in Neh prices were raised excessively and grain was concealed with the intention evidently of boycotting our men. Bhusa was then selling at two krans per 100 pounds. Seth Jawala Singh bought up the whole stock and is now offering it eight krans per 100 pounds to Makeig-Jones. Barley, wheat and bhusa are absolutely unobtainable in the Sistan bazar. Even rural population complain that kadkhudas will not sell to them. Humours indicate that riots are likely to occur as a result. The Deputy Governor and the Revenue Director are quarrelling with each other as to who should deal with situation and in what manner. It seems hopeless to get any affective orders from Tehran especially as they would have to come through the Birjand ofjicials[?). As the stocks in Kainat are always inadequate our troops in Birjand have been supplied from Sistan for several weeks past. Can any special measures be taken against the Indian contractors who copy the Persians in concealing supplies and if riots become imminent can latter be threatened by commandeering ? The peculiarity of the situation is not that prices compared with Indian rates are excessively high but that holders deny the existence of their stocks v.hich are buried in pits and can be found only under search backed up by force. It is unfortunate that one Indian contractor has no barley while the other has not much bhusa or wheat. There is therefore no competition between the two men. To see if situation will be affected by such operations I have advised the Officer Commanding to indent on Qretta for 1,001 maunds of barley. The reserve grain for animals in Kacha Kch is also very low. Grazing for camels is everywhere scarce. To supplement grazing camels consequently must have bhusa.In Any further communica tion on this subject, please quote No. IV *£(05 and address— The Under-Secretary of State Foreign Office, London.

Sir I have the honour to submit a report of the events leaning to ray departure and that of the British colony from Hamadan. ihere was considerable nervousness in the town daring the days of Ashura, as it was generally believed tnat the (ierraans would then make some attempt to cause trouble. The townspeople f however, and the leading aUjtehids, with the exception of &gt;eyyid Mohammed Tabatab»i f v, re opposed to any disturbances, and for this reason the displays of mourning were much less than usual* and ashura passed witnout any incident. on November 17th the Swedish wiajors Kaellstrom and Krikson arrived from nazvin. 1 was already acquainted and on friendly terras with iajor uaellstrom, and I invited both the Swedes and i«ajor ^ohammed iaqi Khan to dine with me. In this 1 was actuated by several motives. Knowing that bhe i ersian Cossacks were untrustworthy* 1 hoped that the Gendarmerie might give help in case of disturbances, but any negotiations with them would, 1 knew, have to be conducted through me, owing to the notorious hostility of my missian colleague towards the Gendarmerie. 1 was also in hopes of learning something of the intentions of the Gendarmerie, and the reason for the concentration at iiaraadan iv.arlir^ , &gt;&gt;q. t G*i&gt;., g. **.G•, h.b.iv,.

The two Swedish i«ajors also took part in the attack. The Cossacks only put up a faint resistance, many of them surrendering with out firing a shot, mid the attack was successful. The Cossacks then retired to a caravanserai, where they were surrounued, and ultimately compelled to lay down their arms.

Baron Tcherkassov and the remaining members of his colony left on the afternoon of the 22nd. Prior to my departure 1 asked the Governor to senu somebouy to seal up my house and office.

But the treasury of the Imperial hank of Persia at namacian is a large one, and on the morning of our departure there still remained about 138,000 tomans, which was seized by the Germans on the plea that £X«lQ f belonging to them had been seized by the Imperial Bank of Persia at Ghiraz. They also detained the books, but 1 learn that these have since been handed over to the reverend d.n. Allen of the American mission. «*e left iiamadan on the morning of November 23rd. Both the Governor and the Gendarmerie declined to give us an escort as far as Birab, which I had asked for.

The very excellence of his character makes him a jnost dangerous man, as he lias capacity for inspiring confidence in others, great personal courage, undoubted intelligence and tact, which, combined with his lofty stature, render him a man capable of becoming a national hero, especially in a country like Persia, where heroic qualities are rare. Any measures, tnere- fore, which may be taken in Astern Persia for the suppression of the pro-German movement, should be specially directed against him. 1 had always'been on friendly terms*’with him, and to this I attribute the fact tiiat we v*ere allowed to depart unmolested, for it would have been perfectly easy to arrest us and hold us as nostages.

'On the Caucasian front screened by their advanced guards a complete re-grouping of Turkish forces is taking place. The aged Bostani-Pasha has been appointed to the assistance of the unsuccessful Halil-Bey. This appointment has been made with a view to completely reorganize the Turkish troops on the coastal front. The objects of the latter are clear. To arrange matters so that this comparatively speaking small force - about a Division of Infantry with 20 to 24 3' guns - .could successfully achieve the task assigned to it of actively defending the rear of the Portress of Erzeroum - in the Vilayet of Trebizond. Bostani - took part in the Turkish and Tripoli- tanian campaigns - has taken up his duties with some energy and hitherto, although he may not have attained his object owing to complete disorganization in the separate units forming the Coastal Army, he has in any case done all he possibly could in the desired direction At Kapistia along the whole course of the Arhava and the northern slopes of Magara-Dagh, the enemy's scouting manoeuvres associated with fighting have become more frequent and have assumed a well defined nature. True enough they cannot be called movements preparatory to an advance in the near future, seeing that strategic operations are not to be foreseen for some considerable time; but attempts at tactical activity point to an organizedQot) organized and well planned programme in this district. Turkish scouts are especially active between the crest of the Magara hills and the upper reaches of the Tchorokh. At times they attempt to break through into the district of Artvin. Here the line of front turns on Tevra-Dagh, Kepri-Kizliar-Dagh and abruptly redounds southward to the positions occupied by us at Tutah and Melazkert abutting against the north-western shore of Lake Van at Adeljivas. At this point unimportant Turkish forces are grouped in the Gop district which are finding their way thither through the district of Mush along the valley of the Euphrates. In the Sandjaks of Bitlis feeble Turkish forces are still on the defensive along the upper reaches of Bohtan-Su, from Mukus to the southern extremity of Lake Van. Here the Turks are making an attempt to maintain their lines of communication with the Persian districts south of Lake Urumiah on the road from Diaberkir to Ushku, the Sauj-Bulagh pass and further on to Bane, She hr i - Avr aman and Kermanshah - the centre of Germano- Turkish activity in Persia - this route is one of the more important of two arteries linking the latter country with Turkey. Farther south, within the limits of the Sandjak of Deir-el-Zor t no roads exist; and from the south, or the direction of Baghdad the road through Damascus is much longer. The valley of Luristan affords excellent shelter for brigand bands - even detachments of semi-regular Forces of the Turkish Army cannot traverse this country. With the development of our movements in the direction of Bitlis from which our line of front passes aboutBaghdad is only twelve marches from Ramadan through Kerraanshah and Mendeli, i*e. exposed to a direct attack on the flank from the heart of Persia. This circumstance would lead one to suppose, that the preparations for an Egyptian campaign are only to serve as a blind and that the hurriedly drawn regimental drafts from various Army Corps will actually be sent through Angora, Broussa and Diaberkir to the Caucasian front and to Baghdad. Nevertheless great care should be exercised in taking into account reinforcements which are being prepared by the Turks. The dismal experiment of advancing with a compound Syrian Army Corps has proved that the despatch of Militia detachments is irrational and is practically, only equivalent to the accumulation of human material. Even then, the Porte sent the best it could, - an Army Corps of regular Infantry which was quartered last spring at Adrianople plus, later formations from the districts of Konia, Angora and Smyrna. In general, however, a liberal estimate of the forces that can be sent is two Army Corps. What, however, can 80,000-90,000 men on a line of front extending from Arhava to Bitlis, i.e. a crooked distance of 300/350 versts, do? Apart from their offensive, even if only for active defensive purposes, they can at most endure from 5 to 6 months, and what then? Prom the Dardanelles and the neighbourhood of Constantinople and also from Baghdad not a single soldier can be moved. Several Brigades dispersed in the hills of Syria, cannot be movedto other points, owing to the permanent threat of an Anglo-French landing on the Syrian coast. But the principal helplessnesshelplessness of the Turk is to be attributed to the fact that during a period of almost five years Turkey has been weakened by incessant warfare, viz. with Italy, the Balkan Federation and now with the Quadruple Alliance. For a country with a population of 26 millions and almost dismembered by internal and frequent coup d'Stats, further hostilities in the not far distant future may not prove equal to its strength.*' An Old Sergeant.Immediate and {\' ifidentitil.

Two Saiyids were sent by Shaikh Jaffar to Angali to distribute these decrees, and copies have been handed to us by Ahmad Khan of Angali. No doubt the intention is to frighten the friendly and neutral Khans into joining the hostile Khans.—Shaikh Jaffar’s own decree seems to be specially directed against the Khans of Dashti, the Chief of whom has remained friendly. Sub-Enclo. No. 1 of Serial No. 209. The Decrees of the Emblems of God in the Holy Blaces and of His Reverence Aqai Mirza. Received by Ahmad Khan of Angali, November 22nd, 1915. Question ashed of the Rontiffs of the Holy Blaces — What do you decree in regard to the Muhammadans who at this juncture, when the unbelievers and the followers of the Cross are attacking Muhammadan countries, fail to carry on the defence and are co-operating with the invaders with their properties and lives and by affording them other kinds of assistance ? Do you consider these persons as Muhammadans and secure of their lives ? Please send us an answer in accordance with the order of God. Answer —Persons who assist the invaders with their lives, and properties, or in showing them ways and giving them guidance, providing them with supplies or arms and other kinds of assistance, are not Muhammadans according to the law of Islam, and we consider that their blood should be shed and it is incumbent upon Muhammadans to drive them out of the provinces of Muslims and such countries as are occupied by them, and even kill them if possible. • : 'd on 13 J A. ^ \ ■ • A IdDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S Letter.

Question put to His Reverence Jgha Mirza Ibrahim — What is the duty of every Muhammadan to-day and what will you say in regard to those who are not waging a defensive war against the unbelievers, now that the latter have attacked Muhammadan countries, but assist them ? Please tell us in reply what is the order of God so that it may be put into force. Answer.—In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. To all my brethren of the province of Pars and others of the people of the towns, villages, notables, merchants, Khans, Kalantars of the tribes and towns and all the artisans and other brethren of my native country. Oh! brethren who have been created to guard Islam, have been brought up in the country of Islam and taken pride over the human race by professing Islam, have you not heard the cry of Islam in solitude:—“ Is there any helper to help me ? ” which cry has filled the world ? Are you not moved by this world wide cry and are not prompted as Muhammadans to take action ? To-day is the day when good will be distinguished from evil, and the guilty from the guiltless. You should distinguish yourself to-day, Oh you guilty.” Happy is he who, as bound in duty to God, will proceed to the places immediately liable to the unbelievers , att acks and defends them in the best way as far as possible, or sends defenders to those places, or at least courageously comes forward to pay subscriptions to the defenders, and wins the goal of happiness and a good name 1 Wretched is the man who, through luxury and obedience to his passion, fails to lend his assistance in the cause of Islam and buys everlasting torture and eternal disgrace 1 As for the decree in regard to the pretended Muhammadans who assist the heretic invaders in any respect, after it is proved and verified, and is not only bv imputation and imagination, they are liable to the judgment passed by the Delegates of the Imams in the Holy Places. IBRAHIM SHARIF. In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate* “ Hasten to secure God’s forgiveness and mercy.” The Decree for Defence issued by His Reverence Agha Shaikh Muham mad Jaffar, Borasjun. (Received by Ahmad Khan of Angali, November 22nd, 1915.) After that the unbelievers and the foes of the Luminous Religion attacked the Muhammadan countries, and the English occupied such places as Basrah and the like in ’Iraq, and on this side also in the last few months they have attacked the Southern portion of the Muhammadan country of Persia and have occupied Bushire, and whereas a party of the heroes and protectors of Islam, such as the notables and Chiefs of Tangistan, Chahkutah,^ Borasjun and Dashti, offered resistance and showed hostility to them, defending them selves against them with the utmost perseverance and sacrificing their lives it became necessary for all Muhammadans to assist and to co-operate with them in every way. I also left Shiraz and arrived at Borasjun in order to help these respect able men and the Mujahidin (may God grant them victory).The Persian Government and Ministers in the meantime sent appeals that the Mujahidin might be restrained and refrain from carrying on the defence with a view to arriving at a peaceful understanding, by which the unbelievers would evacuate Bushire. For about two months in this way we waited to use our forces for defence. Now we are despondent of the steps taken by the Government to secure the desired results. In fact it has become evident that the object of the unbelievers by these arrangements was to weaken by intrigues the forces of the Mujahidin, and to increase their forces, and strengthen their base of operations with a view to attacking the Muham madans. When this became clear to the Muslims, and they despaired of attaining their end, and became convinced that the matter would prove contrary to their desire (i,e., that there would be a further conquest on the part of the unbelievers on Islam the (Mujahidin), in accordance with their duties to Islam and the religious zeal, began to defend themselves. Therefore, it is necessary that all Muhammadans, especially the Heads and Chiefs of Dashti, who at the beginning took perfect steps to carry on the defence and showed great bravery, should join the base of operations and make unanimous attack to check, and remove the malice of, the unbe lievers and help the religion of Muhammad (may God’s peace be on him and his people) and assist the Quran, the heavenly and God’s Book, so that by the blessing of the Imam of the age (may God hasten his advent) and through the high efforts of the Mujahidin, this Muhammadan country may be guarded from the malice of the foreigners, and that Persians may be released from the oppression of the unbelievers and usurpers. May God assist those who assist Islam, and help those who help the religion and assist the protectors of Islam, and humiliate the unbelievers and those hostile to Muhammad and his people. 213 Telegram R., No. 748-C., dated the 10th (received 11th) December 1915.

Governor seems to be reassured for the present. At an interview yesterday he stated that he was by no means satisfied with Laisser aller line of Persian Government and saw no good in merely sitting here doing nothing. On my remarking that by merely sitting here he was doing good he de clared he would stay as long as we wished him to and leave when wre wanted. He is of course very free with his promises but I do not think that he will leave just now.I have given him &lt;c advances ” from time to time but when I sent my tele gram No. 740-C. he wanted something else. No remittance has ever been received here. Governor recovered about live thousand tomans revenue from Bunder Abbas and Lingah which has tided him over up to now. Provincial Bevenue Department has no money and is not likely to get more : either Tehran should make it a grant or else authorise (jo\emor to draw on Custom-house up to four thousand tomans a month.

C.^ Jukes, Esq., Deputy Secretary to the Government of Bombay, To The Secretary to the Government of India, Home Department. I am directed to forward for disposal a translation of a petition, praying for their release, from certain individuals deported from Bushire and interned in the special Prison at Thana in the Bombay Presidency. Nineteen days ago we were in Bushire. We were summoned, and without a discussion of any kind we were ordered to get ready for a journey with a view to speedy deportation from Bushire. We were astonished (at this order), and we thought that some interested persons had been instrumental in causing suspicion to be cast on us. As we were removed from Bushire within the space of two hours, we did not get an opportunity of dispelling any suspicions (which may have arisen against us) or of establishing our innocence. We therefore determined to put before Government officials details of our circums tances to dispel the above-mentioned suspicion. Contrary to practice, however, we were unfortunately taken away from Bombay under the surveillance of the Police. Owing to the fact that the great British Government is an Ally of the Government of Persia, and a very old friend and well-wisher of the latter, we hope that you would deal with our petition according to the dictates of justice—• a thing for which the British Government and the British nation have always been famous. We never harboured any feelings inimical to the British Govern ment, and we have always been loyal to it. It is possible that some interested countryman of ours has misled you to suspect us. However, we are ready to obey any orders which your honour may be pleased to pass regarding our residence and movements. It is well-known that all our concerns are in Bushire, and if we are kept in confinement like this for some time they will suffer and our wives and children will be without means of livelihood. Surely the officers of the British Government would not tolerate that Muhammadan women and children should unnecessarily fall a prey to anxiety and hunger ! Since we have not committed any fault nor do we possess any power, we pray that your honour may be pleased to set us at liberty, permit us to go home and engage in our occupations, and to invoke the blessings of God on the British Government. In the alternative we may be brought (?) in India to follow our occupations. Our concerns and families are at Bushire. All of us petitioners are ready to give the necessary security to fulfil our promises and to faithfully observe any rules which may be prescribed for our residence and movements. We hope that should our prayers be granted it would be perfectly clear to the officers of the benign British Government that our conduct was just what is stated. In conclusion we humbly pray you to set us at liberty so that the anxiety and disgrace to which many men, women and children have been subjected owing to our incarceration may be removed.

I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your endorsement No. 1864-W., dated 4th October 1915, forwarding a copy of a letter No. 1863 of the same date to the address of Sir Percy Cox, asking for his remarks on the subject of a petition submitted by certain persons deported from Bushire, praying for their release. 2. As Sir Percy Cox is now at Kut-el-Amara, and these persons were deported from here on my recommendation, I venture to offer a few remarks. 3. The petition is misleading from beginning to end and contains more than one falsehood. These persons were selected for deportation from among the most virulent anti-British, and active pro-German Bushiris and principal mischief-makers of the Town. 4. Their “ inimical feelings ” were too widely expressed all over Bushire and occasioned too much annoyance to the Residency Staff for anyone in Bushire to accept their present professions of so-called loyalty. The “ Officers of the benign British Government”, certainly can safely say that their conduct was not “just what it is stated (in the petition) to be ” even the “ Jam-i-,Tam” says that some of them “ were formerly friends of the Germans and talked evil of the British”, and refers to them as “ pro-Germans ” (vide articles submitted with my letter INo. Cf.-352, dated 10th October 1915). 5. His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran has expressed the opinion that these persons should “ remain in India until the situation (at Bushire) has become normal again”, which means until the defeat of the Germans is a patent fact even to Persians. 6. I would strongly deprecate having them back to resume their old anti' British propaganda and vituperation, as they certainly would do as long as the Persian Government and Mujlis remain so much under German influence as they are at present.

In case^ negotiations with Tangistani Khans are authorised, Sheikh Hussein writes that in exchange for Shiraz Sowars and four other Indians he is prepared to accept equal number of prisoners captured on September 9th. He does not seem anxicus to accept deported persons. Apparently in exchange for English prisoners he wants German. Possibly, if military authorities approve—unless it is decided to have no dealings with Khans—exchange might be made. Bepeated to Foreign, Sir P. Cox ; sent to Tehran. S. 0. P. I., Delhi, -No. 775 P.

I think that it will have very bad effect if Darya Begi goes now as the Germans will make out that we drove Hm out of Bushire. I trust therefore you will move Persian Government ? urgently to send definite instructions telling Darya Begi what to do, and very strong telegrams through him to Kawam, Soulet and other leading men to take action in co-operation against Gendarmerie and to secure release of prisoners. If you have no objection and could get Persian Government to send telegram threatening condign punishment to rebellious Gendarmerie and Khans signed by Prime Minister and two ? I think it would have a good effect. Other friendly persons besides Darya Begi say previous telegrams sent by Prime Minister were not sufficiently minatory ? in character. At present people are ? beginning to think Persian Government do not care what happens in South and it seems most necessary that Persian Government should at once take urgent steps. 171 Telegram No. 296, dated (and received) the 7th December 1915.

From—His Britannic Majesty's ^Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart' ment, Delhi. (Addressed to Foreign Office; repeated to Petrograd and India.) Turkish Ambassador is, I hear, already announcing that Turkish troops are moving on Kermanshah in strength. Statement may he premature, but it is certain such a move will take place, and appearance of this force, even if it is not very considerable, will give tremendous impulse to German cause, as being proof that German pro mises can and will be fulfilled by them. German plan, it is said, is to avoid a decisive action with Russian troops between Hamadan and Kasvin, but, even supposing that Russian operations are completely successful, and that Germans in consequence are abandoned by most of their Mujahids, their position is likely to be far more than restored by arrival in Persia of Turkish troops. There are about l^OOO troops now in North Persia according to the Russian Minister. This seems by no means excessive considering the area over which they have to operate. It is not clear, for instance, that they can insure Tehran from a surprise (from ?) Kum, but they will certainly not be able to cope with above contemplated contingency, and should be very largely reinforced. Grand Duke intended, it is said, to send 30,000 troops, but at present there are no signs of their arrival. This discourages Government from pressing on negotiations for alliance w ith us. 177 Telegram No. 743-C., dated the 8ih December 1915. From— Major A. P.

He appears to have remained quite passive. In regard to Shaikh Jaf’ar’s attitude, I may observe that he has again started sending out agents to preach jehad and send threats to the frierdly Khans, and it is possible he may succeed in working up some religious feelings, though I do not think there is much religion about the present hostile attitude.

In this connec tion a telegram has been received by me from the Qawam-ul* Mulk which I beg to quote below for your information :— “ To—His Excellency Salar-i-Nasrat, Governor of Kazerun, “To-day, the 2nd Muharram, the Gendarmerie first occupied and seized the whole Citadel and the Government Garden, Police Department and all the fortified positions of the town and then warned the British Consul, the Bank Manager and the Superintendent of the Telegraphs that they must leave for Bushire within an hour. After an hour they arrested the Consul and all foreign subjects, and after taking them to the Sarbaz Khaneh (the soldiers’ barracks) they were sent in the direction of Bushire. I telephoned to the Gendarmerie asking them for the reason. They answered that it was the orders of the Government, and that the Persian Government had entered into the war. “ To-day also they have totally cut the wire to Tehran, and I have no information at all in this connection ; and there is no wire for instructions to reach me from the Governments HABIBULLAII.” These are the details of the matter. But I am certain that orders have been sent from Tehran, and that if there were any line open similar telegrams would have been received by the Qawam-ul-Mulk. In Tehran all the people have become ready for war. Yesterday I sent a messenger via, Ahmadi to inform Y^our Excellency. If you do not think it advisable to remain at Bushire, you might leave for Borasjun and Kazerun. I beg to state that in my opinion you might remain at Bushire for the present, so that we may see what lurther developments there are. I am very very anxious about you. Please inform me soon how you are. Sub-Enclo. No. 2 to Serial No. 182. Dated 10th Muharram 1334 ( = 18th November 1915). From— Shaikh Jamj ar, Borasjun, To—The Darya Begi, Bushire. I am never free from the anxiety on account of your difficulties, so much so that I have even forgotten my own pre-occupation. Your two esteemed letters both dated 9th Muharram (17 th November) have been received, and I am greatly astonished at their contents. I do not know whether Your Excellency is yet aware of the incident at Shiraz or not. At any rate, the messages sent you by the Ghazanfar-us-Sultaneh through Mulla Hussain Ali of Angali, and of which you had acknowledged tbe receipt in your former letter, are astonishing in view of the matters stated by you. Yesterday the guests were brought from Shiraz to Borasjun. No messages have been received from Shiraz at Borasjun, nor from Tehran or Ispahan, ^on account of the interruption of the line between the latter places and Shiraz has any communication been received here or at Shiraz. The people at Shiraz are not in the least aware of the situation at Tehran and of the policy of the Government. I do not know how you have been able to make the remarks in your letter.X* As regards your remark that there are hopes for the improvement of affairs, on this side the news from Shiraz shows the contrary. Last night new^ was received that the “soldiers” have advanced a little. It has caused some excitement here, and it is arranged that a strict enquiry should he made. It appears that small attacks have been made in the last few davs. Matters will become clearer later on. 183 No. Cf.-414, dated Eushire, the 27th November (received Gth December) 1915 (Confidential) From— Major A.

In amplification of my telegrams Nos. 720-C. and 721-C. of to-day, I have the honour to enclose, for your information, copies of correspondence which has passed between Shaikh Hussain Khan Chah kutahi and myself on the subject of the terms for the release of ‘Major O’Connor and the other Shiraz prisoners. 2. The letter from Shaikh Hussain and Zair Khidhar dated 20th November, which was sent with the Shiraz ladies, and which I should have received in the evening of the same day when I saw Mrs. Ferguson, was not delivered to me until the 23rd, after I had written my letter of the same date to which I had only time to add a postscript as the messenger was just starting. 3. The Haji Abdullah Dashti referred to in clause 2 in Shaikh Hussain’s letter of the 20th November is a notorious arms dealer who was in the habit of supplying arms and ammunition to the hostile Khans. At the beginning of the occupation I took a cash security from him to refrain from dealing in arms, and he subsequently made himself scarce. I have not seen him since,^ or there would have been no difficulty in his getting his deposit back. As this money can be given back at any time I did not mention it in my telegram No. 710-C. The inclusion of this item and those about the belongings of Wassmuss and the property removed from Wonckhaus and the German Consulate make it evident that clauses (2) and (3) of the terms are an addition by the Khans. The fact that the original ultimatum stated that the prisoners would be removed to Boras]un and the early news received at that place, and the hand ing of the prisoners over to the Khans by the Gendarmerie, lead me to suppose that the coup at Shiraz was concerted between Shiraz and Borasjun, the Khan of which place is, as I have frequently reported by iar the cleverest and most dangerous of any of the hostile Khans in this neighbourhood. In regard to the mention of the effects of W assmuss, his Munshi managed to get away with most of the money, and his horses and some other property were handed over to the Governor who sent them after him. As regards the property of Messrs. Wonckhaus and Company, when Bushire was occupied and a British Military Government instituted, the place, in so far as enemv firms situated therein were concerned, came w ithin the sphere ^ of the Controller of Hostile Trading Concerns ” at Basrah “ who was liquidating t he firm of R.

In amplification of my telegrams on the subject I have the honour to submit, for your inlormation, a copy of a narrative by Airs. Ferguson, wife of the Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia at Shiraz, describing the seizure of Major O’Connor and the British Colony at Shiraz, and their journey as captives to Shoak near Ahmedi, and from thence, in the case of the ladies of the party, te Bushire. Sub-Enclo. to Serial No. 184. Report on the seizure of the Shiraz Colony. On Wednesday, November 10th, as Mr. Ferguson, Manager of the Bank, was proceeding to office at 9 a m. he was arrested by a body of Gendarmes who stopped and surrounded his carriage, while an officer Saiyid Abul Torch Khan jumped in and held a revolver against his chest. He was told that the Bank was finished and that he was to be taken to a safe place and would have to give up his keys. He was then taken to the Gendarmerie Headquarters in town where he was forced to hand over all his Bank keys and to send for the cashier* a Persian, to bring his too. In the meantime Mr. Ayrton, the Accountant, having also been arrested in the street, arrived and his keys were also formally taken from him. At the same time Mr. Ferguson was made to write to his wife and family and on the plea of trouble in town to order them to join him in town. Mrs. Ferguson and family were at their usual morning duties when they received this message which they immediately obeyed, stepping into the carriage just as they were and having not the slightest idea that they were to be deported from Shiraz. As they drove through the town gate they were greeted with hostile shouts from the Gendarmerie guard, hut were conducted in safety to join Mr. Ferguson. Soon after them came Mr. Livingstone. Air. Zeytoon who is not a British subject was very early on the scene as a prisoner and his wife was brought in later. In the meantime the party received a note from Alajor O’Connor and his arrival with his 10 Indian sowars and accompanied by Mr. Smith, the Head of the Telegraphs, all riding with a strong Gendarmerie guard under a white flag was the signal for a tremendous burst of shouting “ Long live the Indepen dence of Persia.’’ “ Down with the English.” Major O’Connor mentioned that he received an ultimatum to surrender on pain of bombardment of the Consulate by the Maxim fixed in Air. Zeytoon’s house opposite, accompanied by threats against the Englishwomen He was given half an hour to consider, and was also informed that all the English were to be taken towards Bushire, the men to be detained in Borasjun as exchange for German and Persian prisoners, but that the women would be allowed to go on to Bushire. Major O’Connor was given three hours’ notice to pack up some necessaries, was allowed a servant and promised that each traveller should have a servant and three mules each. This promise was net kept. Major O’Connor and Mr. Smith who had also received three hours’ notice only arrived at the Gendarmerie at midday, having been busy handing over and had managed to get some things packed as well. The Bank party and Air, Livingstone on the contrary had received no notice whatever and were utterly unprepared for a journey. Airs. Smith and Mr. Pettigrew who was suffering badly from a recently healed broken leg and who was almost a cripple were also brought in and then it was decided to send off the party immediately. Mrs. Ferguson in vain begged that she might he allowed to go up to her house for a few minutes and get a few things together. The question was referred to the “ Chief ” in the next room and who was supposed to be identical with the German Consul who had been seen to go in, and was refused. Mrs. Ferguson's servant, however, was allowed to go and collect some9 W) things for the road, also Mr. Ayrton’s man, but when they returned with them they found their masters gone and were not allowed to follow them, though they expressed their willingness to. The womenfolk having protested against riding mules were promised “ kajavehs,” but they were not allowed to wait for them but were permitted the use of the Bank Manager’s carriage and hurried off out of Shiraz. The men were allowed to ride their horses of which there were 16 belonging to the British Government which the Consul brought away with him It was now 3 p.M. and the party duly started without having had any food since 8-30 a.m. At the last minute Mr. Pettigrew was kejt back as well as Mr. and Mrs. Zeytoon. The first halt was made at the Baghi Jennett, then after a half hour’s rest the party arrived at dusk at Chenerdar and hoped to spend the night there, all being tired out. But on the arrival of the baggage and “ kajavehs ” at midnight they were roused again. Mr. Pettigrew and Mr. Misso also arrived, the latter a Cingalese Bank clerk having refused to remain behind. They balanced each other in kajavehs and so the party of 7 men and 4 womenfolk— one of them girl of 11—and 10 sowars, besides a British Indian refugee from Mesopotamia travelled the whole night in bitter cold, on the coldest stage on the whole road, arriving benumbed and worn out at 7 a.m. at Khaneh Zenian on November 11th. The party was in charge of the officer who arrested the Bank staff and who now became quite friendly and chatty. He allowed them to stay there all day and to make themselves as comfortable as possible, at the same time guarding them very strictly and allowing no liberty whatever. An early start was made next day and after a short rest at Dashtarjin Telegraph Office, Mian Kotal, was reached in safety and no untoward incident occurred. But the next day’s march was a very different affair. Till now the Gendarmerie officers had been outwardly friendly and had talked freely with their prisoners and accepted the latter’s offers of smokes, giving no hint of the hostility in store for them at Kazerun. As the little party approached the town quite unsuspiciously they^ were met first l* farsahhs away—by a large body of horsemen headed by the Nasr-i- Divan who rode up and joined the Consul. At the same time some 3,000 townspeople of all sorts poured out to meet the little cavalcade. Boys and men closed in on both sides of the prisoners, hooting, jeering, cursing, and screaming insults at the womenfolk. They spat at them and insulted them in every manner, while bands of women placed at different points of vantage uttered a shrill whinnying cry of derision in chorus. The Mullahs headed separate detachments and raised the cries against the British and for the Independence of Persia, but after a time utter confusion reigned and no cry was distinctly audible beyond a hoarse shout of rage and nothing visible but a seethin' mass of people surging in clouds of dust. The Britishers never moved a muscfe which enraged the populace and when ^ they began to throw stones the Gendarmes looked uneasy and anxious. Pinally the procession arrived at the Gendarmerie garden where amid renewed hoots the party were dismounted and snown to their quarters. These were a pleasant surprise and the Gendarme officer expressed his apologies for the behaviour of the mob, although he well knew that an organized hostile reception was awaiting the prisoners. He promised that they should not be subjected to any further demonstrations in Hazerun and on the morrow there was no crowd to witness the departure. But tie next unpleasant surprise was the confiscation—just as the start was being made or all the horses. An order from the Shiraz “ Committee for the Preservation of the Independence of Persia ” as it called itself came by wire ordering the con fiscation, so all the Government horses (16 in all) as well as Mr Ayrtons private horse were kept. Mr. Livingstone’s horse had been stolen the first day out while his groom was bringing it after him. Mr. Ferguson had been ridine a Government horse, his carriage and two horses having been seized at Chenardar at the first long halt. From Kazerun onwards the men had to ride baggage mules all except Major O’Connor, who was given a horse.10 At Kamarij another body of tribesmen rode out to meet the prisoners and escorted them into the strong Gendarmerie fortress in intense silence and with great digmty. Here they were handed over to Sultan Ahmed Khan, Captain of the Borasjun Gendarmerie post who came up to meet them and who treated them with kindness and respect. He was always ready to converse with any . member of the party and his serious and sincere manner commanded their respect and confidence. Both at Kamarij and Konartakhteh he arranged comfortable quarters. A.t the latter place he allowed other Gendarme officers and Ghulam Hussain Qashkuli, a Qashkai Chief know r n to the British Consulate, to come and see Major O’Connor and talk the matter over. The Qashkuli talked of the possibility of the Soulet-ud-Douleh conferring with the other Heads at Borasjun, which happy idea, how ever, was not carried out. There w r as no incident at Baliki and the prisoners began to realize how utterly they wore in the grip of the enemy as they approached Borasjun. The big caravanserai was a veritable fortress, bristling with armed men at every point. The party arrived on the 9th Moharram and passed in silence through crowds of sowars, being placed in a ‘‘ Balakhaneh ” with a very strong guard. They were told that Mr. Wassmuss was there too. Soon after the arrival the Moharram ceremonies were started and the party was warned not to show itself to any Persians below. Here a conference was held and Sultan Ahmed Khan explained the danger of keeping the men in Borasjun as at first suggested on account of the determination of Ghazan- far-us-Sultaneh who w'as in the neighbourhood to get possession of Mr. Ferguson’s person in revenge for the confiscation of his Bank deposit by the British Government It was here stated that no prisoner would be accepted in exchange for the Bank Manager, that he w^ould be held till 40,000 Tumans were paid against him. There were one or two Persians in Borasjun who spoke English and act as interpreters. The next morning the 10th Moharram the populace w r orked itself into such a state of frenzy that it rushed the caravanserai courtyard and swarmed upstairs to attack the prisoners w r ilh shouts of rage, before they were driven j dow n by the Gendarmerie guard In the meantime Mr. Wassmuss had w r alked several times through the prisoners’ courtyard, dressed as a tribesman. The Consul thought it advisable under the circumstances to see him and so asked for an interview which was granted. Mr Wassmuss expressed his regrets for Major O’Connor’s present state and said that the individual must suffer for his Government. The little band of ten Indian sowars were here told that they must remain in Borasjun though they begged to be allowed to accompany their Consul. The senior Duffedar wns granted leave to go with him to Shoak, ivhere it was decided to send him back to the others. When the little party left in the afternoon for Shoak, going east and off the Ahmedi road, Mr. Wassmuss accompanied it and conversed a little with the ladies with whom he had been w ell acquainted. Arrived at Shoak, a Tangis- tani, village of straw covered huts, there were two large tents ready and after a meal another conference including Mr. Wassmuss, Sultan Ahmed Khan and Shaikh Hussain’s son was held. At this meeting Sultan Ahmed Khan strong ly combated the demand of the others that 2 ladies should be held as hostages for Mrs. Eisenhut and carried his point. Otherwise the demands were the same as before, viz .:— 1 2 3 (1) The recall of all Germans deported by the British and the giving back of all prisoners of war. (2) The return of all confiscated monies. (3) The withdrawal of all troops from Bushire. This latter demand being made for the first time at Shoak. The prisoners w r ere formally handed over to the Tangistani Chiefs. Shaikh Izzl Khan being head, and on the morning of the i8th the parties were11 * separated. The men’s baggage was put on camels and the womenfolk still in the care of Sultan Ahmed Khan were taken to Chahkutah, while the men were to proceed to Ahram, Mr. Wassmuss’s headquarters. On the way Mrs. Ferguson was rather ill from distress and the discomfort of the kajaveh so Sultan Ahmed Khan called a halt at Chahkutah for a little rest. Mr. Mass- muss was riding alongside and talking with Miss Ferguson which the tribesmen greatly resented. Mr. Wassmuss at Chahkutah invited the ladies into a carpet ed room, and on Sultan Ahmed Khan’s explaining that he had a private room for them Mr. Wassmuss replied that it was not necessary for English women as they did not cover their faces. Mrs. Ferguson immediately seeing the drift of this remark got up and accepted Sultan Ahmed Khan’s offer of a more private room. Thereupon on the ladies’ retreat there was quite a scene. Sultan Ahmed Khan severely reprimanded Mr. Wassmuss for talking to the ladies and trying to associate with them and Mr. Wassmuss shouted that the ladies wished it. Thereupon a man rushed over and enquired of Mrs. Fergu son if this were so and on her reply that she trusted implicitly to Sultan Ahmed Khan and would sit where he wished her to, the messenger dashed back in triumph with the answer and orders were given aloud that Mr. AV assmuss was not to be allowed to go near the ladies. An immediate start was made again and Miss Ferguson overheard the men cursing Mr. AV assmuss and saying he was the cause of the death of so many^ of their men. Arrived at Ahmedi the ladies were conducted to Shaikh H ussain’s private house and comfortable quarters allotted them After a short interval Shaikh Hussain himself asked permission to see them and was ushered in. He came to business directly and charged Mrs. Ferguson with the delivery of his messages and terms to the Kesident in Bushire.^ He explained at length his IS years’ firm friendship for the British and its rupture through the violation of the neutrality of Persia by the deportation of the German Consul and Mr. and Mrs. Eiscnhut. The fact of there being a lady in the case seems to have roused the tribes to a pitch of fury. They contrasted the treatment meted out to the ladies present to that accorded to Mrs Eisenhut. Shaikh Hussain was very decided on this point and declared nothing ^\ould satisfy the tribes but the restitution to the neutral soil of Persia of the deported people. He demanded the monies, as mentioned before and the withdrawal of English troops from Bushire. Mrs. Ferguson asked him whom the British Government was to treat with in this case as the tribes were in revolt and did not acknow- led &lt;re the Persian Government. He replied emphatically that he was the leader of the tribes in the south and that all communications must be addressed to Asked what protection the British would have in the case of the with drawal of the troops, he said he would guarantee tbe life of every Britisher and would also undertake to keep complete order in the district When asked what would become of Mr. Wassmuss in the event of the British y 1 ™!™, to his demands, he said that the latter would be immediately romoved and all other German agents. He expatiated at length on his intense desire for peace. At the same time he said the whole of South Pei sia is revolt, that the tribes are all ready and the Northern army on its way from Kazerun. That they were a poor people but every man uas reat, y t ? , the independence of Persia and that they would not tolerate British inter ference any more. Shaikh Hussain said the tribes were more powerful than the British thought, that the Qawam and Soulet were utterly powerless to raise a finn-er against the “ Mileti ” as this new popular movement is called and would undoubtedly 'O with them in the event of hostilities. Also that the Germans were gradually getting through to ^ he able to send an army to heip them. Shaikh Hussain was particularly bitter against Mr. Chick and complained that Bushire was treated as if it were a portion of India and not of a free, independent kmgd m. Fimllv he charged Mrs. Ferguson to tell the Besident that he gave itn 4 da? o fgrace for a reply of some sort. That if on the 5th morning no repl7came the war would begin and that he meant every word he said in deadly earnest Mrs. Ferguson promised to convey these messages and Shaikh Hussain also wrote them down—at least the demands—and handed the letter •n Persian to Moussa Yeb Khan, Major O’Connor’s confidential servant,12 who accompanied the ladies. Next morning a tribeswoman was sent in to the ladies to search their persons and belongings for any papers, of which of course there were none. When the ladies said good bve to Shaikh Hussain he harangued them at some length in a loud voice before all his people, reiterating his demands of the previous evening, then he let them go. Sultan Ahmed Khan now took the opportunity of having his say. He expatiated greatly on the insult to Persia in the deportation of the Germans and also on the love of the Persian for their strip of sandy desert which they were determined to have to themselves. He said he longed for peace and friendship with England, but as long as the British annoyed them they could not be friends. He was very frank about Mr. W assmuss and said that the Persians cared nothing for Germany which was far away and were only making use of Mr. Wassmuss for their own ends. Directly they were friends with Britain they would deliver Mr. Wassmuss to her dead or alive, that as long as they were enemies with England they would be friends with Mr. Wassmuss and vice versa. He was- very calm and decided and very up to date in his facts. He said that England could not permit a second Muhammmadan war just now, that if Persia went to war with her, Afghanistan would most certainly join in and also the Turco man tribes and that in this way India would be seriously threatenea and no one knew when the war would stop. He admitted the fac* that Mr. Wassmuss would do his best to prevent a peaceful solution of the difficulty. He said he knew Mr. Was muss did not want the British to withdraw from Bush me as that would foil his purpose of creating a war. He argued that England’s best and wisest plan was to comply nith Persia’s demands through the “ Mileti ” and thus cut the ground from beneath Mr. Wassmuss’s feet, leaving the Persians no further reasons for complaint. In this event Persia would welcome a return to friend ship with England which she ardently desires with the strict preservation of her neutrality. As Sultan Ahmed Khan is a member of the “ Committee for the Preser vation of the Independence of Persia” at Shiraz it is to be presumed these are the views animating the wdiole of the Gendarmerie. Sultan Ahmed Khan brought the ladies with every consideration to just beyond +he last Gendar merie post where he paHed from them, sending them on with 6 Gendarmes whom he recommended to Mrs Eerguson’s care, who handed the ladies over to the British and w T ho in return were treated kindly and not detained a minute.

Copies to the “ Tazianah/* “ Jam-i-Jam” and “ Hayat.” Of course you are perfectly aware of the encroachment and aggression of the British The people of the south, particularly the Mujahidin of Borasjun, Tan^istan and Dashti and Dashtistan, have risen to defend their honour and country against that aggression and have well been able to hold them in check. When the English saw that they could effect nothing as far as the nation was concerned, they had recourse to the Government authorities with whom they arranged an understanding for peace, and they asked the Mujahidin to defer their attacks. The Mujahidin in obedience to the orders of the Govern ment and in order that they should not allege that we are the authors of dis turbances, took no action. The Darya Begi Sardar was ordered by the Government to proceed to Bushire. He went once as far as Shief and came back owing to the refusal on the part of the British. The matter was again reported to the Government and an answer was received saying that it was due to a misunderstanding, and ordering him again to leave. We were still exchanging views when it became clear from a correct source that this agreement and the evacuation of Bushire were conditional on the punishment of the Mujahidin of Islam, namely, the zealous Chiefs Gha' zanfar-us-Sultaneh, Shaikh Hussain Khan and Zair Khidhar Khan and all the tribesmen who have helped them—a treachery and humiliation to which no Muhammadan can agree. In light of this matter, it is necessary that you should inform all the towns of the policy and attitude of the Government, stating that if we embark on hostile operations, it is meant to preserve the National Honour and not to disobey the orders of the State.

You are of course well aware of the intrigues of the British and of the efforts of the Government authorities in delaying action by the Mujahidin and in pacifying the excitement of the people, and are well aquainted with the present situation at Bushire, where the British still continue their arbitrary steps, increase their forces and the captivity of the people has assumed greater proportions, while the Darya Begi has received no instructions and does not know where he is. For these reasons, I informed the Darya Begi urgently that he should leave Bashire. In these circumstances, holding as you do high rank, in your love for Islam and your natural favour, what outright attitude and effective action have you taken to secure the object in view and to discharge your duties. The people of Dashti, who hold the first rank in bravery and devoutness, have in a collected body presented themselves with great enthusiasm at the camp of the Mujahidin. (N. B. by H. G. C. Visit of Jamal Khan’s son with 15 men.) I request that you will be good enough to telegraph the result of your steps to secure means for the end. From this side due notice has been given to the Government authorities and it would be as well if you would send them a final notice. Important Detention.— 2nd Muharram, before noon, the Gendar merie Department, in compliance with the orders of the Government, removed the British Consul from the Consulate to the Department, and sealed the Imperial Bank with wax under special arrangements, and special guards have been stationed there by the Department. This event, and the way in which it came to pass, conveys an impression that the Persian Government has entered into the war. Full details will be given in the next issue. Sub-Enclo.

I have received your esteemed letter by the hands of Muhammad Abbas, and I have taken note of the contents. But what alternative should be adopted ? You and I have been caught “ What God wishes is done and what He does not wish will not be done ”. There is no alternative except that of forbearance and ^ patience, aund endeavouring to attain the object. God Almighty has destined it so, and He is our helper! Perhaps it will be a store for us if we have entertained a right intention. When patience is complete, success will be ultimately secured. I have seen the telegrams. You are of coiyse well aware What can Qawam-ul-Mulk or anyone else now do when they (the confederates) hav c attained their object ?After all you should reflect how long can the people wait ? For the last two months the Mujahidin have been restrained, and Your Excellency is being kept at Bushire without knowing what to do. Of course after becoming despondent of the steps by the Government, the nation will certainly take action. The English have been always soothing the “ nation ” and Govern ment with political devices, stratagems and lies. The nation having realised this will proceed to take such action as it is in duty bound to take. 186 Telegram P., No. 154, dated (and received) the 9th December 1915.

He asked what news Russian Minister had from Hamadan. He appeared much relieved at learning strong body of rebels had been routed by Russians. ^ I am inclined to think that, while sincerely anxious to conclude alliance.

Yesterday eyening late Prime mister called He^begau' by talking of resigning as he said he could no ,pe to carry through his policy of alliance in face of pubhc opimon.Offensive alliance against Turkey was impossible and would result in civil war. Persia did net wish to get involved in war and preferred to maintain neutra lity.^ He suggested that by pointing out the advantages to Persia of alliance he should continue for the present his efforts to win over public opinion and when the country w^as less hostile to idea begin negotiations. H e said that after some (?) months experience to talk of policy of neutrality which would inevitably result in Persia being forced to join our enemies was idle. No middle course w 7 as possible. Persia must be with us or against us and Government had better rellect seriously on consequences both immediate and future to Persia if she alknved herself to be led to join our enemies by pressure of an ignorant and venal public opinion ; negotiations should com mence at once. -Russian Minister added that His Highness should remember that there was Russian force at Kasvin which might take matters into its ow r n hands.

Soulet must secure release of prisoners and throw whole weight of his tribesmen on our side for pacification of country and arrest or expulsion German agents in return for these amenities. (One thousand ?) rifles and ammunition w r ould be given with the approval of Persian Government. We could I think agree to all these terms. The cash could be taken from money now in deposit in Bushire belonging to Sheikh Hussain and the Khan of Borajan (Borasjun?), if Soulet is successful. It w ould be made clear to Soulet that the course he was intended to pursue was to declare himself openly on our side and by show ing of force and threats to intimidate Khans into surrendering the prisoners.

British Consul, Kerman, reports that situation of himself and colony is most precarious. Governor-General appears to be doing what he can hut force at his disposal is inadequate and he has very few cartridges in store Consul says that only course is to evacuate town at once while road to Bunder Abbas is still open unless a strong force of Persian Cossacks is sent at once. His views are confirmed by Bussian Consul and by reports of Indo- European Telegraph Department Superintendent. Even if Cossacks or any other force were available it is evident that no force could reach Kerman in time with matter as critical as this. It is just possible that Russian operation at ilamadan and still more their advance to Kum if it should take (?) place might relieve tension (?) of Kerman situation but opposite is quite as likely to happen and meantime evacuation seems inevitable unless Government of India are able to send a small force with spare ammunition for Bakhtiaris.

I may perhaps be able later to reduce cost somewhat by converting horsemen into camel sowars. These rates of pay are somewhat higher than rates paid in Persian Army, but they compare very favourably with rates being given to Hazaras who are of course more disciplined men. If owing to recent events in Mesopotamia (about which I have heard nothing for a week) a rapid augmentation of our forces should ever be consi dered desirable I can enlist in Sistan a much larger number of men includ ing most of the regular soldiers and revenue gendarmerie. These men can only be relied on while they believe our side to be winning side which they do at present. I have nearly completed enlisting 200 men sanctioned. Details will be reported on completion by post. 204 Telegram P., No. 524)-F., dated (and receivedjthe 12th December 1915.

They said that in face of public opinion it was impossible to conclude alliance at present and President, after four hours conversation, said that he would submit following to his collea gues :— Persia is to adopt policy of implicit neutrality and Cossacks Brigade is to be increased to 10,000 men with Bussian Officers in order to have force capable of putting down German agitation. Two Powers to give or to assist Persia to obtain arms, etc., to agree to small increase of.import duties on sugar and cotton goods to provide for expenses and to yield (?) some of six points mentioned in my telegram No. 442.

Russian Minister does not know what troops are at Baratoff’s disposal, but from reports of His Majesty’s Consul at Jtesht I gather that there are about fifteen thousand at present and seven thousand more are on the way. General Officer Commanding, Russian forces, keeps his movements very secret. He seems to have com menced operations against Hamadan by sending force to Nr.baran on December 3rd. He then turned Sultan (?) Bulaghpass which was captured without loss while enemy had about one hundred and twenty killed. Persian official reports state that his troops are entering Hamadan and that enemy has retired to Dowlatabad and Barujird. From Persian accounts it seems that a Russian force is engaged near Saveh, south of Tehran and Hamadan road, with Mujahidin. 209 Telegram R., No. 527-F., dated the 13th (received 14th) December 1915.

The presence of Russian troops in certain localities of Northern Persia is not of recent date, as you are well aware, and their presence at the present time and their necessary reinforcement are all the more essential in view of the agitation which has been actively propagated and stimulated by German agents and their Allies and which have resulted in several most serious outrages in various parts of Persia. The presence of Russian troops is solely with the object of protecting foreign lives and.properties against the dangers which were and are menacing them; and the Persian Government are under no misapprehension in regard to the justifiable purpose for which these troops have been strengthened and placed in a position to render immediate aid and protection: when re quired.

Little progress is being made to improve the situation owing to divisions in Cabinet. Government is unwilling to take any action itself and professedly in order to give them time to bring pressure on mutinous gendarmerie at Hamadan are imploring Pussian Minister not to allow troops to march on that town and reinstate Consul there. Pussian Commander whose preparations ? do not seem to be quite finished has agreed to stand for a time strictly on defensive and this concession encourages Government to ask troops stationed on Hamadan road be withdrawn to Kasvin. To agree to such a suggestion would be to furnish proof of statements circulated by Germans that numbers of Pussian troops are really far below what we believe and will enable Germans considerably to increase their levies not only at Hamadan but also in Kurdistan and at Sultanbad, Kum Kermanshah, Ispahan. There are already said to be at Hamadan eight thousand Mujahidin and three thousand gendermes. It therefore appears imperative that decisive blow should be struck at soon as possible and this where enemy is in greatest force, viz., at Hamadan. My Pussian colleague entirely agrees with me.

PRECIS. Arrest of the British Consul and Colony at Shiraz, u. E. s to P r O. London. *3 Enclo. to Serial No. 151. o No. Cf.-898, dated Busbire, the 2ist November 1915 (Confidential). From -Major A.

In amplification of my telegram No. 710-0., dated to-day. J have the honour to submit further particulars regarding the arrest of His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, and the British Colony there. It appears that on the morning of the 10th instant the Gendarmerie suddenly and quietly occupied all the posts of vantage in the Town of Shiraz, and that at about 9 a m. an Ultimatum, a copy of which I annex, was presented to Major O’Connor by an anonymous body styling itself “ The National Committee for the Protection of the Independence of Persia” Major O’Connor tvas given half an hour to accept the terms of the Ultimatum, and informed that if he did not do so, the houses of the British Residents would be bombarded. Subsequently three hours were given to the British subjects to pack up such things as they could take away. Actually less time * was given, and in less than three hours the British Consul and Colony were hurried off. e e o On the 17th instant the party arrived at Borasjun ; it consisted of Major O’Connor, Mr. Perguson, Manager of the Shiraz Branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia, Mrs. Perguson and two Misses Perguson, Mr. Smith (Assistant Superintendent of Telegraphs) and Mrs. Smith, Mr. Ayrton, Accountant of the Imperial Bank of Persia, Mr. Pettigrew, Clerk, Indo-European Telegraph Department, Mr. Livingstone, a merchant of Shiraz, Mr. Masso, the Cinghalese Head Clerk of the Bank, and the Consular escort of ten sowars of the 10th Duke of Cambridge’s Own Lancers (Hodsoa’s Dorse). £ Prom Borasjun the party was taken on towards Ahraedi by an indirect route halting at a place called Shohak. Prom this point the men were taken in to Tangistan under a Gendarmerie escort and apparently in charge of one of Shaikh Hussain’s sons and Wassmuss, while the ladies w r ere sent to Bushire under escort. The ladies, Mrs. Ferguson and her twn daughters, and Mrs. Smith, arrived at Bushire safely in the afternoon of the 20th instant. New r s of the arrest of Major O’Connor was first received in your telegram No. 451-F. of November 12th, and the next day I heard the news again from His Excellency the Darya Begi as I reported in my telegram No. 702-C., dated 13th November. These reports were, however, not credited in view of the improved situation at Tehran. The first authentic news I received of the arrest and deportation of the British Colony was in a letter sent by Major O’Connor from Borasjun dated 17th November and received by me on the 18th November. It did not give me any definite news beyond what I reported in my telegram No. 705-C. of the 18th November. Mrs, Perguson brought me a letter from Major O’Connor and informed me that she had been entrusted by Shaikh Hussain with a message for me. No letter from Shaikh Hussain or any one else claiming to speak for the National Committee has yet reached me. In Major O’Connor’s letter was enclosed a copy of the “ National Committee’s ” Ultimatum and a copy of the terms proposed by “ the Khans.” The terms proposed by the Khans according to Major O’Connor’s letter are :— (1) The return of all Germans and Persians arrested on the neutral soil of Persia. (2) The return of certain moneys belonging to Shaikh Hussain and Ghazanfar-us-Sultaneh attached during the British occupation. (3) The evacuation of Bushire, i e., the removal of all British troops. The last two of these terms have apparently been added by the Khans as the Ultimatum only says that the Consul must agree for himself and the British Colony to be provisionally arrested and despatched to Porasjun there tobe exchanged with all Persian and German prisoners arrested on the neutral soil of Persia ; no mention is made of the money or the evacuation of Bushire. This last condition has been constantly put forward by the Klians but the matter of the restoration of the money has not, so far as I can recollect, been made before. This money I may mention consists of two deposits, one of tumans 10,000 belonging to Shaikh Hussain deposited with Haji Abdul Basul Rais-ut-Tujjar, and the second tumans 15,000 deposited in the Imperial Bank of Persia by Ghazanfar-us-Sultaneh. His Excellency Muwaqqar-ud-Dowleh was anxious to attach these two sums and in fact did attach the first and several times asked me to agree to attaching the second. I told His Excellency that although Ghazanfar was known to be the prime mover in the confederacy it would be best to wait till he did something overt. When he announced that he was going to have the Telegraph lines cut and did so, it seemed to me that the time had come and so I attached the money. Muwaqqar-ud-Dowleh thought that attaching this money would bring these two Khans to their senses, but, it failed to do so. Ghazanfar’s entire deposit is still in the Bank, but nearly 2,000 tumans out of Shaikh Hussain’s has been utilised in compensating British Kesidents here for losses incurred during the raids made by Shaikh Hussain’s men and led by Shaikh Hussain’s sons. I have gone into this question in some detail as Mrs Eerguson states that Shaikh Hussain informed her that Mr. Eerguson’s release would depend upon the repayment of these sums, whether all the German and Persian prisoners were returned or not. On the afternoon before she left Shaikh Hussain had a long talk with Mrs. Ferguson and appears to have given rein to his imagina tion, and indulged more than ever in his usual bombastic talk. He stated that the whole of Southern Persia was now against us and would declare war on us in Bushire and never stop until all the troops had been driven out, and the prisoners given back. Directly that was done he, Shaikh Hussain, would guarantee the safety of British lives and property in Bushire and the whole of Persia would be sincerely friendly, and everybody would much prefer being friends ^ith England than with Germany. He added that if we did not accept the terms and war broke out we should be involved in another Muhammadan war and India wmuld be endangered ; he knew England could not stand this and hoped we should accept the terms suggested 1 The fact that a petty village headman, who can with difficulty raise 200 men should assume charge of the business and talk in this strain, shovs in what a topsy turvy condition Persia now is. No doubt he has been well instructed by Wassmuss,—whom, as he told Mrs. Ferguson the Khans w^ere using for their ow r n ends 1—and considers that the allies are at their last gasp. Begarding the journey from Shiraz Mrs. Eerguson says the members of the party were treated kindly by Mirza Ahmed, a Sultan of the Gendarmerie, who commanded the escort. They met wdth a very hostile reception on arrival at Kazerun ; a large crowd had assembled and greeted them with curses and spat at them, etc. The Gendarmes were rather afraid of a disturbance but got them through all right. At Kazerun the private horses of the party and the sowers horses were seized and from thence they all had to scramble on baggage mules or walk. The general attitude of the people seems to be hostile. The report that some of Soulet-ud-Dowleh’s men were trying to intercept the party turns out to be incorrect. The party came straight through. I am doubtful whether Government would desire me to enter into negotia tions regarding the prisoners as it may be intended to try and effect their release through the Persian Government. At the present moment it would be difficult to know with whom to negotiate and who represents the “ National Committee of the Protection of Persian Independence I propose, therefore, for the moment (as already reported telegraphically) to answer Major O’Connor’s letter by saying that the wdiole matter has been reported in detail to Govern ment and that of course I cannot enter into negotiations without authority, meanwffiile it would probably help matters if the individual who considers himself in charge of the prisoners would send in his proposals in writing together with some satisfactory guarantee that he is in a position to treat and is empowered by the Committee to do so.6 There is nothing to report to-day. The English Consul and English Colony at Shiraz have been made prisoners by the Gendarmerie and taken to Borasjun where they are now be d in confinement. According to a telegram from Aghai Kawam-ul-Mulk received from Kazerun the Gendarmerie on the 2nd Muharram seized all the Government buildings at Shiraz and the British under the pretext that orders had been received from the exalted Government and war had been declared. T request Your Hishness will take immediate steps to dispel these false state ments and to secure the liberation of the English Consul and Colony and the nunishment of the guilty parties. I will telegraph further details when avail able It is very necessary that the Prime Minister should declare through me that Shaikh Hussain Chahkutah, Zair Khidhar _ Tangistam and Ghazanfar-es- Sultaneh of Borasjun are rebels and outlaws in the eyes of Government and the Nation and that orders should be sent from His Imperial Majesty e Shah to Sardar Asbair to effect their arrest and removal to Tehran, the release of the English prisoners and also the deportation oi YV assmuss. 153 Telegram P., No. 286, dated (and received) the 2nd December 1915. p r0in —His Britannic Maiesty's Consul, Kerman, i _ To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Delhi.

From—His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Delhi. (Addressed Foreign Office; repeated India, Petrograd) Clear line. Of extent of General Nixon’s rererse I have not exact knowledge, but it appears to have been far more serious than indicated in any telegram I have received yet judgingfrom Viceroy’s telegram No. 118 yesterday. If this is so chance of concluding an alliance with Persia is affected most unfavourably. Baghdad being relieved and Nixon being in no position for the present presumably to resume advance I submit it may be assumed enemy will devote all his attention to his main objective that is forcing Persia into war againt us. This will be best achieved by sending into Persia all troops that can be spared from watching Nixon with practical certainty of rais ing at least western provinces against Entente. Appearance of Turkish Army reinforced by gendarmerie and by local levies already being collected will fire Persia with hope of driving out Russians. This combined with promises held out by Germans as stated in your telegram No. 427, will make it extiemely hard for any Cabinet to join us except on terms of a most attractive nature. We have in fact to outbid German terms so heavily as to outweigh dis advantages of military position in w T hich in Persian eyes we shall be if and when the Turkish force appears here. How many Russian troops are now in Persia I do not know but accounts have placed them at a far lower figure than we have been led to expect. Russian Minister believes that Grand Duke intends to send altogether 40,000. This w r ill be none too many in contingency I foresee. Having twice put us off Prime Minister now promises to inform us on Monday of- Persian requirements but I have learned direct that points being considered by Cabinet are as follows:— First. Cession of Persian territory embracing holy places including (Khadi- main) ? Haramain, viz., Baghdad. Second. Cancellation of all Persia’s debts to Great Britain and Russia Third. Two Powers to supply arms and ammuni tion for 50,000 men. Fourth. Large monthly subvention during war. Fifth. Abrogation of 1907 convention. Sixth. Stipulations of 1911 ultimatum to be cancelled. Seventh. Large modifications of treaty (of) Turkomanchai. Eighth. Lean of 8 million pounds to be arranged after wmr by international syndicate. Ninth. Revision of tariff. Tenth. In Persia foreigners to possess real estate on same conditions as exist in Turkey. Eleventh. Two Powers to guarantee independence and integrity of Persia. Of course I have wmrned Prime Minister against making exhorbitant terms such as point 1, but I have no great confidence that he will be strong enough to stand firm against pertinacious pro-German party in Cabinet, possibly whole list may be presented to us. If my appreciation of Nixon’s position and its consequences is approxi mately correct immediate acceptance of Persian terms it appears to me affords only hope of securing alliance, but even so, considering opportunity there will be for pro-Germans to prolong negotiations chance is not rosy. A regards point two (one ?) I would remark that when Nixon is again able to advance Bakhtiari (interest in ?) holy places w'ould secure us the support of any number of tribesmen. On the other hand his communications along Tigris with Frontier tribesmen ( ? actively) hostile would be very seriously hampered to say least of it. 164 Telegram P., dated (and received) the 5th December 1915.

Lord ROBERT CECIL: I am unable to add anything to the communication which was issued to the Press on the 24th instant, as I have received no further details on the subject, except that the Persian Government have recalled the foreign instructor who was in command of the gendarmerie in Ears. I should add that the Swedish Government have always shown readiness in meeting any wishes ex pressed to them in regard to any Swedish instructors of gendarmerie when it was in their power, and there can be no ques tion of the Swedish Government being in any way responsible for the conduct of the gendarmes, or for anything the officers of the gendarmerie may or may not have done. The officers are, of course, not Swedish officers in the sense of being under the orders of the Swedish Government at all. The more correct description would be Persian gendarmerie instructors of Swedish nationality. V&gt; f 4 i■ Copy. No. 192. (201332) 3 T 0 C K H 0 L M f December 13th, 1915. !

I propose to reply to a parliamentary Question on Tuesday next to tie effect that it is incorrect to describe gendarmerie officers as 'Swedish officers' in the sense tuat tiey are in any way under the orders of the Swedish Government. I will add that Swedish Government have always shown readiness to meet our wishes in regard to Swedish instruction of gendarmerie whenever it was in their power to do so and that there can be no question of the Swedish Government being in any way responsible for the conduct of the gendarmes or for anything the officers of gendarmerie may or may not have done. you may inform minister for Foreign Affairs and say I will gladly do what I can to remove misconception of which he complains and which is quite unfounded.12 J IS ) In any further communica tion on this subject, please quote No /i*i and address— The Under-Secretary of State Foreign Office, ^ London. j!i' i ’5 1916 7 The Under-Secretarv of State for Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to the Undersecretary of State for and, by direction of the Secretary °f State, transtnits herewith cop cy of the under-mentioned paper.
