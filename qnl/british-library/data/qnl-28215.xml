On the other side it can be said that the present status quo is noh entirely unsatisfactory from the point of view of H.M.G. The Sheikh remains in de facto possession of the gardens and the Iraq Government, in view of the promise which was given by King Feisal and repeated by King Ghazi, are under | a moral obligation to make all possible efforts to prevent the Sheikh from being' dispossessed. It would appear, therefore, that there are considerable arguments leaving things as they are so far as the question of possession is concerned. This does not, however, necessarily mean that we should do nothing in regard to implementing our financial obligations to the Sheikh. This Office has already urged upon the Foreign Office (see India Office letters P.Z.8660/35 and P.Z.9/36) that the question of possession might now with advantage be separated from the financial question, and that immediate steps should be taken to compensate the Sheikh for the taxation which he has already paid and to discharge our future liabilities by a lump sum payment. The Treasury have recently stated that the sooner the financial question is settled the better (see Mr. Hale's letters to Mr. Rendel of'lSh'and 24th / February), and it seems desirable that we should now concentrate on this aspect of the question. it is submitted that we should write to the Foreign Office agreeing with Mr. Hale’s view and suggesting that the Departments concerned should meet in the near future to discuss means oi arriving at sSae amount wh-dboh chculd be paid to the Sheikh.. o^l — - tt** 9 *’ 6 3939 5000 7/35 [inute Paper. ft «1* P.Z. 1581/36. Department. There are 5 difficulties in regard to the possession question: (1) The Sheikh may have encroached on land adjacent to his gardens (as at 1914); (2) The Sheikh almost certainly has added to his gardens (as at 1914) land reclaimed from the water; (3) The Sheikh may have 1 taah 1 rights outstanding against him (a concise explanation of these rights is given at P.Z.1180); (4) There may he claims by members of his family; (5) There are at present cases pending in the Iraqi Courts. One case the Sheikh allowed to come into Court (the Bashiyeh case) and it went against him: but it is not clear whether the verdict has in fact been put into effect. These cases are from dodinonts portions of the Faddhigiyah estate. The present suggestion from the Treasury is that the question of possession should be left in the air. Prima facie this seems quite sound, but we should no doubt satisfy ourselves as to any possible dangers which leaving the question in the air might involve. Taking the above points seriatim_«_~ (1) encroachment. If the Sheikh has encroached, we had better leave well alone. (2) pco-inimed land can be registered. The Sheikh | ls prepared to do this.

But it is not, pernap II I \( 1 ' i n; (4) Family claims* This seems definitely a matter for the Sheikh to fight out with his family, as Col.Fowle j suggests. (5) Claims made to Iraqi Courts. This is the only real snag so far&amp;s one can see. If the question of possession is left in the air, and the attempt to get a valid title to all the gardens from the Iraqi Government in black and white is abandoned, at any rate for the present, it is essential that the cases of claimants against the Sheikh should be kept out of Court. If they go into Court, they may well go against him, whatever the merits of his case. He apparently thought he had a cast-iron case over Bashiyeh, allowed the case to come into Court and lost. This precedent may make it more difficult for him to maintain for the future that he is an independent sovereign and not amenable to the Ira^i Courts but presumably not impossible. m any case, the Iraqi Government is presumably able to keep cases out of Courts if it wishes. The question whether Mr.Hale’s suggestion respect is feasible is a question which can only be answered by the Embassy. Subject to their views and to any comments from India or the Gulf, it seems reasonable to agree with Mr.Hale that the balance of advantage lies with leaving the possession question aside and concentrating on the Compensation question. As regards compensation, we have to consider (a) what the Sheikh has already paid and is paying in taxation; (b) the future. The Treasury would like to oav a P y a lump sum to cover the whole lot. This seems reasonable, and it must clearly consist of the actual equivalent of (a) ^ a sum representing/inute Pap©^- Department. 3939 5000 7/35 representing the capitalised value of the taxation which the Sheikh for the future is likely to have to pay. One snag arises on this. It is proposed to get the Iraqi Governmenti.to agree not to press for arrears of taxation and not in future to impose discriminatory taxation on the Sheikh. There is however, I imagine, the possibility that at some future date taxation on date gardens generally may increase in Iraq. There would then he no discrimination, hut the Sheikh would in fact have to pay more, and would to thefc extent not have been adequately compensated hy His Majesty’s Government. This, however, is a risk that must perhaps he taken.

You will already have seen the Political Resident s Express Letter of 31st January, No.60-8 of 1936, a copy of which was forwarded to the Foreign Office under India Office printed letter of 18th February, No.P.&gt;3. 114l/' 3 d, in which Colonel Fowle commented on Sir A.Clark Kerr s proposal. From a letter which I now enclose, you will ^ee tha rnmenlTof India letter of 22nd ) Government of India have no uary, No.F. 247-N/35. fur&gt;ther observations to offer, We agree generally with Fowle’s views, and it seems to us that the important question of the composition of the . Rendel Esq., C.M.G.* Foreign Office, S.W. 1* Commission/Commission may easily raise difficulties. But when you and the Treasury have considered Fowle's points in regard to which the Embassy may have more to say, we can, if the proposal is to be pursued, hold the departmental meeting foreshadowed in your letter under reference and discuss it in detail* 3. It seems to us, meanwhile, that the most urgent matter is to take the necessary action for a settlement of the question of the Sheikh’s compensation for the loss of his exemption from taxation and that the best method of approaching this question is the one suggested by Hale in his letter to you of 24th February 1936. We agree with him as to the desirability of separating the compensation question from the possession question and oi settling the former as soon as possible. If we could obtain assurances from the Iraq Government not to claim arrears of taxes from the Sheikh and not to impose discriminatory taxation upon him, and if we then proceed honour our financial obligations by refunding to the 3h the equivalent of what he has already paid in taxation and by making a lump sum payment as a financial dischaxge of promised/K4- promised exemption from taxation, we should at any rate have accomplished a good deal, and should have disposed of the most urgent aspect of the whole matter. We could then pursue with the Iraqi Government a settlement of the question of the Sheikhs possession, pending which we might he able to regard with comparative equanimity a continuance of the present status quo in regard to the possession aspiect, which, as Hale points out, is not so urgent so long as the Sheikh remains in de facto possession. 4. You may he proposing to call an interdepartmental meeting soon to consider Hale’s suggestions: if so we shall he glad to attend. Meanwhile we think it would he well to consult Powle, and if you see no objection I propose to telegraph to him personally on the lines of the enclosed draft. 5. When we come to discuss figures, we ought perhaps to take some account also of the case of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, who has been out of the picture lately. I it was suggested in Bagdad despatch No.390 of the 12tfl Ju^j 1934, that he should get half what the Sheikh of Koweit gets in the way of compensation. But the urgent matter seems to he/4: • 'be to settle the question of the Sheikh of Koweit’s compensation (as I suppose it is doubtful whether there are in any case practicable means of enabling the Sheikh of Mohammerah to enjoy the income of his property or the benefit of any compensation?). 6.

Dear Rendel, Thank you for your letter of the 13th February (E 327/18/93), on the subject of the Sheikh of Koweit’s date gardens. 2. Constitutionally, I think that any prooosal to settle the compensation question without awaiting a comprehensive settlement of the possession question should come to us from the Foreign Office, as the expenditure involved would be a charge on the Diplomatic and Consular Vote. This, however, need not prevent me from explaining why we think that the question of compensation should not await a comprehensive settlement of the possession question, or from making a suggestion as to how to go about the matter. 3. In his note of the 28th January, Humphrys told the Iraqi government that if they would give the Sheish a good title to the Faddaghiyah Gardens (less the Bushiyuh section; we would contribute up to *2,000 to expenses; and that provided that full effect was given to this arrangement, and provided G.W. Rendel, Esq., C.M.G. , Foreign Office.h provided further that the Iraqi Government would (a) claim no arrears from either Sheikh, and (b) give a written . assurance that no discriminatory taxation would be imposed on either Sheikh in future, we would raise no further claim for exemption. 4. *e have a very definite impression that, while the Iraqi Government may in practice be prepared to protect the Sheikhs in possession of their property, e.g. by putting spokes in the wheels of inconvenient litigants, they have not the slightest intention of taking any overt action that might be politically embarrassing to them. If therefore we are to wait for a comprehensive settlement, all open and above board, it looks as if we shall wait indefinitely. If it were possible to keep the Sheikh of Koweit waiting indefinitely for his money, we should have nothing to say; but assuming that sooner or later we shall have to pay him, whether the possession difficulty has been tidied up or not, we had better pay him sooner, for the reason mentioned in my letter of the 17th January.Uea s iipoijf therein i ihile -o prote pail iej' half :tioa U . opey: ,tely. faitiag ; to say; , pay tiiii up or ii oned ii' 5. Clearly we cannot pay him without getting from the Iraqis a formal assurance with regard to provisos (a) and (b) referred to above. We think, however, that the Iraqis might be willing to give assurances on these points, since to do so would not involve any overt action that might oe made the subject of criticism in Iraq. The suggestion we put forward is therefore that the Ambassador might again approach the Iraqi Government on the following lines. 6. Referring to the note of the 28th January, he might say that it is now evident that a final solution of the possession question cannot be looked ior at an early date. Since the Sheikhs remain in effective possession of their gardens, (apart from the aashiyah section; ana since we Know that we can rely on the promise made oy hints heisal and solemnly renewed by King (ihazi &gt; delay does ck. an practice involve any grave consequences so far as possession is concerned. On the other hand, settlement of the tsxatior question does not brook delay, as the Sheikhs are paying annually considerable sums In taxation from which they have been promised exemption. His Majesty’s Government are prepared* orepared to settle this question, but before doing so they must have formal assurances on points (a) and (b). If they can receive such assurances, they for their part will undertake to raise no further claim for exemption from taxation. (The actual drafting would of course need fuller consideration: I have not attempted to do more than indicate the line of argument). 7. As regards the form of compensation, we should be strongly in favour of settling the Sheikh of Koweit's claim once and for all by a lump sum payment, in return for which we should expect a formal discharge binding on his successors as well as upon himself. We do not find it easy to express an opinion as to the lowest amount that would be accepted in final settlement, and we should like to hear the views of those on the spot as to the figure to be offered in the first place. Ho doubt there will have to be bargaining. 8. I am sending a copy of this letter to Clauson st the India Office. Yours sincerely.GOVERNMENT of INDIA. Department. EXPRESS LETTER (AIR MAIL).

My dear Jack, As I imagined you would want an early answer to your Chancery letter (E 7138/82/93) of the 8 th January and to your despatch No.21 (E 73/18/93) of the 9th January about the Shaikh’s date gardens, I asked Drower to come and discuss the questions raised in them yesterday. I am afraid the information which he was able to give me was neither definite nor complete enough for incorporation in an official despatch. He has promised to write to Lloyd at once hut, as it will probably be some time before an answer comes and as even he may not be very helpful, I will give you in this letter such information as I can. 2. I will take taab rights first. It appears that when a date garden is planted the fellaheen who actually plant the trees acquire ipso facto the right to a s..ap portion of the land planted. Thia right can only be extinguished by a money payment. The right is. however, a right to the portion of the land in question and not to a certain sum of money, and a plaintiff who won a case o n the ground of taab rights would presumably become entitled to the land in respect of which he helu such Whether the Shaikh could be said to have been in c i e__ - possession in 1914 of any portion of land in xespcct . which someone else subsequently established taao ri 3 hta is a question which I do not feel competent to answer.'S' 3. As regards reclaimed land, Drower does not know how much there is or how many of the gardens are affected; hut he is almost certain that the Shaikh has not made the necessary parent to the Iraqi Government in respect of any part of it and that it is, therefore, all unregistered. I do not think there could he any question of rival claimants to reclaimed land unless in any particular instance the land joining 'ttiG i* 6 cls.i.nicd. lojiclj thong]! now in cl© jr&amp;cto possession 01 'the Shaikh., is itself daisied by somebody else* whether this is the situation with negard to any of the land claimed by the Shaikh I do not know. 4. I am afraid we are becoming increasingly doubtful here about the possibility of persuading the Iraqis to set up a commission with powers as wide as those suggested by Lloyd. But we do feel that the first step towards a solution is to discover (a) the extent of all the land claimed by the Shaikh, (b) the extent of those portions of such land whose ownership by the Shaikh is disputed by- anyone for any reason whatsoever, and (c) the exact reason for which the ownership of each portion of disputed land is in doubt. If the Shaikh cannot provide us with this information, the only means of discovering it would appear to be to set up a commission - even if it is only a commission of enquiry. 5. Drower is asking Lloyd to let him have any information of this kind which is available. However, 1 very much doubt whether he will be able to help much. Yours ever, (Signed) b.

Subject : Shaikh of Kuwait's date gardens ft»!; in IRAq&lt; &gt;ir, With reference to correspondence ending with India )ffice Express Letter Ho© P»Z© 9/36, dated the 10th January L936, I have the honour, after discussion with Colonel Jicfcaon, to submit the following views on despatch ho.629 ' 14/46/35) dated the 28th November 1935 from His Majesty's tobassador, Bagdad, to His Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs* 2. Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the despatch call for no comments • 5, With regard to paragraph 3. (i) Colonel Dickson reports that the Shaikh of Kuwait could register these accretions on the river banks provided the Iraq Sovernment puts no difficulty in the way doing so. The chief accretions are those made to the A1 ^ . nd A! pao estates (vide paragraphs Mutaaw'ah, A1 Faddaghiyeh and A1 Fa f \ I to Colonel Dickson s I (e), II (b) and IV (c) of Annexure of 24th November list, forwarded under my despatch © -t,.1934)* There are none that Colonel -Dickson knows of on tne land side* (ii) It seems to me that 'taab* rights are quite distinct from the question of securing the Shaikh a legally valid and unassailable title by the grant of a sanad in Tapu* Our responsibility begins and ends with placing the Shaikh in legal possession of his estates. Having done that he must settle his difficulties with his tenants like any other land owner. His Majesty’s Ambassador has mentioned that the Shaikh has made private settlements with many of the M taabin ,, on his i’addaghiyeh estate. Colonel Hickson is of opinion that the Shaikh could and would settle with the remainder* His difficulty in doing so hitherto has been due to the insecurity of His title, which has lead some of his 'taabin' to demand more than their rights* (iii) Colonel Hickson thinks, and X agree, that the danger of any of the Shaikh's family doing this is remote; it would be the business of the Shaikh to check any tendency in this direction* 4. With reference to paragraph 4 of the despatch. (a) The first part of this paragraph, regarding the • a Gmoivn*a title by his Haabin possibility of challenge to the ohai^h is dealt with in my paragraph 3 (ii) above. (b) As regards challenge to his title by members of his own family, as mentioned in my paragraph 3 (iii) above, this possibility is remote. Our object is to secure the Shaikh in the kind of ownership which he claimed in 1914. If hi® , £• _ 4“t*ust 1 , 2 * if some ownership was partly in the na ure ^ fvipn held by him on behall of the properties concerned were then nei.a -n +^c,n the Shaikh could not reasonably of the Sabah family, then the onai** in /in respect of these now claim the rights of a sole owner, nor, on the strength of His Majesty’s Government’s undertaking in 1914, claim compensation for loss of property belonging to individual members of the Sabah family by reason of action on their part. As mentioned in paragraph 3 (iii) above, it would be for the Shaikh, in his own interests and that of the whole Sabah family, to meet any danger of this nature. 5* With regard to the Commission proposed ty His Excellency The Ambassador in his paragraphs 5 and 6. Prima facie, the proposal has advantages but it would seem essential both from the point of view of His Majesty’s Government, and that of the Shaikh, that the Commission should be a mixed one; a purely Iraqi Commission would not, I imagine, be acceptable to the Shaikh, nor, probably, to His Majesty's Government. One Iraqi and one British official - say an officer with Settlement experience from India, who would represent the Shaikh and His Majesty's Government, might form a suitable personnel, choice of such an officer would be lesa likely to give rise to complaints from either party of bias than if the British representative were an official from Iraq or the Persian Gulf. It is possible, however, that the Iraq Government may object to a foreign official sitting on a Commission dealing with property within Iraq. On the other fact that the question is one involving the interests of His Majesty's Government and the independent Ruler . t v, e i r naving a representative furnishes a strong argument for their an the Commission# 6 , I am glad to note from the correspondence ending with India Office letter So. of 10th January 1936 to the /-4- ^ ^51 ' 9Q’ !ii| Sloifl j|j int „ ^SBSOgik BM ifi30(|OT, io ^nio? sij { &amp;M itaO ipsil , 10 a io iiis ip«l . oossbp ■0 3 !o 591^5 aisiSW!'! }s}jfW tl &amp; jsst* f i'a 3« Ill,s , jjji * !( ‘ ) t'p'if- sid5 ^ !! the Foreign Office that Hie Majesty’s Secretary of State for India agrees that it would be undesirable, despite the present proposal for a Commission, to defer consideration of the question of refunding to the Shaikh of Kuwait the amounts which he has been compelled to pay in taxes since 1932 I am sending copies of this despatch to the Government of India, His Majesty’s Ambassador, Bagdad, and the Political Agent, Kuwaito I have the honour to be.

When we consider the Ambassador’s proposal for dealing with the possession difficulty, we shall have also to consider how much longer we can defer compensation in respect of taxatioi If such compensation can be paid in a lump sum, which we should strongly favour, financial considerations point to an early settlement, since we shall presumably have to com pensate for taxation losses already sustained in addition to compounding for the future at I years' purchase, and X will not diminish through delay. Thus the longer we wait, the more it will probably cost. On looking at the question, however, one possible difficulty in the way of lump sum compensation occurs to us. We promised the late Sheikh that the gardens would remain in his possession and in possession of his descendants without erndale Bennett, Esq., o.m.G., oreign Office.without being subject to the payment of taxes or imposts. The present Sheikh, who I believe is third in succession from the Sheikh to whom the pledge was given, is regarded as having a right to compensation now that he has been taxed. The point that troubles us is whether, if we compound with him in perpetuity for a lump sum, he can give uo a good dis charge binding on his successors. tie should want to be sure that if he accepted, say, £ 10,000 in final settlement and then spent this money on himself, we should be in a position to turn a deal ear to his successor who would continue to suffer from the Istihlak tax without having derived any benefit from the £lu,oG0. There is also the contingency that the weight of taxation may rise. If there is any question as to whether the Sheikh can uo a good discharge on behalf of his successors, we shall have to consider whether the difficulty can be surmounted ^y some form of trust deed. This might not be easy, out an arrangement involving an annual vote lor «ver and ever seems impossible to contemplate. ThereThere has been a good deal of discussion of the form in which compensation is to be given - see especially Laithwaite*s letter of the &amp;lst October, 1933 to Helm - but I cannot trace that the particular point I have now raised has ever been considered. If it has not, the question will, we think, have to be put to the lawyers, and this alight as well oe done at once as nothing can very well happen now to affect their answer.

This seems a reasonable suggestion and we might proceed to ask Col. Fowle and Col. Dixon to give their views as the Foreign Office suggests. A drait Express Letter is attached. The proposal will, of course, need careful examination and there will be considerable delay before the proposed commission is set up. It therefore seems unnecessary to return to the charge and press the Foreign Office to consider new the suggestion contained in our letter P.Z. 8660/35 that H.M.G. should refund to the Sheik the taxes which he had already paid,without waiting for a decision on the other questions.

The Secretary of State is at first sight disposed to view favourably Sir Archibald Clark Kerr’s suggestion that efforts should be made to secure a comprehensive settlement of the difficulties which have arisen out of the undertakings given in 1914 to the two sheikhs in the name of His Majesty’s Government. Before investigating Sir Archibald Clark Keir s proposals further, however, he would be glad to receive the observations thereon of the Marquis of Zetland and of the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury. He presum it will be desirable in the first instance to invite Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Political Age at Koweit to offer their comments on the proposals.- 3.

No compensation has, however, been paid, because this question is linked up with the further question of establishing the validity of the Sheikh’s title to the date gardens in question. The negotiations with the Iraq Government on the latter subject have trailed on for three years, and we seem no nearer a settlement. Colonel Fowle has therefore suggested in his letter below that we should no longer wait for the conclusion of negotiations with the Iraq i Government but should agree to refund the Sheikh forthwiih for the sums which he has been paying in tax«j since 1932. The obligation to compensate the Sheikh is a : perpetual one, and various proposals for capitalising the sum were made in India Office letter No.P.Z. 6861 in the bound volume attached. A certain amount of inter departmental discussion will probably be necessary before I agreement is reached as to the exact form which the compensatory payment should take, so it is suggested that we should write to the Foreign Office and the Treasury proposing (l) the discussions might begin (2) that in the meantime the Sheikh might be refunded the amounts which he has paid in taxation from 1932 onwards.

POLITICAL AHD RET DEPT. INDIA OfFICE (l^ Department. Z 3 DEC1955 Sir, I am directed by the S. of S. for I. to refer to the correspondence regarding the losses suffered by the Sheikh of Koweit through the imposition of Istihlak Tax on the produce of his date gardens in Iraq, and in particular to the letter dated 7th November, 1935, from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, of which a copy was sent to the Foreign Office, numbered as above, on the 6th December. It should be explained that of the India Office letters mentioned by Col. Powle in para.5 of his letter,' the first (dated 13th April 1933) conveyed, for the confidential information of the Foreign Secretary to the G. of I. and of the Resident, the substance of the opinion of the Law Officers, and the second (dated 26th October 1933) forwarded a copy of Mr .Laithwaite's letter of the same date to hr.Helm. 2. The Marquess of Zetland agrees generally with the views expressed by the | Resident and in particular ffislk^onglyj for the reasons given by Col. Fowle, unless there is an inmediate prospect of reaching a settlement with the Iraq Government it is most desirable to ref Ad to the Sheikh the amounts whxch in spite of H.M.G.’s undertaking he has , been/ 3938 5000 7.35tt ■been compelled to pay in taxes since 19o2 It would further be desirable, in H.l.'s opinion, to continue for the future to refund annually the sums so paid until a final settlement is reached: but if there are par-feioulm 1 jjuI-l LxCcil diffici-il'tj.es involved in providing for annual payments he would not press the matter at this stage. 3. ~The refund to H.E. would of course he without prejudice to the final settlement of the case, and would/be a private transaction between and the Sheikh which would not affect in any way the negotiations between H.M.G. and the Iraq. Government. 4. Subject to the concurrence of who will no doubt desire to consult the Lords Commissioners % of the Treasury, Lord Zetland would jrk accordingly promo s e ho rinse the Resident ^to inform the Sheikh that, pending the conclusion of a satisfactory settlement with the Iraq Government, H.M.G. have decided - without prejudice to the terms of any settlement which may be reached between H.M.G. and the Iraq Government or between H.M.G. and the Sheikh - to refund the amounts paid by the Sheikh since 1932 in respect of taxation covered by the Undertaking of 1914. It snould, of course, be made clear to H.E. that H.M.G. will only refund payments which they consider to /vv?\\ 1^5 )raft Paper. Department. 'be covered by this undertaking, and that the claims submitted by him may need substantial modification in the light of detailed examination by H.M.G. 5. It will then be necessary to scrutinise the lists of claims which have been presented by the Sheikh and form respectively the enclosures to Bagdad despatch No.162 of 1934 and Bushire despatch No.697-S of 1935 (of which a copy was sent to the Foreign Office numbered P.Z.6585/35 on the 18th September). A number of the items are probably inadmissible, and as a first step H.L. would propose to obtain the viev/s of the Resident on the latter . of these lists. ^ 6.

His Excellency the Shaikh ox Kuwait raised the question or his Date Gardens in •Iraq,# His conversations in England have given him fresh hopes that His Majesty*s Government will do their best to implement their promise at an early date, and it is obviously most desirable that these hopes should not be disappointed. He has been waiting now with considerable patience for some five years for a settlement of this question. 2, The assurance given by His Majesty*s Government to the Shaikh in 1914 covered botn (a) security of title and (b) freedom from taxation# 3* (a) is dependent on the result of the negotiations which are being conducted with the •Iraq Government, and it is not possible to afford the Shaikh even partial relief until these are concluded* 4. THe position is different as regards (b). I belieri I am correct in saying that tbe possibility of implementing our assuranceassurance in regard to (b) apart from and prior to doing so in regard, to (a) nae not been considered before* I an of opinion that in view of the tine that has elapsed without our affording the Shaikh any relief action on these lines siiould be taken without delay* 5. It Has been Held (ride paragrapn 3 of India Office letter Ho*P*2 # lB9G A/53 9 dated 13tn April 1933) tnat a deiinite obligation rests on His Msgesty f s Cxorerniaem; to compensate tHe SHaikH in respect of ary imposition of the IstiHl&amp;k tax levied by tHe t IraQ Government on the date gardens covered by His Ma4©sty’s Government’s undertaking of 1914, and it is proposed eventually to compound with the Shaikh by the payment to him of a lump sum (or its proceeds annually) representing the capitalisation on the basis of the value of a perpetual exemption of tne present cost of the exemption (vide India Office letter ffo.P.£.6861/33, dated 26th October 1933)* In the meantime, the Shaikh has been paying taxes to tHe # Ira&lt;£ Government from tHe year 1932* I see no reason why His Majesty’s Government should not refund to the Shaikn the amounts paid by him in taxes from 1932 to the present year, and continue to do so annually until the question of compensation for payment of taxation is finally settled* The details of the exact sums to be pi id need not be gone into at present| this could be done when a decision in principle is reached* I should, be grateful for an early decision, as the effect of a statement to the Snaikh that His Majesty’s Garernment decided to refund him the sums He Had alreadyalready Paid by wey of taxation would strengthen Ms eonlidence in His Majesty*8 Government by affording nim practical prol^ of the intention of His Majesty*s Government to implement their undertaking to I em sending copies of this letter to the Govern*, ment cC India* Kie Majesty* a Am'oas sad or* Bagdad a&amp;d the Political Agent, Kuwait# I have the honour to be* Sir, Tour most obedient servant* Lieut#-Col on el* Political Resident in the Persian Gulf #political Department. .

No compensation has, however, been paid to the Sheikh because this question has up to now been treated in conjunction with the question of establishing the validity of the Sheikh’s title to his properties in Iraq. As the negotiations with the Iraq Government upon the latter subject have now proceeded for some years without reaching any settlement, and as the Sheikh has in the meantime been paying taxes, the Marquess of Zetland would suggest for the (to (1)) of the S/S fori'.A consideration of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury that the question of making a + -navment to the Sheikh should compensatory payment considered forthwith without awaiting thethe conclusion of the discussions with ~ the Iraq Government 3, Pending the decision the exact form which this compensatory payment should take, His Lordship would further suggest that H.M.G. should agree in principle to refund to the Sheikh the amounts paid by him in taxes from 1932 if cV i « V &gt;» up to the present time, and snouPd- / continue to do so annually. If his proposals are approved, His Lordship would then propose to examine in conjunction with the Secretary of state for Foreign Affairs and the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury the claims which have been presented by the Sheikh of Koweit in respect of the losses which he has suffered.^ A number of these J in //u Ofl n.e-c f~&lt;. ^ to ?7{ ifci U'&lt;&lt;*i %** t itXZr, •] ^ \(Jy “ry °J 'U /*’ ~ j j f To To uAt* 1.0 ^ r-Kr-U /t?W | n Jorm+JiA ( oj sr t ^ 3&lt;-«- (z TIky^ Ipi ft' !CZ it Jo l Rzi UA-?, Ittur .J ('tJjJU* claims are probably inadmissible, and as|^ A : 6?? - S .f r^rA T Ul»«\ a first step His Lordship would propose to obtain the views of the Political / loA \ V#, CONFIDENTIAL. c&gt; No.S34-3 of 1935.

DATS OARDENS OF TIB SIIEIKH OF KoiilT. I took the opportunity in a final interview with Nuri Paeha this morning to remind him of this question which I had already discussed with him on June ff (see x again 'begged him to do what he could to get it settled and emphasised the unfortunate effect of any continued failure to get it out of the way. 2. Nuri Pasha promised to take it up again and press it on his return to Bagdad. FOREIGN OFFICE, 1st July 1935.3655/82/93) 9J*t~ f C' 5 ) SHEIKH OF KOWKIT* R DA^ GABTO^TR to tt,,,. I raised this question with Huri Pasha this evening. I explained that it was causing a most unnecessary amount of trouble and difficulty to everyone concerned, and that we were really becoming rather worried about it. It was no good going back over the early history of the matter or the question of why the pledges had been given. The fact remained that there was a pledge, which we had to see implemented, that the late King Peisal had promised that the Sheikh’s title should he validated, and that Nuri himself had renewed this promise, when it had been agreed that the matter couldbe settled if His Majesty’s Government would pay £2,000. Could not Nuri Pasha do something to ensure that this tiresome question should now be got finally out of the way on the basis which had been agreed upon? 2. Nuri Pasha did not attempt to deny that these promises had been given, and said that just before he left Bag tad the matter had been discussed by the Council of Ministers. The difficulty then had been - according to him - to make the proposed validation square with the terms of existing legislation, and it had been necessary to consult Mr. Drower on this point. Further it had been suggested that an undertaking should be given that the Sheikh’s title would not be contested in future; this was impracticable, since no-one could prevent people challenging &amp; title, however legal it might be. 3. I replied that it seemed to me that two things were required. In the first place, the present action must be disposed of and got out of the way. Secondly, some act was required on the part of the Iraqi Government, either by legislation or by any other kind of administrative action which would put the Sheikh's title on an unassailable basis, i.e. finally/'im i finally dispose of any technical irregularities there might he in it at present. If this were done, it would he very difficult for anyone to challenge it, and it would not matter veiy much if they did. 4. After a long discussion, I again begged Nuri Pasha to write to Bagdad and urge an immediate settlement of this question. I said that I thought it was having a most unfortunate effect, and that it would help our relations in every way if it could he disposed of. Nun Pasha eventually agreed to write to Bagdad about it at once. (Signed) G.W.Rendel. V FOREIGN OFFICE. 11th June, 1935.to 661 / 82 / 93 *) Code telegram to Sir A.Clark Kerr (Bagdad).

C I Leg to report that His Excellency Syed Hamid Beg al ITaqih, Deputy for Basra in the Iraq Parliament (a person of distinguished family in Basra, and brother of the late Syed Talfb Pasha) visited Kuwait on the 22nd April, and left again on the 25th April. 2. He came straight from Bagdad and called on me on arrival, with Syed Abdur Rahman al Naqib, his cousin and one Yusuf al oalim a well-known resident of Basra. j. Though Syed Hamid Beg f s visit was, he assured, me, Quite of an informal nature, (he had only come down, he said, to see his sister who is married to the Shaikh f s son) he early on started, discussing the Shaikh’s Date Gardens question, and the Iraq Government’s smuggling accusations against Kuwait* 4* As Syed Hamid is a very influential deputy in the Iraq Parliament, and as his opinions count for something in Bagdad, I think it worth while reporting the gist of what he said, as it shows that there is a good deal of informative and influential opinion in Iraq, which sees the Shaikh of Kuwait’s point of view and is out for just and conciliatory methods. 5* As regards the da t e p;a rd ens , Syed Hamid’s views vere K as follows (a) He deplored the way in which the Iraq Government had deliberately gone out to persecute the Shaikh during the last four years, and considered such methods the worst ^ y Dorm of diplomatic tactics that his country could have undertaken — Kuwait, he said, was Iraq s near and gooa neighbour and was ruled by a high spirited and proud ...rah ancient lineage, and his country Iraq ought to have known better than ”to drive a spear into Shaikh Ahmad’s heart”2 . (his words), dia so deeply wound him as to make it almost impossible to recover lost ground or ever discuss any minor disputes which arose, in friendly manner again. (h) Iraq/ s whole quarrel was really with His Majesty's Government and not with Kuwait, and she ought, instead of attempting to take the law into her own hands, and force date garden revenue out of the Shaikh, to have hel^ ner hand where Kuwait was concerned and carried the warfare to London. Kuwait's good-will and friendship she should have cultivated from the first. Her obvious line was,to have given an ultimatum to His Majesty's Government i}. years ago and warn her that if within say a definite period of time, she (His Majesty's Government) did not pay Kuwait's garden taxes herself and incidentally honour her pledges to Kuwait by so doing, she (Iraq) would most reluctantly have to take steps to recover same direct. This course, said Syed Hamid Beg, would at any rate not have made an 'enemy' of the Shaikh of Kuwait. (c) Clearly, continued Syed Hamid Beg, the Shaikh had been deeply wounded by Iraq's stupid and bullying action, and the smuggling question had been rendered ten times more difficult of settlement in consequence, for to use a slang expression 'the Shaikh was justifiably trying to get his own back'.CONFIDENTIAL.

My object in v/riting now is merely to confirm what I said over the telephone; namely that, although I agree that we want to get the whole of this question liquidated as quickly as possible, I think it would be better, in view of the action now being taken at Bagdad, to await its results. If Humphrys is successful in settling the question of title, such settlement should be reached within the next fortnight, and the question of compensation can then at once be tackled. In that case there will be no real delay. If, on the other hand, Humphrys' efforts should fail, we should have to concentrate anew on the title question, and that/ A*D MfatL qpw thwaite, Esq., C.I.E.

You will remember that the original plan was that the sum of i,s,000 should he paid by H.lw.G. in return tor; (a) validation of the Sheikhs 1 titles to ail the gardens covered by the 1914 pleage; (b) cancellation of arrears; (c) a guarantee that no discriminatory tax would be imposed in future. Suoject to the giving of the necessary undertakings by the Iraq Government, H.M.G. would be prepared to compensate both Sheikhs in respect of their losses through taxation in the future. This offer was embodied in Mr. Ggilvie Forbes* letter of SSnd August 1934 to the Iraq Foreign Minister, P.z.195/35. In December 1934 sir F. Humphrys suggested that it would be most difficult to secure a blanket guarantee from the Iraq Government in respect of the legal title to all the properties;&amp;that the only property in the title/a ' title to whidi there seemed to 'be any serious flaw was Faddaghiyeh, adrt recommended in these circumstances that the Iraq Government should be asked in addition to conditions (h) and (c) above to validate the 3heiKh*s title to Faddaghiyeh only in return ±or the payment of £3,000. This was approved by H.M.G. in Foreign Office telegram of 15th January at P• Z#=345/35, on the understanding that all possible efforts would be made to persuade the Iraq Government to give a blanket guarantee and subject to the reservation that the Ambassador should, before the deal was completed, 'place it on record in writing that as regards the other four gardens H.M.G. on their part hold that they are. covered by the guarantee given to the Sheikh of Koweit in 1914; that the obligations of this guarantee passed to the Iraq Government, and that consequently if the Sheikh should be aispossessed H.M.G. would make a claim on the Iraq Government in respect of such dispossession'. The Ambassador now reports that he has discussed the matter; that there is no prospect of securing a blanket guarantee; but that/m — - 3 - that the Iraq Governnient are prepared to give a good title to Fadaaghiyeh, and to comply with conditions (h) and (c) in paragraph 1 above in return tor the payment of £2000. sir F. Humphrys wishes to postpone the written communication regarding our view of the Iraqi obligations in respect of tne other four properties until negotiations are farther advanced. The Embassy in a d.o. letter tO' the Foreign Office have, however, urged that it would be preferable to abandon any reference to the 1914 promise, which will carry no weight with the Iraqis and may impede a general settlement. 3. The general question is to some extent one of tactics, but the attitude to be adopted as regards a reiteration of the 1914 pledge is one of much importance. Mr. Beckett advises that we cannot afford altogether to abandon our argument that this pledge has been transferred to the Iraq Government. But a ^ an , phrase has been worked out fin consultation with him which it is thought will sufficiently safeguard the position.;m 'Z - 4 - 4.

We here are inclined to think that the question of the exact wording of the communication is largely one of tactics as regards which the Embassy are best qualified to judge.

The point which you raise is largely one of tactics and as regards these you are more competent to judge than we are here. What we want in the case of the four gardens, i.e. excluding Faddaghiyeh, is to bring it home to the Iraqis that any interference with the Sheikh will involve them in claims from us which «we shall press upon them, and consequently that it is to their interest to be as helpful as they can to the Sheikh in this matter, and not, as they have recently been f deliberately obstructive and hostile to him. If, as a result of a judgment of an Iraqi court, the Sheikh were disturbed in the enjoyment of a property to which he has a good legal technical title, thethe judgment would he a denial of justice and we could make our claim independently of the transfer to the Iraqi Government of the 1914 pledge. If, however, some other technical flaw in the Sheikh’s legal title were found, (a development which appears from all our iniorma- tion to he unlikely), we should not base our claim against the Iraqi Government on a denial of justice hut would he compelled to rely on the 1914 pledge for what it might he worth. Although none of us expects that the Iraqi Government can he brought to admit the binding force of the pledge upon them, and although it is quite likely that if a case were to arise in the future, we should prefer, as we have done as regards Faddaghiyeh, even to pay some money ourselves if this would enable us to settle the matter in co-operation with the Iraqi Government, rather than have recourse to the Permanent Court, nevertheless the 1914 pledge is something of a&amp;. Possibly the immediate purpose would be served quite well if the final written communication to the Iraqi Government were to run more or less on the lines which you pro pose, hut we think that, in view of what I have said above, it would be well to insert a few words which, without mentioning the 1914 pledge in terras, would afterwards enable us to contend that it was clear that we had kept our original view about the 1914 pledge alive. This could be done if the last sentence of pur suggested communication were worded some what as follov/s: n For reasons which have many times been ,f explained to the Iraqi Government, oouh ’brally and in writing, we should hold the H Iraqi Government responsible if these 'were assailed and claim accordingly .

S8th January, 1935 My dear Minister At our meeting on January 24th Your Excellency was good enough to discuss with me tne arrangements which have been under consideration for some time for the settlement of the difficulties which have arisen in regard to the title of the Shaikh of Kuwait to the property known as the Faddaghiyah Gardens. I explained to Your Excellency that, on the understanding that the Iraqi Government would ensure that the Shaikh of Kuwait was given a legally valid and unassailable title to this property (except that portion of the Bashiyah section of it which has al ready been alienated from the Shaikh by a Court judgment), His Majesty’s Government would contribute a sum not exceeding £2,0 towards the expenses which might be incurred in carrying out the necessary transactions. I further explained to Your Excellency that provided full effect was given to the arrangement set out above and on the fur ther understanding that the Iraqi Government would:- (a) undertake to make no claim for arrears of taxation against the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Muharmiterah in respect of their properties in Iraq; (b) give me a written assurance that no discriminatory taxation would be imposed on the properties of either of these Shaikhs in future, Mis Majesty's Government would raise no further claim for Lae exemp tion from taxation of the properties which these two Shaikhs own in I excellency Jamal Beg Baban, Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs BAGDAD.I shall ue glad if Your Excellency will be so good as to give early consideration to the above proposals and will inform me as soon as possible whether they are acceptable to the Iraqi Govermaent.

You will see that while the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs his been told orally that we regard the obligations arising from the 1914 promise as devolving upon the Iraqi Government, we know perfectly well that they will never adrait it. Now the point is this. !e are reasonably sure that once the Faddaghiyah case is out of the way and we have a valid sanad covering that property, the titles of the Shaikh to all his properties will be fairly sound. vLet us leave aside the question of possible encroachments beiore or after 1914. They do not really affect the main question).

His Majesty's Government's pledge of 1914 categorically guaranteed that the estates which were then in the.

The fact therefore that now in the ini onopinion of the 'Iraq Government the Shaikh's title to some of these estates is not valid (by reason inter alia of encroachments made before 1914) in no way lessens His Majesty^ Government's liability to compensate him in full for loss of the whole or any part of such estates* Encroachments, if any, made after 1914, are of course in a different category* Sgd* T*C*FOWLS, Lieut-Colonel, lolitical Resident in the Persian Gulf* ATTESTED* &gt;r Secretary cretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf*In any further communication on this subject, please quote and address —not to any person by name, but to— “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. 1 /I 9R I ,o - ! iAy h wt****# * v ^y THE Under-Secretary of State fot„ Foreign Affair^ presents his compliments to ^ \X4oU , Kj, and, by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith cop\s» of the under-mentioned paper.

This is fairly satisfactory as the Sheikh will not now be able to dig up any further properties to be classified as exempt. Por some time we entertained doubts about the fifth property - the Ujairawiyah - but the position is now clear. What has happened is that this garden was given by the Sheikh, to whom the 1914 promise was made, to his daughter on her marriage and is now held by her family. This family can probably be fairly considered as descendants within the meaning of the 1914 promise, but we are not prepared, on the basis of present information, to go as far as Dickoon in maintaining that the property will always be exempt no matter who holds it. For instance it would be difficult to hold that the property should retain its exempt status were sold to someone not in the Sheikh s family. The Iraqi Government appear to have regarded this garden as being exempt and, in common with other exempted properties, have not levied taxes on it in the past. Nor has the Sheikh included any figures relating to produce from Ujairawiyah in his statement of losses incurred by reason of the/ Department, or eign Office.the introduction of Ishtihlak tax This is mainly of ecaciGiiiis intorost of course and we are taking no further action till we get a reply to our despatch No. 712.

Following is for your information with reference to paragraph 6 of your despatch No. 712 (of December 16th). As regards boundary disputes, His Majesty’s Government would not consider guarantee as covering areas over which the Sheikh had no possession at dato of pledge, and therefore pledge would not cover encroachments since 1914 0 Question of encroachments prior to 1914 is perhaps academic since by now Sheikh must have had possession for over twenty years and may have acquired prescriptive title under Iraqi law. I agree generally with views expressed in paragraph 6 of your telegram subject to the qualification that, if Sheikh lost a boundary dispute under a judicial decision, His Majesty’s Government would certainly be faced with a claim on the part of the Sheikh and might have to admit the claim if area in question was possessed in 1914 and certainly would have to do so if decision was contrary to equity. Conse quently it is important that everything possiole should oe done to prevent such a decision being given.

Paragraph 5. Sheikh's title to property No.l seems to be absolutely secure, and to properties 3 and 4 reasonably so. Strength of title as regards property No.5 depends on date and nature of Tapu deeds regarding which India Office are making telegraphic enquiries of Political Resident. 2. In these circumstances risk of successful attempt to dispossess Sheikh of these properties seeing comparative ly slight, and it would be most satisfactory i- yon could therefore persuade Iraqi Government to entenu tueii &amp; uaran tee to cover all five properties. In doing so you will no doubt so far as you can witnout disclosing, confidential particulars, make all possible play with strength of Sheikh's titles and you will appreciate importance of Point so far as His Majesty's Government are concerned since if titles to these gardens were to oe^ challenged, they would be bound to support Shell* in s£me way as they have had to do over Faddaghiyeh.3. 3 o if however you co.asicier it quite impracticable to obtain such a general guarantee, you may fall back on course of action suggested in paragraph 10, includ ing of course arrangement that, in respect of all gardens, Iraqi Government should abandon their claim to arrears of tax, and undertake to impose no discrimina ting tax on the Sheikhs in future. In that event you should, before deal is completed, place it on record In writing that as regards the other four gardens His Majesty's Government for their part hold that they are covered by the guarantee given to the Sheikh Oi t-.omit in 1914, that the obligations under this ginnanuee have passedfthe Iraqi Government, and that consequently if the Sheikh should be dispossessed His Majesty s ment would make a claim on the Iraqi Government in respect of such dispossession* ' Addressed to Bagdad No. 15, repeated to India No* 6 and Bush ire No* 2*you will appreciate iiaportanee of point so far as His Majesty*s Government are concerned since t . if title.', to these gardens challenged. ^ nil I they would he hound to support Sheikh in scpe L'btr way as they wwfc# have ^rdo over Fiiddaghiyeh.

As you will see from the correspondence quoted tZ in the letter to the Foreign Office of which a copy is attached, the point came up for consideration in 1929, when we agreed with the Colonial Office (the Foreign Office not dissenting) that the pledge must be regarded as personal to the Sheikhs and their successors and #iot attach to the property and so pass with the property on sale or transfer. It was also agreed that 'descendants' covered a more limited class than 'successors' would have done, and might be regarded as ) indicating only the actual heirs of the Sheikh*s body, to y'''i the exclusion of collateral successors. 3. From papers just received it appears that one of the gardens covered by the pledge of 1914 was given by the then Ruling sheikh fto HTs daughter, on marriage. The lady in question appears to have died 10 years ago and under the Islamic laws of inheritance one nail of her own property went to her husband, who died last year, and the other half reverted hack again to the children and grandchildren of Sheikh iwuoarak, th^ Ruler of Koweit to whom the pledge was given in 1914 (See Koweit despatch ■G.302 of 18th November 1934). The Foreign Office have asked us to consider whether, the fact that the garden .\'J ij In question passed from sdeito ilutarak; to ills daughter, &lt;7VA. L+**a_JL fc Ka j OA-to-Xy. and that consequent on her death fthe present RulEg - Sheikh and various other memhers of the Koweit family ' t4*~- HA»v&lt; l« vUW-f ^ iiave acquired an interest in ^portion o£ it under the Islamic laws of inheritance, has any hearing on its continued exemption from taxation under the pledge given hy H.M.G. in 1914, and I shall he grateful for your advice on this* 4. The pledge was to the then sheikh and his descendants. Gn that basis, the daughter to whom he gave the garden was entitled as a descendant. In so far as on her death the garden reverted hy the Islamic law of inheritance to other lineal direct descentants (presumably however remote) of sheikh Mubarak, it remained entitled to exemption as being a property covered by the original pledge which had never passed out of tne control of individuals entitled qua direct descendants of sheikh Mubarak under that pledge. 5 # Would you agree that this is the case and are you of opinion that there is any point^given the quite general wording of the pledge, at which/right of exemption can become exhausted? (It is, of course, obvious that after a considerable lapse of time portions of the estates covered by the 1914 pledge may oe divided among a very large number of descendants of Sheikh Mubarak, some of whom will hold only ^very tiny fragments of land] 6. on the other handTXs the property ^covered by the 1914 pledge may be orjnave been alienated by t (Sheikh MuMrak or subsequently by f ^yhescenciants of atieikh Mubarak enjoying a right In the property to an inaiviuual who was not a descendant of Sheikh Mubarak, it is presumably/ K■'i - 3 - I f o i i presumably the case that the exemption ceases? yfould you agree further that, the right of exemption having * once ceased consequent on the transfer of a portion of the property covered by the 1914 pledge to a person who is not a descendant of sheikh Mubarak:, such portion cannot again ' become entitled to exemption merely because it is repurchased or comes by inheritance into the possession of a person who is himself a descendant of sbeikh Mubarak?m 4 A l r L &lt;M. _£&gt; imi %/tt Gb* 9 •tllXisJIALL, J0 i2&gt; v January 1935.

We will look into this again. For the moment I send this interim reply only to put on recoru certain discussions which took place in 1929 and which have a bearing on the point. 3 * B 10 wording of the guarantee (I quote from the text sent to the Law Officers with tae case referred to them by us in march 1933) was: 'Your gardens which y-re now in your possession, viz. toe date gardens COPY SENT BY ..i.i MAH. welti, iisq., c.a.a.. ^9reign office, , ... _ ■ * • Ft 11 situate between Pao and jirnab, shall reiiain In your possesBlon and in tiie possession of your aeaeenaants without being subject to the payment of taxes or iiaposts. .w ,, 4* air GilDtrfc ton, in his despatch secret B of 8th Jui^ 1929 to the Foreign Office, enquireh whether the exeBiption granted under the pledge was 'to be considered personal, or would it pass with the property on sale or transfer?

In a letter of 11th October 1929, ho.68214/29. to the foreign office, the Colonial Office reuarked: 'Lord mssfield is not aware uhetner any particular Blgnlficance need attach to tie use of the word 'descendants'* instead of the wors usual tern* 'successor, Cm a strict interpretation tne undertaking biven would seem to toind H.k.Q. in the event of a change of dynasty in Kovveit not only to sacure for the Cheiicn and his descendants immunity from taxation in respect of the date gardens in Iraq, but also to preserve umt property in their undisturbed possession'.

This information was requested to enable an examination to be made of the validity of the Shaikh T s title to his Iraqi properties, in the circumstances described in India Office telegram No. 2294 of 26tn September last, and arising out of Mr. Ogilvies-Porbes 1 Savingram no. 29 of 5th September last. 3. It is to be regretted that the Shaikh ol kuna it has so far declined to commit himself to a written Hot of hio properties, a reluctance which is encountered in on^ -^orm another in connexion with most of the difficult kuwaiti questions with which His Majesty’s Embassy ^s concerned, the x-kirpose of considering 'the questions generally how , tiie detailed and valuable summaries provided by Colonel Dioison appear to be adequate, as tiiey r “ ore 01 - L - S ‘ J and amplify tde information already in our possession, it is to be doped tbat tde political Besident will oe aoie to ^ i vh for whicn he obtain tne written concurrence of tne -uain j has = Right Honourable John Simon, G.G.o* 1*, H.C.V.o.,lias called, in the accuracy of the lists, so as to leave no room fox the .ohaimn to claim subsequently tnst properties not included therein are 'exempted properties'. 4. It vas Mr. Ggilvie-Porbes 1 intention, as expressed in paragraph 6 of his Javingram of October £4th, to transmit this list to the Iraqi Government for authentication, but as the ohaihh has been given a promise to the effect that no steps will be tanen to communicate particulars to the Iraqi Government without his consent, the only purpose which the list can serve at present is to enable His majesty’s Government in the United Hingdom to form an opinion as to whether the Shaikh has a reasonably good title to his properties (other than to the Faddaghiyah Estate, his title to which has already been impugned). The lists have been examined in His majesty’s Embassy with this object in view. 5. Put very briefly the position appears to be that the Shaikh owns the following five properties, which are in his possession by virtue of the documents noted against tneir names 1. Mutaawaih • - Tapu Deeds, hf ^ . a. Haddaghiyah - Tapu Deeds issued in 1915, the validity ^ of which has been called in question. 3. Harhaniyah - Deed of purchase (60 years possession). 4. Hao Peed of Gift (1GG years possession). 5. Ujairawiyah - Tapu heeds. •’ 6 . Mr. Alexander in his note, &lt; a copy of which accompanied Mr. Ggilvie-Porbes 1 despatch of the 6th September, No. 530, suggested that difficulties would arise over the boundaries of the properties and over encroachments. The notes supplied b ? Colonel • /^u-p'F'imili'ies of this nature Dichson show that minor difficulties oi /mayJ may aasily q.Txbq ana ’tna’t it is iinpossibls fox* any guarantee to be given that the Shaiah has a clear title to all the properties which were in his possession in Iraq in 1914, even if it can be definitely established what the then boundaries of those properties were. 1 suggest that possible disputes over boundary alignments and encroachments are matters of detail for which His majesty's Government should assume no responsibility. They are matters with which the Shaikh himself must deal. They should be capable of local adjustment by the Shaikh or his agent if and when they arise. His Majesty's Government can hardly be expected to guarantee that the Shaikh will not be called upon to pay for land on which he had illegally, or without authority, encroached either before or after 1914, or to insist upon the integrity of boundaries which the Shaikh himself cannot or will not prove. 1 suggest that the important question now outstanding is whether the Shaikh has in general a sufficiently good title to the properties to protect him from a risk of dispossession similar to that whicn hangs over the laddaghiyah Estate. 7. In my view, the information now availaole shows that in addition to having had undisputed possession iox l 0 xx o periods, he has documents which give him reasonable sufficient to safeguard his possession untxl tsm opeiations of land settlement extend to Basrah, when his ownership, and the boundaries of his properties, can oe permanently confirmed and authenticated. 8. It is most unlikely that the Iraqi dovernment will agree to guarantee the Shaikh’s title to all hi^ proper in Iraq. They are in fact not in a position to do so until the processes of land settlement have seen applied to tnose areas.7»» areas, la ^7 opinion, any attempt to link sueii a guarantee to tlie single OaUi Gompars.ti’vely straigntforward, problem of compensating tine plaintiffs in trie Faddagliiyali case, will only result in postponing indefinitely tiie settlement of tlie latter. 9. It is, 1 suggest, of great importance tkat tire Faddaghiyah problem snail be settled now. Tire difficulties arising out of tine attempts to keep the. case out of Court will, as has been pointed out in bn*. Ogilvie-Forbes ? despatch of 27th October, 1934, ho. 630, regarding the Fao land cases, ri|||||1| ||1|ri| | r ,. |i-fi.niunj.ii inii-rjiiiyt-n increase with tine, and add to the difficulties both of the Shaikh and of His majesty 7 s Government. Sven if the settlement of the Faddaghiyah case itself leaves the other properties open to successful attack, (and from the information now on record this seems to be unlikely), it will at least have removed a focal point of difficulty and embarrassment. The sum of £2,000 is comparatively a small araount to pay for removing these difficulties and securing an impregnable title to the estate. 10. 1 strongly recommend that, in view of the above considerations, I should be authorised to re-open negotiations immediately with the Iraqi Government for the settlement of the problem of the date gardens of both the Shaikh of suwait and the Shaikh of Muhammerah on the conditions approved in your telegram Ho. 160 of 29th August, except t^o the Iraqi Government should be asked to do no more in respect tne properties of the Shaikh of huwait than to validate his title to the whole of the Faddaghiyah Estate (less that portion of the Bashiyah strip of it which has already been alienate ) 11. I would re-iterate that it will not be possible indefinitely to keep the Faddaghiyah cases out of Court and j ^1that there is a grave rish that further delay in accepting the offered co-operation of the Iraqi Government will result in the whole arrangement falling through, n copy oi this despatch to the Honourable the political Resident in the Persian Gulf, 1 have, etc., ) f3igned} R.H.

Dear Walton, This is in reply to your letter of the 25th September (P.Z. 5818/34) enclosing a copy of a draft telegram to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf on the subject of the date gardens of the Sheikh of Koweit. As regards paragraph 3 of the telegram, our feeling is that if we are to ensure the Sheikh possession of the properties covered by the 1914 promise we shall have to give the Iraqi Government an exact list of these properties, together with evidence of title. Ogilvie Forbes asks for this information for transmission to the Iraqi Government in his telegram of the 5th September, No. 29. Further, the fact should not be lost sight of that the responsibility for securing m:o. pol D£Pt l 2 8 SEP 1934 INDIA OF ■&lt;- ffii securing possession to the Sheikh is, in our view, primarily a liability of the Iraqi Government rather than of the British Government. In these circumstances we feel a little doubtful about your instruction to the Political Resident to explain to the Sheikh that the particulars asked for are desired for the information of H.M. G., and would not be divulged to the Iraqi Government without the Sheikh’s consent. &lt; On the other hand, you probably feel that the Sheikh, who is ignorant of the proposed £2,000 deal with Iraq and will be fearful of giving information which might help the people who are disputing his title, must be reassured as to the immediate use to be made of the information. Would you object to the paragraph being re-written somewhat as foliows:- ”You may, if necessary,^explain to the Sheikh that these particulars are desired for the information of H.M.G. and that except in the case of Paddagiyeh, wherer vie* nt circ ction to tii that nfomti ra^i 1 that tis 300 heal lit ion ihielil a communication will clearly be necessary if the Government are to validate the Sheikh's title, no steps would be taken to communicate particulars of title to the .Iraq Government without his consent. «Ve sh.ou.ld also be inclined to put the latter part o! paragraph 4 of the draft telegram, beginning with the words n and h*M.G. might”, more strongly. Our agreement to the proposed £2,000 deal with Iraq has always been on the understanding that this would settle the whole possession question once and for all. Could we say something to the effect that 'You will realise that if the information ashed for in paragraph 2 should cast doubt on the Sheikh’s title to his other gardens, K.M.G. may find it necessary to reconsider de novo the proposed arrangements with the Iraqi Government.” We also suggest one small amendment in paragraph 2, namely, the omission of the word ft four M before ’’estates” in line 7, Finally, could we emphasise the question of urgency in the telegram? We do not want the £2,000 dealP.Z. 5818/34. Draft Paper. ?• political Department. (l) A.K.Helm ,Esq . , Foreign Office.

Could you let me know whether the 1) Foreign Office 2) Treasury iRW C. WALTQis. concur in the draft'.Mr .Walt on, Please see the Bagdad Saving telegram of 5th September below about the date gardens sent in reply to the Foreign Office telegram of 29th August at P.Z. 5604/34. As explained in Mr.Ogilvie Forbes’ telegram, it has not yet been possible to clinch the bargain with the Iraqis and it seems unlikely that we shall be able to do this until we have obtained from the Sheikh a complete list of the gardens covered by the 1914 pledge supported in each case by satisfactory evidence of the Sheikh’s title. The Iraqis will apparently refuse to validate the Sheikh’s title to the Faddaghiyeh Estate (less Jashiyeh) unless they are satisfied that the Sheikh has a right to the whole property by virtue of purchase or otherwise. Similarly the Treasury will presumably not be able to accept the Iraqi offer to validate the Sheikh’s title to Faddaghiyeh until they are reasonably certain that he has a sound title to the other gardens covered by the 1914 pledge. It seems almost certain from Mr .Laithwaite’s recent correspondence with Colonel Dickson that all the gardens in question are included in the four estates enumerated in paragraph 3 of Bagdad telegram No.192 of 16th August (P.Z.5336). The suggestion in the latest Bagdad telegram that the Sheikh has encroached beyond the original boundar of his properties is disturbing, and if this is the case he will, no doubt, be extremely suspicious on receiving a request for an exact list of his gardens supported by On the other hand there appears to be no necessity/ title deeds.necessity to give the Iraqi Government the documents relating to uhe SheiKn’s estates other than F&amp;ddaghiyeh, if this is likely to cause him embarrassment by leading to further disputes about his title to these estates. After conversation with Mr.Helm of the Foreign Office I have drafted a telegram to the Resident for Foreign Office and Treasury concurrence which is, I think, self-explanatory. Perhaps it might be as well to get the views of Colonel Fowle or Colonel Dickson on the Sheikh's probable reaction to a request for a complete list of the gardens involved before the telegram is actually sent. ? sign draft d.o. letters to Foreign Office and Treasury, urn#? //e^vK tU: A l -A L-X** ct -tf P 7~ any further communication on this subject, please quote j » No 1 address —not to any 'he ander-Secretary L 1334 THE Under-Seeretary of S'Catg'for-ftjrei ! compliments to transmits herewith cop Affairs presents his and, by direction of the Secretary of State, of the under-mentioned paper.

With regard to the second assumption namely, that his titles to gardens in areas one, two and four are sound, Judge Alexander states that the Shmkh has indulged in a practice common to property owners by encroaching beyond the original boundaries, an act which might be legalised by the payment of a certain sum. For certain reasons this sum has not been paid with the result that the Sanads held by the Sheikh will not include the areas on which he had encroached by 1914 nor the areas encroached on since 1914 which may do claimed as part of the original gardens. There may also be boundary disputes with neighbours of which we are not aware. Neither Tapu nor the Ministry of Finance « e o2. Finance have a complete list of the She\kh T s properties^ 4c I therefore suggest that the Shaikh of Koweit te called upon to furnish a list of the gardens covered ty the 1914 pledge by names and not hy districts, giving the reference s to the Tapu registers or supplying guaranteed copies of the Sanads. I think this is a reasonable requirement as in the evident confusion from which many of the Sheikh’s titles are derived the Iraqi Government decline to give a blanket validation to any properties which the Sheikh might claim as falling under the 1914 pledge. 5. Judge Alexander warned me that in spite of ray reference to all comers, the 'Iraqi Government might make an attempt to limit the transaction to Abdullah Zuhair. .Against this I am on my guard. He also added that in his opinion we should not-only obtain valiaa^ tion but also a promise of compensation for the Sheikh in case of dispossession after validation. This I do not consider possible or advisable and it is beyond the scope of the conditions laid down oy His . Majesty’s Government. 6. Since the above was written the Prime Minister who as the King’s Private Secretary has taken a leadin 0 part in these negotiations, has called on me and emphasised the difficulties in the way of validao' g properties the existence or legality of which might not /! t&gt;e known to the .'Iraqi Government, ^pwould te glad to receive s the date gardens intended Government e the ex 1 act ',U-| t T , 1 °p r] o. e together with satis- Jo be covered by the 1914 Plff® J°^e clear to the I factory evidence oi ^ ^ o rvi it ion can be allowed.

Sir, I am in receipt of your communication Ho.202/5/34 dated 24th February 1934 regarding this iatihlak tax paid on the dates belonging to His Excellency Shaikh Sir Khaaaal Khan during 1932 and 1933. I would beg to point out, at the outset, that it is almost impossible to produce the receipts for the istihlak tax paid on all the dates referred to, because of the following reasons (1) Before the istihlak was introduced, the fellahs used to supply the Shaikh with §0% of the produce; but with the introduction of the istihlak tax, the fellahs supplied him with 56^ only, the difference being allowed to them to enable them to pay the istihlak tax on their share. Tbe fellahs have not taken out receipts for their shares and it is not possible for them to obtain these. They must have ©old their dates to various parties, who have paid the istihlak tax thereon, and it is certain, in my humble opinion, that they cannot trace the istihlak receipts for the quantities sold by them. I am, however, in possession of the agreements made with the fellahe on different properties showing the fact that they have been allowed 4% in excess of their previous shares to enable them to pay the istihlak tax. (2) Some of the dates belonging to the Shaikh have been sold to different merchants at Basrah and these merchants have themselves paid the istihlak tax to the Government when they exported those dates from Basrah together with other dates bought by them from other parties. 1 only method in which we can prore the fact is to obtain a certificate from each buyer showing th ® by him, and the date and number of the customs receipt or declaration that he has paid the tax on the &amp; ^es. ! ehJu bTglad to be informed ae to whether X s^uld take the necessary aotion to obtain such certificates.

There seems nothing for it but to exclude Bashiyeh from arrangement with Iraqi Government. On assumption that only properties covered by 1914 pledge are those embodied in paragraph 5 of your telegram and that you are satisfied that titles in respect of Nos. 1, 2 and 4 are watertight, you are authorised to settle matter on basis suggested in paragraphs 4 and 5. Addressed to Bagdad lio« 160, repeated to India No*35 and Bus hi re No c 33.W (M 1 Mr. Walton, Sir L. Kerslaa\ &amp; £ Kowelt Date Gariiens. Please see previous submission on P.z.5009/34 below and Mr. Ogilvie-Forbes' telegram of 16th AUgustc/znH It appears ttet there is no hope of including the Bashiyeh garden in the scope of the arrangement now conterrplated with the Iraqi Government, hut that in return for a payment of £2,000 there is every prospect of securing satisfactory guarantees in respect of the balance of the Faddaghiyeh garden. 2. Hie question of the action to he taken was considered at an interdepartmental discussion with the Foreign Office this afternoon, at which Mr. Stafford of the Baghdad Embassy was present, and the Treasury were also represented. It was generally felt that, regrettable as it was that it should not he possible to cover Bashiyeh under the arrangement now contemplated, it would he definitely better to take what was offered and secure the position of the much more valuable Faddaghiyeh garden rather than risk a breakdown over the question of Bashiyeh. Mr. Stafford mentioned that the sheikh, if he were dispossessed of Bashiyeh, could take action against the successful claimants for the return of the purchase money originally paid by him (apparently £4,400, not £3,500, as suggested by Colonel Dickson in a recent letter) and that there was likely to be considerable delay in any event in effecting the dispossession of the sheikh. 3. After further discussion the Treasury agreed to accept the liability for the whole sum of £ 2,000 ana made no request that India should contribute. This is satisfactory, for while we have consistently refused to pay, the/the Treasury have equally consistently in the past pressed their claim that we should contribute. The Treasury representative in the second place appeared to accept that H.M.G. would also he liable for compensating the sheikh in reject of his Bashiyeh garden if and when he should be dispossessed of it. The general sense of the meeting was that he would be entitled, as a minimum, to a sum representing the original purchase price of the garden, less any amount which he might recover from the successful litigants. It was also felt* and the Treasury did not dissent, that as any litigation in which the sheikh might be involved to secure his title /would arise directly from the failure of H.M.G. to safeguard his interests, it was reasonable that H.M.G. should bear the costs involved. 4. The question of the basis of compensation to the Sheikh for the loss of his tax exemption on the gardens covered by the 1914 pledge is to be investigated further separately. 5.

For the past history of this case, please refer to the account given in the reference made to the Law Officers of the Crown last year which is printed at P«Z # 1890/33. Briefly the position is, that in 1914, in return for assistance given by the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah in the war against Turkey, His Majesty ! s Government promised that the Date Gardens which the Sheikhs then possessed in what is now Iraq territory, would remain in their possession and in the possession of their heirs, and be immune from taxation. H.M.G. failed to impose on the present regime in Iraq a definite treaty obligation to implement the undertaking giT en to the two Sheikhs in 1914, and in 1931 the present independent Iraq Government introduced a system of taxation known as the Istihlak Tax and/ 2730 1000 4.34■ ' ■''' 1 and proceeded to collect it from the produce of the Gardens belonging to the two Sheikhs. In addition to this, legal i- proceedings haye recently been instituted in the Iraqi Courts against the Sheikh of Koweit, by persons claiming to be entitled to a part of the Gardens in his possession, on account of a purely technical flaw in the Sheikh 1 s title. It will be seen that the Law Officers gave it as their opinion in March last year that H.M.G. were under an obligation both to compensate the two Sheikhs for the imposition of the tax by the Iraq Government, and also to compensate the Sheikh of Koweit in respect of any portion of his Gardens of which he may be deprived in consequence of a judgment in the Iraqi Courts. 2. In May last year H.M.G. decided that the first essential was to protect the Sheikh of Koweit from dispossession of any part of his Gardens, and that this had now become the paramount consideration since, apart from serious damage to British prestige, dispossession might involve payment by H.M.G. of a very substantial sum in compensation. In informing His Majesty 1 s Ambassador, Baghdad, of the above decision (P.0.telegram to Baghdad of 8th May, 1933, at P.Z.2698/33) , the P.0, stated that if the Sheikh’s title could be made secure, it was probable that H.M.G. would agree to waive their claim on the Iraq Government for tax exemption, and arrange themselves to compensate both Sheikhs in respect of future taxation, provided that the Iraq Government for their part abandoned all claim to arrears of taxation and undertook to impose no discriminatory taxation on the Sheikhs in future. Sir Fiancis Humphrys was urged that every possible effort should be made to induce the Iraq Government to validate the Sheikh’s title by legislative or administrative act, and he was advised to inform the Iraqis that H.M.G. took so serious a view of the question of possession that, failing an amicable settlement, they might feel compel^ mo Mi cfV vW /vf it*i 3 Department. to take the Iraq Government to arbitration on the whole issue, including the question of taxation. In this connection it may be remembered that in 1930 the then officers of the Crown were of opinion that if H.M.G. went to arbitration on the question whether the Iraq Government were under an obligation to implement the undertaking given by H.M.G. to the Sheikhs in 1914, they would have a reasonable chance of success, and that this opinion was re-affirmed by the present Law Officers in January this year (P.Z.576/34) . For various reasons, however, into which it is perhaps unnecessary to enter in this minute, H.M.G. have been extremely reluctant to take the extreme step of going to arbitration on this issue. It may be mentioned that even if H.M.G. Y^ent to arbitration and won their case, the Iraq Government might fail to implement the undertakings given to the Sheikhs in a satisfactory manner; and that quite apart from any moral responsibility resting on H.M.G., it is politically most important, at y rate in the case of the Sheikh of Koweit, that a ttlement should be reached which is reasonably tisfactory to the Sheikh himself. When His Majesty's Ambassador, Baghdad, took the tter up with King Pei*al and the Iraq Prime Minister, the instructions conveyed to him in P. 0 .telegram of y 1933, quoted above, Nuri Pasha, the then Prime nister, was not hopeful that legislation to validate e Sheikh of Koweit's title to his Date Gardens would be o.p«d b, t». lr« a b.t Bbg FebW pro—d r Pr „oi.

Turning to recent developments, a reference is invited to the note at P.Z.1791/34, the record of a meeting at the P.0, on 21st March last (P.Z.2143/34), the P.0, telegram to Baghdad of 13th April (P.Z.2582/34) and the Baghdad Despatch of 21st May which has now been received (P.Z.3957/34). It will be seen that it has proved impossible to persuade the present Iraq G-ovemmer.t to bring in a bill in the Iraq Parliament to validate the Sheikh* s title to his Gardens, and that, in these circumstances, it has been necessary to fall back on a proposal put forward by Nuri Pasha, now no longer in office, that the Iraq Government should make the Sheikh’s title secure by buying off the claimants to the Gardens, H.M.G. reimbursing the Iraq Government to the extent of £2,000 for thjs operation and at the same time undertaking to compensate the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah in respect of the taxation levied on their Gardens. If the present scheme breaks down (and Sir Francis Humphrys 1 latest despatch is not altogether encouraging) there will apparently he nothing for it hut to take the Iraq Government to arbitration on the whole issue, both of possession and of taxation, .fith regard to the basis of the compensation to be paid to the Sheikhs for the losses suffered by them by reason oi the taxation imposed on the produce of their Gardens, the Sheikh of Koweit has prepared statements to show the extent of the losses suffered by him on this account. These statements are criticised by Sir Francis Humphrys in his despatch of 22nd March (P.Z.2463/34), and we have now received the Political Resident's observations on Sir Francis Humphrys' despatch (P.Z.4093/34).

Since the above was written there has been further telegraphic correspondence with Baghdad, copies of which are attached* In explanation of this correspondence it may be recalled that two of the Sheikh 1 s Date Gardens are involved in the present issue (l)^Bashiyah Garden, and (2)^Faddighiyah Garden. The Bashiyah Garden is much the less important of the two and consists of a narrow strip of land which divides the Paddighiyah into two approximately equal portions. Both gardens are sometimes t* ^ known collectively as the Paddighiyah Estate. The position in regard to Bashiyah is complicated by the fact that there are several persons who have laid claim to different portions of the property and that one claimant has already succeeded in securing a decision in the Iraqi Courts against the Sheikh's title, though action to dispossess the Sheikh in pursuance of this decision is held up pending a settlement of the suits which have been brought by other claimants. in the case of Faddighiyah proper, which is a large garden, there is at present only one claimant, Abdullah as Zuhair, but since he only claims a third + Vio + thpre may be other claimants property it is possible that there may We have recently reminded-the F.O. in the background. • « ^pruning that once the Sheikh s of the importance of securi g •^ + d bv the Iraq Government it will be impo is validated by the ira^i ■n+ +n dispossess the Sheikh y for anv further claimant to dispos + top have succeeded in + .

It will be seen from the latest telegrams that the Iraqis have attempted to raise the price for validating the Sheikh*s title from £2,000 to £3,000 and also to exclude Bashiyah from the validation. Mr. Ogilvie-Forbes, the Charge d*Affaires at Baghdad, adopted an attitude of firmness with the Iraqis on instructions from the F.O., and he now reports that he has received a private intimation from the Minister ■ fivct' for Foreign Affairs that £2,000 may be enough that it is possible that he may have to give way on the question of validating the Sheikh* s title to Bashiyah. If the Sheikh is dispossessed of Bashiyah it will of course be necessary for H.M.G. to pay him compensation.- FILE COPY .

Losses sustained as a result of the recalci trance Oi. certain of the Shaikh’s fellaheen, claimed by the Shaikh to be directly due to the introduction of the Istihlak tax. 3. Colonel Dickson is of opinion that the Shaikh’s claims should be accepted as they stand. He has commented detail, however, only on the claim under III (b) above (Export duty), vide enclosure to my Printed Letter No. C-198 of 11th May 1934. 4 a With regard to Statements I and 11 . Sir Francis Humphry®, for the reasons stated in paragraphs 4 and 5 of his despatch, is of the opinion that the correct formula for calculating the loss in the sale price of dates under this head is not 10^ but 8$ of their value, and that the totals of the Statements should be reduced accrrdingly, becoming I.D.706/027 and I.D.729/169 respectively. 5. It would seem that in taking these calculations His Excellency had in mind the previous miri tax, but (vide Foreign Office telegram Ho.?8, dated the 13th April 1934, to His Majesty’s Ambassador, Baghdad), His majesty s Govern ment expect the 'Iraq Government to waive all previous claims up to a certain date. WHat this date may be is not certain, but it might wellbe the 31st May 1931, the date on which the istihlak tax was introduced, and on which the ^ ^ hv the ’Iraq Government to pay taxes, Shaikh was forced by the iraq since/-3- *111 .?! ■ , •uoiia ililj 'Wil' ,11^ l!o:i 11 lo 6S1, jin t 1 ,$&gt;4 OJ 358 SI 8 l sluolss ^ i j)33il 8ll' J ]0 sli^ J eilso^ s ‘' 110 n^'' JjjB*'' b'S r 5^3 $ ^ since while the miri was in operation the Shaikh paid nothing to the ’Iraq Government. 6. If this argument is correct, then for calculating the compensation which His Majesty’s Government should pay to the Shaikh for the future we are only concerned with a computation based on what he has paid under the Istihlak tax. This is 10% as laid down by the ’Iraq Government. 7. A proportion of this tax the Shaikh, as produce has presumably passed on to the consumer, as is the custom all the world over, and His Excellency the Ambassador has referred to this at the beginning of his paragraph 5. It would seem, however, very difficult to assess this proportion. 8. With regard to the question of customs dues on dat referred to in Statements X and II exported for sale to , -r that the Shaikh cannot claim foreign markets I am of opinion compensation from His Majesty’s Government. 9* With regard to State ment III (a) ctnd (b)^_ Francis Humphrys (paragraph 6 of his despatch) considers that compensation for (a) (Istihlak tax* is admissible. I agree. He is of opinion however that the claim for th\ fTSxnort duty) is not admissible as compensation under (b/ Uxporo a j; bv the undertaking of 1914. Ihe authority not being covered by the un .„ . hv t he Shaikh during the period for the exemption enjoyed y ■ • +-m+ ion is an executive order passed by of British Administration , ol officer, Baghdad, in 1917 ( Tide the Chief Political Officer, + mv Printed Letter Ho.C-196 of 11th May 1934). enclosure to my — + &gt; . order wa s passed because it was held that the Whether this order ^ _ undertaking/undertaking of 1914 covered exemption from export duty as well, is a moot point; and the admission of rejection of the claim under (bj would appear to followiaccordingly. Tile sum involved in &amp;ny c&amp;se, is a small one as it is only of a relatively small quantity* 10. With regard to Statement IV , For the reasons given in paragraph 7 of his despatch, Sir Francis Humphrys is of opinion that this claim should not be accepted. 11. His Excellency writes M 0n the other hand, the Shaikh can fairly claim that he has had to forego part of his saleable share of the produce as a direct result of the Istihlak tax. The amounts involved are large, ID.439/815 for 1932, and ID.531/595 for 1933, and if admitted in principle will represent a substantial annuity. The inclusion of this large item in an assessment of the Shaikh's recoverable losses on account of Istihlak taxation paid can, in ray opinion, fairly be resisted'. The first sentence of this quotation would £rin£ seem to be inconsistent with the last sentence. 12. It may be that the additional proportion of the produce which the Shaikh now pays his cultivators is to compensate the latter for the Istihlak tax which they now pay on that portion of their share which they sell, and on which they did not pay tax under the miri system. ,, QW,-ikVi is or is not due compensation 13.

I agree. 15. I agree with Sir Francis Humphrys (paragraph 11 of his despatch) that the produce prices included in the Statements may be taken to be trustworthy as a basis of calculation. sd.

I have had a series of discussions with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the King, and later on the Minister of Finance, in an endeavour to persuade the Government to present a hill to Parliament which would have the effect of validating the Rhaikh’s title to the disputed properties. During the convereations I used and reiterated every possible argument in favour of this course which offered itself. I reminded the King once agiin of the promise given hy his father to Sir John Simon in June last year that the Iraqi Government would take action to validate the Shaikh's title, and explained that it would he infinitely more preferable that this should be done by legislative or administrative act so that no room should be left for doubt or dispute in the future. although during these discussions the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the King promised that the practicability of a special law would be given the fullest consideration by the Iraqi Government, it has been abundantly clear that they regard such legislation as distasteful to Parliament. The Minister of Justice is hostile to the proposal and the present Government is too weak willing^ to run the risk of asking Parliament to pass a law which would have as its effect the penalising of one oj. the parties to a suit pending before the Iraqi courts, particularly the* t p purpose of the law is to consolidate the interest of a foreign Honourable 'ir John Simon, G.C. © tc., e tc., : # I # , K.C.V.G., etc. non-resident/«h. ^ to.lt.Uon 1» llat „ „ ^ ^ in.,! oo.. m „„, .onia ,. k « . „ „„„ *” r »•-«. or tto o.«. rajr Th „ y ron4i , , a. anno, pr.r.n to go to .nitration, m. ,tdch ttoy a. not shrink, rather tton f.o.

I was therefore thrown hack on to the suggestion which emanated from the Iraqi Government itself that they should attempt to huy out the plaintiff in the Faddaghiyah suit, provided that a valid title for the shaikh was thereby obtained, and subject to the conditions laid down in your telegram of April 13th. 3. In the later conversations with the King and the Minister for Foreign Affairs I agreed that, if the end desired could not he achieved by legislation before the end of the Barllamentary session, the Iraqi Government should proceed on the lines suggested originally by Furl Pasha and supported by the King. T undertook that if a Tapu document could be shown to me which would satisfy me that the Shaikh’s title had been secured permanently, I would be prepared to ask His Majesty s Government to recoup the Iraqi Government their expenses in obtaining it, on the understanding that in no circumstance© would the amount exceed the sum of £2,000. I would not aek the Government for any detailed statement of expenditure and would willingly accept the word of the Finieter for Foreign Affairs that the Iraqi Government had actually expended the amount claimed. inquiries are still proceeding, but I fear that while there would have been little difficulty in arranging these lines when Hurl Pasha first suggested/ a prompt settlement onsuggested it in January, the delay which has occurred in considering it, in the course of which nuri Pasha has disappeared fro* office, has allowed the iron to become cold. The lawyer, or clique of lawyers, managing the case for the plaintiff lias had wind of the proposal and has doubtless acted upon the plaintiff to stiffen his resistance and raise his price, ecret negotiations have been conducted by the Klnf a Private secretary, but without any satisfactory result. The plaintiff has signed an agreement with his legal adviser which prevents him under penalty of £3,000 from making any settlement without the lawyer’s approval, and which provides for the payment to the lawyer of this sum whatever happens to the case in or out of court. The Minister for Forei n Affairs has promised me that action will be taken at once against the plaintiff’s lawyer on the grounds that the agreement is a highly discreditable transaction which is in direct contravention of the law regarding fee agreements. When this has been done, the negotiations with the plaintiff will be resumed by the King’s private Secretary, and His Majesty undertook at my farewell audience this morning that the matter would be put through without delay and the properties would be legally registered in Tapu in the name of the Shaikh* When this has been done I strongly recommend that Hie Majesty’s Government should undertake the entire responsibility for compensating the Shaikh for proved Iopbcs on account of the istihlaq tax.

Solution you propose seems open to serious objections. It amounts to something like blackmail and would constitute admission of a principle which might easily be invoked against u&gt; c on other occasions with unfortunate results. Moreover fact that we wore ready to consider such a suggestion might well give Iraqi Government impression that we were anxious to avoid arbitration at all costs and therefore lead them further to stiffen their attitude. 2. In view of those objections His Majesty’s Government consider that further determined effort should be mao.e to bring about general settlement on lines proposed in my telegram no* 69 (Hay 8) 1955.

If Iraqi Government still refuse to dgree to above solution you may fall back on course recommended in your telegram So. 9 ( of January ll) subject to its being definitely understoodl M l tll L l that no payment whatever would be made until Iraqi Government have rendered Sheikh's title in all his gardens unassailable anl ha/e del initely o.bandoned any claims to arrears of taxation agains u eitnoi oneiKii and have undertaken that no discriminatory taxation will be imposed on the Sheikhs in future. It would also have to be clearly understood that sum payable should in no circumstances exceed £2,000 o 4. Fact that in deference to your strong representations His Majesty's Government are prepared to contemplate falling back on this solution does not mean that they are prepared to abandon recourse to arbitration in the last resort. They are advised that their case if matter went to arbitration would be exceeding:.; strong, and matter is still under active consideration in case attitude of Iraqi Government should render appeal to arbitration inevitable. But, while you should make what use you can of the possibility of reference to arbitration, you should avoid at th„^ stage definitely committing His Majesty s Government to that course. 5.

His Majesty's Government have no responsibility for, or authority over, the division of the produce.

K/e are preparing a draft telegram to give effect # to tne conclusions of tne meeting, but it has turned out to be ratner more complicated than we anticipated and I fear it will not be ready for circulation for a day or two# There seems no reason* however* why we should not agree on the record of the meeting meanwhile, particularly as this may facilitate the submission of tne draft telegram to our various higher authorities when it is ready. 5. I am sending £ similar letter$to Woods and McCombe. Yours ever,somewhat more complicated. It had been agreed at an interdepartmental meeting held on May 1st, 1953, that, if the Iraqi Govern ment would undertake to secure the Sheikh of Koweit who alone was affected by the possess ion issue) in the possession of his gardens, Ills Majesty’s Government might be ready to compensate both Sheikhs for their losses as a result of Iraqi t&amp;iation# A proposal on these lines had after/rards been tentatively jjut forward to the Iraqi Government by His ^ajcmy’a Ambassador at Sa -fiad, W - ir ' mY matter had been held Up While certa i n new features in the Uati0n Were being considered which, it was thought. Eight prove to make the legal ition of the Sheikh of Koweit very much onger than had been previously believed. aiS ^ ^ been Sh0Wl “ot to be the case, ^^.Kende! thought that “Lf. latest telegram (Ho. S &gt; ^ving, 0 f - tech 8nd) showed • # *to the payment of Mackmail. But he felt tlut before dismissing it the meeting should examine the probable consequences of its rejection. Mr. -.■aithwaite said it was axiomatic in the first place that His Majesty’s Government must fulfil their obligations to the Sheikhs, especially on the cjiiestion oi possession* With regard to Sir F. Humphry's* proposal that the plaintiffs should be bought off, he doubted whether £2,000 would in fact be enough. In any case he remained of the 4kW i«**:»,* *«!#•• &gt; v.

Mr* Laithwaite was quite unable either to accept the Iraqi view of the real Sxuyi;cf : ‘ w , oiigin ox the 1914 pledges, or to set the legal opinion obtained by Sir F.

They had never acmtiesced in the Iraqi point of view* If* Handel said that, while he agreed that this might constitute a defence, he was afraid that an arbitrator would attach more weight to the fact that nothing had actually been done by Hie Majesty's Government when the power to do it had Inin with than. He then suggested that Sir P. Hunphrys aij.t be infomed that Uli hojerty's Covern- nent were «n*’ole to accept his suggestion for toying off the plaintiffs, but that he should ° e lllctaloted ^ a further and vigorous attempt to reach a solution on the lines proposed * » •of May 8th.* to Bag&amp;at* although Mr. Len&amp;el p^rconally doubted whether, in view of the objections foreseen by Sir - F.

It was however essential to examine exactly what were the dangers of arbitration. Lalthwaite pointed out that should nis Majesty’s Government lose in arbitration, it might, or night not, be possible to con-* tend-; that His i/Iajesty* s Governii^t were released from their legjj, obligations to the C1 '' l '- “ vt:n 80 » ^Ir solitical obliga- '5 tion would certainly remain anti this was of extreme importance at the present tine.’-i', Jten&amp;eT having intervenerT to sa? that this sight have the effect of transferring the liability to the ftovernaent of Inlife, Kr.

If, however, the meeting should no# agree to recorir.end recourse to arbitration in the last resort he, and he’supposed the representatives of the other Peprrtnents present, would wish to Con- sult higher authority.|f Tj l&gt;,i tiiv;aite. asked wiietber the best course might not be to instruct &lt;jU a. HuMpbrys, while once more putting the pro posals of May. 1955 before the Iraqi Govern- nent, to hold a threat of arbitration vaguely in the background. At the same time Sir F* Itaphrys could be infornicd»privately oi the reasons which made His Hajesty^ Govern ment unwilling to adopt his suggestion that they should be associated with the scheme for buying off the plaintiffs in the action against the Sheikh of Koweit. Mr» Hendel expressed, general agreement with this policy and dir* Laithwaite repeated his conviction 'that speed was now of paramount inipQrtanee* ... HTj— pMl agreed that arbitration must now be seriously considered, but on one assumption; namely, that His Majesty’s Government would rather face the risks of arbitration - and these risks might, if the worst * * •# ♦ having • * * worst' indaefl - than pay £8,GOO, wen though it were in the nature of blackaail. ■ Kr» leitlmaite thought an TOfaronraole iTOression'night he created if Me -ajesty’s Ooveiu^ent offered to pay blackmail and a.fterward-S, haring failed ‘to secure a settle ment, went to arbitration.

Moreover the Iraqi Government were notoriously unreliable and unstable. The whole story was a series of their i allures to implement promises they had made to bir i. Itaphrys that* if the matter were not pressed, all would be satisfactorily arranged. . Mr. Laithwaite commenting on the .probable inadequacy of the sum of £2,000, remarked that a considerable number of people were financially interested in the case. * P . * i Sendej then said that in the light of the discussion, and particularly of the com parative cheapness of Sir F. Humphrys* pro posal when compared with the immense liabilities which might be involved by un- successful arbitration, and of the uncertainty as to the strength of our case in the event of arbitration, he was now inclined to think that the best course after all night be to authorise « « «authorise Sir • HTO)hryB to try the effect of an offer to the Iraqi Gerexment to reiiftam them |p if they tmy off the claimants* He-enquired the view of ilh -coda : 6M net object* but he osfM Aether, in' the first instemoa, the pro:iosala of ¥ay 1955 might not a:fdn be 'lit to the .

A record of the discussion is at P.Z. 1131/34 and a copy of a telegram sent to Bagdad as a result of the meeting at P.2.1130/34. The meeting considered paragraph 3 of the Law Officers' Opinion which suggested that a reference to arbitration even if the result was unfavourable might improve His Majesty's Government's position with regard to claims for compensation by the Sheikhs. It was agreed that in view of the political objections and also o± the fact that His Majesty's Government had had it in their power at one time but had failed to implement ‘their promise to the Sheikhs, no use could be made oi this paragraph of the Law Officers' Opinion.

The meeting did not much like Sir Francis Humphrys 1 latest suggestion that His Majesty’s Government should themselves reimburse the Iraqis^for buying off the claimants (to^JHie extent of £2^000)but before coming to a decision as to what would be a satisfactory settlement from His Majesty’s Government’s point of view, it was decided to ask Sir F. Humphrys for a considered opinion whether the discovery of the original power of attorney given by the oy/ner of the Faddagiyeh estate to the vendor made it virtually certain uhat if the Sheikh defended the Faddagiyeh suit in the Courts he wotild win his case. It will be seen from Ambassador's reply below (P. Z. 179l/34) that the discovery of the power of attorney is considered to be of no use in the main issue m the Faddagiyeh suit (i.e. the question of ownership). Sir F. Humphrys remains strongly opposed to arbitration whatever the verdict and as to the chances of success he quotes the views of the Bagdad Legal Advisers against the Law Officers' Opinion. He is still in favour of his suggestion that His Majesty's Government should agree to guarantee £2,000 but no more, in return for having the Sheikh's title made secureINDEXED In any further communication on this subject, please quote no t vss^ Vanw Vvs&gt;. and address —not to any person by name, but to— 'The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. 1. p 7 X ^ / J • / j pi !&gt; JP»» f a J - 'f' s THE Under-Seoretary of State for -presents his ipliments to ^ and, by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith cop' s -s-o of the under-mentioned paper.

Its value lies in the fact that If the Sheikh loses his case it establishes bona- fides of sale and gives a solid basis for an action for recovery of purchase money. The Sheikh’s attorney has however discovered a legal defect in it which may seriously affect its usefulness. It is impossible to forecast how the court wrill deal with the case but the chances still are that judgment would be given against the Sheikh, There appear to be only two alternatives by which to ensure retention by the Sheikh of his Faddagiyeh property with out the case being heard in the court: (a) legalisation of Sanad by Iraqi Parliament or (b) buying off the plaintiffs. I have commented on these alternatives in my telegram No. 9 of January 11th. I do not believe parliament would pass enabling act necessary under (a) during present session and further delay till November would only result in stiffening Iraqi opposition to proposal. I see no reason at present to question the accuracy of the figure quoted to me by King's representatives and Nuri Pasha and endorsed by Drouer as for the potrose of 00 » * ««•*» ”»**** interestedinterested Armenian lawyer to Political Agent, Koweit, and I am informed ti.iat ministry ol Justice is considering taking disciplinary action against the plaintiffs without delay on the grounds of champerty* There is of course possibility that if the case does go to hearing and is lost the Sheikh will he able successfully to claim refund of purchase money but this will involve considerable delay and expense and play into the hands of the lawyers on both sides who are interested in prolonging litigationo The fact must he faced that Iraqi Government will refuse to accept any responsibility for pledges given to the Sheikh unless the case is taken to arbitration and goes against them. Even then they would take it out of the Sheikh in other ways 0 They hold that pledges given in 1914 had nothing whatever to do with independence of Iraq hut were designed solely for protection of India and Anglo-Persian Oil Company's fields. In spite of law officer 5 s opinion British advisers here are convinced that arbitration would go against His Majesty s Government if arbitrator were made cognizant of all the facts 0 You are aware that I am strongly opposed to arbitration on political grounds whatever the verdict, I remain of opinion that easiest, quickest and cheapest means of protecting Sheikh from dispossession is to buy out plaintiffs and whatever sum may to necessary for this purpose I do not rocommeiid that His Majesty's Government should agree to guarantee more than 2000 pounds 0 Heither Koweit nor accounts of losses due Mohammerah have submitted detailed to Istihlak taxation hut promise to do so shortly= Addressed to Foreign Office Hoc 5 Saving, repeated to Bushire Ho. 1*•\U oaariag their share of responsibility, as &lt;3 it desiraole to continue to work for sueii settlement.

His Majesty’s Government consider that, having regard to all the circumstances no use can in practice De made of last paragraph of Law Officers’ opinion. They still consider equitable amicable settlement preferable to arbitration, but, since Law Officers think that Iraqi Government would in fact lose in ar bitration, they could only agree to settlement by which Iraqi Government would bear fair snare of responsibili ty for implementing pledges. In order to judge nature of settlement which might be regarded as satisfactory, it is necessary to know whether discovery of original power of attorney to whieh Political Agent at Koweit referred in his despatch No. 177 of the 5th August to Bushire, and which he discussed at Embassy on 28th July, makes it morally certain that, if Sheikh defended Faddagiyeh suit m court, he would win. Please telegraph your con sidered opinion on this point. If His Majesty's Government then still think that most satisfactory solution would be settlement suggested in my telegram No. 69(of 8th May)1933, it would be essential that Iraqi Government should bear full responsibility for implementing pledge to sheikh ofof Koweit as regards possession, and His Majesty’s Gov ernment could not agree to sharing that responsibility by making payment suggested in your telegram Ho* 9 (of 11th January) c In any case it seoms likely from des patch MOo 302 of December 19th from Political Agent, Koweit s to Bushire that £2,000 would not suffice for purpose indicatedo Question of method by which Iraqi Government carried out their part of settlement would bo matter for them and His Majesty’s Government would not te concerned so long as pledge to Sheikh was in fact completely implemented by them* When may I expect reply to my telegram ho. 9 Saving(of November 24 th;, 1933?

Humpuxys.P.Z. 576/34. Mr. Walton There have been two important developments in connection with the date gardens of the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah which are to be discussed informally in the near future at the Foreign Office: (a) Sir F. Humphrys* telegram of 11th January, No.9, on P.Z. 384/34. &gt; (b) The opinion recorded by the Law Officers in their letter of 23rd January, on P.Z. 576/34, on the probability of success in the event of H.M.G. taking the Iraqi Government to arbitration. 2. As regards Baghdad telegram on P.Z.334, I am inclined personally to think that the solution favoured by Sir F. Humphry3 has much to he said for it (thesuggestion that H.M.G. should finance it apart). If carried through, would put the Sheikh's title to the date gardens beyond question and it would avoid a parliamentary discussion which might be embarrassing to the new King and which could t I fear that the Treasury ree to pay 000 to safe- ard the title, ey will be ss willing to y adequate mpensation on e taxation sue: it should j made clear L at the fomer »uld be in Ldition to the it ter which iuld be assessed i its separate J.C.W. 31.1. hardly fail to provoke criticism of H.M.G. and their action in endeavouring to saddle Iraq with obligations in respect of the two Sheikhs. In the last resort it «uld probably be worth the while of H.M.G. to add £2,000* to whatever compensation they may have to pay in respect of the relinquishment of the exemption as the price of satisfactorily establishing the title. But the Treasury will probably wish, before going so far as thie , to make an effort to persuade the Iraqi Government to pay. 3 per the circumstances in which the reference o the Law Officers was made please see paragraph 27 of the record of the interdepartmental conference of 12th June 1933 on p.Z.3848/33 flagged.

It appears, further, that our position has, if anything, been strengthened by the not altogether satisfactory exchange of correspondence in regard to these obligations which took place in connection with the Treaty of 1930. 4. On a relatively minor point, we need not object to their view that in the event of arbitration it might be neither desirable nor logical to include m the reference the question whether or not the Sheikh of Koweit, as an independent sovereign, should hold the properties immune from taxation. 5.

Gentlemen, 1 have the honour, by direction of Secretary Sir John Simon, to invite a reference to the opinion given to the Treasury on March 29th last by the then Law Officers of the Crown in the matter of the date gardens in Iraq of the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah. Copies of the case submitted to them and of their Opinion are enclosed for convenience of reference (paper A). 2. In view of that opinion it has become necessary to consider whether it would be desirable to submit to arbitration the question whether the Iraqi Government are bound under their treaty obligations towards His Majesty's Government to assume responsibility for implementing the undertakings given in 1914 by His Majesty's Government to the two Sheikhs. This question formed the subject of an opinion given by your predecessors to the Colonial Oifice in 1930, copies of which are enclosed (Paper B), but the situation has changed in certain respects since that Opinion was given and Sir John Simon is accordingly anxious to have the benefit of your opinion as to the prospects of such an arbitration in the circumstances as they now exist. 3 . The most important change in the situation is that whill the arbitration contemplated in 1930 would have taken place under the Treaty of October 10th, 1922 (Paper O, the situation is now governed by the Treaty of June 30th, 1930 (Paper D), which, in accordance with Article 7 thereof, has now replaced the Treaty of 192.2. It follows from this that the/ HiS Attorney-General and Solicitor-General.2. the provision under which the case would have to be referred to arbitration would be Article 10 of the 1930 treaty instead of Article 17 of that of 1922, while the provision under which it would be contended that the obligations of His Majesty's Government towards the two Sheikhs and d evolved upon the Government 01 Iraq would be the second paragraph of Article 8 oi the later treaty instead of Articles 10 ? and possibly 4^ of the earlier one. 4. Under Article 17 of the 1922 treaty, Hia Majesty’s Government had a right to refer the present question to the Permanent Court of International Justice without the agreement of the Government of Iraq. The effect of Article 10 of the 1930 treaty is that the dispute must be submitted either to the Council of the League of Nations or to some form of arbitration . For the purposes of this reference, Sir John Simon thinks that it may be assumed that the Iraqi Government would agree to the question being referred to the Permanent Court of International Justice, but as Iraq has not signed the Optional Clause, the reference would have to be by special agreement and not by a unilateral written application (see Article 40 of the Statute of the Court] • ihe terms of a special agreement for this purpose would of course be a matter for negotiation with the Iraqi Government; but before these negotiations are opened Sir John Simon would be glad to know whether, in existing circumstances, you agree with the view expressed by your predecessors in 1930 that any reference to the Permanent Court should, if possible, be framed in the widest possible terms so as to cover all the grounds on which it might be held that the obligation to implement the undertakings given by His Majesty's Government to the two Sheikhs has devolved on the Iraqi Government. 5. The question then arises whether those grounds have been affected by the developments which have occurred since 1930/3. 1930. As s.tated above, the relevant provision of the 1930 treaty is the second paragraph of Article 8, which replaces Arcicle 10 of the 1922 treaty. Paragraph 3 of the reference by the Colonial Office to your predecessors, dated May 17th, 1930, shows that while the undertakings given by His Majesty»s Government to the two Sheikhs were mentioned to the Iraqi Government after the signature of the 1922 treaty, they were not included in the list of the commitments referred to in Article 10; and paragraph 4 of the same reference states what occurred in regard to these under takings in connexion with the abortive treaty of 1927. After the signature of the 1930 treaty, but before its submission to the Iraqi Parliament, the British High Commissioner in Iraq addressed a note (paper E) to the Iraqi Prime Minister in which he referredto the method to be adopted for dealing with these commitments of His Majesty* s Government in the list of international obligations devolving upon Iraq under Article 8 of the new treaty, and he proposed, in the event of certain negotiations for the possession of the Sheikhs 1 properties not having reached finality before the communication of this list to the Iraqi Government, to insert mention of these obligations towards the Sheikhs in the list, but to append a footnote to the effect that in the event of these negotiations proving unsuccessful, the question would need to be discussed further between the two governments. The Iraqi Prime lister replied on the same day (Paper B) that this .cedure was acceptable to the Iraqi Government. Accordingly/4. Accordingly on October 18th, 1930, the High Commissioner addressed a letter to the Iraqi Prime Minister (Paper C) in wmch he referred to the correspondence of the 19th August and enclosed a list of ”International Instrument referred to in 'the second paragraph of Article 8 ' of the new treaty, in which the undertakings entered into with the two Sheikhs were included, with a footnote in the terms which had been agreed upon. It will be seen, therefore, that while the undertakings given to the two Sheikhs were never officially communicated to the Iraqi Government under Article 10 of the 1922 treaty, and while the communication made in 1927 was in connexion with negotiations for a new treaty which has never come into force, the obligations in question were included in the list officially communicated to the Iraqi Government of the commitments devolving on Iraq under Article 8 of the 1930 treaty. To this extent the position of His Majesty’s Government would seem to be stronger now than it was in 1930, though the effect of this communication, as showing that the obligations in question have now devolved upon the Government of Iraq, may be somewhat weakened by the statement that in the event of the negotiations for purchase failing (as, in fact, they have so far done), the question would need to be discussed further between the two governments. 6 . The reasons put forward in paragraph 5 of the reference to your predecessors of May 17th, 1930, for suggesting that, apart altogether from the express provisions oi any treaty, it might be possible to contend that the responsibility in respect of these undertakings had devolved on the Iraqi Government would appear to be unaffected by subsequent developments. 7. As regards the point suggested in paragraph 8 of that reference relating to the fact that the Sheikh of Koweit is an independent sovereign and consequently not subject to the jurisdiction of the Iraqi courts or authorities, the legal position/5 . position ol the Sheikh remains wii&amp;t .it was in 1930, but the Istihlak tax (see paragraphs 7 to 9 of the recent reference to you irom the Treasury Paper A) is a tax of rather a different nature from the tax on the gardens which was under consideration by your predecessors in 1930, and levied in a different manner. It is for consideration whether any contention based on the international status of the Sheikh could be supported in the case of the Istihlak tax, except in so far as it is levied on dates which never ceased to be the property of the Sheikh. It may also be relevant that in a case affecting the title to a small date garden (Bashiyeh) included in those the position of which is under consideration judgment was given recently against the Sheikh in the Iraq.! Courts without so far as is known His Excellency having enther challenged the jurisdiction of the Courts on the ground of his sovereign status or explicitly waived his immunity. Efforts, so far unsuccessful, have also been made to serve a writ on him in respect of the most important of the gardens (paddaghiyeh). W should be made clear, however, that the acceptance of service without protest in the case of thefemall Bashiyeh garden appears to have been an isolated incident which cannot, it is arguable, carry the weight of a long dealing cannot, it is extending over a course of years, to the Sheikh 1 s raising the quest should be added that in the event of the paadaghiyeh garden proving to serve a writ on the Sheikh m Exoellenoj/would be advised formal much less operate as a bar sing the question of sovereignty, and it protest. in this connexion it : according to some writers questi ownership of land within the ter sovereignty in the first place, submit to the jurisdiction of t at in the event of the suitors in r espect garden proving successful in their exforts the Sheikh in respect of that garden. His advised formally to raise a plea oi flrs t place, and if it is overruled to sdiction of the Iraqi Courts only unaer connexion it may also be observed that writers questions arising out of the the territory of a Foreign State fom an exception from the general the general immunity from process of a foreign/&amp; . foreign sovereign. 8 . There remains the question whether, in the event of an arbitration under the treaty of 1930, it would be possible to rely to any extent, should it be desired to do so, on the provisions of the treaty of 1922. On this point it is suggested that in order to answer the question whether, under Article 8(2) of the Treaty of 1930, the undertakings given to the sheikhs had devolved on Iraq, a court would have to go into the whole previous history of the matter, including what had taken place under the treaty of 1922, and in particular the position under Article 10 of that treaty. In 1930 it was also proposed to rely to some extent upon Article 4 of the 1922 treaty, and it is suggested that some use could still be made of this point, on the ground that Iraq had, during the currency of the 1922 treaty, been under an obligation to ask the advice of His Majesty^s Government under Article 4 with regard to these undertakings, and had failed to do so. 9 . I have accordingly the honour to request you to oe so good as to take the enclosed papers into your consid eration and to favour Sir John Simon with your opinion upon the following points: (1) Whether, in the event of the matter being submitted to arbitration, there would be a reasonable possibility of its being held that the Iraqi Government is bound to implement the undertakings ger q the two Sheikhs. (2) Whether in any other respect the opinion giyen by your predecessors in 1930 requires modification in the light of existing circumstances, in dealing- with the above questions, you will perhaps be so good as to give your opinion upon the force in the present circumstances of the different arguments suggested in the reference to your predecessors m 1930. 10 ./V J rt. 10. sir John Simon would also be grateful for anj observations of a general character which you may be good enough to offer.

Sir, We were honoured with your commands, signified to us in Mr. G.W.Eendel , s letter of the 25th boy ember 1933, numbered E.7096/308/93, submitting for our opinion certain questions with regard to:- (1) Whether, in the event of an arbitration, it is likely to be held that the- Iraqi Government is: bound to implement the undertakings given to the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah; (2) Whether the Report given in 1930 requires modification. We have taken the matter into our consideration, and, in obedience to your commands, have the honour to REPORT THAT (1) We answer this question in the aiiirmative assuming as we do that the terms of reference will be framed in such a way as to render relevant all the arguments suggested in our predecessors in 1930. The letter addressed by the High Commissioner to the Iraqi Prime Minister of October 18th 1930 is an important addition to the material considered by our predecessors, thus strengthening the claim that the Iraqi Government is bound to implement the undertakings in question. (2) Apart from the necessary adjustment consequent upon the substitution of the Treaty of 1930 for the Tree of/ The Right e Sir Joh1 1 I 2. of 1922 the Opinion of our predecessors does not appear to us, subject to the two points set out below, to require any modification in the light of existing circumstances. (i) We do not think any real point can now be made of Article 4 of the Treaty of 1922. (ii) We are doubtful whether it would be desirable or logical to include in the arbitration reference the question whether the sheikh of Koweit as an independent Sovereign should hold the properties immune from taxation. This has nothing to do with promises given in 1914. The authorities are not clear, and it seems to us rabher a matter for the Sheikh of Koweit to take up. The force of the different arguments suggested in the reference to our predecessors must depend upon the setting in which those arguments are presented. If the government of Iraq can be persuaded to submit the question to arbitration under a special agreement drafted m the widest possible widest possible terms as suggested, we are of opinion that there is considerable force in the arguments suggested in paragraph 5 of the colonial Office letter of May 17th 1930 addressed to our predecessors, and particularly m that there is considerable force in the arguments sui in paragraph 5 of the Colonial Office letter of May . 1930 addressed to our predecessors, and particularly the second suggested argument. The arguments appear - i -f T'nm the list of Brit is h The arguments appear to us to derive derive additional force from the list obligations in respec' at the t: for a Treaty in 1927 a: letter to which we have previously Opinion from the High commissioners Minister of October 18th 1930. ietter to which we have previously referred in this is si oners to the Iraqi prime (3) Generally we think that in default of agreement a/a reference to arbitration, even if the result was unfavourable, might improve His Majesty’s Government’s position with regard to claims for compensation by the Sheikhs. It would help to show that His Majesty’s Government had used its best endeavours to get the promises implemented by the state having sovereignty over the territories; and on one view this may be the full extent of the promises made, as the undertakings were clearly we think contingent on the British Government having the power as a result of the War to implement them.

In the years immediately preceding the dar tne status of the Sheikh of Koweit was of vital interest to His Majesty’s Government in connexion with the Bagdad rail way and it was therefore a matter of some concern to them v/hen, between 1909 and 1911, the Turkish authorities in the Basra Vilayet placed difficulties in the way of the regis- / tration of property acquired in their jurisdiction by the Sheikh of Koweit unless His Excellency would consent to describe himself as a Turkish subject. An article was accordingly included in the Anglo-Turkish Convention,signed on July 29th,1913, to secure to the Sheikh the enjoyment of his private property in the Basra Vilayet. 2 „ The manner in which the present difficulties arose is explained in the following extract from paragrapn a of the case for the Law Officers (dated March 29 th,1953;.

The date gardens referred to in both these letters ore situated in territory which has now become part of Iraq and His Majesty’s Government have always contended that tne iraai Government should inherit these obligations; all attempts in tUs direction have so far failed as the .following paragraphs will whow. 4.

Humphrys and Hurl Pasha in an exchange of letters dated August 19th, 1950, that the obligations to the - helkns should be included in the list, to be communicated to the Iraqi Government, of international obligations devolving on Iraq under Article 8 of the 1930 Treaty of Alliance, with a foot-note to the effect that private negotiations n ’ rr vri +h ^ view to the 1 icpiidution ox the*, were proceeding with ^ view ^ 4 -v&gt;r + if these were unsuccessiui -oarticular obligation ana that if the^e ,, flicoussed further between the two the question would do di^cu.

In these cire im stances it was considered that arbitration involved a considerable element of risk, and in the event ol an unfavourable verdict might expose His Majesty’s Government to large and indefinite liabilities. Despite the grave objections to Sir F. ilumphrys ’ proposal, it was therefore dec iced to authorise him in the event of the 1933 solution definitely proving unobtainable, to fall back on his alternative proposal. 10. His Majesty’s Government’s proposals were eventually communicated to the acting minister xor foreign Affadro in a letter dated January 28th, 1S35 to the xollowing eiioct. On the understanding that the Iraqi Government would ensure that the Sheikh of I,owe it i/vas given a legally valid and unassailable title to his Faddaghiyah property (except that portion of the uashiyah section already alienated from the Sheikh by a Court judgment /for which loss His Majesty’s Government had resigned themselves to compensate the Sheikh/), His La.jest;y s Government would contribute a sum not exceeding £ 2,000 towards the expenses which might be incurred in carrying out the necessary transactions. Provided that effect was given to these arrangements, and on further/7. further understanding that the Iraqi Government^would (a) undertake to make no claim for nrrenrs of tsxc-tion a.go.inst the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah in respect pf their nroperties in Iraq, (b) give the Ambassador a written dj surance that no discriminatory taxation would be imposed on the properties of either of these Sheikhs m future. His Maiesty's Government would raise n? further claim for the exemption from taxation of the Sheikh s properties. 11 It had originally been intended to include in the proposals a requirement that the Iraqi Government should guarantee the Sheikh's title to all his gardens. The Sheikh had accordingly been asked to furnish a written list of his properties in Iraq covered by the 1914 guarantee, so as to leave no room for the Sheikh to claim subsequently that * properties not mentioned therein were 'exempted” properties. As the Iraqi Government could not however see their way to accept this condition and as the Sheikh's titles to his other properties appeared reasonably secure, the Ambassador authorised merely to place it on record, when the Faddaghiyah dispute had been disposed of, that His Majesty’s Government held that the Sheikh's other four properties were covered by the guarantee given to the Sheikh of Koweit in 1914, and that, as the obligations under this guarantee had passed to the Iraqi Government, His Majesty's Government would, in the event of the Sheikh being dispossessed, make a claim against the Iraqi Government in respect of such dispossession.

Clfirk Ferr ? s p r oposals of KovejiAer 1 955 12. In the summer of 1955 the Embassy reported that their attention had been drawn to certain inadequacies in the 1954 pronosals which suggested that even if the Iraqi Government could be persuaded to accept the proposals, the difficulties connected with the Sheikh of howeit's titles to his gardens would not be disposed of. They were requested to put the points, together with any alternative solution which they had to suggest, in an official despatch, 15. In November 1955 Sir A, Clark Kerr reported accordingly that neither Sir F. Humphrys nor he himself had been able to induce the Irani Government to take any action on the lines of the 1954 solution, and that there was n little hope of their making any real attempt to carry it out 5 ’. He pointed out that even if the Iraqi Government could be persuaded to issue to the Sheikh a proper Tapu Sanad in respect of his Faddaghiyah gardens, the Sheikh would not thereby necessarily be safeguarded from claims (a) in connection with reclaimed land not yet registered in Tapu , (b) of the fellaheen who by planting the trees had acquired rights to certain portions of his land ( *Taab rights*') and (e) of other members of his family. 14. Sir A. Clark Kerr therefore proposed that the Sheikh of Koweit’s title to his properties in Iraq should be examined de novo with a viev/ to dealing with all questions of rights to these properties and that a Commission should, with the consent of the Sheikh ot Koweit, be set up by the Iraqi Government (l) to enquire into the boundaries of all land claimed by the Sheikh, (2) to examirm all outside rights to the land, and to value such claims as might be proved to be legal rights under the low ot ...rau, and9. and (S) to register in i'apn all lands, etc,, of the Sheikhly family as a private Wakf to be administered by the ruling Sheikh of foweit and to forbid the Iraqi Courts to entertain actions by members of the Sheikhly family regarding their share in these lands„ He pointed out however that this proposal, although providing for a definite settlement, unfortunately presented certain difficulties. In the first place whilst the Iraqi Grcvernment might be willing to set up a Commission, if it could be done without special legislation, the Commission would probably only have adequate powers if set up by such legislation. Secondly, whilst it would be impossible to estimate until the Commission had completed its work how much compensation would have to be paid to outside claimants, neither the Irani Government nor His Majesty s Government would be likely to De willing to pledge them selves in advance to an indefinite financial liability. 15. The comments of the interested authorities on these new proposals are summarised belowo 898/18/95. (1) The Political Resident, after consulting wim the former Political Agent, Colonel Dickson, was inclined to view favourably the proposal for a Commission, provided that an official who would look after the interests of the Sheikh and of His Majesty's Government was included amongst its members. As regards the diliioulties to wh.ioh Sir A. Clark Kerr had called attention (see (a), (b) and (c) in paragraph IS above), he suggested that the Sheikh could register the accretions provided the Iraqi Government put no difficulties in his way, and that the Taab aau-S and the disputes between the Sheikh anu members -Po m v 1 -\r10. * 58/82/93 1935. , 51/18/93 family were not covered t&gt;y the 1914 pledge (air. Beckett takes a similar view of these difficulties) (2) The Government of India have no observations to offer. (3) The India Office are in general agreement with Colonel Fowle's views (see (1) above). 2456/18/95 E 2452 E 2185 16. Sir A. Clark Kerr has been invited to observe on Colonel Fowls's suggestion as to the composition of the Commission (see paragraph15 above). He considers^tnat if the Commission is to be given powers to pass decisions as to title and compensation with all the force of un appealable judgments of the courts, the most that the Iraqi Government could he persuaded to agree to would be the inclusion of one of the British officials in their service. At the same time he anticipates that the difficulty of persuading the Iraqi Government and the Sheikh to agree to a Commission with such wide powers may prove insuperable and that it may prove necessary to a , .ipnre limited terms of relerence ? hack on a Conmussion vath more limn - . , +v . 0 ^v+pnt of the Sheikh s namely merely to enquire into the extent a the mtune of the counter-claims against him claims and the nature oi + n oo-h ^factory settlement, 1 ° as a preliminary step to a satisfactou . ri^no- fa') the composition . • 4 - 4 ric +'''noti ons pen&amp;iciiK-S ^ 0 / requests explicit mstxU.tions of the suggested Go,mission and &lt;t&gt;&gt; Its po.ers.. same tt„e ho feeds that as it aop.aes »h„ o „a tion with kt.

Whilst it was evident that the Sheikhs would have to be compensated in some form for their losses under this new Istihlak tax, it was decided that before a decision could be reached regarding the amount of compensation eventually to be paid, or regarding the basis on which it would be calculated, it would be necessary to have the opinion of the Law Officers, whether or not the Sheikhs' losses under the new tax wore covered by the 1914 pledges. In March, 1935, the Law Officers advised that an obligation resided upon His Majesty's Government to compensate the Sheikhs for the imposition of the Istihlak tax, and the modality of that compensation was accordingly discussed. 18o As regards the Sheikh of Loweit the India Office 58/508/ suggested that the following alternatives were open to 15 1933 His Majesty's Government: (i) The payment annually of a sum sufficient from time to time to indemnify the Sheikh and his descendants in respect of any annual payment which they might have to make to Iraq; His Majesty’s Government to remain liable for such payment so long as the descendants of Sheikh Mubarak hold the gardens covered by the 1914 pledge. (ii) A corresponding payment for the life-time of the present Sheikh only.12 . 'y (lii) The capitalisation on the basis of the value of a perpetual exemption (? 25 years purchase or thereabouts) of the oresent eost of the exemption; and the payment thence annually to the Sheikh and his successors of the proceeds of the capitalised sue:. (iv) Payment to the Sheikh of an immediate lump sum representing the capitalized sum, referred to in (iii), the Sheikh thereafter becoming liable to such taxation as the Iraqi Government might impose on his property in common with other similar properties, and His Majesty's Government s obligation under the 1914 pledge being finally liquidated. The India Office felt strongly that having regard to the terms of the original undertaking the indemnity could not be confined to the losses suffered by the present Sheikh during his lifetime. The Treasury saw Parliamentary objections to the recurrent charge of public funds proposed in courses (i) and (ii). Course (iii) moreover shared the advantage of courses (i) and (ii) in that payment could be withheld in any particular year if the Sheikh's behaviour 5 and )7/274/ ' 1954 were unsatisfactory., 19. Before going further with this question it was decided to establish the extent of the taxation losses tor which the two Sheikhs would have to be compensated, ihe Brnbassy assessed the amount of compensation which might reasonably be given to the Sheikh of Ioweit for his Istihlak losses at £1,000 a year and that to be given to the Sheikh of Mohammerah at 50* of that figure. It was however decided to go no further with the compensation aspect until the question of title had been disposed of, because (a) the final decision on compensation might depend on whe compensation15 *1 )46 compensation was to be paid to cover taxation exemption elone, or taxation exemption and the loss of the Bashiyeh garden, or taxation exemption and the loss of the Bashiyeh and other properties; (b) were His Majesty's (lovernment to disclose to the Iraqi Government that they were willing to hear the cost oi the Sheikhs taxation losses, the Iraqi Government might have little incentive to validate the Sheikh of Foweit’s title to his gardens; moreover, the Iraqi Government might prove reluctant to waive their claim to taxation arrears without the quid__Ero quo of His Majesty's Government's proposed financial contri bution towards the settlement oi the possession difiiculty. 20. This aspect of the question remained therefore in abeyance until Sir A. Clark Ferr put forward the proposals referred to in paragraph 12 above. The India Office, the Treasury and the Political Agent are now anxious that consideration of the compensation aspect shall not be deferred pending the setting up of the suggested Commission, should it he decided to appoint it, as it may be anticipated that some time will elapse before a settlement of the possession aspect on the lines now proposed can be reached.^ The Treasury have pointed out that His Majesty s Government liability under this head is increasing every year, and favour a 'lump sum’ payment to the Sheikh of loweit m return for a formal discharge binding on his successors as well as on himself, such a settlement to be conditional on the Iraoi Government undertaking (a) to claim no arrears from either Sheikh in resoect of the taxation exemption accorded under the system in force before 1952 rassessed at some £80,COO] and (b) to give a written assurance that no discriminatory994/35/ of 1932 598/274/ of 1934 14. discriminatory tax would be imposed on either Sheikh in future (as proposed in the 1954 solution; see uaragraph 10 above). 21. The claims of the S heikh of Mohanunerah under the 1914 undertaking are on a somewhat different basis to those of the Sheikh of Koweit. The Sheikhs of Toweit remain independent rulers, but the Sheikh of hohammerah has relapsed into subjection to Persia and it is conceivable that he will have no 'successor' in the special and semi- independent feudal circumstances which it might be claimed His Majesty's Government had in mind in entering into the engagement of 1914. The Foreign Office have taken the view that the Sheikh of hohammerah should be treated during his life-time on the same basis as the Sheikh of Koweit, without prejudice to a possible decision on his death that he had no 'successors' and that His majesty s Government could therefore regard their obligation as exhausted. As regards the modality of the compensation it had been suggested that the payment should be made through the Legation at Tehran to prevent the money being seized by the Persian Government; this suggestion did not however commend itself to the Legation, who suggested payment should be made through a bank. 22. Assuming that there is no reasonable prospect of inducing the Irani Government to agree to the 1934 proposals (see paragraph 10 ) four alternative solutions of the ' possession ' question would appear to remain for discussion: (a) The Ambassador's 1935 proposal for a Commission with full powers (see Paragraph ), (b) A Commission with limited terms reference (see paragraph 16),(c) Some modification of the 1934 proposals more likely to he acceptable to the Iraqi Government. (d) Arbitration (c.f. paragraph 9). Further action as regards the ^ compensation ** question uill to some extent depend on which of the above courses is to be adopted in the n 'oossession i ' ? question. It is for discussion whether the '’compensation 1 ' 1 aspect can be pursued independently of the ’’possession'* asoect (c.f. paragraph 19); whether a solution should be worked out previously^ concurrently or subsequently to the ’’possession'* settlement (c.f. paragraphs 16 and 20 ); and whether the settlement should be on the lines now proposed by the Treasury (see paragraph 20) or whether another of the alternative solutions proposed by the India Office in 1933 (see paragraph 18) should be pursued. 23. It is possible that reference may be made during the discussion to a despatch recently sent to the Ambassador in connexion with the position of the Sheikh of F owe it in regard to civil suits in the Iraqi courts. Sir A. Clark Kerr has been instructed to explain to the Iraoi Government that the suits brought against the Sheikh in respect ol his real property in Iraq would normally have come within the scope of the exception admitted by International Law to the general rule of immunity from process of foreign sovereigns s and that His Majesty’s Government wouid normally have been prepared to transmit the relevant documents for service on the Sheikh, but that they nevertheless consider themselvesthemselves under no obligation to assist in the service of these documents in the special circumstances of the case ? since to do so would be clearly inconsistent with the 1914 pledge 0 The Ambassador has however been instructed to take no action on this despatch pending the concurrence of Colonel Fowle*ITCU/GCH/CW/AW, (164 groups) D E GYP H E K OP 3- E„L S^G prom poXi ti c 3&lt;3.

We agree generally with your view of the present position of this matter. Beckett has however the following comments to offer. 3. As regards paragraph 2, whilst it is certainly correct to say that amongst the grounds for our refusal hitherto to serve the documents on the Sheikh, the fact that the latter is a foreign sovereign has been predominant, it has however not been the exclusive reason. The reason we now propose to adopt has always been present and Beckett points out that when the question first came up, he advised that it was not entirely sound from the legal point of view to base our attitude, in this class of action, on the ground of the Sheikh’s sovereign rights J• Clauson Esq.

As you point out in paragraph 3 of your letter, the practical position is the sane as before, namely that as the law of Iraq is at present, the process against the Sheilch cannot continue so long as we refuse to serve it. Nevertheless it has been in the past, and still will be, within the power of the Iraqi Government so to amend the law of Iraq, as to provide, as English law provides, for substituted service in cases where a defendant deliberately avoids service, although well aware of the proceedings against him. 5.

The relevant passages run as follows:- 'The Ambassador left for Koweit yesterday tf Nuri Pasha seems anxious to bring about a detente 'in relations with the Sheikh, and has written to the 'Prime Minister suggesting (a) that the root cause of 'all trouble is the Sheikh’s present uncertainty about 'his properties in Iraq, and (b) that the time has now arrived/ .

You will see that Clark Kerr, in his telegram No. 98 of May 1st, suggests that Stafford, who was Financial Adviser to the High Commission and^for some time after the termination of the mandatory regime,to the Embassy, should be called in. Stafford’s employment in Iraq terminated a little over a year ago, I believe, but I have now got into touch with him, and it is clear that he has a very considerable knowledge of the whole affair, and would be very/very glad to assist in any way he can. The only difficulty is that he is now 'being re-employed hy the Colonial Office in Nigeria, and leaves to take up his new appointment early next week. He is however quite free to attend a meeting on the afternoon of Friday, May 15th, and I think it would he most useful if we could take advantage of this, provided that it is convenient to you and the Treasury.

In para graph 5 of m despatch Mo. 629 of November 80th last, the suggestion was made that it should, inter^^lia? be empowered to examine all outside right© in the land claimed by the UhaiKli ana to value ench elaiiae as are proved to be legal rights under the law of Ira* would, in effect, aean that if constant reference to the Iraqi Courts were to be avoided, the oownisaion would have to be given powers which would cut across the ordinary legs! procedure of this country, and I consider it al»ost certain that the Iraqi Government would be unable to agree tc the inclusion on it of the representative of a foreign government. If, however, they went *# far as to accept the idea of a commission with ouch wide powers, they are hardly likely to make difficulties &lt;#► « nr*i ti«h official in the service ©a to the presence on it of a British ezraw* * ^ /of The Might Honourable Anthony' Keen, M*Oa» ©tc. , etc. ©tc • 9«*$£«• of the Iraqi OoYomjaont» and they might ©Ten consent to his being mad© Ohainaan. His exact standing on the commiBsiou would not, howorur* appear to be a matter of primary import ance, since decisions would presumably be taken by a majority vote* 8, But it is, to say the leant, possible that the pro posal for a commission with such wide powers will have to be abandoned, and that any eomxisidion to be established would have to confine itself to an inquiry into the extent of the Shaikh 1 © claims and the nature of the counter-claims against him as a preliminary step to a satisfactory settlement (of* paragraph 4 of Mr. Gorell Barnes’ letter Ho. 107/5/36 of January 23rd to hr. b T &amp;r&amp;)» In that case, and supposing that no legislation on the part of the Iraqi Oovemment would be required for the constitution of the commission, it might be possible for them to agree to the Inclusion on it of a representative of his kaj©sty’s Government. On the other hand, the haikh’s objection to a commission composed exclusively of Iraqi officials would presumably be greatly lessened if its terms of reference were limited to inquiry only and if his right of appeal to the Courts remained therefore unaffected Cy &amp;ny decisions to which it might come. 4 , The question of the proposed commission has uem discussed with :dr. grower and I append hereto a letter which he he® now written thereon.

IRAQ MINISTRY OF JUSTICE Baghdad, 12th April, 1936. D. 0, No. J. A/490. K Ky dear Bateman, Belt has asked me to give you my views on the subject of settling the affairs of the Sheikh of Eowait by a special Commission. In order to fulfil the following promise, given to the Sheikh in 1914 H Your gardens which are now in your possession, that is to say, your date gardens situated between Fao and Qurnah, shall remain in your possession and the possession of your descendants without being subject to the payment of revenue and taxes’*, it must first be ascertained what lands are covered by the promise and then the Sheikh must be vested with an unassailable title. The first part of the business need not have anything to do with the grant or correction of title deeds. It in volves only an administrative enquiry into an area, fixing its extent and the recording of such claims to title as may be made. A survey is necessary and it would appear natural for the Sheikh to have it made, first of all, so that he can present to the investigating authority a map for it to work on, showing exactly what he claims to be included in the promise but I do not know whether the Sheikh would be willing or able to do it, or to pay for it, or whether the Surveyors, acting unofficially, would be allowed to work in peace. Tne last point has been suggested by Hogg who considers that, if anything is to be accomplished, the Surveyors would have to work under the direction and protection of the Authority charged witn making the enquiry. That Authority may well be a Commission /and,- 2 - and, in view of the nature of its work, it would appear eminently reasonable for the Sheikh to be represented on it; I see no reason why the Iraqi Government should reject such a proposal. Once the area is ascertained, the Sheikh must be granted a clean title. This would involve the passing of legislation to justify the barring of claims against the title and, presumably, providing for compensation in suitable cases. Whether Parliament should, before the enquiry begins, confer on the Commission^ power to order the registration and assess and award compensation, or whether Parliament should wait until the preliminary enquiry has finished before granting the title or authorising the Commission to grant it, is a matter for discussion. To give the Commission pov/er to pass decisions as to title and compensation with all the force of unappealable judgments of the courts appears to involve difficulties. For one thing, the decisions may be dis pleasing to the Sheikh and the British Government. For an other, it would be difficult to ask the Iraqi Government to confer on a mixed Commission the power to award compensation up to unknown amounts- It appears to be better l ox* tao two Governments to decide what is to be done after the exac^ area has been agreed upon and the amount of compensation has seen ascertained. If the latter course is adopted there will be no necessity for legislation to set up the Commission ibecause its decisions will not be of a judicial nature so as to affect any public or private rights) but if it cannot ge*. on with its work without the power to enforce the attendance of wit nesses some law governing procedure would be needed. I have spoken of compensation in suitable cases. have no knowledge of any claims that would require to bo oarred by legislation except the rights of the judgment holder in the Bashiya case and the pending action regarding the Faddaghia /Estate.Estate. I am only supposing that other claims may he found to exist. Yours sincerely, (Signed) E.M. BROWER. p, s. I would recall that survey and assessment, of a preliminary nature, were done in the case of the Railways. A mixed Commission (mixed in that it included a represent ative of the Railways) produced a report on the land occupied by the Railways for the purpose of enabling the British and the Iraqi Governments to consider what should be done next about paying for it. The work of the Gommission gave a clear idea of the problem to be faced. It was so clear, in fact, that it was distasteful to both Governments, but that is another story. C. II. Bateman, Bsq.5. in settling pecuniary compensation question. As regards taxation see sir P. lunohrys r despatch No. 162 of 1951. Both ‘treasury and India office appear in error in assuming that Sheiks are being made to pay annual sums in taxation, ./hat they claim is compensation in respect of losses of profit due to payment of Istihlaq or produce tax by persons who purchase their dates. Viewed in this light I cannot agree that this ques tion is the /ore urgent of the two.

Our present policy in regard to the Sheikh of Koweit's date gardens is to concentrate on the compensation aspect and sidetrack the possession aspect. This, as pointed out in your Minute at P.Z.1581, involves certain difficulties the chief of which concerns the claims brought j against the sheikh in Iraqi Courts. It is essential, from our point of view, that these claims should be kept out of Court for the moment so that the Sheikh’s position has not been compromised by the time we revert once more to j the question of possession. It seems, therefore, all to the good that we should now take up this question of the civil suits^ and, so far as I can see, the Foreign Office draft takes a sensible line. It does not give much away and tends to throw responsibility upon the Iraq jvernment which is all to the good if they are willing to ;oe pt it. Which is probably highly unlikely. However, t the Iraq Government dislikes the tone of the despatch = should be no worse off than before and can continue to ifuse to serve documents upon the Sheikh. X suggest, therefore, that we concur in the terms f the Foreign Office draft despatch, but it might be as it to oolonel Fowle asking him to 3 ll to send a copy of it to OOionex =nd his concurrence direct to Bagdau.Draft Paper.

Iraq Government’s occupation of Bhaikh of Kuwait’s land at Pao. Sir, I have the honour to report that I visited the estates of His Excellency the shaikh of Kuwait in Iraq including that at Pao on the 15th and 16th of March. g # Before leaving Basra I saw Colonel lard, Director of the Basra Port who informed me that the Iraq Government now expected him to begin work on the Oooly Gamp at Pao on the land selected by him on the Shaikh’s estate, the right to which the Iraq Government claim. It is said that since my visit some stakes have already been driven into the ground, constituting perhaps ’’occupation”. I am asking the chaikh to make sure of this point and inform me in writing. Port officials have certainly been on the ground measuring it up and marking points temporarily, as the Bhaikh’ s agent at Pao told me* 3 . .3 you ere aware from previous correspondence notably your Express Letter to Baghdad 109-.., date ISth February 1S36, occupation of the plot in question wi open up also the question of the BhaiKh's right over a wider —by the Port BireCoOi* area than the plot now required oy i. . . hfl , rt1aaram attached will explain the situation reference to the diagras* a v o, tt . 1 M. to which «h«. or. »c * 1 * 1 ' there is a 'Sanniya' document from the sublime o orte- 2 - dated 14th Ha j air an 1320 for tae whole ?ao estate; the exact limits of which might he disputed, (see para 4 of annexure II to this Agency despatch No.C-294 of 15th Nov saber 1934 ). 4. Long occupation - and in the case of the J-ao estate it is about 100 years - is of course a basis of claim but in the case of a patch of land allowed recently to fall into disuse the law, I suppose, might declare the land forfeit. The Shaikh would willingly forgo his claim if it were not that his title to other lands may be prejudiced thereby. 5. The situation is therefore that the occupation of the patch of land will entail in all probability the loss of other lend., or if the ,bai£h defended his rights, bring to a head the v&amp;ole question of the fhaikh's title and introduce him into a jungle of legalities. 6 # That the law is very involved I have no doubt after talking to Tir.Justice Lloyd at Basra on ray return from Fao. As I understand, very briefly and avoiding technicalities and side issues, Mr.Lloyd contends that the proper course for the Shaikh is to seek Tapu deeds for the fao estate on payment of a sum equivalent to the value of the laud at the time of first occupation, the latter in itself a natter leading to argument. Bailing this his view is that the Iraq Government without dela should begin occupation whereupon the shaikh could protest ana sue the Iraq Govornflant, without however I gather, Much chance of success. ?. It Might be possible to avoid all this if the A ■&gt; -d to postpone occupation Iraq Government coula be parsu&amp;a-a . v . u,.- emceed with the scheme for and order th. Port Director not .o proceed a Cooly Camp on the land in question. ^ e\n if they could be g # This presumably they would v / convinced that ^ t ia l the natural progress (a) the camp is not essential to the Bao Dredging Station and • 4 «nv case probably not theirs (b) that the land is in a y but the shaikh’s. 9./9 . It is perhaps not for me to say what i s&gt; or i s not, essential in the way of improvement at Fa 0 but it may do no harm to say what I saw there, 10. In the palm gardens outside the J?ao Dredging Camp, there are a number of pis4 de terre huts of the type common in Iraq, occupied by coolies and others employed by the Port Authorities at Fao. The huts are spaced out irregularly. This clean a little village under the palm trees, I may say, make s/not unpleasing scene. There is a reasonable space, may be a hundred and fifty yards, between the residential buildings of the Dredging Camp and the village. Beyond the village the palm gardens continue for less than a mile westward and immediately beyond them and where scattered palms and old ditches begin, is the site chosen by Colonel lard for the symmetrical Gamp to which be wishes to transfer the inhabitants of the mud village for improvement of health*. That enthusiasm for accomplishment and improvement should lead to this move, I can well understand but that it is essential from any point of view, I should doubt without more evidence than my ayes gave me on the 16th March. Therefore I do not think that it can he reasonably coat aided that delay ia the buildiag of the Cooly Gamp would be a spoke in the wheel of Iraq’s progress. U. Secondly with regard to the evidence that the Shaikh could produce to show that the land is his and that he would have grounds for contesting occupation, I on enquiring locally that there is evidence to be had from numerous survivors that Bund ”A' (See diagram) was built by Shaikh Mubarak of Kuwait, although 1 m&lt;: ' repaired, and its alignment sli^tly altered (although not opposite the plot now in question) during the British Occupation and more recently during the Kainate of one Ata *d at SIBA. in this connection the Degree ^ee sSheets (1910) may be studied. They eeem to prove that the bund existed then, although Colonel (ard informs me that he heard of its being built about 1915 and was therefore that it was then that it was made. Another map to be studied which shows clearly the palm garden with various half cultivated patches East of it is Degree Sheets Mesopotamia, 2 miles to 1 inch - Kuwait (Sheet 140.8) , published by Govermoent of India Survey Department, 1917 i ssue . sure There is no second bund (See para 3 of iimbassador, Baghdad’s despatch No.38/2/36 of the 6 th January 1936) and I failed to hear of any local opinion to confirm &amp;the statement therein quoted although I asked the Port Directorate’s representative with me and Mr.Coaster of Fao if they could not produce it. ouch local people as we encountered and questioned gave their opinion forcibly the other way. (The Mu dir of Fao has, I believe, never been asked his opinion by the Iraq Government or the Port author! ti es). 12 . Mast of the bund old ditches show where there were attempts at palm cultivation since abandoned owing to the saltiness of the ground and the attraction of labour away to the Port Gamp. To Morth and oouth of the patch in question palms stunted by salt have survived and there is no plainly defined limit to the cultivated area. Certain cultivators still possess letters of authority granted to their fathers from Shaikh Mubarak giving th ^- 1 1,110 r ^ exploit this land and these letters oould be produced. IS. Shaikh Mubarak from this evidence ,as therefore indisputably in effective oeoujation of the liina in qU and built the bund (A). U 3ven the Port Representative at Fao, Mr.Coaster, to - iilfarentlaUy «.« - »» “• „ h „. n( , d to use his words, that Shaikh’s right to the land and hoped, he 'would not be jockeyed out of it'. 15 ./15. It tharefore seems to me that we have reasonably good grounds for saying that it is believed that the Iraq Government would not be enduring any hardships by postponement of the Gooly Gar&amp;p soherae and that the land, could the case be argued in a Court of Law, might be found to be the shaikh s, and that being so ask for postponement of action by the l-ort on the grounds that not only the Shaikh will be involved but the British Government too - should the case go against him, 16. As a reserve position upon which we could fall back there is the fact that the shaikh is willing (I have his verbal assurances only and shall not ask him for written ones unless you instruct me) that he would either give, or let at a peppercorn r ent the patch of land required by the Port Directorate, if this would solve the difficulty.

I have hopes that considerable Indirect acknowledgement of the Shaikh’s title to the patch now in question, by Turkish authorities in their correspondence relative to the Fao estates, 110 y be found. 2 # His Excellency the Shaikh has not considered this as 'evidence** worthy of being submit tea to you but I see no point in with-holding anything that may have a bearing on the case, and which in the aggregate, if not individually, may strain a degree of value as evidence. 3 .

G.S.de Gaury, Captain, Political Agent, Kuwait.» .. -- Jnder-Secretary of State, negotiating v/ith the Iraqi Government on the sahject. The line which Mr. Eden would propose to instruct the Ambassador to take in discussion with the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs is set out in the accompanying draft of a despatch to Sir Archibald Clark-Kerr, and I am to request that he may be furnished with any observations upon its terms which Lord Zetland may desire to offer. 3. Mr. Eden considers that there would be advantage in keeping this aspect of the dispute concerning the lands owned by the Sheikh of Koweit as far as possible distinct from the main problems of securing for the Sheikh a firm title to hio lands and assessing the amount of compensation due to him in respect of Iraqi taxation.

Sir, With reference to Foreign Office letter E 4049/82/93 , of tne 9th Jul y&gt; 1935, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Eden to transmit to you, uo oe laid before the Secretary of State for India, the accompanying copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad regarding the rights of the Sheikh of Koweit and members of his family to claim immunity from civil uits brought against them in the Iraqi Courts. 2. The Secretary of State has given careful consideration to the arguments advanced in Sir Archibald Clark-Kerr 1 s despatch as well as to the question of the best tactics to be adopted in India Office.concurrence of Lord. Zetland, that the question of the instructions to he given to Sir Archibald Clark-Kerr in reply to his despatch of the 8 th February should be pursued without waiting for the interdepartmental meeting which it is intended to call shortly to discuss the policy of His Majesty’s Goveriment in the United Kingdom in regard to the two main issued referred to above. 4. A similar letter is being sent to the Treasury. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,COPY (E 780/18/93) No. 70 |fe30/2/36) By Air Mail (Copies by Bag) BRITISH EMBASSY, BAGDAD. 8th February, 1936. Sir, #ith reference to the correspondence ending with my telegram No. 167 of the 19th June last, I have the honour to inform you that, in a recent interview, the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs raised once again the question of the position of the Shaikh of Kuwait in regard to civil suits. His Excellency complained on the usual lines that at present the Shaikh was able to file civil suits in the Iraqi Courts through pov/ers of attorney given to his agents, but that no actions could be brought against him, as he would not accept service of the necessary legal documents. A list of the cases which are said to have been held up owing to the uncompromising attitude of the Shaikh has since been forwarded to me by the Director-General of Foreign Affairs and a translation is enclosed herein. 2. On January 22nd I replied to Nuri Pasha that I had studied the Embassy files on the subject, but had found that no further information had been received since the note No.318 of the 14th June (see my despatch No.330 of the 15th June) had been addressed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Since, however, it now appeared that the Iraqi Government desired to pursue the matter further, I would, as promised in paragraph 2 of that note, make enquiries in the competent quarters. 3. You will observe that in the last two cases mentioned in the enclosed list, it is not the Shaikh of Kuwait himself who is quoted as defendant, but one of his relations. Shaikh’s Le Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C. , M. P. , etc., etc., etc.Shaikh’s claim to immunity from the jurisdiction of the Iraqi Courts is made on the ground of his status as an independent foreign sovereign and cannot, therefore, he extended to cover his relations. Documents have, in fact, on several occasions during the last few years, been served through the diplomatic channel on various relations of the Shaikh, including Maryam hint Shaikh Mubarak, and an attempt to serve the actual documents involved in the last case mentioned in the enclosed list was resisted by that lady, not on the grounds of any claim to immunity, but on the ground that she had received no legacy from her husband. 4. In these circumstances I would propose, subject to your concurrence, to inform the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs that there is no question of the immunity claimed by the Shaikh being extended to his relations and that His Majesty s Embassy are always prepared to forward legal documents emanating from the Iraqi Courts to the political Agent ac Kuwo.it for service on any Kuwaiti except the ruling Shaikh hi iself. I am very doubtful of the validity of the reasons for which Maryam refused service of the documents involved in the last case mentioned in the enclosed list and would therefore propose to add that, if the Iraqi Government are not satisfied with her feasons, it is always open to them to say so and to leturn documents po this Embassy in order that a second attempt to effect service may he made. 5. x'he remaining six cases mentioned in the enclosed .ist all concern the ownership of portions oj. the Shaikh late gardens in Iraq, and in each of them the Sheikh hu.iself is iited as defendant, ‘the persons guoted as claimants were aentioned in Mr. Ogilvie-Forbes’s letter to the then Minis ror Foreign Affairs No. 483 of 22nd August 1934 (see his despatch ,o. 492 of the same date), and the only information of importance contained in the enclosed list which was not given m Mr.OgUv Forbes s/Forbes’s note is that the lady named Bahiyah filed a suit against the Shaikh in 1933. 6 . The question of the right of the Shaikh .of Kuwait in international law to refuse to accept service of documents which require him to appear as a defendant in the Iraqi Courts has keen fully discussed in correspondence ending sith Sir John Simon’s telegram No, 161 of the 18th June, 1935. After carefully studying this correspondence I feel -chat there can be little doubt that the general rule of international law under which the Shaikh is entitled to claim immunity ff*om the jurisdiction of the Iraqi Courts is subject to an exception in connexion with actions relating to the title of a foreign sovereign to real property owned by him in another country, and that the cases now under consideration come within the scope of that exception. I understand, too, that the Iraqi Government themselves are well aware of this. On the ground of equity, therefore, I am loth in any further discussions with the iraqi Government to maintain the attitude that the ShaiKh's refusal to accept service of the documents at present under discussions is wholly justified in international law. An attempt to do so would, in my opinion, also be bad policy, since it would almost certainly affect adversely the prospects of persuading the Iraqi Government to agree to a reasonable settlement of all questions relating to the date gardens in Iraq ox the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Muhammerah and might indeed emoanass my now cordial relations with the Iraqi Government. 7. on the other hand, it is clear that if the ShaiKh were now to admit the exception to the general rule and were accept service of the documents connectea with the suits have been filed against him, he might as a result oe deprived of large portions of his property m Iraq wmch perhaps justifiably, to have been covered by the pledge given to/to him on behalf of His Majesty’s Government in 1914. it would, then be necessary to comp senate the Sheikh for the loss *| of such of the property in question as might be found to have 'been covered by the pledges of 1914, and it would no longer 'be possible to settle the question of the respective responsibilities in this matter of His Majesty's Government and of the Iraqi Government on the lines of the proposals contained in Sir Francis Humphrys’s note No, 37 of the 28th January, 1935 (see his despatch No. 64 of the 31st January, 1935) or with any modification thereof which may be decided upon when my despatch No. 629 of the 28th November last has been considered by the competent departments of His Majesty's Government. In this event I imagine that His Majesty's Government would be unwilling to accept entire responsibility for compensating the Shaikhs, and that if the Iraqi Government were, as I expect, not prepared to accept a part of the responsibility of their own accord, would be obliged to ask them to agree to submit the matter to some form of arbitration. To this course there are obvious objections) and in my opinion it should only be adopted as a last resort. 8 . I doubt whether the Minister for Foreign Ait airs realizes the full implications, as explained in the preceding paragraphs, of his request that the Shaikh should agree to accept service of the documents connected with the cases now pending against him, and I feel certain that he and the Iraqi Government as a whole genuinely believe that the Shaikh is taking advantage of the protection afforded to him by His Majesty s Government to adopt an attitude in the matter which can justified on grounds neither of equity nor of international I venture to suggest, therefore, that I should ue authoiiz move from the uncompromising position which I and my predecess have/have previously loeen instructed to take up in this matter and to explain the position frankly to the Iraqi Government. I should then feel much more hopeful of being able to enlist their genuine help in an endeavour to find a satisfactory solution for all the complicated problems arising out of the ownership by the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Muhammerah of property in this country and of the pledges in respect of this property which were given to the Sheikhs on behalf of His Majesty’s Government in 1914. 9 . I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Honourable the political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have, etc. (Signed) Archibald Clark Kerr,6 . You should explain that the suits ght against the Sheikh of Koweit in respect ds Iraqi real property would normally have i within the scope of the exception admitted nternational Law to the general rule of the nity from process of foreign sovereigns, find Majesty’s Government would normally have l prepared to transmit the relevant documents service on the Sheikh.

My dear George, Your despatch No. 92 (E 327/18/93) of the 13th February, enclosing copies of correspondence with the Treasury about the Shaikhs f date gardens in Iraq. 2. I fully understand the opinion of Fowle and the India Office that the time has come when some compensation must be paid to the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Mohammerah in respect of their losses under the jLSjrihlaa tax. But you will realise that from our point of view the danger is that there are few secrets in this part of the world and that once the Iraqi Government came to know that the Shaikhs had been pain compensation for their losses under the istihlaq. tax, any idea of a compromise settlement of all the questions relating to the Shaikhs’ date gardens would lose for them vu^t li attractiveness it might have hac. 3 # In this connexion I think you shoua-d ^ noV/ Yoat there has appeared recently in the local press, both in Bagdad and at Basra, a series of articles drawing attention to the fact that a sum of about 1.2. 2C ’ &lt;X ' C J '- j:K - in£ outstanding against the Shaikhs in respect of taxation on their properties for the years 1928-1981 and RENDEL, ESQ. , C.M.G\f\Wi suggesting that the government intend shortly to take steps to collect this amount.
