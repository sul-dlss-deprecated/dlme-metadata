THE firft Voyage perhaps may not affoardfuchfatisfadionas fom will exped , and by confecjuencc give the Reader no Appetite to r go forward; but he whofe leifure will permit him togo forward, will in the 2d and 3d Voyages find amends for what is defediv in the firft.

IN the firft V oyage we find him imbarqued for Genoa in a new Ship, which, with another, was built for that State at in the year 1647. From Gmotx he went to the Eaft-Indies, where by the way he gives a very exad Defcription of the Siena Liones, car, Syam, (with the moft horrible Maffacre committed upon the greateft Perfonages in that Kingdom,) then proceeds on his Voyage for where he gives you an account of that Ifland and Formofa. lis the fccond the moft remarkable is the Ingagement between the Venetians and the Turks, by Sea, in which the former fought a fignal Vidory. In this Voyage I alfo find a very accurate Defcription of the Greek Iflands, as they are now peopled, with feveral Footfteps of An tiquity.

Their Government is Monarchical , and the King for many ages has been abfolute Sovereign , over this and the neighbouring Territories and Dominions , and that with as much Power , Grandour , and Reverence from the Subject, as any Potentate or King , under the canopy of Heaven.

On the middle of the Para de before the pallace , were erected 5 Towers j upon each Tower a poll, that which itood in the middcll was 30 fathom high, the other 4 that flood in a quadrangular form each 20 fathom. The Fabric of thofe Towers was very artificial: Roundabout under the Architraves , they were neatly painted with Foliage , raif'd with Gold, and deprelf'd with Umber and burn'd Ivory.

On each fide the Herfe were 14 of the Kings Sons, with green twigs of palm in their Hands, who all the time went in a heavy po- fture, their eies dejected to the Ground, framing a fad Countenance, and uttering many fighs and exprellions of Sorrow.

Roundabout this Ifland are taken abundance of Fifh, efpe- cially Harders , which are fomewhat bigger than a Haddock. This Fifh they fait like Cod , and fend it for Chi , where it is had in great efteem. The Row of this fifh is alfo held for a great delicacy among the Chineezes when pickled , being red, and lies clofe and round in a thin skin , which naturally grows about it.

Melons, or Musk-millions, are here fo plentiful and delicious; that I have been cloyed barely with looking at them when -they were cut up ; befldes Water-milions and Pompions which are alfo of a very good taftandjuycy.

Beafts of Prey do much annoy the Inhabitants that they dare not adventure themfelves far within Land, as, Tygres, Leopards, Bears, &amp;c. Apes and Monkeys they have , which are generally litle. There is a certain Creature on this Ifland which the call, 2)fn smpm tian taj ovan; that is . The Deytl of Formofa. Being about 2 foot long, and 5 inches broad upon the back, with fcalesall over the body; it has four feet with fharp claws , a fharp long head , and a tail thick at the rump and fmaller towards the end,likea Crocodil.This litle beaft feeds only upon Pifmires , which he catches by laying his Tongue upon a Hill, where they come to feed upon a flimy matter , that runs out of his mouth , and that holds them fo fall that they cannot get off again: When he thinks that he has enough, he draws in his tongue and de vours them. It cannot do any harm unlefs to the Ants , which are its natural food, but if he fee a man come towards him, either runs into the Earth , or rolls himfelf in, like a Hedghog : fo that to call it a Devil feems a great improperty.

During the time thatlwasat Fomo/i, I heard often of Men with Tails: to which I never gave much heed, looking upon it as fabulous. Yet I-will aflure the Reader by all lawfull afleverations, that I found it truth. For it happened that a Formofan of the South-Countrey was apprehended for an inhuman Murther , committed upon a Clergy man. After the matter was examined and the Party pronou need guil ty, he received Sentence to be burned.

But as to the certainty of that, I can not fay much , for that, not underftanding his Diale6t, they might be miftaken; only of this I folemnly aver that I am an eie-wktnefs to it, and would be loath, to impofe it upon any man's beleef if it were not truly fo. Upon Feftivaldays when the For mo fans go to prefent themfelves before their Idols they hang great round, boards almofl: like Trenchers to their ears, which are artificially painted : others hang Shells full of Small holes , which loll over their breafts : but upon other days they let their ears be naked, and without any ornament at all.

After we had been three days at T^anguefaquc, and all our Cargo unloaded by the laponeez.es : they (hut our Hold up, and fealed it with the Emperours Signet. Which done the Officers went aflnoar, and fent us 6 Balis of Sakky , a Drink they make of Rice, which is very pleafant, yet heady and ftrong. After our Ships-folk had got a litlein their.heads,they put out our Colours; but while they were in the . heighth of their mirth, thererofe a bluftring wind , after which ' followed a mighty Hurricano. Upon that our Courage was fufficient- ly allayed,for both our Cables broke, and the Ship was tofsed moun tains high, we looking for no other all the time than death. The Ship £&gt;e Wit was like alitle Boat upon the top of every furge, andat laft thrown upon the Strand where fhe lay drie : but all her Bow was bilg'd,her H^ad broke, and her Hold full of Sand and W ater.Our up- perworks were fadly battered,and the mafts brought by the board.l he Black Bear and another great Ship lying both with out the head, were fo fluttered, that they were brought up by the laponee&amp;es as Wrack. Befides this great lofs which the Company {uftained in the Shipping, were alfo moft of the Wares in the Magazine damnified by the Sea, which beat over the Walls.

It is feated upon a very Sl,t ' acl ' commodious Bay, or Road , fit to receive Ships of the greatelt burthen. It has a very magnificent profpeft from Seaward, having an an infinit number of Towers , Temples and Spacious Palaces. The Houfes are moftly built of Wood, for the Ground is weak and frequently fubjccl to Earthquakes , fo that they cannot life Hone. But the poorer fort have litle Cottages made of Twigs and plaifter'd over with Clay, as in Brabant, and other Countreys. They are Covered with Flanks which Ihootfar out over the walls like a Pent-houfe, to ftielter them from Sun and Rain. They have upon each houfe feveral Tubs with water, which is kept in cafe of fire, to which fuch buildings are liable. And certainly were it not for the great benefit of the water running through the Town in Ditches, as it does in moft Towns in Holland : it would be fuddenly reduced to ashes and for this reafon have they built feveral Houfes of Stone where to fecure their Goods upon fuch occafions. The Houfes of this City are uni form , and the ftreets regular', there being 88 Streets, each 400 foot long, which are are all fenced off with Palizados at the end, and Lant- horns fet up. Here they have alfo their watch-houfes, and none are fuffered to pafs by night j no not to fetch either Doftor or Midwife, without a Pafs from the Governour. This Watch is fet allways at 10 a clock, after which hour few people are feen upon the ftreets.' This is a good means to prevent Mutiny and Theft, but is a great incon venience if Fire do happen to break out j for no ftreet or Ward Can have the Affiftance of another in fuch cafe : befides the great danger' that the People themfelves are in, being fometimes fo narrowly pen'd up. An Inftance of this happened in the year 1646, when a dread- full fire happened in a houfe where feveral Dutch had their lodging , which on a fudden had confumed a great part of the Street and feve ral Houfes on both fides, burnt down to the Ground. The then feeing themfelves in fuch peril, chufed rather to hazard the eff efts of the Governours difpleafure for that time, than to berpafted alive , broke up the Fence and faved themfelves.

Neverthelefs fmce it is a part of my Province, to take notice offuch Towns as are in any regard eminent and famous , I lhall not ommit to fay fomething briefly of it. This City which is one of the chief Havens in renowned , was by Francis and Ferdinand , great Dukes of *r ufcany upon coaiideration of it's commodious lite raifed from a mean village to a great Empo rium. The faid Dukes fortified it with a ftone wall, fince which time it was gradually advanced by the encouragement of Trade ^ and is at prefent ftrengthned with 5 Bulwarks and 2 Cittadels, or Forts the one whereof commands the Haven, and the other fecures the Town on the Land fide, towards Ptfa, which is furnifhed with 60 great Guns. About 6 Englifh miles from the City is a Beacon for direction of Marriners by night, there being many Rocks toward the South that are often the occafion ofShip-wrack,and is therefore called Malhora, Thefe Rocks docaufe impetuous breakings of the Sea, which yet render the entrance of the Haven more free and fecure. So that Ships and Galleys may ride fafely at anchorin this Road. The City on the out-fide appears more magnificent than it is indeed in- wardly:The Frontifpieces,as well of Privat as Public Buildings being plaiftered, upon which are painted Sea-fights, Hiftories and Land- fchap. In the midle of the Town is a {lately Market place and an Exchange., where (as at other Places) Merchants meet and negotiate their Affairs.

Aboard this Ship was an English Woman who kept a Houfe of En tertainment at femee , notedly known by the name of Mrs. Penters, and one that was very kind to the English and Dutch when in anyftrait or trouble, and many of our Nation were forry when they heard of her Death.

When I faw that there was no hopes to get to the Fleet, I turned back, but not without fear of being taken, knowing that this Ifland was but 3 or 4 leagues from Sao, and that it was often vifited by the Turks. After I had been here 4 days and as many nights, came 2 Brigantines to receive Contribution-money , which I underftanding ran into the Woods to hide my felf, but it feems one Pick-thank or other had told them that a Venetim was left aflioar (perhaps to excufe them of their £)uota. ) they began to make inquiry after me &gt; and would needs infill upon the Greeks to be refponfible for me ; they told them that I had made my efcape by night in a Barque ; which never- thelefs would not pacific them till they had dawbed the Captain in the Fill,which clofed hisEies and fiiut hisMouth effeftually.

Thenextday we travelled through a great Wood , in the middeft whereof was a broad Marlh , that coft us fome Hours to go over. When we were through the Wood, we pafled through feveral little Villages ,the Inhabitants whereof were amiferable filly People, hardly:lle H liti SEPT. I66S. C h a p.- 1.

As for their Houfes they are but one degree beneath a Hog-fty and thofe as full of tltenfils, as a Knave is full of Honefty. All that ever I could fee was an earthen Pan or two, and thofe fo clean , that I had rather faft a week than eat any thing,that has come out of them. Great plenty of Cattel they have, and fuch as have three times as many feet as they themfelves. As for Beds they have none but fuch as their Oxen ly upon , for when they have ftuffed their Gutts , they ly down upon the floor one after another, as the Nap lakes them. T heir Diet is fuitable to all things elfe they have , for although they might have Venifon for knocking on the Head , the Creature may live 'till Doomf-day before they will take thepains to lift a hand to kill it,unlefs it be a loufe , which fometimes they crufh to death for change of Diet. As for their Bread it is not much unlike owr NeTv-caJlle Coal for colour,but how it is ofT aft I know no more than theMan in theMoon, for neither my Appetite nor Curioiity could move me to it , Cab bage they have in great abundance, which is of a T aft like Sorrel, but clofe and white like ours, That and Cucumbers are the main ingre dients whereof thefe People feem to be compounded , but more efpecially the latter, for Ctimher attends them from the Womb to the Tomb , being held in perpetual Slavery by their Lords.

They have no manner of Schools w herein to educate their Children, that ever I could fee or hear of: neither Churches or other Houfes for Religious ufe; fo that they are brought up in the greateft Blindnefs and obfciirity that may be.

Yet they are flexible enough to Idolatry by Nature , and withall fuperftitious. In our going through the Woods we faw a great Troop of them bufy about Oonjuring of a Tree, which they had tied with a Garland of twigs, creeping round about it and making a great Howling •, but fo foon as they faw us, took them to their Heels and away.

They have a formal Oath, that they take upon divers Occafions which is thus, The Party cuts up a Turf or Sod of Earth, this hefets upon his Head and takes his ftick into his Hand, Wifliing iffuch, or fuch a Matter, benotfo, andfo, that They with their Cartel may be confumed with Fire.

In Ihort they are but one remove from Bruits , and fo ignorant , that the moft part of them thinks there is no other Land in the World befides their own.

It was our opinion that they were affraid that our Company was ftrong- er, and that the reft followed us , for they were better arm'd and mounted than we, befidesthe Waggons we had to take care of, or otherwife in all probability they would not have neglected fuch a fair booty f that being, as we were told by the Waggoners , one of the moft dangerous places in all the Countrey.

By the way we faw many fmall Villages , but at night came into Cohmna , which was the faireft and beft Village I had therto feen in CMofcovin : the Inhabitants are reputed wealthy , and live in very good fafliion. We came pretty early to our Stage 3 having had very good way, and reafonable fair weather, fo that.we had time enough to take a view of the Town, Our or Guid , who fpoke good T^c t her Dutch went with us to fhow what was worthy of remark, andverycourteouflyrefolvedus in any thing we delired to be fatis- fied about. On the 14 th we went through a great Wood where we faw abun dance of Wolves playing together , which , when we would have taken aim to ihoot with our Long Guns , they ran inward and took the Wood. Our Pnjlaftold me that they knew us to have Fire-locks about us , that being the only fafeguard to travel with , without which they will not fear to alfail Horfe and Man , and fometime lay fculkingin the way fide, where of a fuddenthey run out and prey upon Palfengers.

About the Evening we came to Push, where we remained that night , but could not get any Lodging fit to entertain us either for Houf-room or Viduals , this being yet a poorer Village than that of Mtedna. At this place happened a Quarrel between one ofour Company and a Rujf the firft having taken the others Ax , for that the Rufi' had ftolefom Tobacco from him; which being made known to the Company, they ftruck and mifufed the poor Mtijs, after an unfufferable manner j which Capt. Butler refented very ill, not willing to give the Ru/iam any difguft. But above all the peo ple in the World there are none that covet Tobacco fo much as they do, and will be lure to ileal it, if they cannot otherwife come by it, although they were fure to loofe their Heads for it. On.the 2 3 by break of Day , we fet out and entred another thick Wood. Here they ftiowd us fom Graves where they told us, 8 Dutch Merchants were buried , who had been murthered by Robbers. When we were got thro the Wood we went over a fair Pafture- ground, andfaw divers Boors Houfes by the Way-fide. In the Eve- . ning we arrived at Tor (lock , which we found to be but a fniall, yet well-built City, although it appeared greater, from the Number of Towers which we faw, when at a diftance, having above 3 o Churches and Chappels within the Walls. Here we unloaded our Sledges and left them, putting our Goods aboard fome fmall Shipping that was provided for us, and fayled down the River to Troet^kt where we took mlbm neceffary Pro villous.

In the mean time it froze fo hard , that we were all beniimmed , and fain to run after the Waggons to keep our felves Warm.

So that the large and wide Dominions of the Cr.4y,are extended as well into the Aftan Continent.

The Voyages of lohnStruys. 131 very large City, and computed to be about 30 or 3 5 Englifti miles in compafs, yet was almoft twice as great, before it was taken in and 9 ' depopulated by the T artars. It gives a very fair profpeft from without by reafonofit's many Towers and high Buildings. This City is di vided into 4 wikes or Wards , to wit, , or midle City , j^^^-or Czar-gorod, the Emperours City, and Thefe feveral Divifions feem rather fo many diftinft Towns or Cities whereof * Kitay-gorod ftands in the middeft , and is environed with a high wall, which they a^Xcrafmi Stenm , that is , Red Wall. *Ptr!&gt;apt It is feated between 2 Rivers, to wit Islofcqua on the South, and the cl'thaia. Neglim on the North , which are united behind the Palace. The Palace together with its Appendences, to wit, the Wall, Horn- works, Crefcents and other Fortifications is the larger part of the Kit ay -gored, called alfo Crim-gorod ; being wel^l provided with Men and Ammunition. In the midft of this Palace is a VcryTi^tely Church, in which we faw a Silver branched Candleftick , formerly prefented to the Cz,ar by the Ambafladorofour States. Befides this Church is another dedicated to the Archangel, where are to be feen the Tombs of thofe of Imperial blood, as alfo Trtotzis and that of St. which are both very fumptuous. T hofe which are in with out the Palace are alfo reputed the belt and faiieft in all Mo [cost , being reckoned 56. Befides the Churches which are within the Walls of the Palace are 2 very beautiful! Cloyfters, the one for Young Gent lemen , and the other for Ladies , who have refolved to live a mo- naftichal Life; altho the formermayrather go under the denomina tion of an Iluftrious School, becaufe it is appointed for the Education of the Young nobility in all kinds of Literature and good Manners, who at 16 Years have a choice preferred them , whether they will lead a Ghoftly or a Secular Life : but that for the Ladies, difpences not with fuch a Freedom,but all that are admitted mull continue durante yita. In the middle of this Palace, or rather Fort , is a high Tower, which the Ruffians call I-van Veltke , that is Great being covered with Copper and double guilt. This is that Tower , on whofe Top the Emperour Boris GudemTv as is to be feen in their nLTd Chronicles } brought a Perftan AmbalTadour to view the City , and amongft other difcourfe began to fpeak of the great Loyalty and Obedience of fome fubjeds to their So veraigns in paft ages ; Whence R 2 great tlieay: 13 4 The Voyages of HI the Emperour took occafion to fay } Sofanhfullarc my fuhjects _i6«9. high eft Bojar, tothe meaneft Fajfd,that these is not one of them &gt;ho.

It is as much as 5 o ftrong men can move, and that only fo as may j uft be perceived. It is feldom rung, and that only upon Feftival days , or when any Forreign Prince or Minifter of State dcfires it. When they intend to do it at any extraordinary time , they make proclamation through the Town, by which warning the Citizens rake down all the Glafles and Earthen Ware, for it makes all tremble and fhake. There are befides the Imperial Court feveral other fpacious Palaces for the So/^, or Nobility, as alfo for the Spiritual Lords , amongft which that ofthe Patriarch is the moft magnificent.

And hence it comes that they live in perpetual Jarrs , and contention , when fometimes in hopes of a fweet, well-ffiaped , and comely Darling, they are chain'd to a ftinking , crooked and deformed Hag. This induces me to a Tale of a young Squire , who thinking himfelf old enough to be a man, intimated his Inclinations to a common Broker, or Match-maker , withall conditioning beforehand that he would not come to any conclufion with the Parents of his Party, till he had by fome means or other got a fight of her Face, which the man pro- mifed to do j and accordingly goes to an old Couple who had long intreatedhim to procure a Husband for their Daughter : this faid Couple he acquaints with the bufinefs who no lefs joyfull to under- ftancl it pray'd him to haften the Match : now you are to underftand by the way that their daughter had but one eie , which made fome difficulty in the carrying on the matter,by reafon that the Young man would not venture upon the purchafe, unlefs he faw what kind of a Bargain he had : However the Broker gives her inftruftions , how to behave her felf in palling by the Houfe where this Youngman was to be, and bad her look alwaies on one fide, which ffie did.

T hey have many quaint Ceremonies about Marriage : thofe of the highefl Rank ufe thefe following Rites.

The day before the Wedding the Brides S^acha goes to the Bridegrooms Houfe to provide and furnilh • the Brides Chamber and Bed with what elfeis requifite , being atten ded with 60,80, or perhaps loo Perfons according to the degree and ability of the Parties.

Here the Bridegroom is to tarry fo long difcourfing with the Friends of the Bride, tillflie fends a Servant 'to introduft him into her Chamber, where being come (he is brought in, ftately apparrel'd, and fet by his fide, buthenotfufFered tolook her in the Face , nor Ihe him, and when they cannot withhold their curiofity but offer to lookafide, as longing to fee that dear Vifage, whichever after they may mutually do with more freedom than any other in the World, there is a Flag or Tablet of red Silk fet between them , to hinder it! When they are fet the Brides STvacha plates the Hair of the Bride and fets a Gold or Silver Coronet upon her Head , richly fet with Precious ftones and Gems, to which are fixed two long Pendants of Diamonds , or (if it be Perfons of a lower Calibre) of bafer ftones, thefe hang down to their Breafts. So foon as the Bride is drefs't, the Bridegrooms STvacha likewife combs his head; upon which all the Women fall a dancing- After they have dane'd a litle, there come in two young men with aBasket of White bread and a greatCheefe upon a Barrow,covered with Sables, which is confecrated by the Prieft and fent to the Church. When this Ceremonie is ended,they bring a great Silver Charger, and fet it upon the Table , in which are laid fome pieces of and 7*/, with feveral Square plates of Silver, as alfo a handfull of Hops, Barley and Oats, niixt together: upon that that the STvacha arifes and covers the Face of the Bride , and ftrows the mentioned things out ofthe Charger amongft the Guefts , when as thofe that are minded may take up the pieces of Silver. When that is done the Parents of the Parties interchange the Rings of the young people. When thefe Ceremonies are ended, the Svacha fets the Bride in a RidingThe Voyages of John V o y . HI.

Then follows the Bridegroom , accom panied with the Prieft both on Horfe-backjand after them the Friends on both fides. W .hen they enter the-Churchthe Bridegroom takes his Place which is covered with Taffataf, whither alfo the Bride is brought. When they are fet together there are feveral Images of Saints fet up before them , upon which the Priefl: pronounces a Bleffing : and afterward taking the Bridegroom by the right hand, and the Bride by the left , asks , Are you Mn- trimony whether ? The Parties then anfwering , the Prieft fings the 128 Pfalm, which they likewife mutter out after him. This done the Prieft fets a Garland upon their Head , uttering thefe Words , Increafe and multiply , tohat G O D joyn feperate. Then all the Friends light their Torches , and the Prieft takes aGlafs of Red Wine into his Hand, which he delivers over to the Bridegroom and Bride to drink off, then taking the empty Glafs from them delivers it to the Bridegroom who throws it down and the Bride ftamps it with her foot to powder , faying, feet 1 and be crushed to poivder, Tvho go About to f Upon that the Married Women ftrow them with Hemp , wiflling them Profperityand a happy union. Thefe Ceremonies being ended they return home again after the fame manner that they went to Church. So foon as they have entred the Houfe,the Bridegroom goes and takes his feat at the Table where he receives, and bids all his Guefts welcom but the Bride is brought directly into her Chamber where the undreffes her to the Shift and lays her down upon the bed, The Bride beingthus laid fendstocall her Bridegroom by two of her Servants with Torches in their Hands. Immediately upon his entring the Chamber., flie jumps out of the Bed and purs on a Gown fur'd with Sables, and giving him the hand goes out with him, but her Servants in the mean time put out their Torches by running them into one of the litle Barrels [mentioned in Pag, 142] Thus hand in Iiand they go to the Table where all tlie Guefts fit.

After they have bathed they come and accompany their Guefts, who all the time were merry at Table, in which Humors they continue fometimes a Week, or 10 days,before they depart to their refpective Lodgings. The foregoing Ceremonies are fuch as thofe of the beft rank ufe, by which you may perceive more vanity than Reafon in this'Folk: However I think we have no great caufe to hifs at them for their folly, fincewehaveas many infignificant Rites amongft ourfelves,which are with them equally fencelefs and as plain puerility , as theirs may be etteemed by us. But as lor the Plebeians and Pefantry theirs is after a different manner. The day before the Marriage is to be lolemnized, the Bride groom fends a Kinfmanof his own to the Brides Houfe with new ap parel , a Cap, a pair of boots , a Comb and a Box of painting and other materials for Rigging. The day following comes the Prieit and gives the benediction : which done, he brings them a Looking-glafs requiring them to look into it both at once. In the mean while the STvachas ftrow the Guefts with Hops wi filing that the Bride may be as fruitfull and increafe her flock , as that Weed. After that comes another who prefents the Bride with a Sable or Beaver- skin, withall wifiiing her fo many Children as there are Hairs upon the Hide, Thefe Ceremonies ended at home they go to Church, and are married, in manner as before.

Divorcements are with them very frequent and thofe obtained upon very eafy terms ; for when either partie finds themfelves too weak at blows, and not able tb repugn the other, 'tis only to fliave and betake themfelves to a Cloyfter , whence they may never be brought out by any legal mean.

The Ceremonies which are ufed in fome places differ from others. About die Corps is follow'd by a Train of Gentle women who ai-e neareft: in Confanguinity or Affinity , who with a great Noifeand Howling bewail the early departure of their Friend, then prefently all are filentj that not one is fo much as heard towhif- per V or give a Sigh, and then on a fudden elevate their Voice and yell out like fome of the more bruitifh and favage On each fide the Herfe go the Priefts , Chaplains and Monks, bearing Images, Torches, and a Thurible, or Incenfe - pan, which is all the while waved to and again , to expell Evil Ghofts which they believe ftill haunt the Body of the Deceafed. After the Corps follow the Friends and Acquaintance , without any order, each car rying a Wax-tapour in the Hand.

When the Friends have fo taken their leave the Prieft delivers him a Letter fuperfcribed to Saint , containing a hearty recommendation of the Deceafed. A copy of one of thefe came once to my hand which before I had Tranfcribed it out , was taken from me by a Prieft being the Brother of the Gentleman who lent it me, for it is not lawfull for a Rajstan himfelfe to know the Contents, much lefs for a Heretic. TheParaphrafe of the Fragment was after JVlanner, GreatiSi The Voyages of lohn Strujs. HI. The^Hiu rcho f Mofcoyu has like that of Rome , onefupreme Head, who is the Patriarch. Under the Patriarch are 4 Metropolitans, 4 Arch -Biihops, befides many other Bilhops 3 Abbots and the Inferior Clergy. The Patriarch is almoft Sovereign in Spiritual AfFairs 3 having an ablblute and immediate power without any appendency, on the Temporal Government Unlefs it be in cafe of inducing Herefy, upon which he muft Submit to a Synod , as in the year 1662, a General Council was called 5 and the Patriarch fummoned to mike his ap- pearancej at what time he was impeached for Innovations , and in- devouring to alienate the prefent condition of the Church and reform it's Government by diminifhing Image-worlhip, which lie held for litle better than Idolatry. After many days fitting that Council thought fit to confine him to his Manfion-Houfe , and ordain the Firft Metropolitan in his room, who was then living when I was at Mofcou. The Revenues of the Patriarch, as alfo of the Metropolitans, are very great, out of which they are obliged to levy and Maintain an Army of 15 000 men &gt; during the time of War. The Habit of the Patriarch, and the Metropolitans differ but litle. The Patriarch has always a great Crofier born before him, or a litle one in his hand and fometimes both , this they call a Pofik. Mitres they wear only upon Convocations or high Alfemblies , and upon folemn Occafions. Abroad they are diftinguifhed by a high Cap, flat at top like the STvit&amp;ers , or Yeomen of the Guard. Next their Bodiethey weara Caflbc, and above that a long Gown or rather a Pall, which is born up by two Gentlemen. The Inferior Clergy and Priefts wear a Cap but not fo high as that of the Superiors.This Cap is given them when they are ordained by the Bilhops , at what time they lhave their Heads, and fuffer it to grow no more, fave in two litle tuftsjuft above their ears. r u r There is a Law among them that whofoever beats one ot thole Clerks fo,that his cap fell to the ground,he is liable to a very fevere pe nalty ( if I well remember to loofe his hand ) which neverthelels happens frequently in the Cabac : but to prevent the worft when a Lay man is minded to beat one of thofe Mufhrooms,he firft takes ® 15 Cap and then trounces him ofFfo long as he will &gt; which done he lets the Cap upon the right Block again. rheC hap.

If a Priefts wife come to die before him, he is not only injoyned by the Church to remain a Widdower, but alfo to leave the Altar , yet not wholly to lay down the Prieftly Funftion, for he-may fit in the Chore or Chauntry and afliftat Mattins and Vefpers , as alfo at Admini- ftration of the Sacraments 3 as far as it is done without the Verge of the Altar. For this reafon the Priefts are beft matched , as ufually making much of their Wives , and treating them more gently than the Laity generally do , left by hard ufage they Ihould drive them into melancholy, and confequently fend them too early out of the World, which fends them as fuddenly from the Altar. Baptifm they hold forth as a Sacrament very neceflary , for which o/jji/- reafon they make as litle delay as may be between the Womb and the F ont. If they fear the Child be weak they have it Baptized at home, but never in the fame Room where it is born, for that they hold un clean. TheConfponforsor God-fathers being come to the Church Porch , the Prieft meets them and repeats the Benedidtion. The Godfathers deliver 9 Wax-candles to the Prieft , which he places round about the Font afterwards turning about toward the Eaft mutters out a Verficle or two, then taking the Incens-pan goes round about the Font, which done he fings a Pfalm or Hymn , making a brief Oraizon, and after that demands the name of the Infant which is delivered him in writing. So foon as he has read the Billet, askes, whether the Child beleeves in the Sacred Trinity ? and , Whether he utterly Forfake the Devil, &amp;c. To which they confidently reply in the Affirmative. Then the Prieft pronounces this Adjuration, Get thee hence, rhan unclean Spirit, tvd make D p ay for the Holy G hoft. Then he takes the child into his Arms, blowing three times in his Face , and making a crofs upon his Head, dips it three times in Water, Saying, I baptize thee in the Tattle oj the F ather , and of the S on , H oly G host .

Cafan is a great City , and reafonably ftrong , but it's Walls and Df / ?r; - Towers of Wood, as almoft all the Rujiun Towns are. The Cittadel caflt^ is walled with ftone , and well provided of Ammunition and Men. The Town is fituated upon a Hill, but in a Champan Countrey.

It is frequented by the Crim-Tartars, who bring thither all manner of Mer- chandife their Land afFoards, and not only the vendible Produfts of the Earth and Cattle , but as orderly their own Children , which they fell at a low rate j a Boy or a Girl of 16 years of age , for the valueof 20 Crowns a piece. The City Cafan is equally inhabited by Rujftans and Tartars and governed by a Deputy , as we have already faid, but the Cittadel kept folely by Ruffes where no is to come upon pain of Death. There is befides the Deputy (who is only as Prefident and fupremc in Civil Matters ) an extraordinary Ffaj- Tvode , who is always as Superintendant in time of War , having the fole Direction of Martial Affairs. ^The Countrey of which has been formerly a Kingdom , is ofa very wide extent j bounded on the North with on the Eafl; with Nagaya , and on the South with the River Wolga..

The Cuarin the mean while being informed by Exprefs that the Hoftility kept the Field,had put theForces under Conduct of the Vice-Roy to flight, and that they approached with a great Body, he levied as great an Army as he could do with fo fhort war ning, and ingaged with the Twtars in open Field. But the Hoftility increafihg more and more, what with their own Nation , and what with the Maleconte'nts within the Jurifdidion , were almoft 15 to 3 , and after a Ihort but very hot Battel the Empe- rour was lain to flee and betake himfelf to Novomod. The Tart in feeing themfelves Mafters of the Field , marched forward which they attacqued , took in and plundered. However the Cittadel Crernekm held ftoutly forth all the time, without making Propofals or Articles upon which they would feem willing to fur- render it , till at laft finding themfelves not in a capacity to hold forth they gave it over , upon very honourable Conditions as to themfelves, but difadvantageous Terms for the great Duke himfelf, and the City of (jMofcou.

The Cuftoms and Duties befides the Bartering of Commodities in this Citie is a confiderable Mr and profit for the Czaar. The Air about Ajirachan is very indifferent and Aftra^ tollerable as to it's Temperature, neither rendred unwholfom by the chan. fcorching heat of the Summer Solftice, nor in any cafe infufFerable for the penetrating Frofts in the Winter , as if this place had the benefit of two Climats. Hence is the Soil alfo very fertile and the Counrrey fructiferous beyond (Ihadalmoftfaid ) any other Coun- treyia eitherofthetemperate Zones, if the People and Inhabitants had but two Advantages in cultivating it, which tend mainly to the Improvement and maintenance of Agriculture , that is , an afTured conftant Peace , and the Myfteries of Husbandry which we have in theWeftermoftCountreys of E They have many and various kinds of fcleft Fruits , as Water-Lemmons , Oranges , Apples, Pears, Cherrys, Damzons, &amp;c.

The Nagayan-Tartars who for the moft part inhabit the Champan land about and near Ajirachan , are not permitted to dwell in the City; nor may they fortify their villages with Walls or Towers : only by many Intreaties they have obtained a Grant of fencing in their I ents with Stakes and Palizados, to fecure themfelves from the Affaults and) m Chap.

Melons I have bought 1 o or 13 for the value of a penny and other fruits after a conformable Price. Fifti and Flelh they have in better plenty than any where elfe I know in the World. For the value of 3 d I bought a huge Sturgeon, a Carp weighing 30 pounds, and 25 Herrings, greater and fatter than ever I have feen m Holland. Pearch , Pike , Bream and Sandaks are there fo plentifully taken , that only poore people eat them , of which a family of 8 Perfons may have as much as will fuffice them, for the va - lue of 3 farthings. The filh Sandach is a great Rarity , and proper only to the Ifolga , and fuch Rivers as run into it : being about the bignefs of a Haddock, andfomethinglikeitintaft, but much more delicate and fafter , if taken about Noyember and the 3 following Moneths.Their Beef and Mutton is exceeding good,fold ufually for a Farthing the pound. All kinds of Water-Fowl are very plentiful and cheap, efpecially a fort of Wild-gees and thofe we call Mofco- vy-Ducks which the T.artars take with Hawks , and bring them in fuch plenty to Market , that they may be had for a peny the dozen. The Tartars who live chiefly by Filhing and Fowling ufe alfo Hunt ing, and in feveral woody lilands about Afirachan take many Wild- fwine which are fed with Accorns, that being known for the bell mail that is, for Hogs.

To be brief, there is not that thing which may 165 9- delight the Pallet , but may be bad for a very mean and inconfide- rable price, and at a far eafier rate than the courfeft Diet which necef- fitated people muft be content with in the Weft of Europe and if any man of a mean Eftate could deny himfelf that Society of his Relations and Acquaintance in which every one has more or leis folace, and re tire thither, he may live as contentedly there as the greateft Lord, or richeft Merchant in the World, who, as it were in taking Honey are frequently ftung with the Bee , and in receiving Profperity and Benefits from the right hand of Fortune, are as often buffeted with her left. However by way of exception I muft mind you of one things that the Rupam are here at a great Lofs for Brandy,fmce the promulga tion of a Late Edift, the tenure and purport whereof was , That 'no Brandy fhould be diftilled there for a certain term of Years ; but upon what inlight it was that moved his Majefty to order fuch an Interdi ction I know not j unlefs to prevent the , or Soldatefqne, to forget themfelves fo far as to let the , which ly on every fide the City, to furprizethem with a fudden Invafion ; for Brandy is not only under a fpecial Interdiction of being made there , but alfo die Importation prohibited to a certain Quantity, every year,'which makes the Rupam the more to covet it, infomuch that fometimes they have drunk all the Kabacks and Brandy-cellars in dry before 3 Moneths of 12 be about. At Nifin-Novogorod we bought a meafure, holding about a Gallon for about ^sh. id Sierl which here when at cheapeft is fold for 5 o s Salt hv O n t ^ e W eft fide of the VFclga is a great dry and waft Heath called gotten, the Step , where they find abundance of good Salt ,. which is con creted in the Sun , and thrown up on Heaps like Ice. This Salt is digged out ofthe Hollows and Caves of Rocks , and proves a very rich Commodity, being exported afwell up the into all parts of Moftovia and Kupia , as Ferfix, Tart dry and other Coun- treys bordering upon the HpSea. Every man is licenf'd to fetch it that lifts, only allowing. Two pence half-penny for 80 Pound, for ditty to the Emperour. A firwe 1° this Heath, or Wildernefs, called the Step is a ftrange kind of hnd of Fruit found, named Baronez, , or , from the Word Boran, Ymt • which is a Lamb in the Rupap Tongue becaufe of its form and fimili- tude,'illli C hap.

This Skin is held in great efteem by the Tartars and and fold for a good price, as 1 have paid my fell fometimes 5 or 6 and doubled my money when I fold it again. One of thofe Skins is to be feen at the Houfe of Mr. JobaShammer dam in , a Gentleman famous for collection of the Rarities of Nature from every place of the VV orld : but that of his he had from a Seaman that- had been formerly a Slave in China where coming into a Wood y found of this Fruit, and brought away as many Skins as made him a Coat. The Defcription he gave of them, did very much agree with what the Inhabitants of Aftrachan informed me of them, ' it grows upon a low Stalk about 2 foot and a half high , fome higher , and is fupportcd juft at the Navel : the Head always hangs down as if it paftured, or fed, of the Grafs , and when the Grafs decays it periihes , but this I everlook'd upon as ridiculous , altho the Inha bitants affeverated to me by many Oaths, that they have often out of curiofity made experience ofthat, by cutting away the Grafs, upon which it inftantly fades away. However what I might further add as to what they lay of this Fruit, and what I my felf beleeve in the won- derfull Operations of a fecret Sympathy in nature, I fhall rather keep to my felf , than aver , or impofe upon the Reader , what, I am fenfible will be univerfally exploded for a Fable. Certain it is there is nothing which is more coveted by Wolves , than this , and the In ward parts of it are more congruous with the Anatomy of that Animal,, than Mandrakes are with Men. The tiagajan and Crm-Tartars are thick and corpulent , broad- fae'd , and litle-eied. The hies of the Men are wrinkled like old Wives. Their Beard grows very flovenly , here and there a hair, and lhave their Heads bare on the Crown; yet thefe are not altogether fa ougly as the Cdmucs. Their Habit is altogether as gentile as their Per- fons are comely , their upper veftment either of a very courfe ftufT with every thredasfine as a Tobacco-pipe , or elfe of Sheepskins' with the Wool-fide outward, their Caps and Hofeof the fame colonr r where they wear any,for they ufe as litle Rigging as they can.The Wo men like the Calmuccers wear a courfe linnen Coat and round Caos , bulging out like a Helmet. Their Firllborn Children are generally Z. 3 dedi-! 8z The V oyages of V o y.

In the Summer feafon they have no fall place, but pafture overall the face of the Countrey as we have faid of the Calmucs. When they march they carry their Tents upon high Wagons made on purpofe, andfo take their Wives and Children with them , and drive their Cattel before them, their Moveables they fet upon Camels , Horfes and fometimes upon Kine. Thus they go up and down all the Sum mer; and when the Winter approaches pitch together about appearing like a great Army &gt; where they can alllft each other in time of need againft the Cdrnucks their perpetual Enemies , who when the VVolga freezes fometimes aflail them : and to the end that they may the better oppofe their faid Enemies in fuch cafe, the , or Governour of ^Afirachm provides them Arms, which at the breaking up ofthe Camp they are to redeliver , and for fecurity fend fome of their chief Princes as a Pledge to Afir where they are committed to the Cittadel; and upon their reftoring of their Amunitionarefur- rendred into their hands again. The Tiagayans follow the Fiihing-trade, as alfo Fowling, Hunting and Pafturing of Cattel, and are reputed the belt Herds-men in the world. Their Kine are generally great, their Sheep very fair and fat, having great Tails like the Rams in fome weighing 20 or 30 pound a piece , their nofes bending upwards , and their Ears hanging like a Spanial Their Horfes are but ugly lhaped , but very durable in running. They have alfo fome Camels but not many. Their chief Diet is dried Filli which they ufe in ftead of Bread. They have alfo a way of making bread of Rice, which they knead in Oil and Honey , andfo bake it in Cakes. All kinds of Flefh they eat, ex cept Swine, holding Horfe-flefli for thebeft.

Their work is to watch the Ir- ikti ruption of the Tartars or other Enemies upon the Territories, of to They are called Cofacks from the SU word , which is as laiafe much as t6 fay a Spirit, by reafon of their admirable celerity of Mo tion, being always ready at hand upon occafion. The or Cofaks are thofe who live upon the famous River by the Natives called Don, and are properly under the Jurifdiction of the Czar , although more out oftheir free and voluntary difpofition ; for they have been indowed with many Priviledges, as to have their own Princes, Judges and Laws, asalfo a General of their Armie whom they themfelvesElect. Asalfo this Immunity that when a Mofcovjm Slave runs away from his Lord, and betakes himfelf within their Territories, they are not obliged to deliver him up unlefs themfelvs lift.Of this Peoplelaft mentioned was the famous Rebel! born.i §4 The Voyages of lohn Struys.

The firft occafion of this Revolt ( as himfelf confefled ) was to revenge his Brothers death, who was killed by an Eminent Perfonage, whofe name was lurte ^yilexoVuz. in the year 1665. The Brother of Rad^in was at that time in the fervice of tne great Duke in the Polish Warrs , under the command of the before mentioned Bojur, /une Dolgeroeky , who commanded in chief : and when the Camp broke up to go into their Garrifons, the young defired to be difcharged with his Men, having done the E mperour very good fervice in that laft Expedition , and that then there was no more occafion for their Aid : but the General refufed to let them go 3 as not having any certain Intelligence that the Hoftility were fent to their Winter-quarters. ThcCofaks were hereat greatly difcontented, being Volunteers, and had deferved yet greater Civilities than their Requefl:, or than ever they had received from the RufiUns they therefore marched offfilently led by their Collonel, brother to this faid StenkoRadzin , which was fo badly refented by the General, that he took the Collonel, and hanged him.This was the fum and ground of his revolting, which prompted him not only to imploy his Wea pons againft the Rufiuns, but afwell againft the Perfians. In the year 1667 he began to commit many Infolencies and himfelf and all his crew betaking themfelves to the where they took all the imall Shipping they met with, and plundered them , killed and threw over board all the Men , unlefs they would admitt them felves into their Companie : They entredalfo all the Towns feated near the River, where they pillaged the Churches and Monafteries. From hence he took his way direftly for which he took in and fet a ilrong Garrifon. From hence he marched toward the Sea gathering vaft multitudes of difcontented Ferfons 3 who came upon the noife of Rebellion from all parts. From the Sea he went for the VFolga by the way committing many Infolencies , plundering and finking all the fmall Shipping , wafting and depopulating of Cities and Villages , and uiing the People very inhumanly if they would not refolve to joyn in that Rebellion.

The lubtle Qofack not expefting fo gracious a tender, accepted oftheEmperours Grace, being already by Hun ger and other extremities brought to fuch a ftate, that he would of his own accord have requefted it, for they were then put to a fhort allowance, and had taken a Perjim having fome Horfes aboard that were fentto the Czaar , from the King of for a prefent- thefe they took, killed and ufed very fparingly , whence it may be gathered in what a mean condition they were. Having thus obtained an alTurance ofPardon from the Emperour , they marched forward for ^Jlrachan , where they were very kindly received, and congra tulated by thofeoftheTown, and everyone of them appearing in the moftfplendid manner he could, for they had rifled many Gentle- mens Houfes where they found always Apparrel, Jewels and other Plunder for Habit and Ornament.

Radzin being arrived to this Pitch of Greatnefs was fo puffed up as if he had conquered all the Empire ; tis true he refufed the Tide of Emperour, faying , that his purpofe was not to rule as Lord and Soveraign but to live with them as a Brother to revenge that Tyran- ny and Opprcfllons wliich They had for fo many years, and their Pro genitors for fo many ages paft.fuffered againft all Reafon and the Law of Nature.

The VFayivod Proforofski confidermg that the Commonaky were very much incenfed, and that lome mutinous Enterprize was a hatching , he aflembles the Lords and Council of to confult with their Judgments what was beft to be done in thofe imminent Dangers and J uncture of Affairs, and what Courfe they {hould take to fedate thofe Animofities and Heats , which ill-affected perfons indeavoured to raife and foment among the Towns-men and Plebeians; as alio what manner ofDefence to ufeagainft the approaching Enemy. As to the former they concluded , that there was no better way to remedy it, than to conduct themfelves wanly in the latter, and lirft obftruct the growing Power of the Rebells , which Perils being removed it might not then be doubted but that the Commons would be the better and foqner pacified. Upon thisRefolution feveral worthy Gentlemen prefented their Service to go as private Soldiers upon that fudden and urging Expedition, not daring any more to put the left Confi dence in the Snelit&amp;ers. Ontheio of April 1670 the Petrofski difpatched 800 Horfe under the Conduct of Col. whereof 400 were Rupans, the reft Nagayms, to furnilhtheCity ( lying about 80 German miles from y^A) with Ammunition and neceffary Provifion j and to ftrengthen that Place with thofe Men , which lies upon the River Den or T a where the have their Refidence, This River was of old fuppofed to run into the , as fome Geo graphers have been pleafed to write, but later experience has fairly contradifted that opinion , for their Boats which are no more than trunks of trees hollowed, they are fain to drag and trail a days J ourney over Land before they find the at the neareft diftance thofe Rivers ly to each other , where when they are come they ty heavy Balks on each fide to keep them above Water, and to give them a due ballance and poize in their floating, stanza On the 2 8 came an Exprefs to Csfftrachm from Col. witlj 'yll™ news that the Cofacks had already taken in Stanz,a. , and had killed 1200 Cofacks, Strelit^ers, who were but newly come thither before thepit® :h The Voyages of John Struys,- V oy .

But on the 4 of lune , by a Gentleman who had made his Efcape , they had notice of the Aftairs of Tzornojiir , that on the fame day that the Kiees Elboof made his appearance the Town was taken in, and that the Governour and Officers were all maffacred and their Bodies thrown into the River : and further, what was more deplorable, thePrivat Wil Soldatefque of Knees Elhoof had murthered aiF their Officers in the Fleet , declared themfelves tor the Cofacks , and furrendred all the Shipping into the Hands of Stenko Rad&amp; the grand Belweathcr , or Ringleader of the Rebells ; altho immediately before their coming at Tsornojar they had unanimoufly fworn, to live and dy with their Leaders. The Report of thefe things , altho the Governour indea- vored to fmother as much as was poffible , gave the Rabble greater Occafion to mutiny than they had before j yea , fo far they were induced , that they publicly reproached the Superiority that they durft not look out of their doors , or windows , much lefs walk the ftreets to confult together of means to remedy the diftemper of affiurs, to defend themfelves againfl; the Hoftility abroad , and to fupprefs inteftinjarrsat home, 'for it was no rare thing now to fee the Rabble affemble togethers in heaps, and before the Doors of the Magiftrates to cry out with infamous and bitter Railings , A ^ tv , , the times begin to alter, it Tw// he cur turn next to Lord it, you yourfehestothe World, &amp;c. , • j lliiin The Governour in the mean while loft no courage on his part, and the Gentry and Officers ftillcontinued under hopes of Affiftance from the Field Army, and new fuccour and Recruits from The Deputy therefore caufed all the Ordnance to be vifited and laden by the German Gunners , and gave orders to furniffi themfelves with neceflary Ammunition. However we could very well remark , that were the Officers never fo fedulous , they were never able both to defend themfelves from fuch a Power without , and be fecure for Mutiny within , ofwhich many Reafons were given to the and he as often forewarned by divers prudent Perfons.

In the mean while we heard continual News of the approaching of the Cofucks , to attacque Jjlrachm , which had it's inward ftate been in all things conformable to the iMuniments of that Town , they needed not fear loooooundifciplin'dmen as are the , for to fay no thing of the Ramparts and Fortifications of the Walls , there lay about four hundred and fixty great brafs Guns in the Battlements, be- fides,thofe of the Cittadel.

However it came fo far that Captain Butler began alfo to dread fome ill might befall us if we did not confult onr Safety betimes • he therefore upon a time called us all together , and uttered his mind in thefe , or the like words.

Our Captain advifed us not to take of our Company with us, Cr^and Trappen , beca ufe they had wives and children, and' confequently would both be a cumber for us, and uneafinefs for them- felves on fo dangerous a Voyage : but 1 having compallion with my neighbour Brak , I made him come aboard with his Wife and Child j but Trappen was not willing to leave Afirachan , imlefs he had been better furnifiied with Money than he was , or fomething elfe in lieu thereof.

Thus we ftaid waiting till the Gates were to, ftill expecting their coming, but midnight already come and no tidings of them we began to be in a hundred Fears : fome were of Opinion that the Captain was gone in a or fome other fmall Veifel with the other two Gentlemen that were with him , or that he was taken and fecu red : others were jealous that the Wife of Trappen hadbetray'd us.

In the mean while the Clouds began to rife, very thick at South-eaft which we thought did prefage ftorm , as at laft it broke out into a Thunder , wherefore we were forced to put in at a reedy Ifland , fo long as the Weather continued fo boyftrous. When the ftorm was over and the Sky began to clear up , we betook our felves to the Water and directed our courfe to the Southward ,• where beating along the Coaft we difco vered a fmall Boat which came diredly againft us and asked whither we intended j we told them , For thf Cafpian Sea.

After a few hours failing we got Oetsjoege , which is the chief place where the Fifh Biloeqe is taken,whereof Cavear is made, being far greater than a Sturgeon, but of the fame kind. The olgais here all laid in with Stakes, after the manner you fee in the Plate , thefe Stakes are fet in rows, wide at the Entrance fo that they can drive in the Fifh , which when once in they chace to the other end, where it runs up to a narrow angle, fo that (lis can neither get forward , nor yet turn about, but is eafily taken? When they have caught her they take out the Rows , which weighs ordina- - rily 300 or 400 lb. but the reft of the Fifh they commonly throw away , although fometimes they pickle it, and fend it to where it is held in reafonable good eftfcem.

This laft ftartled us not a little} however we refolved unanimoufly hap hazard to venture through, let what would follow , adjudging it equally £ife to run that peril, or to fuffer the Calamities we were liable to, and had in fome regard deferved : and in that refoktion continued failing till We found the Stakes or Pale-work foclofe in the Mouth of the River , that there was only a narrow Paflage to go through. About the end of the faid palfage we faw a Redoubt, which at a diftance feemed to bu very ftrongly fortified, which mainly increafed our rears , but greatly to our good luck we found no Watch but only a few Fifliers , who had no Authority , or warrant to examin,us , infomuch that we fteered boldly through; but confidering our Bread was almoft brought to an end, for we were brought to an Allowance of an ounce per we therefore turned back and prayed the Fifhermen to fupply us for our Moneys ; but they told us they had hardly enough to fuffice thefflfel- ves, whic hevery much diihcartned us, however they fupphed us with Fifli as much as wq had need of to ferve us over the Cafpian Meer ; On the i4wefet out and left the which there leaves it felt divided into feveralftreams or Heads like the (as before)making fo many feveral Iflands , which are low and full of Reeds , except only the Ifland SatyriBoggore , which is furrounded on every fide Wit high Cliffs.

However it was not int ^C hav .XVL The V oyages of lohn Struys zoi his intent or defign (in building of thefc Watch-houfes) only to be forewarned of any danger , but to prey upon the Merchant men, who were bound for i^ijlrachan. From hence to the Circas- Mountains we often founded and found it never more , orfeldomlefs than 12 toot Water. All along the Coaft wefaw abundance of Wild- geefe Pelicans and other Fowl which now and then we bellowed a litle powder upon. The ftrand was all grown over with Reeds, which grow to an incredible heighth, and the Water there we found deeper than off at Sea, in fomuch that it were very commodious, in a ftorm for any fmall veffel to Ihelter themfelves , dropping anchor a litle without, for the Reeds break of the Winds and the impetuous beatings of the Water. In the afternoon towards the Evening it began to thunder and rain very hard , the Wind was very high at South and by Eaft , and our Courfe lay South and by Weft, The Water all the time beat over the Gunhil, and two men forced to heave out with their Backlers , though hardly to any purpofe, for notwithftanding all the pains they took the Shallop was ftill full , the Tempeft continuing I'o till 5 in the next morning , at what time it began to grow very calm and moderate, yet not fo but that we were driven with a fine frelh Gale. The Water here is frelh and potable, and affoards all manner of Filh, that ufually breed in frefh Rivers , Pike, Carps, Breams, See. Befides Sturgeons, Seals and other crea tures that will endure both. On the 15 we loft the fight of Land, and came about midday into the Bay KiefeUrke , which is otherwife called the Golden the fand whereof Ihines as fire, and is therefore by fome called KifcUrfche hoeh , which is no other than Golden My curiofity was often to taft the Water j fometimesl found it laft of Sulfur , fometimes of Saltpeter, and fometimes of an od bitter taft , whence I collefted that this came from the property of the Ground and bottom. The River KifeUr is a Branch 3 or an Arm of the , rifing about 8 Vutch Leagues above Tcrki, and runs paralel with the V^olga about 65 leagues, fo disbanding its floods into the Ctfpun Sea. But now we were in a more defperate Condition than ever , partly for that our Shallop was fo loaden that we were not a foot above Water,and on the other hand Wanted bread &gt; for We had not above 6 or 7 pound among all the Company. The Wind began to grow high and boyftrous, and C c towards k^ v o Y .nr. juvb. towards the Evening we had a very rough Sea , every billow rifing 16704 Mountains high j infomuch that with continual pumping and laving we had much ado to keep the Shallop above Water , working feme times 4 or 5 together,and by taking turns relieved thofe that were wea ry every hour with frelh men. The next morning we couldfeeno land, but let all be left to the mercy of G O D. On the 16 we had aftiff gale, and failed before the Wind , which furthered us fo, that by noon we defcried Land : and foon after got light of a Ddgefian-T artais Barque, which we made up to, but when ( we came near it, it was run upon a Bank , and deferred of the Men, which upon our approaching them, jump'd over board. We percei ving that it was only for us that they left their Velfel, called out to them, and willed them freely to return and that we meant no harm ; Upon which they came back, and we pray'd them to furnifh us with fome bread for our Money, but they told us that they had not enough for their own Voyage however they gave us 6 litle Loaves, for which they would have no money, as alfo dried Pears and Plumbs which we thank fully received. This faid Bark was laden with Bales of Silk and bound for y^iflrachan , which when we underftood we gave them a Caution, and told them that we verily beleeved that by that time Afiruhm was in hand of the Cofiicks , and confequently we could not judge it fafe for them to proceed on their Journey thither. They thanked us for our Advice, and directed their Gourfe for Terky , that being alio a good Market. Weagreed among our felves to follow the likecourfe, with intent, atleaft, tofupply our want of Provifion, not knowing whether the Town was taken in by the Cofacks , or that it was ftill under the Emperour. About 9 in the Evening we anchored before the Town, and immediately upon our anchorage faw 10 or 12 Soldiers come rowing towards us, but when they came nigh faw that we were well armed, offered not to do any violent Act, but only asked us, Who we were ? and, From whence we came ?

They are very ambitious and emulating in ornaments , and are well trick'd up with Chains , Bracelets , Rings and other fine things, and thofe both of Gold, Silver, Pearl, Coral , &amp;c. which they become exceeding well. As I have already faid, they are very friendly and familiar with ftrangers, as appeared by their community with us. when as fomeofour men began to tickle and play with them, which they took all in good part , but H E that offered to be bolder paid leverely for it.

About half a day we marched with Mufkets and other heavy Armor upon our fhoulders, befides our baggage, along the fides of the Mountains, till at laft we came into aValley where we were efpied by a Company of Troopers, being about 15 or 16.

We therefore upon their approachment freely furrendred our felves into their hands and implored their Mercy after the beft manner, \Zmh- -and with all the ligns we could.

Thcfe Torments I endured with incredi ble patience j not willing to deteft my Countreymen, Torments, I fay, that none without experience could be able to imagine how great. When they infilled hard that i ihould tell them which way they went , I told them that they went toward the Hilly Countrey ., altholwas certain on the contrary for they had determined to go along the Ri ver , that they might have their flicker in the Woods. After they had ufed us fo inhumanly and out of hopes of getting any thing from us , they took me and ElsPteterjz. , tied us legg to legg with a fmall Iron Chain, and fo brought us up to the Prince O/min, often threat- ning that they would tear us limb from limb, fuftaining that Opi nion of us that we were of Stephen Company , andfentout as Emmiffaries on his behalf, and therefore were refoived that his Infolencies fliould be lay to our charge. When I underftood that their Opinion and Intentions were fuch, I was in a great confter- aation , not that I was affraid of Death (for that was what I chiefly longed for, at that time) but that we were liable to fuchabadCen- fure , and could not explain our felves fo well, as to fatisfy them to the contrary: and beiides all that to be kept alive and fuffer fo many Tortures as they threatned us, to dcteft what we were utterly ignorant of, and unable to fatisfy them in.

But on the top of the Hill, it was yet more calm , where as none can remember that the Air there did ever change, or was fubjed either to Wind or Rain, which is prefumed to be the reafon that the'Ark has endured fo long without being rotten. Going into the Hermites Cell, I took a view of the Rupture, which I faw was Ihut forth about the bulk of a henns-eggj and with one afked him. How long he had had it? he anlwered, A Moneth : which gave me good encouragement, fmce I was fure that the Fiifure was frefh, and therefore the Cure with greater facility to be effeded.

Rupture which he with his own hands had indeavoured to flop, by thrufting it in &gt; and as often broke out &gt; was now ftay'd j and he told me that he could every day perceiv that it grew better. I gave him advice to keep himfelf a whole year intheTrufs, and continue anoynting himfelf after the manner 1 did my felf, which he alfo pro- mifed to obferv. When I took my leav of him, he gave me a piece of hard wood, of a dark-red colour j with a Crofs 3 and a filver Chain which he wore about his neck, as alfo a Stone, which he told me he had taken from under the Ark; Thefe Reli£ts he adjured me to be very carefull of, faying the' real value and efteem thereof would be fuch, that if ever I came to Rom , and bellowed them on St. Peters Church that they would reward me with a Gift which ihould ferve me for a maintenance fo long as I lived.

SO foon as I was arrived at UrTv and entred the Hcufe of my Patron cMebemct , he gave order tofecureme with 2 Chains, for he feared that I would make my efcape, by running into the Jurisdiction. One of thefe Chains was light and tolerable, but the other very ma fly and ponderous, infomuch that to bear the Chain alone, might feem to be Slavery enough. This Condition brought me into a deep Melancholy, even to death, not only that I should be come a Slave, but that my Patrons Incredulity should be the occa- fion of fuch Affliction to xiie, as alfo that he should fo much vio late his Word, when having promifed to let me go free again, on condition he received that money upon my ellectingthe Cure, which the Heremite caufed to be honeftly paid &gt; for had I not trufted to that his promife, I should have prevailed with the Heremite fo far as to purchafe my liberty, fince the Slave-market is there very low.

Shortly after he fent 2 fair Girls , who at firft entrance'faluted me very friendly , and begin ning with a trifling difcourfe , they proceeded on to more ferious matters, and confequently proffered themfelves to me as Wives, making ufe of a Rtipan Slave to be their Interpreter: and to make their requeft prove the more effectual, they began to ftroak me, and play a hundred wanton tricks to allure me , which when I perceiv ed , pray'd them to dellft and not to trouble me any longer , for it was againft my Confcience to violate the Laws of Chriftianity, which forbid Polygamy , having already a Wife by whom I had two Children , and although I were in the moft remote parts of the World, I Ihould not alienate my Love and Troth, by mar rying of another fo long as Ihe was alive. To this they made an- fwer, That I fliould never fee either my own Coantrey or Rela tions again , and that many thoufands would be glad of what was proffered me, and therefore willed me to accept of it, left: I Ihould afterwards repent when it could not be revoked, See. After they had ufeda few fuch like Arguments they left me. Hardly were they got out but my Patron came in , who fell to work again with greater, and more fpecious promifes than before, as. That if I would be- come a Mufulmm [or True Beleever] he would advance me to the Dignity of a Commander in the Guards. This perplexed me very much when I faw him fo earneft, thinking that if lie could not |cfe get his will by fair means, he would proceed to rigour, and being abfolute Lord and Soveraign , as well of the Countrcy, as of my Perfon, would force me to embrace the iMdumetm Religion, how ever I had already flood out fo much Torture, that being a lide hardned to it I feared it fo much the lefs : but gave him a Ihort E e 2.

He hearing me fay fo did not for that timeprefs me much more. On the 9 tl1 ' dito I continued ftill in Chains, at what time the young Damofels that had been with me beforej were fent again, who, as they did the laft time, endeavoured to perfwade me to turn Mahometan, neither did they dcliii to ufe all manner of Allurements they could devife, to entice me toly with them, for fo they thought that if 1 had done that, I muft either become Turk, or dy a mi- ferable Death; They further did what they could to put me in mind of my prefent mifery, and told me that 1 muft never expeft to en joy any better than what I faw before my eies ; and in the conclu- llon of all, told me that they wondred at the Folly and Vanity of the Chriftians who were fo ftri£tly tied to Monogamy, or only to marry one Wife , when as the Mahometans might have as many as they lifted, or thought themfelves capable to maintain. My Mafter altho he was a Prince yet thought it nodilhonour to trade in Commerce: but the chief thing he had whidi brought him up the moft Revenues , were the Baths which he kept ; having fom almoft in every City, as wellinhisownJurifdi&amp;ionasinPtr/fo and other Countreys, whereof thofe were the moft confiderable, at Derbent y at Scam achy, and at which brought himinavaft fum of Money yearly. The reafon why the Baths are there in fuch efteem , and fo much frequented by perfons of all Ranks and Degrees, is not on ly their aftecled Cleanlinefs , in which they furpafs all others: but as well thro Superftition: for that after the ufe of their Wives , they are to bath, being till then reputed unclean, and may not enter the Mofques: and this both fexes are injoyned to upon fuch Cafes by the K^Alcoran.A man among them may not ly with his wife from Conception to her Delivery: which is probably inftituted as a Pre cept in the Alchoran to make thofe Countreys more populous for fo one Man is capable of generating many Children in one year. The Baths are frequented from Break of day to the Setting of the Sun. From morning till noon the Men bath, and from noon fill night the Women, fo taking it by Turns. On% Cha p .

I did , and if I had taken good Courage : I anfwered him that I had no great occafion to thank him for my Welfare, fmce he did all he could to make me miferable , and contrary to that Honefty and Truth, which the lurks boafted of, he had fliown me an odd example ; Withall telling him that he had little rea- fon to chain me fo fall, and make my Slavery the greater when as he had promifed me my Freedom , upon the receipt of the Money which was paid him. Upon this he feemed to be a little moved to compaflion and commanded that the greater Chain Ihould be taken off: Now when I obferved that my rea- foning had a litle prevalency with him I purfued on in my Argument, with thefe, or the like Words, Sir, that I am your SUye ?

This I couldperceiv wrought in him no fmall change, for he was naturally very covetous,, and would have loft the price of a Slave. Befides that, it is a Maxim of their Law, that if any perfon do any way murther himfelf, the Houfe is to be accurfed and pulled down to the Ground. My Patron confidering what the IlTue of this might be , altho I had not the left thoughts to lay violent hands upon my felf. he therefore to prevent the worft fold me to one Hadfy ^Mahomet SaU , a TerfiAn for 25 Ahhas , that was about 30 Shillings fieri, which is but a fmall fum in comparifon to the ordinary Market price of , and other places in Barbary. My new Patron fpoke the Tongue very well , by which means we came to underftandone another the better: for he ufed me more kindly than the other , and would of ten bid me have courage, faying,he would go with me to where there were many English , Dutch and other and probably thofe that would buy me off his hands , and fo fet me at Liber ty again, which gave me no fmall encouragement to do my utmoft to pleafe him.

Upon a time, when thefe People lived in the Countrey, it happened that the Tarurs made an irruption mto PoU and among many others carried away my faid Patroneffe, being then a Damofel of 12 years old, and fold her for a Slave. She was a Gentlewoman ofa very fair com plexion , and a well proportioned Body at that time, for which reafort alone (Ifuppofe) my Patron bought her and made her his.

It was no fmall caufe of Joy to me that things fell fo well out , as that he lived to de clare the true caufe of' this difmal accident : whereas if he had died , 't would certainly have coll me my Life, among thofe brui- tifli, furious and unreafonablc People, efpecially in conlideratkm of of the Condition I was in, not only a Stranger both to their Re- ligion and Manners as well as their Coimtrey and Perfons 3 but likewifea Slave, for whofe Death and Slaughter a man is no more accountable than for the flender Value and Market price &gt; whilft on the contrary it fell out that 1 got the Credit of faving his Life, and his Benevolence ever after for an aft of fuch merit, having run the jeopardy of my own Perfon.

So foon as I underftood that P. and were arri ved at Derient I pray'd my Patron to let me go to vifit them, which he granted.

All the Company went into the Wood , and fell to work leaving me alone to look to the Carts and Provifion. After they had. been about 3 hours at work , I efpied a. Troop of about 300 Men coming towards us, and thinking by the haft they made towards us, that they were Robbers , I therefore called out to them ins the Wood, to give them Notice that tliey might keep together.. When I faw them come within Bow-ihot of me I ran away as fall as I could drive, which they feeing me, fentaShaft or two, but they did not hit me. Having entred the Wood I met our Company coming out, who at fir ft ftoutly refilled, but- finding that the Robbers fell on with a greater violence, and exceeded us both for Arms and Number of Men, they thought good to re treat with as much haft as they could. We left here 12 dead, a— mongft which was a Polish Renegado ; befides thefe that were kil led we had 20 wounded , and loft all our Baggage , with Carts,, Oxen, AiTes, See. and were fain to return fo home.

And by rcaion thole of muft have all their Fewel and Timljer from this Place, and the work put upon the Slaves, it happens that every year a great number of thofe miferable fort of men are either difpatched or wounded. The next day I was fent up into the Countrey to a place where my Eatron kept his Cattle , which I was to look after and drive rhe mi - them up and down where I found the beft Pafturage.

Thefe therefore releafed me and retook the Beafts, fo that I came fafe home; for which kindnefs my Mafter gave them a Prefent , I fuppofe , of more value than what I was fold for to him. Unfpeakable was the kindnefs of my Pa tron that he had for me, for altho my Work was a litle fervile and Slavifli, yet my Bed and Table was Lordly; and whatfoever I did whether well or ill, he always took it in good pa-rt, and would after that time , never fufter me to go abroad to do any work, faying, that he beleeved that I was born under fom malevolent Planet. To be brief I found my daily Tafk fo eafy, and my ufage fo comfor table, that were it not for the name ofa Slave and that to a M.thwne- tan , I could not have lived better abroad in any Place of the W odd, having litle or no care upon my head. rkh About this time my Patron made preparation to take a Journey iTscl- ^ cr Scamachy , there to repair his Houfes which were thrown down ituchy. with an Earth-quake in the year 1667.

Nearthis place are alfo two great Warehoufes having feveral Portics or Alleys, where all Merchants-ftrangers buy and fell feveral forts of Merchan dizes.

The Commilfioners had Order from the King, to complete the number of 5 00 of the beft featured, com- plexioned and ihaped Virgins that were to be found in all the whole Mufter. The manner of it is thus j Some time before, the King iffues a Mandate , which is publifhed thro every Province of his Realm and Dominions , That all the young Maids from 2 to 17 years [if there be any of that age] (hall be drawn up to their refpectiv Metropolitans, or Chief Towns (as thefe in Media., were brought to Scamach-f) where the Kings Commillioners fhall make choice on the Kings behalf. This Mandate is duly and with all reverence obey'd by the Parents of fuch Children, who, if they have but one Child are obliged upon pain of Death to bring her to the Place ap pointed , where thefaid Commifiloners are to view and cenfure them if they be worthy to be culled out for the Ki ngs ufc.

But no fooner did the old Gentleman hear of the Man date but he fent for the Youth, and not only gave him his Daughter for his Bride but made him in Poft-haft to bed with her, thadbhe might jupamentally declare (lie was no Virgin. The Youngmandid nor defire many Moneths to deliberate the bufinefs , but fuddenly accepted of his Offer , and fo anticipated the King. Yet this did not altogether excufe them, for it was not fo univerfally known but that fom Pick-thank Neighbour thinking that the Gentleman con- cealed his Daughter to efcape theCenfore, went and informed the Commiflioners^ that fuch a Virgin was not brought to the Teft, beinp a sreat Beauty and well bodied.

After 1 had consulted all means 3 I concluded it my beft way to difpatch Letters to fom of my own Nation, and accordingly lent one to the Confulat Smjrnn , and another to the Sieur' xJ^at , humbly en treating them to fend them forward for with one acquainting them that I was in Slavery at Scanuchy 5 and could not fend any Letter with fafety and conveniency thro ijh which was the reafon. of my being fo importunate, as to direct them that way. On the 9 th ' we had very tempeftuous Weather , high and imp^ tuous Winds, mixed with Thunder and Lightning, fo that all fhaked again. On this day went all the Woman to the Sepukhers of their deceafed Friends, to perform the cuftomary Rites. The next day was a great Fcftival , or Holy day among them , which was folemnized with Beating of Kettle r drums , found of Trumpets, and Flaying on all forts of loud Wind-Mufic.

The. Prince having under- ftood the fum of their Inftructions , caufed immediatly Three of thole to be beheaded, and their Bodies to be thrown to the Eagles and Ravens.

I have already made mention, how that about 2 years before, had difpatched 7 Ambafladors to the Court at ifpahan defiring a Supply of Men and Ammunition, as alfo to enter into a League with the King: butbyreafon the Cofa had plundered bath and Lenkerm , and committed many infolent Outrages within his Majefties Territories) and that Rad&amp;tn was not by any acknow ledged as a Soveraign Prince, his AmbalTadors found a very unkind Reception at Court, and meeting with fome menacing Sentences in their Inftructions , the King caufed their Heads to be fevered from their Bodies, referving only one to bring back the Tidings, who was upon his delivery of the Meffage ordered by Rd^tn himfelfto be chop'd into Gobbets, as may be read more at large in 192 , 193. So that I held it ftrange that would affumethe freedom to fend any more Legates, without other Ground of Hope, On the 25 was a Per /Ian of reputed Sanctity murthered by a fian aim after a very bafe degenerate manner. The Murtherer was forth- wmher. with apprehended and brought before the Prince , where he was ^ accufed of the Fact , and confequently delivered to the neareft Allies of the Patient to ufe at their difcretion, as is cuftomary in Perfi* ■. for rarely it happens that either the King , 1 mice, Deputie or the Civil Magiftracy take notice of fuch delinquencies, but turn over the Malefaftor to the aggrieved Parties, whoittney be Poor oftentimes fell their Vengeance for Money , after which the Law is filent: but here the Delinquent had not that fortune, for, the Brother of the Murthered Party had neither Poverty nor Mercy , but fo foon as permiflion was granted him , he caule two Men to hold him down till he had ftabbed him with the lame Weapon , faying , Get thee hen, , Tvhom thoubelongtft ; for the was a drunken Fellow , and executed in the fame fit of Drunknefs wherein he had fo far miftake himfelf, fo that the Murther, Complaint and Execution wexe a done in the fpace of three Hours. jj ' ^ On the 3 of May fell out a dolefull Tragedy at a Wedding, where pttinf- w hen all the Company were in the middeft of their mirth, an fage atk - - jjIlClv' 1C hap .

Immediatly upon this all was in a lamentable cafe : The Bride grooms Mother was fo impatient and concern'd that Ihe took a Knife and ript up her own Belly , that all her Bowels gullied out, and ihe fell to the Ground. The Sifter feeing this , ran out of Doors as one diftraded , tearing her Hair and rending her Flefli , that many wondred to think how a young Woman of that tendernels could fo mangle and abufe her Body, and at laft ran up to thetopofafteep Rock, whence fhe threw her felf precipitantiy; fo that this fair Mor ning had a foul Evening , and thefe Nuptial, Solemnities which began with a Comedy, concluded with a deep Tragcedy.

The Hail did much damage to the Fruk, every Hailftone beingof anmnufoal bignefsfonras-large as the Egg of a H en or Turky. On th© 6 of June I went with a Vencti.m (who had bin a Slave in Turk find run away) about 15 Miles w: thin Land, where we found oa -Armenian Friary. The Monaftics received arrd treated us very kindly, when they underftood that wa were Ghriftians , and m Slavery to the ■■jMn.hometms. They intreated us to tell them all the paf- fages we had met with abroad, which the Venemn fir ft did, andafrer- wards deilringme to do the like, I related all in brief, which they - took great delight to hear &gt; efpecially about the taking in of Ajlruh'm.

All the time thev careffed'us with all kmdnefs imaginable , neither i paring for Victuals nor good: Drink: profeiling themfelvsforry that our con- ' dition would not allow them the happinefsofalongcrenjoymenrof our Company.

Right loath we were to leav them, but riotrda?iag to flay any longer , we took our leavs of them ,- thanking them for their kindnefs and civility they had fhown us. In taking our way to we were fain to climb over fome Hills, and one great Mountain flat at Top, upon which was a Lake, according to our gueffing, 3 miles in Circuit.;Going along the fhore to our great amazement we found four Bodies of Men that had but newly been mufthered , having their throats'cut, we illp- pofed them' to be Anglers, feeing Filhing Canes and other Imple ments about them.' However, we thinking it for two reafons unfafe for us. to ftay there any longer , made all the hail we'could to gee out' LI 3 offThe Voyages of V oy. Ill J uxe. of theway. This Lake as we afterwards underftood was very plen- J671. tifull of many kinds of delicate Fifh, which are fold very dear and highly efteemed of abroad throughout all that part of the Countreyj and indeed it was once our thoughts to make a T rial if we could take any thing, till meeting with thefe new murthered Perfons , we chufed rather to let the Fifh remain in their Element than by the probable confequence to pay too great a price for our fport. On the 9 happened a very Tragical paffageat Scamachy , which, notwithftanding the horrible fpeftacle 1 had feen the Day before, made my Heart beat withrn my Breaft, as it did many times after that, when it came into my mind. A Woman and a Slave was taken by a Perjian for his Wife. Whether ihe had fom private Quarrel with him, or that Ihe was confcious of fom misbehaviour to him I cannot determine, however fhe came to my Patron the Poltfh Ambaflador, firft making a large Demonftration of her State, and of her Friends and Family in Poland, fhe requeftcd that my Lord would vouchfafe her his Protection, till Inch time as fhe could meet with an oppor tunity to convey her felf clandeftinly home into her own Countrey, My Lord , at the earneft intreaty of fom Domeftics who were his Minions, alien ted: but after fhe had fo privily held her felf about the fpace of 14 days, her Husband got Intelligence by fom Pick-thank or other, where fhe was, applies himfelf immediatly to Court, where Rafter a lide foliciting) he gets an Order to fetch her out, and ufe her as feemed good to him. But confidering that the Domeftics of my Lord were too numerous and a little unruly, he durft not attempt to make the demand, but went back again to Couct defiring Aili- ftance upon which the Prince fent fom of his, Officers , who when our People faw that they were com in a warrantable way, durft not oppofe them, nor had they any conveniency to put her out of the way, fo that Ihe was forthwith delivered into the hand of her Huf- band. The Man having as was faid permiffion to punifh her at his own Dilcretion had already provided a Wooden Crofs , upon which, with the help of his Servants, he bound her faft, being mother naked, and with his own hands flea'd her whilft yet living. Iftood my felf all the while at the Door with a great Company of Men, Women and Children , and heard her cry out moft bitterly. Yet none thought that his cruelty was of fo high a nature till we law the Car-C hap. XXV■ The Voyages of lohn Stmys.

It is a plain Proverb, notfo common as true. The Old Woman hadnotf had/he never bin there her felf: and fo the Men in Perfu , or at left about thefe Parts, being generally prone to Venery 3 and without the bounds of Continency, harbour and fuftain an ill Opinion of their Wives , ' he Pcr ' whom they will have to be chaft and loyal. This Jealoufy is therea- ^ fon that few who covet a good name and would be reputed honeft go with any part of their bodies uncovered, fave only their Eies, their Face being muffled up in Silks or Cotton. Thofe who go with un covered Heads ,are fuch as we commonly call Gamefters , andpro- ftitute. So foon as any one comes in a doors, the Woman runs into a Chamber and locks her felf up that flie may not befeen , althdthe Slaves have often the Opportunity to violate their Mailers Couch notwithftanding all the Indeavours they ufe to fupprefs them. But the King and the Great ones of the Realm prevent that by gelding their Slaves &gt; which they doe veryeffeftually, but Mo defty forbids me to make further mention of the Manner. They do it commonly when they are young , buying Children that are ftollen from their Parents , and are therefore m regard of their bringing up, held in greater value than others , as alio becaule that there' is hardly one in three that both live and like. The price which is fet upon them is one reafon why ordinary Ferfons have them not, and another is becaufe that if they thrive they grow very fat and lazy, and confe- quently unfit to do any fervice they have occafion for. And by rea fon that Women-Slaves are fomewhat rare among them , the Mer chants and Citizens Wives are moftly attended by Men, who if they have a Iprightly and airy way and Carriage, arefomtimesadmitted to enjoy thofe illicit Pleafures, which in procefs of time they recom- ^ pence with the lofs of their Lives.

Having ftaid one night at K , we fet forward and about 8 a clock the next evening came to a fair Village called or, Tza'toatias fome call it, which is fo much as to fay, aThorow-fare; becaufe that here is the Paffage which brings over the grand River praxes, and here every one is-to fhow his Pafport, out of fear that fome Turks iliould flip over with the of whom the Verftm is alwaies jealous, and'are eonftrained to take fliarp notice of every particular Perfon.

On the 3 of Noyember we travailed 5 leagues over the Heath of Mochan, and faw by the way many Hurdles and Boors Cottages, but durft not call at any to provide our felvs with Refreihments , being fenfibie of the penis, for hither are all thofefent to Exile whom the Such thinks good to banifli, and hither refort all the Mutineers j fo that thefe like the Bmdttii in the Alps render the way very unfafe and incommodous to travel, fomtimes furprizing and a flailing the Cur ay an s , when they find themfelvs of Force enough, or the too weak to withftand'em.

All along the Banks we faw holes and caves which thofe Animals had made in the Sand , the Ihoar appearing like a Coney-borrough. Thefc Caves have their mouth or entrance alwaies to the Southward , where they lay their Eggs. On the Countrey through which this Ri ver foftly glides we faw feveral Cottages or Tents, as we did the day before, but found the Inhabitants harmlefsand very poor, yetmer- ryandjocund, the Children were ftarknakedjand the Men and Wo man had hardly cloaths enough to cover their middle. They received us in very friendly manner according to their ability, bringing us Milk for our felvs, and Provender for the Camelsand Horfes, which they fold at a very mean and inconfiderable Price, confidering under what neceifity we were then. This day we travailed 6 [Dutch] Leagues. On the 5 we travailed about as far as we did the day before, but were fain to take up our Lodging under the great Canopy ot Heaven, fetting down with the whole Car ay an, near fom Water-pitts, where we found good pafturage for the Beafts , confidenng the feafon of the year. The next day we found an end of the Heath Mekm , and had High-land to travail over, as the Mountains of Bethz,jryan, or Beth- z-jrum. This day we croffed a fmall River (if 1 well remember} 12 times, having a crooked or ferpentine Courfe, which the Merchants N n 2 of■td Hi 284 The Voyages oilohn Strujs. V O Y.

At night we got the Village Schcchmurat , where my Patron fent me out to fetch fom Spring-Water : but being about half an [_Englifh] mile without the Town was aflail'd by 3 Robbers , who fuddenly came running out upon me , having their Eies fixed my Armor &gt; fo that in all probability, that which I had for my De fence would have been my Death, if fombelongingto the Caravan and fent upon the fame Errand, had not com in time to afllft me j for I was almoft out of breath with defending my felf, having my Back againft the Ruins of an old Wall, which feemed to be the Relicts of fom Watch-Tower. One of the 3 I had wounded very fore on the Arm, but the other two breaking in proved too ftrong for me; yet when they fay the reft com in and clofe up with them, thought it better to make ufe of their Heels than their Hands. On the 7 th - we travailed over very hilly and montanous Ground, encamping that night in a Valley, which was waft, anddeftituteof Inhabitants. Qn the S xh - we came to a very fair andcommodious built at the Charges of the Indian Traders, for the conveniency of their Caravans : Here we intended to remain over night, but begin ning to take our Reft, were alarm'd upon a fudden affault of a great Troop of Robbers , who fell upon the on every fide, and plundered all they came at, that was of any value and portable; and altho we had timely notice to defend our felvs, yet they had got a con fiderable Booty, and made their efcape without thelofsofanyPer- fon or the left damage. Wetherelorefearingthattheincouragement and fuecefs they had met with might embolden them to make up a ftronger Troop , and confequently our tarrying there might be very unfafe, it was unanimoufly concluded that we fhould break up, and being fair Weather, purfueourjourney by travailing the night, as we did, and about 12a clock came to , which is a beautiful Town, but not fortified, where it was thought fit that we Ihould ft ay till the next morning: Tz&gt;mle is a Paradife in regard oi it's pleaiant Situation ; round about which is nothing to be feen, but Orchards, Gardens and Houfes of Recreation.

Near the Village Samim is a very famous Bridge, all of Stone, computed to be 45 o Foot long, and withall very broad. This Bridge we paifed over, and towards night came to Trakdar a Village ^'idge. feated in a plealant Landihip , where we took up our Nights-lod ging, but not our Nights-reft, for we were horribly tormented with Fleas and Lice, that being (as in Scotla/id) the Countrey-Plague, Lice and which I prefume comes from the Heat of the Cows-dung, that the Inhabitants dry and ftow up in their Houfes , to ufe forFc- wel. The next day we broke up, and went thro the Town Kelcherd,. which is about -half an hours walking from t^frdebil., where is the ao- ble Maufoleum , or Sepulchre of Zide Tza , the Father of phy. This T&amp;ayhrail was in his life time a man ofa mean and flender Fortune, as well in Subftance as Parts, but Sedredm lus Grandchild willing to make him coequal with his Father in the Calender, caufed all his Bones to be gathered together and brought to this Shrine, which was ereded to his perpetual Memory. The Time alfo built that moft fumptuous Mefchaich , or Sepulchre within Jrdtbii, for Scech Sephy his Father. Certainly thofe Bones of his Grandfather muft have bin very emphatical and notedly eminent above all the Boors and Pe- fants Bones that had lay there ahund red years, that could now, al- moft reduced to Duft, be diftinguifhed from the reft: otherwife, thrice happy were his Neighbours who had kept him company fo long a time, for it was hard if fome Joynt or other was not canonized with the Anatomy of this Holy T^erhad.

Thofe Mountainsjas they told me,which ly to the Weft ward, are all the Sum mer covered with Snowj but on the other fide,thofe that lie toward the Countrey ofKielan , the Air is more moderate and not altogether fo cold. And by reafon that theie cold feafons do not come gradually as -when the Winter Solftice approaches, but cafually, and all on a fudden fo that there is no ordinal Viciffitude, nor can be any faft Calculation made, it renders the Place very unhealthy, efpecially to Strangers, who are not ufed to fuch fudden Changes. However, 1 would not be fo far mifconftr'd, as to fignify that there is no fenfible difference be tween the Summer and Winter, for the Courfeof the Sun makes a noted alteration, and yet the Summer Colds feerningly morepene- tratingthan thofein the Winter, for Now the Body is fhut, and Then it is open, at what rime they hold it more dangerous, but in the Ap- proachment of the Winter more tolerable and better to be endured. My Patron told me that fom years before he took this Journey about , taking with him,4 Slaves, whereof 3 were Strangers and unnacuftomed to the aforeiaid Changes, died in this Place, but the other which had been brought up there abouts, ail'd nothing at all.

In this part of 'the Coun- ^ , trey is alfo very good Pafturage, which is no fmall-Profit: to the tE Schach, or King, who has impofed a Toll of Four pence half^ penny for every Sheep, great and fmall, that paffes the Bridgeth^. which by reafon of the vaft Flocks and great Inclination of the People to bring up Cattel brings up yearly an incredible fumof Money.

One of thok faid Comiffio- ners, being an old Acquaintance of my Patron , told him that when they turned over the Accounts they had found Toll taken for a- bove 700000 Sheep, between Uy/arch and September, which amounts, to more then 26000 Ik.

A little before we came at thofe Wells, we fmelled a ilrongfmellofBrim- ftone, and heard the Water bubble up and boil.

Among the Slaves that my Pa tron had was an old Greek, for whom he had a great kind nefs, and efed him more like a Brother than a Servant.

Every Man has his freedom to walk and recreate himfelf, but upon a very ftrift penalty not to pluck either Flower or Fruit. I was told how that 5 years before my being there, a drunken Perfian had hewn down a great bough with his Scymiter , but being taken was immediatly beheaded with the fame Weapon. In this Gate hung alfo another great Silver Chain, which was given by the Chan of Kentz Here they demanded our Weapons , which being delivered, ray Patron went forward to another Gate, which entring he fell down and kilfed the Threlhold , withall charging me not to touch it with my Feet, left I Ihould pollute that which many thought worthy a long Pilgrimage to com and kifs: he told me alfo that it was a favour greater than ordinary , that I being a blind ignorant Chriftian and an Infidel Ihould be admitted to pry into fo glorious a Sanduary.

The iiext Place we came into was a ftately Gallery, or rather an Antichamber, arched crofs wife, and neatly plaiftered. On the right hand as I went in was a great Silver Cock which ran with Water that was conveyed thither by leaden Pipes from a fair Fountain about 4 [Engltjh~\ miles without Town. Right over againft this is another Apartment paved with green.and blew glazed ftones: and on the Floor was fpread a very rich Caj-pet: in the middle 1 ftood two huge Silver Candlefticks about 8 or 9 Foot high &gt; round about were Seats as in our Chores, wherein fat feveral Priefts all in white Stoles, who fung all the time, keeping good Harmony,, and at the End of every Verficle. bowed allalike , one,to another.

The Parlour, or Hall into which we now came was all paved and laid in with a fplecked Stone; The Building its felf was round , like a Theatre j the Doors were laid over with Silver Plates and had two great Silver Rings like Wreaths , or Torfes. At the Entrance lay a coftly and large Carpet, where we were to pull off our Boots, without which, none is admitted to ' go in, nonottheKinghimfelf, who fomtimes to be a Precedent and Example of Zeal, pulls off his Boots at the firft Gate, but that, it feems, is held to be a Work of Supererogation. From hence we went to another Magnificent Hall, thro a Gallery, the Pavement where of was covered with rich Tapeftry. The Doors of this faid Hall were covered with Plates of Gold, which was don at the Charges of the Schachi^has , who had made a vow to do it, incafe he returned home with Triumph, when he went on an Expedition againft the Vfheques in chorafan , as he did, and vanquifhed the Rebels. This Hall is not fo fpacious as beautifull by far, the Roof being no more than 48 Foot long,and 30 broad. In the middle hung feveral Gold and Silver Lamps, and on each fide fate 12 Priefts, each having a low Stool before him, on which lay fo many Parchment Books , containing feveral Legends of the richer an , which they read and fung by Turns. Leaving this Place we went into another which was feparated and environed with Silver Rails, and had 3 Afcents or Steps to go up of folid Silver. This is the laft and chief Oratory, or Houfe of Prayer, where our Tatron pray'd with very great Zeal. From hence we afcended into another Place, which was one Step higher, and feparated with mafly Grate-work all of pure Gold and wreathed , behind this was the Tomb of Schach Sephy , which was of fair Marble, being about 3 Foot high, 9 Foot long and 4, broad. It was covered with a Carpet ot Crimfon Velvet , richly embroidered and laid in with precious Stones. Above hung feveral Lamps, and on each fide 2 huge Candle- fticks, all of folid Gold: thefe are lighted every Evening and burn all the Night long. The Door of this Place is opened for no Secular or Temporal Perfon or Perfonage, nor for the King himfelf. Near this Tomb we faw alfo the Tombs of of and of fom Queens, all which were only fupplyed with Curtains, and void of curious Work and Ornament. Leaving the Sepulchre we went out at a door on the Right Hand, that led into the Library whichChap. XXVIII. The Voyages of which was very fpacious, yet without any Pillar.

In this laid Library were feveral lefs Appartments, where were many PorcelineDiflies, Cups and other Utenfils, for the Kitchin and Table, which are ufed when the King or any other great Perfonage comes to Eat there, whereas they fay it is not confiftent with the Humility they profefs, to befervedin Gold or Silver: the more becaufe that the great himfelf •did eat altogether out of Wooden Dj flies. From hence we went out and came into the Kitchin, the Doors whereof were covered with Silver Leavs by the aforefaid Schach^Jbas and the Room within very neat and handfom. The Cooks were all the time very ftilland quiet, as if it were fom Religious Duty they were about, and each one according to his Office had a place allotted him, to wit, thofe that roafted and thofe that boiled, baked, fried, ftewed, &amp;c. each by themfelvs. The Cauldrons were fet faft in the Walls , and the Water they ufed was brought fom Miles by an Aqueduft, and let in by Silver Cocks. In this Kitchin is provided Viduals for mordthan . a Thoufand People, one day with another, to wit, Prieils, Pilgrims, and other Poor People which have here their Maintenance. They eat three times a day, at 6 in the Morning, at 10 before, and 3 in the afternoon. The two firft Meals were given by Schach Sephy , and the laft at the Charges of the prefent King. Before the Meals do begin, they beat 2 Kettle-drums, which they fay their great Prophet Ma homet made ufe of when he was in the Camp , and were brought from iMedma by Schach Sedredm.

Here I faw the befl: Beau ties and moft comly Faces that I have feen in all Verfia: their Women feem to have a greater Liberty than in moft places, where theydo not only go covered abroad, but are alfo denied the converfe with Men; for here they go bare with their Face, and arc very familiar with thofe of the Mafculine Gender, and if I be not miftaken were too fami liar with fome, who Within a few daies after began to (cratch their Heads, and this is the firft time I knew that the Ferftm Women un- derftood Trench.

The day following leaving SengtA , we had high and rocky way, but towards the Evening came into a moft fweet and pleafant Dale or Plain, through which a River glided veryfwiftly. This Valley was very pleafant, and notwithftanding the fealbn, appeared as if it were in May. This River is called Kifiiajeyn, having a very fair Stone Bridge over it, over which we paffed and pitched on the South fide, in the open Field, for there were no Houfesto be feen. On the 2 8 th - we broke up and went over the famous , being a very rough and dangerous way, infomuch that all the Company were fain to allight and lead their Camels and Horfes, till we came into a Valley where we took our Reft for an Hour, or two. This Valley is very deep and a Neft of Robbers and Vagabonds, who find many lurking Places to hide themfelvs in, out of which they affail and furprife Travailers, if they think themfelvs ftrong enough: but we , as was faid bef ore, being increafed to a confiderable Number knew our felvs fufficiently out of peril.

On the Banks of this River is a Village bearing the fame name, where: is a fair Stone Bridge of 9 Arches, or Bows. All along the-Way fide grow great plenty of Almond, Cyprefs and other Trees, which ferved us all the way in ftead of Parafoh,: but when we were come over the River found the Way very bad, being forced to clamber over Rocks, tlie Path being fo narrow that only one Gamel at once could s;© on it, On each fide were many great Clefts and deep Caves , which with the rattling of the Horfes feet made a dreadfull and horrid Eccho } and being come to a place which was the fulleft of thofe Cayerns, all the Company gave a Shout, which with an Eccho refoun- ded from one Place to another, that it feemed as if therehad been 10 or 12 Troops of Men in fo many feveral Places calling to one another. On this way it happened that a Camel broke the Leathers wherewith his Pack was faftened to the Crutchet or Saddle, being, j.uft at the Brink of a wide and deep Pit, whe ( re no Bottom could be. feen. It coft the Slaves who attendedhim much labour to favehim,, and were in ftruggling once in great hazard them felvs of tumbling down, Camel and all, yet at laft, with lofs of the Pack which in 1 fpite of all they could do fell down, they got clear.. The pack was. very rich, a-nd the lois thereof fo concerning to the Merchant , that if others had not hindred him he had thrown the Slaves,after it, for- their Negligence. This ill way much detarded us on this Days Jour ney, for we were more than 5 Hours in travailing one Mile. Being got over this bad way we found a Village where it was defigned that we Ihould take our nights reft; T he name of the T own was Keynt&amp;e being very poor and not in a Condition to fupplyus withfuchNe- cefiaries as we ddired for our Money.

The Streets are not paved as in other places , fo that when it is windy they are not paflabie, for the Duft that flies about, which befides the aptnefs it has to hurt ones Eies, is no fmall annoyance to thofe who areapparreled in a gay Garb. tj ,,, In this City Schach Tamas kept his Court as alfo his Son Ifma'cl T*iaceof w \y 0 built that Magnificent Palace before the , which ftill Tamas. remains as a lafting monument of that puiflant Monarch , and the Footfteps of a glorious Court, which, had nottheUnthankfullnefs of the Inhabitants been id great, might have been there till this Day. The Gates are very high and ftately, the Rioof and Walls within are all laid with Tiles of Porceiine , and fomeofthemembelliflied with Flowers of Gold, which are annealed or burned in, as tMsdaaorsbitaat whom 1 prefume theyJliave tiutt Ait.

And on the outlide round about pleafant Walks of Cedars and Cyprefs trees. In this City are 2 Maydans. On the one ftands a Magnificent Hall, full of Shops, wherein are to be fold Jewels and many other things of value. ]M ear this Exchange The ex. is a place where they deal altogether in Living Jewels , which are there to be had at as mean a Price as a Lurcher or Shock upon the Dog-market at x^Amjlerdam j thele being fuchjewels as we commonly call Girls of the Game, MifTes, or Cracks, and I know not what canting names they have now a days for fuch unnatural and fenfual Proftitutes: The Perjians call them Cahbaha. About Sun-fetthefe are all brought out and fet in a row by an old Woman they call Deld who officiates as a Broker. Behind thefe young Females ftand a par cel of old Women who have by them a Bolfter, a Quilt, a Coverlet, and a litle Lanthern in the Hand, all Implements for the purpofe. 'Now fo foon as any one coms to view the Merchandife, thefe old Punks light the Candle , unvail the Face, and fo going from one to another till he finds one he likes and then ftrikes a Bargain; which done one of the old Women follows him with the Moveables on her Shoulder whitherfoever he pleafes, and all with as litle ffiame- faftnefs as if it were the moft honourable Merchandife in the World. On the Eaft fide of the City is the Common place of Sepulture: where alfo lies interred the Body of S the Son of By whofe Tomb the Perjians fwear, holding it for a moft facred Oath, and confequently very hainous to violate : and when one defires another to alTeverate a matter will afk him , Holy Grave. In Cafoin are 5 o Churches which ftand open every day, and are frequented by thofe that go to pray, but the great or Temple, which they call T^ame, is open one day in Four, when there is alwaies a great Convent.

Wherefore they alwaies lead a Camel thro the ftreets for 3 daies together before this Feaft, adorning it with Garlands of Leavs and Flowers, if there be any to be had, and on the Feftival Hay it, with many Ceremonies. Firft comes the who is one Ikill'd in the Law , and reads certain Faifages out of the when he is filent they play upon Trumpets, Flutes and Drums. In the mean while the Common-People run and crowd in to the Camel, to get fom of the Hair , every one pulling as much as he can , which is kept for Relifts , and reputed good for Women in Childbed who cannot eafily be delivered j infomuch that the Beaft is almoft bare before he com to be Offered. When they have led him 3 days about Town he is brought out of the City to a place thereto appointed , where all the greateftPerfonages are prefent and immediately make a Ring, The Beaft being brought in, oneofthemoft eminent Ferfons runs him thro with a Spear , upon which all the People run with Hatchets, Bills, and Knives ftriving every one to get a piece, which they carry home, fom boyling it, and others preferving it till the year after, reckoning it a certain and fure token of Happinefs to that Houfe, where there is but a fmal Morfel of this Camel.

On the Southeaft fide of the Town grows abundanceof Tobacco, but not cultivated or planted, which is no fmall profit to the Inha bitants.

J ButC hap . XXX. The Voyages of But this is alfo concomitated with other Annoyances, to wit, the Extreme Heat of the Climat, and the Multitudes of Scorpions which l6 7 2 * haunt the Town, thofe being both great and dangerous, yet both in fhape and colour differing from thofe in The Inhabitants for fear of that venemous Animal dare not ly upon the Floor, as in other Places, where they only throw a Qiult upon theTapsftrv,but have high Couches hanging from the Roofs of the Rooms, like Hammocks: and altho this Creature be very venemous and manyareftungby it yet few die, they having found out a ready Medicin againft it, which is made of the Filings of Copper tempered with Vinegar and Honey which is a very fpeedy remedy, yet if neglected the Party ftune is in danger of his Life. This I prefume has bmfirft found out by an An tipathetical quality which feems to be between thofe Scorpions and Copper, for not far from the City is the Copper-mint, where if one of thele be brought it dies immediatly. Befides thefe Scorpions , they are pefterd with another venemous . Creature which they call Enkurekm, being very much like a Spider, but bigger than a Moufe, fom of thefe are fpeckled, and fom have long ftreaks over the Back. Thefe keep moft in ftony Places, and haunt the Herb Tremne , almoftlikeour Wormwood. The venemous Matter which they have in them they fpit out, as fom fay Toads do, which wherefoever it lights, whether on man or Beaft it immediatly penetrates and incorporates with the Blood, and fo proceeds to the tLfr' Head and Heart. So foon as the Patient is touched he falls imme- diately into a deep fleep, in fuch fort that all the calling and beating him, will not avail or awake him; or if by chance it do he remains . ftill fencelefs. The beft and fpeedieft Remedy for this, is the Enkurekm it's felf, pounded into a Cataplafm and applied: but when thefe are not to be had, they ufe another mean, which is thus. The Patient is laid upon his Back and his Mouth let open, into which they pour as much Milk as they can make him digeft; which done, they put him in a fquare Cheft, having on each fide a Ring, through which are four Cords put and made faft at one Ring on the Cieling. This Chefl: thus hanging, they whirl it about for a quarter of an Hour together, till the Patient breaks up and vomits all he has within him. This commonly lucks, if the Patient can be brought to fwallow the Potion; yet they feel the vigorous force of the Poyfon, for a long timeafter! Thefe^12. The Voyages of lohn Struys. V oy , III.

After we had lay Eight days in and bought Wares and Prr- vifion, we broke up, and on the 13 at night came to ChotTa.Capm , which ftands in the middle of a Grove of Gyprefs and other Trees, which Winter and Summer grow always green. In the faid Carx^pAnjerawe found very good Accommodation.

When they were ready to try their Dexterity one went up to the Top , and fet up a Cup of Gold, which who could hit and bring it down, Ihould not only have it for his Pains, but alfo be preferred to great Honour , and take place among the Princefs of The King gave the Tartars the Advantage of fhooting firft who after they had iliot more than an hour, were fain to give over: for it was to be don on Horfe back, and the Horfe in a fullcarier , and furthermore not to (hoot till they came to a certain Place where they had the maft directly on the left fide. The Ambaflador feeing that none ofhis men were fo dexterous gave over, and deiired the King that he would vouchfafe to try the ikill of the Per funs. Upon which the King orde red certain Perfons, who, without doubt, were very expert Marks men, to ride in a circle, one for one, where the third that fhot had the Fortune to bring it down, upon which the gaveafhout that the Palace rang again. Upon this he was fent for by the King and brought into the Palace with as much Triumph as if he had won fom fignal Viftory ; the Cup , Bow, and Quivers were like Tro- phys carried before him , by certain Heraulds thereto appointed, and he himfelf altho but a poor Mans Son of-Key Lin, promoted to great honour and reckoned in the Degree of a chm. Befides this the King gave him a confiderable Penfion out of the Trefury to maintain his Grandour. On the South fide of the Mdydan is a very (lately which was founded and begun by Schuh Abas , but finilhed by his Nephew, who dedicated it to Twelve Saints, which are all inclu-Abas de- ded under the name of Meloedi , and , as their Hiftorians affirm, were all buried in one Grave.

Leaving thisPaflage you go up two Stepps which leads you into a broad Plain, and about 8 hundred Foot dire£tly for ward another ftep which brings you into the Church. The Gate which enters the Mejqmte is of fair Marble and about as high as that of the Mefchmh of choddabende in Suit ant The Doors' of this Temple are laid ore with Silver Plates, and fet in with Flowers of Gold. Entring within the Gate, you colli into a pompous Antichamber, the Floor whereof is befpred with very fine Matts, upon which they fall down on their Knees, and make a Ihort prayer. From hence on each hand is a ftately Gallery, each leading into another fpacious Court, having in the middle a great Fountain, with a Bath. Above thefe great Galleries are fom lefs, which are fupported by marble Pillars , the Chapters and Foliage whereof are neatly gilded. When you are paft thefe Galleries and the Courts , you come into the Temple it felf, entring in atafplendidPort, within and under the Cieling, all laid in with blew T iles of true Porceline, and intermixed with Flow ers of Gold. The Temple its felf is very large and fumptuous, fup ported with huge marble Pillars. On the right hand at going out of this Church, you enter thro an Arch into a magnificent Hall, where Hands a Pulpit and an Altar, which faidplace, forfumptuoufnefs and uniformity of ftrufture , is reputed the moft coftly Building and moft glorious Fabric in the whole Emaraih. All the Marble where of it is built , feeming to outvy the Snow its felf for whitenefs , is brought hither, not without vaft trouble and Chargcs,from the Moun tains o^Elivend. The The Kings Palace, called D or Schach is alfo a very ftateiy Houfe. Before you enter the outer Gate is a large Plain, on which are many Pieces of old Brafs Ordnance, unfit for ufe, and arc only thrown together on heaps, and out ot order: a true Em- bleme of fuch Perfons as have in the Flower of their Youth beenfer- viceable to their Prince and Commonwealth, but growing old and impotent becom Abjects; and are laid afide. The Palace, 'tis true, is munited on every fide with a Wall, but fo meanly, that it would not refift a Cannon ball, much lefs fecure the Perfon of the King, if attacqued with any fudden Force, which is the leaft thing they dread.

With in the Palace are feveral great Halls or Appartments, amongft which the Tahchme and the Di ^an-chane are the chiefeft: The former being the Banquetting Houfe, and the latter the Court ofjuftice. In the DtTvm-chane Ambafladors are always received and thence introduced into the Chamber of Audience, the more becaufe the Glory of the Cavalcade and other Solemnities can be here the better feen. Another Appartment which is not much inferior to thofe already made men tion of, is the Harm-Chme , where the King diverts hmifelf with his Wives and Concubines. The Dekay is the Place where the King retires, and has his Refidence, when not ingaged in any important Affair , holding here his Table with his legitimat Wives. In fhort there are many other Appartments within the Palace for inferior Con cerns. Behind the Palace is a Garden which they call the chobbadar, in the middle whereof is a beautifull little Chappel. Hereisalfo the great Sanftuary , or Place of Refuge , which they call Allycarp , which is as much as to fay, Gods Gate\ in which Place a Malefador is free from Juftice.

On the North fide of the May dan , are many Taverns and Tap- houfes, and among thofe a Houfe greatly frequented by Traders, called the T^aychatti-Chme or Thee-houfe, which they prepare quite after another manner than the Indians of whom the firft had it; for here they put info many aromatical Ingredients , that one can neither perceiv any Tafte or Smell of Tee in it. In drinking Tee they alfo accuftom themfelvs to Play, and efpecially at Chefs, at whichThe Voyages of lohn Vor. Ill, they are very quick and expert. The Goffee-houfes they call Cahnx' Chme , where they only go to drink Coffee.and fraokc Tobacco, Jo?®'' 11 with which they are fo deeply affefted that they fomtimes fmoke in 11^®®'' the Church. When they are within doors they have a great Glafs, it* c ® full of water , thro which they put their Pipes and fmokc , much 1^® after the manner of an Alembic Still, which renders it very cool. When iiPeoF they draw, the water bubbles up as if it boyled, yet by rcafon of a OntW ftinking vapour that rifes from it, is very annoyfom. But when they itiekts fmoke along the ftreet have only Inch a Pipe as thofe which are now o-rown common in the LoTv-Coumreys, being of feveral joynts, and jotlpot the Head of Earth. Their Coffee they drink very hot, and arc of mtof®: opinion that it fedates and affwages their Luft to Women , which make their Wives ready to proteft againft it, rather willing that iadsycr their Husbands fhould tranfgrefs againft the Alchoran and ufe the lt Jtlio(cl Juyce of the Grape than that Berry. The chief Cuftomers jactM which thofe Public Houfes have, are the Barbers, who frequently haunt them to be imploy'd in fhaving their Heads: but every man ^ that is able to buy a Rafor always carries one about with him , being very fearfull of the fenereAl Murrain, which they call and we the French Pox , or fom fuch thing.

There are alfo two fair Chriftian Mouafteries s the one for the Carmelites and the other for &lt;^dngttJhnhAonks. Thefe with many other fair Buildings , too tedious to recount, are within the Walls.

The Women arc attired as the Men only with this difference, that they wear a long Silk or Cotton Scarfwhich trails on the Ground. The Language they fpeak is ftill the ancient Lingua Perfi for they are very curious in preferving their ancient Tongue without any Innovation, infomuch that the Perjians who fpeak the modern Language cannot underftand them [as the EngUJh cannot underftand the old Brmifh , or \Vel(h~\ yet thefe can both underftand and fpeak the prefent Tongue. They retain alfo the Ancient Characters, and adore the Sun and the Elements for Deities performing Monethly Sacrifices. Befides the veneration they have for the Sun , they do worfhip to the Starrs, but have little or no Judgement in the courfe of the fame. Snakes and all other venemous Animals they hold for unclean, fo that whofo- ever touches any of thofe, whether voluntarily, or by accident, muft not enter into their Temples till he be purified. Their Dead they do not burn as moft Pagans do , but when any Perfon dies, whether it be an Infant, or one com tofull growth and Maturity, they wafh the Body very clean, and carry it to a Place far diftant from any Hou- fes, and there fet it upright againft a Poft, where they wait till the Ravens com and pick out the one Eie , which ifit be the right Eie, they are of opinion that the Soul ofthe Departed is in Paradife, and therefore interr him very decently j but if the Bird pull out his left Eie firft, then they hold it for a fure Token,, that he is damned, and for his wicked Life to fuffer perpetualTorments, and therefore efteem him not worthy of fuch folemn Exequies , but caft him head-long into a deep Pit.

On each corner ftands a noble Summer Houfe, of an admirable rare Fabric. The Garden it's felf has the moft and greateft varieties of Fruit-Trees and Vegetables that ever Ihavefeen, alt ho it was then W inter when I was there. And indeed the are great Lovers of Planting, Gardening, and all manner of Tillage} fothat there is hardly a Houfe in all If, but has lomthing of a Garden behind it, more or lefs, whence it coms that this City is fo great in compafs. As to the manner of their Hous-keeping and other peculiar Cu- ftoms, I hold it needlefs to treat any thing about, lince it may be eolleded out of what I have already faid in the foregoing Chapters. They are in general very fociable, and for their Urbanity towards ftrangers, draw many Forreigners thither. They are alfo Lovers of all kinds of Difcipline, and the Gentry very ambitious in Arts and Sciences. The Land, about ifyahais very fertile , and affoards ail- that is neccilary for human fuftenance iiTi good plenty.

On the 16 of Feb) mrf , was the Epiphany celebrated by the n'un and Georgian Chriftians. So foon as I heard what was the matter , I rofe pretty early in the morning with intent to lee the Solemnity of the Day. The firft I met was the fef , or Great Marfhal with all his fubordinat Officers, who were ordered to prevent Tumults , and not to fufter Horfes and Camels with any Burthens to pafs over the Bridges and thro the Streets that lead to and which was not only don for the fake of the Chriftians, but upon the account of one of the Kings legitimat Wives , whom he entirely loved, being a Georgun by birth and educated in the Chriftian Reli gion , and had a deiire to go and fee the Solemnities performed, which the King would not deny her, for that Ihe was great with Child. About 8 in the morning were all the Chriftian Ladies in Balconies , which were all hung with Tapeftry, and thofe of the greateftrank with Canopies over head.

But before the Froccllion was ended it began to fnow very hard, which did not only caufc the King to Icav them but put a ftop to the further Celebration of this great Feftival, which, by the preparations , feemed to be intended to be folemnized with very great Pomp : for befides the Contribution of all the Chri ftians, who, as I have elfe where noted, are very rich, the King fends the Patriarch a confiderable Sum of Money fom time before, in order to the carrying on and maintaining this anniverfary Cuftom.

On the 25 we had very good weather, and the Way alio reafo- nable good fo that in good time we got to a CaraTvanfera, which lay about 8 Dutch Miles, or fomthing more from the other. Near this place are divers Ponds ofiweet Water affbardingalfo great plenty of Filh: wherefore we went to Angle , and took about 40 Carps, which becaufe of the Novelty were very acceptable, having eaten nothing all the v/ny but fait Meat. Thefe Ponds as well as the were made , as we underftood from an Inicription over the Door, at the Charges of the Dutch E^Ji India. Company. On the 26 we had very high Hills to clamber over, fo that the hollow places in the way being fill'd with fnow , put us (notwith- fhmding all the care and vigilance we could ufe) to a great deal of trouble, for the way being very flippery, the Camels, Mules and Horfes often ftumbled and fell, which greatly endamaged theChefts which were but newly and very loofly repaired. Befides that it fnew very thick all the F orenoon, which made us longfor a we could not reach till late at night coming to the Village where we refted for that night, having made no more than 5 Dutch Miles the whole day. That night and the next day it continued fnow- ing, fo that we refolvcd to continue under roof till the weather grew better. About noon came a Carayxn from Syr as , but we having taken up the place, they were fain to go forward till they found another. On the 27 the weather grew better and the Sun (hone, fo that we proceeded on our Journey , but having travailed an hour or two IjKo^ we were furprized by fom Robbers , who all on a fudden afTaird us bers ' and befet the Caravan round, and fella tearing all they could com at. Our Company , being affraid of their lives deferred the Camels and left me alone to Handout the brunt of all. One of the Robbers thruft his hand into a Bag in which were 3 or4. Flitches of Bacon and fom Hams, who, when he came to know what it was, fella curfing and menacing me, that I did not warn him, for he was thereby unclean, and according to the iMahometan Superftition not to com into the Society of others, or enter the Temple.

That day we travailed 24 \_Englifh~\ Miles, and at night came to a very com modious and ftately Caraivrnjera, fuch as I had not met with all the way unlefs in lom great Gity, being all round with Galleries. On the 28 we let forward on our Journey and came to a fair Vil lage called Mcjiztd , where we had a very commodious CuraTvanfera, and ftay'd there that night. The faid CdraJDrnferei was nothing inferior to that we had the night before, afwellmrefpeftofConvemencyas ornament, having much variety of Garved work, as Foliage, Fru- fturagc, &amp;c. after the Perjian manner: the Walls alfo were covered with a neat fort of white glazed Tiles. Near to this Place is the Sepulchre and Tomb ofthe Mother of being a fair Monument of white Marble: hither repair many devout Women to vifit the Tomb fhtfjf and pour out their Prayers and Supplications for themfelvs and Schach Friends, which I remark'd was very brief, for they only (according • to the general Injunction) pulh'd the Tomb with their Head 3 times, Mother. and as often ftooped to kifs it, then muttered out a Ihort prayer, which doubtlefs they .have by form, and fo departed. Having ftay'd there that night we went in the Morning to buy up fom frefh Provi- fions and Fruits, that place being very famous for Winter-growth of Fruits, both as to plenty and Gheapnefs. On the *Nine and Twentieth of we came to a little village * Fat u called Si^a, having that day travailed 5 Miles. The next day wefet forward on ourjourney and travailing a good pace, came pretty earlymto the village Mard.ifch , where we refolved to reft a little being almoft wearied out with the badnefs of the Way and Weather. The next morning I took a turn without Town on Horfe-back , with one of our Company; where having rode about 2 Miles to the Eaftward from the Town, we defcried a huge fair Pile of Building, which afterwards by fom Pilgrims that we met. We underftood was a Sepulchre. The general Structure was a very fair Temple altogether built of Marble, Handing on a riling ground and iupported with 10 high and mafl y Pillars.

This ftupendious Palace is feated, as appears by the Rums, on a Plain, environed on every fide with Hills j and has extended it's Compafs as far as the Hill called whrnet , which is as much as to fay, the Mount tf Mercy. On the Eait are two places of Entry with Marble Stairs, each ftep being 30 Foot long and 17 of thofefteps arc wrought out of one Stone, which muft neceffarily'have been a very great one, each ftep being hall a Foot high. Being afcended 3 2 or 3 3 of thofe Steps we came at a great fquare Refting place the W ails and Pavement whereof was altogether of hard and pohlhed Marble. On each fide were the Images-of divers Beafts as Lions , Elephants, Gnffins, Hoffes and others Animals, after wards we came into a large and fpacious place, about cp Paces fquare, where were Eight Gates, 4, whereof were 4. Paces and 3 Two Paces wide. Above and on each fide of thefe Gates were divers Statues and other Figures, . which for their Boldnefs, due Conftrudion of Members, Symmetrie of Parts, Analogy of Depreffion and Eleva tion , Holding and Forelhortning of Plains, with all other Tokens of true Art, furpafs all the Carved works that ever I have feen either in Greece , Italy , or the whole World befides, that Lhave had the Fortune to fee.

The Statues have moftly Weapons, Inftruments of Mu- fie, or Garlands in their Hands. Here and there are feveral Horfemen armed with Bow and Qiiiver, Som with Spears, Rondaces, Seymi- ters and fuch like Weapons. Their Habit is very ftrange and feems to be very ancient: fome have round Bonnets as'the nobis VenettrrA now, and Knights Templars of old ufed to wear.

T he fay that it is the Statue of Solomon King of the but I rather take it to be Lsflexxncier the Great , becaufe of the Mond, who was the firll Monarch (^according to Hiilory} that was fo painted , as fuppofing himfelf to have conquered the whole World, and for fom time had his Refidence in this Palace. Befides this were oil each fide fevcral others which feemed to be of lefs degree and meaner Perfonages, as well by the Places where they flood as by the Habit, being clad in ihorter Robes and narrow Veftureswith fleevs clofe at the wnil, like the Pefantry about Derbent. Som of thefe had long old-faftuon'd Spears, others led Horfes and Mules, and others brought oxen and Sheep with Mallets, Hatchets, Knives and other Implements for Slaughter as if they werea going to Offer. In this fpacious Hall were alfo many other Figures as Emblemes, which were too dark and ab- ftrufe for me to unriddle. Leaving this Appartment we went into another more wide and fpacious than the former. At one End was another Statue clofe and (as I fuppofed} faft to the Walls, which by the Crown, orrather Cap of State, feemed to befom Prince. He was on his kne.es, and as it were, praying to the Sun, Fire and a Ser pent. The Inhabitants told me that it was the Image of famjlhet , or femfch* to whom, as I have already faid, the afcribe the Founding. The nioft part of thofe Statues were gilded, and appear fo yet. There were alfo feveral Battails admirably well don , and had good Symmetry and Proportion according to the Diftance, Hol ding and Perfpc6tive, all hewn out of black Marble and fet faft in the Wall.

Upon this Motiv the King went himfelf in Pcrfon and lay the firft: fire to it, being imitated by a Train of Courtiers and Whores all befotted with drink , fo that this wonderfull great and the moft fplendid Palace in theUni- verfe was in a moment laid in Rubbifh, there being much Cedar in it; When the Soldiers law all on a flame, they ran to quench it but feeing the King very bufy in fetting it on Fire, they fell to a con trary work, and in ftead of indeavouring to quench it brought wood to increafe the Fire j whence it appears that the ftrongeft Fort, 1 pre- fume, that ever was, or is in the World, was demoliihed by the power ful Intereft of Women and effects of Wine.

This day, being as I faid very bad weather, we hardly tra- railed 6 Dutch Miles. The next day letting forward we came at night to a Village called Vohba , where we fet our Carayan down. This Village appeared like a Camp or Army with their Tcnts, the Cottages being fo mean, and the higheft houfe hardly fufficient for a tali man to Hand upright, being built only of Reeds and Twigs plated like Bafket-work and daubed over with clay. The Inhabitants like the Cottages they lived in were very poor and defpicable People, inibmuch that we had not much Divertifement or accommodation there. This day we hardly advanced 5 Dutch Miles.

Upon thofe Hills grow great Creat ftoreof Da^es, and a re fo cheap that one may buy ioo lb * weight for the /?»«•«/ , value of 2 Shillings Sterl. and are both of an excellent tall: and lovely colour. The Date-tree feems to have fom harmony with living Am- mals, in their Procreation, and have alfo their Sexes. The Female will not bear any Fruit if planted alone, fo that they are always planted by Pairs together all along , and indeed do naturally grow fo. But the Female growing old will not bear Fruit, ualefs they take a piece Trea! of the Top-branch of the Male and ingraft it m the Female, which they alfo do to fom young Trees to make them bring forth good Fruit, which would otherwife be of a bitter and odious Taft. I have further remark'd that when the Male and Female are planted a fmall diftance afunder they will lean towards each other, as if there were fom mutual fympathy between them. The Inhabitants who have bin , from one Generation to another, ulcd to plant and propagate thefe Trees told me many remarkable things about them, which becaufe I will not be prolix, 1 (hall ommit. This day we travailed 7 Dui:h Miles, and at night got a fair Caraivanfera to take our reft in. The next day we had very dry ground and a barren Countrey to pafs thro, and in fom places rocky, fo that we travailed that day no more than 5 Miles.

The feafon being fharp and cold we laid on a great pile of wood, and warmedour felvs throughly. The day following in the Afternoon we came to a Town called Scharim, which I prelume had bin anciently a City and walled in it liood in the middle of a grove altogether of Date-Trees. Itisalfo a Town of confiderable Traffic in contideration of their Manufactu- rie in Cottons, there being-very many Weevers.

Befidesthe great Concourfe of Trading- people, they have a Market twice a week for the Boors , which is no fmall advantage to the Town. Finding this a very commodious place to reft, in, we tarried here 3 days to refrefli our felvs, and eafe our Camels, Horfes and Mules, having for 3 or 4 days had very bad way and weather.

About midnight they fell in and fought out right, fo that 5 of our Men lay prefently under Feet , being in all 37. We fought joyntly together with good Courage fo that we fpee- dily allayed their Fury. Our Party as we could obferve were much Wronger than theirs, yet if we had not bin unanimous and faithfull to one another we had not com fo well of, for there was not one Man from the greateft to the leaft, but fought manfully and with a good will, till the very laft, when they ran into another Roomand'/hut the Door after them, which was no fmall advantage to us: for, when we had them fo pen'd up we knew our felvs fecure, there being no other Faftage for them to com out at. The Door we barricado'd in with huge Stones , and with all our Carbines and Blundcrbuflcs poured in fhot upon them, fo long, till they began to beg for Quarter, which we refolved not to giv them, but promifed them the liberty to com forth and to Hand to our mercy. In the mean while We had £ W r. obferved that feveral of them lay dead and wounded.

We had no fooner difburthened the Camels, but had 50 or 60 Women who came and proffered us Milk to fell, and were lb importunat and troublefom, that we could not get rid of'em , till we fet the Doggs upon them. Thefe went all with their Face uncove red , which I had not feen any Honeft Women in all do, except in one Village between Scamnchj and ifpahm. This day we had fur thered our Journey by 7 Miles. On the 25 we had a great and wearifom Mountain to travail over at the Foot whereof was a River which we were forced to wade thr6 s , by reafon that the ftone-bridge which had formerly lain over it was broken down. .After we had travailed 5 Miles we took up our nights reft in a CaraTvanfera. But we could here get no manner of Re- frelhment , the Countrey round about being dry and barren, pro ducing nothing but Date-trees, that we Could fee. On the 26 towards night we came to a Grange of Fifher-men of whom we bought a few tor our ufe. We were no fooner fet down but came Monfr.

We had aboard us about tk 50 Men and had not above 5 or 6 Guns that we could u{e. Being tii thus in a great Strait and not knowing what to do having no lei- ijie fure to confult, it was refolved thac we lliould board the kI an EnglishFriggat of 48 Guns, which followed us with the Fire- ii ihip.

The Admiral therefore gave command to attempt an entrance at the South fide of tbe Ifland , where it was fo narrow that they could not go abov 4 in a rank, infomuch that if the Holknders could have mifled fo many men out of the Fort, might have knockt them all down with Stones, with 50 or 60 Men, fo that the English invaded the Ifland unmolefted. The Governour feeing that they were fur- prifed, and he unable to defend himfelf againft (o great a Power, fur- rendred upon Articles and Compofuion. This was the Relation of the English. On the 4 of fane the English got two Ships more of the 5 that fol lowed us with another coming from who, not knowing any thing to the contrary but that the Htlknders were ftill Mailers of the Illand, came failing without any dread dire&amp;ly thither from the Cape. For the English had planted the Princes Flag aloft, and a Red Flag on the High way, which was a privat Token that the Hollanders had among themfclves. When I remarked what the meaning of allthis was, and how eafil your Ships would be deceived ,1 went to the Shores,, where I efpied the Ships not abov half V Dutch league diftant, andimmediady pulled of my Shirt and fet it upon a Stick, that at left they might begin , if they fliould have the Fortune to fee it , to c&amp;nfider well with themfelvs, what fuch might import &gt; but it feemed that they took no notice of it, or' elfe did not fee it, otherwife it had bin time enough for them to have fcap'dthe Scouring. 'Twas not long before I was fpied by two Sentinels, who came in all haft, and beat me altera moft lamentable manner: which when they had don brought me before the Governour , who asked me , what I meant by that Token, I told him with great liberty, thought it my duty to Tmarn my Nation from Ptril lphich they 'Were ready ' tamn m v and ih*t IfttPpofeA that if,.

Whence we may learn what difference there is^between drinking at the Fountain, and drinking at the Current. Mean while the Ships came on undauntedly j and were hardly fail ed within the Bay, but defcryed a tym in an KjiJfesSkm, in Head of an L^ffs in a Lions Skin, and difcerned a Wolfs Body with a Sheeps Voice, the Colours they faw fpoke good , but the Ships danced an Enrrhfh Jig, wherefore they thought it beft to tack about and make all the fail they could : which the perceiving , out after them all in a Body, and took the Admiral and Vice-Admiral, but the Rere-Admiral and the other 2 made their Efcape, and could not be overtaken. The Admiral behaved himfclf with good courage, and had probably not bin taken if hisMizzin Peek had not bin brought by the board. The Ship that engaged and took him was the Freedarult , being formerly a Dutch Ship and taken by the in the year 1665 , and was now mounted with 54,Guns. Our Admiral would fain have boarded her but could not, for the poured inceffantly upon them with fmall (hot, infomuch'that he was fain to yield, the Commander liimfelf being wounded in the Leg. The next day we were ordered to go aboard dircfting our Courfe for ^Jfcenfton Ifland, which ferv the for a Rendezvous, where we arrived on the 19 of Ime. Here the Men went to take Tortoifes , which are there in very great abundance , fom of 200 and fom joo'b- weight.

The whole Ifland is white with tne --ung of Mews, Cormorants, and a fort of Wild-geefe that com thitherto build and breed, as alfo to prey upon the dead Fifh which lies in heaps upon the fhore, and in the fmall Inlets, and Creeks. ^There is no frefli Water upon the Ifland, which if there had we had bin very unhappy, for the Englifh had intended to leav us there with a little Frovifion , till our own Ships lliould come to fetch us off: buc feeing there was none, they were fo kind as to carry us tor Eng/and. The reafon of their defign to do fo, was becaufc they had very many fick aboard, and grew every day weaker and weaker by the Death of their Men; fearing therefore that we fliould rife and. make our felvs Matters of the Ship when we found an Opportunity, being about 300 D»/c&amp;inall.

The iVtywood alio (ends a Perfon of Quality with a Body of Soldiery to joyn with thofe under Boogdanof: thefe were then to be commanded by a FoUi whofe name was Ivan RuJJlnjki and a Profelytc- in the Rujfian Church, and next ta him one fames IVendrong , a Scotch Gentle man , born in Rdenburgy aged about 3 3 years, and univerlally well fpokenof&gt; for his Piety and faithfull deportment.

There were alio 2 Dutch Lieutenants fent upon this afhir who were baptized into the Rupan Church. As alfo 2 or 3 Enfigns. The reft of the Officers, were moftly Poles and Rujfes. UPON the 25 of Maj being Monday in Whitfun-weefc the Captains departed from Afirachan in about 40 Stroegs , all under the command of Knees Simeun Iva- nowitx. Elboof. Each Stroe? had one Piece of Canon and all neceffary Ammuni tion, the whole number of the Men that were aboard this ^leet (as appeared by the Mufter-roll) did not exceed 26'oo Men , whereof 2 roc were of the Strelitz.ers of Aflrtchan who have fome manner of Diftinftion among themfelvs. THE' fame day the Coftc who had bin lo cruelly tortured was hanged upin fight of the whole Army, In the mean time the Inhabitants of began to mur mur and breath Rebellion, inciting one another againft the Governourand Magi- flracy, which feemed to be a very bad Omen of feme ill Confequence, for from that time forward they continued bolder and bolder till at length it burft out into palpable Rebellion. About this time arrived a Dutch Chirurgeon at Aflr/tchan, who had bin in the Retinue of the Mofcovim Amballadorat Jfpahan of whom I bought fom Silk ftufts and 480 Hides of Turkj leather, for which I immediately tendered the Money, ABOUT the beginningfl think the 4th. day) off me came a Gentleman froxnChor- nojar with very unwelcom News. His Me flag e was that the fame day that Knees Simeun Ivanowit 'Z. with the Ruflian Army was arrived before that City , the Cofacks appearing far more numerous and ftrong ? thofe in the City revolted ? declared themfelvs Copicks , and furrendred'up the Town to Radz^in and the Rebells. He added furiher, That all the loyal Officers who indcavored to diffwade them there from, were moft inhumanly maftacred. This fad Exprefs r akho imothered as much as was poffible by the IVajwod and Council of Ajlrachmi was neverthelefscome to the knowledge of the Townsmen, who were very impatient to bear the yoke of Obedience any longer. Upon this news I was fent for by the jVajwod, whQ afked me if my Men v/ere able to manage the Cannon,, and gave order that in the firft place all the Cannon ihould be viiited that lay upon the Walls 3 and to repair thofe thai.wcre defcftlv which was forthwith done.[366] ON Tiro rfday the ofpune, we left the Ship , and brought all the Goods into the Fort, by order of the Governor, our Gunner alio loaded'a great part of the Or dnance. Still continued whifpering and murmuringagainft the Governour, fothat neither He, nor the Council ^urft appear without doors for fear of an Uproar. The Chirurgeon of whom I have already made mention, having bin converfant about I4years with the Rtijfes, and not unacquainted with their tumultuous fpirits, told ine, he could eafily forcfec that the City would be betray'd ere long, ifthe Common fort did not fee better marks and clearer evidence of Security; and without doubt we that were Strangers and in fcrvice of the Great Duke muft expeft fomwofull Cataftroph: and therefore fince our Pay was retraded, and our fer vice only aboard the Ship, and not in the Land Army, it was more ad vifable to betake our felves over the Cafpian Sea to the Perftan Coafl:. I had already ordered our Men to buy up 18 Moneths Provifion ofNeceflaries, fearing a Siege. UPON this Motion of the Chirurgeonlfummonedupmy Officers and took Council together with them , what was beft to be don in this cafe: they unanimoufly rcfolved that it was more fecure to betake our felves to flight , fince we hadnoPay, and therefore not under any obligation to ferve the Duke by Sea , much lefs by Land. They were willing to leave all they had at Aflrachan except only their cloaths, be- caufe it would bean incumbrance: yet becaufe I had many coftly Cloaths and other Goods, they refolved to take as much as they could with them, and packMall up in a great Portmantle and a Trunk which I had, befides two little Chefts, which I aiTented to. Every one took as much Provifion of Bread in his own Portmantle as he thought might ferve him ; and it was refolved that we fhould leave none behind, fave only 2 Seamen, who had each a Wife and a young Child. On Friday in the After noon my beft Things were brought aboard , it being intended that we fhould depart that night, which the two Seamens Wives coming to perceive would by all means go with us. But I weighingwelltheEnterprize withmy felf, andconfidering the danger of adventuring with 22 Perfons more, in a Shallop of 26 Foot long, I thought it not good to eflay the matter^ I had with me one Chriftian Brand my Gunners Mate, with whom I refolved to flay and fee what the event would be at Jtjlrachany and (if our fate was fuch) to die on the Bed of Honour, rather than to flee we knew not whither. This I intimated to the Mafter and the Dodorwho aUo were content to venture their Lot,. Immediatly I fent a Seaman to the Matters Mate aboard the Shallop to acquaint them with the Alteration of my Refolution j but that night the Gates were (hut fooner than the cuftomary hour ; io that he could not get fpeech to them. This put me intofome doubt, fearing that they might put off without me: but the Mafter and two Seamen perfwaded me to the contrary faying they would never have the boldnefs to go without me which for that time made me reft contented. That Evening I went the Rounds with the Vice-roy upon the Walls of the Caftle, which was laid ore with Heaps of Stones &gt; to ufe in cafe of Storm. O N the feventh of funCy being Saturday early in the morning, 1 fent a Seaman to the Ship again with fom privat InftruSions j but he making fom delay, and I not have the patience to wait any longer went my felf &gt; with the Chirurgeon? and found that they[367] tliey were gone off with the Shallop. The Mafter and the reft were (or feemed to be) furprizcd at the matter 5 as not beleeving they would have had the boldnefs to go without further order. ^Tis true it fcemed not fo ftrangc to me being only what I expeded from them. However we concluded it the fafcft way for our own fccurity to acquaint the jVajwod with the mattery before he Ihould come to hear it from others, and with one to let him know the reafon. But he who was my In terpreter wasalfo fled with them, fo that I was fain to make ufe of the Chirurgeon before mentioned^ Having acquainted the Governour with what had pafled, he Ihow'd himfelf outwardly not to be much concerned, efpecially when I told him that they were not gone over to the Cofackjy THE fame day came a Courier with anExprefs from Mo[cou y being the fame Gen tleman who had brought the news how that the about were revolted. This Gentleman^s name yt&amp;sDanile Tonrlekojofy and had been formerly with me a- board our Ship upon thcJVolga, between Cafan and ylftrachan , and intimated me with privacy how that the Revolting Party had u fed the Lievtenant General and other Ruffian OflEcers after a moft barbarous manner , and that *Aftrachan it felf, as well as all the Countreyround about, was already betray'd: but further faid he not. THE day following, being the pth of fme, I received an order from theGovernour to vifitthe Fortifications of the City. The like orders had an English Colonel, who was come hither from Terki which City was was alfo fortified anew by the faid Coll, being fituated in the Land otihzCircas-Tartars, about z Leagues from the Cafpian Sea: The old City, or Caftle, as j4damOlearhs writes, was firft built and fortified by one Cornelius Claafz,,zHtllartder. This Gentleman had the charge of oneQiiarter committed to him, and my felf the other, to repair it (6 &gt; that the Men might be fecure. Soon after came the himfelf in perfon and defired our Advice what to do for Security of the Town. The English Gentlemans ad vice was to make fome Outworks without the Walls: butladvifed him to make Proclamation that all fuch as had any way revolted or engaged themfelvs to the Cojac Party ihould be pardoned , and declared free Remmiffionaries , in cafe they would come and fubmit themfelvs to the Governour , and that the Towns men (hould have fome money diftributed among them, and the moft popular to be drawn in by promife of Advancement and the like j fo that thofe being leading Men might appeafe the reft : However my advice in that wasrejeded. ME AN while a narrow Watch was held , and the Soldiery lay all night upon the Walk, and 2 Men at every Port-hole, to be ready in cafe of a fileht Attacque. THE Ferfians, Calmuc-znA Circas-Tartars , under conduct ofa PerftanCcn- tie man, who was there upon his way to the Court at A&lt;fofcou, upon an AmbafTage from the King of PerJta, did alfo their utmoft indeavors to affift us, and paffed a- way the night with Mufic, Dancing and other Mir th. ThePoft affigned them uas the Poet Nietz*e Bafna, being the Bulwark where they ufually torture their Male- faftors. ON Sunday, being the 15th. of June I was invited to dinner with the Ua-ywod. When the Table was done he gav^ me a Prcfent, to wit, a yellow Silk Coat, z pair I [■QP ■ i 1 I Li 1 i ill 1[368] pair of Breeches and i (liirts, that being the Cuftom of the Ruffians upon extraor-- dinary Occafions [forfootb] He alfo made me many fair promiies, befides thcfrce- dom of his Houfe and Table for my Good fervice, having about i©o Men under my Condudl: nor did I appear too remifsinmy duty, fori went the Rounds every night ofter than my Order and Injunftion was. THEThurfday following, being the 19^ we had Intelligence how that the Forces were greatly increafed a|id that they were a Marching towards us; which news continued and was confirmed by a continual recourfeofLand-T^r^rj andFiihers into Aftrachan; There was alfo a falfe rumor fpread about the Town, as if our Men that were fled had loaden the Cannon that lay upon the ^X^alls with loole Pow der, others that it was with Balls and no Powder, and a third, that it was firft with Balis and then with Powder, all which coming to the Governours Earhcfentfoi: mc, but coming to worm the Guns in his prefencc found it was but a falle and ma licious report raifed by fome prejudiced Perfons to caftan upon them and to turn me out of Favour, ON Friday the 20th. of fme , the IVaywod made mc Lieutenant Coll. in place of fames Won dram, which by provilion I took upon mc , butbeingnot well pleaf- fd with my Charge, the ColL who obfervedit, fecmM a little dikontented, and faid in prefenceofthe Governour, That it was not now a fit time to folicit in for (uch things , Xvhence I collefled that he thought that I had made it my bufinefs to be advan ced f but was foon after better informed, when he would himfelf hare confirmed me in the Regiment and I with great carneftncfs declined it. The Poi&gt; which was affigned me was in the fame Quarter with the Col 1 , on the Tartarian (idc, where xhe Fort was the weakeft. ON Sunday, fune 22 came the Cofacks mtWm fight o( Aflrachan&gt; and fenta Cofac Trumpetter with a Ruffian Prieft to demand the Town. The laid Cofac had alfo a Letter for me in Dutch, whereinl was advifed not to fight with my Men , if I hoped for Quarter, or Mercy at their hands. The faid Letter was taken from me by the Waywod, before I had read it quite out, and torn ia Pieces. The Trum petter and Prieft had Gaggs put in their Mouths, that they fhould caufeno com motion or alteration among the Commons; aad were foon after beheaded. ON Munday came the Cofac-hxmy with about 300 Keels, great and fmall 'dole to the City, pining in at aRiver near the Vineyards that ly about halfa League from the Walls oftheTown. Upon this We fct the Tents on fire. Mean while I ftood upon the top of the Govcrnours houfe, with the Governourhim- ielf, and cafually efpied feveral Boats in the River before the Town: I tnereforc advifed the Governour not t^ let them tarry tnere for altho they were butFiihers Boats yet they might give intelligence to the Enemy ; whercrore he gave order imme- ? diatlv to fink them, which was forthwith put in execution i Hat afternoon the Perfiarts and Cir cm -Jar tars had taken 4 Cofacl^s, who were put to the Rack and a tcrcon feffion, two were hanged up, and other two beheaded in prefence of the Governour. T HE day following the Collonel would have confirmed me in tne Office I ti.tn fupplied, to wit, a? Lieutenant Colonel which I neverthelefs declined as be ore. This ■fame day aboutnoon the Great Dukes FlSorprelentcd us with a Pipeoritrong ; Beer,[369] ^ Beer, and a Quantity ©f Tobacco , which we diftributcd among the Soldiers givc^em Courage and keep them content. In the forepart of the night I went with the Chirurgeon to do the Rounds, which don I lay me down to flecp a little in my Tent but was quickly awaked with the Alarm, which gave notice how that the Ce?* picks approached to begin their firft ftorm , which happened about 3 a clock at the JVofnaftftfke Gate , where our Ship-nufter and the IVajwods Brother had the watch. The firft I efpied was a fquarc Body of the Enemy who approached very near, upon which I gave fire with our 12 Pounders, and was feconded by tbofc of the next Poft, who fhot very faft. Interim came the Englifh Colonel Baily to me in great haft with moftofthe Butch and German Officers, bringing news now that the City was already betrayed. The Colonel was himfelf wounded on the cheek with a Pike, as alio in two or three places on his Leg, for being all in Armour they could not hurt him elfewhere: and this he faid was done by our own Soldiery. He told me further that he had done his utmoft indeavour to pacify them and ifit were poffible to caft an odium upon the Cofacks, as Rebells; but was fain to fmother all his reafon fore againft his will and at laft glad to come offwith his Life. After a fmall conference together I advifed the Colonel to go again to his Poft, and fee if the perfwafion of other Officers had wrought any thing upon xh^Strelitz^ers: but the next news I heard was that the Strelitz.ers had maffacred all the Officers, which grieved me moft highly , becaufe that they had adventured their perfons by my advice. Neither did this bloody Adion hold up with that, for it came forward(o far that Captain iVederos who had the next Poft tomewastakenbyhisownfervant, pinion'd faft and afterward in moft cruel manner murthered by his Soldiers. The Chirurgeon of whom I have already made mention feeing this, would have thrown himfelf off the wall to avoid the danger of thofe bloody Traitors; but I did all I could to with-hold him, and at laft called to mind a certain Port-hole juftunder the Tower which might ferve us for an Exitus out of all thofe imminent dangers, in which we had certainly fuffered if we had not taken care betimes. Thro this we took our way and I charged the Chirurgeon with his Servant (being a Pole) to follow me, as alfo two of our Ships-Folk, to wit, fames Trappen , and Chrifiian Brandt. Coming below we found there two Ruffes ftood Sentinel, whom! charged to let us through* Thele not knowing any thing of the Tumult let us thro without much difficulty or Interrogations. The Chirurgeon went out before, and I follow ed, but knew not what became then of the two Seamen and the Pole. We were forced to wade thro the Ditch to the neck, aiming at the Tartarian Field Quar ters, which, as I have faid, was burnd up that it might not be an advantage to the Enemy, which place we held for the moft fafe and iecure They fhot at us mainly from the Walls, but all to little purpofe for we were got pretty far without Cannon reach, at left for fingle Bodies ; But marching a little forward we met two men, whom we fuppofed to be Cofacks , the Chirurgeon having a Firelock refolved to difcharge as he alfo did , and fo far furprifed he was that he grew defperate and throwing himfelf into the River fell a fwimming. 'When I came up with them I f underftood that they were alfo fled for fear of being maflacred by the Commonalty; upon which I called out to the Chirurgeon that they were honeftMen and under A a a the[3fo] tke fame Circumftanccs we were ourfelves, See, but could have no anfwa: from him. However not willing to leave him fo^ I Went to look out for him , and found him among the Reeds half fpent, whence I drew him out, and perceiving him to be in a way of Recovery marched forward along the River; and at laft found a Fellow fleeping in a Boat &gt; whom we awakened and compelled to bring us over to the other fide: but finding no place of ihelter orfecurity wefell down the River 5 and about 10 in the forenoon came to a Fiihing place called Trofilzen Outzjouge, where we related all what had pafTed at Aflrachan to the Fifhcrs. We would have gone farther, but the Ruffians would not go with us. However I prevailed fo far with the Chirurgeon that he was willing rather to go to Sea, than totrufthimfelftothe mercy of the Cofacks. But h^ was very loth to trufthimfelfin fuch afmallBoat, being well acquainted with the danger by tintemperate Winds, inconftant Seafons , and uncertain Tides. I had no more money by me than 7 Rubheis [about 3 lb. Sterl.] and bought a Mug-tent or Pavilion with a loaf of Bread weighing about 10 lb. and with that put off, trufting to the Providence of Almighty GOD 5 havingthe ad vantage of the Tide. After two hours rowing we met 2 Filhers Boats, to whom we related how affairs Hood at Afirachm. The Fiihers gave us very -good words and comfortable Language , promifing to affift us in what they might. We rowed as hard as we could, and bare them company to their Fifhingplace, called Outzj'otig'* 'where we met with a Ruffian Colonel, 1 Captains and 4^ StreUtz.ers. The Colonels name was Maxim Lopatim &gt; and lay in Garrifon at intending for Aft rack an , but had not as then heard of the horrid Treafon and Rebellion of the Commonaltie there, nor (o much as of the AttacqueandSiege oftheC^p^, He underftandinghow affairs ftood there, refolved to row back with us in the Boat to Terkj &gt; and advifing the two Captains to dothelike who put their Goods aboard , and tacitly left the Strelitz.ers m lvanowa Out^mg. Thus we row^ed With all our might 51illwe got the 'Cafyian Sea, ftill keeping near the Bank. After alittle rowing we efpied a Boat which rowed very hard after us: we alfo did all we could to outrow them^. but they being more expert than we in general, gained room of us, and com ing near our boat, one of the Ruffian Captains jompM over board, and was afterwards taken up by them. All the Arms wehad was my Piftol, for the Chirur geon-had thrown his into the Water , when he fwam to favehimielf without chan, as I have already, mentioned. In the Keel or Veffel that followed us were feveral Fifhers, together with the / Strelitxers, which were formerly under the Command of thofe Officers that were with us ad left at Ivanowa Outwug , who it ieems fo refented the matter that they had declared themfelves Cofacks , thro difguft that the Officers had not given them warning of the affairs of jfftrachan, w r ho probably would have bin faithfull if they had bin fo kind as toacquaint them with the matter. In ihort they clofed up with us, took, plundered, bbund and brought us back again to the Fiihing place, where the Colonel alone had the Liberty to exercifc his Devotion in the Church, but we were fecurcd with a ftrong Guard all the night long. ON Thurfday the 2^ of fuly- thcymade preparation t^bringus up to ■jifitdchun t \ and about noon we got fight or the Town: and coming to a very convenient place , tO/[37i] to land at, they went a Ihoar and divided the Ipoit, which they had taken from Being now alone I confalted with the Chirurgeon how that we might cafily make our cicape being unbound and the Boat only made faft toahalf-pike which I could very eafily manage. The Chirurgeon intimated the matter to the Colonel , defiring that he would joyn indeavours with us to getfree: but (whether out of fear, or in hopes of better ulage at the hands of-the Rebells I cannot tell) he forthwith diko- vers the defign, and gave the Rebells warning to|have a care: upon which they feta watch and guarded us fo ftri^ly that we could not make our efcape. Seeing that our Enterprife proved abortiv and ineffedual, I told the Chirurgeon that I would run a little up the Ifland and fwim over the Water to the Tartars &gt; which leffayM to doi but was followed and taken; yet had that attempt not bin in vain if I had not chanced to fall which was no fmaii difadvantage to me: however I betook me to the 'Water which I found there very (hallow, fo that, they with a little wading fetched me out. But having got me, I cannot exprefs with what cruelty they ufed me, beating me black and blew, which done, they bound me fail and threw me into the Boat, fo rowing up to the Town. By the way the Chirurgeon made a pro- pofal to them that if they would fave us alive, they (hould have 100 Rnhbels for my Ranfom and 70 for his own. They promifed to do their Indeavour for us. In the Evening we arrived at Jlftrach.m where we were brought up before the General of the Cofacs, I had no Cloaths about me fave'only a pair of leathern Breeches, which were full ofholes. The General fate at the Gates of the Bifhops Palace erofs- legg'd after the Turkifn manner drinking Brandy, and was fo drunk that hisEies roll'd in his Read. He afked the Chirurgeon who he was? and what hisFuncflion was ? which when he knew, gave him his Life, and ordered him to take care of the Cofacs that were wounded. Afterward he afked, who I was? the Chirurgeon made anfwer that I was his Companion : hefurther alked me what I could do; but the Chirurgcon leaving me, I could not return him any anfwer. The Ru(ftan Co lonel being examined , was immediately carried up to the top of a Tower called Roofcat y and hurled headlong down. From the fame Tower alio was the Vice-roy, or Way-wod , w.hofe name was Ivan Simeimowitz. Projor&amp;fshi , after many rortures thrown alio pr^ecipitantly from Top to Bottom; as alfo the Vice-Charieelor with all the Officers, of what degrej^foever they were, either thrown down , orcaftinto the 'Water. MOST dreadfull was this maflacrc which continued for fome time together; but GOD Almighty gave me an undaunted fpirit. The Co[ac General looking earneftly upon me commanded his Men to give me Brandy , and made me drink off 1 cups one after another, and then gave order to bring me into the Camp: But what became of the 2 Rujfian Czpums I cannot tell. As I pafledby to the Camp being put in a Boat that lay next to the Generals, I was efpied ofa Strelitzerwho brought news of my being ftill alive to Madam Wonder ham , the Lieutenant Colo nels 'Widdow. I have already made mention how that among the Dutch Officers that went out with the faid Lieutenant Colonel, was one Paul Rudolph his Son in Law who was the only Perfon that remained alive: feigninghimfelfin fuchextre mity to be a Cofac y for he was well acquainted wuh their fpeech and manners. 1 his ^ A aa 2 y° un S[37*1 young Gentleman hearing that Iwasftill alive came to find me out in the Boat; and during this while were whole Boat loads ofMen brought into the ftream, and thrown into the Water, being tied together fo that they could not help themfclvs with fwim- ming. In this pofture I lay my felf till Friday fune 27, expeding every moment my laft Cataftroph, That day they brought me in to a Tower, and tied me fo hard, that my blood for want of a natural reflux began tocorrupt within my Body. My Arms were pinioned, and my hands made faft behind my Back: my feet alfo were fo hard bound that I never expeded to have the ufe of them again. Lying in this Pofturc and moft lamentable ftate I (pent my Time in fighing and groaning. The Chirurgeon of whom we have already fpoke came to vifit me : I defired them to follicit for my Death, but they ever diflwaded me from it. Yetftilllinfiftedvery hard that they would make interceffion for me to the General that I might be difpat- ched, giving them a private reafon for that my earneftnefs. Now there was a Rule among the Cofackj &gt; that if any came to interceed for a Captiv that he {hould dy himfelf for him, which the Chirurgeon told me alfo, yet promifed he would ad venture himfelf to the General, and for that time took his leave. THIS night I was moft barbarouflyufed by the Cofack*) and Gogdats , a People of Vkrain io called. And in the mean time was moft fearfully vexed with Toads and other vermin that continually ran over my Body and about my head in whole fwarms. However I fpent my time in prayer as one condemned to dy and aflured of a fpeedy Death , of which (I may truly declare) I was not in the left aftraid, only feared that they would hang me up by the Heels, or put me to fome fuch lingr- ing death, with which they continually threatned me. 'ON Saturday the 28 of fane came the aforefaid Chirurgeon, and told me that the General had fent for me: and being untied I could hardly ftandupright, yet made a Ihift to hupplc after him. Being come in to the prefen ce of the General after a few idle impertinent Queftionshe afkedme bad megohome with the Chirurgeon. From Sunday to Thurfday I continued there in houfe with him, in which time I faw muchi cruelty commitcd, fome hanging up by the Feet, others with their Feet and hands chopt off left in the open ftreet to fhift for themfelves , none daring fo much as put forth a fin ger to help them. ON Thurfday 3d I was again taken and carried to the Brink of the River where I expeded to part with my Life. But the told mc, if I would pay the ico Rubbles, which the Chirurgeon had promifed them on my behalf, I might go free: which the Chirurgeon,who againft his will feigned himfelftobeaCi?/^^, was content to diiburfe for me, which afterwards I was obliged to repay upon de mand, when able. ON Sunday I was fent for by the General, who was then a Drinking at the Em perors Cellar, but nothing of moment paffed at that time he being drunk, and forced me to drink ofl feveral Bowls of Brandy and 'W^ine after one another, fothat I was affraid to difpleafe him, being (as I have elfewhereremembredj veryoutra- gious when drunk ; wherefore I took occafion to fteal out of his prefence. ABOUT this time happened many memorable pafi'ages and: cruel Examples of Tyranny, which would prove too tedious to relate. I f hould want words to exprefs[373] the moft barbarous and inhuman A £ls and Torments, which the Cofacks ftudicd to kill and torture the Inhabitants and Loyal Officers, who did not forthwith iubmit themfelvs to their unreafonable and unjuft 'Wills. On the 'Wednefday following was the Secretary Alexo Alexowits hung upup- on a Flefc-hook by the Ribbs, and fufFercd much defpightful uiagc and Tor ments before he died. The fame was done to a Noble mans Son oi Gilan. Alio two Sons of the Vice-roy , Deputy, or waywod were hung up by the^hecls, the one being a very hopefull youth of about 16 years of Age, and the other a Child of about 7 or 8 at the moft. n u The Day following they were both found alive, and the youngekat u.e u*- tcrceffion and Mediator of fome of Minions was taken down, and lav ed alive, but the eldeft Was thrown down from the Top of the 1 ower, whilit ftill alive, which was the Death his Father fuftcred. The fame day I had News how that Chriftian Brand one of my Men was Itiii alive, and was conftrainedto feignhimfelfas Cofac. On the zothof July the Cofac General departed with an inhnte num ber of fmall Shipping and feverall Thoufands of Men , drawing 20 Men out of each Company to ferve for the GarrMon at Afirachm and left there 2 Governors of equal Command and Power, the one being a Go[ac , and the other a ON the 2 of Avtgufi began a New Maflacre continuing for feveral days to gether , where takeing one day with another , were 150 Perfen-s killed , fpanng neither lex nor Age. For which reafon I began to hunt out for a Cave in the Eartn where I might fave my (elf in time of need, 'hearing of nothing but a^perpetual and inceffant maflacre 5 and a general Lamentation of Parents for their Children, Wid- dows and Orphans for their Hufbands and Fathers, and that as well among thole who had bin inftrumental and moft forward to let in the Rebells, as others that op- pofed it; a juft reward fortheir Treachery who had been afliftant in theBloodlhed of thofe who under GOD ihouldhaveprotefted them from fuchdilmalCalamines. ABOUT this time I difpatched three Letter forand had notice how that Chrifiian Brandt was fet free. It feems that he was taken for a Perfian , having a brown, fwarthy complexion, and by fuch means was fpared in the maffacre; for all the Dutch were hewn down , or otherwife difpatched, fave onely Z/. Fabrithit Son in Law to Captain Rudolph, A BO U T the fame time I had news by the Chirurgeon , how that my Mnps- company that betook themfelvs to flight widi the Shallop were rpn aftrand on the Scemk*l ox J) age ft an Coaft, a Countrey butting^ut againft the Cffptan Sea. O N the 22 of Auguft was much Tyranny committed jn- the Citjs an d people of all ages maflacred/ The Chirurgeon after a long foliciting procured a Pafpoi t to depart with a Servant to attend him, altho not without giving Security for his Return. This gave me like wife opportunity to leave the place under pretext of being his Servant. i- 1 a ON Munday in the afternoon being Aug. 2 5 weleft Ajirachan and imbarque our felves aboard a Veflel belonging to fomeMerchants, who were alio pi - laged and robbed of all they had. ^ ? ^ Aaa | JN[374] •^OHTufcday-we came to Sea, {ailing clofc by the Coaft and to the Southward. 'Vv c aiio iaw ^ filial 1 Vcflclsj or Barks which indcavoured to keep Company with us. Having pafTed Settimbo Gar a theWind was flat North, and about the Evenin? all was calm. THE Day following one of the above mentioned Shipping IiailM us , andfaid that they were bound for Terki and came from Afirachm being laden with Salt. We kept them Company along the Coaft near the broken Land which is all grown over with huge tall Reeds: we had n and iz Foot 'Water. At night oneofthofe VefTels fir ay d about a Cannon Ihot from us; and the next morning 2 Barks made up towards us and gave Fire, without doing any Execution: But when they came near us the cowardly Banians fell upon their knees anc^ begged their Lives. In each Boat were 9 Perfons and aboard of us were 46', fome Perflans, Tartars and Bouchars, but moft Banians. Coming to board us they plundered all to our very Provifion. I had about 8 Rubbles in Money and my Seal-ring which had bin once already re deemed from the Cofacs. This Ring with the Money I gave to the Chirurgeon; but they threatningto put him to the Torture when it came to his turn to be pillaged; he confcfled all and delivered up the Money and Ring, befides 4 double Ducats of his own : but found an opportunity to hide Ducats more after an efp^cial manner about his Body. W HEN the Cofacks had taken all and pillaged us of what they could find, they held a certain fort of a Council among themfelvs whattheyihoulddo with us. At la ft it was refolved after a long debate, that we ihould be faved alive but turned off to Sea, with charge not to come anigh the Coaft any more, upon pain of being thrown over board if they came to take us again. UPON this they left us , and gave us opportunity to make ufe of the Wind, which was Welterly, and about the Evening with a brilk Gale, and a dark moon we fet fail and bore up to the Sea. BUT after we had failed about 2 Leagues the 'Weather began to befomwhat boiftrous, fo that we were fain to put in at a fmall Creek ofanlfland , where we lay at Anchor till Saturday following ; at what time the 'Weather growing more calm and temperate we weighed and bore up again to the Coaft , where we imme- diatly defcried 2 Barks that made up to us , and at laft came dole by the board. The Chirurgeon and I had taken our laft Farewel of each other, expeding nothing more than Death. In Ihort, they fell a plundering us, and I to pafs for a Banjan had anointed my felf with Black tempered with Greace, and tied a Handherchdfabout my Head 1 but it was lo botchingly don that they found occafion to alk the Chi rurgeon, what for a Black Devil that I was? In the mean while they fearched very cloic for Bread and Provifion which I feeing pointed to my mouth, whereupon they were fo merciful as to return me a part of the Provifion back again. Two Da~ gtftan Merchants were thrown over board and the Chirurgeon who paffed for a Pole was moft feverely beat. They threatned that if they met us again near the Coaft that we thould have no Mercy at their hands. Meanwhile I had loft my little Com- pafs , fo that we had no other help in direfting our Courfe, than only the Sun and North-ftar. Towards the Evening it began* to blow hard again and. the Pyrats left us,[375] us, bearing up dofc to the Coaft. The Surgeon had again hid his Gold in a place where they did not once make fearch for it. THE Wind continued hard till Thurfday following, blowing moftly from North-W. and by N. and now changed again into W.N, W. which was good and favourable for us; but the Banians would in no wife give their confent that we ihould weigh Anchor, for that they thought it too high and boiftrous. BUT on Saturday the Wind continuing ft ill in the fame point, wc weighed, and vath a frefh Gale fteered away South and by Wcft^ and foon after defcrieda fmallVeflel riding at Anchor, being one ofthofe that left Aftrachan .with us: thofe aboard were Perjians and had the luck to efcape the Cofacks&gt; keeping off at Sea. When they faw who we were, they weighed and kept us company. Towards the Evening the Wind blew North-Eaft , and I found that w r e had failed too much Wefterly, I prefs'd hard that we fhould alter our courfe, but could not pre vail with them to fteer another way: fo that in the Morning we found ourfelves clofe to the Coaft, and had the Wind at Eaft and by N. With this fort of Shipping it is very difficult to fteer without n points of the Compafs Wind to their ad vantage. % HOWEVER we thought good to keep clofe to the Coaft, but towards the E ven- ing it growing calm we rowed oft to the Seaward and loft the other Veftel. Meanwhile we began to be diftrefledfor want ofProvifion, and fed of the crums of moldy Bread: and the greateft part of the Company had no more to eat, Butthe were b eft provided, and imparted to us fuch as they had. INTERIM, the Wind came about Eaft, and E. and by S. fo that we were conftrained to drop Anchor., and fo to ride three days at half a fathom X^ater. Yet growing calmer we ever now and then rowed a little. But having fpent all our wood were at a great lofs for Fewel to bake bread, of that little quantity of Meal which the banians had left: and were fain at laft to cut up fome parts of the Ship for Chips , which flood us in very good ftead. The Wind then continued Eafterly and we fteered as far Southerly as we could, tillonthe loiKpf SeptembertQW&amp;rds the Evening we came to a good place of Anchorage, near the Coaft, of 5 Foot water, where I ftept aihoar to feek up fome Wood and Herbs, or what elfe I thought might be ferviceable t© us on our Voyage. ON Thurfday being the 1 i^h. oi September we failed clofe by the Coaft which wc kept in fight till Saturday following, when as the Banians, a poor andhelplcfsv People not able to endure fuch hardfhip, prefled very hard that we fhould put afhoar, whichoutofmeerpityw 7 e were willing to do, being all wet and very cold. MExAN'WHILE we were fet upon by aparty ofC^r/^r, who now the third time plundered us : but the Chirurgcon not having time nor the conveniency to hide his Ducats as before, digged a hole and hid them in the Sand, and threw down his Mufcjuet aboutthcfameplaceforatoken to find them again. I alfo being afraid^ ran and hid my felf among the Reeds ; but they making a very narrow fcrutiny found me out: and having by me a Pfalmbook found thatpallage or Title of a Pfalm, where David is faid to have feigned himfelf mad before the Fhilifiines to efcape them, I refolyed to do the like, by which means I efcaped, When they had me[376] they difputcJ what Countreyman I was, and fome of them {aid I was a ; but others faid I was a Georgian, and to my Happincfs the latter Iway'd it. How ever (not without wounding and killing oflome of our Company they let us go, and themfelvs departed from us: W liich the Chirurgeon feeing went and after much feeking found his Gold. O N the 20 of September it was very good Weather; we therefore made ready to fet (ail. About noon being under fail we {aw about 30 on the Strand who called out to us that we {hould comeaihoar: This unwelcomfummons mainly ad ded to our fear; infomuch that one of the Vxtnians ran afhoar and fell down upon his Knees. The Boat was drawn aHioar, and after they had confulted a little together what they (hould do with us they demanded Ranfom, which was agreed upon for 3 Rubbles each Man. They were Circas and Nagayan Tartars ^ and accepted of one ofthe banians for a Pledge till the Ranfom was paid. Nv^e went about two Miles with them and left our Veffel behind us. I had with me a little Coffer of Books which I carried along with me; and wasfain to trudge afoot without either Shoes or Stoc kings thro Thiftles and Brambles, infomuch that tny Feet were all bliftcred and bloody. Towards the Evening we came in a Bay where their Shipping lay. Here I met with an Armenian whom I had formerly known at who treated mc very kindly , as alfo my Companion the Chirurgeon ; but we having in fo long a time not eaten any thing which was fitting for human food, did Anatomize what was fet before us at fuch that theobferving it, thought good to takeaway before we had half fatiffied ourappetite for fear we ihouldfurfeit our felves. HERE we tarried three Days &gt; waiting for a good Wind to go forTdr^, but that not falling out in this time are determined rather U) go by land than to flay there Wind bound', it being not above a Days Journey, yet very perillous for the Tkr- tars who continually lay in wait for diftreffed, and ftranded PafTengers, in thefe unhappy Proceedings of the Cofacks* who made the Cafpian Sea very unfafe to fail. ON Tufeday being the 30 of September wefet forward, and after a very tedious Days Travel thro Boggs and Madhes we got to a Village inhabited by Nagayan Tartars : where we took up our nights reft in the Quarter. Here we met with a Friend ofthe Chirurgeons, whom we offered 8 Ducats to condufl: us to Derbent, which he undertook to do. Here I fpoke alfo with IvanTurken Agent to his Im perial Majefty, who was a Twr^born, but a RufianPvoklyte, and had a Brother at M fcdH who was of the Reformed Religion and an intimate Friend of mine. This faid Gentleman intreated metoftay longerat7V^« , but I declined their kind offer Yet was fain to accept # of it for z Days having fo charged and overloaden my ftomach with eating that I fell fick upon it. ON the 6ih. of Ottober we fet forward for D^^ in company with the Now by the way you are to note that every day we fuffered fuch hunger, a Mans ranfom was thrown into the water , which the fuperftitious Banians hold for a fpecial ad of Piety and a Religious InjumSion. By the way we met fom Thoufand of Tartars j for whom we were not a liule affraid, they being Nagajans and notca P '' Ei&gt;ritS - ■ AFTER[377] AFTER three days travel wc came to a Village called Andre Dereepd which was fubjeft to one Chape lie , a Tartarian Prince. We ftaid here tili Munday following being the feventh of Otteber. Here I happened to fpy a Terfian who had my Pluih-Coat on, which he faid he had bought at Terky. The Fur or Lining coft me thirty five Rubbles at Mufcou\ and the Perfian was willing to fell it me again for five or fix Rubbles, but I could not accomplifh fo much Money as to purchafe it. Here we alfo came to underftand that my Ships- folk who fled in a Challop were ftranded and taken flaves. ON Thursday the tenth ditto, we came into Terku, where wa had two Armenians for our Friends; thefe alfo brought me to one of their Acquaintance for Prote(5lion&gt; where I was advifed to keep my felf very private, being a free Prize for the Tartars, Here wc alfo found Lewis Faber of whom I have alrea dy made mention, as aUo ChriJtianBrand one of my Ships-folk; who left Afira- chan three Weeks after us, and had been eight Days at Terky. ON the thirteenth we left Terkuy and hired a perfon for eight Ducats to condud us to Derbent. ON the feventeenth we paffed by 'Boynak^, where I underitood lorn of our Men were in flavery, I fent our Conduct up to the Town ( not daring appear there my felf) with Letters to advife them to perfift in the Ghriftian Faith, if they were prefs'd upon to embrace Mahometanifm with promife of doing my beft to procure their Redemption. But my Squire the Courier, thought good to give us the Bag , having already got his Money in hand, nor did I ever hear a word from them, altho I gave them directions how to write to me at Derbent. Howe ver when 1 arrived there 1 found Cornelius de ZJries , who had been my Gunner, and one Peter Arentfz. of Scevehng , who gave me 3 perfed account of the Ships-Company^ how they were taken Slaves, and whither they were car ried , (olicited by the Sultan o£ Derbent for the Redemption of our Men, who was pleafed to difpatch Letters on that behalf to the Prince of the Cdlmuc- Tartars\ but having fent two Pofts, and all to no purpofe or effed , I went to tender my thanks to the Sultan for his Civility and Indeavours ; to which he replyM, u That he was forry he could not prevail with the Tartars to anfwer 'my Dcfire, yet was willing to do us any kindneis that lay in his power ? if &lt;c We could imagine any mean whereby they might procure their Liberty, Crc. I infifted further to have fom Horfes for our ufe on the Journey which he grant ed ; but there was none to be had in all the Town, the Caravan being but newly fet forward for Scamachj. Yet finding another ready to depart, the Seamen went afoot in company of the Caravan. I fupplied them alio with ne- ceffary Proviiions, and told them that I would ftay a day, or two longer, to lec if I could get fom Horfes and then follow them. But it was in vain , for I could not get any, wherefore I followed the Caravan and coming at Scab ran. which is reckoned the halfway, we were informed that there were feveral Hackneys in the Town , which we, hired. ON the twenty ninth we arrived at Scamachi: where we'found John Struys Bbb ^ ur{378-] ©ur Sail-Maker ) who was bought by a Folifh Ambafladour^ whofe AfTiftancje I defired in an Addrefs to the Chin ; 'tis true he feemed willing to do us firch a favour if it could have been done without much Trouble. Here I delivered a Requeft to the Chan, and had Audience, wherein I made a plain demonftration of the Injury our Men fuftered by the Calmucs ^Crc. He promifed me to do his beft for them, but all was to no purpofe, fo that I was fain to take up feventy five Abbas upon fecLiriry oi: a Banian Merchant, which was to be paid at Ifpahau within feven Weeks time and twenty five Abba Ufe, or Intereft; but in cafe of failure of payment in Ifpahan , to be paid atwithin thtce Months with fifty Abbts Intereft ; the Chirurgeon being, my fecurity^ Here I alio reckoned with the Chirurgeon, and gave him an Obligation under my hand for what I had received of him, as alio for what he remained fecurity for me at Scamac 1 y* 0 N the fifteenth I left Scam achy having with ire Cetnelim the Gunner. P. Arentfz. ftaid with the Chirurgeon, and f, Strujs, L. Fabritim and Chriflian l&amp;rand with the Bolifh Envoy. 1 had very much difficulty by the way to come to Ifpahan y yet by the Provi-* dencc of Almighty God arrived here the tenth of March, and have Refidence for the time, in the Dutch Lodge: where I find Sr # Frederic Bent Prefident for the Baft-India Company, to whom, as well as the Gentlemen his Affi- ftants, I am infinitely obliged to for many Civilities Ihown me. Cornelius the Gunner they have- fent away for Cameron, I alfo caufed f- Strujs and the faid Gunner, with another Fore-Maft Man to fign a Declaration how they fled away from Ajfrachan and left me and the Matter afhoar. S I R, I have not elfe to write, but fearing by this prolixity to have tired your Patience, I ceafe to be more tedious, and commit you to the Prote&lt;5Hon of the Moft High GOD, who that he would in Mercy vouchfafe us a happy meeting is the only and hcartv Prayer,., of. lour obedient Servitor tAVID BUTLER.
