The Shaikh of Dubai asreed to this consideration and also agreed to provide a building free of rent for the post office and for the residence of the postmaster. The Government of India v ; as addressed to on this subject by the P.R rith a view to make arrangements to send a postmaster there. The G.of.I. replied that the monthly income of the post office at Dubai was estimated to [is 82-14 p.m. and that if the office is retained as an extra departmental branch office the loss on its working would ) amount to te 52/-p.ra. whereas if sub-office is opened it would work at a loss of k 144/-p.m. The P.&amp;.T.Deptt. therefore did not agree to open a sub^office unless the External /flairs Department was prepared to bear the loss.The Political Resident thereon viewed that that in the present state of financial stringencythe proposal was not of sufficient importance to warrant afeking G.of I. to meet any possible loss. In January 1940, the O.of.I. wts again addressed to on this subject by the P.R. giving them an estimated cost of monthly income amounting to [is 260/-p. m., if the sub-office is opened at Dubai against an estimated cost o fns 227/-p.m. by the P. &amp;.

The Political Agent , however, did not agree with the phrase’’present disorganisation of mail services” and emphasised that due consideration should be given to the probable revenue from the sources given in para 5 and 6 of his. letter No.717 dated 14th November 1929.(P.215 Vol.I)and stated thatthat there should be no consideration for delaying any further the realisation of this project. The P.R.thereupon urged the C.of I. that the opening of a sub-of 'ice at Dubai should not be delayed and that if the P. T. '.Deptl. still demand a guarantee of loss their attention should, be drawn to the substantial profit they have earned at Bahrein. The G.of India in July 1941 denied this project but in November last informed that 1 the P.d.T.Deptt have decided to convert the existing extra departmental branch into a sub-office at Dubai en an experimental basis for one year.No .433-27A.

At present we have two planes a week each way, which is as many as je had before the 'all-up” air mail scheme started. As regards sea mails: Although the Fast Mail services are at present cancelled, they never affected i&gt;ubai; and the Blow Mails are running fortnightly as usual. ) y(7^ J, 3. With reference to ^laragraph 3 of ny letter Fo.737 dated 14th November 1939, forwarded to the Resident under Mr. 'Ceightman’s demi-official Ho.2192 dated 13th December, the number of letters for July 1940 to Basrah, Bahrain and Karachi was 380, which agrees exactly with sub-paragraph (b) of my letter, and shows that the volume of sea mail has not decreased* 4 , As regards air-mail (paragraph 4 of the letter under reference); the carriage of documents to Basrah is stonned/stopped under war conditions# The weight of mil to Bahrain shows a slight decrease as against the figures i.cr July 1939; and there is a marked decrease in the figures for Karachi. The figures for July 1940 are Bahrain 60.8 oz. Karachi 244 oz. 5 . Consideration should, however, be given to the probable revenue from the sources given in paragraph 6 of my letter under reference; and these have possibly not been estimated as highly as they might, -or example, the Residency Agent reports that the value of currency notes carried by air freight during July 1940 was To Bahrein It. 7,850/- To Karachi E2.42,900/*-. A consideration of the ?£oney Order fees payable on these sums ought to satisfy thy postal authorities cf the financial soundness of the scheme. 6 .

Establishment of a Post Office at Dubai.Copy of Demi Official letter No.643-27/1 dated the 28th November 2940 from Captain H.D.Metcalfe, Political Officer, Trucial Coast, to the Hobble leiut-Colon&amp;l C .G.Prior,C .1 .E., Political Hesident in the Persian Gulf. Subject:- Establishment of a Post Office at uubai. As long ago as 1936, the Shaikh of Sharjah asked for a Post Office. Correspondence ensued and later it was decided, f for obvious reasons, that any Post Office should be established at Dubai. More correspondence followed, the Shaikh of Dubai promised to be most helpful and then, as far as I remember from the Bahrain files, the matter developed into a dispute between the Political Agent and the Karachi Division of Post Offices and the question was shelved. 2. The area known as the Trucial Coast consists of seven Shaikhdoms, has 450 miles of coast line and stretches up to a 100 miles inland. The population is at least 100,000 and the combined Shaikhly income is 5£ lakhs, though if mdian standards of taxation were to be adopted, this amount could easily be quadrupled. There are two good ports, of which Dubai is by £ar the more important, a large pearl industry, prospects of considerable oil development, large red oxide mines just off the coast on Abu Musa island, and Dubai is a regular halt for the British Overseas Airways Corporation^ flying boats. 3. The volume of trade in the area is indicated by the following figures. The exports of specie averages over lakhs a year and import over 1^ lakhs; the export of currency notes, gold and pearls by air freight alone during the six months 1st May to 31st October 1940 was valued at about 5 lakhs of rupees ( £.37,769.0.0 ) and during the last year 8,000 tons of cargo have been imported into Dubai and 420 tons exported. 4. These figures do not include a very considerable dhow trade and I think it may therefore be said that the Trucial Coast corresponds in size and importance to many an Indian i district /district. Yet it has not even one fully fledged Post Office, and the almost unbelievable, but unfortunately true, situation has arisen that, despite the fact that all British overseas Airways Corporation flying boats halt at Dubai for at least half an hour and sometimes even stay the night there, we can &lt; neither send nor receive letters by air mail A'i'his of course is only one hardship, lack of registration, V.P.P., Postal Ord er and Savings Bank facilities being others of a major character 5* At present, there is a branch Post Office, which only accepts sea mail, when the British Indian Steamers call once a fortnight. The branch Post-master is Mirza Salih, representative of Gray,Mackenzie &amp; Company Limited and a man of standing. He served in the Political Department during the last war and his brother is Khan Sahib Mirza Ali* of your office. He receives Rs.20/- per month for his present labours but provided he were given a full-time qualified postal clerk, he is willing to accept financial and supervisory responsibility for a proper Post Office, even to the extent of providing a suitable security, for a little or no increase in his 'Salary', according of course to .the amount of security that may be demanded. 6. The shaikh of Dubai has promised a suitable building rent free, (sufficiently large to accommodate a clerk and his family ), protection and guarantees against theft. f \ ’''i/y y 7. Last year Howes forwarded figures to Bahrain to show that a reasonable profit was almost inevitable. Extracts from his letter are enclosed and I think you will agree that the figures are very conservative, especially as they make no attempt to estimate Bevenue arising from the facilities which we now lack. Estimating the cost of the staff to be a maximum of Hs.100/- per month end office expenses at a maximum of Ks.50/- , ill per month and without looking ahead to potential profits, the assured profits should be sufficient. There thus seems no ^ . obstacles in the way of the proposal, except the obstinacy of the Indian postal Department. £ J^hope you will excuse my bringing the matter to your personal /-V personal attention 'but there is a large and vocal demand^ or full postal facilities. Their establishment gives obvious prospects of a handsome profit, which should appeal to the Postal Department as a business concern, and in my opinion, the size and importance of the area to be^erved demands full and sympathetic consideratior from th^tDepartment in its capacity as a public utility company* I trust therefore that you will be able to see your way to bring the wholerquestion to the notice of the Government of India 01 if this has already been done, to continue to fight our case for us. ; The need is really urgent and I feel that uhe public spirit being i shown locally to satisfy it is not being reciprocated as it should be by the Postal Authorities. r '1 A I *^v.. 1.0.No.21-14/6 iMxed 5th January, 1941. n . / // Thank you for 'our demi-official letter No.678-12/40 on the subject of a Post Office at Dubai.

I have been pressing for the establishment of a post office at Dubai or Sharjah for the past four years and 1 dor/1 want to do any thing to discourage the intention now. At the same time I am not in favour of any member of our local staff becoming involved in postal arrangements except if by not co-operating the intended facility isI notice that Dubai is mentioned as the situation of the post office, and it occurs to me that Capfc. Metcalfe or the Residency Agent may be able to propose a suitable person for 'trie job other than a member of our staff. I imagine that if Capt. Metcalfe could be persuaded, to make a direct recommendation it would be accepted and I fish you would try to arrange things in this way. Thank you for your IPG. 1/lu. 1/774 of the 5th March on the subject of the above. The Political Officer,Sharjah has been handling this question quite vigoursly during the last few months, andhe has in fact ear- # marked both an office and personnel in Dubai to handle Post Olfice traffic should the Indian Government decide to establish facilities in these p^rts. As you say, we do not wish to become involved in it, although we will do 11 we can to assist if asked. fou can safely leave the mutter in the hands of Metcalfe and I will arrange things through hii , and will let you know from time to time how things progress.

This correspondence began last July, when the Superintendent reported that there were over S$ 52,000 in currency notes at Dubai and asked the advice of this Agency as to the best means of clearing them; the difficulty chiefly arose from the fact that notes could only be’ disposed of at Dubai at a discount. In reply he was advised to instruct the Sub Postmaster, Dubai, to send the surplus notes in question to the Postmaster, Bahrain, who would obtain from the Eastern Bank here a draft on Karachi at par, and in future to send surplus notes in his account bag to his Karachi Head Office* / 2.. The Superintendent of Post Offices reply indicated that he did not regard this as a satisfactory solution, * owing (apparently) to the difficulty of obtaining air fneigh for notes and the rarity ajith which steamers call at Dubai.* In view of the facts thatrboth Messrs .Gray Mackenzie &amp; Co., and Messrs. Dhamanmal Issardae, one of the leading mercan tile firms in Dubai, have recently asked for permission to export considerable quantities of notes from Bahrain to Dubai(the latter estimated their requirements as Rs one lakh monthly), (b) that this Agency sends monthly from here some Rs 5,000 in cash,to the Residency Agent,Sharjah, for his requirements and payments made by him and (c) that the R.A.F. at Sharjah must require considerable sums in Rupee notes for monthly payments, it does not seem that the Dubai Post Office should experience great difficulty in disposing of its surplus notes/ Will you kindly ascertain and let me know the approximate average monthly value of the Post Office*s surplus cash, and let me have your comments on the question of its disposal, and particularly whether you see any reason why your requirements of cash shouldnot be obtained from*the Post Office, Dubai? If in any particular month the latter had not sufficient cash available for your requirements, this Agency could always send the balance from here. Your receipts of cash from the Dubai Post Office will in any case have to beadjusted in the books of this Agency (a s you have no ficcountg/and the only difference from present procedure as far as you are concerned would be that this Agency would authorise the Dubai Post Office to pay you your requirements/ by a general authority in the case of regular recurring^payments and by specific authority each month in the case of varying payments, e.g. Travelling Allowance and Contingencies,/instead of sending them all from here• / for Political Agent, BahrainCont-ii. 0^ ['1% ! . ftr$ 3 » i INDIAN POSTS AKD T£LEGRAPES DEPARTMENT. taM 8UP0T.

A brief summary of the 'Dubai Post Office' is given below:- V? Alter a lenghty correspondence the Postal Department informed us (page 224 file 14/5 Vol.I) that they intended to establish a ’’full fledged” sub-post office at Dubai and asked for our assistance in a securing a suitable building for this purpose. We made the necessary arrangements and informed them (page 227) p that the building was ready for immediate occupation. After that the letter at page 3 of Vol.II revealed that the idea of a 'full- fledged” post office had been abandoned by the postal authorities. We asked them to explain this (page 4) and their reply was nothing but am effort to produce excuses one way or the other.(page Si de tailed ^ Bushire A SERxiHEZHg letter however was written to thsmxRpcix (page 11) explaining that the”disorganisstion of mails” etc was only an excuse and that there would be sufficient income also if the post office was opened. Bushire referred this matter to Government of India -page 13, but no reply to this letter has apparently been received so far. The letter at page 21 now again shows an effort of the postal authorities to/ avoid opening a proper post office at Dubai. I suggest that we should refer this matter to Bushire and I submit a draft for your approval. ^^ ) sT 5 b Ref,?.U.C .87. It appears that formerly the postmaster Dubai x was clearing his surplus cash through Grey Mackenzie at Dubei but as recently discount is being charged in the local market on currency notes Gray Mackenzie are not now prepared at par to accept currency notes/from the postemster as before.The consequence is that the surplus cash inrhand with the post master Dubai is being held up and could not be remitted to the postal authorities in India as before.I saw the postmas ter,Behreih, on this subject. He suggested that:- (a) The postmaster at Dubai should be instructed to transfer his Es 52000, to the postmaster at Bahrein,by enclosir^ the amount in a /locked leather' bag and then despatch it to Bahrein through post either by sea or by air.The postmaster Bahrein on receipt of the amount will manage to get its equivalent in draft at par from the Eastern Bank,Bahrein, and then will remit the amount to Karachi. (b) In future the postmaster Dubai should dispose of his surplus cash by sending it in.his account bag direct to his Karachi head office either by sea or by air whichever is convenient to him.He further said that there is no other better way for the disposal of surplus cash from Dubai. May reply as above. D.F./. ‘submitted pi. • 15/7/42 cJL' (fcJA)C igK il Ijjj-§ x - tr !8 g e * R' fers to page 81 and page 19 of the note sheets. Para.9. As there is no bank at Dubai like Bahrein the only permanent arrangement that can be suggested for clearance of surplus cash(notes)otherwise than by air is that the postmaster should obtain a cheque from Messrs Gray Mackenzie against his surplus cash at a discount rate prevalent at Dubai and then remit the. i cheque by air along with his cash account aoeount. bag to the Karachi Head Offiice t or,to avoid risk of the loss of cash in a lump sum by air, he surplus cash at the end of the month(sey ?s 12,000/ ) could be despatched by air in £ successive instalments of Es 4000/-each, instead of sending &amp; 12000/-by sir at a time.
