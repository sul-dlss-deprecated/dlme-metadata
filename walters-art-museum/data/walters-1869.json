A third governor was once between them, but both his figure and his name have been removed. This unique sculpture must have been combined with the statue of a god or king. It is possible that the work was once part of a larger group that may have shown all the provincial governors of Upper and Lower Egypt. The removal of the middle figure may either have been a \"damnatio memoriae\" to destroy the commemoration of the depicted person, or to replace his image by the figure of another person.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/5539", "Provenance": "Henry Walters, Baltimore [date and mode of acquisition unknown];  Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": "12th Dynasty", "OnView": 1, "PublicAccessDate": "2008-09-25T17:13:39.203", "Creator": "Egyptian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_22.373_3QtrRtFnt_DD_T15-tms.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_22.373_3QtrRtFnt_DD_T15-tms.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_22.373_3QtrRtFnt_DD_T15-tms.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_22.373_3QtrRtFnt_DD_T15-tms.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_22.373_3QtrRtFnt_DD_T15-tms.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1543485", "ExhibIDs": "2623, 3229, 3241", "Images": "PS1_22.373_3QtrRtFnt_DD_T15-tms.jpg, PS1_22.373_Fnt_DD_T08.jpg, PS1_22.373_Top_DD_T08.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Centre Street: Second Floor: Egyptian Art"}
