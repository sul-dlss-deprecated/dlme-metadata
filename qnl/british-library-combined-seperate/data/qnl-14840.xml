It is stated that Shaikh Rashed's forces had taken a ship from Heydar Ally and this was alarming since they most likely assumed the vessel was English and hence may interfere with and attack other English vessels in the future. An additional note from January 4th states that Shaikh Rashed is said to have expressed concern that his people had taken the vessel and that he had secured its cargo, untouched. The arrival of Colonel James Capper and Mr. Dighton is also reported.
