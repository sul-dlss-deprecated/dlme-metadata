Indeed the Government of India have already stated that they wish to take over all equipment at Bushire. However that may be, the boat was built in about 1G30 and, while good enough for harbour work, I doubt its ability to cross the Gulf.

Donaldson Esquire, India Office, London.mam•p^son Mr.Harj Mr.Donaldson A.ia *' Please see Colonel Hay’s letter below. The case for providing a launch for the Residenqy in Bahrein is not a very strong one. While the Resident was in Bushire he had a launch which he has left behind him for the use of the Consul-General as he considered it essential to the execution of his duties • Now that he is in Bahrein* however, there seems to be no reason why he should not share a launch with the Political Agency or even charter one fran the Navy if he requires one, * The occasions on which he requires a launch must be very few and the reasons given in his letter indicate that he would only make occasional use of it. This question is connected with the suggestion made by Hallows recently that an aircraft should be made available to the political authorities in the Gulf for touring purposes and if this suggestion is accepted, the need of the Political Resident for the launch will very largely have disappeared. If a launch were to be provided the cost would have to be met entirely by H.M.G. as the Government of India stated in their letter to the Political Resident on the subject of the projected dispensary at Dohah in Qatar, that they would not undertake any new expenditure as long as the question of ultimate responsibility in the Gulf was undecided, j SfiM JW ^•'*7 J v .A*' 1^' ^ ^CONFIDENTIAL /\ D.O. No. 132 - S. 2 PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY, BAHRAIN. the 20 th January, 1947. &gt; / 19^1 : When I was in London I discussed the question of a launch for the Persian Gulf Residency at Bahrain and you agreed that I should put up a case for one. 2. The Residency while it was at Bushire had a launch of its own which I refrained from bringing across as I considered its retention by the Consul essential for the proper performance of his duties. 7 3. The Residency here is situated on the sea-front and enjoys the use of the Royal Navy's jetty. My officers and I frequently have to visit or send messages to His Majesty's Ships one of which is usually anchored off Jufair, and a launch is from time to time required for myself and Vy staff for embarkation on the Nearchus when going on tour and on similar occasions. The wharf at Sitra which is fairly constantly used by us for embarkation and disembarkation is 5 miles away by sea and 15 by land and it is therefore much more economical for us to use sea transport. Further there are islands and reefs round Bahrain which form the subject of considerable correspondence and with which the Political Resident has to make himself familiar. At present when I require a launch I have to borrow one from the Royal Navy or the Political Agency which I consider an ignominious position for an officer of the status of Political Resident. An officer who is more or less in charge of about two thousand miles of sea-board should at least be allowed a launch of his own. 4. In the above .... E. P. Donaldson, Esquire, C.M.G., India Office, London.page 2 4 . In the above circumstances I do not consider that a launch for the Residency can in any way be accounted a luxury. There is no doubt however that the provision of one will add to the amenities of the Residency at Jufair and help to mitigate the severity of the hot weather for the Political Resident and his staff. This I regard as a point in favour of'the proposal. / 5. It so happens that there is a sea-plane tender at Bahrain which the Disposals Officer, Baghdad, is willing to sell for Government purposes at £ 850, its price otherwise being £ 1 , 000 . I have inspected this tender and consider it fully suited for the purpose in view. There are other candidates for it and I would request therefore that if the principle that this Residency should be provided with a launch is accepted telegraphic sanction may be accorded to its purchase. 6 .

So far as the Supply Side of this department is concerned the case is now closed. I would suggest that if you wish to telegraph to the Government of India and/or the political Resident, regarding the shipment of this engine you might approach the Shipping Side, in say a month's time to con firm that the consignment has been shipped and to ascertain tie serial number of the vessel on which it sailed.

We have written to Mr. Khalil Bin Ebrahim Lanoo informing him that his order No. 140, placed in November 1941, is now being dealt with. We hope to have the engine and equipment ready for despatch about four weeks hence and shall then be in a position to give you shipping weight s and measurements. The last paragraph in your letter is not understood, but we feel that we are correct in assuming that the order for which permission to execute has been given by the Admiralty, is, in fact, the order placed by Mr. Kanoo as ■when ne confirmed it by letter he sent us an original letter addressed to him by the 'I Political Agent, Bahrein.

In reply to ycur letter of the l?th inst., we write to advise that since addressing you on 24th November, 1941• the position in regard to the execution of expert orders has changed completely, owing to the placing of Government Contracts of high priority for engines of this and smaller models.

This order has been submitted to the authorities with request for permission to execute, but we regret to have to advise that no priority has been granted and that the order cannot, therefore, be dealt with until the completion of Government Orders which we have in hand. We regret that it is not possible to give you any estimate of delivery as the probability is that we shall receive further high priority orders before completion of those which we have in hand now. This would have the effect of making delivery on your order practically indefinite. Yours faithfully, THE HERGIUS COMPANY, LTD.
