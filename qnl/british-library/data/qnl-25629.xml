For a token of this remember bow in 1327 I with my Arabs helped them against the Arabs, to save Ebhah from those who were besieging it, and to •preserve the name of the Government in honour: and remember how again m the next year I helped them with my armies, which I entrusted to one of my sons* for indeed, we were one with the Government, until the Committee of Union and Progress rose up, and strengthened itself, and laid its hands on Power Consider how since then ruin has overtaken the State, and its pos- sessions have been torn from it, and its place in the world has been lost: - until now it has been drawn into this last and most fatal war. All this they have done, being led away by shameful appetites which are not for me to set forth, but which are open and a cause for sorrow to the Moslems of the whole world, who have seen this greatest and most noble Moslem Power broken in pieces, and led down to ruin and utter destruction. Our lament is also for so many of its subjects. Moslems and others alike, whose lives have been sacrificed without fault on their part. Some have been treacherously put to death, others cruelly driven from their homes as though the calamities of war were not enough. Of these calamities the greatest share has fallen upon the Holy Land. The poor and even the families of substance have been made to sell their doors and windows, yea, even the wooden frames of their houses, for bread, after they had lost their furniture and all their goods. Not even so was the lust of the Union and Progress fulfilled. They laid bare all the measure of their design, and broke the only bond that endured between them and the true followers of Islam. They departed from their obedience to the precepts of the Book. With the countenance of the Grand Visier of the Ottoman Empire, the Sheikh - el- Islam, the Ulema, the Ministers and the Notables, one of their papers called the “ Ijtihad ”, published in Constantinople things unworthy of the Prophet (the Prayer and Peace of God be upon him) and spoke evil of him (God forbid!). Then the Union and Progress rejected God’s word c&lt; A man shall have twice a woman’s share” and made them equal. They went further, and removed one of the five corner stones of the Eaith, even the fast in Ramadhan, by causing the soldiers in garrison in Mecca, Medina and ^Damascus to break their fast for new and foolish reasons, taking no account of the ordinance of God saying “ Those of you who are sick or on a journey, * * * Yea, they went further. They made weak the person of the Sultan ; and robbed from him his honour, forbidding him to choose for him self the chief of his personal cabinet. Other like things they did to sap the foundation of the Khalifate. r Therefore it had been clearly our part and our necessary duty to separate ourselves from them, and renounce them and their obedience. Yet we would not believe their wickedness, and tried to think that they were the imagin ings of evil-doers to make a division between us and the Government. We bore with them until it was open to all men that the rulers in Turkey were Enver Pasha, Jemal Pasha and Tallat Bey, who were doing whatsoever they pleased. They made their guilt manifest when they wrote to the Judge of the Sacred Court in Mecca, traducing the verses in the Cow, and laying upon him to reject the evidence of believers outside the Court, and to consider only the deeds and contracts engrossed within the Court. They made manifest their guilt when they hanged in one day twenty one of the most honourable*and most enlightened of the Moslems, among them Emir Omar el Jezair, Emir Arif el Shehabi, Shefik Bey Moayad, Shukri Bey el Asli, Abdel Wahab, Tewfik el Bassat, Abd el Hamid el Zahrawi, Abd el Ghani el Areisi, and their learned companions. To destroy so many, even of cattle at one time, would be hard for men void of all natural affection or mercy. And if we suppose they had some excuse foi* this evil deed—by what right did they carry75 away to strange countries the innocent and most miserable families of those ill- fated men ? * * * Children, old men, and delicate women, bereaved of their natural protectors, were subjected in exile to all foul usage, and even to tortures, as though the woes they had already suffered were not chastisement % 'l enough. Did not God say “ No punishment shall be inflicted on anyone for the sins of another ” ? * # * Let us suppose they found for themselves some reason for ill-treating the harmless families of their victims : but why did they rob them of their properties and possessions that alone remained to beep them from death by famine ? And if we suppose for this evil deed also an excuse or reason; how shall we find pardon for their shattering the tomb of our most righteous and upright Lord and Brother, El Sayed el Sheriff Abd el Kader el Jezairi el Hassani, whose bones they have polluted, and whose dust they have scattered abroad ? We leave the judgment of these misdeeds, which we have touched so briefly, to the world in general and to Moslems in particular. What stronger proof can we desire of the faithlessness of their inmost hearts to the religion, and their feelings towards the Arabs, than their bombardment of that ancient House, which God has chosen for His House, saying “ Keep my house pure for all who come to it” * * * a House so venerated by all Moslems? From their fort of Jyad when the revolt began they shelled it. The first shot struck a yard and a half above the Black Stone. The second fell three yards short of it, so that the flame leapt up, and took hold upon the Kiswa. Which when they saw, the thousands and thousands of Moslems raised a lamentable cry running to and fro and then shouted in fierce anger, and rushed to save it. They had to burst open the door, and mount upon the roof, before they could quench the flames. Yet a third shell fell upon the tomb of Abraham, and other shells fell in and about the precincts, which they made a target for their guns killing every day three or four who were at prayer within the mosque till they prevented the people coming near to worship. This will show how they despised His House, and denied it the honour given it by believers. We leave all this to the Moslem world for judgment. Yes we can leave the judgment to the Moslem world, but we may not leave cur religion, and our existence as a people to be the plaything of the ■Unionists. God (Blessed be he) has made open for us attainment of freedom and independence, and has shown us a way to victory, to cut oft the hand of the oppressors, and to cast out their garrison from our midst. We have attained independence—an independence of the rest of the °“°“ which is still groaning under the tyranny of our enemy. Oui independence is complete, absolute, not to be laid hands on by an y ' aggression and our aim is the preservation of Islam and the uplittim, o i ; standard in the world. We fortify ourselves on the noble religion, which is This is what we have done, in accord with the dictates of our religion Islam may be confirmed. We beseech the Lord of Lords for the sake rightly for giveth all things, to grant us prosperity, and to dueo o the welfare of the faith and the faithful. We depend upon God the All-Powerful, whose defence is sufficient for us.

From—The British High Commissioner, Egypt, Cairo, To—His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla (repeated to Foreign Office, London). C Clear the line. Your telegram to Secretary of State for India, No. 606-S. No further news from Hedjaz of military position round Medina has been received. Everything seems to depend for moment on situation at Rabegh, which may later on threaten Jeddah if Sheikh is not disposed of. Danger to Jeddah may render stoppage of pilgrimage advisable if place holds out and stores of arms and supplies collected there remain available for the Turks. I expect definite news in two or three days as operations against Rabegh are now proceeding. Decision in Egypt is that as long as there is reasonable chance of success it would be unwise to prevent pilgrimage, and pilgrimage arrangements are therefore proceeding. It appears from your telegram that same view is held in India. If it can be done without exciting comment, it might perhaps be better to delay first pilgrim ship, should it not already have started, to September 10th, when second ship was to start (see your telegram of August 26th, No. 972-W.). I hope to send more definite news before that date. 134 Telegram P., No. 4555, dated the 5th (received 6th) September 1916. From—The Arab Bureau, Basrah, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. Bin Sand in reply to Chief Political Officer’s letter of June 25th, copy of which was sent to Bureau on July 9th, has sent long letter to Chief Political Officer, dated July 25th. Eollowing gist may be of present interest pending- receipt of copy by post. ° Referring to disappointment expressed by Chief Political Officer at his not having moved against Bin Rashid, he explains that his expedition against A1 Murrah was an urgent necessity and in our joint interests in that had it not been undertaken Ibn Rashid would have been joined by the A1 Murrah who would have given us trouble. He says in conclusion that it was futile for him to think of attacking Hail or entering into general war with Turks in absence of guns and ammunition. He says in commenting on news sent him regarding Sheriff that he was pleased to get it, because it meant a severe blow to Turks in any case and perhaps the complete expulsion of Turks from Arabia. He proceeds, however to remark that he has been caused considerable apprehension by official com* munique, referring, as it does, to “ the Arabs ” as a whole, and it becomes necessary for'him to remind us that between himself and Sheriff there has been feud for years on account of Sheriff’s persistent endeavours to interfere among settlements and tribes of Nejd. This he has always opposed and he and his tribesmen will never tolerate any control on the Sheriff’s part or interference within their boundaries which are well defined and recoo-nised. ' He expresses his own belief that it was the Sheriff’s original intention tn play off British against Turks and to induce Turks by this means to grant him independence guaranteed by Germany. He recommends us in conclusion to give Sheriff just enough assistance to ensure protraction of the strucMe troopsto IrTq?

I also forward a copy of the enclosure referred to. Copy to— His Excellency the Governor and Commander-in-Chief, Straits Settlements. His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General, Batavia, Java. Mr. Petrie. C. R. S. S. No. 9817 (G), dated the 15th August 1916. From—The General Officer Commanding the troops, Straits Settlements, To—The Secretary, War Office, London, S. W. With reference to my cipher cablegram No. 958 of the 7th instant, I have the honour to enclose a copy of Syed Omar Alsagoff’s letter referred to therein, placing his house property in Jeddah unconditionally at the disposal of the Bj itish Government. I have passed the original on to His Excellency the Governor and Commander-in-Chief, Straits Settlements. Mr. Alsagoff is an Arab merchant of Singapore having business relations with Jeddah, Mecca and elsewhere. He is a Straits-born British subject of Arab decent and owns considerable property in the Colony as well as in Arabia. 9j. At one time he was in great favour at the Ottoman Court, and for the services rendered by him to that Government in the past he has been decorated by the Sultan of Turkey with the orders of Osmanieh and Medjidie. 3. At the beginning of the war with Turkey his sympathies were nominally with the Sultan of Turkey, but he has given no outward indication or done anything to indicate that such was really the case. However, since the steps taken by me at the very outset of the revolt to guide in an unosten tatious way Muhammadan feeling in the Ear East, as far as possible, and to draw attention to the misrule of Turkey and its domination by Germany,78 Syed Omar Alsagoff was one of the first leading Arabs to throw off the mask of nominal allegiance to the Ottoman power and acknowledge the righteousness of the Sheriff’s cause. His sympathies are now so unreservedly on the side of the Sheriff and are anti-Turk (and therefore on the side of the British) that he did not hesitate to send the Sheriff a wire of congratulation on the occasion of the Ramzan Id, and openly published in the local press both his message and the reply he received from the Sheriff. 4. Syed Omar Alsagoff is, owing to his position here, a leader, and the action taken by him has given the lead to others who, owing to previous teachings, were hesitating what to do. The action of Syed Omar Alsagoff will have a good effect here, and this influence may possibly spread through out this part of the world. Dated Singapore, the 3rd August 1916. From— Syed Omae Alsagoff, an Arab merchant of Singapore, To —Brigadiee-Genbral D. H. Ridout, C.M.G., Fort Canning, Singapore. I was very pleased to see a public announcement in the paper that the Port of Jeddah was open for pilgrims trade. I am sure the tidings will be received by the Muhammadans in general with great satisfaction, and I am sure that we are thankful to the British Government for these facilities. I am taking this opportunity of expressing my personal thanks to the Govern ment and of requesting you to convey to Government my assurance of willingness to do any service they may desire. I have considerable house property in Jeddah which I place unconditionally at the disposal of the British Government and would feel it a privilege if it could be some slight service to them. 137 Telegram P., No. 4523, dated (and received) the 8th September 1916. From—The Arab Bureau, Basrah, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. My telegram, dated September 5th, No. 4455. Following is summary of further letter mainly regarding Sheriff received from Ibn Saud, dated August 15th:— Begins. Letters have been received from Sheriff asking Ibn Saud for alliance and assistance. Ibn Saud has replied that he will respond to best of his power as regards “assistance”. As regards “alliance”, whereas he himself has never had designs upon Hedjaz, the Sheriff on the other hand has endeavoured habitually to intrigue among Ibn Saud’s tribes and territories. If Sheriff’s desire for alliance is sincere, he should give a solemn undertaking to abstain from all interference among Ibn Saud’s subjects and in his limits. Ends. , Ibn Saud, commenting on the above, remarks that he has no personal wish to ally himself with Sheriff, hut has entertained proposal, firstly, because we desired it, and secondly, in hope of expelling Turks. If his relations with the Sheriff, he continues, are merely a concern of their own, he will comply with request for alliance in the event of a satisfactory reply being received. Should, however, the Sheriff’s reply give the impression that his intention is to deceive Ibn Saud and seek to exert control over him, then Ibn Saud will take steps to protect his own interests. If his relations with Sheriff are, on the other hand, a matter of concern to us and of importance to our policy, he will be guided by our wishes. He will make a further reference to me in any case on getting Sheriff’s reply. Please see Sheriff’s letter, dated November 5th, 1915, with reference to foregoing. High Commissioner specifically assumed in his reply of Decem ber 13th that Sheriff’s recognition of our existing Treaties with Arab Chiefs\ 4 79 * ? applied to te All territories included in Arab Kingdom As far as we are concerned, it has been decided, or so we earnestly hope and understand, to regard this latter monster as defunct.^ Can we safely assume, however, that it is also dead in mind of Sheriff ? It is in any case very necessary to inform Bin Saud definitely that our adherence to terms of Articles 1 and 2 of our Treaty with him of December 26th, 1915, is not, and will not be, prejudiced by any present or future undertakings between us and Sheriff and that it is highly important in the meanwhile that he should unite with Sheriff in championing common cause of tribes and chiefs of Arabia, whose eman cipation is one of chief features of British policy. Whether terms of our Treaty with Bin Saud should not be communicated to Sheriff at the same time is a matter for consideration. Bin Saud’s messenger is waiting, but I await comment before replying to him.

I have the honour to forward herewith letters from Commander L. N. Turton, in Command of H. M. S. “Northbrook ” and Lieutenant L. F. Nalder, R. N. Y. R., Political Officer of the Southern Red Sea Patrol, showing the difficulties which arose with Idrisi with regard to the possession of Kunfida, and the creditable settlement they were mainly instrumental in obtaining. 2. There is no doubt that we took an active part in establishing the Idrisi in Kunfida, and that we did so earlier than he himself desired, though not earlier than his own agents urged. The Turks, at the time, were in possession of Kunfida, and it was against them that the Idrisi was induced to act, but he, not unnaturally, assumed that the ultimate possession of Kunfida was thereby assured to him. 3. It w r as unfortunate that the Sheriff chose this time to assert his, by no means clearly established, claim to Kunfida, and to lose sight of his main objective. He has agreed that the ultimate right to the possession of Kunfida will rid .telegram N o. 2S7-A. p„ dated stt ^ ? e T cided by arbitration after the war. August 1916, to Cairo and repeated to you. But X regret that he has not given this undertaking in writing to the Idrisi, in accordance with the request that I made to the High Commissioner of Egypt. It is also a matter of regret that more consideration was not shown to the Idrisi as regards the manner of his withdrawal and that such a peremptory tone was adopted towards him. 4. I recognised, of course, that we were committed to the support of the Sheriff, and that it was of primary importance to maintain the most friendly relations with him, hut the summary ejection of the Idrisi’s troops seemed to * vide the said telegram No. 237 -A. p., dated 9th me uncalled for, and I therefore pressed* August 1916 . lor a less peremptory withdrawal, 5. Under the circumstances I consider that the attitude adopted by the Idrisi is a most creditable one, and that we can hardly expect him at present to undertake a more active role, though I have again pointed out to him the advisability of taking every opportunity of assuming the offensive against our common enemy, the Turk. It is natural that he should now leave military operations against Abba to the Sheriff, but I hope that before long he may be induced to resume active hostilities elsewhere.i 81 ) 6. That the Idrisi was persuaded to assume this amenable attitude reflects I consider the greatest credit on the skill, patience, and tact displayed by Com mander Turton, It. N., and Lieutenant Nalder.

S. “ Northbrook”, To—The Political Resident at Aden. I have the honour to submit the following report in connection with the differences which have arisen with regard to the possession of Kunflda. The gist of the Idrisi’s arguments and policy are contained in the letters forwarded herewith, and the point he most strongly emphasises is the fact of being placed in possession of Kunfida and his flag hoisted by the British Gov ernment, his garrison being conveyed there by us, and then being summarily ordered to evacuate. In addition to the letters several conversations have taken place between the Saivid Mustafa, on behalf of the Idrisi, Lieutenant Naider, Political Officer, and myself and all the points raised have been carefully discussed. At a personal interview with the Idrisi on 8th August which lasted from midnight till 5-30 A. m. (the Idrisi Saiyid Mustafa, Lieutenant Naider and myself, only being present), all matters contained m my letter of the 7th August were discussed, together with his reply, which was then produced, in the rough. It was explained to him that the evacuation of Kunfida by him now was a necessary measure, as also the withdrawal of the ship-in order tha favour should not be shown to one side more than another—and that all rival claims would he considered after the war. &gt; The Idrisi was firm in the opinion that his evacuation would entail his final loss of this part of Asir and that after the war the British Government would have no power to force the Sheriff to give it up. no effect, as he evidently considered the moral effect of the ship s presence was ^He feels most of all his loss of prestige and dignity and the waste^ of his work of eight years, in planning a successful offensive a D am wp &lt;&gt;■•«.* «‘“ft' swerved and he has spoken perfectly openly, both in his letters cours^ot^conversation.^^ t^defto d^^histrces l^in friendly relations, “for the sake of the common cause, against the Tuik .He is still loyal to the British Government, hut his faith has been shaken. Lieutenant Nalder has assisted me most ably through a period, which for various reasons has not been without its difficulties. Lieutenant Nalder’s report is attached.

S. “Northbrook,” the 16th August 1916. From— Lieutenant L. F. Nalder, R. N. Y. R., Political Officer, Southern Red Sea Patrol, To— Commander L. N. Turton, R.N., in Command of H. M. S. “ Northbrook”. I beg to submit the following report on the Kunfida crisis and the events leading up to it. (1) On the 12th June the Idrisi declared his willingness to co-operate with the Sheriff of Mecca against the Turks, and that his first effort would be against Kunfida, Muhail and Ebba. It was suggested in my first report that the Kunfida District being debatable territory an offensive on his part in this direction might prove distasteful to the Sheriff. The policy was, however, approved and encouraged by the Government. (2) On 18th July, Kunfida was bombarded by H. M. ships to whom the Turkish garrison surrendered. The Idrisi flag was hoisted by the British, and, after a certain amount of trouble, an Idrisi garrison was placed there by us, after which fighting was reported between Idrisi troops and the Turks at Muhail. (3) There is no doubt that the bombardment of Kunfida was premature from the Idrisi’s point of view. He wanted time to secure the adherence of the Hali Tribes, many of whom have fought for him on previous occasions. Of this time for negotiation he was deprived. (4) At the end of July reports were received that Sheikh Mahomed Nasir was advancing on Kunfida from Lith with Sheriffial troops at the instigation of certain Sheikhs of the district. These Sheikhs were, the Idrisi alleges, those whose sons had been detained at Sabia on account of Turkish intrigue. We know that the Sheriff was corresponding with the Idrisi with reference to tht se hostages at the begining of the rising. (5) The Idrisi was naturally perturbed at this news : but the movement appeared, in view of the Sheriff’s situation in the north and his appeals for help, to be merely a rather flagrant “ try on ” which diplomatic representations would nip in the bud. The presence of the ship at Kunfida prevented anv attack being made. The townspeople declared their loyalty with Idrisi and wrote to Nasir asking him to withdraw. (6) As days went on however, it became apparent that the Sheriff was holding firm and finally a message was received stating that His Majesty’s Government had decided to withdraw the Idrisi garrison by sea, and that he was to be informed of the fact. ^ This was a somewhat difficult messao-e to deliver and the difficulty was increased by the fact that orders were given for the immediate withdrawal of the ship, with 48 hours’ notice to enable the Idrisi to send his instructions for evacuation by wireless telegraphy. (7) The Idrisi was, not unnaturally, exceedingly angry. Apart from believing that his withdrawal from Kunfida would^afford considerable relief to the lurks, lor reasons detailed in his letters, he complained that he had been treated without any consideration. We had installed him at Kunfida83 at our time, not at his : we then arrange with the Sheriff to give the place to him, without consulting the Idrisi at all: and adding to that a, summary time-limit, which, if adhered to, would entirely destroy his prestige in Asir. The interview on 7th August was distinctly stormy. He maintained that it was vital that the appearance of amity with the Sheriff should be preserved, for which an extension of 20 days, to enable delegates from both sides to meet, was absolutely necessary. He insisted that if this were refused, his prestige would he so destroyed that he might just as well retire to private life in Aden or Egypt. (s) His proposals were put forward and approved, but on 13th August he was further incensed by receiving a letter from Kunfida, sa y ln g ^ liat tbe Ship there had actually given the garrison a time-limit of three days to evacuate failing which they would he shelled. He complained bitterly through Saiyid Mustafa that the difference with the Sheriff had thereby been proclaimed broadcast to the whole of Asir, and that as all hope of saving appearances had been destroyed, the meeting of the delegates was useless. It Was explained that arrangements had already been made for the Sheriff s repre- sentative to arrive shortlf and he was persuaded to agree to the ^etmg. It was arranged that Sheikh Mohamed Yehia Barsahi on the part of the Mr]si, and Sheikh Ibn Areifan on the part of the Sheriff should meet at Birk on 17 August, hut the meeting was subsequently delayed till the 20th.

I have the honour to submit the following notes on the Conference be tween Sheikh Areifan on the part of the Sheriff of Mecca, and Sheikh Mahomed Yehia Basahi and the Sheriff Hamoud on the part of the Idrisi at which I was present. The Conference took place on H. M. S. ,c Northbrook ” in the evening of Monday, August 21st, and lasted little over an hour. After the preliminary greetings and enquiries as to how things were going in the direction of Medina, Areifan enquired as to the Imam and was told by Basahi that he was mobilising troops, and that they believe him to be heart and soul with the Turks. Areifan replied that the Sheriff was anxious to see that Imam co-operating with them against the Turks and that negotiations were proceeding to this end, which would certainly be successful. Basahi did not seem to be equally optimistic. Areifan then produced a letter from the Sheriff to the Idrisi a propos Kunfida, which Basahi read at Areifan’s invitation. He then asked Areifan what his proposals about Kunfida were—Areifan replied that they wished the Idrisi to evacuate Kunfida, but that his adherents should stay where they were until the end of the war, when those who favoured the Idrisi would cross the frontier. Basahi pointed out that they had been put there by the British and asked what boundary the Sheriff had in mind, and also what if the Idrisi also claimed Kunfida at the end of the war. Areifan replied that the Sheriff claimed^ everything up to Birk : and that the present time was not suitable for discussion of the matter. Basahi assented, but made it clear that the question was deferred, but by no means closed. The discussion then reverted to the evacuation : they agreed that it was all important that no opportunity should be given to intriguers to say that there was any difference of opinion between Sheriff and Idrisi. Basahi proposed that, to that end, Areifan should go to Kunfida : to which he cordially agreed. J Then the question of certain mutually antagonistic Sheikhs was brought up specially Bahran (pro-Idrisi) and beitali (pro-Sheriff), it appears that Beitah once betrayed four of Bahran’s kinsmen to the Turks, two of whom were hanged m Ebba and two in Kunfida. Areifan admitted that Beitali and the others with him were actuated by love of self : and undertook that the Sheriff would keep them m order and prevent their taking any steps offensive a g ai ^ st . . the Ihrisi partisans. It was also agreod that Sheikh Makshuh and Idrisi partisan should be left unmolested.

To Saiyid Muhammad bin Ali bin Muhammad bin Ahmed bin Idrisi. After greetings .—I beg to thank Your Excellency for your letter of 28th July and your remarks are quite understood. I have kept our friend Basahi informed of all matters. I will see your cousin, the Saiyid Mustafa, on his arrival to-night and will explain everything to him and give him the latest news from Kunfida. I shall leave here at daylight to-morrow, 31st July, with your troops, stores and munitions for Birk, accompanied by Mahomed Taher and hope to return to Gizan by the evening of Wednesday, 2nd August, when I will be able to inform you of all details. The news at Kunfida is disturbing, but you may rest assured that every thing possible will be done to avert any collision between Kunfida and the troops of Sayed Mahomed Nasir. I trust that our endeavours will be crowned with success and that diplo macy, and not force, will be means by which a satisfactory understanding may be reached. I feel sure that Sheriff Hussein is not responsible for this move ment from Lith. I would like to point out that Sheikh Mahomed bin Yehia Basahi has been of the greatest assistance to me during his stay at Gizan and he has untiringly and loyally worked on behalf of Your Excellency and to further our mutual ends. I have just received the message contained in your letter to Sheikh Mahomed bin Yehia Basahi. I am telegraphing to Aden and Egypt and am representing to them the necessity of controlling the Sheriff’s movements. I fully understand all the matters you mention and have the greatest confidence that the misunderstanding which appears to exist between the Hedjaz and Asir will be satisfactorily arranged. I am sending this by the hand of our friend Sheikh Mahomed bin Yehia Basahi.Enclosure 6. Extract from letter from the Idrisi to Sheikh Mahomed bin lehia Basahi. Tell the Captain of “ Northbrook ,, -“ Sheriff of Mecca has become very strong through the British Government and through the help of the British Fleet, and that the British Government should give him a limit beyond which he should not go. Otherwise all the trouble which the British Government has taken in Uniting the Arabs will be in vain. If the Sheriff of Mecca will not keep within his limit there will be great trouble, and the arrangement of uniting together against the Turks will be spoilt and the chief thing is to drive out the Turks from Arabia (Island of Arabia). I know that the Arab Kings are always fighting against one another to obtain things, country, &amp;c„ and they never think of the future, and I have mentioned this to the Government several times. This action of the Sheriff of Mecca is showing to the British Government that what he is doing is not fair. The Sheriff of Mecca cannot be independent without the help of the British Government. How can he (Sheriff of Mecca) be trusted to join in unity with us (Idrisi and British Government). If the British Government will not put her hand into this matter to keep the Arabic unity in good order, matters will be unsatisfactory and there will be undescribable trouble in Arabia (Arabic Island). Further news will be discussed between Captain of “ Northbrook ” and Saiyid Mustafa. Enclosure 7. H. M. S. “ Northbrook ”; 7th August 1916. To Saiyid Muhammad bin Muhammad bin Ali bin Ahmed bin Idrisi, After greetings .—As you know the Sheriff of Mecca has sent Nasir to the Kunfida District at the request of the tribes. (2) The British Government has left untried no argument which might procure his withdrawal by displomatic means. (3) In the meanwhile Nasir has collected about 1,000 Arabs who are within striking distance of Kunfida and eager to attack it. (4) The Sheriff announces that he must have Kunfida peaceably or by force or he will discontinue his offensive against the Turks in the north. He adds that he will restore it at the end of the war. (5) The British Government is, therefore, faced by two most unpleasant alternatives—(1) either to fire on the Sheriff’s forces, or (2) to advise you to withdraw your garrison from there. (6) The British Government realising that the first alternative must entail a complete breach with the Sheriff, which would probably mean the return of the Turks to Mecca, have decided to advise you to retire and will place the ship now at Kunfida at your disposal for this purpose. (7) The garrison say they will not leave until they receive your orders to that effect by wireless. As the ship is ordered to leave Kunfida at 12 to morrow, it is most necessary that I should receive your orders for transmission at the earliest possible opportunity to-morrow morning, otherwise your troops will be left unprotected. (8) I wish to make clear to Your Excellency my regret and the regret of Ihe Government at this unfortunate situation and to assure you that they havei 87 V, | arrived at this decision for one reason only, namely, the extirpation of the lurks from Arabia, and I hope that, in spite of this unfortunate incident. Your Excellency will be able to continue to assist us in the work. I am looking forward to a personal interview with you shortly. L. N. Turton, Commander in Command. Enclosure 8. Letter from the Idrisi to Commander Turton. 8th August 1916. Commander L. N. Turton, Commanding H. M. S. “ Northbrook ”, After greetings.—A. have received your letter of the 7th August dealing with the question of Kunfida and how the Sheriff of Mecca wishes to take it, either peaceably or by force. If it is a question of force, in the past I have opposed his force by force although with him were the whole forces of Turkey, and at the present time I am ready with the help of Allah to oppose him more energetically, but I see that you do not wish this owing to the criticalness of the situation. Moreover although the Masters of Kunfida and Ebba, namely the Turks, have been deposed, they have not been destroyed, but have supporters in the towns themselves and can get help from the Turks at Ebba and the Imam of Sanaa and elsewhere, and if I and the Sheriff do not face the enemy with that mutual loyalty which is the foundation of unity and victory, then of necessity the enemy will have a great opportunity and the trouble with us will be to his advantage only. I therefore wish to mention the following matters to you:— (1) The unity of Arabia, which the Government assured me at the begin ning of the war it would foster and protect, cannot be accomplished unless the ruler of every quarter keeps his own bounds, the ruler of the Hedjaz to the Hedjaz, the ruler of Nejd to Nejd, of Asir to Asir, of Sanaa to the Yemen; and if this arrangement is disturbed, the unity is impossible. (2) We believed that this unity especially when the Government pro mised to aid us in extending our boundaries north and south, and to take Kunfida which completes our territory (i.e., is our natural boundary) and if the Sheriff upsets the Government’s arrangements, that is the causeless begin ning of great troubles in Asir. (3) The troops in this district which are at Birk and the surrounding districts are for controlling the tribes inland of Kunfida until they (the tribes) take the field against Muhail and Ebba. These tribes are connected with that district, and know it, and unless the fighting is done by them it is impossible for anyone to advance against those places. (4) If he alleges that he has been invited by certain Sheikhs: these are the Sheikhs who are loyal to the Turks whom I had punished by taking their sons as hostages and they are imprisoned here up till the present moment. When the ships arrived they wished to fight against them, but received no support from the tribes or from the other Sheikhs. They then tried to get reinforcements from Ebba but failed, owing to our troops based on Birk and that district. They then determined to make over tures to the Sheriff knowing that he could not control the tribes to enable him to attack Ebba and Muhail and that the result would necessarily result in in action and relief for the Turks. They would also urge the^Shenff^ to secure the release of the hostages held by me, so that should hostilities against the Turks occur, there would be nothing to prevent them giving the Turks t eir full assistance. They would then help the Turks to victory taking no account of the Sheriff. This is the first time the Sheriff has ever fought independently, and therefore he has not the experience to understand whither affairs are leading.v V 88 (5) The Sheikhs who are now holding Kunfida are the most influential Sheikhs of Hali and the Kunfida district, and it is these who loyally fought for us against the Turks eight years ago. When they saw your ships they rejoiced and opposed the Turkish Sheikhs and controlled Kunfida, commanding their tribes and the tribes of the district to help us and you in the conviction that by your help the traces of the Turks would be obliterated. It is a matter of regret that the intrigues of the Turkish Sheikhs^with the Sheriff have been successful and the loyal tribes are exposed to disappointment. (6) We have never heard of any State which was in friendly relations with each other interfering in her internal affairs or intriguing with her people on any pretext whatever. (7) Not only is Kunfida part of Asir, but was handed over to us by a great Power. The news of that spread throughout all the tribes and through every district. It is necessarily impossible for me to submit to the disgrace which would result from this proposal, especially since our hands are tied since this decision has been reached by the Power which we reckon as our greatest friend. (8) The tribes of Asir are powerful which cannot be entered either by the Sheriff or by me except with their consent. Before the Turkish era they were kings of the Yemen and also were kings of the Hedjaz until the expedition of Muhammad Ali Pasha against the Wahabis. They have proved that they are loyal to us rather than to anyone else, and no one except the friends of the Turks will deny that. When they find three rulers in their country, the Sheriff, the Turk, and myself, it follows that they must either stay neutral or go over to the most powerful. Indeed I have to-day received news that the Ebba tribes, who are the pick of Asir, and the Shabran and Qahtan tribes in the neighbourhood of Ebba have gone over to the Turks; and that after many of them had held aloof for a long time. (9) As a result of the adherence of these tribes and the impossibility of unity among the other Asir tribes, the Turks will never leave Ebba cut off from Sanaa and the Imam who is on their side and is mobilising his troops round Saada where the Turks have long had a detachment. It is clear that the object of their movement is to open communication between Saada and Ebba through the mountains, which is roughly only a four days’ journey, and there is no chance of opposing them, because^ the province of Asir is now' in the greatest confusion. (10) Even though the Government should agree with the desires of the Sheriff against me (although I am convinced that he has need of the Government and without her must perish) yet if is impossible for the Government to treat me in so unfriendly a fashion as to set a limit of 48 hours, although there is a large force held up by her at Birk and the troops at Kunfida are a small detachment only placed there by the Government itself; the evacuation of these troops in this matter I cannot acquiesce in, for without doubt thereafter that will cause the tribes to lose faith in me and in the British Government. Enclosed is a letter from the ftesident, Aden, according to which action was taken. Enclosure 9. No. 552, dated the 14th June 1916 (Confidential). From—The Political ^Resident at Aden, To—Saiyid Muhammad bin Ali bin Muhammad bin Ahmed bin Idrisi. After greetings .—We have received your letter and congratulate you on your intention to embrace this unique opportunity and your resolution to work for the general good both from the religious and the temporal point of view. 2. It is hoped that your movement will be of the greatest advantage to the Sheriff of Mecca on whose shoulders the heaviest burden will fall, and I am sure that he will be most greatful to Your Excellency whatever action you may decide to take ; and for this reason it appears that your attack on Ebba and Muhail and Kunfida in the first place is the best, and we are certain that your efforts in that direction will be successful. 'f rEnclosure 10. H. M. S. “ Northbrook”; 10th August 1916. To Saiyid Muhammad bin Muhammad bin Ali bin Ahmed bin Idrisi, After greetings .—I beg to inform Your Excellency that I have received a telegram from the Senior Naval Officer at Jeddah, the contents of which are as follows:— (1) The Government after careful consideration of the general situation have decided, with great regret, that the continuance of your garrison at Kunfida for the present is impossible. (2) They fully understand what you mentioned to me and they are anxious to make the evacuation as easy as possible for you. (3) They hope that you will assist them as much as possible and will realise that as we are in alliance with the Sheriff for a most important purpose, and to attack the Sheriff is to attack Great Britain and the Bowers allied with her. (4) The Government is trying to arrange for a representative from the Sheriff to meet you, but they wish you to understand that for this to be suc cessful they must have your definite promise to evacuate Kunfida, otherwise the ship there will have to be withdrawn and the Government cannot be res ponsible for the garrison there. Should you wish to discuss matters with me, I shall be ready for an inter view at any time you may desire. L. N. Turton, Commander in Command. Enclosure 11. Letter from the Idrisi to Commander Turton. 10th August 1916. To Commander L. N. Turton, Commanding H. M. S. Northbrook , After greetings —We have received your letter, dated 10th August, on the question of Kunfida and inform you that our right to it is undoubted for the reasons which I have already explained. However, friction between myself and the Sheriff is obviously undesirable, because, apart from the fact that you do not wish it, the Turks, the Masters of Kunfida, have not been destroyed, but are seeking help and reinforcements from north and south: and friction between us would be simply helping the enemy and damaging the interests of both parties. 2 To attack the Sheriff would undoubtedly he not prejudicial to your interests only, but most certainly to mine, I know the strength and courage of the enemy and the Sheriff is now the first line of defence against them. Had I thoughtthat he could make good and stand between me and the Turks, theie would have been no objection on my part over Kunfida, but there is no hope of that, and it is with regret that I see my work and preparations in Asir for the past eight years wasted. , . , 3 As I have already pointed out, it is you who placed our troops in Kunfida with honour, and it is only right that you should withdraw them 4 Eor this reason, I have asked for a representative of the Sheriff, so that when the evacuation takes place I may demonstrate to the tribes that it is a matter of agreement, because if they thought I had been forced to withdraw, thev bavin' no confidence in the Sherifi nor any considerable strength, would probably go^ver to the Turks in view of their present military preparations at Ebba and around Saada. ' To-morrow our firiend Saiyid Mustafa will go to discuss matters with you.V 90 143 {Very Secret.)

From— -Saiyid Muhammad bin Ali bin Muhammad bin Ahmed bin Idris, The Idrisi, To— Major-General Stewart, Political Resident, Aden. After compliments .—We have received your esteemed letter, dated 15th •hawal 1334 (14th August 1916), and we have understood what Your Honour has alluded to, concerning the Kunfida affairs. We would like that you should know the inner meaning of the case and hope that you have known for certain the pleasure we felt in the action taken by Sheriff Husen, the Amir of Mecca, because we regard him as the best of friends and the old enmity that existed is considered as an incident of the past and as actuated by the Turks. We had a hope that his (Sheriff’s) ideas and action would harmonise with ours, as through his medium co-operation is possible against the enemy, especially when the enemy is powerful and has strong supporters and allies. We long to have all the people with us in this matter. Be the question of the port of Kunfida, although our claim to it is a substantial one, the temporary surrender of it to the Sheriff would not be harmful to us, had the action on his and our part been a joint one, so as to ensure our overcoming the whole district and arranging matters such as the mobilisation of troops. We have more experience of this part of the country and are more acquainted with the personnel good and bad. Those who are alar off and beyond the reach of the Turks are entirely our own men. The * Turks. evilly-disposed people are in their* favour, . ^ while the good are devoted to us. Our deputies and representatives are in every direction. When your ships arrived and bombarded Kunfida and the Turks had to capitulate, the well disposed people rejoiced and so helped us as to prevent the Turks and their adherents from resistance, hence they were obliged to surrender. It is a matter of regret therefore that when the Turkish partisans have seen the Turkish downfall and noted our charge and control and realized we would not only force them to behave properly but also enlist them as soldiers to fight the Turks and their supporters in their near vicinity (as was done 5 years ago), they took refuge with the Sheriff of Mecca thus setting up intrigues useful solely to the Turks. r The Sheriff will be content that these people have simply surrendered and it is not in his power to force them to take further action. Consequently the lurks will gain shelter, and no forces from Mecca to A sir are likely to&gt; ) f 91 come. Even if such forces were available, the people of Asir who are power ful will not be affected by them. They have strongly fortified hills. It is a matter for wonder that such a strategem should have appealed to the Sheriff of Mecca, for he has actually assisted the partisans of the Turks and has asked that the people on whom reliance could he placed, as also ourselves, who have never befriended the Turks, should stop our operations. What is more curious is the support given to him (the Sheriff) by British officers in this matter, so much so that the ship at A1 Kunfida, in order to propitiate the confederates of the Turks in the name of the Sheriff, threatened the removal of our people under humiliating terms notwithstanding that these were posted at Kunfida by Government. The friendship of these people with us and the Government has resulted in such an impasse and the difficulties arising there from may be summarised as follows :— (1) The tribesmen will not hereafter have confidence in us nor in the acts of the British Government. (2) On the liberation of the Turkish party from our control, they have become powerful and are working in the interest of the Turks. As a result they have actually removed the remainder of the soldiers of Kunfida, who with their guns and equipments were in open places, to Mohail, which, owing to their fear of us, they could not venture to do before. (3) Our friendlies on seeing the success of the pro-Turks will have an ardent desire to join them. (4) The Turks at Abha and Mohail have nothing to fear from any attack of fighting men from Kunfida, Tihama (low land) and hills. We had already organised armies from these men in the year when we besieged Abha. The soldiers who proceeded from us were able to draw them to a fight, because they are natives of the place and are better acquainted with its ways. (5) The country of Asir belongs to us, and if we are cut off from it, we shall have no supporters left there. (6) Our preparations for defence and our preliminary measures made in the event of the Turks' return, are thereby rendered fruitless. (7) The blockade against Abha and its dependencies is removed, because the opening of Kunfida for trade, is tantamount to allowing goods to reach the interior which is enemy country. (8) All the work done by our posts, such as the _ interruption of com munication between the South and Asir will have been in vain. ^ Had it not been for this, the Sheriff of Mecca would have had no success in his present undertaking. The Turks had made all necessary preparations at Mecca, but they were afraid of the day when troubles might arise from the South and Asir, and so they had also made preparations to meet such eventuality. The action was started at Mecca and our posts intervened between the Turks and Sheriff. The Sheriff therefore was able to attain his object through us. This is our explanation of the circumstances. We deem it incumbent on us to withdraw our soldiers from Kunfida and a delegate of ours has been deputed for this purpose on Wednesday last, and left in the ship with our mutual friend Captain Turton. These matters are obnoxious to us and we feel sorry to see the Sheriff of Mecca is pursuing the old policy of the Turks and trusts these hypocritical friends. This is because he never had any fighting against the Turks and has no experience of the conduct of the tribes in the fight. He placed no reliance on one like ourselves who had experience of the same, year after year, until he got his independence which we heartily wish him to attain. In fact, we consider this the first letter written in our defence. The matters of the past and future rest with God. As regards the question of the gunners which you referred to in your esteemed letter, please note that our tribesmen are not accustomed to visit the ports and we fear that their behaviour may not be altogether the best.As for the matter of the dhows, please note that it has become an urgent one, owing to the irregularity of the visits of Cowasjee’s steamers, and we therefore request of your praiseworthy benevolence to solve this difficulty.

Addressed to London Foreign Office. 146 Telegram P., No. 778, dated the 13th (received 14th) September 1916'. From—The British High Commissioner, Egypt, Cairo, To—His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla. After discussion with Wilson who arrived yesterday, and a lonw Conference at y vh j?, l '. 1 i e a88 i s ‘ ed &gt; with Commander-in-Chief, Egypt, and Naval Command* er-m-Chief, I addressed following memorandum to Commander-in-Chief. Following appreciation is result of personal discussion with Wilson. In Hedjaz situation has developed to a point which necessitates immediate decision. Ali Haidar, the newly appointed Sheriff, has been brought with Turk Holy Carpet to Medina by the Turks who are determined to try and break through along Sultaneh road via Babegh to Mecca in time for pilgrimage. Sheriff Faisal is opposing them on Sultaneh road which is their only practicable route and Sheriff Ali is operating on their rear and left flank. Wilson has been told by Faisal that his forces are beginning to doubt reality of British support and that they will lose heart unless they receive moral backing of trained troops at Babegh, and give way to a really determined advance on Babeo-fi where Sheriff has quantities of munitions and supplies on which Turks arereckoning for their further advance to Mecca. Faisal maintains (and Wilson’s opinion is the same) that visible sign of British support and feeling of security afforded by presence of trained troops at Rabegh, would so put heart into his Arabs as to enable the forces under Ali and himself to hold up the Turks and sever their all-vital communication with Medina. Turks would be discouraged correspondingly. Time to them is now a factor of vital importance unless they are to fail completely. Turkish success will not only endanger our pilgrimage seriously, hut threat en whole Arab movement with grave risk of collapse. Recapture of Mecca would gravely damage our prestige throughout the Moslem world, would open to Turks whole of Arabia and give them free access to eastern shores of Red Sea; would affect situation in Somaliland Protectorate and Abyssinia serious ly, and thus jeopardize the whole political and military situation east of Suez. The Turkish expansion down and across Red Sea which recent information now proves to have been their aim, has been barred by Arab revolt. It is essential to maintain this barrier now that every available man is required in main theatres of war. We are, moreover, morally committed to support Sheriff, and we shall certainly be held largely responsible for his failure. Though the arguments in favour of a threat from Akaba against railway still hold good, recent developments at Medina have subordinated that opera tion to direct and immediate support of Faisal by a British force at Rabegh. The religious and political objections to landing British Government troops in Hedjaz and the capital which hostile propagandists, especially in India, will make of such action, are fully appreciated. It is, however, a matter for His Majesty’s Government to decide whether this would not be preferable to the very serious situation which might result from total collapse of Aiab movement, which we must remember has if not actual support, at any rate sympathy, of majority of Arab race(?). I am of opinion after very careful consideration that we should offer Sheriff to send an infantry brigade to Rabegh to give Faisal that moral support which he so urgently demands, and that troops should be sent without delay if Sheriff accepts. It should be clearly pointed out that in no circumstances will anv advance be made beyond Rabegh, that a brigade is absolute maximum and that immediately present crisis is over it will be withdrawn. Subject to approval of His Majesty’s Government, therefore, I ask that one brigade of infantry, one company of Engineers, two batteries of artillerv half wing of aeroplanes ond one Field Ambulance, be held in readi ness to*proceed to Rabegh at earliest possible date. If available, Muham madan troops would be preferable to British, but presence of European officers and mechanical (?) troops necessary for any such force makes distinction of less importance and value. I know that French Government is ready to offer to send French Moslem troops to Hedjaz if we do not send troops. I his* I o-reatly deprecate, as we should thereby be robbed of very great political advantages which Sheriff’s success will give us hereafter. Moreover, they could hardly arrive in time to be of use. I have received a telegram from Sheriff with an urgent request for three battalions since writing above. I am aware how difficult incessant calls upon you and the wide scope of vour task in Egvpt make it for you to afford more than that material assist ance which you have ungrudgingly given up to date. I beg, however, that you will submit the question to War Office with such observations as you may see fft to make ”. There is every reason to hope that Arabs will take advantage of pre carious position of Turk force and by their own efforts attain desired success, but it seems imperatively necessary to provide moral support to ensure this, and avoid widespread consequences of a reverse. Many inconvenient consequences would be entailed by French assistance m troops, even if they were in time to be of use, which I greatly doubt.

From—The Arab Bureau Cairo, •• To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. Porde sends following :— Begins. It appears from notes found on two parties of Germans attacked by Arabs in Hedjaz last May which haye been sent us by Sheriff, and other information, that Germans and Turkish General Staff decided in January last to use Hedjaz and Yemen coasts as bases against us. An Ottoman expeditionary force under Khairi Bey and Baron von Stotzingon left Constantinople for this purpose and arrived at Medina in May. They planned to advance to Sanaa by Mecca, Kunfida and Ibha, avoid ing Idrisi’s country in Yemen. They intended to threaten Aden, attempt systematic destruction of British commerce, stir rebellion through agents and raiding parties on African Coast, Somaliland and Abyssinia. That they have not abandoned above scheme is shown by their present determined attempt to attack Babegh. This proves that enemy were first to bring Hedjaz into theatre of war, and would appear to justify our granting active open aid to Sheriff even to extent, if necessary, of sending troops into Hedjaz. 147A memorandum.

Urgent demands for 7,000 more rifles and ammunition, machine guns, a battery of quick-firing guns (without personnel) and some aeroplanes has been made by Sheriff who says that a desperate effort to get Sheriff Haidar into Mecca before pilgrimage is evidently being made by Turks.

From—The British High Commissioner in Egypt, To—His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla. My telegram No. 693. A note verbal in following sense has been handed me by French Minister. Mission which French Government have decided to send to Sheriff of Mecca is entirely political and entirely non-religious i President of the Republic is sending it to Sheriff as head of a Moslem community which has detached itself from Ottoman Empire. Fact that this Mission has nothing to do with question of Khalifate is emphasised: French Gq\ernment has decided not to interfere in that question, and even should it arise will not discuss it. Mission’s object is to get into touch with the Chief who will be responsible for Holy Places in future, and to settle with him pilgrimage question which concerns all French Moslem subjects. On this Mission French Government will be represented by Moslems alone. Mission will consist of two divisions— (1) A civil delegation, headed by Ben Ghabrit, Director of Education to Sultan of Morocco, French Foreign Office under official. Delega tion will also include a Moroccan, son of Sherifian Grand Vizier s63 two Algerian and two Tunisian notables and possibly a political leader of Trench West Africa. (2) A military delegation composed of — (a) Four Moslem officers of Trench regiment accompanied by their Moslem orderlies. (b) Lieutenant-Colonel Bremont, another officer not yet appointed, an interpreter, two soldier secretaries and three orderlies, who are all to remain in Egypt. This military delegation will leave Marseilles on August 23rd for Alexandria where it will be joined by civil delegation who are due to leave Marseilles on September 6th. Both delegations will sail from Alexandria for Mecca on Trench cruiser “ D’Estre Military Mission is meant in agreement with British military authorities to discuss with Sheriff nature and extent of military assistance which could be given to Arab revolt. This military assistance is capable of being specially useful in view of existence of Trench Moslem units. Though Colonel Bremont will not proceed to Arabia he will also direct the political Mission. It will be for him to decide where to make his headquarters in order best to fulfil his duties. He has been instructed — (1) To put himself in touch with the British military authorities especial* ly as to his (?) own definite quarters, eventual establishment of a base, move ments of personnel of (?) munitions of war, &amp;c., and to act in complete agree ment with those authorities. Steamship “ St. Francis o£ Assisi ” which will be placed at the disposal of the military Mission is due at Port Soudan on September 10th. Irench Minister has received instructions to ask High Commissioner to help _ im to carry out above arrangements. He begs him to inform Sheriff of Mission and to request him to send his representatives to meet it on its arrival at ^Jeddah and to provide transport and sufficient escort to ensure its sale arrival at Mecca with the contributions (“ subsid ? es convevin^. He also asks High Commissioner to put Colonel Bremont into toulh with military authorities in order that arrangements may be made eventually for establishment of his quarters in Egypt or at some place on the Bed Sea as he may think best. Tr, a further note verbal Trench Minister informs me that pilgrimage arranged by Trench Government will consist of about 600 Moslems rom Mnrooco Tunis and Algeria, who are due on Messagenes steamer Orenoque s^ 0 port°Said'about September 16th and at Jeddah some four days later. He asks me to inform Sheriff of these arrangements m order that he may he able tftake necessary steps to ensure transport and safety of pdgnms from Jeddah to Mecca and back. „i n.

W. His Excellency the Governor of the Straits Settlements. His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General, Batavia. I). Petrie, Esq. 'Record of interview between the General Officer Commanding, Straits Settle- ments, and Saiyid Muhammad Bin-al-Junid, on 28th July 1916. I questioned him on various points connected with the Arab and Muhammadan feeling generally in Java. The conversation turned on the subject of Mangoosb, the Captain of the Arabs in Java. Man^oosh has a school and his chief man is a Soudanese, whose advice Mangoosh. follows. It may be that on account of this Mangoosh’s feelings are so anti-English. 2. In regard to the two divisions of Arabs—the Saiyids and the Shaiks—the Saiyids are not pro-German, but the Shaiks are certainly so. In my informant’s opinion not a single Saiyid is pro-German. I understood him to say that the majority of the Arabs in Java are Shaikhs and are therefore pro-German. Mangoosh is a Shaikh. 3. Arab t'evolt —The majority of the Arabs do not take it as a fact; they think that the British have circulated these stories and that they are lies. If, however, there is a revolt, the Arabs would favour it as they would be glad to be free, and only count the Sultan of Turkey as an unnatural Khalif. The Javanese do not take the revolt as a fact. The Javanese themselves are apparently, so far as my informant could say, mostly pro-German. My informant thinks that the Germans in Java are working to put the Javanese against their own Government, and are doing this very secretly. This, of course, is merely my informant’s own opinion. 4. The Manifesto from Java, which was submitted through this office to ascertain our views as to whether it should be published in order to create feeling against Mangoosh, has now been decided as unnecessary. 5. My informant said that a number of Arabs in Java claim to the Hndramaut Arabs, and enquire whether they can seek the protection of the British. I told him that I would go into this question and let him know. Dictated. 'h Military Headquarters, S. S., f D. H. Ridout, Brigadier-General, Port Canning, Singapore; C Commanding the Troops, S. S.

Urgent demands for full equipment for a force of 40,000 are made by Sheriff. A full list follows by despatch. The most important items are the following :—one 15-centimetre battery ; four 10^-centimetre mountain batteries ; four French quick-firing mountain batteries (75), all with am munition and complete in every detail except personnel; 40,000 rifles with ammunition ; fifty maxim guns; four aeroplanes, also such things as revolvers and field glasses for officers, barbed wire, telephones, wireless telegraphy, &amp;c. I am of opinion after careful consideration that we should be prepared to supply all the above with exception of fifteen centimetre guns, but gradually and in proportion to needs of the situation and the growth of his trained personnel. All that can be profitably used at present is 7,500 rifles, five machine guns, two aeroplanes, and one quick-firing battery, which are most urgently required. The military authorities here have supplied the rifles and five machine gunsare on the way from England. Sir Archibald Murray, whom I have consulted is unable with limited resources at his command to supply the quick-firing battery or aeroplanes. I urge most strongly, therefore, that the War Office be approached with a view to cope with despatch complete in every detail except the personnel. Battery should be supplied with ammunition in propor tion of one-quarter common shell and three-quarters shrapnel. Sheriff’s army will take some time to train but it would be _ wise fc&gt; accumulate remainder of his requirements in Egypt. 10,0C0 rifles, six machine guns, and another quick-firing battery, all with ammunition will be needed in the near future. The Sheriff is in urgent need of trained instructors also. Picked Indian officers who have served in Erance (as volunteers) would be invaluable if they could be sent. They could return to Erance when theiiy services are no longer required or they could be given leave and sent for definite periods. If India concurs I strongly recommend this being done. I am told by Captain Bray who has just come from Erance with two Indian officers for Mecca that if necessary he can suggest some suitable names to Government of India. The despatch of six Indian machine guns and crews is also recommended. At present Sheriff seems to be holding his own but the situation will be extremely critical for next two months in the neighbourhood.^ At present we are not in a position to undertake active operations in direction of Maan and Akaba. In view of wide interests involved, I most strongly urge the immediate importance of rendering Sheriff all the possible help in the matter of munitions of war and personnel. As we are arranging a pilgrimage, it is vital that the military situation as regards Mecca should be completely safeguarded. Sir Archibald Murray, in view of the urgency, is sending two Quick-firing guns captured from the Turks at Katia; unfortunately there are onlv 400 rounds of ammunition for them. Two 2‘9o mountain guns are aWbeing sent by Sardar at great personal inconvenience.

September 12th. 1916 My Lord, I have the honour to forward to you herewith translation of the proclamation issued in the Hedjaz hy Ali Heidar, the newly appointed Turkish Sherlf. I have sent a copy of this Proclamation to the Viceroy of India. The Viscount Gyey of Fallodon, K.G &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.TRANSLATION. I n the name of God the Merciful, the Compassionat e. This is our letter to the people of our country SL HEJAZ and those near them v/hether towns men or nomads far or near. We thank God for having brought us up in the cradle of'Islam, strengthened us all by Mohammed (prayers and peace be upon him) made us with you neighbours to the Holy House, and granted us all the privileges and rights of the neighbour - thanks that no words can express and we pray to and salute our Lord and ancestor the best of men who was chosen from the Arabs, and who compiled his obedience to God with his obedience to the Imam according to His saying 'Obey God and His Prophet and your masters', and his household and friends who obeyed him to the last degree. Thirteen centuries have passed since the beginning of Islan during which it has gone through different stages of welfare and of adversity, has lost many of its territories and strength but also at times regained and revived them. It has not left a single enemy country into which it has not entered, and there is not one Mohammedan country into which the enemies have not tried to enter, except our country the noble HEJAZ. History does not record any in vasion of HEJAZ except by Moslem nations, it has remained immune from invasion in spite of the ^ changes in times and destiny, it has been raised to a point that no enemy could reach. The enemy has invaded Egypt the Sudan and India, Yemen, Ahkaf, Amman and vicinity, and this time he made an ct-ooempt on BASRA, but did not dare uo approach MECCA and the- 2 - the HSJAZ, the blessed country of the Moslems and the Khalifs. The enemy continued his efforts until tne general war broKe out and the Ottoman Government rose to avenge Islam. The enemy then could not hope for anything in HEJAZ as well as in any other country, nor could he aspire to set his foot near the noble HARAMEIN. All of a sudden however, El Sherif Hussein leagued himself with that enemy and is now trying to place the House of God, the Kibla of Islam and the tomb of the Prophet under the pro- tection of a Christian Government, war with the Turkish Government and doing what it can to subju gate all Moslem nations. All the Sherifs allega tions to justify himself in revolting against the Government and in setting Moslem fighting against each other do not benefit him in the least before God who knows the secret, neither before the Prophet whose Law is that of the sun, nor before the people of Islam who know what the English are and what they are doing. The Sherif Hussein cannot efface a single word of the truth nor convince anybody of his com petence to be an independent Emir, to fight against the Government and to assume charge of the Affairs of Moslems, and to claim full ability to protect Islam. Therefore to be able to fight against a Great Power like the Ottoman Government he must necessarily shield himself under the wings of a foreign Government. This is what he has actually done in agreement with England who is deceiving him and picturing to him all sorts of false hopes to make him revo.lt against the Government who is protectingprotecting him, so that when England succeeds in this policy (may God forbid it) his case with her will he the same as that of the Khedive of Egypt, the Sultan of Zanzibar, Emir of Lahj and the Emir of India and the rest of the Islamic Governments y/ho have fallen into the English trap. He who sees what has befallen others, should beware lest the same misfortune befall him also. The Sherif, be fore opening hostilities with a Power much superior to him, should have considered the fact that Eng land would not help him unless she was afterwards to govern him and that the moment she stretches her finger to HEJAZ she will not relax her efforts until by degree she annexes it to the other coun tries which she has already fraudulently occupied. Let him ask those Emirs who have done likewise be fore him, and let him read the treaties which Eng land made with them and with others. He will then understand how those Governments have changed from existence to non-existence and how they regret now what they have done. No matter how much the Sherif Hussein contradicts our belief that the HEJAZ will be a field for Christian troops, the fact is that the troops whom England will send him, whether Moslem or Christians are but servants of England, fighters in the Army of a Christian Government, wearing her arms and obeying her orders, and thus there is really no difference in them, whether they are Moslems or Christians so long as the con- sequences that are going to fall upon Islam are the same. The head is the leader and the other numbers follow. There is no one who denies that if those Moslemthey have done with the tribes of Irak, Oman and South Yemen, which resulted in the revolution of Mascat; and second by force as they have done with the tribes in Egypt and Sudan, so that if they wanted to enter the country the Arabs shall be unable to resist them. Therefore, there is no comparison with Germany and the alliance with England, although both belong to one religion; and God says 'God does not forbid you from being friends with those who do not fight against your religion and who do not chase you from your country; you should treat them with justice for God loves the just; but God forbids you from befriending those who fight your religion and chase you from your country by using some of you to help them do so.' The English have severed India, Egypt, the Sudan, Zanzibar, Somaliland, and a part of Arabia from the body of Islam and occupied them. They turned the strength of their inhabitants into weakness. They were not satisfied with that but helped the French to occupy Morocco and Central Africa, helped the Russians to occupy Persia and the Italians to occupy Tripoli. They even came into agreement with their own enemies against the Moslems. There remains nothing they have not done in order to destroy I si ami sm. The HEJAZ only remained exempt from their aggression, but now, unfortunately, it is no more * so. They have found a means for their aims in the person of a man who should have teen the first to defend the HEJAZ, putting at his disposal money and men, and because our family is responsible for the safety of the House. All men know how our ancestor, El Hussein Ibn All, relinquished the Khalifate in order—— - 6 - order to prevent Moslem bloodshed, and out of sym pathy for the religion; therefore he in whose days the Christian Powers stretch their hand to HEJAZ for the first time in history, is not one of us, and this great trespass should not be recorded in our history after our glorious stand in the past in support of the religion. For this reason and in conformity with the conduct of our ancestors when the 'Ernir of the Faithful' our lord Sultan Mohd. Hashad V. has conferred upon me the Imarat of Mecca at a time when the HEJAZ is in real danger, I accept ed it with the help of God not because I desire authority and power - for this already pertains to us - but out of sympathy for the Holy Places lest they should fall in the hand of the enemy, who if he once interferes in its affairs and is not opposed will shortly enter it and tread on its sacred soil that has been sacred for over 1,300 years. If God and His Prophet command a thing we must obey and rise up to the 'Jehad'. We must also explain to you clearly how in joining the Christians the Sherif Hussein has placed the Holy Places under their mercy, that the weak among you may not be deceived by the falsehood that has affected the poor people of the desert and in order that the ignorant, who have been taken in by these falsehoods, may not oblige us to unsheath our sword in their faces. We call you all to obedience, it being the call of the Koran, the call of the Sultan and the call of our forefathers whom the affairs of EL HEJAZ concern. We call you to be united and to rush to-7- English and. those who dare to befriend them, and to support the troops of the Sultan who are advanc ing on MEDINA and MECCA to cleanae them from the infidels. And he who disobeys the call of God and His Prophet, the anger of God will fall upon him. He who sees the foreigner begin to send his forces to the Holy Places and does not rise and defend them, does not belong to the Prophet; and he who dares to help those foreigners who are the* enemies of the religion, in any way, or agrees with any one who revolts against the Government he will render himself liable to torture in this world and in the other. I do not wish to believe that there is anyone among the people of these Holy Disricts who will choose to obey Satan, and disobey the Sultan, or accepts the infidel rather than the faithful, and I do not wish to see the people of those places give their necks to our swords whose deeds they have witnessed in our battles with the English and the French when they attacked Chanak Kalaa and returned with failure. We have no doubt that God will protect those places where His House is, and which hold the bones of our Prophet, and will help you to succeed in this Holy War. Fight so that the word of God may be uppermost and you may gain the riches of this world and the next, and bring shame and defeat upon those who dare to play with the House of God as well as upon the foreigners who keep them. Fight so that you may shortly enter the Holy Mosque in peace with your heads uplifted. Do not be deceived by the intrigueis and the liars and do not be afraid of their power, forfor God will make you conquer, you in His Array and support you. (Signed) ALI HEIDAH.

The Director of the Arab Bureau, Cairo. I have the honour to submit my report on my mission to Jeddah. A list of the requirements of the Sheriff of Mecca and a summary of certain other matters will he found in Appendix I. In accordance with instructions from His Excellency the High Commis sioner, I left Cairo at 11 a.m. on June 20th with El Mir Said Bey Ali, who was to take over the command of the two Egyptian batteries. I took with me £20,000 in gold for the Sheriff and carried a letter from His Excellency the High Commissioner, announcing the death of Lord Kitchener and another letter appointing me His Excellency’s liaison officer. In accordance with instructions I left the train at Ismailia and travelled to Suez later in the after noon with the Commander-in-Chief. I have already informed you of the Commander-in-Chief’s instructions in my letter of June 21st. I had hoped to sail in H. M. S. “ Anne ” the same night, but owing to the delay in sending the rifles, the ship was unable to sail until 8 p.m. on June 22nd. The supplies and munitions which we took were as follows :— 3.000 rifles. 1.200.000 rounds S. A.*A. 15 doz. wet slabs gun cotton. 1 doz. dry primers. 525 detonators, No. 8. 504 safety fuzes. 6 maxim guns with ammunition. 6 ten-pounder mountain guns with ammunition. Barley 3,375 hags or approx. 120 tons. Sugar 135 „ Si » A j&gt; Coffee 225 „ ss SS 6 ,, Eice 2,846 „ 3S „ 101 „ Elour 5,736 „ }&gt; „ 358i „ The maxims and mountain guns Subsequently landed at Port Sudan. were intended for the Sirdar and were H. M. S. “ Anne ” is unable to steam faster than 7i knots and we accord- ingly did not arrive at Port Sudan until 2-30 p.m. on June 26th. I found that Colonel Wilson, the Governor of the Eed Sea Province, had gone to Jeddah two days previously to make all arrangements for the dis embarkation of the batteries. The Sirdar arrived from Erkowit about 4-30 p.m., and it was decided that H. M. S. “ Anne ” should take on hoard the mountain gun battery ; that the S. S. “ Surada,” a ship which was fortunately in port en route to Australia, and which was fitted with stalls, should carry the maxim battery and the escort of 60 men; and that IL M. S. “ Suva80 should transport the remainder of the wheat EX. “ Airedale,” which had been lying at Port Sudan since last summer, and anything else which the other two ships were unable to carry. Major Pearson joined me on H. M. S. “Anne”, his instructions from the Sirdar being to study the situation at Jeddah and report to the High Com missioner and the Commander-in-Chief. I was fortunate in being able to discuss the whole situation with the Sirdar and to obtain his views. H. M. S. “Anne ” sailed at 8 p.h. on June 27th and arrived off Jeddah at midday next day. H. M. S. “ Suva ” and the “ Surada” were delayed owing to a wash-out on the Sudan Railway and did not arrive until the 29th. While crossing on H. M. S. “ Anne ”, a message came from R. I. M. S. “ Dufferin ” that the Sheriff wanted to divide the mountain battery, and send two guns with an escort of twenty men to Mecca and four guns and an escort of forty men to Rabigb. Both Colonel Wilson and Said Bey Ali were opposed to this and on arrival Said Bay was sent on shore to speak to the Sheriff on the telephone. He returned with the news that he had been unable to alter the Sheriff’s decision and that the latter had informed him that he no longer needed the maxim battery which was to return to Port Sudan. Hussein Effendi Ruhi handed to me on my arrival a report from Sheriff Effendi Earoki for General Clayton (see Appendix II), three letters from the Sheriff to the High Commissioner (see Appendix III) and a copy of a proclam ation from the Sheriff to the Muhammadan world (see Appendix IV). I understand that the gist of Appendices II and III had already been telegraphed to you. The proclamation was sent by the Sheriff in consequence of a request by the Sirdar that he should write to the Abyssinian Kadis with a view to counter-acting the pro-Turkish propaganda in that country. I understand that it has not yet been published and will probably be altered in certain particulars. On June 29th, Colonel Wilson, Captain Warren, R. N., of R. I. M. S. “ Dufferin ”, Major Pearson, Said Bey Ali and myself, with the interpreter Hussein Effendi Ruhi, went on shore to interview Sheriff Zeid, the youngest son of the Sheriff. After a hot and dusty walk of 15 minutes we arrived at his house, which is near the north gate of the town, and were shown into the presence of Sheriff Zeid, Sheriff leaser Ibn Shukr, a relation of the Sheriff who has been many years one of his special messengers, Sheriff Abdulla, a large and unattractive looking man of about sixty who maintained complete silence throughout the proceedings, and Jamil Effendi Rafei. I briefly introduced myself as the High Commissioner’s representative and, after giving a few polite messages, said that I would defer the presenta tion of my letters until Colonel Wilson and Captain Warren had settled the question of the batteries. Sheriff Zeid informed us that Sheriff Earoki had just arrived from Mecca and that he would send for him. Sheriff Earoki arrived in a few minutes and the matter was explained. The Sheriff must have been informed that Colonel Wilson was in the house as presently a message came up that he would like to speak to him on the telephone. Colonel Wilson and Said Bey accordingly went downstairs and after some discussion it was decided that Said Bey should go to Mecca with two mountain puns and an escort of twenty men and that the other four guns, the remainder of the escort and the maxim battery, which the Sheriff now said he wanted, should be sent to Rabigh under the command of the two Yusbashis. After arranging this, Colonel Wilson and Captain Warren went back to the ship, and Major Pearson, whom Colonel Wilson had presented on arrival as the representative of the Sirdar, and myself were left with Sheriff Zeid, Sheriff Earoki and Jamil Effendi Rafei. I presented my letter of introduction to Sheriff Zeid and he at once went downstairs and informed his father, coming hack with the message that I was very welcome, that Sheriff Earoki was going to Cairo at once with all his commands, but that he hoped I would stay as long as I liked.31 Sheriff Paroki took up the line that he had his orders from the Sheriff to discuss certain matters with the High Commissioner, that he had a full list of all his requirements and that therefore there was nothing which I could usefully do in Jeddah. I pointed out that I could perhaps expedite matters by telegraphing the gist of his requirements to Cairo but his attitude continued to be so uncompromising that I was finally compelled to request Sheriff Zeid to telephone to his father and ask him whether I was likely to be of any assistance as I had only come for that^ purpose, and if my services were not required X proposed to inform the High Commissioner of the fact and return to Cairo at once. On this, Sheriff Earoki consented to accept my help. During this conversation Jamil Hafei and Zeid Bey had played the part of silent spectators, Zeid Bey was throughout perfectly polite and cordial, but he did not once assert himself. He is obviously a nonentity and dislikes having any responsibility thrust upon him. During the course of conversation, as directed by His Excellency the High Commissioner, I had spoken of the pil grimage and the importance of its being a success this year, and was assured that the point had not been lost sight of. Shortly afterwards we took our leave, after saying goodbye to Zeid Bey who was to return to Mecca that afternoon, and arranging that Sheriff Earoki should come aboard the ' Dufferip ” about sunset. Both Major Pearson and myself went away with a strong impression that our presence in Jeddah was unwelcome, at all events to the two Syrians. In the afternoon I went ashore to bring Sheriff Earoki off and was introduced to certain local notables, such as Sheikh Suleiman Qabil, the chief of the municipality, Sheikh Abdel Latif El Muzeini, the harbour-master, and Sheikh Bashid, Gallatly and Hankey’s agent. I met Sherif Nazir Ibn Shukr who was accompanying the batteries to Rabegh and should have been on board H. M. S. “ Anne ” several hours before. He said that he had been saying goodbye to Sheriff Zeid. I took him off with me but we were too late to overtake the “Anne His absence was destined to have serious consequences as the “ Surada ” to which he transferred did not start till midday of the 30th and by the time it reached Rabegh, the trouble, to which I shall presently refer, had taken place. Major Pearson was also on board the “ Surada **. On the morning of June 30th I had a long conversation with Sheriff Earoki, in which he told me frankly of the object of his mission. He also showed me his letter of introduction to the High Commissioner of which a rough translation is attached (Appendix Y). The Sheriff is very anxious to be officially recognised by the Allies and has ordered Sheriff Earoki to make a special point of this. He intends to send telegrams to each Government. He is very sensitive about the opinion of the Muhammadan world, but hopes that his proclamation will convince it of the righteousness of his cause. He also intends to conciliate the Azhar Ulema at all costs and to start a press campaign in his own favour. I pointed out that nothing could help him so much as a successful pilgrimage as his fair fame would then be spread all over the Moslem world. Earoki replied that this was fully realised and that the Sheriff intended to begin by halving the pilgrimage dues. He then went on to say that the Sheriff designed to assume eventually the title of the “ King of the Arabs *’ and &lt;e Khalifa of the Moslems ” but that he wished to make his position thoroughly secure first. He realises that his present untrained bands are of little use in opposing the Turks and therefore wishes as quickly as possible to form an army of about 30,000 men, of which the majority will be Hedjaz Arabs, stiffened by all the Arab officers and men who can be obtained in the British Prisoners-of-War Camps in India, Mesopotamia and Egypt. Sheriff Earoki is empowered to ask the British Government to equip the whole of this force, to collect in Egypt all the Arab supporters from the various Prisoners-of^ War Camps and to help in every way possible the formation of the nucleus of the Arab Army. Probably Aziz Bey El Nasri will be asked to command. Earoki after obtaining the approval of the British Government to the scheme in principle, will consult with the Arab officers now in Cairo and submit detailed and considered proposals. The ultimate intention which he frankly avows is to invade Syria as soon as possible. He has instructions to raise the Syrian territorial question and to try to come to some arrangement with the Erench*As to whether the British Government will he asked to maintain the Arab Army in the field depends on what other drains are made on the monthly sub- sidy of £125,000. The Sheriff is convinced that this sum has been promised to him and wishes it paid in gold at Jeddah commencing from July 1st. His present immediate requirements are :— (1) 7,000 rifles. (2) 5,300,000 rounds S. A. A., i.e., at the rate of 650 rounds per rifle for the whole 10,000, since he says that the 400 rounds per rifle sent with the first 3,000 rifles were not enough. (3) 50 kilos dynamite to be used against the Medina Eort. Earoki intends to send an Arab sapper officer with this immediately on his arrival at Cairo. (4) 500 hand bombs. (5) 5 trained Moslem armourers for the repair of both rifles and guns. (6) 2 or 3 Moslem experts in explosives, about whom Colonel Wilson has already telegraphed to the Sirdar. The other things which he has already asked for, such as two more mountain batteries, a howitzer battery, 25,000 rifles, a field ambulance and two or four aeroplanes, form part of the scheme for the regular army and will he submitted by Earoki later. The Sheriff hopes and expects that the British Government will keep his present irregular force fully supplied and equipped. He will be glad to welcome a British Consul at Jeddah shortly. He wants the Mahmal sent at the usual time. As regards the internal administration of theHedjaz, Earoki wishes to send some Muhammadans of experience from Cairo at once to reduce to order the chaos at present reigning. I do not think he has any cut and dried proposal to make. He is very anxious to secure the help of General Clayton in military, and Mr. Storrs in civil matters, and seems to have left the details for later decision. If His Britannic Majesty’s Government intends to afford full help to the Sheriff, it will probably be necessary to form two Committees, one civil and one military, composed of British and Arab members, in order that a comprehensive scheme may be drawn up. Earoki also spoke to me of the rising which has taken place in Syria and which is generally considered in Jeddah to be of great importance. I heard several different reports. Earoki’s version is that the Druses have rebelled and that Sheikh Nuri Shaalan with all the Roalla, whom he estimates at 15,000 fighting men, helped by Hakim Ibn Muheid and various Arab officers refugees, has also revolted and entered the Vilayat of Damascus.^ He thinks that the operations will consist of frequent raids, for which Nuri Shaalan is most conveniently placed since he can retreat swiftly on Jauf where he is out of reach of the Turks. His estimate of the Turkish troops in Syria is 10,000 Germans, 15,000 Turks and 12,000 Syrians, the latter being chiefly officered by Turks and therefore unlikely to move. Three hundred machine guns are said to have been sent recently from Constantinople to Syria. On the afternoon of the 30th, I went ashore with Earoki and accompanied him to the house of Sheikh Muhammad Nessif, the Agent of the Sheriff m Jeddah. Earoki wished to speak to the Sheriff on the telephone so I was taken to an upper chamber. When we were alone Sheikh Nessif expan e after a few minutes’ conversation and informed . that - Jeddah were looking forward with dread to being ruled by the Sheriff, that the Sheriffs in the country were all corrupt and unreliable, that the town council was entirely unfit for its duties, that Sheriff Mohsin, the military governor, was a harsh tyrant and that all the merchants hoped that there would be some form of British control in Jeddah. I made no comment and record it as it confirmed the opinion which we have always ^d, thatt townspeople of the Hedjaz are opposed to the Sheriff. Sheikh Muhammad Npssif is a nortlv man of about 50 with a large benevolent face, blacK beam and gold rimmed spectacles. His family migrated from Egypt three centuriesS3 ago. He is one of the principal merchants of the town and is said to steer clear of politics. He enquired anxiously as to what had become of the S. S. “ Firuze ”, a ship which had left Bombay two and-a-half months before with about £70,000 worth of goods belonging to Jeddah merchants, and had been stopped at Aden owing to the imposition of the blockade. The Captain of the “ Dufferin ” kindly telegraphed the next day to Aden about her and found that she had arrived at Aden from Colombo on May 5th with a cargo of rice, sugar and dhall for Jeddah, had been kept waiting for some time and had finally dis charged everything there and returned to Bombay. It would be an action much appreciated by the Jeddah merchants if something could be done to expedite the despatch of this cargo, and I suggest that the Resident, Aden, be asked to look into the matter. On .our way back to the landing place we met the two guns en route for Jeddah, the Egyptian soldiers having discharged their straw hats for Kufiyas of a brilliant green and pink. During the course of the evening I received news that 98 tons of rice and 38 tons of flour had arrived at Port Sudan and that a letter from the Idrisi to the Sheriff would be there on July 5th. The Sheriff was duly informed of this. Earoki also handed me a letter (Appendix VI) containing the Sheriff’s ultimatum to the Turkish Government, in case any harm befell his brother Nazir Ibn Ali at Constantinople. This was forwarded to you in my telegram 006 of the same date. Late the same night came the news that there was trouble at Rabegh. Colonel Wilson will doubtless submit a full report to the Sirdar in due course so I will merely recapitulate briefly what happened. Soon after R. I. M. S., “ Hardinge’s ” arrival at Rabegh on the evening of July 29th an Arab came on board and was told that a ship was arriving next morning and that as many dhows as possible were required. He promised to arrange and said that Sheikh Hussein Mabeiriq would come off at 10 a.m. H. M. S. “ Anne ” arrived at 9 a.m. on the 30th, the dhows came alongside and proceeded to get ready to land the horses. The Captain of R. I. M. S. “ Hardinge ” then lowered a boat and made towards the shore in order to arrange a place for the disembarkation. An empty dhow from the “ Anne passed him on the way in and he noticed the Reis hastily collecting number of men and sending all the women and children inland. When he came near the shore about 20 men took up their position behind an upturned boat, levelled their rifles and threat ened to fire if he came any closer. He accordingly returned, passing on his way all the dhows from the “ Anne ”, and found that the Reis had told an Egyptian officer that the soldiers could not be Moslems since they were not wearing hats, that no orders had been received about their arrival and that they would not be allowed to land. The Captain reported to Jeddah and sent his interpreter in to try and get into touch with Sheikh Hussein but without success. The interpreter was told by an Arab that the Sheikh had said he would neither come off nor receive anyone on shore. About 5 p.m. a Turkish flag was clearly seen floating from one of the chief houses at Rabegh. The “ Surada” arrived next morning and Sheriff Nazir at once went on shore with the interpreter but after going a few yards the latter was sent back. He was told that 9,000 Arabs had come down to oppose the land ing, that there were four Turks in the town and that had he gone on he would certainly have been killed. Sheriff Nazir did not return till 7. P.M., when he said that Sheikh Hussein had objected to the landing because an officer had told the Reis of a dhow that the troops would be landed by force. This was obviously untrue. Sheriff Nazir requested that the supplies might be landed and the batteries remain on board until he had communicated with the Sherifs Eeisal and Ali. This would take at least four days. Major Pearson, in consequence of the attitude of the Arabs and of representations made by the Egyptian officers on board, recommended that the troops should be raturned to Jeddah and in this Colonel Wilson concurred. The blame for this unfortunate incident—and it was doubly unfortunate owing to the urgent need of thesupplies at Medina—rest primarily with the Sheriff for neglecting to warn Sheikh Hussein Mabeiriq, although Colonel Wilson had several times asked him to do so. Had Sheriff Nazir arrived in the first ship matters might have been arranged but as it was, a whole day passed, during which the interpreter picked up various alarming rumours from irresponsible people which he spread broadcast through the ship. Sheikh Hussein Mabeiriq is supreme in his own territory and has always been independent of the Sheriff. He obviously did not want the troops and Sheriff Nazir’s request for a delay of four days was evidently in order that he might find out where else they would he landed. On the morning of July 1st I went ashore to pay a call on Sheriff Mohsin Ihn Mansur El Karimi, the military governor of the town, who had arrived from Mecca the day before. The whole town was asleep, it being the first day of Bamadan. After being kept waiting for some time I was shown upstairs and found him lying on a divan suffering from a high fever. I therefore cut short my visit and merely gave him a message from Colonel Wilson about the happening at Eabegh. He asked me to inform the Sheriff by telephone which I did. The Sheriff seemed to attach little importance to the incident and said that Sheriff Nazir would put things right when he arrived. Sheriff Mohsin is a verv fine type of Arab, tall and straight, with piercing grey eyes and a black beard streaked with grey. He gives one a greater impression of strength and resolution than most Arabs. Soon after my return to the ship, Sheikh Ahmed Talaat, the clerk of Sheriff Mohsin, came on board and said that he had received a telephone message from the Sheriff to the effect that too large a number of men had been going on shore from the ships, that the inhabitants weie upset and that he must therefore request that no one should land except the Captain, Colonel Wilson and myself and then only when we had business. We informed him that the Sheriff’s instructions would be observed and that we ourselves wished to go ashore early next morning about the Eabegh affair. He accordingly promised to send horses to meet us and departed. Baroki, who had been summoned by the Sheriff, returned presently and repeated the order but said that it applied to all of us and not only to the ship s crews. I insisted on his giving me a written notification of this order, since it varied from that of the military governor, and after dinner we discussed the situation with Colonel Wilson and the Captain of the “ Dufferin”. On asking Earoki what was the real reason of the order, he replied that the town was perfectly safe but that certain people had been saying that the Sheriff was as much in the hands of the British as the Turks were in the hands of the Germans and that rumours like this were causing harm. It was therefore necessary that we should communicate any business we had m writing. He also said that feheritt Mohsin had ordered soldiers to be at the landing stage and that probably any attempt to land w r ould be resisted. Colonel Wilson said that his business could otlIv be done on shore and that the landing of the stores and^ batteries migh be indefinitely delayed and I informed Earoki that unless permission was given to us to land, I should be obliged to represent tbs matter to the High Com missioner. He then consented on condition that we did not talk any politics ^ the town. At his urgent request I tore up the written notification which he evidently viewed in the light of a damaging piece _ of evidence against himself. Erom the fact that (a) the first remark of Sheriff Mohsin at our next meeting was that we could come ashore freely whenever we had any business and (bf that the Sheriff next morning without a moment s ^sBation gave me uermission to visit the British Consulate, we were all forced to the c ; ono1 ^- * Earnki had deliberately exceeded the Sheriff s instructions m the Xt tfkeep us away^from Jeddah. The same opposition had been shown to Colonel Wilson by jLiil Effendi before my arrival. The only reasons that we occasions as on all others he has been perfectly frank and tnen ..Colonel Wilson, Captain Warren, Faroki and myself went ashore early on July 2nd, and proceeded straight to Sheriff Mohsin's house. The police, with whom Earoki had threatened us, were so far absent that we could not find one to show us the way. We found Sheriff Mohsin better but hardly able to stand. He had asked for the ship’s doctor the previous day, but as Earoki had objected, saying that the Sheriff’s own physician was attending him, we had not pressed the point. It subsequently came to light that Sheriff Mohsin is in great dread of being poisoned by this physician and so was not very appre ciative of the Sheriff’s care of his health. Our visit only lasted a few minutes and after failing to get any reply to our telephone calls downstairs we went round to the exchange. After waiting nearly an hour the Sheriff came to the telephone ; the matter was explained to him by Earoki and he at once said that everything should be landed at Jeddah. Disembarkation accordingly began the same afternoon. While we were waiting the following telegram came for me from him:— “ To the Hon’ble Captain Cornwallis, Representative of His Excellency the High Commissioner on board the Man-of-War off Jeddah. “As soon as you receive this, please forward it by wireless to His Excellency in Egypt. Said Bey has arrived Mecca with two mountain guns and has been making difficulties. He asked for an ambulance and an armourer for the two guns which we gave him in order to simplify matters. He is now making further difficulties which will not be to the good of the common cause. I beg that you will either send two aeroplanes as soon as possible to destroy the fort at Taif, which is about 150 ks. from Jeddah, or order Said Bey to go to Taif, or send two quick-firing guns of the latest pattern in addition to any asked for before. Please arrange one of the above alter natives as soon as possible. I beg you to reply. I urgently request you to give orders to whom it may concern to prevent the officers with the guns going to Medina from acting in the same way. July 2nd, 1916. “ Sheriff and Emir of Mecca, Hussein ”. About half an hour after the receipt of this, a message came through to cancel it. Evidently Said Bey had been asked to do something which was impossible from a military point of view and had refused. The employment of Egyptian troops in the Hedjaz is unpopular both with the Arabs and the Egyptians themselves. On leaving the landing stage on the way back I was handed two letters for the High Commissioner and one addressed to myself (Appendix VII). The latter contained a request for 250 tents and stated that the monthly requirements starting from July 1st would be 50,000 okes of flour, 70,000 okes of rice, 2,000 okes coffee and 2,000 okes of sugar; three quarters to be landed at Rabegh and one quarter at Jeddah. As the Sheriff is reckoning to feed not only his army but also the indigent civil population it appears probable that the above is underestimated and that a further demand will be received shortly. Earoki also informed me that the Sheriff wished J of the supplies still due to he landed at Rabegh and % at Jeddah and that he was very anxious for two ships to be detailed permanently for his requirements. The Sheriff also wants a sea-going yacht manned by Muhammadans, a request which I did not think necessary to forward by telegraph. About sunset, Earoki brought a letter from the Sheriff saving that he had heard from Sheikh Hussein Mabeiriq that the ships had arrived and that everything was being taken off. At the same time the ships themselves arrived hack at Jeddah. Early on July 3rd Earoki came to me to say that he had had a message from the Sheriff that he very urgently wanted 1,000 rides with 1,000 rounds per rifle at Rabegh. It appears that the Medina garrison, which numbers about 7,000 men, made a sortie from the town and inflicted heavy losses on the Arabs. As Earoki says that the Arabs only number 9,000 men, Medina cannot be seriously besieged. The Sheriff also sent a message complaining once more of the Japanese rifles and requesting that an officer should be ap,- pointed to see that only articles of good quality were sent to him.36 It h as been stated that 20 per cent, of Japanese rifles have burst, mostly at er firing a few rounds. I repeatedly asked to be given as many of these as possible m order that they might be examined in Cairo, but no notice was taken of my request beyond the usual vague assurances that they were being sent. One of the burst rifles was shown me on my arrival but I had little time to examine it and was unable to recover it subsequently. The Sheriff also sent a message to say that he no longer needed any Le Gras ammunition. It appears that he has been wanting this for several months and that there is no such ammunition as Aza, for which we have been searching. The confusion was due to the translator’s mistake. As I thought that the High Commissioner would like to know the condition of the British Consulate, I obtained the keys from the Chief of the Municipality and went over it on the morning of the 3rd. The Consulate is a large four storied building facing north, situated a few yards from the North Gate. It needs colour-washing and painting but no structural repairs. The only furniture left consists of three or four cheap cupboards and a few old chairs. There are two safes which were opened by the Turks and of which the keys are missing. I was informed unofficially that the Sheriff did not want the British Consul to hoist the British flag for the present. I took no notice of this and as matters stand, the Sheriff has agreed to allow him to •come in under a month. I strongly urge that the appointment be made without delay. If it is undesirable to give him the title of Consul, he might be called Assistant British Agent, and work under the officer whose appoint ment I have recommended on the last page of this report. I transferred to R. I. M. S. “ Hardinge ” during the course of the afternoon. Raroki, who had been summoned on shore by the Sheriff, returned with a message that no more stores were to be landed from H. M. S. “ Anne ” and that sambuks would be sent next morning to take them to Rabegh. I flagged this further change of plans to R. I. M. S. “ Dufferin ” as we steamed out. Baroki also gave me a letter from the Sheriff (Appendix VIII) in which he complained that the failure to land the batteries and supplies at Rabegh, in spite of the assurance from the Sheriff Nasir and Sheikh Hussein Mabeiriq that it would be safe tp do so, had adversely affected his position at Medina. The facts of the case bad evidently been misrepresented and all the blame placed on us. We arrived off Yenbo at 9 a.m. on the 4th instant, and Ruhi Eff. was sent to find out the latest news. A large crowd collected and presently a big fat man, who called himself Sheriff Ibn Abdullah, came off in a canoe. He said that Yenbo was in the hands of the Sheriff, that the tale of the Germans and their women, previously reported, was untrue, and that there were no Turks in the town. Having ascertained that the ship had no supplies for Yenbo, he said to Ruhi: “ You cannot land. Go away quickly.” His attitude was the reverse of friendly. On his return Ruhi saw a dozen Turkish soldiers in uniform. It is probable that Yenbo is in the hands of Arabs who care as little for the Sheriff and the English as do those of Rabegh. Jamil Effendi Rajei. —On my arrival at Jeddah, I found that Jamil Effendi Rafei, who is an employe in the Sudan Agency in Cairo, and who was sent to Jeddah as the Secretary of Earoki, had been treating the English officers there with consistent rudeness. At the first meeting between Colonel Wilson, Captain Warren and Sheriff Zeid, he had sat on a table with his tarbush off and neglected at any time during the conversation to give Colonel Wilson the titles which his rank of Pasha demanded. This was a deliberate act of dis courtesy, as Jamil Effendi is a Government servant and cannot plead ignorance. He told Colonel Wilson that the Sheriff had appointed (him ?) his Civil Re presentative in Jeddah, a statement which was not in accordance with facts. On two occasions he was very rude and off-handed to the Captains of R. L M. S. “ Dufferin ’’ and R. I. M. S. ** Hardinge ” and actually paid a call on the latter in his pyjamas. At my first meeting with Sheriff Zeid he repeated to me the tale that he was Civil Representative in Jeddah, and added that Sheriff Zeid was merely looking after some arrangements about camels. I, had to check him37 sharply on two occasions during my interview with Sheriff Zeid, firstly, when he rucMy snatched up my letters to the Sheriff which were lying on the table at my side, and again, when he broke into my conversation with Faroki m TSh. I believe that the Sheriff was also annoyed with him He lived m the Governor’s house and in about two days after his arrival had gained complete influence over Sheriff Zeid and was managing all the affairs of the tow, He sent a letter purporting to come from Sheriff Mohsin to the Sirdar, in which he very broadly hinted that Colonel Wilson would be doing better work governing his province. I showed the letter to Sheriff Mohsin after wards. 0 He was very annoyed and said that both Jamil and Faroki were no better than Turks and that the letter was a complete fabrication. Jamil Effendi made no difficulties about returning to Cairo. Beopening of trade.-In Appendix III will be found the SherifTs request to reopen the trade of the whole Hedjaz coast. I have already telegraphed to you about raising the blockade as far south as Lith, which the Sheriff wishes to use as his port for provisioning the Asir army. In this connection I would point out that the reopening ol trade will merely mean a return to the conditions of two months ago. To allow the passage of such things as sugar, petroleum and other luxuries, it is necessary to cancel the existing regulation and publish a new one. I recommend this being done in the case of Jeddah only. A cone of sugar costs Us. 8 in Jeddah and other commodities are in pro portion. It is very necessary that prices should be normal before the influx of pilgrims. Turkish prisoners .—There are about 1,700 men and 60 officers in Jeddah. The officers live in houses in the town, the men in barracks at the south-east corner of the town, Earoki asked me to go and see them one afternoon but afterwards said that it was inconvenient. Officers' servants are freely allowed into the town to buy food. Earoki separated the Arabs from the Turks and made certain changes in the diet. I have no reason to believe that the prisoners are not being well treated. The Sheriff evidently intends to keep them as hostages. Cable .—The cable ship “Cambria ” was expected shortly at Jeddah. It is not anticipated that extensive repairs will be necessary. The Sheriff does not want the Eastern Telegraph Company to have to do the working of the cable. He intends to have his own staff both at Jeddah and Suakin. Conclusions .—The fort of Jiyad with its garrison of 50 men and its three or four guns has fallen, and there remains the larger force of over 800 men defending the barracks. This force possesses no guns and is said to be holding out chiefly owing to the Sheriff’s desire to avoid bloodshed. Tke Egyptian batteries will probably force it to capitulate. Taif is a more difficult problem hut may reasonably be expected to surrender in course of time. Medina is the danger point. The garrison there is said to number 7,000 men and is commanded by an energetic General, Eakhri Pasha. He has already made a sortie from the town and inflicted severe losses on the Arabs, who altogether do not number more than 9,000. There is always the possibility that he may try to march south and force an issue with the Sheriff. The water and transport difficulties are immense but not insuperable. Our experience at Babegh and Yenbo showed how slender is the Sheriff’s control over the Arabs of the outlying districts. Another defeat might have serious effects on their morale. The Sheriff has no trained officers of any sort with him—but only tribal Sheikhs leading their undisciplined followers. It is important to sent hack by U. I. M. S. “ Hardinge ” an Arab military mission. They will put new life and confidence into the Arabs. To conquer—or at any rate contain— the Medina garrison is the most important question at the moment. The Sheriff’s dream of an advance on Syria is impossible of realisation for a long time to come. Government in the Hedjaz is in a state of chaos. There is no one who has any idea of organisation. The smallest details are referred to the Sheriff by telephone and he can have no time to work out a proper scheme of government or see things from a broad standpoint. The townspeople of Jeddah think well of him personally but fear his Sheriffs and are equally suspicious of any ArabsSB Vho may be sent from Cairo to govern them. The Sheriff in order to conciliate both his own Sheriffs and the Arab party in Cairo is going to put the former in as Governors, the latter as their Advisers. This means a double pay-list and perhaps a two-fold toll from the merchants. Jeddah is at present a hot bed of intrigue; all the chief men are striving to secure a niche for themselves and are quite indifferent as to the means employed to gain their ends. The townspeople hate the Arabs, the Arabs return the feeling with interest and are deeply suspicious of each other. Broadly speaking, they are divided into two opposin'* factions, the one led by Sheriff Mohsin and the other by Aodel Latif Ef Muzeini, the Harbour Master. The Agent of Sheriff Moshm told me himself that neither he nor his master dared to eat or drink outside of their own house and doubtless their opponents are equally careful. The most satisfactory way of administrating Jeddah would be to appoint a British Adviser to a Hedjazi Governor like Sheriff Mohsin. The Arab party in Cairo, who do not want anything from England except an unlimited supply of fold supplies and munitions, would cry out that local Moslem opinion woSld never sanction this, but the fact that Sheriff Mohsin has himself said that he would welcome an English Adviser shows that their objection i* without justice. It would be advisable to give such an Adviser some unpre tentious title, so as to avoid drawing attention to his real functions. These would be to act as the connecting link between the British Government an the Sheriff, with a free hand to settle all questions of detail as r ®g ar ^ s landing of stores and the like, and also to exercise an undefined though real control over the organisation of municipal affairs at Jeddah. In addition to an official with consular experience (to be called bis a^stant), he won d rpmiire a British officer to assist him and a small staff of clerks. It wouia alsTbe as well to send a trustworthy officer of the Egytian army who has had eXP 1reXLtin\^enfa U Native Adviser nominated by the Arab party.

K. Cornwallis, Captain, Cairo ; The 8th July 1916.39 Appendix I. The following is a summary of the Sheriff’s requirements :• I. Military. 1. 2 . 3. 4. 5. 6 . 7. 8 . 9. 10 . (a) For immediate action. 7.000 rifles, of which 1,000 are very urgently required at Rabegh. 5.300.000 rounds of S. A. A., of which 1,000,000 are very urgently required at Rabegh. 50 kilos, of dynamite. 500 hand bombs. 5 trained Moslem armourers for the repairs of both rifles and guns. Two or three Moslem experts in explosives; about whom Colonel Wilson has already telegraphed to the Sirdar. 250 tents at Rabegh. 50.000 okes of flour Monthly requirements to start from July 1st. „ rice coffee y 70,000 2,000 „ „ 2,000 „ „ sugar (} to be landed at Rabegh and J at Jeddah.) The detailing of two ships permanently to carry the above. f of the supplies still due to be landed at Rabegh and Jeddah.) at (6) For immediate consideration. 1. The formation and equipment of a force of approximately 30,000 Hedjaz Arabs. 2. Collection, equipment and preliminary training of all Arab sym pathisers in British Prisoners-of-War Camps. These to be subsequently sent to the Hedjaz to form the nucleus of the Arab army. 3. Possibly the maintenance of this army in the field, both in supplies and munitions. 4. The two extra mountain batteries, one howitzer battery, one field ambulance and two or four aeroplanes already asked for by Sheriff are included in the above scheme. XI. Political a^d Miscellaneous. 1. Official recognition by the Powers. 2. Official recognition by the Moslem world. (To be arranged by the Arabs themselves.) 3. ^ A monthly grant of £125,000 to be paid in gold from July 1st, 1916. This is required for the organisation and maintenance of Government. 4. The despatch of the Mahmal at the usual time. J** The raising of the blockade as far south as lath and the free entry to the Hedjaz of all articles. This inyolves cancelling the order now in force which only sanctions the import of necessities. 6. A sea-going yacht with a Moslem crew. I do not think that the Sheriff expects to get this. At all events, Paroki regards it as impossible. III.— Recommendations. 1. Immediate appointment of a British officer to act as liaison officer, or, it a thoroughly experienced and Anglophile Muhammadan cannot be ' i40 found, as adviser, under some unpretentious title, to the Hedjazi Governor of Jeddah. ^ He will need a junior British officer, an Egyptian officer from the Sudan Civil Service and some clerks. 2 . Immediate appointment of an official with Consular experience, hut without the title of Consul. He would work under the English Adviser, if appointed. 3. Appointment of two small committees, one Civil and one Military, composed of English and Arab members, if the Arab proposals are approved in their entirety. 4. Arranging for the cargo of the S. S. “ Eiruza”, now at Aden, to be forwarded to Jeddah. 5. Immediate dispatch of an experienced doctor, with an adequate staff, to Jeddah. Appendix II. Faroki’s Report to His Excellency General Clayton, C.M.G. To The friend of the Arab. My dear Sir, General Clayton, I present to your honour my best salaams and I heartily thank you for your kindness and good hospitality. Sir, I am intoxicated with my good luck which created the opportunity for me to be honoured by being in the presence of my Grand Master whom I found very well and very capable to administrate all the Arabs’ and Moslems’ affairs. He is more than fit to be their Grand Khalif, Governor and Director of their policy. All my dreams and desires can really be attained through him. He is very well informed of all the needs and the necessities, consequently I am quite pleased and rejoiced and in the meantime I am powerless to describe him, may God protect him for the Moslems in general and for the Arabs in particular. I have drunk the cup of happiness for being able to hit the mean Turks actually. You know, Sir, that I had worked for several years to humiliate the Turks politically and to have all happiness for the Arabs. Praise be to God who granted me the means and enabled me to fight against the Turks and smash them. Taking the Turks’ guns in Jeddah we brought them to Mecca—the Blessed—- and to-day we have fired at the barracks which is the only shelter for the Turks. We fired at it strongly by our Lord’s command (Sheriff’s) Sir, each gun I fired had echoed in my heart with pleasure and gladness. Neither the champagne, which the Honourable Mr. E. Storrs promised to drink with me after the Turks being defeated, nor any other thing in the world would please me more than hitting the Turks and destroying their barracks and killing their soldiers by their own guns. No better life than it is now. It is six days now that I have only few Hours’ sleep and this does not affect me nor the weariness. I thank God who guided me to such doing which none of my brethren whom you know and who are my partners, in such a luck. The political state concerning Great Britain in Turkey. The Arabic and Turkish newspapers issued in Syria and Constantinople publish many an article against Great Britain. They state that Great Britain is^ a cheating power who always gives unfulfilled promises, and it is tyrannical 5 its policy is based upon ambition; its mere desire is to annihilate the people, and stain^ the world with blood; it is a bitter enemy to the Moslems and the Arabs, neither its words nor its treaties are to be depended upon. The Turks are preparing greater forces to attack Egypt. The papers state also that the first attempt was only a test of the enemy’s power, but the next attempt will smash the English in Egyptj w^i 0 ^ will be the grave of theEnglish, and that they will ask the Egyptians to create disturbances and call the help of the noble Arabs for such a conspicuous conquest. These papers are distributed gratuitously. I myself had seen their paper called 'El-Ttai El Am”, full of such statements and distributed freely. The political state of the Jrafis.—The news which we received in Egypt concerning the hanging up, the deportation anA the imprisonment in Syria was true. They hung lately Sayed Abdul Ttahun-el-^ahrawi who was a member in the Senate and President of the Arabian Congress held in d^-ns, Shafic El-Moayad, Abdul Aziz El-Arces and others were also murdered, ihey finrntp.hed the tomb of the late Amir Abdul Kadir-el-Jazayn. The Syrian papers are puffing Jamal Pacha a great deal as they used to do for Eerex-Abdul Hamid and it seemed that they were compelled to do so with the exception of “ El-Alam El Islami ” edited by Abdul -A. 2 ! 8 Shawish in Constantinople; and “El-Shark ” (the orient) edited by Shakeil Anslam m Syria. The above named papers may praise the Turks and their Sultans, and the courage of the troops. They abuse the English and slam^ their honour because of the Dardanelles and Gout Elemara. They are exerting their zeal to stir the Arabs and the Egyptians against the English. They abuse also the people who are working for uplifting the Arabs. The editor of “El-Shark” expressed his joy on the day of El-Zahrawi’s murder. The political state in Medjaz. —All the people of Hedjaz bear obedience to our Lord and all are devoted to his cause, as I told you before, and they are ready to give up their lives in his path and none would object to carry out his commands. Such a spirit is possessed by the people in Yemen and Neja. All speak of the independence of the Arabs under the suzerainty of our Grand Lord whom they all call “ our Lord ” and the “ Lord of All ”. All the Arabs are glad to learn of our Lord being an Ally to Great Britain, to have in all their affairs, When they find themselves lacking some thing they say ; “ our true friends the English will send it to us ”. They also say “ if the Turks would attack the Suez Canal before he attack them (Turks) in Syria and drive them out of it, we will take the side of the English and fi ght against the Turks ”. They really hate the Turks. The Turks who refuse to surrender to the Arabs they call them infidels (Kafirs). In short, if the Allies will use a better policy in dealing with the Arabs, they will find the Arabs quite useful to them and specially for the English, more than they get from their Ally—Italy. The war state in Hedjaz. —All the Arabs are fighting men together with their children and septuagenarians. It is very easy for our Grand Lord to levy from 160,000 to 250,000 fighting men from the Hedjaz alone with the exception of Yemen, Nejd, Enez tribes, &amp;c., and such fighting people are devoted to our Lord’s cause—they are courageous, intelligent, contented and of good characteristics. They can bear all difficulties and hardships and never take them into consideration. They lack constructors and trainers. If the Arab officers would come and train them I am sure they will make the best of soldiers upon earth for courage, contentedness and devotion to their ruler whom they loye intensely, and also for ability to stand hunger and thirst and trust one another. I thought, in such time there would be much looting and robbery, but, to my astonishment, nothing happened of this sort and security is established everywhere in all Hedjaz. Our Grand Lord has used in this blessed rise about 15,000 men only, to fight against the Turks in Hedjaz. The number of Turks here is as I told you before. The Turks besieged in Medina are under command of Eakhir Pasha, whom I was the aide-de-camp of, and who was the Commander of the 12th Division. Jeddah has surrendered and plenty of ammunition, guns and machine guns were captured.42 -' c rT Taif is besieged. Arabs won many a battle at Medina and Taif, as news comes daily from 5 there. Mecca barracks is besieged strongly and its quick surrender is expected daily. The Arabs who were among the Turkish troops shall join in our Lord s service with the Arabs. I took 6 soldiers of the captured battery in Jeddah for firing at Mecca barracks after explaining to them how the Turks were and are oppressors. Just see that great diSerence ’’-they were firing at us before long, and now they are firing at the Turks. They are quite happy and pleased to fi e at them. The Turkish forces in Syria number from 35,000 to 40,000. ^ The things which we talked about long ago concerning the organisation of the Government and the army, met our Lord’s approval and he knows everything? He told me to do what is necessary Goneequently X shall come to Cairo to settle all about the things required when my Lord gives me permission. Accept my salaams. ^ : Mohammed Shekief, M’Faroki.

Secondly, as the war is going on between my sons (who are camping around Medina) and the Turkish army; and as they are in need of supplies and war materials, of which there is a sufficient quantity for the moment stored at Port Sudan, please give orders that they should be sent to Rabegh as soon as we ask for it, in a ship, and the other lot, especially the two batteries and one Abus with all their necessary requirements, which will be, through your energy, of the latest pattern, ready with one mobile ambulance at Port Sudan, to ask for when needed. Thirdly, all the supplies sent to us from Port Sudan were in very small sacks, the two of which equal to one ordinary sack. Accept my great respect. Rated Skaaban 1834. The Sheriff and Emir of Mecca, Hussein. Appendix IV. In the name of God, the most merciful, the compassionate. s&lt; 0 our Lord Judge between us and between our people in truth ” si Thou art the best of Judges ”. This is a copy of our Proclamation to all our brother Moslems. It is well known that the first people who recognised the Turkish Gov ernment, amongst the Moslem Eulers and Emirs, were the Emirs of Mecca (the blessed) in order to unite the Moslems in the world and to establish their Society (Islam) because the late Ottoman Sultans (may the dust of their tombs be blessed and may Paradise be their residence) were acting in har mony with the Holy Book and the Ordinances (Sunna) of the Prophet (prayers be upon him) and because they were devoted to the carrying out of God’s Commandments; for the above exalted reasons, the Emirs referred to are still adhering to them (the Commandments). Verily I have caused the Arabs under my personal command to rise against the Arabs (in Yemen) in 1338, in order to raise the siege of Abha and to protect the honour of the Ottoman Empire. In the following year a similar rising took place under the personal command of one of my sons and he (Abdulla) is even now in command of part of my forces. The Emirs were still following the Ottoman Empire until the Government of the Union and Progress Society was organised and laid their hands upon the administration of the country and all its affairs which resulted in its (the country’s) decrease (in prestige) and the destruction of its grandeur as is quite evident to the whole world, and also owing to their entering the present war and putting their country in a state of commotion which is also clear to everv- body. All this was done for certain aims which are well known but are of such a bad character that our feelings do not allow us to mention them, and also their aims made every Moslem’s heartache and sad for the Moslem Empire, and the disruption and murdering of its people without distinction, some by44 hanging, some by treachery and some by deportation in a cruel manner, in spite of what has befallen them (their departed) such as loss of many relatives caused by the inflictions caused by the war, and the Holy Land was also affected by such calamities which made the middle classes sell the doors of their houses, their chests of drawers and even the wood from the ceilings of their houses after selling all their furniture and clothes in order to appease their hunger. It seems that the Union and Progress could not have considered this sufficient for its object, as it has done that which would loosen the only tie between the Ottoman Empire and the Moslems of the whole world, which tie is the adherence to the Book (Koran) and to the “ Sunna ”; one of the news papers issued at Constantinople “ El Tgtihad ”, by name, had written the biography of the prophet (the prayer and peace of God be upon him) in a very disrespectful manner (God forbid !) such biography was seen and heard by the Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire and also its Sheikh-ul-Islam, the Ulema, the Aliens, the Ministers and the notables. This was followed by the cancellation of God’s words (concerning inheritance) “ The male must obtain the double of the female ” and made them (male and female) equal in inheritance, and this Government Union and Progress stated also what should be considered the uprooting and destruction of one of the five corner stones of Islam and that is the fasting of Ramadan, as the Government (Ottoman) gave orders that the troops who are at Medina, Mecca and Syria were not to fast, under the pretence that their colleagues are fighting on the pretence of Runia, whilst this statement is against the following words of God :— “ Those who are sick or on a journey, &amp;c. ” and such things are not in harmony with Islamic principles. The law on these points is perfectly clear to everybody. Afterwards they (the Union and Progress) destroyed the prestige of the Sultan of Turkey and robbed him of the right of selecting a^ Chief for his own Personal Cabinet and prevented him from looking after the interest of Islam and the welfare of his country and its people, and many other things which meant the destruction of the Khalifate conditions which all Moslems demand, and they ignored the interests of all Moslems. We Emirs of the Holy Land, continue to conceal such venturous doings in order to escape the dispersion of the people and not to create disunion amongst Moslems but finally what they (Turks) concealed became disclosed and the cover was removed and it then became clear that the Ottoman Empire is in the hands of Enver Pacha, Jemal Pacha and Talaab Bey, who administrate it as they like and do whatever they like. The evident proof of what has been mentioned above is what has been sent lately to the Kadi of the Muhammadan Court of Mecca, that he should consider in his judgments the evidence written m the Court before him and not Consider any evidence that is written by the Moslems amongst themse yes, neglecting the verse in the cow, and, on the other hand, hanging at one time of 21 men among the learned Moslems and the Chiefs of Arabs. Amongst them being— Shefik Beh El Moayad, Shrukri Bey El Asli, Abdel Wahab-el-Trijlisi, Tewfik Bey-al-Bassat, Ab d- el- H amid-el- Zara wi, Abd-el-Ghani-el-Alussi, Emir Arif-el-Shahabi, El Emir Omar, and the rest are also well known men. . ' j .. No doubt that even the cruelest people would not commit such murder as kiUing such people all at once in one hour, even ferocious animals could not do such a thing.45 Suppose that they had an excuse for murdering these people what right have they to deport their bereaved and innocent families with children and old men and women, the ladies of high birth, delicately brought up, in such a manner as to melt the heart of anyone and make him sad. They have # chastised them severely without limit in spite of their losing the head of their family. God said. “ No punishment must be inflicted on anyone for the sins of others. ” If we can ever find an excuse for such things, what right had they to confiscate all their lands and personal property and the houses in which they lived also the money they had in their possession after losing their beloved. If we closed our eyes to all this and suppose we say they have an excuse for these misdeeds, what excuse can be found for their action in digging up the crave of the Grand Emir and ascetic person our Lord Sayed-el-Sherif Abdel Kadir-el-Jezyrly-el-Hassani and taking out his blessed bones and scattering them. All the above is a brief account of what they have done and it is left for all the world in general, and Moslems in particular to judge. Another proof which expresses what has been concealed in their (Union and Progress) hearts for the religion (Islam) and the Arabs is their shelling the “ Ancient House ” (Kaaba) about which God said “ and sanctify My House for all Comers It (Kaaba) is the “ Kibla ” of all the Moslems and the Kaaba of the Unitarians, and two shells of their big guns were fired at it when the country rose for independence. One of the shells fell on the Black Stone about two yards from the edge (of the roof) and the second fell about 3 yards short of the Black Stone (Kaaba) and the curtain (Kiswa) of the Kaaba was set on fire, which thousands and thousands of Moslems ran to extinguish making loud shouts of mourning and anger and they were compelled to open the door of the house and climb to the roof, in order to put out the fire. They did not stop at the second, but sent a third shell at the Sepulchre of Abraham. Bits of the shell reached the mosque, which was their target for the whole time for all their bombs and shells, and every day three or four persons were killed in the mosque, until it became very difficult for the people to come near the Kaaba. We shall have to leave the verdict on all this conduct and disrespect for the House of God to all the Moslem world. Yes, we leave the verdict, on all their conduct and disrespect for the House of God to the Moslem world, but we will never leave our religion and nationality to be the plaything of the U nion and Progress Government. God (blessed is He) had given the country the opportunity to take action and rise. And He guided it by H is fervent might to obtain its in dependence and He also crowned its endeavours with prosperity and victory after it had been destroyed by the maladministration of the Turkish employees in its garrison. The country is actually independent and is entirely separated from the country which is still under the suzerainty of the enemy (The Union and Progress Committee) ; it is an absolute independence and nothing cannot be interfered with by any foreign country or Power. The only aim intended is to cause victory for the religion of Islam and to exalt the Moslem’s state based on the principles of the Muhammadan law to which we shall now return and lean upon in all our judgments and judicial principles and branches, preparing it to accept all that which is in harmony with the religion and all that leads to the Mountain of Islam. In this movement (the rising) we are trying to do our best for the education of all classes of people according to the needs and ability. This is what we undertook to do religiously on our part begging of our brother Moslems in all the world to do also what they think it incumbent upon them religiously for establishing the fraternal Islamic bond.46 % We beseech the Lord of Lords for the sake of the Prophet of the all giving King (God) to grant us prosperity and to guide us to the welfare of the Islam and the Moslems. We depend upon God, the Great, who is our sufficient Defender. The Sheriff and Amir of Mecca, [Seal.] El Hussein Ibn Aly. 25th Shaaban 1334. Appendix V.

His Excellency the Eminent Vizier and High Commissioner in Egypt, With the fingers of esteem and respect I received the letter of the Grand Vizier dated 15th Shabaan 1334, which contained the congratulations and compliments on what God has granted us in freeing the country from the oppression and evil of the enemy. In very truth, God has brought it about that our endeavours are success ful and there remains only a garrison in a high fort m the Holy Town of Mecca, Jiyad by name, and its garrison is not now more than 50 persons, hut the barracks outside the town are strongly fortified having a garrison of more than 800. The Vali and his people, both civil and military, took refuge in the fort of Taif. In Mecca we have contented ourselves with little fighting in order to save bloodshed, being well assured of the ultimate result of the siege. The garrison is cut off from water. In Taif in the last battle my son, Abdulla, who commands the force there, captured a gun with a number of men and he has surrounded the fort on all sides. We are awaiting the two guns which you have sent with your energy and which will be sent to him to-morrow from here, and no doubt on their arrival God will grant him the fall of the fort. We consider that nothing is so important now as the^ operation of the troops of the enemy and other forces on the Northern Prontier , consequently we have sent a maxim battery and the remainder of the other battery via Babegh to strengthen the troops of my other sons who are camping there. We hope that on the first opportunity after the fall of the above-mentioned forts we will reinforce them with the extra forces now scattered all over the country. Through the help of God all the country is being managed without any opposition and is completely quiet and contented. In conclusion I beg you to accept my best regards. 30th Shaahan 1334.

His Excellency the Eminent Vizier, With all sorrow and regret I received your noble letter, issued in Cairo on the 18th Shabaan 1334, which brought the news of the death of the distin guished soldier, Lord Kitchener. The existence of those who will fill his position and act his part amongst the sons of Great Britain and the subjects of His Majesty will make us forget our grief and our lost hopes. Indeed ages are fixed, and I beg to express my consolation to His Majesty the King on account of his bereavement. Only the existence of His Majesty will remove the mourning of Great Britain for his death. May God grant us his mercy and benevolence. With my best salaams to Your Excellency.

The honourable and most respectable Captain Cornwallis, We have learnt from the letter of His Excellency The High Commis- 'sioner, Sir Henry McMahon, dated 15th Shabaan 1334, that your honour has been appointed his representative at Jeddah in order to expedite all our demands and needs. Earoki Bey also informed us of the same yesterday as you know and no further explanation is needed. To fulfil our promise, we have instructed Earoki Bey to inform you that our monthly requirements are in accordance ■with the list appended which we wrote in order to confirm what he had told him. We also wish to bring to your notice the fact that we had previously asked His Excellency for 20,000 sacks of rice, 15,000 sacks of flour, 150 sacks of coffee, 150 sacks of sugar, 1,000 sacks of barley and 5,000 rifles with ammunition and various kinds of cartridges and that all the above should be ready at Port Sudan. The reply of His Excellency showed that they were in readiness. We asked for a consignment of 1,500 rifles, 100 sacks of flour, 50 sacks of rice and 30 sacks of coffee to be sent to Babegh and this was done together with 500 sacks of dura and 500 sacks of dukha. Since then several different consignments have been sent, of which we have no details, except in the case of the rifles, a certain number of which our son Zaid asked you to send to Babegh when you met him at El Badia. We also asked for 4,000 sacks of what was stored to be sent to Babegh but from recent correspondence I do not think that this was done. In conclusion accept my best regards.

It is quite impossible in the opinion of us both for representatives of both Idrisi and Sheriff to leave Kunfida; merchants would be robbed by Arabs if not murdered. His Majesty’s ship at Kunfida has orders to leave on August 8th and is endeavouring to get Idrisi garrison away in time {sic?). ^ Sheriff to have Kunfida now and final decision to be considered after the war is the only possible solution. “ I have got a message out of Sheriff to-day for his representative there which I am sending by wireless telegraphy to-morrow to the effect that he is to see that no looting, &amp;c., occurs. I consider that as Boyle and 1 are here, matters should be left to us to do as best we can on the principle that Idrisi’s garrison has to leave; serious results may otherwise result as communications take so long. Boyle who has seen this telegram entirely concurs. ” Ends. I have authorised Wilson to act as he thinks best in conjunction with Commander Boyle in view of the urgency of the situation.

Idrisi, with whom I have had personal interview, points out that summary ejectment of bis garrison in 48 hours will prejudice his prestige with his tribes seriously. He wishes to confer with his tribesmen and further to meet representative of Sheriff and asks for 20 days 1 grace. He will hold us responsible for safety of his garrison if 48 hours’ limit is enforced, and ceasing offensive against Turks he will attack Sheriff. Ends.50 Our wisest course I think is to get a written agreement from Sheriff before his party enters Kunfida that his occupation is temporary only and that he will submit question of Kunfida to our adjudication after the war. This will be shown to Idrisi and should soothe him. Pour parlors between re presentatives of the parties I do not recommend as likely to cause a fracas. Finally, I would suggest, looking to Arab slow ways, a lO-days* time-limit for evacuation of Idrisi’s garrison.

From—The Arab Bureau, Basrah, To The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. Present situation of desert side is as follows. Some days ago^ Bin Bashid turned homewards and is reported to have reached Hail. Owing to active hostility of Aslam, Dhafir and Zayyad towards him and his inability to obtain ^supplies his position in Shamiyah had become untenable.^ Failure of Turks to send him support as promised and by news of activity of Bin Sand’s Lieutenants in neighbourhood of Hail also influenced him no doubt. The latter apparently, how r ever, did not feel in strong enough position to deny Bin Bashid entry into Hail and after taking ^ much booty and a number of Abdah and Shawayah prisoners they have withdrawn to Qasim. All tribal elements in Shamiyah in the meanwhile with one or two exceptions have either come or are seeking to come into specific friendly relations with us. Thus the Aiman have sent in Sultan Al Hithlain and another Sheikh to Chief Political Officer and given written undertaking to maintain security of caravan routes and remain obedient to orders in neighbourhood of Safwan. Tbe section of Harb who were with Bin Bashid have submitted to Ibn Tuwallah and asked for his intervention with us. Ibn Tuwallah remains encamped between Khamisiyah and Zobair and accepts responsibility for caravan route between those places and for protection of survey and railway making parties. The Dhafir and Zayyad west of Khamisiyah are^actively operating against Aiaimi’s following in expectation either of driving him to take refuge with Bm Bashid or to come to heel. Abdeh who were wdth Bin Bashid and moved westwards to desert west of Nejef after leaving him have not yet come m and also Dhaidan Al Hithlain of Ajman who left m their company with a few personal followers and probably joined Ajaimi. From the above it will be seen that situation as regards the desert tribes in our neighbourhood is satisfactory at present.

Every effort should be made to induce him to take reasonable view on lines of Resident at Agent s teleeram 234-A. P. Sheriff should however be asked his objection to allowing Idrisi to occupy Kunfida, and it should be pointed out to him clearly for future guidance that Idrisi is our ally and that it is owing to us that he is supporting the Sheriff actively instead of threatening his flank. Shenff, therefore, owes it to His Majesty’s Government on whose general support he is so largely dependent and whose good intentions (see your telegram 671) he fully recognises to abstain even temporarily from enforcing claims which so far from contributing to Arab unity can only have effect of defeating sole purpose for which we are helping him. All efforts should be concentrated on defeating the Turks. His Majesty’s Government have no intention of taking sides in Arab disputes but will use their good offices to mediate after the war. Opportunity should also be taken to make Sheriff understand that he must not address any ultimatum to His Majesty’s Government. _ Ends. We appreciate Idrisi’s loyal attitude and you will realise the importance of makine the withdrawal as little distasteful to him as possible.

From—The General Officer Commanding, Singapore, To—The Chief of the General Staff, Simla. Following report can be made as a result of quiet talks with leading Arabs and judicious probing of Muhammadan feeling. 1. Arabs received with profound indignation the news of the execution by the Turkish Government of a number of Arabs including Saiyid Abdul Hamid A1 Zahrawi. This news was received here recently through Al Ahram of Cairo. Intelligent opinion regards the execution of Saiyid as Turkish political suicide as far as Arabia is concerned. 2. Local Arabs are much exercised because of resignation of Sheikh U1 Islam Hairi Effendi. There is much speculation over the reasons for his resig nation. Some put it down to serious differences of opinion with Turkish Gov ernment on Koranic issues of importance. 3. On occasion of Kamzan Id, Saiyid Omar Alsagoff, an Arab merchant prince of Singapore, telegraphed to Sheriff of Mecca congratulations on latter s move for independence and wishing him success. Sheriff, on August 3rd, replied thanking him for his good wishes. 4 I have received a written offer from Alsagoff placing his extensive house property in Jeddah at the disposal of British Government. This offer has been passed to the Governor. Arab sentiment here is satisfactory with regard to Sheriff and his move. The svmpatbies of the other Muhammadans is gradually but slowly inclining to the Sheriff, but there is a great deal of indifference among Malays in Peninsular generally.53 According to reports from Kesident Magistrates of the Federated States, Malays in Selangor are generally indifferent except that now they can get into touch with relations and friends in Mecca; Indians are watching events but resent Aga Khan being mentioned as the leader. Peraks are indifferent; no information as to Indians there. Sympathy of Malays in Pahang is with the Arabs. In Negri Sembilan the Malays are indifferent but the more orthodox Muhammadans in no way condemn the revolt. It is reported by the Consul-General, Batavia, that the Javanese are divided and bewildered not knowing who is at the head. No definite informa tion is given as to the Arabs. The following is other information from Arab source direct to me. In Java the majority of the Arabs do not take it as a fact and believe that British have circulated stories which are lies, hut if there is a revolt it would be gladly welcomed by Arabs. Opinion is same as Consul-GeneraPs with regard to Javanese. Arabs in Java are politically divided into two camps—Sheikhs are pro-German and in majority at least in Batavia and country; Saiyids are pro-ally even pro-British. Since the day revolt was known our efforts have been to restrain and guide feeling discreetly. So far results are gratifying. The official news of opening of Jeddah was received here with immense relief and gratitude. In view of hopes expressed by leading Arabs here who are personally acquainted with the Sheriff, the desirability of publishing the first four items is submitted for Consideration. It is probable that result obtained may give important lead to opinion of Muhammadans in other parts. 87 Telegram, dated (and received) the 5th August 1916, From—The Chief Secretary to the Government of Bengal, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Home Department.

Restoration of Kunfida garrison is agreed to provided he can save appearances with tribes, for which purpose he emphasises necessity of a meeting with Sheriff’s representative to enable him to explain to tribe that evacuation is not compulsion but a matter of policy, otherwise if Asir tribe believed he was being forced out, it would probably go over to enemy in view of Turkish military preparations at Saada and Abba.

Issues of “ Near East ” in question appear open to but little objection and Government of India” see no reason for withholding this. Government of India’s policy is to prevent publication of resolutions and discussions in India regarding Arab revolt as far as possible and only to pass telegrams giving bare facts of progress of revolt. It is, however, considered impossible to prevent dissemination of news and opinions from Europe coming in newspapers by mail and perhaps desirable that Moslem opinion should gradually get accustomed in this way to attitude of Allies towards Sheriff. Though subsidized, “ Near East” is not in any way official mouth-piece of Government and, unless it publishes definitely offensive news, as for instance military or naval assistance afforded by British Government to Sheriff, inter ference with it appears unnecessary. •X Ax.

Recent developments are as follows: Commander-imChiet, East Indies, telegraphed to Senior Naval Officer, Red Sea, on August 6th to (recall P) His Majesty’s ship from Kunfida and proceed to Jeddah to consult Colonel Wilson. These instructions were commumca ed by |emor Naval Officer, Red Sea, to “ Suva ” at Kunfida and ‘ Northbiook at Jeisan, and it was added that forty-eight hours’ notice of withdrawal should be given in order to allow Idrisi’s order for evacuation to reach garrison of Kunfida. Senior Naval Officer, Red Sea, added note of explanation to Idnsi that His Maiestv’s Government had decided that whole question must be left for decision later, and that presence of a British man-of-war was undesirable as it gave appearance of favouring one side more than the other. arthTof 5 BritisHy* whom Chad Teen .Sed at P Kunflda He asked for 20 da|s’ 'responsible for and to confe with She ff P fid * if ship left .

Ship had to leave, she was not responsible for garrison in any case and had orders not to fire if town was attacked. Rorty-eight hours was granted as an act of courtesy to Idrisi in case he wished to make use of her. Senior Naval Officer, Red Sea, further instructed “Northbrook ” to obtain pledge from Idrisi if possible that he would order his garrison to embark by August 28th at latest. On August 8th “Suva” from Kunfida wired: “All quiet. Situation has been discussed with Sheikhs who have been informed of impending departure of ship. With the exception of one who is ambitious of becoming Governor of Kunfida, all are in favour of withdrawal. ” Senior Naval Officer, Red Sea, in reply instructed “ Suva ” to do utmost to get garrison to agree to go. “ Northbrook ” wired on August 10th from Jeisan that Idrisi would certainly refuse to guarantee evacuation by August 28th, as all depended on satisfactory results of his meeting with Sheriff’s representative. “ Northbrook ” urged that Sheriff’s representative should be sent, as Idrisi meant business and crisis would be precipitated by evacuation of Kunfida without his orders. Senior Naval Officer, Red Sea, replied that he doubted whether strong enough line with Idrisi had been taken by “ Northbrook ”. It was decision of His Majesty’s Government that Idrisi’s garrison should leave Kunfida, and discussion ^vould not change this decision. Every facility should be given to evacuate, but Idrisi should be told that for him to attack Sheriff would be to declare hostilities on Great Britain and Allies. Ship would be withdrawn and no responsibility accepted for garrison, unless he could give undertaking for evacuation of Kunfida. Sheriff’s representative would be sent if possible, but no change of policy would be expected to result. On same day “ Suva ” wired from Kunfida that garrison would not leave without Idrisi’s written order, and that reinforcements from Idrisi were said to be on the way. “ Suva ” was instructed to prevent arrival of reinforcements and informed if garrison remained obdurate they would be left to their fate. Colonel Wilson accordingly informed Sheriff that His Majesty’s Govern ment had decided that Idrisi garrison should leave, and be allowed about 20 days for necessary arrangements. Sheriff was advised by Wilson to send, representative to discuss matters with Idrisi in accordance with latter’s request. Sheriff in reply placed his interests entirely in our hands and agreed to despatch of a representative. The latter after being interviewed by Wilson will leave for Jeisan about August 13th. “ Northbrook ” now telegraphs receipt of a letter from Idrisi admitting that hostilities against Sheriff are opposed to general interests. He agrees to withdraw garrison from Kunfida provided he can save appearances with tribes, and in this connection he dwells on importance of meeting with Sheriff’s representative in order for him to be able to explain to tribes that the with- drawal is a matter of policy and not of compulsion, as tribes might otherwise go over to the enemy. He is anxious for the meeting to take place on board ship off Birk. This is being arranged and I am hopeful of amicable settle ment. While endeavouring to make things as easy as possible for Idrisi we are bound in my opinion to support Sheriff in this question.

Gadil ’ cannot J 36 located &gt; is presumably in neighbourhood of Medina where Ali and Paisal have been jointly operating. The news is encouraging, but it indicates that garrison of Medina is operating outside the town. It is very necessary for us to do all we can to encourage Arabs into a more energetic offensive. The safest and in the end cheapest and most effective measure would be to enhance effect of our recent success in Sinai further by a demonstration against the railway from Akaba. General Murray, whose latest intellio-ence shows that Akaba has been more strongly fortified than was anticipated is carefully considering this action with the Naval Authorities.

Your Lordship will notice that the first letter deals with the appointment of Colonel Wilson, sanctioned in your telegram No. 588 of the 17th instant. In the second letter I inform the Sheriff that His Majesty’s Government, as stated in your telegram No. 570 of the 12th instant, have agreed to a monthly payment of £125,000 (one hundred and twenty-five thousand pounds sterling) being made to him for 4 months. At the same time, as suggested in your telegram No. 603 of the 21st instant, his attention is drawn to the fact that, in view of this very large sum, His Majesty’s Government attach the greatest importance to his making every satisfactory arrangement possible for the pilgrimage. I also tell him of the coming despatch of Arab officers and artillery, and a battery of howitzers. I am sending a copy of this despatch and its enclosures with the Arabic version to the Viceroy of India.

E. Wilson Pasha, who as Your Highness knows has already been assisting you greatly from Port Sudan, is order that he may act on the spot as a sure and satisfactory channel of communication between Your Highness and myself. He will be instructed to make it his special duty to assist in all necessary arrangements to ensure the health and welfare of all British pilgrims. As you realize, this is a matter of paramount importance in our eyes and those of the whole Moslem world, and will, when successfully handled, redound greatly to Your Highnesses glory, especially among our Moslem subjects in India and Egypt. Wilson Pasha is of great'experience, has my full confidence, and is already known to Your Highness. I wish him to occupy the British Consulate house at Jeddah as soon as this is made ready. He will take with him a British Assistant, as well as a Moslem doctor. I have further instructed Wilson Pasha to give advice and assistance freely in all matters upon which Your Highness may wish to consult him, or in which your Governor of Jeddah may be in need of assistance or advice.

After compliments .—I have the honour to inform Your Highness that His Majesty’s Government have sanctioned the payment of one hundred and twenty-five thousand pounds sterling (£125,000) each month for a period of 4 months, beginning from this month of July, for which I have already sent to you the allowance in two instalments of £50,000 and £75,000, each. His Majesty’s Government urges me jo say that they trust that, in consideration of tTiis'Targe-'grant, -Yotrr-fiighhiis will make most satisfactory arrangements for the pilgrimage, a matter which His Majesty’s Government consider of paramount importance. WeHEave heard with great satisfaction both of Ycmr Highness’s final success at Mecca, and of the good prospects at Taif; and we hope the message sent by His Excellency the Sirdar to the Commander of the Egyptian batteries now with Your Highness will remove all difficulties and enable Your Highness to use those guns with decisive effect against the Turks. We are sending as soon as possible the Arab officers and artillerymen but it has been necessary before sending them to explain to them Your Highness’s schemes in order to make sure that they are in loyal sympathy with your cause. This is being done by Earoki and other sympathisers here, and we hope to be able to despatch them to Jeddah in a few days. They will take with them a battery of howitzers which you requested ’ and which His Majesty’s Government have placed at your disposal. We have, as you doubtless know, made all arrangements about the foodstuffs, sending indeed somewhat more than you had requested to ensure that there shall be no shortage. You will no doubt be pleased to hear that the English and French are slowly but surely pressing back the Germans on the western front; on the eastern front, striking successes have been obtained against the Austrians and everything indicates that the offensive operations of the Allies will be «crowned with success. Russia has recently advanced in the Caucasus, and their success there, with the activity of our troops in the Sinai, and the Allied ships on the Syrian coasts should more than occupy the Turkish troops, and thus assist your cause.

He is on ^ his way to the Ha]j. During the course of conversation he stated that six Germans had embraced Islam at Kabul, married Afghan girls and settled there. The Amir I has given them employment. The authorities, as well as the people of Kabul, are anxious to know how far the British Government are concerned in the Arab revolt at Mecca. One Yar Muhammad Khan, a rich merchant of Kandahar, has arrived in Bombay from Karachi and is putting up with Mirza Abdul Ghafur, Bhendi Bazar. Colonel Ghulam Rasul invited him to his bungalow on the 24th instant. In the course of conversation Yar Muhammad mentioned that he had been sent by Sardar Loinab Khan, Governor of Kandahar, to ascertain the real of state affairs at Mecca. He saw Sardar Dost Muhammad Khan, the Afghan Agent at Karachi, and learnt that the British Government was at the bottom of the Hediaz revolt.

I incidentally told him that the moment was unfavourable perhaps for such a mission. Though this indicates desire of the French Government to establish direct relations with Sheriff and perhaps have a say in Hedjaz affairs we can perhaps hardly oppose the idea. In view of French interests in northern Arabia, former is inevitable, but any step in latter direction (outside previous consular representation at Jeddah) should be discouraged I think from outside on the part of France or any other Power.

Addressed Aden; repeated Naval Commander-in-Chief and Senior Naval Officer ? Eed Sea.9 3 0 +i ^ ^sssag© from Cairo* to an Italian newspaper states that Medina has 'been occupied by the troops of the hereof of Mecca. If this report should prove correct, it will mean that the only prospect the Turks have of quelling the Arab revolt will be at the cost of a formid able campaign. It is no longer a question of throwing in reinforcements to beleaguered garrisons. Some undred miles of the Hejaz Railway have been destroyed, and in every respect the revolt shows signs of being well organised and skilfully conducted. The ohereef disposes at present of three armies, which are under the command of his three eldest sons. If the revolt continues to be managed on the lines which have secured these first successes, it will mark out the Shereef of Mecca as a likely candidate for the headship of the Arab world. Hitherto*, while the Arabs have never taken kindly to Turkish domination, their tribal rivalries and the absence of any outstanding figure among them have militated against any successful attempt to declare their independence of Turkey. The attitude of the Mbslem world to the Mecca revolt illustrates in an unmistakable way the extent to* which Turkey is held to have forfeited her position as the head of Islam. Everywhere outside Turkey the movement is being ifollowed sympathetically. It is too soon, how ever, for any discussion of possible developments arising from this aspect of the incident. There can be little doubt that the Turkish Government will at once appre ciate the seriousness of its position, for in many ways the declaration of Arab independence will affect its prestige far more seriously than would defeat at the hands of the Entente Powers. In course of time it will become known to- the Turks themselves that the policy and administrative methods of the Committee of Union and Progress are directly responsible for the revolt. Enver Pasha’s visit to the Hejaz five months ago was neither a health trip nor a triumphal procession. The danger of -the situation had probably already been re cognised in Constantinople, and the object of his mission seems to have been to- overawe the Arabs into submis sion. He is said to have found the Shereef of Mecca embarrassingly outspoken. Enver retaliated by order ing some of the prominent Arabs to be executed, and to such acts and a general anti-Arab policy may be attri buted the signal success of the revolt in its early stages. | &gt; HOUSE OF LORDS.

If the Govern ment could give any information, it would be very welcome to those interested in the East. ~ - welcome The Marquess of Crewe, in replying for the Government, said that m regard to affairs m the Arabian Peninsula, he could not add much to the information which had appeared in the Uress. His Majesty s Government had not received that informa- tion altogether with surprise. It had been their point of view all through that the Holy Places both in Arabia and Mesopo tamia must be secured under Moslem control, and as soon as it appeared that the Turkish Government, under foreign influence and something like German control, was ceasing -to represent the Moslem faith and world in the truest sense, it became obvious that a rising such as had occurred was by no means impossible. The Turkish Government had for some time past been losing its real validity as the representative of Islam, and, that being so, nobody had the right to feel surprised at what had occurred among those who regarded themselves as the true representatives of the Moslem faith. It was equally true that they could none of -them refuse their sympathy with those who were endeavour ing to throw off an alien yoke. And there was a further reason why they were sympathetically disposed towards the Arabian efforts to free themselves from Turkish domination. The pilgrim ages had been of late greatly and of necessity interfered with. Thousands of his Majesty’s subjects went annually from India and from farther East on pilgrimage to the Holy Places, and it seemed likely that what had taken place would render it far more easy to- encourage the renewal of the pilgrimages, which had been interfered with to a great extent by the necessary blockade of the Turkish ports on the Arabian coast. The Govern ment had no reason to suppose that the report of the cutting of a portion of the Hedjaz railway was untrue, but they had no further information on the subject. 18695. 1.480. 1000.—4/1915.A/toA. So ItJI™. THE PRESS ON THE NEAR EAST The Arab Revolt. The Daily Telegraph (June 23), in a leading article on tire Arab revolt, points out that it is of much greater significance now than any previous revolt against the lurk. • r[ ^ ie ^.° ham in e dans have begun to discover that Mohammed V. is so entirely m the hands of the Germans that he is deprived of all initiative, and has to carry out the commands of his Teutonic taskmasters. To be at once the “head of the faithful” and a puppe of Berlin is m the eyes of the Arabs a degrading position. In their judgment their suzerain lord has finally forfeited his rig o control Mecca and Medina and the pilgrimage of pious Mussulmans to these sacred spots. Only those who are conver sant witn. Mohammedan feeling can appreciate the sanctity which surrounds places that are identified with the life of Mohammed* or estimate at its true worth the gravity of the present revolt. The same article concludes: — It is impossible, however, not to notice that once more the Germans have made a fatal miscalculation of the psychology of the different races with which they have had to deal. Berlin was confident at the outset of the campaign that she would be able to stir the Islamic world into revolt against the British Bmpire. We know the efforts that were made on the borders of gypt and on the north-west frontiers of India. But such success as the Germans have obtained is insignificant, and the only result of their machinations has been to confront their ally, Turkey with a new and formidable danger. The Pall Mall Gazette (June 22) says: — The Arab has never made any pretence of loving the Turk, who represented to his mind the banalities without the attrac tions of civilisation and a settled life. But the present outbreak is evidently on a very different footing from the manifestations of tribal independence with which the satraps of the Hedjaz and Yemen are so familiar. It is headed by the most important indigenous dignitary of Arabia, whose personality and office alike command respect wherever the evening call to prayer turns the prostrations of the faithful towards the Kaaba. And the de livery of such a challenge by the Grand Sherif is a political symptom of no light significance. The fashion in which the Sheikh-ul-Islam rang the knell of Abdul Hamid’s power will be recalled by Moslems as they learn that Mecca is in schism from Stamboul. After paying a tribute to the work of civilisation accomplished by Moor and Saracen in the past, the article concludes: — It may well be that a fresh dawn is coming for the faith which has given many races a higher morality than their own and has contributed illustrious names to the highest rolls of chivalry. The Western world is well capable of respecting the Moslem virtues, while the more highly developed Islamic peoples have shown themselves far from insusceptible to the tolerant spirit of the modem age. To invert the adage, we may see the grass begin to grow again where the Turkish steed can no longer pass by. The Birmingham Post (June 23) concludes a lead ing article with the paragraph we quote below : — Orthodox Islam had nothing in common with the party of Enver Pasha, and the Arabs have seen quite clearly that the war alliance of Turks and Germans has meant the domination of the German. The Arabs of Mecca and Medina, and the whole of the Hejaz, do not want the Kaiser as Khalif. The holy places of Islam must remain under the control and guardianship of Moslems, and if to that end it should be necessary for the Allies to intervene, intervention there must be. The Moslem subjects of Britain, France, and Russia will assuredly look to the Allies to offer any aid the Grand Sherif may need. We have certainly no wish to*add to our responsibilities in this war; but the Arabs may find themselves obliged to meet a stronger Turco-German attempt to recover the lost cities than they now expect. The Hejaz railway gives the Turk the means of transporting large forces to the region of revolt, and though his preoccupations on other fronts must influence his decisions, the steps he will take in Arabia must be closely watched. Italy is interested in observ ing these developments almost as much as the other Allied Powers, for the happenings in Mecca cannot fail to have thnlleu the Arabs of Tripoli and its hinterland as they have moved the rest of the Moslem world. The Daily News (June 23), in a leading article, says: — _ The Arabs have at all times been restive under Ottoman domination, and nothing but respect for Turkeyasthe one con siderable independent Moslem Power reconciled them to the role of subjects of the Sultan. The discovery that Turkish independ ence is a fiction removes the last argument against the assump- tfon of political independence. ... It is not inopportune to recall the assurance of the German Wireless m respect of Enver s ■niRrimage to Medina three months ago, that Arabian population is showing the greatest attachment to the Cali^ate^ There is little doubt that the illusion of Arab loyalty to turkey seriously dominated German thought, and failure ^ ^tir up a Moslei/revolt against British rule has been among the heaviest blows to the Kaiser’s hopes. It may yet be his lot • • • ^ to see the Moslems of Arabia definitely turning to Great Britain for /protection and support. 18695. 1.480. 1000.—4/1916. ■/f 2 $ lyib. NOTES OF THE WEEK. The real answer of Islam to the appeal for a “holy war launched by the German rulers of Turkey and their free-thrnkrng satellites of the Committee of Union and Progress has been long delayed, but it has come at last. The Grand Shenf of Mecca, supported by the Arab tribes of West and Central Arabia, has pro claimed Arab independence of Turkey, has captured Mecca, Jeddah, and Taif, and is closely besieging Medina. Arab revolts against Turkish misrule are no new feature; but a movement which has for its first object the ejection of Turkish control from the Holy aces of Islam has a far wider significance than an ordinary local rebellion. There is nothing startling in the event. It has been well known for some time that the Arabs have been growing increasingly dissatisfied with Turkish rule and German domination over the Ottoman Empire. The recent visit of Enver Pasha to Medina was not undertaken from purely pious motives on the part of a devout Moslem. From the political importance that the official communication sought to attach to the tour it was evident that its object was to restore Turkish prestige in these parts. Pecent developments prove how com pletely the Minister for War failed to achieve his purpose. The Arab revolt is said to have begun about June 9. It has met with considerable success in a short time; but we must expect that the Turks will make a deter mined effort to reverse the verdict of the earlier opera tions. If they were free to turn their whole attention to Arabia, their present resources would give them a great advantage over the Arabs. It is for the Allies, therefore, to see that the Turks are not in a position to despatch large forces to the Hejaz, and the first precaution ought to be to cut the Hejaz Railway and to secure the permanent interruption of that avenue of communication. The Turks are still in considerable strength in Palestine, although recent events on their different fronts will have caused them to reduce the original army collected for the advance on Egypt. By the early occupation of Jeddah the Grand Sherif has shown that he is acting with an eye to strategical require ments, and possession of this port ought in existing circumstances to enable him to make good the supplies of war material in which he may be deficient. His future movements will be watched with close interest, as'it is one of the preoccupations of the British Govern ment that Mohammedans of the Empire should be assured of free access to the Holy Places.Meempaniiaant Uo.l attached to letter dated 20th Shaban IJJd (21et 1916) Ztvm Bul&amp;m of Shehr and lokalla* •»«&gt;&lt;»•»«» «*«»«» •«&gt;« an k: «»«» *» t re% Xe, Brigadior-Oenaral All Said Papha f Ooma»dant of the I« 1 ami© -01 to man fraopw at Laue j . ..^aiir Ohalih bln Aw ad, i'fcl **■* r *'3»X *a X , ru^, £&gt; jx^C^€^\ A.CU the rvn&amp;on for wltlhg this letter to you ie to inf ora you ifhat le neimteary for you to follow and to act in oonfe^aity therewith i.o* to nubait to Ood, to the l*ro- phot and to the Oaliidi of the Xelasi and ^oeleas suid the Amir of the i-aithfia the Great Sultan Aohawad liaehad Flian, ^hie eubssieeien is the due arrival of yours or of any one on your behalf to represent you and at the tuusa ti*ae to discharge the neceeeary duty required of you* It you listen to the eme^ne ef God, hie spue tie and hie Calliph then our mutual into rente are identically the ea&amp;ie; but if you stay aw^r .and fall to com then God, Hie apostle and Ale &lt;«aXiph are net to blame* It ie ft sufficient warning for you te re flect on what haa befallen those ^h® have declined te listen t® the sumonex* ef Ged and His tvopkmt and God made him to pr receive hie pumisiment at our hands.

We are authorised to make the following announcement: Authentic news has been received that His Highness the Grand Sheriff of Mecca, supported by all the Arab tribes of° West and Central Arabia, has proclaimed Arab independence of Turkish and Ottoman rule under whose maladministration and inaction country has so long suffered. Operations commenced about 9th June, and. have resulted in signal success of Sheriff’s forces. Mecca, Jeddah and Taif have been captured and garrisons have surrendered with the exception of two small forts at Taif which are said to be still holding out. Numbers of troops surrendered at Mecca and Taif not yet known, but at Jeddah forty-five officers, fourteen hundred men and six guns were captured. Medina, according to latest news, is closely besieged and all communica tions to the Hedjaz are in the bands of Sheriff.Jeddah being in secure possession of the Grand Sheriff now makes it pos sible to reopen communications by sea, and trade to the Hedjaz ports can now be resumed. It is, therefore, hoped that many of the difficulties which have attended annual pilgrimage to holy places during the past two years may be now removed. At the same time it must be remembered that shortage of Cr*.. shipping, apart from the question of supplies and the necessarily unsettled conditions make it still undesirable for the present that large numbers of persons should attempt to proceed on the pilgrimage.

With regard to Arab revolt, the intelligent classes of Islam received the news with equanimity, and the very conservative ones with disfavour, which was not, however, of a very marked kind. The well informed Islamic opinion was that some day Arabs would realize the opportunity of freeing themselves from Turkish misrule and recover the Khalifate, consequently the contingency was not wholly unexpected. It is hinted that Malays, who form the bulk of the Muhammadans in Singapore and have sympathy with Arabs in the matter, would give moral and material support within their power to the Government in case of active sympathy by the British, but as it would in their opinion be politically unwise on account of possible accusation that the revolt was engi neered by the British, they consider such an event as unlikely.

Conditions point to necessity of appointing an Englishman with expert Moslem advisers, but though Sheriff professes to be willing to receive British Consul in a month it is realised that the political conditions are grave. Sheriff is sending Paroki here to discuss military and political matters. Meanwhile he is credited with having said that creation of regular army of about 30,000 Hedjaz Arabs is being planned by Sheriff who wants us to send all trained Arab officers and men we hold as prisoners in order to train this army, and who relies on our furnishing all its equipment and in all probability paying for its maintenance, with a view to the invasion of Syria. He relies on us in the meanwhile to give him monthly subsidy in gold for administration to supply Arab revolutionaries now operating against Turks and also feed indigent civil population. He says that Druses have revolted in Hauran and that Nuri Shalaan with 15,000 Buwalia and Haxim Muheid of the Pedaan Anazeh is assisting them and that Imam and Idrisi have accepted Sheriff’s suzerainty. Conditions in Syria are considered such that rebellion may break out any moment but report of actual revolt is so far unconfirmed.

It is desirable that meetings of Moslem societies and mass meetings for purpose of passing resolu tions condemning Sheriff’s action and the publication of such resolutions should he stopped as far as possible. Government of India desire, therefore, that, in addition to the steps authorised in my demi-official letter, selected Government officers should tactfully approach persons who have organised such meetings and persons likely to authorise such meetings and warn them in the following sense: Bsgins. It is against a power which is at present engaged in active hostility with the British Government that the ^.rabs have revolted j it is impossible for British Government not to sympathise with those who side against its enemies. The British Government desire the safety of the Holy 1 laces as strongly as any Muhammadan can do. Hence resolutions passed condemning the Sheriff’s action have every appearance of a direct challenge to the British Government and in the handling of the situation as it develops axe calculated to embarrass the relations between that Government and its Indian Moslem subjects. The existing hostilities between Great Britain and Turkey were the work of Turkey at the instigation of Germany, and not of Great Britain. It now rests with Indian Moslem subjects to choose between conducting themselves as loyal subjects and working in effect for the ILing’s enemies. I hey will doubtless be prepared to take the consequences, if they select the latter course. The Arabs are Moslems and it is against Turkey and Germany that they are fighting. It is the desire of Government that the forbearance, caution and loyalty, hitherto displayed by Moslems, should not be interrupted now by an agitation oyer a paatter in which Indian Moslems94 have no direct concern. It is under the authority of Government that these warnings are given, and if they are neglected Government have the fullest intention of acting on them* Ends.

The High Commissioner for Egypt presents his compliments to the Viceroy of India and has the honour to forward to His Excellency herewith copy of a Memorandum by Mr. Storrs giving an account of his visit to Jeddah, where he met Sherilf Zaid, the son of the Grand Sheriff of Mecca, together with the Arabic copies of a letter addressed to him by the Grand Sheriff and a further letter addressed by the Sheriff Ali to his father. The Residency, Cairo; 10th June 1916. In accordance with His Excellency the High Commissioner’s instructions, I left Cairo at 6-15 p.m., on the 28th ultimo, accompanied by Lieutenant Commander D. H. Hogarth, R.N., V.R., and Captain K. Cornwallis, and taking with me £10,000 in gold in the charge, as far as Suez, of an escort of two non-commissioned officers. We did not reach Suez until 1, nor the “ Dufferin ” before 1-30. The Syrian interpreter, who serves the ship, failing to appear, we did not start until 10-15 next morning. On the 30th, we were not yet in wireless touch with the Sl Eo£ ” or Port Sudan, but received from H.M.S. “Hardinge” enquiries as to our destination, to which we returned a vague reply. Later we heard from that ship that the Grand Sheriff had given orders that all Turkish troops were to leave Mecca. On the 31st, we stood down west and passed the fine African range up to the Sangarib Light, 15 miles north of Port Sudan, where we met H. M. S. “ Pox ” at 12-30. My agent R. came on board at once and explained, more to our dismay than to our surprise, that we had to go north 230 miles to lias Makhluk (or Ras Arab), there to meet with Oreifan who would then hasten into Mecca returning with Abdalla in 4 or 5 days to some other point on the coast. Oreifan offered for £1 to bring us the heads of the 7 Germans murdered last week. I promised him, instead, £5 if he would procure for us ali the papers found on their persons. We left Port Sudan that evening and on the 1st, at mid-day, having steered through the formidable reef, cast anchor at Kaddima, where were one or two dhows, with canoes that paddled up to exchange fisb for Imves and rice. Oreifan did not arrive until about 3-30 with practically no Lews, save that the Turks from Mecca to Jeddah numbered not 800 but97 200. His figures are however so notoriously hopeless that we received his estimate of 10,000 Turks at Medina from Irak with little more emotion than that of the 60,000 armed friendlies which he guaranteed from his own neighbourhood. His first rendezvous for Abdalla at Sarom, close to Sameima by Jeddah, was for the following Thursday (1st June) ; an intolerable delay. Finally, by making him leave in his dhow for Rueis (4 miles north of Jeddah) at dawn next day, we came at the following time-table :— Leaving Kaddima dawn; arrive Rueis 3 p.m. and Mecca in time to see Abdalla Saturday morning: meet us Rueis Monday, the 5th evening and Abdalla at Sarom, Tuesday morning. I sent a pencil note in this sense to Abdalla (reading out the time-table to Oreifan to keep him up to time), hinting at, but not actually naming, the “ interesting ” things that awaited him, and forwarded last month’s “ Mokat- lam newspapers besides a few copies of the German anti-Islamic circular, revised edition. I also sent a wireless to the High Commissioner posting him to-date. ^ Late that night I was awakened by an officer who stationed outside my cabin door, read me a wireless from Clayton:— &lt;s Please instruct Dufierin not to leave Port Sudan until Storrs has received final instructions which will be telegraphed to Governor, Port Sudan, this afternoon.” On the morning of the 2nd, I found that Oreifan had sailed at 5 A.M., hut that owing to a faint wind his arrival at Rueis that day was unlikely. About 9 received wireless : “ Following for Storrs: Begins. Foreign Office has approved £10,000 to Abdalla and payment of £50,000 to Sheriff of Mecca. But this latter payment only in return for definite action and if a reliable rising takes place. You might explain you may be in advance in order to avoid delay in the present case, but that it necessarily takes a little time to collect a sum such as that in question. Proposal approved as regards Faroki. Clayton. JOjYKXS . We left Kaddima about 8 and steamed north past Rabegh, where were three dhows neither beached, as, according to blockade instructions, they should be, nor dismasted. J . O n t ^ e 3r( * we made Hassani Island, which lies against the reef of Um Lej town and harbour, about 11 a.m,, and, crossing the bar, took a good look at the town. There is a garrison of 20 Turks who run back into the hills whenevera cruiser comes along. This since the ' Fox ” bombarded the place a alt-mile range, destroying the fort but leaving the Mosque intact. Hassani Island is said to be the summer resort of Um Lej, but the season this year must have been a disappointment and the bookings so poor that the place contained not one single inhabitant. r Back at 7 to find an Arab, by name Hakhilallah Hamdan, on board who had seen a number of German men and women going through to Yambo in a bambuk. I proposed to the Captain taking him and his canoe to Sharm I am bo, dropping him there at night for news, and picking him up on our wav north from Sarom. * o r j tt* about 10 a.m., I received the following message from the High CommissionerIndia asks whether situation necessitates stoppage of the Hajj from India. India is unwilling to offend Moslem feeling by notifica tion ol stoppage. Please discuss this with Abdalla.” At 1 “ 30 P ‘ M ” we P ut off the Arab &gt; Hamdan, in his leaky dhow and steamed slowly past Yambo town quite close; arid but not badly built and shut m from the north by the splendid mass of Mount Radwar. Y e J ere °ff Jeddah the next day, the 5th, about 2 p.m. A fine town with 1 and even 5 storied houses and one minaret nearly as much oat of the perpendicular as the leaning tower of Pisa, Oreifan arrived from the “ Fox ” with abetter from the Grand Sheriff signed in full “ Hosayn, Emir of Noble Mecca (but save for the signature, in the handwritting of Abdalla) address- totnd^hill^r^h 16 and res P ected: 1 dee P ] y regret my inability i 11 &lt;-u Ab •!? ^ or an ur o ent reason which bearer will explain: but ^ lU /^P reseilt him with one of his cousins, Sheriff Shakir, Emir of the Ateibah of the same degree as himself” (undated); secondly, an un signed slip I lease order by wireless immediately 50Q rifles of same pattern98 as those already sent us by Rabeg for delivery at Badia. Details of consism- men from our sons Zeid and Sbabir and also 4 machine suns, both with ammunition: thirdly, a letter signed Abdalla-iba-Hosavn “ To the most, honoured and respected Mr. Storrs: I deeply regret I am unable to meet you personally, but an urgent need has called me and taken me, so mv brother will come to you with all news. My only request of you is to start operations in Syria to the best of your ability. God is our guide. Later will be our real meeting. (Undated).” Oreifan bad left Uueis on Saturday, the 3rd, at sunset, reached Mecca by camel at sunrise on Sunday morning and met Sheriff Hosayn at noon. The yrrand Sheriff had told him that it was not possible to send Abdalla who was 3 ust leaving for Taif, to besiege the Vaii now there : it having been decided that the rising was to take place on Saturday, 10th June, instead of Friday, the 16th, as originally intended. Abdalla was present: and at the conclusion of the interview retired with his father and returning gave him the above letters with instructions to deliver them at once as Zeid, under the pretext of escorting Abdalla, was already leaving the city. The meeting: place arranged was Sameina (6 miles south-west of Jeddah) (name of the reef outside Badia) for Tuesday, the 6th, at dawn. Oreifan had left Mecca by night, reaching Rueis early in the morning, Monday, the 5th. He said the movement would be initiated simultaneously at Medina by Faisal and Ali: at Mecca by the Grand Sheriff, at Taif by Abdalla, and at Jeddah by Sheriff Mohsin, Emir of the Harb tribe. : Telegraph communications between Jeddah and Mecca in hands of the Sheriff: from Medina cut. The railway was also cut. The murdered Germans above mentioned were from Java. Boyle, Senior Naval Officer of the Red Sea, came aboard from the i( Fox ” chiefly anxious to know whether he should, if responsibly requested, make a counter-demonstration at Jeddah on Saturday. I sent a wireless to the High Commissioner, posting him to date on this and other matters. On the evening of the 5th we lay outside Sameima and, leaving at 5-30 next morning at about 2 miles distance from the shore, proceeded in the gig and cutter in tow by steam-launch to the outer reef, into which our cutter soon crashed fairly hard, breaking her rudder. With me were Hogarth, Cornwallis, Oieifan, Agent R., £10,000, two sacks of “ al Haqiqa ” (the Arab propagandist journal), &amp;c., besides light refreshments for the party we expected ashore. Soon a canoe shot towards us directed by Sheikh Ali who takes consignments of onr munitions discharged from Port Sudan. He guided us through to a dhow half-full of sacks of dura, where, there being no sign of Zeid upon the beach, we tied up and sat for over an hour, whilst the mariners hauled across a sail as an awning and spread their shawls over the sacks, making us fairlv confortable. a ^ At length a bunch of 10 camels appeared on the horizon and descended to the shore where Oreifan, who had meanwhile prepared a tent of honour, awaited them. He soon came off in his canoe, announcing that Zeid wished me to land and see him alone. We had been prepared for this, but I had decided either that Zeid should send for Hogarth and Cornwallis, or better (as they preferred) to bring him and Shakir on board the “ Hufferin I set off taking ^ R. in the cutter to within about SO yards of the shore, where I stepped into Oreifan's canoe, the bottom of which was so full of water that I elected for obvious reasons to stand up in it. The last ten yards I was carried to the beach by two slaves, who contrived in that short distance to splash me well above the knee. Without looking up I saw Zeid and Shakir slowly advancing upon me. I continued to arrange my clothes so as to bring the two down in front of their guard to welcome on their threshold one who was, after all, representing the High Commissioner. This they did, and shook me warmly by the hand welcoming me in the name of the Grand Sheriff and of Abdalla. I walked with them up to the tent, giving them a variety of greetings, messages and encouragements from His Excellency, On our right, ns we entered the tent, were drawn up the guard, simply but exceedingly well dressed in Badawi costume and armed with swords and rifles. There were in the tent two small divans, each covered with two new99 and poor Sliirwan rugs, and beneath our feet two Killim carpets. Zeid sat me by himself and Shakir opposite. I told R. in English to remain standing until Zeid bade him to be seated, which in about two minutes he did, next to Shakir. The guard dispersed themselves about us on the Killims until Zeid, rather unceremoniously, ordered them to leave the tent, upon which they retired to the camel furniture, makhlufas, khurgs, &amp;c., all of which were exceedingly good, and in good condition. Zeid, the youngest son of the Sheriff by his second wife, a Turk of good famifv, is and looks' about 20 years of age. I tested him later in Turkish and found* he spoke it well and fluently. He is about 5' 5' in height, fair in complexion, with fine eyes and the round face and Greek profile characteristic of Circassians. He is evidently attempting to encourage the growth of a some what backward beard. Generally, an indoor type. I found him at first a little shv, and perhaps a trifle suspicious, for after delivering more than one cordial message from Abdulla he asked why, when Abdulla hud called foi one person, three had been sent. However, he soon put aside his timidity, asking and answer- ino* questions with equal frankness and looking me in the face. Shakir is two inches taller and perhaps 10 years older. He would also be good-looking if his face were not badly pitted by the small pox. His hair is plaited in 7 or 8 Ion®’ thin tails. I remembered seeing him with Abdalla at Abdin Palace in the . spring of 1914, and think he was pleased at not being forgotten. Both were well, freshly and effectively dressed in Kuftans of rich Egyptian silk; Zeid in. a black cloak and embroidered yellow Kufiya, Shakir in a brown camel hair cloak and small check Kufiya : both wearing sandals of Mecca and large bril liant gold aygals (cords encircling the head shawl) ; and were generally so faultless that I am convinced that they had halted and changed just before arriving, during the time the tent was being pitched. As the cutter containing Hogarth and Cornwallis was waiting outside in the sun, by now (8 a.m.) quite strong, I asked Zeid if I might have the honour * of presenting my friends, and on his objecting to their landing pro posed rather firmly that he and Shakir should accept for an hour or so the hospitality of the British Navy. He glanced once or twice at Shakir and hesitated, so I assumed his consent, thanked him and changed the subject. I had been obliged to consult my (gold) bracelet watch to see how we stood for time and on turning again to face him, found him looking at it with such interest and admiration that, as I had brought him no gift (the cash being destined for his brother) and with the object of maintaining his good humour, I drew it off, explained to him how to wind it ; set it (by a swift and probably inaccurate calculation) to Arab time, and fastened it with, I trust, a fairly good grace on to his wrist. He accepted it with faint protest and obvious rdeasure. I resolved to take them aboard so soon as the coffee, which I clearly heard being prepared behind the tent, had been drunk. Zeid then confirmed Oreifan’s report of the rising being fixed for Saturday next. He gave me a message to myself from Abdalla (which Oreifan bad also transmitted on the dhow) that I should remain on the “ Eox ” off Jeddah to observe results. I said that I must get back to Cairo, but that if, subsequently, I could be of any service and was not at the moment required in Egypt, it was possible the High Commissioner might send me again; but that I must have a definite time and place on the next occasion as I could not go steaming up and down the Red Sea another time. He agreed and said he hoped anyhow I would come as Abdalla had many things to say (that he, Zeid, was not in a position to speak about) and that it was only the advance in tue date of the rising that had prevented this. He then handed me a short note of greeting, regret and introduction from Abdalla with a long * Appendix i. and execrably written letter* from his t Appendix n. father to myself enclosing a letterf from Sheriff Ali to his father describing their plans for Medina. I asked him to tell me exactly what they proposed doing at the various centres of revolt. He said “ We will summon the Turks to surrender and shoot them if they refuse. If they surrender we will imprison them until the end of the war. We intend to destroy the Hedjaz Railway as far north as Medain Salih, which will be our advance guard. Glancing hurriedly down the list of talabs (or requests) in the first of the documents100 I2r*7s landed to me, I observed tbe mention of £50,000 with an additional £20,000, making a total of £70,000; and explained to Zeid onr position in this matter, saying that the first sum would he forthcoming so soon as we had certain news that the rising had begun and was in progress. He said 1 ~ “ — - —~ ~ —n —— •— — i o ~— I am then happy to be able to announce to you that it began yesterday ^ XTrl'k o f oniro V» a Inorl rvf v/^cjnlfo onrl Vi o'V'wvl oii^orl ‘fliQ'f V\ tt &lt;£ began ^ - ~ ^ - - O e/ *7 I asked what news he had of results and he explained that by he had meant “ was timed to begin ” or “ doubtless began ’b etn,.. etc., but that owing to the distance it was impossible to receive details so soon. I then asked whether if he had a partner whom he was (at the partner’s request) nssisting financially in a common cause, he would not after a time need a little encouragement in the nature of some practical result of his assistance, before lie continued it indefinitely. He agreed that he himself, and still more his father, most certainly would require some such encourage ment. I went on further to add that, the movement once demonstrably on foot, they would find His Majesty’s Government very far from niggardly in its dealings with its Allies. Was he not aware that we were advancing already some millions per diem to those who had declared and proved themselves our friends ? Zeid and Shakir appeared to find this reason able and said the proofs were now very near at hand. Zeid next took the question of our effecting a diversion in Syria. Assuming the revolt went off as we hoped, was it not certain that the Turks, who had 80,000 men with guns in Syria, would descend upon them and wreak a terrible vengeance ? His father felt very strongly on this point. I explained to him the existence and working of the Allies’ Supreme War Council which was bound to regard simul- taniously all theatres of war, and which would, I feared, find it exceedingly difficult to derange their carefully and elaborately matured plans. I contested his numbers in Syria and pointed out that with Irak,.Caucasus and Sinai vigorous ly beset, it was very far from certain that the Turks would have the will, or the powder, to begin upon a fourth venture. If they did and removed any troops from the Sinai, there was little doubt that this would enable us to fall upon their rear. Zeid said, if we could promise that, it would set their minds at rest. I replied that I was not a military man, nor empowered to promise anvthing at all save our definite help with money, munitions and supplies once the revolt was started: but I thought the above theory a strong probability. With regard to the extra munitions, machine and mountain guns, I would at once submit his requests by wireless and they would doubtless receive our careful consideration. But the time he gave us was very short and he must not think that these things were to be plucked like dates from palm trees. To the question as to the Indian pilgrimage he replied, that as the blockade would naturally be raised upon the successful issue of the rising, pilgrims should certainly be allowed to come. In taking note of this X informed him that his father would shortly receive a letter from His Highness the Sultan, asking for instructions as to the disposal of the Mahmal. Zeid then requested that Baroki should be sent with whatever other Syrian officers mioffit be chosen by the High Commissioner so as to be off Jeddah on Saturday, the 10th June. I said I feared the time was a little short, but would consult the Senior Naval Officer. He asked me, if I had time, to see these officers before they started. Amongst other things he enquired with deep interest whether Verdun was still resisting. Very much ^ to my relief, he made no reference to the Syrian question nor to the Khalifate, though Ah alludes most emphatically to the first in his letter to the Grand ^ Sherrff. Zerd was in process of informing me that the new flag of Arab independence would be crimson and without device when coffee was served in large cups (though in quantities hardly visible to the naked eye) by a slave admirably dressed in white and silver. As soon as decently possible after this, I rose, took his arm and told him it was time to be getting to the ship where he would honour us by breakfasting with us and receiving from me that which the High^ Com missioner had sent for Abdalla. (As a matter of fact the £10,000 was m the cutter close by, but, I trusted, under one of the seats.) ^ ea ^ in ° refreshments for the guard, we were carried with much splashing to the boat w here I presented Hogarth and Cornwallis (whom I had previously described as hi &gt;h officials with a profound knowledge of the Arabian peninsular). We reached the “ Dufferin” about 9-15 and I explained and resumed to Hogarth and Cornwallis the points already discussed.ii Cornwallis gave Zeid the correct number (as known to us) of troops in Syria as 30,000, but Zeid utterly refused to accept this figure. He also refused with unexpected firmness to accept the bill (we had brought from Cairo) for £2,000 payable at Mecca by the c^-Sheriff Ali and warned us to keep a very sharp look-out upon him. We then left them, after many friendly protests and adjurations to sit down with them, to breakfast-with Oreifan and R. and descending to the Saloon began drafting a telegram. I had them shown and explained the wireless, which appeared to fascinate them, the guns, the Captain’s bath-room and other wonders of the deep. Chairs and a carpet had meanwhile been prepared on the after-bridge where we sat going over previous points and eliciting, by questions from Hogarth and Cornwallis, further inform ation until Boyle arrived from the “ Fox ”. I asked him if he could provide any maxims and how soon he could undertake to bring the Syrian officers off Jeddah. He promised one maxim and the officers to be on the spot next Tuesday, the 13th June. On Boyle offering co-operation, Zeid rather doubtfully accepted it, provided it should have been previously requested in writing. He was against his bringing the “ Fox ’, inside the inner reef at Jeddah on Friday for fear of Turkish suspicions. We explained to him at some length the impossibility of pioducing trained gunners at a moment’s notice, as also the obvious difficulty of providing guns off ships suitable for field work. Privately we thought it just conceivable that Egypt, or (if things at Darfur were a little quieter) the Sudan, might provide some of the other weapons and possibly some gunners. Hogarth thought Aziz Ali should be good for one machine gun. At the tirgent instance of the ship’s Doctor we stood and sat for a photographic group of which I promised to send Zeid and Shakir copies; after which they wrote a couple of letters (and I acknowledged those of the Grand Sheriff and Abdalla), filled water casks for their skins and left about 12-30 by the steam- launch, Cornwallis and I escorting them as far as the dhow. Here they took leave of us with very cordial farewells, carrying with them, rather to our alarm, the £10,000 and two bundles of “ al Haqiqa”: I sending after them from the ship 1,000 cigarettes for Feisal and Ali, the only smokers in the family, at Medina. The impression left on us by Zeid was one of weakness. He is obviously the Benjamin of the family : soft in his ways and vague in his ideas. He appears, however, so far as one can judge, fairly frank and truthful and, though by no means intelligent, quite capable of understanding and conveying to or from his father any instructions or explanations with which he may be entrusted. Shakir seemed listless and ill-informed and apparently taking in more than he gave out. Although their confidence in immediate and universal success is doubtless much exaggerated and hard to justify by facts, the coneei)- tion, plan and intended execution of the rising have everv appearance of genuineness : and the terms of All’s letter to his father, the most business-like document I have ever yet seen from this part of the world, are amply con firmed by the subsequent independent testimony of Hamdan from Yambo. After they had left us, Oreifan quoted to me some remarks of Shakir. “ Do the English not see that if the Sheriff is not able to redeem his money promises to the Arabs, he will be a liar proved and lose his honour before them ? Then where will be success ? ” We at once despatched through Port Sudan a telgraphic account of the above which owing to bad atmospherics did not arrive until late the next day (7th June). I append translations of the letters of the Grand Sheriff and of his son Sheriff Aii, to his father. Ronald Stores. APPENDIX I. {Translation.) Letter from Sheriff Hosayn of Mecca, undated and unsigned, addressed to Mr. Storrs, delivered by Sheriff Zeid on 5th June 1916. 1. We deeply regret the impossibility of our sending Abdalla to meet your honour, seeing that circumstances made it necessary for him to hastenhis journey to Taif to take command of onr troops there, who are under orders to reduce the fort of Taif and to capture and abolish the Yali of the Hedjaz, his Military Commander and all the Ottoman troops and officials therein found. 2. This haste is due to the revolt in Medina which will begin on Monday, 4th Shaaban (5th June), the declaration of independence there in our name by our two sons, Ali and Eeisal, their attack on the railway, and their endeavour to annihilate the Turkish garrison and troops guarding the line. The advance of their plans was on account of a succession of Turkish reinforcements ostensibly for Yemen. In order to perform our promises made to the British Government, and depending upon her definite assurances in writing (as known to both of us), we have decided to assault the enemy (by our trust in Almighty God) on Saturday, 9th Shaaban (10th June). 3. When God shall have granted the victory and the result desired, you must at once announce it officially to His Majesty, the Government of Great Britain, and to the Allied Sovereigns, so that they may express by telegraph their approval of our Government, free and independent in all its actions both at home and abroadt 4. In order that the nations may be attracted to us and cherish good feelings towards us, it is necessary that the monthly and annual allowances should be maintained as well as the expenses of the Haram el Sheriff (Kaaba) and its servants as well as the civil and military administration : also to start a capital of £130 (? 000) monthly to be handed to us until the establish ment of the Government and the assumption of its administration. 5. As my sons at Medina request £20,000 should be speedily sent to them for their definite needs, especially political: this, after despatching the £50,000 previously requested by me, makes a total of £70,000 to be forwarded immediately. 6. When by the will of God we shall inform you officially you should send us 6 machine guns and likewise 6 mountain guns with their cartridges and teams accompanied by Sudanese (which we prefer) or by Egyptians^ that you trust under the leadership of our trusted Muhammad Sheriff el Earoki and of Syrian officers in your confidence and in his. They will, inshallah, be landed in Jeddah. 7. Send ships to mend the cable as soon as we ask you (Jeddah to Suakin). 8. The reason for our asking for Martini and Aza cartridges is because the rifles our Arabs use are largely of these two patterns^ It^ is most urgent that the quantity requested should be procured from Jibuti or Zeila as soon as possible, or, if not, 10,000 rifles of the pattern landed at Babegh for our support. This is in addition to the 5,000 already requested, whichever is the ceasiest for you. ' 9. We have previously demanded 20,000 sacks of rice, 15,000 sacks of flour, 3,000 sacks of barley, 150 sacks of sugar, 150 sacks of coffee and five thousand rifles, &amp;c., as detailed in our letter of the 14th Rabbi Awwal (19th January), to be used by our troops during operations and to be distributed among the people impoverished by the war, and now we need in addition 2,o sacks of dura and 2,500 sacks of dukhn to be sent to ports to be named later after establishment of direct communications (raising of blockade . _ 1ms apart from the annual allowances which should be sent to us as last year m the proper week, inshallah. 10. It is inevitable that upon our rising the Turks will send all forces possible, financially as well as politically, against us : so, as we are inadequa e« fv supplied we draw your attention to something that will relieve this thrust, to wit, operations either cutting their lines of retreat as previously suggested or something similar. This is exceedingly urgent: our trust is in God.103 APPENDIX II. (Translation.) Letter from Sheriff Ali at Medina to his father Sheriff Hosayn at Mecca, dated Firday, the 24th E-ajab (26th May). Gracious Master, our Lord and Lord of all. God satisfy us with Your Majesty. After kissing the dust under your feet and imploring God to prolong your life for ever, we sent you previously a letter that needs no explanation here. We have already informed our gracious Master that we were going to make the day of rising Lriday. Now we shall explain our condition and what we propose to do, by God’s will, upon whose might we depend. 1. The rising will he next Monday, 5th Shaaban (5th June). 2. Our plans are as follows :— (1) We have sent what is required to the farthest tribes, such as the Joheina and Lahab, and we shall send likewise to the farthest and nearest so that all may assemble here in one day : some to attack the railway : some to engage the soldiers at Medina. (2) Their camp generally will be in Awali. (3) The force attacking the railway will be under the command of your servant, the writer. (4) This force will proceed to the farthest point they can destroy, pulling up the rails. (5) Such advancing forces will be of infantry and cavalry only. (6) I hope that the northern tribes, such as Eilli Huweitat, Beni Ali and the remainder will take part in the movement. (7) The first district to be taken by advance forces will be Medina Salih : they will act according to circumstances either advancing or remaining on the spot. We have sent to Hosayan ibn Mibeirik to forward us the supplies and his expeditionary force with them. We have told him also to come him self, if possible, leaving someone in his place for forwarding his supplies. His presence will have a good effect upon the troops. We have left the choice in his opinion. To-morrow we shall send also to Mattar and Harb al Hurra. The force which we asked our Lord to send under the command of one of the brothers should not be delayed; and, if possible, after finishing your work, send all forces at your disposal; for Medina as far as can be judged from appearances will resist, because of the troops therein and the strength of its wall. The letter of Ibn Bifada has arrived. We opened it considering it necessary to read it. If our Lord thought fit to send him supplies by sea let him do so. After the rising we will send him a messenger with the necessary instructions. Our Lord will, we hope, not forget Alexandretta, Beirut and those regions. The party (Turk) here has suspected something, especially after the arrival of news from your direction. Supplies should be sent to Yambo in the name of Salama Muhammad Ali Abdel Kadr. We forgot to mention to our Lord the news that Barban al Ayyida (= Commander) has influenced the northern tribes up to Huweitat and the remaining tribes, by the will of God, to walk with us in the rising. This is briefly what has been decided. We demand the help of God; and we shall declare to all the tribes that the allowances, wheat and surra (money) shall be maintained and not lessened, but rather increased. If our gracious Master think fit, send us supplies to Al Wejh in our name, in the care of Ibu Bifada for convenience of transit in future when we come on Medain Salih, which should be within 15 days from this our rising (20th June).104 We implore our generous master to pray for our success and God is our helper.

Regarding progress of Arab revolt news is scanty and indefinite. Turks in fort outside Mecca have bombarded Kaaba and reported to have burned Kiswa; publication of this report has been suppressed by us, when it reaches India by post it will only exacerbate Moslem resentment both in Afghanistan and here. Lith with small garrison surrendered to Sheriff. Medina under Fakhri Pasha, Commandant, 12th Army Corps, is still holding out and position there is causing Sheriff anxiety. Turks are said to be repairing parts of Hedjaz Railway damaged by Arabs and getting trains through. Egyptian Eield Artillery Battery and Maxim Battery manned by Egyptians sent to Jeddah and Sheriff continues to receive from Egypt supplies and war-like material. Syria according to Sheriff has revolted, but this is unconfirmed. Moslem opinion here generally condemns Sheriff’s action largely on ground that sanctity of Holy Places is jeopardised and there is a good deal of undefined unrest in large Moslem centres at present with which we are dealitig on lines of definite instructions received from Secretary of State who prescribes pro- Arab policy and Arab independence to which the three Allied Governmentsare now committed. Steps are accordingly being taken to influence amenable Moslem opinion by informal talk through selected officers. No public com munique, however, is considered at present advisable. We have authorised meanwhile unrestricted trade with Jeddah, and Cairo has opened restricted 4L trade from Sudan with North Hedjaz and Jeddah ports, as Arabs are getting ^ short of food. Arab artillery personnel in prisoners of war camps in India are being sent to Cairo to be selected for service with Sheriff. Sheriff claims that both Imam and Idrisi have acknowledged his suzerainty. We will send similar reports regularly if General Officer Commanding, Force “ D ”, is not already receiving information now communicated through Arab Bureau or otherwise. 170 Telegram P., No. 381 S., dated the 8th July 1916.

Substance of information cabled by Director of Military Intelligence for propaganda is as follows :— It is stated on good authority that in schools for young men in Turkey strong anti-German feeling has been manifested. These young men during the period of training for religious duties are supported by ministerial pious endowments and the body responsible far these endowments in order to stop this anti-German movement tried to discharge teachers who headed it. Sheikh-ul-Islam strongly protested against this action. Preaching against Germans in many Mosques has been the cause of another serious dispute l)etween Germans and religious authorities in Turkey. Ecclesiastical courts have tried and acquitted several Imams accused of this preaching, whereas court-martial, which had several Imams brought before it on similar charges, being under German influence condemned them to death. This drew a protest from Sheikh-ul-Islam whereupon Turkish Government decided that courts-martial were to try all Imams accused of preaching against Germans. (Sheikh ?) Khairi Bey resigned as a result of this and Musa Khiazim Bey who is a violent supporter of the Committee of Union and Progress succeeded him. In religious circles in Turkey a most painful impression has been caused by the action of the Turkish Government in these matters. I request permission to publish above in “ Basrah Times”. Chief Political Officer is in favour of publication. With regard to paragraph 2 of your 14080—3 of June 15th, could you please ask Director of Military Intelligence to cable matter for propaganda to you, repeating here. Much time would be saved, and congestion on Basrah- Karachi cable relieved thereby. i I 2 Telegram P., No. 557, dated the 10th (received 11th) July 19 L6.

So long as above considerations are b“rne in mind Foreign Office is prepared to instruct Marling to consult you before nublishing anything connected with the Arab revolt. Cox and other officers P should now, I suggest, be instructed to publish a plain statement that British ships have not fired upon Moslem Holy Places in contradiction of Turkish falsehood. Similar falsehoods you should similarly contradict. Telegram P., No. 565, dated the 10th (received 11th) July 1916. From—The High Commissioner, Egypt, To His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla. Please refer to my telegram No. 554. The despatch of a competent British officer to Jeddah to act as medium of communication with Sheriff is almost the most pressing need of moment. He would be in immediate personal touch with the Sheriff by telephone. He could advise him on many points as our representative and discuss and focus Sheriff’s requirements. Over all matters connected with supplies and other assistance rendered by us to Sheriff he could exercise general supervision. , Edually important duty would be assistance be would render to the Governor and Municipal Council in restoring and maintaining order and sanita* tion of Jeddah which resident population of Jeddah now ask for and on which welfare of pilgrim depends. . His designation might be a colourless one, such as Pilgrimage Officer, to avoid giving colour to idea of our assumption, of control in Hedjaz. To obviate the question of return of other Foreign Consuls he should not ho stvled Consul. He might later on, however, be given a Consular Assistant. He can occupy British Consulate. If he is to fulfil his important functions ■nronerlv he must be a senior officer of great tact with knowledge and expe* rience of Arabs and Arabia, as well as of administration. These qualifications are all possessed by Colonel Wilson, Governor of Port Soudan, and if His Majesty’s Government approve of appointment of officer at Jeddah, I propose to ask for his services from Sardar.

Arab revolt. British Agent, Kabul, reports that Sheriff’s revolt is univers ally condemned and ascribed entirely to our intrigues : but Kabul believes it to have been promptly crushed. Hence no great excitement yet. Moslem press continues adverse to Sheriff. Meetings at Bareilly and Moradabad condemned Sheriff’s action. Central National Muhammadan Association, Calcutta, run chiefly by Government officials, passed resolution reserving opinion and welcoming assurance that Hedjaz would remain under independent Moslem rule and question of Khalifate be left to Moslems. General feeling is expectant and Indian Moslems not likely at present to commit themselves seriously. 10 Telegram P., No. 3228 I. G., dated the 9th (received 10th) July 1916. From—The General Officer Commanding, Force “ D”, Basrah, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. Your telegram of 30th June. Firstly, Suggested reconciliation between Bin Bashid and Bin Sand. The Chief Political Officer explained to Bin Sand at a meeting with him in January that, if he became friendly with Bin Hashid and won him over to our side, it would assist British policy. Bin Saud intended to encourage any overtures made by Bin Bashid. This, Bin Bashid was possibly expected to do. However, things shaped differently. Bin Saud was recalled south to punish the A1 Morra soon after his return to Riyadh while Bin Bashid moved up in direction of Nasiriyeh. Prom the first Bin Bashid’s attitude and intentions were doubtful, but he was treated with utmost patience and allowed to obtain necessaries from our towns, as no inclinations to be unfriendly was shown by him. This continued until he told the emissary of the Chief Political Officer that he was in the pay of the Turks, and was here by instructions and if Turks sent troops to support him he would certainly assist them in attacking us. The Aslan section of the Shammar aud^ the Bhafir, who are in our pay, were, when this frank declaration was received,.£5 persuaded to oppose him and drive him out. On 28th June near Khamsieh they met him. A squadron of our cavalry supporting them, they came in contact*with him near Khamsieh on June 28th, drove him off, killed 15 or 20 of his men and captured some 400 of his camels. Reports have been received in the meantime that Bin Saud’s brother and son are operating near Hail with considerable success against the Shammar. It is reported, on the other hand that a telegram, calling upon Bin Rashid to return to Hail and wait for support of Turks, has been received from Constantinople, by Bin Rashid. At the present time he is only a few miles from Khamsieh, hut it is expected that this summons, together with the knock he recently received, will cause him to go back to Hail. It is possible, however, though hardly probable, that he may be induced by the active hostility of Dbafir and A slam and the difficulty he now experiences in feeding himself, to make overtures to us. He has very little prestige and only a small following ; his military importance is small unless other tribes join him. Secondly, Effect of action of Sheriff. It is too early yet to gauge full effect of this as minds here move slowly. Many of the inhabitants are inclined to disbelieve it and the majority are too ill- informed to appreciate its significance ; so the news has created no particular stir I he active pro-Turkish element, the nucleus of which is formed by former Turkish employes, regret it and consider that while Turkey was in the throes of war it was unfair of the Sheriff to rebel and raise the question of Arab independence. Intelligent Shia Arabs with little less liking for us than for the Turks seem to be pleased at the news and are affected to hope for the extension of Sheriff’s declaration to Irak. The small number of enlightened Sunni Arabs pow^ here, including a few individuals with Arab nationalist tendencies, are of course delighted. The Chief Arab resident of Basrah after the Nakib, who is amongst these, when informed bv Chief Political Officer of Reuter’s communique at once exclaimed spontaneously “ What the Sheriff ought to do now is to declare himself Khalif; everyone would welcome it ”. A greater stir will, of course, he created in Persia than in Irak, over the recent happenings at Kerbela. The true significance of these occurrences is discounted by the majority of the Arab Shias here, who as a class are strongly anti-Persian. They regard them simply as a phase in the time-honouied (struggle?) between the Turkish Government and the Holy Places. The minority regard the Kerbela incidents with indignation, and make them a specific reason for welcoming and hoping for the extension to Irak, of Sheriff’s action.

From Indian point of view appointment of a soldier whatever his nominal post will enable Turks to proclaim our close relations with Sheriff and is so far undesirable. But it can only be a comparatively short time before our rela tions with Sheriff become publicly known and His Majesty’s Government would agree to appointment of Colonel Wilson if you consider that Doctoy Eichardson would (not ?) be equal to duties required. T° His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, London (repeated to Cairo). Your telegram of 12th July. As official announcement in Arab revolt would be liable to misconstruction and distortion and give food for fresh Pan- Islamic agitation, we should prefer not to make any announcement in India at present, we have Indian situation well in hand and think it better for Mbslem community to get gradually accustomed to fait accompli in Hediaz rather than be hustled into a definite attitude. In Afghanistan, moreover announcement of our sympathy with Sheriff, which would be construed as co-operation and instigation would certainly embarrass Amir.

These however do not apply to Mesopotamia where everything possible will, I hope, be done by your military and political officers to encourage Arabs to join movement which Sheriff is leading against Turks— 1. Co-operation and friendship between Sheriff and Ibn Sand might be encouraged and the most made of personal advantages which if the movement succeeds would accrue to latter. 2. An attempt might be made to win over Ibn Rashid and reconcile him with Ibn Sand. ' , 3. Efforts might he made to impress intelligent classes with idea of His Majesty’s Government’s goodwill and friendship towards Arab race as a whole and their genuine wish to promote Arab future and Arab union. 4. The general spirit of our administration and our daily acts in dealing with Arab questions and Arabs should accord with this idea. 5. We might consider possibilities of subsidising a good Arabic news paper for littoral and occupied districts. If reported to me deficiencies in the way of presses and native staff could probably be made good. I shall be glad to receive your views on these suggestions. In making them I realise that your officers should avoid pledges which might hamper our administration in Mesopotamia hereafter and should not identify themselves as regards Holy Places with purely domestic affairs of Islam.32 Telegram P., No. 432-S., dated the 20th July 19*1 6 .

Large influx of pilgrims is doubt less undesirable. In connection with Arab revolt, however, announcement that unrestricted Hajj has now been rendered possible would have Valuable political effect. To have full value announcement would have to issue as soon as possible, but season is now so far advanced that number of pilgrims would not, it is believed, exceed half normal, and if announcement were postponed to next week and included warning of possible shortage of shipping would probably not exceed 5,000 or 6,000. Could Turner Morrison cope with these numbers? Your views on proposed communique should please be telegraphed Begins. On reopening of unrestricted trade with Jeddah, Government of India lost no time in concerting arrangements for forthcoming Hajj, and are glad to be able to announce that all obstacles in the way of the pilgrimao-e to Mecca have now been removed. At Bombay as elsewhere shortage of shipping, however, is so abnormal that intending pilgrims must be prepared for possibility of considerable delay at Bombay, though every endeavour will be made to provide necessary number of ships through Turner Morrison and otherwise.

Your Highness and the noble Arab nation have been able to achieve the first decisive victory whose results, diligently pursued, should deliver you from the oppression under which you have so long suffered, and restore to you the land which was your birthright since the beginning. These achievements have filled us with pleasure and admiration, fulfilling as they do your promises and our anticipations of the Arab strength and vigour. In order to continue the assistance we have begun, we are forwarding with this letter, for your military needs, five thousand rifles with their ammunition together with— maxims with ammunition, besides—guns with crews and teams. We are obliged for these last to send Egyptian crews as there are at present no Sudanese gunners, and the training of such would take at least six weeks. The gunners we send however have been most carefully chosen, and will, we are assured, serve Your Highness with faithfulness and diligence. As, moreover, we fully understand the scarcity of provisions amongst your people, which scarcity is indeed likely to continue until the season of the pilgrimage, we are also sending you in the same vessel the following supplies:— 13,500 lbs. coffee, 270,100 „ „ 13,500 „ sugar, 227.600 „ rice, 522.600 „ flour, which inshalla will alleviate your needs. Your Highness will not fail to observe from the newspaper cutting we enclose, and from the newspapers in general, that the tidings of your victory have been published abroad. It has been stated that the pilgrimage road from Jeddah to Mecca is now open and preparations are being made in Egypt and in India to facilitate the arrival of the pilgrims. In this connec tion, the blockade which was instituted at Your Highness’ request, to suit the requirements of the situation which no longer exists, is clearly no longer necessary, and I have therefore ordered the raising of the blockade for Jeddah and for the Hijaz ports north of Jeddah, and shall be grateful if Your High ness will inform me what ports may profitably be opened to the south of Jeddah. We are awaiting with deep interest news regarding the success of your operations at Medina, and in the matter of the destruction of the railway line northwards. In them and all your other operations I wish you complete success. We on our part are considering how best to divert the attention of the enemy in other places. Copy of a letter from the High Commissioner to the Sheriff of Mecca, dated June 16th, 1916. After compliments .—I have heard with the greatest pleasure of the suc cesses which have attended Your Highness’ arms by the capture of Mecca and Taif, and feel sure that the good news of the fall of Jeddah and Medina will shortly reach me. His Majesty’s Government is anxious to do all that is possible to bring the matter to a speedy and successful conclusion, and, in order that there may he no delay in the communications between us, we have decided to o 11 ® of our officers, Captain Cornwallis, who will remain in one of His Majesty s ships off Jeddah and act as our representative in anything which Your High ness may desire. Captain Cornwallis was with Mr. Storrs when they had the honour of meeting your respected son, Sheriff Zaid, this month. Any com munication which Your Highness may desire to make to me, should be made through Captain Cornwallis for by this means time, which may be valuable, will be saved.36 Telegram R., dated the 21st (received 22nd) July 1916.

French Government’s views must be based on a brief summary sent them by their local liaison officer who I hear only got a glimpse of full text. It is fioubttul whether full text of charges to which they refer could be held to impugn French judicial or military procedure. First charge alleges that Turkish Government on pretext that their fellow- soldiers were fighting elsewhere granted dispensation from fast to soldiers in garrisons of Medina and Mecca (then at peace). The second complaint was that religious tribunals are ordered by Turkish Government to base their judgment on evidence written in court in disregard of documentary evidence written out of court. J • w ^ ards t 1 he proclamation we do not know to what extent Sheriff has ciroulated it already.He had already sent copies to Kadi of Abyssinia and I understand tn other religious leaders elsewhere when he asked my yiews on it by verbal message. J 1 n ? w gather that my views were asked in respect to form and manner of its publication throughout countries under the control of the allies. I advised him as already reported to omit reference to bombardment of Kaaba, and I have since suggested the recasting of the whole proclamation so as to avoid matters open to doubt (and ?) theological controversy which might be ill received in such countries. This will be done I think. We have no intention here of publishing the proclamation in the mean time nor will I make any proposals to this effect until I know how matters stand This I am not likely to know until I get into more direct touch with bhenff through Wilson.

Az Zaiyad and A1 Ghazzi and other friendly tribes supported the Dhafir and according to Hamud the upshot was the discomfiture of Ibn Rashid who fled back to a point in the desert 16 miles south of Khamsieh.

Possibility of influencing Indian Moslem opinion through well chosen Native officers was recently suggested by War Office. Since then Risaldar- Major Gul Mawaz Khan, 18th Cavalry, who is most favourably spoken ofby his Commanding Officer and is now on leave from Prance has been inter viewed here. According to him Arab case can be so successfully presented to mass of Indian Moslems that he is confident political agitation will be powerless. They will otherwise hear pro-Turkish side only and will naturally believe it. His suc^estion is (1) that 10 or 12 Native officers should take leave from Prance,'and go in twos and threes to Hedjaz. They would see for themselves, be received by Grand Sheriff and then go to their homes in India and talk ; (2) that proclamation to Moslem world should be published by Grand Sheriff and that it should be countersigned by Arab notables, and that deputation of Arab notables should visit India with facsimilies of proclamation, and hold meetings or be available at all events to explain Arab case to those concerned. Pirst suggestion would be purely private arrangement and commit no one and seems worth trying. I would approve of it at once if McMahon sees no objection and you agree. I am more doubtful regarding the second and should be glad of your views on it. Deputation would of course have to be well received by officials and might need protection.

Yours July 19th. The means whereby we can turn Sheriff’s action to best advantage (the importance of doing which we fully recognise) have been studied here. Difficulty is that it appears from reports of political officers at outstations that the revolt up to now has not aroused the least interest among tribes of Irak. These it must be remembered are almost entirely Shiah. The news has been received with apathy even among Sunni element on the desert side bavino- intercourse with Khamisiyeh and Zobeir. In Basrah itself there are two shades of opinion, the minority are in sympathy with revolt, while the majority seem to consider that in revolting at this juncture Sheriff has not played fair, and though they would have favoured transfer of Khalifate by the will of Islam to a member of the Qureish they are inclined to resent efforts of any individual to secure it by force of arms for himself. We consider that in face of this largely apathetic attitude on the part of Arabs any propaganda emanating from ourselves would be apt to produce an undesirable impression; on the other hand, if the text of a proclamation or exhortation which would be printed here above his seal and signature and he despatched to suitable agents both in Irak and in the desert could be secured from the Sheriff it would be likely to have effect. To this end we telegraphed to Cairo asking for the text of such a document on July 11th. As regards Bin Rashid, we have treated him with the utmost leniency and patience. He is, however, young and boorish and has proved completely in tractable. When therefore he came within 20 miles of Zobeir recently and informed Chief Political Officer that he was there by Turkish instructions and would if occasion arose join Turks in attacking us, and intimated at the same time that he considered himself entitled to access to markets of Zobeir, we were obliged to break off friendly relations and to stimulate friendly tribes to eject him. The receipt of Sheriff’s proclamation will give us a fresh opening for getting in touch with Bin Rashid, but the existing state of affairs does not promise well in this direction. As regards Bin Saud, his lieutenants, as you are aware, have recently been operating against Shammar near Hail. Chief Political Officer’s previous advice to him to become reconciled with Bin Rashid will, however, be renewed, care being taken not to arouse suspicion in Bin Sand’s mind that we recommend rapprochement because we attach any great importance to avoidance of the hostility of Bin Rashid. As regards proposals for Arabic newspapers. The Arabic edition of “ Basrah Times Si has lately been considerably improved and both of the sub editors and two or three contibutors are members of the Arab party. There would no doubt be certain advantages in an independent paper but there are a good many objections. It would need very close and expert supervision and as regards the publication of news of affairs and movements of force would be difficult to control effectively. It might, however, very easily tend to force pace unduly in direction of achievement of Arab aim. We think disadvant ages predominate on the whole but we already distribute considerable number of copies of “ Mokattam ” and “AlUmran” newspapers of Cairo and the Haqiqat ” now reaches us and has been most favourably received. There is a ready sale for it in towns and proceeds pay cost of distribution and agencies. Separate Arabic literature supplement might, we suggest, be issued by editor of “ Haqiqat ” and be distributed with it. In short: Encouragement to join anti-Turkish movement will be best given in our opinion in Irak by a proclamation from the Sheriff himself, for the circulation of which we will arrange. A reconciliation between Bin Rashid and Bin Saud will be worked for; for the present the “ Basrah Times” had better remain our only local official newspaper in Mesopotamia but we'y 19 strongly recommend an Arabic supplement to “Haqiqat”. Our present policy of support and goodwill to Arab nation will be pursued and where possible will be emphasised by judicious evidences of sympathy for Sheriff’s aspiration towards freeing Arabia from Turkish dominance and suzerainty.

According to report from British Agent, Kabul, drastic steps are being taken by Amir and bis Council to prevent dissemination of news or general discussions in Kabul regarding Arab revolt.

He is doubtless unwilling moreover to commit himself till fate of Arab revolt is definitely decided. 48 Telegram P., No. 456-S., dated the 27th July 1916. From—His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla, To His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, London. telegram of the 24th July. We have come to conclusion after very careful consideration that neither suggestion is really practicable. In any case ten or twelve Native officers would have little or no influence on Indian Moslem opinion, and they would be discredited in this particular case as Ucvernment servants, in other words as the paid mouth-piece of Government. W hile the publication of a carefully worded proclamation by the Sheriff countersigned by Arab notables is unobjectionable, arrival of Arab deputation under official aegis would be futile and even positively dangerous. The fact is that Indian Moslem opinion after its first surprised outburst of resentment is now settling down gradually to satisfactory condition of quiescence. Ibis is due partly to muzzling of pan-Islamie meetings and resolutions, partly to the hint given by selected officers to Moslem leaders regarding Government’s sympathy with the Arabs and partly to sparsity of news. For us now to indulge in any propaganda either openly or through the thin veil of Arab deputations or Indian officers would be to rouse Indian Moslem opinion from the resignation which is now coming over it and to awaken storm of resentment at Government’s wire pulling and interference in purely form 10US matterS ’ anc * tllis storm would inevitably take strong aw^’-Sheriff What would really influence public opinion in desired direction is deeds no words. If Sheriff makes good his revolt, Indian opinion (unless some- nng veiy untoward happens) may be relied upon to resign itself quietly to Xx&amp;jait accompli. Jn the meantime, the most natural and also the most20 effective agency for turning opinion in Sheriff’s favour is tlie pilgrims, pro vided they return from the Hajj without grievances. Sheriff should, we suggest, be strongly advised in this sense through Cairo, and subsidized, if necessary, for express purpose of lightening the burden of the pilgrims at the forthcoming Hajj as far as possible. 49 Telegram P., No. 458-S., dated the 27th July 1916.

On the whole it seems best to let facts speak for themselves in the communique, and not to embody your suggest ed addition. Home Government has approved of issue of communique as drafted on understanding (i) that you are satisfied that local situation warrants and (ii) that quarantine arrangements are sufficient. If buffer’s appointment is approved, may we assume that he will have reached Kamaran and placed quarantine arrangements in train there by time first pilgrim ship could arrive from Bombay ? We propose to issue communique forthwith, if this is the case. 50 Telegram P., No. 620, dated the 26th (received 27th) July 1916. From—-The British High Commissioner in Egypt, To—His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla. Sheriff is sending me a letter of which following is substance. He says German and Austrian officers are directing operations at Medina and he realises strength of Turkish resistance there. Two thousand Egytian troops to assist in the capture of Medina is asked for by him as well as further 10,000 to be held in readiness. This request cannot be met and I must tell him so. Sheriff is naturally anxious to take Medina as soon as possible in order to make his possession of Hedjaz complete, and make it possible for him to an nounce success of his movement. On the other hand, if Turks decide to send force to Medina, they would probably recapture it; problem of advance to Mecca, however, is very much more difficult. In these circumstances, for the Turks to relieve Medina would have less effect on Sheriff’s prestige than its recapture after Sheriff had taken it and advertised fact. Should the Turks not send a force to relieve Medina, its capture by Sheriff, though very desirable, is not vitally urgent. Sheriff also asks for aeroplanes despite the fact that the personnel must be British. When Wilson gets into touch with Sheriff in next few days, I will be in a better position to judge his real requirements. Sheriff’s report of German and Austrian officers at Medina does not seem probable but it may be useful for the purpose of propaganda.

Wilson is to intimate if, but only if, he proves obstinate, that His Majesty’s Government will view any collision with Idrisi with much displeasure as it must confuse our relations and cause delay in our supply of munitions of war, food and money. That it is against the Turks, not against each other or against other Arabs, that we are arming him and Idrisi. Addressed London Foreign Office; repeated Aden and Sirdar. 61 {Copy.)

On the receipt of Sheriff’s proclamation thirteen prominent Sheikhs of Kunfida and neighbourhood apparently addressed petition to the Sheriff expressing their willingness to fight on his behalf and acknowledging him as overlord. Disloyalty of Idrisi is hinted at in petition. Sheriff on receipt of this sent Sheriff Nassir with thirty men to Kunfida with orders to consult Idrisi’s representative and local Arabs who had threat ened to attack the town. If possible, he was to prevent friction and submit report. This petition Sheriff has forwarded to me to show the attitude of local Arabs and to prove that it would be breach of faith on his part to hand over tribes with whom Sheriff has definite agreements to Idrisi, Wilson endeavoured without success to induce Sheriff to recall Sheriff Nassir and to order Arabs to remain passive. Sheriff stated that the possession of Kunfida at present time was vital to his interests and that he was unable to submit the matter to arbitration although he was willing to surrender it to Idrisi at end of war. He confessed his inability to avoid collision now and urged that the presence of his representative at Kunfida was likely to do more good than harm. Importance of showing a united front to Turkey was pointed out by Wilson who represented attitude of His Majesty’s Governmant in matter detailed in my telegram of yesterday. Sheriff, however, remained firm in his uncom promising attitude and after accusing us of breach of faith in bringing Idrisi’s forces north without his consent issued a virtual ultimatum that His Majesty’s Government must choose between Idrisi and himself. This need not he taken too seriously, as his dependence on us in the matter of all supplies is so great. Wilson considers he will not break off relations in any case but that rupture at Kunfida will compromise situation seriously at a time when solidarity is of utmost importance. This should at all costs be avoided. Senior Naval Officer, Red Sea Patrol, has received urgent instructions from me that H. M.’s ships should on no account interfere between two parties.It appears essential that Idrisi’s troops should be withdrawn without delay in view of importance of making Sheriff concentrate all his efforts against Turks and of fact that he has considerable right on his side, since tribes round Kunfida have always been opposed to Idrisi and indeed fought against him in 1911. Idrisi should be told that owing to opposition of Sheriff to his presence at Kunfida His Majesty’s Government have decided to withdraw his garrison by sea in same manner as I understand it was transported there, and to leave question of rival claims to be decided at end of war. It seems imperative that I should be in a position to inform Sheriff at once in this sense and arrange withdrawal with Naval Commander-in-Chief.

One hundred and twenty-five Arab gunners and five Arab officers left Hedjaz night of August 1st with four 5 inch howitzers, two 10-pounder mountain guns and two maxims with ample ammunition. Of these 3 officers and 112 gunners were taken from detachment of artillery prisoners of war sent here from India. They were given free option and went willingly. Remain ing 2 officers and 8 men of that party (5 sick and 3 Jews) did not wish to go and were left behind. With them went fully equipped field hospital with retired Egyptian Army Native Doctor. We must see result of this experiment bofere deciding what to do with large number of Arab officers and men now prisoners in India whom Sheriff asks to be sent to Jeddah. War Office asks that 6 Arab gunners should be sent to Idrisi but this I consider veru vndesirable, apart from the fact that these Arab prisoners though willing to serve Sheriff of Mecca are not willing to serve other Arab Chiefs.

From— Sultan Abdul Karim bin Fadl bin Ali, the Abdali, To— Major W. M. P. Wood, Assistant Resident, Aden. After compliments.—We inform you that the Arabic and Turkish pro clamations received by us duly signed by the Political Resident, have been sent through two men. Some of them have been sent through the Uzebi akil Abdul Rub Rubaker, but we did not get news of its publication and announce ment (through him). The rest were sent with a special man who spread them in a wonderful way in almost all the places of the Turks. He has been able to spread them through some of the Arab servants, who are in the service of the Turks locally. These proclamations reached almost every house in Lahej, even the place in which Saeed Pasha lives and that in which prisoner Sheikh Padl Ba-Abdalla, the Akrabi of Bir Ahmed, is kept. The Turks became very much angry on the daring action of the person who spread these proclamations in this manner in almost every room of the Turks. Thereupon they (Turks) took some of the proclamations and read them in an assemblage of the Arabs publicly and explained to the people not to pay attention to their contents, as they were all lies merely to frighten the Arabs. They then started enquiring about the person who took the proclamations up to their places. They offered one of the military spies named Abdalla Al-Khulefi $200 if he can furnish them with the name of the spy who brought them (proclamations). Our man who arranged the spreading of the proclamations told us of two men who helped him and that one of them asked to be supplied with four bottles of liquor in order that he may be able to make the Turks drunk and steal away papers from the place of Saeed Pasha. We should like to know if you will allow us to do so as a trial. Moreover, we have received a letter from one of our subjects, known to us to be in the habit of visiting the house of the Turks and Saeed Pasha personally to the effect that if he receives letters and questions from us, he will be able to furnish us with true news, other than that gathered from the bazars and the villages. Should you approve of this, please let us know. We attach herewith the letter received by us for your perusal. To Sultan Abdul Karim Fadl bin Ali. After compliments .—The news is good. We feel no pain except for the misfortune which had befallen you. Should you be enquiring of our state, we outwardly feel well but inwardly we are grieved for the existence of a Jew amongst Mussulmans. God is a witness that the hearts of most of the people are sorry for your separation from them. By God, we have neither taste for food nor for any amusement. This is solely due to your absence from us. We have all this time been expecting your return to us within a short time, but no one can do anything to oppose the decree destined by God; however, we pray God to cause our meeting with you and all our brothers in Lahej shortly. Every one will, by the grace and power of God, return to his own home. As regards the news, we could not, oh father, furnish you with any news for want of a reliable person whom we can trust with our letters. You should, oh father, henceforth send a messenger to us and we will furnish you with lieseiveu uu s ^ INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY s Letter. No. ^ ^ Bated ^ 19164,8 any fresh news that reaches us; we are ready to offer our life for your sake. We are not forgetting your favours to us. God alone is aware of the secrets of our heart. As to Yemen news, please note that letters have been received by Saeed Pasha from Mahmud Nadim Pasha, the Wall of San; a and the Imam, informing him of the prolongation of his stay (in Lahej) and that he has left Yemen in order to attack (the people of) Aden and not Lahep You have illtreated the people of Lahej and stayed therein. Your object is (apparently) to lay siege to Aden, but such imagination on your part is wron°\ You have, by God, besieged no one but (those living between) Labe? and San’a. You are the cause of the siege of Yemen, the con- sumation of the treasuries of the Government and their deprivation of the interests they have been getting before the war. You have bv such action on your part ruined the people of Yemen, for which you will be punished. God knows what reply he has sent them. The news reported to have been received from Yemen is unfounded. There are nothing but fabricated stories and fruitless threats. Their (Turks) intention in so doing is to let their neighbours hear of them. These stories are beino’ concocted and fabricated at Lahej by one Abdul Rehman Mohamed Ai Omalri, and Saeed Pasha. They hold an assemblage, concoct a story and then come down (from the Pasha’s palace) and spread it saying that they have received news from Yemen. But God knows that that story is an untrue one. Their object is to cause it to reach Aden, thinking that R will, on the one hand, create fear (in the minds of the British) and that it will, on the other hand, give encouragement to their own men. They have published several rumours which have been proved to be unfounded. They ^ gave out a false story that 33,000 Turkish troops are coming down to Yemen from the Hedjaz and that they will then proceed to Lahej. This story has been invented by the Pasha, Abdul Rehman and Al Omairi. They have set up some men to spread it, so that it may reach you, but, by God, it is a false story. We have heard of this from the mouths of some of the Turkish officers. They swore that there are no more troops in Yemen other than one battalion only with the Imam which was kept for the purpose of protecting him and that the road from Hedjaz to Yemen has been closed by the Zeranik and the Idrisi. The guns brought from Yemen are, as they say, five big^ ones, but please note, four of them are as big as the gun of Mohsin bin Ali (the Haushabi) and the fifth one has a barrel like them but that it is shorter than them by about two hands in length. The ammunition brought with the said guns will not last for 2 days if fighting continues. Both this and the former ammunition (for the guns) are insignificant quantity and will not last for two days’ fighting. I have heard the Pasha tell Mohamed Al Omairi and Abdul Rehman one day that he has given orders to the gunners that when they see patrols they should not fire at them unless there is great emergency. This took place before the attack on Imad. On the day of the attack on Imad, after their return from there, Saeed Al Omairi went to the Pasha and told them that his son Mohamed and party have been surrounded and that he (Saeed Al Omairi) asked the gunners on the south of Bir Jabir to fire their guns in order to rescue them (son, &amp;c.), but that they declined to do so. They were then rescued by the gun close to Bir Jabir. The Pasha replied that he was the one who ordered them not to use their guns unless there is great emergency for it, as the ammunition is unavailable and both the sea and land are cut off. By God, they had nothing with them other than bear fruitless threats. They made it a duty to concoct false stories every now and then. If they had any troops in Yemen, they would have brought them down long ago. The Pasha sent (letters) to Ibn Nasir to send him money, but the latter replied that he has been reduced to poverty and did not recover any tithes from the people who conspired and did not give anything. That he will do so, if he sends him 300 troops with guns. The Pasha sent him some of the troops 3 . in Lahei. The number of the troops in * According to »ur estimate not more than 1,500. , ... , i . Lahej is 4,000* strong only. This news we got from the Turks. By God, some of the people of Yemen say that ifthey saw the British Government advance as far as A1 Dokaim, they will not leave one of the Turks in Yemen. All other rumours are, by God, untrue. The sea-planes created great horror in their minds. If you will continue to send some of them from time to time they will do good. Should you like to see some of their papers (gazettes) of San’a in order to heai their lies, please let us know and we will send you some.

If Idrisi is going to move against Lohaiya, Abba and Kunfida, his action will be against, Turks and in conformity with his treaty with us. In extending his limits to these places or50 others definitely in Turkish possession we can support him. But we should find difficulty in supporting him subsequently in the event of an extension of his territories at expense of Imam or other Arab Chiefs, and such action on his part can only result in Arab disunion at a time when Arab union is all important. Owing to his proximity to Aden protectorate, it is probable that after the war attitude of Imam may be important to us, and that Idrisi should complicate subsequent settlement by aggressive action at present is undesirable. Matters may already have gone too far if Hashid-wa-Bakil who apparently belong to Imam have joined Idrisi. If not, and if this can be done without estranging Idrisi, he should be reminded that the quarrel of both himself and ourselves is not with other Arab Chiefs but with Turks, and that settle ment with former must stand over till after the war when we shall afford our promised diplomatic support. We should keep Imam on the fence as long as possible, and it is desirable that Idrisi should not drive him into definite co-operation with Turks by ill-timed aggression.

Walton, Political Resident, Aden, To Saiyid Muhammad bin Ali bin Muhammad bin Ahmed bin Idris. After greetings.—I acknowledge with thanks the receipt of Tour Excellency’s letter in which you say that the Sheriff is not able to move against the common enemy because the latter has too many troops; and the Imam cannot move on account of his agreement and the profit derived therefrom. r You say that these two were formerly your friends, hut have since been friendly to your enemy the Turks. only •a ^ m St J ase ’ I must tel1 I 011 I have received information, con- sidered reliable, that Your Excellency is mistaken in thinking that the Sheriff will not rise 1 hat he is now rising and it is of great importance that you, oh my friend, should make a simultaneous attack. Yon will see that this is to your own advantage for the following reasons— (a) The enemy being attacked simultaneously in various places cannot move troops from one to the other and his position is made more difficult. . w ^ ^he present moment the attention and troops of the Turks are entirely engaged in the Caucasus and Mesopotamia, and they are unable to send reinforcements to their local forces who can, therefore, most easily be dealt with. ^ In short, if you cannot now throw off the Turkish yoke, it is time oh my friend, to lay down your arms and cease from all pretence of fighting because such an opportunity may never again occur. {c) By rising at this time you will gain the goodwill of the British Gov ernment who will certainly not forget your conduct at the present time of trial. You, oh my friend, are a friendly sea-power and our mutual interests are concerned in this matter. In the second case, if the Imam cannot move on account of his agreement it is well known that his tribesmen are not equally bound. If we make it profitable for them to join in this rising, they will hereafter be attached to your cause and will thus strengthen your position when the Turks are finally disposed of. If you will kindly communicate your financial requirements in this respect, I have no doubt that the matter can be arranged. In the third case, you will realise that friendship arises from common aims and common interests; and if the aims and interests of the Sheriff are now in harmony with yours, that the memory of bygone feuds may profitably be On all sides I hear reports that your Minister Ba Sahi is acting for his personal and pecuniary interests, rather than for the advantage of Your Excellency and your State. I do not know whether this report is true or not. But I feel sure that, if he is such as he is reported to be, he will give the same advice as he would give were he, as I hope he is, a true servant of the State, viz., he will advise at this time that a combined attack against the Turks is to your profit, since he must be well aware that his pecuniary in terests would suffer equally with that of the State but for the indulgence granted to Djezan—traffic and commerce. Moreover, it will be a satisfaction to all Arabs when the present necessity for sea blockade is removed. The Sheriff has asked for the co-operation of your forces, and I hear that you have sent him no reply. Now is the time to move. Now is the time to secure the expulsion of a harsh and tyrannical intruder who masquerades under the title of Moslem, and appeals to religious prejudices in order to obtain his worldy desires. I have reports that Your Excellency’s troops are blocking the road from Jlejaz to the Yemen, and congratulate you on this success and on your past action in opposing the Turks singlehanded. I feel confident that, by means of timely action and strong measures against those who are opposed to your interests, Your Excellency will seize the present opportunity to consolidate your State and extend your dominions.I am sending this letter by the hand of Captain Turton, E. N., and request vou will receive him with due honour and confide to him fully your views on the present situation. Should you decide to attack Lohaiya, he will arrange to assist you in the attack by fire from the ships. No. C. 542, dated Aden Residency, the 8th June 1916 (Secret). Endorsed by Political Resident, Aden. Copy forwarded, with compliments, to the Deputy Secretary to the Gov ernment of India in the Eoreign and Political Department, Simla. No. 74, dated the 8th June 1916. From—S ultan Abdul Karim bin Fadl bin Alt, the Abdali, To— Brigadier-General W. C. Walton, Political Resident, Aden. After compliments .—We forward to you, oh friend, a letter from Said Pasha to the address of Sultan Husen bin Ahmed, the Padli, which came to our hand through a friend. It appears from this letter that the three papers therein referred to by the Pasha must either he a Treaty or Agreement which he has concluded and on which he wants to obtain the signature of the Padli Sultan and the object of it might possibly be an undertaking for his (Sultan Husen bin Ahmed’s) dependence on and submission to the Ottoman Government. It is probable that the Turks are desirous of concluding such treaties with the Arab Chiefs, the friends of the British Government, whom they have taken up or shall take up to their side through the medium of their power of conquest and occupation of the country, separating Aden from the Hinterland. It is understood from this policy adopted by Said Pasha with the said Sultan that he wishes to substantiate and strengthen the sway of the Turkish Government over the country under the protection of British Government, with the belief that the Turks will permanently remain (in this country). The objective of such agreements with the Chiefs might be that they wish to annex this country to their territory, in case a settlement is made between the British # Turkg Government and Turkey before they* are driven away from the country they are now occupying, on the support of the consent of the Chiefs who signed the agreements which they secure now under the influence of the forcible power they have now against the Arabs. Oh friend, it might not he out of place to mention (although you know it) here the consequences which have befallen us by the Turkish encroachment against our country in the way of plunder and dispossession of our properties such as our reserved resources, the valuable furniture of our houses, the numerous lands belonging to us and those of our subjects who are still sticking to us. The Turks and others have been enjoying them and receive their products ever since they occupied Lahej and its dependencies. If this project and desire of the Turks of taking the Arabs whom they have secured under them is consummated, the result will seriously affect us and we shall be under their mercy, as they will be able to divert the caravan route whenever they want from our country and make the kafilas to travel in the Haushabi territory and thence to the Padli country. We shall consequently lose our transit dues in addition to the losses w r e have suffered already. Oh friend, we request you to attentively consider our case and protect our rights which are likely to he affected at present and future. Kindly inform and explain to Government what we have suffered so that they will keep us in their mind in case a settlement is concluded between Turkey and them before they are ousted from Lahej. We have strong hope in the success of the British Government, and we pray the Almighty to perpetuate their rule and give them victory against their foes.— Greetings.No. C. 551; dated Aden Kesidency, tlie 13th June 1910.

From— Said Pasha, Commandant of the Turkish Forces at Lahej, To— Sultan Rusen bin Ahmed, the Fadli, the Ottomani. After compliments .—We have received your esteemed letter and noted its contents. With reference to the agreement, perhaps you have failed to understand our purpose. We mentioned that of the three copies which you had taken along with you, one copy was for you and was to remain in your hands, and that the other two copies should be signed, sealed and returned to us. Surely you could not have understood the meaning. We want to send the two copies to Constantinople. Finally, please send us two copies and keep one hearing signature with you. Please note. As to other news, please God, they are good. You should not think that we have sent the three copies of the agreement to be kept by you. Send the (two) copies at once, as we want to forward them to Constantinople. We will discuss matters hereafter. May you, &amp;c. Full particulars are with your son, the hearer of this letter. p # —With reference to Ahl Ad-Derjaj who came from the other place and you had allowed them to live at Ad-Derjaj which belongs to you and not to them. If you have authentic documents proving the place to be in your limit, well and good, we shall confirm it in your favour. If not, Abyan and Shukra are enough for you. As regards the Nazi’a, we have impressed on them, have no anxiety. Everyone will come in the right course and have justice. Moreover, Government (Turkish) desire to acquire some Nalas in the fields of Ahl Haidara Mansur duly defined as lands belonging to the Sublime Turkish Government. The Nalas shall bear the name of Said Pasha. The Nalas will be property of the Government. You should raise no objection to this. The Nalas of Said Pasha will begin from below An-Nazi’a at Ba Khraba* * a name of land. and Ubar (Nalas) of Abdul-Samad. We came to know that the Ahl Foolaisi take Jawli (reeds) and flags to Aden. They also take grass; surely they are not taking these through the sky but through the earth. We want you to enquire into this matter, and stop the Ahl Foolais. You are making excuses on their behalf. It is easy for us to deal with them had it not been for you who state that they are so and so. Now think of their actions. Every time we hear of such things, we keep patience, but you are regardless. Enquire into these facts of Ahl Fooiaisi and do not be unmindful about them and others. W'e have not as yet seen any of the letters which you received from Aden to consider what is good. Note that you should send them along with the getters sent to you by the Abdalis.

It is to be hoped that your action will be of the greatest assistance to our common friend the Sheriff who has tbe most difficult task. We feel sure that he will be grateful to Your Excellency for any determined action you may take. For this reason the decision to attack in the first place Ibha, Hali and Kunfidah appears commendable, and we trust that your efforts there may be crowned with success. When you have disposed of the garrisons of those places, the remainder of the Army of the Yemen will be cut off by land from the North and from the South and also, perhaps, from the East, wffiilst it is already cut off from hope of assistance by sea. Your Excellency will no doubt consider the ad vantages of looking for compensation for your risks and exertions in this war from the South rather than from the North side of your present dominion. We are sending 1,000 Le Gras Eifles and 700,000 rounds Le Gras ammu nition, also 330 cases Wetterli ammunition which latter has just arrived and trust that the gun ammunition will shortly arrive. May you be preserved and granted success in your just undertakings.

S. “ Northbrook 12th June 1916. I have the honour to report that, in compliance with your request, I left Aden at 8 p.m. on Thursday, 8th June, for Gizan conveying a letter to the Idrisi which I undertook to deliver in person and obtain a definite reply to. The contents of the letter were made known to me by you before leaving. I arrived at Kamaran at 6 p.m., 9th June, and there had a long private interview with Saiyid Mustafa, who had been disembarked at Kamaran on his way to Aden for a conference, owing to sickness. I did not explain to him the contents of your letter but merely touched on general points of Idrisi policy. Mustafa impressed upon me the undoubted fact that the Idrisi were the enemies of the Turks and in the course of his conversation, although he in no way committed himself to any policy, he inferred that it was his desire to accompany me on my mission to the Idrisi, and might be of assistance. I left Kamaran at 5 p.m., 10th June, and arrived at Gizan at 7 p.m., and landed Mustafa, who assured me that he would arrange an early interview for me with the Idrisi. At 11 p m., I received a message that the Idrisi would see me that night or the next night, and on receipt of this message I immediately landed accom panied by Captain B. B. Beilly and Lieutenant L. F. Nalder, B. N. V. B. I do not propose in this letter to go through the procedure of the long and wearisome discussion which followed, and which lasted until nearly 4 a.m., but merely to state a few facts. The Idrisi’s attitude was friendly and polite, but he held throughout to the point that he had never received any letter or intimation from the Sheriff to combine in a general Arab rising against the Turks. He produced a letter which he stated was the only one which he had received from the Slieriff, which was read. This merely dealt with a matter affecting the release of certain Arab prisoners. The general trend of the conversation for the first two hours dealt almost entirely with the following two points :— (1) The fact of his undoubted enmity to the Turks coupled with a statement that he had been fighting them throughout the war. (2) His disbelief in the intention of the Sheriff to rise against the Turks. At this point I felt bound to cut short the discussion by requesting him to give me “ a definite answer ” one way or the other as to his intentions. I informed him that I had no doubt that he had been taking a “ Defensive Policy ” against the Turk during the war, but pointed out the • fact that there was a wide difference between a “ Defensive Policy ” and a “ General Offensive Policy I went on to impress on him the undoubted fact of the Jeddah rising and the advantage to be gained by the immediate active policy on his part. I ended my statement by telling him that unless he could give me a definite reply forthwith as to the lines he intended to follow, I should be forced to leave the port within three hours. This had the desired effect and the Idrisi stated that he would give a verbal guarantee, that he would take immediate steps to mobilize bis army for an offensive action against the Turks, and further stated that he would send me a written corroboration of this policy as a reply to your letter. I thanked him for his prompt verbal answer, but requested that his reply to you should be in the form of an open letter, the terms of which he should allow me to read, as I had no intention of leaving Gizan with a reply that was not in every way satisfactory.To this he agreed. On receiving the above assurances I then informed the Idrisi that I would, on my return to the ship, send a wireless telegram to “ Fox ” who was at Jeddah, requesting absolute facts as regards the riding in the Hejaz, and would forward to him as early as possible the reply. I was fortunate enough to receive, shortly after my return on board, telegram from you together with an intercepted telegram from ' Fox ” and • Telegram, attached. Commander-in-Chief,* which confirmed the offensive action taken by the Sheriff and I sent such portions of these telegrams ashore by a special messenger to the Idrisi, as bore on the subject. By the same messenger who took the telegrams I informed the Idrisi that I should land at 6 p.m. on that day (11th June), and requested him to hand me the written reply confirming his policy. I landed at 6 p.m. with Captain Eeilly and Lieutenant Nalder, and the Idrisi again personally interviewed us at 7 p.m. Two hours of conversation ensued and eventually I was able to obtain and read the contents of his letter. He had evidently been favourably impressed by the telegrams which had been forwarded to him, and the contents of his letter appeared to me to give him no loophole of escape from the policy which he has stated definitely he intends to take up. The Idrisi was unwilling to sign the letter in my presence and give it personally to me, but on my representing the fact that I had the honour of being allowed to act as an ambassador to you and had personally received, and personally delivered your letter to him, I requested that a similar honour mio-ht he done me by him. The letter was then duly sealed and delivered to me personally in the presence of Captain Beilly and Lieutenant Nalder. During both interviews the following officials were in attendance only Saiyid Mustafa. Saiyid Mohammed Ba Sahi. Saiyid Yehia Shekeri. I will not dwell on the question of arms and ammunition which subject he constantly used as an argument in defence of his previous policy, but I assured him that the British Government are doing all in their power to obtain his requirements as soon as possible, and at the same time pointed out that owing to the great European war certain delays in delivery were bound to arise. No obligation on behalf of the British Government politically, naval or military, was undertaken in obtaining the final reply from the Idrisi, with the exception of my personal promise to endeavour to expedite the supply of arms and ammunition which he had already been promised. J Finally, if my opinion is of any value, I should like to state that I bad no doubt whatever as to the loyalty of the Idrisi towards the British Govern- meat, dot have any doubts as regards his intended immediate offensive against the Turks, hut I feel hound to point out that I consider his operations should he carefully watched, as, should this Arab rising successfully break the Turkish yoke in Arabia, I believe that the Idrisi intends to eventually take an offensive action against the Sheriff, should a favourable opportunity occur. In conclusion, I wish to bring before your notice the invaluable services rendered by Captain Reilly and Lieutenant Nalder without whose assistance I should have been unable to achieve the object for which I visited Gizan. Captain Reilly was most useful to me on giving me politically advice, as also was Lieutenant balder, and latter officer’s brilliant knowledge of Arabic was of the greatest assistance. ° I wish also to mention tbe efficient services rendered by Interpreter Ali Ibrahim who acted throughout in a diplomatic and discreet manner and whose services are worthy ol recognition^? e ?° r ^ S - 0 ^ ^ a P^ a i n Reilly and Lieutenant L. F. Nalder are attached winch will bear on the political situation with which I have not personally dealt with in my letter, and should be of great value in deter mining the present trend of the Idrisi politics.

To Saiyid Muhammad bin Ali bin Muhammad bin Ahmed bin Idrisi. „ . 4/^ greetings.—It is with great pleasure that I am now in a position to mlorm Your Excellency that I have received the following telegrams : (1) “ Ships have been shelling Turkish positions at Jeddah at the request of the Arabs.” From H. M. S. “Fox” Senior Naval Officer, Red Sea Patrol, at Jeddah. (2) “ In reply to your message, seven hundred and fifty thousand rounds of Le Gras small arms ammunition being sent to Kamaran by ‘ Suva \ No other arms or ammunition at present in hand, but two thousand rifles and gun ammunition ordered and should be out before long.” From Resident, Aden. (3) “ Sheriff has occupied Hejaz Railway from Medina to Medain Salih, and the Harb and several other tribes have joined the Sheriff in his revolt against the Turks. Sheriff reports he has received no answer to his letter to the Idrisi.” To “ Northbrook ” . from Resident, Aden. I feel sure that Your Excellency will see by the above telegrams, firstlv, ihat^ the definite intentions of the Sheriff are obvious. Secondly, that the British Government are doing their best to assist you with arms and ammuni tion. I am still expecting further news from Jeddah, but at present I think the information contained in these telegrams should be sufficient to enable you to gi7e me a letter which will state definitely your policy. I will do myself the honour to land on your shores at 6 p.m. to-night in the hope of receiving your communication and feel assured of the success of my mission which should result in the breaking for ever of the Turkish yoke in Arabia, and finally, a lasting peace and prosperity to you and your country. Lancelot N. Tueton, Commander-in- Command, The attached remarks by Ali Ibrahim, Interpreter, may be of interest, and are attached as an addenda to my report. H. M. S. “ Northbrook ) Lancelot N. Turton, Xdth June 1916, j Commander-in-Command,8 H. M. S. “ Northbrook 12th June 1916. On the Island of Kamaran the Commander of H. M. S. “ Northbrook ’* said to Saiyid Mustafa that he hoped Saiyid Mustafa would be of some help to him in his*mission to the Idrisi, but later on it was proved to the Commander that Saiyid Mustafa could not influence the Idrisi Saiyid to meet his wishes and that it was the Commander himself who could make the Idrisi Saiyid engage to carry out offensive operations against the Turks. The Idrisi Saiyid has, since the conclusion of the treaty with the British Government r shuffled to give his word to fight the Turks, who are no doubt his deadly enemies, but this failure was due to the fact that he was always spoken to in mild and soft words, whereas an English proverb says “ Soft words butter no parsnips ”. Saiyid Mustafa could do nothing to influence the Idrisi in his pledge to go against the Turks. It is admittedly a known fact that the Idrisi has, since entering into friendly relations with the British Government, objected to allow British officers to land during day time on the pretext that his tribesmen, or rather the Turkish Arabs, might misinterpret such landing, but such an objection on his part was merely imaginary. Erom my experience during two short visits to Gizan, I think that all the Arabs within the borders of the Idrisi are quite amenable to his law and are quite agreeable to espouse his cause at any time. They already know that the Idrisi has entered into treaty-relations with the British Government for the purpose of fighting the Turks who are considered by such fanatical Arabs as black sheep. These Arabs have already felt the “ Mailed fist ” of the Turks and they call them “ Kafirs ”. I heard personally yesterday some Arabs yelling out some sort of Arabic doggerels in a dance and in this doggerel they said “ 0 Saiyid Muhammad bin Ali we are ready to fight the Kafirs (they meant the Turks) at any time you are pleased and we await your orders ”. If the attitude of the Arabs has gone so far as to [Letter not completed). H. M. S. “Northbrook 12th June 1916. Sir, I have the honour to report that, on Thursday the 8th instant, I received orders from the First Assistant Besident, Aden, to accompany you in H. M. S.. “ Northbrook ” to Gizan. It was explained to me that the object of your voyage was to induce the Idrisi to adopt an immediate and energetic offensive against the Turks, which should coincide with and assist the Sheriff’s rising against them. This rising, I was told, was on the point of occurring : Medina bad in fact already risen, and Mecca and Jeddah were expected to do so on the- 10th instant. The Idrisi had for some months been inactive^though nominally at war with the Turks, and it was important that he should be persuaded to join in what was hoped to be a general Arab rising against Turkish authority. My orders were that this political mission had been entrusted to you, and that I was to give you any assistance in my power. H. M. S. “Northbrookleft Aden at 8 p. m. on the 8th instant and reached Kamaran on the following evening. Here, after an interview between yourself and Saiyid Mustafa al Idrisi, it was arranged that the latter should pioceed in the ‘ Nothbrook ” to Gizan. I was not present at this interview,, but on the following day you introduced me to Saiyid Mustafa whose refined and cultivated manner and personal charm struck me as remarkable. His health was bad but he said it was improving and he remarked on the attention and care he had received at Kamaran. We reached Gizan on the evening of the 10th instant, and that night the first interview between yourself and the Idrisi took place in the house of the Sheikh of Gizan, which is on the shore. The persons present at it were, on theone side, yourself, Lieutenant Nalder, H. N. V. U., and myself, and on the other, the Idrisi, Saiyid Mustafa, Sheikh Yahia Zakari, Minister for Home Affairs, and Muhammad Yahia Ba Sahi, the Prime Minister. Tiie Idrisi struck me as a man of strong character and considerable in telligence. He conducted both interviews single-handed and seemed never to be at a loss for an argument or an answer. Except for one or two references to Saiyid Mustafa, be consulted no one during the interviews, and his reply to the Resident’s letter was, I think, chiefly bis own composition. I doubt whether he is very much influenced by either Saiyid Mustafa or Muhammad Yehia Ba Sabi. The latter is, I understand, untrustworthy. The interview lasted three hours, and was not at all smooth sailing. The Idrisi was evidently disinclined to take the vigorous action to which he wa» urged. He gave a number of reasons against doing so, such as his objection to becoming involved in an attack on the Imam, whom Government had told him not to molest, and a plea that he was already doing as much as could reasonably be expected of him. But the outstanding arguments that he used were (1) his scepticism as to the Sherilf’s rising, and (2) his want of arms and ammunition. As to the first, it appeared to me that his doubts as to the reality of the Sheriff’s defection from the Turks were perfectly genuine, and your offer to obtain news from Jeddah by wireless had considerable influence on his attitude. He cannot, I think, have been ignorant of the possibility of the Sheriff declaring against the Turks, but he was evidently unwilling to move until he was convinced that the Sheriff had actually done so. He denied having received any letter from the Sheriff asking for his co-operation. As to his demands for arms and ammunition, his requirements will no doubt be met adequately now that he has undertaken an active offensive. The turning point in the interview was your statement that you would leave Gizan in the morning if he did not give a definite reply. It was on this that he declared he was willing to take the offensive as soon as he was con vinced of the Sheriff’s action. Between the first interview and the second, which took place on the 11th instant at 7 p. m., he decided to take the offensive as desired; and in this he was obviously influenced by the telegrams received from H. M. S. “Pox”, and from Aden of events at Jeddah and on the Medina Railway, copies of which telegrams you forwarded to him during the afternoon. He has declared his intention of taking the offensive in the north against Kunfida, Hali and Mahail. This he explained as being the best method of getting into touch with the Sheriff and assisting him. He may be influenced also by two other motives: (1) to attack the Turks at the places where they are in least strength on his borders, (2) to anticipate the Sheriff in any possible action in this district. But whatever ulterior motive he may have, the object of your mission has been achieved, for there is no doubt of his intention to take vigorous and immediate action against the Turks. His future operations will no doubt be watched, and the possibility of a collision of interests between himself and the Sheriff guarded against. The Idrisi refused the money present which was offered to him. This, in conjunction with his objection to receiving Europeans in daylight, is interesting, and shows, I think, that he does not wish to appear to be in close relations with Christians or under obligations to them. On the other hand, it is noteworthy that on your second visit you landed at 6 p.m. in daylight, and although you were not then received by the Idrisi himself, the attitude of the people was friendly and polite. The Idrisi’s susceptibilities are perhaps rather on account of some of his less sophisticated tribesmen in the interior. I have, &amp;c., B. R. Reilly, Captain, To The Commander L. N. Turton, R.N., H. M. S. “ Northbrook ”.10 Sir, H. M. S. “Northbrook”; 12th June 1916. I have the honour to submit the following report on your two interviews with the Saiyid Idrisi at Gizan on the nights of the 10th and 11th June. I do not propose to enter into the details of the conversations, but merely to record some of the impressions I received. As to the personalities of the people presentThe Idrisi was attended on both occasions by his cousin and adviser, the Saiyid Mustafa, by the “ Prime Minister ” Mohamed Basahi, and by the “ Minister of Interior ” fehia Shakeri. The Idrisi appeared a man of vigorous personality and ready tongue. He carried on the conversations without reference to his Ministers, except for an occasional reference to Saiyid Mustafa; he had an immediate answer to any question or objection and gave the impression of complete independence from his advisers. Basahi appeared a man of the voluble and plausible type and did not create a very favourable impression. I had no opportunity of conversing Tvith Yehia Shakeri except a few conventional remarks and he took no part in the conversations. r Vvith regard to the first interview, which lasted from about twelve mid night till 4 a.m., during the first two hours the Idrisi was obviously strivin 0 ' to avoid the issue and gain time, sheltering himself behind repeated iterations &amp; (1) that he was fighting the Turks now and had been doing so singlehanded for the past eight years, (2) that he was severely handicapped for want of ammunition He also talks at great length as to the probable attitude of the Imam Yehia*, even asking if the British Government would guarantee his neutrality. He was finally brought to an issue by a very firm reiteration of the fact (1) a - Very !° n? P prl0(i he had been acting on the defensive only, (2) the bhenft s rising had given him the opportunity of his life, (3) he had been given considerable supplies of ammunition, and that if held back now, future supplies would avail him nothing. He then opened up what appeared to me the (for him) crucial question of the evening,-the bona fides of the Sheriff and the actuality of his revolt He asserted that he had every reason to believe that the Shenff was in league with the lurks against the British Government and himself: and asked for further proofs that the rising had actually occurred. He appeared satisfied by vour promise to furnish him with any further wireless messages received^ from box and expressed great satisfaction on hearing from you that the Sheriff’s preparation had been made with the knowledge and assistance of the British Government. That appeared to me to be the point which determined him to declare himself for an immediate offensive. I confess that I was agreeably surprised by his appearance at the second interview, from the absence of any preparations for our reception, I expected that we should see only some of the Ministers or even that he mUt have changed his mind However, when he appeared ills manner was markedly cordial and whole tone of the proceedings was a great deal smoother than it had been on the previous night, and the letter was signed without any argument or principle. b ^ During the first interview he stated that Nasir Mabkhut, the paramount Chief of the Hashed, was now at Gizan, ^ &lt;*muunc There are only two other points which I would wish to make. The first is the question of communication between him and the Sheriff, He repeatedly asserted that he had received no letter from the Sheriff other than that shown us, a few lines relating to the release of certain Arab prisoners held by the Idrisi, But the messenger, Hamed Areifan, who brought the letter was at Gizan, and when I saw him said that he had brought a letter from t e Sheriff which had been seen and handed to him by the Sudan STdid not m pi“ ^ SUS1,eCt S0 “ e ° tllei ' IeUei ' had ^ *4 fO0](”. ) . 6 , llteiT Wj , Je. ) ^ Merely ^ded on 1 1 Shaken gne.

To this no objec- tion can be made, but it might he necessary in the future to warn the Idrisi that the value of his offensive might be lessened if it were carried in directions which the Sheriff might regard with suspicion. I have, &amp;c., L. F. Nalder, Lieut., U. N. V. B,., Folitical Officer, Bed Sea BatroL To Commander L. N. Turton, R. N., H. M. S. “ Northbrook Praise be to Allah. To His Excellency General William Walton, Resident of Aden, &amp;c. After salutations, fyc.—l have received your honoured letter, dated the 9th Shaabau 1334. With regard to what you say of the Sheriff of Mecca, we maintained formerly that he would not move seeing that he was one of the chief Emirs of the Turks and fought with them on many occasions. If he has now returned from the friendship of the Turks to enmity with them, this is a recent occurrence, and we welcome it as good news, of great import, and rejoice at it and are ready to make our agreement with him and assist him both by attack and in other ways. Beyond doubt this is a great advantage to US. But up till the present no information of this has reached us by land or from our frontier which marches with his. But we have received a letter from the Commander of your warship “ Northbrook ”, conveying to me the telegrams which have reached him from Aden and from the Commander of the Warships which patrol the Red Sea. Erom there yfe learn that the Sheriff has occupied the railway between Medina the Holy and Medain Salih, and that your ships have bombarded the Turkish positions in Jeddah. We rejoice greatly at this news and have begun arrangements for offensive action if God wills. Our troops which were engaged on the Northern frontier (of) with the Turks will advance shortly by the might of Allah against their positions in front of us to prevent them aiding their brothers in the Jhledjaz. You are aware how we have resisted the Turks when we were single-handed. Now then will it be when another is joined with us. It is unlikely, from reasons of faith and intelligence that we shall delay. You know that we are engaged with the Turks, north, south and east. This is no small matter and requires very large supplies of ammunition. We have about 30,000 Italian rifles and they form tiie chief equipment of our adherents. Eor these we have no ammunition, and we have nothing more important to urge on the Government than the facilitation of supplies of ammunition and also ammunition for the guns and all necessities for firearms. With reference to your remarks on the tribes which follow the Imam, it is true that they have no obligations to fidelity to the lurks and are concerned with their advantage and livelihood. It is possible for me to request their presence here, and indeed last year they made allegiance to me, they and many of the tribes, because they see that the Turks oppressed them in the past and have now begun to introduce Germans, people of another place and another race, whose good behaviour they doubt, into their country. Therefore they believe in the Aden Government, having proved the goodness of its dealings with the people. Therefore their hearts were won over and they came to us with this purpose. We acquainted the Government of this, but received no direct reply, and as we do not like evasion we put them off until another time.12 With regard to what yon say that the Sheriff has asked for our help and that we have not replied to him, we have no news of this except from your letter. It is true that the Sheriff wrote us a letter, that it referred to certain prisoners of war held by us, whose release he wished. This letter we have shown to your representative. It would be more satisfactory if letters (from f the Sheriff to me) -were sent through you. With regard to the preparations for an attack on Lohaiya, by the will of Allah, it will be soon be easy. At the moment we are hurrying on prepa rations for the Northern attack to make good the communications between ourselves and the Sheriff, so that should a force come from the North we mav reinforce the Sheriff. Also for the administration of the Northern districts, • for this reason that after this happy movement of the Sheriff, we must collect our tribes under our control and inform them of the good news of the presence of the opportunity and take from them sure guarantees for faithfully prosecut ing an attack. I am certain that they will welcome the news and will move even more vigorously than usual,—and they have spent eight years in fighting the Turks and the Arabs who favoured them in the four points of the compass. Now, if Allah wills, has dawned the day of rejoicing. We will inform you of their (Turkish) state and of all that depends therefrom. We have implicit trust in our cousin Saiyid Mustafa el Idrisi. With regard to our friend Sheikh Mohammed Basahi, We are convinced that his sole desire is the extermination of the Turks in any way possible. Owing to the wealth they took from him in the days when they controlled the Bed Sea, he has no desire for their preservation, and if we believed that he did (so desire) we should not have aided him in any direction.

I inferred that Saiyid Mustapha was not prepared to express an opinion without previous reference to, and consultation with, the Saiyid Idrisi. He, however, admitted that the chiefs of the Hashid and Bakeel tribes were in regular correspondence with the Idrisi who is on particularly good terms with Nasir Mabkoth, the principal Sheikh of the Hashid clans. Mustapha has good reason to suppose that the Hashid and Bakeel tribes men who constitute the backbone of the Imam’s influence and power are seething with discontent which he attributes, and rightly so, to the parsimo nious treatment meted out to them by the Imam Yahya ever since his entente with the Turks. While there are as yet no actual indications of open rebellion or of an attempt to challenge the Imam’s authority on the part of these turbulent and truculent mountaineers, Mustapha considers that their defection from that notable’s cause can easily be secured and that it is only a matter of money, arms and provisions. He stated that he was not in a position to form an estimate of the price at which these two tribes could be purchased nor would he commit himself to the expression of a definite opinion as to whether Saiyid Idrisi w r as desirous of cur assistance in obtaining their co-operation. He recalled the fact that this point was raised at an interview he had with the authorities at Aden in March last, but pleads firstly Idrisi’s illness followed by his own as an excuse for not touching on it in the course of various conversations with his chief. I might add that the disaffection prevailing amongst the Hashid and Bakeel clans alluded to by Saiyid Mustapha has been known by me to exist during the past three years and that Nasir Mabkoth has practically been a free-lance since 1911. A potent factor conducive to the fomenting of dissensions in the Imam. Yahya’s camp on which Mustapha did not fail to comment, is the presence therein of a certain Muhammad Abdul Kassim, the Imam’s kinsman, who himself aspires to the Imamate. Questions 2 and 4*. On enquiring whether he could make any sugges tions as to further assistance we might give Saiyid Idrisi with a view to inducing him to push an attack on the Turks simultaneously with the Sheriff’s advance, Saiyid Mustapha expressed himself unable to give a reply without first communication with the Saiyid at Geezan. He, however, was not reluctant to point out that the Idrisi’s apparent inactivity since the month of Ramadan (end of August 1915) was solely due to his shortage of arms and more especially of ammunition. In this connection, he was of opinion that our Government had not afforded Saiyid Idrisi the assistance expected to make good the shortage. He mentioned that about 800 rifles and 1^ million rounds of ammunition had been supplied by the authorities in Aden and that some 3,000 rifles and a large quantity of ammunition had been purchased in Djibouti, but not without some difficulty. This, he argued, was far from sufficient for the execution of the task set Saiyid Idrisi. The same, he added, might be said about cannon and shells, at the same time emphasizing the fact that the three best heavy guns possessed by the Saiyid w^ere given to him by the Italians during the Turco-Itaiian War in 1911-1912. Saiyid Mustapha did not deny that the present time was most opportune for a move against the Turks.He led me to believe that the most cordial relations existed between the Saiyid Idrisi and the Sheriff of Mecca and that their respective political interests and spheres did not clash at any point. It would be as well to report that Mustapha manoeuvred to evade the point at issue as far as possible. In endeavouring to obscure Idrisi’s inaction, he expressed surprise and disappointment at British inactivity on the Lahej front and hinted that a decision obtained in that quarter would be likely to have far-reaching effects at the Idrisi’s end. In short, the discussion with Mustapha impressed on my mind the idea that Saiyid Idrisi was not prepared or willing to bestir himself unless we brought greater pressure to bear on him. I informed Saiyid Mastapha that we were in possession of reliable intelligence to the effect that all Turkish reinforcements had been diverted to the Caucasus and to Mesopotamia. He replied that Saiyid Idrisi had received reports which had been confirmed by persons arriving from the Hedjaz pointing to a strong concentration of Turkish troops at Medina; also, that a rupture had taken place in the Sherff’s relations with the Turks, and that Sheriff Hussain had quitted his headquarters and proceeded east, where he was massing hordes of Bedouins of the Harb clans. Still more recently, continued Mustapha, a report from an unconfirmed source stated that Sheriff Haidar, the Young Turk protege and candidate for the Sheriffate, had arrived at Medina to join the Turkish forces with whom were a number of Germans.

This project is our utmost desire, and we had already stated in our letter, dated 10th Rabi 1334—12th May 1916—the exact situation of Yemen, how and at what place the Turks should be dealt with. It might be essential to fathom the attitude of the Moula (Imam) Bin Hamid-ud-Din, in case he proposes to act in concert with us, be inimical to the Turks and will not assist them in any way, such is the duty that behoves him and us to follow in accordance with the Sharia and wisdom. If, however, he will continue to support and assist the Turks, it is but right to fight them fioth. By doing so, their power will be dispersed, and each of them will be busy with his own affairs.We thank you for the Italian (Wetterly) ammunition which is expected, us well as the ammunition for the gun and the machine for refilling cartridges which you hope to receive at an early date. Our mutual friend Saiyid Mustapha is at present at Kamaran. He is progressing in health—God pleases. Both him and ourselves are grateful to Government for the good act you have done us. We have received a letter from him thanking you as well as the Consul and Doctor of Kamaran. He will discuss the matter with you, and, being conversant with the Arabic language, he can interpret our wishes and explain them better to you, as if we were present.

This letter was written by the Idrisi prior to Captain Turton’s visit to him. (No date.) Prom—S aiyid Muhammad bin Ali bin Muhammad bin Ahmed bin Idris, the Idrisi, To—B rigadier-General W. Walton, Political Resident, Aden. After compliments .—We are in receipt of your esteemed letter, dated £th Shaban 1334 (10th June 1916). In re your allusion about the Sheriff of Mecca, we have stated in time past that, in consideration of his former position, he is not likely to declare warfare, as he has been of the notable Amirs of the lurks, and has frequently been fighting in their cause. If, however, he has changed his attitude of befriending and assisting the Turks, it must be an event which has now occurred. We therefore reckon this as a happy tiding of a great consequence, and, with the greatest pleasure, we are prepared to join hands and assist him in every possible manner in the way ^ of making attacks, &amp;c. Doubtlessly we have a great interest in this enterprise. Never theless, we have not as yet received intimation of the same through our borders adjoining those of the Sheriff in land. On this very time, however, we have received a letter from the Commandant of your warship “Northbrook” informing us of the telegram received by him from Aden from the Senior Naval Officer of the ships on patrol duty in the Bed Sea, and we learnt from this that the Sheriff has taken possession of the new Hamdia Bailway running from the Holy City of Medina to Madain Saleh and. that your steamers are bombarding the Turkish quarters at Jeddah. We are indeed very glad to hear of this news and forthwith we are beginning, God willing, in adopting measures to take the offensive. Our soldiers who were posted on the Turkish northern ’ frontier will shortly advance against the Turco-Imamic frontiers, in order to prevent them, by the power of God, from succouring their brothers at Hedjaz. It has been known to your honour that we had fought the Turks single- handed—so what would he our position now, when a third party is combined with us. Certainly it will not he justifiable for us, under the sense of religion4 or wisdom, to retract. But please note then, that we are fighting the Turks on the north, south and east. This means a great thing and will require an enormous quantity ot* ammunition. We have about 30,000 Wetterly rifles, the majority ol which are in the hands of our adherents, but we have no ammuni tion for them. There is nothing of vital importance to propose to Government except to facilitate the supply of ammunition of rifles and guns and other implements of war materials. With reference to the tribesmen under the Imam Yahya, alluded to by you, it is true they do not care to keep up the friendship of Turks, as they principally depend on the advantages and benefits they gain. It is possible to call them for this purpose. They had come to us last year together with several other tribesmen, because they find that they had severely sutfered at the hands of the Turks in the past. They (Turks) have now* broun-ht the Germans into their country. These are of different sect and nationality They doubt their conduct and therefore they prefer the Aden authorities as they are sanguine of their good conduct towards the people. Under these circumstances their (Arab) hearts have been attracted towards them (authorities) and had approached us mainly for this purpose. We had then written to you on this subject but received no satisfactorv reply from you We do not like to urge, hence we had dropped the matter till another time.* As to the report which has reached you to the effect that the Sheriff had applied to us to co-operate with him and that we did not send him a reply W e (are to say that we) have never heard of this story except from your letter. I he Sheriff, it is true, did sign letters to our address, but these were relating to some prisoners who have been in our charge and wanted us to release them. We have acquainted your emissary who came now to us of the same. ^ It the communication is conducted through your medium, they would ue more pertect. As regards the arrangement of attacking Lohia, this, if God willino- will he convenient soon, but we are hurrying up in arranging about the movements m the northern country m order that the junction between the Sheriff and ourselves may be accomplished owing to the fact that the Turks can Dossil receive reinforcements from Syria and he (Sheriff) ought to have a sufficient strength to co-operate m encountering the enemy. Besides it is more important that the northern portion should be united for the purpose of “uch emergency At the event of the Exalted Sheriff’s movement, it is essential to concentrate the tribesmen under us and to inform them of the existence of a helper and to take solemn undertaking from them to the effect that they shall faithfully carry on continuous attacks. We think that they will be pleased with this news and their energy will be increased more than usual. Since the last 8 years, the above referred to Arabs have been fighting the Turks and tin Arab all.es on the above 4 sides, but God wiUing thatTehet s foKhl cTr^ncli! 1 ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^thalTela^r'S i... s ' iid ai ’ i * u , ' u r«»- ith relerence to our friend Sheikh Muhammad Ba Sabi, we are T&gt;er(W.H„ sme that he wishes the Turks to be exterpated by any possible mean- v , ( ^ the control of the Bed Sea was in the hands of the Turks V ^ away a very considerable amount of his merchandize and he of 7ou,t be well disposed towards them.

Walton, Acting Political Resident, Aden, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Simla. I have the honour to forward herewith a report, with connected papers by Captain L. N. Turton, R.N. The main points in the report were conveyed to you in my telegram No. 222-A. P., dated 30th June 1916. 2. As far as can be judged, the Idrisi is working solely against the Turks and is prepared to assist the Sheriff even to the point of supp orting him f or the Ca liphate. He would, however, resent any claim by the She riff to the ownership of any parts of Asir. * ' ~ His friendly letter to the Sheriff, which was not easily secured, is an earnest of his desire for friendly co-operation. 3. The Idrisi is not actively hostile to the Imam but, in common with most decent Arabs, he regards him as a dishonest and despicable ruler. The Imam’s collection of troops on the Idrisi’s southern border may be connected with the withdrawal of his troops from the Behan border. Saiyid Mustafa states he has information that the Imam is now mobilising to attack the Idrisi. If so, the combined forces to be engaged by the latter on his southern border may be of a very formidable character. He assures me that there is no doubt that the Imam has definitely thrown in his lot with the Turks, and he is certain that he will not join the Arabian movement. I have impressed on him again the necessity for refraining from giving him any cause of offence and I am assured that the Idrisi will act only on the defensive against him. 4. It appears to me that we are somewhat concerned in trying to prevent the Turks now at Lahej from joining the Turkish-Imamic forces on the Idrisi border ; as well as in assisting the Idrisi with ammunition and with our Navy. 5. As regards the Hashid and Bakhil, the Idrisi intimates, through Saiyid Mustafa, that they will not be asked to co-operate unless we give our approval to their employment. He expects us to find a pecuniary reward for them if they are called upon, but this will not be paid until after services rendered. They are, as he says, soldiers of fortune and are independent. They threw off all allegiance to the Imam when he made terms with the l urks. It is clear that they are not now Imam tribes, nor in any way under the Imam’s influence. They are on the contrary in very friendly relations with the Idrisi and bitterly anti-Turk, although they are Zaidis. In the event of any large attack against the Idrisi, the Hashid and Bakhil would be an invaluable asset to him, as they would be in another way when the Idrisi attack Loheiya. But he does not require their assistance in his northern operations, nor does he wish to employ them inside what he considers as his terri tory. It seems inevitable that they will eventually be required, and when the need arises there may be no time for bargaining and coming to terms. I therefore request that I may be authorised to ask the Idrisi to discover their views and requirements so that the necessary agreement may be arrived at. 6. A great deal more ammunition will be required by the Idrisi. I am informed by Saiyid Mustafa that he was specially deputed by him to represent the extreme urgency of his requirements. The matter of most immediate importance is the early supply of the gun ammunition, as I have previously represented. C2 JwAD fl # £ 3 w2 ■Five million rounds of Le Gras rifle ammunition in addition to that already ordered anTtwo mfflion rounds of Wetterli ammunition for the use of the Idnsi and ^r stipendkries rvill be required. These will be stored here and rssued as circumstances demand. 7 Caotain Turton tells me that he was very favourably impressed by the personaUty^of'the Idrisi, and confers that it is his intention to act with perfect sincerity in oiihrfaalrtb obtaining a favourable and definite answer from tire Idna, and who has accompanied him here to see me. 8 I have the honour to invite attention to Captain Turton’s favourable remarks on the assistance rendered to him by Lieutenant Nalder, R.L .\ -R. Q rantain Turton has taken infinite pains to make his mission a success. He has displayed great tact and firmness and it is due to this that so clear an un er- standing of the Idrisi’s intentions has been gamed. No. 2-106. H. M. S. “ Northbrook,” 29tJi June 1916. Sir, I have the honour to forward the attached correspondence which passed between the Idrisi and myself between the 18th and 27th June 19 . The first part of the correspondence was based purely on urging the Idrisi to take an immediate offensive action against the luik. The latter part of the correspondence was based on information received from the Political Resident, Aden, and I am in a position to state that as regards the last letter no one but the Idrisi and the Saiyid Mustafa have seen either the letter or its reply. I beg to add the final remarks. There is no question that the Idrisi looks on Kunfida and the surrounding districts as his property by right and although he is prepared to act m a friendly manner towards the Sheriff as regards their double offensive against the Turk, 1 think that their future relations are very doubtful. Should the Sheriff consider that a general offensive against the Turk entitles him to the independent attack on Kunfida, the*most serious position between the Sherifi and the Idrisi is likely. The Idrisi welcomes the co-operation of Hashid and Bakil if supported by the British Government. With regard to the attack on Abha he proposes local siege shortly.. His Loheiya attack he will not be hurried into, although he states definitely that he will attack it later. He is convinced that the Imam’s present attitude is unfriendly and there is no question that he is keeping troops south for this reason. He states that the Imam can never be his friend as he always goes to the side that produces for him the most money. I do not think that a collision between the Idrisi and Imam is imminent or even likely. Finally I wish to again draw attention to the valuable services rendered to me by Lieutenant Nalder, R.N.V.R., who has assisted me as private interpreter in deal- inn with points of a secret nature.His advice on all occasions has been good and to the point and he is largely responsible for the cordial relations at present existing between ourselves and t e Idrisi through the Saiyid Mustafa. Lieutenant Nalder’s notes are attached. I have, etc., (Sd.) L. K TURTON, Commander in Command. To The Political Resident, Aden. H. M. S. “ N0BTHBR00K,’ , 29th June 1916. Sir, I have the honour to submit the following notes on conversations with Haiyid Mustafa, which may amplify the letters of the Saiyid El Idrisi. Most of the senti ments believe to be the actual utterances of the Idrisi. (1) The Sheriff. —Saiyid Mustafa emphasised the good will of the Idrisi to the Sheriff, and that he would assist him in every way possible, even if he were aiming at the Caliphate. He was, however, hurt that the Sheriff had not informed him of his intentions. The Sheriff had commenced brilliantly, but the enemy was close to his hand aud he was assisted by British ships The loss of the Hed]az would rankle with the Turks who might be expected to make a big counter attack, when the Sheriff might get into difficulties. As to boundaries, the Sheriff could not deny that all Asm, including Abha, its capital, was the Idrisi’s legitimate sphere. But if the Sheriff wished to oust the Turks from Kunfida, Mahail and Abha, the Idrisi would acquiesce, relying on the just arbitration of the British Government. (2) The Imom. —Said to be collecting troops (has he had time to hear of Idrisi’s movement ?) presumably to hold up some of Idrisi s _ aimy. so u e j unreliable: and any idea of obtaining his co-operation is impractical. He hand and glove with the Turks. HI Hashid and Bakil. —There is no question of the Idrisrs control over them He will not employ them himself (does not wish to introduce them m o Hoddda Loheiya District) but would be glad to see them employed by British scheme of opemlio.. in ft. im—M. (4) Immediate ZnJenJiows.-Kunfida and Mahail, followed by siege of Ebha rru Maces should give no difficulty unless Turks have, suborneci neinhbtmring 0 tribes^ 'ail said to-have got at certain sections of Eigal El Ma. The siege of Ebha is a formidable undertaking : and Idrisi has no gun ammunition which is most necessary. The southern offensive must wait: by clearing north Idrisi will be able to send an army to help the Sheriff should he get into trouble. (5) Tribal .—Mustafa states that the Shaikh of the powerful tribe of Ghamid, on the Hedjaz border, was recently in Gizan to see the Idnsi. Nasir bin Makhut of the Hashid sends a news letter to the Idrisi every 12 day In a letter written to Saiyid Mustafa at Kamaran the Idrisi absolutely Sis cfSXlt ‘ £ full knowledge and consent, been playing with the lurks to gam time. t4 (6) Ammunition .—Saiyid Mustafa, saying that he wished to speak quite plainly, said that the main cause of the failure of last year’s attack was our failure * to keep the Idrisi sufficiently supplied with ammunition. (7) Cartridge-filling machines .the message reached the Idrisi asking f for a description of his machine, he merely gave a French and Italian cartridge to Mustafa, from whom it appears that the machine is not in Sabia, but some where in the mountains. It seems doubtful if it is of any material value to them. I have, etc., (Sd.) L. F. NALDER, Lieutenant, R.JS.V.H. To The Commander L. N. Thurton, R.N., H. M. S. “ Northbrook.” H. M.

To Saiyid Muhammad bin Ali bin Muhammed bin Ahmed bin Idrisi, After greetings, I have the honour to forward to your Excellency the undermentioned copy of a telegram lately received from Jiddah :— “ Fourteen hundred Turks with 45 officers and 6 guns surrendered at Jiddah.tr Arabs have also captured two bill forts on tbe way between Jiddab and Mecca, taking guns, rifles and ammunition.’ , “ Sheriff is in possessin of Mecca and Taif. “ One-bundred and fifty kilometers of railway have been torn up north of Medina.” “ Force at Medina and Taif still bolding out.” 1 have also received by wireless telegraphy from “ Minto ” tbe following message from Shaikh Muhammad Ali-el-Birk to your Excellency . “ X w in no t fight until I get money, food, rifles and ammunition, then I will take Kunfida easily if a ship will assist to bombard Kunfida.” Since my lalst visit to Gizan I have been enabled to meet tbe Senior Naval Officer of tbe Read Sea Fleet and be informs me that tbe news in tbe north is far better than that expressed in the telegrams. The Sheriff continues to wage aviorous offensive against tbe Turk especially towards tbe north and north-east and bis efforts are everywhere crowned with success. I will take this opportunity of impressing upon your Eice lency the great importance of trusting me with the knowledge of your plans and dates and points of attack, as without this knowledge it will make it most difficult for our ships to be of any assistance to you. It must be obvious to your Excellency that the sooner you strike your blow against the Turk the more the chances of a complete success and an early and lasting peace and prosperity to your country and your trade. (Sd.) L. N. TURTON, Commander in Command. His Excellency Captain Teuton, Commanding H. M. S. “ Northbrook.” After greetings, I derived much pleasure from your honoured letter, especially from the telegrams which have recently arrived from Jiddah which contain the best of good news. The operations of the Sheriff deserve our thanks and assistance to him from us is obligatory. ^ M1 , . ^ Our operations, as I informed His Excellency tbe Resident, will now be m tbe north against Kunfida and the posts in the neighbourhood. The tribes of the Birk District are assembling and waiting for the troops which arp to be sent from us. In spite of tbe distances, and communication by camel, the ^LparatLns “re bein g hbried on and successful operations are expected shortly. , : Operations are now much easier than they were when we fought the Turks previously. . , r They were then in force and were receiving help from the Arabs : but now they are now cut ofl by land and sea and the Sheriff, formerly one of his greatest helpers, is now one of our friends. In a short time by the help of Allah we will inform you of our successful attack on tbe Turks. With regard to the letter of Muhammad Ah, Shaikh of Birk, the food and ammunition Ire now being sent to him. I have received information from him to-day thattheHali and other northern tribes are coming in to him to engage m °perati&lt;ms; He informs me that a warship has arrived at their harbour, but that he did not know what communication he might hold with them until he had been informed by us of wbat be might say. C277(w)FDAs long as the ships continue to visit Gizan, we will send certain persons with them to Birk for the sake of the shortening of the communications. (Saiyid Idnsds letter, dated 22nd June 1916.) To H. M. S. “ Northbrook,” 22nd June 1916. Saiyid Muhammad bin Ali Muhammad bin Ahmed bin Idrisi. After greetings. Herewith I beg to forward to your Excellency the letter from the Resident at Aden which I brought here on my last visit, and was unable to hand to any of your Ministers owing to my promise to deliver it you in person. I am now permitted to forward this through the hands of Shaikh of Gizan. I am also forwarding you three other letters, and I must beg your Excellency to understand the necessity of expediting your relpies for which I am now waiting at Gizan. I informed your Ministers on my last visit that I should return here on the even ing of the 21st June and hope that they conveyed to you that message. (Sd.) L. N. TURTON, Commander in Command. To H. M. S. “Northbrook,” 23rd June 1916. Saiyid Muhammad bin Ali bin Muhammad bin Ahmed bin Idrisi. After greetings, I beg to thank your Excellency for your letter, and I have duly received and will deliver letters to the Resident, Aden, and Saiyid Mustafa. It is a great pleasure to hear of your friendly regard towards the Sheriff, that your plans are completed and that you hope to strike almost immediately. It would be wise if your northern army could communicate with the ship off Kunfida in order that any assistance required may be given at the right moment. I have to day received a message fromH. M. S. “Minto ”—now off Kunfida, stating that the garrison is alert and much signalling goes on at night. Will you please give me timely warning as to when you may want to send to Birk, as the ships are very busy. I beg that your Excellency will inform me when your attack to the east and south, including Loheiya, may be expected as I presume you are not placing the whole strength of your great army in the north and it is of course obvious to you that a simultaneous attack on all sides will have a much more demoralising effect on the Turk than a strong offensive on his weaker points. I beg that you will honour me with a reply to this last question and I will await it at Gizan. There is no further news from the Sheriff at present, but communication must of necessity become more difficult, as his armies progress in a direction away from the sea. (Sd.) L. N. TURTON, Commander in Command.From ' The Saiyid El Idrisi to Commander L. N. Turton, R. N. 25th June 1916. After greetings, I have reeevied your honoured letter and was much gratified at the trouble you have taken and your endeavours for which 1 am most grateful. The soldiers destined for Birk have already actually begun their march and after they have arrived at Birk and joined up with the tribes of the Kunfida District the attack will be undertaken, when we will inform your ships of the assistance required. We would wish that ships should constantly visit Gizan and we may send some of the important men by them to Birk so as to help the communication for owing to the distance by land it takes at least 10 days to receive an answer to a letter. Our intention now is to gain the mastery of’ the northern district to ensure communications with the Sheriff and the other districts will come after, with the help of Allah. H. M. S. “ Northbrook,” 24th June 1916. To Saiyid Muhammad bin Ali bin Muhammad bin Ahmed bin Idrisi. After greetings, I have the honour to inform your Excellency that I must leave Gizan at daylight to-morrow for Kamaran. I have received a telegram from the Resident at Aden which makes it most necessary that I should, if possible, see you in person, as the matters to be discussed cannot be committed to paper. I propose bringing back your Excellency s cousin the Saiyid Mustafa from Kamaran and I will return to Gizan by the evening of Monday, the 26th June. If you are unable to visit Gizan at the moment I beg you will arrange for the comfortable conveyance of Saiyid Mustafa to Sabia, as he is still very sick, have not yet received your reply to my letter of yesterday, 23rd June, but hope I may still get it before leaving. (Sd.) L. N. TURTON, Commander in Command. H. M. S. “ Northbrook,’ 25th June 1916. To Saiyid Muhammad bin Ali bin Muhammad bin Ahmed bin Idrisi. After greetings, , r „ . , . , I beg to bring before your Excellency’s notice the following points whic require a conclusive answer. As the Questions are of such a secret nature which preclude them from coming through the^ordinary channels of a letter your Excellency’s cousin has volunteer ed you in person on behalf of myself and the BnUsh Govern- ment and to bring back a reply in the form of a letter as I understand that your duties at this moment are so heavy that you are unable to leave Sabia.8 » You may understand that any communication you may send to me will be received in confidence and conveyed in confidence through Aden to the British Government. (1) Absolute times, dates, and names of points of attack to the northward f intended by your Excellency so near as it is possible to give them, and what assistance you may require from ships and when that assistance will be required. If you could arrange your attack to take place after nine days, i.e., 9th July, I consider that would be desirable. , ■ (2) Whether you will or will wot write a letter to the Sheriff assuring him q£ friendly co~operation against the Turks. I have received a telegram that the Sheriff has proclaimed the independence of the Hedjaz and that the Hedjaz is now ready to receive pilgrims. (3) With regard to the tribes of Hashid and Bakhil, can you delay the question of their co-operation until after the capture of Kunfida, Abha, and Loheiha ? This would be advisable if it can be arranged : possibly it might be preferable to do without them altogether till Imam comes in. I should like a full statement of your policy and intentions with regard to the use of these tribes. (4) Date and time of attack on Loheiha with a view to ships’ assistance and also realising that the sea blockade between Kunfida and Loheiha cannot be raised until both places have been captured. I would suggest that the attack on Loheiha should be on 9th July also, so as to coincide with that on Kunfida. (5) Your definite view as to the steps you think that the Imam in likely to take under present conditions. (6) In the event of Imam remaining friendly to the Turks what are your intentions as regards Sania and tribes under the control of the Imam ? I wish to add the final remarks. I fully realise the extreme difficulties of communication and time wasted thereby which prevents a rapid offensive action on your part, but I should like to point out that it is now 16 days since you agreed to take an immediate offensive action against the Turks and that there is nothing yet to record. My object in mentioning this is my fear lest the opportunity created by the Sheriff’s action should be lost. The use of His Majesty’s ships for conveying messages and officials between various parts of your coast, with a view to facilitating your communication, has been offered, but no use has yet been made of this offer and it must be borne in mind, as I have previously pointed out, that due warning must be given. Should you find it convenient, we shall be willing to take charge of your Turkish prisoners and convey them to Egypt, as has been done in the cage of the Sheriff. , &gt; In conclusion I beg to assure your Excellency that we have the fullest confi dence in you and that the British Government is convinced of your friendliness and loyalty. Our common objective is to eject the Turk from Arabia for all times and to assure a lasting peace and prosperity to your countries. I have the honour to inform you that I have just received a telegram to the effect that Lith has been captured by the Sheriff. (Sd.) L. N. TURTON, / » Commander in Command. Erom The Saiyid El Idrisi to Captain L. N. Turton. Dated 27th Shaaban 1334. After greetings, We have received your letter from our cousin the Saiyid Mustafa and haves understood the points raised in it.With regard to our offensive against tlie enemy. We have already assured you of its reality, which has been our desire for many years. But we only received the news of the Sheriff’s action sixteen days ago from your Excellency and, as you know, our troops are Arabs whom we must, owing to the well-known condi tion of the Arabs, collect from direction. We have actually taken eight days in calling them up from different districts to our council and in explaining to them the operations required of them and that these operations are the culminating point of many years. This took eight days. They then began to prepare for the journey for this attack ; some of them have already proceeded to the northern district and all the rest will have begun their march by Thursday. Had we had even a month’s notice of the Sheriff’s real intention before he moved, we could have made the necessary dispositions for the whole attack to take place simultaneously. As it is affairs, by Allah’s will, proceed as well as possible. With regard to Kunfida, it is a matter of the greatest ease and, after our soldiers have collected at Birk, there will be no difficulty in attaining our object. As these operations are conducted by Arabs, it is impossible to give a definite day and hour, but providing that ships continue to visit Gizan we will inform them of the time appointed for the attack. We may send men and supplies by the ships for speed of communication. As regards the letter to the Sheriff, we concur in this for the sake of his final success in operations which we assuredly reckon as the height of success for us, and send you the letter herewith. As for the tribes of Hashid and Bakil, we received yesterday a letter from Shaikh Nasir Mabkhut stating that they are under my orders and I propose writing to him asking that either he or one of the trusted men should attend here, when we will discuss affairs with him and inform you. These tribes, as I have already informed you, are independent, owning allegiance neither to the Imam Yehia or anyone else. They are soldiers seeking their livelihood wherever they may find fit. For the present, we have turned our faces to the north, which is the most useful to the Sheriff for communications and for help should the Turks undertake a big offensive against him in the future. This is the one direction for meeting the enemy of the present time. With regard to the Imam Yehia, we have previously made a detailed report to the Government: it will now suffice if Saiyid Mustafa informs you verbally of my views. We have received information that he is collecting troops : it would seem that his object is to hinder our offensive and to prevent the advance of all our forces by necessitating the detailing of some to watch him. In conclusion we thank to you and the Government for your confidence in us. From The Saiyid El Iduisi, to Sheriff Hussain Ali, Amir of Mecca. After most cordial greetings, I praise the one God for you. There has gone from me the son of Shaikh Muhammad Areifan, bearing an answer to your letter. Further in these days we have received information through the British warships of your most successful operations, which have caused us the liveliest satisfaction and admiration. We will send a further letter of congratulation with some of those proceeding to you. 27th Shaaban 1334. {28th June 1916). G. M.

After compliments ,—On receipt of the pleasing news of Hedjaz by us, regarding the independence declared by His Excellency the Sheriff in the Haramain (Holy Places) and the cessation of the Ottoman rule in that country, we thought it best to submit this to Your Excellency and to direct your attention to the general situation and distress, which befell us, the whole province of Yemen and all Arabs generally on account of the existence of a small force of Turks in Yemen, who risked themselves and subjected the Arabs to all these calamities in order to oblige their friends the German only. They (Turks) destroyed the villages, killed both men and women, caused starvation to exist, the prices of food-stuffs to go high and trade to suspend. They have dishonoured the mosques by allowing their troops to tread them with their boots. Some of the mosques have also been made stables for mules. Owing to the great inconveniences the people have been put to, the people in the direction of Lahej ceased fasting in Eamzan last. Some of these things took place at Hedjaz. The pilgrims ceased going to the Holy Place on account of the obstacles raised by the Turks in their way. They (Turks) have thus incurred the enmity of the Musalmans generally. They dispossessed the people of their stuffs and gave the same to their troops. For the sake of the convenience of the pilgrims, the performance of the pilgrimage rites, the succour of the people of the Holy Places, the cessation of the plots of the Turks, the Grand Sheriff has with the support of the Almighty God risen and proceeded against the Turks of this Your Excellency must have heard. We write this to you to see if God will inspire sympathy in you to rise for the relief of millions of men in Yemen, the removal of the blockade, restoration of trade as heretofore and the independence of Your Excellency in Yemen. It does not appear justifiable to see thousands of poor Musalmans to suffer and put to ruination for the sake of existence of a small force surrounded with dangers and misfortunes from every direction, who purposely exposed themselves to ruination. They (Turks) however now restricted their actions at the present, to looting the Musalmans and closing their routes. Such actions on their part are quite unlawful and there is no doubt that the people are in distress on account of their maladministration. Everyone is ready to jump at them and send them away to their homes (Anatolia), &amp;e., and to see that they (Arabs) get some relief. By such step Arabia will be ruled by Arabs and all of us will be secure of their return to us for ever. In view of the friendship and loyalty to Your esteemed Excellency and the advantages that will be enjoyed by the Arabs (Islam) we think it your duty to rise up and bring the Yemen affairs, which both you and your late father whose seat is now in heaven suffered a good deal on account of it, to an end. We are expecting a hint from Your Excellency and we shall render our assistance, this fact is well known to you. In such time, oh sire, there ought to be one representative on behalf of Your Excellency with whom matters pleasing to you can be discussed. From all signs it can be seen that the Turks have been overcomed. Their policy in declaring war was a grave mistake as they have no concern^ nor advantage in such a war. Their conditions in Yemen are weak and so it is in Europe, hence we expect that they will be removed from Yemen without great difficulty. This will be the last time for the Turks to rule Icemen. The decision is left to you in this matter. May you be preserved.2 To-Our Master, the Commander of the faithfuls, A1 Mutawakil Alla Eab-al- Almin. Hay God protect him. The details of the authentic news of Hedjaz are that His Excellency the Grand Sheriff Husen (may God give him victory) has waged war against the Turks in the two Holy Cities with the assistance of the Arabs of the Hedjaz and Najd. m i • i He declared the independence of the Arabs from the Turkish sway. The fight between His Excellency and the garrison of the place began on the 8tb Shaban 1334 (9th June 1916). The victory was_ won by the Sheriff and he has occupied Mecca, Taif and Jeddah. The garrison has surrendered, and there remains only 2 small forts at Taif which are said to be still resisting. The command of the forces is entrusted to the charge of the 3 grown up sons of the Sheriff who proceeded and destroyed the Hedjaz Railway Stations to the extent of 100 miles along the line towards Syria. This is in order to preyent the arrival of reinforcements in case the Turks intend to send any. ^ May God assist and strengthen his (Sheriff’s) hands so that he might recover the glory of his ancestors and the honour of the Arabs. Oh my Master, the Hedjaz movement and action is quite devoid of any wild amhition and it is nothing but that tlm Arab country demands its inde- pendence and freedom from the Turkish yoke. Such is expected from an Arab Chief with living sentiments to know his enemies. And we hope that you will be explicit and show your intentions and aspirations and exactly mark your aims and the lines you desire to adopt. It will be much better if you will send a reliable emissary m order to fully dis cuss the matter in addition to the communication which will no doubt he perfect in detail. 7)at.t&gt;A the. 29th Shaban 1334 (30th June 1916). The present war and the results of 2 years 9 fighting. War in Europe. The Germans together with their two allies Austro-Hungary have suddenly declared war and attacked the territory of the Russian Government, which is now called the eastern field. They in the beginning succeeded^ in securing a large tract of land in the direction in Balonia, Galicia and Riga. They also took the offensive in Belgium, &amp;c. (a small nation on the borders of Erance). Both these fields are on the western front. When the Russians completed mobilization of their forces, they stopped the progress of the Germans and the Austrians in all sectors and succeeded in restoring some of their lost countries in Galicia and in the district of Riga. In the recent months they (Russians) have been taking vigorous attacks against Bukovina and Galicia in Austria. They have penetrated the line of the Austrian troops numbering about 650 thousand soldiers. They took 170 thousands as prisoners and scattered the rest. They (Russians) occupied the whole of Bukovina, part of Galicia in Austria and the Carpathian mountains. Erom these mountains and Galicia, the Russians are proceeding to one of the capitals of Austria called Lemburg. Their progress in this direction is successful. In the western front the progress of the Germans is in spans. They have for a long time been delivered fierce attack against Verdun and although they lost over 200 thousand killed in this place yet they gained nothing other than 2J miles. This village together with its fortification on the front is stilly in the hands of the Erench. It is on the east of Paris and about 150 miles distance therefrom.s The movements of the Germans appear to be in exhaustion on account of scarcity of their precautionary troops (viz., arrival of reserve). The French have now commenced progressing successfully, because the Russians and Italians are taking the offensive against both the Germans and Austrians in other quarters and have changed their plans. Italy is an ally to the British, France and Russia. She is taking the offensive against the Austrians and is progressing well in Austria. She aims at occupying Trieste. The great German colonies and the well-known islands in Africa and the Far East have all fallen in the hands of the allies, vis., the British, French and Russia. The descriptions are as follows No. of inhabit ants. Togoland colony was occupied on 6th Shawal 1332 „ f 1,000,000 West Africa was occupied on 26th Shaban 1333 ... 124,000 Camaroons was occupied on 25th Dafar 1334 ... ... 3,500,000 Progress continues in the largest tract in East Africa. The colony of Kiauchau in China has been occupied in Al-Hija 1332, inhabitants of which are 84,000 and its area is 2,750 square miles. The following 7 islands have been occupied on the 1st August 1914 corre sponding with Ramazan 1332 in the Far East:— No. of inhabit- A. S. miles, ants. 1.

These exclude the German country in Europe. As regards the war between the Turks, Russians and the British, the following is the result till the current month. The Russians occupied the following in the Turkish province in Armenia:— Inhabitant b.

The British after having occupied vilayet Al-Basra on the 5th Moharrum, proceeded to 350 miles in the interior of Baghdad. They have laid the railway line thereon. The Turk’s losses in addition to above is as follows:— 1. The annexation by England of the island of Cypbrus. 2. The annexation by Italy of the island of Rhodes, and all the Archi pelago islands placed under them since the war of Tarabuls. 3. The occupation of island of Rawaid by France in the Mediterranean Sea and the borders of Syria. 4. The independence of Cairo is being placed under the protection of the British Government, the cessation of the Turkish privileges there such as the military science and coins Pharaman and the annual tribute amounting to 7 lakhs pounds. 5. The complete separation of Mecca, Medina and Al-Hedjaz from their (Turkish) yoke. These are the true results of the war. The proclamations published in Sanaa Gazette are quite false. They have been made simply to mislead the Arabs in Yemen and to conceal the facts from them for their (Turks) military advantages. However, facts will come out soon and news will be conveyed to you by those whom you have not paid any wages. {Copy.) From—S ultan Abdul Karim bin Fadl bin Ali, the Abdali, To—I mam Yahia bin Hamid-ud-Din of Yemen. After compliments.^R^Q^ith. we enclose copy of a letter for Your Lord ship’s perusal which letter had been addressed to some of the Sheikhs of the Aulaki country who are our allies. We do not think that it will please Your Lordship or that it should rather be presumed that it was written under your eminent order. Oh my Lord, such letters are issued very frequently by your Mukadams nowadays and it is very surprising to see our fellow-countrymen are calling and urging us to enslave ourselves to the Turkish yoke. Hoes not such people fear God and have consideration for the kinship, ties of relation and neighbourhood (they bear towards one another) that they are trying to put them (Aiabs) into the paws and jaws of the wild Anatolians, the aggressors under whose hands your people had severely suffered for years ? Indeed it is not contemplated that those who are expected to recover the glory of the original owners in whose account the Prophet (may the blessing of God be on him) had said as under :— The rulers are from Kuraish (cited by the Bakari), The kingdoms are of Kuraish (cited in Mishkat Al-Masabih), The Khalifs (Caliphs) are of Kuraish (cited in volume II of Al-Jama’ Az-Zaghir), to invite their countrymen and helpers of the Arabs to surrender and become slaves to foreigners? We never expected them to resort to such misleading attitude and misuse the verses of God in the interest of the transgressing nation who revoked the Sharia and set it aside while some philosopher has invented Al-Qanoon Al-Asasi (Judicial Code) as a substitute for the same. lend i t UC i h barS,? and stroI1S ex P 1,ess i°ns are likely to create doubts and in d in d a y e t rslon amongst the Arabs who are expected to unite and • er in ) e right cause. 1 he Mukadams however are frequently send- Which we de 0U t a l S * hlch they imply to have been written under you/orders Tu d i n0t h 6 . 1 . 1 , 67 ®- Therefore we refer this matter to Your Lordship with w ^ a you will prevent such publications and show your good will and Sincere inclination towards those Chiefs (Aulakis, &amp;c.).5 * Arclij. of astie loj their They facts come paii Oh lord, we are made astonished to find that the writer of the letter finds faults and criticises the attitude of the Arabs which is entirely and solely devoted in the interest of Moslim Chiefs who rule their country independently and exercise their own laws and customs since they knew themselves and the same relations have subsisted amongst them individually. Is it not more reasonable for the writer to criticise the Turks who befriended the Germans and unsheathed their swords to fight in his favour. Here in Yemen they are doing the same for his sake and all their proclamations are full of his (German’s praise). The English have come to Aden before the Turks coming to Yemen, hut they have not quarrelled with any of the Chiefs about his independence in his own soil, on the contrary however we govern our country according to our own religion and do as we like. Over and above this they (British) give us con tinuous subsidies, whereas the Turks came into the Yemen after them, fought with their co-religionists and turned them out of their own dwellings. His Lordship our Master Al-Mansoor and his father (may God bless their souls) have fought them until they revived the Islamic Sharia and caused their “ Qanoon ” (Judicial Code) to cease in some portion of Yemen, but this Qanoon ” is still in force in many other parts (in Yemen). The author of the letter stated threateningly that if they (Aulakis, &amp;c.) will not go to Saeed Pasha to Lahej, they shall get the same thing the Abdalis have got, and that he will shortly proceed to Beda and Hadramout. Are these according to the Islam’s Commandments that Moslims should he fought, tortured and driven away from their countries ? Kindly observe, oh our Lord, what has been said about Saiyid Alawi bin Hason Al-Jifri, i.e., “ Don’t listen to him as he is one of the enemies of the Imam”. Now (please note) that the friend is regarded as an enemy and vice versa. Oh Master, you have full experience of him (Saiyid) and others. ier ns !li ’S s 3 lThis Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, r and should be returned to the Foreign Office when done with nnless required for official use.] Q 73 ) \ ^ j 4 - , EGYPT r L MILITARY r Decypherr Dr 3c45rPrrja Sir Hr McMahon (Ramieh) September btlm 1916ci R p 7 u 40 r P r m No r 756 r September 5thr 1916 r India telegram 606 Sr to the Secretary of Goats for Indiar We have received no further news from Hedjaz of military position round Medina hut everything Lor the moment seerne to depend, on. situation at Rahegh which it Sheikh in not disposed of may later on threaten Jeddaha If the place holds out and stores of arms and supplies collected there remain available tor Turks danger to Jeddah may render stoppage of pilgrimage advisable* Operations against Rabegh are now proceeding and I expect definite news in 2 or 3 days* Decision in Egypt with regard to pilgrimage is that it would be unwise to prevent it as long as there is reasonable chance of success and arrangements for pilgrimage are therefore proceeding* Your telegram shows that same view is held in indiar If first pilgrim ship has not started it might perhaps he better it this can be done without exciting comment to delay it to September 10th 3 when second ship was to start (see your tel, 972 W, August 26th)» I hope. before that date to send more definite news.

The paper approvingly refers to the legislation by the Government of Merwara on the submission of a petition by its zamindars (land-holders) in this connection and observes : Many will object to such legal interference on the part of the Government on the ground that the marriage ceremony is a religious one, But, in our opinion, this action of the Government is quite proper because it has been enacted on the one hand at the express desire of the people and on the other hand it is calculated to bring those people to the right path who do not listen to the social advice and bring down their progeny to distress through their stupidity.

But the bombardment of the sacred buildings of Kerbala and ^ af nll/ed could not evoke any sort of denunciation of their action, although it is claimed that members of the Shiah community occupy the Chairs of the President and the Secretary of the Moslem League. Hakeem- Berham, the Editor of the Mashriq of Gorakhpore makes the following observations on the above incident: “ For the last few years I have been of the opinion that the Moslems have committed two blunders. The first of them is that the Cahphate was ^ken out of the hands of the Arab blood and the second of them is that the seat ot the Caliph was established out of Arabia. Had not these mistakes bemi com mitted the predominance of the Mo f lem , c0 ™™.^ among them would not have been so weakened. And if the seat of the Calipn had been at Hedjaz the whole Moslem world could concentrate there. Commenting on the above the Islah remarks that none will question the two blunders. But an addition of one blunder more will make a triumverate of mistakes of historical importance. This mistake is not attributed to the Moslems at large. The Editor of the paper craving the indulgence of the Moslem public traces the fountain head of all these blunders m the election of the first Caliph who was elected illegally as an immediate result of which almost all the corn- pan ion« of the Prophet were handicapped from the honours of offering their Islah, No. 9, July 1916, Jt'CLTlJli188 Pataliputra.

It says that there was a great danger of hard competition for the seat in the Imperial Council from the Moslem electorate and events have proved that the apprehension was not groundless The predominating personality of Mr. Haqq had produced sufficient effect in the allairs of Cawnpore and Bombay and his intrinsic merit had impressed and received recognition from all concerned. Hence the turn that the poli tical problems so far as it concerned the Moslem community was to take depended on the single question of this election which is full of mysterious events. ^ An investigation into the same will prove that the whole community Wets going to be duped and that which was exhibited in glowing colours was not worth admiring, for all that glitters is not gold. The paper further observes that the election of Mr. Haqq is not his per- sona! success but the victory of independant but constitutional political party. And it is pregnant with important future consequences. The Moslem community should fully avail itself of this opportunity, without being puffed up with this preliminary success for, there are multifarious obstacles to sur- mount m attaining the goal for which resolution, determination, strong faith, etc., are required. b 19.

The Qaumi Report, of the 19th July, writes When the time comes 41 Mussatmans and Mussalmans.” f 0r seai ; chin g hearts of the people the hypocrites are terror-stricken, their knees begin to knock, their feet to slip and their tongues to stammer, and they are conscious of a feeling of shame. This is due to the fact of their aversion to the truth to which they are utter strangers. Many people feel their sinful ness before Grod and repent in secret and the generality of men do evil and commit sin all unseen by human eye. But he is a man who is perfectly natural, be he good or bad. People take the term Mussulman to stand for a long beard and a short trousers, or they consider that to be a Mussulman merely consists of calling oneself one and paying attention to externals. Such people are deceived, while they imagine that those who only regard the outward appearance are unable to penetrate their disguise. Those men who have dyed their beards and soaked their minds have degraded themselves and the faith. This sanguinary European war teaches us that there is no rest here for the epicurean. Those who regard worldly life as the chief object of human existence spend their days in suffering and finally sacrifice all their ambitions. But such sacrifices are not acceptable to God, and it will be said of them that they lacked purity of motive and were made under compulsion and the force of circumstances. The history of the world tells us that thousands upon thousands*of Mussalmans have waged war and fought great battles. It was they who were victorious in the crusades, conquered Constantinople and fortified the walls of Spain and Grenada. The earth drank the blood of their martyrs and is able to testify that their wounded neither winced nor whined. All this was due to the fact that theirs were spiritual wars. But the present struggle in Europe is degrading to the Divine. The war-god of Europe who wears on his proud head the crown of the Ceesars and whose throne is surrounded by scientists and scholars is now being punished by his brethren. This hostility and war among Christians constitute a great object-lesson for Islam. If Mussalmans had acted like the Christians and upheld the world with both hands they would have fallen upon one another and perished. It is now admitted that after this sanguinary war there will be none of the present comfort left in Europe. There will be a change in European foppishness and its civilization and education will assume a different garb. Mussalmans should be ready for that time which will be a testing-time for hearts and minds. Men will be induced and incited to act contrary to the code of the world. They will see religious and moral education appear in a new light and lustre and experience the delights of life and social intercourse. But we must avoid these things, for all the predictions regarding the day of reckoning are being fulfilled one after the other, and we are being convinced that the time is coming for the manifestation of the mighty power of God. Therefore, after the war, we must all proclaim with one voice, the time for physical victory and defeat is past! arise ye people, and fight a final battle for the spirit! This is the way of your salvation. Islam stands before, come and listen : Come back ! come back ! whatever thou art, Cease from thy infidelity, sun-worship and idolatry. This court of ours is not a court of despair. If thou hast broken thy vows of repentance a hundred times, still come back ! • 26.

About four hundred years ago that famous scion of the House of Ottoman Suleiman led his victorious armies into Egypt, raised the Ottoman standard there and took from the Arabs the priceless gift of the Khalifate which enormously increased the might and majesty of the Turks.1325 f V ERN A CUL AR PA P E RS.

But the British do not intend to be as active now as the Germans were in the Russian theatre last year. 'Their only intention is o prevent the Germans from taking their army from France to another centre Ld to reduce the pressure at Verdun. .... The fear tha the German will gain the victory has to-day been removed. We must not expect that the Germans will be at once defeated by the mere fact that the Allies have commenced the offensive. But we can surely believe that the Germans can no more act on the ofiensive. It remains to be seen what course their decline •will take. The telegrams now received are encouraging. • 2b. The Sampad Abhyudava ,of the 28th July, writes For the past TOO years Ireland has been fighting for Home Rule. Ireland and Home Eule. ^he leaders of Ireland created much trouble during this war time. The British Government thought it more expedient in these critical times to grant their demand than face this opposition. Home Rule was decided upon in consequence. There was opposition to the question as to whether this was the proper time to grant Home Rule, and it was sug gested that it may be granted at the close of the war. Others held that there was nothing to he gained by putting it oS. Lord Lansdowne resigned out of disgust. His resignation has not yet been accepted. It is generally 7 urged that the grant of Home Rule would cause no harm, hut, on the other hand, it would remove discontent, promote loyalty and strengthen the empire. This seems reasonable. If India, too, should be granted Home Rule, it would certainly add to the strength of the British Eule. 24.' The SwaaesaMimani, of the 28th July, in a leading article, giving an optimistic review of the European situation, The second anniversary of the rem arks that although the wanton aggression war - of Germany and Austria embroiled England, despite the latter’s best efforts to avert the war and although the enemy could boast of some slight successes during the first few months, recent events prove beyond doubt that the abundant resources of the Allies and the thoroughness of their equipment latterly has converted their defensive into offensive, which, if continued for some time more, must succeed in pushing hack the enemy into their own territory. The paper next dwells on the huge amount of devastation caused, and thereupon observes :—In the 18th and 19th centuries Europe thought herself pre-eminent in all matters. She thought she could lead the whole world in the field of law, science and education. She believed that ethics or philosophy could be learnt only from her. She thought herself the prime fount of civilization. But looking at the havoc which this same culture has been causing during the past two years, even the eastern nations who have been deploring their own backwardness will naturally cease to envy the fruits of this civilization. As sure as there is a principle that makes for righteousness, this misdirected kultur of the Germans will meet with due punishment at the hands of the Allies, the truth of whose cause will, we have no doubt, bring them the final victory 7 before long. We conclude this article with an 11 Amen ” to the prayer that will go forth from all British subjects on the second anniversary of the war for the success of the British arms. RiSTNaPATRIKA, Mamlipatam, July 22nd, 1916. Sampad Abhyttdata, Mysore, July 28th, 1916. S-WADE6HABHIMAHI, Mangalore, July 28th, 1916.1327 1 ui’ks establisliing their power in Egypt the Sharif of Mecca ^handed over to the Sultan the keys of the holy places and all the Arab Itnbes with the exception of those of the east submitted to the authority of the Ottoman ruler. After fifty years of peace the Arabs made a bid for liberty and freedom, the Sharif defeated the Turkish forces and once again raised the standard of Arab independence. Salim II as soon as he ascended the throne tried to reconquer Arabia but m vain. ^ The kingdom of Yemen became more and more powerful, ut Wahabi inroads, the capture of Aden by the English and successive ^8ypii an invasions weakened it and finally the Turks advanced against it and seized the capital. Meanwhile the power and influence of the Wahabis increased when the Sharif of Mecca in aiarm, sought the aid of the Turks who with the co-opera tion of certain friendly tribes, sent a force of five thousand men to destroy the Wahabis, but it was obliged to return without achieving its object. Encouraged by this result the Wahabis attacked Taghdad and laid siege to holy Kerbela and spread death and destruction far and wide. Taif, Mecca and Madina fell one alter the other and the sanguinary struggle continued for a long time during which the pilgrimage was absolutely stopped except for the followers of Wahab. This state of affairs kindled the wrath of the Muslim world against this sect and the sublime Porte sent Muhammad Ali Pasha, the Governor of Egypt, to conquer Arabia. The indefatigable exer tions of this man overcame every difficulty and gradually Turkish domination over the Arab was reasserted and the influence and the might of the Turkish Khalifate re-established before the world. Similarly whenever, in later times, the Arabs have taken advantage of the natural difficulties of their country or local political conditions, to throw off the alien yoke, the 'Turks have subdued and conquered them. The physical features of the country are such that no army can easily invade it, besides the Arab love of freedom and independence make him disinclined to endure for long any foreign domination. Again, no Arab State can be established in the Hedjaz strong enough to resist a foreign power. It is impossible to collect the necssary materials. The region is unfruitful; there are no mines and it is destitute of education, civilization, arts,' industries _ and commerce. There is nothing but dreary sandy waste where neither agriculture nor industry nor trade can flourish. It was on this account that when the rule of the first four Khalifas came to an end and the simple Khalifate was changed for an imperial State with all its social and political ramifications, the capital was transferred to Syria in fulfilment of the prediction of the Prophet upon whom be blessings and peace, “ The Khalifate in Madina and the Kings in Syria.'” There is no doubt the Turks have been guilty of a very serious blunder in making no attempt during these four hundred years to pacify and civilise the Arabs. Had they but taken a little trouble in this direction much good might have resulted. The fact is, the Turks themselves have made little progress in education, arts and industries as they have been engaged in war with European Powers for the last two hundred years. It is true that quite recently Sultan Abdul Hamid Khan II felt the need of these things and began to take practical steps in this direction and the first tangible result was the Hedjaz Railway. But the vicissitudes of time and the shortsightedness of the young Turks did not give this wise statesman and enlightened Sultan time to complete his plans. Had it been otherwise the Turkish Empire would not have seen this evil day. The Mushir-i-Dakhan, of the 120th July, in continuation of its leader on this subject in a previous issue, writes :—With all this, according to the Paisa Akhbar, although the Turks have ruled for many years over the Hedjaz they have never regarded Mecca and Madina as conquered cities, but have held the holy places in such reverence that the Sultan has not only never subscribed or called himself the Sultan or the master of the holy places but has regarded the title of u servant of the holy places ” as one to Mushib-i-Daxhan, Hyderabad, July 20th, 1916.1328 be proud of. It is this religious sentiment that has prevented the Turks from exercising their authority over Mecca and Madina ; and it is for this reason that out'of consideration for the Sharif, the slightest complaint from hmy amainst the Governor of the Hedjaz was sufficient to ensure the prompt recall of the latter functionary. For example, not long ago ten or twelve Governors were changed within the short space of two years. Such a procedure would not be adopted by any other ruling nation in the world. There is not another city on the face of the earth where the Government or the Municipality or the Governor does not levy a tax. But the Turks because of their pious belief have not levied a tax of a single piaster from Mecca or Madina during ah the centuries of their rule over those cities. On the contrary lacs, nay crores have been paid out of the Turkish exchequer for the maintenance of the holy places and payment of services rendered at the shrines. Every year an imperial caravan conveys gifts, provisions and money for the people of Mecca and Madina. Likewise another caravan carries grain and supplies from Egypt. These things constitute their yearly harvest, money is spent so lavishly in Mecca and Madina that there are hundreds of “Imams” and “Muazzens” and servants who get their pay for doing nothing and probably do not attend prayers even once a year. Thousands of maunds of oil and candles are supplied/ All this expenditure is met by the Turkish Exchequer and is prompted by pious belief. Every Sultan has spent money ungrudgingly on improving the buildings of the sanctuary and providing carpets and chandeliers. It is said that in Liie sacied enclosure at Madina /here are many gifts of gold, silver and precious gems hundreds of years of old the votive offerings of the Mussulman Kings of the world. Even when Turks were most powerful, they left the management of the roads to the Hedjaz in the hands of the Sharif of Mecca. Hence if pilgrims were plundered or murdered by the Bedouin, the Turks did not interfere, the Sharif’s administration alone dealt with these matters. The Turks have made one mistake and that is a serious one, for which they are now being severely punished, they have always treated the Arabs of the Hedjaz with indulgence and kindness. They understood not the secret of governing and ruled implicitly on these Arabs. If pilgrims were required to pay a large amount for the hire of camels, it was the Sharif who was responsible. The Turkish Government had nothing to do with it. The Sharif summons the Bedouins every year and settles with them the rates and from the amount realized he takes a lump sum for his own treasury, a fact which is well known to the British Consul at Jedda who is also well acquainted with the hardships of which the pilgrims complain. Mushir-i-Dakhan, The Mushir-i-Dakhan, of the 22nd July, in continuation of its leader on jui^Sd, fl i 9 i 6 . this subject in the issue of the 20th instant, writes : -The foregoing account clearly shows that the attitude of the Turks towards the inhabitants of the Hedjaz has been that of the ruled and not that of the ruler. It is also admitted that the real position of the Sharif of Mecca is not that of an independent king or a tributary chief or vassal, but that of a servant, who like any other official is paid from the Sultan’s Exchequer about its. 12,000 a month. Therefore the word u rebel ” may be applied to the Sharif. The chief characteristics of the Arabs is that they will obey only their own tribal chiefs and that they are ready to sacrifice their lives at the command of their chief, be he in the right or in the wrong. The Sharif exercises authority over almost the entire region of Hedjaz and all Arab tribes regard him with respect for this reason among others that as a Saiyid he is a direct descendent of the Prophet: The present Arab revolt has not merely dealt a blow to the Ottoman Empire but to the Arabs themselves especially in the Hedjaz where, according to the first telegrams received, the Bedouin had, at the instance of the Sharif, destroyed the railway line and demolished the stations on the Hedjaz Railway for about a hundred miles from Madina. Apparently this was done to prevent the Turks from sending reinforcements but in reality the destruction of the Hedjaz Railway willmean enormous loss. T ast sums of money were spent on the construction •which took years to complete. It appears from the account of the same ^contemporary tnat during the time of peace this portion of the line was guarded day and night by sentries placed on the hill-tops on either side of the railway. Even if the people of Hedjaz have succeeded in shaking off the Turkish yoke and in establishing their independence, obviously they will not be able to reconstruct the portion of the line thej^ have destroyed for the simple reason that they have neither money nor men nor materials to do so. It is also true that unless railway communication is re-established between Syria, Mesopotamia, etc,, there will be no progress. If for any length of time they do not get provisions by sea they will perish of hunger. In conclusion, if a kingdom is established in the Hedjaz it will require years and years of peace and tranquility under the protection of a powerful State. '^7. The Jaridah-i-tiozgar, of the 2?th July, writes:—It is scarcely Jaridah-i-Roz«ar, Grermany and Italy. necessary to explain that, when the triple July 274**1916. alliance and the triple entente were formed in Europe, the former consisted of Germany, Austria and Italy who solemnly agreed to help one another in the time of trouble. Similarly, the triple entente was formed between Great Britain, Russia and Trance on the under standing that they should help one another in case of necessity. It is as clear as noon-day how the members of the triple entente adhered to their alliance on the outbreak of the present European war. But there was a division in the triple alliance, for Italy, being fully aware that Germany and Austria were the originators of this dreadful struggle and the incendiaries responsible for this wmrldwide conflagration, warned them that the condi tion of the alliance which required mutual help only applied when the territories of one of the signatories were attacked by an outside Power. But as the present war had been begun by both of them, she would remain neutral. From the above facts and from those published in the daily telegrams the paper concludes that Italy will shortly declare war on Germany and observes : “ The result would be to greatly strengthen existing relations between Italy and the Allies and to add considerably to the difficulties of perplexed and distracted Germany. We think the time is fast approaching when the very name of the German Empire will be blotted out from the page of existence, for her military position and financial condition are getting worse and worse every day, while the numbers of her foes are increasing. Thus, gradually, her kingdom will one day be brought to an end and finally Great Britain will be victorious,” II. — Home Administration. id) Police. 28.

'We do not know when and how this want is going to be supplied. In the first place the condition that the candidate must be a graduate ^ seems to be unnecessary, nor does there appear to be any precedent among the appointments made by the High Court. A man should be acquainted with and experienced in the work. For instance, although the late Munshi Meyan Jan Sahib was not a graduate, yet the efficient manner m which he discharged his duties requires no proof to-day. 1 here are many people in the country who are not graduates but who are good interpieteis. e do not wish to press the point, but there is already employed in the Hign Court a voung Muhammadan graduate about whose ability there is no doubt. I his capable man has frequently given proof of his ability and linguistic capacity, and it is inconceivable why his claims, established by his service and know ledge of the work, are being overlooked. It is also astounding to find no Muhammadan Interpreter in any of the four Magistrate Courts including that of the Chief Presidency Magistrate. Hindus are doing the work of Hindustani interpieters, but Mussalnian litigants are distracted and they have no confidence in this nomMuslim Tjrdu whfdfreany should be called Tamil-Urdu. This is a queer case ! On the one hand the High Court attaches so much importance to the oihce ot interpreter that it is looking for a graduate. On the other, a subordinate court considers it such an easy thing that it entrusts the work ot Urdu trans lation to Hindus ! It would not be surprising if the High Court were to appoint a Hindu Persian and Urdu Interpreter simply because he happens to be a graduate! &lt; j ta • -i i m + We hope these grievances will very soon be removed. It is possible that the Judge and the Magistrates in their wisdom and learning will refuse to be misled by defective interpretation, but this will not satisfy litigants. ^ e } T feel the need most acutely and their dissatisfaction is well founded. Our demand that the appointment of Interpreters should he made forthwith, and that the proceedings of courts of justice should be entirely free from all doubt and ambiguity is certainly not out of place. (d) Education. 30. In its leader on the subject of education, the Desamata, of the 19th July, says :—The Anglo-Indians say that the Education in India. Indians are given more education than they require at present. From the very beginning they have been standing in the way of India's progress, and spurning national ideals. America has in 18 years done in the Philippine Islands what England has not been able to do in 150 years in India in the matter of education. While the people in England now demand a thorough change in the system of education obtain ing there, it is no matter for surprise that the Indians clamour for a similar change in the system followed here, which is not only inferior, but also tends to undermine the health of boys. We pray that a committee may be appointed to enquire into the causes that have contributed to make the present system of education in India unsuccessful. 31. In the course of its comments on the recent meeting of the Senate of the University of Madras, the Desamata, of the The recent meeting of the 26th July, says:—The present Indian Univer- ^ eIlate • sities are so many machines manufacturing quill-drivers for Government service like the depots sending coolies to Natal. From an examination of the results of the late Intermediate examination in Madras, it will be evident that the University is not mindful of the welfare of students. The official element being predominant in the University, no regard is paid to the voice of the people. It is hoped that the proposed increase in the strength of the Syndicate will improve matters to some extent. 32.

X. In the Agra Akhbar of the 21st July, 1916, the editor assures his The Arab revolt. readers that the indignation expressed at the action °f the Sharif of Mecca is not due to his throwing off the yoke of the Ottoman Government but to his exposing the sanctity of the sacred places of Islam to defilement, and through being the cause of manslaughter within the locality which has been declared sacred. He also assures them that the indignation of the Indian Muslims is directed against the Sharif himself as it is fully believed that it was not at the instigation of any power that the Sharif revolted. He assures Government that the news has caused considerable anxiety and unrest amongst the Muslim public. He says that only those of his co-religionists who are Khan Bahadurs have indulged in false and out-of-place sycophancy, expressed gratification at the news of the Arab revolt and have given out that they consider it conducive to the well-being of Arabia. He assures such people that it is no bravery to raise their voices against religious beliefs. ° He remarks that expression of such views cannot hut result in leading Government to believe that Indian Muhammadans will sell their very religion for titles. He expresses the wish that people could realise the value of the sanctity of their sacred places. 2. Saiyid Muzaffar Ali Khan of Jansath, district Muzaffarnagar, contri- The Arab revolt. butes an article to the Surma-i-Rozgar (Agra) of the 24th July, 1916 in which he welcomes the news of the Arab revolt and expresses gratification that at last Mecca has come into the possession of one who being a descendant of the prophet has a legitimate right to the possession. He says that now there will be greater facilities for the Redjaz pilgrims. In the Mashriq (Gorakhpur) of the 25th July, 1916, the editor expresses surprise at the attitude of Indian Muslims to the Arab revolt. He is not prepared to believe that they are horrified at the thought of the sanctity of their sacred places being violated. He says that they ought not to have lost sight of the fact that no non-Mus lim nation entered those sacred places. The Turks and the Arabs, who are both Muslims, are responsible for the violation of the sanctity and these two nations ought to have had greater respect for the sanctity of the sacred places. He points out that with the exception of the British subjects the Muslims of other parts of the world have evinced no interest in the movement. 8 . The Arab revolt He reminds his co-religionists that in the circumstances to ask Government not to uphold the Sharif of Mecca will be tantamount to asking Government to assist Turkey. He remarks that if Turkey has the power she will suppress the rebellion and regain supremacy, and from the religious point of view the Muslim world will have to recognise the political ruler of Arabia as the religious head. He points out that on many previous occasions also the Arabs rebelled against Turkey, and asserts tnat the Muslim League which is in the hands of pro-Oongress Muhammadans does not truly represent Muslim interests. He asks Government to announce that the Muslim League is but a branch of the Congress and that the Muslim public have no faith in it. AGRA AKHBAR, 21st July,1916. SUBMA-I- ROZGAR, 24th July, 1916.

The Mushriq (Gorakhpur) of the 25th July, 1916, publishes an article in which the writer asks Indian Muhammadans to The Arab revolt. refrain from entire condemnation of the Sharif of Mecca as this is opposed to the tenets of Islam. He assures his co-religionists that their remonstrances cannot influence the Arabs. He is opposed to the proposal to send a deputation of the Anjuman-i Khuddam-i-Kadba to enquire into the true state of affairs in Arabia. He however says that if it is necessary to send a deputation the cost ought to be met from the Anjuman-i-Khuddami Kadba funds. He is also opposed to the suggestion to raise a fund by public subscription for the purpose. He concludes with the remark that Indian Muslims ought to be glad at the Sharif’s declaration of independence, as it has restored the seat of the Caliphate to Arabia the centre of Islam.

The Avadhbasi (Lucknow) of the 18th July, 1916 (received on the 22nd July), says that it cannot as yet be said The war m Europe. which of the belligerents have won, but it is a good indication in favour of the Allies that while the German offensive has ceased, their offensive has now started on a systematic basis. The editor remarks that the termination of the war will depend on whether the Allies succeed in their offensive and invade Germany in their turn. It will be very difficult to bring the war to a close if Germany successfully resists their offensive. He however remarks that there is every hope that when the Allies attack on all sides Germany will yield. He prays for the early termination of the war. 6 . India and the war. In the Naiyar-i- Azam (Moradabad) of the 25th July, 1916, the editor takes exception to the remark of certain Anglo- Indian newspapers that India has not rendered any very appreciable assistance in the war. He invites the attention of his Anglo- Indian contemporaries to the statements made by Messrs. Chamberlain and Chur chill appreciating the services rendered by India. He refers to the general belief of British statesmen that India is an inex haustible source for recruitment of the army and says :— “ If military assistance has been received smalijin proportion to the popu lation the fault does not lie with Indians. Government ought to have trusted Indians. The Arms Act should have been relaxed. Indians should have been enlisted as volunteers. If Government had given military training to Indians, India could have easily provided two million soldiers and undoubtedly satisfied the desire of the correspondent of the Times. Indians would have driven the Germans out of Persia, and saved Egypt from the attacks of the enemy. Even now the past mistakes could be rectified. India was, is, and will remain loyal. The continuance of British Rule in India is the continuance |of the existence and progress of India itself. Indians and the British depend on each other. One cannot exist without the other. Therefore trust and sincerity should now be put into practice.” 7. The Rajput (Agra) of the 15th July, 1916 (received on the 24th July), _, . .... refers to Mr. Churchill’s suggestion for increasing the strength of the Indian Army and throwing open the commissioned ranks to Indians and remarks that if his suggestion is adopted educated Rajput youths will very eagerly join the army as commissioned officers and through their influence many other youths of the community can also be easily recruited.REVOLUTION IN ARABIA. ml left the Arabs practically free fo do as i they listed.

SIKAJUDDIN AHMED, Bar-at-Law.—A few weeks ago, I published a pamphlet “Haqiqat-i-Khilafat” (The truth about the Khilafat) in which I put together a few arti cles, written by the late Sir Syed Ahmad Khan in 1897, on that subject of vast importance to tho Muslim world—the claims to the Khilafat. I j had added to these articles some fifty pages of explanatory notes, in which besides presenting | a brief review of the subject matter of the ar-1 tides I discussed the political situation at that. time and its bearing on the subject. At the I time of publishing my pamphlet I had no idea . that events in Arabia, which are, however, in no ; way unexpected, would in the very near future bring the question of the so-called Khilafat inti; prominence. The effect upon the minds of the Musalmans of j India of the news that the Sharif of Mecca ; had announced his independence may be embodied j in a few words. The illiterate Muslim public ' showed complete ignorance of and indifference to j the significance of the news, while the majority &gt; of the educated Musalmans, although they kept ■ an open mind on the matter, failed to anriyze j the real natx;re of the revolution. Both part.&lt;;s however, are perfectly satisfied when the cause and effects of the event are placed before them in a true light. Some of the enlightened Musal mans have given expressions to their satisfaction f at the event and their feeling is that this up- j rising in Arabia will solve for all time the vexed j question of the Khilafat. A protest has, however, been raised by one of the Maulvies of Lucknow, who seemingly has failed to grasp the true significance of the Ara bian revolution, which in his opinion has greatly perturbed the minds of the Muslim community m India. Following him a few Muslims of Lucknow have raised their voices in condemnation of the Arabs as rebels and enemies oF Islam and have passed a resolution to the ^ effect that the Arab revolt endangers the sanctity and safety of f the sacred places of Islam. . . Let us examine the sentiments of our sensitive brethren of Lucknow and their resolution. Do they really mean to assert that the Arabs are enemies of Islam because they have renounced their allegiance, such as it was, to^ the iiij-ks who have lent our sacred religion to Germany to j be one of its weapons wherewith to gain an m- g famous supremacy in the word? Are the Arabs guilty because they refuse to be identified with j a nation who side with our Empire s enemies and i tacitly concur in their inhumanity and utter de- j pravity. 1 If the Arabs.are enemies of Islam because they have endangered the sanctity and safety of our holy places, let us see how far the accusation is true. As regards the sanctity of Mecca and Me dina it is difficult to imagine how it can be en dangered. If these holy places derived their sanctity from being under the domination of Turkey, then with the elimination of Turkish control, undoubtedly their sanctity would disap pear. But if they derive their sacredness from their connection with Abraham the first and with Muhammad the last and greatest ot the prophets then their sanctity will remain niiduni- nished. In the past attcmpts wcre niade to desecrate the sacred places of Islam. For Yazid, son of Muawiya turned the Masaid of prophet into a stable, levelled the sacred tombs ami pulled down the Kaaba Yet in ^e minds of all true believers those places stdl rejnain aj sacred as before, and will remain so despite the condemnation of the Arabs by certain misguided an d biassed Musalmans who seem to ”vSok that the Sharif of Mecca .s the teeg descendant of the Prophet and that th e Araas , are his kith a nd kin. Arabs have never been conciliatory to the Tur kish domination and the Turks never succeeded in gaining their confidence. During the four hundred years of the Turkish control of the Hedjaz the Arabs have never missed the op portunity of struggling against and throwing away the Turkish yoke whenever one presented itself. Turkey therefore by weakening her mili tary strength in that part, virtually invited the present revolution in Arabia. It is a question now whether the Turkish military party, who are the real rulers of Tur key, will desire to recover the Hedjaz and whether it will have sufficient value at all in their estimation to make it worthy of recovery and retention. It is generally known that Tur key never derived any material benefit whatever from their dominion over Hedjaz. In fact the nominal possession of that country annually cost Turkey crores or rupees in bribes and otherwise. This heavy expenditure was borne by the Turks, either that they might reap the fruits of it in the world to come or that they would be com pensated in this world by purchasing the sym pathies and aid of every Muslim community in their hour of need. In this latter expectation they have been utterly disappointed. Germany hoped and Turkey believed that when the call was sounded from the so-called Khilafat every Musalman would rise to hbp the Turks. But tbs Muslims outside Turkey were neither so foolish nor so ignorant of their religious duties as to allow themselves to be led away by the Tur kish military party and German intriguers. Of the two conjectured objects of Turkish expendi ture in the Hedjaz, there only remains the hope of spiritual reward and it is to be seen whether or not Turkey is willing to spend her money aa before for that purpose. Those people, who are pleased to call the Arabs rebels, perhaps are unaware that the Turks have never claimed to be the rulers of the Holy Land, nor have they ever treated the inhabitants of those parts as subjects and the Arabs would in fact never have borne such treatment. The Sultans of Turkey have always taken pride in calling themselves the servants of sacred Mecca and Holy Medina. No taxes were ever levied on those cities, but, on the other hand, enormous sums, as we have already stated, were paid out from the Turkish treasury as salaries, stipends, presents, etc. The Government of the Hedjaz and the holy cities was entirely in the hands of the ^harif, who was paid 12,00,000 karash per annum as a subsidy. The Turkish representative called •wali has always been liable to transfer if he in curred the displeasure of the Sharif. Accord ing to M. Mahboob Alam, no less than 10 to 12 walies were transferred in a period of two years, because they did not please the Sharif. oiore it would be absurd to call the PTrnTtT* JVlblJL dllU. XVXAJ-. — So far - the safety of the sacred places in Arabia is concerned, every Musalman hsm °niy to remember that God himself has provided for [ this. He has ordained that Mecca and Medina should be situated in a country containing nothing which would tempt the ruth ess invader.^ It is a country barren and inhospitable with not. . a sign of mineral wealth or any other wordly attraction. If in the distant past tins part of Arabia was ever invaded, it was for the pur pose only of chastising its ruler and in later times its possession has been sought by Muslim ruling dynasties, so that they might obtain thereby the privileges of the so-called Khilafat and thus be able to wield those privileges for their temporal advantage. . „ The Arabs have been styled the enemies of RT6£ 9T H no noipeoqddu stff o^ peqsn smw. pun -g; QZl notqoes q^tAV peer f apop H n0 cl 9t D 1 ° Z02 notpiag aepun poq.se.iXB sum. pun^sropun oj uoatS sum psunoQ • 9 dw?uoQ on; jo xoppa piujstssu bvjJUAUjquqQ/ xapunS rauFqg ’xpj P Jfuqaq no uoT;uoqddi| nuq u nx qnd pnu uqqnopcQ ‘aopog jo xauoissitffl -moo X;nda(j Suxqon ‘Muqg ’xpi axojaq pxuaddu ‘Mtff-qB-xeqsiJ.ieq ‘rauaSug 0 *xj\[ iCupuopj; uq ’00i ' a II °1 poqnnomu Suiuoao oip a rebel, although it may be said that the Sharif has not acted wisely in asserting his indepen dence and thus deprived himself and many others of monetary advantages which they received from the Turks. But the Sharif’s answer to this is that whatever he has done, hag been for the purpose of upholding the sanctity of the holy cities and for protecting and saving them from those dangers which the Turks had created. Previous to the war Turkey had no enemies amongst the big Powers and the Turkish domi nions were safe. But when Turkey joined in the war the Arab opinion must necessarily have been that any part of the Turkish dominions was liable to be invaded by her enemies and this view must have been strengthened by the in vasions of Gallipoli, Armenia and Mesopotamia. It is known that when Anwar Pasha visited Mecca, some time ago, the Sharif told him &lt;c You are an ignorant person and you are dragging Turkey downwards to its ruination.” The Sharif has therefore achieved the separation of Hedjaz from Turkey so as to remove it from any danger of a hostile action and being included in the ruin of Turkey. The Sharif in declaring the independence of the Hedjaz has acted for the best in the light of his own understanding and, if his act can be attri buted to a good motive, no one has a right to use strong language in condemnation of it. Apart from the question as to whether Turkey oi»Yhe~ Arabs have the power to protect the Hedjaz, the whole world knows, and the Muslim gentlemen of Lucknow, who like good Musal mans are feeling anxiety for the safety of the holy cities, must also know, that our sacred land is being protected by the greatest Muslim power in the world for the sake of her eighty million Musalman subjects, or in other words the eight crore Muslim subjects of the British Empire are responsible for the safety of the Hedjaz. It is to be hoped that Musalmans have not degenerat ed to the extent and lost their sense of fairness that they are unable to feel grateful to those who have acted in a noble spirit towards them and have done good to them. It is neither loyal nor honest to increase the difficulties of the Government at the present time by publishing false views and thereby misleading the Miisal- man public. It does not require any deep think ing to come to the conclusion that it is abject disloyalty to sympathise with Turkey, even under any cloak as long as she is fighting against our Empire, and it is disloyalty all the same to con demn Arabs, under any excuse, who are in their present position the enemies of our enemies and therefore our friends. j. &amp;b 0 1 Telegram f rom Viceroy.

We can hardly understand why the Government should content themselves with this pious wish. The complaints made in the Legislative Council were with reference to the inadequate rates for cart-hire fixed by Collectors. The proper remedy is not to set up, as it were, the accused as judge, as is now done by the Government, but to call for reports as to existing rates and suggestions for enhanced rates and then issue instructions to the officers concerned after a calm consideration of the whole matter. It will be much better for the administration if the Government would revise their notions about the infallibility of the Collectors.” 24.

The paper is so much out of touch with Indian feeling now that its belief, perhaps, is natural; the blame lies on those who circulate such falsehoods. But it ought to be remembered, as a matter of commonsense, that India circulates over here, and that Musal- mans will be infuriated at this misrepresentation of their real sentiments. Most Indians do not read the Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph, but India has a circulation over here among educated Hindus and Musalmans.

I have the honour to be, Madam, Your most obedient servant, L. Robertson, Secretary to Government. u All efforts to obtain a copy of the Rules issued under the Offence Act have so far failed. So we do not enjoy even the light they might shed on the mystery. How joyous a thing it is to live under a form of Government that uses a war measure to restrict the liberty of a harmless citizen, and ‘ are unable to enter into a discussion on the points raised ’. The Government speak the truth when they say ‘ unable,’ and we congratulate them on their frankness. We felt pretty sure that they were unable to give any grounds for their order, and we are pleased to find out that we were right. My letter reached Bombay on July 14th. The Government took twelve days to find an answer, and finally confess their inability to discuss. ‘ Condemn unheard ’ is the only way in which the Government of Bombay can shut out of its domain a 'loyal subject of the Crown. The omission of the 6, and the leaving of the year as 191 is of course accidental, but it is significant. The sub-conscious mind of the Government of Bombay realise that the year 191 is more appropriate as the date of its order than the year 1916.” 26.

He admits that. the Turks paid no attention to the im provement of the condition of Arabia but adds that they are not responsible for the inconvenience caused to pilgrims, since they maintained only a military occupation of the country while their paid servant, the Sherif, was entrusted with the control of the Bedouins. According to Islam the Sherif has committed a grave wrong in rebelling against his ruler. Rebellion against a non-Moslem ruler is accounted a sin, and rebellion against a Moslem ruler is an even greater fault. He denies the allegation made by certain anti-Moslem papers that Muhammadans believed the Government to have had a hand in the rebellion and asks Government to proclaim publicly that they'have had nothing to do_ with it. He urges Muhammadans to keep quiet and be of good heart at this critical time. VII.—GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. (h) Miscellaneous. 2. The Khatib of the 7th and 14th July 1916 warns its readers against the The snowball prayers, system of the snowball prayers set on foot by some mischievous individual. Many Muhammadans, the editor says, are so foolish as to disregard the religious duties enjoined on them by God, and follow this silly idea, which merely results in the expenditure of an immense amount of money.

The Mohammadi (Calcutta) of the 14th Julv writes • The Arab revolt. . contemporary of ours has, in a venomous article, held the Young Turks responsible for the Arab revolt. 1 he fact is.that the shortsighted policy adopted by Sultan Abdul Hamid in deference to his Jewish and Christian Ministers is responsible for all the discontent and disturbances in the Turkish Empire. Our contemporary should remember that when the Young Turks assumed the government of the country in order to remedy this evil, they were praised by everybody. Thej Englishman, however, goes a step further and says that the Young Turks are responsible for the downfall of Turkey and for the loss of the Balkans, Tripoli, Egypt, Morocco and other places. We ask the Press Censor whether we should give a reply to this allegation or not, for there is a danger of a discussion of this subject leading to an interchange of unpleasant recrimination, but if the Englishman attacks us unjustly in this fashion, we shall be forced to retaliate. We have been repeatedly saying, when the fate of Turkey will be decided on the battlefield, do not discuss the conduct of the Turks in this country, nor allow others to do so. The Turks, so far as this war is concerned, will not gain or lose anything if the Indian Musalmans bless or curse them a hundred times daily. What then is the use of discussing the conduct of the Turks ? Let the Indian Musalmans peacefully go on showing their loyalty to their Sovereign as they have been unflinchingly doing from the beginning of the war. II.— Home Administration. (a) — Police. 2.

The animal was stolen, taken to a jungle, killed and skinned. The police were informed of the matter, but did not come to the scene of occurrence until three days after the event, during the whole of which time the owner of the bullock had to mount guard over its putrid carcass. Cattle-lifting and cattle-poisoning have been rather frequent in those parts of late, and the paper invites the attention of the police to the matter. 3. The Charu Mihir (Mymensingh) of the 11th July writes that the Special constables in Kishurganj. local public have learnt with surprise of the decision of the authorities of Kishorganj to enlist Babu Tarak Narayan Chaudhuri of Banagram village and certain other gentlemen as special constables, presumably with the object of giving informa tion about political offenders. Tarak Babu has recently retired after serving Government for a long time, and if Government had so wished, he might easily have been made to help the authorities with news about political offenders without being compelled to assume this humiliating and vexatious office of special constable. 4.

As a result of this want of fore- tht on the part of Government secret associations of anarchists were formed and the police put to serious difficulties m detecting them Besides this innocent persons, who have no connection with anarchists, have been arrested and detained in hajut. If sedition had not been driven underground, it would have been possible to discover some remedy for it, but now there is no hope of doing so, as no one knows who are really responsible for this situation. _ . . Political agitation means there is unrest in the country. By agitating we want to acquire more privileges than what we at present possess. Government does not S upon this with favour. In 1833, Lord Macaulay said that that day would be a proud one when Indians would demand self-governing rights qIqc ! tVmsA Indians w r ho are to-day demanding self-government are looked upon as seditionists. Poltical agitation is the safety-valve through which the^ hot steam of unresit goes out. This is the reason why Lord Dufferin gave his patronage to the National Congress in the first year of its existence. The cause of the Bombay Government’s anger against Mrs. Annie Besant is her Home Rule agitation. She resides in Madras and not m Bombay- Under the circumstance there was no reasonable ground for this action ot Government. It is our conviction that Mrs. Besant has done nothing which is likely to endanger public safety. The Defence of India Act and its rules aie extremely dreadful. They should be applied with great caution. Up to this time attempts to crush political agitation have been harmful to Government and it is surprising that the Bombay Government has not learnt a lesson from past events. Those wTo- want to agitate for self-government, keeping themselves within the bounds of the law, are loyal to their Kmg- Emperor. 6. The Dainik Chandrika (Calcutta) of the 15th July writes Commenting on the Bombay Government s “ The Bangaii on the Besant or( ^ er on ^p rs Besant not to enter the Bombay affair ” Presidency, the Bangaii remarks :— “ Madras is Mrs. Besant’s field of work. The Government of Madras has not thought it necessary to issue such an order on her. The Bombay Govern ment has been the first to do so. It remains to be seen whether this example will be followed by the other provinces or not. Needless to say, the order has astounded us. The thought of what next may come has made us anxious. The public, writes the Bengalee, would like to be informed as to the grounds on which the Government of Bombay’s order is based. It declines to accept the vvse dixit of the Government of Bombay in the matter. The Government of Bombay has not distinctly stated any ground for passing the order. It simply savs : “ The Government have grounds to believe that Mrs. Besant has acted and is about to act in a manner prejudicial to the public safety.” The Bengalee, however, sees nothing but “ the spirit of fervent love and devotion to England in her acts, writings and speeches, and savs that “ the Government is pursuing a very unwise policy in regard to Mrs. Besant.” According to the Bengalee, “ the means adopted by the Government of Bombay against Mrs. Besant will defeat its purpose, for, suffering endured in the public interests raises the sufferer to the status of a martyr. The demand for security for New India followed by the recent order will cast a halo round her name and fame.” We, however, think that the Government of Bombay would never have passed such an order against a person of Mrs. Besant’s position, attainments and reputation without very strong and sufficient reasons!. It is not, therefore, our business to animadvert on the matter. Government is bound to take whatever steps it thinks proper in the interest of public safety. Nevertheless, when there are people who will always regard every action of Government with suspicion, we think that the authorities ought to inform the public of its grounds for action in such cases as the above. They should also state the grounds for internments under the Defence of India Act.1 * f** 0 ' / jr /l [/W\hn H { 649 ) I.—Politics. (a) — Foreign. 1 . The Advocate (Lucknow) of the 6 th July, 1916, protests against the The Arab revolt. comments of the Englishman on the meeting mi n 7 . 7 recently held at Lucknow to condemn the Arab revolt. The Englishman said that the resolutions passed at the meeting could only be accounted for by the unrepresentative character of the meeting, by the absence of accurate knowledge, or by the existence still of a little of that misplaced and misspent sympathy which the Moslems of India once entertained for the Young Turk party. The Advocate says it is only right and proper for outsiders who do not profess Islam to stand aside in an attitude of silence and reverence for the feelings of the great Islamic community whom the recent events in Arabia so intimately affect. The writer asks non-Muslim papers not to indulge in unseemly writing and not to aggravate the situation. 2 . In the Mashriq (Gorakhpur) of the 11 th July, 1916, the editor The Arab revolt. remarks that the Arabs have on several previous occasions revolted against the Ottoman Government yet the Indian Muhammadans have never taken much notice. He says that the great anxiety shown by them now is due to the apprehen sion in their minds, created by the injudicious and misleading observations of the Englishman the Statesman and the Leader, that the Anglo-Indian and the Hindu newspapers desire Government to support the Sharif of Mecca’s rebellion against the Ottoman Government. He says that the British Government should maintain a policy of non interference. He expresses the assurance that Government will not listen to these newspapers but on the contrary will order them to stop writing in this manner. He asserts that Indian Muslims are opposed to the Caliphate passing out of the hands of the Turks as long as the Ottoman Government exists. He asks his co-religionists to entertain a proper regard for their duties to the British Government lest like the Arabs they too should be condemned for turning traitors to their Sovereign. 3. In the Mashriq (Gorakhpur) of the Ilth July, 1916, the editor refers The Arab revolt. to tlie Ara b revolt and remarks that the disaffection of the Arabs is due to the fact that the Ottoman Government paid no attention to the diffusion of education among the Arabs nor to their rights. He expresses regret that all over India, liberal Muhammadans are condemning the Arabs whereas they themselves demand self-government for India and consider it is the only means of obtaining the regeneration of their country. He remarks that people who demand freedom and self-government for j India have no right to condemn the Arabs. He says that people with revolutionary views ought to consider how far their views differ from those of the Arabs. He expresses his inability to comprehend how the anxiety and enthusiasm displayed by Indian Muhammadans can have any influence with the Sharif and the Arabs. He points out that there is no necessity for reminding Government of its duty, which is to have a regard for the religious sentiments of its subjects. He observes that Muhammadans made a great initial mistake in allowing the Caliphate to pass out of the control of the Arabs and in not having the seat of the Caliphate in Arabia. advocate, 6th July, 1916.

He savs that Indian Muhammadans have no cause to agitate in India and enquires what steps were taken by them on the numerous previous occasions when the Arabs revolted against the Ottoman Governmen . He says that reliance should be placed in God and prays that the Arabs will abandon the idea of self-government even though the Indian Muhammadans do not. 4 iSMfeed (Cawnpore) of the 11th July, 1916, asks the JEmgliskman and the Statesman (Calcutta) and the Leader (Allah- The Arab revolt. abad) not to unnecessarily stir up the religious Qpnt.imfmts of Indian Muslims by making improper observations about the Arab f i. revolt * . . , ^ The editor contends that in describing the British Government as supporting the Sharif of Mecca, the Anglo-Indian and the Hindu newspapers have rendered themselves open to action under the Defence of India Act as Government has neither directly nor indirectly countenanced the action of the Sharif. He points out that Indian Muslims have denounced Prince Sahab-ud-din and other Muhammadans of revolutionary ideas, who have for some time past been endeavouring to break up the centre of Islam and says that the attitude of Indian Muslims is no concern of others. He invites attention to the fact that people who support the Sharif are indirectly encouraging the anarchical movement in India. 5. The Naiyar-i-Azam (Moradabad) of the 12fch July, 1916, reports that under the presidentship of the Hon’ble Saiyid The Arab revolt. Eaza Ali a representative meeting of the Muham madans of Moradabad took place in the Juma JHasjzd on the 9th July, 1916. The president in his speech explained that the Arab revolt at a time like the present endangered the sanctity of Mecca and Medina and he asked his co religionists to give honest expression to their feelings and request the British Government to avert the danger to the sacred places of Islam. He condemned the Sharif of Mecca. The J?esh Imam, moved the first resolution denouncing the Sharif which was seconded by Dr. Abdur Bahman (of Bijnor). The Doctor expressed indig nation at the attitude of certain Anglo-Indian and Hindu newspapers. He complained that the views expressed by Lords Cromer and Crewe on the subject in the Parliament wounded the feelings of Muhammadans. Even during the war it was promised that the sacred places of Islam would remain immune from war operations, but the speeches of the ministers had created suspicion in the minds of Indian Muhammadans. He pointed out that the claim of the Sharif to the Caliphate was untenable, and that the Caliphate is a matter for the majority of the people to decide. He said that it was the duty of the British Government not to encourage the Sharif and to state that it condemned the action of the Sharif. The other resolution asked the Muslim League to hold an extraordinary meeting at some central place in order to discuss the matter and to persuade Muhammadans to give honest expression to their feelings.

Almora Akhbar of the 17th July, 1916, dicusses the necessity for Kumaun and military service. forming a Kumaun battalion and refers to the sweeping remarks of some Anglo-Indians that Indians have not helped Government in the present war in proportion to their resources. The editor is glad to note that the higher authorities have recognised the services and help rendered by Indians in the present war. He remarks that Indians are not to be blamed if Government does not allow them to keep arms, and he refers to the enlistment of Bengalis in tho Erench army at Chandernagore. He expresses regret that the refusal of the British Government to allow them to enlist in the army is very painful \ 'jI.—Politics. : . &gt; («) Foreign. 1. (o) The Urdu Bulletin (Lahore', of the 9th July 1916, publishes a Turkey and Arabia. translation of the comments of the Englishman T . . on tlie resolution passed by the All-India Muslim League expressing indignation over the revolt in Arabia It characterizes the resentment as an “unbridled expression of excitement” and says that we are fully convinced that when_ the Islamic world will consider the circum stances which have arisen it will not agree with the sentiments that have been expressed in somewhat harsh language in the resolution passed at Lucknow On the contrary, it will consider that this change is a precursor of greater comi Iff.? f ? r 1 0 , the Hedjaz. The Islamic world will not mind if the Sultan of Turkey is forcibly deprived of that spiritual power which his predecessors had usurped and which the Sultan himself had converted into a barbarous power devoid of the friendly feelings of Christianity and the moral greatness of true Islam. (b) The Desk (Lahore) of the 13th July 1916, reproduces an abstract of an article from the Civil and Military Gazette (Lahore), of the 11th Jnly 1916, m which the latter paper, after describing how the Arabs whose rule once extended far and wide, lost their independence, writes as foliows : — To-day Arabia still stands disunited. Whether the Grand Sheriff of Mecca, who is de facto ruler of the Hedjaz, has behind him sufficient temporal power to make good his independence, and whether he is aiming at more 'than the freedom of his own particular portion of Arabia, time alone will show, iiut it wih be a striking manifestation of the Divine Providence if the efforts now being put forward by the Allies to vindicate the right of the weaker nations to live their lives and work out their own destinies should also result incidentally in the fulfilment of the dream which some thirteen centuries a^o came to the founder of Islam o£ a free and self-contained Arabia. It is this aspect of the present crisis which gives it a peculiar .interest in the eyes of the student of political movement.” (c) The Taisa Alchbar (Lahore), of the 15th July 1916, publishes a communicated article written by Bui Bahadur Kunj Behari Thapar, who starts by recapitulating the history of the Arabs and their glorious achieve ments in the past and passes on to observe that after the lapse of several centuries they have again made up their mind to restore their country to its former greatness. The declaration of the independence of Arabia is the first step towards this goal, and Indian Muhammadans cannot help rejoic ing to see the birthplace of their holy ancestors treading, the high road to liberty and. civilisation. The proclamation is an historic event which will revive the national life of the Arabs, and greatly benefit the Muslim world, for the Turkish Government alone was responsible for the diverse troubles of the pilgrims. The A nglo-Bussian forces have gained success after success in Mesopotamia, and the shrewd Arab sardars ) seeing that the Ottoman Government is the last flicker of a dying flame, have decided to tako full advantage of the present rere opportunity. They have declared their independence under the leadership of tho enlightened and powerful Sheriff of M;cca. It has also transpired that a few months ago when Enver Pasha visited Mecca he had several influential Arab leaders arrested and shot or hanged, ibis naturally inflamed the minds of tho Arabs, who have thrown off the Turkish yoke. Reports have come from Calcutta, Madras, Bombay and other places that leading Muhammadans are glad at the declaration of Arabian independence ; but there are other Muhammadans who condemn the Arabs. A more sober consideration of the matter will enable these to change their views. Tho army of tho Grand Sheriff of Mecca has over powered the Turkish troops at Mecca, Jeddah and Taif and seized a largo quantity of war materials and a number of rifles and machine-guns. The Sheriff’s followers have not only desfroyed the Hedjaz railway but also out the telegraphic communications. These facts indicate the wisdom* administrative ability and other high virtues of the new ruler of tne Hedjaz. The itiema also favour the602 -k’aa of the independence of Arabia, and educated Egyptians and the Muham- rmdans of Syria and Mesopotamia are prepared to support the Sheriff. Those Who condemn the Arabs are the enemies of the latter and the supporters of TnrHsh mismle No wise man can oppose the declaration of independence onthe nart of the Grand Sheriff without proving himself to be the foe of Uberty and civilisation. The Arabs, who promoted learning and conquered a part of the world, are not devoid of administrative ability and by establishing a peaceful Government they will soon restore their nation to its past greatness. 2 The VaHl (Amritsar), of the 12th July 1916 notices the curious * v coincidence of every step m the construction of the The Palace of Peace. palace of Peace at the Hague having synchroniz- ed with breaches of peace. When building operations were started the South African War brokemit; while the period of the preparation of estimates coincided with the declaration of war between Russia and Japan. When the foundation stone was laid, the Kaiser paid a visit to Turns and complications arose over the Morocc an question. The completion of the first stage of the construction work was followed by Austria taking possession of Bosnia and Herzogovinia and the commencement of the second by a struggle between Germany and Prance over Morocco. Its completion was followed by the Turko-Itallan aid the Balkan Wars. The final stage has seen the outbreak of the present terrible conflagration. Sir Harry Johnstone, a most zealous supporter of the peace movement, is horrified at the sight of the dreadfu consequences of his past work in the cause of peace and has become doubtful about the success of the peace movement. Efforts are being made to es tablish another peace conference and it is surprising that the work has been entrusted to the United States of America. It is further suggested t at vhe con trol of the proposed international police should ho placed in the hands of the United States. But it is doubtful if tlie suggestion vrill eommand approval. Will England, Erance and Russia consent to place their destinies m the hands of Arr. erica, a country inhabited by eleven million Germans ^and five or six hundred thousand Austrians, who exercise great influence in shaping American policy and who are sure to secure for themselves the control of the internatmnal police r Some people think that this work should be entrusted to Sweden, Switzerland, or Holland. But even this proposal is open to exception. German is the langu age in which business in Holland is mostly transacted. The great majority of the people of Switzerland also speak the German tongue. Educated Scande- navians too carry on their correspondence in German. The Swedish gendar- maric of Persia and the Hutch gendarmarie of Albania are favourably inclined towards the German language. In international disputes these people have generally sympathized with the Germans and Austrians. It is owing to these reasons that Sir Harry Johnstone declares that in future those countries that have remained neutral in the present war will not be trusted. They should all roly on international agreements and remember that if they are divided, they will fall a victim to the dailv growing aspirations of the Central Powers of Europe. Sir Harry Johnstone is quite right, and no attempt to establish peace will he succe c slTil' so Jong as the ideas which emboldened Germany and Austria to wage war against the whole world arc not finally crushed. 3.

They spent money extravagantly before the war ; hut now every Englishman prevents his country* men from indulging in extravagance. Only recently a strange incident took place. Two Englishmen were tried on a charge of having poisoned the dog of a clergyman. A girl stated that the accused gave her a letter addressed to the clergyman, stating that the sum which he daily spent On the food of his dog was sufficient to fill tho stomach of a wounded soldier’s son and that it would be better if he relieved himself of the burden of supporting a dog ; otherwise tiny would be obliged to kill the animal. Another witness stated that he made the dog eat poisoned meat at the instance of the accused, Tho eourt^ released the accused, the magistrate holding that if they killed the dog with the object stated their patriotism, though it had reached the linwt pf madness, was worthy of appreciation.I nl d f P^ers 5 i ork hs la to I® ■ spent « p / ts 165 of the etiquette of the Subdivisional Officer to disgrace Pramatha Babu even when he repeatedly craved his pardon ?

Further, the Council of the Moslem League declared as the enemy of Islam all those who sympathized with the Arabs. Commenting on the above procedure of the Moslem League the Editor observes :—“ No one knows whence the Council of the Moslem League has been authorized to sanction such mandates of infidelity and of Islam, as the result of which it declares the sympathizers of Arabs as infidels. Its own sense of regard and respect for Islam is best revealed by its apathetic attitude on the conduct of the Turks in hurling down shells on the sacred buildings of Kerbala and Najaf. And still it is proclaimed that the Moslem League is con stituted of the members of both the communities—the Shiahs and the Sunnies. The Editor further remarks that, in his opinion, the whole Shiah com munity has been vehemently disturbed in its emotions by the knowledge that shells have been thrown on the sacred buildings of Kerbala and Najaf, and consequently the Shiah community considers the perpetrators of such evils as infidels of the blackest type, detests them and approves of the action of the Sherif of Mecca. ' The Editor commenting on the whole question finally concludes with the suggestion that all such resolutions and telegrams passed or sent on behalf of the Moslem League or any other such body, emanating in the name of Moslems of India, should be taken as the views of the Sunni community, and the Shiah community has no connection whatsoever with such actions of theirs ” Shiah, June, -1916, Shiah, June, 1916. 13.

The Editor is outwitted altogether and fails to know the way in which he may bring to book these mischief-mongers (Sunni authors). It comments on the conduct of the Editors of the Vakil of Amritsar and of Sadaqat of Calcutta for their having the books “ Zulfeqar Hyderi” (a Shiah book) proscribed by the Government and their further attempt to see “ Shamsher-i-Willayet” (a Shiah book which contains vituperations against the Caliphs according to the Sunni interpretations) proscribed and challenges, if any body has taken pains to peruse the books, “ Aswat-us-Sadaqat ” and “ Resala-i-Id-i-Ghadir ” and the articles of Khadim Hussian, whether their contents go to wound the feelings of the Shiah community or not. The Editor concludes by making a proposal that the Sunni community should eliminate all such topics, references and incidents from their books on Tradition, Theology and History, as, when cited by the Shiah authors in their own books, offer an occasion to the Sunni community to raise a hue and cry. When the Shiah authors do not originate anything with the motive of wounding the feelings of the Sunni community or creating racial disaffection and merely quote facts from the Sunni works, why should the books of the Shiah community alone be proscribed and they alone be subject to such treatment?” 14 14.

Tracing the causes of this change in the uniform of the School during the incumbency of its late Head Master, the Editor describes the cordial relations that existed between the two communities at Aligarh during the Secretaryship of the founder of the institution and the subsequent infringement of the right of the Shiahs by the successive Secretaries, which, in the opinion of the Editor, reached such a high pitch that the inequality of treatment was sought outside the sphere of the College.

Pataliputra (Bankipore) says that the Times oj London has waxed exceedingly hot (“ has become the brinjal fried in oil”) over the book and has found fault with it in very strong terms in its leader. The paper further observes :— £&lt; An Anglo-Indian paper has re marked that the Times has attacked the book rather than reviewed it.” *19.

Utkal Dipika, July 8, 1916. 0R1YA PAPERS. 20. The Utkal Dipika writes that as there is no law in British India limiting the rate of interest to be allowed Necessity of a money-lenders’ Act. to money-lenders, they charge their debtor with interest at any rate they please, provided the latter agree to this rate at his hour of need. But such is not the case with the French Government, the courts under which do not allow the creditor either a rate of interest higher than 9 per cent, per annum or a period of time longer than three^ years, for which interest can be charged on any loan. The paper then refers to one case which recently came up on appeal before the Patna High Court. In this case a money-lender sued his debtor for an amount of interest which was ou of all proportion to the principal and the rate of which, in the words of the Barrister defending the debtor, was 1,500 per cent. However the money- lender got his decree according to the terms of the bond and the Court could not help him in any way. The paper remarks in conclusion that although various Acts are passed every year by the authorities, it is strange that nobody pays any attention to this most important and necessary item of legislation, viz., an act to govern the business of money-lending. Asha, July 10, 1916. Oriya member for the Council wanted. 21. The Asha (Berhampore) in a long article expresses much pleasure at the nomination of Mr. M. S. Das, c.i.e., Madras Legislative ^ a 0 f the Legislative Council of Bihar and Orissa and hopes that under his leadership the new members will bring before the Council various pro posals beneficial to the interests of Orissa. The paper, at the same time, expresses regret observing that there is little chance of an Oriya member being nominated this year to the Legislative Council of the Government of Madras, and in that case 15 lakhs of Oriyas inhabiting the Province will have to remain unrepresented in the Legislative Council of their own Province. The paper admits that the Madras Government kindly nominated on two succes sive occasions the Raja of Dharakote to the Council and entertains doubts whether he can be nominated again for the third time. It, however, hopes % that the Government will not choose a person like the zamindar of Saloor to represent the Oriya interest and suggests the names of Babu Harihar Panda of Asha and Sri Biravikram Deb Varma of Vizagapatam. Sambad- bahika, June 29, 1916, 22. The Samhadhahika (Balasore) writes that the unrest in India led the Germans to believe that England would India and the war. ^ i nvo } ve( j i n Indian affairs in case of declaration of a war in Europe. But very trifling was the result. The hopes of Germany were frustrated when out of a population of 320 millions only a microscopic few showed some inimical feeling towards the established Govern ment. Thus India instead of being a source of anxiety to the Crown becomes a substantial source of help in times of need.Purulia Dat'pan, July 17, 1916. Pataliputra, Joly 15, .1916.

Learning from a letter that a contract for the supply of articles to why is it so? th. 6 Patna High Court has been made with a Chinese Company and not with a Bihari one, the Patalifutra (Bankipore) asks, “ Why is it so ? Was there no tender from any Bihari Company ?. 5 - 17. Referring to the news published in the Times of London that Lord Lord Crewe Crewe will again be appointed as Secre tary of State for India, the Patalifutra (Bankipore) writes ; “ He is an eminent politician with his experience about India which he has gained during his visit, in company with His Majesty the Emperor, to this country. The Indians entertain great hopes of good at his hands when he takes charge of this office.’ 5 - 18. Giving the summary of an interview between Sir Pratap Singh of Idar and the representative of the Heroic words of brave Pratap. &lt; New Y ork-Sun” the PatalifUtm (Banki - pore) observes: “The words of Sir Pratap Singh are literally true. It is nothing but bare truth that there is no anarchism in India. It may be that there are some discontented men, but what can they do ?” 19. The Patalifutra (Bankipore) observes to the following effect on the The rebellion of the Arabs and the Musal- marginally noted Subject 1 It Was mans. published in the last week that the Grand Sherif of Mecca has declared his independence against the Sultan of Turkey. We cannot help laughing at the discontent of the Musalmans of Lucknow, when the Moslems of Egypt, Meospotamia, etc., have expressed their sympathy with the Sherif. The Musalmans living near Mecca and Medina are in close touch with the present circumstances, therefore, they have been glad to have thrown the yoke of the Sultan. But the Musalmans of India have shed tears at the independence of the Arabs, because they are very far from the real scene. The Moslem League of Lucknow has gone so far as to say that those who have sympathy with the Sherif are enemies to Islam. In our opinion they have not properly considered the problem before giving publicity to their views. It has agitated the mind of the Moslems at large. The Mu hammadans have pointed out that one of tne reasons of tneir objections is that this behaviour of the Sherif will spoil the sanctity of Hedjaz and the pilgrims wil be put to great difficulties there. This objection of the Musal- mans is met by the words of Lord Crewe. He has said that the pilgrims of Hediaz will now enjoy more convenience. The Ulama of the mosque of Al-Azher in Egypt join with their disciples in supporting the words of Lord Crewe. It was heard some time ago that the young Turks have no such faith in Islam. They insulted Sheikh-ul-Islam and wanted to proclaim Jehad taking the side of the Kaiser. Under these circumstances, the protest of the Moslem League against the action of the Sherif is not justifiable. The En qlishman writes that many Arabs were shot dead by Enver Pasha at Mecca. This rebellion is due to this cause. If the Sherif would not have sided with the rebels, the matter would have ended in something very serious. The Moslems live in perfect peace and harmony under the British rule, still they lavish praises upon the Sultan, the enemy of the English. The independence of the Sherif is advantageous to the British Government. Iherefore it is not the time to protest against this action. The leaders of the League will re consider the matter because this is an intricate question. Then they will come to be sure of their mistake.”173 10 The Tirhut Samachar (Muzaffarpur) writes to say that the local District Board could so long maintain j„i y 20 , -The number of Middle Vernacular Schools.

The Mithila Mihir (Darbhanga) observes to the following effect in its leader Most of the Indians have The share of the Indians in the war. ^ becom ^ timid g radua ll y . The causes that are bringing about such changes in their nature are either their peaceful living under the British rule or the rigour of the Arms Act. How ever, almost all the races of the world which have any connection with Europe are ready to help their party in this terrible war. The Indians too who have forgotten their military tactics are ready to.be enlisted in the army. They are not only ready but are anxious to be allowed to figlit for the cause of their Emperor like their English brethren and show their unflinching loyalty. Mr. Churchill too said the other day in the H6use of Commons that Indians should be enlisted in numbers in 1917. The Times of London concurring with Mr. Churchill has remarked that the regiments of such Indians as are sincerely anxious to join the flag should be formed. What a sad contrast there is between the aforesaid opinion of the English politicians and the orders of the Government of India to disband the Volunteers of the Bengal Ambulance Corps! They were soon to start for the field. Their vigour and energy have been nipped in the bud. The consequence thereof will not be beneficial to the country. After the above was in the Press we learnt from the £ Associated Press .Service ’ that the final decision of the India Government in this connection is still pending. We have full confidence that the India Government will give out their final decision after due consideration of this matter so that it may not furnish an occasion for agitation and spread dissatisfaction among the public/’ Mithila Mihir, July 15, 1916.k - S’ [This Docamant is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Go vernment. n -*%A iiTiTTrj in x ji.it _ 1 _ ' 11 ' ( / N 'S and should be returned to the Foreign Office when done with unless required for official use^- x / V EGWT i i O Decypher of telegram Iran&gt;Dir H.Madahon (Kamieh).
