                           Larkins,that he has ascertained from Shaik Abdool Russool Khan [Shaikh ‘Abd al-Rasūl Khān], Governor of Bushire, the custom of the port regarding the imposition of duties on goods which are to be reshipped from Bushire. Riach reports that the Governor has stated that an arrangement might have been made with the Custom Master prior to the landing of the goods, which would have made the remaining unsold goods exempt from the usual import duty. However, the Governor is said to have stated that, as no such arrangement was made, the reshipped goods cannot be made exempt.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054395.0x00001a#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
