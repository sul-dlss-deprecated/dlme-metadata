No. 021-3-1 (G.S.)., dated Quetta, the 8th March 1919. From—The General Officer Com naading, 4th (Quetta) Division, To—Tiie Chief of the General Staff, Army Head Quarters, Delhi. With reference to your telegram No. 6307-M.O.L, dated the 24th January 1919, I have the honour to forward this my despatch on the East Persian Line of Communications from the 1st April 1918 to the 15th January 1919. My report covers two periods; the first from 1st April to 21st September 1918, during which time the East Persian Cordon from railhead onwards was under the command of Brigadier-General G. A. Dale, C.M.G., and the second from 22nd Sep tember 1918 to 15th January 1919, when the East Persian Line of Communica tions was under my command. Regarding the first period I propose giving you a brief summary of the Eastern Persian Cordon as I took it over from Brigadier-General Dale together, with infor mation he has furnished me with regarding this part of the year. I will go into fuller detail regarding the second period, and on the work of the Administration of x . the Line of Communications under my command as you direct. 1. Topography .—It would be as well first briefly to outline the features of the country through which the Line of Communication runs. The Eastern Persian Line of Communication may, as regards topographical conditions, be divided into 4 Sections, viz .— (a) Nushki to railhead at Juzzak or Duzdap. (b) Railhead to Shusp. (c) Shusp to Meshed. (d) Meshed to Askabad. The first section lies in the Chagai District of British Baluchistan, which is practically desert country about 2,000 feet above the sea level. No great difficulty has been found in constructing the extension of the railway to Juzzak and thence to Duzdap, where railhead has just been established. Nushki is the nearest point on the railway to the Afghan Border; hence a garrison is necessary here to check raiding parties from Afghanistan, who have essayed to foray the railway in this vicinity. From railhead to Shusp the Line of Communications ’ road passes through fairly mountainous country for the first 35 miles; thence through stony desert country until the neighbourhood of Neh is reached. The principal topographical feature of this section is the Palan Koh Mountain Range which runs parallel to the Line of Communications. This range has of old been a hiding place for robber bands and necessitates a garrison being kept at Dehan-i-Baghi to prevent raids on this section of the Line of Communications. The climate of this section is bad ; the heat is very trying in the summer and the North-West winds that blow for 120 days every spring with extraordinary uni formity create perpetual sand-storms and cause great discomfort. There is little shade in this section of the Line of Communications and water is none too plentiful and generally brackish. Rain seldom falls between April and October; hence, in summer, the dust is very bad. From Shusp to Meshed the Line of Communications runs through undulating mountainous country which is generally, beyond Kain, fertile and well watered. Between Birjandand Kain the road crosses the Samand-i-Shah Pass, 6,930 feet, and between Kain and Turbat-i-Haidari two other passes of about 6,500 feet are traversed. Two more passes have to be negotiated between Turbat-i-Haidari and Meshed as the road crosses the mountain range of Kuh Bakhar. These last passes are narrow and rocky but have been improved and are fit for motor traffic now except when the weather is very wet C26GS-B2 Up to November 1918 an alternative route to Meshed from Kain through Rui Khaf was used, but since the shorter road through Turbat-i-Haidari was made fit for motor transport this alternative route has been abandoned. The climate of this section is good. The last section between Meshed and Askabad has only been under my com- mknd since December, since when the road has been under snow. Except in very bad weather this road is good and it is fit for motor traffic. It runs between two mountain ranges of 9,000 feet to 11,000 feet in height. Up to Kuchan the road is practically level and runs through well-watered and cultivated country. The road between Kuchan and Askabad runs through diffi cult mountainous country. The two rivers Atrak and Duringar crossed by the road are both fordable. The climate of this section of the Line of Communications is good. Full details regarding the roads are shown in General Dickson’s Report, Appendix 5, Chapter VI. 2. East Persian Cordon. —d he Eastern Persian Cordon Field Force, m April 1918, was stretched out between Saindak and Meshed with the object of preventing enemy agents from getting access into Afghanistan and India. The Russians in North Persia were, owing to the upheaval of Russia, fast disappearing northwards and it had become necessary to maintain a larger garrison in Meshed to uphold British policy in that area. hrom April onwards the military centre of gravity shifted still farther north into Irans-Caspia, and General Malleson was given a not inconsiderable portion of the Cordon troops into his command, so that he could assert the necessary British influence on Transcaspian politics. In June 1918 a force under Captain Kreyer had to resort to open hostilities against hostile raiders at Fareh, a full report of which has been rendered to the Commander-in-Chief by Rfigadier-General Dale. In August General Malleson’s troops for the first time engaged the Bolsheviks. It was recognized that our then small forces in Transcaspia would have to be largely augmented, and this gave birth to the present Line of Communications whjch came under my orders on the 22nd September 1918. Before I assumed command, the Eastern Persian Cordon Field Force troops were distributed as shown in detail on Map 1,* Appendix 1, amounting to 1 coin- 19th Punjabis, and 1 squadron 28th Light Cavalry (the Headquarters and remainder of both these units being under General Malleson, North of Meshed), the 98th Infantry (6 companies) and 2 squadrons of the 41st Cavalry. 3. The 'present Line of Communications. —On the 21st September orders were issued by you to the effect that the whole of the forces in East Persia would be under my command, with the exception of Malleson’s Mission which was to remain directly under the Commander-in-Chief. To assist me in this, Lieutenant-Colonel H. W. Jackson, D.S.O., 89th Punjabis, was appointed Brigadier-General in charge administration, Brigadier-General AV. E. R. Dickson, C.I.E., R.E., was appointed Inspector General of Communications for administrative control of communica tions beyond railhead, and Brigadier-General Dale, C.M.G., late Commander of the Eastern Persian Co don, Defence Commander of the Line of Communications. My control extended to Meshed inclusive for administration and defence. The soldiers under General Malleson were now put under the command of Brigadier-General Beatty, D.S.O., who would act under General Malleson. The latter officer was responsible for the policy of the Government of India in direct communication with Army Head Quarters. It was ordered,_ too, that I was to secure the maintenance of General Beatty’s force through the Line of Communications. The headquarters and remaining squadrons of the 41st Cavalry and the 42nd Cavalry were mobilized in October 1918 with a view to their moving up to Meshed to join General Beatty’s contingent. * N Q t reproduced.I inspected'these regiments at Baleli just before they were to have proceeded to Persia. The armistice on the Western Front, however, was signed shortly after this, altering thereby our policy in Persia. As, therefore, there was no urgent necessity to increase the number of our troops in Persia, orders were received on 11th Novem ber to cancel the move of these two regiments to Meshed. The force to be main tained, at or beyond Meshed, under General. Beatty ’s command, was to be one battery, one battalion of British Infantry and one section machine gun company, detached from the North Persia Force, and one battalion and onr cavalry regiment from India. At the beginning of December 1918 General Beatty represented that his force should be self-contained and requested permission to move two troops of the 28th Light Cavalry engaged on defence work, on the Line of Communications at Turbat- j-Haidari, to join the headquarters of that' egiment. Sanction was given for this and that they should be replaced by two troops of the 41st Cavalry at Khwash, whose place was filled by two other troops of the same unit from Sibi. General Beatty urged at the same time that he should be reinforced by a Brigade Signal Tr.oop, Field Troop, one Machine Gun Squadron, a Field Battery and that the 2 , 8 th Light Cavalry be armed with bayonets and their complement of Hotchkiss guns increased to 16. The Signal Troop was sent up to his force in December and it was decided that the remaining units were to follow should circumstances demand his being rein forced to this extent. The extra ordnance for the 28th Light Cavalry was sent up tnGeneral Beatty in December, and at this time sanction was also given for the 41st Cava’ry to he armed with Hotchkiss guns at a scale of 16 per : egiment. The actual distribution and location of the Line of Communicafon Defence Troops on 15th January 1919 are shown on Map 2,* Appendix 2. 4. Railway Defence Troops.—The railway defence troops in September con sisted of two companies, 120th Infantry, and 1 troop of the Alwar Lancers. In November 1918 the Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan concurre l in my decision to reduce the gams &gt;n in the Nushki Area and I recalled the troop of cavalry there and redistributed the infantry garrisons. At the same time, i.e., after the signing of the armistice, I had asked the Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan if he would agree to my reducing the garrison of Khwash. This post is not in the Line of Communica tions area, although then placed under the orders of the Inspector General of Commun'cations, and is held by a garrison of two troops and 1. ompany infantry. The Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor General in Baluchistan would not however agree to this as Khwash dominates the routes from the anti-British towns of Bam and Bampui in South Persia towards the railhead and the L ne of Communications. Sanction was however given me to transfer this garrison from the Line of Com munications defence troops to railhead defence troops, which I accordingly did on 21st December. The distribution of railway defence troops includes the safeguarding of Duzdap, the present railhead and is shown in detail on Map 2,* Appendix 2. 5. Work on the Railway—l attach a report by Colonel F.W. Allum, Engineer- in-Chief of the Nushki Extension Bailway, on the work done by him during tbe period reviewed, Appendix 3. Closely in connection with this work was the railway survey work carried out by Major L. E. Hopkins, D.S.O., B.E., whose report I attach in Appendix 4. 6. Financial Problems.—The great shortage of Persian coin in the Imperial Bank of Persia began to be seriously felt on the East Persian Line of Communica tions shortly after I assumed command, and it became difficult to meet payments for hired transport and supplies purchased locally. On the 14th November I forwarded to General Dickson 15 lakhs of rupees which had been sent me by Army Headquarters. •Not re pro duced.4 These proved of the greatest value in keeping up British credit in Persia, although the British Consul at Meshed, at first, rather viewed with alarm the importation of rupees into his sphere of influence. On the 27th November 10 more lakhs were sent to me as a reserve to be trans mitted to Persia only under the direct orders from Army Headquarters. This sum was subsequently found not required and removed from my care. By the beginning of December a complete understanding had been arrived at between the Government of India and the Imperial Bank of Persia at Tehran, who instructed its branches to meet the demands for military requirements made on it by the Inspector General of Communications and General Malleson. The financial difficulties have therefore been satisfactorily solved. Chapter VIII of General Dickson’s report, Appendix 5, gives full details of the financial problem and the difficulties he has had to contend with regarding cash payments. 7. Administration. —The Line of Communications was divided into two parts, viz., the :ail line of Communication from Nushki to railhead, directly adminis tered by me, and the road Line of Communications from railhead to Meshed and Askabad under an Inspector General of Communications, who organised and administered this portion of the Line of Communications under my orders. 8. Eastern Persian Cordon Administration. —Previous to my assuming com mand, the Eastern Persian Cordon had been' administered by a General Officer Commanding who was responsible both for the operations and administration to His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief in India, indenting on the 4th (Quetta) Division for all supplies required, which were delivered at railhead. At the time of the reorganisation of the Eastern Persian Cordon the troops and transport under the General Officer Commanding the Cordon were British officers , • 44 British other ranks # 9 CO Indian troops and followers « • 3,256 Horses * • • # 500 Ponies , • 36 Mules • • • # 140 Donkeys .. , • , # 100 Government camels % 0 1,878 Hired camels • • 666 Levy rid’ng camels • • .. .. 85 The Administrative staff and services for the Eastern Persian Cordon consisted of— 1 Staff Captain. 1 A. D. S. and T. {en route from India). 1 D. A. D. S, and T. 1 D. A. D. S. and T. (for local purchase en route up Line of Communications). 1 D. A. D. M. S. 1 A. D. P. and T. The supply was organised on a system of local purchase, and transport was locally hired, supplemented in each case by supplies and transport despatched from India. 9. Line of Communications Administration. —On reorganisation instructions were received to prepare for a force in East Persia consisting of one division with a brigade of artillery and one brigade of cavalry at or beyond Meshed, and for the troops being increased to one brigade of cavalry and one brigade of infantry beyond railhead on the Line of Communications.5 The Administrative Staff allotted to carry out this programme was as follows :— At Divisional Headquarters :— 1 Brigadier-General in charge Administration. 1 D. A. A. G. Base (Base Commandant graded as Staff Captain). * With Inspector-General of Communications, East Persia Line of Communica tion :— A. Q. .M. G. Staff Captain. With General Officer Commanding Line of Communication Area East Persia :— D. A. A. and Q. M. G. The Administrative Services and Departments were organised as follows :— With Inspector-General of Communications East-Persia :— A. D. S. and T. D. A. D. S. T. D. A. D. S. T. (Local Purchases). D. A. D. S. T. (Local Resources). D. A. D. T. M. T. A. D. M. S. D. A. D. M. S. D. A. D. M. S. (Sanitary). D. A. D. 0. S. D. A. D. V. S. A. D. Works. A. D. P. and T. Chaplain. The rail Line of Communication from Nushki to Juzzak, directly under me, was administered by an Administrative Commandant assisted by— S. M, 0. D. A. D. S. and T. (0. C. “ G ” Supply Depot Company). R. T. 0. at Nushki (appointed on the 16th January 1919). 10. Tasks required. —The problem to be dealt with by the Inspector-General of Communications was as under :— (i) Maintenance of Line of Communication units including transport. (ii) Maintenance of Line of Communication defence troops. (in) Provision for occasional movement of troops on Line of Communica tions and also for stores and personnel for improving roads and for the general organisation of the line. (w) Collecting one month’s reserve of supplies of all natures at Meshed for the force at and beyond Meshed. (v) Collecting one month’s reserve for troops on the Line of Communications. (vi) Collecting supplies for the passage on the Line of Communications of the additional troops referred to in paragraph 9. C26GSB6 Arrangements were mp&lt;de for collecting one montli s reserves at railhead for the whole force beyond railhead, and one month’s reserves at Quetta for the whole force beyond the base, Quetta. 11. The road Line of Communications. —The road Line of Communications consisted of 670 miles from railhead to Meshed, plus another 150 miles from there to Askabad. The whole consisted in its original state of a rough Persian track passing over desert plains or through mountainous regions. In places, over the desert wastes, it was passable in its original condition, though only with difficulty, by motor cars ; through the mountain passes, and especially in the northern portion between Turbat and Meshed, the road was in places very difficult and quite impass able by any form of mechanically driven vehicle. For a detailed account of the successive steps taken, to bi ing this track into a condition fit for light mechanical transport vehicles, see chapter 6 of the Inspector- General of Communications’ report attached (Appendix 5). 12. Supply Areas. —The fertile areas in the region dealt with, the nature of the supplies to be obtained therefrom, and the manner in which back-loading can be made use of to bring these supplies on the Line of Communication are shown diagram- matically in Plan “ A ” attached to the Inspector-General of Communications’ report. 13. Transport. —The transport available consisted of portions of 6 Government Camel Corps amounting to 33 troops in all, one Ford Van Company, plus a section of Ford Vans originally destined for South Persia, and a Pony Draught Corps. Local transport available consisted, in the southern area, of hired Baluchistan and Ghilzai camels ; in Sistan, of donkeys; in the Birjaiid area, of camels: and, in the northern area, of a very good type of local camel, hairy and suited to stand the cold, donkeys, fourgons, (r.e., vehicles capable of carrying nearly a ton and drawn by four horses abreast), and smaller forms of animal-drawn vehicles. The respective merits of these various kinds of transport are dealt with in detail in paragraphs 56 and 60 of the Inspector-General of Communications’ report. The transport i equired to fulfil the programme laid down in paragraph 10 above involved the collection of about 20,000 hired camels in addition to the Government pack and mechanical transport available. To effect this, a scheme was evolved to employ Ghilzai camels which come into India from Afghanistan dm ing the cold weather. It was decided to hire the camels with their owners and attendants for the cold weather, and, in the meantime, to endeavour to enlist sarwans, so that when the Ghilzais returned to their homes in the spr ing, their camels could be purchased and formed into a Camel Corps, with the newly enlisted sarwans. At the same time, in order to replace wastage in the Government Camel Corps, a scheme for the purchasing of a reserve of camels was framed. It was very im portant to avoid purchasing and hiring from the same sources, and it was therefore decided to restrict purchasing in Sind and to carry out hiring in the Baluchistan and Dera Ismail Khan areas. These schemes were carried out with the assistance of the political authorities in Baluchistan and of the Commissioner in Sind. 14. Influenza. —The severe incidence of the influenza epidemic added greatly to the difficulty of our hiring operations, inasmuch as it delayed the influx of the Kafilas from Afghanistan and seriously aflected the Ghilzais after their arrival. 15. Trade. —The problem of transport on the Line of Communications was closely connected with the question of trade from the west, the importance of the Nushki Trade Boute became much increased and the profits to be made offered a very attractive field for traders. The opening of trade would undoubtedly have resulted in the withdrawal of local camels from military transport work to trade carrying which gave such lucrative results. At the same time, our investigations showed that there was barely sufficient water and grazing for the camels necessary for the Line of Communications, a situation which would have been much aggravated by the addition of large numbers of trade camels. Further the demand for trade goods would have added to the congestion on the Bolan Railway, the capacity of which was already strained to the uttermost. It was therefore necessary to close [down trade entirely, even though this measure militated against our interests in certain other ways, notably in the cash question in East Persia.7 16. Change of Scheme.- —In November 1918 orders were received to pre parations on the Line of Communication to a very much reduced scheme and nna y in December I was instructed to prepare for a total force of 1 brigade of infantry with I cavalry regiment and battery of artillery at or beyond Meshed, toget er with 6 companies infantry and 2j squadrons of cavalry on the Line of Communi cation. The total transport in terms of camels required for this force is given in Table VIII of the Inspector-General of Communications’ detailed report, involving a considerable reduction on our first estimates of additional camels required. The situation, therefore, was that I already had sufficient camels for immediate needs and I also had a large number of camels held under a biana or retaining fee pending a decision as to the ultimate strength of the force to be employed m East Persia. At the same time there was no reserve of any kind to meet unforeseen contingencies, while the trade question was becoming somewhat acute, both from a political point and from the cash currency difficulty. Two alternatives presented themselves to meet this situation, which were : (o) to re-open trade in such a manner as not to prejudice military interests on the Line of Communication ; (6) to maintain a reserve of transport to meet unforeseen contingencies. The first alternative was to arrange for a camel train to be raised from areas which were not drawn upon by the Inspector-General of Communications f or h locally hired transport, and to agree to trade being re-opened by means of this camel train only ; the whole scheme to be under the direct control of the civil authorities in Baluchistan. This scheme was discussed with the Hon ble the Agent to the Governor General and Chief Commissioner in Baluchistan, who kindly consented to allow the Political Agent, Chagai, to supervise and control the organisation and working of the scheme. It was proposed to utilise the camels as a reserve for military requiremen s- The second alternative was to place the control of trade in East Persia in the i j rvvncml Mr Gould Mr. Gould formulated a definite scheme hands of the C^ n ™^t ga fgguard all military interests, but would also bTable to hold the trade camels as a reserve for the Line of Communication m case of emergency, and, in addition, to effect the carriage of local supplies fiom Sistan to the Line of Communications. , , ,, After full consideration of these two alternatives, I decided to adopt the latter, which is now in force, ... , 17 Bail Line of Ccmmunication.-The Rail Line of Communication is organised in -one section under an Administrative Commandant, from Nushki to railhead. A railway tonsport officer is stationed at Nushki, with a railway transport serceant major at railhead. Medical arrangements are m charge of a medical officer who is directly responsible to the Deputy Dnector, Medical Servnes, of the * It has beer represented to Army Headquarters that the Medical Offic oiTthi^section shovdd be appomted Deputy Assistant Director, Medical Services, distribution. , . , The Officer Commanding “ G ” Supply Depot Company acts as Deputy Assis tant Director Supply and Transport, of this section. A supply depot has been form ed at railhead containing one month’s reserve for the troops m East Persia At NushkLthere is a mechanical transport workshop section, very well* equipped and capable of dealing with all heavy repairs which cannot be undertaken by the me nical transport workshop at Shusp. . . The working of this section of the Line of Communication has been very satisfactory and § the traffic arrangements under Colonel Allum have met all leqU SS arrangements have been made for the inspection at Sibi of all details proceeding to East Persia direct from India, so that deficiencies m 'arm clot ling or otherTquipment can be made good. The supply depot at Sibi is able to meet emergent requirements for rations. Owing to the heavy gradients on the Bolan-Nushki Line, trams are, at times divided into sections and arrangements have, therefore, to be made to ensure that bodies of troops are not separated from their rations and tentage.Temporary barracks for troops bave been constructed at Nuskhi and Dal- bandin. A tea shop has been opened at Dalbandin under private contract, and a Monro Canteen has been opened at railhead. Attached to this canteen, but under separate management, is a store for which supplies in bulk are being obtained from the E. F. C., Bombay. 18. Re-organisaiion of Line of Communication. —The road Line of Communi cation, on re-organisation, was divided into four sections, each under an Adminis trative Commandant, who was assisted by a Transport Officer and a Supply Officer in each section. On the extension of the Line of Communication from Meshed to Askabad, the Line of Communication was again re-organised, into seven sections, which will be reduced to six sections when the railhead reaches Duzdap. A full description of the organisation of these sections is given in the Inspector- General of Communications’ report attached. A financial statement is also given in Chapter VIII of that report. 19. Capacity of Railway. —A serious consideration in connection with the Line of Communication is the capacity of the railway lines from Sibi to Quetta, which form a bottle-neck through which everything must pass. Quetta itself is almost entirely dependent on imports and these, for the large garrison and growing civil population, together with the needs of the outposts, constitute a heavy demand on the capacity of the railway. Railway maintenance both for the Bolan and Harnai routes, the Spezand-Nnshki section, the Chaman section, and both construction and maintenance for the Nuskhi Extension Railway, have to be taken into consideration. The ordinary food supply, together with the coal and wood for the winter, mobilization reserves, transport for a very large number of camels for the East Persian Cordon, materials for the temporary build ings, the import of labour and the carriage of trade goods, both to Nuskhi and Chaman, all formed problems of railway transportation not easy to solve. On the Bolan Line, by which most of the traffic is carried, the capacity is about 150 vehicles a day. As a result of the congestion caused by somewhat indiscriminate booking to Quetta, there has been at times a shortage of fuel, oil and flour during the winter. To remedy this as far as was possible, I obtained permission from Army Headquarters to restrict all booking to Quetta to priority certificates issued by the civil and military authorities in Quetta. A traffic control board was formed under myself as President, which met weekly and allotted the available truckage to the most urgent needs of the moment. This resulted in an economical utilisa tion of the truckage available, and, at the same time, obviated hundreds of trucks being detained in the Sukkur section, awaiting onward despatch to Quetta and blocking essential requirements urgently needed. I wish to bring to notice the importance of providing more engine power both on the Bolan and Harnai Lines and on the Spezand-Nushki section, by which alone a greater capacity can be obtained. I wish also to express my great appreciation of assistance rendered to to me by the North-Western Railway and in particular by Mr. Young, the local District Traffic Superintendent. 20. Supplies—Rail Line of Communication. —At the beginning of April the portion of the Line of Communication under the Officer Commanding, “ G ” Supply Depot Company, ran from Nushki to Saindak. This consisted of two sections :— Rail Line of Communication . —Nushki to Dalbandin (Railhead Supply Depot);- Road Line of Commumm^ow.—Dalbandin to Saindak (Advance Supply Depot); the whole being under Major J. Morris, Supply -and Transport Corps, as Officer in charge Supply Depots Line of Communication at Dalbandin. Depots. —Were maintained at Nushki, Dalbandin, Nok Kundi and Saindak. Reserves. — At Quetta 45 days for the whole force. At Nushki and Nok Kundi 30 days for the troops, etc., dependent on them. At Dalbandin 45 days for the whole force ahead of that. At Saindak there was always 30 days for the whole force in course of transit.9 Scale of Rations. British Troops. —Drew ration money at Rs. 2 per day in lieu of rations. Indian Troops. —According to Quartermaster-General in India’s No. 14876 dated 4th October 1917. Source of Supply. —Ration articles and grain by demands on Karachi; thence by rail direct to railhead. Fodder from Quetta, which supplied bhoosa white, and Meerut, which supplied bhoosa missa direct to rail head. Tonnage handled—about 2000 tons. Establishments. —During this period the depots on the Line of Communication were understaffed, consisting of only 1 supply sepot section plus such extra supply depot, tally and workshop establishments as could be spared from Quetta. In July 1918, the railway became open for traffic up to Juzzak and the rail head supply depot was then moved up to that place. Towards the end of that month also, the General Officer Commanding, East Persian Cordon, took over all Line of Communication west of railhead, enabling Saindak Supply Depot to be closed down, the stores from which were cleared into Robat. In the meantime, also, the depots at Nushki and Nok Kundi had been closed, all posts on the Line of Communication being rationed from the supply depot at Dalbandin, under an improvised brigade supply establishment. In September this depot was closed also, post reserves being maintained at Nuskhi and Dalbandin and rations being sent from railhead by returning empty wagons. An ordnance depot was established at Juzzak in September 1918 which handled all ordnance and clothing supplies, thus relieving the railhead supply depot of the same. In September 1918, the source of supply was changed, demands being preferred on the Deputy Director of Stocks, Simla, except for medical comforts, grains and fodder, which continued to be supplied as before. Tonnage greatly increased owing to the increase of the force and especially ot the transport with the same. Establishments. —About September demands for increased personnel were preferred and in consequence :—- No. 199 Supply Depot Section arrived at railhead 13th October 1918. No. 75 Brigade Supply Section arrived at railhead, 20th October 1918. No. 27 Supply Workshop Sfection, arrived at railhead 29th November 1918, and lately 1 bakery and 1 butchery section have arrived also-. j j Summary of Administration. —Of the Supply Services at the close of the period under re eiew:— , .

Road Line of CommMmcoiion.—From the 1st April 1918, the strength of the force gradually increased and the. line held from time to time lengthened. It soon became apparent that the organisation and numbers of the Supply and Transport Services, which had hitherto been deemed suffiment to cope with the needs of the troops located on the line, no longer sufficed.^ Eventually, in September 1918, a Supply and Transport Corps Directorate with Lieutenant Colonel M. Synge as Assistant Director of Supply and Transpo , was allotted to the force. The increased efficiency consequent on this appointment was quickly evident and at the present time the troops located on this line are, I think, as well cared for as those serving with any other force operating in eastern theatres of war. Scale of Raticms .—The British Troops up to within the last few months were allowed Rs 2 per diem in lieu of rations, but, as there are now sufficient stocks of rations available, this allowance has been withdrawn and rations are issued, m kind, in accordance with the authorised scale in Army Department letter No. 14876 dated 4th October 1917. For some time, uncertainty existed as to whether the scale of rations pro- ' mul^ated in the above quoted Army Department letter applied to the force m East Persia, but the ruling received under Chief of the General Staff s telegram No. 6630-3, dated 19th November 1918, settled the question. While British Troops were in receipt of the Rs. 2 per diem all reinforcements passing through Quetta were allowed to draw on payment a three-months supply of rations, excluding fuel. At the present time, all details, troops and animals,_ proceeding to East Persia take with them 14 days’ rations except firewood, of which 3 days are^taken. In the case of large reinforcements, of the strength of a squadron, company or over, 30 days’ are taken. The question of the suppply of fresh vegetables has always been a source of anxietv but it is partially alleviated by the periodical despatch of consignments of potatoes and onions in specially devised crates A quantity of vegetable seeds were sent up in June last, and a garden was started at Shusp, vuth a skilled Enghs hardener in charge. The benefit to be derived from the adoption of this measure should be evident during the coming hot season. However, m such an and and sterile country the question of the provision of vegetables for the troops stationed there will need constant and careful forethought. Bakery and Butchery Section.—Bakery and Butchery Sections have been sent out These are split up into sub-sections along the line and are, m fulfilling their functions, adding their quota to the well-being and comfort of the British sokaer. The scale of Indian Troops rations is based on a generous scale and should, m my opinion, leave little cause foi complaint. i - Estimates of requirements.-In the earliest portion of the period under review the requirements of the force were legislated for as follows ^-Deputy Assistant Director of Supply and Transport, Birjand, submitted periodically his requirements in the case of rations, petrol, etc., monthly and quarterly m the case of clothing, equipment; etc., to my Assistant Director of Supply and Trans^ collected in his office and passed to the Officer Commanding G Supply Depot Company for compliance. On receipt of Quarter Master General s No. &gt; 1852-36 Q.M.G.-6), dated 15th June 1918, wherein the Officer Commanding G SupplyDepot Company was appointed Assistant Director of Supply and Transport Line of Communication, this procedure was altered and the estimates are now submitted to the depot company direct and the officer commanding arranges despatches accordingly. Reinforcement of Supply and Transport Personnel.—The Assistant Director of Supply and Transport East Persia now communicates his requirements to me. The demands are then passed on to Army Headquarters for compliance from various divisions in India. A detailed description of the supply arrangements on the road Line of Com munication is given in the Inspector General of Communications report attached. 22. Transport with the Eastern Persian Cordon — Camels. From 1st April 1918 to 15th January 1919 :— (i) Owing to the barren nature of the country in East Persia and along the Sistan trade route, which comprises the road Luxe of Communica tion of the Eastern Persian Cordon, the mam type of transport which has had to be used is the camel, supplemented, where possible, by mechanical transport. During the period under review, the number of camels employed has been gradually mcreased, while the mechanical transport service has been reinforced by the introduction of Ford vans and light lorries. (ii) It was found that the number of Government Camel Corps available was inadequate to meet the demand of the long stretch of country over which the force operating in East Persia was situated. (Hi) There were at this time the following Government Camel Corps employed either in East Persia or on the Line of Communication 72nd Hired Camel Corps. 54th Silladar Camel Corps. 1st Troop, 56th Silladar Camel Corps. 61st Grantee Camel Corps. 2nd Government Camel Corps 65tli Government Camel Corps 55th Silladar Camel Corps .. 5 Troops, 60th Grantee Government Camel Corps. (During the operations in the Marri Country, the 54th Silladar Camel Corps was drawn on to meet requirements. At the conclusion of host! ities there, the balance of the 54th Corps was brought from Dalbandm and the whole corps was put to graze in theLoralai District.) (iv) In addition to Government Corps, the following irregular transport was employed :— - . (d) Hired camels about 700. (h) Maundage camels, from 600 to 2000— Both (a) and (h) were working entirely on the Line of Communica tion. (a) Ghilzai camels hired on a fixed rate of hire per in addition to free rations for men and animals. As it had been found that the indiscriminate payment of compensation to owners of hired camels led to fraudulent practices, the terms given at this time included a graduated scale of compensation, an owner only becoming eligible for compensation on the lowest scale after 3 months'work, and increasing only to the highest rate after 6 months’ work. The General Officer Commanding Eastern Persian Cordon in addition to the Government Camel Corps placed at his disposal, employed 750 camels which had been engaged m the Kalat District by Mir Rahimdad Khan. These also worked on the hired system. („) Thus there were employed either on the Line of Communication or in East Persia a total of:— ill Government Camel, .. ...5,480 ExeludingoithMalar Camel Corps. (2) Hired Camels ... i - .1.450 700 Ghilzai Camel, 750 Kalat Camel. ,( 3 ) Maundage Camels ., •• 8 ®® Average.12 Amongst (1) the effective number was about 4300-4400. The difference between the full and effective strength was due to saddle galls contagious diseases (such as mange and jhooling) and surra. With regard to (2) only the 750 Kalat Camels were continuously employed as the Ghilzais will not stay on the lower levels after May, their cus tom being to migrate to the higher altitudes north of Quetta. In regard to (3) these were from time to time increased as the demands of the Eastern Persian Cordon increased. (vi) In July 1918, orders were received to reinforce the Government Trans- port with the Eastern Persian Cordon by 4 troops of the 54th Silladar Camel Corps then grazing near Loralai. These entiained at Harnai on the 26th July 1918 and proceeded to join the Eastern Persian Cordon On arrival in the Eastern Persian Cordon Area it was tound that a very large number of these camels were surra-infected. (vn) In September 1918, orders were received to move the remaining 4 troons of the 54th Camel Corps from Loralai for service in East PeSia Pre cautions were however taken to prevent taking more surra* cases into that territory, and this last detachment was detained at Dal- bandin for examination and elimination of surra cases. Again a large number of cases was found. These were taken out of the corps f™m P the e reBerve^ e f tl0n . in Dalballdin ’‘te numbers being made up (mi) On tbe 24th July 1918 the General Officer Commanding Eastern r , e S1 | n . ' in * on | that he might have, at his disposal, 5 complete Camel Corps which it was proposed to distribute as follows 3J Corps actually working.

Full 4 Troops. 8 Troops. Total 12 Troops. Thus, deducting the 4 troops of the 55th Silladar Camel Corps, the General Officer Commanding, Eastern Persian Cordon, had nomimllv oo troops or 4f Camel Corps at his disposal. This number was Y con siderably below strength consequent on casualties and it was' there] fore decided to despatch the balance of the 54th Corps (see para' graph m above) and also the 61st Grantee Camel Corps retaE from the latter 306 camels which were required for duties at Nushfe!13 ice \ '4 :s« [fl Is h r i and with the railway extension party at Kundi. At the same trnie the General Officer Commanding Eastern Persian Cordon, decided 1 to return 6 troops of the 2nd Government Camel Corps to rest and recuperate at Dalbandin. ' (i$) The situation then was as follows Present (no ninally) in Eastern Persian Cor ion .. 33 Troops: Less, returned from 2nd Government Camel Corps .. 6 Troops. Total 32 Troops. Add :— \ Reinforcements, 54th Camel Corps .. 4 Troops. Reinforcement, 61st Camel Corps .» 5 Troops. 9 Troops. % 41 Troops, or 5| Camel Corps. At the same time it was decided to hand over all irregular transport hitherto working on the Line of Communication to the General Officer Com manding Eastern Persian Cordon. (c) In September 1918 when it was decided that the administration of the Eastern Persian Cordon should be under my control and an increase in the whole force operating in that region was foreshadowed, a corresponding increase in the transport became imperative. JNo further Government Camel Corps were available and attention had to be paid to other resources. These were (a) Hired camels from India. (b) Hired camels from Baluchistan. (c) Hired camels in Persia. (d) Maundage camels. Arrangements to exploit (a) were accordingly made and some ™0 GhUzai camels were hired. This number was gradually increased between beginning of October 1918 to 1st January up to over 2,000. * Under (b) are included camels raised by (i) The Politioal Agent, Chagai .. • • ' (ii) Mir Rahimdad Khan .. •• •• •• •• ^ These numbers subsequently grew to : (i) (H) Under (c) in all about 5,700 were engaged. 703 1,266 Under (d) the number grew from 2,000 to 2,523. Thus, between September 1918 and 1st Janu a ryl919, there was an increase in camel transport of 9,000 camels, and, from August 1918 to 1st January 1919, an increase of over 10,000. (xi) In addition to the above under (a) and (b) a further 2,000 camels were arranged for, but, in consequence of the altered situation m rsovem- ber and December 1918, it was decided to suspend hiring operations pending the decision of the force to be supported by this Line ot Communication. “ Biana ” or “ Earnest Money ” was paid to the owners to keep a hen on their camels. This lien expired on 1st January, and, as it was decid ed that the camels were not required, the earnest money was forfeited by Government, and the camels abandoned, C26GSB14 (xii) On the 1st January 1919 the total number of camels employed between railhead (Juzzak) and Meshed was Goverrment ea nels effective and non-effective .. .. 4,561 Irregular (includes hired and maundage): .. .. .. 11,073 The Government camels, in addition to being used for convoy work along the various sections of the Line of Communication, are also used for the convoy of troops and as second line transport, it having been found that it is essential to have disciplined Government Transport for these latter duties. (xiii) To meet casualties a reserve of camels, numbering 300, was kept at Dalbandin, and was reinforced by purchases made by the S, T. It. 0. On orders being received for this reserve to be increased to 900, the care of it was given to two modified depot units of transport formed for the purpose. This rest rve is maintained to replace wastage among the Government Camel Corps working in the Eastern Persian Cordon. This is still reinforced by purchases made by the Senior Transport Registration Officer. That officer has purchased up to the present time 896 camels, of which 657 camels have been distributed to corps in East Persia. A balance of 239 remains at Dalbandin waiting con ducting parties. Purchasing is being continued. 23. Transport with the Eastern Persian Cordon. Mechanical Transport. — {i) At the conclusion of the operations in the Marri Country, the Ford Van Com pany, which had been diverted for service there, was brought into Quetta and equipped and mobilized for service in East Persia, and on 25th May 1918 the three sections left here for East Persia. (ii) In all 135 vans were originally sent out. From a variety of causes this number quickly fell till the number of effectives was less than half. Repairs of a minor nature were carried out by the workshop staff of the company in their workshop lorries, but, in many cases, it was necessary to return the vans to Nushki mechanical transport section. It was therefore found that one Ford Van Com pany was insufficient for the work it was expected it would he able to perform. Consequently, in September, when a section of Ford Vans which had been des patched from Quetta, on 6th September 1918, for service in South Persia, arrived at railhead, orders were received to divert it for service with the Eastern Persian Cordon, (Hi) Again, in September, it was decided to increase further the mechanical transport with the Eastern Persian Cordon by a fight lorry section, consisting of 24 30-cwt. Fiat and Vulcan lorries for supply purposes, with its complement of workshop and store lorries, etc. Fiat light lorries had been in use on the Line of Communication since the inception of mechanical transport on the Nushki- Saindak route and had proved a success. (iv) In October 1918 it was decided to increase still further mechanical trans' port in East Persia and therefore No. 2 Mechanical Transport Company from Rawalpindi was ordered to mobilise for service with the Eastern Persian Cordon. The Company consisted of 72 supply lorries with workshop and store lorries- On the 21st November, however, it was decided that this company could not be economically used in East Persia and orders for its return to Rawalpindi were issued. (v) Owing to the abnormal amount of major repairs which the heavy work of East Persia entailed, a suggestion was put forward that the Nushki workshops should be moved to railhead. This however was not sanctioned. (vi) In October 1918, the Inspector General of Communications represented that owing to the long distances to be covered by the Administrative Staff on the Line of Communication the number of motor cars at his disposal was inadequate. There were :— Then at his disposal Under orders for E. P. C. .. 6 3 Total.. 9In all 34 cars were required. Thus a balance of 23 remain to be found, in addi tion to 10 motor cycles for road-making parties and engineers. Two Ford cars were also asked for by General Beatty. These last two were supplied at once and of the balance, 12 are under order. 24. Transport with the Eastern Persian Cordon, Miscellaneous Transport. —• (i) In addition to the transport enumerated above it was found that local donkeys and mules could be utilised. The former are obtainable in Sistan and Birjand and the latter in Birjand and Meshed. The numbers hired have increased from 187. donkeys and 603 mules in October 1918 to 914 donkeys and 1,623 mules on the 1st January 1919. These, with the exception of 108 donkeys which are employed in the surra-infested area in Sistan, are employed in Birjand and Meshed. (ii) In Meshed “ Fourgons ” are utilised. On the 17th November 1918 68 of these vehicles were in use with a carrying capacity of 1,488 maunds. On the 1st January 1919, 252 were employed. (Hi) In September 1918 the 63rd Draught Pony Corps was despatched. This Corps has been used between Saindak and Robat moving the supply depot from the former to the latter place. The sandy stretches between these two places proved very difficult, as the wheels of the carts sunk into the sand. _ The ponies fell out of condition, until on the 1st January there were 682 effective and 261 ineffective, while 29 had died. / 25. Royal Engineers. —The following works and repairs were carried out:— Dalhandin — (1) Water Supply. —The pipe line was extended to the camp of the Camel Corps. Improvements were also carried out to the water supply arrangements in the camp. The Karez at the head works of the water supply was cleaned. (2) Works and Repairs —• (a) Masonry walls and chappers were provided to tents occupied by by British Troops^ (h) Latrines and incinerators were built for Indian Troops. (c) Certain buildings used as a ration god own and bakery were provided with wure gauze to make them flyproof. (d) Fireplaces and pucca floors have been provided in certain rooms in the levy posts, used by the troops, to convert them into kitchens. (e) Pucca platforms for Indian Troops for washing clothes have been built* (/) A Dispensary and office have been built for the hospital. Fireplaces were also built in the infectious ward. (g) Fire places provided in the guard room. Kacha .— Hospital furniture has been, made up and despatched to the British Hospital • at Kacha. Juzzak .— (a) Materials have been despatched for latrines for British and Indian Troops. (b) A kitchen was erected for Indians. (c) Materials have been despatched for sheds for supply and transport. (d) Sandbag walls have been built around tents. (e) 200 stoves were made up in Quetta and despatched to R. T. O. Nushki. for use along the line.- Hurmuk .— 12 charpoys for the hospital were made up and despatched. Birjand .— Camp tables and chairs were supplied to the General Officer Commanding.16 Kundi .— Latrines and kitchens for Indian Troops were erected. Nushlci .— Temporary accommodation for a detachment of Indian Cavalry complete with stables, etc. Additions and improvements to the accommodation for mechanical transport section. ; A detailed description of the Royal Engineer Services on the road Line of Communication is given in chapter 6 of the Inspector General of Communications’ report. The Inspector General of Communications has been much hampered by shortage of Royal Engineer establishment. 26. Medical. — {i) The General Medical Administration of the Line of Com munication rail and road is under the Deputy Director, Medical Services, 4th (Quetta) Division. (it) The Line of Communication rail is administered by Captain Hanafin, I.M.S., as Senior Medical Officer. He has under him the following Medical Units :— C.-29 I. C. C. S. at Nushki. Stationary Hospital at Dalbandin. No. 73 I. S. S. at railhead. J No. 21 B. S. S. at railhead. J No. 35 Sanitary Section. No. 2 section A Base Depot Medical Stores at railhead. C.-ll I. F. A. at Kwash. (tit) The Line of Communication road is administered by Lieutenant-Colonel H. Boulton, I.M.S., &lt;as Assistant Director of Medical Services. He has a Deputy Assistant Director of Medical Services. (San.)., Captain H. Harold, R.A.M.C., and the following units are serving under him :— Nos. 58 and 59 Combined General Hospital. No. 21 X-Ray Section. No. 17 Combined C. C. S. No. 6 Sanitary Section. J No. 20 Sanitary Section. No. 9, (J) No. 21 and 22 B. S. S. No. 74, 110 and 111 I. S. S. No. 12 A. D. M. S.

C. and D. No. 178 I. C. F. A. | No. 20 Sanitary Section. (v) Supplies. —Medical equipment and drugs are supplied by Lahore M.S.D. to No. A 2 Base Depot Medical Stores which, in return, supplies the whole line. Departmental supplies arranged by departments concerned and sent on, to scale, a month in advance. (vi) Reinforcements. —The Medical Units are kept up to strength with sub ordinate personnel from Divisional Mobilized Field Medical Units and superior personnel from Army Headquarters. ^ v(vii) Evacuation of Sick. —This is effected on Line of Communication road in motor ambulances, when available, and camel kajawahs. On Line of Com munication rail in two ambulance coaches, British to British Station Hospital and Indian to Indian Frontier War Hospital, Quetta. (viii) Disinfection.—Oi clothing of all ranks returning vermin-infected is carried out at railhead in a Thresh disinfector. (ix) Innoculation. —As a prophylactic fox all ranks proceeding to East Persia is done for T. A. B. and Cholera. &lt;x) The length of the road Line of Communication, the severity of the climate in East Persia and the lack of suitable transport precludes the evacuation of sick and wounded until convalescent. For this reason it has been necessary to es tablish an excessive proportion of hospital accommodation in comparison to t e number of troops. A convalescent camp is being formed at bhusp, where tne climate and surroundings are on the w T hole the most favourable m this region. (xi) The health of the troops has been satisfactory. The only epidemic disease has been inffuenza. To meet this 5,000 doses of Influenza vaccine were demanded from Parel but have not yet been received. Meshed is reported as unhealthy, relapsing fever being prevalent amongst the indigenous population. As a very necessary precautionary measure the Inspector Generefl of Communications has constructed temporary accommodation for troops outside the precincts of the town both at Meshed and other towns on the Line of Communication. • 27. Veterinary.—{i) The veterinary arrangements Eastern? Persian Cordon Line of Communication have been m charge of Major Meadows, R. A. V. 9'’^ ro ^ April 1918 to January 24th 1919, when he was relieved by Major Cunningham, R. A. V. C. (ii) The Veterinary personnel consisted only of Veterinary Assistants (18) up to October, when 2 Veterinary Officers, Captain O’Gogarty and Lieutenan Beettie were sent out. H. A. D. V. S. is at headquarters, Line of Communication, 1 Veterinary Officer at railhead and 1 at Askabad. The distance covers 67 miles and is divided into 7 sections. (Hi) Vetexiraiy Assistants aie posted at various section headquarters and vuth lits ofi die Une in proportion to the animals under treatment. A 1 sick animals at each post or section headquarters are treated in one combined unit hospital and remain on the strength of the unit. (iv) About 4,500 Government and 11,000 hired camels are employed. The strcSh in horses was 500 until November, when the number was increased to 1,000 ; 1,600 mules and 900 donkeys are also in use. ]?e W cases of sickness amongst horses and mules occurred, the casualties beiry chiefly due to saddle galls and accidental causes. About 30 per cent came.s we^rS for various calses. Most of the sickness was due to short rations Is the grazing decreased and until posts were sufficiently stocked with bhoosa. There has been a certain amount of mange amongst camels but otherwise contagious disease is not prevalent. 28 Ordnance Services.—H) Prior to the formation of an Ordnance Depot at Juzzak issues were made direct to the units in the field from the Quetta Arsena . (ii) In September 1918 an Ordnance Depot was formed at Juzzak, consisting of 1 British officer! 1 warrant officer, 6 privates B A 0 C„ 2 Indian clerks and 20 lascars, witl; stores for 2 months’ requirements of the force. This establishment was subsequently increased by another warrant officer and 6 sergeants and a Deputy Assistant Director of Ordnance Supplies was appointed to the force. ^ ~ ^ £ n (Hi) Ordnance stores and clothing were despatched from Quetta as* follows . Ordnance Stores and Ammunition .. • • • • 22,000 Clothing Mds. 7,250 C26GSB18 (iv) The difficulties to be overcome were shortage of labour, and the fact that all stores and clothing had to be repacked in packages suitable for camel transport. (v) Owing to the length of the Line of Communication it has been necessary to establish small dumps of clothing at the various posts. This clothing is in charge of the Supply and Transport representatives and is accounted for by them through the Deputy Assistant Director of Ordnance Stores, Line of Com munication to the Ordnance Officer in charge railhead depot. 29. I have already had the honour to forward my recommendations for the Honours List for the Line of Communication, Eastern Persia Force, up to the 15th January 1919 and attach hereto a duplicate list of recommendations for reward. &lt;, i (Note —Maps and sketches have not been reproduced.)19 APPENDIX 3* Report on the working of the Nushki Extension Railway from 1st April 1918 to 15th January 1919. (The mileages in this report are counted from Dalhandin, which is 198 miles from Spezand.) (1) Between 1st April and 25th May 1918 the line was extended from mile 137 * 72 to Juzzakmile 177‘5 and Juzzak station was opened to military tramc on 1st June 1918. By the 15th June 1918 the main line was extended from mile 174 k o on the mainline to mile 179-9, which remained the railhead until 12th September 1918, when the extension to Duzdap was taken m hand, ^ome time was necessarily required for laying the extensive yard at Mirjawa (mile 189_ 8) and a start from Mirjawa was not made till the 2nd November 1918. On January 15th railhead was at mile 226*8, i.e., 16-1 miles from Duzdap. (2) The work of the season was greatly delayed— (i) by the late arrival of railway construction companies for plate-laying, one reaching railhead on 5th November 1918 and the other on 19th November 1918, (ii) and still more so, by the serious epidemic of influenza which delayed the influx of Afghan labour for more than six weeks. (3) Military traffic during the period was carried as far as Juzzak only and to the following extent:— April 1918 May 1918 June 1918 July 1918 August 1918 September 1918 October 1918 November 1918 December 1918 January 1919 1st to 15th Vehicles 274 192 371 647 1,012 466 1,049 891 893 663 Nuskhi to Dalbandin. } l From Nuskhi and Dalbandin. Nushki to Juzzak. (4) During the dry season from April to November there were no breaches on the extension and traffic was not interrupted for more than a few hours during sandstorms. During December rain fell and breaches occurred between Daibandm and Kundi which caused a cessation of traffic for 24 hours. (5) There have been no serious accidents during the period under review. The section of the extension between Nushki and Dalbandin may be regarded as practically permanently completed though new works, especially at Ahmedwal, are still in hand, The bulk of the staff has been permanently housed and the waterways have been permanently protected with stone. (7) The section beyond Dalbandin is still very incomplete; the staff is housed in temporary sleeper huts (which however have been well made and finis ed and are sufficiently serviceable for a year or two). The waterways have not yet been properly protected owing to an insufficiency of locomotives and travel mg tanks Materials are being collected and the permanent works will be taken in hand as soon as military traffic requirements permit. It is hoped they will be completed within the coming official year. (81 No good water has been discovered in the vicinity of Kundi and the only reliable supplies at present known in the Dalbandin-Mirjawa section are those at Dalbandin and Mirjawa and, possibly, Yakmach. Borings between miles 77 and 132 are in progress. , Dalbandin : ^ T * ALBUM, Dated February, 6th 1919. Engineer-in-Chief, NushU E xtension Bailaivy. j ♦(Appendices land 2 consisted of maps and sketches.)20 APPENDIX 4 '■ - .. Note on the Field Work of the NushJci Extension {Railway) Reconnaissance June 1918 to January 1919. Object of Survey. —The Railway Board in their letter No. 616-P. of 14th June 1918 to the Engineer-in-Chief, Nushki Extension Reconnaissance, forwarded instructions from the Chief of the General Staff, in which it is laid down that the object of the survey is to select possible alignments for an extension of the railway from Mirjawa to Neh, with at the same time a branch line terminating at Baring on the west bank of the Sistan Hamun. The field operations of any railway survey are :— (1) A general reconnaissance carried out mainly by the Engineer-in Chief himself of a wide area between the selected termini, on the basis of which and considering many other factors besides the mere configu- ation of the ground, he decides on the general alignment and the grades and curves to be used. (2) A survey along the selected route of an area about 1,000 feet wide on a scale of 13 inches to a mile (5‘28 inches to a mile difficult country) on which the centre line of the railway can be laid off. The survey also includes collection of information for design of bridges, yards, water supply. (3) If necessary the projected centre line is then pegged out on the ground for construction. The Reconnaissance must usually be made beforehand, and as in this case, this had not been done, and both reconnaissance and survey parties took the field together (July 3rd and 5th), proper instructions as to grades and curves to be adopted could not be given, and it was not until my return to Dehaneh Baghi from reconnoitr ing the area on August 7 that it was possible to fix these conditions. The result was that the work of the survey parties between Mirjawa and Duzdap during the first month had to be thrown away, when it was found that 1—100 grades ought to be adopted. For the reconnaissance of the area extending south to north from Mirjawa to Neh and Baring, and east to west from Sistan to Dahaneh Baghi, I sent Mr. F. A. Primrose, Executive Engineer, over the eastern routes and myself took the western area. Our parties were mainly mounted on riding camels and lightly equipped, bivouacs by night and single fly tents by day. We each covered about 450 miles between July 5 to August 7 when we reached Dahaneh Baghi and I sent in my preliminary report. We subsequently examined the west side of the Karegi Newar on my way back to Duzdap. I found that my impression of the Kashi pass during a sand storm had been very misleading and I went carefully over the Patki pass again with Mr. Primrose, and satisfied myself that the Kashi pass was the best, although grades were worse that I had first thought. These sand-storms were frequent and it was sometimes difficult to see 100 yards during the July storms and guides are very necessary. There are no tracks and water holes very inconspicuous. The storms, too, give trouble owing to rapid variation in the heights registered by the barometer. The result of the reconnaissance was to show that a very easy line with 1—100 grades (except at Kashi pass, where 1—62 is used temporarily for 3 miles up and 1—50 for 5 miles down) could be obtained via Duzdap, Garageh, Chah Kalandar, and Dahaneh Panjeh, with a branch down the Shor Rud valley to Baring. The selected route is shown in red on the attached map which also shows rejected routes in blue, routes marched in green, drinking water blue cross, water for animals broAvn cross. Mr. Edwards' yarty^ —(C. A. H. Edwards, Esq., Executive Engineer, Rail way Department (Rrailway Board). Orders for the construction of the line were received September 1 when only 26 miles rough survey'tff 4he 1—100 line from Duzdap summit had been done towards Mirjawa. But by pushing the work and putting on more men Mr. Edw-ards was able to complete the plans in time for the construction on November 3, which21 -■50 and cted )lue, toss. Bad- only don e svaids wliicli had been delayed by Want of labour on account of the influenza. Fortunately the survey party was not put out of action by induenza till the held work had just been completed. The total rise from Mirjawa to the Duzdap summit is 1,900 feet of' almost continuous 1—100 grade. Mr. Edwards’ party completed the remainder of this survey up to Garageh by December 20, including pegging out the centre line, and then returned to Dnzdap and started completing the plans. This party also constructed a bungalow and an office at Duzdap which it would have occupied if construction work had continued, so that they would have been in touch with the construction staff. As soon as construction was stopped there was no need for them to remain at Dazdap, and the Railway Board gave permission to return to Quetta, where there are facilities for preparing plans and estimates and where large part of the menial and transport staff could be dispensed with and expenditure in other ways much reduced. Mr. Monks Party.—F. D. Monks,Esq.,Executive Engineer, Railway Depart ment, (Railway Board). This party had surveyed the lower end of the 1—80 line from Mirjawa towards Duzdap and met Mr. Edwards 1 party near Mohammed Khan Ohah. Mr. Monks then took his party to Garageh and on August 15 started work towards IS eh after getting my instructions and information as to routes and water. Before leaving the Mirjawa end this party had put in hand construction of concrete tanks at Bug and Mohammed Khan Chah to hold about 5,000 gallons each. With these and other improvements carried out by Mr. Edwards it was possible to get enough vatei for the parties and our own convoys, and in a short time Baluchi caravans began to use this route to Sistan. Eventually all military convoys too were turned over from the Kacha route to the route we had developed via Duzdap. It may be remembered that on first going up this valley nothing was known about the water supply and actually the springs were only enough to water about 50 camels and then with diln- culty. Mr. Edwards’ party’s first march was 40 miles to Padgi in 28 hours. A route report received 6 weeks later from the General Officer Commanding, Birjand, stated if I remember right that from 250 to 500 camels could be watered at these wells which was certainly not the case till I had improved them. Mr. Mon ^s party completed the preliminary survey of the line to Neh and then handed over hlf his party to Mr. F. A. Primrose, Executive Engineer (lent by the Great India Peninsula Railway), who finished the Baring Branch. Mr. Monks returned and met me at Garageh on the 20th November. I returned with him to Neh going over all his plans with him. Unfortunately influenza broke out m our party and we only succeeded in reaching Neh (Khunick). Mr. Monks and 15 men died out of a total of 45. The work of this party was of course stopped till after Christmas when they rejoined Mr. Primrose and I returned to Duzdap and eventually to Quetta, arriving there January 19. The party now under Mr. Primrose pegged out almost 12 miles of line between Dahaneh Panjeh and Khunick and surveyed a realignment 12 miles long over the Tozgi pass which proved to be a great improvement, cutting out a 40-feet cutting and reducing length by two miles. The Baring Branch with reconnaissance and survey was done by Mr. Primrose. He reports a 40-mile waterless desert between Safedava and Baring and he remarks that even the Chagai Levies became cheerful on testing the sweet ice cold water of the Haman in July. His arrangements for surveying across the desert consisted in dividing his party intq small detachments, each provided with water and each having a fixed task which they had to get done or go back for water. He describes with enthusia~m the arrival at the Haman with its patches o green reeds, teaming with wild fowl with large droves of cattle grazing leisurely along its edge. Length of Survey done.-Jn addition to the located line of which Mr. Edwards’ party did 110 miles and Mr. Monks’ 190 miles, the former traversed and contoured 120 miles, fie. 30 miles of 1-80 line and 20 miles of 1-100 alternative between Mirjawa and Duzdap and between Dazdap and Garageh 15 miles Ml—62, 5 miles of 1 100 and 30 miles connecting traverse. My Monks’ party did 55 miles audition a con toured traverse including 20 miles at the Tozgi pass. An easy route at tins pass was only proved at the last moment. C26GSB22 Abstract.

A cement masonry tank 20 feet square and 10 feet deep was construc ted at Bug and a similar one at Mohammed Khan Chah, but the water here though pleasant to taste and sparkling was found violently purgative after a few days’ use and became unpopular. Besides this 7 wells 20 to 35 feet deep and averaging 10 feet diameter were dug at Duzdap by a special gang of Hazaras. Water was found in 4 of these. A similar well 16 feet deep was dug by my khalasies in July at Garageh and later a shallow one by other khalasies. Four dozen bottles containing samples of water from 16 different sources were collected and sent to the Chemical Examiner, Lahore, for analysis. Motor track.—A. track 12 feet wide passable by motors was cleared from Mirjawa to Garageh and by the end of December a track had been made from Barkhurdar to Neh. This track, running straight across the daman from the Kashi pass for 15 miles, is a welcome sight for anyone starting for Garageh, and has made these unpleasant marches comparatively easy. The track from Garageh to Barkhurdar will not now be made as it is not required by this survey. It may also be considered advisable to make this connexion over the July pass route instead of via Chah Kalandar. , Other incidental work. —The consideration of all station sites,—and several days were spent in each case considering the best sites for stations at Duzdap, Garageh and Neh, followed by additional survey on a large scale. In the case of Duzdap this extended to several miles and included the preparation of a town plan by Mr. Edwards, in conjunction with ^Ir. Allum and the Administrative Commandant of the area. The Duzdap valley was examined 12 miles up and down stream for water and other reasons. The copper and zinc mines at Lunka. were examined by Mr. Nizam Din, Assistant Engineer, and his report and specimen forwarded to the Director,^Geo logical Survey of India, for his opinion. The old earnings at Kashi were also reported on. Transport. —Four hundred and ten camels of the 55th Camel Corps and 120 of the 56th Corps were attached to this survey. The camels of the 55th Corps after 3 years on this line of communication are the finest I have ever seen, and the well-worn phrase “ devotion to duty ” acquires a new significance as interpreted by the rank and file of the 55th Corps. The strength of the parties to be maintained with food, water and materials and moved from place to place is as follows :— Offi- Sur- Clerks. Khala- Levies and Dak Sawars. In fantry escort.

The distance to water is seldom less than 3 miles, often 12 miles, and occasionally 25 miles, and to provide water for one or two horses and the men, a party of from 10 to 20 camels per 100 men are continuously employed. The distance from the base of supply at Juzzak to the supply depot at Khunick, along the railway line will be 238 miles and as the water holes are usually 4 to 5 miles off the direct route, the march route is not less than 250 miles. The country is practically uninhabited. The maximum range of camel transport grain fed but grazing en route is 300 miles, carrying 3 maunds paying load and 2 maunds of food grain or 150 miles out and back. Allowing for sorebacks, corps equip ment, etc., this may be reduced to 125 miles. Although supplies for No. 1 Party were drawn at Khunick in November, December 1918, and January 1919, the mean lead during the remaining months could not have been less than 120 miles for the whole establishment. In other words 40 per cent, of the camels were employ ed in maintaining the transport, although no bhoosa was carried (except after November, when bhoosa had to be given at Duzdap, as the enormous caravans had eaten all the grazing). Deducting 5 per cent, sick there remain 300 camels to feed, clothe, water and move, 407 men, 37 levy and riding camels, and 11 horses. In addition to materials for two three-roomed bungalows about 1,000 maunds of cement, a Bunnia shop at Duzdap, etc., apparently a mathematical impossibility. The Levy camels are very small and were mainly used for fetching letters, and out of the horses 5 did not work till they were got in condition about Novem ber. Influenza .—influenza broke out about October 20th at Mirjawa and Duzdap, and No. 2 party lost 17 men and were practically not at work for three weeks. My party with Mr. Monks lost 15 men and we were doing nothing for three weeks and scarcely able to get the camels out to graze. It may be estimated that this influenza delayed completion of field work nearly a month and increased cost of the survey by 25,000 rupees. By the death of Mr. Monks, A.M.I.C.E., I lost my best officer and the Govern ment a valuable servant, reliable and efficient. Scurvy .—Owing to the precaution taken to provide sufficient transport to enable the men to be properly fed, clothed and protected from the weather, no case of scurvy occurred. Previous to my appointment I was informed that men had been given a ration of flour only, with the result that there were many deaths from scurvy, and a sick rate of 27 per cent, is reported by Mr. Edwards to have occurred owing to scurvy in 1916-17. I also knew from experience on the Quetta-NushkkKailway in 1903 that scurvy was liable to cause many casualties. I therefore gave orders that every man was to be given a full ration of meat and vegetables, bread, tea, sugar and condiments without stint; also lime juice and rum when obtainable. Milk was only issued by the Supply Department to officers’and it was accordingly purchased by officers and issued by them to men requiring it. Men drew new boots when those first issued wore out, and new clothes, ''and every man had a water chagal. Warm clothing from the Military Department was indented for early iq August, but had not all been received till Christmas Day and deaths from influenza were no doubt increased from want of this warm cloth ing. I had however supplied every man (except the camel corps men who were not under my charge for such purposes) with a poshteen well in advance of the cold weather. It is not possible for natives of India to live like coolies in the rigorous climate of Persia and Baluchistan. But if well fed, clothed and properly treated natives, of India will do very well under any conditions, and in fact my men would have returned in better condition than they went out, if it had not been for influenza.25 List of officers and subordinates, etc., who served in Persia —contd.

Caravan routes. —Which may be developed. If the railway stops at Duzdap, it would be advisable to take the caravan route along the high level route via Garagehto Neh and avoid the low-lying Sistan plain which is exposed to raids, has no grazing, and much exposed to the blizzards of winter and summer. The route via Garageh may be considered a good all- the-year-round route, as it lies for the most part over 4,000 feet above the sea. In selecting a route for caravans, provision has to be made for drinking water for men, and water and grazing for animals. The latter must be sufficient for not less than 500 camels a day and must be within,2 or 3 miles of the route. It is less important to provide drinking water for men near the route ; in fact from 6 to 12 miles oft the route is not impracticable. Bearing these points in mind I should recommend the following route Luzdap to Neh. —Distance 170 miles. A good camel road except mile 2 and 3 stage 5 where road passes over hills and wants improving. Grazing and fuel plentiful except where stated. But if large caravans use this route without control grazing will soon disappear. An average of 1,000 camels a week past any point should be the absolute limit. „ Light motors should run via the July pass from Garageh to Mastian. See route (3). No supplies but occasionally flocks of sheep are to be found up to 100 or 200. The map of the district is good except the Neh sheet, which is sketchy. As there are no tracks guides must be taken, and without guides water holes could not be found, and description of route would not be of much value. Stage 1.-5,000 feet.—Kashi 10 miles good drinking water—quantity varies, may be enough for 500 camels in January and 50 in June. Route is up a narrow valley for last four miles. Water in cistern in sandstone rock in nala bed. There are several other springs near. Stage 2.—Hill camp, 22 miles, 32 miles from Duzdap, height, 4,200, pass the Kashi pass about 100 yards wide between hills 500 feet high, then open plain to an isolated hill peak 200 feet high in middle of plain. Small well of very brackish water has been dug near by. If camels must water they must go via Kundi, which is 6 miles east on the top of the eastern daman, height |4,500, water brackish, plen tiful and just drinkable. This is 27 miles from Garageh, straight across the newar. Grazing scarce near Kundi. C26GSB26 Stage 3, height 4,348 feel. —Garageh, 18 miles—50 miles from Duzdap. Open gravel plain all the way till near Garageh, where some sand -hills, “ Bug ” and several wells of fairly good water, and some “ Jugis: ” water 5 to 16 feet below ground ; clay and gravel soil. i Stage 4. —Chah Kura 18 miles, 68 miles from Duzdap, height 4,750, good going over gravel plain, water brackish but just drinkable—good well required- water 16 feet clay soil. Good drinking water 6 miles north-west at Chahganj. Stage 5. —Chah Kalandar—13 miles—81 miles from Duzdap, height, plenty of water but not drinkable in summer, 10 feet to water, gravel soil. After leaving Chah Kuxa cross a pass 5,100 feet north-east of camp, road wants improving, . but not bad through low hills. Good drinking water can be had at Chah Bedu 12 miles east of Kalandar or Chah Unaq 12 miles west or Chah Gul Mohammed 12 miles north, passed in next stage 5 miles west of miles 10. Site of well marked by a white splash on hill side and mud Buxji 6 feet high, water very low in summer. Stage 6 .—Chah Mastian 23 miles, 104 from Duzdap height 4. Water plentiful but very bitter, only fit for animals. Better wells required, 20 feet to water gravel 1 soil. Nomads live here all summer and drink this water.' No other drinking water near. Stage 7.—Chah Shuiab. 24 miles, 128 from Duzdap, water brackish but drink able from shallow well in “ bug ” site very exposed to wind in both summer and winter. Very good going down the valley, sandy or gravel soil, lots of grazing and fuel. The camp is at foot of Karbasi peak, on the other side the ridge acces sible by a mule track is the sweet water Karbasi spring enough for battalion, patch of melons. Some Baruhis’ tents. At Surguri half on this stage there is a small spring of good water within hills 3 miles west. No fuel or grazing near camp, must go 4 or 5 miles north-west or south-west. Stage 8. Kurggaz—25 miles, 153 miles from Duzdap, height, 3,000 feet, water brackish but drinkable—better wells required. There is no need to go to wells. Camp on the motor road 4 miles west. TheDahaneh Panjeh is passed at 10 miles on this stage, a narrow defile but short and not a serious military obstacle. Impassable during floods which last some hours during January. Stage 9.—Neh 17 miles. 170 miles from Duzdap, height 3,900 feet, camp at Karez at west side of Daulatabad gardens, 2 miles north-east of Neh fort. Good karez giving 500,000 gallons a day, no fuel, little grazing. There are other larger karezes in Neh. Pass Khunick mile 12, a small Persian village the first on the east side of Persia. Large karez, water slightly salt but good, 1,700,000 gallons a day. Camp at Khunick on sandy ground on north-east side of village, the part near the karez is very cold, exposed and liable to flood. Koute 2. From Chah Kalandar stage 5 of note 1 to Safedava, there is a good route for small caravans or motors. The going is good at the bottom of valleys, and except in the descent of 2 miles from Kaftargo pass would be passed without much trouble. The descent of Kaftargo pass would pass motors without many minutes ’ work clearing. There is good and sweet water at each stage but short in supply and not capable of development except at Butago. Probably enough water for 100 camels at each stage. At Butago present supply enough for 50 men, but could probably be developed into a large supply by wells or karez. Stage 1. —Chah Bedu 12 miles, height 4,288 feet; the well is 6 miles off the bot tom of the valley. Water from the well in rock 10 feet deep very good, 2 or 3 “ jugis ;y here. Fuel and grazing scarce near camp but plentiful in the valley. Stage 2. —Chah Kaftargo 27 miles (39) height 4,458, cross the Kaftargo Kotal miles 22, descent 1-30 fro-m it for two miles, grazing and fuel scarce near well, plenty in valley. Stage 3. —Safedava 18 miles (57) pass Butago at 9 miles, tamarisk jungle (3,500 feet height above M. S. L.)._ Butago defile J miles long though rocky hills.’ 1 strong military position.Route 3. From Chah Kura stage 4 route 1 to K eh alternative over high pas&amp;es touches the route 1 at Mastian. This route might be used for small caravans and motors to Mastian as the going is better, but water is 3 or 4 miles off the valley, and, though good,-is small in quantity, and not developable. The remainder of the route via Hyderabad crosses a pass, Nureddin 6,875 feet, and, therefore, is not o much importance. The going is good over the Kuh Nur-ed-din except m a tew places where there are boulders in a narrow nala, and some steep descents near the summit of the pass on the north side of the hill. This might be improved. Stage 7.—Chah Rehman 19 miles, height 4,800, cross the July pass 5,600 mile 9, summit a mile wide, and sloping 1-40 up to Lunka, 7,500 feet on west, and lozgi 6,500 on east. On the summit there is a good camping ground, vegetation, sandy soil, water from Chah Gang 3 miles south-west, and Chah July 3 miles nort west (visited by Mr. Primrose), good water, but small quantity, enough 100 men at most. The well at Chah Rehman (not visited) is 3 miles west of bottom of valley at the top of the Daman. Chah Unaq is 4 miles east of camp in the valley, across hills, difficult for camels, but passable. Water good, rock well enough for 50 camels and 100 men. Height 5,020 feet above sea. Stage 2.—Chah Mastian mile 19 (38) good going, good grazing descends to about 3,800 feet at Chah Dozakh, good rock well, same as Chah Unaq. borne 3 or 4 jugis camped here, with levy post 2 men. Said to be a larger source o wa er 3 miles north of the spring, but brackish. Cross a divide, height 4,550, 3 miles from Mastian. Stage 3—Hyderabad—25 miles (63), height 3,683 feet. _ There is an unpleasant surprise and a most unusual topographical feature for this country in this stage. An apparently level stony daman leads one between two isolated mountains about 6 miles north-west of Mastian. But on the west side of the hills is a nala 30 feet wide and 30 feet deep with vertical sides, which a caravan might walk into in a dark night, and impassable for 2 miles up or down. It is advisable to keep away to the north side of these two hills, where the nala is easily crossed. Remainder of road easy. Pass brackish springs (with jugis). Zur south of mile 16 not visited. The bottom of the valley mile 20, is height 3,480 feet. Hyderabad a ruined mud fort 40 yards square with walls and towers 30 feet high, a ruined karez which might be developed. Water brackish but drinkable in hot weather. Large clumps of tamarisk. No inhabitants but two Persian levies. Stage 4. —Distance 18 miles (81). , ' ; Camp at west foot of hill marked 6,450 on map. 60° 5 long. Latitude SHIS'. A flat-topped mountain. The map of this part gives no indication of the country except that there is a high clump of hills. Between Hyderabad and Seh Farsakh there is a well defined track probably made by the levies. It rises up a daman for 9 miles to height 4,500 feet and then enters mountains following a steeply rising and tortuous nala to the camp. The going is good, over soft gravel. Above 5,000 there are large numbers of pistachio all over this range. Good sheep grazing. Water from two small springs at the camp enough for 50 men and 20 animals and good water. Fuel plentiful, height of camp 6,030 feet. ’ Stage 5.—Seh Farsakh—height 4,438 feet—distance 15 miles (96), cross the summit 6,853 at mile 6. There are one or two bits of 1—6 rising to south side of pass, but going is good ; pass a spring enough for 50 men, J mile from summit, good water. Descent steep in places on north side for 2 miles down ravine, with boulders, bad going for camels. Pass a small bagichah J mile from summit (6,450\ a few orange trees, springs of good water might be developed. The top of the hirt is open and undulating, plenty of building space, and good soil, pistachio trees and thorns. Highest point about 7,000 feet. Descent after first 2 miles down a 1—25 nala bed, good going, soft gravel, plenty of tamarisk. Seh Tarsakh is an enclosed Persian village with gardens of pomegranate, grapes, and peaches, and cultivation28 extending J mile below the outflow of a gushing spring giving about 100,000 gallons a day of excellent water. The village is at the top of a stony daman. Stage 6 .—Distance 10 miles (106), Neh—descend stony daman and this plain of sandy soil, Neh fort is visible all the way • also Khunick village, which is passed at mile 6, lying 4 miles east. Route 4. Garageh to Dehaneh Baghi. Follow the telegraph line and ascend the daman to the foot of Kuh Malusan, distance 12 miles, height of Dehaneh Baghi 5,275, the bungalow lies at the top of a bare black stony daman covered with boulders and with a fall of 1—14, and intersected by deep nalas. There is a background of bare shale mountain. A spring about J mile up the ravine is led by a channel to the telegraph bungalow and gives about 50,000 gallons a day. The water is good to drink (though full of salts). The camping ground is scanty and bad; there is no grazing. Fuel from the hills. The telegraph garden contains a few poplars and some almond and peach and apple trees, and grows melons and cucumbers in sum mer ; area about 50 yards by 100 yards. L. E. HOPKINS, Major, R.E., Engineer-in-Chief, N. E. Reconnaissance, Quetta : February 1919.30 Report on the working of the East Persia Line of Communication from September 1918 to 15th January 1919. CHAPTER I. General. 1. I arrived at Jimak on the 4th October 1918 and took over the duties of Inspector General of Communications, East Persia the administrative and defence duties on what had hitherto been known as the East Persia Cordon having, m accordance with a recent decision, been divided between the Inspector General of Communications and a General Officer Commanding Line of Communications defences. , 2. In accordance with the instructions which I had received, the conditions which I had to meet were— M The maintenance of the force at and beyond Meshed under the command of Major-General W. Malleson, C.B., C.I.E. (ii) The maintenance of the troops and services on the line of communica tion in East Persia. (Hi) Preparations to enable, on or after the 1st April 1919, a force of a Divi- sion plus a Cavalry and an Infantry Brigade, to move up the line of ‘ Communication to Meshed and thereafter be maintained at or beyond that point, the Lines of Communication troops being at the same time increased to a force of one Infantry and one Cavalry Brigade. 3. I was provided with a staff consisting of an Assistant Quartermaster- General and a Staff Captain (augmented later by a General Staff Officer III), with four Administrative Commandants. The various Administrative Services on the Line of Communication were also placed under my orders Of the four Adminis trative Commandants only one had been appointed at the time of my arrival; the other three did not arrive in East Persia till three weeks later. 4 Railhead was at that time at Juzzakbut plate-laying had progressed as far as Miriawa. A new railhead was expected to be open for use at Duzdap by Christ mas 1918, and the line as far as Neh expected to be open by May 1919, though endeavours were to be made to reach this point a month earlier. 5. The immediate task before me was a threefold one : (a) To review the existing situation as regards personnel and resources V 1 aEl i ascertain the extent to which the latter could be augmented •locally. (b) To work out wbat was needed to deal with tbe problem which I had to solve arid frame my requirements accordingly. (c) To organise the line of communication to carry out the role it had to fulfil. 6 The above points could not of course be satisfactorily dealt with till I had berin over the whole line personally and had ascertained definitely what local resources both in supplies, transport and labour I could rely on and had also obtained a definite statement of what the requirements of the force m Tmnscaspia consisted These requirements had hitherto apparently taken the form of periodical urgent and previously unanticipated demands for various orms of supplies or stores which had to be met immediately and to meet which the transport, and especially the mechanical transport, had been considerably disorganised the majority of the latter at the time of my arrival consisting of derelicts spread along some 600 milea of road and in process of being gradually retrieved. 7 It was necessary, however, without awaiting the complete collection of the information mentioned in the preceding paragraph, to set the machinery in motionSI ,to l to ki local aned sted. [8 eiit slid ly# &gt;!* iiiiilt* olfti mold® and frame approximate estimates of what was needed to cany out the task lying before me. 8. The organisation of the line was the first need, and here the ruling factor was the fact that I was allowed four Administrative Commandants, thus involving the sub-division of the line into four sections. After discussion with Brigadier- General Dale, General Officer Commanding, Line of Communication Defences, the following division was mutually decided on in that, in conformity with Field Service Regulations, the sections for defence and administration should coincide. Juzzak-Hurmuk 100 miles (approximat?) .. “ South-'rn ” Section. Hurmuk-Shusp 150 miles (approximate) .. “ South Central ” Section. Shusp-Kain 180 miles (approximate) .. “ Northern Central” Section. Kain-Meshed 250 miles (approximate) .. “ Northern ” Section. 9. The last two appeared too great in length to constitute single sections but I awaited actual trial before representing the fact. Finding however that the section officers could not efficiently supervise such areas I asked for and obtained permission, in December 1918, to sub-divide each of these sections into two. i 10. Owing to the extent of country covered and consequent difficulty of super vision, it appeared essential to decentralise work among the sections. I cons - quently, with the approval of the General Officer Commanding, 4th (Quetta) Divi sion' adopted as the basis of the organisation of the line, the principle of each sec tion being self-contained as regards all Administrative Services, the sub-head of each service in each section working under the Administrative Commanoant as my representative in the section but being responsible, as regards technical details of his service, to the head of his service at Line of Communications Headquarters. 11. The details of the organisation which was accordingly put into force are contained in the “ Administrative Standing Orders for the Line of Communication ” shown in annexure I to this report. It will be observed that these orders were issued under the joint authority of the General Officer Commanding Line of Com munication Defences and myself, which obviated the possibility of questions being raised as to their applicability to any particular Unit or individual on the line. 12. The next matter that required immediate attention was the preparation of a forecast of the amount of transport that would be required on the line to carry out my task as defined in paragraph 2. Such a forecast coukl only be an approxi mate one until the information referred to in paragraph 5 had been fully obtained but in view of the short time available and the possibility of a severe winter it was imperative to have immediately some estimate of what these requirements were likely to be. 13. The method adopted to obtain the estimate was to bring the needs of troops and services in transportation energy and the capacity of venous forms of transport to produce such energy into similar terms and so balance them. The term adopted was “ weekly-ton-mileage ” or the number of tons carried per mile per week. The needs of troops or services could always be reduced to the number of tons required per week to be brought over a certain distance or certain distances. The average capacity of different forms of transport to produce transportation energy could similarly always be reduced to the number of ton-miles per week they were capable of carrying continuously, the need for rest, repair, etc., being allowed for in calculating the wtm. 14. The estimate arrived at on the above lines was embodied in a telegram which I submitted on the 14th October and which is attached as annexure II. The method of arriving at the figures is shown in the tables attached to the revised estimate subsequently submitted (annexure IV). 15. It was now necessary to proceed to Meshed to obtain the information to revise this preliminary estimate and. the organisation working in a regular manner, to attain the objects mentioned in paragraph 2. Two matters Wever required urgent attention, the question of reopening trade to Eastern Persia and the collection of local labour tor road making.32 16. The desirability of reopening trade had been nr^ed by the Political Autho* Titles, and the Political Agent, Chagai, had put forward a scheme for the collection of came s from Baluchistan and their employment in Eastern Persia under his control for both military and trade purposes. After discussion with His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Birjand and review of the local situation I reported to the Genera* Officer Commanding 4th (Quetta) Division that the adoption of the Poli tical Officer, Chagai’s proposal was undesirable on the grounds both that the principle of p’acing the transportation of military stores on a Line of Communica tions in time of war under civilian control was in itself inherently unsound and impracticable, and a’so that the fuffi ment of the programme mentioned in para graph 2 neeeshtated the empffiyment for military purposef of all local transport that could be procured. The continuance of trade restrictions was, in the circum stances, a military necessity. 17. The Line of Communication consisted of 670 miles of road of varying degrees of condition which had to be made fit for use by light mechanical trans' port such as Ford Vans and Ford Ambulances. In view here also of the shortness of time available aiid the near approach of a possibly severe winter, it was necessary to collect and set to work as much local labour as possible without delay. With the kind and ready assistance of His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed and His Biitannic Majesty’sConsul for Seistan and Kain arrangements were speedily got into train for this to be done, the Sistan Levy Corps being utilised to collect the labour and supervise the work of the gangs the application of the labour being directed by the engineer of the section. His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed also Arranged for the supply from Meshed and Turbat of a considerable quantity of road-making tools. With the above assistance considerable progress was made in the improvement of the road during the period under report and is dealt with further in Chapter VI “ Works.” 18. I proceeded to Meshed, arriving there on the 24th October. Investigation of the supply situation in Khorasan proved to be more favourable than had been anticipated, a number of articles being obtainable in plenty which it had previously been calculated would have to be carried up from railhead. The general supply situation along the Line of Communications could now be visualised and is shown in the form of a diagram in Plan A attached to this report. 19. After discussion with General Malleson I was able to tabulate the require ments of the Transcaspia force, differentiating between what were arrears, so to speak, in requirements and the regular weekly flow of different articles into Meshed which would enable the needs of the force to be met, once those arrears had been made up. As a result of this discussion I was enabled to issue definite instructions regarding the regular flow of different articles up the line to meet and anticipate the needs of the Transcaspia force and the Line of Communications. These ins tructions are contained in Annexure III. 20. On return from Meffied I was enabled to frame a revised estimate of trans' port required to carry out the programme mentioned in paragraph 2. This estF mate, together with tables showing how figures mentioned are arrived at, is attached as annexire IV. 21. A difficulty, which had been threatening for sometime, viz., shortage of actual oin in the branches of the Imperial Bank of Persia, now reached ahead. The available coin was being dissipated through our' purchases of supplies, hiring of transport and wages for labour and was not flowing back again to the* Bank! It was asserted that the stoppage of trade from India was largely responsible for this, as it restricted inducements which recipients of coin from our operations had for disposing of their cash and also diminished the demand on the branches of the Bank for Rupee drafts on India in exchange for Persian coin, which had been the chief source of the supply of such coin to the Bank. The result was an absolute absence of com in the branches at Birjand and Sistan and a condition nearly as bad at Me heI. Coin was not forthcoming to meet our obligations, the purchase of sapplies had to be suspended, and hired transport dismissed. A sum of 15 lakhs Ol rupees (of which 5 were for General Malleson’spolitical operations) were sent in species from India at the end of November, reaching Birjand towards the end of33 December and Meshed the middle of January. The situation was relieved partly by the receipt of this specie but more by the fact that a change, in the intentions regarding operations to be undertaken in the spring in East Persia had taken place, and preparations on the scale originally intended were no longer necessary. The suspension of purchase of supplies and dismissal of hired carriage coupled with a sale of part of the supplies purchased in Khorasan in accordance with the original programme helped to relieve the situation but there w r ere arrears of indebtedness to be paid off which the arrival of the specie from India enabled us o liquidate. Meanwhile the absence of cash to meet our obligations had caused lome murmuring, especially at Meshed, and had somewhat damaged our reputation. Che financial difficulty was one that had been foreseen in Persia for some time and :ecommendations had been submitted that the mintage of Persian money should )e undertaken in India as the amount of Persian coin in circulation in East Persia, while sufficient to meet the ordinary needs of the population, was not sufficient for operations such as we were conducting. The difficulty, though lessened by the smaller scope of the preparations which were ordered later, is one that is still present as the branches of the Imperial Bank of Persia are unable to find the cash to meet the credits which the KLad Office at Tehran opened for military purposes at those branches. 22. I Was informed in the middle of November that the whole question of the force to be maintained in East Persia and Transcaspia was under reconsidera- ation, but meanwhile I was to continue my preparations. With the exception of the purchase of supplies in Khorasan which the absence of cash precluded a continuance of on the previous scale, all organisation measures for the L. and C. were continued as before and the instructions referred to in paragraph 19 continued to be acted on. &gt; t 23. Brigadier-General Beatty, D.S.O., was appointed to command the troops at and beyond Meshed and arrived at that place on the 28th November. At the same time it was suggested that it might be advisable for the L. of C. to be extended for administrative purposes to Askabad. I accordingly proceeded to Meshed, arriving there on 16th December, to discuss the question with General Beatty. I reported to the General Officer Commanding 4th (Quetta) Division that both General Beatty and General Malleson were desirious of the L. of C. being extended to Askabad and I could arrange to take over this line at once if sanctioned. On receipt of orders to do so I organised the Meshed-Askabad line as a fifth section to the L. of C. on the same lines as the other sections. 24. I received at the same time intimation of the decision regarding future forces to be maintained in Transcaspia. This was that the force in Transcaspia was to be brought up to an Infantry Brigade (1 British Battalion and 3 Indian) with an Indian Cavalry Regiment, a Field Battery, a Machine Gun Squadron, a Field Troop of Sappers and a Cavalry Brigade Signal Troop, with the necessary administrative services. The British units were to be furnished from the force in North Persia. Of the others the two Indian Infantry Battalions were to be sent from India on or after the 1st April and the other units (excluding one Indian Infantry Battalion and the Indian Cavalry Regiment already there) were to be sent to Transcaspia as soon as possible. These facts gave me the necessary data to enable the stocks to be maintained as reserves at the different depots along the line to be worked out and the weekly flow both up the line from railhead and down the line as regards local supplies from Khorasan, to be regulated. A revised set of instructions with tables for the different depots and sections of the line was accordingly drawn up. These are contained in annexure V. 25. My tour up the line to Meshed had impressed upon me the difficulty of * expecting one set of section officers to supervise such great lengths of the fine as 230 and 180 miles, especially at the north end where facilities for movement by mechanical transport were scanty. I accordingly asked for and obtained permission to divide each of these sections into two. The change involved the appointment of two more Administrative Commandants, who however could be found from the force, and the other officers needed obtained by redistribution C 26 GSB34 The line of communication was now divided into seven sections, numbered first to seventh, from north to south, the sections being arranged as follows : — Askabad-Meshed 160 miles (approximate) - - .. “ First ” Section 90 „ Meshed-Turbat Turbat-Kain 140 Kam-Birjand 70 Birjand-Sbusp 110 Shusp-Hurmuk 150 Hurmuk-Juzzak 100 “ Second ” Section. “ Third ” Section. “ Fourth ” Section. “ Fifth ” Section. “ Sixth ” Section. “ Seventh ” Section The organisation Each section was organised similarly to the previous sections of the line as now constituted is shown in Plan B. 26. Bailhead which it had been anticipated would have reached Duzdap by Xmas has not yet done so and the new railhead is not expected to be open to traffic before the middle of February. The delw was partly due to the influenza epidemic which raged in the southern part of the under report. It was particularly severe m Khwash in October, at Bobat Kacha in November, and at Dehani Baghi in January. CHAPTER II. Supply and Transport. 27.

Annexure VII gives a list of organised transport units employed, inrexure VIII enumerates the various Supply Units belonging to the L. of C. &gt;nd their present distribution throughout East Persia. 29. It will be seen from annexme VI that the Supply and Transport organisa- tion conforms to the sectional organisation described m Clmptei I. The fe. . S and the T O. S. of each section respectively control the supply and trans- nort services throughout their sections. Serving under the S.O.

S. g. D. Sectron, identifying a stationary supply depot on a Line of Com- bection The best w y t he place where it is located, and not by a number “g“ Kng into hundreds This is difficult for any-one to remember- who is not intimately concerned with tne vhole senes. _ 0n the other hand I fully recognised the importance of keeping m the i i 35 ^- full record of the whereabouts of - every supply unit however Sredid a“ of the particular supply unit to which each individual belonged.. 36 Moreover when asking for reinforcements I was careful to quote the S. D. Sections in which the casualties that they were required to fill had actually occurred, until I was informed from India that this was no longer necessary, and was even found in practice to he inconvenient. 36. Certain functions of supply and transport have had to be performed without strict adherence to the organisation into sections of the line. I refer to those of the D. A. D. M. T., the D. A. D. S. and T., Local Purchases, the S. T. 0. Sistan and the D. A. D.S. and 1., Local Resources. 37. It was obvious that the D. A. D. M. T. could not control M. T. efficiently from my own headquarters which are 100 miles distant from the M. T. convoy terminus. His range is therefore that of the M. T. convoys and his duties while mainly consisting of the technical supervision of M.T. also include relations with Administrative Commandants. For in respect to M. T. convoys he performs the same duties as are performed by a T. 0. S. in respect to convoys of animal transport. The D. A. D. M. T., however, has relations with three Administrative Commands, not only one—with the Administrative Commandant 5th Section in respect to backloads sent by Mechanical Transport from Shusp, and with the Administration Commandants of 6th and 7th Sections in respect to other Mechani cal Transport convoys. His headquarters are, however, usually at Hurmuk and though he travels freely and can keep in close touch with all three Administrative Commandants, he has for certain purposes to depute other Mechanical Transport Officers to represent him at SJmsp and railhead respectively when he is not there. 38. The Deputy Assistant Director of Supply and Transport, Local Purchases, with the same object of being near his work has his headquarters at Meshed which is the most convenient spot from which to control purchases in the fertile area that extends, with some bare patches intervening, from Kuchan to Kain. AH supply officers, whether S. 0. S. or officers in charge of subsidiary supply depots, are also purchasing officers, and those in the area mentioned have been placed for the purpose of local purchases under the Deputy Assistant Director, Supply and Transport, Local Purchases, without strict reference to the Sectional Organisation. When in supply depot a junior officer is employed solely on purchasing duties, it has been found better to place him under the orders of the officer in charge of the depot rather than treat his charge as an independent one. 39. Though all posts off the main line are included in one or other of the sections, yet for supply and transport purposes it has been found desirable to separate the Supply and Transport-duties of Sistan from those of the S. 0. S. and T. 0. S. of the 6th section. The work there is of a distinct kind. The feeding of the local garrison is only a minor part of it and the rest consists in procuring and placing on the Line of Communication as much grain and fodder as is obtainable. It needs an organisation entirely separate from that of the sixth section to do this. The work is important and extensive and the Supply and Transport Officer, Sistan, who is assisted by two officers and works directly under the orders of the Assistant Director, Supply and Transport, has been raised to the same status as that of a S, 0. S. and forms part of the Supply and Transport Directorate. 40. The Deputy Assistant Director, Supply and Transport, Local Resources, is also at present employed in Sistan and is directly under the orders of the Assistant Director, Supply and Transport, but at the same time works in close co-operation with His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, whose winter headquarters are at Nasratabad. 41. The working of the Supply and Transport services has been considerably hampered both by the paucity and the inferiority bf the personnel. The former of these defects has been to a great extent rectified of late, but I am still working with a very narrow margin of safety. A further epidemic of influen za, such as that which laid low the whole supply establishment of Robat in the early autumn, would entirely paralyse work. I proposed in November that I should maintain on the spot a reserve of Supply and Transport reinforcements and train them while in waiting. I understand however that the uncertainty regarding the future arrangements for the force in Transcaspia rendered it un desirable suddenly to increase my complement of personnel. The same reason has /prevented establishments being provided for small forage dumps at every halting place on the Line of Communication. These would have been useful in saving mounted troops and transport from carrying their own forage along with thein on the march between the main stages, and thereby have considerably reduced the total transport needed on the Line of Communication. 42. On the Line of Communication I have at present four regular Supply and Transport Officers and one regular Army Service Corps Officer. The proportmn o permanent establishments is even smaller m the case of British Other Ranks and Superior Indian Establishments. The temporary establishments have for the most part arrived in the country untrained or only partially trained, am aware that the drain on all ranks in India throughout the war has been extreme and in writing these facts, I desire merely to give a faithful account oi the bupp y and Transport affairs. (ii).—Supplies in Telation to transpoft, 43 Plan A already referred to in paragraph 18 shows the respective origins , Jiff' Tm t sorts of supplies. They consist of those procurable only from India, those that can be purchased at the places where they are required and those that, like the latter can be purchased 'Xra for consumption up or down the line rather than at the ^ of san and Sistan are the main places of origin for C ' aS ^ J back-loading KWasan sunnlies the distribution has been more in the torm ol Dack ioaa g than forward-loading- In that of the Sistan supplies which consist almost entirely suss 1 .

A statement in maunds of the supplies lifted between posts daring the period under review is given-m annexure IA. (Hi).—Supplies from India. 44 The qualitv of supplies from India has on the whole been good. There , . fit n instances of rum tasting of cresol, . which have possibly resulted ft-om rum kegs being made up from the wood-work of casks that had previous y contained cresol. I am informed that before my arrival the officer in charge of the base depm l.fm miOL1 u vvoofipr tn bis headquarters m Quetta. Recent consign ments have been without this defect, but the incident points to the fact that while X sLpTv officer who passes rum is generally most particular to test its strength g^Sv with the hydrometer he frequently omits the simple and obvious duty of tasting it also. C26G$B45. Instances of badly sealed brands of tobacco and a badly preserved brand of butter have already been made the subject of a special report. To obviate both the waste of transport and the unforeseen shortages that arise from not detecting defects in supplies till they have advanced some way up the line. I have instituted a system by which all supplies taken over from the depot at railhead are specially tested by a Board of Officers before they are uploaded. (iv). — Purchases. 46. The forage and wheat products of Sistan available for purchase are for the most part the property of the Teheran Government, being part of the revenue that is payable to them in kind. Their sale is strictly controlled and to prevent profiteering and consequent hardship to the poorer classes no regular markets in these commodities are allowed to exist. Hence to fall in with this policy I have at the request of the Consular authorities made no fresh contracts with any contractors to buy any of these articles but have merely undertaken to take over certain large quantities of bhoosa, wheat and other ^grains. I however have given a contract to one firm for collecting the produce. He is paid by the weight collected and dumped and his remuneration is merely a fee for services rendered. 47. There is not the same restraint exercised on private trading in Khorasan f but both there and in Kain and Birjand where certain purchases are also made I seek the advice of the Consular authorities before accepting rates. A mutual benefit results. On the one hand, I am told what is a fair price and on the other am prevented from needlessly putting up prices beyond the reach of the poorer buyer and so causing hardship or resentment. Even so the presence of many hungry British and Indian mouths in a not over fertile country that a year ago was, in parts suffering from famine, has had the inevitable effect of making living expensive. This of course reacts on us in other ways and I have had for instance to raise the rates for hired camel men owing to the increased cost of all food-stuffs. &lt; 48. In the case of a large number of contracts, it has been necessary to give advances before delivery of the goods. This proved to be the ordinary method of doing business in Persia, and the only alternative to acquiescing in it would have been to let the troops go unted. The risk of bad debts has been avoided so far successfully by making it an invariable rule not give an advance to any Persian except after ascertaining from the Consular authorities that he is to be trusted. The amount up to which he may be trusted is also ascertained. In one case of difficulty that arose over an advance that was made before this rule came into force the Local Persian Governor came to my assistance and brought the required pressure to bear upon the defaulter. The system of giving advances demands careful book-keeping and I insist on purchasing officers keeping ledger accounts with all their contractors individually so as to know exactly what each one owes at the moment and to what extent he is fulfilling his obligations. 49. A feature in Persian trade,; especially in those areas in which less restraint is exercised upon it by the Persian Government is the enterprising Indian trader. Though in the matter of local produce he acts as a middle-man, it is yet possible sometimes to make better bargains with him than with the Persian himself. More over when, as sometimes, he is willing to take payment in rupee-drafts he saves the use of Persian currency to that extent. 50. The financial problems with which I have been faced have been touched upon in paragraph 21 and are also dealt with under a special heading in a later part of this report. But it is necessary here to mention what an important and difficult matter it has been to find sufficient coin to pay for supplies and transport. In the northern area not only has it been on certain occasions impossible to continue purchasing, but equally impossible to continue hiring the transport required to convey articles already purchased, to the places down the line for which they w T ere destined. This again has reacted on the programme of upward loading. For the same transport that would, for instance, have taken supplies part way down the line'from Meshed was being relied upon to carry up supplies of Indian origin. {v).—Storcheeping accommodation. 51. There are various kinds of accommodation at the various supply depots. Some, as at Meshed, are located in Persian serais 'with a good courtyard in the39 centre and store-rooms all round it. In other places, such as Kain, shift has to be made by adopting rows of small Persian houses, knocking out a wall in one place to make a gangway and building a wall in another to make an enclosure. In others, such as Sistan, where time and labour have been more abundant, it has been possible to lay out and build a Supply Depot ad hoc. Such another depot will be that at Turbat when the garrison moves out of the unhealthy town into the cantonment which is being built outside it. Elsewhere, as at Hurmuk, storage is mainly in the open and in this dry climate provided platforms are built and paulins well sloped and secured few stores are liable to damage from such rain as falls. But a great disadvantage of storing grain and loose bhoosa in the open is that it immobilizes so many bags. As a result of the war, which has been fought to the last strand of jute, it is I know necessary to save gunny bags as much as possible, and this is best done by keeping them all in circulation. The side loading from Sistan employs a very great many, and so, to release as many as possible for this purpose without increasing my demands on India unduly, I have ordered all bhoosa and grain to be stored loose. Where covered store-rooms do not exist I am having roofless mud towers made. These can be covered with paulins, which are raised up in the centre and secured to the wails. (vi). — Losses. 52. The losses in store have not been great. The subject of losses on convoys is dealt with under the head of transport. (vii).—Ordnance Stores in Supply Depots. 53. The transfer of many articles of supply from the Supply and Transport Corps to the Ordnance Department has taken place without the establishment for opening the necessary Ordnance Depots up the line being so far sent from India. Hence it has been necessary to continue storing Ordnance supplies in the depots of the Supply and Transport Corps everywhere except at railhead. The establish ments of the supply depots are however placed at the disposal of my Deputy Assist ant Director of Ordnance Supplies as a temporary measure for any work connected with the receipt, storage and issue of Ordnance stores. They take the orders of my Deputy Assistant Director of Ordnance Stores direct in all such matters without reference to my Assistant Director, Supply and Transport, who however would, if necessary be referred to by my Deputy Assistant Director of Ordnance Supplies in any matter of discipline arising out of this branch of their work. This is of course a purely temporary measure, which it is intended to do away with as soon as 'the necessary, Ordnance establishments arrive. Serving two masters is objection able in principle, but the temporary necessity for making certain establishments do so in this particular case is fully recognized. The general question of the ordnance service is dealt with elsewhere in tms report. (viii).—Local Resources, 54. The orders laying down the functions of the Deputy Assistant Director Supply and Transport, Local Besources, gave a very wide choice of methods by which to employ him, the only restriction imposed being that which forbade his functions being confused with those of a Purchasing Officer. I had therefore first to consider what general policy I should have in view when employing him. It was obvious that this policy ought to depend on the probable length of time that British and Indian troops occupy East.Persia. However, not only was this undeter minable but it would also have been politically unwise to start the Deputy Assistant Director Supply and Transport, Local Besources, on any enterprise that would crive the Persian officials or population the impression that the British and Indians'had definitely come to stay. If this consideration had not been paramount, it would possibly have been better to utilise this officer in devising far-reaching schemes for reclaiming d&gt; sert tracts, and for the intensive culture of the tracts that are already fertile or semi-fertile and in prospecting for valuable minerals. But with this important consideration in view, such a course seemed to be pro hibited For instance nothing but the most elaborate well-boring machi nery (which would take long in transportation, erection and application) would be likely to place under irrigation mere land than is now irrigated. The Persian is already a passed master m tne ancient Eastern arts of irrigation, and the Persian karez and well are in thonselves triumphs of primitive science.40 There is moreover a danger of ^sing the water that exists between strata if one probes through the impervious stratum on the chance of finding more water beneath Meanwhile every drop of water in Persia appears to be utilized to the full extent that the existing methods permit. Whole fortunes for instance have been spent in probing the mountains near Birjand till they have been sucked literally dry. Whereas in all countries it is true that no habitation exists except near water, in Persia the converse also is true ; for there is no pool or trickle of water, accessible from the surface, that has not already been put to use in irrigating land or otherwise sustaining life. 55. I therefore definitely decided against employing the Deputy Assistant Director of Supply and Transport, Local Kesources, for the present at any rate upon, any active enterprise of land reel; i mat ion. Though the occasion may yet arise when he may be employed in prospecting with that ultimate object in view and in prospecting for materials, it remained to decide whether it was better to employ him in s imulating resources where they already existed in com parative plenty, or n helping to develop a less fertile area. Possibly he would be able to produce larger absolute results in an area where nature was already kind, as in KhorasPrU. But talking the shorter view, with the due regard to the uncertainty of the Erit sh occupation of East Persia, I have so far been guided more by the im mediate needs of the Force. Therefore instead of sending him to Khorasan where we are able to procure supplies in larger quantities than we can actually transport them elsewhere, or were needed to meet the conditions I had to prepare for, I have begun by sending himtoSistan where the resources though not so plen tiful, lie nearer to the needs of the lower an 1 less fertile part of my Line of Com munication. Here, though serving under the orders of my Assistant Director of Supply and Transport, he co-operates with Mr. Gould, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Sistans and Kain. He is to visit my headquarters shortly to report on any work he ha^ done, and any schemes he may have on foot. I understand that he has already been of use in helping to impress upon the people of Bistan the ad vantage of sa /ing more of their straw, instead of reaping the ears of corn and leav ing the rest to rot. He has also assisted in inducing the owners of transport to l6t their animals out for hire under the Consulate carriage contractor. This from my standpoint is an important part of resource-development. {ix).—Animal Transport. 56. The animals used in transport are camels and equines. The camels for purposes of military transport are divisible into— Camels of Camel Corps. , ^ Hired Camels. Maundage Camels. The two last classes must be sub-divided into those that maintain themselves and those whose owners are entitled by their contracts to buy forage from Supply Depots. The utility of the camel is to be'judged partly from the strictly military standpoint and partly from that of net maundage. It may be roughly stated that these two kinds of utility are met with in inverse ratio. The camel corps camel for instance is specially useful in the military sense for being in an organised corps, maintained under military discipline, he can be used as a baggage animal for troops, marching. On-the other hand the extra care bestowed on him and the extra amount oi stall-feeding that it is found necessary to give him where grazing is scanty, re acts on his useful loads. At the other extreme is the self-maintaining maundage camel who lives on the country, takes nothing from a supply depot, and delivers so many maunds at a certain destination for a fixed price. His owner on the other hand is not am naole to fixed marches oc military discipline in any form, and the animal is therefor useless for convoy work with troops. The others lie between these extremes. The aversion to military restraint is however very marked in the case both hired and of maundage camel-men, whether Persian or Ghilzais, and the formation of organised corps from this material has proved quite impracticable. The Persian camels vary in quality, those in the north being distinctly hardier. The snow has less efiect in impeding their movements than might have been imagined and I have heard of few cases of their getting “ split up ” by slipping in it. They graze too in the snow, picking the tops of thorns that just protrude above it, without falling out of condition.' The shaggy breed from Turkistan is a particularly fine type; others with shorter coats also stand the cold quite well but are provided with numdah-jhools, which they wear whether at work or resting. 57. I cannot gives definite opinion as to the respective merits of the different kinds of Camel Corps. On a priori ground the silladar corps in which the sarwan s pecuniary interests depend on the welfare of his camels, appear the best. In prac tice however more has depended on the personal qualities of the Commander of the Corps and his supervising establishment. The 65th for instance which is a Gov ernment Camel Corps holds its own with the Silladar Units. Where the silladar system does not exist, I consider that the best incentive to keeping camels fit would be a species of “ working pay ” from which a deduction would be made for any animal out of action. On the other hand I bave to check the tendency of some units to nurse their camels, and to insist that the fairly gener ons allowance of ten day s’ rest in thirty for fit animals is not exceeded, there have been many camel-casualties but these on service are always high. As a matter of fact the average condition of the veterans is better than that of recent remoun s. The optimist regards this as indicating that the conditions m East Persia are not too severe. The pessimist attributes it to the survival of the fittest and to bad remounts. 58 The equines are the 63rd Draught Pony Corps, the fourgon horses, the Per sian pack mules and ponies and the Persian donkeys The 63rd Pony &amp;rrP s have done farily well. It was necessary at one time to reduce the work that they were doing while employed on a very bad bit of road between Saindak and Robat. They have*now gone to Sistan to be employed on short tups, near their feeding base, in collecting the forage that the Sistan camels side-load on to the Line of Com- munications. The fourgon is a four horse cart. All four horses ace harnessed abreast. The two outer ones pulling from the back axle. They are generally weeds m appearance and the ancient harness is supplemented with a liberal allowance of stung but a team will pull 25 maunds through the worst bogs or sand drifts and up any gradient Their drivers have been in some cases Russian ex-soldiers ot the old regime specially engaged for me by General Malleson. Three ho ses, two horses, and one-horse carts built like the fourgon have also been employed by me. 59 A great obiection to the use on the main Line of Communication both of fonreons and Army Transport Carts is that this is not a suitable country for solid- wheeled traffic. Unless the roads are thoroughly metalled and rolled they will not as a rule stand hard wheels. A convoy of fourgons doing one trip on a stretch o. compa ratively soft road where regular road metal is unobtainable will cut deep ruts into it and spoil it for Mechanical Transport traffic. For this reason and also on the ground of the very high rate of hire demanded by the owners I have recently arranged to dispense with all fourgon traffic. It was also partly to save the main road on the List of Communication that I sent the 43i d Draught Pony Corps to Sistan. Before they were moved they broke up the road between Samdak and Rnbat so oadiy that it became too heavy even for themselves, not to mention Mechanical Trans port traffic When the fly season begins in Sistan I shall have to find a new field for their activities, but it will not be on any road intended for motor convoys. 60. The Persian donkey carries two maunds and the mule or pack pony three: Thev both are good specimens of their kind. The saddles are of the Eastern Soondkha type, that of the mule being also peaked in front and rear so as to resemole a palan. The Persian is averse to more than a very occasional removal of it from the animal’s back The drivers like the camel-men are not as a rule amenable to mili tary discipline, though in Sistan it has been found possible to organise one troop of hired donkeys. An attempt to use Mesffi di mules as first line transport proved unsuccessful owing to the intractability of the drivers. (x). — Convoys. 61. I have been unable to inaugurate any system of staging or meeting staging convoys owin' to the very large addition to the strength both of troops and supply establishments that would be necessitated by having a regular post at every stage up the 800 miles long line from railhead at Askabad. I hoped at one time however C26GSB42 as already stated, in order to save carriage of forage when troops were marching, to lay, in forage dumps at each stage, each dump to be in charge of a Supply and Transport Agent. This was when it was intended to send troops to Transcaspia from India on a scale since abandoned. If such forage dumps had been practicable and a small garrison had been available at each stage, the ideal system by which trans port marched half way to the next stage, transferred its load to the transport that came from the next post to meet it, and then returned to its own permanent lines would have been introduced. The nearest approaches to a staging system have been the convoys of the Draught Pony Corps between Saindak and Robat, and the present Mechanical Transport convoys. In the former case one-third of the corps worked between Sain dak and the next stage so as to be only away from their quar ters every other night, while tw'o-thirds came down tw*o stages from Robat to meet them and so w ere never more than three nights aw f ay from Robat. In the lattr case the Mechanical Transport convoys, from Hurmuk and Shusp, respectively, meet and stop at Safadan, returning the next day. 62. It is probable that the hired and maundage camel owners w 7 ould in anT case have preferred the system of long convoys which is at present main/y in vogue, and it is certain that no other system would appeal to Persian camel owners, none of wdiom would like to w'ork continuously on a short stretch of line at a distance from their homes, without returning there periodically. (xi).—Losses on Convoys. 63. These have been of two kinds; those due to inevitable defects in packing and those that are culpable. Chief among the former are losses on petrol. As far as I know there is no form of packing for petrol as yet devised that will render it immune from loss en route, and these losses are heavier by road than by rail. Special precautions such as enclosing tins or drums in boxes, wdiile on the on e hand failing to achieve their immediate object, on the other hand to a large extent defeat the ultimate object of economy. For the extra packing material so adds to the bulk that what it is aimed at saving by better packing is lost in the extra ex pense of transport. Losses in petrol are less in Ford Vans than on animal transport owing chiefly to the shorter time en route. Hence I use Ford Vans for this purpose wdien I can. I am hoping that an experiment which I borrowed from the Russians and am now about to try may prove of some use. It is to enclose each drum not in a regular box or crate but with four upright stays of wood joined by cross pieces of wood at top and bottom. The Russian “ Chillaks ” or metal drums travel in this way, on camels, and are saved considerable jolting and jarring with very little increase to the bulk of the package. 64. I intend to get as much ghi as possible up the line before the weather gets hot, for loss on ghi is almost as great as on petrol when once it has liquified. 65. Whenever a culpable loss can be traced to the culprit he or his principal (in the case of a carriage contract) is strictly mulcted and units are made to pay wTien a loss can be brought home to the unit but not to the individual. The system of way-billing from section to section instead of up the line to the ultimate d stina- tion helps to bring home losses to particular carriers, but is not an infallible remedy. For it would only expose articles to greater risk to unpack and repack them at every supply depot and this course can only be resorted to wdth advantage when by loss of weight or outward signs it appears that the package has been tampered with. Hence packages that are apparently intact sometimes pass from hand to hand and are ultimately found with some of their contents removed and extra packing sub stituted. It is highly important for anyone making a contract for carriage to name the local value at the place of loss as the rate at which recoveries are to be effected. For in a country which, like Persia, has a great demand for Indian products, the market value of every import increases wdth every mile of distance from rail head. {xii).—Mechanical Transport. 66. The Mehanical Transport units other than Medical are No. 5 Mechanical Transport Company and the Light Lorry Section. The former consists of Ford ^ ans and the latter of Fiat Lorries. Except for a temporary shortage in India ofFord springs now replaced by Indian made leaves which are still under trial, the replacement of parts has latterly been regular. The same cannot be said of the lorri' S, many of which are now out of action for want of Fiat springs. The system now introduced of maintaining a unit reserve as well as indenting on an “ as required basis ” is the best substitute to the establishement of an advance Mech anical Transport depot at railhead. Formerly the distance from the Mechanical Transport store depot at Rawalpindi, which is the source of supply, was greatly felt. 67. When I arrived in October, I found No. 5 Mechanical Transport had been going through a critical phase. The needs of the force in Transcaspia had ap parently not been foreseen there, and in consequence urgent demands to send up medical and other stores With the utmost speed at any sacrifice of transport were made. The result Was that Ford Vans Were used over a stretch of 500 miles of country on roads not fitted for them, and on my arrival I found the majority of No. 5 Mechanical Transport Company derelicts over a considerable stretch of country. In spite of the advice of Mechanical Transport experts to place the corps out of action for two months, I decided that to get it into working order it would meet the case and at the same time be better for the morale of the establishment to keep half of the unit working, but put every van in turn through a thorough over haul. I simultaneously had every driver who was not employed on road-work put in turn through a “ refresher course ” in driving and petty repairs. Certain delays in the receipt of spare parts* and accidents due to the road being cut up in places and to bad driving have delayed the complete renovation of the vehicles, but the majority are now fit for the road and actually working. Though the driving is now better regulated and I have more labour employed on the Mechanical Trans port convoy road, I do not expect ever bo have more than three quarters of the unit in commission at one time; I at present have about tWo-thirdst It is inevit able where sandy tracts exist and with drivers who from defects of education and temperament are never likely to become thoroughly reliable drivers for accidents to occur With considerable frequency. The best I can hope is to minimise them rather than eliminate them altogether. With the winter snow there has recently been some recrudescence of accidents. For lack of touring cars I am obliged to detail several vans lor touring purposes* allotting two each to sections 3 to 7* for the use of the Administrative Cammandants and local representatives of the directorates. The roads in sections I and 2 are not yet fit for Ford Vans* 68. No* 5 Mechanical Transport Company has since 1 arrived worked from Hurmuk to Shusp. Till late in November the light lorries worked from Juzzak to Hurmuk, but meanwhile the 63rd Draught Pony Corps did so much damage to the road between Saindak and Robat that I abandoned it to them and restricted the run of the light lorries to the short stretch from Juzzak to Saindak. The latter are now resting refitting and awaiting springs. As soon as railhead opens at Duzdap they are to work from Duzdap to Hurmuk. The Ford Vans are divided into two parts, working down from Shusp and up from Hurmuk respectively and meeting at Safadawa on alternate days. The day’s run for each van is 75 miles, which is within the limits laid down for this class of vehicle when calculated at a pace that they have been found capable of maintaining without any risk. 69. A recent influx of Russian petrol from Transcaspia has made it po sible to think seriously of working Ford Vans convoys as far as Meshed when, the road north of Turbat is improved. Petrol could be back-loaded on 'camels in wood- bounded chillaks from Askabad so as to feed the vans that worked downwards. The petrol difficulty has also decreased owing to the improvement of the road along the present Mechanical Transport run. Formerly 10 miles per gallon were all that could be attained but now 15 miles is the average. However in order not to spread a Mechanical Transport unit over a stretch that is too long for efficient control and to provide the requisite workshop establishments three Ford Vans Companies would be necessary to span the whole length from railhead to Meshed. 70. The vehicles that have sufbred most from Persian roads are the Hup- mobile touring cars. At present I have none left in commission, all six being out of action, mostly from want of parts that are awaited. Though liable to get stuck in sand they do well on Persian roads so long as the vital parts hold. But these, C26GSB44 especially the Ctown wheel, are liable to break a&lt;t any moment even with careful driving.' My recent experience of three Ford touring cars has converted me to the view that for touring in East Persia under present conditions the Ford would really be preferable, provided three Fords were taken as rendering the same service as two Hupmobiles. The facts that the main Mechanical Transport unit in East Persia consists of Ford vehicles and that Ford parts are more readily obtainable in India than Hupmobile parts, are further reasons for holding this viewn (xiii).—Trade in relation to Transport. 71. Last autumn, while the whole world was still actually fighting, and the task in front of me was greater than that upon which I am now engaged, I held the obvious view that on no account should imports of merchandise be allowed into East Persia, if they could in any way interfere with my collecting sufficient animal transport for military purposes. The situation in the meantime has chan ged in many ways and I have recognized the,desirability of importing sufficient trade goods to satisfy some of the local demand. I have also been influenced by the fact that, whereas our expenditure in the country has tended to disperse the cash available in the country, there has been no opposite tendency at work to draw it back to the one and only European Bank, and so make it again available for our immediate needs. This opposite tendency can, it appears, best be created by importing goods and so offering Persian traders an inducement to buy rupee- drafts for krans from the Bank. I have also seen how a direct military advantage may accrue, if the import of trade is actually used as a lever for obtaining transport for military purposes. At first sight it seems as if the two interests, those of trade and of military operations, were essentially opposed. But this opposition at once disappears if the supply of a certain quantity of transport for military purposes is made a condition precedent of admitting trade, with the altered military situation there is actually sufficient transport for our requirements as well as for trade, provided our hands are laid on it. And the best way to lay hands on it is to admit a limited amount of trade and allow its onward transportation on the condition that a required quota of trans port is first of all assigned and assured to us for military purposes. This quota consists of the camels required to lift a certain quantity of forage from Sistan to the main Line of Communication, and of :&gt;,000 Birjandi camels require d for work between Shusp and Turbat. Mr, Gould, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Sistan and Kain, has now been given the necessary powers to control trade in this way. His method is in the first place to bind the Sistan traders over to place at the dis posal of the Sistan Maundage contractor sufficient can. els to meet the first part of my demand (both under a money penalty and under that of stopping trade at once if the contract is not fulfilled) ; and at the same time to keep in bond in bonded warehouses, at selected spots, all goods required further west or rorth than Sistan. He will at once suspend the release of these goods from the warehouses if the number of Birjandi camels forthcoming for military needs falls short of 3.000. An essential part of the scheme is that he controls the issue of priority certificates, and so can stop trade at the fountain head if the bargain is not kept. This together with the bonded warehouses appears to give him an effective and unbroken chain of control over the flow of trade as far as Kain, and of local camel transport as far as Turbat. From there northwards there is sufficient animal transport to deal with the residiam of trade that arrives there, wihout affecting the supply of camels for my needs in the same area, CHAPTER III. 1 Medical. (?) Original Medical Dispositions. 72. Prior to October 1918, the only field medical units oh the Line of Communi cation were :— A section 118 I. F. A. at Meshed, C section 140 I. F. A. at Robat, 110 Indian Staging Section at Kacha, and, 111 Indian Staging Section at Birjand.45 A.-118. I. F. A., 110 and 111 Staging Sections each had two British Nursing Orderlies and an A. H. cook in addition to their regular establishment to enable them to treat British sick. 110 Indian Staging Section at Kacha acted as a sort of Base Hospital and Convalescent Depot, and all cases were sent there before evacuation to India. The hospitals at the other parts were run more or less on a peace footing and were in charge of Sub-Assistant Surgeons. Two sections of I. F. A. had been asked foi to be located at Khwash and Dehani Baghi respectively. These arrived at Juzzak on October 14th and were accompanied by No. 12 Advance Depot Medical Stores and half No. 6 Sanitary Section. Lieutenant-Colonel H. Boulton, I.M.S., who had been appointed A. D. M. S:, Line of Communication, arrived at Juzzak on the same date. Prior to and during my visit to Meshed in October statements were drawn up shewing the medical requirements both for Line of Communication and for General Malleson’s Force (the latter in consultation v/ith General Malleson). This as sub sequently modified on the advice of my A. D. M. S. after my return from Meshed is shewn in annexure X. This statement for the Line of Communication was prepared to meet the requirements of a division of Infantry and a Cavalry Brigade beyond Meshed, and on the assumption that all British sick and wounded as well as Indians would be dealt with on this line. In November, after it had been decided that the division was not to be sent from India, further correspondence took place regarding the needs of this theatre in medical units, and this was not finally settled till my second visit to Meshed in December, when after consultation with General Beatty a fresh distribution of unedical units was prepared and accepted by superior authority (annexure XI). {ii) Arrival of new Medical Units.' 73, C and D section 11 I. F. A. which were destined for Ehwash and Dehani Baghi arrived at Juzzak on 14th October 1918. C section was sent to Khwash, and D section, originally intended for Dehani Baghi, was owing to general Malleson’s urgent request for more medical assistance, first ordered to proceed to Meshed, but as the urgency of General Malleson’s needs seemed to have disappeared, it was detained at Turbat to assist in clearing down the line the wounded who were coming down from Meshed in considerable numbers. The Headquarters of half No. 8 Sanitary'Section which arrived at Juzzak at the same time was ordered to Birjand, leaving detachments at each post en route. No. 12 Advance Depot Medical Stores was ordered temporarily to Birjand as being the most central place to supply the needs both of Malmiss Force and Line of Communication. No. 48 C. C. F. A. arrived at Juzzak on 5th November and left to join Malle son’s Force on 18th November. No. 73 I. S. S. arrived at Juzzak on 7th November and remains at railhead. No. 58 C. G. H. arrived at Juzzak on 8th November and at Shusp on 11th December. It was hoped that the buildings which were ordered to be commenced in October would have been ready by the time it arrived, but owing to the difficulty in getting masons and the early arrival of frost sufficient progress had not been made to enable it to open there before its destination was changed to Askabad. It is -now on its way to the latter place. The second half of number 6 Sanitary Section arrived at Juzzak on the same date, 8th November. No 22 B. S. S. arrived at Juzzak on 15th November, and at Meshed on 9th January, 1919. A portion of its establishment has been sent to Kachan and arrived there on 22nd January. No. 21 B. S. S, also arrived at Juzzak on 15th November and remains at railhead. No. 74 I. S. S. arrived at Juzzak on 8th December, and was established at Hurmuk on 23rd December. C26GSBNo. 9 B. S. S. arrived at Juzzak on 29tli November and at Birjand on 14tb January 1919, where it has opened ; a part of its establishment has been sent to Turbat to supplement the personnel of D.-ll I..F. A. Two sections No. 17 C. C. S. S. arrived at Juzzak on 14th January 1919 and are destined for Merv. No. 59 C. G. H, arrived at Juzzak on 22nd January and will proceed to Shusp.. F The present and future location of all Line of Communication medical units is shewn in annexure XII. * {Hi) Ambulance Transport. 74. Up to November 1918 the evacuation of sick and wounded was carried on almost entirly by camel kajawahs. A Vulcan motor ambulance and one Ford ambulance 'were received in January 1917 but they only survived a few months. Two Ford ambulances were also received in March 1918, but one of these soon became broken, and by October 1918 only one was in running order. Intimation was received in October 1918 rhat a section consisting of 15 Ford ambulances was to be constituted as under : 8 from No. 28 M. A. C. at Rawalpindi. 2 from Nushki. 1 from Karachi. 4 already with E. P. C. 6 motor ambulances arrived at Juzzak at the end of October and 3 more early in November, and remained there till the end of November, as it was not considered advisable to start running them until section was complete and had its own Mechanical Transport Officer to look after the cars. The ambulance from Karachi arrived at the end of December. In December, however, it became necessary to use them for evacuation of wounded who had accumulated in Birjand in transit from Meshed to railhead. The convoy has been running from Birjand to Shusp, where it connects with a Ford Van convoy once a week, until ^ fortnight ago, when heavy snow between Birjand and Shusp prevented the cars from running. The unsuitability of Ford ambulances for use in this country owing to the long overhang of the body beyond the back axle has been brought to notice, and there have been numerous breakdowns owing to breakage of springs and axles; in fact except on the first trip from Shusp to Birjand no convoy has arrived without one or more cars breaking down on the road. For this reason in January of this year I advocated the use of Mark 1 Light Ambulance wagons for conveyance of sick and wounded in preference to motor ambu lances Russian fourgons have been used to bring down sick and wounded from Askabad to Birjand, but they are expensive, are very uncomfortable for wounded and cause great damage to the roads. {iv) Sanitation. 75. As previously stated half No. 6 Sanitary Section arrived at Juzzak on 14th October and proceeded up the line on 16th October. Detachments were left at Saindak, Kacha, Robat, Khunik and Shusp, and the Headquarters proceeded to Birjand, where it arrived on November 9th. The second half No. 6 Sanitary Sec tion arrived at Juzzak on November 8th and proceeded up on November 18th, leaving detachments en route, and the remainder were distributed between Birjand Kain, Turbat and Meshed. Major Harold, R.A.M.C., D.A.D.M.S. (Sanitary), arrived at Juzzak on November 15th and was directed to march up to Birjand as I wished to have a report on the sanitary condition of the marching camps, especially on those oft the main motor road. . _He arrived at Birjand on 13th December and his report, as I had anticipated, reveaied a most unsatisfactory sanitary condition of camps and water supplies. Strict orders have been issued that officers commanding convoys will be held responsible that camps are cleaned up before leaving; but without a staff of sweepers at each camp with British ranks to supervise them (an impossibility on a Line oi Communication 800 miles long) the sanitary conditions of the camps cannot be maintained satisfactorily. Arrangements are being made to provide for the chlorination of drinking water. The sanitary condition of the permanent posts has been greatly Improved, but it is impossible to sanitate Persian towns effectively, and for this reason I have arranged at Turbat and Kain for buildings to be constructed at a distance from the town for the-garrisons there, and am having sites examined with a view to doing the same at Birjand. (v) Health of troops. 76. Except for the severe epidemics of influenza which broke out at Khwash at the end of September, and at Saindak, (21 deaths), Kacha (32 deaths), Robat (45 deaths), and Babarahdar (8 deaths) in October-hTovember, and at Dehani Baghi in January 1919, the health of the troops has been extremely good. The epidemic at Khwash started during the last week of September and was of a very virulent type, accounting for 40 deaths out of a garrison of about 200 men. The deaths nearly all occurred in the detachment 98th Infantry, only one occurring in the 41st Cavalry and 2 in the 14th Mule Corps. At Dehani Baghi the disease was first introduced by some Railway Survey khalasis in December 1918. The Levies first became infected, and then the detachment 98th Infantry. Up to date 50 deaths have occurred in the Infantry, 22 in the Levies, and 2 followers. There have been no deaths amongst the 41st Cavalry. CHAPTER IV. Ordnance. 77. Up to the llth September 1918, all Ordnance matters, including the supply of clothing for the force in East Persia, were dealt with by the Supply and Transport Corps. On the 12th September an Ordnance Depot was established at Juzzak to deal with,the needs of the force in this respect. (i) Personnel. 78. The personnel of the Ordnance Depot at Juzzak at first consisted of 8 British ranks, of which 5 were privates of the Army Ordnance Corps with little service and experience of their duties. These men were called upon to perform the duties of group holders, usually carried out by Staff Sergeants or Warrant Offi cers at Arsenals. As in addition sickness prevailed among the establishment at Juzzak, a considerable strain was thrown on the depot to enable it to fulfil its role. In November six Territorial Sergeants and 20 labourers from a labour corps were sent to Juzzak. The work of the depot has however so much increased that it has been necessarv to apply for a further augmentation of the establishment, especially L'the a y epot was formed articles such as mule and camel gear and hosprtal equipment have been transferred to Ordnance Supply. 79 On my representation, a Deputy Assistant Director of Ordnance Stores for the Line of Communication was sanctioned, and Lieutenant (temporary Major) S Chester arrived at Birjand on The 13th December 1918 to assume the duties of this appointment. He had previously been in charge of the depot at Juzzak. 80 I have also applied for the services of 12 Ordnance Sergeants with clerks to deal with ordnance matters at the different depots along the Line of Communi cation At present ordnance stores are kept m charge of Supply and Transport depots, and passed along from section to section by the latter. These articles are thus dealt with by individuals unacquainted with ordnance technique and the results cannot be said to be satisfactory, especially as these depots are msufficmtly equipped with the necessary establishment for dealmg with their own duties.48 (ii) Clothing and stores generally. 81. On my arrival I found that units were indenting variously on their nearest supply depots, on the Ordnance Depot, Juzzak, and on the Arsenal at Quetta for their needs, the result of which was not only confusion but m many eases mrc i e some units getting extra issues, having obtained their requirements , - nearst depot prior to the arrival of stores specially earmarked ror them from Juz ^ or Quetta. This naturally also involved others going without their neecur I issued orders that no indents from units were to be accepted except by tie supply depot nearest their location, the latter indenting on the Juzzak depot foi articles they could not meet from their stocks. At the same tiine I directed th... all packages of ordnance stores arriving at railnead, earmarked for specml uni . , were to have their addresses altered to that of the depot on wnich the unit ra. dependent, the latter would then meet the indents on which the stores bad been sent, if this had not already been met separately from stock m ha ? d - J f same time requested General Malleson to issue similar orders f. they were to indent only on the depot at Meshed. On a long Line * * cation, where a considerable time is taken in moving stores the above appears tne only practicable system to avoid the confusion previously mentioned. ' 82, The force has suffered considerably from lack of warm clothing. T is appears to have been due mainly to the fact that the articles o e o _ mg m queonoi were not in stock in India. Indents for warm clothing for the winter °f 1918-19, though submitted in the summer of 1918, were not complied with m time to enab e the articles to be got up the line before the cold weather set m. Some °f - requirements of the Transcaspia force wired for in November 1918 kwe not yet (January 1919) reach railhead. ; ' , 83. Arrangements are now in train to ensure that there !s a six months reserve of clothing at all depots for the units dependent thereon, and as stocks of cloth.,.,, appear now to be available in India, it is hoped that this will be shortly accom- plished. ' T • * n 84 The apparent absence of clothing in India reacted ^n the Line ot Lorm munication in another manner; detachments, units and reinforcements railhead without their proper complement ol clothing ana having o° drav on w c already scanty stocks on the Line of Communication to meet their needs The departure of the 107th Pioneers from Quetta for the Line of Communication ^ considerably delayed for want of warm clothing, this resulting m a delay m the dote on which the Duzdap-Hurmuk road was finished. ^ 85 Local purchases of such articles as poshteens, socks, mittens have been made to meet deficiencies, but they are neither as serviceable nor as cheap as simil e articles supplied in the usual manner from India. Picks, shovels, anc. mateim s f r repair of paL.s have also been purchased locally. In view of the saving m carriage involved, the local purchase of the latter articles, though at a higher price than n India, is advantageous. . . 86. Owing to high prices which are offered by Persians for articles of Govern ment clothing, there have, I fear, been several cases of suspected sale of cmthing by men moving up the Line of Communication, followed by demands for clothing on the Line for such articles, said not to have been issued at Quetta or at the base. I p a ve had all such suspected cases rigidly followed up, and asked that a system o nesting a clothing statement in each combatant soldier s small book be.introduced. FI clothing page already exists in the case of followers). I have also arranged through the good offices of Persian Governors, for drastic action to be taken against Persians found in possession of Government clothing. 87. Annexure XIII contains four copies of the orders issued on the Line of Communication to regularise issues of clothing. (Hi) Ammunition. 88 During the period under review over 1,000 rounds per gun for the battery in Transcaspia have been sent up the line besides a considerable quantity of small arm ammunition; 700 rounds per rifle have been maintained at Meshed and posts on the Line of Communication. 89. The total quantity of Ordnance stores sent up the line during the period under review is shown in annexure XIV. ^/ 49 jst CHAPTER V. Veterinary. hi !i e i 90. During the period from September 1918 to 15th January 1919 the Veteri- ^ nary establishment was increased from one Veterinary Officer and 17 Veterinary { Asistants to 3 Veterinary Officers and 21 Veterinary Assistants, distributed as [y * follows :— )f The Deputy Assistant Director of Veterinary Services, Line of Communica- * tion, and one Veterinary Officer at Headquarters, Birjand, and a s, Veterinary Officer at railhead. The Veterinary Assistants being s attached to units at the various section headquarters on the Line i of Communication in proportion to the number of animals under 3 treatment. All sick animals at each post or section headquarters being treated in one com bined unit hospital and remain on the strength of the unit. During this period 4,105 animals were treated in hospital; of these 2,749 wefe discharged cured, 351 died or were destroyed (a large precentage of deaths were from surra), and 995 remain under treatment. 91. All animals have been remarkably free from contagious disease, the only serious outbreaks being surra and mange ; the surra was largely confined to Sistan, only sporadic cases occurring on the direct route fom railhead. A large per centage of camels are now affected with mange, but this may be expected at this time of the year. The great majority of casualties amongst animals are from saddle galls and debility, the latter is largely due to shortage of fodder on parts of the line. 92. Some difficulty was experienced for some time in obtaining sufficient sup plies of medicines, but satisfactory arrangements are now being made. ' ^ H CHAPTER VI. Works, (i) Personnel, ~93. In September 1918 the only technical personnel on the Line of Communi cation were:— | {a) A detachment of Sappers and Miners, equal to half a company, (5)/Half the 104th Labour Corps, and, 1 (c) A Public Works Department Officer (Captain Stubbs), who had been sent to report on the Turbat-Meshed road prior to its improvement to Ford Van traffic standard. r At the beginning of October the other half of the 104th Labour Corps arrived, and ! on the 23rd October 1918 the 107th Pioneers. 5 ■ 1 Another Engineer Officer (Lieutenant Alexander) arrived on the 9th October ^ ✓ 1918. Meanwhile sanction had been received to the appointment of Major Paken- ham Walsh, Commanding the detachment of Sappers and Miners, as Assistant i Director of Works, and he took up his duties as such at eadquarters of the Line of ^ Communication at Birjand. 94. The first need was to organise the engineer work on the Line of Communi cation into sections corresponding with the general sectional organisation of the line. Owing to the paucity of engineers it was necessary to draw two officers from the 107th Pioneers for duty as section engineers or assistants to these officers, and elV also use the officers of the Sappers and Miners detachment in the same capacity. | The supervising personnel was still quite inadequate to the work to' be done, ! t especially as it was evident that local labour would have very largely to be em ployed. With the approval of His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed, and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul in Sistan, I availed myself of the services of the Seistan Levy Corps as supervisors of local labour. The Persian officers and C26GSB50 ron-commissioned officers of this corps, both from their knowledge of the people and their language, and the fact that they had been largely drawn from the 106th, a Pioneer Corps, have proved invaluable in this capacity. I am also greatly indebted to the British officers of the Sistan Levy Corps who devoted a great deal of time and trouble in assisting the engineer staff in road-making operations. 95. I drew up a list of the minimum staff of engineers and subordinates con sidered necessary to cope with the road making and building work needed on the Line of Communication, and submitted the same by telegraph on the 11th October. Though I understand my proposals were approved, the establishments asked for have not so far materialised. 96. On the addition to the Line of the Meshed-Askabad section, and the re-organisation, of the line referred to in paragraph 23, the engineer organisation of the line was made to correspond. 97. Captain Sclater, who had acted as engineer on the Meshed-Askabad section under General Malleson previous to this section being taken over by the Line of Communication, was not transferred to the Line of Communications as his services were required in Transcaspia ; I accordingly appointed an officer of the 107th Pioneers as engineer of this section in his place. The drain on the 107th Pioneers for officers as engineers has naturally created difficulties for that regiment. (n) Boad making. 98. Prior to October 1918, the road-making operations carried out consisted of (a) rapid work to improve the worst places on the road between Juzzak and Turbat by working parties of the 98th Infantry, (b) a similarly hurried, but better executed, improvement of the road between Juzzak and Shusp by the Sappers detachment to enable Ford Van traffic to run, and (c) a few miles of good Ford Van road south of Shusp, executed on the initiative of Major Burt, Commanding No. 5 Ford Van Company, whose headquarters were at that place. The first named was, as might be expected from the great length of road to be dealt with and the unskilled nature of the labour employed, little better than scratching here and there and the erection of marks to show the best alignment to be followed.^ Some improvements to roads and bridges on the route to Sistan (off the main line) had also been undertaken with local labour under an officer of the Sistan Levy Corps. 99. At the time of my arrival, it was the intention to continue the railway through Duzdap to Neh. The first need was therefore a connecting road fit for light motor 5 traffic from Duzdap to Hurmuk, to enable Duzdap to be used as a new rail head immediately the line reached that point, which was expected to be by Xmas 1918. As regards road-making generally the policy I indicated to my A. D. W. was that the work and energy expended on roads south of Neh was to be only such as would enable those roads to stand the traffic required of them till April 1919, when the railway was expected to reach Neh, while north of Neh the standard aimed at was to be a good surface road fit, with reasonable maintenance, to stand continuous use by light motors such as Ford Vans and Ford Ambulances. In accordance with the above the 107th Pioneers on arrival -were placed on the new Duzdop-Hurmuk stretch, assisted by half the labour corps, the other half of the labour corps being employed on The new posts at Hurmuk and New Saf dawq (vide paragraph 104) and on carrying out necessary repairs to the Hurmuk-Khunik road, especially a sandy stretch near Mahdeh Karez which required rough metalling, mpe Banper detachment were employed on cutting a new road through a rocky rkffie of hills south of Khunik. The road started by M ijor Burt near Shusp with lopal labour was to be continued by the same agency, while north of Shusp road- making was to be s arted with local labour supervised by officers of the Sistan, Levy Corps, and directed by the section engineer concerned. It was my intention, as soon as the necesasary minimum of work had been done on the railhead-Shusp section, to move the technical troops north for the more serious road-making required there. 100. The decision not to extend the railway beyond Duzdap affected the above arrangements and it was now necessary to aim at the same standard for the road south of Neh as that to the north of it. The necessary instructions were issued and more 4 thorough work taken in hand by the 107th Pioneers. The Duzdap-51 Hurimik road was completed at the beginnmg of January and passed by the Deputy Assistant Director of Mechanical transport as fit for use for mecha- m cal transport. Th first ten miles out of Duzdap run ocei a somewhat soft foun dation and it is the intention, as soon as railhead reaches Duzdap and the roadrollers asked for for the purpose, arrive, to metal this portion with stone locally available. On the completion of the Duzdap section the 107th Pioneers were moved north of Hurmuk to improve the Hurmuk-Safedawa section, cutting a new surface and levelling the corrugations which gave the road previously a wave-like appearance and constituted an undue strain on motor vehicles using it. They are now en^ed on this work and will, as the work is completed, work gradually north wards improving the road as they go. The Sappers completed the new road through the Khunik Pass on the 31st October 1918, and were then moved to bhusp for work on the hospital and other buildings there. North of Shusp work was carred out by local labour as mentioned above. The road between Birjand and Kain was completed by the 22nd December 1918, and anew alignment between Kain and Kidri on the Gunabad route, avoiding the “ pat ” which had been a source of difficulty on this line, completed by the same date. Work had also progressed between Gunabad and Meshed. The difficult Khumari Pass was satisfactorily dealt with by the 20th December 1918, a gang of miners from the turquoise mines north of Nishapur, accustomed to the use of powder, having been obtained through the good offices of His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed, for work on this and on the Mahomed Mirza Pass to the north of it. 101. Previous to the Meshed-Askabad section being taken overby the Line of Communication a good deal of work was done on this road by Captain Sclater, and staff cars were able to run on it early in December. The heavy snow which fell at the latter end of that month did a good deal of damage on this as on other sectors of the fine. Gangs have, however, been kept at work throughout and camel convoy traffic has not up to date been interrupted on any part of the line. 102. Plan “ C ” shows in a diagrammatic form the nature and amount of roadmaking work done during the period under review. (Hi) Buildings. ’03. On my arrival in East Persia I found the accommodation question a cerio'is and urgent one. Troops and services had been housed in Persian houses W from the g owners and situated for the most part m the middle of darty Persian towns Sanitation was in the circumstances difficult if m h imposs,ble. On the other hand the season was already late and the near approach of the winter rams and cold when it would be impossible tomakebreks reducea very cons derably the rnsnbilrv of building operations and made it necessary to concentrate on What was most urgent. South of Turbat, owing to the absence of wood, all buildings Ire roofed with the Persian dome or “ Gumbaz,” a form of arching that is very satisfactory but one that requires good sun dried bricks and specially ski led masons to carry out. Such masons are not obtainable in great quantities and this added to the difficulties before me. The building operations will be taken m order from south to north. 104 Hurmuk .—The construction of a new post at this point was an urgent necessitv It was at the south end of the regular Ford Van run and had to accommo- date a number of British ranks. Further it was necessary to clear out as soon as nossible Robat to Hurmuk. Robat is an eirtremely-unhealthy spot, With bad water, the nearest springs with decent water being 4 miles off. It would, moreover, hf' off the main line as soon as railhead reached Duzdap and I wanted to have it clear bv that date. Hurmuk Was, as far as could be foreseen, a healthy place with soring of good water on the spot. The first need was the erection of hospital buildings, the construction of a large supply depot and permanent arrangements for safoguMding the water supply. For the buildings, masons were at first obtained from Sistan. but on the outbreak of influenza, which raged throughout the southern part of the Line of Communication, these men bolted ; work was then carried on whh a detachment of Labour Corps, and recently the masons ave been induced to return. The water supply was protected by cement casing and covered At present the bulk of the personnel is housed in E. P. tents but it is hoped that build ings will be ready before the advent of the hot weather. Hurmuk not having52 the elevation of other parts of the line has not had the same degree of cold and it has generally been possible to continue brick-making up to date. 105. New Saftdawa. —This place, which is 7 miles south of “ Safidawa” shown on the map, was selected as the half-way station on the 150-mile motor run between Hurmuk and Shusp. Three miles off at the foot of the hills there is a'good Water supply which it is intended to bring by pipes to the post as soon as the arrival of railhead at Duzdap facilitates the transport of these heavy articles. With the arrival of pipe Water it will be possible to erect buildings with “ gumbaz: ” roofs, and it is hoped that this will be done before the hot weather. Meanwhile the accom modation is E. P. Tents with mud-wall protection. 106. Shusp. —This is the highest locality on the Line of Communication main line. It is an elevated plateau, 5,500 feet high, W th a good climate and water supply. It was accordingly selected as the best place for carrying out the policy laid down of limiting evacuations to India as much as possible. A. general hospital is to be located here and there will also be a convalescent depot. I found on arrival that on the initiative of Major Burt, Commanding No. 5 Ford Van Company, buildings for the headquarters of the company including workshops, barracks and officers’ quarters had already been started with local labour and “ gumbaz”' builders and that these buildings were nearly ready. It was necessary to start work on hospital buildings as quickly as possible so as to get as much as was feasible, and in any case, some of the wards, completed before the winter put a stop to building. I accordingly instructed Major Burt, pending appointment of an engineer for the section, to engage as much local labour and “ gumbaz ” build ers as he could and get the maximum number of bricks made. Colonel Boulton, who had been appointed my Assistant Director, Medical, Services, and was follow ing me, Was to select the site and give instructions as to nature of buildings required, when work was to be started without delay. Progress was not however made as quickly as I had hoped and I accordingly gave instructions for the Sapper detach ment as soon as the Khunik pass road had been completed, to be employed on this, hospital till complete. On the advent of snow, instructions were issued that the work was to be continued in stone and lime, both of which Were locally obtainable.. It is hoped that on the arrival of No. 59 General Hospital, now en route, it will be possible to open the hospital there. Meantime other arrangements for making a sanitarium here, including a garden under a gardener sent from Quetta, are in pro gress. 107. Birjand. —Here the personnel, services, hospitals, etc., are all accom modated in Persian buil lings in the tov r n. It was impossible in the short time- available before the cold sets in to do anything but improve the accommodation as I found it. I took stock of the buildings available, reallotted them as appeared best suited to the different services, endeavouring to keep the different services in separate areas so that the head of each service should be responsible for the sani tation of his area, and put improvements in hand, 4 especially to the hospital buildings. His Britannic Majesty’s Consul very kindly vacated the Vice-Consulate building which w'as in the centre of the area we occupied, and made it available for the force. ' Botbmy Assistant Director, Medical Services, and I are very doubtful of the desirability of remaining in the town during the summer, and with the assist ance of His Britannic Majesty’s Vice Consul and the good offices of the Persian Governor,-some sites outside have been selected with good and independent water supplies where it would be possible to build accommodakon as soon as the w’eather permits of it. These sites I am having examined by a Committee and plans drawn up with a view to action being taken should the general situation, on the approach of spring, justify the step. 108. Kain. —Here I found the accommodation similarly situated in the Persian town, but under conditions more insanitary than at Birjand. It was impossible to build new huts for the whole garrison before the winter but I directed the imme diate construction of a hospital building outside the town near the new barracks which had been built last summer for the Sistan Levy Corps. Work was carried on with commendable speed, and the building was completed by the 22nd December 1918. I have here similarly directed the preparation of plans for the construction of complete accommodation for the post outside the town and adjoining the new hospital.53 1 AQ Tmhat —This is a town even more dirty and insanitary than Birjand and . 109, / T j garrison should not be allowed to remain m the town ^ am ’ r.i could be hied Tsaw the Persian Governor, who, I may add has been longer than towards us and obtained from him sanction to use a site outside aiways most 1 small cantonment with an uncontaminated water supply- the town, well suited to a small cantonment immediatel taken to construct He gave me ^ ^ ^ d Ts W ood Id stone are available here, the same diffi- quarters there for tue po- , workins during the winter as further south. culties have not been expenenced h g h | db Marcll to ha17 e accom- Work has and depots Si available on the new site. m ° a u0 jifeW —Here as elsewhere accommodation is provided m b lle d 110. luestwa ’vnkpalthv locality m the summer and last summe. in the town, h ® d ' S n ^™ h t ‘anvas 7 Labour of all kinds is obtainable the garrison had to b f ^^^“^““ecessitate the retention of a garrison in abundance and Aoidd mr^ t wou l d be no difficulty in getting the here during the as SO on as the winter is over, necessary u s erec k referred to above, repairs to hired buildings have 111.

T a 4 - Unr i qi ft instructions were issued for the formation of a Survey 113. In September 1918 Persia which, after a slight modi- &amp;^TXrltoriginany°outlined, is roughly comprised within the following , On^e east to Namak bar thence to iu southward along the meridian T^atfoSude to a point near Ab-i-Garm, and thence along of 5 4 Last longitua L direction to the intersection of longi- f Se ^parallel o^ latitude, and then on to the starting ZS? m *AQm ““ ” 42,000 square miles and is outlined m P (ii) Objects. tt j • ^ructions from the Chief of the General Stafi the objects of the 114.

C26GSB(iv) History of existing waps. 116. It is here, perhaps, convenient to say something of the history of the exist ing maps of the area, the whole of which had been mapped and published, in the form of degree sheets, on a scale of 1 incli=4 miles, ihe materials mom wmch these sheets were compiled varied very much in quality from rapid plane-table sketches on a scale of 1 inch to 8 miles and 1 inch to 4 miles, which were executed by members of the Afghan Boundary Commission about 1885 as they marched tack to India via Bandar Abbas, to road reports and sketches, made by various travellers who have traversed the area from time to time, \vhiie some parts of tne sheets are accurate, others are very sketchy and there are considerable blanks where no survey at all exists. These remarks, however, do not apply to the small portion of Sistan, included in the area which was mapped on a scale of 1 inch to 1 mile during the McMahon Mission 1905-07, and which will not require to be resurveyed on this occasion. There was no regular triangulation in the area, ot which we have any record, except along a small portion of the western edge carried out in connec tion with the Afghan Boundary Commission work, and it had not been connected with the Indian triangulation. 117. It was consequently Colonel Crosthwaite’s first duty to provide accurate points, fixed by triangulation, on which to base the new survey. The nearest triangulation connected with the survey of India is the Baluchistan Longitudinal Series which terminates at Kuh-i-Malik Siah. It would have delayed the work too long to connect this series with the Kain position where it was necessary to begin operations as soon as possible,. Colonel Crosthwaite, therefore, decided to measure a base at Birjand, to observe its astronomical latitude and azimuth and to assume a longitude which could afterwards be revised when there was time to make a connec tion with the Baluchistan Series. All maps produced in the field will be based on this value of Birjand, but when the maps are finally published they will be corrected to the true Indian value of longitude. (v) Scheme of Survey. 118 . Shortly stated, the scheme for-carrying out this Survey was f's follows ■ The area was divided into four sectors, north-west, south-west, north-easr and south-east, by lines running north and south and east and west through a point in the neighbourhood of Birjand which is situated near the centre of the work. Each of these sectors was placed in charge of an officer whose task it was to triangulate his area and get Surveyors to work as soon as he had. provided sulncent points and, eientuauy, to superintend the topographical survey of his sector. Ownng to difficulty of transport it was not possible to arrange for these trian gulation parties and equipment to arrive considerably ahead of the remainder, and surveyors had in consequence to wait to some extent to get triangulation points for their work. (vi) Triangulcdion. 119, B t ' the 14th November a base had been measured, on suitable ground, near Biriand, and triangulation was begun in the north-west sector. On the 25th November similar work was started in the north-east and south-west sectors. and in the south-east sectoi arrived at Birjand. on 17th December, as the officers in cha 'ge of sectors {vii) Topographical Survey. 120. At the present date (15th January 1919)20 Surveyors aye at work and 6 are on their way to the ground allotted to them. _ Most ot these have been concen trated in the north-west and north-east sectors which include the most 'important portions of the area from a military point of view. It is hoped to work eventually UP to an outturn of about 300 square miles per month per man, and though it is rather early to give an estimate yet, it is considered the work may be completed about September this year. (viii) Photo-Litho Section. 121. The Photo-Lithe Section, 1st King George’s Own Sappers and Miners, which v T as placed at the disposal of the party and put in charge of one of the officers of the party, has been at v : ork since its arrival at Juzzak on the 12th October, it has done much useful work of a miscellaneous nature. It is intended to reproduce those sheets through which the more important roads pass leading to the Kain secition and from Birjand to Plain.(ix) Photographs. 122. It is intended to take a series of panorama photographs with the object of giving a useful idea of the nature of the country. A beginning has already been made in this direction. CHAPTER VIII. Finance (i) Finance. 153. The financial problem on the Line of Communications was the one that was the most difficult to solve and has been, and is, a source of considerable anxietj. 124. The amount of cash in circulation in a country adapts itself to the needs of the particular area, and may be said to work round in an endless chain, from t e banks to remunerate labour for the products of such labour thence from the reci pients of. such remuneration to the merchants who supply the oramary neeos ot be. and thence from the merchants back to the banks. It is the function of the nunts to suoply the coins needed to maintain the current of com flowing round m to endless chain at such a volume as will satisfy the needs of the community amor® which it circulates. In the case of a backward and thinly populated area, =ueh 'as East Persia, where the normal wants of the community are small, the stream o f coin flowing round needs only to be a small one and the amount of the total coinage ” cLulatio/adapts itself thereto. If, however, new conditions suddenly appear necessitating a larger stream of coins circulating around, and, as m the case m Persia, distances are so great and means of communication so bad that tne stream cannot be filled up to its new' volume by an increased output of coins from the mints m t reeluired^direction the stream dries up. This is what occurred m East Persia. The actual volume of coins in circulation was adapted to the backward conditions if life prevailing there It was totally insufficient for increased volume ol coinage ^toctor^kfStra activities into country brought about by the advent of Ertoh troops, and the Teheran mint owing to the long distance ana bad mean,, o* bmnmuication in Persia w as unable to fill the void created lhe supply of cash trus disappeared Two factors hastened the drying up of the stream of com. One wkThe stoppage of trade due to military needs absorbing all available trans- .-■r-t r ‘ his was equivalent to a block in the stream, since the merchants having .mm f ' t0 0 e er f 0 labour in return for coins in the hands of the latter tnose coins ceased A A back m the normal manner via the merchant s to the bank Another was b Vcurmnce 0 fa recent famine in the area, the recollection of which induced individuals to hoard their cash against a possible repetition of the anune instead of expending it in purchases from merchants m the towns. This also helped to .stop the circulation of coins and so ary up the stream. ^ 125 The crisis due to absence of coins had been foreseen for some time and suggestions had been put forward to meet it by the minting of Persian coins m India suggestionsnaaDeenp country with good communications would have and so nlhng e \ Oxd - ^ * 3 been taken in time and Indian Sfoi/s^Sh^trytillthe stream circulation reached the volume m.nted passea ... ^ - would have been avertea. It appeared,, Ob^.to the I ndia and no action was taken. It may be mentioned in passing ~ •rvfarq r.rv^irlersble Quantities of krans themselves for their ^nti l^ritisn op-ra tob m to country. ‘ These coins pass in circulation and no action in tins connec tion has been taken by the Persian Government. .. , . , 126 Shortly after my arrival in East Persia I was faced with this crisis, whicn v„,i ken for some time anticipated. The supplyof krans available m the banks in East Persia absolutely ran out The condition. ^Mon^ometo^, tireu^TPtion for the advent in the following spring of a Division plus otner troops, Fntoed to pnrtose of considerable quantities of supplies, the hire of con- 127 The crisis was partially met by the despatch from Indian of 15 lakhs ot Indian rupees in specie of which 5 lakhs were for General Malleson’s political-mission audio for to Line of Communications. It was however the begmmng of January56 before the consignment destined for the north reached Meshed and meanwhile the purchase of supplies had to be stopped and hired transport discharged. 128. In view of the decision not to send the Division, etc., as previouslv intended, the resuits were not as serious as would otherwise have been the case. 1 he a( ^ v ent of the specie referred to, combined with the reduction m requirements, of cash the result oFthe smaller military programme to be carried out m East Persia, relieved the situation, which is still however not without anxiety. 129 Some doubt was felt as to whether the Indian rupee would meet with ready acceptance in East Persia. Approval had been given to the issue of rupees as the equivalent of two kran pieces, a com containing less metallic silver th.m the runee. Probably owing to this, the rupee met with a ready acceptance from the start ' At Birj and a preference was in many cases shown for rupees to p e rsI “ and this was probably due to the fact that merchants trading with Afghanistan were ready to purchase the rupees from the holders at a premium. 30. Lieutenant Colonel S. Swainson, formerly Financial Adviser ^ the Gwie- ral Officer Commanding South Persia, arrived at Birjand on 8th November 191 8 loin my staff in the same capacity. On his arrival the financial situation ^as carefully revised and a budget drawn up based on the demands of the different services 7 to meet the original conditions imposed. It was subsequently revised m the liaht of the revised military programme to be carried out. 13 1 Annexure XVI gives in a tabular statement the disbursements actually made in East Persia from October 1st to December 31st, 1918, and annexure XVII gives a monthly estimate of the anticipated expenditure to_ meet _ the n ew cond tions of future maintenance of a smaller force in East Persia, during the first three months of 1919 , during which the progress of building up stocks, etc., has to be completed. (ii) Audit. 132 Before 1st September 1918 all cask and store accounts of the Supply and Transport Corps, Ordnance Department, Military Works Services and Levies had to be sent do A to India for audit and final adjustment Thrs, of necessity occa sioned some delay in their disposal owing to the time taken up m transit through As In October 1918 it was decided by the Government of India that an inde pendent Account and Audit Officer should be appointed to the Line of Communica tions, with headquarters at Birjand, to undertake and conduct at that place the above mentioned audit as from 1st September 1918. 134 The Accounts and Audit Officer arrived at Birjand early in November 1918 and on arrival of the advance party (from the Field Controller Military Accounts office, Poona) of his establishment, early in December, he opened his office and commenced work on the audit of the accounts which were then so far as he y.a» concerned, 3 months in arrears. The main party of his establishment (from Con troller Military Accounts’ office) arrived m Birjand early in January 1919, .nl he was then able to get his office into full working order. _ The arrears are now being worked off and the work of audit generally is progressing satisfactorily,and should soon be current. . . 135. The location of this office at Birjand, to audit in a central position on the line, will tend to eliminate a good deal of the delays owing to less time being taken up in transit through the post and to speed up audit generally. CHAPTER IX. Ecclesiastical. 136 A Chaplain to the Forces in East Persia (Captain the Reverend N E. Marshall) was appointed in October 1918. He arrived at Juzzak on the 6th Nov ember and reached Birjand on the 3rd December. On the way up he held services at Juzzak and at Shusp, and arranged in communication with the Railway Engineer for a hut to be utilised at Juzzak as a Red Cross Canteen. A special service tor the armistice was held at Juzzak on the 14th November. 137 The Chaplain has regarded his duties as being of a twofold nature meet- ins the spiritual needs of the force and looking after their recreation lam muck indebted to him for the trouble he has taken in both connections Services ime been held regularly since his arrival at Birjand and are well attended. Ikese ser vices were formerly held in the Headquarters Mess, but a suitable room has sinceC26GSB been provided for the purpose. A Soldier’s Club hr,s been started at Birjand and games, boxing gloves, gramophones, etc., are on their way from the Red Cross at Quetta, and the Chaplain has done much to ensure the popularity of the Club as a place of recreation for British ranks in the evenings. Football is played regularly twice a week, in which both officers and men are keenly interested and shooting competitions have been got up. 138. Similar Soldiers’ Clubs are being got up at other stations on the Line of Communications, Meshed, Shusp and Hurmuk. At Meshed a good house has been hired for the purpose. I hope to have similar clubs shortly at all posts on the Line of Communications where there are any British ranks. 139. The shortage of touring cars has prevented the Chaplain touring hitherto as much as I should have wished. I hope to rectify this as soon as possible and 1 anticipate much benefit to British ranks by placing the general management of all clubs in the hands of the Chaplain, as well as by providing for then spmtualneeds by his frequent tours along the line. CHAPTER X. Posts and Telegraphs. (i) Telegraphs. 140. In September 1918 the telegraph system on the Line of Communication under the control of the Assistant Director, Posts and Telegraphs was as follows: Quetta—Railhead .. .. L T. D. Railhead—Robat .. • • Indian Telegraph line under military control. Robat—Sistan .. . • Two lines, one being used for telegraph and the other for telephone. Sistan—Meshed .. .. Persian line, one wire under Russian control. This latter section of the line was shared by ourselves, Russians and Persians includ ing telephone stations, instruments and wires, hours being allotted to each daily, 141. The disposal of telegrams from Sistan northwards was not satisfactory and the following improvements weTe instituted. Car dew vibrators with separa tors were superimposed at every station, thus permitting the working of vibrators as well as Morse without the working of the one interfering with the other. A Cardew vibrator superimposed with a condenser was also put up m Sistan and this allowed us to use vibrator whilst Persians were working Morse, thus giving us extra working time of 4 hours daily—making total 8 working hours. As traffic increased considerably during October between Sistan and Robat another line was required to clear congestion. In order to do this all telephones were superimposed with condensers which enabled us to utilise this second wire for Morse and at the same time not interfering with the use of the telephone. Between Meshed and Askabad a Persian line was used, British operators being employed, and payment made to the Persian Telegraph Department for messages sent. 142. After considerable correspondence an agreement was arrived at with the Russians to take over from them control of the line from Sistan to Meshed and this was done on the 7th December 1918. 6 Russian Telegraphists and offices were t?ken over by us, and we commenced to pay the Russian Telegraphists ana Ghulams from December 1918. Persian line riders had not received their pay for several months and the line from Shusp northwards was consequently in a bad state of renair In view of the probability that we would assume control oi this line, these line riders were induced to patrol, and this section was somewhat improved. Inow that the Sistan-Meshed line has been taken over by us I am arranging to have the whole section repaired ; 4 maintenance parties have already been sent out from different points to do this. 143 A new telegraph line was constructed from Mukhi Surkh to .New Safidawa a nd a telegraph office was opened at the latter place on 5th January 1918. 144 When the railway reaches Duzdap the telegraph line which follows the railway will be extended in order to connect with the existing line between Hur muk and Robat at a point about 5 miles south of Hurmuk; this wil enable the sec tion Juzzak-Robat, and up to point where new line meets the old one, to be dis mantled as it will be no longer required for use. 145. Sanction has been given to construct a new line from Kain to Jumin (Gunabad). For this line I endeavoured to obtain the necessary poles locally butthe nearest obtainable were at Nishtafiin, 89 miles from Kain, were very expensive and could not be delivered for at least three months. Poles were therefore asked for from India. Light bamboo poles are now to be sent from Quetta and other stores for the construction of this new section are on the way. 146. In order to relieve congestion at Sistan a direct line from Hurmuk to Shusp via Girdi and New Safidawa is under consideration, also the possible dupli cation of the line on the section south of Girdi and between Birjand and Shusp, thus creating 2 independent lines between Birjand and railhead. 147. Since September 1918 the following Telegraph Offices have been opened Hurmuk, New Safidawa, Shusp, Bui Khaf, and arrangements are being made to open a Post and Telegraph Office at Askahad. 148. In September 1918 the average number of telegrams being handled at the three principal Telegraph Offices on the line were at Sistan 5$0, Birjand 140, and Meshed, 120 while the present daily traffic is 1,470, 530 and 150 at these places respectively. (ii) Posts. 149. In September mails were carried from railhead to troops of the E.P.C. by camels detailed for that pm pose in ordinary camel convoys, this was a very slow method of delivery and regular deliveries and clearances were not assured. About 1st November 1918 the camel dak services between Juzzak and Robat was badly disorganised and eventually stopped running, owing to so many deaths occurring among the camel sowars from Influenza. 150. Instructions were then given to clear mails from railhead by the first available transport and late)-, for transport carts to carry marl from Saindak to Hurmuk where they were to be taken on to Shusp by Ford Vans carrying 12 maunds a week. Any surplus parcels mail above this amount was taken by the first avail able camel convoy. 151. The Sarhadi camel sowars resumed duty on 1st December 1918 and letter mails are being despatched by them from Juzzak to Hurmuk on every alternate day carrying also small parcels for the'Transeaspia Force. From Hurmuk to Shusp it ds carried on thrice weekly by Ford motor vans. From Shusp to Birjand there is a tri-weekly service by the Sistan Levy Corps sowars who in co-operation with the 41st Cavalry arrange onward desapatch to Turbat-i-Haidari twice weekly. At Turbat-i- Haidari the mails are handed over to the Persian Post Office, the Persian authori ties managing onward despatch t© Meshed and Askabad. The time taken for despatch of letters from railhead onwards is as follows:— Railhead to Hurmuk .. .. .. .. 2 days. Hurmuk to Shusp .. .. .. .. .. 32 hours. Shusp to Birjand .. .. .. . • • • 44 (Mail reaches Headquarters Line of Communication from railhead in 6 days). Birjand to Turbat-i-Haidari .. .. .. 9 days. Under Persian arrangements :— Turbat-hHaidari to Meshed.. .. .. .. 2 Meshed to Askabad .. .. .. .. 5 On arrived of railhead at Duzdap, the time railhead to Hurmuk will be reduced to a. few hours. The Sistan Levy Corps men have proved very useful and reliable in handling mails. There are now on the Line of Communication,one Base Post Office at Juzzak, 13 Second Class Field Post Offices, and 14 Telegraph Offices. 152. With a view to expediting the transmission of mails to Transcaspia from India I put forward in November a proposal to institute a service of motor cycles with side cars, if these could be made available from India. By such service the time from railhead to Meshed could be reduced to five days. W. E. R.

C. Sections. 6. The Line of Communications is purposes into four sections, viz :— Northern Section .. North Central Section South Central Section Southern Section .. both for defence and administration \ .. Meshed to Kain. .. Kain to Shusp. .. Shusp to Hurmuk. ' .. Hwmuk to railhead. divided 7. Branches run out from the Main L. Northern Section to North Central Section South Central Section Southern Section .. of C. as follows : — .. Rui Khaf. .. Nasratabad and to Dehan Baghi. .. Khwash. D. Administrative Commandants. 8. In each section there is an Administrative Commandant, whose functions are as laid down in Field Service Regulations Part II. The authority of Adminis trative Commandants is inclusive of the southern point mentioned in paragraph 6 in each section and exclusive of the northern point, except in the case of the northern section which is Meshed and Kain ' both inclusive and _ the southern section where the actual railhead lies outside the administration of the Inspector General of Communication. 9. Administrative Commandants will make their headquarters normally' at the southern end of their section but must visit every part of their section on the main line at least twice a month and branches once a month. 10. Administrative Commandants are representatives of the Inspector General of Communication and orders issued by them are qnder his authority. 11. Administrative Commandants will decide from time to time the guards? etc., necessary for the purposes mentioned in the Field Service Regulations Part II, Section 12-1 and will issue instructions accordingly to the Officers Commanding posts. When such guards, etc., have to be detailed from defence troops (vide paragraph 1-C.). Administrative Commandants will ascertain from the Officer Commanding posts concerned that the provision of the guards required will not interfere with the execution of orders received by them from the General Officer Commanding, L. of C. Defences. Should this be the case a telegraphic reference will be made to, the Inspector General of Communication before such orders are issued.C26GSB 12. Administrative Commandants will report to the Assistant Quartermaster- General, arrivals in, or departures from, their sections of all individuals, units, or detachments of troops or services and also arrivals at or departures from all posts on their sections. This does not apply to normal movements within a section of troops, transport or services allotted to those sections. 13. Administrative Commandants will not interfere with the care, allotment, distribution, or method of working transport in their sections, for which Section Transport Officers are responsible to the Assistant Director of Supply and Transport. As representatives of The “ Q ” staff they are, however, concerned with the nature of the stores {i.e., supply, medical, works, etc.), being passed up their sections at any time. The proportion of the available maundage to be allotted to the different services will be settled normally by programmes and instructions issued periodically from the Q ” staff at the headquarters of the Inspector General of Communication but in case a situation arises in which a decision has to be made locally on the subject such decision will rest with Administrative Commandants and not with Section Transport Officers. It is also the duty of Ad ministrative Commandants to watch for and report to the Inspector General of Com munication, any cases in which transport appears to be lying-idle, used for private purposes or otherwise employed in an incorrect manner. In order to do this they will however, not take any action which would interfere with the satisfactory fulfilment by Section Transport Officers of their duties, as defined in paragraph 17. E.—Supply and Transport Directorate. 14. The Assistant Director of Supply and Transport is responsible to the Ins pector General of Communication for all supply and transport matters within the L. of C. area as defined in paragraph 1 (6). 15 In each section of the L. of C. there will be two officers, termed the “ Supply Officer of the Section ” (short “ S. 0. S.”) and the Transport Officer of the Section (shortT. 0. S.”) who will be responsible to the Assistant Director of Supply and Transport for all supply and transport matters respectively in their sections, with the exceptions noted in paragraphs 18 and 19. 16. Supply officers of sections will be in charge of all supply depots located within the limits of their sections, which will be as laid down for Administraiive Commandants in paragraph 8. They are responsible that the orders of the Assistant Director of Supply and Transport are carried out at^ all depots in their sections. In accordance with the programme or special instructions of the Assistant Director of Supply and Transport, they will hand over to Transport Officers of Sections supplies properly packed for conveyance up or down the line bv the latter. They will keep at each depot in their Sections ready for inspection bv the Inspector General of Communication, Assistant Director of Supply and Transport, or their representatives the following documents : (u) Daily Statement of stock in hand compared with totals to be built up to. (h\ Dailv Statement of incoming stock with total ifiaundage received from the T. 0. S. or local purchase Officer. (c) Daily Statement of outgoing stock with total maundage ^ handed over to the T. 0. S. for conveyance along the line. (d) Daily Statement of retail issues to troops stationed locally or passing along the line. Sunriv depots will take charge of stores for Ordnance, Works, and other services where special depots for the latter do not exist, and will include such articles in the above statements.. 17 Transport officers of sections are responsible to the Assistant Director , „ 17 - K “^Transport for the discipline, care, and efficiency of the animal of Supply and Dap personnel attached thereto, allotted to their transport J 0 ^^sed and used as to give the maximum weekly t S o'e’age along their sections. The Inspector General of Communication, will62 judge transport officer’s sections chiefly by the ratio which their weekly ton-mileage bears to the amount of transport allotted to them. The allotment of transport to sections will be made by the Assistant Director of Supply and Iransport and revised by him periodically as may be necessary^ Transport will not normally be called on to carry maundage beyond the limits of its section. Troops, individuals, stores., etc., handed over to a T. 0. S. will be conveyed by him to the limits of his section and there handed over to the next T. 0. S. for conveyance to destination. Transport officers of sections are not concerned with the contents of the maundage handed over to them for transit along the line. Transport officers of sections are specially to see that transport (other than 1st line transport Inules which are permanently allotted to units) are not allowed to remain with individuals or troops longer than necessary for the move or purpose for which issued, or that transport is not used for private or any unauthorised purpose. They wall keep the following documents ready for inspection by the Inspector General of Communication, Assistant Director of Supply and Transport or their re presentatives : — \ (a) Daily state of transport in their sections, under headings of (1) numbers doing effective :work., (ii) at periodical rest, (iii) non-effectives showing causes and (iv) short of strength. (b) Daily tonnage taken over from supply depots for conveyance up the line and daily tonnage handed in to the supply depot at the end of the section, up and back tonnage being showm separately. (c) Daily state of troops or units and weight of their baggage, etc., conveyed along their sections, showing numbers and distances. They will telegraph every Monday to the Assistant Director of Supply and Transport a weekly state of the above showing (1) average number of animals employed effectively daily, {ii) average number of in effectives, {Hi) total tonnage received and total handed in to the next section during the preceding week. They are not concerned with the w r orking of the mechanical transport, if any, in their sec tions. Transport officers of sections will keep the defence commander of the sections informed in advance of the normal programme and other movements of transport and convoys in their sections. 18. The Deputy Assistant Director of Transport, Mechanical Transport, will, under the orders of the Assistant Director of Supply and Transport.— (a) Assist in administering the mechanical transport and advise on the technical matters. (b) In respect to mechanical transport convoys perform duties similar to those of the Transport Officer of a section as laid down in para graph 17. (c) when the run traversed by the mechanical transport extends over more than one section, the Deputy Assistant Director of Transport, Mechanical Transport, will be regarded as a T. 0. S., in respect of mechanical transport of each section and place himself in communication with the Administrative Commandant of each. 19. The Deputy Assistant Director, Supply and Transport, local resources and the local purchasing officers. The former will be employed in stimulating in whatever way is practicable, the local production of such articles as are required by the troops and can be produced in areas near to the places where they are required or in areas from which they can be back-loaded on otherwise empty transport. The local purchase;!officer will pursue the same object of saving trans port but will confine himself to making local purchases or arranging contracts with local dealers or the local Government authorities. Both officers will perform their duties directly under the Assistant Director of Supply and Transport. They will both make a careful study of the methods under which trade and cultivation are controlled by the Persian Government and will always consult His Britannic Majesty’s Consulate before taking any steps that might conflict with those methods.20. Should at aiiy point on the L. of C., troops be so grouped that it is expedient to separate the function of storing supplies for their maintenance from that of distributing supplies among them, an officer will be appointed at such locality to perform the latter function and will be termed the Brigade Supply- Officer or the Troops Supply Officer at such locality. His duties will be to receive and check indents, to superintendent the drawing of rations by units, to safeguard the interests of the latter in supply matters, and to be the channel of communica tion between units and the local supply, depot. For administrative purposes he wid be under the orders of the Assistant Director of Supply and Transport but will be under the local or formation commander for purposes of discipline, and be attached to the latters’ staff as adviser in supply matters. When no such officer is unpointed units will indent direct for rations on supply depots and deal direct with the officer in charge of the depot. F ,— Medical Directorate. 21.

In each section there will be an officer termed the section engineer, who will be responsible to the Assistant Director of Works for Works Services within his section. The Assistant Director of Works will decide with reference to the amount of work to the done whether the post which forms the meeting point of two sections shall be in change of the engineer of the section to the north or of that to the touth of the post in question. 25. Technical and other troops employed on works are not under the com mand of officers of the works directorate except as regards application of the labour provided by their units, regarding which the instructions of these officers will be carried out. i 26. Applications for new buildings or hire of accommodation will be submitted to the Administrative Commandant of the section and not direct to the section engineer. If approved instructions for the provision or construction of the accom modation or building needed will be issued by the Administrative Commandant concerned to the section engineer. The section engineer will then prepare estimates which he will submit to his Directorate for approval and final submission to the Inspector General of Com munication for sanction. In cases of urgency the Officer Commanding Post may assume the sanctioning powers of the Administrative Commandant, but he must immediately inform the latter of his action explaining fully the urgency of the case. Applications for repairs or minor alterations will be submitted direct to the section engineer. 27. Officers Commanding posts are empowered to make payments from their imprest accounts (paragraph 66) on behalf of the Works Directorate if desired to do so by the latter. Each such payment will be supported by a written request from the Assistant Director of Works or Staff Engineeer to make the payment. Rents for buildings should usually be paid m this manner to ensure64 that landlords receive their payments punctually on the dates stipulated, and that the latter shall feel that there is an individual actually on the spot from whom they will receive their rents. The Works Directorate must keep Officers Command ing posts informed ahead of the demands for such payments that will be made on them in order to prepare their forecasts. » - II.—Veterinary Directorate. 23.

Indents for clothing and ordnance stores will be submitted in the firs* instance by units to the nearest supply depot if no ordnance depot exists at the locality in question. J .—-Postal and Telegraph Services. 32. An Assistant Director, Posts and Telegraphs controls these postal and tele - graph services on the Lines of Communication and complaints regarding these services should be addressed to this officer. 33. On arrival in the Line of Communication area officers, detached indivi duals, and Officers Commanding on behalf of their units, will keep the Base post master informed of their location on the Lines of Communication. The location of the Base Post Office should be ascertained from the Administrative Comman dant, Southern. CHAPTER II. Discipline. A. — General. 34. Officers are to remember and to impress upon their subordinates that Persia is a friendly country and the inhabitants are on all occasions to be treated accordingly. Officials of the Persian Government are to be treated with civility and those of rank with the respect due thereto. In case of disputes officers are in no circumstances to take the law into their own hands but to refer at once to a British Consular Officer, if present, otherwise to Line of Communications’ Head quarters at Birjand. Mosques and places of worship are not to be entered by any one not professing the Mussalman religion, and the religious feelings andprejud ces of the inhabitants are to be scrupulously respected. All ranks should endeavour to ensure that when the time comes for the force to leave Persia, this shall be a matter of regret and not the reverse to the inhabitants. 35. Attention is to be paid by all ranks to such elementary principles of di- eipline as correctness of dress and demeanour, smartness in saluting, and punc tuality .unless officers are themselves blann less in these particulars they cannot maintain discipline among those wdio are under their orders. Commanding Officers may issue their own orders regarding the Wearing of shorts or stockings or thediscarding of coats and ties, but slacks are not to be worn by officers except for purely office work, travelling by car, when on the sick list, or after 6 p.m. and the belt is always to be worn when on outdoor duty or when outside the area of the post, when the coat is discarded badges of rank must be worn on the shirt. 36. Disciplinary powers are vested in the Inspector General of Communica tion, and General Officer Commanding, Line of Communications Defences as re gards troops and followers serving under their orders respectively and proceedings of courts-martial will be submitted accordingly to the Staff Captain, Communica tions, or Deputy Assistant Adjutant and Quartermaster-General Defences ac cordingly. 37. Administrative Commandants are responsible that proper post adminis trative standing orders are drawn up for each post in their sections. These stand ing orders will deal with discipline, bounds, police, and generally matters referred to in Section 12 Field Service Regulations, Part II. In making arrangements re garding Water supply any rights which the inhabitants have to a share of the water require to be legislated for. B. Water. 38. No structional alterations are to be made to the water supply of any post without reference to the section engineer as this may result in disappearance of the water supply. C. Roads. 39. Officers Commanding units, or in charge of convoys, are responsible that no obstructions, dead animals, stores, etc., are left on the roadway. D. Medical and Sanitation. 40. The attention of all parties before commencing a march must be drawn to rules laid down in Field Service Regulations, Part II regarding sanitation of camping grounds, special attention being drawn to source and surroundings of water supply for drinking at the various halting places on the Line of Communications. Parties on the march are not to occupy buildings in villages but to pitch tents at some distance therefrom, except where accommodation in houses has been arranged for by the Consular Authorities. In such cases an official has been appointed to meet parties and show them the accommodation provided and will have a docu ment containing orders to be observed in this connection. 41. First field dressings are only intended for dressing wounds, Officers Com manding posts and units should periodically inspect first field dressings and take disciplinary action in the case of any found lost or opened. 42. Officers Commanding posts will not move medical personnel from one post to another. Should a military emergency arise necessitating this without reference to the section medical officer, the fact should be reported by telegram both to the latter and Assistant Director, Medical Services. E. Veterinary. ^ 43. Veterinary personnel should not be moved from the posts to which allotted except in case of great emergency which should be telegraphed to the Deputy, Assistant Director, Veterinary Services. F. Censorship. 44. All parcels dispatched to India by members of the force other than officers, will be censored by unit commanders or heads of services on the spot who will franx the label. All ranks will be warned that attempts to send Government property to India by private means or without authority through the post, will be severely dealt wdth. G. Transport. 45. The Inspector General of Communications and General Officer Command ing Defences desire to impress upon all officers serving under their respec.ive C2bGSB66 commands the fact that the transport problem on a road line of communication 600 miles in length is a very difficult one and demands the loyal co-operation of all ranks with the transport authorities to ensure that the maundage moved up of the line is the maximum obtainable without causing breakdowns of transport. Any case which comes to their notice of wilful waste of transport carrying power will be dealt with under section 4, Army Act or Section 39, India Army Act, as an act imperilling the success of His Majesty’s forces in the field. 46. Commanding officers are responsible that transport allotted to them is no*' overloaded. They should examine and we : gh mens kits to ensure that the authorised weight is not exceeded. Troops are required to lay out their baggage themselves in suitable loads and not call upon transport drivers to perform this duty for them though with camel transport the sarwans will do the actual load ing. Baggage guards are to give assistance to drivers when loads fall off. The Officer Commanding a convoy is responsible that march discipline is maintained and that there is no straggling. 47. Other traffic must give way to lorries and vans so as to leave them the centre of the road. Where the nature of the ground admits animal drawn vehicles are to march alongside the road instead of upon it, if the road is one that is also used by mechanical transport so that the surface is not cut up. Camels should march on the road as their passage improves the surface for mechanical transport. 48. No one except a mechanical transport officer, or mechanical transport driver is to drive a military car or other mechanical transport vehicle. Officers using cars or vans are to check any tendency of drivers to drive carelessly and are to report any such cases to the Assistant Director, Supply and Transport. Going slow over transverse ruts or dips is to be specially insisted upon. The authorised load for a mechanical transport vehicle is not to be exceeded, that for a Ford Van being 7 maunds plus driver and 1 passenger if any, and of a Hupmobile touring car 8 maunds plus the driver, the weight of each passenger at 2 maunds and the drivers kit at 1 maund being taken as part of the 8 maunds. ; CHAPTER III.

All Kajawahs, both “ Pindi ” and “ Jolly,” form part of the medical equipment of the force ; they are not to be used without permission of a medical o&amp;eer, and any in possession of Supply Agents Civilian Clerks or others, are to be handed over to the nearest medical post. 55. The responsibility for carrying out recommendations on medical and sani tary matters made by medical officers rests, under the Administrative Comman dants of sections, with Officers Commanding Posts. Sanitary detachments at posts will be placed under the medical officer or subordinate in medical charge of the post. E. Veterinary. 56. Serais and other buildings used by non-Government animals, and water from “ Karezes ” should be avoided with the object of preventing contagious diseases. Clean fresh camping grounds should be selected wherever possible and Government animals not allowed to mix with country ones. 57. Whenever buildings or enclosures are taken over for permanent use by Government animals they should be disinfected by clearing away all removeable dirt, washing wood stone or bricks with disinfectants, and scraping earth work, and burning litter, afterwards applying limewash, when procurable. F. Supply. 58. A short issue of rations on a particular day due to shortage of stock, does not entitle the drawer to an over issue on a subsequent date. A supply officer isauthorized to refuse compliance with a payment indent if, in his opinion, the quantity demanded is in excess of the indenting party’s immediate requirements, or if the stock would be unduly reduced by the issue. Rations should be drawn on the printed ration indent forms. Payment indents of other ranks will not be complied with unless countersigned by an officer.- Payment issues to Indian other ranks are not permitted now that their scale of free rations has been increased. Parties or individuals who are entitled to free rations must be provided with a last ration certificate on leaving one post for another. If they submit an indent for free rations on arrival at the new post without presenting their last ration certi ficate, the required rations will be issued, but the supply officer issuing them will report the case to the Assistant Director, Supply and Transport, 59. Officers Commanding parties proceeding on the line of march will be pro vided by the supply officer at the starting point with funds for the purchase of wood, meat on hoof and fresh vegetables. They will hand in the unexpended balance at destination with an account showing. (a) Name of individual from which and where advance was obtained. (b) That the quantities purchased were within the authorized scale. (c) That the money expended has actually been paid to the vendors by the officer.. {d) That the rates were those laid down by the consular authorities men tioned in paragraph 60, or, in the absence of such rates, were ap proved by the officer. 60. Arrangements have been made by the Inspector General of Communica tions with the Consular authorities for an individual to be appointed, as far as possible, at each stage who is to act as the medium between individuals or detach ments and the inhabitants for procuring local supplies. This individual will have a paper showing his position and the rates that are to be paid to him for the vari ous articles procurable locally. 61 ► Complaints regarding shortages in issues, qualities of rations issued, or delay in issuing, should be referred, in the first instance, to the Supply Officer of the section. If the action taken does not satisfy the indenting officer, he can then refer the matter through the local commander. G. Transport. 62. Rations are on no account to be hoarded, sold, or given away. Any that are not consumed on the date for which they were drawn are either to be returned to a Supply Depot or to be treated as part of the rations for the following day, the quantity subsequently drawn being reduced accordingly. Packing material should all normally be returned to a supply depot at the time when a new lot of rations are drawn, failure to return any part of it being explained to the supply officers concerned. Supply Officers have orders to report any unexplained shortage in the quantities that they receive back. Provided that Commanding Officers render this explanation, they may apply tins, packing cases, etc., in small quantities, to purposes of strictly military utility, such as construction of office furniture. When hutting at a post where there is no supply depot they should leave their packing material behind them if to do so economises transport but should inform the next supply depot on their route of their having done so. Whenever packing cases have to be used as firewood, they are to be treated as part of the fuel ration, a corresponding reduction being made in the quantity of firewood drawn or pur chased. Troops or transport units that gather or bring in fuel, grass or any other article, do not on that account establish any lien upon what is brought in. They become entitled to no greater proportion of it than is due to them as their owrt ration, nor can they claim any remuneration in money or kind. - 63. Staff touring cars and Ford vans for touring purposes, are arranged for by the Assistant Quartermaster-General. To each section there will be normally allotted two Ford vans in charge of the Administrative Commandant of each sec tion for touring officers. These should normally suffice for the tours along the69 K section of himself, and the supply, transport, medical, and engineer officers of the section. Programmes will be arranged by Administrative Commandants m con sultation with the officers named so that the needs of all are provided tor. liiese vans will be exchanged fortnightly by the Deputy Assistant Director Iransport (Mechanical Transport) for overhaul Officers on or attached to the statt ot tire Inspector General of Communication and General Officer Commanding, Line ot Communication Defences, will submit their proposed tour programme a fortnig in advance to the Assistant Quartermaster-General or Deputy Assistant Adju tant and Quartermaster-General, Defences, respectively, m order that motor transport may be arranged for them. Owing to the shortage of such transport^ no officer can expect more than one Ford van for himself, his servant, and bag ? ag . If less than a fortnight’s notice is given, the urgency of the case must be explained. H. War Diaries. fi o_ a w ar Diaries will be forwarded monthly to the Assistant Quartermaster- Genertl clmuSons,.or Deputy Assistant Adjutant and Quartermaster- General, Defences, respectivelv. CHAPTER IV. Accounts. A. Post Funds. 64. Officers Commanding Posts will have two imprest accounts. (i) Account ‘ A ’ (General Staff, hitherto known as the Secret Service Fund.) (ii) Account ‘ B ’ (Administrative hitherto known as the Miscellaneous Account). Instructions regarding expenditure to be debited to Account A will e issued by the General Stall, Defences, to whom the account will be su mi e lonthly. fifi To Account ‘ B ’ will be debited advances of pay, expenditure on account ions reference to the As ^ this, sanction must be applied for, if necessary :em the cost of which w incurred.

C26GSB70. When the Officer Commanding, a unit or post, or the Head of an Adminis trative Service requires an advance from the Field Treasure Chest, for the payment of a unit, establishment, imprest for Accounts ‘ A ’ or ' B,’ for any other purpose, he should forward to the F. C. T. 0. a receipt in duplicate (I. H. F. A-175), for the amount required, clearly stating the individual to whom the payment is to be made. 71. Personal advances of pay not exceeding -f-ths of the gross amount due, may be drawn by officers from a Field Treasure Chest oh a receipt, in triplicate, together with a certificate testifying to the fact that they have sufficient pay, etc. with the Deputy Director Ordnance to cover the advance. This certificate will be in the form given in Appendix I. C. Payments to troops and detachments. 72. Company etc., commanders will see that records are made of all payments m an acquittance roll (Army Form N-1513) and in the soldier’s pay book (A. B.-64), Officers are to be caref ul to enter all advances made to soldiers in their pay books. Three copies of the acquittance roll will be maintained and numbered con secutively throughout the year. The receipt of each soldier concerned will be taken on the acquittance roll, and Officers Commanding will forward Cash Acc ounts on Army Form N-1531-A, together with the acquittance rolls in duplicate for the amounts disbursed, to the Assistant Audit Officer (Imprest Section) Quetta, direct, together also with any necessary extracts from the month’s regimental or other orders affecting pay or allowances as promptly as possible, as opportunity offers, during the month, the triplicate copy remaining as an office copy. But if the advance was made by a Post Commander three copies of the acquittance roll will be made by him, original will be attached to the Post Commanders Account ‘ B ’ (paragraph 66), duplicate copy will be sent to the head of the individual’s, unit or department for inclusion in his acquittance roll (Army Form N-1513), and the triplicate will be the Post Commander’s copy. 73. Company etc., Commanders will render to the F. D. 0. as soon as possible after the end of each month an account on Army Form N-1531 of all cash received and disbursements made during the month through their unit commanders. Nil reports should be furnished if no payments have been made during the month. 74. No payments will be made to any soldier without the production of his pay book, wherein all payments made will be recorded and attested by the officers making them. If a soldier loses his pay book, a new one will, if possible, be issued, but no payments will be made in respect of any period prior to the date on which the loss of the book is reported. This applies to civilian subordinates as well. 75. Payments made to any individuals for any service whatsoever will be made in the presence of a British Officer. The practice of handing over money to subordinates for distribution is prohibited. APPENDIX I. Application for an ordinary advance oj pay.

Review oj transport situation and jorecast of transport requirements. Paragraph one. —Continuation my telegram No 24-1 Q of 11th. Following is brief review of transport situation and forecast of transport requirements to solve problem set in my instructions. Paragraph two. —Calculations are based on assumption that problem in detai^ is as follows. One. Maintenance of present defence troops on Line of Communication- Two. Maintenance of Line of Comunication units including transport. Three. Main tenance of present Malmiss force which till I can see Gene al Malleson and discuss matter is taken at present figure of one thousand maunds weekly. Four. Provision for occasional movement of troops along Line of Communication and movements of stores and personnel for improvement of roads and organisation of line. Five. Building up without delay stocks at depots on Line of Comunication to one months reserves for existing troops and services on Line of Communication. Six. Further building up of depots on Line of Comunication so that by April first they shall contain, (a.) One months reserves for Line of Communication troops increased to one cavalry and one infantry brigade plus, (b.) Supplies for passage along Line of Communication of one division with one cavalry and one artillery brigade extra plus (c.) One months reserves for force mentioned in (b) at advance depot Meshed. Further that railhead will be at Juzzak till Xmas and thereafter at Duzdap. For reasons given in para, eleven railway cannot be counted on further north than Duzdap in time to be of appreciable use in building up depots and reserves mentioned by April first. Paragraph three. —In present calculations for purposes of comparison the con sumption of transport energy is expressed in similar terms viz Week ton miles or number of tons per week multiplied by distance lifted. In case of items one two and three of para, two the wtm consumption is a uniformly recurring one. For item four a Weekly average is estimated over the period dealt with. In items five and six the total ton mileage has to be divided by the number of Weeks available to obtain corresponding wtm figure. Paragraph four. —While railhead is at Juzzak the wtm consumption of item one is 13,000. of item two 19,000. of item three 24,000, or totaled uniformly recurring items 5g’ooO. With railhead at Duzdap the figures are 11,000, 19,000 and 21,000 or total 51 000. Move of Pioneers and Labour Corps from near railhead w'here their wtm consumption is small to beyond Kain where their wtm consumption is much greater accounts for no reduction in item tw'o. Average of item four over period to April first estimated at 4,000 wtm. In items one and two the reduction in wtm consumption due to units being located in areas where part of their requirements can be met either locally or free of wtm expenditure by utilisation of back loads has been allowed for. Item two includes fuel etc for mechanical transpo-t. also supplies for animal transport where locality does not allow of these being obtained free of wtm expenditure. Paragraph jive. —Items five and six (a), (b) and (c) of para two involve carriage from railhead of 466; 1,430; 2.343 ; and 1,440 tons respectively. These figures have to be multiplied by mileage 4 o points required from the railhead involved and divided by the number of wttks available to reduce them to wtm. Paragraph six. —Following are figures for wtm producing capacity of transport either actually on Line of Communication or expected by Ncvember first. Pack mules-beiim (nil) allotted as first line transport doing no useful maintenance work. No. 63 pony draught Corps 4,300. 46 troops Government Camels less 13 troops em- ploved on other than useful maintenance work 24,700. Hired camels. Meshedi 1,500 Birjandi 2,000 Hutchinsons 600 Quetta 650 total hired camels 4,750 with 23,750 wtm, capacity. No 5 Ford Van Coy calculated at half is sixty van capacity owing to its bad condition 3,000 wtm. South Persia Ford Van Section nil as will be employed as attached section to No. 5 to relieve latter of all nomuseful duties for which percentage vehicles always requried. No 2 M.T Coy 6,000. Maundage con tract Badimdad 4,400. Maundage contract Sunder Lai 3,800. Total gross wtm producing capacity of transport expected to be working on Nov first 70,000 wtm. Gross capacity is taken as this is constant for same class of animals or vehicle where- ever employed whereas wtm consumed by transport for own maintenance varies with locality employed and is therefore allowed for separately and included in figures in paragraph four.72 Paratraph mw.—Following additional transport has been promised. 3,000 extra Quetta hired camels by December and three Ford Van Coys by February. Itm capacity of former 15,000 and latter 18,000. Their arrival Will involve an addition of 4,500 wtm item two para four for own maintenance provided Fords a e not employed above Shusp beyond which so long as accessible railhead is still Duzdap wtm consumption of mechanical transport for own maintenance becomes excessive. Paraqraph mR—From above figures it Will be seen that until Xmas With rail head still at Juzzak the available wfm from Nov first 70,000 exceeds the wtm con sumption of items one to four inclusive by 10,000. After Xmas with railhead at Duzdap this surplus becomes 15,000. To this has to be added wtm obtainable from transport Mentioned in para seven. Taking Fords as worth 11,000 average instead of 18,000 owing to not arriving till February and deducting 4,500 for own wtm consumption the nett additional available from Xmas to April first is 21 500. To cope with items five and six therefore 10,000 are available from November first to Xmas and 36,500 from Xmas to April first. The totaJ ton mileage of item five is 92,600. During seven weeks from November first to Xmas the available 10,000 wtm will absorb 70,000 ton miles of this, leaving 22,600 to be added to the total of item six for absorption between Xmas and April first, i he total ton mileage of the three sub items of item six based on the Duzdap railhead is 1504,000. The balance of 22,600 of item five reduced to the new railhead is 19 600. The total ton mileage to be lifted therefore between Xmas and April nrs is 1523,600 or a weekly ton mileage or wtm of 1,09,500. To meet this there is m .sight 36,500 wtm leaving an additional 73,000 wtm to be provided if the programme as set forth in para 2 is to be carried out. Paragraph mne.—Taking the wtm value of a Government Camel at six and one quarter, a hired camel at five, and Ford Van at fifty the above means that m order to complete the programme named by April the following transport will be required on the Line of Communication additional to that mentioned in para six &amp; seven to work from Xmas to April first viz either 11,680 Government or 14,600 nired camels, or 1,460 Ford Vans or sufficient of each to bring their total wtm capacity to 73,000. Paraqraph ten. —I will report as soon as possible what number of additional animals is likely to be procurable locally to meet the above deficit. I will also endeavour to ensure by stringent orders that the percentage of non usefully emplo yed camels, which as shown in para seven is high, is reduced to a minimum. Iho railway Survey Who appear to use transport on a somewhat lavish scale are responsible for the majority of the non useful thirteen troops mentioned m para seven. Donkeys are now largely used for bringing supplies from Sistan to points on mam Line of Communication and thus reducing other wtm expenditure. An endeavour will be made to utilise more fully this form of transport. Paragraph eleven. —As will be seen from the above review my task is made much heavier by the fact that the railway in advancing to Neh follows a route diverging so much from the present road. No.th of Duzdap the road and railway will be separated by a range of hills. The first practicable connection would be along the route runn ing east from Dehani Baghi and meeting the main road about twenty five miles, no. th of Hurmuk. But a road connection along this line to the railway three miles, east of Dehani Baghi would give no total reduction in road distance above railhead. It would be simply swinging the tail of the road Line of Communication westwards. North of this there is no cross connect on until the neighbourhood ofMahdeh Karez is reached which does not involve an expenditure of energy out of all proportion to the reduction of road length obtained. The railway cannot reach the latitude of Madeh Karez in time for this connection to be of material assistance in solving my problem and the railway north of Duzdap has therefor been neglected in my calculations which deal only with preparations for the situation next April, not with the maintenance of the division etc at Meshed thereafter for which the railway above Duzdap w*ould come into play. The selected railway route is no doubt the best from a railway point of view but if the primary object of the extension is to serve military needs a reconsideration of the decision not to follow the line of the present road would appear desirable. Once the valley at Hurmuk is passed the route lies along a flat plain and water difficulties should not be greater than those between Dalbandin and Juzzak. Paragraph twelve. —My calculations are based on recognised rules for working all forms of transport and any details of the figures required can be sent.ANNEXUHE III. General instructions for moving stores up and down the line of Com munications. A. —Upward movements of stores. 1. The respective functions of the Administrative Commandant (A. C.), the Section Supply Officer (S. 0. S.) and the Section Transport Officer (T. 0. S.) in each section as regards moving stores up the Line of Communications are as follows :— (i) The T. 0. S. will intimate to the A. C. every Thursday the total carrying power he will have available during the forthcoming weeks for moving stores up the section. (ii) The A. C. will allot the'carrying power so available to different pur poses in accordance with the instructions contained in the subse quent paragraphs and tables. (in) The S. 0. S. will hand over stores accordingly to the T. 0. S. for con veyance up the section, a full detail accompanying each convoy. 2. In allotting carrying power A. C.’s will allot the amounts shown in table A. (stores of primary importance) first, and will then allot the surplus to items of secondary importance in accordance with the order of priority given in Table B., the whole of the available stock of any one item being provided with tonnage before any tonnage is allotted to an item lower on the list. If any of the articles shown in Table A are not available at the starting depot, (i.e., that at the south end of the section) the amount of the tonnage laid down for such articles will be added to the surplus available for articles of secondary importance. 3. The transport allotted by the A. D. S. and T. to the T. 0. S.’s of sections will be varied from time to time to ensue that (i) tonnage is always available for articles of primary importance (Table A) and that the surplus is such as to ensure a proper flow up the L. of C. of articles of secondary importance (Table B). 4. The D. A. D. T. M. T. will be regarded as the T. 0. S. of both the southern and south central sections as regards the mechanical transport employed in those sections. 5. Convoys will leave the bases of the several sections on dates which will be fixed for each section by the A. D. S. and T. so that as far as possible the T. 0. S. of one section may despatch a convoy with the least possible delay after the arrival of a convoy from the section next below. 6. The Supply depot (and ordnance and other depots if they exist) at the base of each section will be regarded as dumps for stores that are passed from section to section. Table A. shows in every case more stores coming into a section than have to be passed out of it into the next section. This excess represents the quan tity which will enable the S. 0. S. who receives it to meet the needs of his own section, and to ensure such needs being met even when no reserve stores for stock ing depots (table B. 6. 7. 8.) come up. 7. Until the stock at Robat is cleared to Hurmuk, which must be done as speedily as possible, the stores at Robat will be regarded as part of the base depot of the south central section for the purpose of sending stores up the line. Baba- rahdar and Khunik must also be emptied into Safadawa and Shusp respectively as quickly as possible. B. —Downward movement of stores. 8. All transport moving down the line is to be as far as possible back loaded with supplies for stocking depots with such articles as are procurable in the fertile areas in the north and to the east of the L. of C. and so save carriage of such articles up the line. The transport thus employed may even on occasions exceed that required for forward movements. Detailed orders as to the nature of such articles will be issued by the A. D. S. and T. to S. 0. S.’s of sections who Mill hand over such C26GSB . .74 articles to the T. 0. S’s affected for downward conveyance .accordingly. Before despatching such downward convoys the T - 0* W1 h ascertain from the A. C. whether he wishes to despatch by it any loads other than supplies For the pur poses of back loading from Meshed, the 0. C. Advanced Supply Depot and e 0. C. L. of C. Transport there will be regarded as a S. 0. S. and a T. O. S. respec tively. * Birjand ; November 5th, 1918. F. ETHERIDGE, Lieut.-Colonel, A. Q. M. G., Communications. TABLE A.

Line of Communications East Persia. 1. The data and calculations on which the figures given below are based are given in the set of tables attached. 2. The problem to be solved is assumed to be the following. Recurring Items. Item No. f. —Maintenance of the Line of Communication Defence troops at present strength. Item 2(a). —Maintenance of Line of Communication Units, including trans port. Item 2(6).—Supply of petrol and lubricants for mechanical transport. Item 3.—Maintenance of Malmiss Force at present strength including additional cavalry now en route. Item 4. —Provision for movements along Line of Communications of re inforcements officers and parties and movements in connection with organisation and improvement of Line of Communications. Non recurring items. Item 5(a). —Movement up to Meshed of articles required to make up leeway in General Malleson’s needs. Item 5(b). —Completing depots on Line of Communications to one months reserves for present strength of Line of Communications Units. [Above to be carried out without delay, preference to 5(a).] Item 6 .—Increasing stocks at all depots so that by April 1st they shall contain— (a) One month’s reserves for Line of Communications Troops increased to 1 Infantry and 1 Cavalry Brigade. (b) Supplies for the passage along Line of Communication of one Divi sion plus 1 Cavalry and 1 Artillery Brigade. (c) One month’s reserves at the advance depot, Meshed, for the force mention in (b) above. The calculations for all of the above are shown in the tables attached except item 4. Tnis is now estimated at an average weekly ton mileage of 5,000 instead of 4,000 as given in my telegram 24-2-Q, of October 11th, as movements of the nature dealt with show an increase on what was anticipated when my original forecast was made out. 3. The problem has to be dealt with separately for the two periods, present time until Christmas 1918, when the new railhead is expected to be opened at Duzdap, and X’mas 1918 till April 1st 1919 with railhead at Duzdap. For the reasons given in my telegram quoted the railway above Duzdap will be of no value for the solution of the present problem. First period, to Christmas 1918. Railhead Juzzak. 4. During this period the weekly ton mileage which the available transport on the Line of Communication can produce is 78,500. This is the 86,500 as. given in Table XIV, less 2,600 for Political Chagai’s camels and less 5,400 for No. 2 Me chanical Transport Company, as it is doubtful if the Juzzak-Hurmuk Road can be made in the time sufficiently fit for useful work to be got out of heavy lorries. The political Chagai’s camels have had to be used to meet increased demands from the Uhief Engineer, Nushki Extension Railway for camels.77 5. During this period the weekly ton mileage consumption on- account of the recurring items mentioned in paragraph 2 is as follows Item 1 Table VII (A) 12,800 Item 2 (a).. Table VII (B) 15,800 Item 2 (6) Table VII (C) 3,600 Item 3 Table IX 14,200 Item 4 .. 5,000 , Total.. 51,400 Deducting this from the available wtm given in paragraph 4, leaves a weekly ton mileage balance of 21,700 which multiplied by the 6 weeks between now and X’mas gives a, total ton mileage of 162,000 available for lifting non-recurring items. The total ton mileage required for the non-recurring items given in paragraph 2 is as follows :— Item 5(a) .. Table X .. 92,000 Items 5(6) 6(a). 6 (6) and 6 (c) Table XI .. 1;117,550 Total .. 1,270,000 (round No). Deducting the 162,000 ton mileage available till X’mas leaves a total of 1,108,000 ton mileage to be lifted after X’mas. Second 'period, X’mas 1918 to April 1st 1919. Railhead Dnzdap. 6. The available weekly ton mileage during this period works out to 90,400. This is arrived at as follows. From the 86,500 given in Table XIV deduct 2,600 for Political Ghagai’s camels which appears unlikely that the railway will be able to release and add 6,500 for the 3 Ford Van Companies promised in February. The 6,500 arrived at as follows. 3. F. V. Companies at 6,000 each (Table XIII- 18,000. But as they will not arrive till February this means an average wtm throughout the period X’mas to April 1st of 11,000. From this must be deducted 4,500 for their own maintenance, including petrol, not allowed for in Table VIII to avoid complicating that table with broken periods. Balance available average wtm during 2nd period from these F. V. Companies-6,500. 7. During the 2nd period the weekly ton mileage consumption on account of recurring items is as fo.lows.— Item 1 Table VHP (A) 10*520 Item 2(a) .. Table VIII (6) 16,640 Item 2(6) .. Table VIII (r) 1,780 Item 3 Table IX 12,750 Item 4 * 5,000 Total .. .. 4-6,700 This deducted from the 90,400 available wtm given in paragraph 6 leaves a surplus of 43700 wtm which spread over the 14 weeks between X’mas and the beginning of April gives a total ton mileage of 611,800 available to deal with the balance of 1,108,000 (paragraph 5) ton mileage of non-recurring items to be lifted during the 2nd-period. The deficiency of 496,200 ton miles divided by the 14 weeks available to lift it in gives a weeHy ton mileage deficit of 36,000 to be met by transport additional to that now on the Line of Communication and the 3- F. V. Companies promised. 8. I have as. yet no reliable data to go on as to the additional transport that can be procured locally. I have had estimates and promises but being chiefly from Persians require to be treated cautiously. Gene al Malleson has promised-to get me all available Russian fourgonsfrom Transcaspia. I have asked for 500, he has not yet said whether he can get this number but it is doubtful. The Consul- General Meshed can also get Persian fourgons, Persian carts end donkeys. There are additional Meshed camels and Birjandi donkeys to be got. If all promises under these heads mature the situation will be very favourable, but this is not to be I2.jGSBexpected. Assuming that a good proportion of promises given mature, it may he possible to meet the wtm deficiency as follows :—- uim 400 fourgons producing (Table XII) .. .. .. 18,000 400 Persian two horse carts do. .. .. .. 9,000 100 Perian one horse carts do. .. .. .. 1,100 3.000 Meshedi donkeys J do. .. .. .. 3,750 400 Meshedi camels do. .. .. .. 2,000 1.000 Birjandi donkeys do. .. .. .. 2,550 Total 36,400 Additional hired camels from Baluchistan, ete., may be available. It will, x hope, be possible before X’mas to give a definite estimate of to what extent local transport resources 'will suffice tp meet the deficiency named. 9. As a result of my investigations at Meshed, which showed a number of articles procurable there not previously realised it has been possible to reduce the heavy non-recurring item 6 as compared wish my previous preliminary forcecast, articles which are so procurable being brought by back loading and therefore omit ted from Table XI, as they cause no ton mileage expenditure. These calculations deal with upward wtm expenditure and producing power only, but back loading is fully provided for as will be shown from the instructions and diagrams issued and copies of which accompany this note. The matter in which back loading has been allowed for in these calculations is by (a) regarding for the purposes of upward wtm expenditure non producing areas as productive ones owing to supplies being brought down by back loading and thus free of upward WTM expenditure, vide Table VI, and (b) omitting from the calculations for Table XI all articles which can be so brought from fertile areas. The fullest possible use of local pro duce has therefore been allowed for in this forecast. Biroand ; T (Sd.) W. E. R.

H ^ Bated Bir'jand, the 29th January, 1919. {To he substituted for similar instructions hearing date November 5ih 1918, and all copies of the latter destroyed.) General instructions for moving stores up and down the Line of Communi cations. A. Upward movements of stores. 1. The respective functions of the Administrative Commandant (A. C.) the Section Supply Officer (S. 0. S.) and the Section Transport Officer (T. 0. S.) in each section as regards moving stores up the Line of Communications are as follows : • {i) The Transport Officer’s section will intimate to the Administrative Com mandant every Thursday the total carrying power he will have avail able during the forthcoming week for moving stores up the section. {ii) The Administrative Commandant will allot the carrying power so avail able to different purposes in accordance with the instructions contain ed in the subsequent paragraphs and tables. {Hi) The Supply Officer’s section will hand over stores accordingly to the Transport Officer’s section for conveyance up the section, a full detail accompanying each convoy. Where Ordnance and other depots exist, the officer in charge will hand oyer to the Supply Officer’s section in time for conveyance by the convoy to which assigned, stores to the amount of the tonnage allotted by the Administrative Com mandant for such conveyance. 2. In allotting carrying power Administrative Commandants will allot the amounts shown in Table A (stores of primary importance) first, and will then _ allot the surplus to items of secondary importance in accordance with the order of priority given in Table B, the whole of the available stock of any one item being provided with tonnage before any tonnage is allotted to an item lower on the list. If any of the articles shown in Table ' A” are not available at the starting depot {i.e. that at the south end of the section) the amount of the tonnage laid down for such articles will be added to the-surplus-available for articles of secondary importance (Table B). 3. Transport will be allotted by the Assistant Director Supply and Transport to the Transport Officer’s sections so as to ensure that tonnage is always available for the carriage of articles of primary importance (Table A.) plus sufficient to allow of thirty tons per week being always available for Table B. 4. The Deputy Assistant Director of Mechanical Transport, will be regarded as the T. O. S. of the sixth section as regards the mechanical transport running in that section, and in any other section where Mechanical Transport convoys run will nominate a Mechanical Transport Officer to represent him in that capacity. 5. Convoys will be classed as ' connecting convoys ”, “ subsidiary convoys ’’ and (in the 6th Section) “ Mechanical Transport Convoys ”. Connecting convoys will leave the bases of their sections on dates which will be fixed by the Assistant Director, Supply and Transport, so that connecting convoys will leave the base of one section after an interval of one day from the arrival of the connecting convoy from the section next below. Connecting convoy will, as far as possible, be com posed of camels from Government Camel Corps. Troops marching should be despatched by connecting conveys. “ Subsidiary Convoys ” will convey the balance of the weekly tonnage from section to section. They may be composed of either Government, Hired or Maun- dage Transport, and the date of the despatch will be settled by Administrative Com mandants without reference to other sections. The Mechanical Transport convoys in the 6th section will leave each post in each direction three times a week. Preference on Mechanical Transport convoys will be given first to mails, (Table A. item B.J next to Mechanical Transport stores (Table A., item E.) and thirdlyto any articles which are ordered by the Assistant Quartermaster General to be despatched by motor convoy. Officers or troops are not to be despatched by motor convoys without sanction of the Inspector General of Communications. 6. The Supply Depot (and Ordnance and other Depots where they exist) at the base of each section will be regarded, as dumps for stores that are passed on from section to section. Special tables are issued showing the nature of supplies to come to each section weekly from railhead, and the amount, including articles of local produce, that have to be passed, on the aggregate of which articles is shown in Table A., Category A. The tables referred to also show the quantities allowed to each Supply Officers’ section (or head of other service in the section) to meet the needs of his own section. B. Doivnward movement of stores: 7. All transport moving down the line is to be, as far as possible, back-loaded with useful loads to the section next below. The amounts and natures of supplies which are required to be brought by back-loading from the fertile areas in Khorasan, to points on the Line of Communication to the south of that province, are shown in the tables giving the amount of stocks to be maintained at each post, and sources of their supply. Before despatching downward convoys, the T. 0. S,. will ascertain from the Administrative Commandant whether he wishes to despatch any loads other than the supplies named in the tables quoted. F.

Supplies to be laid in Lines of Communication depots for the march up of the additional troops destined for General Beatty’s force. 5. The supplies mentioned in paragraphs 3 and 4 to be all laid in the depots named by the 1st April. 6. The weekly consumption requirements of troops dependent and depot to be provided for in addition to stocking depots as mentioned in paragraph 3, 4 and 5. 7. The quantities of ration supplies needed on the above date have been worked out and are contained in the attached tables :— Table I shows the stocks to be maintained at each depot on the Line of Communication, calculated at five weeks’ normal consumption for troops dependent thereon. This allows of one month’s reserves (vide paragraph 3) being always on hand, the additional week providing for local consumption and being made up again each week on arrival of the weekly amounts due in the depot (Table III). Table II shows the additional amount to be laid in at each depot to provide for the march up the Line of Communication of the extra troops destined for Beatty’s force. Table III shows normal weekly consumption at each depot by troops depen dent thereon. Table IV shows total amount required in each depot between January 1st and April 1st to provide for the needs mentioned in paragraphs 3, 4, 5 and 6. • Table V shows the average weekly amount to be put into each depot to meet the figures named in Table IV, the actual balances in hand on Jan uary 1st being deducted. Table VI shows the weekly tonnage needed up each section of the Line of Communication for ration supplies to meet the requirements of Table „ V allowance being made for packing materials. Table VII shows similarly downward weekly tonnage needed in the case of stores which have to be back, and'not up, loaded. Table VIII shows the amount of transport needed in each section to meet the needs of both ration supplies as in Table VI and VII and for other purposes on each section of the Line of Communication. 8. In the above tables the source of supply has been shown in each case (i.e.) whether Railhead, Sistan, Khorasan or locally at the place where required to be consumed. Table VIII shows the requirements of each section in camels but the trans port need not necessarily be camels but either camels or other parts of transport giving an equivalent approximate w. t. m. / C28GSB /101 IV— contd.

Ordnance. —The office of Deputy Assistant Director of Ordnance Services, Life of Communication, E. P., opened at Birjand on the 14th instant. From 1st January 1919 the following instructions will take effect superseding all previous orders on the subject. ^ Clothing and Ordnance stores will be stocked in Supply Depots Line of Com munication until Ordnance Depots at the same stations are established. The main depots being at Railhead, Hurmuk, Shusp, Birjand, Kaifi, Tnrbab, Meshed and Askabad ; subsidiary depot at Safidawa. The principle is that all provision for the Line of Communication and force at or beyond Meshed is made by this office on the base, from estimates submitted by main depots at stated periods. All questions arising on the subject be referred to Headquarters and not to tae base. Subsidiary depots will demand from their main depots on a rough basis of a 3 months’ supply calculated upon the strength of their ration figures, and the previous 3 months’ issue. All questions arising therefrom to be referred to the main depots concerned. Safidawa will demand from Hurmuk. Main depots will forward the Deputy Assistant Director of Ordnance Stores approximate requirements for 6 months to reach that office 3 months before opera tion, taking into consideration units subsidiary depots and medical establishments, for which they are responsible, as well as any possible foreseen contingency. Special intermediate requirements for stores will be demanded by post; if urgent by telegram. &gt; • Hospital equipment is issued by theJ. 0. D. Stores at stations which do not become issuing depots for clothing and ord nance stores under these instructions, will transfer their stocks as soon as possible to the Ordnance (now temporarily supply) depot upon which dependent, except that Robat, Saindak, Babrahdar and Khunik will continue to clear as previously ordered. All depots will be considered as dumps if necessary for stores in transit. The ordnance depot at railhead will, in addition be responsible for the receipt and handing over for onward transit of stores arriving, advising this office by tffiegrauh of such, sufficiently explicit to be intelligible, stating nature, for which depot, and approximate maundage of each class. For stores in transit one copy of the convoy note to be posted to S.O.S. Hurmuk, and one copy to this office m addi tion to one which accompanies the convoy. The instructions issued to S. 0. S’s. to prepare a copy of the ordnance convoy note for all consignments despatched by them, m force. Despatch of convoys from ordnance depot railhead, and receipt by S. 0. S’s should be notified to this office by wire, In addition, Ordnance officer railhead should hold a margin of principal stores to meet possible unforeseen needs of Life of Communication using his discretion as to what they comprise. Camel gear and panni-grass, chut, etc., should always be available. Main and subsidiary depots will keep accounts on L A. F’s 1041 and 1040 ; these should be closed to the 15th and last day of month inclusive, and ror warned together with all supporting vouchers to the Deputy Assistant Director ot C r d n ance Store for checking prior to being passed to the Accounts and Audn Officer , no o117 . returns are required unless called for. Bi-monthly balance telegrams, may be dis continued. Ibis office should be advised by wire of any exceptional run on a particular stock or any unforeseen emergency. Units will indent upon the ordnance depot upon which dependent (for the present the supply depot) those at Railhead, Khwash, Ladis, Robat, Kacha, and Saindak on railhead ; Sistan, Dehani Baghi and Babarahdar on Hnrmuk, Khunik on Safidawa, Rui Khaf on Kain and so on. Officer Commanding units when indenting will do so in duplicate on A. F. Gh- 994 deleting the certificate not applicable, and in all cases inserting thereon the strength of the unit under their command, differentiating between B. T., I. T. and followers. Demands for first issues must state the authority under which made, if none exists, it must be obtained from Headquarters Line of Communication prior to indenting, emergencies excepted, when covering authority must be applied for and passed to issuing officer. The responsibility for irregular issues rests entirely with the issuing officer who must be prepared to satisfactorily explain his action. Units are clothed and equipped to an authorised scale and only such articles as therein specified can be issued or replaced, exceptions to be made the subject of application to Headquarters for authority. Salvage .—Every attention should be given to this important service. Large economies can be effected by a systematic salving in units of all unser viceable ordnance stores. Equipment, and clothing, and wherever possible, an equivalent number of articles to those drawn as replacement, should be returned. Until separate ordnance depots exist, unserviceable articles can be handed over to the S. 0. S’s ready packed for transit with list of contents, and name of unit inside. These will be back-loaded to Ordnance Officer, Railhead, as opportu nities arise, that officer will dispose-of such stores on nominal vouchers to C. 0. 0. Quetta. Ordnance Officer, Juzzak, will wire this office on 1st of each month the previous month’s total maundage of salvage received. Copy of Routine Order No. 31, dated the 15'h January 1919, by Brigadier-General W. E. R. Dickson, C.I.E., I.G.C., East Persia. 3i. Ordnance. —Reference instructions in Routine Order No. 125 of 1918. All units are considered as equipped according to their Mobilization Tables and scales of clothing laid down in I. A. 0. No. 1-S., Special, dated the 5th February 1918. As a consequence any demand for (a) first issues must be explained in a covering memo., clearly stating the authority under which demanded and why the unit is not in possession of its proper clothing and equipment, or {b) to replace' others lost through the exigencies of the campaign. Qn a Line of Communication losses which can be fairly charged to the State as “ through the exigencies of the campaign ” are extremely rare ; and should be made the subject of careful enquiry and representation to Line of Communication Headquarters for approval, such approval to be attached to Army Form (1-994 when demanding replacements. All other losses being a charge to the person or persons responsible, failing which they become charged again,st the unit for which Officers Commanding become liable (5) to replace others rendered unserviceable through the Exigencies of the campaign an equivalent number of articles to those drawn under^ this head ing must be returned to the Ordnance department. Issuing officers will be called upon to produce a number of unserviceable articles corresponding in detail to their monthly issues.
