He expresses his fear that if active and warlike operations were necessary, this state of inefficiency would result in failure. Pepper states that the only vessel of war capable of being pronounced efficient in physical strength is the
                           Coote. He then goes on to give details of the crews on three further vessels: the
                           Amherst, the
                           Tigrisand the
                           Ternate; he states that the crew numbers are sufficient, but declares that the native crews are of an inferior class and of little use as seamen. Pepper suggests that in case of emergency, a certain number of Europeans be detained and made available to the public service as drafts from the vessels of war proceeding to the Presidency.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023673727.0x000003#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
