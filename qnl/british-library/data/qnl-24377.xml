Political Agency, Bahrain Dated the December 1925 To The Secretary to Hon^le the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Memorandum . Can you please inform me as to the scale of fees which should be charged in suite filed for execution of decrees. The Court Fees Act does not seen explicit on the subject. During my absence Captain kalian has been admitting such cases free and as a result I find that decree holders make little effort to recover the amount decreed but at once have recourse to the Court, there being no further fee to pay. The result is a great increase in petty court work, which is already too heavy. If fees are charged the decree holder at least tries to get his money and only cones to Court as a last resort.

Regarding’ Court Fees about which you ordered an office-note to be put up, I submit that the following fees which are legi timately chargeable according to Kings Regulation No. 2 of 27 are not being recovered. 1. Cost of every summon issued by the Court which depends on the value of the suit. In this I may mention that along with the C*F« taken in advance only the cost of the first two summons are recovered. In majority of the cases any number of summons are issued. 2. For every (i) warrant of arrest (ii) attachment and (iii) sale as also (iv) every proclamation of the Court are expected to be levied a fee according to the value of the claim. 'Schedule showing the amount of fees in these cases is submitted. In judicial relief cases and also diving claims invariably M/8/- is charged. The proper fee in relief cases is according to the amount at which the relief sought is valued in the plaint (Sec.7(iv) C.F.Act). In the claims for maintenance also M/8/- is at present charged whereas according to Sec.7(ii) C.F.Act it should be charged on ten times the annual amount claimed. In maintenance cases it will be hard to levy a high fee, because majority of the applicants are generally too poor to pay. When M/3/- was fixed in such cases another reason that weighed with the Court was that Ihese cases are settled by the Shara. In case the above rules are going to be adhered to strictly I submit that it would be advisable if the Bahrain Court also ' / accepted these, otherwise the impression outside will be that the Agency in their own ca$es is trying to squeeze out more money.
