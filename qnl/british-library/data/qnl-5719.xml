Correspondence relating to the Italian Occupation of Assab Bay. Assab Bay is on the African coast of the Bet Sea, inside the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, north west of the island of Perim, and nearly opposit* to Mokha on the coast of Arabia. The people of the surrounding country belong to the Danaki! tribe of Somalis. to The Italian interest in the place dates from tin [ year 1870. On the 2nd March in that year, Sir A. Paget, Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Plorence, addressed the following Despatch (No. 50) to the Earl of Clarendon :—* “ It was reported not long ago in the newspapers that the Italian Government had the intention of establishing a penal settlement on the coast of Abyssinia, and that a frigate of the Italian navy was fitting out for this expedition. “ An intention of this kind did at one time exist during the administration of Count Menabrea, and, Her Majesty’s forces being then engaged in that country, communications upon the subject took place between the British and Italian Governments, the result of which was that the project was abandoned. “ I now learn from M. Visconti \ enosta that there is no foundation for the report to which I have alluded above. The Italian Government has no intention of creating a penal colony in Abyssinia, but there is a Company either formed or in course of formation in Italy which will run a line of steamers from Genoa through the Suez Canal to India, China, &amp;c., and this Company is desirous of esta blishing a coal depdt somewhere on the western shore of the Bed Sea. His Excellency spoke of an Italian frigate being now at Alexandria, and of the possibility of its lending assistance to the Company in the object they have in view. “ To these circumstances M. Visconti Venosta attributed the circulation of the report to which I bad called his attention.” On the 10th July following, a telegram from Cairo was published in the Elorence newspaper “ Italie,” stating! that a corps of Egyptian troops had disembarked at Assab Bay, Italian property in the Bed Sea, that, after a conflict, the Italian flag bad been struck down, and the place occupied by the troops, and that the Egyptian steamer “ Kar- toum” had gone from Suez to Massowah on a secret mission. AVith reference to this telegram the “ Opinione ” of the 11th July gave the following explanation.* Despatch, No. 7, dated 11th July 1870. UK 2 •which was considered by Sir A. Paget 51 to have an official character :— “ It is known that the Company of Rubattino, some weeks ago, acquired some property at Assab, a place on the African coast of the Red Sea, from the natives to whom it belonged, and here founded a depot for the purpose of facilitating Italian com merce between Europe and the extreme East. Whether Assab belongs to the Ottoman dominions, or '''Ts comprehended in the Kaimakamate of Massowa, the administration of which was ceded by a firman in 1866 by the Porte to the present Khedive for life, is a question which does not appear to have yet been clearly made out, and which in any case could have no bearing upon the validity of the purchase of the ground, which was a private affair of the Rubattino Company. This is the point which is at present debated at Elorence, Constantinople, and Cairo, with those forms of reciprocal courtesy which are usual between friendly Governments. “ The * Kartoum,’ the Egyptian ship to which the telegram attributes a secret mission, arrived within the last few days at Suez, and did not, as the telegram stated, leave that port. “ It had returned from Assab, whither it appears to have been sent to obtain exact information as to the nature of the Italian establishment there. That such was the only object of the * Kartoum,’ appears from the positive assurances which are said to have been given to the King’s Agent and Consul General in Egypt. “ It appears that, on disembarking at Assab, where they found the Rubattino establishment quite deserted, the crew of the Egyptian vessel thought they might illtreat the natives of the coast, and entered the uninhabited hut, which is at present the only indication of the Rubattino es tablishment.” The Khedive was, at the time, at Constantinople, where the report was reproduced. Sir H. Elliotf accordingly asked His Highness if he had received any intelligence of the occurrence, but was assured that he was quite satisfied of its inaccuracy. About two months ago persons representing an Italian Company had paid money to an individual who had no title to it, nor the right of selling it, and they were informed by the Egyptian Government that they would not be allowed to take possession of it. His Highness said he had heard nothing more of the matter, but the asserted collision could not have taken place, as there was no Egyptian vessel at or near the place where it is stated to have occurred. Simultaneously, Colonel Stanton, Her Majesty’s Agent and Consul General in Egypt, reported as follows:—J “ Having noticed in a Constantinople journal a telegram purporting to come from Egypt, and dated Cairo, the 9th of July, stating that Egyptian troops had disembarked in the Bay of Assab (in the Red Sea), belonging to Italy by right of purchase, and ' v f Despatch, No. 105, dated 12th July 1870.

In April 1879, the Resident at Aden, acting apparently under general instructions from the Government of India, to keep a vigilant look out in regard to proceedings of foreign powers on the African coast, took advantage of a cruise of H.M.S. ‘‘Lynx” in the vicinity of Assab Bay to make inquiries concerning the movements of the Italians and French in those parts. The following report, with a letter from the Sultan of Raheita in the same sense, was brought back by the Native agent employed by General Loch, a certain Abdee Samunter :—f “ I saw the Sultan of Raheta at Tajourrah, and in quired if any one had purchased Assab. He said that an Italian who had come there nine years a^o and purchased Assab, without his previous knowledge, from the Chief under him named Abdulla, of the Aukala tribe, who was the Aukal of the place, for 8,200 dollars. The Sultan said that his own chil dren also took about 3,000 dollars out of the above sum from the said Abdulla, and that he expelled the latter for his having sold the place to the Italians. Yusuf, the Italian, so says the Sultan, came there and built a wooden house and hoisted a flag. He had to leave Assab after six months, asthe Sultan refused to supply him with sweet water. The Italian did not return since then, and the house has been destroyed, and the flagstaff is still seen on the hill. The Sultan further said that, about six years a^o, a Frenchman demanded from him an island in the vicinity of Assab on hire for two years, at the yearly rent of 160 dollars, and that he Granted this. The Frenchman stowed there coals, and stayed there two years, and, on the penod ending, removed the coals and left the island. 1 he Sultan of Raheta expressed his readiness and plea sure to furnish the British Government with all the information desired, and to sell Assab to tlic British Government, if required, stating that lie will, in that case, return the Italians their money, 8,200 dollars.” These papers were communicated to the Foreign Office, and bv that Office to Her Majesty s Agent and Consul General in Egypt, who, having mentioned the subject to his Italian colleague, Mons. de Martino, was informed by him,* that, some seven or eio'ht years ago, soon after the French had bought Obok, the Rubattino Company pur chased Assab Bay from the local Sheikh, probably with the knowledge of the Italian Government, who sent out a general officer to inspect the place, but that the result of his inspection was so unfavourable that the project of occupying it had, he believed, been altogether abandoned. During the early summer of 1879, there waas a considerable movement of Italian ships of war up and down the coast as far as Guardafui. On the 13th April the corvette “ Rapido,” commanded by Count Amezaga, arrived at Aden, having on board an African exploration party, sent out by the Italian Geographical Society, and headed by Captain Martini, which subsequently went on to Zevla. On the 8th May, the frigate “ Victor Fisani,” on its way to China and Japan, with His Royal Highness the Duke of Genoa on board, arrived,' and afterwards visited Berbera and other points on the Somali coast.f The “Rapido” was backwards and forwards between Aden and Zeila. On the 13th June the Resident reported X “ In the beginning of this month the ‘ Rapido a^ain left this for the nominal purpose of visiting Zeyla, and of rendering such assistance as they could to Captain Martini and his party, who are still there, and on the 7th instant she returned to Aden, when her commander, Captain Amezaga, visited me, and in the course of conversation said that he had not only been at Zeila, but that he had visited the ports of Tajurra and Assab Bay, and from what I learnt from him during the course of con versation, he had made himself acquainted with everything connected with these two ports, the water supply of each, as well as the roads leading to the interior from the coast. Captain Amezaga informed me that he was obliged to visit these ports to procure leather ropes for Captain Martini’s * From Mr. Vivian, No. 24, dated June 1879.

On the 18th November (Despatch No. 439) Sir A. Paget sent home the following summary of a letter to the “ Corriere Mercantile ” from Signor Rubattino, denying certain reports which had been current in the Italian press :—* “ The ‘ Corriere Mercantile ’ publishes an ex planatory letter from Commander Rubattino on the subject of the Bay of Assab. It corrects the mis statements made by some papers respecting the nature and the property of that bay, wliich he states belongs to the Society; he says that the Government never had an idea of obtaining the cession of it, that his Company bought the bay on account of their steam-boat service and the in creased number of voyages to India, and for the coasting trade they established on the Red Sea more than a year ago; and he concludes by expressing the hope that the Italian Government will grant them that protection which all Italians owning property and engaged in commerce abroad have the right to expect.” On the same subject, Sir A. Paget, on the 20th November (Despatch, No. 443) wrote to Lord Salis bury :— “ Owing to the absence of Count Maffei for a few days from Rome, and to other circumstances, I had not, as was my wish, an opportunity of seeing him until this morning for the purpose of making some inquiries respecting the reported intention of the Italian Government to acquire a possession in the Bay of Assab, on the coast of the Red Sea. “ Count Maffei’s account of the transaction is as follows:— “ Some ten or eleven years ago, Captain Amezaga, of the Italian Navy, had been employed by the Italian Marine Department upon a hydrographical exploration, in which two ships were engaged, of a part of the coast of the Red Sea. In order to prevent any misunderstanding, he. Count Maffei, who was then Charge d’Affaires in London, had been directed by General Menabrea, then President of the Council and Minister for Foreign Affairs, to communicate on the subject with Her Majesty’s Government, and the reply he received was that Her Majesty’s Government had no objection to the proposed expedition. General Menabrea, Count Maffei said, had at one time the idea of establishing a penal colony on the shores of the Red Sea, but this idea had been entirely given up (if I am not mistaken, owing to the objections of Her Majesty’s Government), and had never been revived. “ Upon the report, however, of Captain Amezaga, Signor Rubattino, who then had in view the creation of a line of packets with India, bought from the 4076. B 7&gt;Chiefs or rulers of the district a small extent of territory in Assab Bay. The purchase, according to Count Maffei, was made by Signor Bubattino with his own money and in his own name, though with the consent of the Italian Government. A portion of the purchase money was paid at the time, and the remainder is now due; but up to the present time no use has been made of the property acquired. “ Signor Bubattino, however, has since estab lished, not only a line of packets with India, but others which perform a coasting trade along the Bed Sea, and it would seem, from what Count Maffei states, that, owing to the representations of Captain Amezaga, who commanded the ships in which the members of the Italian Geographical Exploration Society were conveyed to Zeila, and who returned to Italy some months ago, Signor Bubattino determined on erecting proper buildings on his property, for the purpose of making it, as originally intended, a station for coaling, &amp;c., for his ships, if he could obtain protection for the estab lishment from the Italian Government. “ An application was, therefore, addressed to the Ministry by Signor Bubattino on this subject; it was favourably responded to, and two ships, the * Varnese ’ and ‘ Ischia,’ under the command of Captain Amezaga, are to proceed to Assab Bay, to afford the required countenance and protection. The Italian Government, Count Maffei said, con sidered themselves bound to afford this encourage ment and support to Signor Bubattino in a district where there was no sort of protection for life and property. It vvould also, it was hoped, be the means of opening up an easier and safer means of communication with Shoa than Zeila, where the members of the Geographical Society had been sub jected to many vexations and exactions. “ Count Maffei, in deploring the importance which had been attributed to this affair in the Oppo sition Italian press, expressed his anxious desire that the circumstances, as he had related them, should be correctly reported to Her Majesty’s Government, and he accompanied the expression of this wish by the most positive declaration, several times ^ repeated, that Signor Bubattino’s intended establishment in Assab Bay was not a Government enterpiise, that the Government had no connection with it further than what he had stated, and that they had no idea of raising a question as to the sovereignty of the district in question, which, thev presumed, belonged in fact to the Porte or the Khedive, and that they had no political objects in view. P.S. I should add that the ‘ Varnese ’ is an ironclad, and it is presumable that Count Maffei felt the force of observations which have been made as to the selection of such a ship for the service in question, for he spontaneously explained that she was a very old ship, and had been specially chosen by Captain Amezaga as being roomy and otherwise* Home Corr., No. 908 of 1879. f From Foreign Office, 18th December 1879, No. 975. well adapted for the comfort of the officers and crew in those hot regions.” On the 27th November, the Resident at Aden telegrajffied* that rumours were current there that the Italian Government had despatched an ironclad and two frigates under command of Count Amezaga, with the intention of annexing a part of the African littoral, and that Berbera was hinted at. This telegram was communicated to Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Rome, who reported his proceedings thereon in the following terms (Despatch, No. 460, dated 6th December 1879) :—f “ I thought it my duty to lose no time in commu nicating with the President of the Council, Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon this subject, and I therefore called on His Excellency yesterday evening. “ Upon my relating to Signor Cairoli the informa tion which had been received by your Excellency, His Excellency stated that it was pure exaggeration from beginning to end. The Italian Government had no intention, he said, of sending either an ironclad or a frigate to the coast of Africa as stated, nor had they the remotest project of taking posses sion of any port in those regions. They had, he said, as I was aware, originally contemplated sending two ships, the ‘Varese’ and ‘Ischia,’ to afford protection to Signor Rubattino in establishing his depot in Assab Bay. One of these ships, the ‘ Varese,’ was certainly an ironclad, but was so old that she was hardly worthy of the name (‘ una ‘ corazzata per ridere’), but in order to put an end to all misconception, it had now been decided not to send this ironclad, but only a vessel belonging to the Royal Navy, which could not be called a ship of war, with the double object of giving moral sup port to Signor Rubattino and of aiding the members of the Geographical Society. “ M. Cairoli repeated to me the same assurances as I had already received from Count Maffei as reported in my Despatch, No. 443, of 20th ult., as to the Italian Government having nothing what ever to do with Signor Rubattino’s purchase or his expedition further than affording to him, in com pliance with the request which he had addressed to them, the protection of the flag. “ I told His Excellency that I was glad to receive these explicit statements from him, that the Red Sea being the direct line of communication with India, Her Majesty’s Government were naturally attentive to tbe proceedings of foreign powers on its coasts. “ M. Cairoli replied that he perfectly understood this, and so anxious was he for the best under standing with England, that, for this reason only, he should be careful to avoid doing anything in those regions the appearances even of which might arouse the susceptibililics of Her Majesty’s Go vernment ; but in aiding the Geographical Society in their explorations in Central Africa, the Italian Government believed they were furthering an object■ ■ /Pi 8 of common interest to all nations, and especially to England. His Excellency again declared that th e ~ Italian Government had no political objects in view, nor any ideas of conquest on the coasts of the “ I have since ascertained from M. Malvano, the Director of the Political Department of the Foreign Office, that the vessel being sent to the Red Sea under command of Captain Amezaga is the Aviso « Esploratore,” which went about a week or 10 days ao-o to Zante to embark Captain Amezaga, who was there, onboard the “ Varese,” and then proceeded to her destination. Signor Rubattino’s expedition, M. Malvano thought, must by this time almost have arrived in Assab Bay. “ M. Malvano spoke to me of the serious annoy ances and vexations which the members of the Geographical Society had invariably experienced, at the hands of the ruler at Zeila, ‘ Abou Bekir, who, amongst other things, had extorted customs duties he was in no way entitled to levy, and who, while profuse in his offers of assistance, always brought to grief the various expeditions he had undertaken to befriend. As a consequence, ^ M. Malvano believed that the Geographical Society would for the future adopt Signor Rubattino’s esta blishment in Assab Bay as the head quarters of their expeditions which would render them entirely independent of the ruler at Zeila, and be in evtiy respect more convenient for keeping up their com munications with Shoa. Sir A. Paget was instructed (Despatch No. 572, dated 10th December 1879,) to express to the Italian Government the satisfaction with which Her Majesty’s Government had received these as surances. The subject at the same time came under dis cussion at Cairo, consequent on a telegram from Gordon Pasha reporting that the Italians were establishing themselves at Assab, and recommend ing that they should be required to move to Zulla, in Annesley Bay, the cession of which place to Italy he had already urged upon the Khedive, the avowed object being to embroil Italy with Abyssinia.* Moustapha Fehmy Pasha, the Egyptian Foreign Minister, in conversation with Mr. Malet said that the Government was resolved not to give the Italians foothold on any part of the coast, and that the Council, on being made aware of Gordon Pashas communications, had decided that explanations should be asked of the Italian Consul General, M. de Martino, as to what had taken place at Assab. The Minister remarked that no communication had been made to the Egyptian Government by the Italian Government with regard to Assab, and that no bond fide sale of land at that place could ever have been made to Signor Rubattino, as the local Chiefs were not proprietors of the land, and th e - sal * Mr. Malet, No. 682, dated 19th Decem ber 1879.

From Foreign Office, 8th January 1880, No. 21. f Home Corr., No. 5 of 1880. Mr. Malet made His Excellency acquainted with the substance of the conversation which had passed between Sir Augustus Paget and Count Maffei on the subject of Assab, as related in his Despatch, No. 443, of the 20th November, and with i egard to Zulla, observed that the Khedive had no power, whether he wished it or not, to cede any part of the coast to any foreign Power. In this remark Moustapha Pasha entirely concurred, and complained with considerable warmth of the action of the Italian Government in sending two ships of war to the coast to protect Signor Pubattino’s sup posed rights without giving any information on the subject to the Egyptian Government; and he added that, in addition to the representations which he was to make to the Italian Agent and Consul General, the Government had decided to send an officer at once to Assab to report what the Italians were really doing there. The Italian Consul General, when questioned, merely replied* that the sale of land at Assab had formed the subject of communications between the Italian and Egyptian Governments in 1870, that at that date Great Britain only recognized the authority of the Khedive as far as Zeila (sic, but ? Zulla), and that consequently the title of the Chiefs to sell land there could not be disputed. On the 2nd January lastf the Resident at Aden telegraphed to the Secretary of State as follows :— “ Italian man-of-war 4 Esploratore,’ Captain Amezaga commanding, arrived from Massowah and Assab Bay. Two troop ships expected in three or four days. Amezaga then returns with them to Assab Bay to hoist Italian flag there. Should I protest on behalf of Her Majesty’s Government ? Instructions requested.” t Home Corr., No. 7 of 1880. r § Telegram Irom Resident, 6th January, No. 7 of 1880. || Telegram, from Resident, 8th January, No. 15 of 1880. On the 4th January General Eoch telegraphed further} that the Italians were inviting Aden traders to settle at Assab, giving certificates, and arranging for artificers and materials to be imme diately despatched for the formation of the settle ment ; that he had desired Captain Amezaga to refrain from these proceedings, which were detri mental to Egypt, a State in friendly alliance with the British Government. Captain Amezaga protested against the impedi ments thrown in his way,§ but General Loch, pending instructions, adhered to his objections, until he received formal assurances|| that no terri tory was to be taken possession of by Italy, and that no political sense attached to the proceedings at Assab which, as it appeared, were being con ducted by Signor Sapeto, an agent of Signor Rubattino. The course of these transactions was reported in detail by General Loch in his letter, No. 1, dated the 9th January 1880, in which he enclosed the text of the assurances above referred to, which had been given to him by the Italian Consul at Aden and by Captain Amezaga. 4076. CGeneral Loch was justified in refusing to afford to Signor Sapeto the facilities which he desired, and in interposing obstacles to the use of the port of Aden as a basis for a foreign settlement in Egyptian territory. ^ Before noticing the diplomatic action of the Foreign Office in the matter, it will be convenient to narrate what has since transpired in respect to the actual proceedings of the Italians at Assab. ♦Letter from Aden, No. 2, dated 2Jst On the 20th January,* H.M.S. “Seagull” January 1880. visited the place, and found there the Italian°men- of-war ‘ c Esploratore ” and “ Ischia,” and a steamer belonging to the Bubattino Company. There was no sign of military occupation, and only the Italian merchant ensign was flying on shore. In the early part of the month an Egyptian man-of-war had visited the bay, and her captain had raised no objec tion to the proceedings of the Italians. A pier was being run out, and a condenser had been landed capable of working two tons a day. A bakery had also been put up. In Commander Heron’s opinion, it was possible that the Italians might eventually make a good trading place of Assab, but with much time and trouble, and an enormous expenditure of money. The Dankali tribe, who were concerned, are considered by the Somalis to be the worst trading tribe along the coast. Captain Amezaga offered Commander Heron every assistance, and most positively assured him “ that there never was any “ intention of occupying the place in a military “ point of view,” he being there solely with the object of opening up trade with Abyssinia. On the 28th January, the officer commanding at t Letter from Aden, No. 7, dnted 19th Perimf reported, on the authority of a native, that February 1880. the people on the coast were ready to attack the Italians, and that it was rumoured that Mahomed Hamfali, “ the chief of that part of the country ” intended to attack them himself. f Letter as above. About the same time, | information was received from an old Dankali Shaikh, who arrived at Aden, that the Italians had purchased from Sultan Durban of Baheita, for 7,000 dollars, a large island opposite Assab, named Durmaba, which had a good harbour ; that some of the Sultan’s relations objected to the sale; and that Sultan Mahomed Hamfali was very angry with the Italians for having settled on his coast, but was afraid to do anything in the matter. The report as to the purchase of the island was confirmatory of news in the same sense which had been sent (8th January) to the Egyptian Govern- § Enclosure in Despatch from Mr. Mulct, ment by the Governor of Massowah,§ on the autho- No. 30, dated 14th January 1880. r jty of an officer who had been deputed to Assab to find out what was going on. On the 19th February the “ Ischia ” arrived at Aden. Her Commander, Lieutenant Volpe, called || Letter from Aden, No. 9, dated 24th on the Besident,|| and talked without reserve except February 1880. as £ 0 ^j ie purchase of the island, in regard to which he was silent. He reported the natives as quiet and friendly at present, but savage and barbarous, and not to be depended on. He doubted the com mercial capabilities of the place, or whether it/T^ 12 would ever flourish and he a profitable acquisition to the Rubattino Company. Prom various signs he considered that the trade was at present insig nificant. Want of water was, and would continue, -an obstacle. Captain Amezaga and Signor Sapeto, however, were of opinion, that if they could only induce three or four caravans to visit Assab, much of the export which at present finds its way to other parts would he diverted there. About the same time,* a man described as “ agent of Sultan Mahomed Hamfali ” reported that the Italians were building two forts on the shore at Assab, of which one was completed; that the island called “ Jazirat-al-Babar ” had been bought by them ; that the officer there had bought up every sort of merchandise from the Dankalis, telling them not to proceed to Aden, hut to buy from him whatever they wanted, and sell to him what they had; and that an Egyptian steamer which came from Massowah and asked the Italians by whose order they occupied the place received for answer, that they had done so by consent and permission from Cairo and Constantinople. Meanwhile, a report had appeared in the Italian press that the Italian Consul at Aden had published a circular inviting merchants to establish houses of commerce and agents at Assab. This report was declared in “ II Diritto ” of the 23rd February to he “ devoid of all foundation.’'-)* On the 7th March, Her Majesty’s ship “ Philo mel ” returned to Aden from a cruise to Assab. Her commander, Captain Berners, reported that the Italians were in treaty with Sultan Burhan of Baheita for the purchase of five or six of the largest islands in the Bay; that the Sultan fully intended to sell them unless within a month the English bought them, which he would prefer ; that no forts ivere built or building on the mainland; and that there were no troops, but a small armed guard of sailors. In Captain Berners’ opinion, “ the posses- “ sion of these islands by a foreign power would “ be most disadvantageous to Great Britain in time “ of war, as affording a coaling station within 50 “ miles of Perim, and an anchorage for the largest “ vessels, which might easily be defended.”J Simultaneously, the Resident was informed by Mr. Rolph, the Italian Consul at Aden, who had lately returned from Egypt, that he had had fre quent interviews with the Egyptian Minister of War, who in no way objected to the Italians having a footing at Assah, and in fact did not seem to care much who possessed that portion of the African coast. Mr. Rolph also professed to have been shown by the Italian Consul General in Egypt all the correspondence between the British and Italian Governments on the subject, including a paper in which “ Lord Beaconsfield expressed it as his “ opinion, that so long as Assab Bay was only used 4( by the Rubattino Company for trading purposes, &lt;c and for opening up a road for commerce between * Letter from Aden, No. February 1880. 10, dated 26th | From Foreign Office, 13 th March 1880, No. 196. t Letter from Aden, No. March 1880. 10, dated 10th* Home Corr., No. 186. f To Foreign Office, 11th March 1880, No. 186. + See post, page 28. § From Foreign Office, 15th March 1880, No. 195. |j See Memorandum on “ Somali Coast,” 11th October 1879, Appendix B. &lt;£ the centre of Abyssinia and the coast, he could see no harm in an Italian mercantile Company “ possessing it.” On the 10th March,* the Resident telegraphed to the Secretary of State the substance of Captain Berner’s report, adding that, in that officer’s opinion, the islands in question could not be used for commercial purposes, and asking whether he should take steps to purchase them for Great Britain, or conclude with the Sultan of Raheita an agreement similar to that concluded in 1876 with the Sultan of Socotra, under which the Chief, in consideration of an annual subsidy, would bind himself not to sell to any Power but England. This telegram was referred to the Foreign Office for Lord Salisbury’s views, with the following remarks:—f' It appears to Lord Cranbrook that t( an absolute purchase of the islands would not, “ under any circumstances, be expedient, and that, “ unless some distinction can be drawn between the “ African mainland in this part of the Red Sea “ and the islands adjacent to it, even an agreement “ of the nature suggested might be thought incon- “ sistent with the arguments used in Lord Salis- “ bury’s Despatch to Sir A. Paget, No. 51, of the “ 7th February last,J upholding the sovereignty of “ Egypt over Assab Bay. On the other hand, “ it is improbable that the Khedive’s rights of “ sovereignty, which do not seem to have been “ asserted in any practical way, will be respected “ either by the Sheikh of Raheita or the Italians “ on the spot; and there is therefore considerable “ risk lest, if the Sheikh’s overtures to General “ Loch be wholly rejected, the sale of the islands “ to the Italians should become an accomplished “ fact.” The Foreign Office replied, § expressing concur rence in Lord Cranbrook’s view that purchase of the islands was not expedient. The letter con tinued:—“Lord Salisbury, however, is of opinion “ that the alternative course suggested by General “ Loch would be very desirable, namely, that an “ agreement should be concluded at once with the “ Sheikh of Raheita similar in its character to that “ which was made with the Sultan of Socotra in “ January 1876, || as the establishment by the Italians “ of a large depot for naval purposes in the Red Sea “ would be a source of serious embarrassment to “ this country. Upon learning from Lord Cran- “ brook that General Loch has been authorized to “ negotiate such an agreement with the Sheikh of “ Raheita, Lord Salisbury would be prepared to “ instruct Her Majesty’s Agent and Consul General “ in Egypt to address a note to the Government “ of the Khedive stating that, in taking this pre- 44 cautionary step, Her Majesty’s Government have 44 no intention of disputing hereafter any title which “ Egypt might be found to have to the possession 44 of the islands in question.” Upon receipt of this letter, the Resident, from whom it had meanwhile been ascertained that the 4076. Dnegotiations on the part of the Italians were being conducted by Seignor Sapeto,* was asked by tele- graphf whether Durmaba was one of the five islands now in question, or whether, as previous reports indicated, it had been sold separately; also what terms the Raheita Sultan would require for an agreement like that relating to Socotra, appli cable to all islands subject to his authority. General Loch was at the same time desired to communicate on the subject with the Viceroy of India, whose views were also asked for.J The Resident replied, on the 18th March, § that it could not be positively ascertained whether or not Durmaba was one of the five islands ; that the terms expected by the Sultan of Raheita would depend upon the offer made by the Italians; and that his Assistant was proceeding to Assab to make inquiries. He was informed on the following day|| that positive information in regard to Durmaba was necessary, as the value of an agreement with Raheita, if not including that island and all others under the Sheikh’s authority, seemed doubtful. On the 20th March^f Sir R. Temple, who called at Aden on his way from Bombay to England, ad dressed the following telegram to the Secretary of State:— * Telegram from Resident, 13th March 1880, No. 194. f Telegram to Resident, 16th March 1880, Jso. 195. | Telegram to Viceroy, 16th March 1880, No. 195. § Home Corr., No. 205. || Telegram to Resident, 19th March 1880, IT Home Corr., No. 219. “ British interests near Aden and entrance of Red Sea much affected by Assab Bay. “ I venture to suggest that Egypt be asked to prevent sale of the several islands to Italy. If Egypt refuses, then let Resident arrange with Sultan Raheita to give British Government option of purchase. Resident says he could easily settle this if he got early orders. “ Time presses, lest Sultan should close with Italians, who are on the spot.” On the 21st March, the Viceroy of India ex pressed his views, as follows: —** *• Telegram from Viceroy, 21st March “ Purchase by Italy of islands at Assab Bay No ‘ 220, should certainly be prevented, but I think it would be best to support the Egyptian claim to Somali coast, and object to Italian purchase on ground that Raheita cannot sell Egyptian territory. Arrange with Egypt, that she is not to sanction any such transfer. “ Italian Government could not consider this action more unfriendly than if we step in at last moment and purchase islands over their heads; moreover, such purchase would defeat our conten tion that Egypt has sovereign rights, and would lead to additional responsibilities, which the course I propose would avoid.” In communicating to the Eoreign Officef 'j' these tt To Foreign Office, 24th March 1880, telegrams, which in effect suggested that the sale No ' 219 - ol the islands should be prevented by the inter vention of the Egyptian Government rather than by direct agreement between the British Govern ment and the Sheikh of Raheita, it was observed :— “ ^ ie objections to such an agreement were ad- verted to in Mr. Stanhope’s letter of the 11thTUB.IIIim'MIlBIlIJMH 15 March, and, as appears from Sir J. Pauncefote’s a rfiti ’ ^ ave no ^ ^ een overlooked at the Poreiom “ Office. Lord Cranbrook agrees with the Viceroy “ ^ preferring that the proceedings of the Italians ;; should, if possible, he checked by action on the “part of the Egyptian Government, whose terri- “ f° r ^ a ? rl ghts are being infringed; but the final (( decision as to the course to be pursued by Her “ Majesty’s Government in the matter must, His Lordship feels, be left to the Secretary of State “ for Eoreign Affairs.” . Meanwhile Captain Hunter, the Resident’s As sistant, had visited Assab on board Her Majesty’s ship “ Philomel,” Commander Berners. His re- port,* dated the 24th March, explains the general situation so clearly, and gives so good an account of the locality, that it is desirable to quote it nearly in e.vtenso, as follows :— “ In accordance with instructions, I left Aden on the 20th March 1880 at 7 p.m. in H.M.S. 4 Philomel,’ Commander Berners. We reached Raheita next morning about 10, where we stopped and landed Abdi Samuntur and another Somali, with instructions to proceed across country to Marghiblah, where Sultan Burhan was reported to be residing. 44 They were also to gather, from various sources, information regarding the authority of the Sultan in the matter of disposing of the islands in Assab Bay, and the truth as to the transactions reported to have already taken place between the Italians and the Danakil. 44 Raheita is not marked in the chart; it is situated in a sheltered bight, just north of Ras Dameirah. 44 We left Raheita about 11, and arrived off Assab at 5 p.m. 44 The 4 Philomel ’ steamed up the bay between the islands until opposite Marghiblah, where she anchored about a mile from the shore. 44 An interpreter was despatched on shore to arrange an interview between myself and Sultan Burhan for the next morning. 44 This was happily satisfactorily accomplished. 44 The following day, 22nd March, at my request, Captain Berners despatched his Navigating Lieu tenant in the steam cutter, accompanied by a native of the place, to fix the position and identify the larger islands. 44 About 9 o’clock Captain Berners and I landed on the beach; we walked for upwards of three quarters of an hour over heavy sand, here and there slippery from the salty ooze, until we reached the bed of a mountain torrent which runs into the sea a few miles to the east of Marghiblah. 44 Here fresh water is found, of excellent qualitv, at the depth of six feet. 44 The breadth of this watercourse was here about 40 yards, and it is bordered by stunted trees and bushes.16 ' At a well, near a largish tree, we met a party, consisting of the Italian traveller Julietti, an officer of the £ Esploratore,’ and several seamen who were returning from an expedition to the neigh bouring hills. “Presently Sultan Burhan arrived. He is an intelligent fine looking man, about six feet in height, and inclining to corpulence. “ In face and feature he hears a very strong resemblance to the late Subedar IHahomed Hamal, of the Aden Police, who accompanied Captain Burton to Harrar in 1857, and whose portrait forms the frontispiece to “ First Footsteps in Eastern Africa.” “ I accompanied the Sultan to the village ol Marghiblah, situated about 300 yards westward of the torrent bed. “ It consists of upw ards of 30 mat huts, each of which has a small yard attached to it. “ In one of these houses we commenced our con versation. The Sultan would only allow one other Dankali to be present. “ Here it may be mentioned that all the Hankalis whom we saw appeared very favourably disposed towards the English, and one and all were ready to give information, truthful or otherwise, for a cou- mderation. “ The Sultan commenced by stating that he had sold the Italians three islands. “ I endeavoured to ascertain the terms and con ditions of the sale, but failed, and had almost given up hopes of getting at the actual state of affairs, when opportunely Abdi Samunter arrived with Ahmed Ali (a cousin of the Sultan). “ At this time the Sultan had gone off to dinner, and I was able to ascertain from Ahmed Ali that, so far as he knew, only one island, named Um-al- Bakar, had been sold to the Italians. “ He himself had been present at the sale, and the purchase w r as made outright and conveyed signoral rights. “ I told him the Sultan stated he had sold three ether islands, when he said it was possible that he might have done so in his absence at Baheita. “ I then told him to go and ask the Sultan. In about half an hour both returned, and after clearing the hut of visitors we shut the door and spoke with bated breath. “ The following is the result of my inquiries, and X believe is the correct account of the whole trans action, it being corroborated from a variety of sources, and bearing probability on the face of it. “ In the beginning of 1870, the Italians, at the instance of IVIr. Bubattino, sent an agent to Assab Bay to endeavour to purchase it and there establish a coaling depdt. “ They succeeded in obtaining a piece of ground on the mainland, but before the end of the year they left, and their flag w^as hauled down by the Egyptians. ‘‘Early in 1871, a second attempt was made.17 * Includes Hadmeli, f Includes Tulkbus. | This is the Darmabah of the map.— A. W. M. when Sultan Burhan told them he would not sell but would lease to them at 8100 a year the island of Um-al-Bakar (not Fatmah, as stated in the Aden Besidency records). “ Two years’ rent was paid down, that is, 200 dollars, and for a short time it was occupied and a little coal landed there. At the same time the position on the mainland was again reoccupied. “ By the end of 1871, the attempt to establish a coaling station was abandoned. “In January 1880, Sapeto and Amezaga visited Assab, without difficulty. They purchased from Ibrahim Ahmed and Abdulla Shaham (independent Dankali Shaikhs, owning the coast from Jebel- Masab to Bar-rasuli near Bailul) a piece of ground about a mile square, just inside Bas Lomah, in Assab Bay. “ For this concession they paid upwards of 8,000 dollars. They purchased also outright, from Sultan Burhan, the island of Um-al-Bakar.* To obtain this they paid 800 dollars arrears of rent, and 1,000 dollars down. “ On the 29th of February, Her Majesty’s ship ‘ Philomel ’ visited Assab Bay. Sultan Burhan then told Captain Berners that he had not sold any islands, but was ready to do so. “ Captains Berners asked him to wait for two months, and he understood that he consented to wait one month. “ It is obvious that Sultan Burhan concealed the fact of the sale of Um-al-Bakar, and he stated to me that he made no direct promise to Captain Berners as to waiting. “ He probably expected to be paid for delay; at any rate, three days after the ‘Philomel’ left, Sapeto and Amezaga came to him, and he sold them the three islands of Fatmah,f Darmakiah, and Arokiah. “ It is here observed that there is no island called Darmabah, as stated in the chart; the largest of the group is named Italib.J “ He alleges that the sale of these and the former island was one by which the ownership and sovereign authority passed absolutely to the Italians, and he has no jurisdiction over the territory dis posed of. “ He refused to tell me the price, as he stated he had sworn not to do so on condition of the Italians protecting him against Egypt and Turkey. “The dread of these Powers interfering with him seemed very strong, and he hinted that if the British Government would give him a similar guarantee, he would do his best to annul the pur chases, and disclose the price. “ I, of course, did not press him to break his oath, nor did I at all like to hold out any prospect of such a guarantee as he desired, knowing that the question of Egyptian authority over the African littoral of the Bed Sea was not yet finally settled. “ It is possible that the Sultan’s story may not be reliable, but I am disposed to believe it, because 4076. elie did not disclose it voluntarily. It was only after repeated questioning as to why he took such an oath that I obtained from him what certainly seems a plausible explanation. “ It seems to me that, under the circumstances, all I could do was to prevent any more islands passing into the hands of the Italians. I accord ingly wrote out a short Arabic agreement, which the Sultan readily signed, to the effect that, in con sideration of my paying him 200 dollars, he would not sell any more islands for two months. This agreement is dated the 22nd March 1880. “ It was by this time 4.30 p.m., and it took Captain Berners and I an hour and a half to get back to the ship, by which time it was too late to get away from our anchorage, as the navigation of the bay requires daylight. “ On the morning of the 23rd we weighed anchor and steamed up to the Italian settlement, where we were received by an officer of the £ Esplora- tore,’ Mr. Sapeto having gone to Marghiblah in the ‘ Ischia,’ probably to ascertain from the Sultan what had been done. “ The Italian man-of-war flag was flying at Assab, which we left at 8 a.m.; we reached Aden at 9 a.m. on the 24th instant. “ The Sultan further stated that the Italians had wished to purchase all the islands from Eas Sintaur to Has Lomah and also the shores of the bay, including the watercourse; this may or may not be the case, as naturally the Sultan would like to play off one nationality against the other. “ At any rate the facts have to be met, that the Sultan and Shaikhs of the Dankali have sold a piece of the mainland and all the most useful islands in Assab Bay to Mr. Sapeto in presence of Captain Amezaga. If the Bubattino Company are the owners, being subjects of King Humbert, the place has become an Italian colony, which can at any time be used for warlike purposes, or fortified. “ Whoever finds the money, all the superin tendence is performed by officers of the £ Esplora- tore ’ and ‘ Ischia,’ and the men of those vessels were engaged when I visited the settlement in lime-pointing the outside of Mr. Sapeto’s house. “ The development of trade is but a flimsy pre text ; none of the natives believe that any will be ■attracted owing to the insecurity of the roads from the interior; even the Italian officer who received us at Assab smiled incredulously when we asked if the merchandise expected by Sapeto had arrived. “ The capabilities of the place are great, and in time of war it could be converted into a far more commodious rendezvous for vessels of war than Aden. Water is abundant close to the sea. “ The main entrance to the bay is only 3 to 4 miles wide, and could be effectually commanded by guns on the mainland and Jeziral-Eatmah, to say nothing of torpedoes. The other entrance, between Eas Sintaur and Tulphus, could equally well be* Shaikh Said is a small bay on the Arabian coast opposite Perim, just outside the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb.—A. VV.

Vessels can lie within 100 yards of Ura-al-Bakar on the west side in dead smooth water all the year round. “ Altogether, the place is so well suited for war like and so ill adapted for peaceable purposes, that it is hard to believe the present energy and expen diture of Messrs. Sapeto and Amezaga had their sole origin in the harmless desire of Mr. Rubattino to possess a coaling station of his own in the Red Sea, or in his plausible determination to assist in the development of that commerce which the Italian Minister recently taunted the British Foreign Office with the desire to stifle. “ The article which occurred in the ‘ Echo ’ of the 21st November last foreshadowed the whole Italian policy. “ In connection with this matter, it may he mentioned that the French man-of-war * Fabert ’ recently visited Obokh, where the limits of the French possessions were marked out with white stones, and presents given to the Shaikhs of the neighbourhood. “ Further, I saw at Assab a brother of Ali Thabit, the Hakami Shaikh who sold Shaikh Said* to the French. “ Any day the Porte may allow some other foreign Power to quietly buy that place from the local Shaikh unless steps be taken to prevent it.” In submitting the foregoing Report,f the Resi dent observed :—“ As the sale of the islands near “ Assab has been completed, nothing further can “ be done by the Residency to restrain Italy from “ forming a strong fortified position in the Red “ Sea, and such steps as may be deemed necessary “ to defeat any such object on the part of the “ Italian Government will have to be made either “ through .Egypt or by England direct to the Italian “ Government, and I am humbly of opinion no time “ should be lost in adopting such decisive measures “ as the case now appears to me to demand.” The result of Captain Hunters inquiries with the views of General Loch, as above, was reported to the Secretary of State on the 21th March by a tele gram from the Resident, which was sent on to the Foreign Office, J with the remark that, as it appeared that the Sheikh of Raheita had already sold to the Italians all the islands in Assab Bay that would be of value to them, an agreement with him of the nature which had been under discussion would be of no practical use. On the 30th March, the Viceroy telegraphed§ that he would be glad to have early news of any decision taken by Her Majesty’s Government in consequence of the Italians having, as reported by the Senior Naval Officer at Aden, hoisted their man-of-war flag at Assab Bay. In fact, no definite decision has, up to this time, been taken ; but with a view of marking by a formal act the recognition by Her Majesty’s Government of the jurisdiction of the Viceroy of' Egypt over that part of the coast, |[Mr. Zohrab, Her Majesty’s Consul at Jeddah, was appointed by Lord Salisbury to act also in a similai capacity at Assab Bay. The appointment was notified in the “ London Gazette ” of the 9th Apiil last. It now remains to notice the diplomatic action of the Foreign Office since the Resident’s telegrams of January indicated that the question might become one of gravity. On the 9th January* Lord Salisbury telegraphed to Mr. Malet at Cairo to try and induce the Egyptian Government to send a ship of war to Assab, with instructions to hoist the Turkish flag, and to prevent Messrs. Rubattino from seizing any ground to which they had not a legitimate right. Mr. Malet communicated accordingly with Mous- tapha Eehmy Pasha, whom, however, he found unwilling to act.*}* His Excellency said that it was difficult, now that the Italians were actually at Assab, to send a man-of-war there to hoist the Turkish flag. It would have the appearance of taking possession, and would weaken the claim of the Egyptian Government that the whole coast was already theirs. He said, in addition, that it would have a hostile appearance, and might even lead to conflict with the Italians, which would bring the Egyptian Government into definite antagonism with the Italian Government. He was inclined to suggest a formal protest against the landing of the Italians, but he feared it was too late to dislodge them. Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Paris was at the some time instructed} to inform the French Go vernment of what was going on, and ask for their co-operation in the matter. Lord Lyons replied, on the 10 th January, that the French Minister for Foreign Affairs said that he had no information on the subject, that he was taken quite unawares, but that he would have the question examined at once, and give an answer as soon as he was in a position to do so.§ Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Rome was also instructed || to inquire of the Italian Government whether they were aware of Captain Amezaga’s in tentions in respect to Assab, and whether they had authorized them. Sir A. Paget replied on the 7th January in a telegram,afterwards amplified in a Despatch (No. 10), of which the following are extracts :— * From Foreign Office, 12th January 1880, No. 30. f From Mr. Malet, No. 30, elated 14th January 1880. | From Foreign Office, dated 12th January 1880, No. 12. § There is nothing on record here of any further communication with the French Government on this subject.— A.

Cairoli and himself. They are reported in my Despatch, No. 413, of the 20th November, and No. 460, of the 6th December last.** ** ^ ante &gt; PP- 5 and 7. * * * # “ Admiral Acton, the present Minister of Marine, Count Maffei said, had been so solicitous that21 nothing should be done which might possibly give rise to a false interpretation of the proceedings of the Italian Government in connection with this expedition, that he had caused a further telegram to be sent to Captain Amezaga at Port Said, to be careful to conform precisely to his instructions. “ Count Maffei then read me a telegram from Captain Amezaga, in command of the 4 Esploratore/ dated Aden, the 31st ultimo, in which he announces that he had 4 assisted the operations of the Messina ” (belonging to Messrs. Pubattino), that 4 the last instalment of the purchase money had 4 been paid, that everything had gone off well, and 4 no interference from any foreign Power.’ 44 1 ashed Count Maffei whether this last instal ment had been paid by Captain Amezaga, and, if not, why he alluded to it. He replied that it had been paid by Messrs. Pubattino’s agent, and was only mentioned by Captain Amezaga as showing that the business had been completed, the agent of Messrs. Pubattino not having the means of com municating in cipher with his principals. 44 With regard to the statement in your Lordship’s telegram that Assab Bay belongs to Egypt, Count Maffei said the Italian Government could not admit this, and he contended that Messrs. Pubattino had a perfectly good title in the purchase they had effected with the local ruler. Her Majesty’s Government had disputed, up to 1870 I understood him to say, the right of the Porte (and therefore of course of Egypt) to the sovereignty of districts further to the north in the Ped Sea than Assab, as was shown by the Blue Book respecting the Abyssinian expedition, a resume of which had been prepared with other papers for presentation to the Italian Parliament. Count Maffei sent for these papers, but I had not time to examine them carefully, and I asked him if he would let me have a copy of them. This he was kind enough to promise to do, and I have just received them with a note, in which he says:— 44 4 1 send you a copy of all the printed documents about Assab Bay. Pemember that none of them have been made public, and you must consider this communication as strictly confidential. But I hope it will persuade you that we intend to make no mystery with you on a question in which we have no arriere-pensee, and in which we think we have every right on our side.’ 44 My telegram of this morning was sent before receiving them ; and on looking over them I find that the correspondence referred to in the Blue Book respecting the Turkish occupation of Desser, Adoolis, and Edd, to the north of Assab Bay, took place in 1862, though there is a letter from Mr. Beke respecting other districts, dated July 1870, which may possibly explain Count Maffei’s impression that the sovereignty of the Porte over the first-named districts had been disputed by Her Majesty’s Government up to the latter date. 44 The first amongst the printed documents is the 4076. F ifcontract of purchase passed between the agents of Messrs. Kubattino and the Sultans Abdullah Schiahim, Hassan-Eben-Ahmad, and Ibrahim-Eben- Ahmad ; and there is nothing to show that the Italian Government was a party to the transaction, although it is stated in para. 4 that the purchasers are to have ‘ the full right of establishing them- 4 selves as they may think best, and to hoist the ‘ national flag in token of their absolute ownership ‘ (“ padronanza ”) of the place.’ “ The other documents, however, will show that after the purchase the right of acquisition was defended by the Italian Government in its com munications with the Egyptian Government as an affair of State, and not as one of private contract, some of the despatches from the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs to the Agent and Consul General in Egypt having almost a comminatory character. In the despatch indeed from M. Visconti Venosta, of the 19th May 1871, it is stated that though Signor llubattino had become ‘the private pro- ‘ prietor of the territory of Assab, the Eoyal ‘ Government had become its Sovereign.’ I shall not fail to draw Count Maffei’s attention to these circumstances, which seem hardly con sistent with the declaration that the Italian Govern ment has no official connection with Signor Eubattino’s establishment. “At the same time, it is only right to recall the fact that at the time M. Visconti Venosta’s despatch was written the Italian Government did entertain the project (as mentioned in my Despatch, No. 443 above alluded to) of establishing a penal colony on the coast of the Red Sea, but that this project was afterwards abandoned, and has not since been revived. , * „——— v.v.o j-umun vjrovern- n ^ therefore he given in perfect good faith. Both M. Cairoh and Count Maffei are perfectly aware, from my own declarations, that any attempt of the Italian Government to create a naval or military station in those districts would not he viewed with indifference by Her Majesty’s Govern ment, and they have both admitted that they perfectly understand the importance which Her M T! t7 * Govern x ^ en t must attach to this subiect. At the same time I may mention confidentially, having heard from Prince Teano, the President of no S0C1 1f hl R ° me ’ that 11 was with no htt e difficulty on the part of that Society and the ^ Chamber of Commerce at Milan that the Ministry was induced to lend them the presence of a ship of war at the present time, a fact which \\ould appear to indicate no very great earnestness m the matter on the part of the Italian Govern! ment. Prince Teano dilated on the great annov an C e wh 1C h the members of the Society of “hich he is the head had experienced at Zeilaf and their consequent anxiety to find another startW-nofn he Ohamb^T 't t ^ and he ^fdTat ber 01 Commerce at Milan would- * From Foreign Office, 31st January 1880, No. 80. 23 endeavour to carry on trade with the interior from Assab Bay.” In a second Despatch, dated the following dav (8th January 1880, No. 12),* Sir A. Paget re ported :— I called on Count Maffei this morning, and read to him your Lordship’s telegram, No. 3, of yesterday’s date. “ On hearing the intelligence received from the Resident at Aden, Count Maffei threw up his hands in astonishment, and said he wondered what next would be reported from Aden. “ It was almost needless for him to say that it was absolutely false. No Italian troop ships were gone or going to the Red Sea, and the Italian Government had no intention of sending any ship whatever to hoist the Italian flag in Assab Bav. He had nothing to add, he said, or to detract from what he and M. Cairoli had told me all alon' in regard to this affair. “I said that, for the sake of correctness, I should like to read him the reports I had made to your Lordship of my conversations with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and himself on this subject, and I proceeded to do so. “ Count Maffei confirmed their complete accu- racy, excepting where I state in my Despatch, No. 443, that 1 Some ten or eleven years ago ‘ Captain Amezaga, of the Italian navy, had been 4 employed by the Italian Marine Department upon 4 a hydrographical exploration, &amp;c.’ “ He thought I had misunderstood him in men tioning Captain Amezaga as having been employed on this service. He was under the impression that it was not Captain Amezaga, but another officer, who had been thus employed; but he said it -was a point of no consequence, and he only made the observation in case my despatch should appear in a Blue Book. Count Maffei also observed, with reference to the concluding paragraph of the same Despatch, e that they had no idea of raising a ques- ‘ tion as to the sovereignty of the district in question, ‘ which they presumed belonged in fact to the Porte, &amp;c.; that Avhen he said that, the papers he sent me yesterday had not yet been printed, and that he had not yet read at that early stage of the question all the correspondence which had formerly been exchanged. Therefore, when he said that iii his opinion the sovereignty over the territory of Assab might perhaps belong to the Porte, he meant to express that between Egypt and Turkey he thought the latter would have the more reasonable ground to claim such a right than the former, but he added that as the Italian Government had no intention of annexation, or of exercising any right of sovereignty, the matter did not appear to him of great importance. “ In reply to this, I said that I must own that the perusal of the documents he had been so good as to send me had made me take a somewhat adifferent view of the case from that which I had formed in consequence of the assurances which had been given me by himself and M. Cairoli, and w r hich had represented the affair as being a purely private and commercial transaction on the part of Messrs E/iibattino, with which the Italian Govern ment had no concern, except to give it their countenance, and, as such, had appeared to me very innocent and unobjectionable. But the docu ments went to show that, although the act of purchase was in the name of Messrs. Bubattino’s agents, and that there was nothing to prove that the Italian Government had any concern in it, nevertheless, as soon as the purchase had been effected, the Italian Government did appear on the scene, and defended the rights of Messrs. Rubattino as if they had been those of the Government; and I drew Count Maffei’s attention especially to the Despatch from M. Visconti Venosta to the Agent and Consul General in Cairo of the 19th May 1871, in which he says that, though Signor Ilubattino had become ‘ the private proprietor of the territory * of Assab, the Royal Government had become its 4 Sovereign.’ I confessed that I had difficulty in reconciling this with the representations which had been made to me. “ Count Maffei gave me the explanation which, as your Lordship will have seen from my Despatch of yesterday, I presumed that he might, viz., that at that period the Italian Government entertained the project of establishing a penal colony on the coast of the Red Sea, in which case they would have availed themselves of Messrs. Rubattino’s purchase; they were, therefore, of course, solici tous in establishing their rights of ownership and sovereignty; but the case was now, Count Maffei said, entirely different; the idea of a penal colony or any other Government establishment in those regions had been given up, and, excepting giving to Messrs. Rubattino, the Geographical Society, and any Italian subjects engaged in trade the protec tion to which Italian subjects all over the world were entitled, the Italian Government had nothing whatever to do with this enterprise. “ Count Maffei added that it appeared very pro blematical whether the ideas of opening up a trade from Assab with the interior would ever come to anything. Supposing it did, and some houses of commerce were eventually established there, he presumed that the occasional visit of one or two Italian men-of-war to look after the interests of the colonists could not be a cause of offence to any Power. “ What Her Majesty’s Government might rely upon was, that it would never be made a naval station—that is to say, that never any fortress, or arsenal, or works of that kind would be erected there. The Italian Government were fully aware of the objections which would be raised by England to this, and he might tell me, confidentially, that when the question of aiding Messrs. Rubattino’sm V 26 enterprise was debated in M. Cairoli’s late Cabinet, some of the members were opposed to doing any thing, on account of the objections which England might put forward; but it being represented, on the other hand, that what it was proposed to do was in itself of so innocent a character that no Power could take exception to it, the proposal had been carried. “ Upon my remarking to Count Maffei that the right conceded to Messrs. Rubattino to hoist the national flag might perhaps be interpreted as con stituting an act of sovereigntjr, he replied that this might be so if the flag was hoisted as an act of the Italian Government, but he presumed that if Messrs, itubattino thought fit to fly their national colours over their establishment no one could object to this. “ This conversation with Count Maffei has, I must say, removed the misgivings which I felt after reading the documents which were communi cated to me yesterday, and, taken in connection with the previous assurances received on the same subject, it seems to me impossible to doubt the goodwill with which the Italian Government dis claim any idea of conquest or annexation in the regions referred to.” * Sir A. Paget to Lord Salisbury, No. 13, dated 9th January 1880. f From Foreign Office, 12th January 1880, No. 30. t From Foreign Office, 23rd January 1880, No. 61. The meaning of Count Maffei’s statement, as recorded in the foregoing Despatch, was explained by him, in a Note* to Sir A. Paget, to be that there was no idea “ of founding a military establishment “ nor a new Italian kingdom on the Red Sea,” but that, “ as a matter of principle,” the Italian Government wished to make it clearly under stood that the question of sovereignty over Assab Bay must remain unprejudiced, for, till evident proof of the contrary was produced, in their opinion, neither the Porte nor Egypt had a right to exercise or claim it. Upon receipt of Sir A. Paget’s telegram, of the 7th January, Lord Salisbury desired him (9th January )f to express to Count Maffei the “ great satisfaction ” with which Her Majesty’s Government had received his denial of the truth of the report received from Aden, but at the same time to inform him that whatever opinions might have been expressed before 1870, about the effect of which opinions Lord Salisbury was not expressing a judgment, there could be no doubt now, in the judgment of Her Majesty’s Government, that Assab Bay belonged to Egypt. Sir A. Paget made a written communication to Count Maffei in the above sense, and, in reporting his having done so (Despatch, No. 16, dated 10th January 1880), wrote:—f 44 1 may mention that I had yesterday afternoon some further conversation with Count Maffei respecting the Assab question ; and in the course of my remarks I said that, on further thinking over this matter, it appeared to me that the danger did not lie in any immediate intention of the Italian 4076. G26 Government to take formal possession of Assab Bay. The assurances which I had received were sufficient to set at rest any apprehensions on this score ; but what I feared was that, by the force of circumstances, the Italian Government might perhaps eventually be obliged to do so. Supposing, for instance, that the small beginnings of Messrs. Bubattino should ultimately lead to the growth of an important Italian commercial settlement in the Bay of Assab, it stood to reason that there must be some authority in the place for the maintenance of order, the regulation of the port, &amp;c. It w r as to be foreseen that the Italian Government would not admit the presence of a native authority, and they would therefore have to send one of their own. Would not this amount to annexation and sove reignty ? Then, again, supposing the Egyptian Government raised the question of sovereignty, and disputed the proprietary rights of Messrs. Bubattiuo, what line did the Italian Government intend to take ? Both of these points, I said, appeared to me deserving of consideratiou. “ Count Maffei replied to the first that he thought it extremely improbable that the settlement would ever grow into the proportions to which I had alluded, but even if it did it would not necessarilv entail an act of annexation or sovereign!v on the part of the Italian Government. A vessel or two of the Italian navy stationed in the bay would be quite sufficient for the purpose of maintaining order, &amp;c., and he did not see how their presence could ever be a source of umbrage to Great Britain, even if it should be found necessary to have a storehouse to supply the wants of such ships. I said that this would be rather like getting in the thin end of the wedge, and that I did not think it would be seen with pleasure, to which Count Maffei replied that, provided no military works, such as an arsenal, fortification, or anything of that kind, were erected, which he could undertake to say would never be done by this or any other Italian Govern ment, he did not see how any objection could fairly be made by any other Power. “ In regard to the Egyptian Government raising the question of sovereignty and disputing Messrs. Bubattino’s proprietary rights, he really could not see wby they should do this. Messrs. Bubattino had bought the property from the owners of the soil they w ere a private firm, and so long as nothing was done constituting an act of annexation or sovereignty by another Power, Count Maffei said he could not see for what reason the Egyptian Government should question or dispute the title of Messrs. Bubattino, or endeavour to disturb them in the peaceable enjoyment of their possession.” Count Maffei replied to Sir A. Paget’s communi- eation of Lord Salisbury’s views in a Note, dated ic 12th January, m which, after expressing regret at not having been able to see Sir A. Paget on business, he continued :—* “ 1 also wanted to express the still greater regret • From Foreign Office, 2oth Fcbru; 1880, No. 149.I felt in receiving your note of last Saturday, by which you inform me Lord Salisbury thinks that, whatever opinions may have been pronounced before 1870, about the effect of which opinions- he is not expressing a judgment, there can be no doubt now, according to the views of Her Majesty’s Government, that Assab Bay belongs to Egypt. “Well, we find it is rather hard to believe that what was white before and up to 1870 has suddenly and without any tangible fact become black. “But even admitting Lord Salisbury’s theory, or to speak more correctly, dato ma non concesso, as Italian lawyers say, that the Bay of Assab really belongs to Egypt, we have too high an opinion of Lord Salisbury’s fairness and good feeling towards us to suppose for one moment he would interfere in a matter concerning Italy and Egypt alone. “ At all events, I beg to state again that we wish to leave the question of sovereignty quite unpre judiced—that is to say, w r e do not want to trespass on anybody’s claims, but at the same time we also intend to reserve as a Government any right arising, according to the law of nations, from the purchase of Assab by an Italian firm.” On the 17th January Lord Salisbury addressed the following Despatch (No. 25) to Sir A. January p aget “ The Italian Charge d’Affaires spoke to me on the 15th instant with reference to Assab Bay. He gave an account of the objects of Messrs Bubattino in seeking to establish a coaling station in that bay, and he informed me that he was charged in the most formal manner to assure me that there was no political or naval object connected with the esta blishment which they were setting up, and that the Italian Government had no designs of that kind. At the same time he claimed our sympathy for the enterprise of Messrs. Bubattino as one of a purely commercial character, which we should naturally desire to countenance. “ I informed him that Her Majesty’s Govern ment had naturally a sympathy for all enterprises of a commercial character, and wished them success, for the development of trade was beneficial to all the world ; but with reference to this particular enterprise of Messrs. Bubattino, and their desire to establish a coaling depot in Assab Bay, it was a matter upon which that firm must communicate with the Egyptian Government, in whose territory the bay lay. The decision of such a question would rest entirely with the Khedive’s Government. But adverting to his disclaimer of any political designs on the part of the Italian Government, I repre sented to him more than once that England was particularly sensitive as to all that concerned the shores of the Bed Sea, and that I was very glad on that account to receive his assurance that no political objects were being pursued in that neigh bourhood by the Italian Government, and that no28 i naval or military establishments were contem plated.” On the the 7th February Lord Salisbury, in a further Despatch (No. 51), expressed the views of Her Majesty’s Government on the question raised by Count Maffei’s Note of the 12th January, as follows :—* “ The language of Count Maffei’s Note makes it necessary that I should point out to you somewhat more in detail the grounds upon which Her Majesty’s Government hold that Assab Bay is undoubtedly part of the Ottoman dominion, and is included within the Khedivate of Egypt. “ As the Italian Government disclaim the acqui sition of, or the desire of acquiring, any political rights whatever with respect to that coast, the matter is not one of pressing political importance; but circumstances might arise which would make it of importance that the considerations which establish the rights of the Ottoman Government in this respect should be upon record. I do not for the purpose desire to lead your Excellency through the history of this coast ab antique, or to detail the various claims which in more distant times have been made in regard to it. It is sufficient to show that in recent years the Ottoman Government, and, by virtue of the rights of the Ottoman Govern ment, also the Khedive of Egypt, have performed undoubted acts of ownership, and have recorded their claims in documents of a public character. “ In 1866 a new firman was issued by the Porte to the Khedive of Egypt, under which the Kaima- kamate of Massowah was included in the de pendencies belonging to the Viceroy, and the fact that Assab Bay falls within that Kaimakamate has never been questioned. In pursuance of the powers thus entrusted to the Khedive of Egypt, and of the ancient claims made by Egypt to Zeila, Berbera, and Bulbar, an Egyptian Governor, Momtaz Pasha, was formally appointed for the whole coast from Suez to Cape Guardafui. Whatever controversy might be raised at the time with respect to the territory outside the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, the firman of 1866, to which I have referred, gave to this act of jurisdiction on the part of the Egyptian Government a sufficient authority; and the fact that it was not contested at the time, and that its validity has not been since impugned, must be held to be conclusive evidence of the justice of the claim advanced respectively on behalf of the Govern ments of Constantinople and of Cairo. In 1873 a new firman was issued by the Porte to the Khedive, and again the Kaimakamate of Massowah, with its dependencies, was declared to be a portion of the hereditary appanage of the Khedive’s family. These acts of jurisdiction, which intimate no doubt to the right of the Sovereign to bestow or the Khedive to receive, the jurisdiction thus assigned to him, are sufficient to establish a sovereignty over * From Foreign Office, 25th February 1880, No. 149.29 territory to which indeed no adverse title has ever been advanced. “ Whatever acts, therefore, may now or at a later period he performed in respect to them, or whatever claims may be advanced, Her Majesty’s Government can adopt no other course than to continue to respect that which they believe to be the legitimate sovereignty of the coast, and which, according to their judgment, unquestionably resides in the ruler of Egypt, governing under the firman of the Sultan of Turkey. To hold that that sovereignty, so formally claimed and exercised, can be invalidated or interrupted by the action of any local Chief would be a principle dangerous in its general application, and to which Her Majesty’s Government could not with propriety give their assent. I repeat that I have no ground for thinking that either any present circumstances or any con tingency that is at all probable will give to this subject, as regards the interests of Great Britain, more than a speculative importance. But as I think it desirable that the Italian Government should be placed fully in possession of our views upon it, and that the freeest communications on such matters should take place between the two Governments, I request your Excellency to leave a copy of this despatch, quite confidentially, with Count Maffei.” With this Despatch the correspondence seems for a time to have dropped, but it was revived on the communication to Her Majesty’s Ambassador at home of the telegrams received from Aden relative to the purchase of the islands. On the 7th April, Sir A. Paget addressed the following De- “ As it appears, from the enclosures which your Lordship has done me the honour to transmit in your Despatches, Nos. 133 and 136, of the 26th March and the 1st instant, that the Governor of Aden is under the apprehension that the position acquired in Assab Bay by Signor Bubattino may possibly eventually be converted into a fortified Government settlement, it has seemed to me de sirable, notwithstanding the verbal assurances which have been given to me by the President of the Council, Minister for Foreign Affairs, and by Count Maffei in a contrary sense, as reported in previous Despatches, to obtain an official declaration in writin 0 * from the Italian Government that such a course will not now or any future time be taken. “ For this purpose I have been in verbal com munication with Count Maffei in the first instance, and subsequently with M. Cairoli. “The language which I have held to them on this subject has been to the following effect : — “ ‘ The assurances which have been given to me 4 by both the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the 4 Secretary General of that Department as to the 4 Italian Government being entirely disconnected 4076. H From Foreign Office, 6th May 1880, spatch (No. 155 A.) to Lord Salisbury :—* 329* A • 1 P 1 1 '■H i .twin . MM30 * with Signor Rubattino’s establishment in the Bay * of Assab, excepting in so far as affording it the * protection of a ship of war, and as to the Italian * Government having no intention of annexing that * territory to the Italian Crown, or of making an * arsenal or raising any kind of fortification or ‘ military work in those parts, have been explicit ‘ and precise. There can, therefore, be no reason ‘ to doubt that so long as the present Cabinet is in * office they will be strictly adhered to. But as a ‘ change of Ministry sooner or later in Italy must * be foreseen, it is desirable that there should be ‘ some more formal engagement than has yet been ‘ entered into, which should bind future Adminis- * trations as well as the present one to respect the ‘ assurances which have been given. This seems ‘ to be the more necessary in consequence of its 4 now appearing that Signor Rubattino is about to * purchase, if he has not already done so, certain ‘ islands in the Bay of Assab, for what commercial 4 purpose it is not easy to understand.’ 44 It is only due to both M. Cairoli and Count Maffei to say that I have not found the slightest disinclination on their part to give me the declara tion I was anxious to obtain. The only question has been as to the form in w r hich it could be made. 44 My original intention was to address a note to M. Cairoli recapitulating the assurances which I had received, and asking for a confirmation of them in writing; but Count Maffei having mentioned, in the course of a recent conversation, that it was intended to address me a note in reply to the argu ments contained in your Lordship’s Despatch, No. 51, of the 7th February, relative to the ques tion of sovereignty over Assab Bay, and having suggested that at the close of that note a declara tion such as I desired might be inserted, I gave my assent to this mode of proceeding, and, in order to make sure of this declaration being in conformity with the understanding we had come to upon it, I wrote down at once and read to Count Maffei the telegram which I addressed to your Lordship on my return home yesterday afternoon. 44 Count Maffei informed me that I should pro bably receive the note in question in time for the messenger the day after to-morrow; at all events, it would reach me, he said, a day or two later, and could be forwarded by post.” The promised note wus sent to Sir .A.. Faget by the Italian Premier, Signor Cairoli, on the 19th April 1880, with an historical 44 Memoire.” The latter is too long for quotation at length, and is mainly devoted to establish that the coast of the Red Sea, in the vicinity of Assab Bay and some distance to the north of it, never formed part of the Kaimakamate of Massowah, but in fact belonged to Abyssinia. In support of this view various opinions of British Consular Officers between 1847 and 1862, extracted from Blue Books, are quoted, as well as■Ir.■*- f - i, - i- -&gt;-• —. ''—^S * “ 3'he tract of territory which extends from the west coast of the Red Rea, from the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb to the north, belongs geographically to the adjacent Abyssinian empire, which seems, however, not to have governed any portion of it for centuries. Legally, this Abyssinian coast has belonged to the Ottoman Porte since 1558, when the Turks drove the Portuguese from the Red Sea, and took possession of it in the name of the Sultan as Caliph ; they, however, only occupied the islands of Massowah and Souakin, and at intervals certain points of the coast, but it is this coast practically which belongs to the various native local tribes who now claim its independence.” 31 one of Dr. Beke,* an authority on the subject. The M^moire concluded as follows :— “ In opposition to our contention is adduced the fact of an Egyptian official, Momtaz Pasha, having been named by the Viceroy, after the firman of 1866, as Governor of the whole of the coast from Suez to Cape Guardafui. “ It does not, indeed, appear that any such plenary jurisdiction has at any time been exercised by any one whatsoever in the name of the Khedive. At all events, such nomination was never notified by any document from which the Powers could take cognizance of this new extension of Egyptian sovereignty. “ The firman of 1873, as has been noticed, does nothing more than confirm, with regard to the extent of the investiture, that of 1866. Neither can it be invoked as an authority for an altered political status of the region situated between Mas sowah and Bab-el-Mandeb, along the western shore of the Bed Sea. Hence we consider that we are still at the present day in a position to affirm that the said district, and particularly the Bay of Assab, together with the territory and islands adjoining, neither are nor have ever been subjected either to the Ottoman dominion or to the Egyptian administra tion, and that, on the contrary, such Chieftains or Sultans as have exercised or do exercise sovereign authority there ought to be regarded as autono mous, and exempt from any allegiance or vassalage towards any other Sovereign whatsoever.” The text of Signor Cairoli’s Note forwarding the “ Memoire ” was as follows :— “ (Particuli^re.) Borne, “ M. I’Ambassadeur, le 19 Avril 1880. “ Le Memoire ci-joint resume notre pensee a Tegard de Taffaire d*Assab. Les donnees qu’il contient sont puisees, comme son Excellence peut voir, dans les pieces officielles du Blue Book ‘ Abyssinia, 1846—1868.’ C’est surtout d’apres ces pieces que notre c mviction s’est formee jusqu a preuve du contraire (et cette preuve nous parait desormais bien difficule l\ fournir), nous devons penser que le Sultan de Beheita, avec lequel M. Bubattino a negoci6, avait, sur la contree dont il s’agit, non pas seulement des droits de propriety, mais encore un droit incontestable de souve- rainetA “ La position du Gouvernement Italien vis-a-vis du territoire d’Assab est done r^glee, ainsi que j’ai eu I’honneur de le declarer a la Chambre, par les principes memes du droit international, et il ne depend pas de notre volante de nous soustraire aux corollaires juridiques de ces principes. “ La question 6tant ainsi poseedans ses vcritables termes, nous n’avons nullement la pretention de la eonsid4rer comme etant d6finitivement resolue par le fait seul de notre opinion. Nous admettons, au contraire, qu’elie ne doit pas etre consideiAe comme prejugee en droit dans un sens ni dans 1’autre. Mais ce que nous demandons, c’est que, notre point 4076. I |4of public law, the right of sovereignty to the Italian Government. “ In 1871 a correspondence commenced between the Italian and Egyptian Governments on the matter, the latter putting forward a claim to these territories on the ground of the firman of in vestiture of 1866. But the subject was dropped,, as the Rubattino Company seemed at that time unwilling to carry out the plan. The Company has, however, lately taken the matter up again, being fully aware of the importance of establishing a factory at Assab, now that they have inaugurated their maritime service along the Red Sea. “The Bay of Assab has, moreover, other ad vantages. Many indications go to prove that the commerce of Europe will be able to avail itself of this road to reach the highlands of Abyssinia. “ The duty of the Italian Government is there fore clear. Since Assab is a locality almost uninhabited, and surrounded by nomad and primi tive populations, it was but prudent to give pro tection to the young factory, and instructions were accordingly given in this sense to the * Esploratore,’ which, with another small vessel, was charged with a hydrographic exploration of the Red Sea. “ I think that the Government has done its duty, and will obtain the approval of the Parliament, when, moreover, it is borne in mind that any suspicions as to political aims are out of the question, since the Bay of Assab will never have a military importance. Assab will be of importance to us only from a commercial point of view, and possibly also for scientific purposes, for those of our travellers who may prefer this to any other way for reaching the highlands of Abyssinia.” In forwarding these papers to Lord Salisbury (Despatch, No. 168, dated 21st April 1880), Sir A. Paget observed:— “The Note, as your Lordship will perceive, contends that the Sultan of Raheita, with whom M. Rubattino negotiated, had not only rights of property but of sovereignty over Assab Bay, and that the position of the Italian Government is therefore regulated by the principles of international law, in further development of which M. Cairoli refers to his recent declarations in the Chamber, a copy and translation of which I also enclose. “ The Note states, however, that the Italian Government have by no means the pretension of considering the question as definitively resolved by the fact of their opinion. “ They admit, on the contrary, that it should not be considered prejudged in one sense or another. The Note explains the views and aspirations of the Italian Government at Assab as being purely com mercial and scientific ; it expresses confidence that England will not regard this modest enterprise with an unfavourable eye, and concludes by begging me, in case erroneous preoccupations, founded on incorrect reports, should exist in London, to34 dissipate them by repeating to Her Majesty’s ■Government the reiterated assurances already given me that Assah Bay will never become a Govern ment establishment having a military character, that there will never be a garrison of troops, nor any fortifications, either on the mainland or on the islands; and I am requested to make these affirma tions in the most categorical and peremptory manner. “Your Lordship will observe that M. Cairoli’s note, contrary to usual custom, is written in French instead of in Italian, and although written on paper bearing the official stamp of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, it has the word ‘ Particuli&amp;re ’ in the corner. I have, however, been careful to give it an official character by replying to it in the usual official form, in the Note of which I have the honour to inclose a copy. The reply referred to in the last paragraph was dated the 21st April, and quoted the precise words of Signor Cairoli’s declarations on the material points of the case. So the matter stands at present. In submitting this Memorandum, which has been prepared in order that the Secretary of State may have before him in a convenient and connected shape papers which in their original state are not easy to follow, it is only necessary to observe that the “ Assab Bay question must not be confounded with that of the “ Somali Coast,” which in the last ten years has also been productive of an enormous amount of correspondence.* The Egyptian title to sovereignty over the African coast inside the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, which includes Assab, rests upon grounds entirely different from those upon which it is claimed over the Somali coast outside the Straits, including Tajourrah, Zeyla, Berbera, and the littoral as far as Has Hafun, south of Cape Guardafui. The Khedive’s sovereignty over the latter has been conditionally recognized by a Convention between Her Majesty’s Government and that of the Khedive, signed at Alexandria on the 7th September 1877’ but the formalities at Constantinople necessary to bring it definitively into operation have not yet been concluded.
