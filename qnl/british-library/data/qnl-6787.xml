Letteu from Lieutenant-Colonel W. G. Grey, Indian Army, Political Agent, Kuwait, to the Secretary, Political Department, India Office. Political Agency, Kuwait, Dear Sir Arthur Hirtzel, 16th June 1915. The enclosed is perhaps important, or interesting enough to send to you direct in view of the time which correspondence takes to reach the India Office, particularly now that the mail journey from India is extended by a week. The position has materially improved during the past few days ; the waverers among Arabs are more soundly converted to us by our success than by any other form of persuasion. Yours very truly, W. G. Grey. From Lieutenant-Colonel W. G. Grey, Indian Army, Political Agent, Kuwait, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, No. C/8 of 1915, dated Political Agency, Kuwait, 9th June 1915. Sir, According to the Times, Lord Curzon of Kedleston is reported to have remarked as follows on the occasion of an address by Mr. P. Landon on Basrah and the Shatt-ul-Arab, at the Society of Arts, on 15th April last:— ' Hitherto we had had most friendly relations with the Arabs. It was rather a puzzle to him why at those earlier stages of the fighting the Arabs appeared to have sided with the Turks, and it certainly should be the object of our diplomacy to detach them from the side of the Turks and to resume those pleasant relations with them which had characterized our policy during the last 50 years.' And again in the House of Lords on 2uth April :— ' And they (the Turks) appeared to have succeeded in pressing into their service the greater part of the Arab tribes in the lower part of Mesopotamia. This was a matter of extreme importance, for we had always maintained, and he thought were still maintaining, friendly relations with the tribes in that part of the world.' The Right Honourable the Secretary of State for India is reported to have replied on the latter occasion that:— ' A considerable number of Arabs had joined the Turks in the attacks. At the battle of Shaiba, where there were certainly not less than 10,000 Turkish troops engaged, x^robably approaching the same number of Arabs took part in the operations. It had been perhaps too hastily assumed at first that all Arabs, when Turkey joined the Germans, would take part in breaking the Turkish yoke. Of some Arabs, particularly many of the desert tribes, this was no doubt true. How far it applied to the more sedentary Arabs who, he took it, supplied the Arab forces now operating, it was not so easy to say. It was reasonable to suppose that probably a considerable number had proved willing to join Turkey now because they had had itdinned into their ears that Islam was being attacked. Some of them might even believe the amazing stories that were told about the conversion to Islam of eminent Germans, including the Emperor himself.' 1 have the honour to submit a few notes of information which I have collected regarding the extent to which the Arabs have co-operated with the Turks in the Shatt-ul-Arab country; the considerations which have led them to co-operate, and the results to themselves and to the Turks of such co-operation; with some remarks upon the position of those Arab tribes which have held aloof or tacitly sided with His Majesty's Government. 2. The Arab forces which took part in the re.cent operations in the neighbourhood of Shaiba were composed mainly of 4,000 members of various communities from Iraq and 6,000 of the Muntafik tribes from the country lying on the banks of the Euphrates and the Shatt-ul-Gharaf between Khamisiah on the south and Kut-ul-Amarah on the north. The only other Arabs who appear to have helped the Turks on this occasion are a few* hundred men of the Bani Hakam and the Bani Hasan who inhabit the swampy region adjoining Sukh-us-Shiyukh. • ). The Iraqis have had very little connection with us, and dwell too far away ever to have come under the influence of our Persian Gulf officials. The Resident at Baghdad has in all probability had little opportunity of cultivating their friendship or of making his influence felt amongst them, and no astonishment need be expressed at their having joined the Turks, which was natural. Of the Muntafik much the same may be said. Their country nowhere touches upon Persian Gulf administrative limits, and 1 learn th^ no decided efforts have ever been made by His Majesty's Consuls at Basrah to establish friendly relations with them; in fact, they probably did not consider such a proceeding to be part of their duty, as it would have been regarded by the lurks with grave suspicion' if not with resentment. It may also be remembered that the Muntafik land lies in the direct route oi Lurkish troops advancing on Basrah from Baghdad and in districts which have for centuries been governed or misgoverned by Ottoman officials. It would have been strange indeed had they elected to oppose the Turkish forces with, so far as they could see, everything to lose and nothing to gain thereby. I he small tribes west of Basrah mentioned above, who know little of the British, were bribed or forced to give what help they could like the Basravis, numbers of whom had been compelled some months earlier to join in opposing our first advance, on pain of destruction of their lives and property and those of their relatives. 4. 1 he conduct of the Iraqis seems to have been correct from the Turkish point of view, except that they occasionally displayed a lack of discipline and perhaps courage. But in the course of the engagements of April 12-15, the Muntafik showed clearly that their hearts were not in the stiuggle fiom any national or religious enthusiasm, but that while motives of self presei vation had led the chiefs to take up arms, the common people were out for plunder from whomsoever it. might be taken. On 13th April u se same Muntafik plundered the lurkish encampment during their retreat ein &amp; k pulsed by our troops, the ostensible reason, according tom 'n 'M eye-wUuesses, being that the Turks had p,omi«d them victory, whereas a severe rebuft was all they received. o. In the circumstances detailed above, little need be said upon the subject of the Turkish efforts to arouse religious feeling among the Arab s of these regions. Such an aspect of the war has entered but little into the considerations of the Muntafik, and the Basravis seem to be quite unaffected by it. The attempt to raise a Jehad has had no effect upon the large and important tribes of Central and North-Central Arabia, and I have not met any Arab who has taken seriously the supposed conversion of prominent Germans to Islam. 0. In connection with the tribes and localities referred to in this com munication, a reference is invited to the Gazetteer Map of Arabia which was compiled in the Foreign Office, Simla, during the years 1905-08 ; and I now pass on to some mention of the tribes further south, who have had more or less acquaintance with British officials, and have come more under the influence of our friends among the Arab chiefs and notables. First come the Zaffir, a large and scattered tribe who inhabit the country west and north-west of Kuwait, as far as Samawah. The Zaffir, who could probably put 5 ,000 fighting men into the field, have throughout declined all Turkish invitations to take up arms on their behalf, giving as their reason a feud which exists between them and the Muntafik, but they have also been advised by some of our friends to stand aloof. The Yuarin, who dwell nearer to the coast in about the same latitude, and whose strength is perhaps from 2,000 to 3,000 fighting men, have also remained neutral, partly owing to enmity with the Muntafik and partly to the influence of Shaikh Mubarak of Kuwait, who has also induced the Bani Malik, a roving tribe who come from the left bank of the Shatt-ul-Arab to pass the spring and winter in Kuwait territory, to take a similar course. 7. For the neutrality of the Shammar, the numerous inhabitants of the eastern portion of the desert tract known as the Nafnd which lies to the south-west of Kuwait, and the powerful Umm Tairwho dwell in the Suniman tract south-east of the Nafud, we are indebted partly to the influence of Shaikh Mubarak and partly to the skilful diplomacy of Bin Saud, the Amir of Nejd, who by organising a campaign against Ibn Rashid, the Shammar chief and enlisting in his service the warriors of the Umm Tair, not only provided himself with an excellent excuse for declining to assist the Turks who were pouring invitations upon him, but compelled Ibn Rashid and the Shammar to attend to their own defence. There never was any doubt as to what line Bin Saud himself would take, but he might not have found it possible to induce his people to take up our cause at an early stage of the war, or to restrain them from assisting at our discomfiture had we suffered a severe reverse at the hands of the Turks at a similar period. 8. It is impossible to speak too highly of the conduct of His Excellency Shaikh Sir Mubarak of Kuwait, which has from the moment in which I informed him that war with Turkey was imminent been that of a loyal and honourable gentleman. He said on that occasion that all that he had was at our disposal and that he would be victorious with us or perish with us, and everything that he has said or done since has borne out the sincerity of his4 professions of friendship. He 1ms written to every Shaittot throughout the country, urging him to mam ^ m I' 6 ' 5 f ,; ff ts conE,fence in His Majesty's Gover.nnent, and the tn 1 on our behalf will probably never be known. I conclude th.s the following extract from a letter sent by a Mr. Chandavar 'at, to the Times of India, which speaks for itself : 'Arab merchants, followers of the Shaikh of Kuwait, on the Arab.an coast, who come here for the purpose of trade, are becoming e p a in enlightening the Mahomedans on the correct situation about the war and tJae folly of Turkey in allowing herself to be made a catspaw of merman ambition.' 9. A copy of this letter is being sent to Basrah. I have, &amp;c;, W. G. Grey , Lieutenant-Colonel, Political Agent, Kuwait. )</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000253_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/B225</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000253</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/B225</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Letter from Lieutenant-Colonel William George Grey, Indian Army, Political Agent, Kuwait to Sir Arthur Hirtzel, Secretary, Political Department, India Office</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1915/1915</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-10-10T12:17:01</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>2 folios</extent><extent>Foliation: The foliation for this description commences at folio 26 and terminates at folio 26, as it is part of a larger physical volume; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.

The remarks are regarding Arab tribes supporting the Turks, and further observations made by the Secretary of State for India on the Battle of Shaiba, at which it was reported that the Turkish troops had been joined by almost 10,000 Arab combatants. The letter also raises the question of why they were now siding with the Turks given their previous relations with Britain.Grey's response to these observations includes a detailed explanation of the composition of the tribes involved as being primarily from Arab communities in Iraq, and the Muntafiq [al-Muntafiq] tribe of the Euphrates and Shatt-ul-Gharaf [Shaṭṭ al-Gharrāf, also known as Shaṭṭ al-Ḥayy] regions. His response also notes that the tribes involved are not those of the Persian Gulf region as had previously been assumed by Lord Curzon.The letter goes on to explain these tribes' relations with the Turks and the reasons for their having sided with them. The letter concludes by providing information on some of the tribes of the Persian Gulf, in particular the Zaffir [al-Zafīr] who had declined Turkish invitations to take up arms; and the Yuarin, Bani Malik [Banī Mālik] and Shammar all of whom had chosen to remain neutral.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India, United Kingdom</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston George Nathaniel Curzon</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Mesopotamia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Turkey</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Basra</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Shatt al ʻArab</geographic></subject><subject><topic>First World War (1914-1918)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Mesopotamian Campaign (1914-1918)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Tribes</topic></subject><subject><topic>Battle of Shaiba (1915)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000253#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
