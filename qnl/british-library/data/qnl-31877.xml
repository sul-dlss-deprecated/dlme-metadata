It is, however, for the Government of India and not for any United Kingdom authority to 'declasrify' them. We think that there is no harm in the Political Agent giving copies of these maps to the Muscat authorities for their own use only but we think that we should not connive at any reproduction of them, which night result in copies being generally available in the area, without observing the formality of asking the permission of the Governmtnt of India • If you agree, perhaps you would inform the Political Agent accordin ly. - e should be glad to make the necessary approach to the Government of India if the Political Resident so desires but he may prefer t &gt; do this direct• I am returning the maps herewith.

It will he seen that they are hoth marked ’’for official use only”. In addition the other copy of the larger scale map hears a ’Secret* label. If the existence of these maps had heen known before and we had heen authorised to show them to Holloways, they would have heen spared much trouble in the preparation of their Muscat water scheme. 2. I should he grateful for early permission to declassify the maps and to give one copy of each to the Muscat Government with the suggestion that they should have other copies made - unless the Foreign Office are willing to have them copied. We could do with additional copies for our own purposes and the defence services would also find them useful. The Survey of India may have copies hut it would probably take them months i not years to produce them. Meanwhile I have authorised the Political Agent, Muscat, to show to the Muscat Government the copies which he has retained. 3. A large scale map of Bahrain which was prepared at the same time was long ago communicated to the Bahrain Government and numerous copies have since heen made of it. 4. Unless you retain the enclosures for making copies, would you kindly return them with your reply? 5. I am sending a copy of this letter to Chancery. Yours ever (Sgd.)? R. Hay. ( 7^ T.E. Rogers, Esq., Foreign Office London.1. P.O. letter E. 12335/1985/91 2 November, with end. Mr. Crook; Neither Record Dept, no*'I can find any records regarding the issue of these maps. 11.11 Miss Emery Please see paper 1 and enclosures. We have not been able to find any trace of records shoeing the circumstances under which the maps were produced, which is not really surprising, as they were prepared under the direction of the Surveyor-General for India. I suppose the correct procedure would be to refer them to the Government of India for ’fete agreement to declassification, but the circumstances do not appear to me to justify this course. The necessity that, at the time when they were prepared, the maps should be classified as ’’secret and for official use only” can only have depended on the personal opinion of the officer responsible, and was doubtless related to circumstances applicable at that time. There seems to me to be nothing at all secret in the maps in relation to present day circumstances and I suggest that we ourselves therefore take the responsibility for their use* as suggested by the Political Resident. 1. 14.11.49 &amp;</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000517.0x000395_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/1427</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000517.0x000395</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/1427</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Pol Ext 8579/49 'Declassification of maps of Muscat: request from Persian Gulf Residency, Bahrain'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1949/1949</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2018-08-17T22:17:43</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (6 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 8, these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This file contains correspondence relating to the declassification of maps detailing Muscat, created by the Government of India, which were requested by the Persian Gulf Residency in Bahrain .
