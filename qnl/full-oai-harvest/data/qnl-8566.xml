The correspondence is chiefly exchanged between: officials at the British Legation in Tehran, including HM Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary Horace James Seymour, Acting Counsellor Nevile Montagu Butler, and Second Secretary P N Loxley; the India Office; and the Foreign Office. The file includes: copies of correspondence sent to the Iranian Government on the problems encountered by British subjects in remitting money abroad from Iran; discussion amongst British Government representatives on what methods could be used to facilitate the remittance of money abroad; copies of petitions and letters written by representatives of the British-Indian community in Iran.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Emigrant remittances</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Iran, Pahlavi dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Legation, Tehran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Iran</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00003b#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00003b#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00003b#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00003b#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00003b#share">Copyright or data protection restrictions</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
