It will be seen that with a change oi personnel His Highness the Sultan seems disposed to change his attitude, which was no doubt due in a large measure to the tactless management of the question by Dr. Thoms and the Revd.

With reference to the correspondence ending with your office endorsement No. 1282, dated 22nd May 1910, regarding the American Mission dispensary at Matrah, I have the honour to inform you that Dr. A. K. Bennett, who was recently at Koweit, arrived in Maskat towards the end of last month, and has since taken up his residence at Matrah where he is practising medicine and carry ing on the dispensary. 2. I am informed that Doctor Bennett will probably only stay till the autumn, when he will be relieved by another Doctor coming from America— whether this will be Dr. Thoms returning from leave or another Doctor I do not know. 3. The mission are still on the look out for a house in Matrah for a hospital, and there is some talk of purchasing a house belonging to the estate of the late Mr. Mackirdy. The house is however right in the town, small and unsuitable in every way, so probably the Mission will not buy it. 4. The Mission is expanding its scope at Maskat, and two lady missionaries are to come out in the autumn, one of whom will in all probability be a lady doctor. 5. His Highness the Sultan made no opposition to Dr. Bennett going to Matrah, and I think his objections to the Mission working at Matrah are much less acute now that the Revd. Dr. Cantine, who has been well known to him for many years, has resumed charge of the Mission. G.c. a P., Simla.—No. C 3743 F. D.— 23 - 9 - 10 .— 44 -—H. C.

Sir:- WiUi referdncc to ^our aospatch No. iill of Septem ber 11th itust relative to the opening by the American •Arabian Mleelon* of u alopenaary at Mutra, near iuo- cut, I transmit to Your Excellency herewith copy of u letter from the Inala Office forwarding copy of a des patch from the Government of India showing the course of the negotiations which have lately taken place bet ween the Sultan and the recently appointed United States Consul with regard to this question. Your Excellency will perceive that the United States Government base their demand for the recognition of the dispensary on the ground that they have always held that missionaries are traders in the sense in which that word is employed in treaties, while the Sultan maintains his objections to the enterprise of Dr. His Excellency The Right Honourable Jaies Bryce, 0. ., &amp;c., &amp;c., Ac.(6075/10) Dr. Thoms at Mutra. An examination of the sources of information at the disposal of this Office ooes not show that His Majesty's Government have ever held missionaries to be tracers for treaty purposes and it does not appear to them that they properly belong to that category. The objections, of the nature of which Your Ex cellency is ulreuay aware, raised by the Sultan to Dr. Thoms' undertaking appear moreover to be reasonable and just from His Highness* point of view and it is desirable on general grounds that His Majesty's Govern ment should uphold the authority of His Highness by supporting him in the attitude which he has adopted. At the sale time, the fact that Hie ftajesty's Gov ernment have no grounds for official intervention in the matter make the question of taking steps on Hie HiF;hneli£ , bahulf a delicutd one. In view of all the factu I am of opinion that an affoi’t Bhoulu be made to effect a friendly coffpromloe ♦ between the Sultan and the United States Government on the(6075/10) © t-he linae lulo down in the penultl;nute paragraph of the India Office letter but au the negotiations with regard to this question have hitherto been carried on by Your Excellency ana the Secretary of State of the United States it seems preferable that the BurgeeLea verbal explanation should be .made by you to him rather than, as proposed, by mo to the United States Ambuesa- dor in London. I have accordingly to request Your Excellency to make to Mr. Knox a verbal coatnunication in the sense proposed by the India Office ana to explain to him that His Majesty's Government are in the fullest sympathy with American Missionary enterprise at Muscat but that feeling that Dr. Thome in opening a dispensary at Mutra in opposition to the Sultan's wishes is hindering rather than advancing that work, they have thought it right to approach the Uniteo States Government -ith re gard to the question I am, with great truth and respect. Sir, Your Excellency's most obeoient. humble Servant,My Lord, With reference to the correspondence ending with Your Lordship’s telegram, dated the 22nd September 1909, we have the honour to forward a copy of the letters cited in the accompanying list regarding the opening by I)r. Thoms of a dispensary at Mutra. 2. It will be seen that Mr. Ray, the American Consul at Maskat, claims that an American missionary doctor is on the same footing as any other doctor, and that the American Government have invariably held that missionaries are traders within the sense of the word as employed in treaties. His Highness the Sultan has expressed his willingness to accept any doctor accredited by the United States Government, hut Mr. Ray declines to allow any distinction in the classification of doctors, and contends that if His Highness is willing to accept one doctor, by implication, doctors in general must be acceptable to him. On these grounds the Consul maintains his request that the Sultan’s objections to the establishment of an American hospital in Mutra should be withdrawn. 3. Should His Majesty’s Government he of opinion that the contentions of the American Consul are in conformity with international custom, further intervention in our interests and in those of the Sultan will doubtless be diffi- j cult. But should it be found possible to support the Sultan, and if His Majesty’s Government are of opinion that their influence could be usefully exercised with the United States Government, we would invite attention to the suggestion contained in paragraph 6 of Mr. Holland’s letter of the 23rd2 November last, that a favourable opportunity for the withdrawal of the American Missionary Doctor will be afforded when Dr. Thoms proceeds on leave in March next.

No. 1257, dated Maskat, the 23rd November 1909. From—R. E. Holland, Esq., Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty's ConsuL Maskaf, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to refer to your telegram No. 953, dated the 27th September 1909, on the subject of the American Mission Dispensary at Mutra. 2. The American Consul, Mr. J. A. Ray, arrived in Maskat on September 27th and was received by His Highness the Sultan with his usual courtsey and kindliness. Mr. Ray has had several interviews with His Highness since his arrival, but he has not, on any occasion, introduced the subject of the American Mission. A few days ago, however, he opened negotiations by forwarding to the Sultan a formal letter in which he requested His Highness to withdraw his objections to the establishment of an American Hospital in Mutra. I enclose a copy of this letter which has been furnished to me by His Highness the Sultan and also a copy of the reply which His Highness has to-day despatched to Mr. Ray. 3. His Highness showed me the draft of his reply before sending it off* but I did not think it necessary or advisable to suggest any change in its form- Saiyid Paisal is still very unwilling to sanction the establishment of the dispensary and his present intention is to persist in his refusal unless he is forced to give way. As stated in my previous letter, His Highness s objec tions are partly religious and partly administrative. He fears that the doctor s successes will result in the conversion of patients, and that the missionaries will then attempt to intervene in administrative matters on behalf of their protdges. He thinks it possible that local disturbances may arise from the missionaries interference with their patients’ religion and he fears that, if he gives his sanction to the enterprise, he will render himself responsible to the American Government, in a greater degree than at present, for the protection of the missionaries from the consequences of their actions. 4s. I did not advise His Highness to agree to the American Consul’s request, because Mr. Ray’s letter did not seem to me to afford an opportunity for a reasonable settlement at the present stage. On the other hand, I carefully refrained on this, as on all previous occasions, from saying anything which might influence His Highness in the opposite direction. The Sultan again asked that the British Government would help him in the matter, and I informed him in reply that I would report the matter to the Resident, but that I could give him no assurance that the British Government would find it possible to support him. 5. In his letter Mr. Ray claims, in the first place, that under the terms of the United States Treaty with Maskat, American citizens have a right to practise medicine in the Sultan’s ports. This claim is, doubtless, valid, especi ally having regard to the fact that British doctors practise regularly in Mas at. In the second place, Mr. Ray claims that an American missionary doctor is on the same footing as any other doctor, and he states that the United States Government have invariably held that missionaries are traders within the sense2 of the word as employed in treaties. Herein lies the real issue and it will doubtless be considered with reference to precedents which are not at my dis posal. To the layman it seems at least questionable whether a missionary, whose actions are not ordinarily governed by commercial considerations, can be ^ regarded as a trader, and possibly other countries than America have not held that missionaries are traders within the sense of the word as employed in treaties. If missionaries are not traders the American claim on the ground of “ equal opportunity” is untenable in this case, since no other missionary doctor is prac tising or, so far as I am aware, ever has practised in the Sultan s territories. 6 . If His Majesty’s Government find it possible to support the Sultan in this matter and are able to influence the United States Government in the direction required, a favourable opportunity Ifor the withdrawal of the doctor would be afforded in March next, when Hr. Thoms proposes to go on leave to America. If the American Government are unwilling to procure the recall of the doctor, but at the same time wish to avoid unpleasantness with the Sultan, perhaps the matter might be settled by simply leaving things as they are. Dr. Thoms is in possession and can continue his work, whether the Sultan countenances him or not. If circumstances should arise in which he needs the protection of his Government he will doubtless get it, and the formal recognition of his enterprise by the Sultan would hardly strengthen his hands. 7. But possibly the United States Government might consider such a solution undignified, in view of the fact that Mr. Bay has already made uncom promising demands by letter in the name of his Government. I think, personally, that the chance of a reasonable settlement would have been increased if Mr. Bay had discussed the situation personally with His Highness before writing a letter and he would have found the Sultan quite ready to listen to him. I should have suggested this if Mr. Bay had spoken to me about the matter, but as he did not do so I could not, of course, interfere. 8 . I may add that Mr. Bay’s relations with the British community are most cordial, and that he is a pleasant addition to our society. 9 . A copy of this letter has been forwarded direct to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Calcutta, in accordance with your general instructions. Dated Maskat, Oman, the 15th November 1909. From — J. A. Ray, Esq., American Consul, To—His Majesty Seyyid Faisul bin Turki, Sultan of Oman. Jfter compliments .—In the course of Your Majesty’s correspondence with Mr. Muhammad Faizel, American Vice and Depuy Consul, relative to the American hospital established at Mutra by Dr. S. J. Thoms, an American citizen, Your Majesty expressed the desire that the matter might be laid before the American Government at Washington. This was done, and I now have the honour to communicate to Your Majesty the reply of the American Government. The Hon’ble Secretary of State of the United States of America has instructed me to inform Your Majesty that the American Government maintains that the right of American citizens to practise medicine in Your Majesty’s dominions is guaranteed by the treaty between Your Majesty’s Government and the United States of America. The portions of the treaty bearing directly on the question are Articles IV and VI, which read as follows:— “ Article IV.—The American citizen shall pay no other duties on export or import, tonnage, license to trade or other charge whatsoever, than the nation the most-favoured shall pay.” “ Article VI. — The citizens of the United States resorting to the ports of the Sultan for the purpose of trade shall have leave to land and reside in the said ports without paying any tax or imposition whatever for such liberty other than the general duties on imports which the most-favoured-nation shall pay.”3 By all rules for the interpretation of treaties the practice of medicine is included in the word “ trade ” as used in these two articles which grant to American citizens the treatment accorded to the most-favoured nation. The only point to determine is whether, as a matter of fact, citizens of any other country are now, or have been in the past since the signing of the treaty, allowed to practise medicine in Your Majesty’s Kingdom. That such is the case admits of no doubt. For example, Dr. Norman Scott, a British subject, now resides in Maskat, where he practises medicine and is in charge of a hospital where the subjects of Your Majesty receive treatment. Dr. Scott has even treated patients in Mutra. The British hospital now in course of erection in Maskat has received the hearty approval and support of Your Majesty. Some years ago, Dr. A. S. G. Jayakar, a British subject, retired to Mutra, where he continued to practise medicine until he moved to India, without any objection on the part of Your Majesty so far as I am able to learn. Other examples might be adduced, if necessary. The circumstance that Dr. Thoms is in the employ of an American Missionary Society alters in no wise the aspect of the case. The American Government has invariably held that missionaries are traders within the sense of the word as employed in treaties. Missionaries are entitled to the s ame protection as any other citizens of the United States of America. In the previous correspondence, Your Majesty emphasized the point that you considered a doctor unnecessary in Mutra. The wisdom of Dr. Thoms* course in establishing a dispensary and hospital in Mutra is not a matter which this Government is at present disposed to discuss, as it is not a question of international law. Under these circumstances, I am instructed to urge Your Majesty to withdraw his objections to the establishment and operation of an Am erican hospital in Mutra. Translated purport of a letter from His Highness the Sultan of Maskat, to the American Consul, Maskat, dated the 22nd November 1909. After compliments .—Eeceived your letter dated the 15th November and understood all that was written in it regarding Dr. S. J. Thoms, the American. The doctor of the British Government is appointed officially by his Adminis tration for the work of a doctor while the American doctor works on behalf of a community of mission and as such interferes with the creed of others. Previous to this I do not remember of any doctor like this, and I am afraid that ■ he will do something which will come in the way of my friendship with the \ American Government. I would agree if the American Government would accredit him officially for the work of a doctor and would undertake the | responsibility that he will not interfere in matters of which we are afraid that it may cause unpleasantness among us. In such a case I may perhaps agree. We have done a lot for the American subjects here and have helped their merchants and our friendship with the American Government has continued. Whatever it was necessary to write I have written. 8. O. P. L—2X09 P. D.—11-12-09- 41 lannwmr^2^ ■ No. 1286, dated Maskat, the 30th November (received 8th December) 1909. From— R. E.

After compliments .—Your Majesty’s note, dated the 8th of Dzul Coda 1327 A.H. has been received and its contents carefully noted. I observe that Your Majesty states that a doctor officially appointed by the American Gov- authorising any one to distinguish among American doctors, and any division of them into acceptable and unacceptable classes is purely arbitrary. The posses sion of a certain right by one doctor implies the possession of the same right by all doctors, unless the law gives authority to discriminate. As Your Majesty declares that one kind of American doctor is acceptable, I assume that The point at issue then is not the right of American doctors to reside and practise in Oman, but the possible disturbance of the public peace arising from a missionary’s meddling in religious matters. I feel justified in assuring Your Majesty that the United States will not encourage their citizens in meddling, as they will not fail to support them in legitimate activities. I have never heard of our missionaries meddling. Should such a case occur it should be reported to the Consul who would be obliged to give the matter his most careful attention.

Mr. Holland has discussed the question in detail, and it is unnecessary for me to say much. I agree with Mr. Holland that the whole question turns on whether a missionary can lie considered a ‘ trader 5 within the meaning of the word as employed in Treaties. On the legal aspect of this I am not com petent to express an opinion, but from a practical point of view I beg to say that, although the American missionaries at Bahrein and certain English missionaries regard themselves as traders, this Residency has never been able to regard them as such. It is of course impossible to convince the Sheikh of Bahrein (or Koweit) that a missionary whose principal aim in life is religion is on the same footing as a man who sells broadcloth for profit. 3. In view of the present attitude of the American Arabian Mission, it is • F’ide sub-enclosure 2 to Foreign Department interesting to read the viCTt S of the Board endorsement No. 323-E.A., dated 2nd February of the Mission as expressed in their letter * 1909- of 16th November 1899, which inciden tally admits that the result of the advent of missionaries in a Muhammadan country is very different from that produced by the residence of simple traders.

Ray), an American, has been appointed consul, and is being sent to Muscat for purpose of settling question connected with the hospital. Recommendation has been received from Resident in Persian Gulf that Sultan should be informed, with as little delay as possible, whether he will receive the support of His Majesty’s Government in the attitude he has taken up. “ May such an assurance be given to His Highness ? ” (For reference, see my despatch No. 176 of the 6th July.) You should request the United States Government to let us know their views with as little delay as possible, as we must know their opinion before answering the above. I (ycL' rtj . u-o.

I*lk' OlI jiA^uAsrOL r. 12 j[This Document Is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government,] I TRANSMIT to your Excellency herewith copies of two letters from the India Office relative to the opening of a dispensary by American missionaries at Mutra against the wishes and in spite of the express prohibition of the Sultan of Muscat, in whose territory that place is situated.* . His Majesty’s Government have long exercised a preponderant influence in the affairs of Muscat, the nature of which is well shown in the accompanying paper (which I enclose for your confidential information), viz., a statement of case for opinion sub- (oy mitted on the 8th March, 1899, by the Secretary of State for India to the Law Officers of the Grown,! who, as your Excellency will perceive from their reply, held that the exercise of this influence was justified. . This influence does not, however, amount to the direct control of the foreign relations of Muscat, which, as regards the United States, are regulated by the treaty of the 21st September, 1833, between the two countries. A copy of this instrument is enclosed for your Excellency’s information,! and you will observe that it does not ap pear to confer on American citizens in Muscat the right to take such action as foims the subject of the Sultan’s present complaint. The Sultan objects to the establishment of the dispensary on five separate and specific grounds of an administrative nature, these grounds, in the opinion of His Majesty’s Government, as m that of the Government of India, are icasonable and valid , moreover, His Ma]esty’s Government feel themselves bound, for more general reasons, to support the Sultan’s authority in his own dominions and to second his action in so far as they can properly do so. ~ Your Excellency should therefore bring to the notice of the United States Govern ment, unofficially, the facts set forth in the enclosed correspondence, and should inform them that the Sultan of Muscat has asked His Majesty’s Government to use their friendly offices with a view to the suppression of the dispensary and to the recall by the Arabian mission of Dr. el. Thoms, who is responsible for the action of which the Sultan complains. , , , . . . In making this communication, your Excellency should lay particular stress on the fact brought out in Major Cox’s telegram No. 346 of the 14th April last to the Govern ment of India, that the Sultan, with the assistance of His Majesty s Government, is already taking steps to establish an efficient hospital at Muscat, so that the existence ot a dispensary at Mutra, which is conterminous with Muscat, cannot be shown to be necessary on medical grounds. , , .

Your letter dated 3rd April reached me. I became informed of its contents. As regards the Doctor you should remember that I can certainly not permit him to open a hospital in Mutrah. I have already informed you to this effect, but you seem to have paid no heed to it. You should refer this matter to your Government in America, and if your Government sends any reply, I shall reply to that. I am not at all prepared to accept your request for opening a charitable dispensary at Mutrah, and the Missionaries have no right to insist in the matter.

My Lord, We have the honour to enclose, for Your Lordship’s information, copies as noted in the accompanying list of correspondence which has been addressed to us in regard to the opening by American Missionaries at Mutra near Maskat of a dispensary against the wishes and express prohibition ot His Highness the Sultan of Maskat. 2 . We need not emphasise the desirability on general grounds of support ing the Sultan of Maskat. We regard the action of Dr. J. Thoms, of the American Mission, and Mr. Muhammad Fazel, the American Vice-Consul, as arbitrary and antagonistic to our interests no less than to those ot the bultan. And we trust that His Majesty’s Government will represent the matter in the proper quarter with a view to the recall of the doctor by the Arabian Mission.

I have the honour to forward herewith for information copy of letter No. 342, dated the 3rd April 1909 and its enclosures, which I have addressed to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Rushire. I forward a copy direct in view of the fact that the matter may possibly become urgent and the Resident may desire to express his views to the Government of India by telegraph. No. 342, dated Muskat, the 3rd April 1909. From— R. E. Holland, Esq., Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Muskat, To— The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to forward herewith copies of the marginally noted letters (1) Prom the American Vice and Deputy Consul, ^Siding Sbll attempt by the American Muakat to His Highness the Sultan of Muscat. JVllSSlOn in MuSCat tO Commence medical Mutrah contrary to the wishes or His Highness the Sultan. 2. The Sultan informed me that the missionaries made arrangements for taking a house in Mutrah and for opening a hospital there without obtaining his sanction. On learning of their intention early in March, he informed them that he could not sanction the proposed enterprise and requested them to con fine their energies to Muscat. He asked my opinion as to his legal rights in the matter and after consulting you by telegram, I informed His Highness that if he had reasonable administrative grounds for his objection they would probably be upheld. 3. The Sultan has now sent me copies of a letter which he has received from the American Vice and Deputy Consul on the subject and of his reply about the terms of which he consulted me before despatching it. His Highness has requested that such assistance as is possible may be given by us, in order to prevent the missionaries from carrying out their intentions. His Highness is strongly opposed to the project and I gather that his reasons are as follows :— (1) His sanction was not asked. (2) He has just raised a public subscription for the construction of a Muscat and Mutrah Hospital, and fears that missionary medical work may prejudiee the success of his enterprise. (3) He fears that the mission might gain undue influence among his subjects by medical work and endeavour to convert them from their religion. (4) He fears that the missionaries might commence to interfere in administrative matters, as he has heard they have done in other countries. (5) He fears that if the missionaries were allowed to do medical work in Mutrah, it w r ould be difficult to refuse them permission to go inland for the same purpose, if they went inland trouble might ensue and demands would then be made upon him for com pensation. 4. The Sultan’s position, which is based on administrative grounds, appears to me to be a reasonable one and I venture to recommend that, if the American Mission appeal to the United States Government, as they probably will, in order to enforce their claim, such diplomatic assistance as is possible may be rendered to His Highness in the matter by His Majesty’s Government.2 Article VI of the Muscat Treaty with the United States, quoted hy the Vice-Consul, does not appear to apply to the case of missionaries, and although missionaries have of course a right to protection from their Government, it seems only reasonable that a Mahometan ruler should decide under what con ditions and within what limits Christian missionaries should be permitted to live and work in his country. No other mission is now doing medical work in Muscat. 5 . The Sultan has also informed me that when he told the Reverend Mr. Barny of his objections to the enterprise, the latter was rude to him, saying that if he had asked for permission to open a liquor shop, His Highness would doubtless have granted it. Finally, in spite of His Highness’ intimation of his wushes and in complete disregard of them the missionaries have just concluded a lease of a house in Mutrah and have made preparations for commencing medical work. Action of this sort is greatly to be deprecated as tending to weaken His Highness’ authority over his subjects. I have personally reasoned with Doctor Thoms and endeavoured to persuade him to achieve his end, if it can be achiev ed, by more tactful means but in vain. He is determined to insist upon what he considers to be the unflouted rights of an American missionary, and to pursue his object in the face,of all opposition. 6 . In view of the fact that you may desire to express your views on this subject to the Government of India by telegram, I am forwarding a copy of the correspondence to Simla. P S —At the time of posting, the American Yice-Consurs reply to His Highness has arrived and is included.

Jf/er compliments .—I have the honour to quote traatv concluded on Sep tember 2lst, 1S33. Article VI states that the citizens of the United States resorting to the ports of the Sultan for the purpose of trade shall have leave to land and reside in the said ports without, paying any tax or imposition whatever for such liberty other than the general duties on imports which the most favoured nation shall pay. From international law digest, Protection - of missionaries. Missionaries sent out by religious communions in the United States to Mahomedan or pagan lands are entitled to all the protection which the law of nations allow this Government to extend to citizens to reside in foreign countries in the pursuit of their lawful avocation. I have quoted these in reference to Doctor J. Thoms of the Arabian Mis-' sion w r ho intends opening a dispensary in Mutrah. He has rented a house there and I request Your Highness to extend the same protection to him as mentioned above. Doctor Thoms is anxious to go to Mutrah as soon as pos sible as he thinks any delay will cause serious inconvenience to him. Dated Muscat, the inth R^i-o'-Awai ^ 327 ^ ’ 2nd April laOP From—His Highness Sir Suyiu Faisal bin Turki, G.C.I.E, Sultan of Museat acd Oman, To—The American Vice and Deputy Consul, Muscat. I have received your letter of March 23rd. I have understood it. There is a treaty always between us. We are friends at all times—most sincere friends—we are grappled with iron hoops of friendship. We have a mutual3 understanding about permitting others for trade and living here. I protect your subjects at all times with the greatest care. They are very comfortably and conveniently carrying on their business and for the clergymen who come to see the place we provide all comforts excepting the doctor who now wants to open a hospital here. I cannot permit him. I have already arranged for a physician at Mutrah to work charitably and 1 do not think any more is required there. Dated Mapcafc-Oman, April 3rd, 1909.

After compliments.—\. have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your Highness’ letter of yesterday’s date and to thank Your Highness for acknow ledging the rights and privileges of the American citizens. With reference to what Your Highness says about new doctor, I have the honour to say that I must strongly object to any disparaging discrimination being made against American doctors and their rights in Your Highness’ dominions. * ~ Telegram No. 3,44, dated (and received) the 14th April 1909. p r 0 m—M ajor P.

No. 135, dated March 9th:— Begins. With reference to your recent letter. It is my personal opinion that terms of commercial treaty between the two States cannot be considered applicable and that question turns to other problem of international law. I doubt if Sultan could ultimately make arbitrary refusal not based on definite grounds. On the other hand if he has reasonable grounds for objection 1 believe that will be upheld. In any case work contemplated could not be carried out in practice in teeth of opposition from Sultan and (in) reported circumstances could not expect the countenance from us which it is sure to need from time to time.— Lnds.

Reference letter No. 342, dated April 3rd, from Muscat and my telegram Nos, 344 and 345. Sultan will, I trust, have all possible support. The aggressive tactics of missionaries are probably due to their knowing that an effective hospital schemeis being started by Sultan and ourselves and they are anxious to gain their medical footing first, Sultan can, to some extent, render their efforts nugatory by adopting a policy which is frequent in Persia or forcing his subjects not to patronise the mission hospital, but prevention is better than cure, and the first two grounds advanced by His Highness seem reasonable and capable of ^ diplomatic support. With reference to this question please see the last enclosure of the India Office Despatch No. l*Secret, dated January 5th, 1900, to the Government of India in connection with Bahrein Mission, in which an allusion is made to Muscat.
