As you know this place is mentioned in the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913 referred to in the Kuwait-Nejd Boundary Convention of 1922. I I see from War Office map No.3954 scale Is 500,000 that two Gurains ace shewn. Thr first is apparently a small hill and the second a group of wells. I should be grateful if you could let me know which of / these two Gurains is to be taken for the purpose of defining Kuwait’s Southern frontier. Yours sincerely,POLITICAL aGEMCY, KIT'A it.

After rexerenoe to the correspondence in this office as well as to (Jol.

The nr^lo-Turkish Convention of 1913 to which the Kuv/ait Hejd Boundary Convention of 1922 refers does not specifically define Gurain as a hill, but in any case it is merely quoted as a landmark for a frontier that is mathematically calculated i.c, a circle with its centre in Kuwait aiid its circumference at the confluence of the Idler Bubair and the IQior Shetana. This leaves th^arells of Lruial n seme way i n side the Y eutr^l Bone.

CONFIDENTIAL. gttS^ Reference your telegram No.689 dated the 2nd August, 1948 about Gurain. 2. I have discussed the matter with both His Highness the ShaiEh and Abdulla Kulla, as well as paying a visit to the site in question. 3. When I brought the subject up during an interview with His Highness, both he and Abdulla Mulla claimed that Gurain Wells as well as Gurain Hill were within the Kuwait boundary. However, His Highness made the topographical mistake of claiming that it did not make much difference which was treated as the boundary mark, as the Wells and the Hill were situated on an East - West line: and he also admitted that he was relying on the 'Map of the Kuwait Hinterland' compiled by Knox and Bhakespear, where he may have been misled by the fact that the boundary is marked by a thick coloured line which embraces some of the Neutral Zone’ as well. 4. On Monday the 16th August I drove down to Gurain accompanied by one of Shaikh Abdulla Mubarak*s guides, Saud Feshetan: I asked the guide, and also several Bedouin on the way, what they would understand by a simple reference to 'Gurain', and they all agreed Xjrafc they would mean the Hill. This seems to me natural, as the Hill is an obvious landmark, a clea®* pillar of rock in arptherwise featureless landscape. It was some time however, before the guide could find the Wells, which consisted of five or six, all silted up: and the situation was further complicated by the fact that the guide claimed that slightly larger wells, some 6 miles to the North East and which I presume are those marked on the General Staff Map No. 3954 War Office 1936 as GARUT, were also known as Gurain Wells. He said he had never heard the name Garut. &lt;_/ Political Agent, Kuwait MB.Telegram From To Repeated No.18. Dated 2nd, 'R* Prodrome, London. Prodrome, Bahrain No.183.

He makes the request on the grounds # that Ibn Baud's health is failing and that if the matter is not dealt with personally by him Kuwait's interests may suffer since he feels that certain elements of the Saudi Government are inclined to be unsympathetic towards Kuwait. This is possibly true but another reason for the request is undoubtedly the presence in Kuwait of the :Jtinco Vice-President Rayner. 2. . Jr. Morris has informed me that Aminco drilling would start within a mile of Train in extension of the Burgan feature. The failure to reach agreement in Saudi Arabia will presumably hold this up nevertheless the matter appears to be urgent and I should be grateful if the Shaikh's request could receive early action. -Galloway-Telegram From Cypher 1 i t i c a 1 , Kuwb i t To Prodrome, Bahrain No. C/46.

( 52/50/49 ) With the compliments of the Political Resident. Bri 'sh Residency, Bahrain, Persian Gulf, 19499 o Ini No* 81 276/5/49 SECRET srmr ei. i COPY. British Embassy, Jedda. 21st April, 1949, Sir, When Sir W.R, Hay passed through Jedda on tour a few days ago, he brought me a copy of his secret telegram to you of the 25th March last No.130, concerning the latest developments connected with oil exploitation in the Saudi-Kuweit Neutral Zone. I was also glad to have the opportunity of discussing that matter with him in its general aspects. I take this opportunity of mentioning that I am in complete agreement with the suggestion ^ ( made by him in paragraph 5 of his despatch to you No.173(59/47/48) of the 30th December 1948. The Saudi Arabian Government have not so far approached me in this matter but it seems to me most desirable that the exact situation of the frontier should be deter mined as far as possible, even though, for reasons unknown to me, one of the representatives of American Independent Oil Company named Morris is reported in the' telegram referred to above to oppose that plan. 2. My American colleague has already raised the question with me and at his request I showed to a member of his staff the text of the Kuwaiti Nejd Boundary Convention of 1922 and article 5 of the unratified Anglo Turkish Agreement of 1913: he already possessed Aitchison r s 'Treaties Engagements and Sanads' Vol. XI, and I therefore had only to direct him to pages 213 and 266 of that work. I explained that I possessed no copy of the map referred to in article 5 of the latter Agreement. The official concerned drew my attention to the words 'until through the good offices of the Government of Great Britain....' which occur in the 1922 Convention. I understand that the report which Mr. Childs sent to the State Department in this matter was factual, but I expect that in some way or other our good offices will be invoked fairly soon. The signing of the agreement, between the Saudi Arabian Government and the Pacific Western Cil Company concerning the Saudi undivided share of the Neutral Zone increases the urgency of this question and many others, some of which I propose to allude to in this despatch. 3. The administration of the Neutral Zone is perhaps the most important of these questions in practice. Mr. Childs tells me that he raised it with Fuad Hamza during his recent visit to Riyadh. Fuad had suggested to him that some kind of ex territorial regime should be established in the Zone. This suggestion brought to my mind the three agreements of April 1942 between this country and Kuweit: on reading them through I find that the clause which is most relevant to Fuad Hamzat suggestion is Article 8 of the Extradition Agreement. It has also been suggested that the Zone should be divided, by mutual arrangement, by an east-west line through the middle, so that Kuweit could administer the northern part and Saudi Arabia the southern . 4. A small point, which may perhaps give rise to a good deal of friction, is the very extraordinary wording of Article 37 of the Pacific Western concession: it says 'the Company shall fly the flag of Saudi Arabia within the Neutral Zone'. I have not yet received a copy of the American Independent Oil Company T s concession of the 28th June 1948 but even if it contains a similar /provision The Right Honourable C.R. Attlee, M.C., M.P., etc., etc., etc., FOREIGN OFFICE. Jprovision about that company^ flying the Kuweiti flag I fear that there may be some acrimonious argument about flags; and if there is no such article in the Kuweit concession I fear the argument may be even more acrimonious, I understand that Article 37 was put in by the Egyptian lawyer employed by the Saudi-Arabian Government, Ahmed Taufiq. 5* It may perhaps be of interest if I draw attention in this despatch to a philological point; the word 'qurain' seems to me to be the diminutive of the word 'qarn' one of the meanings of which is 'a horn'; can it therefore be possible that the mountain alluded to by one of the surveyors bears at its top a protuberance which resembles a little horn? It seems at any rate more likely that the word would apply to a mountain than to a well, 6, In conclusion I would mention that this post does not appear to possess a copy of the map annexed to article 5 of the 1913 agreement. Nor have we a copy of the 1936 War Office map, though we possess a War Office map (1/1,000,000) M.D,R. 1/388 p 104) dated at the War Office 1938, revised 1941, (Basra sheet (North H 38) which I presume will do equally well. I should be grateful if I might be supplied with a copy of the 1913 map if possible; and as I have not yet received the text of the Arainco agreement signed on the 28th June 1948 about the Kuweit oil interest in the Neuttal Zone, I should be grateful to be supplied with a copy of that also. 7. I am sending copies of this despatch to the British Middle East Office and to Sir Rupert Hay. % I have the honour to be, — with the highest respect, Sir. Your most obedient humble Servant, A.C. Trottt/u} 0 Telegram O.T.P. From Political , Kuwait To Prodrome, London Tel. No. 41. Repeated Bahrain Tel. No. 106 Jedda Tel. No. Kiso/183 Dated 12th May, 1949. SEC HET. Following for vVRIGHT from BURROWS. I had short talk at Bahrain about Saudi frontiers with United States Ambassador Jedda and Scott-Fox just before leaving to come here. Hay may be reporting separately. Following are my purely personal reflections:- This is not just a dispute between oil companies. Our whole position m the Gulf risks being seriously weakened by (a) Saudi encroachments (b) notable increase in slave trade in and through Sheikhdoms under our protection (c) general lawlessness and lack of security in interior of Oman. There are proposals for dealing with (b) and (c) which I will discuss on my return but they cannot possibly produce immediate results. Meanwhile/2 Meanwhile if as a result of unsuccessful frontier negotiations we had to cede areas which we and Sheikhs have always regarded as theirs this would be a serious blow to us coining on top of factors mentioned above. Saudis seem likely to adopt very tough attitude, whatever may be their motives, and United States Government will find it difficult to resist Saudi and ARA.MCO appeals to take their side. If we are to avoid serious frontier concessions we must therefore throw in all we have got as makeweight - i.e. supply of arms, continuation of military and civil air missions, a much more forthcoming attitude on the Saudi proposals for a treaty, and, best of all perhaps, some more positive reassurances about the Hashemites than we have hitherto been ready to give. 2. I expect we must now show willingness in / principle to negotiate on frontiers but it would be better not to get deeply involved in negotiation until we know how far we can go on points mentioned above provided that oil companies agree to ff moratorium’ f meanwhile. 3. Moreover if we could concert our attitude on the treaty closely with the Americans there might be less danger of their siding with Saudis on the frontiers. We are/&amp; We are unlikely to get much further with the Americans on the treaty at least until Mr. Childs goes to Washington in august. JACKSON53/53/49 The Persian Gulf He Bahrai n. 10th June, 1949, I forward herewith a copy of a letLer received from Jackson containing information of the activities of the Ametlcan Independent Oil Go., in the Neutral Zone. Galloway’s telegram to which reference is made was repeated to you and Jedda in ray telegram 130 of the 25th March. Sl^ 2. I have not yet received instructions on my des patch No. 173 of the 30th December, 1948, in which I made certain proposals about the delimitation of the frontier in the vicinity of Gurain, c.f. Jedda des patch 81 of the 21st April. Although the oil companies h, do'not appear to be pressing for this delimitation as my despatch shows the Sheikh is anxious that the matter should be decided at an early date and I would suggest that action should not be postponed on account of negotations over boundaries elsewhere. 3. I have asked Jackson for his views about the future administration of the Neutral Zone and v^hen I recieve them will forward them with my own. 4. I am sending copies of this letter to Scott-Fox and Jackson. 5! B.A.B. Burrows, iSsq. , ^ast era Dept., foreign Office, ~ondon. (++++++++++++++++++++) ^ceived under Residency Comp.

I presume pre occupation with other Saudi Arabian bound aries has made it difficult for you to find time to deal with this, but it has occurred to me that if the present negotiations at Jeddah end sooner than is expected or if they are held up at any time pending enquiries, or for any other reason, it might be useful if our representatives were to take the matter up. 2.
