BAHRAIN: MEMORANDUM ; -\ \ s.s.'Barpeta' v.225. i enclose herewith for jour inspection and re turn; j- (1) Bill of Entry No.1670 by The Eastern Bank Ltd., and (2) Invoice No. 189 'by Messrs C. Balkrishna &amp; Co of Ko'be, Japan. These documents cover one case of undervests, a sample 'box of which is enclosed herewith for your inspection. i IIIB 1. ^ ' : ill i It will be noticed that the cardboard box containing the undervests (which are manifestly of cheap quality) has a label printed on it which states that the goods are 'Made in England' It will also be noticed that each undervest is stamped 'Made in England'; however, the Country of Origin of the goods is Japan, not England. I am of opinion that these goods are Japanese, not English. It is the practice of British firms producing British goods to put a tab upon each article produced giving the name of the manufacturer, the Trade Mark of such article, which is generally registFPPd, and the origin of the goods. ^ I consider that the phrase 'Made in England' stamped upon these gooas is untrue, and therefore the action of the manufacturers m so stamping them is dishonest, and intended to mislead honest purchasers who may believe that goods stamped 'Made in England' are of the consistently high quality og British-made goods. Therefore I submit that the import of these articles into the State of Bahrain ought not to be permitted, and, further, since this is the second instance of this kind which has recently occurred, the goods should be confiscated and destroyed so that the concerned may suffer a loss tliereby.

A stronger deterrent to sach importations in future would, of course, be the confiscation of goods which are falsely marked, but the Department of Overseas Trade is not aware whether the Authorities have the necessary powers. 2. I am to add that the matter has been brought to the notice of the Board of Trade who have recently caused a large number of complaints regarding Japanese imitation of British goods to be brought to the notice of the Japanese Government. Pending the bringing into force of the Japanese Law for the Prevention of Unfair Trade Competition, however, the Board are not at present bringing any further cases to their notice.

Sir, With reference to despatch Bo 1497 of October 12th addressed to you by the Officiating Political Agent at Bahrain, a copy of which was sent to the Department of Overseas Trade under cover of Mr. Worth's despatch Ho. 1498.10/4 of the same date, regarding a consignment of cotton singlets alleged to have been imported from Japan, I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to inforai you that the vests marked 'Elephant Brand' have been examined in the Department of Overseas Trade. £. This name is not known in connection with cotton under wear and a United Kingdom manufacturer who has been directly approached is also ignorant of the marlc. 2. The vests are stamped with the words 'white cotton singlets'. This procedure of stamping the name of an article on the article itself is not customary in the United Kingdom trade. The term itself is not a common trade expression in the United Kingdom. The samples forwarded would be described as 'white cotton vests'. Moreover, the goods would not be invoiced as 'undershirts' but as above described. 4. Apart from this, all the evidence from the finish and general get-up of the samples seems to point to foreign and probably Japanese manufacturer Furthermore, it is thought highly improbable that the United Kingdom is exporting cotton vests to Japan, nor is there any reason why United Kingdom goods should reach the Persian Gulf via Japan. 5. In the light of the above considerations it is felt that there are sufficient grounds upon which the Customs Depart ment at Bahrain can challenge the importers to prove what has every appearance of being a false statement.
