The Marchese Imperiali will be grateful if Sir E. Grey will be so good as to inform him of the opinion of the British Government as to this draft protocol. London, May 25, 1911. Enclosure in No. 1. Draft Protocol between Italy, France, and England for the Suppression of the Contraband Trade in Arms in Ottoman Territorial Waters in the Red Sea and the Neighbouring Zone. (Translation.) IN order to facilitate the action of Turkey during the present exceptional period of insurrection in the vilayet of Yemen, Italy, France, and England have determined to exercise in the maritime zone in question a special and very active surveillance over their merchant-vessels with a view to preventing any attempt to carry on contraband trade in arms and ammunition on the part of vessels*under the protection of the flag of one of these Powers. TV ith this object and in agreement with the Ottoman Government, who the following verbal understandings are placed on expressly adhere and consent, record :— 1. Every question of principle relating to the right of visit either in the open sea or in Ottoman territorial waters remains in statu quo and unprejudiced. In the same way shall remain in statu quo and unprejudiced the existing situation, in law and in practice, as regards the treatment of dhows between Turkey and each of the other three Powers adhering to the present verbal understanding, they being those whose colonial possessions include stations on the Red Sea in commercial relations with the coast of Yemen. 2. No modification is introduced by the present agreement into the conventional law observed between France, England, and Italy with reference to the reciprocal treatment of their respective vessels in the Red Sea, except as far as concerns the zone which will be indicated below, under the conditions which are to be specified, and for the purposes towards which the present temporary and special agreement is directed. 3. 'Within the maritime zone which extends parallel to the coast of the Ottoman / provinces on the Red Sea and up to a distance of 20 miles from land, surveillance over j native vessels flying the Italian, French, or British flag shall be exercised without distinction by the war-ships of the above-mentioned Powers. 4. The commanding officers of the war-ships of the three aforesaid Powers shall limit their action to ensuring that the said native vessels are not carrying on contra band trade in arms and ammunition. With this object they will follow the procedure sanctioned by the existing international agreements. The enquiry respecting the fla 0 * shall be limited to the examination of the dhow’s papers. When the certificate of nationality is found to be in order, without removing the suspicions which have led to the native vessel being boarded, it shall be permissible to proceed to examine the cargo, the reasons which determined this step and the arguments adduced against it being shown in the proces-verbal of the visit. [2075 c—2] J Au i ■Jt\ A 5. It is not permissible to proceed to seize the native vessel except when material proof is found of contraband in arms and ammunition, guilt, even when well founded, only authorises the denunciation of the vessel to the authorities designated in the following articles. 1 , n v v _ lrl i. n 6. The native vessel which, from the results^ of the search, shall he held to engaged in the contraband in arms and ammunition shall be accompanied )y ^ war*ship which effected the seizure to the nearest port where there resides a consular officer of the nation to which the vessel in question belongs. , • i 7. The consular authorities to whom a vessel is handed over when seized shall proceed to the judicial investigations and subsequent acts m conformity with t e conventional law in force according as the capture has taken place on the open sea or in Ottoman territorial waters. In any case, the order for confiscation shall be exclusively within their competence. e x. i t? i i 8. The consular authorities and the recognised agents of Italy, England, and Prance in the bed Sea are authorised in the same way as the said commanding officers of war-ships to proceed to make enquiry as to the flag and, if necessary, to examine the cargo, either on their own initiative or at the request of commanding officers o Turkish war-ships or other Ottoman authority in the case of any ship at anchor without distinction flying the flag of one of the said Powers, without prejudice to the proceedings reserved in No. 7 for the competence of the consu ar authorities 9. Nothing is changed in the existing situation, in law and m practice, as regards the contraband trade in arms and ammunition which have been landed, with reference to the exercise of those rights which may be within the competence of die Ottoman Government by virtue of the international agreements in force. 10. The commanding officers of Ottoman war-ships who suspect that a native vessel flying the flag of one of the three above-mentioned Powers and navigating in Ottoman territorial waters is carrying on contraband trade in arms and ammunition mav escort the said vessel until they meet with a war-ship or as far^ as the port o ! residence of a consular agent of the said Powers. These authorities, having been requested to do so, will proceed to make investigations and enquiries into the case in conformity with the powers conferred on them by the present agreement. It the result should be negative, the Ottoman Government will he liable to demurrage at the rate of 5 Turkish lire a-day, reckoning from the date of the seizure of the vessel up to that at which it can have returned to the point at which it was obliged to deviate from its course. Such indemnity does not carry exemption from the obligation, which might arise in the case, to make good any damage suffered by the vessel seized. 11. Dhows which have put into a port where there is no Ottoman Customs official, except through force majeure, and are suspected of carrying on contraband trade in arms and ammunition, may he escorted by the war-ships of one of the four Powers to the port where there is a consular agent of the State to which the dhow belongs. 12. Any difference of opinion which may arise respecting the execution of tne present verbal understanding shall be decided, by agreement between the four Powers, through the diplomatic channel. 13. The present agreement shall have a duration of one year, hut shall be tacitly renewed from six months to six months unless it is denounced^ by one of the parties. It may, however, cease to have force sooner in any of the following circum stances :— (a.) When the situation in Yemen has become normal again. (b.) When the Ottoman civil and military authorities have given cause for complaints in connection with the object of the present understanding which are, in the judgment of the three Powers—Italy, Prance, and England—considered to he well founded. (c.) When two of the three Powers have expressly notified to each of the others their decision to withdraw from the present agreement. jliar a or y rsof iclior adice .solar sards \ of ^ i’ow®) tacitlj ase w 1 \ 3 oto rs 3^f (2f [This Document is the Property of His 1 Britannie Majesty’s Govesmnent.] AKMS TRAFFIC. 1 CONFIDENTIAL.

I have, however, the honour to point out that that article of the Brussels Act, as also the Anglo-Turkish convention of the 25th June, 18S0, to which your Highness appeals, are' applicable only to the slave trade, and do not confer upon the Ottoman authorities in the Red Sea a general right to arrest British vessels at their discretion.

I AM directed by Mr. Secretary Harcourt to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th April respecting the illicit import of arms into the Yemen, and to request jou to inform Secretary Sir E. Grey that Mr. H. A. Byatt, the acting commissioner of Somaliland, who is now on leave in this country, has been consulted with regard to the suggestion of the Italian Government referred to in the second paragraph of your letter. 2. Mr. Byatt states that arms are imported into British Somaliland, but that he has never known a case in which arms have been exported from the protectorate across the Gulf of Aden, and that, with the exception of a very few dhows registered at Zeyla, no dhows from the protectorate touch at Turkish ports/ 3. Assuming, however, that arms are exported from British Somaliland to the Yemen, Mr. Byatt doubts whether, under the existing legislation, certificates could be [ refused to any dhow leaving the Somali Coast for ostensibly innocent purposes, and he I is of opinion that, even if the procedure suggested by the Italian Government were adopted, it would not prevent dhows from conveying contraband to Yemen ports. He points out, for instance, that a dhow might be furnished with a certificate from Berbera to Mokha. The dhow leaves Berbera, picks up contraband at some obscure place on the Somali Coast, sails for some point on the Arabian coast (say, near Mokha) where there are no customs officials, lands the contraband, and then proceeds to Mokra, where her master shows her original papers certifying her to be engaged in an honest trade. The mere fact that there are no customs officials at the places where the contraband is taken on board and landed makes it almost impossible to prove that the dhow has diverged from her course.

This Document is the property of the Secretary of State for India. Arms Traffic (outside Persian Gulf). The question of the illicit traffic in arms, both within and without the Persian Gulf, is one which has continuously engaged the attention of Govern ment for some years past. The subject of the India Letter No. 112 (Secret), dated 30th trade within the Gulf has been dealt with in July 1903. (Pol. 1112/03.) recent Despatches from the Government of India, and the issues relating thereto are familiar. The trade outside the Gulf has come into special prominence, since the outbreak of the troubles in Somaliland, in connection with the supply of arms to the Mullah. The correspondence on the subject, even that portion of it which has passed through this Department, is voluminous. It may be convenient, therefore, to summarise the main conclusions which appear to be established by the papers in our possession, e.g., as to the ports of supply, the ports of entry, the various proposals which have been made for suppressing the traffic, and, as regards those which have been adopted, what measure of success has been achieved or what reasons assigned for failure. It may be premised that it seems possible to deal only with the organised or “ systematic ” traffic. There exists also a “ spasmodic ” traffic which is engaged in, as an extra venture, by masters of dhows carrying other merchandise, and which it is considered impracticable to suppress, having regard to the unceasing demand for arms of precision,— often, in times of disturbance, at prices admitting of a handsome profit,—and having regard also to the large number of arms already in the hands of the natives of the territories affected. It is of course difficult to draw the line of distinction very clearly between the two kinds of traffic, and it will be observed that some authorities have at times displayed a tendency to absolve themselves from the responsibility of dealing with the evil, by representing that the traffic within their juris diction is of the “ spasmodic ”—and irrepressible— kind. Ports of Supply. First, as regards ports of supply. Jibuti. There is a general consensus of opinion that Jibuti is the distributing centre for the trade outside the Persian Gulf. The complaint is of old standing, and is barely disputed even by the S. 39. A , /French themselves. It may, however, he worth while to bring together into a brief resume some facts concerning the trade at Jibuti and its ramifi cations, and some opinions expressed on the subject by various authorities since the Brussels Convention was signed (1890). In 1891 the Government of India brought to notice the large importation of arms from Jibuti into the (Abyssinian) territories adjacent to the French and English Somali Protectorates; they suggested that the French Government should he urged to place some restriction on such consign ments. It was not, however, practicable to address a remonstrance to France on this occasion, as we had ourselves just granted permission for a large consignment to pass through Zeyla to Has Makunan (Sir E. Baring having telegraphed that “ he gets arms freely from Jibuti.”) In 1892 the Aden authorities, with reference to complaints regarding the assistance which, it was alleged, was being given by them to the Arab insurgents against Turkish rule in Yemen, reported that a large trade in arms was carried on “ from the French ports in the Gulf of Aden ” to Yemen generally, to the Bed Sea ports and to the open coast between Aden and Perim. In 1894 papers were sent home concerning an enquiry which the Austrian Lloyds had addressed to the Resident as to the grant of a licence to tranship at Aden no less than 100 tons of empty cartridge cases destined for Obokh. The permit had of course been refused in the absence of information as to the consignees. In 1895 the Resident, again with reference to a complaint by the Turks, declared that it was impossible for a systematic trade in arms with the interior to be carried on from Aden with the existing police and other arrangements on sea and land. He referred to the general belief at Aden that arms, &amp;c., were being systematically imported from to Europe to Obokh ; thence transferred to Jibuti and run over in quick-sailing “ buggalows ” to the Arabian coast (e.g., Shaikh Said and Ras-al- Arah), the Resident being unable with the means at his disposal to keep an effectual watch for dhows which can make the trip in a few hours and which may be flying a foreign flag. In the same &gt;ear, the Italian Government, in consequence of theii troubles in Abyssinia, pressed for the prohibition of the importation of arms to Menelek through Zeyla. His Majesty’s Govern ment agreed, and the necessary instructions were sent to the Aden authorities. As the Italian Government in preferring their request had asked for those “ pledges of principle which the French Government would be prepared to give,” it was hoped that the French would follow suit. Nevertheless, in 1896 we received a most circum stantial account, contained in a letter* from Lieu tenant Harrington, then Assistant Resident at No. 169 (Secret), dated 7th October 1891.

In 1897 Mr. (now Sir B .) Bodd reported strongly Despatch to Foreign Office, No. 37, dated on the whole question, his conclusion being that 4th June 1897. t | ie c i auS es of the Brussels Act “ operate simply as a self-denying ordinance for the conscientious.” He explained that while, theoreti cally, arms for Abyssinia were exported to that country from Jibuti on demand from the Emperor Menelek only,—such arms having free transit in accordance with the Brussels Act,—practically “ any Abyssinian or Arab coming to Jibuti can buy a rifle.” On guns sold in the Colony a tax of one dollar apiece was levied; a formal notification of sale had to be given to the authorities, and there the control apparently begins and ends. “ There would appear to be nothing to prevent the “ buyer reselling his rifle even to a Somali.” The result of inquiries addressed to French merchants and of experiments actually made was to show that there was no difficulty even for a native to buy a rifle direct from the shops on payment of the G-overnment tax. In conclusion Mr. Bodd adverted, in words which have been borne out by subsequent experience, to the manner in which the Jibuti traffic reacts on the trade elsewhere :—“ The large “ stocks now lying at Jibuti (the Abyssinian market “ had been glutted) are being sold in thousands to “ Arabs who cross from the opposite coast in their “ dhows. While we in Aden scrupulously forbid “ even the transhipment of arms, Arabs from all “ that neighbourhood are able to satisfy their “ requirements at Jibuti, and a French merchant “ told me that some 20,000 rifles had gone over to “ Yemen during the last year.” Mr. Bodd summed up: “ We are labouring to carry out the difficult “ and elaborate provisions of the Brussels Act at “ Suakin, Zeyla, and Zanzibar, with the simple “ result that a lucrative traffic passes into the hands “ of our less scrupulous neighbours.” Effect of the traffic at Jibutipossible The next year, 1898, representations regarding danger to Aden garrison. lack of restriction on the trade at Jibuti and India Letter No. 71, dated 5th May 1898. ^ ie conse quent supply of arms to the tribes in the vicinity of Aden were made by the Government of India. The Besident reported that the purchase of arms at Jibuti was openly admitted by some See also Pol. 1038/99. (Atiffi) tribesmen, and that there was no doubt that such importation was general and carried on without difficulty. He pointed out his own inability to check the growing trade, since the importation did not pass through British territory and the Brussels Act conferred no right of search; and since also the Sheikhs, who profited pecuniarily and otherwise by the traffic, would not put an end to it nor could they be compelled by the terms of our treaties with them to do so. He expressed the opinion that the tribes, as they became supplied with arms of precision and proficient in their4 handling, might eventually become “ a difficulty, “ if not, indeed, a menace to the garrison at ** Aden.” These papers were referred to the Foreign Office, who did not see their way to address the French Government direct, as had been suggested. They communicated, however, with the Turkish Govern ment in case the Porte might wish to send a remonstrance to the French. The result was not helpful, as the Turks merely thought the occasion a suitable one for requesting that the Aden authorities should refrain from interfering with any measures they might decide to take, to check the traffic, at Pas-al-Arah, within our Protectorate. For some time alter this the bulk of the papers refer to the trade in the Persian Gulf where the “ Baluchistan” seizures had just taken place ; but with the continuance of the troubles in Somaliland attention was again directed to the traffic outside the Gulf. Cf. Pol. $ 69 / 04 . A memorandum, dated the 24th October 1901, by Consul-General Hayes'Sadler, on the subject of “ the trade in arms at Jibuti and the danger arising “ therefrom to our possessions in East Africa,” was in November 1901 made the text of proposals for concerted action by the Governments of Italy and France and Sis Majesty’s Government (through the Government of India, the Admiralty, and the Somali Coast authorities) with a view to the suppression of the traffic. Fieutenant-Colonel Sadler said “ the most effectual remedy naturally “ lies in closing the market, and this rests with the “ French themselves.” He went on to suggest measures which might be taken should the French Government decline to co-operate; but in that event, he feared, “ we shall not be able altogether “ to stop the trade, though . . . we may be able to check it and make it dangerous and expensive.” Proposals for concerted action (No vember 1901). North-East Africa and Soudan Print, 24 th October, Sect. 2. The Consul at Zeyla had previously (on 7th June Arms Traffic Print (Sect. No. 51). 1901) given information regarding the discharge at Jibuti of a large cargo of arms and ammunition, comprising, it was said, some 10,000 rifles, which had been distributed among the shops of the Greek merchants, a large number of them being purchased locally by Arabs, Somalis, and Abyssinians, but the majority placed in sailing boats and despatched to Pas Ara, Maide, and Persian Gulf ports. The Resident, also, in a report to the Govern ment of Bombay, dated 26th September 1901, had referred to an inquiry recently made by a German firm, “whether there were any obstacles to the “ transhipment at Aden for Jibuti of guns, cart- “ ridges, and mountain cannons in large quantities 30 or 40 tons fortnightly being mentioned as probable consignments. On the 27th August 1901 Sir E. Monson was instructed to call the attention of the French Representations to the French Go vernment. Pol. 2274 / 01 .Government to the inconvenience caused to the British and Italian Governments by the unre stricted trade in arms at Jibuti. He was to appeal to the Brussels Act, and also to Article YI. of the Anglo-Erench Agreement of 1888, and to inquire whether the French Government would he prepared to take part in concerted action for suppressing the traffic. Orders issued for regulating the traffic at Jibuti in 1901 ; their character. (Acting Consul-General Cordeaux, No. 141, 11th October 1901.) Aden letter, No. 118, dated 16th October 1901. (Arms Traffic Print, Sect. 65.) In October 1901 the Consul-General at Berbera reported that orders regulating the import and sale of arms and ammunition at Jibuti had recently been issued by the French Somali Protectorate authorities. The precise intention of these orders the Consul- General had been unable to ascertain, but he thought they must be “of a strictly prohibitive nature,” judging from the effect produced by their promulgation on the local market. The merchants were hastily selling off their stock and shipping it on board dhows bound for ports on the Bed Sea littoral, for Bas Ara, Mokallah, and even Basra. In the meantime, they were raising a great outcry and bringing pressure to bear upon the Home Government. This resulted in some abatement from the “ strictly prohibitive ” character of the orders, which it was arranged were not to take full effect until the time allowed for disposing of existing stocks, including consignments already on the w 7 ay, had elapsed. Moreover, information was given by the Italian Consul-General to the Aden authorities, to the effect that the orders had been rescinded so far as the Turkish dominions were concerned, and that they had actually been in force as against Turkish Arabia for two days only. Further representations to French Government. (Despatch to India, No. 13, dated 11th April 1902, Enclosure 2.) On 6th December 1901 Sir E. Monson called attention to the fact that the instructions issued to the Governor of French Somaliland to adhere strictly to the provisions of the Brussels Act did not seem to have had the desired effect. The French Government replied that they had issued instructions and did not feel called upon to do more ; that no arms could be sold in Jibuti without the Governor’s knowledge, and that they were powerless to prevent the shipping of arms for ports outside the zone contemplated bv the Brussels Act.* The traffic at Jibuti; how far regu lated. Despatch to India, No. 13, dated Uth April 1902, Enclosure 9, Annex 3. In February 1902 the Commander of H.M.S. “ Cossack,” in a report on the conditions of the traffic at the time, said: “The French authorities “ do not allow arms to be sold to Somali tribes, “ but there is no difficulty in obtaining a permit “ to ship . . . it* the Captain declares he is “ bound to an Arabian port.” * Viz. : “ The territories comprised between latitude 20 N. “ and 22 S., and extending westward to the Atlantic Ocean and “ eastward to the Indian Ocean and its dependencies. 1 ’ S. 39. B6 Further light is thrown on the nature of the control exercised at Jibuti by the circumstances attending the seizure in March 1902 by H.M.S. “ Cossack” of a fishing boat laden with arms and ammunition. Though hailing from Sur (in Oman), the crew confessed to having purchased the guns at Jibuti ; the Acting Consul-General believed that many similar cases were occurring, and that the fishermen not only invested their earnings in these goods, but were also financed by local merchants, the profits of the trade being large, since the price of a rifle with 100 rounds of ammunition was 15 dollars at Jibuti, and 45 dollars, e.g., at the Mijjertein ports. The papers found on board this dhow disclosed the fact that Arab middlemen were employed at Jibuti for conducting the traffic ; and the master of the dhow declared that he did not see a single official there, either European or Native, and that no attempt was made to verify his papers or inspect his vessel before departure. Arms Traffic Print, Sect. 80. The French Ambassador, who had been ap proached on the subject in April and again in May 1902, said that his Government had already made representations to the local authorities. These seem to have produced some effect, for the Senior Naval Officer reported in June 1902 that the Governor of Jibuti was taking “ very stringent measures,” the premises of arms dealers being watched by police, and a dhow seized containing a cargo of arms for the Arabian coast. The Jibuti authorities also punished, with imprisonment and confiscation of property, the owner of a boat which an armed dhow manned from H.M.S. “Perseus” had captured, with arms on board, in June 1902, bound for Bir Ali, a small roadstead in Aden waters. By July 1902 the Senior Naval Officer considered that the Governor’s strong measures had, for a time at least, “ paralysed the export trade.” In October 1902 the French were reported to have an armed dhow cruising to prevent the traffic with British and Italian ports. They were also requested to notify to the Aden authorities the departure of dhows for poits outside the prohibited zone* (Foreign Office Despatch to Sir E. Monson, No. 187). “ Stringent measures ” at Jibut,i 1902. Despatch to India, No. 42, of 3rd October 1902, Enclosure 9, Annex. Ditto, Enclosure 15, Annex 2. Large consignments, however, continued to pour into Jibuti. In August 1902 it was reported from Aden that 225 cases of rifles and 525 of ammunition had been landed from the steamship “ Turkestan” at Jibuti, and that a large country boat loaded with rifles, &amp;c., had left that port for the Arabian coast. Further consignments arrived in the “ Madagascar,” the “ Kor Byster,” “ Vildymeis,” and “Africander.” The Aden authorities reported the distribution of these arms by buggalows sailing to various ports on the opposite coast. Large consignments sent to Jibuti, 1902; * See French Government’s statement (page 5) in December 1901.Enclosure of Bombay Letter No. 40, dated It was observed bv the Resident at Aden, in a 14th October 1902. {Pol, 1605 / 02 .) report dated 13th September 1902, that the major portion of the consignments for Jibuti were being carried in British-owned ships from Marseilles. Effect of the measures taken by the French. Arms Traffic Print, Sect. 102. The view taken by His Majesty’s Government at this stage is contained in a note which was com municated in December 1902 to the French Ambassador. It was there pointed out that 44 the &lt;c Jibuti fire-arms traffic is now entering on a new “ and more dangerous phase ” ; that, as the over-sea traffic with the north coast ports of the Somali Protectorate was now practically dead,* and as the Abyssinians were getting their supplies direct from Europe, the surplus stock at Jibuti was finding an outlet overland to the Ogaden country. In February 1903 the French Ambassador stated Diversion of the traffic to Ahyesinia. ^ Mg Government had made special inquil , ies into the matter, and had ascertained positively that no arms found their way direct from Jibuti into Somaliland. There was admitted to be a trade with Abyssinia, whence presumably came the arms of French manufacture found in Somaliland. This was also the view of the Naval Commander- in-Chief and of the Italian Government. The Naval Commander-in-Chief, reporting on 1st April 1903, said: “ I am of opinion that gun- “ running by sea is practically stopped, owing to “ patrolling by men-of-war, and that arms are u brought into Somaliland from Jibuti to Harrar, “ and distributed . . . from the latter place by “ caravan.” The Italian Ambassador, in a note of 14th July 1903, after belittling the part played by the Pol. 2853 / 03 . Mij jertein Sheikhs in supplying arms to the Mullah, remarked: “ He has a more safe and prompt way “ of obtaining arms, viz., Harrar and Jibuti, where “ stores are known to exist, and which are the “ centre of the arms trade in the Bed Sea and the Gulf of Aden.” Present condition of traffic at Jibuti. Despatch to India {Secret) No. 2, dated 15th January 190 /,., Enclosure 7, Annex 3 and /,. Pol. 3185/03. So the matter rests with regard to Jibuti. The result of the measures taken appears to have been the checking (for a time) of the dhow-borne traffic and its diversion to Abyssinia. Here the Abyssinian authorities are understood to have taken steps to regulate the traffic (especially with Somalis), the effect of which is said to have been to render un profitable legitimate traffic. But it is also under stood that the consignments sent out by at least one well-known English firm to their agent at Harrar have not been diminishing. Meanwhile, it is hardly safe to assume that the dhow traffic has completely ceased, while the difficulties of coping with it are represented by the naval authorities to be as formidable as ever. Moreover, in a despatch of 20th October 1903, the British Consul at Marseilles draws attention to the continued importation of * The^uaval authorities so reported.8 arms into Jibuti. “ Every steamer leaving Mar- “ seilles for Jibuti has some on board, discarded “ French rifles or weapons of Belgian make.” See also India Letter No. §3 (Secret), dated 21st April ItyOU, as to traffic at Jibuti (Pol. § 69 ) 01 /). As regards the other ports of supply, what was Ports of Supply other than Jibuti, said by Consul Cordeaux in November 1901 seems still to be applicable :—“ However many channels “ there may be, they all start from Jibuti, and “ until the fountain head is closed, it will be “ difficult to check the flow to any appreciable “extent.” Before referring to the “channels” alluded to (which from the Somaliland point of view are to be reckoned among “ ports of supply,”) mention may be made of two sources said to be independent of Jibuti.

The authorities there, though observing all vigilance, were unable to obtain confirmation of the report, which they suggested had been spread in order to impress the Mullah’s followers with the extent of his influence and the ubiquity of his agents. Muscat .—As far back as 1892 apprehensions had been expressed that arms from Muscat might find their way back to the Benadir and Somali coasts; and in 1899 representations on the subject from the Italian Consul-General at Zanzibar were referred to the Government of India, who replied that there was ground for believing that the Italian fears were not altogether unfounded. Export from Muscat at Sur, where there was very little demand for arms, was then said to be not only permitted but encouraged by the Sultan The Government of India hoped to enlist the Sultan’s assistance in checking the traffic both within and without the Gulf. The Political Agent at Muscat, in a report on this subject, of 29th January 1900 observes “ it is “ certain that there is no organised traffic from “ Muscat southwards,” and suggests the following explanation : — To the uninitiated “ Suri ” and “ Maskati ” as applied to Arab dhows are synonymous; but the owners of Suri dhows are only in name subjects of the Sultan of Muscat; on the other hand they often fly the French flag, and are welcome guests at Jibuti, where many of them own plots of ground. At Sur they take on hoard as cargo dates, from Oman and from Basra, for conveyance to East Africa; after disposing of these dates they invest the proceeds in arms at Jibuti, and ship them to the Benadir and Somali coasts. In view of the conditions of trade as described above, and taking into account the variations of the monsoon, it suited the Suri dhows better to get their arms at Jibuti, (where there was then a free market) than from Muscat itself, and Captain Cox did not think, from the informa tion he possessed, that Muscat arms were sent dowm 'to Sur.

(Annex 2, Enclosure 7 to Despatch to India (Secret), No. 2 , of 15th January IQO 4 .) In a letter to the Naval Commander-in-Chief of 21st March 1903, Major Cox repeats his opinion that Suri dhows carrying arms for Somaliland obtain them from Jibuti, and not from Muscat. In any case it is certain that the Persian Grulf, and not the Gulf of Aden, is the main field of Muscat activity. In this connection it may he observed that the recent case of a seizure of arms in Muscat harbour and their release upon their being declared as under shipment to Sur, shows that, in spite of the “ assistance” rendered by the Sultan (in the way of notifications &amp;c.,)* a loophole has been left. The export of arms to Sur is permitte d, and this, as the naval authorities pointed out, protects a dhow until she passes “ the Quoins,’’ i.e. until “all chance “ of identifying her as carrying arms will have “ been lost.” Aden Protectorate ports. There remain as ports of supply the ports of the Aden Protectorate. In view of the repeated requests preferred upon this Office to obtain assistance from the Eesident, and since it is only with the ports under Aden jurisdiction that the Eesident is directly concerned, it will be as well to examine closely the evidence implicating these ports. Evidence implicating Aden ports. Enclosure to India letter No. 166, dated 17th October 1901. Arms Traffic Print, Section 56. India, 17th October 1901. During 1901 the Italian Government took up the question of the arms traffic, and on the 17th July 1901 the Foreign Office sent over, to be laid before the Secretary of State, a note from the Italian Ambassador, suggesting that a stricter supervision should be exercised over Somali sam- bouks, said to be engaged in the contraband traffic between Aden and Bombay and Somaliland. On this suggestion the views of Consul-General Hayes Sadler and the Eesident were obtained. Lieutenant-Colonel Hayes Sadler, in Despatch dated 12th August 1901, said : “ My information “ in no way points to the trade being carried on “ by the lines indicated by the Italian Ambas- “ sad or . . . The arms are obtained at Jibuti, “ and they are taken to the Mijjertein coast, either “ direct from Jibuti or from ports on the Eed “ Sea, or South Arabia, by buggalows belonging to “ the Mijjertein, or to Arabs plying between the “ south coast of Arabia and the north African “ shore .... Such buggalows would Lave “ every reason to avoid the British ports named “ (Aden, Bombay, and Zanzibar), and the ports of “ this (the British Somali) Protectorate, where all “ possible preventive measures are taken.” On the strength of this the Government of India saw no advantage to be gained by stricter super vision at Aden. The Eesident, in his report of 26th September 1901, said: “ there is reason to believe that “ the importation of arms and ammunition is “ carried on at Eas-el-Arah (the extreme western S. 39. C10 “limit of our protectorate), at Shukra, and at the “T urkish ports on the Red Sea. They are “ most frequently brought from Jibuti in boats ‘ ‘with other cargo, . . . many of which uy “ the Trench flag, and could not he overhauled. At it was supposed that measures of suppression were being taken at Jibuti, the Government of India were requested to issue instructions in the sense of the recommendations contained in Consul- General Hayes Sadler’s memorandum of 24th October 1901, so far as these referred to the Aden authorities. , ^ ., In his letter of 2Sth March 1902 tue Resident reported the action taken. The particular places mentioned as possibly con cerned in the traflic were Mokallah, Balhaf, Shukra, Ras Imran, and Ras Arab. As regaids Mokallah the Resident pointed out that, while the Sultan was very anxious to obtain arms for himself, he was very much against anyone else getting them, for possible use against himself. As regards Shukra no definite confirmation of the reports had been obtained, but they were considered possibly to have some foundation. As regards the general questionIt is very doubtful whether any but “ small quantities of arms are landed at Mokallah, “ or any of the Arabian ports,” but “ dhows “ come across the Gulf, take in water and pro- “ visions at some place not further east than “ Mokallah, and then make for one of the ports “ on the Mijjertein shore.” On 25th May 1902 the Resident explained “ the reason why dhows with “ arms come to the Arabian coast at all is because the “ Trench authorities at Jibuti will not permit the “ export of arms direct to Somaliland. The arms “ are therefore purchased by Arab “ Mulla, who ship them in dhows for “ on the Arabian coast. There the dhows stay a day or two, take in provisions and water, and “ start again for the coast of Africa.” This statement, read in connection with Consul- General Sadler’s account of the way in which road steads in Aden waters are resorted to for tranship ment of arms from Arab dhows hailing from Jibuti to Mijjertein, and other dhows, bound for the Mijjertein coast, seems fairly conclusive as to the nature of the traffic carried on within the Aden jurisdiction. It is in keeping, too, with what the Italians themselves represented. The Mijjertein Sultan, Othman Mahmoud, informed an Italian naval officer that “ the Native vessels take the arms on board at a place on the Arab coast bordering on Sheikh Osman territory ” (at the western extremity of the British Protectorate) and also at Sheikh Ghadir further west. “ The Native vessels are “ visited by the British authorities on their arrival “ at, and departure from, Aden, and provided by “ these with papers regularised in due order; once “ in possession of these papers, they start and agents of the some port f Despatch No. 1901. 37, dated 15th November Pol.

There are, as has frequently been pointed out, no coast police, nor, if there were, could they effectually watch the long stretch of coast since the buggalows naturally seek the remoter roadsteads, and, as the Government of Bombay observe (22nd May 1902), “ the coast watch “ can never be sufficient, so far as the Arabian “ trade is concerned, as our protectorate does not “ extend far enough westward.” The regular interchanging of returns of the dates of arrival and departure of dhows between, e.g., Aden and our Somali Protectorate, while affording perhaps ground for suspicion of particular craft, is clearly not suffi cient to establish guilt.

To return to the suspect Aden ports. In February 1902, the Commander of the “ Cossack,” on information received from “ two intelligent local Arabs,” named Mokallah and Balhaf as, in his opinion, “ the principal places for the export of arms from the Arabian coast,” the trade at the former place being “ carried on openly.” This is not inconsistent with the belief of the Resident that the Sultan of Mokallah disapproved of the trade, for, as stated by the Government of Bombay, “ his influence in his own territory is “ very small as compared with that of his nephews, “ who are not so scrupulously observant of orders.” The same two places, Mokallah and Balhaf, were in April 1902 declared by the Italians (relying apparently on the statement of an emissary of the Mijjertein Sultan, himself a suspect) to be “ the places from which the arms are shipped.” On the other hand, when the “ Cossack ” visited these two ports in May 1902, 18 vessels were searched without result. The “Perseus” in July met with no greater success. In May 1903, the Consul at Berbera, referring to the continued importation of arms at Bosaso, in the Italian Protectorate, suggested thar as that port trades principally with Mokallah the latter “ is probably an entrepot for supplies for the Mullah.” H.M.S. “ Pomone ” accordingly visited the place as well as the neighbouring Ash Sheyr. All the dhows in the harbour were boarded and nothing suspicious found. Assurances were received from the Sultan’s son and from the agent of a firm of merchants resident at Mokallah, that no arms * “At Has Imran, . . . the Sultan of Lahej does his best to stop the trade, but there is a certain amount of transhipment to Mijjertein Somali dhows and also a number of dhows carrying arms to other ports, resorting to Has Imram to water.” (Despatch to India, No. 13, of 11th April 1902, Enclosure 9, Annex 3).were being sent to Somaliland from either port. A jemadar of police from Aden also made inquiries in the town, but was unable to obtain any infor mation of the traffic. The conclusions arrived at by the naval authorities were— (1) That no traffic could go on without the Sultan’s connivance; (2) That very little traffic in arms takes place from Mokallah. The Resident had previously reported that he had Pol. 529/03. never been able to obtain any confirmation of Mokallah being an entrepot of the traffic. On the whole, the evidence that Aden ports are Pol. 705/02. to any great extent concerned in the arms trade to Somaliland, except indirectly, does not seem to be overwhelming. To complete the review of possible ports of Red Sea Ports, supply mention should he made of the Red Sea ports above Hodeida, to which frequent sailings from Jibuti have been reported. A long stretch of this littoral is not even nominally under the effective control of the Turks—or was not towards the end of 1902, when the coast between Loheya and Jeddah (within which points lie Medi, Soorer, and lievis, to all of which shipments of arms have been definitely reported), was in the hands of the Enclosure 3 of Bombay letter No. 40, Imam of Sana. dated 14th October 1902. The arms run on this coast, however, are probably absorbed in Yemen. Ports of entry call for little comment. Apart from the overland route via Harrar and possibly also overland from various points along the East African coast, import can take place— (i) through the British Somali Protectorate (some 400 miles), (a) from the western extremity to Berbera; (b) from Berbera eastwards ; (ii) through the Italian Protectorate. As regards (i) (a) there was considered in 1901 to be little cause for apprehension in view of the control exercised from Zeyla and Berbera; and that control has since increased rather than diminished. As regards (i) (b) while there was in 1901 no reason to suppose that arms were landed to any appreciable extent, there was at that time nothing to prevent it. Since then, however, measures have been taken to render the control of this part of our Protectorate effective. There remains, therefore, the Italian coast. The state of affairs in 1901 is thus described by Lieutenant'Colonel Hayes Sadler: “The Mijjertein “ have agents in their ports who arrange for the “ sale of produce from the interior and for the “ remittance of cash to Jibuti for the purchase of “ arms.” This—which points to the existence of Ports of Entry.

The chief places mentioned in connection with the traffic are Bosaso (Bunder Kasim), and Has Alula. That the conditions have changed but little the following extract from a report by the Commander of H.M.S. “ Fox,” dated the 14th October 1903, would seem to show : “ We have in the Italian “ sphere such large trading places as Zaida, Bunder “ Kasim, Has Alula, Boraida on the north, and the “ splendid sheltered anchorages at Bas Hufun on “ the east coast, in addition to such places as Illig, “ Obbia, &amp;c. This coast is under normal (sic ? no- “ minal) protection of Italy, but the Italians make “ no attempt to control it, beyond obtaining cer- “ tain promises in treaties :!: from the various native “ chiefs; and it is not to their interest to interfere “ so long as things remain quiet within their “ protectorate.” The Italian Government have throughout dis played their readiness to adopt measures of suppression in concert with His Majesty’s Govern ment. They have seriously warned the Mijjertein Sultan and have sent men-of-war to patrol the coast. But the Italian naval officers would not admit that any considerable traffic was really carried on from their protectorate, and it is true that the dhow-searching cruisers of the “ Cossack ” and the t; Caprera ” in April 1903 proved practically fruitless. The Italian Government also have from time to time expressed doubts as to the existence of systematic, as distinguished from spasmodic traffic on the Mijjertein coast, perhaps relying too implicitly on the assuiances of a Mijjertein headman which Consul Cordeaux characterised as worthless. On the other hand the Italian Government have admitted, in despatches, that “ it is likely enough “ that Osman Mahmoud (the Mijjertein Sultan) should have yielded in some way to the pressure “ of the Mullah, of whose violence and threats he “ goes in great fear,” and, again, “ the Sultan and his party are unable to keep a more effective “ watch in ever so small a degree. . . . The Sultan “ has only an imaginary authority in that wild “ country.” Moreover, the Commander of H.M.S. “Fox” observes, “It is immensely to these “ (Italian) Chiefs’ advantage to assist the arms “ traffic, the risk of a few rifles lost making little “ difference compared with the profit gained by “ selling the arms and keeping on friendly 7 terms “ with the Mullah.” Measures of Suppression. Lastly, as to the measures adopted with a view to suppressing the trade. S. 39. D14 Action taken by the Resident at Aden. It will be convenient in the first place to recount wliat the Resident has done and why, with the means at his disposal, he can do no more. The first step was the issue of notifications and warnings against the traffic. As regards Aden itself the strict provisions of the Indian Arms Act were already well-known and enforced. But the loll owing further measures were taken. Among Lieutenant-Colonel Hayes Sadler’s recom mendations which were adopted by the Foreign Office towards the end of 1901, was one that the Resident should be empowered to order, if necessary, the stoppage of all trade between Aden and the offending Somali ports. Our despatch of the 15th November 1901 requested that the necessary instructions should he given; but the orders at first sent to the Resident by the Bombay Govern ment seem to have been simply that the gun-boat at Aden should stop or capture all dhows, with the exception of those flying the French flag, suspected of bringing arms to the Aden Coast. In March 1902, however, the Resident expressed his willing ness to resort to the extreme measure of stopping all trade between Aden and any Somali ports which might be named by the Somali Coast authorities. Shortly afterwards, owing to a serious recrudescence of the traffic, the Resident was called upon by Colonel Swayr.e to fulfil this undertaking and to take steps for diverting Aden trade from the Eastern ports of Somaliland to Berbera and the more westerly ports, where more complete control could be exercised. He accordingly issued a set of rules requiring that all ships leaving Aden for ports on either side of the Gulf of Aden should take out a port-clearance and that the masters should execute a joint and several bond before leaving. Penalties, of fine or imprisonment, or both, were prescribed against vessels which might be found not to have proceeded direct to their destination (except under stress of weather, &amp;c.) or which should be found to have engaged in the arms traffic after clearing from Aden. These rules, which the Resident explained were intended to meet an acute, though temporary emergency and which he was subsequently autho rised to relax at his discretion, were found to have been ultra vires, and steps were taken in India to legalise them by the issue of a notification under Cap. 3 Viet. 33. Even the amended Regulation, however, which was entitled “ the Aden Sea Traffic in Arms Regulation, 1902,” does not appear to have contemplated the case of the trade with the Red Sea ports; it was aLo feared that the rules were evaded by vessels sailing for the Mijjertein ports, and thence sending their cargoes overland. Steps to remedy this defect were taken hy the Italian Consul-General who required that masters of such vessels should execute a bond first to touch at r Notifications at Aden itself.

The issue of such a proclamation in regard to the operations in Somaliland was not, however, con sidered expedient. conditions, only act through the Maritime Chiefs. These have been repeatedly warned against con niving at the arms traffic; hut for these warnings to he effective several conditions must he fulfilled. The chiefs and the tribes under them are often interested in the traffic pecuniarily or otherwise. The .Resident can urge the chiefs to put a stop to it on pain of the displeasure of Government, and can employ the threat of withholding subsidies and closing the ports concerned ; hut the latter is an extreme measure and the former of doubtful expediency, since it is considered absolutely neces sary to enlist the aid of the chiefs. power to co-operate. Some of the more important Chiefs are allowed to indent on Government for a limited number of arms each year. This policy, it was hoped, would not only enable Government to control the supply of arms at any time, but would also render it to the interest of these chiefs to “ the trade is extremely profitable, and the small Arab chiefs are as a rule needy, and, of course, “ avaricious.” In spite of the temptation which thus exists to connive at the smuggling of arms, the Sultan of Lahej, on the west, has been reported, even by the naval authorities, to he doing his best to suppress it; and the Sultan of Mokallah, in the east, (who has special reasons for wishing to stand strict orders that all dhows at Mokallah should he searched and that all arms found should be con fiscated. The Resident was satisfied that these orders would be carried out; and the reception given by the Mokallah authorities to the officers of the “Cossack” in 1903 seems to confirm this the authority of the Sultan of Lahej on the west, and of the Sultan, of Shehr and Mokallah on the east, in order that they may be able to put down the traffic more effectually. For this, however. Suggested Proclamation. India letterl35, of 7th August 1902. It should be added that the Resident represented that his hands would he considerably strengthened Outside Aden the Resident can, under present Attitude of the Chiefs towards the arms traffic.

On leaving for India in 1902 he gave view. India Letter No. 135 (Secret), dated 7th August 1902. (Pol. 1lIf3/02.) As to the power of the chiefs, it has been the policy of the Government of India to consolidatetime is required, and such a state of affairs as prevailed in Mokallah during 1902 (when Sultan Awadth’s nephews were in revolt against him) was all in favour of a brisk trade in arms being carried on. The other means at the disposal of the Resident are what may be called “ preventive measures.’ At Aden itself these are very rigorous. The Arms Act is strictly administered, and Colonel Abud, reporting on 13th September 1902 as to the alleged shipments of ammunition by country boats leaving Aden for Red Sea ports, said : “ Only “ very small quantities of ammunition are ever “ imported into Aden, and ... as none is &lt;c manufactured at Aden, none can be exported. “ No ammunition can, moreover, be exported from “ Aden without a license, and no licenses have “ been issued for the export of ammunition by “ country craft.’ As regards illicit import and export, he was convinced that it could not possibly exist, owing to the safe-guards employed. Country craft especially are subjected to close supervision, both on arrival and departure, and the trade registration officials, as well as the harbour police have instructions to keep a special look out for arms and ammunition. The seizures of ammunition, &amp;c., at Aden in July and October 1903, and Major Rilleau’s successful capture of arms in Socotra last year, show that the Aden authorities are not relaxing their vigilance. Along the coast of the Protectorate, “ with its innumerable small ports and watering places,” no such thorough measures are possible. The naval authorities have advocated the establishment of police posts at Ras Imran and other places—an expedient which seems open to objection on political grounds, and one which is not likely to prove effective, as fixed posts, while difficult to establish, are easy to evade. On one occasion the Resident suggested that a small but well-paid force of coast police, under European supervision, as in the British Somali Protectorate, should be instituted. This suggestion, the Government of Bombay observed, required consideration. In the absence of some such service, however, very little can be done by means of a few police agents, for, as the Resident has pointed out, “ the moment a man “ known to be in our employ leaves Aden the fact “ is widely published.” Under existing conditions, therefore, it is clear that the work of suppressing the traffic on the Aden coast must fall in the main on the Royal Navy. Periodical patrols by men-of-war or armed dhows seem likely to prove more effective than any action which can be taken on land, and par ticularly as regards that transhipment of arms from Arab to Mijjertein Somali dhows in Aden waters which has been described above.

A general warning against participation in the traffic was given in 1901 by the Acting Consul- General, who visited all the small ports from Berhera eastwards for the purpose. Agents were placed in all the flag ports ; it was found possible to establish ports of control into which the buggalow trade was more or less directed. In addition to patrolling by British and Italian ships, armed dhows have been employed as revenue cutlers for the Protectorate and King’s Begulations issued to legalise their action within the territorial waters. These dhows appear to have proved a success. Measures taken by the Italian Authorities. Despatch to India, No. 13, dated 11th April 1902, Enclosure 8, Annex 4.

The action taken by the Italians has been confined for the most part to warnings addressed to the Chiefs and patrolling by sea. It has been pointed out that they have the buggalow traffic in their power ; they themselves recognised that they can threaten to suspend subsidies and to bombard the offending ports. But the measures suggested by Colonel Swayne in August 1902 (viz., the blockade of Othman Mahmud’s coasts and the seizure of his buggalows) were too drastic for the Italian Government, and since the affair at Baraida, the Commander of H.M.S, “Pox” reports, the Italian naval officers have had strict orders not to land any men for the purposes of search. Italian Somaliland is thus much less completely controlled than is the British protectorate; and the more stringent the measures taken by the British authorities the more important will this fact become.

Despatch to India, No. 2, dated 15th January 1904, Enclosure 7, Annex 6. * Unfortunately, this assumption would hardly hold good in a court of law. Naval Measures. British men-of-war have been specially employed in patrolling the coast since 1901, and Italian vessels have acted in conjunction with them. Dhows have been seized from time to time, and many more subjected to examination, with the result tfat the arms traffic was “ at a standstill ” in May 1902 ; “recent measures have exercised a depressing effect ” (June 1902) ; “ gun-running by sea has been practically stopped ” (April 1903). But the naval authorities are of opinion that the illicit traffic cannot be completely stopped by ships alone, -short of a regular blockade, “ which would “ necessitate more ships than are ever likely to be “ authorised for the purpose.” They have advocated the adoption of a system of Customs-police super vision on land and the bringing to justice of British firms shipping arms to Jibuti, “ which they “ must* know are being used against our authority “ in those parts, and in contravention of the “ Brussels Convention.” S. 39. EThe naval difficulties are: the great extent of coast to be watched (to do this effectively Admiral Willes estimated that nine vessels would be required, six for patrolling and three for reliefs); the readiness with which, in the last resort, arms can be thrown overboard, and the fact that when once a cargo of arms has been run “ it is the “ simplest thing in the world to hide them, so that “ search by landing parties is fruitless.” In many respects, too, men-of-war (besides being expensive) are unsuited for chasing light boats drawing little water. Moreover, naval action is contined to the territorial waters; to enable His Majesty’s ships to exercise the right of search on the high seas, legislation in respect of British ships and treaties with the Foreign Powers concerned would be required. (The Sultan of Muscat has already given the requisite authority to both British and Italian men-of-war to search Muscat vessels on the high seas, as well as within the territorial waters.)

The extension of the system of employing armed dhows seems to promise better results; those equipped by the Somali Coast authorities as revenue cutters are said to be patrolling some 240 miles of coast. The Italian Government employ similar craft on the coast of their Protectorate. The only seizure in Aden waters which has been reported was effected by an armed dhow from the “ Perseus.” At one time or another patrolling by armed dhows has been advocated by the naval authorities, the Viceroy and the Besident, who says, in his letter of 25th May 1902, “ apparently the only way of capturing dhows is to employ dhows.” Armed Dhows.

Pera, March 22, 1911. — ~ 7 ’ I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch No. 5, Africa, of the 14th March, 1911, requesting my opinion as to whether it is advisable to iosist on the procedure adopted in 1904, viz., that arms should only be confiscated after they were actually landed in Yemen from sambouks. My French colleague informs me that after his Government had agreed recently to the French samhouks being seized on condition that they be conveyed to ports, e.g., Hodeidah and Jeddah, where French consular representatives resided, and be adjudicated upon in the presence of such French consular officer, the Ottoman Government requested that these conditions might be waived as an exceptional measure, alleging as a reason for this request that the measures taken by the Ottoman gun-boats to prevent arms running would be defeated if a gun-boat were obliged to convey every sambouk seized to Hodeidah or Jeddah and there await the decision in the case. The French charge d’affaires here informed Rif'aat Pasha in reply that his Government had already made a considerable concession in the matter, and that it was unlikely that they would yield further. The Turks thus appear to regard the French concession as illusory in practice. On the whole, I would consider it only prudent to adhere to the procedure oi 1 .JUl mainly on the ground that inexperienced Turkish naval officers, if given the right to seize sambouks flying foreign flags, might be inclined to act arbitrarily and thus occasion complicated incidents. If, however, it is considered inexpedient not to concede the right which the French have waived, it would appear indispensable to restrict such right &amp; to Ottoman territorial waters, and make it dependent on British sambouks fieing brought to Hodeidah or Jeddah to be adjudicated on in the presence of a British consular officer It would further seem advisable to make an exception for sambouks or other such sailing craft that may have been obliged to put into a port of the Ottoman coast where no customs exist, owing to stress of weather, damage, &amp;c.

Sir: - With rofordnce to your aebpatch No* Africa of the kiBth. ultlno (I1095/ll) rubpocWag tho mdaburoB which the Turkish Government desire to take to stop the Import of arms into the Yemen by sea, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith the reply of the minister for Foreign Affairs to the inquiries which I addressed to His £:xcellency as instructed by your despatch above-mentioned. I have t c., (Signed) Francis Berthe* Sir Edward Grey, Bart., M.P.,Translation. (12921) t In the month of February last the Ottoman Government notified, through their respective Ambassadors, to the Italian Government and, a little later, to the Governments of the French Republic mi of His Britannic Majesty that, with a view to putting the Authorities of the Yemen in a position to exercise effective supervision ovex that coast, they had given them instructions to consider foreign vessels touching at places at which no customs officials were posted as employed in smuggling and to proceed to visit the vessel and to confiscate any prohibited articles which might be found on board. In the view of the Italian Government the demands of the Sublime Porte cannot be accepted for three reasons 1. The principle of the immunity of the flag is universally recognised in the international practice of all European Powers. In regard to Turkey, this principle is expressly ctioned by Article 7 of the Treaty of Adrianople, 1829 : which extends to all States enjoying the benefits of ti»e st favoured nation clause and which has been expresslymaintained in force by the Russo-Turkish Treaty cl Commerce of Balta Liman of 18tV30th April, 1846 and by implication in the succeeding Treaty of 1861. Article 5 in fact states that:- 'Les navires russes ne seront sousds a aucune visits de la part des autorites ottomanes, ni en mer fibre, ni dans Jes ports et rades de 1 1 Kiapire Ottoman'. i It is hardly necessary to add that the right of access to and visit of foreign ships has been repeatedly claimed by the Sublime Porte and has always been decisively nega tived by foreign Governments. Indeed the Ottoman Customs Regulation of 1802 - which authorised Customs Officials to visit foreign ships after notice had been given to the Consul of the Power concerned - has not been accepted by the Powers, in spite of the communi cation made to them, find in its place the missions accepted the Customs Regulation of IBob, which Dears no trace of any such provision. Turkey cannot invoke the application of the General act of Brussels of 1890 (of which she is a signatory) - in bo far as the ri^it of visit is concerned -since the exercise of this right is subject to the existence of specialspecial Conventions (Articles 42 and 45) which do not exist in so far as Italy is concerned: and in any case the condi tions of the signature of that Act could not have conferred upon Turkey rights greater or different from those recog nised under tine Capitulations. The right of visit in territorial waters cannot be invoked since Article 42 expressly maintains the pre existing state of things: that is to say that the juridi cal condition of foreign ships in Ottoman Territorial waters remains the same as before, in spite of the Act. (?,Le present article n'implique aucun changement a Tetat de choses actuei en ce qui coneerne le juridiction dans les eaux territoriales!) neither can there bt any limitation of the right of immunity for the flag through the acceptance, on the part of the Powers, of the Law of the 10th June, 1697 (7 Sefer 1204) which permits the Ottoman Authorities to have access to the domicile of forei$iers when it is situated at a dis tance of nine hours march from the nearest Consular Author!- ty. Such a provision is in no way applicable to fcrei^i ships, since from the Protocol annexed to the Law it is inferredinferred that it can only be applied to the effective domi cile of foreigiere, who by the game Law were granted the ri/dit of acquiring real property in the Ottoman Empire. The origin of the immunity of ships is to be found in the general principle of the inviolability of the domicile, so that the Law of 7 Sefer does not apply, even by analogy, to the present case: the exception whicii was then made referred solely to the necessity of the immediate repres sion of certain specified grave crimes, among which smuggling can certainly not be classed. 2. Without any prejudice to the question of princi- I pie specified above, the Government of His majesty observe that the contention that a ship touching at a place where there is no Customs Authority gives rise to the presumption that she is engaged in smuggling is one which should be examined, togetner with any other indications of a like nature, before a Court ol Lawj it- could never be consi dered as an element of proof as is claimed by the Ottoman Government. Moreover,the order given by the bublime Porte to consider as employed in smuggling any foreign vessel touching at a port at which no Customs Oiiici&amp;ls are posted &gt; !1£ besides being contrary to every principle of right and justice, is in open contradiction with the principle laid down in Treaties of Connerce now in force, which are appli cable to all States in virtue of 'capitulary solidarity'. Article 18 of the Italian-Turkish Treaty of July 10th, 1861 prescribes indeed that no goods can be confiscated as contraband until this has been proved legally and beyond all doubt. This is confirmed in the Customs Regulation of 1865 which - in view of the failure to accept that of 1892 - is the only one recognised by the Powers. a 3. The orders given by the Sublime Porte to the Vilayet of the Yemen in 1904 and 1905 arose out of tnis situation of right in regard to the relations of Turkey towards foreign vessels navigating in the Red Sea. These orders were founded on the law and absolutely prohibited the arrest of foreign dhows, either on the high seax or in terri torial waters, and admitted the intervention of the local s Seizure. authorities for the purpose of sequestration only in the case of a dhow which, having disembarked smug led goods or goods otherwise forbidden, was rreparing to escape. TheseThese orders, communicated by the local authorities to His Majesty’s Consulate-General at Hodeidah, established a PQfiition of fact (state di fatto): On the one hand they constitute a rule of conduct imposed by the proper authori ties on their eubordinates, and on the other they constitute a real and suitable M ruie of objective right” in favour of foreign ships and persons: and it behoves foreign Govern ments, in accordance with a general principle of right, to It is therefore evident that the Regulation which the Ottoman Government has now made simply in the form of orders to the authorities of the Vilayet or the Yemen is contrary to right and to the conventions in force: provi sions of a general order on the same lines were, it is true inserted in the Customs Regulations of November 24th, 1892, but the fact remains that these Regulations were not accepted by the foreign missions. It is on the basis of the considerations set forth above that the Government of His Majesty propose to reply to the Sublime Porte, declaring that the demands recently formu lated by the latter are inadmissible. demand the observance of this rule. The* ' t The Government of His majesty admit that they may be in a position to co-operate to a very considerable extent with Turkey in preventing the contraband traffic in arms along the Yenen coast, either in virtue of the existing agreements between Italy, England and France, or by the exercise of supervision’by means of warships over their om native merchant vessels. Another special - if tempor ary - method would be the issue of instructions to local authorities, in so far as they are competent in the matter, not to issue certificates to dhows unless bound for ports at which a customs official is posted: this could be enforced for the duration of the present -political condi tions in the Arabian Peninsula. But while admitting all this, the Government of Hi majesty consider that they can in no way compromise on the question of principle, which, no doubt, resolves itself into a question or prestige: it should be maintainwd in all its integrity, both in order to uphold the common interests and reciprocal agreements concerning the Red Sea between Italy and England and in order to prevent certain causes and opportunities of abuse, which would in turn leadlead to grave incidents. The Government of His Majesty therefore trust most sincerely that the Government of Hie Britannic : ajeety will agree to this view and will be disposed in a high and common interest, to address to the Ottoman Government a reply inspired by the sane considerations.

J could guarantee to lessen gun-running on the south coast of Arabia from Kurna Murna to Perim and from there inland, thus preventing assistance to Arabs against Turks if a cruiser was stationed here. The Proserpine is for blockading Somali coast.” Bombay Government consider it impossible to prevent gun-running without cruiser to patrol Arabian coast. Resident has not answered question put by Foreign Office— see your te egram of 22nd bebruary—and I am asking Bomba} 7 Government to expedite reply. I fear that it is impossible to do more than we are doing at present to stop arms traffic unless cruiser can be provided for the purpose.Foreign Office, 16 Reference to previous letter: - &lt;6 tU (Similar letter sent to :/The Turkish tebttssador at.
