To f he ■ Foreign Jeoratt.ry to tue Guveroment of Inaia, Foreign and Political DepHrtaentf Hew Delhi. r yd I ho¥e the honour toy invite a refuranoe to ir. 4oh®son*s letter Ho. F.lo4-M/29, dated 18th June 1929, regarding the retention of the servioes of r. C.de rjrenter, Director of Customs, Bahrain. It was therein stated that the Jroverniaent of inula proposed to await the .eaidenC'a views on the t.oneral question of the •westernisation* of Bahrain before deciding on the partiovlar question of the retention ol Mr. de Grenier's services. These views have since been ooffittunicHted to the jovermaent of India hy my pre* / -decessor, and they in turn have coauaunlcated their vie%s to H.I *3. Secretary of Jtate (vide telegram K.3. 3458- I, dated Mth November 1929). Mr de Grenior proposes to proceed on leave in pni next, ana is naturally anxious to know whether tie is to return or not. I would therefore request that the oovermaent oi India nay be plausoa to pass ord or s in the matter.2., In this oonneotion I i»auXd vantur© to put ue- -fore the Covernaent of India the impressions that I gained during my recent visits to .Bahrain, The present .Ruler is ;3hai,kh Hamad; he is entirely devoid, of energy and has no desire to govern: he himself is glad to leave everything to the Adviser, and has to It * « ' ' . ' * J ;&gt; * oe pressed to give a decision on any matter. Ee retires on every possible occasion to his oountry seat 10 miles from the town in order to avoid petitioners and State worries, and it is at least doyotful whether, tod the succession been allowed to take its course without any intervention on our part, he would.not have ocen ousted o&gt; his more forceful hrother Aoduilah, Ead the latter succeeded things would profcaDly have ' seen different out as it is we have to make the best of things as they are. The only- question that , really interests haikh .iamad is the allowances of himself and his family, and the A1 Khalifa family have not abandoned the former idea that the taxes paid by the inhabitants are the just la of the ailing Family. Ti rhe revenues of tiahrain amount to about 10 lakhs, and of this bQ% is paid to the Shaikh and his • relativess he has made constant efforts to get this ©uia of 5 lakhs increased but both Oolonel Barrett and ' 1 have informed him that we consider it ample, and have refused to agree to any increase. -i ,■/ n the other hand Bahrain h s practically only one source of income, the customs, which collect .9?S otthe total revenue. If the lusasuie or control which is at present exercised by uropaans in Bahrain was sensibly relaxed I tniHk there is very little doubt but th t the revenues would be appreciably diminished.and allowances of the Kuling amlly appreciably in- -creased, and tbe result would be, If not inmedlate educational, jiiedical and sanitary developments that we have brought ahout, and which the people or Bahrain now training, as I did, in the Baluchistan school could he otherwise, but we must take account of the actual olr- -cuaist- ncos. • 0 have a ruler who, practically speak- I ing, refuses to rule, and there are no 3tate suhj octs at present sufficiently educated to fill tno maro important posts#. b. It may he asked why we should not allow Bahrain to bo run as, for instance Kuwait is, as an ■rah city on urah lines. the answer is that the population of the two cities is wholly dissimilar. The population of Kuweit is largely Bedouins bheir outlook is towards and of the desert. The people who come and shop there are the dasert Ara'bs of the interior. Kuwait commanded till recently the picK of the i,. edouin tribes, the ■,jman and lutalr, and. all tueii ww&amp;lth '-nd trade came from traffic with the interior and from their flocks ana herds. Finally Kuwait has a homo- -geneous population. 3. ' he population of Bahrain is he^rogeneous and divided hy racial and religious differences ~— ojdis^ a hah Is t lersians, ;.unnis, &lt; hi a lis end large colonies oi 1 ohammeaan and Hindu Indians. Bahrain is a purely coamarcial centre, its outlook is towards aomhay and the stock markets of the world on which it depenas to sell its pearls. The people who come and shop insolvency, at any rate a complete cessation of those therethere? are largely tfc® wealthy pearl mere bants of a aria ana bo©bay. It bee no tribes worth jaentioning,and- an enervating ana relaxing climate widob shows itself in the Arabs ifeo have settlwi there. Its wealth aomes fro© its pearls aliaost entirely: it may perhaps be increased shortly by the discovery of oil. 7, Kow with a population such as this, many of whose members are extremely wealthy, ana which is 'bronght In closer contact with the outside world than the population of any other place in the -ulf, it is not unnatural to find a strong desire for decent aomin- e -istration ami xor the amenities which they obtain a elsewhere. as was stated in your telegram referred m to above, what we have done is good in itself. • e have not foisted upon an unwilling people measures which they did not want or a horde of low paid officialj i neither have we introduced vexatious rules or rogulat- -ions. we have improved the lot of the diver and largely rescued hi® from virtual slavery; we U.ve established simple courts %iiere cases ^.re expeditiously settled, not on legal technicalities but on aiving or coHimercial practice understood by all or according to the religious percepts of the parties concerned; we have enabled the Atate out of its own resouiees to liiake one or two good roads, to insi-al else trie, lights, imd to maK.e at any rate some small beginning with eaucation. Finally, and to this attach much importanoe, there are now in Bahrain two munioipalit- -ies whicu do good work. • Iheir resolutions are at times ludicrous, as for instance when they wished to decree that ladies must wearier tain types of garments, 'but on the whole their work is satisfactory and. .t any rate the members aro gaining some experience oi local self -government, which it is to be ho pod will in - ... enable them to oe of service in a wilier' ^ s ' 5 ■ . § B. Bahrain has 3 JSuropaan orficials, an j i .viser, or Diwan as lie would 'be oallad in Inula, a BvpGrin%en&lt;L~ -ant 01 Polio® and a Director of Customs, and I must say that 1 think thm itat8 is eztremoly fortunate in the Europeans wliose services it bas socurou. ;,r. Beigrav© is keen and tactful; lias had previous a.iparian* -co of Arabs in the Jolonial ;»ervio® and speaks the language wall and is a obamiag and oulturea man to meet in himselft he struck me as being th© best stamp of British official and Just the man that is required, Mr« 1 ark© I did not meet,as he is at home on leave, hut the Political Agent spoke highly of hicu r. de virenier, though of a dilferant type to ir. Bslgrava, is full of enthusiasm about the somewhat humdrum funot- -ions he is called upon to perform, and Colonel Barrett thought highly of him, as reported to the Government of India in his despatch R'o. 1 i4- dated Ist June i929, 9. There is really no analogy heti'een Bahrain and an Indian State. The latter can obtain as many fully trained Indian oifioi Is as they require, yet despite this an increasing numbor of them nowadays employ Europeans in different capacities: Bahrain can not obtain lahi'ainis or Arabs Qualified, to ho la the higher posts. yrians and Egyptians are just as much foreigners as an englishman is. 10, I therefore see no likelihood of the .Hate being ahle to dispense with Mr, Belgrava's services within any pxar period tli'^t need at present 'be taken into account. Again, as pointed out by the Gov am-' -ment of India, the necessity for a European iuperi ntend -ent of lolice largely depends on whether the threatened influx of (mme&amp;v&amp;k oil-borer» materi Uses or not. If it does then the prosonce of a European to ueal wich tht uetlogensous elements that Villi 1 'lock to luo oil fields will certainly be necessary. it is not possible to COM©c ois &amp; to a deoisloB .-it present. 1 r larks ia at prQa- -ent on l@ava and una era tana a ill return for a year or two, 'but it Is iaprolsaMa that he will 'be willing to aji stay on after this. • The question whether he should he replaced hy another lurojjoon or not will he considered, then. ii. Mr. 3 el grave apoice to ae ah ^ut the replace- •aent of the ndian police hy oudaneae, and I think it would be a good thing. There la a larg® negro element in Bahrain, and they would merge in the population more than Indians do. Mr. Bel grave has had previous experience of them in Sgypt and says that they make eff latent police. Re suggested to me that when he proceeded on leave in tSJti. 1931 he should recruit them on his way out and bring them hack with him. I think this arr .ngement would he satisfactory, and Bight he given effect to irrespective of the arrival or nan- -arrival of the oil company, and I trust the overnaent of India will he pleased, to approve of it. . 12. Finally, as pointed out by don el .Barrett, Ir. de arenter's functions are purely administrative, and not political: he has no hand in any matter that affects the daily lives of the people, and owing to the fact that the Bahrain revenue consists almost £R£ijc3el|E exclusively of the custom© reoetpts, any fall -tng off under this head is a much more serious matter than would he a decrease under one head in a more normal budget. -its dealings are almost exclusively with the commercial classes, shipping oompantes etc. and not with the mass of the people. As col on @1 jsai x ©tt asked, why replace a foreigner who has proved his efficiency by a less efficient foreigner, whioh Is what the replacement of Ir. de Grenier by an Egyptian, Syrian or Iraki would mean. I may mention that iHBB Mr.Mr# Q© Gi oalar is on an incieilnl'ts contract tersilnaole by 3 monn^notice on either so there will he I cii1iculty in di^pQDsing with his services should this at any time toe considered desiratole. xo. To sun up, 1 do not think it will toe jossitole to dispense with the services of Mr. Belgrave within any tine that neeu toe taken into consideration at present. As regards the police, Br# i ; arke will protontoly resign in a year ur two, and the question of his successor can toe taken up then: it depends to a great extent on.whether oil is found in Bahrain or not. ^eanwlii 1 e howevex 1 recoi^send that steps should toe taken to replace the Indian police by Joudanese next year, and request the approval of the Government of India to this* As regards the austerns, I stxX would suggest that 1 toe authorised to inform the shaikh that there is no objection to the retention of 4'r. d® Qrenier, 14, Since drafting the above 1 have been infomed by Minister at Tehran th vt the Govemneot of India haw? agreed in principle to the transi er of the ..teaidenoy to the Arato side subject to certain conu.it- -ions which are at present under oonsiuBration in England. It seems not laprotoatole that the residency will toe transferred to Bahrain: if so ttien it will, I think, be of little avail to try and arrest the tendency towards ♦westernisation'. If the 1 oiltical .esiuent is to be permanently located at ahiain, then the authority of the ohaikh must automatically tend to deciease, and it will naturally toe regarded as almost tantamount to the declaration of a definite protect or nate over these islands, even though no formal announce -mant to that effect is maae, I have the honour to toe.
