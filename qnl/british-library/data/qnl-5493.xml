With reference to your letter No. Ext. 5354/46 dated the 21st August 1946 regarding the service on the Bahrain Branch of the Eastern Bank of an attachment Order issued by an Egyptian Court, I have the honour to state that the facts of the case are as follows. 2. On the 27th February 1944 Flight-Lieutenant N.O. Clements offences and removed from Bahrain to Iraq for trial by a Court Martial. The Air Liaison Officer, Bahrain requested the Political Agent, Bahrain to issue instructions to the Eastern Bank Limited, Bahrain to immobilise such moneys as might be lodged to the credit of Flight-Lieutenant Clements in the Eastern Bank until the findings of the Court Martial had been promulgated. This was done on the 2nd of March 1944. After some time one Leon Setton of Cairo lodged a claim against Flight-Lieutenant Clements in the Mixed Courts, Cairo. Flight- Lieutenant Clements was killed on active service on the 5th December 1944 and the Air Liaison Officer, Bahrain informed the Political Agent, Bahrain in January 1945 that the Royal Air Force had no interest in this case and consequently the freezing order passed by the Political Agent, Bahrain on the 2nd March 1944 was cancelled. was arrested by the Royal Air -Force for alleged financial In His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, India Office, LONDON.1 )0O i process^..^s received from the Egyptian Mixed Courts through His Majesty’s Ambassador, Cairo for service on the Eastern Bank Limited, Bahrain, but it was returned as no arrangements existed for the service of Egyptian civil processes by the Bahrain Courts. The legal heirs of the deceased claimed the money standing to the credit of the deceased and forwarded a certified copy of the deceased's Will. After meeting all the claims against the estate the Eastern Bank was authorised by the Political Agent, Bahrain to transfer the balance to the credit of the deceased's account with the Bank here to a Bank in South Africa and transfer was effected accordingly. 3. In the circumstances I would enquire whether it is still considered necessary for me to hand over the attachment Order to the Bahrain Branch of the Eastern Bank as proposed in your letter under reference. I would add that in October 1944 the Bank received a telegram from Mr. Leon Setton's lawyer informing them that amounts standing to Flight-Lieutenant Clements’s credit should not be disposed of without further notice from the Mixed Courts Cairo and that on their making a reference to the Political Agent, Bahrain they were told that the Mixed Courts had no power to instruct them to retain the funds in question. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant,© iixt.5354A 6 Z! August, 1 %.&amp;. Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State for Indio to for ard Herewith, a conv of a letter dated duly fro 1 ^ of a letter dated 30th July the Foreign Office, with enclosures, regarding the service on the Bahrein Branch of the Kaatern Bank, attachment Order issued by Ltd., of an iigyptian Court on the application of Lear Settar in respect of values deposited Aith the Bank by Neville 0. Clements, deceased. 2. The Secretary of State understands that there is no provision in Bahrein analogous to thnt made in British India, by notification under oect .29 of the Civil procedure Code, for the service of suwi.onses and other processes issued by ;&gt;gyptian Mixed Courts. rfe also appreciates that the mere knov/ledge erf* the existence ox such an Oxder, though not binding on the Bank, mi$it cause the latter some embarrassment if their custom er demanded payment of the amount standing to his credit. The Secretary of State would, notwithstanding, be glad, provided that on reconsideration you see no strong objection, if you would hand over the document in quest ion to the Bank. You should not, however, nor would you in fact be so entitled, press ar$y formal acknowledgsaent, if such is required by the for Egyptian Court. t.

Foreign Office. II V-flllGC, London, S.W.l. I am directed by Mr. Secretary Bevin to transmit herewith to be laid before the Secretary of State for India copies of two despatches from His Majesty*s Ambassador at Cairo relative to the service on the Bahrein Branch of the Eastern Bank Limited of an attachment Order issued by the Egyptian Court on the application of Lear Settar in respect of values deposited with the Bank by Neville 0. Clements, deceased• 2. Mr. Bevin is aware that there is no power under the law of Bahrein to execute the Order of the Egyptian Court, and he is advised that it would be necessary for the successful plaintiff to start proceedings in Bahrein upon his judgment if he is to levy execution on the values in question. Unless, however, Lord Pethick Lawrence sees any objection, he would be glad if the Political Resident at Bahrein could be asked to cause the documents to be ^ served on the Bank in order that the latter may be aware era* the existence of the Attachment Order. It would be understood that in the absence of an Order by the Bahrein Court on proceedings instituted there by the plaintiff, the Bank would be under no obligation to give effect to the Order of the Egyptian Court or liability for failing to do so. I am. 9BRITISH EMBASSY CAIRO BCF/PSR N0.422 25th March 1946 (503/33/46) Sir I have the honour to report that i February last at the request of the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs copies of a judicial document issued by the Ministry of Justice for service on the Eastern Bank Limited at its branch office at Bahrein, were sent to the Political Resident, Bushire, with a request that the com petent authorities should serve the documents on the defendants. The Political Resident replied that he was unable to carry out this request as there is no provision of law or treaty applicable to Bahrein under which the courts there are empowered to effect service of documents issued by Egyptian courts. 2. The Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs were informed of the decision of the Political Resident and they have now requested in their Note, a copy of which is attached, that the Political Resident should be asked to reconsider his decision. 3. It seems difficult to believe that there is no method by which the service of this document could be effected, and before finally replying to the Egyptian Government I have the honour to request that the question may be taken up again with the Political Resident at Bahrein through the competent authorities in the United Kingdom. The documents in question are enclosed herein. I have the honour to be with the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, (Sgd.)
