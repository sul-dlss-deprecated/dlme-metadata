It was only with greatest difficulty when the Political Resident and I visited Masirah recently that I got coolies who had struck work to agree to continue on Kemp’s assurance that work would be finished by end of month. Now that it is apparently intended to keep coolies indefinitely it will be necessary to discuss with Sultan’s Representative and discover rate of pay which will attract volunteers. The date harvest is coming on and local people prefer assisting that to coolie labour. Fresh coolies will then have to be engaged and sent to Masirah to relieve those unwilling to remain even on new terms. I will proceed with this and wire result, I am rather unfit for travel at present due to the excessive heat but in any case visit to Masirah would prove fruitless as coolies are determined to le ave. 3.

I am therefore explaining the matter in this letter and will be grateful for your assistance. I have received a telegram from Masirah saying that all the 400 coolies there have stopped work and refused to continue again. They say that it is very hot and they are in bad health and wish to return to Muscat immediately. .vhen Colonel Hay and I stopped at Masirah recently 200 coolies had already stopped work and it was only with great difficulty that I was able to get them to agree to stay on and work for a few more days. Now this is their final word and I do not think that any further visits to Masirah and talk with the coolies will be fruitful. It seems to me that it will be necessary to engage 400 fresh coolies in Muscat and bring the others back. As the date season is now beginning I doubt if any one would be willing to go to Masirah on the pay at present fixed, i.e. $ 15/- per mensem plus food. I will be most grateful if ycu could kindly see what rate of pay ^ JtD Ctfmb {jp L&gt;»— 41coon mini, Telegram From To No, Dated Date reed. T E L E G R A .1/1 &lt; N.S.C.
