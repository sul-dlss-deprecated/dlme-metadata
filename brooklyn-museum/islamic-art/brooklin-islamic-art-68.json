The carpet fragment is from a carpet that consisted of pieces from two or more wool pile carpets that at some point prior to acquisition had been sewn together to make a large rectangular carpet.  The carpet was later disassembled into eight separate fragments. \r\n \r\nThe following is description of the carpet in its assemble state (description is taken from the accession sheet):  \"All the fragments have white cotton wefts and warps and have Sehna knots.  Across the top is a thin strip of rug with a floral vine and cloud design in yellow, pink, red, orange, white and light blue on a dark blue ground.  Below this is a broad band from a compartment rug, running the width of the frame.  In the center, bordered on each side with four unconnected strips from the same compartment rug described above, across the bottom, and with the design lying on its side, is a broad strip with a design of birds on flowered trees and among cloud bands in much the same colors as those of the central panel, but on a white ground.  The upper border has been filled out with several odd pieces.  The central section has been stained brown in a number of places.\"\r\n", "medium": "Wool and silk pile, asymmetrical knot", "dimensions": "39 3/8 x 26 in.
