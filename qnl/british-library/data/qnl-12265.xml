The enclosed letter relates to financial claims being made against Muhammad Ismail Khan, son of the deceased Persian Envoy Haji Khalil Khan, to the sum of 27,886 Tomans. Of this total, William Bruce was guarantor of 18,886 Tomans. The letter states that Khan fled to Europe, presumably to escape his debts. Hassun states that he hoped to meet with Khan in England, but that Khan chose to remain in Bordeaux.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024100364.0x000015#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
