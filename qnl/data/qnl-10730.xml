Specifically, the correspondence concerns hostilities between the forces of Ibn Sa'ud and the Ikhwan during the rebellion led by Faisal al-Duwaish [Faysal al-Duwaysh], the movement of Ikhwan members and their followers into Kuwaiti territory, tensions between Ibn Sa'ud and Kuwait, and reports of support for the rebellion coming from the Government of Iraq.Much of the correspondence in the file is between British officials at the Political Agency in Kuwait, the Political Residency in Bushire and the High Commission in Iraq, but the file also contains copies of letters, in Arabic with English translations, from Ibn Sa'ud (including a letter of condolence after the death of Sir Gilbert Clayton, folios 138-141) and Fuad Bey Hamza, a diplomatic representative of Ibn Sa'ud's.In addition to correspondence, the file also contains a number of accounts of the Battle of Injayr (also spelt Inqayr) that took place on 5 October 1929 (folios 83-7 &amp; 96-100) and a hand-drawn sketch map of the events of the battle (folio 88).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Battle of Injayr (1929)</topic></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Fayṣal bin Sulṭān al-Dawīsh</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Iraq</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Ikhwan revolt (1927-1930)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0003bc#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0003bc#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0003bc#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
