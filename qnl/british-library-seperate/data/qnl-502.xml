Reference is made to a court case in Karachi, in which witness testimonies reveal the extent of the slave trade across the Gulf of Oman (folios 107-108), and the numbers of slaves on the Trucial Coast, with up to 1,500 claimed to be in Dubai.The volume broadens in scope, reflecting the British Government’s concerns about the extent of the slave trade from Persia/Baluchistan. There are detailed reports made in 1929 on the extent and nature of slavery in the Gulf region, specifically in Kuwait (folios 198-204, 215-216), Qatar (folios 220-223), the Trucial States (folios 208-209), and Muscat (folios 242-260). The last of these reports is compiled by Bertram Thomas, then Wazir [Finance Minister] for the State of Muscat, and focuses on the slave trade in the Al-Batinah region of Oman. The report includes a detailed account of slavery and the pearl diving industry, maps of slave trade routes across the Gulf of Oman and on the Al-Batinah coast, and the names of known slave dealers in the region.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">ArchivalFile</genre><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Baluchistan</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Trucial Coast</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Zellaq</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Reports</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0000ca#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0000ca#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0000ca#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0000ca#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
