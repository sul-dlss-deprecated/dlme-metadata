Sir, With reference to our representative's interview to-day with one of your officials, we beg to forward, as requested, copies of all correspondence relative to the acquisition by the firm of 2 sites at Busreh. ihe position is that on January 4th last an agree ment was arrived at with a certain G.A. Asfar for the sale by him to the firm of 2 houses: Beit Asfar and Beit Muir, together with land and the erections thereon. Such an agreement is suoject to the sanction of the local Political Officer being granted thereto. It will be noted from the copy of letter marked ,, A H , that owing to the Turkish laws in force there it is absolutely unsafe to make any payment on account. The agreement can only be made binding when the vendor actually completes by making over the title-deeds to the buyer. Nothing further can therefore apparently be done until the Political Officer grants his consent. The Under Secretary of State, India Office. From the non-enclosure of c rs from that2... a. w. &amp; go., to...T^.e, UnAer..Se.cre.tary.. o.f..State., 2nd . May.,. ,1919. that official, it would appear that he has refrained from putting anything in writing, but adopts an attitude of 'non passumus', presumably consequent on the occupation of these 2 sites by the Military Autnorities. In this connection the statement made to-day that the adraini strati on is. gradually being transferred from the Military to the Civil Authorities is therefore gladly noted as, judging from information conveyed in the public press, the military occupation in Mesopotamia is likely to be a prolonged one, whilst, on the other hand, it is undeniable that Great Britain’s main interest now is to increase her export trade. Hot foreseeing the present impasse many agencies have already been secured, and even staff engaged to cope with the extended business, but for lack of premises the firm is still debarred from expanding We therefore crave your assistance in this matter, and would appreciate any suggestion which may be made regarding further action possible on our part tending to a successful issue of our endeavour to further British trade. We are, Sir, Your Ihe Under Secretary of State, India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l.

Another suggestion was that Beit Asfar and part of the seef on the front should not be included in sale c:c. &amp;c. , and all this is rendering matters difficult for us, as we understand that the Turkish Law permits of an owner changing his mind and conditions ad lib. until the deeds are a,c tucillv in the buyer* s name, We are, however, seeing the Political Officer on th exmat ter, and he may be able to tell us exactly how we stand, in a recent case before the Court a Prop erty had oeen sold for £10,000/- and an advance of £2000/- was, at £ie time, paid, but about six months afterwards and before transfe of deeds was completed, the seller received and accepted another ofier of £20,000/-. His action was upheld by the Court and a decision was given against the previous buyer. Therefore, we need to go cautiously with Asfar until we know our position, otherwise he may witndraw his oxier altogether.OPY. ANDREW WEIR &amp; CO. -BDSKEH. 20til March 1919. Messrs Andrew Weir &amp; Co., London, Dear Sirs, PRO PER T Y , Tne enclosed copy of letters spealc for themselves and we will later write you further thereanent. Yours faithfully,IS - True Copy of letter received from Mr.G.A.Asfar regarding Property, dated 15tn March, 1919. Messrs. Andrew Weir &amp; Co., B a s rah. Dear Sirs, I am in receipt of your letter of the 14th inst, I am afraid you have given a wrong construction to tne meaning of ray letter of the 12th inst. In writing you as I did, my intention was not exactly to cancel the agreement, although there was sufficient ground for you to believe so, but you should have noticed from the second paragraph of my letter, that I gave you sufficient chance to have the property when circumstances permitted me to dispose of same, provided you satisfied me on certain points. I will, repeat, however, that in view of uncertain events it would have been unbusinesslike on my part to leave the offer upon indefinitely, and if you place yourselves in my position you will find my attitude quite legitimate. That the sale cannot be concluded at present is suffice iently clear from the Political Officer’s letters to you of 21st •Jan., and 5th February ? 19, I am afraid you cannot force me to admit that I knew that delay was bound to occur, I certainly knew that Govt., sanction was essential, but this is not the same thing, have and I would/certainly preferred another tone in your letter to explain me this, Now, coming to the practical side of the business, I do not see that very great differences separate us in the ultimate- 2 - issue of the transaction, so long as you have my assurance that the property will be yours if you only satisfied me on certain points, which, after all,- are not so vital to you. These points ' are ’ a PP ar ently, those concerning the retention of the house for ' t four years and the seven yards passage, with probably certain modifications in the limits. I am sure that if you will represent the matter to your Principals in the spirit put down by me, they will slot 1)6 reluctant to please me. Believe me, Yours truly, (Sgd) G. A. Asfar.12tn Maron, 1919, Messrs. Andrew•Weir &amp; Co., Buereh. Dear sirs, re Sara of Beit aefar and Beit Muir, With reference to my letter to you of 2oth Dec^*18 and your reply of 4th Jan, 19, on the above subject, I now find it necessary to point out, that, in view of the fact that Govern ment do not authorize the sale of the properties in question, the offer made by me and accepted by you is no longer binding on either party. It is conclusive that when the offer was made by me, it was to be put into effect within a reasonable delay, but now that foreign circumstances deprive us of the liberty of concluding the transaction, it is only natural that I cannot leave the offer open indefinitely. If, however, it will be permissible to me, later on, to dispose of my property, I shall favourable consider the sale of same to you on terms to be suggested by me at that opportunity, and in the meantime I wish you to have the assurance that you will have the first negotiation on the sale df the property in the case of an otter being made to by another party, I remain, Yours truly, (Sgd.) G. A. Asfar,- 0 P Y Ai*DR b;/ weir &amp; CO. 2SSS1 Busreh, 14th March, 19X9. G. H. ASrar &amp; Co., B U S R S H . Dear Sir, 77e are in receipt of your letter dated I2tn instant, and regret to see that you should ^ish to now cancel the ment re sale of Beit Asfar &amp;c. £cc,, under the plea that 'Govern ment do not authorize the sale of the properties in question.” We, however, have received no such intimation, but on the other hand we have been assured that the matter is receiving attention, and that wewill later be advised whether we have their f sanction to acquire the property. You were well aware when making us the offer that such sanction was essential, and the consequent delay, due to the War offers you no opportunity, nor entitles you to impose fresh con ditions, or to withdraw from the agreement. .Further, Government. having decreed that the matter must remain in abeyance in the mean time, you and we have no option but to wait for their decision. However,' we are advising our Principals by letter this latest development, and, in the meanwhile, we must hold you to existing agreement. We may add that your previous request to retain full use of the house for four years after sale has already been communicated to London. Yours faithfully, AUDHaTw WiSIR h CO. T 'A” AG EH . nlAKDRSV/ WJSIR GO. BUSHEH, 6tn larch, 1919. As far, Referring to your ofrer of the 2oth December and our acceptance of same of the 4th January. We understand, you wish us to submit to London the two following suggestions. . 1. The Exchange of the House, Garden, Stable Sief on which at present Tennis Courts are erected and the Godown for the back hall or trie plot oi ground adjoining Beit Asfar ana £10,000 £. Provided we wish to retain tne totaj. property as originally offered and accepted you would require the use of the House for four years and also retain a strip of land 7 yards wide at the rear of the large sief in order to have access to 3ief on the further side kndwn as Bassama Seif. We think it is useless bo submit the first suggestion as we could not advise them to accept same. We will however put the latter suggestion before them and in the event of London accepting we shall of course have to provide quarters and offices for ourselves and presume you would be quite willing to pay us a reasonable rent for tne use of the house. As to the seven yards this we should recommend London to forego. Yours sincerely.9 9 9 9 EXTRACT OF LETTER NO. 21 DATED 11/1/1919. ' FROM BUSHEH OFFICE. PROPERTY.
