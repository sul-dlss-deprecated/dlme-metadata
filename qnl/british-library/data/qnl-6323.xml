Forwarded to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Delhi, with the compliments of His Britannic Majesty s Aorent and Consul. Jeddah. Letter from His Britannic Majesty’s Agent and Consul, Jeddah, to His Britannic Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, London, No. 116—(3*3), dated the 31th December 1924 (Secret). I have the honour to enclose a report on the situation covering the period November 20th to December 11th. 2. Copies of this despatch and of its enclosure are being sent to India, Egypt, Khartoum (through Port Sudan), Jerusalem, Baghdad, Beirut (for Damascus), Aden, Singapore, Bushire, Koweit and Bahrein. Report for the period November 20th—December 11th, 1924. 1. The Indian newspaper, the Muslim Outlook, has cited the use of the term ‘ 4 Wahabis ” by the English press as an attempt to prejudice the Moslem World against Bin Saud. As several prominent Indian Muham madan nationalists have used the same term in interview reported in the Muslim Outlook the charge need not be taken seriously. Nevertheless it api ears to be true that the followers of Bin Saud object to the name “ Wahabi ”, and that they call themselves Muslims or Ikhwan (brethren) and claim to be plain Hanbalis, i e., members of one of the four orthodox Sunni sects. The common name for them here is Mudaiyinah. This is apparently a corruption of Mutadaiyinah (singular Mutadaiyin) from tadaiyana=to follow the (true) religion. 2. The proposal to bring down foreign subjects (chiefly Javanese) in caravans under escort came to nothing, because the Hedjaz Government have no control outside the defences of Jeddah. The Wahabis hold the road down to Basrah, the half-way halting-place, but fro n there to the Jeddah defences there are tribes which, while nominally under Hedjaz Government control, would probably rob the caravans; and the Hedjas Government cannot provide an escort of “ regular ” troops. Very few foreigners have reached Jeddah since the date of the last report. They were all Javanese. Some of these maintained that the Wahabis had prevented them from reading Maulide—the various lives of the Prophet by which they and indeed most Moslems set great store. 3. The Wahabis followed up the lesson to the Harb by nearly annihilating two small tribes, the Bani Jabir and the Barakit, within ten or fifteen miles of Jeddah. There seems good evidence that 'women and children as well as men were killed. Both tribes had sent to Mecca and declared themselves to be “ Mudaiyinah ”, but they had doubtless given similar assurances of loyalty to Ali and ihe ruthless attack was presumably meant as retribution for double dealing. As a warning the fate of these two tribes has been most effective : it is unlikely that the Wahabis would have anything to fear from the tribes if they advanced on Jeddah. Ali has lost all faith in the promises of tribal sup port, and moreover he has no money or supplies to give the tribes and without that not even promises are to be had. All Badawin have been sent away from Jeddah. This rids the city of a most disorderly and untrustworthy element and moreover helps to relieve the strain on the water supply.2 The Hedjaz Government are therefore dependent upon the so-called regular army, strengthened—or, at least, increased in number—by several hundred volunteers, most of whom are from the mandated territory of Palesline. The health of these volunteers has been bad : a very high proportion have been suffering from dysentery or malaria, or both. Many of them still want to get away, but this Agency is acting on a policy approved by His Majesty’s Government, of refusing to receive applications for release while d&lt; ing what can be done unofficially to secure an improvement in c&lt; nditions. Tahain Pasha professes to believe that he could beat off an army of 20,000 Wahabis, but it is doubtful whether he is serious in this contention. People here, who know the Wahabi methods of fighting, say that Khalid would think nothing of sending two or three hundred camelry to death against the barbed wire if he could thereby effect an entry. It is unlikely that the Hedjaz army would stand once the defences were pierced, even if it waited for that. 4. The P. and 0. S. S. “ Nore ” called at Jeddah on November 22nd and landed three aeroplanes from England for the Hedjaz Government. The first to be assembled proved to be a T). H.-9 with a Siddeley-Puma engine—a war plane but not fitted with a machine gun. The second, also a De Havilland, has a Diesel engine: it is a commercial machine fitted with a cabin to carry two passengers besides the pilot and a mechanic. The third is said to be of the same type as the second. None of the machines is new. The only pilot, the Russian Shirokoff, goes out on a reconnaissance nearly every morning and evening. He always uses the first machine, having smashed the undercarriage of the second on landing after his first flight in it. As he refuses to fly over enemy territory at less than 9,000 or 10,000 feet, and as his observer is a one-eyed officer who always w T ears dark glasses when he goes up, it is not believed that the reports brought back are of great value. Mr. Shirokoff is constantly being pressed by the Army Commander, Tahain Pasha, to drop bombs on supposed enemy concentrations, but has so far refused. There are no aeroplane bombs in the country. Tahain Pasha * wanted Mr. Shirokoff to drop hand grenades, and was with difficulty persuaded that if they didn’t blow the machine to pieces they would burst before reaching the ground. He then proposed that shells should be dropped, and himself made an experiment with two, but neither exploded. He is nevertheless pressing that explosives of some kind should be dropped on Mecca, and he and Mr. Shirokoff seem to persuade the King alternately for and against this policy. It is difficult to see what could be gained by the bombing of Mecca by a non-Moslem airman, whereas the drawbacks, from the point of view r of the Hedjaz Government, are clear: they could hardly provide Bin Saud and his Moslem World with a better cry. It is possible that Mr. Shirokoff may eventually yield to pressure. He receives from the Hedjaz Government, besides a salary of £60 gold a month, a bottle of whisky a day, and as lie supplements this quite inadequate ration by heavy purchases and by drinking at the expense of his admirers, he may one day reach the point of exhilaration.at which the prospect of dropping explosives on Mecca will cease to appear objectionable. There are several British airmen in Suez who appear to have been engaged for service in the Hedjaz. They have undertaken not to proceed to the Hedjaz without the express permission of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. The Resident at Aden reports the arrival there, for some unknowm consignee in Jeddah, of over a million rounds of small-arras ammunition from England. The authorities were greatly disappointed that no rifles or bombs arrived on the “ Nore They have paid about £50,000 to a General Newland, who has a business of some kind in Egypt, to purchase munitions for them in England, and they hoped that at least part of the material would arrive on the “ Nore ”. They have, however, heard through the Arab Agent in Cairo that His Majesty’s Government have refused a license for the export. This they cannot under stand, as the Hedjaz is a signatory of the Arms Traffic Convention of 1919, butthey have probably not read the articles of the Convention, which prescribe elaborate measures for preventing munitions from falling into the hands of people who have no stable government. 5. Bin Saud arrived at Mecca on Friday, December 5th, and all Jeddah i* hoping for a speedy decision of the dispute. The question of the safety of foreign subjects is, it is hoped, finally settled by the latest letters which have been exchanged between Bin Saud and the consular corps in Jeddah. Copies of these letters are attached. The contention implied, in his letter of November 21st, that having once warned us to remove our nationals either to Mecca or to some other specified place he could with impunity kill anyone he found in Jeddah, could not be accepted. His last letter, to which a formal acknowledg ment has been sent, is more reasonable. 6. From Bin Saud's letters to the foreign representatives and to Amin Bihani, Saiyid Talib Pasha and Mr. Philby, three points emerge clearly a) he considers Jeddah essential to Mecca; (2) he still insists that “ the Sharif ” Ali should leave Jeddah ; (3) ' he still maintains that the decision must be left to the Moslem World. What is not known is whether he is prepared to try to seize Jeddah by force if Ali refuses to leave the country, and, above all, who in Bin Saud’s opinion constitute the Moslem World. It is know n that he has been working wdth the Caliphate Committee in India, and, less openly, with Egyptian extremists, and it is therefore not surprising that he should cling so tenaciously to their policy. So far as is known here, how r ever, the only delegates actually appointed to attend the proposed conference at Mecca are five Indians, of whom His Majestys’s Government have found it necessary to state that they are nominees of the Caliphate Committee, and must not be considered as representing Indian Moslem opinion, siill less as having any credentials from His Majesty’s Govern ment or from the Government of India. Java and Malaya appear to be dis inclined to take any active part in the decision, and not even the Egyptians have appointed a delegation. It is true that the President of the Syrian Federation has sent a telegram to Bin Saud applauding his policy, but this is generally regarded as a French rather than a Moslem pronouncement, and has moreover been openly attacked by many Syrians. 7. Of the would-be peacemakers assembled in Jeddah the only one who has much chance of seeing Bin Saud at present is Saiyid Talib Pasha. Even he has been told by Bin Saud that he cannot be allowed to intervene in the Nejd-Uedjaz dispute, but he hopes to go to Mecca in a few days, as an old friend of Bin Saud’s, ard to have an opportunity to discuss the general situa tion. Amin Rihani and Mr. Philby have both been reminded that as non- Mcs’ems they must not interfere in a purely Moslem question. The latest letter to Mr. Philby says that Bin Saud is prepared to meet him, late-, at Bahrah, if he has any purely personal business to discuss ; but Mr. Philby is debarred from going to Bahrah, even for that limited purpose, by the instructions from His Majesty’s Government, which do not permit him to go into the interior. 8. I understand that the Foreign Secretary here has protested to the Acting French Consul very strongly in regard to the telegram sent to Bin Saud by the President of the Syrian Federation, Subhi Bey Barakat. The Hedjaz Government contend, wuth some reason, that the telegram could not have been sent without the approval of the French authorities and that it therefore constitutes a serious breach of neutrality by the French. 9. The Egyptian Bed Crescent Society has sent a unit to Jeddah. They wished to send one to the Wahabis also and they had some difficulty in understanding that this might not be feasible at present. The Jeddah unit was welcomed by the Hedjaz Government w ith open arms and given the whole town to choose a place on which to pitch its tents. At the official opening of the hospital King Ali made a very cordial speech—the sort of speech w r hich, if it had been made by the Ruler of the Hedjaz four or five years ago, might have had some effect on the course of events.4, He thanked His Majesty King Fuad, the people of Egypt and the Red Crescent Society for sending the hospital, and said he hoped that it would maik the beginning of an era of mutual understanding and iriendsMp. 10. A party of about fifteen Japanese, who left Mecca three days after Bin Sand’s arrival, have reached Jeddah. The information they bring was received while the earlier part of this report was being typed. Lhey state that Bin Saud assembles the Ulema every day and that long theological disputes are held. They confirm the stories of interference by the Wahabis in various religious practices and the report that the Wahabis have destroyed the Prophet’s house and the tomb of his wife, Khadijah. 11. The ex-King Hussein is still at Akaba, and he still sends frequent telegrams to his son and to various officials, all signed, as though he were still King, by his “ Head of the Hashimite office”. Two telegrams received from him within a few hours of each other a day or two ago give the key to his character. The Hedjaz S. S, “Tawil ” ran aground near Alaba, and Hussein wired :— (1) Your steamer has sunk. (2) Our steamer has floated off again. B. W. BULLARD, Mis Britannic Majesty's Agent and Consul.

After greetings. —We inform you that we have read the letter dated November Hh which you sent to the generals of our army Khalid ibn Mansur and Sultan ibn Bijad regarding the attitude of your Governments towards the war between Nejd and the Hedjaz. I sincerely desired that an end might be put to bloodshed and that effect might be given to the wishes of the Moslem World which has suffered such trials for eight years. The Sharif Ali bin Hussein, however, by remaining in Jeddah prevents our attaining our sacred aims. Conseq.uently, out of love for the security of your nationals and in order to protect their lives and property from any harm that might happen, we desire to inform you— (1) that you should appoint for your nationals a suitable place either in or outside Jeddah and inform us of its situation so that we may send some of our men to guard and protect them ; (2) that, if you wish, you should send them to Mecca where they would be near the sacred shrine and far from the calamities and perils of war: we would give them a warm welcome and allot them a place suitable for their occupation. We beg you to send to the people of Jeddah our enclosed letter so that they may understand the matter fully. We do not hold ourselves responsible for anything subsequent to this our proclamation.

After greetings. —You are doubtless aware that the greater part of the Moslem World have declared that they do not wish the Hedjaz to be ruled by Hussein and his sons. Now therefore we, desiring to keep the peace and to prevent bloodshed, inform you that you are under the treaty and protection of Allah, both yourselves and your property, if you follow the course adopted by the people of Mecca. As to the presence of the Amir Ali among you and his leaving in accordance with the views of the Moslem World, we advise you to leave the town and to stay in some appointed place or to proceed to Mecca for the protection of your lives and property, or to seize the Sharif AJi bin Hussein and to deport him from your country. If you act otherwise by helping the said (Ali) or adhering to his cause we are free from blame before the Moslem World, and the consequences of whatever may happen are upon him who gives rise to them.

As to the remarks regarding the protection of our nationals and the safeguarding of them against the dangers of war, we think it necessary to remind Your Highness that the respect for our nationals (i.e., the right they have to be respected in pei son and property) is based on the rules of International Law applicable to war time, and w r e invite you, in the names of our governments, to respect the persons and property of our nationals : otherwise you will be responsible for anything that may happen to them anywhere and at any time. As to the letter addressed to the people of Jeddah, we are unable to deliver it on account of the rule of neutrality we follow which does not permit our interference in any manner whatsoever.

[E 1399/367/91] No. 1. Vice-Consul Jordan to Sir Austen Chamberlain.—(Received March l.'i (No. 11. Secret.) Sir, Jeddah, February 4, 1926. I HAVE the honour to forward herewith my report on the situation in the Hejaz during the period the lst-31st January, 1926. 2. Copies of this report are being sent to Egypt, Jerusalem (2), Bagdad, Aden. Delhi and Beirut (for Damascus). 3. In view of the cessation of hostilities in the Hejaz I would respectfully suggest that the necessity of sending copies of this report to Bushire, Maskat, Khartum, Singapore, Koweit and Bahrain would appear to no longer exist, and that henceforth the practice should cease unless there be some special reasons of which I am not cognisant. 4. I shall be glad to receive instructions on this point. I have, &amp;c. S. R. JORDAN Enclosure in No. 1. Report for the Period January 1 31. 1926 (Secret.) THE military situation during the period under report has been calm, with perhaps the exception of the action of certain of Ibn Saud’s forces in the direction of Jizan and Sabia, who are rumoured to have occupied the former town, whilst the forces of one, Ali, the cousin of the Idrissi, has taken a stand against his cousin Hassan in the latter. Hassan is supposed to have invoked the assistance of Ibn Snud and the occupation of Jizan was the immediate result. 2. The King's (Ibn Saud's) representative and Minister for Foreign Affairs in Jeddah, a certain Abdullah Bey Damluji of Mosul origin, informed me that the situation in Asir was by no means calm, but that Ibn Saud has sufficient forces to cope with any eventuality. That the Imam Yahya knew his own strength and fhe strength of Ibn Saud, and consequently there would not be war between them. 3. It really appears as if the Idrissi as a force has practically ceased to exist, and his territories are being divided between Ibn Saud and the Imam Yahya. 4. The Emir Mohammed, Ibn Saud’s third son, who went to Medina to receive the submission of that city, arrived in Jeddah with a part of his forces on the 20th January. During his stay in Jeddah he proceeded on board H.M.S. “ Cornflower,” Red Sea sloop, and was shown over the ship. 5. The arrangements for the future military control of the Hejaz has been finally settled as follows : Ibn Saud assumes control of the whole of the military forces and assures the safety of the roads, &amp;c. For this the Hejaz people are to subscribe £140,000 per annum, and the disbursal of the money is left to Ibn Saud. Other than the above, Ibn Saud receives an annual amount of £60,000 as King of the Hejaz and Commander-in-chief of the military forces. No armed forces, except police, are to be recruited in the Hejaz, and the forces of occupation will be Tbn Saud’s own people from Nejd. 6. Two small robberies have occurred on the Jeddah-Mecca Road, and consequently a chain of gendarme posts have been established to further guarantee the safety of travellers. Ibn Saud has also announced his intention of transferring all war materials taken in Jeddah to Taif, including aeroplanes, as the climate of Jeddah is too severe. 7. It is as yet too early to remark upon the financial situation as the many measures, economic and otherwise, are still being discussed by the so-called Hejaz Assembly in Mecca. [1228 a—3]2 1 he majority ot the new employees in the various administrations would appear to consider themselves entitled to and worthy of fabulous salaries, but I have no^ doubt that eventually this question will be settled in a much more reasonable manner than is at present proposed by certain members of the Assembly 8. The Assembly,which is supposed to be a representative assembly, can hardly claim that distinction at present, though in Mecca and Medina some pretence was made of an election, but at Jeddah several notables went to Mecca as representatives by common assent rather than election, and have taken their seats. The business done to date, with the exception of the formal recognition of Ibn Sand as King of the Hejaz, the allotment of an annual allowance, and the military occupation subsidy as mentioned above, appears to have been nil, and various reports are arriving daily from Mecca of the squabbles that are going on, particularly over financial matters and the salaries of the heads of the different administrations 9. The following appointments have been made to date :— (1.) Dr. Mohammed Hamuda (Syrian), Director-General of Health. (2.) Dr. Kheri Bey (Syrian), Inspector-General of Health Department. (/*•) Dr. Abdul Hadi Bey (Egyptian), Inspector-General of Quarantine. (4.) Dr. Ramzi Bey, Chief of Jeddah Hospital. (5.) Syed Hashem-al-Dagestan, of Mecca, Chief Revenue Officer. (6.) Abdullah Effendi (Syrian), Superintendent of Police. (7.) laufik Bey (Iraki), Port Officer. (8.) Abdullah Effendi, of Mecca, Postmaster-General. (9.) Sheikh Ali Salama, of Jeddah, Mayor of Jeddah.

Syrians are also well represented in the various commands in the army, details of which I have been unable to secure to date. Other than the above Dr. Abdullah Bey Damluji, originally from Mosul and whose brother is now at a military staff college in England, training for the Irak army, has been appointed as the representative of the King of the Heiaz and Director lor Jboreign Affairs. 10. There is a movement afoot, particularly in Mecca and Medina, that only Hejazis should be employed on the administrations, and all the foreigners i.e. Syrians, Egyptians, &amp;c., should be dismissed. IT Dr. Abdullah Hadi, mentioned above as Director-General of the Quarantine Services has already submitted a budget for £60,000 for the erection of quarantines all over the place, including Tebuk and Taif. He is, so I should iudge from a conversation I had the doubtful pleasure of having with him, a man of no intellectual development whatever, and how he came to be nominated to such a Dost is quite beyond me. r Should his proposals be put into force it is quite possible that the pilgrims will have to do double quarantine, once at Kamaran and again at Jeddah I have already protested to the King’s representative against such an eventuality, and as an example of the regime Ham Bey wou d establish, may be cited the fact that he assured me that pilgrims coming from the ships and proceeding to quarantine on the islands would endure no hardships whatever as he was buying a fast tug capable of a speed ot 2o knots to tow the dhows from the boats to the islands, and the trip of 7 miles would not take more than 10 minutes. The above proposal and the Einsteinian adaptability of his calculations are on a par with his many other suggestions. 12. On account ol the fact that most of the administrations are ?n the process of reorganisation, and on account of the poorness of the available material for the various administrative posts, no great improvement on the Sherifian regime can be anticipated for some time to come, but the one asset over the old regime is that the level-headed manner and strength of character with which Ibn Saud is facing the situation, more particularly in regard to the pilgrimage question will overcome many apparently insurmountable difficulties and tend to make the people cognisant of their own shortcomings. 1 * 13. On the 8th January Ibn Saud was by a “ Bayat ” formerly elected King of the Hejaz and assumed the title of King of the Hejaz and Sultan of Nejd and its3 Dependencies. The ceremony, which took place in Mecca, came as a surprise to many oi the Hejaz people themselves, and was, according to reports, forced upon Ibn Saud, not against his will, perhaps, by the Hejaz notables, as they realised that should he hand the government of the Hejaz over to the Hejazis themselves or to some Moslem delegation or council, nothing but internecine strife and contentions would be their lot for months and even years to come, as they would be open to the intrigues of the Ashraf and many other sections of the public. Therefore, in order to guarantee the safety of the Haramain and the roads leading thereto, in order that Moslems could perform their religious duties in security, and, further, in order to secure peace and prosperity to their country, they begged Ibn Saud to accept the kingship. 1 his Ibn Saud did but declared that the Hejaz was for the Hejazis, and that, in accordance with their wishes, he would assume the title of King and assure the safety of the Holy Places and roads, but that the affairs of Nejd and the Hejaz would be kept strictly separate. 14. On the 22nd instant, Ibn Saud, just prior to observing a self-inflicted fast, on account of not having fasted the year previous owing to the w T ar, invited the representatives of the various Powers, the European residents and the notables of Jeddah to a banquet. # A After the dinner Abdullah Bey read a speech of welcome, after which the Sultan ^ addressed the assembled company in the following sense :— ‘ It is a great pleasure to me to have the opportunity of informing my honoured guests, and particularly the foreign representatives, of my thoughts and desires for this holy territory, and which merits our best efforts to secure its peace and prosperity. I shall devote the whole of my energies to that end. I am aware of the great achievements of the western world and I do not despise them. I feel that the western world owes much to the Arabs, w r ho have, in recent years, lost their position in the world because they strayed from the right paths set by their ancestors, but I am going to devote my energies to bring them back to those paths of righteousness and truth which alone lead to great achievements. ‘‘ We have our obligations to the honourable foreign Governments, by which we will stand, and they have their obligations towards us. Moslems are brothers throughout the world, and w r e stand as such, and we ask the foreign Governments to facilitate the passage of pilgrims to the Holy Places. And there are obligations greater even than this, and that is, that Arabs and Moslems A should be treated with consideration and their interests protected as the foreigners are treated in this Holy Land. “ I know that the heart of an Arab and Moslem is good soil, and if it is watered with kindly consideration it wall produce good crops, i.e., affection. Therefore, I beg that the honourable foreign Governments will not gainsay the legitimate rights of the Moslems in their respective countries. In conclusion, I pray God our actions may be greater than our words.” 15. His Majesty has, during the course of several conversations I have had with him, raised the question of slavery, and is, in fact, manifesting a desire to find some way of abolishing this barbarous practice in the territories under his control. What the eventual results will be is not yet manifest. 16. During the period under report, orders have been secured for British firms for the supply of a condenser, two motor-cars and 5,000 tons of coal. It is hoped to secure further orders for boats, electric lighting plants, and the supply of an amount of small coinage to replace the small coins of many denominations and nationalities at present in circulation. There is also in the course of formation a Moslem company to run a service of motor-cars between Jeddah and Mecca. This company, which will be composed purely of Moslems, are desirous of having the service running before the full pilgrimage in May-June next, but, owing to the slowmess of the various administra tions and the consequent delay in getting the concession, it is doubtful whether it will be possible. 17. I understand that Mr. Philby, who is still in Jeddah, is endeavouring to secure the oil concessions at Dibba, and, if so, will be returning to England to attempt to raise the necessary capital for the exploration of these fields. 18. Two Indian deputations have been present in Jeddah during the period. (1) the Khilafat delegation as partisans of Ibn Saud, and (2) the Khudam-ul-Haramain, antagonistic to the Wahabi regime and to the other delegation. The loyalty of the Khilafat delegation to Ibn Saud was badly shaken by the election of this latter as King of the Hejaz, as they, through their delegation, were anxious to assume some sort of an administrative power after the departure of King Ali on behalf of the committee they represented. Both delegations are receiving half hearted welcomes and are very disappointed. 19. Several doctors have recently arrived from Egypt to attempt to restore the sight to the left eye of Ibn Saud, of which the vision is partly obscured by a white film. The first part of the operation has been performed successfully. 20. A wireless set, bought from Marconi in England, is being erected at Kunfuda, and a spare set, captured at Jeddah, is being sent to Abha to be erected there. These are, no doubt, to supply quick and accurate information of the military situation in that direction. 21. Nine slaves have been repatriated during the period under report. S.

I HAVE the honour to forward herewith my report on the situation in the Hejaz during the period the 1st to the 28th February, 1926. 2. Copies of this report are being sent to Egypt, Jerusalem (2), Bagdad, Aden, Delhi and Beirut (for Damascus). I have, &amp;c. S. R. JORDAN. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Report for the Period February 1 28, 1926. DURING the period under report many changes have taken place in the various administrations as laid down in my report for the month ended the 31st January. The most momentous of these changes is perhaps the dismissal of Dr. Hadi Bey, for a short time Director-General of the Quarantine, and the curtailment of a considerable part of the power of Dr. Abdullah Bey Damluji, one time King’s representative, or self-styled Viceroy and Minister for Foreign Affairs, but who is now but a repre sentative of the Foreign Ministry at Jeddah. Mouammer Bey, lately representative of the Sultan of Nejd in Egypt, has been appointed head of the Foreign Political Intelligence Department and chief adviser to the King. 2. Several interesting personalities have arrived in Jeddah during this month, chief of whom is perhaps Major Ibrahim Depui, who now styles himself as Shereef Ibrahim, claiming in justification of this pretension illegitimate descent from his grandfather’s side many years ago in the Yemen. He arrived as the representative of the High Commissioner of Syria to negotiate a commercial treaty between the Nejd and Syria. His credentials were from the High Commissioner, M. de Jouvenel, and Ibn Sand politely regretted being unable to treat with an individual, but expressed his willingness to treat with either the French or Syrian Governments. After some delay, during which no doubt Depui referred the matter to Syria, it was decided that he was negotiating on behalf of the Governments of Syria, who would soon be estab lished on a basis similar to that of the Kingdom of Irak. Owing to these delays, small progress has been made with the negotiations, as I also understand that the Sultan and his advisers are of the opinion that this move on the part of the French represents a clumsy manoeuvre to gain Hejaz recognition of the mandate in Syria, which has, I believe, been withheld to date. Should the French secure this, it will enable them to put pressure on Ibn Saud in case it can later be established that Arabs from his territories are assisting the Druse revolt. 3. Noori Pasha Shalan, a well-known Arab of the Hauran and a prominent man during the big war, arrived about the same time as Depui, but whether this is mere coincidence or otherwise I have not been able to ascertain. 4. A certain Suleiman Pasha Shafki also arrived in Jeddah during the period under report. He was one time Turkish Governor of the Asir and after Minister for War in Constantinople under the old regime. He is an anti-Kemalist and, I understand, a refugee from Turkey. 5. Other than the above a certain Mr. Ellis, an American journalist, also turned up, and after a stay of a few days in Jeddah proceeded to Bahra, accompanied by Mr. Philby as interpreter, to meet Ibn Saud. Mr. Ellis, if I am not mistaken, is well known in Constantinople for his anti-British sentiments, and they appear not to have changed since those days, as during the trip down on the steamer he lost no opportunity of criticising His Britannic Majesty’s policy in the Levant and declaring that we should clear out of Irak and leave Jerusalem and Palestine to the Americans. 6. A delegation from the Asir (Tdrissi) also came to Mecca to meet Ibn Saud and put their claims before him. This deputation was from one of the rival factors in [1228 y—1]that area, Hassan to wit, and Ibn Sand’s statement to them, as published in the Mecca newspaper, is given in enclosure No. 1 to this report. 7. Mr. Philby’s activities continue, and he seems to lose no opportunity of creating difficulties for His Britannic Majesty’s Government. Whether he does this in order to curry favour with the present authorities as a means of facilitating the obtention of certain concessions or because he happens to be a disgruntled ex-official of His Majesty's Government seeking revenge is uncertain and beside the point as the results are the same. 8. The Khudam-al-Haramain delegation, whose arrival I signalled in my last report, have become very unpopular, and eventually Ibn Sand requested them to leave the Hejaz. This will undoubtedly come as a blow to the many Indian Moslems who consider the Holy Land of Islam their own peculiar property. This delegation, upon its arrival, refused the Royal hospitality, stating that they could not recognise Ibn Sand in this country. Ibn Sand requested them first to examine the facts of the matter before condemning him, and stated that he believed that with goodwill on each side it would be possible to settle any points in dispute. Eventually the delegation accepted the Sultan’s hospitality and proceeded to Mecca. During their stay in that town they appear to have lost no opportunity of creating intrigues against the present regime, and to that end appear to have expended the greater part of the 12 000 rupees they were supposed to have brought with them from India for distribution amongst the poor of the Haramain. They also categorically ordered Ibn Sand to leave the Hejaz with his army, but failed to state what precautions they were taking against revolution and for the safety of the roads. 9. One Syed Taib Hazazi, who was a clerk in the Department of Justice, has recently been appointed as Reis-el-Diwan to the Sultan. The appointment is unfortunate as Hazazi, brought up under the Turkish regime, is thoroughly corrupt. 10. It would at present appear as if the persons who were prominent in the Shereefian regime are now obtaining many of the more lucrative posts in the new Administration to the exclusion of certain Syrians and other foreigners so-called in the Hejaz. Although this can hardly be considered desirable from the point of view of the foreigners, I mean Christian Powers, it is perhaps the lesser evil, as these people and their peculiarities are known factors, and relations can be established accordingly, whereas such past masters in the art of administrations as, say, Dr. H:\di Bey, must always remain an unknown quantity. 11. The National Assembly has recently voted a further annuity of £21,000 to the Sultan for the upkeep of the aeroplanes and the armoured cars and other technical services. This now brings the amount voted to the Sultan to £221,000, or, approximately, one-fifth of the revenue of the country. 12. The concession for the motor service between Mecca and Jeddah has been granted to Abdullah-al-Fadle in company with one Dehlavi, a prominent Mecca merchant of Indian extraction, and one Amari, together with an Egyptian. Twenty- five per cent, of the profits of this company go to the Government and the remainder is for distribution amongst the shareholders. Abdullah-al-Fadie, the promotor of this company and one of the King’s favourite advisers, has also been appointed as the buying agent for the Hejaz, and all Government purchases will in future be negotiated through him. As can readily be imagined, this most lucrative post was eagerly sought after, and El Eadle has no doubt received it in recompense for his services ito the Nejd cause during the late war. 13. Recently the authorities published a list of fees chargeable to pilgrims. This is a good step, and I understand taken by the Sultan in order to prevent the extortionate exactions of the mutawwifs (pilgrim guides) and local merchants. 14. A National Committee of Relief has also been appointed in Mecca for the distribution of charities. So far their labours have been restricted to making rules and regulations, as no charities have arrived to date, consequently they have not come in for any criticism, as they are not for the moment prominent in the public eye. 15. His Highness the Sultan has finally decided to disallow the establishment of anv banks in the Hejaz, as their procedure is against the Shara’s law. He was materiallv assisted in making the above declaration by the local merchants, who petitioned him in this respect. These people make large sums yearly out of the exchange of rupees and Dutch guilders and the establishment of a banking house would mitigate against the profitable business done in this respect. 16. From a religious point of view the Wahabis are becoming more exacting as time goes on. In Mecca several regrettable incidents have occurred, one of which ended in the victim’s death. It appears that the victim, an Egyptian chauffeur, was3 sitting at a coffee shop near the Holy Mosque when a Wahabi, dressed as all Wahabis are, came along and plucked the cigarette from his mouth and started belaying him with a stick. The Egyptian resented this treatment, and a bout of fisticuffs ensued, in which the original aggressor received a black eye and other minor injuries. It was not till the parties had been separated and quietened that it was discovered that the aggressor was the grandson of Abdul Wahab, the founder of the faith. As he is a particularly holy man, the chauffeur was taken before the Grand Cadi, who ordered him to be flogged, with the result above stated. Further, four pilgrims, Afghans, went out to the “ Jebel-el-Nur, ” where Mohammed had once hidden from his aggressors, and as they prayed they were fired upon by some Akhwan, who slightly wounded two of them. Several further incidents of a minor nature have occurred, and unless some action is taken by the Sultan to stop these persecutions it will be difficult for him to reconcile the above incidents with his assurances of full religious freedom and safety to pilgrims. In this respect he recently sent to this agency a telegram addressed to the authorities at Singapore, stating that he guaranteed the safety and religious freedom of all who came on the pilgrimage. This action was taken on receipt of a telegram from the Nemazee shipping people, who stated that pilgrims were hanging back on account of the dangers of the pilgrimage. In Jeddah, also, their strictness is becoming manifest. It may not be generally known that here is the Tomb of Eve, “ the mother of the world.” The grave is some 200 yards long and some 4 yards wide and has in the middle a small mosque, where formerly, on payment of a few piastres baKsheish, the keeper of the edifice would lift a flagstone from the centre of the floor to allow’ sceptical Christians and pious Moslems an opportunity of admiring the lady s navel. This tomb, until orders w 7 ere issued to the contrary, used to be the favourite resort of childless wives and languishing maidens, but now 7 has been closed under royal irade and anybody frequenting the place is punished. 17. Owing to the more settled conditions in the Hejaz pilgrims have already began to arrive, and some 2,000 have come from India, Java and Singapore. On the arrival of the steamship “ Alavi ” with 360 pilgrims on board, the local authorities, despite the fact that the ship had passed through the quarantine at Kamaran and had no illness on board, placed the ship and pilgrims in quarantine for twenty-four hours. This action on their part was quite unnecessary and represented but a show of authority. In company with the Dutch consul a protest wns made against this action, but no satisfaction w 7 as obtained till I telephoned to the Sultan direct, who thereupon ordered the ship to be released and later issued instructions that no ships passing any recognised quarantine station and proceeding direct therefrom to Jeddah would undergo quarantine locally unless illness had manifested itself on board after the ship’s departure from the quarantine station. Even then if the foreign representative of the nationality of the ship required, the ship would be sent back to the nearest quarantine station. He also requested to become a signatory of the International Sanitary Convention, and desires to send a delegate to the conference to be held in Paris about May next. Such actions on the part of Ibn Saud show his general disposition towards better relations with foreign Powers and a desire for more modern methods in the Hejaz, and would appear to deserve seconding as far as is practicable. 18. The condenser question has finally been settled, and the firm of Messrs. Mirrlees, Watson and Co. have agreed to have it constructed and working by the 15th May, which will go far towards securing the comfort of the pilgrims on their return from Mecca about the end of June and whilst awaiting shipment to their homes. 19. The Hejaz authorities have also placed a contract with the Royal Mint for the supply of 1 million each of 1 piastre, £ piastre and \ piastre pieces of cupro nickel^ to replace the various small coins at present in circulation in the Hejaz. This will tend to restrict the thieving methods of local money-changers who, on account of the multiplicity of currencies employed, have no trouble whatever in confounding and robbing pilgrims who wish to change their rupees or guilders. 20. During the period under report three slaves have taken refuge at this agency and been sent to the Sudan. 21.

I have the honour to forward herewith my report on the situation in the Hejaz during the period May 1st to 31st, 1926. 2. Copies of this report are being sent to Egypt, Jerusalem, (2), Baghdad, Aden, Simla, Beyrout (for Damascus), Khartoum (through Port Sudan) and Singapore. Jeddah Secret Beport for the period May 1st—31st 1926. Owing to the arrival of many pilgrims in the Hejaz for the approaching pilgrimage and’ also of a number of delegates to attend the conference called by Bin Sand to discuss ways and means of ensuring peace in the Hejaz and the comfort and Safety of pilgrims to the Holy Land the political situation both internal and external during the period under report has been interesting. 2. Internally the' situation presents certain difficulties the chief of which is no doubt the dissatisfaction of many of the more fanatical tribes of the Hejaz at the moderate policy adopted by Bin Sand towards the questions of tomb worship, smoking and other such things which are rigorously excluded from the Wahabi faith, as such were not practised by the Prophet. 3’. Bin Sand’s brother, Mohammed, who is a fanatical Wahabi and married to the daughter of Bin Bajaid, the sheikh of the Ghut-Ghut, the most fanatical tribe in the Arabian peninsula, recently left Mecca in great anger and joined his father-in-law. 4. In order to appease these unruly elements which are actually his main power and support Bin Sand was obliged to adopt a more drastic policy and so sent the Grand Qadi of the Hejaz, a certain Sheikh Abdullah Bileihed, to Medina to attend to the destruction of the tombs of the Prophet’s family. 5. The Grand Qadi eventually persuaded 17 of the Ulema of Medina to issue a fetiva in which they'set out that tomb worship is forbidden and thereupon the tombs were destroyed. I attach hereto a copy of the Fetwa with the names of the signatories as published in the Mecca newspaper “ Umm al Qura ” together with a long article on the same subject by the Editor, but inspired if not actually written by Bin Sand himself. 6. Information from Medina would indicate that a certain amount of dis satisfaction is manifesting itself amongst the poxmlation of that town and many people have left for Yambo and other centres. The Ulema who refused to sign the Fetwa are naturally in disgrace and it is considered possible that they may be prevented from continuing their religious functions. 7. Smoking has also been forbidden, in public, as has also the playing of music and other such pastimes as they are considered injurious to the body and a waste of time when devout Moslems should be calling upon Allah instead of amusing themselves. * 8. The Wahabi contentions in this respect has recently received a great set forward on account of a Fetica issued by the religious heads in Cairo in respect of the Mahmal. Bin Sand again forced by his fanatics was not prepared to allow the Mahmal to come to the Hejaz from Egypt unless certain formalities entailed by his beliefs were complied with. They were as follows :— (1) No music to accompany the Mahmal after Jeddah. (2) No smoking in public. (3) No circumambulating or worship of tombs. The Egyptian Government referred these matters to their religious heads and a Fetwa was issued in consequence stating that these conditions were in accordance with the Koran or traditions and the Mahmal and pilgrims should proceed. I attach hereto a copy of the Fetwa together with the comments thereon by the “ Umm al Qura ”. This action on the part of the Egyptian authorities has undoubtedly given M ahabism a great boost and the far-reaching effects of the Fetwa cannot at Lc 266 FD ■HA.present be estimated. But certainly it will mean a consolidation of the Wahabi regime in the Hejaz and will be the prelude to further fanatical exigencies on their part, 9. The conference which is being held in Mecca under the auspices of Bin Sand is to meet on June 1st, and as far as I have been able to ascertain and from the tone of the article regarding the Egyptian Fetwa in the “ Umm al Qura ”, the work of the conference will be chiefly the dissemination of Wahabi propaganda and a religious discussion on these points. The question of the comfort and safety of the pilgrims has already been attended to by the present Government and I gather that they are not prepared to enter into any discussion as to any sort of divided control of the Holy Places, though a committee composed of representatives of the various ele ments of the Moslem world may be elected tp advise the Hejaz Government on certain points relating to the pilgrimage. 10. The Ghut-Ghut tribe referred to above muster perhaps 5,000 fighting men and are commonly recognised throughout the Hejaz as the most fanatical and savage tribe in the Arabian peninsula. They are closely allied with the Pukhana, another fanatical tribe, and with assistance from the Arabs around Rhurma and Taraba are forcing Bin Saud to put into effect all the Wahabi tenets. Should he fail to do so these tribes are capable of associating with the Imam of Yeman, or anybody else for that matter, and conniving at the over throw of Bin Saud whom they openly called an infidel. Bin Sand’s recent actions in Medina and Jeddah will undoubtedly appease them somewhat and the effects of the Egyptian Fetwa cannot be lost upon them, but they are neverthe less clamouring for Bin Saud to return to Riyadh and attend to the internal matters of Nejd which apparently have not been so flourishing since his depar ture two years ago. Just before Bin Saud took steps to satisfy their incessant demands for a more strict enforcement of their religious principles this tribe looted a camel train of three hundred bags of rice being transported from Hassa to Riyadh as, so they said, Bin Saud had not sent them any food for months. 11. The trouble would now appear to have blown over and unless some fanatical Indians or Bokharis become annoyed at the destruction of the various tombs the pilgrimage shpuld pass off without any incidents. In order to lessen the possibility of trouble Bin Saud has as far as possible refused permission for his own people to make the pilgrimage this year. 12. A further incident of some importance recently was the arrest of Sherif Mohsen el Mansur, uncle of the late King of the Hejaz, and one of the intriguers who nearly delivered the Hejaz garrison and town into the hands of the Wahabis some months back. Sherif Mohsen is practically the head of the Harb and Billi tribes in the Hejaz and as such had a certain amount of influence. Three days after his arrest and departure for Riyadh thirty-four other Hejazis were arrested and sent to Taif where they are to be tried for treason. Promi nent amongst these latter is Said Ahmed Saggof, once the Private Secretary and Lord Chamberlain of King Ali. This party had apparently been holding secret conclaves and conspiring for the overthrow of the Wahabi regime. Certain incriminating correspondence addressed to persons in Egypt and the Yemen is supposed to have been intercepted and the plot discovered in this matter. I have not been able to ascertain the details of this matter to date but hope to do so later. A list of the arrested persons is attached. 13. It appears from information received from Mecca that certain Indian and Javanese pilgrims are availing themselves of the opportunity of openly expressing to the mass of Moslems gathered in Mecca their ideas of external politics and it is feared that some of them are offending even their own people by their frankness. - .. 'If™ Probably the worst in this respect is an Indian by name Maulvi Sana Ullah of Amritsar who loses no opportunity of addressing meetings and expressing his views to the gathered assemblies. He is apparently extremely anti-British and continually exhorting the world’s Moslems to throw off the Christian oppressors and be free. His expressions of religion and Indian politics have apparently given offence to a number of the Indian pilgrims and a certain amount of discontent at his utterances is becoming manifest. 14. Sheikh Rashid Raza of Egypt has also it appears trodden rather heavily on the toes of various sects of Islam as has several other persons of minor importance.3 \ 15. A Javanese by the name of Tjokorominato, President of the Haramat- td-lkhwan of Netherlands East Indies, has also been very prominent and is most active in his propaganda against the white races who are victimising the poor Moslems of Java and Malaya. Prominent amongst his followers are the follow ing :— Haji Rasul, Editor of the “ A1 Manar ”, Padang. Pakeh Jenan bin Taib, or Jenan Taib, Editor of the ” Seman Azhar ”, and others. It is confidently stated that these persons are about to make a determined attempt to promote and further their cause in the Federated Malay States. Hi. The Ali Brothers, Mohammed Ali and Shaukat Ali, recently arrived from India and were met by the Governor and Mayor of Jeddah under instruc tions from the King. They were treated as Royal guests and left the same day for Mecca. They had uo complaints to make regarding the administration of Kamaran where they told local people they were treated courteously. This is rather different to Sana Ullah mentioned above who upon his arrival in Jeddah told the Indian Pilgrimage Officer that such a disgrace could no longer be allowed to exist and that he would leave no stone unturned to put an end to this inhuman and indelicate state of affairs as existed at Kamaran Quarantine Sta tion. 17. As far as I have been able to ascertain to date there appears to be little or no communistic activity in Mecca amongst the pilgrims at present. Of Com munists there are plenty but they are chiefly communists by interest rather than from conviction. 18. Most of the pan-Islam and anti-Christian fanatics who are always cursing the white man’s domination are classed as communists by the local people but this appellation is entirely erroneous. That they would avail them selves of genuine communistic ideas, teachings or money is undoubtedly a fact but only #s a furtherance to their own ideas and ambitions. 19. A communistic Moslem delegation from Russia has accepted Bin Baud’s invitation to the Mecca Conference and is headed by one Dhiaeddin bin Farided- din, Chief of the Central Religious Ministry. 20. I now learn that the Mecca Conference has been postponed for five days to allow this Soviet Moslem delegation sufficient time to reach Mecca. It will be after their arrival that the real propaganda may be expected. 21. The local attitude regarding the Yemen is one of constant watchfulness but 1 am inclined to consider that the big pilgrimage from Egypt and the Fetwa issued therewith will besides the effects already mentioned above re-act adversely to the Imam in this respect also and may possibly be the deathblow to the intriguers of the old regime and the orthodox Moslems, who, being dissatisfied with the Wahabis, were endeavouring to persuade the Imam to attack. 4 22. During the period under report the existence of the Capitulations in the Hejaz were on two occasions called in question and although the request of the Foreign Representatives were acceded to Bin Saud claims that there are no Capitulations in the Hejaz and cannot be as this land is a holy land and none but the holy law of the Koran, i.e., Sharia Law, can be maintained in the Hejaz. 23. A further advance in the way of administration has been made by Bin Sand who has caused to be appointed in all the principal towns of the Hejaz an Advisory Council composed of the leading men of the town. Their duties are chiefly as their name implies but further certain of them are to be elected as representatives to proceed to Mecca to discuss questions of policy when the necessity arises. 24. The pilgrims continue to arrive daily and with the advent of the Mahmal at least 15,000 pilgrims are expected from Egypt. It would appear as if not less than 50-60,000 persons will be making the pilgrimage this season which on account of the short notice is exceptionally good and will give the Hejaz finances an opportunity to recpver from the effects of the war. 1 Approximately 36,500 pilgrims have arrived to date. 25. The Egyptian Government have recently appointed a new Egyptian Consul at Jeddah by name Emin Bey Tewfick, lately at Lyons in France.^ 26. The motor concession is now in full swing and recently acquired 25 Ford cans from Egypt which ply between Mecca tpid Jeddah. Forty chauffeurs and4 mechanics were brought from Egypt to work the service but many of these have found the conditions and climate of Jeddah too severe and have broken their contracts and returned. Local drivers have been engaged to replace them. 27. The condenser is nearing completion and it is hoped to start supplying. Water at an early date. 28. Eight slaves have been repatriated during the period under report. (Signed) S. R, JORDAN, //. B. M.’s Vice-Consul, Acting British Agent and Consul. Enclosure No. 1, in Jeddah Report for the period May 1st to 31st, 1926. Extract from the Mecca newspaper “ Umm al Qura • No. 69* oateo the April 30th, 1926. The Frank Statement. It reached us from OHr correspondent at Medina that the Grant Qadi of the' Hejaz, Sheikh Abdullah bin Bileihid, atter his arrival at Medina made an inter-* view with the learned men of the city, discussed with them many matters and ask-- ed them some questions to which they answered very distinctly. The following is the text of the questions and tlie answers. In the name of God the Most Merciful, the Compassionate. hat have the learned men of Medina, may God enlighten them and increase 5 their knowledge, got to say about the building over the tombs and using same as Mosques f Is it allowable or not I If it is not allowable, but prohibited and strictly forbidden, should it be demolished and praying there prevented or not I And if the building is in a place like “ El Baqea ” where the building prevents using the space built over, is it an unlawful thing and should it be removed be cause of the oppression it brings on the deservers or not ? And are the actions which the ignorant people do at such tombs like rubbing themselves against them, asking them as they do to God for help, drawing themselves near to them by making sacrifices and votive offerings, and lighting lamps oil same allowable or not ? Is it also allowable to turn towards the tomb of the Prophet, prayer and peace of God may be upon him, calling for help, etc., or to go round about it, to' kiss it and to rub ones body against it ! And is “ Tarheem ” and “ Tazkeer ” between the time of calling for prayer and praying and before dawn and on Fridays, as is done in the holy mosque, lawful or not 1 Please give us a ruling m these respects and mention the proofs supporting same. Answer.—We say, and pray God may grant us success, that building on' tombs is forbidden as agreed upon owing to the correct traditions related prohi biting same ; and thus many learned men gave a ruling to the effect that it should be pulled down. This is supported by the tradition of Ali, may God be pleased with him, who said to Ali el Hayag l&lt; May t send you to do as God's Prophet,- may prayer and peace of God be upon him did send me to do, that is not to leave a statue unless you destroy it and not to leave a high tomb unless you level it down 11 . As to the using of the tombs as mosques and praying in thefti, it is absolutely forbidden and lighting lamps on them is also forbidden as is mentioned in the tradition of Ibn Abbas who said that the Prophet of God has cursed the female visitors of tombs and the people who use the tombs as mosques and place lamps' over them (related by people of religious laws). The things which the ignorant people do at tombs, like rubbing themselves against them, drawing themselves near them by sacrifices and votive offerings and asking them as is done with God afe unlawful and religiously forbidden and should not be done at all. As to turning towards the tombs of the Prophet, may prayers and peace of God be upon him, it is better to stop it as is known from the important religious books and because the best direction is that which is towards the “ Qibla ”. To go round about it or to rub the body against it and to kiss it is absolutely for bidden.The “ Tazkir, tarheem and tasleem ” are something new. This is what we know as far as we can understand. And every learned man has got a superior to him. Dated 25th Ramadan, 1344. Signatures :— Mohammed bin Sadik. Mohammed bin Mahmoud el Azhari. Mohammed Zaki. Mahmoud Shaaban.

The above is the declaration of the learned men of Medina in respect of certain heresies and errors which are spread amongst the people and their danger became great in religion and in the world. They have affected the character of the nation and its beliefs. Is it fair for a man of high soul to descend himself who is created by God to the degree of submission to something less in rank and degree than his soul to dead bodies and minerals which can neither harm nor do good 1 And to call to them for help or to ask them to intermediate between him and God, though the Almighty God has elevated the human soul and made it apt to communicate with them without any intermediary means in the simplest way of communication. He taught us to say “We worship Thee and ask Thee for help ”. Some people may become amioyed to hear such ruling of the learned men of Medina, and spreaders of heresies will endeavour to make a fuss about such ruling which is applicable to what is in the Koran and the traditions of the Prophet and which agrees with the spirit of the Prophet’s mission that is to confine worship to God alone. But those whose hearts are full of faith should fear God more than they do to people and that they should follow the right path and frankly say what they believe fearing nothing. Hesitation, flattery and hypocrisy are the worst qualities that bring a man down. Any building based on such foundations will fall down with its owner in the lowest depth of life in this world and the other. No building is better than that which is based on resolution, strength and accuracy without oppression and prejudice. 3 3 • ! &lt; rS We have heard from some kind loyal people advices to the effect that we should keep in company with the people and treat them kindly. We have thanked them for their advices and appreciated their kindness. We will do our best to make people our friends. We do not want to .be enemies to the people. Anybody who is keen about life in the world and is careful not to annoy God we are in comi-diance with him in all respects. We are Moslems and worship God according to what is written in the Koran and the traditions of the Prophet. He who will follow this course is our brother in God. Our rights and obliga tions are the same as his. He who will act contrary will be left to himself so long as he keeps his harm apart from us. Anyone who treat us an enemies we will fight him until we succeed or are killed. Lc26GFD6 People will find us frank in our words and beliefs. We have nothing to say in religion except that of God and His Prophet. The thing which is correct of same is our opinion, and our course of life in the world will be in accordance with this principle. He who will argue against us we will do so against him according to the Book and the traditions we have, and then we will not care whether people are satisfied or annoyed. We will proceed in our way without hesitation. Anybody who has a proof from the Book or the traditions contradicting what we decide in beliefs and what we do we will gladly accept it. But those who are not satisfied except with heresies and errors we will not care about them. All people have understood that the heart of this Arab Island has never stuck and will never stick to a religion except that of the Book of Good and the traditions of His Prophet. He who wishes to think good or bad of such sort of the Arabs and whoever wants to treat them as enemies or as friends may do so but he should be sure of what he is doing and he must know what such sort of people are sticking firmly to their beliefs and cannot do otherwise except on proofl from the Koran or the traditions or the actions of the good ancestors. Anybody who wishes to act as an enemy or as a friend may do so but should be supported by evidences. Everj' nation has a character which never changes and this is our character which we have already described. He who feels satisfied with such character may put his hand in ours and we will work with him in happiness and misfortune. As to those who are contrary to this, God is sufficient for us and He is the best one to rely on. The Prophet, may prayer and peace of God be upon him, used alone to invite people for knowing God while all the people were his enemies and were trying to tease him and harm him. Some of his friends who followed him have been harmed by the enemies in course of serving God, they fought and were killed : “ They did not feel weary from what they had to meet in course of serving God, neither did they feel weak or afraid. Gods likes the patient. That is our religious position which is clear and distinct, and so long as our religion is safe we do not mind joining the people in what they wish and satisfy them. AYe wish to keep all people satisfied but we have to be careful before every thing to gain the satisfaction of God our Lord and Creator, our supporter and disposer of our affairs. If we do what makes Him satisfied then everythin«• else is easy. AVe ask God to help us to part and be free from deceit and appearing to people in a manner other than we really ought to, because it will be a defeat in the religion and bad for our honour. _ So let people know of our inability and let them draw our attention to everything right or wrong. The people heard some news of the inhabitants of the heart of this Arab Island and went their ways in describing same. Some praise and others speak ill of same and each party give please to what they pretend according to their conseption and what they imagine without referring to a certain proof of his. AYe wish that all people would understand us thoroughly well and know our realities. AVe would rather wish the friends to know that before the enemies. Because if a friend does not understand our realities or think of us something which does not apply with the real facts it would bring great trouble.. God knows that the most important thing of which such newspaper was anxious was to represent as far as possible the real religious, spiritual and so cial state of the heart of this Island. Let all people know that we never deviate from such religious principle what ever the circumstances may be and even if all the world will come against us. “ God is sufficient for us, He is out best reliance. He is the best master and the best help ”. « . •7 Enclosure No. 2 in Jeddah Report for the period May 1st to 31st, 1926. Extract from the Mecca newspaper “ Umm-al-Qura ”, No. 73, dated May 28th 1926. Ruling of the Learned men of Egypt. Visiting the Tombs, Tobacco and Music. His Excellency the Sub-Minister of Interior. The contents of Your Excellency’s letter of 10th May 1926, No. 91 (Adminis tration) are noted as well as the enclosed copy of telegram received from His Majesty the King of the Hejaz and Sultan of Nejd to His Excellency the Minister of the Interior of Egypt, requesting information as to the religious rules regarding the points of the telegram and as to what should be followed this year about the pilgrimage with a view to what His Majesty King Ibn Saud indicated. On consideration we found that the points about which a decision can be given are those of paragraphs 6 and 7 regarding visiting tombs, music and tobacco. As regards visiting tombs, we say that it is religiously approved as the * Prophet, may peace and prayer of God be upon him, said “ I had prevented you from visiting the tombs, but now I say visit them ”. The Prophet used to visit the tombs of the Moslems at Baqea-el-Gharqad and say : “ peace be upon you as you have kept patient and blessed is the con sequence of that dwelling ”. A certain Mahshi Imdad-el-Fattah has copied out from El Qahstani the following : (At El Ehia). The preferred course of visiting tombs is that one should stand towards the “ Qibla ” to say salaams and should not rub the grave, neither should he kiss it or touch it. The learned men explained many things which are disliked when tombs are being visited. They summarized the same by their saying : “ And also every thing that is not known of the Sunna ”, which is a general rule by which any action not known of the Sunna can be compared. They gave as examples the touching and kissing. It is known that going round about other than the “ Kaaba ” is not of the Sunna. As regards smoking or tobacco, we say that it was not existing in the time of the Prophet, may peace and prayer of God be upon him, neither was it existing in the time of the Caliphs, the friends and the Imams, but it came into existence in the late centuries. The learned men differed very much about it. Some of them said that it is prohibited relying on a tradition of Ahmed related by Om Salma to the effect that the Prophet prohibited using anything which makes one drunk or weak, and said that if it is not introxicating it causes weakness. They further stated that, according to the religious rales, if the Master prohibited a permitted thing for a religious interest it should be prohibited. Some of them stated that it is a disliked thing owing to the apparent danger it causes to bodies and loss of money. Some others did not think that it caused weakness, so they allowed it accord ing to the general rule which is ” things are either permitted or forbidden ”. They replied to those who said that it is prohibited or disliked by saying that such are two religious rulings which cannot be proved without evidence and it did not exist. It appears that the most reasonable of such sayings is the one which says that it is disliked. So it ought to be left out and not used, as small things turn out great. As regards playing and hearing of music, it is a play, pleasure and waste of time, the thing which is prohibited. For our learned men said that it is a disliked thing to play, dance, clap or to play on musical instruments which are all prohibited. The only thing exempted is beating the ” duff ” (drum) on marriages and religious ceremonies. We think it better that our Government should facilitate pilgrimage for the Moslems. Salaams and respects. (Signed) MOHAMMED ABU-EL-FADHL, Sheikh of El Azhar Mosque. „ ABDUL RAHMAN QURRA-A, Mufti of Egypt. Dated 12 may 1926 (29-10-1344). No. 39. Fetwas. Page 10. Book 28.8 Commentation of the Editor. u The Truth has come.” We thank God who caused this opportunity in order that the big learned men of Islam will spread their beliefs regarding certain matters which people took as reason to speak against Nejd and its people. We have already stated that general bad words which are of no founded reason degrade those who say them. We have asked people to point out to us anything of what we do contrary to the Sharia laws so that we will repent and come back, but we have found them silent giving no proof but only blaming and reproving us for nothing except that we did not/ follow the desires of the people, and we wall never follow them for even a single hour in course of their desires and pleasures as far as religion is concerned, caring not whether they will be satisfied with us or not. But if the rules are to be according to the Book of Allah (Koran) and the tradition of His fProphet we have to submit and obey. There was a row kicked up about the rumour spread regarding the Egyptian Mahmal and that His Majesty the King does not allow the playing of music, visiting tombs in such manner as prohibited by Islam and using the bad tree (tobacco) in places where perfumed aloes, wood and musk should be burnt instead. Such things were prevented in Nejd. People used to say that the Nejdians are fanatics because they prevented such things. But when the matter became serious and His Majesty the King stuck to the religious rules regarding same, the Egyptian Government was obliged to ask religious learned men, the Mufti of Egypt and the Sheikh of El Azhar Mosque, to give their decision in the matter. The latter were not to leave what they knew r of the religion and to follow^ the desires of the people, so they said : “ It is not allowed vdien visiting tombs to do anything except to say Salaams to the dead and to pray for him ”. Nejd and its learned men say nothing more nor do they ask for anything else. The general rule is to leave what is not of the Sunna. This washes out the argument of the tombs wdth regard to domes and buildings and those who rub themselves against same and ask them. We did not prevent people rubbing themselves against the tombs or going round about them from our own accord but according to the religious Moslem law's which have only allowed visiting tombs and praying for the dead. The learned men of Egypt have given their decision to the above effect and their Government agreed to same, not only the learned men of Nejd who did so. The same with tobacco wdiich people also blamed the Nejdians for preventing being smoked, some learned men decided that it is forbidden and the learned men of Egypt have fully explained the matter as is mentioned in their decision. We only prevented smoking for the religious interest and because it is a right to do so as is mentioned in the decision. And also with regard to music wdiich we prevented not for our pleasure, otherwuse souls desire such pleasures and hearing of music and^singing, but on the contrary we are parting from playing and wasting of time especially in such holy lands w'hich make us compelled to keep away from the soul dBsires. It is sufficient for a Moslem in such places to utter the name of God in his heart and loud submissing and praying. People have blamed us for the mentioned three points. What have they got to say now r affer such clear distinct decision in tms concern. Perhaps they will say that the Mufti of Egypt and the Sheikh of El Azhar Mosque have pre- judically gave such decision in favour of the Wahabis. That w T as an opportunity in which this matter has been clearly explained. We hope that the Islamic Conference which will be held in Mecca wall be the other opportunity in which the rest of the matters wall be discussed and a decision regarding same wull be given in accordance with the laws of the Koran arid the traditions of the Prophet. So the right wall be distinguished from the wrong and published to all people.Enclosure No. 3 in Jeddah Report for the period May 1st to 31st, 1926. Extract from the Mecca newspaper “ Umm-al-Qura ”, No. 73, dated May 28th, We received the following' notiHention from H. H. the representative of His Majesty the King : comfort in this country. It has more than once declared its intention regard ing the course of administration in such country in the best manner in the in terest of these holy lands, but some followers of Hussein and his sons who brought the calamities to this country and were acting as the dagger with which Hussein used to stab people are not pleased to see such change and the calm situation of peace and security because they are no longer able to oppress people as they used to do before. So they began to make intrigues for secret aims. The Government took notice of what they are doing more than once and learnt about their secret meetings, their decisions and communications with certain bad people abroad. The Government used to advise them and forgive them every time till they thought that the Government is unable to punish them. Therefore, for the sake of general security and peace in this country and especially during the pilgrimage season in which the Government is working hard for peace purposes, the accused people have been arrested and sent to Tail* at present where they will be tried. The Government has found some arms. which they have been hiding. The following are their names :— Mohammed ibn Alawi el Saggof. Ahmed ibn Alawi el Saggof. Mohammed el Telmi. Abbas Faqiha. Ali Abbas.

I have the honour to forward herewith my report on the situation in the Iledjaz during the period July 1st to 31st, 1926. Copies of this report are being sent to Egypt, Jerusalem (2), Baghdad, Aden, Simla, Beyrout (for Damascus), Khartoum (through Port Sudan) and Singapore. Report on events in the Iledjaz during the period 1 st — 31 st July, 1926 . 1. During the period under report a revolt of the Bani Malik and the Tihana Arabs against the authority of Bin Sand has broken out and the first fruits of victory rest with the revolting tribesmen who have defeated a party of about 500 that Bin Sand sent against them. They are rumoured to be advancing towards Taif where Bin Sand has stored a certain amount of the war materials captured from the Sherrifs at the fall of Medina and Jeddah. On the evening of the 26th July, an urgent telephone call at 9 p.m. awoke the local garrison to action and the majority of the motor cars of the concessionnaires were com mandeered and the soldiers of the garrison transported to Mecca before mid night. Several guns and a number of machine guns were also taken to Mecca the same evening. All this would appear to confirm the news of the initial reverse of Bin Sand’s troops, but of the eventual victory there would appear to be little doubt and the Arabs in revolt will soon be wiped out unless they are joined by other and stronger tribes. Bin Sand lias now sent a well armed party of about two thousand against them. 2. Another significant incident but which allows of several interpretations is that about the beginning of the period under report a warship flying either the Italian or French flag lay off Rabigh and a number of local sailing craft known as Sombouks went out to her and returned laden with cases of ammuni tion. The number of Sambouks is rumoured to have been fifteen but allowing for the tendency for all true orientals to exaggerate it was probably not more than eight or ten. Owing to the distance the ship lay off the shore my informant states that it was impossible to distinguish as to whether it was a French or Italian ship. When the news^was given to Bin Sand he thanked the informant but laughingly told him that it was his ‘own ammunition. It appears probable that this may be a present to Bin Sand from the French for signing the com mercial treaty with Syria, but I have been unable to ascetrain any further details regarding the ship and its cargo. 3. Raiding on the frontiers would appear to be on the decline as I have received no complaints either from the local authorities or from Irak and Trans- Jordan during the present month. 4. Bin Sand has sent a representative to Amman to treat with the Trans jordan authorities for the return of all looted animals and effects. 5. His Majesty’s eldest son Sand, who came from Riyadh for the pilgrimage is now proceeding to Egypt to undergo an operation on liis eyes. The Egyptian eye specialist who operated on the King himself some time ago refused to make a second visit to the Hedjaz and s,o perforce the son is obliged to go to Egvpt. The party which will be composed of some thirty persons intend leaving on the S. S. “ Mansourah ” of the Khedivial Mail Line on the 2nd August. Formal permission has been obtained from the Egyptian Government but the local newspaper to-day publishes a long article to the effect that the Egvptian Govern ment has invited Sand to Egypt and that during his stay in that country lie will be the guest of the King. 6. A certain Punjabi by name Mohammed Rashen Akhtar has been appointed Inspector General of the Municipalities of the Hedjaz and is supposed to be organising the municipalities of the larger towns of Bin Sand’s territories with a view to making them more efficient in the collection of taxes. He is a Pan- Islamist and a keen propagandist. 7. Another appointment that caused mild surprise locally is that of Suleiman Taufick Pasha as adviser to the King. Suleiman Taufick Pasha is a Turk and formerly held important posts under the old Turkish regime, including- that of War Minister. His appointment is naturally distasteful to the Syriai/elements and may also be distasteful to Turkey as he is an Anti-Kemalist. 'Another Turk who is at present residing in Egypt, also an anti-Kemalist has been requested by the King to come to the Hedjaz and accept a position under the Government as adviser to the Emir Feisal the King’s second son. Whether this means, as28 a number of local people are prone to consider, that the King is becoming dis satisfied with the Syrian parasites with which he is surrounded or merely an effort on his part to make his entourage even more cosmopolitan than at present is not for the moment evident. 8 . A committee composed of a number of the notables of Mecca has been formed with the object of inducing the King to employ many of the ex-Turkish employees as it is considered that they as bad as they may be, would nevertheless be a big improvement on the non-descript crowd at present employed under the Government. 9. Yet another sign of the King’s tendency to rid himself of the Syrian elements is that the Syrian Tyeb Hazazi the King’s Chamberlain, whom I have mentioned previously as being in the pay of the French Government, has been dismissed and will accompany the King’s son to Egypt and from there proceed to Syria whence he came. 10 . The financial situation as during the reign of Ali, could hardly be worse and although the pilgrimage is just completed the King is already asking the merchants of Jeddah for a loan of 40,000 pounds sterling. At a private meeting held in the house of the Governor of the town it was agreed to offer £15,000 only as the pilgrimage had not been a very large one and the merchants were still suffering from the effects of the late war. This s.um is being chiefly contributed by the three leading merchants in Jeddah, the houses of Zeinal Ali Riza, Banaja, and Suleiman Cabil. 11 . With reference to the dues that the Government are now charging to the pilgrims over and above His Majesty’s declaration some time previous to ihe pilgrimage a further charge of 5 medjidiehs, or approximately nine shillings is being made on all pilgrims at Medina under the heading of Koshan. This with the 3.‘J piastres,, approximately seven shillings, charged for the Health certificate upon leaving the Hedjaz, and the further charge of one shilling for passport fees makes in all an addition of seventeen shillings per head over and above what was at first estimated as the total dues payable by the pilgrims. 12. A certain Javanese by name, Tuan Sheik Mukhtar, has been busy recently in Mecca collecting funds on behalf of the Senussi to enable him to carry on the campaign against the Italians in Tunisia. I understand that no great amount has been collected to date. 13. The Worlds’ Moslem Conference ended on July 5th, last and I attach hereto a resume of the resolutions passed thereat. The Afghan, Egyptian, and Turkish Delegates left Jeddah on the 6th July, and the majority of the remain ing Delegates proceeded to Medina to complete the pilgrimage. One of the main reasons that Bin Sand is now in a state of apparent destitution and forced to raise loans from the local merchants, is that he has had towards the end of the conference to distribute large sums of money to all and sundry of the Delegates with few exceptions to gain their good will, and in order to secure them lor propaganda purposes in their respective countries. Rashid Ridha, a Syrian residing in Egypt, received two thousand pounds and Emin Husseini, the head of the Palestinian Delegation received one thousand pounds sterling. Abu Azaim of the Valley of the Nile Khilafists, received three hundred pounds and many of the others received amounts varying from two hundred to six hundred pounds. It is calculated that with presents, bribes and other incidental expenditure the conference cost Bin Sand not less than twenty thousand pounds. Over and above this expenditure he has also been distributing large sums to the heads of the various tribes as has been the custom in this part of the world from time immemorial to secure peace on the various caravan and pilgrim routes. This with all the incidental Government expenditure and approximately £40,000 worth of orders placed in Great Britain for the supply of a condenser, coal, motor cars and spares and new coinage appears to have absorbed the revenue derived from the pilgrimage and now leaves Bin Sand practically penniless. 14. The Taif claims have for the most part been settled satisfactorily, only in the case of one person, was the compensation awarded refused and the matter referred to this Agency. This was the case of a Malay jeweller of Singapore, who in consideration of his claim for 2,700 pounds was offered £140. The matter has been referred to the King requesting a reassessment and it is hoped that this final claim will also receive satisfaction. 15. The pilgrimage progresses more or less satisfactorily and it is hoped to clear out the remaining pilgrims before the middle of the present month. The caravans arrived safely at Medina and have by now left there for Yanbo and Jeddah. So far no complaints have been received of any pilgrim being ill-treated om the road.1G. Some ten days ago an Italian Ship by the name of S. S. “ Yemen ” ar rived in Jeddah and the local agent applied for a certificate to carry 418 pilgrims to Suakim, Hodeidah and Aden. Upon measuring the ship I found that in accordance with the pilgrim regulations, she could not carry more than three hundred, but in view of the fact that 273 of the 418 were bound for Suakim only twenty-four hours distance from Jeddah, I issued a certificate as requested in order to clear these people out of Jeddah where the majority were living in the •streets in a state of indescribable filth. 17. The Mahmal and escort returned to Egypt on the S. S. “ Boulac ” on the 4th July last and did not proceed to Medina. The greater part of the funds brought with them for distribution was also taken back owing to the hostility and lack of consideration shown to the Mahmal in the Hedjaz. With reference to the incident at Muna on the road between Mecca and Arafat the local news- paper “ Urn ul Kura ” has published a notice that the Government consider the incident of the Mahmal as an ordinary occurrence and that it has not affected the friendship between the Government of Egypt and the Hedjaz. 18. The situation between the Yemen and the Hedjaz continues to be rather obscure. The Yemen Delegate to the conference was inclined to follow the lead of the Turkish and Egyptian delegates and thereby did not endear himself to the power that be in the Hedjaz. He arrived in Jeddah some two weeks ago and after a stay of six days left on the Italian steamer for Massawa. During his stay in Jeddah he was in constant touch with the Italian Consul and on the occasion of his departure the Italian Consul offered a banquet on board the Italian ship. He however refrained from inviting any of his colleagues. 19. In view of the successes which have crowned the Wahabis efforts at propaganda in foreign countries, the Yemen is now about to start a campaign in Egypt according to information received from reliable sources. It appears that six persons of the immediate entourage of the Yemen Delegate, Sheik Hussein Abdul Qader, after they had obtained this Agency’s visa to enable them to proceed to Palestine to visit the Mosque of Omar, applied to the Egyptian Consulate to be granted visas for Egypt. These were refused as the matter had first to be referred to the Department of Public Security and so all six came back to this Agency and requested that their visas for Palestine should be cancelled and that they should be granted visas for Aden. This aroused my curiosity and later investigation revealed that they were proceeding to Aden where they hoped to obtain the visas for Egypt and proceed direct from there. They are supposed to be carrying funds for propaganda purposes but whether this propaganda will take the form of Anti-Wahabism or not I have been unable to ascertain. The names of these six persons are :—Thabet, Yahya, Abdullah ibn Abdullah, Salem Saleh, Hussein Mohammed, Hamoud Mohammed, aiid Ahmed Saleh. One of the number in conversation with a member of the staff of this Agency declared that the Imam of Yemen would have attacked before the pilgrimage had it not been for the complications and complaints that might have arisen from other Moslem countries at being prevented once more from making the Haj. He further stated that the Imam’s son Ahmed Seffidin would command the army on the frontiers of Asir and that a tribe called the Yaam on the frontiers had refused to pay “ Zikkat ”, animal tax, to Bin Saud and had joined with the Yemen. 20. The Bolshevik Delegate, Musa Jarulla, who created a scene during one of the final sittings of the conference by attacking the Egyptian Delegation for inconveniences caused to him by their Government in regard to passports and visas, and who was to have remained in Mecca for some time to continue his religious studies has since changed his mind and applied to this Agency for a visa to proceed to Turkey via Palestine and Syria. He was granted a direct transit visa and the Government of Palestine was warned of his pending arrival. 21. Pakeh Juan, a Javanese established in Cairo and the editor of the Cairo paper called the Seruan Azhar, applied for a visa to proceed to Palestine which was refused. He then approached the Acting Dutch Consul who asked me my reasons for refusing the visa. I informed him of the 'activities of this man and he expressed himself as being completely satisfied and asked that he might communicate this information to his Government. 22. Syed Ali el Irdissi arrived in Jeddah from Aden on the 30th July, and after a stay of twenty four hours in Jeddah left for Mecca as the guest of Bin Saud. 23. A certain British subject by the name of Upcher a Christian Missionary arrived in Jeddah recently without an endorsement on his passport for this country and endeavoured to obtain an interview with Bin Saud in order , torequest him for permission to carry on his missionary activities in the Hedjaz. I strongly advised Mr. Upcher to leave Jeddah by the next steamer which ho did without having his expected interview with the King and Imam of the most fanatical of all Moslem Sects, 24. The local authorities have now issued a passport in book form printed in English and Arabic and it is a poor imitation of a British Passport. Ihese passports bear photographs and have a validity for one year only. 25. From a commercial point of view the outlook in the Hedjaz for the next few months is particularly black as there is no money available and consequently only cash transactions should be entertained until further notice. 26. Two slaves have been repatriated during the period under report, (Sd.) S. K. JORDAN, II. B. M. Vice-Consul, Acting Agent and Consul, Jeddah, Enclosure to Jeddah report for July.
