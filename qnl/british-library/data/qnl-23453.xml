I v L &lt;^&gt; Ho* f/yS— X'o of 1365 Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain Dated, 2nd Dajab, 1365 June 2, 1946. The Chief Local Representative, The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited, Bahrain. Dear Sir, With reference to the case recently heard in the Bahrain Court regarding timber. In this case the Police instituted proceedings against a number of timber merchants from Muharraq charging them with being in possession of and having purchased a quantity of stolen property consisting of various types of wood which belonged to the Bahrain Petroleum Company. It was established.by the prosecution that the wood In question was owned by Bahrain Petroleum Co., and that some of it had been used in the building of the Sitra pier. The defendants denied that they had knowingly purchased stolen property and alleged that they had bought the timber openly after it had been imported into Bahrain, through the Customs, by boatmen who recovered It from the sea where they found it floating. They claimed that for several years boatmen had bean bringing timber from the sea for sale in Muharraq and this fact was established by an examination of the Customs records which showed that during the last two years local boat owners have been importing timber of 2 / —&gt; e 5*3/ 2 various types which they alleged they recovered from the sea or acquired from steamers in the prt. Owing to the quantity of wood which was brought into Bahrain ago that all such wood would be liable to customs duty on entry. The Court during the hearing of the case listened to the evidence of a large number of persons including Nakhudas and crews of the sailing boats who brought the wood from the sea which they sold to the timber the owners of small sailing boats had been collecting wood over a period of time, bringing it to Muharraq and there selling it to timber merchants and wood brokers, the purchaser usually paying the customs duty. It did not appear that these transactions were in any way concealed and in some cases the wood was left exposed to public views at the Customs or in timber yards. fo obtain a conviction against the persons in possession of the timber, who were charged with receiving stolen property, it was essential that the prosecution should establish the fact that the people in possession of the timber knew or had reason to believe that it was stolen. This fact was not proved and therefore the Court found the timber merchants in whose premises the timber was found, not guilty of dishonestly receding or dealing in stolen property. The case against the boatmen who brought the wood from the sea was also examined. All these persons admitted bringing the wood to Muharraq, some claimed that they bought it from other boatmen at sea, some from the sea the Government arranged over two years merchants. From all this evidence it was clear that4/ - 3 - said that they collected it on the shore and others stated that they found it floating in the sea and took it aboard their boats. Everyone denied having taken wood from the Sitra pier and there was no evidence against any idivldual or persons to show that they had taken the wood from Sitra. The prosecution endeavoured to the best of its ability to prove a case against the timber merchants and the boatmen but it failed to produce conclusive evidence. The Court therefore discharged the persons concerned but orders were given that the wood which had been indentified as belonging to the Company should not be disposed of without permission of the Government. His Highness Shaikh Sulman, who has followed the case with much interest now suggests that, should you wish to do so, you should be enabled to recover the timber at a reasonable price from the wood merchants who acquired it. The merchants will be ordered by the Court to release the wood to you and as a method of determining its price X suggest that you should furnish us with a list of the wood which was indentified by your representative showing its price or that you should appoint someone to appear in Court with the particulars of the price. The Court was not able to ascertain the prices paid for the wood by the merchants with any degree of accuracy as in some cases the wood changed hands several times before it reached the store in which it was found and no records of the sales and purchases were obtainable nor was it possible to identify indi vidual lots of wood, for which the sale prices were known, with the wood in the timber yards.It Is my personal opinion that some of the timber was actually found floating in the sea but much of it was either stolen or deliberately released from the pier by people who had accomplices in the neighbourhood in boats who then recovered it from the sea and took it to Muharraq for sale but unfortunately no evidence was forthcoming against any individuals who might have been actually implicated in the theft.

Since it is impossible to tell exactly the order number under which the various pieces of timber residing with the Merchants at Muharraq were pvtthitsgL under, we believe the best method for establishing a fairprUc would be on the basis of the average cost for recent shipments/ d&gt; b P* -Z6 3. - 2 - 16th June, 194-6• of lumber received from the U.S.A. which is identical in type to the lumber held by the Muharraq Merchants, SUMMARY COST OF RECENT LUMBER SHIPMENTS ORDER HO.

Philadelphia means all freight and handling charges from Mill to Philadelphia and timber placed aboard ship are included in the costs, also one board foot equals a stick one foot long one foot wide and one inch thick, or its equivalent. It should be noted that for the 8 most recent timber orders for which the Company has records that the average cost per thousand board feet is $ 111.83. The boatmen who have taken the timber through Customs have distinctly argued their case whereby they claim the timber was picked up in the sea. This then means that these men had no expense whatsoever in either producing the timber, felling and cutting trees, sawing the timber into commercial sizes, or transporting it to seaboard. All such costs are included in the average costs given above. Their only costs was the use of a boat by which the lumber was found and the Customs costs of clearing it at Muharraq. It has been estimated that the freight wost from the Mill at which the lumber was purchased to seaboard and handling charges to place the timber on board the ship amounts to $ 20 per thousand board feet. This estimated cost deducted from $ 111.83 is the average cost F.A.S. Philadelphia, U.S.A. per thousand board feet results in a cost of $ 91*83, which we think would be a very fair price for the timber.

Sir, On the 12th November, 1946, at about 12 noon a theft took place in our house near the Adviserate. Our boy servant v;as away from our house to bring our food from the Jaharaj f s Hotel. We ha&gt; locked both the rooms upstairs as usual and the servant had locked the outside door of the house before he went out. It appears that when he returned, (at 1 0*clock) he found the outside door forced open by break ing the lock, lie went upstairs and saw one room open and found all boxes inside lying open with the contents (clothes etc) thrown out pell raell. He reported the matter immediately to us at the office. We went home and found safe out that our house was robbed. One br a nd new shoes bearing the round mark ' Salem, Modern, Balu' and ten rupees in cash were lost. The other room upstairs was not entered into, but there are marks on the lock to indicate that a trial was made to break it open. C/0 Political Agency, Bahrain, The 13th November, 1946. We reported the incident to the Inspector of Police, Mr. Abdul Karim, who came with his assistants on the spot without .delay. He has taken note of some details; and we hope he is on the look out to catch the culprit. Though our losses were luckily not much, we request that the Police be asked to make a vigorous effort to book the thief, who, it is guessed, is the same fellow who robbed a house of some Bapco employees in the ftllal Buildings and the house of some BOaC employees at Manama, on the 10th and 11th of November respectively, \ Yours obediently, Bahrain Receipt A (f .J.

Reference your endorsement No.3729-6/93 dated 14th November 1946, the Police are endeavouring to trace the thief. Within a few days several thefts have occurred all from houses of Indians, unmarried men, at about the sane time of day and under similar circumstance the last incident being the theft of Hi.2,000/- from a Government hospital male-nurse. We have rounded up a number of well known thieves, for interrogation. They have now gone on hunger strike. Two metal instruments for use in opening locks were found in two of the rooms which were robbed and we are trying to ascertain where they came from. I think without doubt these thefts are the work of one man or gang. H. B. M* s Political Bahrain.

No further iniormation has been obtained by the police about the particular case which was referred to in your memo. An arrest was made in a similar case in which the house of an Indian alone, was broken into. The culprit was found to be in possession of some of the property which was stolen from the house, he was convicted and sentenced to prison. There is reason to suppose that he was associated with another man who had frequently worked as a servant in houses or rooms occupied by Indians but there was not sufficient evidence to frame a charge against the second suspect, since this case robberies of this type have ceased.
