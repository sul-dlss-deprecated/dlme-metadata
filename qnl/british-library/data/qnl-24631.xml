FOREIGN DEPARTMENT. No. 213 of 1904. SECRET. External. To The Right Hon’ble St. JOHN BRODRICK, Hia Majesty's Secretary of State for India. Simla, the 10th November 1904. Sir, With reference to your Secret telegram, dated the 13th December 1903 and Secret despatch No. 40, dated the 18th December 1903, we have the honour to transmit a copy of a report by tbe Political Resident at Aden, dealing with the history of tbe demarcation of the frontier between Aden and the province of Yemen from the beginning of the proceedings up to the dissolution of the Commission in June last, as amended by us. Although the report forms a most useful history, it may not be necessary now to publish it; but, should publication be decided upon, the remarks of the Resident, as regards the Turkish Government and their officials, may require to be revised, especially if the boundary has in the meantime been amicably settled. 2. We venture to take this opportunity of recapitulating, for the information of His Majesty’s Government, the main features of the work which has been accomplished and of the results that have been so far attained. At the beginning of 1902, the position was as follows :—No part of the boundary between the British protectorate and Turkish dominions was delimited. We claimed the whole territory belonging to the so-called “ Nine Cantons”, i. e. f the country of the Abdali, Padthli, Akrabi, Haushabi, Alawi, Amiri, Subaihi, Yaffai, and Aulaki. The Turkish authorities claimed the whole of South- West Arabia except Aden and its immediate neighbourhood. 3. In February 1902, the British Delimitation Commission was cons tituted with Colonel R. A. Wahab, C.I.E., as Commissioner at their head. The moment the Turkish local authorities understood that delimitation work was to be carried out on the general basis of actual effective occupation, they pro ceeded to seize various points in the Amiri territory, which, it was understood, was to be first taken in hand. This action they took with a view to founding increased claims on the new seizures. The British Commissioners, notwith standing this aggressive action, proceeded to the Amiri country, and entered into communication with their Turkish colleagues. 4. The whole time from February 1902 until March 12th was passed by the British Commission in furnishing His Majesty’s Government with reports and tracings of the country in dispute, in resisting Turkish encroachments, and in fruitless endeavours to come to some practical arrangement with the Turkish Boundary Commissioners as to a reasonable basis for negotiation.

As regards the rest of the boundary towards the sea, though it has been surveyed, no agreement has yet been arrived at on the subject, but urgent representations are being made by His Majesty’s Government direct to the Porte, with a view to the prompt settlement in principle of the question. On 11th June 1904, Colonel Wahab resigned his position as Joint Commis- luer aud all the other members of the Commission left ^h the exception of Mr. Pitzmaurice, who was instructed to stop at Penm, while the T Commissioner remained at Sheikh Said, with a view to the settlement of the remaining portion of the south-west boundary. 7. Now that the Commission has practically come to an end of its labours, it may not he out of place to state briefly our opinion as to the work done by the British Commission. This work consists in the delimitation ol Id» miles of boundary and in the survey of over 6,000 square miles more m the course of 2| years, in spite of the consistently obstructive attitude of the Turkish Commissioners, the obstacles caused by disturbances among the interested tribes, and the trying nature of the climate. We consider that results have been achieved which are substantial and on the whole satis factory. While, on the one hand, we have lost considerable areas to which the “ Nine Cantons ” had historical claims, we have for the most part secured a definite frontier to which the tribes concerned do not apparently themselves object. In the course of the proceedings it has unfortunately been necessary on more than one occasion to take punitive measures against sections of the tribes who have obstructed the Commission’s surveys, or interfered with their lines of communications. We shall have occasion to notice these operations m a separate despatch. That the punishments thus inflicted have not been ineffec tual is, we think, shown by the practical immunity which the Commission enjoyed in the later stages of their operations through the turbulent country of3 the Subaihi tribes; and we trust that the demrture of fhp Pa™™* • r their country has left among the tribes a conviction of our power toTnfoZ submission and our intention to abstain from interference. P “ 8 . We venture to call the attention of His MaWv’o ** n. services performed by the officers concerned in the demarcation and™ this 00 ^ potion we desire to mention the name of Major-General P. J. Maitland C B u 0 , 1 * 10 ^ ^ esl ^ ent ' . ^hough not directly concerned with the delimitation IflWH he ii, ha f ' ecessanl 7 t° advise 0 “ the proposals of the Commissioners as affecting the future administration of the Hinterland, and he was resnonsTble throughout for the local measures which ultimately enabled the CommLion to overcome the many difficulties caused to them by the impracticability of their Turkish colleagues and the turbulence of the tribes through wliosif tcrritorv they had to pass. Some friction unfortunately occurred between the Besident a ° d , tl ‘® Commissioners, owing to the somewhat different standpoints from which they approached the questions at issue, hut on the whole we consider that General Maitland performed his task with firmness and discretion. Colonel R. A. Wahab was first as sole, and then as Senior Joint, Commis sioner in charge of the delimitation throughout. His experience of survey work was invaluable, and he is entitled to much credit for having brouo-ht the main portion of the demarcation to a satisfactory conclusion. 9. We also have the honour to enclose a copy of a Report* by Colonel • No. 43 (Secret), dated the 10 th June 1904 . Wahab, and to draw the attention of His „ Majesty’s Government to the account given therein of the services of officers who formed part of the Commission We would especially bring to your notice Colonel Wahab’s observations, in which we heartily concur, as to the good service performed by Mr. G. H. Eitzmaurice, the Joint Commissioner, whose zeal, ability, and 'skilful handling of both Turks and Arabs undoubtedly contributed in no small measure to the successful completion of the operations, and as to the valuable assistance rendered by Lieutenant, now Captain, M. O’C. Tandy in circum stances of peculiar difficulty and danger. We also endorse the Commissioner’s remarks on the work done by Captain E. A. R Redl, and Major W. S. Delamain. Before closing this despatch we desire to record our regret at the death of Captain G. Warneford. This talented officer had done excellent work at Dthala, and seemed marked out for a brilliant career; and we consider that his sad loss was a misfortune to the Commission and to the administration of the Aden Hinterland. We have the honour to be, Sin, Tour most obedient, humble servants, //.

C0as &gt; • The capital was Lt s’anah about 220 miles north of Aden, and something over 100 miles inland from the port of Hodeida. 1 urkish rule, however, never seems to have been very firmly establish ed m Yemen. Repeated rebellions of the Arabs, and the difficulty of main- taming a large number of troops in a country with which communication was then difficult, induced the Turks to withdraw from this region in 1630 after about 90 years of occupation. J 3. The sovereignty of Yemen and the adjacent coasts was then assumed by the former ruling family, whose head takes the title of “ Imam ” They are directly descended from the Abbaside Caliphs of Bagdad, and the branch which still reigns oyer a small portion of their ancient dominions is related to the Barakat family of Sharifs of Mecca. The power of the Imams, disturbed by the family and other dissensions usual in oriental States, and by wars With the Wahabis and the Viceroys of Egypt, continued for more than two and a half centuries. During this period, however, Aden had become separated from Yemen, and was the capital of a small State, apparently consistin 0 * of Aden and Lahej and the neighbouring district. The other tribes in what is now the Aden Protectorate appear to have been independent.* 4. The adoption of the “overland” route to India in 1837 necessitated the establishment of a coaling station for steamers somewhere between Suez and Bombay. Aden was by far the most convenient place for this purpose, and an endeavour was made to obtain it by purchase. The then Sultan actually entered into an agreement with the British representative, Captain Haines of the Indian Aavy, to cede the peninsula in consideration of an annual pension of $8,700. But when, in the following year, the fulfilment of this en°*ao*e- ment was requested, the Arabs fired on the boats of Captain Haines’ ship” a°nd committed various acts of treachery. Accordingly, the place was bombarded and. taken by assault, the Sultan and his family fleeing to Lahej. This was in January 1839. The town of Aden, the population of which is now upwards of 17,000,f was then a wretched village containing only some 600 inhabitants, most of whom were Jews, and trade kad sunk to the’lowest ebb. 5. Six months after the capture of Aden, Captain Haines, now Political Agent, entered into an agreement with the Sultan Mohsin bin Eadthl, formerly of Aden, now of Lahej, which was in effect a defensive and offensive alliance. The Sultan was to receive a subsidy of $6,500 annually, and iu addition ^ ... .. , the British Government undertook to pay the stipends of the Amir'of Dthal^ 6 to the Fadthli &gt; Yaffiai. Haushabi and Amiri, which were formerly paid by the Sultan to those tribes for keeping open the trade routes. These four tribes, therefore, as well as * It is said that the Imams, after having practically obliged the Turks to abandon Yemen took Aden from them in 1630. About 100 years later, in 1735, the Yaffai and Abdali combined, and took Aden from the Imams. For another 100 years it was held by the Abdali, until they were turned out by the British in 1839. f The total population of the Aden Settlement is about 43,000. The area of the Aden Pro tectorate is somewhere about 40,000 square miles. The population, exclusive of the Aden Settle ment, may be about 1,000,000 souls. con 1049—12 the Sultan’s own tnbe the Abdali.n ere was su b se quently secured to first. The stipend ot a sixth tribe, the Ala ^ Ch . ef _ geparat e engagements them through the intervention of the Haa ^ the Haushabi; were afterwards made with the Padthl, oul . re l a tions with these tribes also with three other tribes, and as tnn , | s upi-emaov of the British, became well established. _ They all acknowledged the^up e . and their own responsibility for the roads leading to 6 .

Nine tribes were named with whom engagements bad been entered into, and it was stated that the British Government felt free to make fresh engagement , they thought expedient. 8 . The &lt;£ nine tribes ” (usually spoken of in Turkish diplomatic docu ments as the {{ nine cantons ) were (1) The Abdali. (2) The Tadthli. (3) The Akrabi. (4) The Haushabi (5) The Alawi. (6) The Amiri. (7) The Subaihi. (8) The Yaffai. (9) The Aulaki. 9 The despatches of 1873 were followed by Lord Derby’s despatch of 30th 4pril 1874, which clearly states the position taken up by the British yrov- ernment with regard to the tribes in the neighbourhood of Aden and declares that Great Britain will not permit anv interference on the part ol lurkish omcials with the stipendiary Chiefs. These declarations produced assurances from the Porte that their officials in Yemen had been ordered not to interfere with any of the tribes having treaty relations with Great Britain,_ and similar assurances have been subsequently given on more than one occasion. But the orders' of the Government at Constantinople have been, to say the least, very imperfectly carried out, for Turkish interference with the Amiri and Haushabi territories has been a frequent source of annoyance to the British authorities, and the subject of complaint to the Turkish Government, for which, however, very little satisfaction has been obtained. 10. With a view to ending, if possible, the continually recurring disputes, the Resident at Aden was authorised in March 187 7 to endeavour to arrange with the Governor-General of Yemen for the settlement by arbitration of the boundaries between the Turkish territories and those of the Amir of Dthala. Nothing came of this, however, and a few years later Her Majesty’s Government proposed “an arbitral delimitation” of the Dthala frontier by a British officer in concert with the Turkish authorities. But this did not suit the Porte, who, instead, raised the old claim of the Sultan of Turkey to the whole of Arabia, and even went so far as to complain of the purchase of certain lands in the neighbourhood of Aden from.the Sultan of Lahej. Lord Granville replied in a despatch dated 10th January 1883, in which he expressed surprise at the renewal of pretentions which had so often been declared to be inadmissible, and stated that Her Majesty’s Government had no intention of withdrawing3 constant renewal of discussions between the two Government » PreVent the matters continued in an UM^ttfactorTst^r^^adip 4 t0 &amp; &lt;lf ;“ arcation &gt; and of establishing a formal p“tor^ 116,1 first ™ ise d Aden.

As regards the inland tribes, the Government of India dS that, before concluding protectorate agreements with them, it would be necessary to undertake a topographical survey of the country, fuller knowledge of whiclT and of the conditions ot the tribes, was required. ° * 13. Captain l\ahab, R.E., of the Survey of India Department was accordingly deputed to Aden, and in 1891-92 he* carried out a suiw^y of The country to the north as far as Dthala. The resulting map, thoa4 of Leat value, did not extend, m many places, to the actual boundary between the tribes having relations with the British and those under Turkish rule. This was partly owing to the opposition shown by certain tribes to the survey operations IS o attempt was, or could then have been, made to map the country to the north-east of Dthala, which is comparatively remote from Aden, and which was at that time thought to he of no great importance. The map however was sufficient for the purpose for which it was primarily required and protec- tive treaties with most of the inland tribes in the vicinity of Aden 'were entered Tono 14 * thlS there no incident °f importance for some years, but in 1900 complaints were received from the Haushabi Sultan that one Muhammad hm JNasir Mukbd a Sheikh of the Homar tribe, who had been appointed Mudir of his district by the Turkish authorities, had built a tower near the villa°-e of Ad Dareja within Haushabi limits, and that it was occupied by a Turkish garrison. The tower, a defensible structure of some size, and of a type pommOn m Southern Arabia, is described in the correspondence as a small fort, or a fort, or a fortlet. Remonstrances addressed by the Resident to the Governor- General of Yemen remained without a reply, and although the Turkish Govern- when appealed to, declared their disapproval of the alleged eneroachment while the Wav Minister promised that if a fort had been erected at Ad Dareia it should he demolished, n 0 change took place. The situation was complicated by the fact that the Haushabis on one side and the Homars on the other are hereditary enemies, and each clan turned out its men. This afforded the Turks an opportunity for commencing to make counter-complaints—a plan frequently resorted to by the local officials when they have been more than usually aggres sive ; and then doubts were raised as to where the boundary line actually ran and whether the tower was not after all within Turkish territory. • \ 5 *, l? Eebruai y 1901 &gt; a year after the erection of the tower, Her Majesty s Government caused a declaration to be Conveyed to the Porte that if Muhammad Yasir Mukbil did not immediately evacuate the fort, the Haushabi bultan, supported, if necessary, by the Aden garrison, would shortly expel him. Two months later, the British Ambassador telegraphed that the lurkish Commandant had been instructed to expel Muhammad Nasir from the fort, and orders were sent to Aden to have a force held in readiness to carry out the expulsion, if the Turks failed to do it themselves. J 16. The Resident (General More-Molyneux) was, however, somewhat doubtful as to the expediency of using British troops for this purpose.

The Turks left Ik dead on the field, and were said to have had many wounded. Ei-ht were made prisoners. Our losses were four kil ed and five wounded. The Tmks evacuated the tower that night, and it was blown up by the force on the following morning. It was then discovered that a battalion of Turkish troons (400 to 500 men) had arrived the day hetore the fight, of whom a poZn were sent forward to hold Ad Dareja, while the rest remamed m t bv the tower, a mile or two distant. But the vigour of Major Rowe’s attack disconcerted the Turkish Commander who retired to Taiz without firiu-another shot. He was subsequently degraded; not, it is understood for having invaded territory under British protection, bat for having suffered defeat at our hands. n On the 2nd August the main body of the Ad Dareja force started on the return journey to Aden, marching into that place on the 12th, so that the whole expedition was over in four weeks. A detachment was left at Mnsemir, the head-quarters of the Haushabi Chief, for some time longer, hut as there were no further signs of aggression, this was also withdrawn, and the Ad Dareja affair was thus successfully terminated. &lt; ■ -I . ■ -5 22.

Only a few weeks before Major Davies’ arrival the Turks had taken possession of an isolated hill, called Jabal Shahad,f immediately to the soutn-east of Jalela and had planted a garrison there. This hill comnletelv commanded the caravan route and the main approach to the Dthala pa tea u Major Davies also reported that the Turks were endeavouring to obtain possession ot Mafari, a hill and a small district about four miles in a straight line south-west of Dthala. These encroachments appeared to the Resident even more serious than the erection of the tower at Ad Dareja, which we had sent a military force to destroy. 25. This was the situation in the Amiri country when the Joint Delimita. tion Commission was appointed at the end of the year (1901). 26. The British Commission consisted of Colonel Wahah, R.E., the same officer who conducted tiie survey of 1891-92, and of Lieutenant-Colonel Abud of the Bombay Political Service. The latter had had much experience of Aden 3 and ins knowledge of the tribes was probably greater than that of any other officer who could have been selected. 27. ^ A survey party under Lieutenant Tandy, R.E., was attached to the Commission. On the Turkish side the principal Commissioner was Colonel Mustafa Rienzi and he had several colleagues. They travelled by land from Hodeida vid Sanah to Kataba, and the first meeting of the British and Turkish Commissions took place at Dthala on the 11 th February 1902. * P^ ac s&gt; 11 miles north of Dthala, had been made the head-quarters of a Turkish district in 18/2, although it seems to have been then actually in the possession of the Amir, t Called Suheb iu Wabab’s map. con 1049—26 28.

The protectorate of Aden is not confined to the immediate hinterland. It stretches for several hundred miles to the eastward, until it joins t e territories of the Sultan of Mnskat. The only habitable parts of this country, are the coast districts, a belt which can hardly he more than 150 miles wide, and it is probably much less in most places. Beyond is the great desert. Our maps have the word “ Hadramaut ” printed_ over the whole region from Aden to Muskat, hut at the present day this name is applied only to riie area drained bv the Wadi so called, the upper (western) portion of which belongs to the Sr,It,an of Shahr and Mokalla, a chief with whom we have a protectorate treaty. 30. By far the greater part of the frontier, including the whole of the central half lies in a hilly or mountainous region, much of which is well populated and studded with villages and hamlets. It is a peculiarity of the country that the tops of the hills frequently expand into small plateaux which are closely cultivated. The Arab inhabitants are not ill disposed. In fact, the general feeling of the countrv is distinctly in favour of the British, as opposed to the Turks. But the ■people are very ignorant, very conceited, and exceedingly suspicious. Bike all mountaineers, they are jealous of their independence, and do not like the visits of strangers. Religions fanaticism is not especially strong, but it is a factor that has to be reckoned with, and it has a way of making itself apparent at unexpect ed times and places. British prestige is not high in Southern Arabia.* The people regard the Sultan of Turkey as the greatest earthly potentate, and though they dislike the Turks, they fear them more than they do the English. Many people in the interior believe that Aden is only held by us at the pleasure of the Sultan, and that a Turkish warship comes yearly to collect tribute, during which time the Turkish flag is hoisted on the forts. 31. The Arab tribes are well armed. They have obtained from D’Jibuti breech-loaders of French make in considerable numbers, and ammunition is fairly plentiful. The houses of the Arabs are strong square towers, built of unmortared stone, several stories high, and loopholed. Their villages consist of larger or smaller groups of these houses, and they are capable of resisting any attack made by infantry without the aid of artillery. Towers built for purely defensive purposes are also found on commanding positions where the country is well populated. The tribes and sub-divisions of tribes are frequently engaged in wars with each other, as is the case in similar states of society all over the world, and though the Sultans are generally respected and obeyed, their ^Perhaps it would be more correct to say that British prestige was not high in Southern Arabia when the demarcation was undertaken. Kecent events have, it is believed, made no small difference in this respect, and if the war in Somaliland is brought to a successful termination, British influence will no doubt be greatly enhanced.© authority is far from absolute.

Negotiation on this basis beino- impossible, the Commissioners parted, pending reference to their respective Govermnents. But instead of awaiting the result of the reference, the Turkish local officials proceeded to emphasize their assertions by taking possession of the territory in dispute. They occupied Mafari, and they established a strong post on Jabal Jihaf, a most commanding position. Their small post at Jalela was increased to several hundred men with artillery, and finally, finding that these movements were not actively resented, a cordon of Arab levies was drawn across the plateau at the southern end of which Pthala is situated. This line which partly encircled the village of Dthala and the camp of the British Com mission, was maintained as if it were a frontier to he guarded against invasion. IheAmir was cut off from all his villages on the plateau and reduced to considerable difficulties m the way of supplies. No party from the British camp was allowed to cross the line, and in several instances our people were actuallv fared on. J 36. Purther, the British Commissioners had reason to believe that the Turkish officials were endeavouring to stir up against them the Arab tribes on their own side of the frontier. In April, Colonel Wahab had information of a gathering beyond the Tiban, which was apparently got together for the purpose of attacking the British camp, but it was said that the Sheikhs refused to lead their men in such an enterprise unless the Turks attacked first, and so the plan fell through. Nevertheless, the position of the Commission, with its small escort, at a distance of nearly 90 miles from Aden gave the Resident some anxiety, and he was anxious to reinforce it with British troops, but this was not at the time considered desirable. i 37. As soon as the Turks had secured Jabal Jihaf and Mafari, they claimed the whole of the western and south-western hill districts, Azraki, Mehrabi, Ahmadi and Humedi, which drain to the Tiban. Thus the Amir was t#8 I 1 I left with nothing on the plateau hut the °£ .^'i^itse^ a ^ e °p* incipal of his territories only a fragment renaam en d e avoured to absorb were Sheikhs of the country which the rurk ® , e ,“ detachme] 1 t, of Turkish rpnlaoed hv Turkish nominees, who were suppoited by detaonmeu trolps and\y Regular levies’of Yemen Arabs armed with rifles. go On 7th April 1902, Colonel Wahab addressed a letter to the ment of India forXding a ’sketch map, on which was shown by a ^ 'me the Commislion was far from complete, but the Commissioners Mt ousted m recommending their red line for adoption as the boundary of J° l ' , • tectorate The line represented the limits of the country of which the A was in effective possession at the time when demarcation was proposed by t Turks It ran “ from a point on the mountain range north-east ot JAataba, between the Mares and Shaibi tribes, leaving Mares on the darkish s^e, and thence between Kataba and Sanah so as to include on the British side the Amm villages in the Wadi-as-Safiya, and the tribes subject to the Amir in the T ban valley, viz., the Humedi and Ahmadi. Thence it followed the boundary of those tribes until it reached the Haushabi border on the Am Amma range. The Amir also had claims to Kataba, and to considerable tracts of country beyond it, which had no doubt been ruled by his predecessors, or some of them, in the time of the Imams. 39 . The boundary claimed by the Turks was at an average distance of about 15 miles from, and within, the line drawn by the British Commissioners. It was evident that these two boundaries were wholly irreconcilable, and that one or the other would have to he entirely rejected. 40 In advocating the adoption of the line shown on the sketch map* Colonel Wahab wrote:—“This will involve the evacuation of the Turkish positions at A1 Jalela, and on Jabal Jihaf and Mafari^ which evidence shows to have been occupied or retained by the local officials, in spite of repeated assurances by the Sultan’s Government to the contrary. ^ Occupation under such circumstances cannot be considered to establish any rights over the localities, and I would submit that no settlement of this boundary can be satisfactory that does not provide for the withdrawal of Turkish troops from them, and from the whole of the Amir’s territory.” 41. The behaviour of the Turks, as reported by the British Commission, seemed* so inconsistent with the spontaneous offer of the Porte to delimit, that Her Majesty’s Government were for the moment in doubt as to what course to pursue. J It was even thought possible that the British Commissioners were exceeding their instructions. But little attention had been paid to Dthala affairs in the past, and there was an impression, based on misleading informa tion originally furnished by a native official, that the general line of the Amiri frontierVas sufficiently well defined by the limits of the survey of 1891-92, and that the only difficulties in delimitation would he those of: detail. It was not understood, therefore, why the British and Turkish Commissioners claimed totally different frontiers, and beyond remonstrances at Constantinople regarding the unexpected attitude of the Turkish Commission, no action was taken. The Turks were not slow to take advantage of the pause. They gave out that the British had abandoned their claims to the disputed territory, and that the reinforcement of the British escort had been stopped by desire of the Sultan at Constantinople. They also proceeded to act within their cordon of Arab posts as if the country were actually their own. One incident is particu larly worthy of note. The village of Lakhmat-as-Saleh was attacked by a Turkish partisan who was the relation and rival of the local Sheikh. Men sent by the Amir to assist the latter drove back the assailants, hub were in turn ousted by a detachment of 150 Turkish troops with two guns, who destroyed the Amir’s tower in the village, and remained in occupation. * ...9 j ^ “ telegraphed to the Foreign Offlce^hat^efinhe ' t mb , a . ssador at Constantinople remen authorities to direct TurVisfr . m8tructl0ns ^d been sent to the definition of the actual frontier and o to prQBeed ^ M attitude in their negotiations with the RWH l e p Ve a . ^ len&lt; lly and conciliatory attitude displayed by the TuS Commtt Commissio »« 8 .

Even the tribes in the immediate neighbourhood of Aden showed signs of weakened %alty and decreasing respect for the British Government. On 6 th June the Resident wrote : “I do not doubt that every Chief in the protectorate is keenly watching the progress of events on the Dthala plateau, and is more or less afiected by the ascendancy which the Turks have been able to display in that quarter. Tt will not be surprising if some of them decide that it will' be better to be on what appears to be the stronger side, and should the delimitation Dually sever from the Amir any of the territory now paying him revenue our influence, already diminisbed, will, I am afraid, reach a very low ebb.’ , * v 45. At the end of June, His Majesty’s Government decided, at tbe su^es- tion of tbe Viceroy, to summon tbe Besident to London to take part°fna conference at which tbe Ambassador at Constantinople was to be present. -During General^ Maitland’s absence Colonel Abud took charge of affairs at Aden as olficiating Besident. The conference was somewhat delayed by His Majesty’s Coronation and other matters, but it met at tbe Foreign Office early con 1049 — 3in August, with the result that the various ^“^^^e^umenTTs regarding the line which should be claimed by , ., ^ re( j line* on the Amiri lioundary were cleared up, an(l it was „ ipril 1902 the map which accompanied Colonel ^ahabs despatch 7th ^pnl^^ should be provisionally accepted, suh. ect to [ l ' rtht J.™ q f y , h m k these localities. This was necessary, as owing to the action of the lurKs tnese localities had at that time been only partially visited. 46 On 18th August instructions were sent to the Charge n Constantinople in which His Majesty’s Government, after recapitolaGng the nroceedino-s of the Turks in the Amiri district, went on to say .— it is under stood that°the Turkish Commissioners seek to justify these claims that the territory occupied is by right Turkish. This, 5 view which is wholly unfounded, and from which His Majesty s Government must altogether dissent. They have never admitted that the post of Jalela, which has for some years been occupied^ a Turkish force, and some adjoim g villages which appear to recognise Turkish jurisdiction, are by right luikiS , Th^v did not, however, think it necessary to claim the evacuation of these places as a precedent to the meeting of the Commission, which was m their view intended, in the first instance, to ascertain and define the state of adairs existing at the time of its appointment. They must, however, formally protest against the acts of occupation, effected by force in some cases, which have taken place during the recent discussions, and they think it necessary to demand, betore t e work of the Commission proceeds further in this part of the frontier, that the Turkish regular troops and irregular levies shall be withdrawn from all places thus recently occupied.’’ “ This measure appears to them essential, if any success is to he attained by the Commission, and they must earnestly insist on the necessity of eate- o’orical orders being sent to this effect, and to their being effectively and com pletely carried out. In the contrary case, His Majesty’s Government would reluctantly he compelled to enter a formal protest against the attempt to decide by force questions at issue between the two Governments, and to reserve to themselves the right of taking such measures as they may deem necessary for the protection of their interests.” 47. Meantime, Sir N. O’Conor had suggested that, if the deadlock as to the Amiri border continued, the British Commissioners should he told to proceed with the delimitation of the north-eastern part of the boundary (see paragraph 28) right up to the desert, “ so as not to leave a gap for the Turks to pass behind the Yaffai country to the Hadramaut.” Directions in this sense were accordingly sent to Colonel Wahab ; hut on his inviting the Turkish Commissioners to co-operate in delimiting the border north-east of the Amiri country, they declared themselves unable to do so without special instructions from the Porte; and on his informing them that he had orders to proceed with the demarcation singly, if they refused to assist, they replied that the movement of the British Commission into either the Shairi or the Shaibi country would be regarded as a violation of the Ottoman frontier, and treated accordingly. Further, they entirely declined to recognise the Yaffai as one of the “ nine tribes ” within the British sphere and claimed the whole of their country as Turkish. Colonel Wahab reported that this claim rendered futile any proposal to continue demarcation north-eastward, and he urged the necessity for obtaining a definite and unmistakeable recognition from the Porte that the nine tribes were those enumerated iu the Governor-General of India’s despatch of 11 th April 1873, enclosed in Lord Granville’s despatch to the Ambassador at Constantinople of the 15th May 1873. * 48. On 20 th September 1902, the Secretary of State for India informed the Viceroy that His Majesty’s Ambassador had spoken very seriously to the Porte, demanding the evacuation of the places in the Amir of Dthala’s territory recently occupied by Turkish troops; also that the Yaffai should be formally recognized by Turkey as one of the nine cantons, and that the frontier of the Yaffai country north-east to the desert should he delimited. Instructions to this effect had been sent by the Grand Vizier to the Yemen officials on the 15th and Colonel Wahab was to report, as soon as possible, whether they were bein^ carried out.12 maintained that the orders as to withdrawal ^'tcordinS/lotinued 0 ^ STd did not affeot their Arab levies, w 'ich t ey 7 maintain. “ Suheb ” they affected to .^ de .^ u a ^ m T“ part of Jalela, which of the Shairi country, Jabal bhahad bm ^ th X no ; th .

The Turkish Commissioners further declined to take part in a joint survey of 'Sa£»“Zli t »'rZ iofoTmatbc .&lt; ». »» . from the existing maps on either side. 54. Colonel Wahah also reported that, in spite of the endeavours of the British Commission to establish friendly relations with their Turkish col eagu s, the attitude of the latter continued to he one of suspicion, and even _ of hostility At night the Turkish patrols were pushed out from Jalela to within a snort distance of the British camp, and by day their Arab levies watched every movement. Shots were fired at the camp on the night of the 24th November, and somewhat late a solitary unarmed sepoy having strayed out of camp towards Jalela, was fired on bv Arab levies from that place. Colonel Wahab further informed the Resident at Aden that it would be necessary to occupy Dthala with a force approximately equal to the Turkish force at Jalela, which, when reinforced by the garrisons to be withdrawn from the other posts, would amount to not less than°400 men with 4 or 5 guns, and ftie Resident telegraphed for permission to mobilize the Aden column and to purchase 1,000 camels. 55 . Colonel Wahab also proposed, in a letter to the Resident dated 16th November, that treaties should he entered into with the Yaffai-as-Safal (Upper Yaffai) and the Upper Aulaki, and on the 18th November he wrote that he did not consider it would be possible for the Commission to move to the north-east until a satisfactory understanding had been come to with the Sultans and Sheikhs of the former, for, in spite of their expressed desire for British protection, the jealousies of rival factions would make an advance into their country a very hazardous proceeding until their full support had been secured. 56. The question of treaties with these tribes had in fact been engaging the attention of the Aden Residency for some time ^Foreign department letter p as t. As far back as July 1901 the Viceroy of India t°i’ atG bt had desired the Resident* to report on the desirability 0 f concluding treaties with the Upper Yaffai (Yaffai- as-Saf^l) and Upper Aulaki, also with the minor chiefships of Bedaand Behan; and the Resident had expressed an opinion in favour of making formal agree ments with all the north-eastern tribes. It was known that the Turks had induced two leading men of the Yaffai-as-Safal to accept stipends, and though this arrangement had been repudiated by the tribe as a whole, and the persons in question had little power, the fact enabled the Turks to lay claim to the tribe. Overtures had also been made by the Turks to Behan and to the Upper Aulakis. On 26th October 1901 the Resident wrote :—“ I would strongly recommend that a treaty he concluded with the Upper Y r affai. If Government approve this, and if treaties are also concluded with the Chiefs of Beda and Behan and the Upper Anlakis, our protectorate *vould, I think, be completely secure against any serious encroachment” (in that quarter). “Disputes as to boundaries there may be until a line has been demarcated from the sea-coast to the great desert, but I should not anticipate much trouble in the case of the Upper Yaffai country.13 l!

Fitzmaunce, the Second Dragoman at the Constanti- nop e Embassy, should bo appointed to the Demarcation Commission as Joint Commissioner. It was anticipated that Mr. Fitzmaurice’s command of the Turkish language, and his experience of Turkish officials, and methods of busi ness would render him a valuable colleague to Colonel Wahab. Mr. Fitzmaurice reached Aden about the middle of November, and joined the Commission at Dtbala on the 23rd of that month. *1 tA- P', 1 , “ nd k&gt;3 . cen ? ber Majesty’s Government agreed to the escort of tlie British Commission being reinforced by a part of the small column which had been equipped at Aden, and approved of a battalion being sent from India to strengthen the Aden garrison. Sir N. O’Conor was to explain to the Porte that the object of increasing the escort was to provide the necessary support to e troops that would actually accompany the Commission while demarcation was m progress, and was in no way aggressive. The communication to the rorte was to precede any movement of troops. 59. The joint map compiled from existing maps (paragraph 53 ) was completed by the end of November, and a copy was forwarded to the Govern- ment of India during the first week in December, the original signed by both -British and Turkish Commissioners being sent direct to the India Oifice. The map w~as accompanied by a Memorandum and documents which presented the case for the boundary claimed by the British Commissioners in a very clear and complete manner. On this map the boundarv was shown by a green line which nearly coincided with the provisionally accepted red line*'of the sketch map or the previous April. The boundary claimed by the lurks was shown on the map by a blue line. The area between the lines (of very irregular shape) comprised altogether about 400 square miles of country, most of it°well populated. 60. On 4th December Colonel Wahab reported that although the Turkish regulars had been withdrawn from Jibaf and Mafari, the Turkish authorities continued to support the persons nominated by them as the Sheikhs of those places, with paid Arab levies, and that the rightful Sheikhs and their immediate adherents, who had taken refuge at Dthala, were still unable to return, and were almost in a state of destitution. On the 12 th lie wrote that the recogni tion of the Yaffai as one of the “ nine tribes” was still refused by the Turkish Commissioners. _ Until the Turkish Commission received distinct orders cn this point, and were informed that the frontier line was to run in a north-easterly direction from Lakhmat-as-Shub, between the Mares district and the Shaibi district of the Yaffai country, it would he impossible to proceed, with demarca tion to the north-east. 61. While the Turkish Commissioners thus continued to maintain an impracticable attitude, both as regards the Amir of Dthala’s country and also with respect to the north-eastern demarcation, frequent complaints were made by the Ottomcan Ambassador in London regarding the conduct of the British Commissioners. At one time it was asserted that they w T ere distributing re peating rifles to the Arabs ; at another, that they had moved to Lakhmat-as- Slmb without the consent of the Turkish Commissioners ; and again, it was said that they were preparing for an expedition ” into the Yaffai country. Further complaints were made of attacks alleged to have been made by the Subaihi con 1049— 4u tribe in the vicinity of Bab-el-Mandebon^ latter, when Straits. The former complaints were completely &gt; continua ily going on not fictitious, referred only to the ordmayp y ^ ^ Turks and ourselves between tribes who are hereditary enemies, are equally powerless to prevent. 62.

The present situation (unchanged by the withdrawal of the Turkish regulars from Jabal Jibaf and Jabal Mafari) was that the Tories had drawn a line from Jabal Mafari round by the Kharba ridge to Ja ela and thence south-east by Jabal Shahad, a line which they made us respect by force; that is to say, the situation contemplated, and suggested, by Lord Duffenn in 1886 had been reversed to our disadvantage. Any one found m proximity to the line was at ouce fired on by the Turks or their levies, action which they explained as necessitated by their rules of field service (reglement de campagne) ; in other words, they considered the present state as one of war, and not ot friendly negotiations. 63 Mr. Fitzmaurice tben explained tbe unfortunate position of the Amir, who was deprived of a large portion of his revenue, and threatened with the perma nent loss of two-thirds of his territory, notwithstanding the repeated assurances of the Porte that that territory would be respected. “ The disastrous effect of the failure of this Commission to afford him the measure of protection he claims has reacted on the neighbouring units of the nine tribes, and the Commission’s recent dealings with the Yaffai have shown clearly that they have been un favourably influenced by the events of the current year, thus rendering the task of delimitating their boundary much more difficult than it would otherwise have been. The basis of friendship and loyalty to us of the nine tribes is their detest ation of oppressive Turkish misrule, as seen in Yemen, and their dread of its extension to their own territory ; but during the last year they have seen but the apparent strength of the Turks, and the apparent weakness of the British, and they dread the result of openly committing themselves to what may prove to be the weaker side.” Mr. Pitzmaurice went on to recommend the immediate reinstatement of the Amir in the territory from which he had been excluded by the Turks during the past year, and with regard to the point of departure for the north-east demarcation, he showed that it must he near the village of Lakhmat-as-Shub, but that it could only he accurately determined when the Commission had arrived there and obtained complete freedom of movement. He finally stated his opinion that the source of all present and past trouble was the Turkish military occupation of the village of Jalela. “ The difficulty of proceeding to Lakhmat-as-Shub would vanish were the Turkish forces withdrawn from that place to Kataba, and this would also lead to an almost automatic settlement of the Jabal Jihaf and Jabal Mafari questions, and indeed of the whole Amiri difficulty 64. The Aden column (paragraph 58) started for Dthala on the 2nd January 1903.

His Excellency said:—“ Everv rcr»rp« 3 pnfQfim a v, itherto made has been endorsed by Mr. Fitzmaurice’s report; and our?tron» recommendation is that we should use the present opportunity to Tettle the main question, and not merely minor and petty issues. There will bo peace on the Dthala border whilst the Turkish occupation south of Kataba continues. The green line on Wahab’s map of 2 nd December is supported bv powerful arguments and strongly advocated by Mr. Pitzmaurice, audit seems tons that we are now justified in demanding its acceptance as the frontier We emphatically urge that the political pivot of the whole question is the Dthala wdl bTyffinelesT SettlemeQt which leaves its futu ^ “ protracted doubt 69. Almost at the same time the British Ambassador at Coustantinonle succeeded in obtaining another Irade from the Sultan. On the 21 st January Sir IV O Conor telegraphed to Mr. Fitzmauriee that the following demands had been agreed to by the Sultan s aemands “ (1) Yaffai to he considered one of the nine cantons. “ (2) Irregular levies to be withdrawn. “ (3) Authority of Amir, as exercised in October 1901, not to be disturbed. “ (4) Delimitation north-eastward from Lakhmat-as-Shub to the desert frontier.” He added, however, that the instructions to the Yemen authorities fell short as usual of the agreement, hut that nevertheless they mHht help the The orders actually telegraphed by the Porte to the Turkish Commissioners appear to have been as follows ^ First .—That the irregular levies were to be disbanded.16 Secondly. —That while any alteration of the pr^status of thejour evacuated points was to be reserved for q Dthala were the two Governments, the existing rights ot the Amir oi not to be interfered with- Thirdly, —The Yaffai were to he recognized as indue e ainon., nine cantons, but disputed tracts were to be reserved. Fourthly. —The Commissioners were to proceed with the ' eiimi a ion north-eastward to the desert. 70. The actual results obtained by this Irade were the disappearance of the Arab levies and the recognition of the Yaffai as one o the the latter was neutralized for donmrcation pmposes ^ he ^ ^^^atioii ^orth — ^ Tuban Saten and Dabiani, which are also Yaffai territory though the in- Imbhaits are Tot Yaftai tribesmen. The Turkish Commissioners refused to recognise either the Shaibi, or any of the other places 3 ust named as Yaffa^ al WinTthat they were integral parts of the Turkish districts of Kataba and Rada. ° Their claims to the Shaihi country appeared to rest on a T ® r y ^“poraiy occunation which was brought to an end by their expulsion at the hands ot the Sbaibi themselves; while from the other places the? had ^t times extmt d snmp revenue as they bad done from Ahmadi, Mebrabi and other tribes wn c have mucMhe samerelation with the Amiri as Nawa, Juban, &amp;c., have with the Yaffai. 71 . Early in Eebruary His Majesty’s Government agreed to the despatch nf additional troops to Aden as proposed by the Viceroy. Ihe normal garrison o Aden consists of one British battalion (only 600 strong), one Native battalion, a company of Sappers (Natives), three companies of Royal Garrison Artillery, and the ^ Aden Troop ” of 50 Indian horsemen, and 50 camel sowars. Ihe garrison had been temporarily increased by a battalion and a halt of Native Infa ^» but on the other band, nearly half a battalion bad been sent over to Somaliland. The Native Mountain Battery mentioned in paragraph 64 had by this time landed and was^on its way to Dthala with a small escort. The reinforcements from India consisted of the 1st Battalion, Hampshire Regiment, at full strength (about 900 rifles), No. 6 British Mountain Battery, and half of the l2ord rifles (Native Infantry), the head-quarter wing of which regiment was already m Aden. The Government of India were prepared to send more Native Infantry, but the Resi dent, in view of the difficulty of feeding troops in the hinterland of Aden, and of the expense involved, thought that the extra half battalion would suffice Ihe 1st Battalion, Dublin Eusiliers, who, under ordinary circumstances, would have crone to England on relief by the Hampshires, were retained, and no time was lost in settin 0 * them in motion for Dthala, together with the Mountain Battery and the 123rd rifles. Careful arrangements were necessary on account ot the nature of the country, and the scarcity of water in some places, which obliged the troops to march in a succession of small bodies. 72 . A strong detachment, with guns, was also placed at Dar Akkam, between Nobat Dakim and Musemir, in order to check a possible advance of Turkish troops from Taiz, where there was a considerable garrison. 73 Meantime, Lord Lansdowne had telegraphed to the Charge d’Afraires at Constantinople instructing him to inform the Turkish Minister of Eoreign Affairs that His Majesty’s Government could not tolerate any further prolong ation of the existing situation on the frontier between the nine cantons and Yemen The British Commissioner, it was stated, had been directed to demand compliance with the conditions which had already been accepted by the Sultan (see paragraph 69 ) and which were now repeated and emphasized. In the event of these conditions not being punctually fulfilled, it would he necessary for His Majesty’s Government to make use of force in order to restore order, and to re-assert the authority of the Amir of Dthala in the territory now in dispute.17 by His'Majesty’^Gov-^nment M^ the i n f?T atio11 whi &lt;* been received by the Tarkish Government and H e t . battah °“ s f? e beia g sent to Yemen be conveyed to the Porte that British w eS , ram coaol uded with an intimation to would proceed, if necessmv'l ®^^^^^ 11 Th' Wa ? to Aden ’ and Intrepid from the Meditemnean i ^°i! j' ■ d l , u cruisers Rermione to Aden, fed they arrived thTre Twl thl had m c facfc beei1 despatched , proceeding. 7 m 'e« there while the movement of troops to Dthala was with In aAuale'^o'rto ^e^in'^eX-Th'e f° W ^ ab to P roeeed - had placed garrisons had beeTcXleTelv evaclted° and P ' Vbere ‘ be Turks likely to interfere with the rights of the AmA of Dthala ^Thi/d^ Commission was to proceed to Lakhmat-as-Shub and to call upon the Tn-Vh Commission to meet them, but the camp of the Turkish Commk io^, ! be at some point outside of the line claimed by the British Co.mSiloners comp'L C e OD wr\S b rnlionI° n :U 7 tt ’ZTW “ de “»^ promised to disband their TeLTte^J^ tbe^uThoX'f tfe Amir, and to withdraw to tho neighbourhood of i i i ’ i ^ garrison of Jalela would be reduced to about 50 men.

The Turkish nominee had lied some days before and was said to be trying to raise the tribes on the Turkish side of the border' m which endeavour he was receiving assistance from our old enemy, Muhammad Wasir Mukbil. The fourth place “ Suheb,” or Jabal Shahad, was to be evacuated when the Turkish Commission withdrew to Kataba. In the mean time, the Amir regained possession of bis territories, and supplies began to reach the British camp from the Amiri country, from which it had been for so lono* cut off. ^ / 8 . The Amir of Dthala now earnestly begged for the delimitation of his border before the Commission moved away elsewhere, and his request was strongly supported by the British Commissioners, and by the Resident. Lord Curzon had already urged His Majesty’s Government to the same course, point ing out that the Dthala plateau was the key of the whole question (paragraph 68 ). The Resident also reminded His Majesty’s Government that until we had bound the Yaffai and other tribes to us by some formal engagement, deli mitation to the north-east must necessarily involve risk, especially so long as the Turks remained in occupation of Jalela. 79. On 7 th or 8 th March, the last detachment of the reinforcements from Aden reached Dthala, where a month’s supplies for the force had also been accumulated. The whole movement was carried out, without a hitch, in live weeks from the date on which the order to collect camels was receive! in Aden. The total strength of the troeps on the Dthala plateau, after the completion of con 1049—518 O-. nr» QfV\ Mnroh the Resident, with the approval of His Majesty’s ants of the village a declaration against oemg nanueu over iu lu« - xraiiKs, - ana there were other indications that an eftort was being made by the local officials to upset the status quo which had just been restored. Possibly they still hoped to force the hand of their Government and to bring about a conflict, m which they thouo-ht that they might be victorious. Mr. Eitzmaurice was, however, con fident that an actual resort to force would he unnecessary, and his expectations proved correct, for on the 18th March an Irade was issued in which His Majesty the Sultan, while reserving his sovereign rights, decreed the evacuation of Jalela and the commencement of demarcation in accordance with the line marked on the map signed by the respective Commissioners. 82. The orders telegraphed by the Grand Vizier to Abdulla Pasha, now acting Governor of Yemen, were as follows :—“ The following decision has been sanctioned by Imperial IrateTo proceed with delimitation, in accordance with confiomration of the land, of the line shown by the British Commission on the joint map ; to evacuate the locality of Jalela, situated within the limits of that line. When the delimitation on the spot is being carried out, a point will be fixed at the commencement of the desert, and you will stop there. At once give orders to the Commission to carry out these orders to the letter. Use your efforts to conclude this matter satisfactorily as soon as possible.” 83. The removal of Muhammad Nasir Mukbil from the frontier was also ordered* and the Ambassador was informed that instructions would shortly be issued for the dismissal of the Governor of Taiz for his conduct at Jalela. 84. Jalela was evacuated by the Turks on the night of the 21st March and the* Turkish Commission withdrew to Kataba. Thirteen months had thus been consumed in arriving at a position in which demarcation was possible. The real work of delimitation, with its attendant difficulties, less serious indeed than those which had been overcome, but still sufficiently troublesome, was now about to commence. 119 85. The British Commission moved to the neiehhnnrlirv^ ^ &lt;a * place about two miles to the south of Kataba, as soon as possible 1 after the withdrawal of the Turks from Jalela. It was hoped that tL Iradd of 18th March 1903, which accepted the green line as the basis of delimitation nnfhe Amm border and the complete retirement of the Turks from Amiri territo^r W ih t Ve i • i 6 ? Tm 1 '- 7 , followed by the commencement of demarca ioZ’ Uni 6 ,!? 51 °rn l ° ffielal f- thou K h compelled to give way, were b^no means totally defeated. The first step on our side was of couinp fn „ mean s survey of the zone of delimitation, and it was’ at once Sdertaken 0 ^.^ result that the map constructed from all available sources (para-ranhs 13 and 59) in which the country along the border had been inserted from mtteriS furnished by the Turks, was found to he so incorrect that the “ green line ” could not be applied to the ground as it actually existed.* This afforded the Turkish Commissioners an opportunity for fresh objections and references though on minor points. rererences, ^ fi 8 ( tviI’ th0 situati ^ in the tribal territory lying to the north-east of the Dthala plateau was such that survey in that direction, although now agreed to by the Turks, could not be proceeded with. The treaties with the north-eastern tribes (paragraph 56) were sanctioned by His Majesty’s Govern ment in May 1903, but when the Resident began to take the necessary preliminary measures, unexpected difficulties were encountered. It had already been discovered that the Turkish officials, not excepting the Delimitation Com missioners, had been active in extending Turkish influence among the Yaffai- as-Safal and other tribes, with whom, although included in the British sphere of influence, we had not as yet entered into definite engagements. In February 1903 Colonel Wahab had reported that the Turkish Commissioners had appealed to the Yaffai, as Muhammadans, not to side with the English infidels, and a con vincing proof of this assertion was forthcoming in an original better from Zakaria Bey, the “ Kaimmakam ” or Sub-Governor of Kataba,°and a member of the Turkish Commission. The letter was addressed to Nakib Ali Askar, Sheikh of the Mausatta, the most powerful section of the Yalfai-as-Safah and it appealed to the religious feelings of the tribesmen in most inflammatory terms. Similar letters, it appeared, had been sent by Zakaria Bey to other Yaffai Sheikhs, and it was discovered that several Turkish agents had been active in this propaganda, among them the Turkish nominee at Lakhmat-as-Saleh (para graph 41), who was a Say ad, and therefore possessed of some religious influence, also the irrepressible Muhammad Nasir Mukbil. On receiving this inform ation, backed by a vigorous representation from Lord Curzon, the Marquis of Lansdowne directed the Charge d’Affaires at Constantinople to make a strong protest to the Porte against the action of the Turkish Commissioners. The protest was made, and the re-call of Zakaria Bey demanded, at the same time that Muhammad Nasir Mukbil’s presence on the frontier was complained of. Zakaria Bey was actually dismissed from the Turkish Commission, and from his post at Kataba, in April. He disappears from the scene from this date, and about the same time Muhammad Nasir Mukbil was removed from his district and sent to Sana under escort. But the intrigues of these persons, and their appeals to the latent fanaticism of the tribes, had already had no small effect, and it was evident that a certain anti-British influence was at work. This specially showed itself in the chiefship of Beda, where, though the Chief himself asked for a treaty, a section of the tribe headed by Ali bin Ahmad, who was also the actual administrator, stood out. There was also some hesitation on the part of the Aulaki Chiefs and of Behan-al-Kasab, a dependency of the Upper Aulaki Sultan of Nisab, and the negotiations were somewhat protracted. With regard to the Yaffai-as-Saf41, however, greater success was obtained ; and after some trouble, satisfactory treaties with the Dthubi and Mausatta sections of this tribe were concluded in May and July, respectively. Treaties were subsequently made with the Muflahi, Shaibi and Hadthrami sections, and with Sultan Kahtan, who is the titular Chief of the whole tribe. ° This Sana is a small village near -which the Turks had a customs post. It must not be confounded with the town of the same name, which is the capital of Yemen, and far to the north.—P. J. M. \87. Meantime, the British Commission, enable to commence t ^ line tion ot the Amiri frontier, o'-ng to the im^os^.W^of^pp^^ to ^ t ^ e to the ground as it was actual y Taffai lyin 0, immediately to the herder of the Shaibi tribe, a section J a ^ t ly int S the Shaibi country, east and north-east of Dthala. ^ ^ ^ j i ac |- an( i for some time no with a small escort, was, however £ th ’ 0 Amir i borderland was progress was made, except that the su y tho coun t r y on the scale proceeded with.

Questions also arose of considerah^intere^ ^y^iTon^T an! the levy of oustoms y e ' . ^ cr0 ssed by a practicable route. ft e waffLnd 0 IaUhe'at“ imposed by the Turks were Uian were ^ Tot necessary to go into the details. 89 In August the Resident returned to Dthala, where his presence seemed to he required In fact, he would have gone there some months earlier b ut the business connected with the treaties which kept him m Aden The Boundary Commissioners at once drew his attention to the delay which had taken in obtaining a survey of the Shaibi border, and asked him if he could make arrangements' forcarrying it through without further delay. At this time the • + tfon as regarded the north-eastern part of the frontier was one of no little difficulty The misfortunes which had befallen Brigadier-General Manning s expedition against the Somaliland Mullah had been recounted, with oriental exag- geration among all the Arab tribes, and had come opportunely to assist the effect of”the intrigues already related. It was believed by many that the British forces 1 ad been practically annihilated, and that there were no more troops available in India to continue the contest; in fact, the general belief among the more ignorant Arabs of the interior was that the British were nearly at the end S thei? resources. These reports received a sort of confirmation from the fact that 600 infantry, hastily sent over from Aden, on the demand ot the War Office, when affairs were at their worst, were retained in Somaliland, and that a cora- nany of Bombay Sappers and Miners (about 150 men) was now removed from Dthala and sent to Berbera. The effect of these withdrawals of troops, following on the Mullah’s successes, was unfortunate, and went far to neu tralize the impression produced by the evacuation of Jalela, which was a diplo- matic rather than a military success, and which had been procured, it was said, by the payment of large sums at Constantinople 1 90. Moreover, the Yaffai-as-Safal, who are a powerful tribe, had suffered much less from the incursions and exactions of the Turks than the Amiri and other weak and less warlike clans. Though glad as a whole to he formally received into the British protectorate, circumstances had imbued them with the idea that their alliance was of peculiar value to the British, and that the survey of their border was absolutely essential to the carrying out of the British policy. Bor this privilege, they, especially the Mausatta, thought they would be able to make us pay large sums of money. 91 The Sheikhs of the Mausatta claimed the Shaibi as their dependants, but when appealed to to ensure the peaceful progress of the survey party through the Shaibi country, they acted in a manner which showed that they were by no means eager to afford assistance. It was soon evident that any I21 would have to be Mdertak^Hho^tthe goods'll of tTe^Mausatt ’’''s'l”',’,/ among the Yaffai sections, and partly on accounf Tth^ Tuik' j f lousies to create a party hostile to the TWJ«h q if ^ Turkish endeavours serious rival il fte peln of h s brotwLmu'v^ 86 ) had a receipt of Turkish pay and was 11 TT , bl ? 0mar ’ who had been in He had once already driven KaL n m 1 ° f l 11 ® P ro - Turkis h party, the latter had turnedttm tables onhLandreSstawlt^ t , h ° U = h moving about the Yaffai country with a small follow?™ „ Saleh was opportunities of doing mischief. following, on the look-out for sfAtstscTzrs %i c c; ompany had been withdrawn, as already stated, and the 2 nd Battalion Dublin lusihers (originally only 600 strong) had been diminished by invaliding &amp;c unti no more than 400 rifles remained with the Head-Quarters. Besides the Dublins, there were at Dthala about 300 of the 1 st Bitlfllmn TTarwrvoi-.' regiment, and 550 ot* the 123rd Rifles (Native Infantry) • also No 6 Mountain Battery and two 7-poundei camel ^ lit fe^o e 1,200 infantry and eight mountain guns. This was by no means a lai-e force m the circumstances, and owing to the retention in Somaliland of °the 600 nfantry sent over at a time of alarm (paragraph 89), no reinforcements could be sent up from Aden, without unduly diminishing the garrison of that place^ Further, the attitude of some of the tribes on the line of communication T t0 , u ^ asme ® s » and was necessary to keep two or three hundred Native Infantry at the posts on the road, for the protection of convoys and travellers between Nobat Dakim and Dthala. J 93 93. It had already been found necessary to send a small column into the country of the Ahl Abdulla, one of a group of tribes known collectively as the AI Ajud. Ihese elans acknowledge the suzerainty of the Amir of Dthala but are not much under his control. They inhabit the hilly country between the Wadi Hard aba, up which goes the road to Dfchala, and the middle course of the narrow valley of the river Bana. Their position on the flank of the Dthala road gives them an importance they would not otherwise possess. The obiective of the column was the village of Dthabra, the people of which had been concerned m several petty attacks on travellers and small convoys. The village was reached after slight resistance, and its towers and principal houses destroyed The troops afterwards returned to Dthala, by another road, without encountering an enemy. This was in May, and since then the Ahl Abdulla had been quiet, but the Kotaibi, who are the strongest of the Al Ajud clans, were givino- trouble over the collection of dues from passing caravans. This was an ancient source of difficulty. Many years before it had been decided that the Kotaibi had no right to enforce the payment of dues by persons travelling on the Dthala road, and some punishment had even been inflicted on them ; but owino* to the inactivity which had been imposed on the Residents of Aden, of late years, by the complaints of the Turks at every movement made outside of Aden itself, the matter had been allowed to drop, and the Kotaibi Chief collected money from traders and others using the road, without let or hindrance; nor would the Resident now have interfered, owing to the importance of keeping the country quiet while the Boundary Commission was in it, had not the Sheikh greatly increased the payments he exacted, refused to visit either the Resident or his suzerain the Amir, and behaved with insolence towards caravans bringin 0 * supplies to the troops. He was, therefore, informed that his right to levy dues was not recognised, and that the practice must cease. -To oblige the Kotaibi to^ comply, and to protect the road where it is adjacent to their country, a military post was established at the village of Sulek, and garrisoned by 80 Native Infantry under a British Officer. The posts at Nobat Dakim and Hardaba were also strengthened. con 1049—6mam** t 22 94. All the troops originally posted at j^ ar ^Jafela! on aooolnt ofthr^nheS: Clothe ^lac^nd ofly a small post of observation was ““^“rd to ^ «* 'Z Sn g r well populated, but very little food and not much forage, can be got out oi it. ^ 96 After some deliberation, the Resident determined that it would be 96.

The treaty entered into wU^tlufMausatta would prevent the Sheikhs of that section from openly dis- nlavinf annoyance, and certainly from taking any active part against us , wXthe ShJibi themselves, though disunited, and quarrelling among them selves, were, on the whole, too much interested in the demarcation to o er opposition to an armed force. 97 On 31st August, the survey party, and an escort of 100 British Infantry, 100 Native Infantry, and two mountain guns, rendezvoused at Kballa, a viUa-e on the east side of the Dthala plain about 12 miles from that place bv road The next day they ascended to Awabil, a Shaibi village near the ed&lt;4 Of the hills overlooking Dthala. The people were generally friendly and survey operations were commenced at once On the 4th beptember, how ever a small party was unexpectedly fired at by the people of a village called Hadera and most unfortunately a native surveyor was killed. Captain Warne- ford Political Officer, with several Shaibi Sheikhs and some troops, pro ceeded at once to the spot, and the village towers were blown up without resistance, the people having already fled. The survey of the Shaibi border was then completed without further trouble, and the survey party with its pseort proceeded to cross the Bana river, which is the boundary of the Shaibi country After a most difficult march they halted at Rubiaten, a village and small district, which, with three other small districts called Juban, Nawa, and Dabiani, belongs to the family of Sultan Kahtan, and to the Mausatta Sheikhs The people are dependants of the Yaifai and the districts are clearly included in the territory of the tribe. The inhabitants were very friendly, and the survey party was able to do good work at this place. On the day the escort reached Rubiaten, a military post of 200 infantry and two camel guns was established at Awabil, under the command of Captain Shewell, 123rd Rifles, to maintain communication with Dthala. 98. Reports were now received that Saleh bin Omar, the brother and rival of Sultan Kahtan, with a following variously stated at from 1,000 to 2 000 men, was making for Rubiaten with intent to attack the survey party and detachment there. On the afternoon of 12 th September Captain Warneford heliographed from Rubiaten that Saleh bin Omar, with at least 1,000 men had crossed the Bana and was in the Shaibi country. As the survey party and its escort might find itself in an awkward position, if attacked in the very difficult country about the Bana, or if the enemy interposed bet ween it and Awabil, General Maitland moved out the following morning with 300 of the Dublin Fusiliers and four guns of No. 6 Mountain Battery. It was impossible to reach Awabil in one march from Dthala on account of the distance aud the long and difficult ascent to that place, but on arriving there on the 14th it was found that the Yaffai gathering had attacked Captain Shewell’s post the previous morning, and had been smartly repulsed with a loss of about 20 killed and mauy wounded, our casualties being one man of the Hampshires killed, and four soldiers and sepoys wounded. It was after-i —? v ' i, / &gt; 23 wards ascertained that Saleh hin n,v.o« a-a but all the other leaders of the pro-Turkish ^ , aocom P an y the gathering, it, and at least two members of the familv of P rh ty TiT PP ° ar t0 ha ' r0 j° ined present at the engagement one of wh^ 7 f the ^ausatta Sheikhs were gathering seems to fare numbered about 1 anrf 8 w ? unded sey erely.

Colonel Wahab replied that Buhl a ten was as an appanage of the Sultan of Yaffai, and as such wall a part of the Yaffai canton , and covered by the Trade of 13th February. Nevertheless the survey party had to be withdrawn, and the attempt to proceed north-eastward has not, up to the time ot writing (June 1904), been renewed. As regards the Shaibi boundary, however, the result of the expedition was satisfactory a C f wW if a T i r -T n d 011 lst Se P tember that an agreement had been arrived at with the Turkish Commissioners, and that actual demarcation would probably commence very shortly. piuudoiy lOl- On the nth October 1903 the first boundary pillar was erected on the Shaibi border near the Bana river, demarcation beiug thus commenced two years after it had been proposed by the Porte, and exactly a year and eight months after the first meeting of the British and Turkish Commissions at Dtliala in February 1902 (paragraph 27). The officer nominally in oharo- e of the Turkish surveys, by name Zia Effendi, apparently one of the extreme’ and fanatical party, made various attempts to obstruct the progress of the delimitation, but happily without much effect, and the relations between the Commissions were on the whole more cordiai than they had been at any previous period. On the 14th October the delimitation of the Shaibi border from the Bana river t° a point near the village of A1 Ukla was completed, and the British and lurkish Commissioners returned to their camps near Sanah and Kataba respectively (paragraph 85). * , T , T , 02 - A t ‘’'e time, however. Colonel Wahab reported that the Sheikhs of Rubiaten had been summoned by the Turkish authorities at Rada, to whose ‘kaza, or district, it was asserted that they belonged, in order to answer for their having received the British survey party. In event of refusal, Turkish troops were to be sent into Rubiaten to punish them. This necessitated another representation by the Ambassador at Constantinople, which produced a promise from the Porte that the people of Rubiaten should not be molested However, the position of Rubiaten and the adjacent districts still remained' undecided. ‘ 103 103. In the meanwhile, His Majesty’s Government had decided on account ol the difficulties likely to be encountered in carrying out the demar cation of the north-eastern portion of the frontier up to the desert, and the consequent delay in the settlement of the Amiri border, which was the most essential part of the whole, that the north-eastern demarcation should be post poned, a notification being made to the Turkish Government of the tribes -rnd sub-tribes (or districts) The difficulty • iu making claimed as being on the British side of the line, any notification with respect to the tribes and*24 districts lying beyond the Rubiaten gronp^wa^ tbat^the a sur7 ey unsurveved, and our knowledge of * , ^rwh fho Resident and the of somekind or other was therefore amportant survey of British Boundary Commissioners thought that a r before any ij 3 &lt; JJwjg. —&gt; - it should be carried out under the orders of the Resident.

The nTrtv was CntoCrk along the Behan and Beda borders until &gt; could ioin its survey to that already executed (paragraph 97). This plan involved, of course a certain amount of risk, as the distance from Aden was great, and the nartv’would have to depend for their security on tribal escorts; but the danger was not very great, and the attempt was justified by the importance attached to a settlement of the north-eastern frontier. 105 ' With regard to the Amiri frontier, Sir Nicholas O’Conor telegraphed, on 19th October, that an Irade had been issued at Constantinople accepting the sreen line on the revised map submitted by the Commissioners as the result of a proper survey of the borderland (paragraphs 85 and 87), and demarcation was commenced on the 27 th or 28th, beginning at a place called Lakhmat-ad- Duki as there was still some difficulty about the line in the neighbourhood of Kataba The large scale survey was now continued down the Tiban valley to Tusan or Tisan, where the stream of that name, flowing from the west, enters the Tiban not many miles from where the Haushabi border commences on Jabal War^wa. 106. While tbe Commission was pursuing its work, as well as tbe difficulties raised by the Turks would allow, certain events took place, which, though not directly connected with the demarcation, deserve a place in the narrative. The 1st Battalion Dublin Busiliers (paragraph 92) had been ordered to embark at Aden for England at the end of October. They were to he relieved by the 1st Battalion of the Buffs from India, who came over about 900 strong. The Resident took advantage of the movement of the Dublins down the road to direct a small column to attack the village of Nakhlen, belonging to the Dthambari tribe, and situated within the outer hills of the Radfan range. This place was a nest of robbers, from which parties frequently issued to molest travellers on the roads leading to Dthala. Several outrages had been committed hv the people of Nakhlen on the line of communications, and they had even gone so far as to seize the post of the column at Dthala, and to scatter the contents of the hags. The detachments detailed to attack Nakhlen were 200 of the Dublins, about 80 of the 102nd Grenadiers, two guns of No. 6 Mountain Battery and two camel guns, the whole being placed under the command of Lieut.-Colonel English of the Dublins. The operation involved a march of 18 miles from Hardaba to a camp between Dar Shibanand As Suk, the nearest spot to Nakhlen where water could he found.outside the hills, and a further inarch of nearly 10 miles on the following morning to Nakhlen itself. The advance of the troops was opposed from the moment they approached the hills, but the village was reached without a check, and its towers destroyed. After the men and animals had been watered and obtained a brief rest, the column commenced its return march. As often happens on such occasions, the enemy26 in tbe field against us, and the attitude of f’? away to 1 the Sana, one of defiance.

Mr. Bury was received with due respect, and an escort under the Sultan’s brother was detailed to accompany the par y far as the Fadthli territory extended. 121 From Shugra, a pass winds up through the coast ranges to the Wadi Nahain and tTplain of Misbal. The latter is the last of the Fadthh Sultan’s actual territory. ? Beyond is the district of Dathma, some of the tribes m which are under the Fadthli’s influence, and the territory of the Audillah tribe, whose Sultan lives at Loder, but whose country is the high range, known as the Khor Audillah, which is a continuation of the scarp of the great plateau of Yemen, and here runs roughly east and west at a distance of about 3 o or 40 miles from the coast line. The passes of the Khor Audillah are steep and rugged. 1 ley give access to the Dahr plateau, which is the country of the Azzam a tribe belonoing to Beda. Beyond this is the Upper Aulaki country and the town of NisaK and beyond that again is the great desert. Behan-al-Kasah lies north west of IS isab and is also hounded by the desert. The distance from Shugra to the Khor Audillah is about 75 miles by road. To IS isab would be about 125 miles and to Behan-al-Kasab 185 miles. Once across the Khor Audillah, there was little doubt that the x^arty would reach Nisab and the Behan irontier in safety. Unfortunately, there were signs of trouble soon after leaving the Wadi Nahain. Mr. Bury had elected to go by Loder, though the latter is some what ofl the direct route, as certain of the Uathina clans were known to be untrustworthy. From bis camp at A1 Jauf, six miles short of Loder, he sent in to apprise the Sultan of his arrival and to ask for an escort. The Audillah Snltan, however, who was believed to be perfectly friendly, refused to receive the party. This was rather serious, but, on the other hand, certain of the neighbouring Arabs came in and willingly undertook to assist in the protection of the camp, and Mr. Bury was hopeful of being able to proceed in a day or two. In the afternoon, however, an attack was made by^ about 200 of the Saidi tribe, who advanced singing as if to pay a ceremonial visit. The attack was met by the friendly Arabs, and the Saidis obliged to retire. By a strange fatality, however, one of tbe native surveyors was struck and killed by a chance shot, fired at very long range. This so affected Mr. Claudius and the remainder of the party that they declined to proceed any further, and Mr. Bury had perforce to bring the party back to Aden. 122 . Tbe whole affair caused the Besident some surprise, as it was not anticipated that the party would be placed in any difficulties before they reached the frontier and commenced their survey operations.

Another column consisting of three companies of the Buffs, two companies of 1-Mrd Native’infantry and four camel guns, was formed at Aden under the com mand of Maior Bavenhill of the Buffs. It was to enter the Subaihi coun y Tt Am Riia, and meet the Boundary Commission in the neighbourhood ot Dar-al-Kudaimi. This force was styled the “ Subaihi Column, _ and it was intended to fulfil the functions of the original “.Aden Column . as soon as the Boundary Commission had advanced far enough into the Snbaihi country. 129. Arrangements were also made for improving the water-supply at Am Riia and elsewhere for holding the line of communications, and for rein forcing the active columns, if necessary. The Subaihi Sheikhs were given elearlv to understand that if they behaved well and assisted the Commission, the customarv rewards for such service would not be wanting, but that it they displayed hostility, they would assuredly be attacked at once with every man available. 130. Meantime, in order to expedite work of demarcation, it was agreed hetween the British and Turkish Commissioners that the scale of the border survey should he reduced from 1—40,000 to 2 miles to 1 inch. This would enable the British survey party to progress more quickly, and also to cover a larger area of ground. The final maps will, therefore, include hitherto unsurveyed tracts on the Turkish side, and will thus be of value to the Turkish officials as well as to our own.msm mmmm m 32 Boundary Commission came into communioationAden on under Major Ravenhill (paragraph 12s), ^ on the 8 th, ready 4th February, and was in position nea th hil i s i n t 0 the more open to receive the Commission on its em ff* n f,7 r m a “' timce if necessary.

They also needed a considerable e^rt on accost of the uncertain temper of the tribes on their side of the line. It was hoped that something would be bea«-d of them at^Am T'arsha but no news of their movements was obtainable at that place. Alter a halTof threTdays, during which the survey work was pushed on as much as r^nssihle the British Commission moved to a spot on the Wadi Madm, to waxen they have gi^n the name of Kuhian. It is situated about 8 miles from Bar- al-Kndaimi. The latter, it maybe explained, is a tower and hamlet situated at the point where the road from Aden and Lahej, via Am Bga, deseends irom the high sand desert to the wide valley of the Madm The bubaihi column had, in the meantime, established itself at Khatabia, about 2J miles north-west of Dar- al-Kudaimi, where there was a fairly good supply of water, hollowing up t e broad dry water-course from this camping ground a ride of about o miles brings one to running water in the bed of the Wadi, and then for about two miles its banks are lined with palm groves and irrigated cultivation, among which appear many towers and small villages. The view advancing up the Wadi with the dark and frowning heights of Jabal Kalla and the mam range as a background, is extremely picturesque. Kuhian appears to be the name of one of the hamlets among the palm groves, but the whole place is well known by the name oi Ghnil Madin (ghail being the Arabic for a running stream). 17 1S7. At Ghail Madin the valley is broken by spurs from the hills and a low rid°e running parallel to the Wadi. A few miles higher up it contracts to a p'or°'e, above which is the village and fort of Mufalis, belonging to the Atwan tribe, who acknowledge the Turks. Here the valley is again wider, and there are houses and fields. The main watercourse comes from the north-west, from the Makhtari country, but several large and inhabited glens also run down into the Wadi from the north-east, and its catchment basin must be a very large one. The people of this country, or some of it, have at times been regarded as within the British sphere of inhuence, but we have never had regular dealings with them, and the Commission, considering that they were not Subaihis, did not believe itself justified in claiming them as included in the “ nine cantons.” 138 . A trade route from Taiz to Aden comes down through the Atwari country/by Mufalis, and through the gorge below, to Ghail Madin, Dar-al- Kudaimi, and Am Bija. It is known as the “ Mufalis route,” and would probably be more used but for the predatory nature of the Subaihis, who cannot refrain from plundering the traders who venture along it. r ■ i rEija an th. 3rd.

An unexpected effect of the decisive tone adopted by the British Commission was that the representatives of one of the Humedi sections came into the Commission camp and asked to be taken under British protection! 148. On 7th April the British Commission broke up their camp at Sanawi, and marched to Khatabia, arranging to meet the Turkish Commissioners in the Wadi Adim on the border between the Brremi Subaihis and the Zureki. The column was to remain for a few days longer at Kuhlan. The question of the Wadi Shab remained unsettled for the present, but there had already been great delay, and a month of comparatively cool weather had slipped by, leaving but a few weeks more in which it was possible for British troops to remain in the field. 149. The movement westwards was somewhat impeded by the loss of about 130 camels, whose drivers contrived to get away from Commission camp on the eve of their departure from Sanawi. These camelmen (mostly from the Amiri and Haushabi districts) disliked going further away from their own country, and professed to believe that they were about to be taken into desert tracts where there was neither water nor forage, and in which their animals would perish. The column lent 130 camels to the Commission, and efforts were made to make up the deficiency from Aden, but there was considerable difficulty in doing this, as no camel owners would go willingly into a country which w 7 as little known, and of bad reputation, while there w T as everywhere a dearth of forage owing to the failure of last year’s rains. Moreover, the weather had now become verv hot. 150. Nevertheless, on 12th April, the British Commission and its escort reached Mijza, on the Buremi border, having passed the Wadi Adim without getting news of the Turks. The troops under Major Havenhill had in the meantime moved to Am Sayyelah, wdiere there was a good supply of w 7 ater. The Commission and the protecting column had now reached a point from which they could no longer be conveniently supplied from Aden, and the difficulty of supply would be greatly increased as each successive march took them further away. Preparation had, therefore, been made to form a base on the sea at Bas Arab, about 70 miles west of Aden, where there is a fairly good anchorage and a convenient landing place, well sheltered from the north-east monsoon, which blows strongly all along the southern coast of Arabia from October till May. It had also been arranged that, when the British Commission had fairly entered the western Subaihi country, with its scanty population, the Subaihi column should be released, and the escort of the Commission reduced by the guns and detachment of British Infantry which had been added to it before it left the Haushabi border (paragraph 128 ). % 151. The heat was so great that British artillery and infantry could no longer be kept in the field without risking serious loss of life, and the plan above mentioned was accordingly carried out without further delay. On the 15th April the base at Ras Arab was established, and between that date and 24th April the whole of the Subaihi column and the British detachments with the Commission escort were embarked and brought to Aden, only the gun camels, with a guard of mounted men, marching overland. On the other hand two companies of the 94th Infantry (paragraph 134) were landed at Ras Arab, and took charge of the communications between the Commission camp and the sea. At the same time the detachments on the line from Aden to Kbatabia were withdrawn, and marched into Aden on the 25th April. The remainder of the wing of the 94th Infantry was then despatched by sea to Ras Arab, so that 300 rifles were available to keep open the communications between the Com mission and its base, and to reinforce the escort, if necessary. 152 153 152. The dangerous part of the Subaihi delimitation had now been sue* cessfully accomplished, and it only remained for the Commission to complete their work to the sea as expeditiously as possible. 153. All this time the Turkish Commission was still at Mufalis, where the second Commissioner, having now recovered from his illness (paragraph 131), had rejoined them. They had sent 500 men, with four mountain guns, into theZureki country (adjoining the Humedi), hut the Zurekis had, nevertheless, fired on the surveyor 'belonging to the British Commission, who was working t ere under Turkish escort, and the progress of the work had been impeded.^ Un 19th April the Turks reached a camp near Mijza and the British Commission moved to Mudariba, a place not marked on existing maps, but which is close to the intersection of the 13th parallel of latitude with the 44th of longitude, ike Turkish camp was actually in Subaihi country, but they had apparently good reasons for keeping out of the country of their own subjects, the Zureki. Iheir men were also on half rations, as they were now far^ from Taiz, and had great difficulty in getting camels to bring up supplies which they had purchased^ in Aden. The British Commissioners therefore came to their assistance, inducing the Juledi (Subaihi) Sheikhs to furnish camels to fetch these supplies, and also lending the Turks some camels of their own. 154 On 23rd April the Turkish Commissioners arrived at Mudariba, with an escort of 230 men and a mountain gun, and discussions were resumed. It will not be necessary to go much into detail in describing the proceedings of the next three or four weeks. The British Commission moved tinough the country, which is hilly, barren and difficult, suffering from the heat, and to a certain extent from the scarcity of water. At one place, Haiki, they encountered some hostility from the people, acting under Turkish influence, but that was remedied, and the survey appears to have been on the whole satisfactorily carried out. 155. The British Commissioners satisfied themselves that the tribal territory of the Subaihis extended as far to the north-west as Akama and Akkar, res pectively, about 34, and 24, miles east of Mokha.* But the Turks had succeeded in obtaining a hold over the people in a considerable portion of this tract; their Sheikhs paying taxes to the Turkish authorities in Mokha, and making no claim to British protection. Colonel Wahab, therefore, offered to accept a line which would include in the British protectorate all the Suhaihis (Juledi, Buremi and Atifi), who still maintained their independence, and leave to the Turks those who had accepted their rule. This line would run from the neighbourhood of Mudariba, which is about 26 miles straight inland from Ras Arab, in a general west-north-westerly direction for about 15 miles, and would then turn south- westward, following for the most part the water-shed between the Red Sea drainage and that running to the Gulf of Aden, down to the eastern side of the Sheikh Said peninsula. This proposal would leave a large area to which the Subaihis have or had good claims to the Turks and it has been considered necessary to require the Turks to recognise our reversionary rights to the tract which includes Sheikh Said, and to secure for this concession a definite settlement of the border to the north-east beyond the Bana. Up to the time of writing ( 12 th June 1904) the Turks have not accepted this boundary, though it appears to be an eminently reasonable one, but it seems likely that it will be agreed to after the usual delay. 156. On the night of 20fch May the officers of the British Boundary Commission, having made their way back to Ras Arab, were conveyed from thence to Perim, where they proposed to remain while discussing with the Turks the question of where the boundary should reach the sea. Their escort, except a few men retained as a guard for a surveyor working at Sheikh Said, together with the wing of the 94th infantry, which had been keeping open communications, embarked at Ras Arab for Aden on the days immediately following. The Turkish Commission in the meantime moved to Turba, a short range on the east side of the Sheikh Said peninsula and now crowned by a Turkish fort. The projection of Turba into the sea is marked &lt;c Warner’s Point ” on the Admiralty charts. At the foot of the hill is the hamlet of Turba, which consists only of a few mat huts. 157. A brief notice of the history of Sheikh Said may be of interest. In 1869 a Prench Company obtained a footing there, with the idea of creating a coal depot, though they never seem to have got so far as depositing any coal. This, it will be remembered, was before the Turkish occupation of Yemen in 1871, and the country on the Arabian coast in the neighbourhood of Perim might naturally be presumed to belong to its inhabitants, unless claimed ° The former of these two places has been identified as the El Khamer of the War Office (10 miles to 1 inch) map. The latter is north of “ Musa ” (properly Moza ?) on the same map.M+, 37 by the British as part of the dependencies of Aden. There is no record at Aden of any such claim having been made, and the French Company bought their rio-ht to occupy Sheikh Said, or a part of it, from the Hakmi Arabs, who are the local tribe. But the Hakmi were then subject to the Atih (that is to say, they paid them dues) though they have since become independent of them, and the the Hakmi endeavoured to obtain the consent of his overlords the 1 Atlfi Sheikhs, to the transaction. The latter, however, refused to recognise it in any way and even sent back a sum of 550 dollars offered them by the 1 rench. This was not, as it happened, a matter of much consequence, because the Turks, having decided to re-establish themselves in South-Western A™hia got r,d of the French at Sheikh Said as a preliminary measure. One momin- m December 1870 or January 1871 a Turkish man-of-war, with troons on board, dropped anchor off Sheikh Said, and a party from her hauled down the French flag, which the Company’s employes had hoisted. The French Govern ment were not then in a position to protest effectually, even if thev had anv real grounds for doing so, and the incident passed off quietly. 7 y ., 158 - T1| e Turks established themselves in South-Western Arabia and it is said that they called to account the Hakmi Sheikh, Ali Thabit, for sell’ino' a part of his country to the French; but they did not apparently say anythin! to the Sheikhs of the Atih, who claimed suzerainty over all this part of the country and who, as belonging to the great Subaihi tribe, are under British protection In course of time the Turks built a fort and barracks at Sheikh Said the latter being on the Tnrba ridge. These works were not completed till about 1888 Ihe normal garrison is two companies of infantry and some artillerymen. In 1893 the Trench Colonial party endeavoured to induce the Eenuhli can Government to lay claim to Sheikh Said on the strength of the mirohn*! of the place from Sheikh Ali Thabit in 1869, and the British Foreign Offieo directed our Ambassador at Constantinople to make enquiries from the Porte The Porte replied that no action whatever had been taken by the Trench Embassy in the direction indicated; and it was further stated that Sheikh Said was an integral part of the Ottoman Empire, and that the cession said to have been made by a local authority was not, and could not be, recognized. . a private individual, representing a Trench mercantile firm en quired from the Embassy at Paris if Sheikh Said was occupied bv British troops. The Ambassador referred to the Eoreign Office, and the Marquis of Salisbury, with the concurrence of Lord George Hamilton, replied that there no truth m the report of the occupation of Sheikh Said by a British force nmi hat Her Majesty’s Government considered it to be Turkish tSory Since then there has been nothing to attract attention to Sheikh Said until present demarcation. 9 159 ; Pf boundary recommended by the British Commissioners runs to tpe coast at the end of a low range, about a mile east of the Turba hill nnrl hamlet, which would thus be left in Turkish possession.

His Majesty’s Government fidly approved your language to the Grand Vizier, which I repeated to Ambassador.

Sir I asked the Turkish Ambassador to call upon me this evening, and spoke to him in strong terms upon the subject of the recall of the Irade dealing with the Aden frontier (vide your telegram No. 146 Octo ber 18th). I gave him a brief account, drawn from Sir Nicholas O'Conor's despatch No. 785 of October 9th, and your despatch No. 799 of October 12th, of the circumstances under which the Irade had been promised by the Sultan, and, after many delays and mi uch discussion, issued on the eve of Sir Nicholas 0*Conor's departure. I said that Sir Nicholas, who had been in bad health lately, had remained at Con stantinople for the express purpose of concluding thi s troublesome negotiation, and that I could not conceive that, immediately after his departure, hie Irade should have been withdrawn. I said that you had Esq. i, &amp;c .,infomed the Grand Vizier that they resented what seemed to us an act of tad faith, and an attempt to take advantage of the Ambassador’s absence in order to avoid carrying out an engagement entered into with him. I hoped to hear from you shortly that your representations had not been without ef- r feet. I begged His Excellency however to inform the Turkish Government of the fact that I had sent for him and of the language which I had used, add ing that, although I would not now enter into the question of the steps which it might become neces sary for us to take in order to enforce our claims, it was obvious that we could not leave matters where they were. His Excellency expressed much concern, and promised to repeat my remarks, of which he took notes, to the Turkish Government. I mentioned to Hie Excellency that I had heard witn regret that there had been an encroachment upon the recently laid down frontier of the Miri coun try by pereone in the employment of the Turkish Gov ernmentGovernment, and I thought it unfortunate that this incident should have occurred simultaneously with the difficulty which had arisen in regard to the Irade.

THE article which I had the honour to forward to your Lordship in my despatch No. 519 of the 26th- September, containing M. Presseq-Rolland’s observations on the claims of France to Sheikh-Said, has been followed, in the same newspaper— the “ Depeche Coloniale by three others, explaining in detail the grounds on which the writer maintains that the above claims still hold good. Although I have no reason to suppose that the French Government will allow itself to be drawn into reasserting a pretention so long since abandoned, I feel it my duty to transmit the articles in question for your Lordship’s information.* M. Presseq-Rolland lays stress on the purchase of a portion of the coast by the French Company, Maison Bazin, in 1868 ; on the alleged independence of the Arab Sheikh who sold it; and on the protests and reserves whieh he states have always been made when Turkey has taken any step to assert her rights. Although a succession of French Governments have shown disinclination to take the matter up, the writer of the articles expresses the hope that the next Session of the Chambers will not be allowed to pass without a renewed effort to secure attention to the claims of this country over the region in question.

I HAVE the honour to inclose herewith to yonr Lordship a copy of a telegram, which I sent to Mr. Fitzmanrice last night respecting the Aden frontier question.* Your Lordship will perceive from this telegram that I am not without hope, as a result of my recent negotiations with the Sublime Porte, of persuading the Imperial Government to accept the Kuwah-Mourad line and the conditions demanded by us as to the north-east frontier, but also to admit the reservation of the Subaihi rights to the Akkama-Kuddam line as against cession of the territory to another Power.

October 9th. 1904 My Lord:- Since writing my despatch to Your Lordship No. 777 of the third instant in which I stated that the Sultan had promised on the 23rd. ultimo to agree to the proposed Aden frontier, daily communications have been passing between the first Dragoman of the Embassy, the Palace, and the Porte with a view to extract the fulfil ment of the Sultan's promise in the usual form of an Irade. The Grand Vizier and the Minister for Foreign Affairs repeatedly asserted that they knew of no ob struction or sudden objection or of difficulties oeing raised by the War Office. They could only explain the delay by confidentially whispering that it was very difficult to get the Sultan to attend to any business just at present. Tired by these tactics and unable to go my self be Marquess of Lansdowne, K.G., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.myself to the Porte owing to indisposition, I sent Mr. I^riib to the Palace this morning with instructions to require a categorical answer as I was leaving Con stantinople the following day, and Insisted upon knowing beforehand whether the promise o± trie oultan had been kept or broken. The Sultan's first Secretary informed Mr. Lamb that the Irade was promulgated and would be at the Porte as soon as the Office was open. Mr. Lamb went there and waited till past fair but the Irade had not yet reached the Minister. I have instructed the first Dragoman to repair to the Minister for Foreign Affairs private house to morrow at ten and to press His Excellency to go to the Palace and find out exactly whether the Irade in accordance with His Imperial Majesty's promise has been given or not. If there should be further procrastination in evidence of bad faith on the part of the Sultan and if an affirmative answer is not received before I leaveleave Constantinople tomorrow I venture to suggest the expediency of sending any ship of war that my he avail able to station off Sheikh Said or to cruise between there and Kuddarn. I have little doubt that the result will be such as is desired without the least chance of recourse being necessary to niore drastic measures of the sort. I have, &amp;c., (Signed) N. R.

My Lord:- With reference to Sir Nicholas O'Conor's despatch No. 783 of the 9th instant upon the subject of the Aden frontier negotiations, I have the honour to report that I called at the Sublime Porte on Mon day last after His Excellency's departure and was told that the Irade promised had actually been re ceived, and that it was favourable, inasmuch as it approved the decision come to by the Council of Ministers. Mr. Lamb again saw the Minister for For eign Affairs yesterday, but failed to see the text of the Council's decision with the Irade promulgat ing it; Tewfik Pasha assured him however that it was perfectly satisfactory and in accordance with the terms of the Memorandum communicated by Sir N. O'Conor, and he authorized him to tell me that I The Marquess of Lansdowne, K.G., &amp;e., &lt;Scc., &amp;c., couldcould report to Your Lordship in this sense. The reason given for the non-production of the document was that it had been submitted to the Min ister of War, in order that His Excellency might issue the necessary telegraphic instructions to the Turkish authorities of the Yemen charged with the conduct of the negotiations. Mr. Lamb was promised that as soon as these instructions had been sent I should be officially notified of the fact.

The opinion, contained in paragraph 2 of the Resident’s letter, as to the proper alignment of the north-east frontier, is precisely the one which the Government of India have, it is understood, all along held; and the boundary is the one which this Government have advised should be laid down in the Irade which, it is hoped, may be secured with a view to avoiding the necessity of demarction. 3. The Government of India will notice that the attitude of the tribes— described by Mr. Eitzmaurice as one of suspicion rather than of actual hostility— is attributed to the fact that, though we have now been among them for two years, our intentions are not realised, and fears are entertained, lest we should desire to interfere with their independence. In my letter No/l98 P., dated the 28th August 1904,1 have already represented that, in the opinion of the Governor in Council, it is of political importance that we should announce publicly what our intentions are about remaining at Ethala; and the present report from General Mason, coupled with the circumstance reported in his telegram, dated 22nd instant, seem to His Excellency in Council to emphasise the necessity of making clear our attitude and intentions. 4. In my telegram of to-day’s date, it has been urged that prompt notice should be taken of the violation of our territory by the Turkish authorities. The proposal is closely connected with the relations of the Yaffai and other tribes with ourselves, and the Governor in Council considers that if the tribes are notified that we intend to remain at Dthala, that we have nojd^Mj^jn^intfintion. to int erfere in any way with their independence, but That we shall, where cases such as the violation of the Amiri boundary by the Turks arise, take steps to assert and, if necessary, to vindicate the immunity of our side of the boundary from Turkish incursion and interference, we shall go far towards strengthening and consolidating our position and influence with the Yaffai as well as with the other tribes within our border. *'■ /rV No. 168, dated Aden, the 11th September 1904 (Confidential).

In continuation of my letter No. 160 (Confidential), tilldated 1904, I have the honour to forward herewith letter No. 163 (Confide), the 8th instant, from Major Merewether, Political Officer a ^ ’ T p ’ with reference to the question asked in paragraph 1 o y ou fri -v,e &lt;3 concerned dated 5th August 1904, that the feelings of the Yaffai an o _ _ gubaihi compared with those of the Subaihi before ^he demarcation of the Suba^ frontier are a great deal more intense. The Yaffai tribe^ compand wUh^the Subaihi are a more warlike race, they have a stronger se Yaffai they are more united, that is, they are more likely to combine. The Yattai Vnountrv is more inaccessible than the Subaihi, but I am of opinion that if to accept thcdemarcauon of their frontier without any senous opposition. 9 Mr Fitzmaurice, with whom I have discussed the question considers that ihe n^rth e^st Hue should pass from Lakniat-ash-Shub to the desert, whL includes in our side the Yaffai dependencies of ^ube aten Nawa Juban Dethabiani, Beda, and Upper Aulaki, including * ^ai''h^on°their^i!orthern , frcmtier^roper r owlng to the'places I have mentioned o„, X r «^i.-- rE ^ . - lu gram^ of 14th July 1904 to the Secretary of State for India. Mr. Pitzmaurice further gives me as his opinion that—“It would appear that the difficulty or ease of the north-east demarcation depend to a great extent on the result of the negoiations now proceeding at Constantinople. It might he advisable to postpone the final decision of the question of the north-east demarcation till those negotiations have been brought to a conclu sion. The present frame of mind of the Yaffai tribesmen is rather one of suspicion as to the intentions of Government, than one of actual hostility. They were like most hill tribesmen fanatically independent. It is now cl^e on two years since they have been brought into direct contact with us, and the uncertainty of our attitude towards them has engendered in their minds a not unnatural suspicion that we may have designs of interfering with their independence. The head Sheikhs or principal Chiefs may understand that is not the case, but the majority of the tribesmen are unacquainted with the methods of Government, careful dealing may dispel these suspicions; while by proceeding along the northern border of Rube’aten, Nawa, Juban, &amp;c., direct contact and the consequent possibility of friction with these tribesmen will be avoided”. 3. In conclusion, in my opinion, it would, however, be necessary before any demarcation work was commenced to have a large force of troops ready to show that the Government would be prepared to overcome any opposition offered by the tribes. I consider, however, that a great deal more may be effected by the use of proper judgment and tact than by the employment of force. 4. I attach a letter from a Chief of much inffuence in the Yaffai tribe, by name Sheikh Ali Mohsin, Askar, to Mr. Fitzmaurice. It will be seen from the tone of the letter that they were apparently under the impression the demarcation to the north-east was to be proceeded with. However, there is one point to be remembered that many of the Chiefs and Sheikhs have no effective control for good over many of their followers, though they always seem to control them perfectly for purposes of mischief.

At present they are ostensibly enemies, but secretly thev are one, if thev give out that they have settled they would be punished by Yaffai, because they were the cause of four deaths of the Yaffai tribesmen.

In reply to your leUer No. 159 of 12th August 1904, forwarding copy of letter No. 173 P. of 5th August 1904, from the Secretary to Government, Political Department, Bombay, I have the honour to report as follows. 2. Since my arrival in Dthala in May last, I have devoted a great deal of attention to the points, on which information is asked, and I now submit my conclusions. Before entering into details, however, I would remark that, although certain Sultans and Sheikhs are themselves friendly tons, the patriarchal system which obtains amongst the Yaffai deprives the leaders of much of the power which they would otherwise exercise. A Sultan or Sheikh of a Yaffai tribe is really only the man to whom the tribes entrusts the lead in the execution of the policy on which the tribe itself may have resolved. If the Sultan or Sheikh were ^to. actively^oppose such tribal policy, he would, probably, be turned out. To such an extent does this feeling exist that sometimes a single clan will oppose or hold aloof from policy agreed upon both by the Sultan and the rest of the tribe. &lt; This being so, the fact of a Sultan or Sheikh being himself friendly to us &lt; may in some cases mean little or nothing. \ The leading men of Yaffa have received very considerable sums in presents and stipends from us. Had they, from the commencement, set aside a share of these presents to be distributed amongst their Akils and tribesmen, I have little doubt that the feeling of the latter would have been more friendly to us than^at present the case. Instead of allowing these people to share in the present, the recipients have kept the amounts themselves and the tribemen, receiving no benefits from us, , are naturally not more friendly to us than before. In fact, I may say that the system has incensed the tribesmen against their Chiefs, and had thus, to a certain extent, deprived the latter of their power to assist us. In order, as far as possible, to undo this evil, I have made a practice of dividing a certain amount of the present amongst the Akils and tribesmen who accompany the Chief when he visits me. Had this system been adopted earlier, I think that our position, as well as that of the Chiefs, would have been stronger. Further I must lay stress on the fact that at any time a sudden turn in J f local politics may change the whole aspect of affairs, and turn our present/ friends into enemies, or render them powerless to assist us. I have had considerable experience of uncivilised people in Manipur and Somaliland, and I consider that the Arab of Southern Arabia is the most crafty, treacherous, and avaricious savage that I have met. The slightest sign of vacillation or weakness is seized upon as evidence of timidity, in the same way forbearance from just punishment is looked upon as a sign of cowardice and impotence, and they are encouraged to further misdeeds. Their law is literally “ an eye for an eye ”, and they understand no other.WiliKPi inirr'! I »-****— -N 4 Although they call themselves Muhammadans, the great majority have only a tW k money Por monev they are ready to commit any crime, lor Zi^s Le of U avail j ,,em. They look upon ^ wiU^ntaif ^puidshment which benefits received they wifi hre a r a treaty as soon as they see any advantage to be gained by so doing. I am obliged to lay stress on this trait in the Arab character, because I wish to make It clear that, in the event of our entering Yalta, little re lance can be pW on present protestations of friendship and promises of assistance. 3. The five sections or clans of the Upper Yalfai are : (1) Mausatta, (2) Muflahi, ( ) Dthubi, (4) Daudi, (5) Bosi, and there is the Shaibi tribe which does not actually belong to Upper Yaffai, but for present purposes must be reckoned with as such. The Sultanate of Upper Yaffai is in the family of Sheikh Ali Harhara, the rightful present Chief being Kahtan-bin-Omer. This man came to Aden to enter into treaty with us. During his absence, his brother Saleh-bin-Omer occupied his “ Dar ” and Kahtan on his return was unable to re-occupy it. He now lives in the country of the Ahl Salafa. Saleh and his brother Kahtan have now privately made up their quarrel, and are ready to co-operate in re-installing Kahtan in the Sultanate. The Ahl Salafa will assist them, if they are paid for their services, but neither Saleh nor Kahtan have the means to pay them. With Saleh’s assistance and with sufficient money, I think Kahtan would be able to regain his former position, as Saleh is popular with the Yaffais. The collateral branch of Sheikh Ali Barbara’s family are intensely hostile to us, and I think that an arrangement, which would place Kahtan in a strong enough position to keep the other branch quiet, would be very advantageous. In this connection, I att ich a copy (marked A) of a communication received from Ali Mohsin Askar, nephew of Ali Askar, the Chief of the Mausatta clan. Ali Mohsin Askar, from motives of self-interest, is anxious that we should enter the country. He is a supporter of Kahtan, and, at the latter’s request, he asks us to eiiher give Kahtan $3,000, or advance it out of his stipend to enable him to pay men lor assistance in regaining his position. The question is, is it worth it ? In my opinion, if Government intend to demarcate the north-east boundary shortly, it is worth it. If we assist Kahtan, he will be only too glad to welcome us into his country in order to strengthen his own position. Having been assisted by Ali Askar, through Ali Mohsin Askar, in obtaining this $3,000 from us, an allowance between Kahtan and the Mausatta will follow and with the iVlausatta will go the Dthubi, the second strongest clan in the Upper Yaffai, the Daudi are already friendly to Kathan, and would suffice to keep the Bosi who are hostile to us quiet. There w r ould only remain the Muflahi who are as a whole friendly. If, on the other hand, there is no intention of demarcating the north east boundary, I think that no interference in the politics of Upper Yaffai is called for on our part. Should such intention exist, I would strongly urge that the demarcation be undertaken at the earliest possible date, and that all passible assistance be given to Kahtan to ivcover his position. My chief reasons for urging this course are :— a) Sooner or later our hands will be forced and probably at a less propitious time than the present. r5 ■ for ; y as reaty ft upied 'lives for lie to silk 'men kast io to . Id jsatta iortti* ( 2 ) (3) I do not think that Upper Yaffai will ever be more friendly to us than at present, unless the demarcation be completed. The permanent retention of Dthala with its costly line of communications and constant expenditure on transport is not, I believe, contemplated. Dthnla cannot, in my opinion, be given up untill not only has the bound- arv been demarcated, but the Yaffais, both Upper and Lower, have been shown that, while we have no desire to occupy their country, we intend to enforce respect for the boundary in every quarter. The sooner, therefore, the boundary is demarcated, the better, and with this aim in view, I advocate monetary support being given to Kahtan to recover his position. He lost that position, in a very great measure, owing to his visit to Aden to conclude a treaty with us, and I think we are in honour bound to assist him, our policy pointing the same way. Prom what I have learnt of Saleh-bin-Omer, it would be hostile to our interests to allow him to remain in the position which rightfully belongs to Kahtan. 4. The head Sheikh of the Shaibi is Ali Mana-As-Sakladi, who is friendly to us. The majority of the Shaibi Sheikhs are friendly, and. would, I think, assist us in their respective districts. I have abbreviated this report as far as possible, having carefully gone through the list of the principal vsheikhs and Akils of Upper Yaffai, and the conclusion I have come to is that, provided Kahtan regains his position, the sooner we demarcate the boundary, the better. 5. It is not necessary for me to go in detail into the state of feeling of Lower Yaffa about us. . I do not think that we have a single friend in the whole of Lower Yaffai, and our entry into the country would certainly be resisted to the utmost. Pressure, however, can be brought to hear on them from two quarters (a) If Kahtan’s position as Sultan of the Upper Yaffai is assured, he may be able to induce the Lower Yaffai to mitigate their hostility. In ordinary times there is little evidence of any alliance between the Upper and Lower Yaffai, but they would join in time of war. # (b) The Kotaibis were originally Yaffais, and preserve many Yaffai Customs to this date. _ _ _ ^ • Constant correspondence passes between the Sultan of the Lower Yaffai. Abdulla-bin-Mohsin, and Muhammad Saleh, the Chief of the Ivotaibis. For months past I have been endeavouring to induce Muhammad Sa eh to make his peace with us. Several times he has been on the point of giving in but at the last moment some intriguer has stepped m and stopped it. _ I beheve he is only holding out for better terms which, I think, it would he unwise to offer him at present. . „ . , ... If however, he does eventually come to his senses and make friends wi us, he would be able to do much to render the Lower Yaiiai more amenah e, an feel sure that he would do so. , ...

From— Sheikh Ali Mohsin, Askar, of Mausatta, To— Majoe W. Merewbthee, Political Officer at Dthala. After compliments .—Oh friend ! It is incumbent on arrange- any efficient or pleasing matter, and yon shall have to ma y u •f-6 ments. KaMan-bin-Omer before coming to you was Sultan. We advised bim, and he complied with our advice by coming to the illustrious &lt; ^ eafc Gover ''? 1 e “‘ at Aden. Eis brother was thereafter elected as Sultan, further he, ^s well as ourselves, were addressed by General Maitland, the then Resident, and Captain Warneford, to come to Dthala. Shortly afterwards his Dar was taken pos-es- sion of and was occupied, and this was due to you. Why should Oh friend, the state of your friends assume such an aspect after such ? It is not ta r that Kahtan should not be given pecuniary assistance to reconcile his tribesmen with or move in such a robust manner, whereby he can re-enter his Dar after a strong fight, because he has no money for necessaries of life, nor has he got money to enable him to move. In our opinion, he stands in need of $3,003 which can he given him as an advance from his future stipend, so that be can revive his strength, and use it more than before. He should be given three months time to reinstate himself or get into his Dar forcibly by waging war. If he fails to do so, then there will be no fault on the part of Government. This is our advice to you, because disparagement to Government is just as to us. Please let the Resident know of this matter. May you be preserved ! r fiiSecr^'Minute Paper.

[August 17.] Section 1. A CONFIDENTIAL. No. 1. Sir N. O'Conor lo the Marquess of l.ansdowne.—(Received August 17.) (No. 646.) * My Lord, Therapia, August 11, 1904. I INCLOSE herewith to your Lordship a Memorandum from Mr. Lamb, reporting a telegram received by the Sublime Porte from the Turkish Commission for the delimi tation of the Aden frontier. I have instructed Mr. Lamb to reply that the places mentioned by the Commis sioners are on the British side of the line running from Lakmat-es-Shub to the desert, and cannot, therefore, be a subject for contestation. At the same time I have prepared a Memorandum, of which a copy is likewise inclosed, which Mr. Lamb is to read to the Under-Secretary of State and Ifeave him a copy if desired, but to explain to his Excellency thkt my proposals are subject to your Lordship’s final assent and approval, and are made solely with a view to bringing these prolonged negotiations to a speedy and amicable conclusion. I venture again to remark that, to my knowledge, the Ottoman Government have never drawn a distinction between the Upper and Louver Yaffai or Aulaki, nor questioned the oft-repeated assertion that these tribes belonged to the nine cantons, which are considered to be under British protection. I am therefore unwilling myself to seem to throw doubt on this point by making a distinction between the upper and lower divisions, and I consider our interests are amply safeguarded by the request that the Porte shall recognize that the canton of the Yaffai and Aulaki, with their depen dencies and sub-divisions, as also all tribes to the east of the line going from Lakmat- es-Shub to the desert, are British. This line includes nearly the wdiole of the Rubeatein and the whole of the Dhabiani country, and leaves us free to act as we please with regard to Beda, which also is on the British side of the north-east frontier-line. It would be, I consider, very imprudent to raise a discussion in connection with the Imperial Irade of February 1902, which I have always regarded as a very favourable solution of a complicated question. I cannot say whether the Porte will accept my proposals. I think they will give the lien over the Subaihi district which we desire, but they may insist upon retaining Turbat Abul Azrar on account of the holy shrine, and upon the line running from Enrwah to Jebel Hosisi instead of to Sheikh Mirad ; but if our reserves are accepted to the country south-east of Akama Kuddam, I venture to think it is relatively of little importance whether the frontier ends at Jebel Hosisi or Sheikh Mirad. I shall, of course, make the best terms I can, but I should be grateful to your Lordship if you will let me know by telegraph whether you approve of the proposals contained in my communication to the Sublime Porte. i s.

In view of risk of losing the opportunity of securing lien on country south of Akama-Kuddam involved in protracting negotiations, we have decided that, provided lien in question is secured, Jebel Hasisi may he accepted as point at which boundary is to strike the sea. You are authorized to conduct negotiations henceforth on this basis. Government of India have been informed.From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department, V2,th September 1904. (Repeated to Aden.) Please refer to my telegram of the 2nd August regarding the Aden delimitation. Strong objection is taken by Turkish Government to line terminating at Sheikh Murad. Proposal that ice should be given a hen on the country lying to the south of the Akama-Kuddam line may become known. Discussion with Porte is prolonged, and we may consequently fail to secure it. Instructions have accordingly been sent by His Majesty's Government to Sir N. O' Conor authorising him to accept Jebel Hasisi as the terminus of the line of boundary, on condition that we are granted the lien by the Turkish Government. ^ J UW 4 ^With reference to your letter of the 23rd of July last, I am directed hy the Marquess of Lans- downe to state, for the information of the Secretary of State for India, that he has had under his con sideration the telegrams which have recently passed between His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople and Mr. Fitzmaurice respecting the delimitation of the Southern section of the Aden frontier. From this correspondence it appears that the Turkish Gov ernment object to the proposal that the frontier line should run from Jebel Kuah to Sheikh Murad, and that it will be difficult to induce them to give way on this point; but Lord Lansdowne understands that they would probably agree to the line being drawn to J. Hosisi, the point proposed by the British Commis sion. Lord The Under Secretary of State, India Office.Lord Lansdowne considers that it is very desir able that these negotiations should he concluded as soon as possible. It appears to His Lordship that provided that, as proposed by Sir N. 0*Conor, a lien is obtained by His Majesty's Government over the whole of the country up to Akama and Kuddam it is not a matter of vital importance whether the fron tier runs to Sheikh Murad or to J. Hosisi, and that protracted negotiations may lead to publicity and the consequent loss of this opportunity of securing the lien in question. I am therefore to suggest, for Mr. Brodrick's consideration, that His Majesty's Government should now agree to accept J. Hosisi as the point at which the frontier line reaches the sea and that Sir N. O'Conor should be authorised to conduct the negotia tions on this basis. I am. Sir Your most obedient humble ServantFrom Mr. Fitzmaurice to Secretary of State for India, 3rd September 1904.

It would be, I consider, very imprudent to raise a discussion in connection with the Imperial Irade of February 1902, which I have always regarded as a Mrvery favourable solution of a complicated question. I cannot say whether the Porte will accept my Luh 7 proposals. I think they will give the line over the Subeihi district which we desire, hut they may insist upon retaining Turbat Abul Azrar on account of the holy shrine and upon the line running from Kuwah to Jebel Hoslsi instead of to Sheikh Mi rad; but if our reserves are accepted to the country south-east of Akama Kuddam, I venture to think it is relatively of little importance whether the frontier ends at Jebel Hosisi or Sheikh Mirad. I shall of course make the best terms I can, but I should be grateful to Your Lordship if you will let me know by telegraph whether you approve of the proposals contained in my communication to the Sublime Porte.

The Secretary General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs communicated to me to-day a Vizierial letter of the 7th instant, covering a telegram from the Acting Vali of Yemen, dated the 21st ultimo (3rd instant), which had been transmitted through the Ministry of the Interior. This telegram was in the following terms The British Commissioner came to the frontier comission and stated that in accordance with the instructions of his Government, he would he unahle to sign the agreement as to the Bah~ul-Maneeh-S u'd ei~ hi section of the frontier so long as it was not agreed and confirmed that Awalik (i.e. the Aulaki) which the British Government had announced to the Porte thirty years ago was part of the nine Cantons, was in fact in those cantons and also that the com- raunes (?Uzle) named DhaMani, Naawa and Jufcan, which to-day form part of the Gaza of Rad'aa, were recog nized as belonging to Yaffai. Although the Ottoman CommissionersCommissioners replied that there was no connection between those parts and the questions above-mentioned it was impossible to make him change his views. Now it is established that these communes (?) ever since their formation, have been administered as part of the Caza of Rad'aa and have never been part of Yaffai and their being considered as part of the nine cantons would have an injurious effect upon the ulterior development of that Caza.

As will be seen from their telegram of the \Uh July, the Government of India contemplate a comprehensive settlement of the boundary north-east on a political basis, and, as in the case of Kataba, a very strong lever for the desired settlement is afforded by our potential claim to the full limits of the Subaihi, including Sheikh Said and Turba ; while by settlement at this stage of any portion of the line to the west of the point mentioned in my No. 12, our leverage would pro tanto be decreased, and the automatic pressure we are now bringing to bear on Turks diminished. Moreover, the Forte might be less disposed to accept any proposals for settlement north-east, and to agree to our reservation of Subaihi rights, if I were to draw the Murad line on map and sign it here. Line to Murad would pass very near Turba forts, depriving garrison of the only tolerable drinking well they possess. Turks would therefore object to this line, but I can press for it, as soon as 1 receive the further orders alluded to in the telegram from the Government of India of the 2nd June.'

IN my despatch No. 443 of the 8th instant, J informed your Lordship that the Acting Yali of Yemen had reported to the Grand Vizier that, as regarded the section of the frontier between the Subaihi and Mokha, the Commissioners had agreed to assign four clans to Turkey, and three to the Subaihi, and that I had communicated this statement to Mr. Fitzmaurice by telegram. Mr. Fitzmaurice, in his answer dated the 15th June, and repeated to your Lordship on the 16th by the Resident at Aden, states that the Turks claim five clans and not four. The Grand Vizier showed me a telegram on the 13th instant from the Vali of Yemen, stating that the disputed points respecting the division of the clans on the border between the Gaza of Mokha and the Subaihi were not yet settled, and that there were other undecided questions in dispute as concerned the delimitation down to the sea. The Vali represented that the least the Turkish Commissioners could accept would be a line passing east of Bir-i-Sakaya, leaving the well on the Turkish side, and that the British Com missioners proposed the line of the Guwahi Hills, 2^ kilom. from the fortifications of Bab-ul-Mandeb. I at once telegraphed the above information to Mr. Fitzmaurice, who, as your Lordship will have seen from his above-quoted telegram, repeated to you by the Resident at Aden, has replied that the boundary map from Setba to the coast will be ready in three /^.f_ weeks’ time, by which date His Majesty’s Governrfienf will be in possession of reports with large-scale map, which may assist them in coming to a decision, and that he has not seriously discussed the outstanding portion of the frontier as yet. Mr. Fitzmaurice represents that, for climatic reasons, the British position would be stronger at Sheikh Said than at Sanaa tor completion of delimitation, as the Turkish Commissioners find the tormer very trving, and are consequently anxious to get away, whereas at Sanaa the conditions would be reversed.

He does not consider that Sana would be a suitable place, as there are no mapping materials there, and the postal communications, more especially as long as existing quarantine lasts, are faulty. I am informing Mr. Eitzmaurice, in reply, that I am consulting the Grand Vizier as to an alternative place, but that I expect to meet with difficulties, and I have asked him whether he cannot go direct to Hodeidah from Perim and so avoid quarantine. I have further telegraphed to Mr. Fitzmaurice that I do not know what points have been reserved for final settlement here, and in so doing have expressed a strong opinion that it will be difficult to come to an agreement here respecting the frontier, as Palace influence will make itself felt at ever y turn, w hereas it is pruhable,Jqr the reasons already explained to your Lordship, that) in my~~abuve-mentioned despatch a final settlement could be arrived at more easily at Sana.

Accompanying Political Despatch from the Bombay Government, dated the // &amp;, a-v 190^/. Pol 1525Confidential, Report on the demarcation of the frontier between the tribes in the Protectorate of Aden and the Turkish Province of Yemen; by Major-General P. J. Maitland, C,P., Resident at Aden, South-Western Arabia, the ancient kingdom of the Sabeans, after passing through various vicissitudes, including an Abyssinian and Persian occupation, was conquered by the Turks in the reign of Sulaiman the Magnificent about the year 1540. 2. It then became the Pashalik of Yemen, which included the Tehama, or low country on the west, along the seaboard, and also Aden, together with some portion of the southern coast. The provincial capital was at Sana about 220 miles north of Aden, and something over 100 miles inland from the port of Hodeida. Turkish rule, however, never seems to have been very firmly establish ed in Yemen. Hepeated rebellions of the Arabs, and the difficulty of main taining a large number of troops in a country with which communication was then difficult, induced the Turks to withdraw from this region in 1630, after about 90 years of occupation. 3. The sovereignty of Yemen and the adjacent coasts was then assumed by the former ruling family, whose head takes the title of “ ^m4m. ,, They are directly descended from the Abbaside Caliphs of Bagdad, and the branch which stilf reigns over a small portion of their ancient dominions is related to the Barakat family of Sharifs of Mecca. The power of the Imams, disturbed by the family and other dissensions usual in oriental states, and by wars with the Wahabis and the Viceroys of Egypt, continued for more than two and a half centuries. During this period, however, Aden had become separated from Yemen, and was the capital of a small State, apparently consisting of Aden and Lahej and the neighbouring district. The other tribes in what is now the Aden Protectorate appear to have been independent.* 4. The adoption of the “ overland ” route to India in 1837 necessitated the establishment of a coaling station for steamers somewhere between Suez and Bombay. Aden was by far the most convenient place for this purpose, and an endeavour was made to obtain it by purchase. The then Sultan actually entered into an agreement with the British representative, Captain Haines of the Indian JS'avy, to cede the peninsula in consideration of an annual pension of $8,700. But when, in the following year, the fulfilment of this engage ment was requested, the Arabs fired on the boats of Captain Haines ship, and committed various acts of treachery. Accordingly, the place was bombarded and taken by assault, the Sultan and his family fleeing to Lahej. This was in January 1839. The town of Aden, the population of which is now upwards of 17,000,1* was then a wretched village containing only some 000 inhabitants, most of whom were Jews, and trade had sunk to the lowest ebb. 5. Six months after the capture of Aden, Captain Haines, now Political Agent, entered into an agreement with the Sultan Mohsin bin Eadthl, formerly of Aden, now of Lahej, which was in effect a defensive and offensive alliance. The Sultan was to receive a subsidy of $6,500 annually, and in addition the British Government undertook to pay the stipends The A.miri are the tribe to tlie j^thli, laffai, Haushabi, and Amiri, which of the Amir of Dthala. f ormerly paid by t}ie Su lt ail to those tribes for keeping open the trade routes. These four tribes, therefore, as well as * It is said that the Imams, after having practically obliged the j.urks to abandon took Aden from them in 1630. About 100 years later, in 173o, the Yaffai and Abdah combined, and took Aden from the Imdms. For another 100 years it was held by the Abdali, until they were turned out by the British in 1839. f The total population of the Aden settlement is about 43,000. The area of the Aden Pro tectorate is somewhere about 40,000 square miles. The population, exclusive of the Aden settle ment, may be about 1,000,000 souls. CO'J 1960—1the Sultan’s own tribe, the Abdali, were stipendiaries of the British from the first. The stipend of a sixth tribe, the Alawi, was subsequently secured to them through the intervention of the Hausbabi chief. Separate engagements were afterwards made with the Fadthli, the Lower Yaffai^ and the Haushabi; also with three other tribes, and as time went on our relations with these tribes became well established. They all acknowledged the supremacy of the British, and their own responsibility for the roads leading to Aden. 6. In 1871 the Turks again made themselves masters of Yemen, after an interval of fully 230 years. Not content with establishing Turkish rule at Sana, and obtaining control of the Red Sea littoral, the Porte laid claim to the whole of Southern Arabia, not excluding Aden, and their troops proceeded to overrun the territory of our stipendiaries, the Amiri and Haushabi chiefs, and advanced into the country of the Abdali. It was only after repeated remonstrances, and the despatch of a British force to Lahej, that the Turkish troops and officials were withdrawn from the territories of the Abdali and Haushabi tribes, and partially from that of the Amir of Dthala. 7. Lord Granville’s despatches of 30th January and 15th May 1873 pointed out that for over 200 years Yemen had been under the rule of inde pendent Arab Chiefs. It was the wish of Her Majesty’s Government that the independence of these Chiefs in the vicinity of Aden should be respected, and they could not view with indifference any attempt to subvert their authority. Nine tribes were named with whom engagements had been entered into, and it was stated that the British Government felt free to make fresh engagements, if they thought expedient. 8. The “ nine tribes ” (usually spoken of in Turkish diplomatic docu ments as the c&lt; nine cantons ”) were— (1) The Abdali. (2) The Padthli. (3) The Akrabi. (4) The Haushabi. (5) The Alawi. (6) The Amiri. (7) The Subaihi. (8) The Yaffai. (9) The Aulaki. oau 9 ; ^he despatches of 1873 were followed by Lord Derby’s despatch of 30th April 1874, which clearly states the position taken up by the British Gov ernment with regard to the tribes in the neighbourhood of Aden, and declares that Great Lntain will not permit any interference on the part of Turkish officials ^ stipendmry cluefs. These declarations produced assurances from the 1 orte that their officials m Yemen had been ordered not to interfere with any h l : ibeS r iDg !f at ? rektions with G -at Britain, and similar assurances tlfp p^ eul1 s^h^ffuently given on more than one occasion. But the orders of the Government at Constantinople have been, to say the least, very imperfectly ^ten &gt; mter£er r e Wi ‘ h th8 AmiVi and HkustibiZritoriS lias been a frequent source of annoyance to the British authorities and the raS&amp;bZ obt“ isl1 Govemment - £0r tbe with the Goyernor-Genaral of Yemen for the settlement by arbtafL of the b undnnes between the lurkish territories and those of the Amir of Dthala Nothing came of this, however, and a few vears later ITpt* Mm*p i &gt; n i proposed “ an arbitral delimitation ” of tiieZha^Zrantier^y^a Briti«b r Zoer m concert with the Turkish authorities. But this did not Jir ti P i h instead, raised the old claim of the Sultan of Turkov tn l , ? Z’ ’ and even went «n far fp „ T . , 01 lur , K ey to the whole of Arabia, renewal of pretentions which had so ’ often Zn ^ 3^0 hT^T -n' and stated that Her Majesty’s Government had nointention of wTthdr'Sfrom the position they had consistently maintained. It was added that the demarcation of the boundary was considered essential “ in order to prevent the constant renewal of discussions between the two Governments.” 11. Still the Turkish Government would not agree to a demarcation, and matters continued in an unsatisfactory state. The question was then first raised of establishing a formal protectorate over the tribes in the neighbourhood of Aden. In August 1886 the Viceroy of India (Lord Dufferin) proposed that an effective protectorate should be established over the Arab tribes from Sheikh Sayad (opposite to Perim) to the frontiers of Oman. “ We would then ask the Turks to consent to a delimitation of ; our protected territory in the direction of theirs. If they agreed, we would enter into a formal convention with them. If not, we would lay down the limits of the protectorate without their consent and make them respect them.” 12. Shortly afterwards, protectorate treaties were entered into with the tribes lying along the coast from the Atiffi Subaihis on the west, to the Mahri on the east. As regards the inland tribes, the Government of India decided that, before concluding protectorate agreements with them, it would be necessary to undertake a topographical survey of the country, fuller knowledge of which, and of the conditions of the tribes, was required. 13. Captain Wahab, It. E., of the Survey of India Department, was accordingly deputed to Aden, and in 1891-92 he carried out a survey of the country to the north as far as Dthala. The resulting map, though of great value, did not extend, in many places, to the actual boundary between the tribes having relations with the British and those under Turkish rule. This was partly owing to the opposition shown by certain tribes to the survey operations. No attempt was, or could then have been, made to map the country to the north-east of Dthala, which is comparatively remote from Aden, and which was at that time thought to be of no great importance. The map, however, was sufficient for the purpose for which it was primarily required, and protec tive treaties with most cf the inland tribes in the vicinity of Aden were entered into. 14. After this there was no incident of importance for some years, but in 1900 complaints were received from the Haushabi Sultan that one Muhammad bin Nasir Mukbil, a Sheikh of the Homar tribe, who had been appointed Mudir of his district by the Turkish authorities, had built a tower near the village of Ad Dareja, within Haushabi limits, and that it was occupied by a Turkish garrison. The tower, a defensible structure of some size, and of a type common in Southern Arabia, is described in the correspondence as a small fort, or a fort, or a “ fortlet.” .Remonstrances addressed by the Resident to the Governor- General of Yemen remained without a reply, and although the Turkish Govern ment, when appealed to, declared their disapproval of the alleged encroachment, while the War Minister promised that if a fort had been erected at Ad Dareja it should be demolished, no change took place. The situation was complicated by the fact that the Haushabis on one side and the Homars on the other are hereditary enemies, and each clan turned out its men. This afforded the Turks an opportunity for commencing to make counter-complaints—a plan frequently resorted to by the local officials when they have been more than usually aggres sive ; and then doubts were raised as to where the boundary line actually ran, and whether the tower was not after all within Turkish territory. 15. In Eebruary 1901, a year after the erection of the tower, Her Majesty’s Government caused a declaration to be conveyed to the Porte that if Muhammad Nasir Mukbil did not immediately evacuate the fort, the Haushabi Sultan, supported, if necessary, by the Aden garrison, would shortly expel him. Two months later, the British Ambassador telegraphed that the Turkish Commandant had been instructed to expel Muhammad Nasir from the fort, and orders were sent to Aden to have a force held in readiness to carry out the expulsion, if the Turks failed to do it themselves. 16. The Resident (General More-Moiyneux) was, however, somewhat doubtful as to the expediency of using British troops for this purpose. He pointed out the smallness of the force that could be spared from Aden, and4 the possibility that Muhammad Nasir would be supported by Turkish soldiers. On 11th May he wrote describing the difficulty of the proposed operation, and deprecating any movement of troops at that season, when loss of life was to be apprehended from climatic causes. Accordingly, the Haushabi Sultan was told to destroy the tower, and promised support if Muhammad Nasir and his tribe should afterwards attack him. A British officer was sent to Ad Dareja with a small escort to see how the Haushabi carried out his instructions. 17. On 4th July the Resident (General Maitland) reported that the Haushabi had failed in an attempt to take the tower, and that the officer had been fired on by Muhammad Nasir’s people from the hills in its vicinity. He accordingly asked permission to despatch a force at once to take and destroy the tower. On the 12th July sanction to the proposal was received in Aden, and on the 15th the force started for Ad Hareja. The instructions of the Secretary of State were to destroy the fort, and to expel the followers of Muhammad Nasir, whether the Turks were present or not, unless they were in such force as to make the attempt a hazardous one. 18. The troops detailed for the expedition were 200 British Infantry (1st Battalion West Kent), 200 Native Infantry, six small mountain guns carried on camels, half a company of Bombay Sappers, and about twenty horsemen of the Aden Troop, the whole under the command of Major Rowe of the West Kent. Major Davies, Hirst, Assistant Resident at Aden, accompanied the force as Political Officer. This little column, only 500 strong, was the largest force that the garrison of Aden Could send out. If support had been required it would have been difficult to afford it, and there were no other troops nearer than Bombay. ^ The weather was very trying, and the troops, debilitated by the climate of Aden, suffered from it severely, especially during the first marches. As they got into a drier, and somewhat cooler, atmosphere, however, they recovered to a great extent, but notwithstanding the urgent need for arriving at Ad Dareja before the slow-moving Turks could make up their minds whether they would openly oppose the British force or not, the marches were very short, and the total distance of about 70 miles took twelve days to cover. 19. Meantime, Muhammad Nasir had the audacity to advance with his tribesmen and take possession of Ad Dareja village. The Haushabis made a halt-hearted attack on him, but failed to recover the place. . 2 t 0 -, lra ;i or Rowe arrived at Ad Dareja with his force on the morning of the 20th July and attacked the enemy holding the village, and the ridge command ing it to the north-east. The position was occupied by 150 to 200 Turkish soldiers, as well as by Muhammad Nasir Mukbil’s Homars. The latter made off when the guns opened, and the real fight was with the Turks. The position had been by ® t ° n ?- bl ' eas t works, but they were gallantly rushed by the West iwrwi? t i h ? t U8 - h eoutm u e d for some time, the issue was never in doubt.

The after effects of the incident were, however, widespread, and of considerable importance. The Arabs never expected that we should have the temerity to attack the Turks, and the Turkish local officials, who had been accustomed to carry matters with a high hand, were very disagreeably surprised. They saw that their prestige among their Arab subjects, most of whom are disaffected, had received a blow, and it would seem that they lost no time in seeking for the means to repair it. 23. His Majesty’s Government were fully alive to the gravity of the situation created by the participation of a considerable body of Turkish troops in the hostilities. They had already reminded the Turkish Government in forcible terms of the position taken up by Great Britain, and consistently maintained, regarding the nine tribes in the vicinity of Aden, and the British Ambassador was now requested to inform the Porte that, unless the attitude and proceedings of the Turkish authorities on the border of the British protectorate were in future more correct, very serious complications would result. He was also to press for the removal of Muhammad Nasir Mukbil. At the same time the Government of India proposed that the opportunity should be taken of inducing the Porte to agree to a demarcation of the Aden Protectorate, where it marched with territory under effective Turkish control; but this proposal was not made, because the Porte spontaneously proposed demarcation, which was at once accepted. This was in October 1901. 24. The aggressive action of the Turks had not been confined to the neighbourhood of Ad Dareja. For some time complaints had been received from the Amir of Dthala of what appeared to be serious interference on the part of the Turkish officials at Kataba.* The evacuation of the territories of this chief, overrun by the Turks in 1873 (see paragraph 6), had never been completely carried out, and their presence had been a constant source of irritation. The Resident at Aden then proposed that the First Political Assistant, Major Davies, should proceed to the Dthala plateau and report on the actual state of affairs. After some delay, Major Davies visited Dthala. On his return he presented an interesting and valuable report, in which he showed that the Turks were in possession of four villages inhabited by Shairi Arabs, subject* of the Amir, which had been retained ever since 1873, and that, at the southernmost of these villages, within a couple of miles of Dthala itself, there was (and had been for several years) a Turkish military post. Only a few weeks before Major Davies’ arrival, the Turks had taken possession of an isolated hill, called Jabal Sliahad,f immediately to the south-east of Jalela and had planted a garrison there. This hill completely commanded the caravan route, and the main approach to the Dthala plateau. Major Davies also reported that the Turks were endeavouring to obtain possession of Mafari, a hill and a small district about four miles in a straight line south-west of Dthala. These encroachments appeared to the Resident even more serious than the erection of the tower at Ad Dareja, which we had sent a military force to destroy. 25. This was the situation in the Amiri country when the Joint Delimita tion Commission was appointed at the end of the year (1901). 26. The British Commission consisted of Colonel Wahab, R.E , the same officer who conducted the survey of 1891-92, and of Lieutenant-Colonel Abud, of the Bombay Political Service. The latter had had much experience of Aden, and his knowledge of tbe tribes was probably greater than that of any other officer who could have been selected, 27. A survey party under Lieutenant Tandy. R.E., was attached to the Commission. On the Turkish side the principal Commissioner was Colonel Muslafa Rienzi and he had several colleagues. They travelled by land from Hodeida vid Sanah to Kataba, and the first meeting of the British and Turkish Commissions took place at Dthala on the 11th February 1902. # This place, 11 miles north of Dfchala, had been made the head-quarters of a Turkish district in 1872, although it seems to have been then actually in the possession of ihe Amir, f Called Suheb in Wahab’s map. con I960—26 er 28 The boundary to he demarcated by the Joint Commission extends from the straits of Bab-el-Mandeb in a general north-easterly direction to the oreat Arabian desert. The total distance m ^ ^ is something over 200 miles. Measured along the frontier the distance is, of course, grater perhaps 240 miles is not far from the mark. The point where the boundary leaves the sea is nearly 100 miles west of Aden. Kata ba the Turkish post on the Amiri frontier, roughly marks the centre of the line. It is north-north-west of Aden from which it is about 90 miles distant by road. The middle third of the frontier, that is, the Amiri and Haushabi borders, is the most important; for here the tribes under British protection are in contact with districts occupied by the Turkish garrisons, and directly administered by Turkish officials. It is here also that Turkish pressure has so persistently been exercised. Further, the principal trade routes lead through this part of the frontier. The south-western third is the Subaihi border. It is the nearest to Aden, but it is crossed by few roads, and the Turks do not appear to interfere much with the people in the tracts immediately beyond. Only at Bab-el-Mandeb, where they have forts and a garrison, does their influence appear to be directly exerted. The north-eastern part of the frontier, from the territories of the Amir of Dthala to the desert, is the boundary of the Yaffai-as-Satal, of tribes dependant on the small chiefship of Beda, and of Behan, the latter being ' district contiguous to, and connected with, the powerful tribe of the Upp Anlaki. 29. The protectorate of Aden is not confined to the immediate hinterland. It stretches for several hundred miles to the eastward, until it joins the territories of the Sultan of Muskat. The only habitable parts of this country are the coast districts, a belt which can hardly be more than 150 miles wide, and it is probably much less in most places. Beyond is the great desert. Our maps have the word “ Hadramaut ” printed over the whole region from Aden to Muskat, hut at the present day this name is applied only to the area drained by the Wadi so called, the upper (western) portion of which belongs to the Sultan of Shahr and Mokalla, a chief with whom we have a protectorate treaty. 30. By far the greater part of the frontier, including the whole of the central half, lies in a hilly or mountainous region, much of which is well populated and studded with villages and hamlets. It is a peculiarity of the country that the tops of the hills frequently expand into small plateaux which are closely cultivated. The Arab inhabitants are not ill disposed. In. fact, the general feeling of the country is distinctly in favour of the British, as opposed to the Turks. But the people are very ignorant, very conceited, and exceedingly suspicious. Like all mountaineers, they are jealous of their independence, and do not like the visits of strangers. Religious^ fanaticism is not especially strong, but it is a factor that las to be reckoned with and it has a way of making itself apparent at unexpect ed times and places British prestige is not high in Southern Arabia.* The thnnli ih Sar( !r ^ fi U t m U i° f Turke y as the greatest earthly potentate, and hough they dislike the Turks, they fear them more than they do the English. of the 6 m !f ^^elieve that Aden is only held by us at the pleasure during whip^ti an( \]^Turkish warship comes yearly to collect tribute, aunn 0 which time the iurkish flag is hoisted on the forts. breechdoadfJpq tri b es are well armed.

It follows that the strongest Chief cannot guarantee the behaviour to strangers of every part of his people. It is not possible to tell beforehand what may be the demeanour of any particular section, or village, in all circumstances. The preaching of a fanatical Sayad, a malicious story, or an unfounded suspicion, may suddenly change the attitude of a whole tribe, and throw unexpected obstacles in the way of carrying out any pre-conceived plan. 32. It was evident, therefore, that even if the Turks showed the most rea sonable spirit in the matter of demarcation, the nature of the country, and of its inhabitants, was such as to render occasional checks almost inevitable, and it was not to be supposed that the work would be very rapidly carried to a conclusion. 33- Unfortunately, the Turkish Commission was largely controlled by the local officials, and their attitude was anything but reasonable or conciliatory. Colonel Wahab reported, immediately after the first meeting of the Commissions, that the Turkish Commissioners had renewed the claim put forward by the Sultan of Turkey to suzerainty over the whole of Southern Arabia which the British Government had repeatedly refused to admit. He telegraphed :—“ Turkish Commissioners assert that all Southern Arabia belonged to the Sultan of Turkey prior to British occupation of Aden, and that British only obtained ikden after asking permission of Porte to establish a coal dep6t there, and that Amir and chiefs now under British protection held their countries under authority of Turkish firmans. Case for present delimitation apparently rests mainly on similar firmans, and if their authority is admitted, our whole position in Southern Arabia seems untenable. 31. It will be remembered that the Turks had completely abandoned Southern Arabia about 230 years before the British took Aden, and that this fact had been repeatedly impressed on the Porte. 35. As to the local boundary, the Turks claimed the whole of the Shairi, Jabal Jihaf, and Mafari, as belonging to the district of Kataba, although it was well known that the Shairi, as a tribe, were subject to the Amir, and that the other places were in the centre of the territory that had been ruled by the chiefs of Dthala for many generations. Negotiation on this basis being impossible, the Commissioners parted, pending reference to their respective Governments. But instead of awaiting the result of the reference, the Turkish local officials proceeded to emphasize their assertions by taking possession of the territory in dispute. They occupied Mafari, and they established a strong post on Jabal Jihaf, a most commanding position. Their small post at Jalela was increased to several hundred men with artillery, and finally, finding that these movements were not actively resented, a cordon of Arab levies was drawn across the plateau at the southern end of which'Dthala is situated. This line, which partly encircled the village of Dthala and the camp of the British Com mission, was maintained as if it were a frontier to be guarded against invasion. The Amir was cut off from all his villages on the plateau, and reduced to considerable difficulties in the way of supplies. No party from the British camp was allowed to cross theline, and in several instances our people were actually fired on. 36. Purther, the British Commissioners had reason to believe that the Turkish officials were endeavouring to stir up against them the Arab tribes on their own side of the frontier. In April, Colonel Wahab had information of a gathering beyond the Tiban, which was apparently got together for the purpose of attacking the British camp, but it was said that the Sheikhs refused to lead their men in such an enterprise unless the Turks attacked first, and so the plan fell through. Nevertheless, the position of the Commission, with its small escort, at a distance of nearly 90 miles from Aden gave the Resident some anxiety, and he was anxious to reinforce it with British troops, but this was not at the time considered desirable. 37. As soon as the Turks had secured Jabal Jihaf and Mafari, they claimed the whole of the western and south-western hill districts, Azraki, Mehrabi, Ahmadi and Humedi, which drain to the Tiban. Thus the Amir was8 left with nothing on the plateau hut the village of Dthala itself, and of the rest of his territories only a fragment remained in his possession. The principal Sheikhs of the country which the Turks thus endeavoured to absorb were replaced by Turkish nominees, who were supported by detachments of I urkish troops, and by irregular levies of Yemen Arabs armed with nnes. 38. On 7th April 1902, Colonel Wahab addressed a letter to the Govern ment o*f India forwarding a sketch map, on which was shown, by a red line, the boundary of the dominions of the Amir of Dthala, as claimed by the British Commissioners, after enquiry into the actual circumstances, and an examina tion of the documentary evidence produced by the Amir. Owing to the restrictive action of the Turks, the knowledge of the country obtained by the Commission was far from complete, but the Commissioners felt justified in recommending their red line for adoption as the boundary of the British Pro tectorate. The line represented the limits of the country of which the Amir was in effective possession at the time when demarcation was proposed by the Turks. It ran “ from a point on the mountain range north-east of Kataba, between the Mares and Shaibi tribes, leaving Mares on the Turkish side, and thence between Kataba and Sanah, so as to include on the British side the Amiri villages in the Wadi-as-Safiya, and the tribes subject to the Amir in the Tiban valley, viz., the Humedi and Ahmadi. Thence it followed the boundary of those tribes until it reached the Haushabi border on the Am Amma range.” The Amir also had claims to Kataba, and to considerable tracts of country beyond it, which had no doubt been ruled by his predecessors, or some of them, in the time of the Imams. 39. The boundary claimed by the Turks was at an average distance of about 15 miles from, and within, the line drawn by the British Commissioners. It was evident that these two boundaries were wholly irreconcilable, and that one or the other would have to be entirely rejected. 40. In advocating the adoption of the line shown on the sketch map, Colonel Wahab wrote:—“This will involve the evacuation of the Turkish positions at A1 Jalela, and on Jabal Jihaf and Mafari, which evidence shows to have been occupied or retained by the local officials, in spite of repeated assurances by the Multan s Government to the contrary. Occupation under such circumstances cannot be considered to establish any rights over the localities and I would submit that no settlement of this boundary can be satisfactory that does not provide for the withdrawal of Turkish troops from them, and from the whole of the Amir s territory.” 41. The behaviour of the Turks, as reported by the British Commission, seemed so inconsistent with the spontaneous offer of the Porte to delimit, that Her Majesty s Government were for the moment in doubt as to what course to pursue. It was even thought possible that the British Commissioners were exceeding their instructions. But little attention had been paid to Dthala ahairs m the past, and there was an impression, based on mislefdin- informa tion origmaliy furnished by a native official, that the general line of the Amiri frontier was sufficiently wei! defined by the limits of the survev of 1891 S and that the only difficulties in delimitation would be those of detail It was not understood, therefore, why the British and Turi-^K p • • aU ' T . a , 3 total ly different frentfe,, ^ rel^st^r^S Commission, no “was xaken. ine lurks were not slow to take advantage of mno-. mu out that the British had abandoned their claims to the disputed terrto'v^and tha the reinforcement of the British escort had been stoned bv dS’f the Arlh J e t COn - a H tlQOple ' They 3130 P ™ 06 * 1 * 1 within tdreiToordon of Arab posts as it the country were actual!v their own • i • • larly worthy of note.

On the 19th April, His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople telegraphed to the Foreign Office that definite instructions had been sent to the Yemen authorities to direct the Turkish Commissioners to proceed with the definition of the actual frontier, and to observe a friendly and conciliatory attitude in their negotiations with the British Commissioners. The obstructive attitude displayed by the Turkish Commission appeared to be chiefly due to Abdulla Pasha, the Mushir, or Military Commandant, of the province of Yemen, a personage sufficiently powerful to overshadow the Wali, or Governor. Abdulla Pasha was said to have denied that there was any Imperial order to delimit the frontier between the “Sanjik” of Taiz and the nine cantons, and he had reported that he had firmans showing that the chiefs of the latter had received their authority from the Sultans of Turkey. The Grand Vizier had, however, insisted on these documents being sent to him, as there was no record of the alleged facts in the archives of the Porte, and he had then found that the firmans were from the Imams of Sana, before the Turkish occupation of 1873. On 13th May, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Lord Lansdowne) sent a telegram to the Ambassador in which His Majesty’s Government, though by no means admitting the line claimed by the British Commission, declared that the Turkish Commissioners had used the proposed demarcation as a pretext for forcibly occupying places claimed by them, and that this could not be tolerated. The Ambassador was to urge that no Turkish force, except the escort of the Turkish Commission, was to cross the line which had so far been considered to be our frontier (that is, the limit of Wahab’s survey of 1892), or to remain on oar side of it, and that no acts of occupation should take place within it. 43. On 26th May the Viceroy of India (Lord Curzon), telegraphing to the Secretary of State for India, proposed a certain line as the Amiri boundary. He said: “ We clearly cannot speak to Turkey with decision until we can agree upon the line we claim. The line I suggest is justified by the map, and I strongly urge His Majesty’s Government to insist upon it and upon the with drawal of the Turkish posts within it. Further, I think we should protest in the strongest terms against the improper action of the Turks in asserting their claims by force and expelling the Amir’s men from villages while a peaceful Commission is sitting. We should also threaten to withdraw from the Com mission, and ourselves have recourse to force in the assertion of oar claim, unless the Turkish local officials are immediately instructel to withdraw their forces. As matters stand, the position of our Commission is most undignified, an 1 in my opinion Wahab’s escort should be strengthened by a regiment of infantry and a mountain battery, and he should be instructed, in the event of the Turks not withdrawing, to tarn them out of the places they have recently seized.” 4t. At Aden the situation caused great uneasiness, not only on account of the possible danger to the British Commission, but because the high-handed measures of the Turks were having an effect on all tne tribes in the protectorate. The impression made by the Ad Dareja incident had been completely swamped by the Turkish aggressions on the territory of the Amir of Dthala, and the derogatory position in which they had placed onr Commissioners. Even the tribes in the immediate neighbourhood of Aden showed signs of weakened loyalty and decreasing respect for the British Government. On 6th June the Resident wrote : “ I do not doubt that every chief in the protectorate is keenly watching the progress of events on the Hthala plateau, and is more or less affected fiy the ascendancy which the Turks have been able to display in that quarter. Tt will not be surprising if some of them decide that it will bo better to be on what appears to be the stronger side, and should the dolimitatiou finally sever from the Amir any of the territory now paying him revenue, our influence, already diminished, will, I am afraid, reach a very low ebb.” 45. At the end of June, His Majesty’s Government decided, at the sugges tion of the Viceroy, to summon the Resident to London to take part in a conference at which the Ambassador at Constantinople was to bo present. During General Maitland’s absence, Colonel Abud took charge of affairs at Aden as officiating Resident. The conference was somewhat delayed by His Majesty’s Coronation and other matters, but it met at the b’oreigu Office early con 1960—-3■ , m 10 in August, with the result that the various di fioulties which had arisen re-ardinc, the line which should be claimed by His Majesty s Government as theAmm boundary, were cleared up, and it was decided that tne red line on the map which accompanied Colonel Wahab s despatch of 7th pn 1 02 should 1 be provisionally accepted, subject to further inquiry m the actual localities. This was necessary, as owing to the action of the lurks these localities had at that time been only partially visited. 46 On 18th August instructions were sent to the Charge d Affaires at Constantinople in which His Majesty’s Government, after recapitulating the nroceedino-s of the Turks in the Amiri district, went on to say it is under stood that°the Turkish Commissioners seek to justify these proceedings by claims that the territory occupied is by right Turkish This, however, is a view which is wholly unfounded, and from which His Majesty s Government must altogether dissent. They have never admitted that the post of Jalela, which has for some years been occupied by a Turkish force, and some adjoining villages which appear to recognise Turkish jurisdiction, are by right Turkish. They did not, however, think it necessary to claim the evacuation of these places as a precedent to the meeting of the Commission, which was in their view intended, in the first instance, to ascertain and define the state of affairs existing at the time of its appointment. They must, however, formally protest against the acts cf occupation, effected by force in some cases, which have taken place during the recent discussions, and they think it necessary to demand, before the work of the Commission proceeds further in this part of the frontier, that the Turkish regular troops and irregular levies shall be withdrawn from all places thus recently occupied. ,, “ This measure appears to them essential, if any success is to be attained by the Commission, and they must earnestly insist on the necessity of cate gorical orders being sent to this effect, and to their being eff ctively and com pletely carried out. In the contrary case, His Majesty’s Government would reluctantly he compelled to enter a formal protest against the attempt to decide by force questions at issue between the two Governments, and to reserve to themselves the right of taking such measures as they may deem necessary for the protection of their interests.” 47. Meantime, Sir N. O’Conor had suggested that, if the dead-lock as to the Amiri border continued, the British Commissioners should be told to proceed with the delimitation of the north-eastern part of the boundary (see paragraph 28) right up to the desert, “ so as not to leave a gap for the Turks to pass behind the Yaffai country to the Hadramaut.” Directions in this sense were accordingly sent to Colonel Wahab ; but on his inviting the Turkish Commissioners to co-operate in delimiting the border north-east of the Amiri country, they declared themselves unable to do so without special instructions Irooa the 1 orte; and on ids informing them that he had orders to proceed with the demarcation singly, if they refused to assist, they replied that the movement of the British Commission into either the Shairi or the Shaibi country would be regarded as a violation of the Ottoman frontier, and treated accordingly. Further, they entirely declined to recognise the Yafiai as one of the “ nine fribes ” within the British sphere and claimed the whole of their country as luikish. Colonel lYahab reported that this claim rendered 1 utile any proposal to continue demarcation north-eastward, and he ur^ed the necessity lor obtaining a definite and uninistakcable recognition from the Porte that the nine tribes were these enumerated in the Governor-General of India’s despatch of 11th April 1873, enclosed in Lord Granville’s despatch to the Ambassador at Constantinople of the 15th May 1873. 48. On 20th September 1902, the {secretary of State for India informed the Viceroy that His Majesty s Ambassador/ had spoken verv seriously to tbe Porte, demanding the evacuation of the places in the Amir of Dthaia’s territory recently occupied by Turkish troops ; also that the Yaffai should be formally recogmzed by Turkey as one of the nine cantons, and that the frontier of the Yafiai country north-east to the desert should be delimited. Instructions to this effect had been sent by the Grand Vizier to the Yemen officials on the loth, anc oiont a a was to report, as soon as possible, whether they were being carried out. J °11 f* 49. The instructions of the Grand Vizier were, however, almost immedi ately qualified by the assertion that Jabal Jihaf and Mafari belonged to the Turkish district of Taiz, and that therefore the troops there could not be with drawn. On 5th October Colonel Wahib reported that, so far from with drawing, the Turkish local officials were contemplating a further advance, their objective in this case being Jabal A was*, the chief possession of the Ahmadi, which is six to eight miles south-west of Mafari. The Ahmadi Sheikh had appealed to him for assistance, which he was of course unable to afford. In Colonel Wahab’s opinion the small tribes to the west and south-west of Dthala (the Ahmedi, Rumedi, &amp;c.) would not be able to much longer resist the pressure put on them by the Turks, and he strongly urged the importance of moving up troops to occupy the country claimed by us on behalf of tho Amir of Dthala, adding that he was convinced that the Turks would concede nothing until they saw that we were prepared to enforce our demands. On 6th November the Resident telegraphed to the effect that whatever might be the result of the negotiations at Constantinople, he doubted whether the Turkish posts would be withdrawn without a display of force. This seemed the more probable as Husen Helmi Pasha, the Governor-General of Yemen, had resigned, or been recalled, and the Mushir, Abdulla Pasha, appeared to be master of the situation. He advooated the despatch of a small column from Adeu, transport for which should be entertained without further delay; also that troops in India should be warned for service in Southern Arabia, and that they should embark for Aden not later than 30th November, if the Tuiks were then still holding out. 50. His Majesty’s Government, however, did not think that the move ment of troops was advisable at the moment, though Lord Curzon was informed that it might be expedient to take preliminary measures by warning some troops in India for field service, and by providing equipment for a small column to be furnished by the Aden garrison. 51. The Ambassador at Constantinople had, on 1st November, obtained an &lt;c Trade,” or Imperial order, from the Sultan, which granted the British demands for the withdrawal of Turkish troops from the places recently occupied, and for the commencement of demarcation north-eastwards, pending the discussion and settlement of the Amiri frontier on the reports of the Commis sioners of both countries. This Irade, only obtained by Sir N. O Conor after much insistence, appeared to be satisfactory. Its text, when translated into English, was as follows “ His British Majesty’s Embassy has heen so good as to address to the Porte a request for the determination and placing of pillars on the line of demarcation between the vilayet of the Yemen and the nine cantons, as well as the withdrawal of the Imperial troops recently sent to Jabal Jihaf, Mafari, Lakhmat-as-Saleh, and Suheb (Shahad), in the neighbourhood of the canton of Amiri. With a view to arriving at an amicable solution of the question, the Imperial Government have decided that the said points should for the present be evacuated by Imperial troops, in order that the delegates of the two States may be able, after enquiry, to pronounce on the question on which side these points are to remain, so that action may be taken accordingly, and that delimitation may be carried on at once towards the north-east, that is to say, towards the desert. If at the time of delimitation the said delegates do not come to an agreement, this divergence snail be settled, after examination, between the Ottoman and British Governments.” 52. The presence of His Majesty’s ship Harrier at Hodeida_ at the instance of the Ambassador appears to have had an influence on the decision to withdraw the Turkish troops from the disputed territory, especially as ±lis Excellency hinted that if the question were not settled prompt y, * was probable that other ships would be sent there. 53. The Turkish local officials and Boundary Commissioners, however, did not interpret the instructions in the Irade in the mi % were understood by Sir N. O’Conor and His Maje^ y s o . y * Properly Jabal Am Hadmaintained that the orders as to withdrawal referred only to re 0 ular troops, and did not affeot their Arab leries, which they accordingly continued to maintain “ Suheb” thev affected to understand as meaning the southern part of the Shairi country, Jabal Shahad being, they affirmed, a part of Jalela, which was not mentioned in the Irade. With regard to the north-eastern delimitation the Turkish Commissioners continued to refuse to admit that the latiaiand Aulaki were included in the nine tribes, and they still claimed the Shairi and Shaibi, and all the Amiri country to the east and north-east of Jalela. Their idea of delimiting north-east was in fact to go south and south-east, and having struck the Bana river, to follow its course to the Fad thl i border, and then alone: that to the sea, thus cutting off from Aden not only the Upper Yaffai and Upper Aulaki, but all the tribes to the eastward with whom protectorate treaties had been concluded. The only effect, therefore, of this Irade was the withdrawal of the Turkish regular troops from Jabal Jihaf and Mafari (there were none at that time at Lakhmat-as-Saleh), and this was neutralized by the continued presence of the Arab levies. The Turkish Commissioners further declined to take partin a joint survey of the Amiri territory in dispute, and they made so many difficulties regarding any survey at all, that Colonel Wahab finally agreed to the compilation of the map required to illustrate the situation for the information of the two Governments, from the existing maps on either side. 54. Colonel Wahab also reported that, in spite of the endeavours of the British Commission to establish friendly relations with their Turkish colleagues, the attitude of the latter continued to he one of suspicion, and even of hostility. At night the Turkish patrols were pushed out from Jalela to within a short distance of the British camp, and by day their Arab levies watched every movement. Shots were fired at the camp on the night of the 24th November, and somewhat later a solitary unarmed sepoy having strayed out of camp towards Jalela, was fired on by Arab levies from that place. Colonel Wahab further informed the Resident at Aden that it would be necessary to occupy Dthala with a force approximately equal to the Turkish force at jalela, which, when reinforced by the garrisons to be withdrawn from the other posts, would amount to not less than 400 men 'with. 4 or 5 guns, and the Resident telegraphed for permission to mobilize the Aden column and to purchase 1,000 camels. 55. Colonel Wahab also proposed, in a letter to the Resident dated 16th November, that treaties should be entered into with the Yaffai-as-Sufal (Upper Yaffai) and the Upper Aulaki, and on the 18th November he wrote that he did not consider it would be possible for the Commission to move to the north-east until a satisfactory understanding had been come to with the Sultans and Sheikhs of the former, for, in spite of their expressed desire for British protection, the jealousies of rival factions would make an advance into their country a very hazardous proceeding until their full support had been secured 00 . ine question or treaties with these tribes had in fact been engaging Foreign Department letter ^ 0 f att ® nt ) on of the Aden Residency for some time No. 1102 -E.A., dated 8th . ^ ar k a bk _ as July 1901 the Viceroy of India July 1901 . liad desired the Resident * to report on the desirability „ , .f' c o noludin S treaties with the Upper Yaffai (Taffai- Y an f, CPPer Aulaki, also with the minor chiefships of Beda and Behan; and the Resident had expressed an opinion in farour of making formal a&lt;wee- ments with all the north-eastern tribes.

The Resident, however, had again pressed for permission to negotiate the treaties, and in July 1902 the Government of India addressed His Majesty’s Government advocating their immediate conclusion. 57. It is necessary to mention here tbit Colonel Abud, who had been acting for the Resident while the latter was in England, did not revert to the Commission when General Maitland returned, but took leave. It was then ■ade ^ ^ ^EL ^ decided that Mr. G. H. Eitzmaurice, the Second Dragoman at the Constanti nople Embassy, should be appointed to the Demarcation Commission as Joint Commissioner. It was anticipated that Mr. Eitzmaurice’s command of the Turkish language, and his experience of Turkish officials, and methods of busi ness would render him a valuable colleague to Colonel Wahab. Mr. Eitzmaurice HZj ftJTTjy J reached Aden about the middle of November, and joined the Commission at Dthala on the 23rd of that month. *0WRaen 58. On 2nd December His Majesty’s Government agreed to the escort of the British Commission being reinforced by a part of the small column which had been equipped at Aden, and approved of a battalion being sent from India tooi &amp; efe af ::cr m to strengthen the Aden garrison. Sir N. O’Conor was to explain to the Porte that the object of increasing the escort was to provide the necessary support to the troops that would actually accompany the Commission while demarcation was in progress, and was in no way aggressive. The communication to the Porte was to precede any movement of troops. lewiffi if x tj m L J :ra?] Ife litk i {or&amp; _J &lt;iL IKX ^ • ppymM 59. The joint map compiled from existing maps (paragraph 53) was completed by the end of November, and a copy was forwarded to the Govern ment of India during the first week in December, the original signed by both British and Turkish Commissioners being sent direct to the India Oifice. The map was accompanied by a Memorandum and documents which presented the case for the boundary claimed by the British Commissioners in a very clear and complete manner. On this map the boundary was shown by a green line which nearly coincided with the provisionally accepted red line of the sketch toed ki iri (Ufr tisaikii on the map by a blue line. The area between the lines (of very irregular shape) comprised altogether about TOO square miles of country, most of it well i r^j; sn: jaeii' tecs®, W [FTT 1 T SJ populated. 60. On 4th December Colonel Wahab reported that although the Turkish regulars had been withdrawn from Jibaf and Mafari, the Turkish authorities continued to support the persons nominated by them a-* the sheikhs of those places, wdth paid Arab levies, and that the rightful Siieikhs and their immediate adherents, who had taken refuge at Dthala, were still unable to return, and - soa^ igf {jtllO were almost in a state of destitution. On the 12th he wrote that the lecogni- tion of the Yaffai as one of the “ nine tribes ” was still refused by the Turkish Commissioners. Until the Turkish Commission received distinct orders cn this desb^ rii (^’ Turfc &gt; ina ;:e^' point, and were informed that the frontier line was to run in a north-easterly direction from Lakhmat^as-Shub, between the Mares district and the Shaibi district of the Yaffai country, it would be impossible to proceed with demarca tion to the north-east. 61. While the Turkish Commissioners thus continued to maintain an impracticable attitude, both as regards the Amir of Dtha'a s country and also out®*; ?r 1^ 1 fjils J!It by the Ottoman Ambassador in London regarding the conduct of the British Commissioners. At one time it was asserted that they were distributing re peating rifles to the Arabs ; at another, that they had moved to Lakhmat-as- SUmh withrmt thp rorment of the Turkish Commissioners : and again, it was said fctu* iris ^ * ** i coi&amp;!‘ that thev were preparing for an “ expedition ” into the Yaffai country. Eurther complaints were made of attacks alleged to have been made by the Subaihi con 11)60— 1-14 tribe in the vicinity of Bab-el-Mandeb on Turkish Arabs living north of the Straits The former complaints were completely baseless; and the latter, when not fictitious, referred only to the ordinary petty warfare continually going on between tribes who are hereditary enemies, and which the Turks and ourselves are equally powerless to prevent. 62. On 22nd December Mr. Fitzmaurice addressed a special report on the o-eneral situation to His Majesty s Ambassador at Constantinople. He had been directed to pay particular attention to two questions first, the re-occupation by the Amir of Dthala of the territory from which he had been expelled by the Turks; secondly, the point from which the north-east demarcation should start. Mr. Fitzmaurice’explained the existing situation in forcible terms. He pointed out'that the Ottoman Government, acting on the inadmissible pretension that the sovereign rights of the Sultan, arising from the occupation of the 16th and 17th centuries, had not been impaired by the subsequent 242 years of enforced and complete absence of Turkish rule, bad been endeavouring, and with a large amount of success, to split up the tribes with a view to their gradual absorption. This policy, in the case of the Haushabi, had been put a stop to by the Ad Dareja incident, while the arrival of the Boundary Commission had served to expose their similar methods with respect to the Amiri. It was their unjustifiable military occupation of Jalela and the adjoining villages, coupled with the reluctance of His Majesty’s Government to take the necessary steps to compel their evacuation, which enabled the Turkish Government to render impossible the Commission’s efiorts to arrive at a fair settlement of the Amiri border and to delimit it. The present situation (unchanged by the withdrawal of the Turkish regulars from Jabal Jihaf and Jabal Mafarij, was that the Turks had drawn a line from Jabal Mafari round by the Kharba ridge to Jalela, and thence south-east by Jabal Shahad, a line which they made us respect by force; that is to say, the situation contemplated, and suggested, by Lord Dufferin in 1886 had been reversed to our disadvantage. Any one found in proximity to the line was at ouee fired on by the Turks or their levies, action which they explained as necessitated by their rules of field service (reglement de campagne); in other words, they considered the present state as one of war, and not of friendly negotiations. Mr. Eitzmaurice then explained the unfortunate position of the Amir, who was deprived of a large portion ot his revenue, and threatened with the perma nent loss of two-thirds of his territory, notwithstanding the repeated assurances of the Porte that that territory would be respected. “ The disastrous effect of the failure of this Commission to afford him the measure of protection he claims, has reacted on the neighbouring units of the nine tribes, and the Commission’s recent dealings with the 1 affai have shown clearly that they have been un favourably influenced by the events of the current year, thus renderin 0, the task of delimitating their boundary much more difficult than it would otherwise have been. The basis of friendship and loyalty to us of the nine tribes is their detest ation of oppressive Turkish misrule, as seen in Yemen, and their dread of its extension to their own territory ; but during the last year they have seen but the apparent strength of the Turks, and the apparent weakness of the British, and they dread the result ot openly committing themselves to what may prove o e le wea er si e. -H* Titzmaurice went on to recommend the immediate reinstatement of the Amir in the territory from which he had been excluded by the lurks during the past year, and with regard to the point of departure for the north-east demarcation, he showed that it must be near the village of Lakhmat-as-Shub, but that it could only be accurately determined when the ^ i mVe thei V nd ? btaiQed COm P lefce freedo ^ of movement. He tmally stated his opinion that the source of all present and past trouble w as the Turkish military occupation of the village of Jalela. “The difficulty arsis Jmuarv 1903 fe. agr *? h , 58 l started for D thala on the 2nd lualSl no Nnt ?

In consequence of representations from Colonel Wahab, a Natire Mountain Battery was ordered to Aden, in addition to the battalion already sanctioned. 65. The column reached Dthala on 10th and 11th January, thus raising the total British force to about 900 men, including artillerymen, and a few native sappers and camel sowars of the Aden Troop. The Turks had also increased their garrisons at Kataba and Jalela, and now had about 850 men between the two places, with seven mountain guns and one field gun, all modern breech-loading weapons. It was further reported that they were raising a body of 600 Arab levies. 66. The presence of the Turkish force at Jalela, and its practically hostile attitude, made it impossible for the British Commission to advance to Lakhmat- as-Shub, as the line of communication with Dthala was completely commanded and in Turkish hands. The Commission also found it difficult to open negotia tions with the Yaffai Sheikhs with a view to coming to an arrangement for the passcage of the Commission along their frontier, supposing the Turks agreed to demarcation in that direction. 67. An incident which occurred at this time emphasized the necessity for terminating in some manner the extraordinaary situation on the Dthala plateau. Lieutenant Tandy, R. E., the officer in charge of the Commission Survey party, was attacked by an Arab within a short distance of the camp and received a spear wound in the hip. The assailant ran away across the Turkish line, and could not be followed, although the incident took place in broad day light. 68. On 20th January Lord Curzon despatched a telegram to His Majesty’s Government strongly urging that the question of the Amiri boundary should be settled without further delay, and advocating a prompt display of force, either by sending a considerable body of troops to Dth ila, or by a naval demonstration at Hodeida, qr both. His Excellency said:—“ Every representation we have hitherto made has been endorsed by Mr. Fitzmaurice’s report; and our strong recommendation is that we should use the present opportunity to settle the main question, and not merely minor and petty issues. There will be no peace on the Dthala border whilst the Turkish occupation south of Kataba continues. The green line on Wahab’s map of 2nd December is supported by powerful arguments and strongly advocated by Mr. Fitzmaurice, and it seems to us that we are now justified in demanding its acceptance as the frontier. We emphatically' urge that the political pivot of the whole question is the Dthala plateau, and that any settlement which leaves its future in protracted dmbt will be valueless.' 69. Almost at the same time the British Ambassador at Constantinople succeeded in obtaining another Irade from the Sultan. On the 21st January Sir N. O’Conor telegraphed to Mr. Eitzmaurice that the following demands had been agreed to by the Sultan :— “ (1) Yaffai to be considered one of the nine cantons. “ (2) Irregular levies to be withdrawn. “ (3) Authority of Amir, as exercised in October 1901, not to be disturbed. “ (4) Delimitation north-eastward from Lakhmat-as-Shub to the desert frontier.’’ He added, however, that the instructions to the Yemen authorities fell short as usual of the agreement, but that nevertheless they might help the Commission considerably. The orders actually telegraphed by the Porte to the Turkish Commissioners appear to have been as follows :— First *—That the irregular levies were to be disbanded.16 Secondly —That while any alteration of the present status of the four oeconaoy : rp&lt;*#&gt;rved for subsequent settlement between evacuated points was to be reserveu tot Dflia i a weT . ft the two Governments, the existing rights of the Amir ot Uti a a not to he interfered with. Thirdly .—The Yaffai were to be recognized as included among the nine cantons’ but disputed tracts were to be reserved. Fourthly .—The Commissioners were to proceed with the delimitation ■north -oast,ward to the desert. 70 The actual results obtained by this Irade were the disappearance of the Arab levies and the recognition of the Yaffai as one of the nine tribes But the latter was neutralized for demarcation purposes by the reservation of disputed districts for discussion between the two Governments, while no men tion was made of the place from which the demarcation north-eastwards was to start. The Yaffai section adjoining the Amiri country is the Shaibi, and beyond them to the north-east are several small districts, viz., Navva, Juban, Rubiaten and Dabiani, which are also Yaffai territory, though the in habitants are not Yaffai tribesmen. The Turkish Commissioners refused to recognise either the Shaibi, or any of the other places just named^as Yaffai, alleging that they were integral parts of the Turkish districts of Kataba and Rada. Their claims to the Shaibi country appeared^ rest on a very temporary occupation, which was brought to an end by their expulsion at the hands of the Shaibi themselves; while from the other places they had at times extorted some revenue, as they had done from Ahmadi, Mehrabi and other tribes which have much the same relation with the Amiri as Nawa, Juban, &amp;c., have with the Yaffai. 71. Early in Eehruary His Majesty’s Government agreed to the despatch of additional troops to Aden as proposed by the Viceroy. The normal garrison of Aden consists of one British battalion (only 600 strong), one Native battalion, a company of Sappers (Natives), three companies of Royal Garrison Artillery, and the “ Aden Troop ” of 50 Indian horsemen, and 50 camel sowars. The garrison had been temporarily increased by a battalion and a half of Native Infantry, but, on the other hand, nearly half a battalion had been sent over to Somaliland. The Native Mountain Battery mentioned in paragraph 64 had by this time landed and was on its way to Dthala with a small escort. The reinforcements from India consisted of the 1st Battalion, Hampshire Regiment, at full strength (about 900 rifles). No. 6 British Mountain Battery, and half of the l2;lrd rifles (Native Infantry), the head-quarter wing of which regiment was already in Aden. The Government of India were prepared to send more Native Infantry, but the Resi dent, in view of the difficulty of feeding troops in the hinterland of Aden, and of the expense involved, thought that the extra half battalion would suffice. The 1st Battalion, Dublin Eusiliers, who, under ordinary circumstances, would have gone to England on relief by the Hampshires, were retained, and no time was lost m setting them in motion for Dthala, together with the Mountain Battery and t ^ e23ld rifleS ‘ Careful arrangements were necessary on account of the nature ol the country, and the scarcity of w r ater in some places, which oblio-ed the troops to march m a succession of small bodies. ° , , 72 ‘ A str ong detachment, with guns, was also placed at Dar Akkai between Nobat Dakim and Musemir, in order to cheek a possible advance i lurkish troops from Taiz, where there was a considerable garrison. . n 73 *, ^ ean time, Lord Lansdowne had telegraphed to the Charge d’Affair at Constantinopie instructing him to inform the Turkish Minister of EoreE Affairs that His Majesty’s Government could not tolerate any further prolon th Ti eX i St ^ S n Uati0n 0n the frontier between the nine cantons at onTnitn.f he *fw^ lsh Co J mmissloner » ^ was stated, had been directed to demai compliance with the conditions which had already been accepted by the SulD (see paragraph 69) and which were now repeated and emphasized. In the eve Ma 8 n0t . being P unctuall y fulfined &gt; ^ would be necessary for h ^ aCrVth? make USe ° f force in order to re store order, and t authority of the Amir of Dthala in the territory now in dispute.74. An allusion was also made to tlie information wliioli had been received by His Majesty’s Government that fifteen battalions were being sent to Yemen by the Turkish Government, and the telegram concluded with an intimation to be conveyed to the Porte that British warships were on their way to Aden, and would proceed, if necessary, to Hodeida and Mocha. The cruisers Hermione and Intrepid from the Mediterranean squadron had in fact been despatched to Aden, and they arrived there while the movement of troops to Dthala was proceeding. 75. A few days later, instructions were sent to Colonel Wahab to proceed, with an adequate escort, to ascertain whether the four places where the Turks had placed garrisons had been completely evacuated, and to disarm any Arabs likely to interfere with the rights of the Amir of Dthala. This done, the Commission was to proceed to Lakhmat-as-Shub and to call upon the Turkish Commission to meet them, but the camp of the Turkish Commission was to be at some point outside of the line claimed by the British Commissioners. 76. On 20th Pebruary Colonel Wahab reported that he had demanded compliance with the conditions, and that the Turkish Commissioners had promised to disband their levies, to cease interference with the authority of the Amir, and to withdraw to the neighbourhood of Kataba, in which case the garrison of Jalela would be reduced to about 50 men. The orders they had received from Constantinople, however, described Jalela as a military post in Ottoman territory, and against this Colonel Wahab strongly protested. With regard to his instructions to visit Mafari, Jabal Jihaf, &amp;c., in order to verify their complete evacuation, he pointed out that this was a proceeding which would involve con siderable risk, if carried out before the arrival of the reinforcements from Aden. Nevertheless, on the arrival of the first detachment, he went to Jihaf and Mafari with an escort, and at once reeeived a peremptory written demand from the Turks to withdraw immediately—a request which was, of course, disregarded. Mr. Pitzmaurice also reported that the Turks were profoundly, though wrong fully, irritated, but that it did not appear probable that their irritation would be translated into action. The Turks had not in fact any considerable force at hand. Taiz was the nearest garrison of any strength, but the appearance of British troops at Dar Akkam made them unwilling to weaken it. A few hundred men arrived in driblets from the north, but it is probable that the total numbers available were not equal to the British forces at Dthala, and hurrying up towards that place. 77. On 26th Pebruary Colonel Wahab visited Lakhmat-as-Saleh and reinstated the rightful Sheikh. The Turkish nominee had fled some days before, and was said to be trying to raise the tribes on the Turkish side of the border, in which endeavour he was receiving assistance from our old enemy, Muhammad Nasir Mukbil. The fourth place “ Suheb,” or Jabal Shahad, was to be evacuated when the Turkish Commission withdrew to Kataba. In the mean time, the Amir regained possession of his territories, and supplies began to reach the British camp from the Amiri country, from which it had been for so long cut off. 78. The Amir of Dthala now earnestly begged for the delimitation of his border before the Commission moved away elsewhere, and his request was strongly supported by the British Commissioners, and by the Resident. Lord Curzon had already urged His Majesty’s Government to the same course, point ing out that the Dthala plateau was the key of the whole question (paragraph 68). The Resident also reminded His Majesty’s Government that until we had bound the Yaffai and other tribes to us by some formal engagement, deli mitation to the north-east must necessarily involve risk, especially so long as the Turks remained in occupation of Jalela. 79. On 7th or 8th March, the last detachment of the reinforcements from Aden reached Dthala, where a month’s supplies for the force had also been accumulated. The whole movement was carried out, without a hitch, in five weeks from the date on which the order to collect camels was received in Aden. The total strength of the troops on the Dthala plateau, after the completion of con 1960—518 the movement, amounted to about 1,500 infantry, halt a company of sappers, and two mountain batteries, with a detachment of the Aden Troop, and two 7-pounder guns carried on camels—in all about 2,500 men and 8 mountain guns. 80. On 18th March the Secretary of State for India informed the Viceroy that the British Ambassador at Constantinople had been instructed to protest against the presence of Muhammad Nasir Mukbil on the frontier, and that Lord Lansdowne had complained of the retention of Turkish troops, though in diminished numbers, at Jalela, in the heart of the disputed territory. The actual instructions to Sir N. O’Conor were to demand the immediate removal of Muhammad Nasir Mukbil from the frontier, in accordance with the promise made by the Turkish Government after the Ad Dareja incident, but disregarded by their officials. He was also to require the complete evacuation of Jalela, and of any other posts still occupied by the Turks within the green line marked on the joint map submitted by the Commissioners. This evacuation had become absolutely necessary for the security of the British Commissioners, and for the undisturbed prosecution of the work of delimitation, but it would not prejudice the ulterior discussion of any evidence which the Turkish Government might wish to produce as to their title to territory within the green line. The military and naval measures of precaution which His Majesty’s Government had been compelled to take would, if these demands were not complied with, be maintained, and supplemented by further action, which His Majesty’s Govern ment would greatly prefer to avoid; whereas, should the demands be immediately complied with, it would be possible in soma degree to relax these measures. 81. On 9th March the Besident, with the approval of His Majesty’s Government, left Aden for Dthala, in order that, as General Officer Command, ing, he might be on the spot in the event of a collision taking place. The situ ation was to some extent critical, as the Turkish Commission had not moved away from Jalela, and they had sufficient force at that place, and at Kataba, to show fight if the last demands of the British Government had been resisted. The Governor of Taiz had just been to Jalela and had extracted from the inhabit ants of the village a declaration against being handed over to the “ Franks ” and there were other indications that an effort was being made by the local officials to upset the status^ qw which had just been restored. Possibly they still hoped to force the hand of their Government and to bring about a conflict, in which they tWht that ihey mght be victoriQM. Mr. Fitzmauriee was, however, con- Ual TVok*™ 8 T uld r bo un “ece8sary, and his expectations proved eorreet, for on the 18th March anlrade was issued in which His Maiesty Jalek 1 ^’ S 19 reservm S ^ sovereign rights, decreed the evacuation of Jalela, and the oommencement of demarcation in accordance with the line marked on the map signed by the respective Commissioners. aetins 2 Gove h rnov r of 1 V elegraphed by ° Grand Vizier t0 Abdulla Pasha, now sSoned 7 e . rC n* Ul ° WS : ~“.

(Repeated to Secretary of State, Bombay, and Constantinople,) P. — Wahab telegraphs, 14^A May, reporting Mr. FitzMaurice's opinion on the question asked in the Secretary of State's telegram of \0th May as follows :— “ It is apparently contemplated to carry cut actual joint delimitation of the North East frontier to the desert. Rada is furthest point to which small Turkish Commission could proceed. If they went beyond that place, they would require larger escort and supporting force than that ichich they have hitherto employed. They would certainly offer strong opposition to actual delimitation. Most likely way of procuring necessary topographical data for subsequent delimitation, or other decision between the two Governments, would be found in the issue of precise and categorical instructions to the Turks to make a joint survey of belt some 20 kilometres on both sides of the true line, Borth East from Lakmat-as-Shub to the desert. But the peculiar difficulties attending any joint work with the Turks would affect survey of these distHcts also. A supporting force as large as that assembled in Bthali in the spring of last year would be required to enable a British Commission to advance and survey up to neighbourhood of desert, while risk of friction, leading to possible serious conflict with natives, is, in my opinion, at least as great at it was at that time. This risk would be reduced to a minimum by attaching to any force on the line of communication a Bolitical Officer acquainted with Arabic and the methods of natives, and by subordinating, if possible, military to political side. Scarcity of supplies and great physical difficulties of the ground cannot be overlooked, while hostile Turkish religious influence would nave to be reckoned with.” %Foreign Office, May I8tii.fp 0 4 Sir.

My Lora:- On reading through General Maitland’s letter of 30th Decemter 1903, a copy of which was Included In the Confidential print, I venture to make a few re marks on the statements In the second Paragraph as they bear on the negotiations which have oeen in pro gress for some time past for the delimitation of a frontier of the Aden Protectorate up to the desert. Hadramaut proper comprises the country drain ed by the Wadi of that name, the chief centre coins Shiban, removed some distance from the coast, and t An-/* C'h pll T* r3JlCl MOlicll 1 &amp; ffic^ 01* whose chiefs the Jemadar of o may not have effective control. The situation there is clearly summed up in General Maitland’s -Description of Shehr and Mo^aUa sent with No. 283 Aden Residency of I8th August, 1901, which shows that the relations between the coast Govern ment and the interior are not always very close, and that iff Marquess of Lansdowne, K.G., &amp;C . , &amp;C ., &amp;c.that, the Chief of Shibam might easily lend himself to outside intrigues. The following paragraph which concludes a description of the inter-tribal war in 1.881 between rival chiefs of Mokalla, indi cates a danger which might easily occur unless the way was effectively closed to all Turkish intrigue:-? 'Finally it was decided that as the MokalJa Chief had appealed to the Turks for help, active assist ance should be given to the Jemadar,' the result being arm ed intervention of His Majesty’s Ship 'Dragon' in his behalf. Colonel Maunsell says that he believes there is a caravan route oetween Shibam and Sanaa, pass ing through the country o'f the Sheikhs of Yeshbum, the Upper Aulaki, and the Yaffai, and this feeing re moved some distance from the coast would afford a channel through which Turkish intrigues might easi ly pass without our knowledge. Moreover the ruling families of the Upper Yaffai and the Hadramaut have feeen connected for some centuries past, and this opens another way of intrigue for the Turks, who. priorffil- prior to the appointment of the present Delimitation Commission, were understood to have actually won over the Upper Yaffai and to he paying them a stipend; and further hy this means they hail commenced intrigues with the Hadramaut also. It would he therefore most unwise to trust solely to the geographical position of the Hadraaaut, and to - the somewhat shadowy control of the coast chiefs over the interior, to prevent the Turks ever gaining a foot' ing there. The treaties now concluded with the Upper Aulaki chief, and the Sheikh of Behan-el-Kassah, his dependent ought to go far towards closing the way for Turk!s’ intrigue in the Hadramaut.

I have received the following telegram, No. 35, dated thelOth May, from Colonel Wahab :— “ Al Akma is situated some 50 miles to the east of MoJtha ; it has been identified by our survey with a place marked on the War Office map as FI Khamar. The true border of the Atifi appears to extend to a point im mediately north of Dabab, while the Ruremi border, viz., Akkar, would seem to be in neighbourhood of Shebe. Thus the true Mar am limit would be a line ^rawn from El Khamar to the north of Dabab, Sheikh Said forming an enclave within it. See the telegram of the Ylth April from Sir N. O'Conor to FitzMaurice as to our interest in Sheikh Said; see also letter of the hth April last from Foreign Office to India Office. The claims of the Subaihi to this boundary are by no means shadowy ; they are supported by documentary and also by general oral evidence. Subject, however, to the approval of the Government of India, we are inclined to accept as boundary a line starting from latitude 13° 5', longitude 43° 49', and running nearly straight to Turba. This line would divide those of the Subaihi subjects who have been brought under Turkish influence within recent years from those who continue to pay to the Subaihi chiefs; it would, also follow in great part the watershed between the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. Some 550 square miles of Subaihi territory would be left to the Turks, if such a line were adopted ; the chief importance of the territory in question lies in its geographical situation, as it is but sparsely populated. 1 should be glad of instructions as to ‘ recording Subaihi, that is, British, preferential rights ’ to this territory in the event oj its being lejt to the Turks. Should this be embodied in documents passing between Bis Majesty's Government and the Turkish Govern ment, or should it be done when signed maps are being exchanged with the Turkish Commissioners ? &lt;**.

There is a considerable extent of terr itory which has paid tax to the Turks though really Subaihi. We are trying to get it surveyed, and this Subaihi claim, even if we do not insist upon it, is calculated to deter the Turks from preferring claims to territory east of Shekh Said, and it may also serve as a set-of against Turkish claims on other sections of the frontier, e.g., on the line north-east to the desert.' 4 'IKForeign Office, April S1st. r [go Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to transmit to yon, to be laid before the Secretary of State for India, the accompanying copy of a despafcA, as |$*^noted in the margin,relating to the destruction of the Andja tower by the Aden Frontier Commission. / am, Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, The Under-Secretary of State, India Office.CONSTANTINOPLE. April 1904. :lv Lord:- With reference to previous correspondence respecting the Aden frontier delimitation, I have the honour to report that the Sublime Porte informs me that they have received a telegram from the Acting Governor of Yemen stating that Colonel Wahab had complained to the Ottoman Commissioners that Abdullah Mohammed and the people of the Audja village had diverted certain water flowing from the Wadi Mufalis and belonging to the Subaihi clan, who threatened to resort to force if the matter were not set right. The Vali added that investigation had revealed no trace of such diversion, and that he only reported the incident because the Eng lish Commissioners had made a great deal of it. The Porte further state that in telegrams dated April 6th. Abdulla Pasha transmits a repoiu from the P 16 Marqu e s s o f Lan s down e, K. G., &amp;c., &amp;c .the Ottoman Commissioners to the effect that the Zerika clan belonging to the Caza of Hidjriye would not allow delimitation on their territory and had threatened to oppose by force of arms the proposed demolition of Ab dulla Mohammed’s house and they had come to an agree ment v/ith the Hurnedi, Sewaliha and Mukatara clans not to yield an inch of their ground. The Acting Governor then gives the version of the Ottoman Commissioners of the demolition of the Audja tower, of which I enclose a translation. I have pressed on the Minister for Foreign Affairs who entirely concurs in my view, that all differences respecting the frontier should be settled locally, so as to preclude the delays which would attend any settle- menu of questions left open by the Commission for nego tiation between the two Governments and Abdullah Pasha has been instructed accordingly and told to avoid ob- utiucuion and to facilitate the rapid progress of the work of delimitation. I have informed Mr. Fitzmaurice of our wishes inA \y ^ this respect and with reference to ray despatch No. 245 ' ! of the 5th. instant, I have reminded him of the views of His Majesty's Government with regard to the Western limit of our Protectorate and have warned him not to lose sight of our interests in Sheikh Said. I have, &amp;c., (Signed) N. R. O'Conor. Llyu) EXTRACT The Ottoman Commissioners were not the cause of any delays that might have occurred in the v/ork of de limitation. The tower, of which tne British Commis sioners had demanded the demolition, had not teen re cognized as belonging to the Sutaihi clan tut was one of the disputed points in regard to which maps and de tailed explanations were being forwarded by post. They had not been able to hit upon a method of demol ishing the tower in such a way as not to give rise to local disturbances. On the morning of the 4th, how ever, the British Commissioners, having pushed forward troops to points commanding the tower, had proceeded to level it with the ground together with another tow er in the same vicinity. In order to prevent Abdul lah Mohammed from giving rise to regrettable inci dents, the Commissioners had considered it necessary to request that a Battalion, stationed in the Hidjrije Kaza, should be sent to the spot. AMl ,llah PasM concludes .1th the assurance that iMp would of course be done to prevent everything possible would 01 disturbancesdisturbances, but he deprecates the action of the British Gormnissioners in proceeding to such measures in regard to localities as to which the two sides had failed to come to an agreement.

CONSTANTINOPLE. 5th. April 1904. My Lord:- LA r With reference to Your Lordship's telegram A No. 61 of the 2nd. instant and to my despatch No. 194 of y ; &gt; the 22nd, ultimo respecting the Aden Frontier, I heg leave to say that I entirely share the disappointment felt hy Your Lordship at the slow progress of the de limitation, though I am inclined to attribute it to un- f j I * i expected difficulties and circumstances rather than to had faith on the part at all events of the central Otto- man Government. I have seen copies of the telegrams recently &lt; sent hy the Grand Vizier to the Vali of the Yemen res pecting the Auja Tower etc., which were satisfactory, and yesterday His Highness read me a telegram of the 30th. ultimo warning him not to raise difficulties in regard to the delimitation as it might lead to unpleas ant Marquess of Lansdowne, K.G., &amp;c ., &amp;c.,unpleasant consequences. Both the Grand Vizier and the Minister for Foreign Affairs expressed to me yesterday their earnest desire to see the delimitation terminated. The Grand Vizier said the prolongation of the work of delimitation v/as unsettling the inhabitants and causing serious danger. As a proof of this he read me a Proclamation lately is sued by the Imaurn of Saada stating that the Sultan was selling the country to the Giaurs and calling upon all j true believers to oppose this. His Highness added | that the proclamation had been seized, some of the mes- sengers engaged in its distribution imprisoned and pre cautions taken to prevent the others reaching the in fluential chiefs living near the frontier from whom trouble might be anticipated. I fear there is no chance now of the Commission's demarcating the frontier of the Suhaihi Canton to the sea this season, but I have enquired of Mr. Fitzmaurice t.ier it would nou be possible for him and one of the Ottoman Commissioners to ride along the supposed fron- tierfrontier down to the coast so as to more or less settle the general line. My idea in proposing this was that it would facilitate matters when the regular delimita tion is resumed and thus prevent the Turks occupying in the meantime territory in dispute, and thus giving rise to incidents similar to those which preceded the issue of the Trade of 1901 and caused so much difficulty. His Majesty's Government holds that the British protectorate extends v/estv/ards to Has Turha. It may 'be however that the Subaihi have some pretensions or shadowy claims to territory still further West towards Sheikh Said, which although too unsubstantial to sup port effectively may nevertheless justify us in record ing such claim in a way that would give His Majesty's Government a preferential right to the territory in case of Turkish sovereignty being put in question. If Your Lordship approves of this idea, it would be v/ell to inform Mr. Fitzmaurice on the subject and, as he may be starting very shortly on his ride along the frontier, I have to-day sent Your Lordship my telegram No. 61.

Tne note by the Turkish Ambassador, transmitted to the India Office under cover of Gir T. Gandurson's latter cf 27th January 1904, says that the acting Governor General of Yemen re ported by telegram that a person named Galeh bin Bajeh, and some other inhabitants of the district {coimunt ) of Kamaora, after having collected about 40 followers in 'Harachib' (by which is apparently meant M Hawashib”, the country of the Haushabia) went to the village of Babin and fired several shots. We cannot at present discover who this Saleh bin hajah is, nor have v/e any knowledge of a district called Camaora, or of a village known as Zabin. The Sultan of Lahej, who would almost certainly have known of any raid into Turkish territory, and who would readily have informed us if the perpetrators of the alleged outrage had been ITaushabis or Subaihis, has heard nothing of any such occur- rencei nor can he recognize the places named. No one knows of any locality called Kamaora within the boundary of the Aden Pro tectorate, though a certain Say ad, who is a Turkish subject, says he believes that there is such a place on the Turkish side of the line. EnquiryEnquiry is being made of the HaushaM Sultan, who has ^ also been desired to restrain his subjects fro m making incursionc urkish territory, and a further communication will be made on receipt of has reply, out if any raid has been made, with his knowledge, by any of his people, it is hardly likely that he would admit it.

Strong pressure on Turkish Government would terminate present deadlock. »- ri Otherwise situation here is peaceful.” From Resident Aden, to British Ambassador, Constantinople, 30^ March 1904. {Repeated to Bombay, Calcutta, and Secretary of State.) Poliowing from PitzMaurice, dated 28th March :— “ No. 6. Turks have received two telegrams, one from Vali saying that demolition of tower depends on which side of boundary it lies ; and second from Grand Vizier sanctioning demolition ‘ provided both sides agree that ‘demolition will not cause disturbance(s).’ “ First question not having been decided, we have agreed to Turks dealing with matter, but they delare that Humedi Sheikh will give trouble, and that consequently they cannot demolish it without more categorical instruc tions. They state that they have telegraphed c that though hamlet of Auja is ‘ claimed by Humedi, it is separate(d) from territory of latter, whose evidence ‘ moreover, on the subject is deficient.’ Inference is that place is part of Subaihi canton, and if they receive instructions accordingly, solution will be simple. Some 60 miles in a straigth line to the sea remains. Demarcation of this length is already almost out of the question, while survey of it will soon become a physical impossibility owing to heat.” From Resident, Aden, to Foreign Secretary, Government of India, 2nd April 1904. {Repeated to Secretary of State and Bombay.)

A *^„ TA! _/• Al s~* . l !%^r » r jpj — —- - . - —, uuiutr. vvimc nappenect on our visit the spot with the lurks is recorded in our Diary of the 6th March. The Shu sub-tribe were formerly all under the Mansuri Sheikh, but for some years back those W. Shab and near Mufalis have come under the influence of the Turks, while the few Shujefi villages in W. Sihr, between Nabwa Sihr and Ja’ama have been partially absorbed by the Kubati Sheikh during the last three to four years. They, however, with the i\ Pc’ , ? [1861/—I B * l~v / /*o i i _ ^} ^ ^ * ^'7 'uLi 1 /IK IE. ^ Shujefi in Wadi Tukar, undoubtedly belong to the Mansuri, and a cbmpromise with the Turks on the subject is difficult. 9. The Turks will probably admit the whole of W. Nifakha, which has no cultivation or population, as Subaihi. 10- The Wadi Shah (vide Diary, entry of the 24th February) is partly Jurabi and partly Shujefi, while the upper two-thirds belong to the Ahl Shah, mentioned as a Subaihi sub division in Statement No. 1, in the Residency’s Memorandum on the Subaihi of the 14th January, sent in reply to Commission’s No. 354 of the 28th December, 1903. The Turks admit the Jurabi portion up to Lukema, while we have hesitated to claim the rest of the Wadi up to Nijd Shah. The whole Wadi was undoubtedly Subaihi until fifteen years ago or more, when the Turks established an irregular Customs' post in it. It appears they had first started it near N. Mikrad, but that on'an intimation from the then Sultan of Lahej that Shah was Subaihi, they removed it to the valley north-west of Doka. Through this Customs-post they have gradually brought the whole Wadi Shah above Lukema under their indirect control. 1 he basis of the status of 1901 would preclude our claiming the upper two-thirds of W, Shab, unless the Turks prove unreasonable about, a fair settlement, or continue their present obstructive attitude. 11. From Lukema the Turks wished to take the border to the top of J. Rabat and J. Kauwa, and thence down the W. Ma’adin to the hills west of the junction of the W. Ma’bak with the W. Ma’din. It is not an exaggeration to style this latter portion of their claim as outrageous, as jt was merely based on the fact that the tower (completed in 1902) and hamlet of Auja are inhabited by people of Humedi origin, who for two generations and up to quite recently have lived as peaceable subjects of the Jurabi in the territory of the latter. Auja is separated by a licit of some 3 miles of purelv Jurabi territory from the border of the Humedi in the W. Ma’bak, above Suleb. This portion of the claim, however, was practically settled by our camping near the old Jurabi shrine of Sanawi. 12. The Humedi are numbered among the subdivisions of the Dubeni Subaihi (&lt;nven in Appendix I to the Residency, Subaihi Memorandum of the 14th January, 1904)^ and some twenty odd years ago AH Mokbil, the father of the present Sheikh, appears to have been in relations with the Aden Residency. As, however, the tribe—which is not a large one is not Subaihi, we refrained from preferring a claim to them. Their territory has only once been visited by the lurks—about 1887. They are turbulent tribesmen, who have enriched themselves by the smuggling of fire-arms, and the behaviour of them and their Sheikh has been truculent in the extreme, while evidence points to this bein«- partly due to the connivance of the Turkish Commissioner, Zia Effendi. 13. Their eastern border is to the west of W. Suleb, while from the head of the latter to Auja the Subaihi border lies between the Jurabi and the Salihi. It has been impossible to get the ITumedi or Sahhi to answer questions regarding their tribal boundary. They content themselves—evidently a Turkish prompting—with making sweeping claims as to ‘the boundary of the Sultan of Roum.” The Turks profess inability, real or feigned, to control them; nor have they taken steps to overcome the alleged reluctance of their tribesmen to allow the survey of their border to be carried out. We } esteiday informed the Turks that, it, after three weeks of patience and forbear ance, no solution of the Humedi border was to be found, we should have to claim them on the grounds of their former relations with the British. This had the effect of making them take a more correct view of matters, and they practically agreed to the main Jurabi contentions on the subject. cc *1- ^ *‘ C [ e rem ?\ nec ^ ^ u j a &gt; 'Tich is the crux of the whole difficultv along this stretch ot frontier. Its position and the lie of the ground up to Mufalis is shown on the sketch map attached to this letter. it Th \ T 0l 1 d . bou ndary ^between the Subaihi and Athwari wa* from Husn Mufalis by umira Makhsuj to Mu aidira and Jubah. This is proved by oral evidence and by the ocurneiit bearing the seal of the Turkish Kaimakam, and certifying that the Kuraiha of an , , ‘ ^ u J/ e } a weie Subaihi subjects. This border appears to have been respected by the I in ks for many years, until they started their Customs at Doka, and felt it necessary to establish then- influence over the Shujefi and Jewazi subjects of the Subaihi in W Yunut (Vide tabulated list of each hereto attached.) This brought the Turks t d h,Rk ^ iu u here ' 0l . nlnal boundary existed up to a couple of years ago, when the Dai-abd-Muhammad of Auja was completed. f S u Itan 01 Labe j’ who occupied the Subaihi country for several years, HlkhElwJ H r n :i! a T and f a boundal 'y mark at Mola’. A line from there to . Usha and thence to the top of J. Nabat is the irreducible minimum that could be forced r*'3 -on the Jurabi. The spring of Mola’ is tlie “ life ” of their country, and they will naturally fight for it to the last man. 15. 1 he inhabitants of Auja, though Hurnedi by origin, have for two generations been merged in the Jurabi, and the claim to consider their lands as part of Humedi territory is too ridiculous to be seriously considered. The claim synchronizes with the completion of the tower in 1902, and consequently constitutes a violation of the Trade on ewhich delimitation is based. We have told tne lurks that if their claim is pressed we should be obliged to revive the claim to the old tribal border of the Subaihi and Athwari at Humira Makhsuj, and that we cannot leave before some solution of the tower difficulty is found. They have agreed, subject to sanction from head-quarters, to destroy it and indemnify the owner. It is the only possible way of avoiding intertribal fighting and bloodshed after the departure of the Commission. The tower would appear to have been built with the secret conni vance and assistance of the Mufalis Customs officials, who would, no doubt, put a post in it il it were acknowledged as Turkish. This audacious attempt seems to have been frustrated by the action of the Jurabi Subaihi, who made such a determined fight over it that the Turkish Customs and the Athwari were finally obliged to join them with a view to reopening the trade route, the traffic of which is of vital importance to the Customs revenue. 16. The recent attitude of the Turks, coupled with their alleged inability to have the border survey carried out on their side of the line, may force us, as soon as we can leave this neighbourhood, to proceed with our work without them. The cool season is already past, and we cannot take the responsibility of unnecessarily keeping our escort, &amp;c., in these regions longer than can be helped. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) JL. A.

(February 21 to March 14, 1904, inclusive.) February 21.—Interviewed the guardian of the Sanawi shrine, who gave evidence as to his border with the Turkish tribe of Hiunedi, on the west of the Jurabi bolder, and between them and the Zuraiki. He also declared that the tower (referred to in Diaiy entry of the 14th February), built by a Humedi at Auja in the W. Ma’din, and_ conse quently far from the Humedi border, was inside Jurabi territory, the boidei of which \sas formerly well up the IVadi Ma’din, and near the Mufalis custom-house. This was confirmed by the Kadi and other Sheikhs whose evidence was taken on the subject. February 22.—Surveyor Lai Singh returned from the Kubati hills, having com pleted the survey there. Sub-Surveyor Ahmad Husen worked to the west of Mufalis. Colonel Wahab ‘and Mr. Fitzmaurice visited Turks, and went into the question of the frontier at Auja. The tower built there had previously been claimed as lurkish on the ground of the place belonging to the Turkish tribe of Humedi. On the Jurabi Sheikh s evidence, that while a Humedi family possessed land there the place itself was inside the Subaihi boundary, the Turks produced the Athwari Sheikh, who claimed the place as his. It was evident from his manner that he had been prompted to make this ridiculous statement on the spot, being some 3 miles from the Humedi border, could not be claimed as Humedi. The Jurabi Sheikh showed that the Athwari border was immediately south of Mufalis, i.e., about 2 miles north of Auja, so that the Athwari Sheikh’s claim to the spot seemed also untenable. Produced for the inspection of the Turkish Commissioners a document bearing the seal of the Turkish Kaimakam of the district, and dated 1290 a.h. or 1874 a.d., declaring that Karayiha, a village immediately south of Mufalis, was Subaihi, and that the Athwari had no right to interfere with it. As locally there was very great ill-feeling between the Humedi and Subaihi about the tower at Auja, it was decided to postpone the discussion until the surveyor had completed his work in the Humedi country. February 23.—Sub-Surveyor worked in the country of the Salihi to the west of Mufalis, and lying between the territory of the Athwari and Humedi. February 24. — Surveyor Lai Singh sketched on a scale of joooo the ground in dispute between Sanawi and Mufalis. Ali Ba Salih Haneshi and Hanesh Bin Ahmad gave evidence as to their border between the Turks and the Subaihi in Wadi Shah. They declared that the Jewazi were from time immemorial raiya, or subjects of the Jurabi Sheikh Said Muhammad-bin- Yakub, to whom they still pay; that when the Turks under their Commander, Suleman Nuri, first advanced (some twenty-five years ago) down this way Sheikh Daghim, the head Subaihi Sheikh, notified this to him, and that he accepted it; that subsequently the Turkish Commander, Ahmad Asim, visited these parts and forced the Jewazi to pay taxes; that since then, on the collection of revenue by the Turks, which happened once in six to ten years (the last occasion being some seven years ago) the Jewazi paid to them under compulsion, but they had continuously paid, and still pay, to the Jurabi Sheikh.1 ■1 Shab, while the Shajefi number some sixty men in W. Shab, and some seventy in W. Yumit and around Mufalis. J Sheikh Abdul Kowi of Shab visited the Commission, and stated that the upper two- thirds of the W. Shab belonged to him and other Syeds, the lower third belonging to the Jurabi^ (Subaihi) and Shajefi in equal proportion, the latter being Turkish; that the Shajefi did not oiiginally live in the TV\ Shab but bought fields there, and subsequent!v ^ their Sheikh Naman and toliowers came and lived there; that when the Lahej Sultan —BFadthl-bin-Ali occupied the Subaihi country in 1881 to 1885, Shab was within his limits, though the Abdali Sultan exempted its inhabitants, owing to their sacred character, from taxation ; that his (Sheikh Abdul Kowi’s) father, Muhammad Nasir, had acted as the Lahej Sultan s agent; that the Lahej Sultan had fought the Shajefi and occupied their country in Aumit; that when some time after the withdrawal of the Abdali Sultan from the Subaihi country, some Turkish Arabs (Absi) had, at the instigation and with the moral aid of Muhammad Nasir Mukbil, of Ad-Dareja notoriety, wished to establish a customs post in Shab, when the Lahej Sultan wrote to them forbidding their doing so, whereupon they established the post above Shab at Nobat Doka, and exacted dues in a most arbitrary fashion ; that when, some seven years ago, a certain Rifat Bey, with a 1 urkish force, penetrated into the Yusufiyin and Kubati country to collect taxes, and the Turkish Commander was about to visit Shab, he (Sheikh Abdul Kowi) visited him with a letter from the Lahej Sultan Fadthl-bin-Ali (who died shortly afterwards), and made him desist from his intention, and that no Turkish force had ever visited the Wadi Shab. Sheikh Abdul Kowi declared that he and his people wished, now that the boundary of the two Governments w ? as to be delimited, that they and their countrv in Wadi Shab should be included in the Subaihi, or British sphere, according to their status, during the regime of the Lahej Sultan from 1876 to 1886, more especially as his ancestors were Kadis to the Subaihi. He produced documents, signed by the Imams and going back over 200 years, declaring that Shab was not included in Rakabi, Le., the district name of the country of the Absi, Kubatu, and Yusufiyin now acknowdedging Turkish rule, also a document stating that it was Subaihi. He further stated that the majority of the inhabitants, who included some Mansuri and Dubeni Subaihis, were connected and had their dealings with the Subaihi, February 25.—Sub-Surveyor still at work in the Salihi country to east of A1 Kala’. February 26.—Received documents from the Sultan of Lahej, some of which had a bearing on the boundary of the Subaihi country as controlled by his predecessor. February 27.—Mohammedan festival of the Td (Turkish Bairam). Interrogated several Subaihi Sheikhs, whose evidence agreed as to the tribal border being close to Mufalis, and as to the Subaihi border, even now after the Turks had usurped territory down to Mola, being above Auja, where the tower (mentioned in Diary, 14th February) had been built; in fact, though the lands on both sides of the Wadi above Auja, were not Subaihi, the Subaihi tribal border was above the source of the spring, wdiich changed from year to year, at Humira Makhsuj (a large tamarind tree on the left bank of the Wadi, just under Husn Mufalis) and below Lakmat Mu’Aibira on the right bank. This was the tribal boundary between the Subaihi and Athwari from time immemorial, the spot where representatives of both tribes met to discuss tribal affairs, and the source of the spring, called the Ghail Mola’, upon which almost all the cultivation in the Jurabi country depended (though the actual spot where it welled out of the bed of the Wadi varied), was always between Auja and Humira Makhsuj, up to which latter place the Jurabis had a right to follow it. February 28.—Turks informed us that the work of our Surveyor on their side of the boundary had had to be postponed till after the festival of the ’Id (Bairam). February 29.—Surveyor on Turkish side still got four days 5 work. March 1.—Went into the question of the Shajefi, Jazi’i, &amp;c. Koraiha subjects of the Subaihi living in Wadis Yumit, Thabab, and Razuk. March 2.—Surveyor Ahmad Husen, with Turkish escort, went to Humedi country. March 3.—News received that Captain Warneford, Political Officer, had been shot by an Arab sowar at Amrija’, and was in a critical condition. Sent dhoolie to Dar-al- Kudaimi in case he could be removed. Turkish Commissioners called to discuss boundary with Humedi. March 4.—News received that Captain Warneford had died the previous night at 9 p.m. A gathering of Arabs stopped the survey on Turkish side in the Humedi country. March 5. —Sent Surveyor out under joint escort to complete work to west of Wadi Ma’din. [1861/—Ij D r 'SBfr8 Turkish Commissioners came to check and sign final maps of border from the Bana to Ras Namis in Haushabi territory. The Mansuri Sheikh gave evidence before the Turks as to the border between his people and the Kubati. Agreed to take him out to-morrow and confront him with the Kubati Sheikh on the ground. Received information that the Shajefi (subdivision of the Mansuri Subaihi) in Wadi Tokar and Wadi Sahr had been tampered with by Turkish Agents, who endeavoured to induce them to say they were Turkish and under the Kubati Sheikh. # March 6.—Met the Turkish Commissioners at 6 a.m. in the Wadi Shab. 1 hey came with a large gathering of Kubati Arab and a Shajefi Customs employ^. Proceeded by Nijd Mikrad-Nijd Ghorabi to Nabwa, Sihr. The akils of the Zedm, a Subaihi section, with whose ancestors one of the original Subaihi Treaties had been in 1839, and who had visited the Commission at Am Farsha on the 12th February {vide Diary entry of that date) to give information as to their border, declared, evidently as a result of Turkish intrigue, that there was no border between them and the Turkish Arabs of Kubati and Aid Shab. Informed the Turks that we must then delimit on the basis of the southern boundary of the Zedin or on the basis of the northern boundary 7 of the Aid Snab. The Shajefi, who had come with the Turks, declared, evidently on Turkish inspiration, and protested loudly, that the Shajefi country extended from Mufalis to Am Masharij (in Mansuri country) all of which was consequently Turkish. The Mansuii Sheikh declared his acceptance of the first statement which, he said, implied that the British boundary was at Mufalis, as the Shajefi were a sub-section of the Mansuri. Informed Turks that further discussion was useless, and that we should be obliged to put forward all the official British claims which included the A hi Shab. This evidently had some effect on the Turks, who had some private conversation with the Kubati Sheikh. On arrival at Nijd Mutarid, be changed his manner and admitted that the Shajefi in Wadi Tukar were Mansuri, and that his boundary ran from Nijd Baru to Ras Tukar, thence to Nijd Husen, and thence to Nijd Mutarid. Discussion as to Shajefi in Wadi Sihr was postponed as the day 7 w 7 as far advanced. It was clear tlrat the Turkish Assistant Commissioner, Zia EfFendi {vide Commission’s No. 337 of the 20th October, 1903), was at the bottom of the extraordinary attitude of the natives. Juledi akils came in on invitation and agreed to survey of their country, the carrying out of which they had previously prevented, March 7.—Mr. Fitzmaurice proceeded with Surveyor, a supporting force being stationed in the W. Ma’din, south-east of the Juledi, Ma’mai village. The survey was all but completed when some of the tribesmen showed a disposition to give trouble. The supporting force was moved up, upon which the survey was completed without incident. Party which had left in the early morning did not return till after dark. March 8.—Turkish Commissioner came with Zia Effendi to visit and examine into the section of the border between the Humedi and Jurabi. Colonel Wahab and Captain Redl accompanied them, but it was soon apparent from the extraordinary- behaviour of the Turkish Arabs that no solution was likely. Colonel Wahab and party returned, the Turks remaining in the Humedi country, professedly to induce their Arabs to adopt a more reasonable attitude. They subsequently returned, bringing a Syed who lived in the Humedi country. His evidence rather went to confirm the contentions of the Jurabi. Turks then proposed to bring the Humedi head Sheikh, accompanied only by the Syed, to confront one Jurabi Sheikh and the keeper of the shrine of Sanawi, and to take the statements of both after swearing them on the Koran. v ' ‘ • The evidence of the Humedi and other Arabs pointed to the irreconcilable attitude of the Humedi Sheikh being the secret w r ork of Zia Effendi. March 9 .—Turks did not come with the Humedi Sheikh as arranged. Sheikh Abdul Kowq of the Ahl Shab, came to inquire if we had agreed to Shab being within Turkish limits. Replied that nothing had yet been settled between us and the Turks. He asked leave to endeavour to settle the dispute and blood feud over the water at the supporting column camp. Told him we should be delighted if he succeeded in making peace in a matter which had so divided the Jurabi section involved. March 10.—Sheikh A bdul Kowi failed to make a settlement between the disputants, who showed signs of reopening the quarrel. Sent for them and made them give hostages to insure their keeping the peace during our stay in their neighbourhood. The cause°of the fresh quarrel being that one side had used the water for irrigating their fields, while forcibly preventing their rivals from using it according to the custom°of the country, as jointly agteed upon between them. Captain Redl, with party, went to make the offenders keep to their agreement. March 11.—Report that the Humedi were intriguing with bad characters among the Subaihi with a view to making a hostile demonstration against the British camp at night;9 and^tTerSheikhs \vhn 1 W ° U i u' y C ° nSent to co m&lt;=if confronted with Atawi ii Wrote tellin^ them that thp ^ tif n ia ^ ^ &gt; connec ti°n with, the Humedi border.

Both Commissions with Shedths from each side, vis,ted the Wadi Ma’bak, when after a couple of hours’ discussion some appicmch to the truth was elicited along some 2 miles of the frontier. March 13.—Met the Turkish Commissioners at Misbanaby appointment. The Salihi Sheikhs who accompanied them apparently had been taught to make vague and sweeping tteTiM, ° the H ter T t0 t ry 0f th ,?

Au j a to interrogate the inhabitants of both places, when the Sheikh of the Humedi, whom the Turks had undertaken not to introduce into the discussion suddenly appeared on the scene with over 60 armed followers. Turks professed to be unable to explain their arrival, but there seemed good reason to suppose that it was by their secret orders. Their Sheikh, when asked how he claimed Auja, which was cut off irom the regular Humedi district, relused to answer. This being the result of some weeks’ patient mci u| r y _ and forbearance on our part, informed Turks that we would not be justified in wasting more time in bootless inquiry, and thjt we felt forced to officially exc ange and refer home the just Subaihi claims, although we had been prepared to sacrifice some of them in order to come to a settlement on the spot. We reminded them wVv/ju r 1 n0t ’ after a forfcni g ht ’ s .delay, taken steps to advance the survey in the adi Ma bak, and that we must explain these situations to our Government. Agreed to meet to-morrow to exchange views on the whole subject. • Mdi'Gh 14. At meeting with the Turkish Commissioners, latter professed their inability to advance the survey in the Humedi or Zuraiki country. They declared they had, as we had arranged with them, telegraphed for permission to destroy the tower at . uja. After hours of discussion, their attitude as to the preposterous claims of the Kubati^ and Humedi Sheikhs was so unreasonable that we felt obliged to putin all the oubaihi claims, as set forth in the Residency Memorandum of the Subaihi, forwarded to ^ Government of India in Iso. 13 A of the 14th January last, and stating that the Ahi Shah in the Wadi Shab and the Humedi were British. This made the Turks adopt a more reasonable^ attitude, and they promised to telegraph for instructions to enable f C nr se tt\ e w ith us a basis approximating the status of 1901. The recent behaviour of Zia Effendi left small hope of their telegraphing in a way to elicit precise instructions. (Signed) R. A. WAHAB, Colonel, Commissioner, Aden Boundary Commission.

Evidences are so strong that the Turks have of late been acting in bad faith that I would suggest that instructions should be sent to me to deal with the Auja difficulty by myself. It should not be made the subject even of discussion with the Turks, as there is no doubt that the place is Jurabi. Further work in conjunction with the Turks is almost impossible in view of their professed inability to carry out the Humedi country survey. It might even be advisable for us to lay claim to the Humedi, who are enumerated in the Resident's Subaihi Memorandum, dated the \&amp;th January, among the Dubeni Section. Their territory comprises some 15 square miles, and contains only some seven villages situated in the Mabak VRley, through which passes the trade to Aden from Makatara. A much better frontier would be secured by the inclusion of this territory. I should be glad to receive instructions on both points as soon as possible. “ With reference to the Resident's telegram of the 23rd March, the detention of No. 6 Mountain Battery is not due to the delimitation. See my telegrams No. 350, dated the \0th December, and No. 353, dated the 2Hh December last. I made a further suggestion to the Resident on the 25th January that the troops at Musemir should be withdrawn ; and their continued presence there after the \0th February has had no connection with the delimitation.

In the last instalment of the Boundary Commission diary the following entry has been made under date 11th February. “ Jurahi Akils wrote to the Resident to say they were alarmed by the approach of British columns; that they had been given to understand by the Resident that the intentions of Government were peaceful, and that, if so, there was no occasion for large forces approaching their country 2. I attach a copy of the only letter received from the Jurabis. It must have been written about a week before the above-quoted entry was made in the diary of the Commission, and does not betray any special uneasiness. However, the object of moving troops on both sides of the northern Suhaihi country was to create the impression that, if the tribes molested the Commis sion, they would be attacked and punished, as we had lately punished the Kotaibis. To this extent the intention of the movements was undoubtedly to create apprehension, and the plan adopted has up to the present time been almost perfectly successful. 3. The Jurabi are a well behaved section, and had little cause for alarm on their own account, nor did I hear, in my recent visit to that part of the border, that they actually felt any. As regards the approach of columns to their country, the force now supporting the Boundary Commission and its escort was sent by me to Dar-al-Kudaimi. It was afterwards moved, at Colonel Wahab’s request, to Kuhlan, or Ghail Madin, close to the Jurabis. A copy of Colonel WahaVs letter to the Officer Commanding the Column, dated 15th February, is enclosed. This move was doubtless judicious, as though the Jurabis are well behaved, other sections are not. But, in these circumstances, I do not know why the Commission should have reported, through their diary, the alleged letter from the Jurabis, and it has appeared to me that a statement of the facts would not be out of place. (No date.) From— Sheikh Said Muhammad Yakub and all the Akils of the Jurabis, To—The Political Resident at Aden. After compliments .—Your letter has been received, and we have understood what is said in it regarding the boundary. And the border is quiet, and there is no trouble on it: as for me, I understand the boundary which Government is defining, and if any trouble begins on it, will let you know, and, indeed, our strength is from your strength, and its (the border’s) security requires nothing (no special measures ?). This letter was received in Aden on 5th February, so it was probably written about the 2nd. It is even more enigmatical than Arab letters usually are, but it is taken to mean that the object of the Commission was understood; and that, as far as the writers know, no opposi tion would be offered. No. 15, dated Camp Wadi Madin, the 15th February 1904;. From— Colonel R. A. Wahab, C.I.E., Commissioner, Aden Boundary Commission, To—M ajor Ravenhill, the Buffs, Commanding Subaihi Column. I have the honour to inform you that the Commission and escort will move to-morrow to a camp on the Wadi Madin, near the foot of the hills, and2 to request that you will be good enough to move 300 men and two guns to the place where the Commission is at present encamped, as early as you can conveniently, leaving the remainder of the column at your present post.

The difficulty of making, in the field and without proper appliances the six copies for the six Departments of Government wirthTeh we communicate, and additional ones for our Turkish colleagues, is considerable Making arrangements for survey of such a nature as to insure the’safety of our surveyors keeping up relations with the border Arabs with view to ascertaininl the truth as to the boundary and carrying on negotiations with the Turks, account for most of our t™e.. Remaining for any length of time in one place in order to brim* our mannf„V u „ date is incompatible with our endeavour to finish the south-western dehmitation to the sea m wha .remains of a cool season, and to shorten the stay of our escort and the troons supporting the Commission in the low-lying portions of the Subailii Tihama 2. So many sections of the Amiri boundary have already formed a subject of official cgsn? r&amp;sr* °° *~ -** *«• .. „ ! !!e eastern section of the Amiri border begins at Haid Khatm, but, strictly speakin- at Ras Nakil Adana. The villages of Habil Jalb and Kuren are tribaLshaibi b 8 v origin, but have practically thrown in their lot with the Amir As will be noticed, the section in the vicinity of Kataba has been marked out bv a laige number of masonry pillars, m accordance with the instructions in paraerauh 6 of the Government of India’s Confidential letter of the 17th June, 1903 The Dakkam portion 0 . the border is also marked by pillars up to the slopes of J. Hesha, where tollow« W tbf 0ra r el l o , U1 ' a f !;? t P res -. From J - R &gt;n&gt;a to the Haushabi border the line tollows the watershed along high points most difficult of access, and crosses the Wadis Hama and Tusan at well-marked points. 3. The line actually demarcated in the immediate vicinity of Kataba differs somewhat from that suggested in paragraph 72 of our Amiri Report of the 25th May 1903 and irom the description given in the Memorandum presented to the Porte in September In accordance with the second paragraph of the Memorandum on Ukla presented to the Porte, the lower part of W. Reshan was left to the Turks, the line being taken to J. Jarrad and Habil Ztreh, thus securing to the Amir the Well of Zireh, which contains the best drinking-water in or near Kataba. 4. Our Diary entries of the 4th, 6th, and 10th October referred to some patches of culUvation in the upper reaches of Selat Hafasa in dispute between the people of Dakkarn and Dasha, and as our boundary is a tribal one, which Government wishes should be as tree as possible from sources of dispute, we thought best to endeavour to include within Dakkam limits some 8 square miles of territory beyond the green line on Man f! attached to our Report of the 25th May, 1903. ^ * The Turkish Commissioners, having received an Irade to delimit “to a point 1 kdom. west of the Tiban and due south of Hefa,” at first felt bound, without a fresh reference to Constantinople, to decline leaving the 8 square miles in question to the Dakkam, the point on the map 1 kilom. west of the Tiban being situated within this area. When, however, we showed a disposition not to insist on drawing the line close up to the houses of Kataba, and explained to them that boundary point No. XLIV, south of . • Tusan, was less than kilom. distant from the Tiban, they ultimately agreed to the inclusion of the 8 square miles within the Dakkam border, thus taking the frontier-line up by the head of the S. Hafasa and on to the lofty peak of J. Rirna. This constitutes a rectification, without departing from the tribal basis, of the western Dakkam border on the lines indicated in paragraph 4 of the Government of India’s letter of the 17th June, 1903. We, on our part, agreed to leave them the patch of cultivation—entirely the property of the people of Kataba—lying between Kataba, J Jarrad and Habil Badr. 5. The description of the Amiri border presented to and accepted by the Porte, with the alteration commented on in our diary of the 18tb February, 1904, makes the line [1861 M—1] ' p&gt; J4 1 ypass from Al Aslum to the junction of the Selat Humar with the Selat Kataba, and then follow the latter to the north of Lakmat-ad-Duki. Taking the line down the S. Kataba, which is a broad depression almost entirely under cultivation and contains the site of the village of Abara, close to the well of that name, would have been most unsatisfactory, while a line from Al Aslum to the junction of S. Humar with the S. Kataba would run close to the walls of the Kataba barracks. The Amir of Dthala set great value on the inclusion within his limits of the site and cultivation of Abura. We consequently gave to the Turks the cultivation in the W. Shaddad, which entirely belongs to the people of Kataba, and, by leaving them free the road out of Kataba passing close to the junction of the S. Humar with the S. Kataba, induced them to leave us the entire bed of the W. Abara down to Lakmat-ad-Duki, and to take the line well free of the northern bank from Habil Khadr to Habil Duwar, thus leaving on the Amiri side a good deal of cultivation belonging to the Yubi village of Shakhab. The Turks further agreed to include within our limits the cultivation near Kuli’a Assoufla, which was outside the line first drawn on Map C, and was claimed by both the Haiki and Dakkam. 6. I may remark that, though the line unavoidably crosses cultivation in parts, in no instance has Amiri cultivation been left on the Turkish side, while the converse has happened to no small extent. As demarcation does nst imply disturbance of private rights, a document was exchanged with the Turkish Commissioners, and copies given to the local representatives on both sides, certifying that the inhabitants on either side of the boundary would continue, as heretofore, to enjoy all private rights in matters of real property, water, grazing, and “ wakf.” This went a long way to remove the suspicions of the natives that the work of the Commission implied an interference with individual rights. 7. The villages ot Habil-as-Selami, Bir Kes, Jos-al-Jamal, and the site of Abara, as also Lakmat-ad-puki, now within the Amiri border, are Yubi; but this did not quite reconcile the Amir to the work of the Commission not having resulted in vindicating his c aims to the icmainder of the Yubi and Haiki villages. On the whole, however, he is veiy pleased with his present boundary, and is deeply grateful to Government for the restoration of his rights. ^ We took steps to introduce him to the local Turkish Representatives, with whom the mn expiessed a strong desire to maintain cordial relations, and thus, if possible, avoid any serious friction along his border.

No. 2. Colonel Wahab to Government of India.—{Communicated by India Office, March 31, 1901.) s'lu): /% Sir, Aden Boundary Commission Camp, Sanawi, March 15, 1901. THE boundary map, sent with letter A of the f5- instant, shows that portion of The Haushabi border from J. Mimtar to Has Namis. I have the honour further to inclose a blue print* on the j-inch scale showing the remainder of the Haushabi border as demarcated with the Turks. The finished map will follow as soon as it can be completed. * This was sent to the Foreign Office for reproduction, March 30, 1904. [1861 hh —1] C-t^l 6 lilt m li 8 * &gt; f 2. The Haushabi border may be divided by natural features and tribally into two sections: (1) from J. Mimtar, where the Amiri boundary ends, to Basesa, on the Amama range, thence across the Ad-Dareja Valley to Has Namis, just under Jalisa, on the spur of Jabal Jarban ; and (2) from Bas Namis across the comparatively open ground to a poirvV on the south-east slopes of J. Nabi Shaib, called J. Muharraka, where, according to it Haushabi contention, their border ends and the Subaihi border begins. 3. From J. Mimtar to Ras Namis the inhabitants on the British side are pure Haushabi, while from Ras Namis to J. Muharraka they belong to the Haushabi sub-tribe of ’Amri, who, though originally tribally distinct from the Haushabi, have for a long time back been merged in the latter, and acknowledged the jurisdiction of their Sultan, paying him the tithes and other dues. On the Turkish side of the Haushabi border are the tribe of (!) Flu mar, from J. Mimtar to the Wadi Warazan and included administratively in the canton of Kama’ira; (2) the tribe of Badu, from the Wadi Warazan to Dar Wetid and S. Lassab; (3) the tribe of Vusufiyin from S. Lassab to Nijd Barn, or the col between J. Kurra and J. Nabi Shaib; and (4) the tribe of Kubati, whose territory extends from Nijd Baru to J. Muharraka and thence along the Subaihi border to Al Ja'ama in the Wadi Sihr. 4. The actual interference of the Turks, or the tribes under their influence, along the ’Amri portion of the Haushabi border have been, relatively speaking, insignificant, and it is in the valley north of Ad-Dareja that Muhammad Nasir Mukbil, during recent years and subsequent to his appointment by Flussein Hilmi Pasha (ex-Wali of Yaman and now Chief Inspector of Reforms in European Turkey) as Mudir of the nahia, or canton, of Kama’ira, began the series of encroachments that led up to the incident of July 1901, and, in fact, to the present work of demarcation. 5. Muhammad Nasir Mukbil bad pushed the Turkish border well down into the Wadi Fakir and to the village of Ad-Dareja, while, as appears from the Commission diary of the 21st December, the territory claimed by him extended to the junction of the Wadi Ziyak and the Wadi Warazan. Certain Turkish claims at Kudash, the building ot the tower at Nijd Musamma, the fact that Turkish access to the Yusufiyin and Kubati country lay through the W adi Hawemi and Wadi Hidaba in ’Amri territory, a route which has been^ actually used by Turkish troops in the past, the evidently inspired claim to the Juhaili country and the Madraja Pass from Haushabi into Subaihi territory (vide Commission diary entries of the 2nd February and the 3rd February), combined with certain verbal statements of the natives, pointed to the existence of the intention of Muhammad Nasir Mukbil to gradually absorb the ’Amri portion of Haushabi territory comprised within a line drawn from the junction of the Wadis Ziyak and Warazan to Nairn 13 3110 ' r ° m ^ u ^ alra ^ a a ^ on g the now recognized Haushabi boundary to Ras i T he ^ nCi ^ en t thwarted this plan ; but if the Turks had been successful in a sorbmg the ’Amri country they would, no doubt, have claimed it on the ground that the Amri were distinct from the Haushabi. Undoubtedly the present Haushabi Sultan’s regime, commented on in the Commissioner’s diary of the 17th, 22nd, and 28th January, and the 1/th February 1904, was not of a nature to win the sympathy of his subjects and counteract Turkish designs, while their Agent, Muhammad Nasir Mukbil, took full advantage of such state of things. ^ us ® infcri o ue &gt; threats, and force to compel the people to accept y 1 e K , haIlfa L Abdul Hamid &gt;” and ^ secerns to have met with a certain HtVr Qhnv ■ I0 !“ , th f t f n f atl0ns of documents attached to this Report.

Though formerlv elispi ir aba vfllagerg on the south-eastern slopes ol gh f ° lmeily d0Sel . v allled t0 tb o Haushabi, they are tribally distinct from7 the latter, and seem to have^ been originally related to the Hu mar, under Turkish juristic ion. Their inclusion within the British sphere would have given a more natural boun ary than that demarcated by the Commission, and it was with a view to such a contingency that in paragraph 68 of the Amiri Report, of the 25th May, 1903, ' was suggested keeping open the Amir’s claims to Humar, as “it is to be foreseen that any minor rectifications^ of that (Haushabi) border which may be found necessary at the moment of actual de.imitation there, would be rendered impossible if the Amiri rights to Humar are now definitely ceded to Turkey.” nf T i h!S f sll £gest!on did not at the time recommend itself to the consideration of Govern- ent but should the Turkish Government create obstacles to the final rectification of ^boundaiy as dehmnted by the Commission, or renew their obstructive methods by the Subaihi borde G specially in the neighbourhood of .. c ,• U1 .G 13 1 a J es ^y s Govemment may deem it expedient, in the final settlement of ! ° ntler ’ ° den ?f nd rectification of this portion of the Haushabi border and make the hne run along the natural feature of the Amama-Jarban range. TU ‘ Gur negotiations with the Turkish Commissioners respecting the border between asesa and Ras IN'amis and the settlement made with them on the spot, were governed by t^o consmeratmns, viz the express wish of Government that “delimitation to the sea should be completed this cold weather,” thus rendering any but minor references to onsan mope impossible, and secondly, that the basis of the present demarcation, as %! t le f U J, klS 1 a . nd .T eed t0 b y 0lu&gt; Government, was the status of the autumn i lbou / 1 h tbl ® was departed from in the cases of Jalela, the recognition of i afa-as-Soufal as British, and the Irade of the 13th February, 1903, authorizing the demarcation of a border from LakamaGash-Shub to the desert, it was reaffirmed bv the ^e.uocn in ns et ei ot tne 30th May, 1903. In the absence of any specific instructions from Government on the subject, we consequently felt bouud to adhere to the principle as tar as possible, and avoid any claims involving serious deviation from it, 9. The case of Shabwa was to a certain extent an exception. This shrine, with i;s Jands containing the only abundant supply of water south of J. Amama, has for several years back been xooked upon as Turkish. The claims of the Haushabi Sultan, commu- njcated to the Commission in the Residency’s letter of the 23rd September, 1902, including Snaowa, while stating that L)aba and Hanba were Turkish. * The levivafby the local authorities oi the old claims to Ad-Dareja was most embarras sing to the lurkish Commissioners, who could not, however, officially surrender them without ipfeienee to Constantinople, while it seemed that the Sublime Porte would also be con siderably embarrassed by claims that had led to fighting between British and Turkish tioops. We consequently claimed Shabwa, and thus compelled the Turks to include it in theii icfeience, with the result, as anticipated, that the Turkish Government hurriedly instructed their Commissioners not to press the claims to Ad-Dareja, be. It then became a question of delimiting the boundary between the lands of Shabwa and the Wajihi, i.e., from Ras^ Aseka to Maharib, and north of Aresma to Tawal and W^akadiya, including on the British side the perennial streams in W. Mileh and the Karkahan nullah. j 0. I he Haushabi Sultan having stated that Daba was Turkish, it became our duty to demarcate on the basis of its just limits. Like Shabvva it is a shrine with “ wakf lands, situated in the W adi Ziyak. r l he Turkish claim, as set forth in our diary entry of tne 21st December, 1903, extended dowu to the Wadi Warazan, but, on making inquiries, we found that a great portion of these lands really belonged to the Syeds of Dthubiyafc, in Amiri territory. W r e sent for the latter, and demarcated on the basis of their limits, as detailed in their documents, drawing the boundary-line of Asaf Am Shari, where the Wadi Jihal (belonging to Daba) becomes the Wadi Zivak, thus again leaving in British territory the perennial stream in the bed of the Wadi below Jihal. ' It seemed necessary to go into these details to explain the reason of the sharp re-entry of the frontier-line between Wakadiya and Ras Namis, while the Haushabi Sultan has shown a certain dissatisfaction with the settlement of the section of his boundary between Basesa and Ras Namis. In spite of his stutements to the Residency, recorded in its letter of the 23rd September, 1902, to the Commission, he evidently expected to get the crest or the Amama-Jarban range as his boundary, and seemed to think that Government had done less for him than for the Amir of Dthali. 11. As a matter of fact, the demarcation of this portion of his border, though it does not give a natural boundary (vide paragraph 5) is more satisfactory than couldliave been expected. The Intelligence Officer attached to the Field Force in July 1901, together with the Political Officer, went into the question of the boundary above Kafuf4 J and Ad-Dareja. The results of this investigation are given on his sketch map of the vicinity of Ad-Dareja, upon which the frontier is shown as crossing the crest of a hill about 1 000 yards west of the tower built by Muhammad Nasir Mukbil, and some 2 miles south of Shabwa, the latter being marked “ Turkish.” The letter in question furth^* states:— “ Opinions even among the Haushabi themselves differ as to whether a boundarv-line runs along the high crest line of this hill, or, lower down, about 800 yards further north along the line of she Karkahan nullah. Arguing from previous grounds it would seem that the line does run along the high crest, and if this is the case, the advantage lies wholly with the Humar and Turks, who from this high vantaee ground wholly command all the approaches from Ad-Dareja and the line of the W. Ziyak; having good sloping ground in their own rear to hide their own dispositions. If,' on the other hand the boundary be pushed down to the other side of the hill, without interfering in anv’way with the fields at the foot (which appear without diapute to belong to the° Humar) the advantage would rest entirely with the Haushabi (or British) force, who would command the whole valley and approaches from Mavia, having in their own immediate front an almost perfect glacis-like slope As a matter of fact the Humar at present own this crest line, &amp;e.) r The boundary-line now drawn by Masjid Arabi more than redresses the tactical dis advantage commented on in this Report of the Intelligence Officer. 12. The Haushabi boundary from Ras Namis' to Niid Musamma is quite satis- aaon, no ground that the Amn claim having been left on the Turkish side. ‘‘Turk^X’ V ’1 ageS °K- | Ta fu aD m K ? d ?

No. 17, dated the mh March, jtom Colonel JVahub, for transmission : — “The attitude of the Turkish Arabs, in consequence of the Turks beina unable or unwilling to control them, has during the last three weeks been such as to make a settlement of the rival claims in respect of the section of the boundary lying between Hawemi and the Zuraiki border impracticable An impossible claim to the land and tower of Auja, situated within the Jurabi border and separated from the Humedi border by three miles of Jurabi territory is being most violently asserted by the Sheikh and followers TurJcish tribe of TLumedi. See Commission Diary, dated the llth February last, where the matter is dealt with. Serious trouble between the border tribes will be caused by this tower after the Commission has withdrawn, unless a British and Turkish force is left here to maintain order pending a final settlement. But the heat of the weather will prevent a force being kept here for any length of time ; the best way, therefore, of settling the matter is to destroy the Auja tower and pay indemnity to the proprietor. , M? r ^l sh Gom7il ™8ioner8 state that they have, in a telegram dated the 11th March, requested sanction to adopt this course. “ 1 would urgently request that instructions should at once be sent to them to co-operate with us in this solution. The cool season is already past, and the progress of the delimitation is being delayed by this matter. For two months before we arrived the Turkish Customs official at Mafalis had felt obliged, m consequence of the stoppage of trade, to co-operate with the Jurabi ' in fighting the Rumedi over the tower. The erection of the tower, which was completed in 1902j is a violation of the status existing in the autumn of 1^01; and its destruction will probably lead to the whole of the Subaihi border to Wadiadim being settled on the spot, and the necessity of referring home the extensive Subaihi claims antecedent to the status o/1901 will thus be avoided. Only an area of two square kilometres is involved in the settlement which we propose of the Auja^ difficulty. I would further request that instructions may be sent to the Turks to admit the Juhaili claim; see my letter of the Qth February, No. 12. There is strong evidence that the present state of affairs is due to Zia Ffifendi* and his removal is the only guarantee for the conclusion of the delimitation to the sea.

If, however, nothing of that kind occurs, the Governor in Council is of opinion that, as soon as the delimitation of the Subaihi country is completed, arrange ments should be made to send a sufficiently strong party in charge of Mr. Bury along the same route up to complete the work in the north-east, and, as suggested in paragraph of General Maitland’s letter above quoted, punish the A -udali^ and Saidi tribes.

P. —Aden delimitation. In view of the failure of Mr. Bury s attempt to effect survey to the north-east, and of the favourable progress which is being made with the demarcation of the Subaihi border, the question has now to be considered whether any, and, if so, what, further steps are required in order that the practical delimitation of the frontier of our protectorate may be completed up to the desert. I gather from your letter of the 2&gt;0th December last that, in your opinion, it might suffice to draw a line along the Yaffai-Beda-Behanal Rasab border. Blease report whether you remain of this opinion, or whether you regard a survey as necessary. In the latter case, would you recommend that immediate arrangements should be made for survey from the Shaibi country as far as Beda, or whatever point may be considered necessary; or that a party should be sent up yia Shukra and Nisab in the autumn ? On these points Government will be glad to be furnished at an early date with your opinion and that of the Commissioners. The question will probably have been under your consideration in connection with the general report which you are preparing. Your views as to the possibility of reducing the cost of the Commission are also requested. All that is now wanted could, perhaps, be done by Captain Tandy and Mr. FitzMaurice, with Captain TVarneford's assistance.

The Fadthli Sultan received the party with all due attention and respect, and he sent his brother Othman bin Husen with an escort of about 25 Fadthli tribesmen to accompany Mr. Bury from his town of Shugra on the coast to Loder. The road from Shugra ascends the coast range and descends gently through hills to the Wadi Nahain about 30 miles from the coast. Beyond Nahain is the plain of Mishal, soon after which the Fadthli’s boundary is crossed. To the north is Loder, something over 20 miles from the Wadi iSahain. To the north-east is the district known as Pathina. The hio-h rano-e of the Kaur-al-Audillah runs from the west behind Loder, and continuing in a north-easterly direction divides Dathina from the country of the Tipper Aulaki Sultan, Saleh bin Abdulla. A part of the people of *Dathina are his subjects but the tribesmen of the clans in the district are independent. The Fadthli chief has influence with some of them. Loder is a market town*and is the ordinary residence of the Audillah Sultan. His people inhabit the Audillah range, thus interposing between the Upper Aulaki and Dathina, 3. Mr. Bury was aware that some of the tribe of Dathina, particularly the Hasani and the Saidi, were opposed to the passage of his party and he there^ mre took the road by Loder. The Sultan of this place has every reason to be friendly to the British Government and nothing to gain by hostility. He is or was, ambitious of obtaining a treaty and stipend, but being a person of comparatively little consequence, his advances have only been met with non- commital, though civil, replies, 4. The Saidi, who were the actual perpetrators of the attack on Mr. Burv’s camp, will be found described on page 7 of his report of 1900. It appears that Report on journeys to Ausab and Behan in the Sheikh had conceived an idea that Western Hadramaut, compiled for the Intelligence there was an extraordinary amount nf Branch.— C. W. Buby, 1900. , j a i j. • i • ^ ^4- plunder to be obtained in the British Camp, and knowing that many of his men would not approve of an attack on a party properly vouched for, and escorted by, the Fadthli Sultan, he got up the cry that the country had been sold by the Aulaki to the British. His plan was to endeavour to enter the Camp on pretence of a ceremonial visit, and to attack when Mr. Bury and his escort were off their guard. It is practically certain that a number of the Saidi who came on with their Sheikh had no idea when starting that an^ attack was to be made, and so great is the odium attaching to the Sheikh’s behaviour that he has been deposed as a leader by his own men. It is probable also that the Saidi will be made to suffer by the neighbouring clans who are under the Fadthli Sultan, or subject to his influence, for their breach of tribal good faith ; and it is not impossible that the Saidi will also he punished by the Upper Aulaki Sultan for interfering with a mission on its way to him. ° 5. All this, however, will not make up for the failure to carry out the survey of the north-eastern part of the frontier, which I very greatly regret With respect to the treaty, we are now informed that the Upper Aulaki Sultan will make one of his periodical visits to Dathina in about a month’s time and Mr. Bury can meet him there more easily than at Nisab. It is by no means certain, however, that influences inimical to the British Government may not be at work in the meantime behind the scenes, and it is certainly unfortunate that the Aulaki and Beda treaties were not made two years ago, before these influences had acquired much power. 6. As regards the survey, it would still be possible to get a party to Behan by the assistance of Sultan Saleh bin Abdulla, if they were sent with Mr. Bury to Dathina when the Sultan comes down. But I do not advocate this, as the fact of the party having been stopped by the Saidi would be an encouragementto any ill-disposed people on the outskirts of Behan and Beda to attempt the same again, and it is doubtful if the business could at present be successfully carried through. The proper course, haying regard to the importance which attaches to the survey, and one which I would recommend, on political grounds is to punish the Saidi and the Multan of Loder for their misbehaviour by a small expedition. The AM Saidi country is fairly open, and their Chiefs resi dence, Hasn es Sueda, also the Audillah Sultan’s house at Coder, could be de- stroyed without much difficulty, these places being hardly more than £0 miles from the coast at Shugra. Such punishment would be regarded by the wCole of the surrounding tribes as just and proper retribution for the entirely unpro voked attack of the Saidi and the death of the Sub-Surveyor. In ‘fact the tribes expect that we shall take this step, and our influence in the country will suffer if an outrage so near the coast is passed over. If punishment be inflicted on the Saidi, however, the Dathina tribes are not likely to give any more trouble; and, what is more important, those further off, in the region throuMi which the survey party must work, will be much less likely to display opposition. r ^ 7. Unfortunately the necessity for keeping all the troops at Aden in hand to overawe the Subaihis, while the Boundary Commission is demarcatino- their frontiei, prevents any force being sent to Shugra at the present time In my opinion, however, an expedition should be sent to the Saidi country and Codec in the autumn, and a survey party should be sent at the same time. 8. This party, however, or any survey party sent into the Aden hinterland under similar conditions, that is to say, when wmrk is to be carried on without the protection of troops, should be quite differently organized from that which accompanied Mr. Bury, and is now returning to India. I would venture to remark that I was in no way consulted as to the formation of the party. I asked for, and expected, an officer, and was much surprised when Mr. Claudius, who is a stout and elderly Eurasian, appeared in Aden. I believe Mr. Claudius has done excellent work in the past, but there is no doubt that he is now quite unfitted for employment in any uncivilized country. He showed that he was not only wanting in ordinary nerve and self-control, but appears to have had no power over his khalassis. Twenty-five of those men were sent, whereas six or eight would have been amply sufficient. I personally explained to Mr. Claudius the sort of work be would have to undertake, and be did not demur! I also suggested that he should leave one Sub-Surveyor and half the khalassis in Aden. Finally, eight men remained behind, but the reduced party was still twice rs numerous as it need have been. I believe that had a British officer been in charge of the party, the opposition shown by the Saidi would have only been a temporary check, and Mr. Bury would have been able to proceed after some delay. In the actual circumstances of the case, however, I think Mr. Bury did well to return. 9. The shot which killed the Sub-Surveyor must have been fired from a distance of 1,200 yards : it was a most unfortunate fatality, and his death is greatly to be deplored; but I do not think it need have caused the demorali zation of the entire survey party. Report from Mr. G. W. Bury, to the Resident, Aden, dated from Wadi Nakain, the 10th January 1904; despatched at 8-30 p.m., by runner to Shukra and thence hy sea to Aden. Received at Aden at 9 p.m., the 12th January 1904. I regret to report to you the death of Sub-Surveyor Abdul Jalil and the frustration of onr mission under the following circumstances :— On January the 6th the mission left Shukra as detailed, halting for the night just north of Bahwat al Makanah. We proceeded next day to Wadi Nahain, having with us Othman, brother of the Eadtbli, and an adequate local escort. the heads made no At this camp I received on January the 7th a letter signed of the AM ITasani, refusing us passage through their borders. reply beyond having it conveyed to the messenger that those who refused the 3500 E. D6 representative of the Resident could hardly hope to be received in their turn when they came to Aden (it was put stronger than that and created a marked impression). The Radthli had given letters one to Abdarab of the Divan (a small clan of independent Shekhs who acknowledge the Audali Sultan) and the other to that Sultan himself asking that myself and party might be received. Marching from Nahain on the morning of January 8th we reached Al Jauf, the home of the Abdarab clan, early in the afternoon. Al Jauf is a small stone tower with a high walled enclosure. I had sent on by my orderly O the letters of introduction and we were well received. I knew the Nahain of Dathina, the Hasani and the Saidi were opposed to our expedition, so asked Mr. Kensington to take every military precaution, which he did, throwing up shelter trenches with baggage on top, with flank defence and the tower on our rear. Quarters in these trenches were allotted to all Government and private animals were to receive shelter in the compound in case of alarm. The tower was manned by Othman and his retinue and the family of Abdarah. I formed outlying pickets of all available local men and my own Arab Asakir with the camel lines guarded by the, drivers 100 yards from our left flank and in echelon with our position and the tower. I got a letter from my orderly from Loder which town we could plainly see about 5 miles away to the east and north-east. He stated that the Audali Sultan was away from Loder and in his absence his nephew declined to act hut enjoined us to remain where we were until the Sultan communicated his decision. ^ I -wrote back at once pointing out the hazardous nature of our present position and requested that an escort might be sent to convey us to Loder next morning and all questions could be gone into there. 1 added that the Audali Government would be morally responsible for any mishap that might occur and told my orderly to read my letter to the nephew which he did. Visiting rounds all through the night. Next morning I received and renewed acquaintance with the chief Mansab of Dathina, who said there was no sio-n of disturbance in our neighbourhood. I differed with him, however, for in addi tion to the information I had, I heard rallying cries faintly in the distance owar s the south-east at intervals and felt there was unusual excitement in the air. At noon the Chiefs of Diyan came in with a retinue of 15 men sinking a ceremon ml chant which greeted Othman but expressed dissatisfaction at him bringing “ calamity ” upon them. comin^r.^^ir 1116 a , n / re P orted that the Diyan Chiefs disapproved of our coming and asked if I would see them. aS Chiefs recognised me which took them some time said th^ 7 t d tfp 0 T •^ alUeelmg ^ bostilit y towards myself or my party, but them that tVm tt ai 1 a ^censed owing to a report prevalent among T showed the ^PP er Sultan had sold them to the British “ like cattle.” exnreqsinn e ab ® u f5 il ty °t this and the audience broke up with every and Diace thef 00 ^ 111, ^ Chiefs accepting my invitation to stop the night ordeHv arrived f n ? f ° Ur . dis P° sal for P icket d *ty.

I told 0thman to send out word at once that I should be pleased to receive the Akhil and his, Chiefs, but had no accommodation for so large an escort. No one in camp could see what was going on, as we were in a slight de pression and the ground on our right flank was level and sparsely covered with stubble which, while affording no adequate cover to the approach of an enemy, prevented any very distant view. I heard afterwards that the Divan allowed these people to pass thinking they were on a ceremonial visit, for they advanced singing, wdien suddenly at 1,000 yards Othman saw the line open into skirmishing order and gave the call to arms to the outposts on our right flank. I ran out of my tent and told Mr. Kensington to “ stand to.” He gave the order and the sepoys manned the trenches with soldierly promptitude, while the sow r ars and sises led the animals to the rear of the tow er. The non-combatants were rather slower in getting to cover but everyone w 7 as undercover in a minute or so. Mr. Claudius who had some difficulty in finding his quarters I took next to me in the combatant trench, the non-combatants’ trench being to our then rear. By the time this was done several rifle bullets had landed in camp, in fact just as Mr. Kensington turned to pass on my orders six shots, took ground in front of my tent and I heard several in the air. Still the fire w^as not hot and w hen Mr. Claudius informed me in the trench that his khalasis had reported the Sub-Surveyor killed, I could hardly credit it. The report was then denied but a khalassi was said to be wounded in the hand. Soon the fire slackened and I heard the tribal double march being chanted by our men which meant that they had driven the enemy back and were retiring. On this I left the trench and with Mr. Kensington commenced a systematic search. We soon found the Sub-Surveyor lying on his back at the door of his tent. There was a blood stain on his chest and his face w r as covered with blood, more especially about the region of the mouth, so I thought at first that he was shot through the lungs, but found after a brief examination that a dropping shot had taken him through the back of the head and out at the mouth. He breathed heavi ly once or twice while I w r as examining him and expired. A khalassi was then brought to me with a bullet through the palm of the right hand, w T hich had lodged on the other side just opposite the fork of the thumb and index finger. The man’s name is Hasan Ali. I hastily dressed this wound, placed the body of the Sub-Surveyor in one of the khalassi’s tents, put the wmunded man and ail non-combatants in tbe tow T er and the animals with their attendants in the compound. I reported these casualties to Othman and saw that an advanced line of outposts were pushed out on our right flank, and at Othman’s urgent request, sent a messenger to Loder to purchase ammunition w hich was very short among our irregulars. At the same time I sent a letter to the Sultan informing him of the affair and pointing out that had my urgent request been granted this would not have happened. I added that I should judge him by his*actions—that if I received an escort from him to Loder the following morning I should know that he was desirous of the good-will and respect of Government and treat him accordingly, and that if I did not receive this escort, I should class him as an accessory with those who had attacked us. I reminded him of his commercial relations with Aden and his frequently reiterated desires for alliance and friendship and told him that he now held his prosperity or the reverse in his two hands and invited him to choose between them. Almost as soon as my letter had left I got one from him, saying that he could not receivs us then, but would see about it after the big feast (ie., the Bakri Id.) Meanwhile Mr. Kensington had extended our fortifications and I placed my Arab asakir inside on the flank towards the enemy and the sepoys towards the front with myself and Mr. Kensington at the angle between the two to ensure perfect communication as our friendlies were scattered all along our front. We lay to our arms all night but there was no further attack. Just before dawn came a letter from the Audali Sultan saying that he did not care about the friendship or esteem of Government, and that his trade8 might look after itself, that he had no part or lot with the act of the Saidi, hut would not have us in his territory. In a letter to Othman he offered escort back to the Ifadthli border for us» if he (Othman) feared for our safety ! This offer was not accepted, I gave till 9 a.m. to see if any change of front would be made, then buried the Sub-Sur veyor in the village cemetery, all the local Arabs assisting, and withdrew^ We reached this camp (W. Nahain) at 3 p.m. to-day (January 10th). I had hoped to sit tight here, build a strong position and send a message to the Aulaki, asking him to come down through Dathina or send me one of his^~'',, brothers with a strong escort to take us up. I know that his periodical crop assesment visit to the Saidi and Diyan is about due in another month or so and no one in Dathina cares to gainsay or question his right of way. If he received the matter favourably as I had reason to hope, I would have had his escort here in ten days, but the bottom has been knocked out of this scheme by an official letter to me from Mr. Claudius, handed to me this afternoon in Camp and herewith enclosed. I am afraid the occurrences of the last few days have got on his nerves a bit and the latest I have heard from him is that he does not think he will be fit to travel to-morrow hut I have pursuaded him to make an effort as I want to get the wounded khalassi to Aden as soon as I can. I intend to send Mr. Claudius and all the khalassis by sea from Shukra if I get an opportunity. He tells me that these men are completely demoralized and they certainly look it. It is a serve strain to be a non-combatant in this sort of work, and the death of the Sub-Surveyor has had a very bad moral effect. That episode was cruelly hard luck. As for the expedition you can imagine how I feel about it and how deeply I regret your disappointment, but I will only say that I still think it possible if we could get the Aulaki down to Dathina or an escort from him, or I might go by sea to Ahwar and up through Lower Aulaki and Yeshbum. Only if a survey be attempted, I agree with the remaks anent this in Mr. Claudius’ letter to me (herewith enclosed). 1 am keeping all the tiasani and Audali correspondence for your information. The Mishal Chief told me as I passed there to-day that he with the Nakain sub-division (of which he is Akhil) had raided a Yafa’ village and district a few days ago; they looted all the livestock but lost 14 killed and 4 wounded in the assault and retirement. Yafa* losses not yet known. I march from here southwards to-morrow (January 11th), I was think ing of staying here and awaiting an envoy from the Aulaki, but can’t keep the expedition up here or allow them to go down without me. Besides you will probably want to recall me, and in any case I can get np as far as this in a very few days and it is all plain sailing. TVe reach Shukra on the evening of January 12th and I shall ship Claudius and party on the 13th : it is a 10-hour voyage. If the wind serves, he should be in Tawahi harbour before dark on the 13th. Expedition and myself should be in Aden on or about the 17th. Dated Aden, the 18th January 1904 (Confidential). Demi-official from—G. W. Buey, Esq., To Majoe-Geneeal P. J. Maitland, C.B., Political Resident at Aden. . continuation of my former report I wish to make a few remarks regard ing the survey party. When I first met Mr. Claudius, I told him, at some length, the conditions ot work which obtained in the distiicts we hoped to visit. He said that he did not mind taking risks, as he had already worked under similar conditions on the Indian irontier. On joining the expedition I soon found that Mr. Claudius had no idea of looking after his men or keeping them in hand. I was still of opinion that we act tar more khalassis with us than were necessary, so, on finding at Shukra uat sufficient warm bedding had not been procured for them, I suggested toMr. Claudius that some of the least physically fit among them should he sent back with some surplus stores which Mr. Claudius was returning. i -^ e , . a £ ree f a ? ld 0 5f. red f 0 s ^ nd five &gt; subsequently declared that the rest of his khalassis had threatened to desert if any more of their number were sent back. I waived the matter which simply concerned their own confort, but formed my own opinions of the discipline maintained by Mr. Claudius I’had constantly to complain about gross waste of water in districts where water was scarce and also straggling on the line of march in disturbed localities, Mr. Claudius himself being the worst offender in this respect. During the engagement on January 9th I had to forcibly place Mr. Claudius under cover, as he seemed unable to decide where to -o, and had his men moved smarter when ordered to get to cover, there would have been no casualties. After the affair, at the sight of the dead Sub-Surveyor the khalas- sis lecame a demoralized mob, the surviving Sub-Survevor being in such a state of panic that on the night of the 9th instant I feared he would lose his reason. I put all non-combatants in the tower at A1 Gauf but here Mr. Claudius appeared to think that the inmates might massacre them, and his fears spread to the khalassis. Notwithstanding all this, I had just the same difficulty about preventing Mr. Claudius and his party from straggling on the way down. You will of course understand that I make no reflections on Mr. Claudius, but wish to convey the idea that neither he nor his staff were adapted to the peculiar circumstances which are bound to attend survey in this country. °P^ ldon survey is feasible up-country but the khalassis should (with one or two exceptions) be replaced by properly enrolled Arabs and a British officer should undoubtedly be in charge of the survey party. It w;ould have been strange indeed had the khalassis behaved steadily with the example afforded by their own immediate superiors, who should have exerted themselves to allay the fears of their subordinates and not to excite them. Again, no native or Eurasian can hope to have the same grip on his subor dinates as a European, for among other reasous he can never be induced to take adequate measures for their welfare and comfort, all of which tells in a wild country. Mr. Claudius has I hear been enlarging somewhat on the perils he has undergone, stating that we met with nothing but hostility the whole way up. I fear he has lent a too credulous ear to the tales of his khalassis, for although^ the affair at A1 Gauf was no doubt an unpleasant experience to a man of his years, there can be no question about the friendly nature of our reception elsewhere.Minute Paper.

The survey of eight miles of the Subaihi border has been practically completed, and I trust no serious difficulties with the Turks will arise so far as this section is concerned. A claim has been put forward by the Turkish local authorities that the small Juhaili clan, of Subaihi origin, situated on the Haushabi border, forms part of the Turkish tribe of Kubati. This claim on the part of the Turks is based solely on the fact that at the last collection of taxes, which took place seven years ago, the Juhaili paid their taxes with the Kubati. The Juhaili clan is a small one, numbering some 130 souls ; but the only pass leading from the Raushabi into the Subaihi territory lies within their territory, which covers 10 square miles and forms an enclave in the British sphere. The ‘ Nine Tribes ’ includef he Subaihi as a whole, and the Turks by taking revenue from the Juhaili would seem to have committed an encroachment. It is important that we should be able, if necessary, to enter the Subaihi country from the north ; and I am therefore of opinion that the Juhaili territory ought to be retained on our side of the frontier.

Recent correspondence shows that Government contemplate the demarca- ° t i P)0r ^ er aMdj as Commission may soon approach that border, I have the honour to request that I may be furnished, as early as • W 1 lth 1 the followin g information respecting the political relations of that tribe with the Residency. 2. The Subaihi agreement of May 5th, 1881, applies to the ce territory occupied by all the Subaihi including the Mansuri, Makhdumi, Ruiai, and Dubaim, of whom the three former are at present {i.e., May 1881) stipendiaries but excluding such as at present acknowledge Turkish supremacy.” I would be glad to have a nominal list of the Subaihi sections covered by this agree ment, as also of those which in May 1881 acknowledged Turkish supremacy ; further, the names of the Subaihi sections that are at present in receipt of stipends or presents from the Aden Residency, with the amounts and nature of such stipends and presents as also the names of the influential Subaihi Chiefs with whom it would be advisable for the Commission to put itself in communi cation. 3. The Treaty of 1871 with the “Makhdumi and Rujai ” stipulated monthly payments of dollars 30 and 40 respectively to these sections, whilst the Treaty of May 13th, 1871, with the “Mansuri” made the latter answerable for the Kuresi. Are these treaties still in force ? 4. The protectorate Treaty with the Atifi of 1889 extends “to their territory between the territory of the Barhimi” and that under the authority of the Turkish Goyernment at “ Shekh Said.” I should be glad to know the Aden Residency view as to the point where the Subaihi border abuts on the coast ? ******** {Confidential.) Memorandum on the Subehi tribe. In 1873 Her Majesty’s Government pointed out to the Porte that for above lord Granville’s despatches of 30th January 200 years Yemen had been under the rule and 15th May 1873. ^ ^ 0 f independent Arab Chiefs, and stated that it was the wish of^ Her Majesty’s Government that the independence of those Chiefs in the vicinity of Aden should be respected, and that they would not view with indifference any attempt to subvert their authority. Nine tribes were named with whom treaty engagements had been entered into by Her 3381 F. D.Majesty s brovernment witliout reference to the Porte, and it was added that th British Government felt free to make fresh engagements if they thought it expedient. * o ^ it The Subehi were included in the nine tribes mentioned, and their status one of the tribes under British influence and protection does not seem to h ** been questioned since the above date. ' av ® The Subehis have no Sultan or Chief of the whole tribe, each section S therefore been regarded for political purposes as a separate tribe, and Ins dealt with apart from the others. ueen The earliest engagements with the Subehis date from 1839 the year nf n„ occupation of Aden. An agreement of friendship was then made with the Musaidi and Buseli, sections living with the Atifi in the Wadi Turan Jvk the Zaidi, or Zaidin. and with the Sherjabi. The agreementrwiA these l l sections were simply for the maintenance of peace and friendshin and nl stipends were attached to them. ^ a c no At some later date, which I have not been able to trace, arrangements appeal to have been come to with the Bajai and the Dubaini • for remarks (page 95 of Volume XI) that, prior to 1871 the only ChLfstt v in°“ stipends from the British Government were the heads of those^tribes.

They live in the district called Amur between the Subehi hills and the Wadi W^arezan. The SubeM sections of most importance at the present moment are these whose districts are in proximity to the frontier Hue. Commencing from the see coast the first section is the Atifi. With them ll ^ fch e Fuseli, Musaidi, and the Beni Eatah, and possibly other attached clans. The Beni hatah are Sayads. The Atifi claim that in former days their territory ran northward to Mokha, and beyond it. There is doubtless good warrant for this assertion, as they still exact from the Hakmi of those parts payments for wood and water rights. The refusal to pay these dues recently led to hostilities between the Atifi and the Hakmi, which produced a com- p amt fiom the Tuikish Ambassador. The Atifi. country, as described in our protectorate treaty with them is on “ the south coast of Arabia and situated be tween the territory of the Barhimi tribe and that under the authority of the Turkish Government at Shekh Said,” The possession of Shekh Said by the Turks cannot of course be disputed, more especially as when it was a question of the sale of that place by its Chief to a Trench Company, it w 7 as urged that such sale was invalid, on the ground that the land was an integral part of Turkish territory, and could not be sold without the consent 0 of that Government. (See enclosure of letter from the Viceroy to Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, No. 29, dated the 10th July 1876, and memoran dum, dated 7th March 1893, from the India Office.) It appears, however, that the Atifi territory runs up to the Turkish fort of Turba, and it is doubtful if the Turks had any right to build this fort where it is. It has been, however, a fait accompli for some twenty years, and it is not likely that their occupation of the site can now he disturbed. The small hamlet of Turba must not be confused with the Turkish fort so called by us. The point where the boundary line strikes the seashore would therefore to be some spot between the hamlet of Turba and the Turkish fort of that same. Trom this point the Atifi country runs eastward along the coast to Jabal Kharaz, and Jabal Am Mirsas, hut we do not know how far inland it extends. It includes the Wadi Turan, which contains some cultivation, and the village of the same name. On the east, the Atifi march with the Zureki, a clan with whom we have no relations, and with the Buremi and Burhimi. There are also^ Atifi in the Wadi Am Shahar east of Jabal Khawaz. The Beni Jirga and Am Jiraba, living at Kuderi and Dar Mujaraha, respectively, are subjects of the Buremi and Atifi. Ahmad ha Saleh, one of the chief sheikhs of the Atifi, lives on Jahal Masana or Masna. Boyond the Zureki and Buremi comes an important part of the frontier, viz., Jabal Khala, or the Maktari country. In the correspondence which preceded the “ Subehi Agreement ” of 1881 the Maktari and Athwari are specially stated to he independent sub-tribes inhabiting the hilly tracts border ing on the Turkish frontier to the north-west of the Subehi. The Turkish frontier was, therefore, at that time, beyond the territory inhabited by the Maktari and Athwari. To quote the words of the then Hesident’s letter to4 Government, No. 117-598, dated 16th May, 1881. -These two subtribes (Maktan and Atkwan) number respectively about 3,000 and 1.000, and have ™ ^en subjugated by the Turkish Authorities, being still independent” ike Maktan still assert their independence of the Turks, and during the last two years have repeatedly asked to be included in British territory. The rerdv made to them has in all cases been that, when the Boundary Commission reached their country, it would be decided whether they properly belonged to the British Protectrate, or must be included in Turkish territory. The °inclu- sion of Jabal Khala within the British boundary would be in some respects amvement, as it produces a large amount of the Kat so much consumed in As regards the Athwari, they live beyond the Jurebi, and we have had little to do with them. When the Sultan of Label undertook an exneditinn agamst the Subehi in 1882, the Athwari visited him at Dar Saiyeh, where Ihe Abdah then had a post. They said that if the British Governmlnt would • th6 TU i rkS ^ r0rQ takin S Possession of their country, they on their part would g^ve up levying transit dues. The inclusion of their country, with that Bp^ aktan -f m ^ ntl ^ Protectorate would not be objected to by the Aden .Residency if a good frontier line were thereby obtained. 7 Sultan :-j e uTedi, 0 Somati BaTafZk?/ followin 3 s 'bmitted to the Ahl Hawesh, Makmhi AM H ^ m . a i’ Dubeni &gt; Mansuri &gt; ^din, Barhimi, Bureml, Atris and A } 1 ^agim, Ahl Shukeri, Atifi, mountains.

[Repeated to Secretary of State for India, Political Department, Bombay, and Constantinople.) P. — I have received the following telegram. No. 9, dated the 21th January,from Colonel JVahab for transmission :— “ I have heard incidentally that, in addition to the troops required to guard our future communications betvceen Daral Kudaimi and Aden, and to the column which was suggested in our telegram No. 353, another column is being formed. I have accordingly pointed out in a letter which I have sent to General Maitland, that any action or show of force beyond that which is strictly necessary for the two objects mentioned above, will increase the risk to the survey party, and will render delimitation impossible, since such action may give rise to friction with the Subaihi, and make them distrustful of the avowedly peaceful intentions of the Boundary Commission.' The above telegram is not understood by me. Copies of my telegram of the 11M {? \i)th) January, and of my letter to the Lieutenant-General Com manding, Bombay, dated the Doth January, in which the military situation is described, are in the possession of Colonel JVahab. The movement of troops to Daral Kudaimi is necessary under any circumstances, and, more over, has been asked for by Colonel JVahab himself. Observing that harm might be caused by the premature advance of troops, even though they might be few in number, I asked for ten days' notice, and added “ the Subaihi must be given notice of our peaceful movement to Daral Kudaimi, and its objects clearly explained to them, as I am anxious they should not be alarmed.' I have since had a letter from JVahab suggesting that a portion of the troops now at Musemir might be used to strengthen force at Kudaimi, or to replace troops sent there from Aden, as I might think necessary. I have a7 ranged for this, and contemplate no other movements except the relief, by the newly arrived half-battalion, of the Native infantry at Dthali, and on the lines of communication. It is, at the same time, obviously necessary to be prepared for eventualities, sultan of Lahej mentions a report of a combination of the Subaihi to prevent e survey of their country. This information cannot be disregarded altogether, though at present I do not give it credence. -A ^ % (ffifm (x) Vv^// Sir / am directed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to transmit to you, to be laid before the. , Secretary of State for India, the accompanying CO p i0g despatches,as marked in the margitn,relating to the /.den Frontier Delimitation.

Up to the present no progress has been made with the treaty with Beda; in the event, however, of the Aulaki Multan entering into a formal engagement with us t it will hardly be possible for the Chief of Beda to hold back.

P. Mr. Bury reports, dated the 13M instant, that he is bringing back his survey 'party, and that a sub-surveyor named Abdul Jalil has been killed. It appears from the report that six miles south of Loder the Saidi tribe of that country fired' upon Mr. Bury s camp. The tribal escort, together with otho fnendly tribes, met the attack, which was not very serious / and after a few minutes firing the enemy appears to have retired. The sub-surveyor, however, by a strange fatality % was killed by a bullet fired at long range, and one Khalassie was also wounded, these being, apparently, the only casualties. It would have been possible for Mr. Bury to proceed ivith an escort from the Aid ale 1 (sic) Sultan, but he has been compelled against his will to return, as Mr. Claudius, the surveyor, has refused to go further. ■ (x.)From Resident, Aden, to Government of India, Foreign Department, \2th January 1904. {Repeated to Secretary of State for India, Political Department, Bombay, and Constantinople.) P —1 have received from Mr. FitzMaurice the following telegram, No. 1, for transmission to Sir N. O’ Conor :— “ With reference to the report of the death of Mohamed Nasir Mukbil, which was contained in my telegram No. 36, I am informed by the Turkish Commissioner that his information was inaccurate. A claim for Ad Dareja, TCafnf and the shrine of Shabwa has been revived by the local authorities, as reported in the entry dated the 21s^ December of our diary. A telegram has been sent to-day by the Turkish Commissioners to the effect that their investigations tend to show that the three places above-named—in respect of which the regrettable incidents of 1901 took place—really form a part of the Canton of the Haushabi; and that, therefore, subject to the sanction of the Porte, they are proceeding with the delimitation on this latter basis. “ I should be glad if your Fxcellency can cause a speedy reply, which cannot be otherwise than favourable, to be sent. The Sultan can scarcely be desirous of reopening the question which was settled in July 1901. Bis sanction, however, is required in order that the joint map may be signed by the Turkish Commissioners. ,,From Resident, Aden, to Government of India, Foreign Department, \Mh January 1904. {Repeated to Secretary of State for India, Political Department, Bombay, and Constantinople.) p # i have received from Colonel Wahab the following telegram, No. 2., dated the 9th January, for transmission :— &lt;« Your telegram to the Secretary of State of the 3rd on the subject of punitive measures to be taken against the Subaihi. The Resident at Aden has been asked for particulars, as no information has reached the Boundary Commission. The effect of a punitive expedition would probably be to exasperate the Subaihi and to drive them on to the frontier. The delimita tion of the frontier would thereby be rendered more difficult, both jor the Turks and ourselves. A further effect would be that supplies which are already scanty, would be diminished. Satisfactory progress is being made with the ILaushabi boundary I agree that the present moment, when the Boundary Commission is on the Subaihi border, is not the most opportune for exacting retribution from the tribe, though I am not afraid of the exasperation of the Subaihi.
