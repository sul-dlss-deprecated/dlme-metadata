I now enclose a copy of the correspondence received from the Foreign Office in reply. I think the only step that it is necessary to take at the moment is for you to make discreet enquiries from one or more of the leading members of the -various communities originating from the Indian subâ€”continent only on the point how many of them have been resident in Muscat for over two generations. You might also perhaps enquire where necessary e.g., from the Khojas and Agakhanis, whether they consider themselves Indians or Pakistanis, Please letme know the results. I do not think it will be necessary for you to take Qwadur into consideration at the moment. (SigwJ) w, !t. iUr. R.R, Ellison ESQ, Political Agent, Muscat. 1_r PORBION OPPICB, S.W. 1. 28tli January 1949 CONPIDETIAL (B 1139/1601/91) Dear Sir Rupert, Please refer to your Beapatch No 166 dated 6tli December 1948 regarding the l^iture of the Hindu community in Muscat* 8, I enclose a copy of a letter receired from the Commonwealth Relations Office commenting on the points raised in your Despatch. The next step would appear to be, as the letter suggests, for us to ascertain what proportion of the Hindu community in Muscat would 'become United Kingdom citizens if the amendment referred to is passed. Of course not only the Hindus but other Indian communities in Muscat may be affected and we should take stock of their position also.E Pol 10162/49 Cornmonwealth Relations Office, Downing Street. SO January 1949 Dear Rogers, Please refer to your letter to Harrison of 6th January No B 15892/73/91 regarding Hindus resident in Muscat. 2 It is difficult to say exactly vhat provisions would 'be made with regard to nationality if India went completely out of the Commonwealth, and it is by no means certain that the legislation on the subject would follow very closely the Burma Independence Act, 1947 # The more immediate problem however, arisef from the proposed citizenship provisions of the Indian Constitution read in the light of the British Nationality Act, 1948, There is an official amendment to Article 5 of the Draft Constitution which, if it is passed, will secure Indian citizenship for any Indian in Muscat who, or either of whose parents, or any of whose grandparents, was born in the territory of India. Those Hindus in Muscat who do not fulfil this requirement will, provided their British nationality has been secured by registration at a British Consulate, become United Kingdom citizens under the British nationality Act. It is important therefore to ascertain what proportion of the Hindu community in Muscat will thus become United Kingdom citizens. Perhaps you could make enquiries on this point. The Treaty Department too would be interested; we have had some correspondence with them on the somewhat similat question of Hindus in Burma. Yours sincerely. Sgd (P. H, Cleobury) T.B.
