It includes the initial agreements for prospecting and concessions rights with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in Kuwait. The file includes numerous papers that discuss the progress of rival oil companies on the Arabian Peninsula's Persian Gulf coast, most notably, the Eastern and General Syndicate under the guidance of Major Frank Holmes. The letters and agreements are mainly exchanged between the Political Agent in Kuwait, the Ruler of Kuwait, and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, as well as representatives of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Contract law</topic></subject><subject><topic>Petroleum extraction</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Eastern and General Syndicate Limited, oil company</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Kuwait Oil Company</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Kuwait</topic></subject><subject><topic>Resources exploration</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000ec#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000ec#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000ec#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000ec#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
