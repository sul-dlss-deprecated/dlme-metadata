The file has its original file cover (ff. 2 and 172) which includes the title of the file in Arabic ['Namr 9, hadhā fīl khaṭūṭ al-mashāyikh al-saḥil ‘umān al-mutaṣāliḥ lil-wikālah al-bālyūziyah…']. These letters cover 24 Ṣafar 1343 [24 Sept 1924] and 6 Muḥarram 1346 [6 Jul 1927], but are mostly from 1344 and 1345 AH (1925/1926 and 1926/1927). The text of the letters is almost entirely in handwritten Arabic, although there is one instance of printed Arabic (f. 38) and some letters also appear in handwritten and printed English (for example, ff. 79-80 and 159).The majority of the letters are from Sa‘īd bin Maktūm Āl Maktūm, ruler of Dubai, and his brother, Jum‘ah bin Maktūm, as well as other Trucial Coast shaikhs, including: Khālid bin Aḥmad Āl Qāsimī, ruler of Dibba; Sulṭān bin Zāyid Āl Nahyān and Ṣaqr bin Zāyid Āl Nahyān, rulers of Abu Dhabi; Sulṭān bin Ṣaqr Āl Qāsimī, ruler Sharjah; Ḥamad bin Ibrāhīm Āl Mu‘allā and Aḥmad bin Rāshid Āl Mu‘allā, rulers of Umm al-Qaywayn; Ḥumayd bin ‘Abd al-‘Azīz Al Nu‘aymī, ruler of Ajman; Sulṭān bin Sālim al-Qāsimī, ruler of Ras al-Khaymah; ‘Abd al-Raḥman bin Muḥammad al-Shāmsī, ruler of Hira. In addition, there are letters from various Dubai merchants, as well as British Indian subjects mainly resident at Dubai, including ‘Abd al-Qādir bin Ḥājj Muḥammad ‘Abbās, Muḥammad Fārūk Bastakī, Hājji Muḥammad Sharīf Aḥmad, Hājji ‘Abd al-Raḥmān Bastakī, Damanmal Isardas, and Khushaldas Moolchand.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0002dd#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
