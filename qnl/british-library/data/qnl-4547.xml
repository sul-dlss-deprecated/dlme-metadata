Q47 (a) The activities of the Afghan Air Force have been on a reduced scale during the summer months due to a shortage of serviceable aircrait and a lack of spares. Six Hind aircraft were despatched to Jalalabad in October for the purpose of carrying out air reconnaissances in the Lunar valley and for purposes of training. They will remain in Jalalabad for the winter months as usual. They were despatched somewhat earlier this year, due to a recrudescence of Safi discontent. * (b) The reorganisation of the Afghan Air Force is still under discussion, and it is understood that when the Government have purchased the 12 Avro XIX aircraft, the Afghan Air Force will be re-organised into three squadrons as follows:- (i) No. 1 Squadron - Hind aircraft. Two flights of 7 or 8. (ii) No. 2 Training Squadron with 8 Tiger Loth, 4 Romeo and i Hind aircraft. (iii) No. 3 Squadron with 12 Avro XIX aircraft. The aircra he present position regarding the serviceability ft is shown in Appendix f A' to this report. of (c) In September 1947 the Afghan Government despatched Lt-Col. Abdur Razaq Khan to London to negotiate with the British Government for the supply of 12 Avro Anson XIX aircraft, with 5 years spares. He is still so far as is known in London. The chief difficulty in regard to the E u r c ^? 36 ^^ ese aircraft has been a lack of sterling credits, but the Afghan Government are believed to have overcome this difficulty by arranging for the sale of Persian lambskins on the London market. When the Avro XIX aircraft have been purchased, the Afghan^Government hope that the R.A.F. and the Government, of Pakistan will assist them in taking delivery of the aircraft at Karachi and in providing facilities for training Afghan personnel to fly them. (d) The sample Spitfire VIII aircraft was returned to India on August 6th. S/Ldr G.F. Reid D.F.C., R.A.F., considered that the aircraft was unsuitable for.use in Afghanistan owing tp its high speed, lack of facilities for training Afghan pilots to _fly the aircraft, the high expenditure m petrol and the difficulties of me.intaininr the Spitfire when used on rough airfields. (e) The Afghan Government while still interested in establishing civil air services in Afghanistan, appear to have come to the conclusion that they cannot afford such a luxury at the present moment. In January the Tr-ns-World Airways 1 ission headed by General Giles visited Her-t, but the scheme put forward by the Mission was apparently considered an expensive one by the Afghans, and no further developments have.taken^place. Russian reactions to the visit of the American Air Mission were prompt, and theRussian Ambassador informed the Afghan L’inister for Foreign Affairs that Russia considered that Northern Afghanistan was in her sphere of influence, and they could not allow the Americans to develop© airfields in Northern Afghanistan. Should such a development occur Russia would regard it as a further attempt by the Anglo-Saxons to encircle Soviet Russia. , Rahim, paid a ten (f) An Indian Air Mission headed by Mr. M.i Director General of Civil Aviation in India, day visit to Kabul at the end of May. Both Indian National Airways and Orient Airways were_represented, and it would seem that the differences of opinion between these two interests,_did not escape the notice of the Afghans. The Afghan officials conducting the discussions sp^nt most of their time in collecting^information, attempting to secure a large loan^for developing the country and suggesting that foreign firm wishing to inaugurate air services in Aignanistan should be prepared to pay for the construction » installations etc. The Mission achieved very little beyond an exchange of viev;s. (g) The Conrandant of the iir Force G.h. Abdur Razoq Khan, has during the suraner prepared several schemes for the inaugurate ion of small Afgnan civil air services between Kabul and provincial capitals, with possible extensions to leheran, Peshawar and Lahore. The British Pilot Instructor has been assisting him in the preparation of these schemes, bhould such civil air services be inaugurated, the Avro MIX aircrait will be utilised. 2. HIND SdU ADROMB.

AVIAT ION PET ROL. No change has been reported in the stocks of 87 Octane petrol held in the country.

Committee • Half-year Report on the Afghan Air Force - 1st November 1946 to 30th April, 1947 Under Secretary^... Secretary c^State.... CouncLK^T; 1 able '4, Copy to Previous Papers :— 1. The period under review has been rather disappointing for the Afghan Air Force for two reasons. Firstly the winter weather enforced inactivity and flying was confined to weekly training flights in Hind aircraft flying from Jalalabad, Secondly the few aircraft possessed by the Afghan Air Force are rapidly becoming unserviceable. The latter factor has partly been the cause of delays in the projected reorganisation of the Air Force; since the Afghans consider any reorganisation a waste of time until new aircrafi^p obtained. The Commandant of the Air Force, Lt.-Gen.^lsadullah Khan is also Chief of the G-eneral Staff, and has been officiating as Minister of Defence, and has consequently not had sufficient time to devote to his Air Force duties. 2. The number of serviceable aircraft in the Afghan Air Force:-- Hawker Hind 17 Italian Romeo aircraft A Tiger Moths 8 American St^man aircraft 1 The number of serviceable Hind aircraft was increased to 19 by the arrival of spare propellers, but it was reduced to 17 again by an accident. The Romeo aircraft are now almost oosolete; and the 1 St^jpman is permanently allotted to the Commandant to the Sherpur Airfield, Kabul. The Tiger Moths are still useful and could, if required, carry out'light bombing operations. 29b 1000 5.31 3./3. The shortage of spare rjarts for the Hind aircraft ■wh&amp;i, according to Col. Lancaster has been crippling the Afghan Air Force, will shortly he relieved. ¥e have heard recently that the Hawker Company now have a supply of spare parts ready for despatch to Kabul. It is to be hoped that the delivery of 12 Avro Anson XIX aircraft to Kabul will shortly take place; the Afghans showed great interest in the aeroplane of this type which was flown to Kabul in February by Sq. Ldr. Reid, and this st^dvandreliable machine should be very suitable for ime Afghan Sq. Ldr. Reid’s report on his demonstration of the Avro XIX is given in Appendix B to the report. The Afghans have also seen sample Spitfire VIII, but it is doubtful if this high-powered single-seater machine is really suitable for their requirements. 4. Apart from the developments mentioned in the preceding paragraph there have been few Afghan requests for British assistance in the supply of equipment. It is possible that they are waiting on developments in India, or that they are putting out feelers elsewhere. But they continue to rely on the R.A.F. for Instructors, Wing Commander King, the British Pilot Instructor, was succeeded by Sq. Ldr. G-.F. Reid, D.F.C., in April. 5. Paragraph 11 of the Report outlines proposals for the establishment of civil air services. These include a service to be operated by Trans-World Airways between Tehran, Kabul, and Karachi} a service between Peshawar, Kabul, and Tehran to be operated by a new Afghan Air Service Company and various internal services. They are ambitious plans, and it is likely that financial considerations will make progress slow. / RiA^L.03. The shortage of spare -parts for the Hind aircraft ■which, according to Col.

Son^ial^ (a) The Afghan Mr Force has been inactive during the winter months, no operations have been carried out thougn a few i reconnaissance flights have been made oyer tribal areas m the Eastern and Southern provinces. Six Hind aircraft were despatched from Kabul to Jalalabad in December 1946 and returned to Kabul at the end of March 1947.- Preliminary flying . training was given to 8 students on one day per week during tne time these aircraft were based on Jalalabad. (b) The reorganisation of the Afghan Air Force has beenunder discussion and various schemes and paper plans for effecting tins have been prepared and submitted to Hill. King Zahir Shah for approval, out have not so far been implemented. The delay in putting the Government's plans into effect have been due to the pre-occupations of the Commandant of the Air Force, Lt-Gen. ’Asadullan Khan who has been Chief of the General j^taff and officiating Minister of Defence, the absence of Major Razaq Khan on conferences connected with the establishment of civil air services in Afghanistan and a feeling that until sprue new aircraft are purchased from abroad any reorganisation is a waste of time. (c) The present position regarding serviceable aircraft is shown in appendix ’A* to this report and it will be seen that the Afghan Air Force is at low ebb and probably incapable of meeting possible commitments in respect of tribal policing. The existing situation can be summed up as follows (i) 17 British Kind aircraft remain serviceable and some of these may have to be cannibalized owing to the impossibility of obtaining spare parts. The Afghan Government have always stressed the point that they normally require three squadrons eachof 12 serviceable aircraft, two squadrons to deal with possible tribal disturbances m two separate areas and one squadron as a reserve. These aircraft are not available at present. (ii) Out of the 16 Italian Romeo aircraft, a very doubtful 4 remain capable of prolonged flights and even then cannot take off with full war loads. (iii) The 8 Italian Breda trainer aircraft are all on the scrap heap. (iv) The 8 British Tiger Moth trainer aircraft could be utilized for light bombing in an emergency but can hardly be regarded as operational aircraft. (v) The solitary U.S.A. Stearman trainer aircraft is now allotted to Major Abdur Razaq the Commandant of the Sherpur airfield for purposes of reconnaissanc only. The Afghan Government are therefore very anxious to acquire more aircraft at the earliest possible moment and fortnis reason have been considering the purchase of second hand Spitfire VIII aircraft from India and new &amp;vro Anson XIX aircraft from England. (d) sample second hand Spitfire VIII aircraft was delivered to the Afghan Government at Peshawar in February and flown to Kabul where it is being tested out by the British pilot instructor attached to 'the Royal Afghan Air x^orce Afghan to the suitability of the Spitfire for Afghanistan and no definite decision has yet been given._ Afghan opimon_ as has varied xx^- ^ ^^^xx _x»^xx. ..*^xxcx. pilots are said to be scared of its high speed and difficulties are envisaged regarding the training of Afghan pilots to fly this single seater Aircraft. The nigh cost of flying and maintaining the Spitfire and the damage likely to occur to these high speed on rough airfields are a decision to purchase the Spitfire aircraft when landing at factors counting against type of aircraft. fctnWovc (e) A order was placed in 1946 for the supply from England of 12 Avro XIX light transport cum operational aircraft ana spares for 5 years with delivery at Karachi between January and May 1947. Difficulties have since arisen over payment as the firm supplying the aircraft require 50/o cash with the order and the remaining 50'?o to be paid on delivery. The Afghan Government are unable to comply with these terms because they have insufficient funds in sterling, and would prefer to pay the bill in three annual instalments. The 'Afghan Government are now considering how they can obtain the necessary sterling to pay for the aircraft and until the money is found no firm order can oe placed. Squadron Leader G.F. Reid D.F.C., R.A.F., paid a visit to Kabul in^February flying from Peshawar to Kabul in an Avro XIX. This visit provided an excellent opportunity for testing out this type of aircraft under local conditions and of reviving Afghan interest in the Avro XIX. The Afghan Government readily gave permission for the visit of S/Ldr Reid and his British crew of two airmen on condition that they were to be treated as guebts of the British Legation and if there was any comment by other foreign missions in Kabul they were to be informed that the visit had been allowed because the Afghan Government were interested in the type of aircraft they were flying to Kabul, itelavaht‘extracts from S/Ldr. &gt; Reid t s report on the test of the Ayro XIX in Kabul are given in Appendix 'B T to this report, and as will be seen the results are extremely satisfactory. (f)_ The Afghan Government have been taking steps to establish civil air services in Afghanistan and it would appear that they envisage three possibilities (i) the establishment of an air service between Kabul and Teheran via Herat and Kabul and the Persia^Gulf via Kandahar. The service to be run by a joint Afghan-American Company linked with Trans-World Airways Limited. (ii) the extension of the services of Indian National Airways from Peshawar to Kabul and Quetta to (iii) the inauguration of Afghan civil air services between Kabul, Kandahar, Herat and Mazar-i-Sharif with possible extensions to Peshawar, Karachi, Meshed and Teheran. Such developments as have occurred are referred to in a later paragraph.(g) . Appendix ’A' to this report gives the na r .iber of serviceable aircraft on the strength of the Afghan Air Force on 30th April 1947 and the nunber of Afghan pilots vho are capable 01 flying the various types of aircraft. 2 .

Four officers, Pilots G-.U. .Shah Muhd Khan and B.M. Abdul_Muhd Khan and Mechanics B.M. Saiyed Muhd Rahim Khan and B.M. Muhd Qasim Khan were killed. The families of the officers.were given MO,000 Afghanis each as compensation, with an additional F:5,000 Afghanis for the family of the senior officer G.M. 3 hah Muhd Khan. (e) Maintenance. The arrival of propellers from England increased the number of serviceable Hinds by four to 19 but the accident recorded above again reduced the number t&lt;? 17. Spares for.Hind aircraft are now unobtainable in both India and Great Britain unless they are to be manufactured specially at a.very high cost.

Lee R.A.F., arrived at the end of January and is at present employed in teaching a number of students the theory of wireless. The first batch of students detailed to attend his course had no knowledge of mathematics, and have had to be replaced by better educated youths.

The 10 W/T students placed_under the British WA instructor proved to be incapable of imbibing instruction through a lack of Knowledge of mathematics and had to be eliminated from T/T work. Htempts are now being made to turn then into fitters and riggers* 6. Airliiiliaa. (a) Sh,grppr r No change. There is still some talk of abandoning the airff&amp;ld when the Khwaja Rawash proiect is completed, and of constructing a civil airfield at Butkhak 15 miles cast of Kabul. (b) Kbwaja..£aiaahu. (i) The 2,000 metre runway has been marked out but no other work commenced. It is not yet known whether Burma-Shell or Iforrison Knudsen are to be given the contract for its construction* (ii) Major F.E. Donnithorne R.I.E*, and.an Indian team of technicians arrived in Kabul early in April to erect two reinforced S.W*P* Hangars at Khwaja nawash for which 4 Sets of steel work has been ordered from India* Their services, have been lent to the Afghan Government fop a period of 4 to 6 months, the Afghan Government being responsible for their pay and allowances* SeVen additional sets of steel and sheeting for S.W.P. Hangars are on order from India and will probably be used for erecting two more reinforced Hangars in Kabul, and one each at Kandahar, Herat and the Baghlan area. 7. Aviation Petrol. There is little or no change in the stocks of 87 Octane petrol held in the country. 1,000 gallons of 10DOctane petrol have been imported, 500 gallons of this is earmarked for use by the sample Spitfire VIII aircraft and 500 gallons dispatched to Kandahar and Herat for issue to Trans-World Airways aircraft if and when required.-5- 8.

Reid D.F.C., R.A.F. arrived in Kabul on 17th April to take over the duties of Pilot Instructor. His contract is to be for a period of two years. (b) W/0 R.L. Blyth R.A.F. rigger instructor and WO H. Waterhouse R.A.F. engine mechanic and instructor continue their good work in effecting repairs to aircraft and both of . them are prepared to prolong their attachment to the Afghan Air Force. (c) W/0 W.H. Coleman R.A.F., stores instructor will have completed his year’s attachment on 12th June 1947 and will be returning to tne R.A.F. in India. The Afghan Government do not require a relief for him. . „ A . . During his attachment he has-trained a number of Afghans in the R.A.F. system of storekeeping and had the necessary forms printed for inaugurating this system in the Afghan Air Force, nlthough the Ministry or Defence have stated that they intend to introduce the R.A.F. system of storekeeping and have expressed their appreciation of w/0 Colornan’s work in Kabul, it appears that various elements in the Air Force and Army prefof the Turkish system of storekeeping with the result that no final decision nas been made. (d) Sgt. W.O. Lee R.A.F., W/T Instructor arrived in Kabul on 30tn January. His attachment is to be for one year in the first instance. His efficiency as a WT operator and W/T mechanic has already secured for him the confidence pf.the Afghans, but he himself feels that there is not sufficient .sdopo for him in Afghanistan particularly as his first batch of students were so disappointing. There have been fewer requests from the Ministry of Defence for British help in respect of the Afghan Air Force during the past 6 months and this is perhaps due to a realisation that the R.A.F. have their own difficulties to cope with during the transfer of power in India and cannptbe expected to meet Afghanrequirernents in full. Senior officials in the Ministry of Defence still say that they rely on the R.A.F. for their , training and on India and Great Britain for the supply og the aircraft and equipment they require. It is however possible that the Afghan Government arc sounding the U.S.A. and even France or Italy regarding the assistance they are prepared to t give to the Afghan Air Force in the supply of aircraft and equipment and the training of Afghan personnel should the R.A.-d* be unable to provide the Help they need, The prestige of,the R.A.F. is as high as ever in the Afghan Air Force* but political developments in India and the possible cutting off of close liaison with the R.A.F. in India ih the near future, is causing some anxiety amongst Afghan officers.

The offergto train 63 Afghan ground personnel in India has been considered by the Afghan Government, as also an offer to train 12 meteorologists but no decision has been reached so far. It is believed that the Afghan Government hope that a concrete_scheme will be put forward by the Air Ministry for the establishment of a Flying Training School in Kabul staffed by R.A.F. personnel and provided with all necessary training equipment. The acceptance of the offer to train meteorologists is held up owing to the difficulty of finding Afghan students with an adesquate knowledge of English and mathematics. (d) the request for assistance by the R.A.F. at^Karachi_ in training 6 Afghan pilots and 12 mechanics and fitters in the use of the Avro aIX aircraft remains in obeyance until suchq time as the contract for the supply of the Avros has been signed by the Afghan Government, (e) nothing more has been heard about the dispatebq of 3 to 5 Afghan pilots to India or England for advanced flying training. It is probable that the Afghan ^Government are awaitmg a decision regarding the possible establishment of a Flying Training School in Kabul under R.A.F. auspices. 10. Civil Ayiftkio n - R u ssian S e rvi ce. of It has now been possible to secure the marking of (pne the Dakota aircraft used on the Tashkent - Kabul service. These are:- a) On the fin of the aircraft b) On the fuselage and wings The U.3.A. No. 478797 Russian markings of C.C.C.F. A 1014. This aircraft is probably one of those supplied to Russia by the U.S.A. under the Lease Lend Agreement. 11. Sche mes for the esta blishment of Civil Air_Seryi.ces^ (a) The Afghan Government have been cqnsidering various schemes for the inauguration of civil air services in the country. The first one has involved negotiations with a Mission sent by Trans-World Airways to Herat at^the end of January and it is understood that General Giles the head of the Mission has made the following proposals to the Afghan Government. (i) the establishment of services between Teheran and &gt; Kabul via Herat and Kandahar, Kabul and Dhahran via Kandahar and Lingah and Kabul and Karachi via Kandahar and Quetta. (ii) that o or 6 Dakota aircraft be used and Trans-World Airways provide the pilots and technical staff.to operate the services. (iii) that the cost of inaugurating the services will be #955,000. that the cost of operating the services for the first year will be #1,354,596. (iv) (v) that revenue for the first year from an average of 14 passengers per aircraft plus freight and mail willbe #1,533,522 grid permit of a profit of #178,926. (vi) the charge for passengers to be 15 cents per air mile. The Afghan Government are studying these proposals, but it does not seem likely that they can afford to lav out even 50% of the cost of startinr the serviipes assunung tnat X- f rv Trans-World Ainvays^are prepared to finance them to the extent of the remaining 50%. (b) The second scheme on which the Afghan Government are. working is the inauguration of an Afghan National Air Service Company to provide air services between Kabul and Peshawar, Kabul and Idazar-i-Sharif, Kabul and Herat via Kandahar and Kaoul to Teheran via lleshed. Avro XIX aircraft to be used. No less than eight different plans have been prepared by the Afghan Air Force in consultation with the British pilot instructor, but no definite conclusions have been reached. The most recent plan envisages (i) (ii) (iii) (iv) the formation of a company with a capital of h 5 million Afghanis. . . the purchase of six Avro XIX aircraft for use on the services. the cost of operating the, services for the first year as Ib3,553,364 Afghanis. ^ . revenue for the first%ear as %4,461,969 Afghanis and nett profit as Ps908,605 Afghanis. This plan would also appear too optimistic as insufficient allowances have been madefor depreciation,cost^of operation, a reduction in the number of passengers available or can oe transported in addition to a crew oi two and the low proposed charge of Mi Afghanis per passenger per air mile. This i scheme has however an advantage in that the services could oe operated by Afghan Air Force personnel using military airiiol-s, though there would be many otner snags if the international rules for civil aviation are to be complied witn. .mghan possesses a ’B’ Glass flying licence at present. (c) Indian National Airways originally proposed to dispatch a Mission to Kabul in April 1947 for the purpose.of discussing with the Afghan Government extensions of their air services ±rom Peshawar to Kabul and Quetta.to.Kandahar. The Afgnan Government have agreed to receive the Mission out a definite date ibr tlieir arrival has not been fixed.MI UkizJlQ.

FOR USE BY DEPARTMENT ONLY. 1. General. • • During the period under review operational activities were confined to a few reconnaissance flights from Jalalabad and Kabul during May and June. Meanwhile the reorganization of the Air Force contin ues, though somewhat slowly, chiefly due to the fact that Lt.Gen. Asadullah Khan, Conmandant of the Air Force, is also Chief of the General Staff and since June has been Acting Minister of Defence. He has accordingly had little time to devote to air force matters. 2. Strength. The effective strength of the air force at present is as follows:- (a) Operational Aircraft 1? Hawker Hinds 4 Italian Romeo Aircraft (b) Trainer Aircraft 1 American Stearman 8 Tiger Moths. There are sufficient trained pilots to man all these machines. /TheThe arrival from England of spare propellers for Hind Aircraft has increased the number of serviceable aircraft of this type from 12 to 17» and the Hind still remains the main bulwark of the air force. The arrival of an eighth Tiger ftfoth from India, together with five years’ spares for all the 8 has enabled the Plying Training School to resume its functions again with this type of aircraft. The standard of the pilots of the Romeo Aircraft is very low at the moment, but the arrival from England of washers to recondition the petrol pumps has made the Romeo capable of carrying out long-range flights; this should help to increase the efficiency of the pilots. One Romeo Aircraft crashed during a formation take off in July and had to be written off; this is the only accident reported and the pilot was uninjured. The American Stearman Trainer has been flown a few times during the summer to compare its efficiency with the Tiger Moth. 3. Training. Of 60 students from Kabul who have joined the Air Force for training, 20 are to be trained as pilots, 20 as riggers, 10 as wireless operator mechanics, and 10 as w/l• operators. Only 20 have so f ar reported for duty. The Afghan Air Force continues to rely to a large extent on British assistance in the matter of instructors. A request was made in June to Air Headquarters in India for additional facilities for training in Kabul, including the training of U N.C.O.pilots; but so far it has only been possible to provide for the training of 63 ground personnel. A. Supply. The supply of secondhand Spitfire VTII's for testing, which was requested in the spring, has not yet been made owing to delav in certain technical alterations necessary before a Spitfire can be sold to a foreign government. If this aircraft proves suitable, the Afghan Government propose to order 12 to 2k Spitfires, together with spares for five years. It was decided not to proceed with the supply of a sample Hurricane C.II, as this aircraft was not considered suitable for use in Afghanistan. 12 Avro XIX light transport operational aircraft have been ordered and deliveries will be made at Karachi during the first half of 19A7• 5. Airfields It is proposed to construct a runway 2,000 metres .in length at Khwaja Rawash, and to reinforce S.W.P.hangars have been ordered from India. Plans are also being made for the enlargement of Herat Airfield. 6. Morale The presence of 8 Tiger Moths and the prospective delivery of a Spitfire VIII and 12 Avro XIXs has served to increase morale. The presence of British instructors has a good effect, though the emphasis is more on N.C.0*instructors as it is thought that the presence of more than two or three R.A.P.off icers in Kabul /might© /*£ might arouse comment fran the Russian Embassy* There appears to be a general tendency to tighten up on efficiency. 7* Civil Aviation The Afghan Government are interested in establishing a civil air service between Persia, Herat and Kabul. Two American Missions are to visit Kabul and according to Afghan officials it is proposed to allow one or two world air services to serve Afghanistan. A public company is to be formed to operate internal feeder services and, in the meantime, the Afghan Air Force will probably run these feeder aircraft. / .

Operational aciivities were at a minimum in the period under review, but it was fruitful in plans for the future, many of which seem to be in a fair way towards execution. The new Commandant, while appreciating his lack of technical knowledge, is exer cising a sensible and keen supervision. Morale has been notably improved by reforms of conditions of service and acknowledgment of the outstanding performance of the Air Force in the Kunar campaign. The effective strength of the Air Force is at present as follows (a) 12 Hawker Hinds . These ancient but well maintained aircraft still form the backbone of the Air Force. Their all-round utility has rendered them invaluable in the maintenance of internal security, but they are now approaching the end of their useful life, since it is impossible to obtain further spares for them. Enquiries were recently conducted as far afield as South Africa, but it appears that the, Hinds are the last of their kind on active service. The/The only source for spares now available is material salvaged from aircraft which have been written off ais unserviceable, except when, as in the recent case of the 24 propellers, the quantity is sufficient at last placed a firm order in the Spring of this year for eight of these aircraft for elementary training purposes, remission was obtained from the Mr Ministry and the aircraft were flown out to Kabul from India; one unfortunately crashed en route but is being repaired. To this may be added in the course of the next twelve months:- ( c ) 12 Avro XIX*s . These are to serve partly as replacements for the Hinds and partly as light transport aircraft. A firm order is to be placed with the manufacturers as soon as the Ministry of Supply can afford the necessary priorities. ( d ) 12 Spitfire Vlirs . (Not Hurricanes as stated in the Report). A sample is to be flown up to Kabul when the Mr Ministry have given permission. Apparently there is at present a ruling in force cate gorically fo: the transfer of aircraft from India^' If the sami proves satisfactory the Afghams intend to purcha; secondhand machines of this type from stocks in India* The spares position is being investigated. Presumably the Spitfires are required to supplement the Avro’s in replacing the Hinds of which there were originally 28 * Equipment . Apart from the iiind propellers, and a long list of other Hind spares^ very little of which could be met, requests have been directed to India. The most important is the firm order for supply dropping equipment, which was strongly recommended by Wing-Commander Taylor, then RIAELO at this Office, last February in preference to the purchase of new aircraft for Army co-operation purposes. British Instructors with the Afghan Mr Force . Ml the Instructors are now officers and N.C.O^ on secondment from the R.A.F., and the problem of discipline presented by the former civilian Instructors has disappeared. Wing- Commander King, the Pilot Instructor, arrived in Kabul in 1943; Warrant Officer Blyth, Titter and Rigger Instructor, has been there for about a year, and Warrant Officer Waterhouse, Engineer Instructor, took up his duties in April last. The esteem in which their services are held is indicated by the Afghans request for a year’s loan of two further R.A.F. Warrant Officers for instruction in Wireless Telegraphy and Storekeeping. Mr Ministry permission has been granted and it is expected that the two Instructors will reach Kabul shortly. A short course in Wireless Instruction was given to selected Afghan Officers by a Royal Signals N.C.O. in December 1945 - January 1946. to justify a special order for manufacture. Ten out of these 24 propellers have already been despatched by air. (b) 7 Tiger M oths. After prolonged hesitation, the Afghan Government Training . A tentative request has been lodged with the Government of India for facilities for advanced training of//vy tr - - -tL /uJ^ ^ i—mn J of some 70 to 80 officers and other ranks. Colonel Lancaster writes that if the G-ovemment of India should not be prepared to grant the facilities the Afghan G-ovemment will turn to the U.S.A.j or any other country, (except possibly Russia) for this training and with the training will follow the purchase of aircraft from the country involved in the training of Afghan Air r'orce personnel. A firm request and details are awaited from the Afghans. General. Work is in progress on hangars at Khwaja Rawash (Kabul Military Airfield) and a survey of a proposed runway of about 2,000 metres has been completed. It appears that the petrol shortage in Afghanistan has had no serious effect on the Air Force, as stocks of high octane fuel are at the maximum of capacity of the tanks. Paragraph l(d) of Colonel Lancaster’s report deals with the prospects of Civil Aviation in Afghanistan. Elsewhere he remarks that among the advantages of the Afghans* decision to purchase Avro XIX*s is the revision of facilities for feeder services whenever a new trunk Civil Air Service is established through Afghanistan, and neither the Russians nor the Americans can possibly object to such a development under these circumstances./ &gt; 1?

Changes which have accurred include (i) a reorganisation of squadrons on the R.A.F. model; (iij the transfer to other duties or the retirement of officers who are inefficient; (iii) the separation of the Air Staff from executive com mand at the Sherpur airfield, and the formation of Air S' .ff offices in the Ministry of Defence; (it) a reorganisation of the system of storing and issuing aircraft spares; ' (v) miving the British Pilot Instructor more direct control over the administration of the Air Force; (vi) the introduction of new rules for the recruitment^of Air x?orce personnel, and the drawing up of plans tor improving terms of service. (b) The new Commandant of the Air Force, Lt. Gen, Asadullah Khan is taking a keen interest in all matters cpnnecbca witn the Air Force, ana while exercising general supervision, is prepared to delegate his responsibilities to more junior officers.

Asadullah Khan spent..two months in India during the winder, returning to Kabul on 16th ;larch. _ The visit was connected with obtaining medical treatment for his family and had no oliicial basis. (c) The Afghan Govt having once again realised the value of even a small Air Force for assisting, the Amy to deal with tribal disturbances, have been considering how they can secure mQ£a trainer and operational aircraft at the earliest possiDie dat?. The position from their point of view is.unsatisfactory since all the Italian Breda trainers are unserviceable, and there is only one American Stearman trainer which is rar^iy x flown. As regards operational aircrait the Italian Romeos are rA useless for this purpose and the number of serviceable Hind MPA aircraft has dropped to 12 .

In December last the Afghan Govt asked for the supply oi 6 civro XIX light transport cum operational aircraft ^ years spares with delivery in April ld46. The manufacturers could not however promise dgiivery before February to April 1947, and in view oi this the Afghan Govt decided to increase their order from 6 to 12 Avrc) XlXs. These aircraft ar: be fitted with machine guns and bomb racks, and will be utilized for operations against the tribes as well as for supply drooping and the tranpsort of passengers and .mail. ; In view of the pog* ibility of tho simultaneous out break of tribal disturbances in the Eastern and Southern i royinces this summer, the Afghan Govt feel that they rnuso be ready to meet such a threat and bridge the i-nod before the arrival of the- new Avro XIXs. They iaye therefore asked the Govt of India to supply them with a sample second hand Hurricane II G aircraft on payment. Although it is realised that the Hurricane is not wholly suitable for use in Afghanistan it is proposed to test out the sample aircraft in Kabul, and should it prove reasonably satisfactory, to place an anything up to 12 second hand Hurricanes E order for a. tpgether with sparesfor 5 years. The sample aircraft will probably be delivered m Kabul about uhe end of ^fey. obsolete and the spares position most difficult. They would like to have a more up to date equivalent of the Hind general purpose aircrait but know that modern tendencies'are all against the manufacture of this type. They hav£ therefore to think m terms of securing the next best and also consider what they c an af.ord to buy and maintain. In trainer aircraft they have probably come to tho wisest d* psion in the purchase of Tiger x^pths, while the proposal 4 to buy 12 Avro XIX aircraft will give the Afghan a-ovt a,fairly economical type of aircraft capable mail t and,passenger services wnenever a main world civil air seryipe is established in Afghanistan- There are certain political,factors which come into the picture over the problem of supplying the Afghan Govt with.Avro IIX aircraft. These are:- iirstly, that a British typo of light transport aircraft will be introduced into the country through the Afghan Air Force, control vail be in^Afghan hands but the advisory ground staff . remaln essentially Britij&amp;f, secondly, that neither the Hussians or the U.S.A. can possibly object to the Afghans developing their own civil air services of a feeder type through thejfghan Air Force,, thirdly, that any future developments in the Air Force will ulti.nately^ react or should advantage by reason of an cstnblishfid nnsif.-inn oi this kind react to our influence we have built up at considerable expense during the last 8 years through the Afghan Govt obtaining the light transport aircraft they require from some other foreign country. zl-i-d • • • • • •Page 3. ► (SO Pira 1 Contd.

The present difficulty may be 4 the offer of the Russian Embassy to transport by this service certain Czech and Yugoslav employees who wish to return to their countries on the expiry of # their ccmtracts. This procecdure from the Afglian Govvs point of view would be equivalent to the authorisation of a Russo-Afghan civil air service in lieu of the existing diplomatic courier air service. .(c) Appendix A to this report gives the number of serviceable aircraft on the strength of the Afghan Air Force on 30th April 1946 and the number of Afghan pilots who are considered to be efficient on the various types of aircraft. These figures will show that the Afghan Air Force is still compelled to seek assistance from one or more foreign sources'in the purchase and maintenance of the aircraft it requires and in training its personnel. (f) The Afghan Govt have during the past six months made various requests for assistance from K.1I.G. or the Govt of India. Gome of the requests have been of a firm nature, w ? hile others have been the usual kind of hints which a poor but proud Govt are inclined to throw out in the hope of securing a favourable reaction.. These requests have included:- (i) a r firm request for the loan of the services of two N.G.O., instructors from the R.A.F. in India for a period of one year. One to teach W/T to officers and N.C.Osof the Air Force and the other tp instruct personnel in the R.A.F. system of storekeeping and issue of spares etc. It is hoped that whose two instructors will r : ach Kabul shortly; (ii) a firm request for the supply of 24 propellers and other essential sprres for British Hind aircraft from England. 10 of these propellers have already been despatched from England; (iii) a firm request for the supply of two 800 gallon petrol tanker lorries f$c&gt;m the Govt of India; somewhat diffident requests for facilities for training Afghan Air Force personnel in India. The numbers mentioned beginning with 20 and ending in 70 or 80 officers and C.Rs. The Afghan Govt realise that they are not in a position to give advancedtrafning to Air Force personnel and that facilities for giving *ab initio 1 training in Kabul arc limited. They therefore hope that the Govt of India will consider sympathetically any ( requests ^tbxggmay make for such training. Should the Govt of India not be prepared to grant these facilities they will turn to the U.S.A. or any other country except possibly Russia for this training, and with the training will follow the purchase of aircraft from the country involved in the training of Afghan Air Force personnel.Para If(iv).

There seems little point in submitting it, but I attach a brief summary of the salient points. The period May-October 1945 was eventful&gt; if not altogether progressive^ for the Afghan Air Force. !*■•. /f performed considerable services in dealing with the dangerous situation in the Kunar Valley principally by strafing the rebels and dropping supplies to the besieged Government Aarrison, but operational needs interfered with the Training and reorganisation prgramme, which was further affected by the death of the Commandant. His successor has no experience of air matters, but is said to be a competent administrator and to have influence with the inner governmental circles. Most of the rest of the Report has been summarised by Y/ing-Commander Taylor in his note on assistance for the Afghan Air Force, copies of which were recently sent to Kabul and India. The features to which he particularly called attention were the large increase in unservicable Hind Aircraft (Paragraph 2(e) and Appendix 'A*) and the unsuitability of the present airfields for use by modem types. (Paragraph 7)* wPage.2 SECHE T. Half Yearly report on to 31st October 1945, the Afghan Air Force for the period 1st May General. i 1. (a) The Afghan Air Force has had a very disturbed half year with many interruptions to it f s programme of training and attempts at rc-organisation. The small Air Force has, however, once more proved it's value in operations against tribesmen and been of considerable assistance to the Government in quelling disturbances in the Kunar valley of the Eastern province. In the period 1st April to 24th Juno normal taougn extremely limited flying training was carried out combined witn a few reconnaissances over Ze.dran territory in Khost in April and i^.y. On 24th Juno four Hind aircraft were despatened to Jalalabad to deal with an outbreak -f Safi and Mohmand disturbances in the Kunar valley, and a further four nind aircraft were sent to Jalalabad on tno 2nd July* Tne disturbances continued until the end of October and the number of aircraft on Jalalabad during the summer and autumn varied between 4 and 10, all of whicn wore Hinds* About 10,000 rounds of machine gun .303' 3#A.A*, 6000 incendiary bombs H.A.F.^type, 1500 R.A.F. type 20 lb bombs, 280 old type Russian 15 Kilo bombs and 11 old type Russian 24 Kilo bombs are believed to have been expended b# the Air Force during those operations. Stocks of bombs, except for a reserve of 300 H.A*F* typr 20 lb bombs in Kabul, were exhausted in August, and appeals were made to the Government of India for further supplies of 20 lb bombs, o:xers being placed in India for 2000 of them* During June and July the. Air Force practised formation flying whonr ever possible for the annual Independence Day Review at the end of July, The Hind aircraft at Jalalabad wore recalled for the review and returned there afterwards. Owing t Lack of practice the standard of formation flying at the review was lower than in previous years. From the end of July to the end of October practically no flying training was carried ^ut in Kabul, this being due to the operations in the Eastern province; the illness and subsequent death of the r,±v Comdt. F.F. Muhd Ihsan Khan; the fast of Ramzan, which occurred in August this year and. a lack of sqrvacoable trainer aircraft. (b) _ F.M.Muhd Ihsan Knan (W.W. 363) , the Comdt. of the Air Force lied on 25•on august. He has been c onnected with tne ^ir Force since / its formation and was regarded as 'Father’ 1 of the present Afghan ^ir Force* He will be missed in many directions and though he was not in tne inner circles of the Government ;r on very good terms with the Minister of Defence, ne has always had tne interests of his command at heart ann did his best L. imp.ove its efficiency in spit.; of a lack of money.

The British Hinds have been extensively used for tribal operations in 1945 and have given good service 'vor a period 'f 8 years.

The British instructors have worked'hard on maintaining these Hinds a n d the fa c t remain fit f ' i recti on. The task of maintaining the Hinds is however becoming increasingly difficult owing to lack 'f spares, and there is no doubt that if the Afghan air force is to retain its usefulness in internal security mities more operational aircraft must be purchased during the next year or so, Tne ^f p;an Gev«rnment rare ai7»,are of tiro position and navo made several tentative enquiries about vari ous types f British operati ;nal aircraft such as Hurricane C II, tne Fairey Firefly, and the Defiant, but have n A yet f ,und the General Purpose best suited for their rcquiicmcnts which remain as described in paragraph; 1 (d) of my Half Yearly Report f or tne period ending 30th April .i.945. A later suggestion put forwaru by i*ir n.^. , Inmia. is tnat the Afghan Government might consider purchasing 2 or 3 Avro Anson Nc.l9 for use as light transport aircraft and also utilize them for operations against nos tile tribal forces* (e) In Septonbor the ^fghan Government made an official request for the supply of two light transport aircraft for carrying 5 to 8 passengers and.mail. This enquiry has been passed on to the Government of India for necessary action. Should this type of aire craft be supplied the Afghan Government propose to use thorn for inaugurating small postal cum passenger services between Kabul and provincial towns,for transporting military officers and for supplies to troops besieged in f aircraft wculd be on the charge F'jrce.

(f) The ...fghan Government’s attitude towards the develop ment of civil aviation in Afghanistan is still undefined though they have strenuously resisted Russian attempts to use tne Knwaja Ra.wash airfield for their diplomatic courier air service, and insisted on the use of the 3 her pur airfield by thm D.C. 47 aircraft introduced on this service in April las,,. The Sherpui’ airfield is too small for the D.C. 47 to take off with safety and the Afghan Government have suggested to the Russian Lmbassy tne use A a smaller aircraft.

Muhd Ihsan Khan who wp*s in India for medical treatment from November until March, and weather conditions which made the Sherpur and Khwaja Rawash airfields unfit for use from early January until the end of March 0 Very little flying training we*s carried out in Kabul between 1st November and the early part of January, none between 6th January and 15th April, and only two short training flights of 30 minutes duration per pilot between the 15th^and 30th of April. Five Hind aircraft and the Flying Training School left Kabul for Jalalabad on 6th January, and all the aircraft except one which force landed near Mazar-i- Sharif on 6th April had returned to Kabul by 8th April. While at Jalalabad the Hind aircraft carried out fortnightly reconnaisances over the Khost district presumably with the object of ascertaining whether there were any unusual movements of tribesmen connected with the hostile tribal leader Mazrak Zadran , and to remind the tribesmen that the Govt were watching the situation 9 No air operations were carried out during the period under report# * (b) The British pilot instructor reports that many of the Hind aircraft are in need of extensive overhauls, but that a shortage of engiiie and other spares is delaying the work c There was only one accident to Hind aircraft during ‘the past six^months due to a forced landing near Mazar-i-Sharif on 6th April, but the aircraft is stated to be repairable® Italian Romeo and Breda aircraft are almost out of commission owing to a lack of spares, and though two or three of the Romeo’s are being flown alternately, Afghan pilots and the Air Commandant appear to be unable to decide whether it would bo adVisab3.e to repair them or scrap them altogether. The American Stearman trainer, a P.T. 17 lias boon overhauled and tested, but has now been returned^to store. Appendix f A ! to this report gives the number/pf trained or partly trained pilots in the Afghan Air Force on 30th April 1945. /and condition of aircraft and the number (c) The Tiger Moth aircraft sent to Kabul for test in toy 1944 returned to Peshawar on 13th December. The delay in returning the aircraft was due to the -difficulty of obtaining a. spare propeller from India to replace the one which broke off in midair during test on September 3rd 1944. The accident produced a crop of reports from Afghan air force officers some of whom alleged that the propellers of the Tiger Moth type of aircraft made a habit of coming off in midair. The Afghan Govt called for further* reports on the Tiger Moth, and Uiis has caused delay in reaching a decision regarding the purchase of 6 to 8 of them. Early in April the Air Commandant asked the Military Attache’^wnether 8 Tiger Moths could be made available for sale from India or England together with suffieient spares for two years. The enquiry has been passed on to the Govt of India, (d) The tour of the Afghan Military Mission in India during December and January aroused a certain amount of interest in Air Force circles® An Afghan pilot officer accompanied the Mission but he does not appear to have found the typo of general purpose aircraft suit Afghan I'equirements.

The American air transport ^ service in India also came in for a certain amount of appreciation© Afghan officers have continued to talk of th%ir desire Lpuybosc to purchase trainer aircraft, and some type of General/Saxvia® aircraft to replace the obsolete Hinds, Romeos and Brodas# The Tiger Moth receives most attention as a suitable trainer aircraft, and the Harvard, Hurricane and the Fa.iry Firefly are mentioned as possible types for th« G,P. aircraft required to meet Afghan requirements c °f 10, British Inotiuctors, Mr, H. Bradleyn Messrs Hawkers fitter and rigger instruct or who has been employed by the Afghan Govt since December 1937 was 'dismissed for disciplinary reasons in April and loft Kabul for India on route to England on April 22nd* Mr, Bradley had had differences of opinion with Sqdn, Leader B,M, King during the winter months, and on March 8th this culminated in an unprovoked assault on S/L King in a hanger on the Shejrpur airfield in the presence of Afghan officers and mochanics, S/L King was rendered unconscious, and after regaining consciousness was then thrown out of the hanger by Mr, Bradley, The affair was reported to the Legation by both sides, and the case was taken up with the Ministry of Defence and Ministry of Foreign Affairs who decided to suspend Mr, Bradley pending further investigation and report by the Afghan air force authorities- As is usual in such cases in Eastern countries the Afghan authorities included a number of other charges against Mr© Bradley in their report on this affair, and the Ministry of Defence and Ministry for Foreign Affa.irs wore advised by the Legation to confine their enquiries to this particular incident and , oo let the Legation know wha.t auction they proposed to take regarding the affair. The Ministry of Defence decided that Mr. Bradley had committed a serious offence which, had the assault bpen mo.de on an Afghan officer, would have resulted in his being sentenced to several years imprisonments Later the Ministry for Foreign Affairs intimated- that they had decided to dismiss Mr, Bradley for disciplinary reasons ? but tpat in view of .his past good record and valuable services he would be given the cost of a passage to England and pay for a certain period* Mr, Bradley was eventually given 3 months pay in lieu of notice. This incident was hushed up as far as possible and both S/L King and Mr, Bradley were warned that no mention of the affair was to be made to foreigners in Kabul* These efforts were successful and there was remarkable little talk about the incident amongst foreigners, and British prestige does not appear to have suffered,, The affair did however arouse a great deal of comment amongst Afghan air force personnel* and suggestions were made by Afghan air force officers that, the air force was now.capable of maintaining its aircraft without the assistance of foreigners, particularly quarrelsome ones. This is certainly not the case, and it is believed that these a.ir force officers Have since realised that they ca.nnot do without the help of foreign instructors. It is therefore hoped that British prestige in the Afghan air force • which has ^always been higa, will not be affected by this unfortumte incident* Signs tha.t this is the ca.se are borne out by a request by the Afghan Govt for a replacement for Mr, Bradley from England,, and. ah enquiry from the Comdt. of the Air Force as to whether an observer from the R, A.

The Flying Training School has been more fortunate in securing flying training, and 8 out of the 9 students completed their training and were passed out as pilots at the end of the quarter after having carried out 140 hours flying training during a period of two years. (c) The health of the Commandant F.M. Muhd Ihsan Khan has shown no improvement, and his continued absence has led to a date: ioration in the administration of the A;; - Force, and delay in the selection of officers whom th Afghan Govt wish to send to India for initial and advanced flying training under the Royal Air Force. There nave been no further overt signs of discontent amongst Afghan officers of the Air Force, and. it would appear that the Minister of Defence has dealt with tneir complaints tactfully and that botn the officers and tne Ministry of Defence wish to avoid bringing matters to a head. A number of officers nowever still complain about their conditions of service, tne officers employed in tne worksnops being tne worst offenders, and tnsy show their resentment by absenting tnemselves from work witnout permission® No officers of tne Air Force nave so far been retired on the new pension regulations introduced for the Army and Air Force though tne C.G.S. has given hints to the Military Attache* that the Ministry of Defence intend to pension off or find other employment for a number of the older officers in the Air Force and replace them by young officers.

It is however possible tnat its departure may be further delayed by a domestic event in the family of ^ne Bntisn pilot instructor* * 4 * The unfortunate accident to tne iiger ^xo^n div. not at first affect Afghan opinion as to its suitability for use as a trainer in Kabul, but later a few oxficers in the air force appear to have been successful in grousing suspicions in higher circles about the capabilities of the Tiger Moth, and tms has caused delay in securing a final decision from the Afghan Govt as ^0 the number' of Tiger Moth aircraft they wish to purchase* At the end of October the Ministry of Defence stated that they still wished to purchase 6 to 8 Tiger Moth aircraft, and that once the prope3.1er position had beeh clearea up they would communicate taeir final lecision to the Legation* (e) The ^fga-ian Govt are still desirous of purCiiasing aircraft to replace the almost useless Italian Rome^ s and add to the number of serviceable operational aixcraxt in their possession, but it is likely that they will postpone a decision until after tne Afghan Military Mission has concluded its visit to India in January 1945• Afghan air force officers still snow interest in tne Hurricane type of aircraft, but a. suggestion made by the Britisn instructors that the British Henley aircraft mignt suit Afghan requirements was received coldly on tne^ground that it was now almost obsolete. Hints were given in October to the Ministry of Defence that the Britisn Swordfish aircraft mignt be suitable for use in Afghanistan -U-t a reply was given to the effect tnat the Swordfisn witn a ceiling of 12,000® with a full loan woulci not — e capa.ble of crossing the Hindu Kush mountains and tnat for Afghanistan an aircraft with a ceiling of approximately 20,000* was essential. (d) Since the question of alleged American approaches to the Afghan authorities for creating an interest in rvf nimraft was taken up with the American he.v« been authorities for creating American types of aircraft was taken up with the American Legation no further instance of such approaches reported. (y) The Afghan Govt, and the military^and^air force, authorities have been taking an interest in civil aviation and in the Conference on \vcrld Vide Civil Aviation wmcii is to be neld at Washington in November. Interest on the part of the military and air force authorities is at present slight, but it is known that tne x-ifgnan Govt wish to ^ develope a. civil air force of tneir own after tne war f 'j- the purpose of conveying rra ils and occasionally passengers from Kabul to provincial headquarters towns. Tne majority ef young Afghan officia.ls are a^lso keen on having civil air services liiaking Kabul with va.rious f oreign c-juntries. It is therefore probable that the Afghan Govt^wouid like to have a service from Teheran to Kabul and possibly on to^ India, but tneir real difficulty in this question lies m tneir reluctance to grant facilities for a regular air service from Russia to Kabul since they realise that it would not be wise to grant facilities for^air services fr m jfidia or Persia to Kabul while rex using similar facilities to theii Northern neighbour.-Arp. 1 (::) contcU XXX • 4 Tne present privets Russian air service froiii Tashkent to Kabul nas toe use of tne Siierpur airfield for its aircraft wnich noxmaliy make the journey every 10 or 14 oays. Recently the obsolete P.5 aircraft on this service nas been making the trip less frequently, and according to rumour tne Russians intend to place a Douglas C.3. aircraft into commission and use the Khwaja Ra.wash airfield. Tne i.fgnan Govt do not at present allow Russian aircraft to purchase aviation petrol from them or permit aircraft to land places other tioa.n Ka.bul or allow the Russians to maintain ground staffs in Ka.bul or elsewhere. The whole object of | r the Afghan Govt being apparently to keep the Russians in tne air since they fea.r that the establishment of grouna stalls at Mazar-i-Sharif, Kha.nabad or Ka^bul would lead to a^ spread of Russian propaganda and communistic doctrines in^the country Whatever'developments do eventually occur in the field of civil a.via.tion in Afghanistan they cannot be witnout some effect on the Afghan air force. Should for example an American, British. French or Italian controJ-led civil otir service be established from V/est to East it will involve the nuaintenance of grouno. sta.ffs, workshops, radio location and W/T instaJ-lations etc. at places like Herat, Kanaanai ^ or Kabul and one country providing these facilities for civil aviation would gradually a.cquire an influence in one Afghan air force through tne presence in toe country of its aircraxt, ]j ground personneh*workshops ano insta.llations etc. i There would also oe a tendency foi' Afgha-nistan to purchase her military aircraft from the country which provides her with a civil air service or is jointly concerned with the Afghan Govt in providing such a service. All existing airfields in Afghanistan are controlled by the Ministry ox Defence, and there are no airfields allotted to civil use at present.

T’a/o Hind aircraft are undergoing lengthy repairs and rebuilding, and five more Hind aircraft are in the workshops for repairs of short duration. The Britisn instructors report that the standard of maintenance iias dropped slightly, due not to a shortage of spares but to the difficulty of extracting them from the Afghan Customs department after delivery from India. _ The absence of the domdt of the ^ir Aorce owing to r^-L health is stated to be tne reason for tne non release of tne spares by tae Customs authorities * Tne Ministry of Defence nave been approacned end have promisee to secure the early release of the spares 0 (f) b.T Saction f lorry sent to Gardez in April this year The * ..— c — - returned to Kabul at the end of September.

The discontent amongst officers of the Air Force reported last quarter has been less evident recently* Dissatisfaction with conditions of service however continues to be expressed* and the British instructors report that some of the officers in the workshops are frequently absent without leave and that no disciplinary action is taken by the officiating Comdt. G.M. Muhd Kashin Khan against these officers^ The ill health of the Comdt. F.M. Muhd Ihsan Khan is regretted by the British instructors who state that during nis absence from duty discipline in the Air force nas deteriorated, and that it has become increasingly difficult to obtain decisions on administrative a n d training p r obiems.page VI. 10 • Political Tenf 9nci.es amongst officers of t he Air Force . The majority of the officers are pleased that * the end of the war in Euroo* is in sight as they realise that until the war is over they cannot secure new air craft and^ equipment* There has been less talk on the Sherpur air field about buying new aircraft, though references have been made to the need for Tiger Moth trainer aircraft and disappointment was expressed when officers learnt tnat a hurricane C. II aircraft would not be sent to Kabul for demonstration purposes. Fear of Russia is still prevalent amongst Afghan officers and the British instructors report tnat the question most frequently put to taem is ” when will the British and Americans realise tnat Russia is a danger to all small countries in Europe and Asia and begin to take action to counter Russian aims in the Balkans, the Mediteranean and the Near East ,T * Military Attache 1 #SECRET.

Secretary of State / / ——————* a.a/ /y Committee / Under Secretary Secretary of State / L • Perusal / I FOR USE BY DEPARTMENT ONLY. Six Hawker Hinds were used for a large variety of purposes during the Khost disturbances, including shooting-up hostile tribesmen and dropping leaflets. With respect to the personnel of the small Air Force, the British-trained contingent has evinced considerable dissatisfaction over terms of service, while the serious illness of the Commandant, Fir qua Ivlishar MuhA. Ishan Khan, has brought to the notice of the Government the serious lack of possible successors. Of particular interest is the information regarding the attitude of the Afghans to the various types of British aircraft offered to them. They insist on a two-seater, general- purpose aircraft with a high ceilingj for this reason they are not interested in Hurricanes, but Squadron Leader (now Y/ing Commander) King, the Pilot Instructor, suggests that the Henley might meet these requirements. (Since this report was written, the legation has been informed that Swordfish might be suitable, and can be made available, but some delay in the Afghan reply to this proposal is anticipated).

Wing Commander King*s report on the Tiger Moth, which he tested with a view to ascertaining its merits as a trainer under Kabul conditions, is attached and is very favourable. It has made a good impression both on the Afghan pilots and their Government, who state that they will require some six or eight of this type if they can be made available. The good impression made on the Afghan pilots by the Tiger Moth (which some of them tested) is held partly responsible for the changeover in favour from U.S. to British aircraft. This may also be ascribed to the correct attitude of the U.S. legation since the departure of Major Enders, the late Military Attache. The suggestion, tentative though it is, for the training of some Afghan airmen in India is a good sign of the maintenance of our influence over the Afghan Air Force. We have now heard that trie Afghan Grovernnent are not interested in the Swordfish aircraft, since their ceiling is not sufficiently high. As for the Tiger Moth, the Afghans were slightly disconcerted when they heard that its propeller came adrift on the home;vard flight to India. It has been explained to them that the mishap was caused by the faulty adjustment of a retaining screw and was due to no structural defect, and it is to be hoped that this explanation will allay their fears. (The aeroplane made a perfect landing without the propeller). The report states that it is now unlikely that the Afghans will reach a decision on the type of aircraft they desire until the Air Force officer, attached to the Afghan Military Mission, v/hich is due to go to India in December, reports to them. In the meantime, it is ft ft** encouraging to note their desire to retain British instructors in their Air Force. i/uFile Nos :— — Submitted to :— Subject.

King Pilot Ins true oor to tne TTf^han ^lr Force * X was present in the aircraft throughout all the triala carried out by pilots of the aoyal Afghan Air Force# I also carried out a few trials myself. I was very pleased with the performance of this aircraft here in Kabul (Height 6000 feet) and,in my opinion, not only did it pass all its trials satisfactorily, but also main* tained its hi^i standard of efficiency in the air and on the ground as attained at much lower altitudes# I found that the take-off run was approximately four to five hundred yards in 12 to 15 seconds according to the individual pilot. Initial climb to 200 feet was goo in the cool air but I detected a slight decrease in this rate of climb from about 9*30 onwards when the ground temperature was reason ably high, however the climb ms still satisfactory in my opinion# A height climb to 16000 feet above sea level (I.E.10.000 feet abovo Kabul; was carried out in 38 minutes and the aircraft was still climbing at this altitude. I estimated that its ceiling with two pilots and normal load, as flown during trials, to be something in the region of 17,000 tOGl7*50(* fee* abovl dSaE16^.f8p4e^tar(iaIa:^W carried out'at 9,000 feet above sea level (I«E, 3000 feet above Kabul) At full throttle the indicated air speed was 86 miles per hour which, when corrected for height of 9000 feet above sea level, gives a true air speed reading of 96.8 m.p.h# (H.B, The correction factor is approximately Plus 1.2 m.p.h. for every 1,000 feet above sea level. Normal cruising at two thirds throttle gave an indicated air speed of 78 m.p.h. that is to say a true air speed of 88.8 m.p.h. Various types of stall were tried out and in every case the stall ms gentle and straightforward, the aircraft quickly regaining stability again of ita own accord on reaching flying speed once again# There waa absolutely no tendency to drop a wing or go into a spin# However with the automatic slots in the locked position the aircraft did go into a spin from an intentional stall off a steep gliding turn, which was to be expected. Afghan pilots only carried out loops and spins during trials, out I put the aix craft through the full range and found that she able to perform all the maneouvres satisfactorily# I noticed that a spin to the right was just a little faster than that to the but in both cases it was very gentle and certainly no faster than that of the Hind. Recovery was quick and positive, with sniy approxi mately 500 feet of altitude being lost in a spin of froi* 5 to b turns, accurate petrol consumption trials could not be carried out# owing to lack of accurate liquid measures^ However such, checks as could be made showed the consumption at fu3.1 throttle to* be approxi mately 9 gallons per hour. At 'two thirds throttle the fi.gure was about 5^ gallons. On the height Climb test flight, whicii included^ some 20 minutes general flying and lasted for 1 hour, onily { of petrol was consumed. Oil consumption throughout the t#riais nas been approximately 1 pint per hour. Conclusions. My unbiased opinion of the Tiger Moth ^^ T JL aircraft for tirainin^.

(d) Easy to fly, having no vices. ! (e) Fully aerobatic Cf) Take-off and climb are both good at this altitude. (g) Its high ceiling and good range make it possible to fly to and operate from any of the Aerodromes in the country. (h) Can be used for bombing operations if required. (i) Flying characteristics are almost identical to those of the Hind taking into consideration the difference in engine power.Since the attached Report was written some of the Afghan Air Force has been used for operations in the Southern Province against Mazrak, the rebel Zadraiu Points of interest in the Report are the fact that the Hind spares position has improved, and that Italian influence seems to be practically eliminated from the Air Force, although there are still a few Italian aircraft serviceable. (\7e are trying to get two Piaggio Engines to fit the Romeos, but the Air Ministry have misled us about the type available, and it is taking some time to sort out the muddle). The lack of spare parts for the Hind machines -which we sold to the Afghans some few years back has caused us some concern, for the Hind aircraft were declared obsolete by the Air Ministry last year, and we felt a certain responsibility to the Afghans for helping to prolong the life of these old machines* It seems that our efforts have achieved some result, and spares have now been received. Even though propped up with spares,the Hind^alas f cannot last for more than a few years, and we are having great difficulty in suiting the Afghan Government with sufficiently modem yet not too expensive aircraft. We have tried them unsuccessfully with Audax, (a very old 'type which was available in India) Master Trainer Aircraft, and second-hand Hurricanes. All these are unacceptable. Apparently they desire a two seater general purpose air craft, and we have asked the Air Ministry if they have any ideas as to something suitable and available. The latter, however, are not too sanguine about having anything which answers this description. If the Afghan Government would only wait until the end of the War there will no doubt be many modem types of aircraft at easy prices for sale to them, but they seem to have set their heart on having something new soon, and no doubt their pilots encourage this desire. It will be a great pity if they turn to the U.3.A. for help. The Afghan Air Force is trained by a Britith pilot instructor, and British mechanics, and I think that we should make every effort to see that the Afghans spend their money on something British. American aircraft will no doubt mean American trainers.

(a) There has been very little activity in the Afghan Air Force during^the quarter under review. This is partly due to climate conditions in Kabul being unfavourable for flying training, and partly to the absence of F.M. Muhd Ihsan Khan, the Air Commandant, from Kabul. The Flying Training School moved from Kabul to.Jalalabad early in December for the winter months. Two Hind (dual) aircraft, one Hind aircraft cquipp&amp;dfor operations, and one Breda trainer aircraft were despatched wion one senool to Jalalabad. The air Commandant proceeded oo Jalalaba.d at tne end of November, and is to stay tnere for tno winter. His hoaitn is still poor, and ne probably seized tno opportunity of spending tne winter in a warmer climate after arranging for tne Flying Training School to be stationed at Jralalabad* He continues to command tne ^ir Force in Kabul, and issues nis or .. rs by telephone or letter. Tnere nave been rumours to tne effect tn. t ne is to be replaced as ^iir Commandant by a senior army officer, but tnore is no confirmation that such a change is contem plated. (b) The Chief of the General Staff nas informed Attacno that tney do not wisn eo purchase any of tue aircraft whicn wore offered to them by His Majesty's the Military 'iyja.ster' type of Government at a in lieu of the 9 reasonable price, for delivery within 9 to 12 months, second hand Hind aircraft which the Afghan Govt, originally wished to buy. No particular reason was given for the refusal of the offer, but there was a hint to the effect that this type of aircraft was considered unsuitable for use in Afghanistan. No definite reply nas so far been given regarding the offer to supply 9 sec on: be e and the the Air aircraft hand Audax aircraft from India at break UTD I- value. There have n conflicting reports concerning the reactions of the Air Commandant officers of the ^ir F^rce t) this offer, one version being that Commandant had refused the offer on the grounds that Audax and of little use in Afghanistan, the other were bsoletv version being that tne nir Commandant wished to purchase them for use as trainer aircraft.

Tne British instruct ..rs however report that they still show some dislike for anl fear of Russia« Italians continue to be tespised. Some pro-Axis propoganda nas come to notice in the Afghan ^ir Force luring the quarter, and certain German war photographs have been dis tributed to Afghan officers under tnc guise of flying training photo graphs . f ' The visits of Major General P. Hurley, President Roosevelt's representative, and Mr. Eric Beecroft of the U.5.A. Foricgn Board in January, arouse d considerable interest, and a great speculation amongst officers in the air force. Many Afghan special Economic oeal of officers h /of C f /P e c &gt; \ \P H T&lt; \\ thought that the U.S.a. would be asked to supply new aircraft to Afghanistan, and this supposition was reinforced when they found that r ' ^ Mr. Beocroft was making enquiries about the situation in the Afghan air force regarding aircraft, aircraft spares and equipment, W/T equipment, and about financial and economic conditions in the country,! 3&gt; rffiPOrCT ON Tnnj ■dFanAN Alxi FOKGiii FOjH tCxli^ £-jriIQD Pst&gt; AUGUST t&gt;o 15i&gt;h NO&lt; lp4:3» General, 6 ^ (a) Between tile 1st, of August and tne Independence Day Review on August 23rd there was tne usual activity designed to improve the standard of formation flying, 21 Hind aircraft and 7 Romeo aircraft took part in review of the Kabul garrison by King Zahir Shah, the standard of formation flying showing a slight improvement over previous years. After the Independence Celebrations no flying training was carried out for two weeks, and during the remainder of the period under report training has been carried out somewhat spasmodically owing to changes in the British instructional staff, accidents, and the attitude of the Air Commandant concerning the expenditure of aviation petrol. (b) The number of serviceable aircraft available has been further reduced by accidents, and the Air Commandant has shown some concern re- gar ling the situation. On 15th November the position was as follows British Hind aircraft. Italian Romeo aircraft. Italian Breda Trainer Aircraft. r w la Serviceable 2 (long flights) Serviceable 4 (Snort flights) Repairable 8 written'off 2 . • ' 16 '(c) Tne Air Commandant and officers of tne Afgnan Air Force have made frequent enquiries during tne summer, regarding the possibility of’their being supplied with 9 additional secondhand Hind aircraft from Great Britain or India. Tne request for tne supply of these aircraft was made in March, and early in October the Afghan Government was informed that Hind aircraft were now regarded as obsolete, and none were available for sale. Later, in November, an offer to supply Audax aircraft from India at breakup value was made, or alternatively to supply n Master M aircraft from Great Britain at a reasonable price, for delivery, within 9 to 12 montns. The reactions of the Afghan Government, or the Air Commandant, to this offer are not yet known, but it is probable that in view of their desire to conserve their existing Hind aircraft for internal security operational purposes, and to obtain some trainer aircraft for training student pilots in Kabul, they may be prepared to accept Audax or Hart aircraft for use as trainer aircraft,' and as a stop-gap to tide them over a period. There is little doubt that the Air Commandant and officers of the Afghan Air Force will be disappointed if the Afghan Govt, decide to purchase Audax or Hart aircraft, as these types are.older that the Hind aircraft already in thcii possession. The Air Commandnnt does however realise the difficulties of obtaining the 'General Purpose' type of aircraft he requires, and is perhaps prepared to accept wnat is offered and to hope that more modern aircraft of some kind or anotn jt will become available at tne end of the war, (d) In August tne Afghan Government made enquiries as to whether a 'Tiger Moth' trainer aircraft could be made available for sale from India, and if so at wnat price. Tnis aircraft was required for train ing pilots in Kabul, The enquiry was referred to tne Government of India, but it is not yet known whether tnis aircraft can be made available for sale, (e) There have been one major and three minor accidents to aircraft during the period und^r review. Tne major accident resulted in a Hind aircraft being damaged beyond repair and the pilot and observer being killed. The three minor accidents involved damage to one Hind, one Romeo and one Breda aircraft, but all are repairable. (f) The Hind spares position has again improved owing to the arrival or expected arrival of spares from India. The Afghan Govt, have madd a request for the supply of spares for Italian Romeo aircraft from stocks, which they presume have been captured in North Africa and Italy by the British army, and it is understood that some of these spares may become available in the near future.

Hind Squadrons . (a) Flying a ours. Up to the beginning of October Afghan pilots wore allowed to carry out short training flights in the vicinity of Kabul of 25 t 3 45 minutes per pilot p-r week. During October and the first half of November pilots were given training in cross country flying, the flights being of l-- hours duration. This form ;f training was introduced by the British pilot instructor, but an accident on 15th November, resulting in th: death of a pilot and obs . rver and the total loss of a Hind aircraft, has caused a cessation of the experiment, and flying training has again been limited to 45 minutes per pilot per week. (b) Operations, - Nil. One Hind aircraft is believed to have carried out a reconnaissance in the Southern Province on 9th and 10th November. This aircraft landed at Ghazni on 9th November, and after spending the night there ieturned to Kabul on 10th November. (c) Standard of Flying; Efficiency. No change to report. The new British I pilot instructor states that from what he has seen of Afghan pilots since ! his arrival, about half of them .ave reached a reasonable standard of flying efficiency as compared with present day standards in England, but I tne remaining half are below standard or are bad pilots. (d) Accidents. (i) A Hind aircraft was damaged when landing in Kabul in September, but is repairable. (ii) On 9m November a nind aircraft crasaod in tne Logar valley 25 miles South of Kabul and became a total loss. The Afgnan pilot and observer were killed. The' accident was due to low flying contrary to orders, and the aircraft ran into a small hill. Afgnan officers in tne salvage party found that the local innabitants in the Musai area of the Logar valley were unfriendly and uniffsipful, even to the extent of refusing to supply them with food and accommodation. (e) Maintenance. The Hind spares position has improved and the arrival of Mr. H. Pearson, Messrs Rolls Royce mechanic, from England, has result ed in more attention being paid to the care and maintenance of engines. (f) Photographic Section quarter. There have been no.developments during the (g) U/T Section (i) The V/T lorry has remained in store. (ii) The equipment of the D/F Station at Sherpur has been taken over from the German Legation, but has not been put into operation, or have any further tests between Kabul-, Herat and Berlin taken place. There is an Air Force officer at Herat in cnarge of the W/T and D/F _station there, but so far as is known nis sole duties are tne care and maintenance of ; _: ’: A 71 a nd B /F i :• r i pme nt.3 I DM (h) Army Go-operation* Nil. 3.

(el ivia into nance, (i) Italian test bed equipment for Romeo engines has been erected by th* British instructors, and two Romeo engines nave been overhauled and are ready for test. (ii) The Afghan Govt, nave asked for tn- supply of spares for Italian Aomn aircraft from steros captured by Britisn forces in North Africa and Itaj.y. It is understood that some jf tnese me.y become available. 4. Italian Breda Ti ! ainer Aircraft. (i) Only one Breda aircraft remains serviceable, and even the condition of this aircraft is regarded as doubtful. There is however one new Breda aircraft in store which has never been used. The British instructors consider that with .one exception, all the Breda aircraft are now thoroughly unreliable and unsafe for flying. (ii) One Breda aircraft was damaged through faulty landings on two occasi -ns during the quarter, but is repairable. 5. F1 yi ng Tra ini no: 5 ch : 1 . (i) There are S student pilots and 9 mechanics under training. The training of the pilots is making slow progress due to a shortage of suitable trainer aircraft. The students are given approximately B^hours flying training per week and have now reached a total of 28 hours flying per student. 7~of the pupils are flying solo, but 2 of them are still flying dual. (ii) The Flying Training School is to proceed to Jalalabad early in December for tne winter montns• Owing to tne baa condition o± the Breda trainers, it is believed that three Hind aircraft will be sent to^ Jalalabad for training purposes. T.M. Abdur Aa&amp;aq Khan will be in charge of tne School and no British instructors will be posted to Jalalabad. 6. Airfields. (a) . S,h^rpur. . Two new bomb stores are being constructed on the west end ol the. Bimaru hill, nortn of the present headquarters of the Air Force. (b) Khwa.ia Rawash Progress in the construction of hangers, workshops and offices is slow, owing to a lack of cement and other materials. Work on a drainage scheme on land to the north and northeast of the airfield has commenced under the auspices of the Ministry of Public Works. It is anticipated that when this has been completed the airfield will be less liable to become water-logged during the spring and winter months. • ( c ) Mazar-i-Sharif # J n Two petrol ta.nks have been installed on the airfield. The tanks are said to have been transferred from some civil petrol store, but their capacity is not known. It is stated that these tanks have not been filled with patrol so far.- 4 - 6. (contd) (d) IChanabad, In October this airfield was covered with rough grass, and noinads were using it as a camping ground. The unroofed wall bays to shelter two aircraft were occupied by teashops. (e) Herat ^ In October Lhis airfield was covered with rougn grass and snowed no signs of use. Tne airfield is nowever well marked out with corner pillars and white' angles. Off ice 1 buildings, stores and V/T office nave been completed and are situated at the North Vest corner of tne airfield. Hangars arc und_r construction and V/T masts have been erected. Tneio is a guard at tn- airfield, and an Air force officer in cnarge of tne T w/T station, Tne airfield is connected witn nerat by telephone. 7. Aviation Petrol. (a) No. aviation petrol aas been sent from Kabul to the provinces during tne quarter. (b) The stocks of pjtrol on the Snerpur and Khwaja Hawash airfields show a slight decrease due to more flying training having been carried out. It is anticipated that stocks wall increase to their previous level during the ensuing winter. (c) Tne 10,000 gallons of petrol on the Sherpur airfield which has lost its octane value, is now being issu:d for use by Breda trainer aircraft. 8. British Instructors . (a) Squadron-Leader B.F. King, A.F.C., H.A.F., arrived in Kabul from England on 1st October, and has taken over the duties of pilot instructor to the Afghan Air Force from Squadron-Leader B.D. vigginton, H.A.F., whose contract had expired. The Chief of tne General Staff informed the /&amp; kl* Military Attache’ that he hoped that Squadron-Leader King will be prepared ^'v^to stay on f or a longlr ^liiia than cnc y-Jar, as frequent changes in 6 British instructional personnel was not conducive., to efficiency, and Afghan i gir Force officers felt that as so^n as tn^y nad become acquainted with a particular Pilot instructor was changed. (b) Mr. H. Pearson, Messrs Rolls Royce mecnanic, arrived in Kabul on 8th September. His presence was urgently required as since tne depart ure of Mr. D.V.R. Robinson in March tnis year, the care and maintenance of engines nad shown some deterioration. &gt;—* 9• T heft or .003 S.A.A. In September a snortage of 3000 rounds of S.A.A* from the store of tne Snerpur aerodrome was discovered. The Chief storekeeper, Mund Mizan Khan, was arrested, and has been confined to prison. The S.A»A. has not been recovered and he is being fined the sum of Rs.10 Afghani per round for all rounds not returned to store. 10. Release of British aircraft which force-landed in Afghanistan. ' ■ Officers of the Afghan Air Force expressed some surprise when they learnt that the Afghan Govt, ha1 decided to release the British pilot and observer who force-landed in Afgnan territory m 30th June, and to arrange for the r.turn of the aircraft to Iniia. Those officers who were trained by the R.A.F. in Karachi were pleased about this development, but others who were trained in Italy or arc pro-Axis in their sympathies were inclined to criticize the decision. 11, U.S.A. Stcarman Trainer Aircraft. Tnis aircraft has been retained in store, and nas n.t so far been utilized for training student pilots in spite of the fact tnat trainer aircraft are urgently needed.12. Political tinl^nci^s amongst officers of the Afghan Air F3rce« Ths British instrucLsrs rsp^rt tnat officers of the Afghan Air Force are strongly nationalist in their political views. The younger officers, particularly tnose wne have been trained in In^ia, favour an Allied vict ory, ani almost all of them woula like to be sent to In_da, Englan^ or America for training snould an opportunity present itself. There is still a little pro-Axis sentiment amongst those officers wno nave been trained in It' .y and France, but some disgust with Italy has been expressed, one officer making tne remark tnat Italy has lost ner colonies, then ner country and now ner honour. Almost all officers in the ^ir Force nave an intense dislike for,and fbar of Russia. APPENDIX M A M .

The new Rolls Royce mechanic, Mr. Pearson, • has now arrived in Kabul, and Squadron Leader King is on his way. Squadron Leader Wigginton seems to have done good v/ork with the Air Porce, and it is a pity that he did not want to stay longer than a year. Squadron Leader King, who lias good recomuendations from the Air Ministry, has, however, undertaken to stay two year’s if desired.

Muhd Ihsan Khan ^(W, r; r*3.63), since his return from leave in India in Ivlarch, has continued o show initiative and energy in his efforts to improve the efficiency .of the Air Force. The Commandant,: who was largely responsible for the request made by the Afghan Government in March for the supply of more -second-hand Kind aircraft from Great Britain, is beginning to show anxiety as^to whether these additional aircraft can be supplied. Other officers in the Afghan nir‘Force who apparently know that this request was made, have been sounding the British instructors regarding the prospects of tneir obtaining these additional aircraft from Great Britain. The Afghan Chief of the General Staff has also made enquiries from tne Military Attache’ during tne past two months as to whatner a reply has been received from His Kaj-sty’s Government on this it woula appear that there is a general desire in the Air Force to ^increase the number of serviceable aircraft available, to about 36, and a vague nope tnat should tne supply of- second-hand Hind aircraft not materialize subject* Ip another type of aircraft with a similar or improved rformance YJill be supplied* Tne number of serviceable Hind aircraft capable of being used for internal security operations at present is only 21, as 5 Hind aircraft are in the workshops for repairs, and the.'i’sw • remaining serviceable Italian Romeo airera cannot tako off ^ altitudes• ft are unfi o f or • us,e for tnis purpose because tn a full war load from airfields with high ne Commandant and his officers still desire to scrap the Italian Romeo aircraft, but wall repair and utilize them where possible. they (b) At the end of June it was found that stocks of aviation petrol on the Sherpur airfield had been rsduced by some 2000 gallons owing to the increased flying training facilities authorised in April. The Commandant therefore issued orders curtailing flying training from S to 2 hours per pilot per month in order to recover the extra expenditure and build up the reserve of petrol to its former level. Practice in formation flying for the Independence Day Review to be held at the end of August began tally in July, and it is anticipated that 21 Hind and 7 Romeo aircraft will be available for the occasion. ' (c) ^ S/L 3.D. Y/igginton, R.A.F., is still responsible for all f flying training carried out, and reports mat there is an increased tendency to rely on him for advice on all matters concerning the.Air Force* On occasions he has also been placed in actual cnarge of I Squadr ons • (d) The nind spares position has improved owing to the arrival from India of items urgently requirta, but a shortage of metal tubing . for the fusilage is holding up the repairs of 5 Hind aircraft. (e) Eighteen aviation students have joined tire Training Flight for practical trainin 0 during the quarter. 9 of these-are being trained as pilots under the British, piloh instructor, and 9 are being trained as mechanics • • The Commandant of the Air Force on the advice of the British pilot instructor proposes to recommend that some 5 or 6 pilots, who on account of age or general inefficiency, are no longer fit to carry out the duties of pilots, be given administrative employment. They will eventua3.1y be replaced as pilots by the S students now with the Training Flight. * (f) The Stcarman trainer aircraft presented to the Afghan Govt. ; by the Government of the United Soates’ has not created a good impress ion in Air Force circles. This type of aircraft suffers from the same disadvantages as the Italian Romeo in that it is unsuitable for operations or training on account of the difficulty of taking off from- *small airfields with a high altitude. f f Page 2. (g)....1* (cont,d). „ 2 t , (tg) Tne forced landing of a Britisn aircraft in tae Eastern Province on 30th June caused no reactions amongst Afghan Air Force personnel, but officers have shown some curiosity regarding the type of aircraft which force landed, and in the identity of the pilot and observer . , ; They also appear to be interested in the method to be ^ adopted for the disposal of the aircraft and the pilot and observer. Oh)_ • Appendix M A n to this report gives the number and condition of‘aircraft, and the number of trained or partly trained pilots in the Afghan Air Force on 31st July, 1943. 2. Hind Squadrons ■; • (a) Flying Hours .... Owing to a desire to conserve petrol the increased periods authorised for flying training in March and April this year were reduced from 8 hours I to 2 hours per pilot per-; month. Each pilot is now limited to one short flight of 25 to 30 minutes, duration per week. (b) Operations - Nil. (o) Standard of Flying Efficiency ' . ' There' has been an improvement during the quarter. This is due to a greater variety of training, the increase in the time allotted for flying practice, and the introduction of equipment by the British pilot instructor which, tnough in the possession of the-Afghan Air Foice, nad not previously been used by Afgnan pilots. (d) Accidents (i) On 28th June an Afghan pilot stalled a Hind aircraft 10 feet off the ground and it crash-landed on the Sherpur airfield. It is estim ated that it will take three months to lepair the damage done to this aircraft. - (ii) On 3rd July a Hind aircraft landed off the airfield at Khwaja Rawash and ran into an irrigation channel. The Afghan pilot was slightly injured. Considerable damage was done to the aircraft, and repairs will take about one year to complete. Certain spares •required for the repair of this aircraft are not available in Kabul, but are on order from India or England. (e) ^/laintenance (i) There has been an improvement in the Hind spares position, but metal piping for the repair of the fusilage of Hind aircraft is urgently required. There are 5 Hind aircraft undergoing repairs in the workshops at present. »(ii) There have been a few cases of engine failure during the quarter ? due to tne absence of a British mecnanic instructor, and the careless- ! ness of Afgnan personnel in regard to the care and maintenance of engines. Mr. Robinson, Messrs Rolls Royce mecnanic instructor, left Kabul in March and nis relief, Mr. H. Pejrson, has not yet arrived from England. In order to ensure that aircraft engines are kept in good order ? supervision of tne workshops by a British mechanic appears , essential. (iii) Mr. J Bradley, Messrs Hawkers instructor attached to the Air Force, returned from Karachi m May after having attended a course in welding under tne auspices of the R.A.F. He has not -so far been asked to train Afghan personnel in welding, but has repaired tne fusilages of two Romeo aircraft. (f) Photographic Sectio n No interest has been taken in this section,, and officers of the section are now employed on administrative duties. Owing to lack of money and an efficient instructor, the activities of the section are likely to be confined to the check and cleaning, of equipment on charge. 2. (contd).. (g)»«*Page 3 . 2•(contd). (g) V/T Section .- (i) The V/T lorry has been used once during the quarter but results were unsatisfactory and communicaLion between ground and air could not be^established. This is due to the V/T lorry being in charge ^jof an inefficient operator. B.M. Muhd Amin Khan wno was trained fet Delhi is an efficient operator, but owing to jealousy is not fallowed to operate the V/T lorry. (ii) The small Lufthansa V/T set is still in store on tne Snerpur airfield, and has not been removed to the German Legation. The following details are shown on the casing of the transmitter belonging to this equipments- DREHSTHOM GENERATOR TYPE TRSFANTA No.408250 220/380 V 9.2/5.3 2.8 KV 3.5 KVA (d) Min. 0.3 1500 U/MIN 50 PERS ERREGUNG 30 U. 6.5 DETUZ (iii) There have n0 tests w r ith Herat or Berlin on further developments regarding the D/F Stationon the Sherpur airfield. This station continues to be out of bounds to the British instructors, and is to remain so until the Afghan Air Force take over the equipment from representatives of the German Legation. (h) Army Go-onerati on r . The British instructor has given a series of three lectures on Army Co-operation to Afghan Air Force personnel, and has been asked to produce plans for tne organisation of an army co-operation squadron. There have been no other developments, and no army co-operation scheme has been carried out during the quarter. 3• Romeo Squadrons (a) Flying Hours - As for paragraph 2 (a) above. (b) Onerations - Nil. (c) Standard of Flying Efficiency - No cnange (d) Accidents - nil (e) Maintenance. (i) There- has been no change. Spare airscrews and petrol pumps for the engines of Romeo aircraft,are amongst the more urgent type of spares required. (ii) Mr. J Bradley, British Instructor, has carried out welding repairs to the fusilages of two Romeo aircraft, but other repairs are essential before these aircraft can become serviceable. 4. Italian Breda Trainer Aircraft Two Breda aircraft are being u-til-izedby the Training Flight for giving preliminary instruction in flying to 9 students.The' correct type of petrol for the Breda aircraft is not available, and 87 Octane petrol is being used. 3• Flying Training School (a) The 9 students commenced tneir flying training during the quarter under tne British pilot instructor. Eight of them have completed 11 hours dual control flying and are ready to commence solo flying. They have all made satisfactory progress, and should make fairly good pilots. Most of these Students have been recruited from the French (Istiqlal) School in Kabul?and nave received a reasonable education. The British pilot instructor reports that tney are keen to learn and/taking an interest in aviation. are 5. (contd)5•(contd) g a g a, , ! t. (b) Nine students recruited from various schools in Kabul have also joined txhe Air Force, and have been placed under Mr. J Bradley for training as mechanics and fitter's. 6. Airfields (a) There is no change to report on the Sherpur airfield. (b) At Khwaja Be.wash work is in progress on the construction of the administrative offices and buildings, but work on hangers and workshops is held up for lack of cement and other materials. It is stated that j about 2000 tdns of cement are required for these buildings. King Zahir Shah inspected the airfield at Khwaja Rawasn in June^an the request of the Air Commandant. The reason for tnis inspection is believed to have been the desire of the Air Commandant to interest His Majesty in Air Force matters, and secure funds fpr the completion of,tnis airfield. ^ The Minister of Defence has apparently been trying to curtail expendit ure on the Khwaja Rawa.sh project and on tne Air Force generally. (c) One or two petrol tanks are reported to nave been installed on the airfield at Mazar-i-Sharif and the party sent there to install them has returned to Kabul. The storage capacity of the,, tank or tanks is not known, but it is understood that no avia.tion phtrol has been despatched to Mazar-i-Snarif from Kabul. 7. Aviation Petrol (a) No aviation petrol has been despatched from Kabul to the provinces during the quarter. » (b) It is now reported that about. 10,000 gallons of the petrol in •store on the Sherpur airfield has lost its pctane value. This petrol is •however being expended against the advice of the British instructors. (c) The position regarding reserves of aviation petrol held on the Sherpur airfield shows a slight decrease, as 2000 gallons out of the stocks previously held there have been expended during the- quarter. Steps have now been taken to bring the stocks of petrol held up to the figures given in paragraph 7 (a) of my report for the quarter 1st November, 1S42 to 31st January, 1943. 3. British Instructors (a) Mr. H Pearson, Messrs Rolls Royce mechanic, who it was anticipated would relieve Mr. D.W.R. Robinson early this year, has now left England ,and is expected to arrive in Kabul during August. (k) ^he one year contract of S/L B.D. Wigginton, R.A.F., pilot inst- ^ ructor to the Afghan Air Force, expires on 16th August, and the Atghan^ Government have asked for tne loan of the services of another officer for a further year.

Chief of the General S-^aff and the Commandant of the Air Force have expressed to the Military Attache 1 their satisfact ion with the services rendered by S/L V.igginton during his attachment to the Air Force but it appeared tnat they were somewnat disappoinued to learn that he did not wish to stay in Kabul for a second year. U.S.A. Stearman Trainer Aircraft The ’’Stearman” trainer aircraft was formally nanded over to tne Afghan Air Force on 25th May by the American Minister in Kabul. Its performance has been disappointing, and the aircraft has^all the dis advantages of the Italian Romeo when used on airfields witn a high altitude. The wing loading is too high for the altitude .with^the result that the Stearman can enly take off after a long run.

The aircraft carried a full petrol load, two (20 Kilo) bombs and one machine gun. Tne Romeo took off in 16 seconds, and climbed to a height of 3200 metres above Kabul. t- v . . The Hind aircraft is able to take off in Kabul in 5 to 6 seconds, the Breda in 9 to 10 seconds and tne Stearmah in 11^seconds. The Stearman aircraft takes 30 minutes to climb from 6000'to10000 feet above sea level.APPENDIX 'A' TO THE AFGHAN AIR FORCE' TRAINING REPORT FOR THE PERIOD 1st MAY to 31st JULY. 1943.

The items of most interest in the attached report are (a) the Afghan Government 1 s desire to purchase more Hind aircraft to make up 3 squadrons, (b) the spares position, (c) presentation of 1 Steannan trainer aircraft by the U.S.A. We have sei:&gt;arate papers on each of these subjects. The position with regard to (a; is that it is not x-ossible to procure any more Hind aircraft, and the Air -linistiy are now investigating alternative propositions. ,7ith regard to (b) we now have a comprehensive list of Hind spares received from the Afghan Government giving their requirements for the rest of the estimated life of the Hinds. The lists have been sent to the air .linistiy for action, and in the meantime India has been able to supply certain spares for current maintenance. This is satisfactoiy for from earlier reports it seemed that the spares position was rather desi&gt;erate.y We have also had a recent enquiry from the Afghans for spares for their Romeos and Bredas from crashed or captured Italian aircraft in North Africa; we have asked the air ministry for their reactions to this request. There are 2 changes in the personnel of the British instructors. iir. Robinson of Rolls Royce left Kabul' in larch to join the Indian Any. He was one of the original mechanics who v/ent out with the first batch of Hinds. Hr. Pearson of Rolls Royce who has gone out to replace him, arrived in Karaclii recently, and is , no doubt installed in his job. Squadron Leader Wigginton, Pilot Instructor, is to leave Kabul when Squadron Leader King, who left the U.K. on 1Ath August, arrives to replace him. The latter has undertaken to stay on for 2 years or longer if desired, which is satisfactory, for these yearly changes must have an unsettling effect on the Afghan itir i'orce, and they certainly break the continuity of our influence there. 4 ^ £aff. f or iirTo^ rroat i on. 4|&lt;i[ (ffijutd. fC&amp;MJ OM.h»riAt /j.

General REPORT OH THE AFGHAN AIH FQ3CE FOR THE PERIOD 1st NOVE?ffiER,1942 - 31st JANUARY, (a) The quarter under review has seen little activity on the part of the Afghan Air Force. During November pilots were limited to 20 minutes flying practice per pilot per 14 days, but in December this pC'^Lod was doubled, possibly because stocks of aviation petrol were accumulating and storage capacity was limited. From 27th December until January 31st weather conditions and the state of the Sherpur airfield precluded any flying training being carried out. This year the Sherpur airfield ms fit for use up to the 15th January, but after that date tne snow became too deep for safe landing or taking off. ? (b) The absence of the permanent Commandant F.M. Mund Ihsan Khan (V.W.363) has led to some deterioration in the administration of the Air Force as the officiating Commandant, G.M. Muhd Hashim Khan («.W*339) does not appear to be able to control his officers properly or nas he sufficient influence in the Ministry of Defence or elsewnere in Qover- Inment circles, to acnieve results or obtain decisions favourable to tne development of the Air Force on reasonable l:'res. Muhd Hashim is a poor administrator, but has succeeded during his spell as officiating Commandant in securing some respect from his junior officers. On the whole the British instructors consider that ti.ere has been a decrease in efficiency during the quarter. This thty ascribe to a rise in the cost of living, and a consequent desire on he: part of Air Force personnel generally to do no more that the minimum amount of work. In December a number of mechanics in the Ah' Force made a representation to the Minister of Defence asking for more pay, and also that they be given military rank similar to the pilots anl observers. They were I informed that they were already adequately paid and it was unlikely that they could earn more pay elsewhere. No further representations were made, though a few of the mechanics remain dissatisfied with their condit ions of service. (c) F.M. Muhd Ihsan Khan the permanent Commandant who proceeded to India for medical treatment in October, 1942, is xpected to return in February. His absence has undoubtedly led to many delays in obtaining decisions ion matters affecting the Air Force. (d) The British instructors are vary concerned about the spares position, and report that unless certain spare parts for Hind aircraft can be obtained from India or elsewhere within the next few months, all the Hind . aircraft will become unsafe for flying. They also consider that in the ( event of the Afgnan Air Force being ordered out on operations in support of the Government and its land forces, it will be extremely difficult to make more than 8 Hind aircraft available for tnis purpose. The R 0 meo aircraft are unsuitable for operations in many parts of Afgnanistan as it :j is known that they cannot take off from airfields having a high altitude iwith a full war load. (e) Details regarding stocks of aviation patrol believed to be held in Kabul on 31st January sire given in paragraph 7. (f) Appendix u a m to this report gives the number and condition of air craft, and the number of trained or partly trained pilots in the Afghan Air Force on 31st January, 1943. (g) The Government of the united States of America are presenting a Stearman Trainer aircraft to the Afghan Gov;rment. A description of this aircraft is given in \ an graph 9 of this report2 2. Hind Squadrons, (a) Flying Hours. During November Afghan pilots carried out snort training flights of 20 minutes per pilot every 14 days. Between December 1st and December 26th tne number of these training flagnts were increased to 20 minutes per pilot per week, l om December 27th, 1§42, to 31st January, 1943, no flying training was carried out as the airfield at Sherpur was out of use owing to snow. No dual training flights were carried out during the quarter, (b) Operations. Nil. (c) Standard of Flying Efficiency. There is no change to report during the quarter. Squadron commanders have now been given perriseict to authorise training flights by pilots in their squadrons Formerly no flying was permitted except on the express orders of the Commandant ox the Air Force. (d) Accidents. '(i) On 16th November a Hind aircraft flown by an Afghan pilot was damaged througn the port oleo leg hitting a pest erected for practising tne picking up of messages. Tne repair of the damaged lower port main-plane and port oleo leg is now nearing completion. (ii) On 26th December an Afghan pilot crashed a Hind aircraft shortly after taking off from tne Snerpur airfield, Tne accident was due to tn^ engine cutting out as a result of the f pilot misnandling the controls. The aircraft was badly damaged land tne fusilage, wings and esplanage will have to be rebuilt as soon as spares become available. (e) Maintenanc e. (i) Minor repairs to 4 Hind aircraft are be: out during tne winter montns as spares become availuo 1 (ii) Tne British instructors describe the spares pnsi J.on as worse than last quarter, and even items like fabric are urgently required. They report that unless spares can be obtained from Irdia within the next three months all the Hind aircraft in the Afghan Afr 'force will become unsafe to fly. The fabric of most of the aircraft ^ is now 6 years old and reouires replacement. No spare propellers are available and several of those in use have cracks in tne propeller boss and may become unserviceable in the near future. In the event of a call being made on the Afghan Air Force fox 1 operations involving the maintenance of the internal security of the country, the British instructors are of the opinion that it will be extremely difficult to make mere than 8 Hind aircraft available for operations. 1 (iii) The 500 gallon petrol storage tank for refuelling purposses has arrived in Kabul from Pesnawar, and is to be fitted onto a moto£ lorry. (f) Photograpnic Section. No training nas been carried out during the quarter. Tne valuable equipment is still in store, and is deteriorating through lack of use, and a proper system of care and maintenance, (g) W/T Section. '~(i) The 5 students who joined the sect!on fast year, and pilots belonging to squadrons, are expected to attend instrued .onal classes in Morse and the theory of wirelss telegraphy, but many of them fail to attend the classes, and those who do are inclined to sit by the fire and take no interest in their work. «•••*••(ii) The yapconi2. (g) (contd). - 3 - (ii) The Marconi transmitters and receivers which arrived from England in the spring of 1942 are still in store and require .the assistance of an expert to assemble them and fit them in aircraft. (iii) The section nas not used its W/T lorry this quarter. (iv) Tne small Lufthansa W/T set is still in store in the D/F station at Snerpur. (v) Seeger, the German Legation clerk, has ceased to give ! instruction in the use of the D/F equipment to Afgnan personnel, but ae (occasionally inspects this equipment and recharges tne batteries. No further test witn Berlin or Herat aas been attempted since the abortive one neld on October 20th, 1942, and reported last quarter. (h) Army Cooperation. On 16th November five Afghan pilots were given practice in turn, in picking up messages from the ground. The last pilot hit one of the posts erected for tne purpose and broke up the aircraft being used for the exercise. The attempt was then abandoned. (i) Miscellaneous. ~(i) The British pilot instructor has continued his series of lectures to Afghan pilots, but b : as f :und that interest is flagging due to the intense cold and the ptor control and discipline exercised by the officiating Commandant G. T . Muhd Hashim Khan. (ii) There have been no nrther developments in the scheme for the defence of Kabul ? and the pairs of Lewis light automatics remain in store pending the ref rr. from India of F.M. Muhd Ihsan Khan. 3. Romeo Squadrons. (a) Flying Hours. Afgnan piloLS in the Romeo Squadron have only carried out about naif the number of snort training flignts during tne quarter as compared with pilots on Hind aircraft. Flignts were limited to 20 minutes up to November 30th and between the 1st and 26th December were increased to 40 minutes. From December 27th to 31st January, 1943, no flying training was carried out. (b) Operations. Nile ' Standard of Flying Efficiency . No improvement in the general standard is reported, though pilots flying Romeo aircraft are stated to have regained confidence in their aircraft. (d) Accidents. ” During November one R^meo aircraft broke its axle when landing on the Sherpur airfield. The breakage was due to 'metal fatigue' as a result of poor maintenance. This aircraft is repairable as soon as fabric and string become available, (e) Maintenance. (i) The position is still unsatisfactory. Three Romeo aircraft are capable of long distance flig-ts, and six aircraft can only be used for short flights of about 2 ..ours by using petrol from their gravity tanks. (ii) The services of an expert welder are required for the repair of damaged Romeo aircraft. A Czech named Josef Bures is attempting to secure employment in the Air Force as a welder on a salary of £.45 per montn. The British instructors state that his work is unsatisfactory from an Air Force pdint of view, and nave advised the Air Comdt to test out nis efficiency as a welder very thoroughly before he decides to employ him. Nothing furtner nas been heard about the proposal to despatch one of the British instructors and 2 to 4 Afghan I mecnanics to India for t-raining in electric welding.- 4 - @f i*T) 9 4* Italian Breda Trainer Aircraft. Two out of the three serviceable Breda airdraft were flown by an Afghan pilot in December, and he is stated to have informed the Air Commandant afterwards that these 'aircraft are unfit for further use. The woodwork in the wings of these Breda aircraft is rotting and there is a general lack or-essential ispares • 5. Flying Training School. Tne nine students now being given instruction m the theory of aviation are expected to begin their flying training in April, 1943. 6. Airfields . Tne position is the same as reported last quarter. 7. Aviation Petrol. (a) Stocks of petrol at the Sherpur airfield are gradually increasing and on 31st January were believed to consist of:- (i) Approx 100,000 gallons in storage tanks (ii) Approx 12,000 gallons in 300 forty gallon drums. About two thirds of the petrol stored in drums is stated to have been in store for 9 months or more, and the octane value of the petrol has deteriorated. A fair number of the drums are said to be rusty. (b) Petrol stored at Khwaja Rawash airfield on 31st January is stated to consist of:- (i) Five 5000 gallon surface tanks, all full, installed at the entrance gate of the airfield. (ii) Two 5000 gallon tanks, both full, installed under the ground at the foot of the hills to the north of the airfield. N.B. One further 5000 gallon storage tank is to be installed at the foot of the hills to the north of the airfield. There are no 40-45 gallon drums of petrol in store at Khwaja Rawash. (c) On 1st December 100 gallons of petrol were sent from Kabul to Ghazni for onward despatch by animal transport to Ghilan (Map.33/P.Z.82) where a Hind aircraft, flown by an Afghan pilot named Nur Ali Knan, had force-landed owing to snortage of petrol. - ^ , There were no other despatches of petrol from Kabul to the provinces^ during the Quarter«. There are believed to be small stocks of aviation petrol at Jalalabad, Gardez, Ghazni and Kandahar. It is now reported that the aviation petrol stored at Ghazni has not been returned to Kabul as reported last quarter. Certain aircraft spares previously in store in Ghazni have however been witndrawn to Kabul. It is interesting to note that when petrol was required for the aircraft which force-landed at Ghilan on December 1st it ms sent from Kabul and not Ghazni. The reason given for this action was that the store keeper at Ghazni would probably refuse to issue the petrol unless a special government order ms despatched to him,/delay would have occurred in obtaining this authority. and 8. British Instructors. (a) Flight Sergeant R. Gillett, R.A.F., left Kabul for India on November 22nd on completion of his two years attach ment to the Afghan Air Force as an engine mechanic and fitter. No replacement for him has been provided. (b) Mr. D.W.R. Robinson, Messrs Rolls Royce &gt; instructor ia terminating his contract with the Afghan Govt, about the middle of February, 1943. He has refused to consider an extension of his contract for a further year and hopes to obtain a commission in th i Indian Army Ordnance Corps. Messrs Rolls Royce are providing a relief for him from England. _5 Presentation of a Trainer Aircraft by t.he U.S&gt;A. Gnvernment The Government of the United States of America are presenting one Steaman Trainer aircraft to tne Afgnan Government, and it is to be flown to Kabul from India as soon as the airfiled at Sherpur is fit for use. his trainer aircraft is stated to be one of a batch originally intend*^/ ed for supply to China, but when Burma was captured by tne Japanese, it was found that they had insufficient ceiling to be able to fly from India to China, and ts.ey were kept in store at Karachi. Tne Stearman trainer is a biplane with dual controls, a radial aircoiled engine, a maximum speed cf speed of 85 nnp.ho With normal tankage and if a 50 gallon reserve tank is fitted 5 possible• ^Tne aircrafts' ceiling is about 14,000 fee£), and it is estimated that it can take off from Kabul with a full petrol load, pilot, one passenger and 140 lbs of luggage. The British instructors consider,- that the estimate given regarding th&lt; load with which the Stearman trainer can fake off in Kabul is optimist as the high altitude of the airfields at Sherpur and Khwaja Rawash may reduce the carrying capacity of the aircraft. dJ* 225-250 H.P. 110 m.p.h. and a cruising at can fly for Sg hours, hour:*flights will beAPPENDIX M A ,t T O THE REPORT.

The Foreign Office have suggested that we take the opportunity to send a d.o. letter to Sir Francis Wylie on the lines of the attached draft. We agree that the present time should,be a good one for establishing our influence mmr the Afghan Air Force with an eye to the future, and it would be as well to let H*M. Minister know that we would be interested in any suggestions for furthering tins. It seems, however, that at present goodwill is the only thing we can give, and a readiness to help with the spares which are needed to keep the Hinds in the air. In spite of the fact that the Hind aircraft are/^old and obsolete pattern, they have put up a good show in Afghanistan, and in comparison with the performance and life of the Italian planes they have won the respect of the Afghans. If we can maintain this respect by keeping them in good condition and seeing to it that the instructors whom we loan are the right type, it should go a good way towards future demands for British machines after the war when we are able to supply them again. 1/y wSV-t,* aVu L5 do w^.c.'s a. v ^too. seoU cWU x' &amp;£Xovmwv( 6 \&gt;iS\CA-t v A ^ \'-0- $u$£e*Vt©‘^ J, c ^ood ovvt. ^ toc-ic^SVcV* v.€«.a draf'H*N/ Mr. numbold , I agree that it is desirable that we should help the Afghan Air Force. But I feel that the draft lays too much strength on the effect of such help on the Afghan Air Force. The personnel of the A.A.F. may have changed greatly since I was there in Kabul, but at that time the A.A.F. officers cut little ice. It is in its effect on those in high places in the Afghan G-ovemrnent that, in my opinion, our assistance would have its chief value. This point is perhaps worth making. The effects on the members of the A.A.F. which you have mentioned might feUew as a subsidiary reason for giving such assistance as we can. A.M. for concurrence ? I consider it very desirable that they and M.0.12 War Office should see before issue. (The Afghan Air Force is part of the Afghan Army.

For previous report see Ext. 5356/42. The new Pilot Instructor, Squadron Leader Wigginton, R.A.F. arrived in Kabul during the period of the report now submitted. He has reported that the efficiency of the Afghan pilots is as good as can 'be expected on the limited amount of flying. Practice flying has been still more limited owing to the desire to conserve petrol stocks and each pilot has had only about twenty minutes each fortnight, save for an intensive practice for formation flying on Independence Day. One of the major difficulties at present is the lack of Hind spares. Sir Francis 1/ifyTie has been in touch with the Government of India about spares which are required from India for immediate use and we hope that by now it has been possible to supply some.

Mr. Robinson of Messrs. Rolls Royce has recently left to join the Indian Army and is being replaced by Mr. Pearson, an aero-mechanic of Messrs. Rolls Royce, who will sail as soon as a passage is available. Squadron Leader Wigginton considers that there would be advantage in the addition of three British N.0.0*3, one as store-keeper, the second as Photographic Instructor and the third as W/T Instructor. We should perhaps wait to see if Sir Francis Wylie supports this view and takes up the suggestion. The Government of India might possibly be willing to supply the N.C.0*s and pay their salaries out of the Afghan Fund if there is really a need for them, and if the Afghans are unable or unwilling to pay.

There is the further consideration of the Afghans becoming at any time our Allies, of the Afghan Air Force being equipped so far as influence in the Afghan Air Force, There is of « V - w -.4 ^ ^ course the military value, in the eventuality that o encourage members of the Afghan/Afghan Air i'orce to entertain friendly feelings towards the R.A.P. in particular and hence to Great Britain countries, we are likely to find that it is the more energetic and ambitious among than who go in for flying and consequently the chances of some of the members of settled, 4# If there are any other ways in which you think that we can improve on what we are doing during our present opportunity to impress our influence on the Afghan Air Force whether by the provision of personnel or otherwise, any reconmendations which you make will be sympathetically considered. But as you kriovT supply in general. If Afghan youths are like those of other the Afghan Air Force becoming, by reason of their personal qualities, influential at Kabul when they are ten or fifteen years older, may be good. It is, therefore, worth while for us to take trouble with them. 3 . The question of Hind spares seems to be the main 4 that the R.A,P. in J 'ndia will be able to supply enough from their stocks to keep the Kinds serviced for the time being until the more general question of a final allocation to Afghanistan out of the Hind spares now becoming surplus can be \-o Ce&gt;AK&gt;&lt;, Mo l considerations/3 considerations would make impossible the provision of new equipment, and aneb the despatch of any bulky material from the United Kingdom is precluded by shipping difficulties. 5 * “e see that Wigginton has settled in and we should be interested to hear how he is shaping.

The first is tiiat 1 am a little dubious about the reference in paragraph 2 to the m ilitary value of the A.A.F. bein^ eqaipped on similar lines to the R.A.F. it seems to me unlikely that the Afghans would ever fight on our sideband, even if they did, I don’t think their assistance would be of any value. As a ttt fighting force I imagine tne A.A.F. is even more negligible than the Persian Air Force, which did W0'&gt; v t \i,a v’tCvv'c.^ \?J5^ the and No- nothing to defend Persia in August 1941.

The position shows little change during the quarter under review. At Khwaja Hawash aerodrome the construction of workshops has been delayed by financial considerations and Hie difficulty of obtaining materials. Some slight progress has been made in the construction of hangers. At Kandahar the construction of a hanger is held up for the lack of materials for the roof. The work of constructing a hanger at Herat is said to be progressing. Details of this hanger were given 1:. the last quarterly report. 6 • Ayiation petro 1. (a) Stocks of aviation petrol at the Sherpur aerodrome at the end of October, 1942 were believed to consist of approx 100,000 gallons inclusive of petrol contained in 45 gallon drums of wnich there are 103, Petrol arriving from India is now being stored when possible in 45 gallon drums as all the petrol storage tanks available are full. of tnis petrol is believed to have deteriorated in quality through having been stored for a considerable period, and the lask of a proper system of turnover, (b) It was previously reported by the British instructors that the petrol storage tanks at Khwaja Rawash aerodrome had a capacity of 10,000 gallons. They now state that this was a mistake and that the 7 tanks installed there only have a capacity of 5000 gallons each. Stocks of aviation petrol at the Khwaja Rawash aerodrome are now believed to consist of:~ (i) Five 5000 g^Ion surface tanks, all full, installed near the entrance gat of the aerodrome. (ii) Two 5000 gallon tanks, both full, installed at the foot of the hills to the Forth of the a -rodromo. A pit for one 5000 gallon tank has been dug at the foot of the hills to the north of the aerodrome. There are no 45 gallon drums of petrol at the Khwaja Rawash aerodrome, (c) No aviation petrol has been despatched from Kabul to the provinces during the quarter. There are believed to be small stocks of aviation petrol at Jalalabad, Gardez and Kandahar, The aviation petrol previously stated to have been held at Ghazni in 45 gallon drums has been returned to Kabul, and it is believed that tnere are no stocks of aviation petrol at Ghazni at present. 7. British Instructors. (a) Squadron-Leader B,D f . Wigginton, R.A.F., arrived in Kabul from England on 13th August and took up the appointment of pilot instructor to the Afghan Air Force on August 17th, The Afghan Chief of th General Staff stated at the end of October that they are very glad to have officers from the R.A.F. attached to tneir Air Force and hoped that this connection would continue. The position had not been very easy for his Government during the war, but fortunately the connection with the R.A.F. had been established before the present war broke ou + ‘They had been compelled, for political reasons, to give up much of the programme they had mapped out for dispatching a few of their army and air force officers and students to India for training, but later when the international situation became me to carry out some of these projects. ;re clear it might be possibl - i punx r / a 7. (contd). 5 (b) The Ministry of Defence nave decided not to make a request for a relief for Flight-Sergeant K. Gillett, R.A.F. , and he is to return to India on rovember 22nd, F/Sgt Gillett was attached to the Afghan Force as an engine mechanic and fitter in November ? 1940 for a p^.iod of one year. At the request of the Afghan authorities his services were retained for a further year, and they have frequently paid tributes to the good work he has carried out during the period ? of nis attachment. F/sgt. Gillett does not wish to continue serving in the Afghan Air Force and the Afghans for financial reasons are desirous of curtailing the number of th^ir foreign employees in the |Air Force to the bare minimum necessary to maintain the efficiency 1 of their aircraft. (c) Mr, H. Bradley, Messrs Hawkers instructor, who has been attached to the Afghcin Air Force sii'ice December, 1937, has at the request of the Afghan authorities agreed to extend his contract for a further year, ending in February, 1944. Mr. 3radley r s sei vices have been particularly appreciated by the Afghans, and he has gradually gained their confidence, particularly in matters where his technical advice is of value to them. 7r (d) Mr. D.V/.R. Robinson, Messrs Rolls Royce instructor wishes to terminate his contract with the Afghan Government in February, 1943, and his firm have agreed to provide a replacement for him. Mr. Robinson has also served with the Afghan Air Force since December, 1937, and although the Commandant of the Air Force tried to induce him to serve on for a further year, he refused to consider this proposal and will leave Kabul as soon as his relief arrives. The Ministry of Defence have agreed to accept a replacement for Mr. Robinson provided he is supplied by Messrs Rolls Royce on similar terms. | (e) ^Thc new pilot instructor, Squadron-Leader higginton, is of the opinion that a British staff consisting of one pilot instructor, one I fitter and rigger, and one engine mechanic is sufficient to meet 5 the present requirements of the Afghan Air Force in maintaining their Hind aircraft, and instructing new pilots etc. He considers that it would be an advantage, to have a British N.C.O. storekeeper attached no the Air Force for the purpose of maintaining and issuing stores, but doubts whether the Afghan authorities would ever agree to placing the whole of tluir Air Force stores under British supervision. The photographic and Y//T Sections also require a British N.C.O. Instructor for each section as the Afghan officers in cnarge appear to be incapable of putting them on to a proper working basis or 0 f using and maintaining the valuable equipment on their charge. It is however considered unlikely that the Afghan Government will be prepared | to expend money on the development of these two sections at the present i time.APPENDIX &gt;&gt; A” ®&lt;jSD TO.

Muhd Ihsan Khan (W.W.363) has rejnained on the sick list during most of the quarter, and is still 'si .. G.M. Muhd Hashim Khan (V.Y/.339) , Air staff Officer has been in charge of the Air Force during the absence of the Comdt. The latter, however, is unpopular with his subordinates and lacks influence and the qualities of a commander. There has therefore been a slight general decrease in efficiency during the period under review. Should F.M. Muhd Ihsan f s health not improve in the near future it is considered that a new Comdt will be appointed, and rumour has it that either F.M. Muhd Daud Khan (W.W.238) or F.M. Asadullah Khan (W.W.199) will take his place. (b) G.M. Ghulam Dastagir Khan (W.W.271) , the officer in charge of the workshops of the Air Force, has been appointed Director of the Kabul Arsenal, and left the Air Force. The British instructors regret the departure of this officer as he has always proved helpful to them. (c) Flying by Afghan pilots in squadrons has been limited to a n hour per pilot per week. There are no pupils under training in the Flying Training School, and backward pilots who passed out of the school last year have had no flying training during the last 40 days of the quarter. There has therefore been a slight all-round decrease in flying efficiency due to lack of practice. (d) No operations have been carried out by the Air Force during the quarter under review. (e) Aviation petrol is now arriving from India, and recent receipts have been immediately utilized to re-fuel aircraft on the Sherpur aerodrome, as storage tanks available are believed to be full. Supplies of aviation petrol from India were considerably curtailed during May and June, and for a short period no supplies were delivered. It is understood short deliveries of the quote, of aviation petrol will be supplied in the near future. 1 (f) Expenditure on the Afghan Air Force is still being strictly con trolled, but against this has to be set a report from a Swiss engineer to the effect that designs for workshops and other buildings on the Khwaja Rawash aerodrome have been rejected on the grounds that they are not on a sufficiently grand scale. (g) Ah accident to a Romeo aircraft on the Sherpur aerodrome on June 28th resulted in the complete loss of the aircraft, and the deaths of the Afghan pilot and mechanic. (h) Squadron-Leader G.W. M. N. Neman, R.A.F., pilot instructor attached to the Afghan Air Force, left Kabul on 19th July after the completion of his years f contract. The Afghan Government have I accepted the services of Squadron-Leader Wiggington, R.A.F., as pilot instructor on similar terms for a further year, and he is now on his way to Kabul from England. (i) Appendix 'A' to this report gives the number and condition of aircraft, and the number of trained or partly trained pilots in the Afghan Air Force on the 31st July, 1942. f- 2 - Hind Squadrons. (a) Flying Hours . Afghan pilots have carried out short training flights in the vicinity of Kabulj each pilot being aJ 'lowed to fly for half am. ^hour each per week. Pilots are becoming stale through lack of sufficient practice. No dual training flights have been carried out during the quarter. (b) Operations - Nil. (c) Standard of Flying E f ficiency . There has been a slight deterioration in flying efficiency due to the Air Force Comdt being sick, and insufficient flying practice during the past three month So (d) Accidents - Nil. (e) Maintenance. (i) No major repairs have been carried out, but minor repairs to one aircraft were effected. (ii) The major overhaul of a Hind dual aircraft is due to begin in August. This aircraft has completed S00 flying hours, and some minor damage has been caused by heavy landings.

At present several Hind aircraft are below Aircraft! • ilnspection Department standards. (iv) The 500 gallon petrol storage tank has not yet arrived in Kabul from Peshawar, end is s-id to be awaiting the grant of an export licence. The Chevrolet motor chassis on to which it was fitted, has been delivered in Kabul. This petrol tank is to be fitted on the lorry when it arrives, and is to be used for refueling aircraft on the Sherpur aerodrome, thus doing away with the wasteful method of re-fueling aircraft by means of hand buckets. (f) Photography . The personnel trained by Sgt 0 Murray last year are being given practice in ground photography by the Afghm officer in charge of the section. No flying has been carried out by the men of the photographic section during/quartcr. the (g) W/T . (i) The Afghan officer in charge of the section who was trained in Karachi, has-been giving instruction in the Morse Code on the ground, to pilots of all the three squadrons. No flying has been carried out by W/T operators. Five students drawn from Colleges in Kabul^have joined the section, and are being given theoretical instruction in Wireless Telegraphy. (ii) The two Marconi transmitters and receivers ordered from England a few years ago, have arrived. This equipment has not yet beer- assembled either on the ground or in aircraft, and it is anticipated that the assembly of the equipment will require expert assistance from the H.A.F. in India. So far no reouest has been made for such assistance.3 &amp;•(£)&lt; cent d) (iii) The Direction Finding station a t Sherpur aerodrome is still locked up and sealed, and no tests have been carried out between the Sherpur and Herat D/F Stations* The small Lufthansa W/T set on the Sherpur aerodrome has not been used, and is still stored in the r/F Station at Sherpur. (h) Army Co-operation . - Nil* (i) Miscellaneous. (i) T.M. Abdur Razaq has nov* left the Flying Training School and returned to his Squadron for duty. He is reported to be^very ( disappointed about the failure of the Comdt to organise his Air Force on R.A.F. lines. (ii) The Kabul Defence Scheme referred to in the last quarterly report still exists on paper and is occasionally mentioned in conversation by Afghan Air Force officerso No anti-aircraft guns have been placed in their positions, or has any part of the scheme been rehearsed. 3. Romeo Squadrons . (a) Flying Hours . Prior to the accident to a Romeo aircraft on the 28th June (see sub para (d) below) Afghan pilots flying Romeo aircraft were given local training flights of half an hours' duration per pilot per week. After the accident and up to the 17th July no flying training was carried out except for one pilot who flew for an hour on that date to gain confidence for himself and other pilots. On the 18th July seven pilots took off for £ hour flights and most of them made bad landings. On the 21st July he remaining three pilots had short practice flights. After the 21st July normal practice flights of half an hour per pilot per week were resumed. (b) Operations - Nil. (c) Standard of Flying Efficiency, There has been a deterioration in the standard due to the accident in sub para (d) below, lack of confidence in the Romeo aircraft and opportunities for obtaining practice flights c (d) Accidents . On the 28th June an Italian Romeo aircraft went into a spin, the pilot failed to recover and hit the ground with his engine full on. The aircraft became a total loss, and the Afghan pilot and mechanic were killed. The pilot had been trained in Italy, but had not learnt how to recover from a spin. This accident has affected the morale of the other pilots flying Romeo aircraft, particularly as it is the first time that most of them have seen an accident involving the destruction of an aircraft by fire. The recovery of the charred bodies of the pilot and mechanic came as a severe shock to them. Pilots of the Romeo squadron who should have been detailed to carry out a short flight immediately after the accident are reported to have shown reluctance to fly Romeo aircraft for some three weeks afterwards.- 4 - 3, (contd) (e) Maintenance , (i) Karachi trained Afghan mechanics and fitters are still utilized for maintaining Romeo aircraftc The Britim instructors carry out minor repairs, but major repairs ace held up owing to a general shortage of spares and lack cf welding material and trained welders. (ii) Only four Romeo aircraft are serviceable and capable of long distance flights, while three aircraft are able to carry out short flights in the vicinity of Kabulo This is duo to a shortage of rubber washers for petrol pumps as reported last quarter. (iii) The Czech engineer has made no progress in effecting welding repairs except to spoil some material, or in the training of Afghan personnel in welding. (f) General. The prestige of Italian aircraft has sunk even lower than before amongst officers of the Afghan Air Force 0 It is stated that after the accident reported in (d) above the Italian Legation tried to spread a rumour to the effect that the aircraft which crashed on the 28th June was a British Rind aircraft. Flying Training School. (a) During May and June pupils who passed out in 1941 were given short training flights of -g- an hours 1 duration, but at the beginning of July most of them were given leave to proceed to their homes for the harvest season. (b) The nine students who joined the school earlier this year are being given instruction in foot drill and the theory of aviation. Providing they pass their medical tests they are to commence their flying training in the spring of 1943 0 5. Aerodromes . (a) The construction of workshops and buildngs on trie Khwaja Rawash aerodrome is making slow progress, and work is being delayed through a lack of motor or animal transport for conveying material. The hangers under construction are stated to be capable of housing bombers of the Blenheim type. The workshops at this aerodrome have not been established yet, or has the cement run-way been constructed. (b) The hanger under construction at Kandahar still lacks a roof, and it appears that the project may be held up indefinitely owing to the difficulty of obtaining material from India at a reasonable price. (c) The Afghan Government have authorised the construction of a hanger to house 4 aircraft on the Herat aerodrome* It is to be a brick build ing with a tin and earth roof, 50.90 metres long, 13.80 metres wide and 5.80 metres high. The roof supports and folding doors of the hanger cannot be constructed in Herat, and will probably be made in Kabul, end. transported to Herat by sections. A stone and cement reservoir for storing water and a petrol storage tank, capacity not known, have been installed on the Herat aerodrome. 6. Avia.tion petrol . (?0 The stocks of petrol at the Sherpur aerodrome remain at approximately 100,000 gallons. Supplies of aviation petrol from India were held up for about one month during the quarter* Petrol arriving from India has been utill j lor refueling aircraft at Sherpur or transferred to Khwaja Rawash foi borage. No aviation petrol- 5 - 6* (a) (contd), has, so far as is known, been despatched from Kabul to the provinces&gt; and there has been no visable increase in the number of 50 gallon barrels of petrol on the Sherpur ae:odrome c ^ ^ A ^.t has been dug on the Birmaru hill immediately North of the Sherpur aexjdrome and it is understood that one more petrol storage tank is to be installed there. This tank is said to be under construeuio^i m the Kabul arsenal, but its capacity is not known. (b) six petrol storage tanks, each believed to be 10,000 gallon tanks, on the Khwaja Rawash aerodrome are now fullo These tanks nave been installed above ground as it was found that owing to water seepage they could not be installed below ground. These storage tanks are stated to have been constructed by the Indian Engineering Go^peny, Peshawar. Two similar 10,000 gallon tanks have now been installed above ground at the foot of the hills lg miles north of the Khwaja Rawash aerodrome* It is not known whether these tanks are xull or only partly filled. 7. Enquiries about American Aircraft. t w te There have been no further developments regarding the enquiries de by Afghan pilots about American aircraft. They appear to have cided that the American Vulture type of aircraft at any rate is suitable for use in Afghanistan owing to its welded fusilage. 8. British Instructors. Squadron Leader C.W. Ha. N. Newman left Kabul on the 19th July, his years 1 contract having ended on the 19th June, 1942. The \ Legation was at first informed by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs th..t\ a relief for S/L Newman as pilot Instructor would not be requ_red. The Ministry of Defence were then approached and stated that they had not been consulted, and were unaware that such a decision had been made.j The next day the Ministry of Defence informed the Legation that a relief; for s/L Neman would be required, and that the new pilot instructor should be attached to the Afghan Air Force for a further year on similar terms. This was later confirmed in mating by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Squadron Leader Wigging ton R.A.F., tne new pilot instructor, is now on his way to Ka.bu-1 from England. ^ The Ministry of Defence and the Comdt of the Air Force have on several occasions during the quarter stressed the necessity of naving a P^lot instructor attached to them who is a capable administrator and able to advise them regarding the organisation of their Air Force and the establishment of workshops etc., on the Khwaja Rawasn aerodrome. (b) There are likely to be changes in the remaining British instructors attached to the Afghan Air Force in November, 1942, and February, 1943. Sgt. R. Gillett R.A.F. will complete his 2 years attachment in November, 1942 , and hopes to return to his unit for duty. ^ Mr. H» Bradley, Messrs Hawkers instructor end Mr. D.W.R. Robinson, ^ Messrs Rolls Royce instructor have been attached to the Air Force since December, 1937, and their contracts expire in February, 1943. Both have expressed a desire to return to England when their prese-^t contracts expire. . n . The question of providing reliefs for them is under consideration, but no approaches regarding the problem have so far been ma.de to the Afghan Government.

Khan and Ghulam Habbani Khan were killed. The aircraft is a total loss. It appears that this aircraft was one of three practising formation flying at a height of 1500 feet. After they broke formation for landing, one aircraft A. pulled beyond the vertical and went into a spin. The pilot attempted to recover, but hit the ground with his engine full on. An enquiry is to be held about the accident on the 4th July. (b) This accident has shaken other Afghan pilots, B. and up to the 5rd July no further flying has been carried out.

P.REPORT OF THE AFGHAN AIR FORCE PERIOD 1st NOVELBER * 1041 to 31st JAIRJ ARY .,1942 . 1. General » The introduction of petrol rationing in India and tne desire of &gt;sae Air Commandant to increase his reserves of aviation spirit by w coring as much as possible of the amounts received each month from India, led to a drastic reduction in all forms of flying training. The periods of flying training for Afghan pilots were restricted as follows during the quarters- (a) Good pilots 30 minutes per fortnight. (b) Fair rl 20 minutes per week. (c) Recently trained pilots. 30 ,f M u No flying of any kind has been carried out between the 23rd December, 1941 and the 31st January, 1942. This was due first of ail to holidays, and latter to severe 7/inter v/eather. The British pilot instructor considers that the reduced facilities for flying training has lowered the general efficiency of Afghan pilots. The petrol supply problem is now stated.to be easier, but the Air Commandant continues to store my petrol receive^, in the newly installed storage tanks on the Khwrja Rnwash aerodrome. ing The Flying Train^ School v/hich re-opened on the 26th October continued to function until the 23rd December, 1941, when training ceased for tne winter months. Two Afghan pilots passed out on the 15th November, and three on the 23rd December. The school will probably re-open next spring when some 9 students selected from various colleges in Kabul v/ill commence their training. 3gts Brierly, and Murray, the h/T and Photographic instructors attached to the Afghan Air Force for one year from tne R.A.F. in India, completed tneir attaenmeut and left for India in November, 1941. Sgt Gillette, R.A.F. , aero engine mecnanic, is at tne request of tne Air Commandant to stay on for a further year. The two engineers, Bradley and Robinson, originally provided by Messrs Hawkers and Messrs Rolls Royce, have been asked to renew their contracts for another year. The British instructors are now being made responsible for the repair of damaged Italian aircraft in the Afghan Air Force, but some difficulty is being experienced owing to the lack of trained welders and a suit able welding machine. No operations have been carried out by the Afghan Air Force during th^ quarter under review. The Air Commandant informed the Military Attache* recently that he was still finding it difficult to persuade the Ministries of Education and Defence to allov/ him to select suitable students from civil and military schools md colleges for training as pilots, observers and technicians. He was at present only obtaining youths with inferior educational attainments, the best being emnwrked for the army or other Government employment. He hoped that eventually sanction would be given for the formation of an Air '.’Ing for cadets at the Military College, or failing this a separate Air Force Training School for cadets estrblished. The control of tne Air Force is still in the hands of the Minister of Defence who closely supervises expenditure and only allows the Air Commandant th~ minimum sums necessary for me maintenance and upkeep of his force. The effect of world events on the economic position of the Afghan Govt, renders it unlikely that they will be able to increase the Air Force budget in the near future, and it is even possible that the budget allotment will be decreased a.s a measure of economy. Should ^tnis occur even the present 107/ standard of efficiency will b^ difficult2 if to maintain. The Afghan Go; t. will, however, mako every effort to keep their present force Intact and provide sufficient funds to allow of the minimum necessary training for personnel and the maintenance and upkeep of aircraft, as they realise that the Air Force has proved its value in quelling internal disturbances during the past A years, and its existance assists them to maintain the prestige and st.ability the Government. Appendix ’’A' to this report gives the number and condition of aircraft, and the number of trained and partly trained pilots in the AfgncX. ^ir Force on the 31st January, 1942. 2. Hind squadrons. (a) Flying Hours. As for the last quarter, approximately 14 hours per week for about 40 pilots. Mo flying has been carried out between the 23rd December, 1941 and the 31st January, 1942. (b) Qp er - ' tions. Nil during the quarter. (c) Standard of Flying Efficiency . (i) There is no change to report. (ii) S pilots of No.3 squadron carried out air firing practice on ground targets in November. The highest score being 11 hits. 4 observers carried out similai practice, the best score being 3 hits. Each individual fired 100 rounds ball- 3.A.A. (iii) No dummy dive bombing has been carried out during the quarter. (d) Accidents. Nil. (e) Maintenanc e. Msg or repairs to one Hind aircraft have been carried out. Spares for Hind aircraft are still urgently required. The_spare and workshop material purchased by Mr. Robinson, Messrs Roils Royce 1 s engineer in India in April, 1941, are now on their way fc' to Kabul from peshaw- r. The delay in delivery has been due to s/ misunderstandings regarding licences for the export of the material from India, and the to provide motor transport. failure of the Afghan authorities A proposal for fitting skis belonging to Romeo aircraft to Kind aircraft is under consider cat ion. (iv) Mr. Bradley, Messrs Hawkers engineer, proceeded to Peshawar recently, and purchased a secondhand 500 gallon petrol storage tank at the request of the Air Commandant. This they hope_to fit on to a motor chassis, and use the motor tanker for filling aircraft with petrol on the sherpur aerodrome. No application for an export licence from India has been made so far. (f) Photograp hy. (i) sgt Murray R.A.F. on completion of his ye:.rs attachment to tne Afghan Air Force left for India in November. (ii) Two small mosaics of areas near Istalif and Guldara in the Kon- i-Daman district where the Air Commandant has landed property were taken. Oblique photographs of King Eahir Shah’s palace at Pagnmnn and K.R.R. Shah Mahmud’s residence at Rishkhor were also taken.a 3 (g) W/T. (i) Flight/3gt Brierly R.A.F., on ccmpletion of his year’s attachment to the Afghan Air Force left for India in November, 1941. (ii) The Direction-Finding station on the Sherpur aerodrome is still locked up, and the key with Swartz who is now interned in Russia. The D/F station at Herat is stated to have been completed, but is not in operation. (iii) The small Lufthansa V/T set on the Sherpur aerodrome has now been taken away under arrangements made by the German Legation. It is probably stored either in the Legation or elsewhere in Kabul. 3* Romeo Squadron. (a) Flying Hours. As for the last quarter, an average of two aircraft for 1 hour per week. No flying training has been carried out between the 23rd December, 1941 and the 31st January, 1942. (b) Qper aticns . Nil. (c) Standard of Flying afficiency . No change, the standard remains low. (d) Accidents . Nil. (e) Maintenance. (i) The 21 Afghan mechancis who completed their training under the Italian instructors at the end of October, 1941 have been distributed to both Hind and Romeo Squadrons and the Flying training Flight. (ii) Maintenance of Romeo aircraft is carried out by Afghan mechanics and repairs by the British instructors. Welding repairs are held up by the lack of an efficient welding machine and trained welders. (iii) Spares for Romeo and Breda aircraft are very scarce and efforts to obtain them have been unsuccessful. (iv) The proposal to dispatch one of the British instructors and a few Afghan mechanics to Lahore for training in welding awaits sanction of the Minister of Defence. It appears that a Czech engineer in Kabul has stated that he can train men in welding but it is considered that he is unlikely to be able to cope with the more specialised type of welding required for repair ing aircraft. (f) General. (i) Italian Romeo aircraft are now the subject of cuips and jokes amongst Afghr. n pilots, and after the departure *of the Italian instructors at the end of October, 1941, the Air Commandant informed one of the British instructors that he did not intend to train any more student pilots to fly Romeo aircraft. (ii) In January the Air Commandant told the Military Attache* that he had been criticized by various Afghans for purchasing Italian Aircraft, and some of them had stated that though the Italian Government had given him a decoration ana a present of a motorcar they had supplied him with 24 second-hand aircraft. The British Government, hov/ever, had not given him a present or a decoration, and could not therefore have held a high opinion of him when he visited India and England, but they had supplied him with 8 new aircraft and 20 secondhand aircraft The Air Commandant further stated th r t the 8 new Hind aircraft he had purchased in 1937 were the best available in Europe at the time, and he was fully satisfied with these aircraft which had proved both suitable and useful for service under Afghan conditions. 4. Flying Training School . (a) Two pupils passed out as pilots on the 15th November, and three more passed on the 23rd December, 1S41„ The British pilot instructor considers that the last three pupils were passed out too early, but the Air Commandant pressed for this,on the grounds that the pupils were losing pay and allowances, and if they were not passed out in December they would become disgrunted by remaining on students allowances during the v/ inter months. The pupils in question are safe pilots, but require further instruction in formation flying etc. They have now joined the Kind squadrons. (b) The total average flying time put in by the pupils was 80 nours, of whi ch 30 hours were dual and 50 nours solo. (c) The two Afghan pilots under training rs instructors are limited to a certain amount of mutual dual flying on Breda aircraft. One of them who is unsuitable on account of age and is a brother-in-law of the Air Commandant has been replaced by T.M. Abdur Raz&amp;q. They have not made much progress during the quarter. Breda aircraft have not so far been flown by the British pilot instructor. 5. A erodromes. (a) Very little progress has been made with the construction of the 8 hangers and workshops on the Khwaja Bawash aerodrome. (b) The construction of a cement run-way on the Khvaja Bawash aerodrome has not yet started, (c) The construction of the hanger on the landing ground at Kandah-r is held up by a lack of iron for the roof. This iron is to come from India and arguments about the cost, (which is said to vary between Bs.30 and Bs.60 Indian per cwt) plus the difficulty of obtaining an export licence in India have delayed a decision to purchase the iron. 6. Aviation Petrol . Stocks of petrol at the Sherpur aerodrome are estimated zo be about the same as they were at the end of last quarter i.e. 100,^00 gallons. The six iO,GuO gallon tanks newly installed on the Khwaja Bawash aero drome are being gradually filled as penrol arrives from India. 7. B rinish Instrue nors. (a) Squadron-Leader Newman R.A.F., Sgt Gillette R.A.F. , Mr. Bradley and Mr. Robinson were presented winh gold watches by the Minister of Defence in November, 1941 in appreciation of the services they had rendered to the Air Force, and particularly to the Flying Training School (b) The arrival of a U.3.A. Military Attache* in Kabul during December led to rumours (probably Axis inspired) to the effect that British instructors would shortly be withdrawn from the Afghan Air Force and that the Afghan Govt, intended to purchase aircraft from the U.3.A. There was of course no foundation for these rumours.AP PENDIX 'A' TO THE REPORT ON THE AEGEAN AIR FORCE FOB THE PERIOD 1st, NOVEMBER^ 1941 to 31st JANUARI*3.942« Tho follov/ing was the situation regarding the serviceability of aircraft in the Afghan Air Force on the 31st January, 1942.

AIRFORCE PERIOD 1st AUGUST - 31st OCTOBER, 1 S 4 1 EXT n 5 ^ 1 * General , { I 942 J Prior to the 11 Independence Day Hevlev/' on *che 23rd August ? practice in formation flying was the chief form of activity. At the Review 3 22 Hind and 8 Romeo aircraft flew past in formation, their performance showing no improvement on previous years. After 'the In dependence Celebrations there was the usual tendency to curt a it activities and to put the Air Force into ' cold storage 1 '.. This ^ ear this was particularly noticeable due to res trictions on the supply of petrol from India to Afghanistan. The Air Commandant was undoubtedly disturbed by these restrictions and he reduced practice flying for pilots in active squadrons to 20 minutes ?ei fortnight^ and in certain instances to 15 minutes per week. Ine Flying rraining School closed down on the 2nd September, and was on.iy re-opened on 'die 26th October, when, the petrol supply problem showed signs of improvements The school therefore only carried out flying training for 54 days out of the 92 in the Quarter under review. There is however little doubt that the Afghan authorities were attem pting to build up reserves of aviation petrel for future contingenciesj and were prepared to curtail training with this end in view. The Air Commandant, though anxious to increase the number of trained pilots in his Air Force, failed to secure approval from his Government for the training of additional personnel in India or in Kabul. Tne main argument against him being that the Afgheuc Air Force had ! sufficient trained men to carry out its role in main coining internal security,, Early in September the Military Attached discussed with the Air Commandant and the Chief of the General Gtaff, the problem regarding the retention of British instructors attached to ties Afghan Air Force. It was evident th-vt they were prep red to accept the services of all these instructors for ^ further period, but while enthusiastic regard ing the retention of the pilot instructor, Messrs Hawkers and Messrs Rolls Royce engineers (Bradley and Robinson; , nd the R„A.F.-Sergeant instructor a. on a.eio engines (Gillette), tney regarded the retention of/ © 2 - tt z W/T ir.suru.ctor 1 and the Photographic instructor (both on loan iroin the R,A*F. in India, Sergeants Brierly nod Murray respectively) s luxuries whicn they could rot aifor^L The three R.A.F. Sergeant instructors are due uo return to India in November. To is ottiuudc on the part of ‘ohe Air Commandant in September, before me expuls:;.or of German and Italian nationals became prominent, could only be treated with suspicion It is however possible that the n.xgnan Government wished to reduce to a bare mirimun the number of Jo ear loreign enxpioyees, ud the Air Comma, id'ant, who still maintains some contact with the Italian Legation, may have decided that the Dost way of curtailing his quota of foreign instructors would be to elimiCc ^ T ° ou t oi the six British instruc‘c»ors, thus leaving three Italian ana four British instructors in his Air Force. * l ^ o oi October the position cnanged and one 3 Italian iiastiuc— tors, remaining in the Afghan Ail- Force, left Afghanistan under safe conduct for Italy via India* Tue xmntccaate eixect of tnis action, on the p.art of the Afghan Governmr ana nas been to confine the advisory staff of foreign instructors attached to the Afghan Air Force to British personnel. It can therefore be anticipated th^t the British instructors will h' re increased scope, since tney will be made responsible for the care, and maintenance, mad minor and major repairs of Italian aircraft r s well as for British aircraft. In these circumstances it is important tmt we should now seize every opportunity of assisting in every way possible the Air Force in Afghanistan by ensuring the speedy supply of spares from India, the supply of aviation spirit on the basis of supplies made during the past three years, and the provision of technical advisors, or facilities for the trailing of nfgnan Air iorce per sonnel in India, should the Afghan Government make requests f o i* s u ch assist: n c a. ve have been successful in eliminating possible German and Italian competition in the Afghan Air Force for the noman t, and it is urgently necessary that we siiould tame every opportiviity of providing all assistance r.n our powei and thus ensure timt we not only retain our present influence in the Afghan Air Force, but if possible increase it. Air Force, but3 Should wc f'^il to provide such assistance now, the eventual result will be tnot the Afgnan Government 7/ill attempt to obtain any help they require from other sources. The question of providing the Afghan Government with 4 Tiger itoth trainer aircraft has on the suggestion of the British instructors been discussed, but the Afghan Government decided that as tney had made no provision Jn this years* budget for such a purchase, the problem must be Inft orer for consideration until the spring of 1942. The Commandant has made every effort to increase the petrol storage capacity of the Air Force, and it is believed that he has about 100,000 gallons of aviation petrol stored on the sherpur aerodrome. Tnere are also eight 10,000 gallon tanks on the Khv/aja R3wash aerodrome, six of which have became available o e smal1 reserves been installed, and ware being filled as petrol at the end of October, There are also believed to of aviation petrol stored in 40 gallon drums on the landing grounds at Jalalabad, Gardez, Ghazni and Kandahar. Fc operations have been carried out b;y the Afghan Air F quarter, but 2 aircraft were ordered to 'stand, by' for orce during the a few days at the end of August, and early September for use in the Kunar area against the Mohmands should the necessity arise.

Yours ever, U H A H C H K Y. xhe i^astem department, jroreign office, London.'&amp;HK0 REPORT OF THE AFGHAN AIR FORGE P ERIOD 1st MAY TO 31st JULY, 19 41 1. General. EXT 8190 1941 There has been the usual seasonal increase in activities during the quarter, though most of the efforts made have been directed towards obtaining the best possible formation flying for the 'Independence Day Review' which takes place about the 23rd of August. Nothing further has been heard from the Afghan authorities regard ing the proposal to dispatch students to India for training in : aviation. The British instructors attached to the Afghan Air Force state that the general efficiency of the Air Force is still very much affected by family influence, nepotism and jealousy. No. 1 (Hind) Squadron has the older and less efficient pilots, No. 2 (Romeo) Squadron has the best of the older pilots who were trained in India or at Kabul by British instructors but were taken \ away to fly Romeo aircraft at a later stage, and No. 3 (Hind) Squadron has the young and promising pilots whose progress is cramped by lack of practice, jealousy, and a poor squadron leader. Another reason for the lack of enthusiasm in trailing is believed to be the policy of the Afghan Government and the Ministry of Defence regarding the use of their Air Force, senior officers in the Air Force have stated that the aircraft are only required to cope with internal disturbances and if pilots are able to fly reasonably well and use their machine guns and bombs against ground targets this standard is sufficient for their purpose. Nine aircraft have been kept'standing by' during the month of July for use in the Kunar area in the event of further unrest amongst the Mohmands. Efforts have been made to increase petrol storage facilities for the Air Force at Khwaja Rewash aerodrome, two 10,000 gallon tanks have been dug in on the hills North of the aerodrome and three 10,000 gallon tanks are to be sunk near the hangers and barracks.2 Appendix 'A' to this report gives the number and condition of aircraft, and the number of trained or partly trained pilots in the Afghan Air Force on the 31st July, 1941. 2. HIND SQUADRONS . (a) F lying Hours. There has been an increase over last quarter due to better weather. The average number of flying hours has been one hour per pilot per week. These have all been short training flights near Kabul, and no Hind aircraft have left Kabul on long distance training flights. (b) Operations. It has now been discovered that the three Hind aircraft which carried out reconnaissance flights over the Kunar area between the 27th March and the 3rd April must have fired some ammunition as empty cases have been found in the aircraft by the British instruct ors. No operations have been carried out during the quarter under report, but nine aircraft have been 'standing by' since the beginn- they ing of July and it is under stood/are to proceed to Jalalabad if required. It is thought that this move is connected with a possible recrudescence of Mohmand unrest in the Kunar valley. (c) Standard of Flying Efficiency . Little effort has been made to increase the flying efficiency of the individual pilot. This is due to the lack of drive and initiative on the part of the squadron commanders. Some of the pilots are never likely jto become efficient ov/ing to age and the lack of courage and initiative. Practice in formation flying has been the dominant feature, but no other serious training has been carried out. (d) Accidents . The following accidents occurred during the quarters- (i) At Paghman when the British pilot instructor force landed owing to the engine cutting out. (ii) At Khwaja Rawash when an aircraft turned over due to a bad landing by an Afghan pilot.3 (iii) In the Koh-i-Daman district when an aircraft force landed due to the main petrol tank running out and the Afghan pilot forgetting to turn on the reserve petrol tank. (iv) At Sherpur aerodrome for the same reason as in (ii) above. (v) On the 10th July, at Sherpur aerodrome an Afghan pilot landed on the windward side of the aerodrome jammed his brakes on and turned over the aircraft. Four of the above accidents were in the Flying Training School and one in No. 3 Squadron. Repairs to two of the above Hind aircraft have been completed, two more will be made serviceable within a month, and one aircraft can be made serviceable in about four months. (e) Maintenance. Two aircraft have been completely rebuilt, and minor repairs to four aircraft have been completed during the quarter. The supply of spares for Hind aircraft is now an urgent matter ue to the accidents in (d) above. spares purchased by Mr. Robinson in India (see report for quarter ending the 30th April, 1941) have arrived at Peshawar are awaiting collection by Afghan transport. (f) Photography. A mosaic of 50 exposures covering the Secretariat and Palace at Bar al Fanun has been completed during the quarter. King Zahir shah and the Minister of Public Works have asked for further mosaics of small area,s in the vicinity of Kabul. (g) W/T . (i) Two successful tests between the air and the ground have been carried out by the Sgt. Instructor during the quarter. This is the first time such tests has been made. The second test was carried out at a distance of 80 miles. (ii) The Direction Finding station on the Sherpur aerodrome is still locked up. Herr Swartz the mechanic in charge is- 4 - now interned in Russia having been caught there on the out' break of the Russo-German war while returning from leave in Germany. ^ 3 t Romeo Squadrons . (a) Flying Hour s. Four aircraft have flown on the average one hour each per week during the quarter. (b) Operations. Nil, but one training flight was carried out from Kabul to Ghazni. (c) Standard of Flying Efficienc y. No change. (d) Accidents. One .aircraft broke a bottom wing as a result of swinging on landing. (e) Maintenance . The position remains the same, and there is an acute shortage of spares. The use of spare Hind tail wheels has saved xhe Romeo situation. Certain damaged Romeo aircraft cannot bo repaired until efficient welding can be carried out in Kabul. The Commandant proposes to send Mr. Bradley, Messrs Hawkers mechanic, and three Afghan mechanics to Lahore in the autumn, where they will undergo a course- of training with the Oxogen Welding Company for 2 months. On their return the Romeo aircraft could be repaired under the supervision of the British mechanics. (f) General. The prestige of the Italians and their Romeo aircraft is still very low. 4. Flying Training School. Of the 8 pupils under training by the British pilot instructor four are ready for advanced training, two will be ready in a month ? and two will require much additional training before being fit for more advanced training. / /' 'N.mnwmm - b - ' The standard of formation flying of four of the students ivS exceptionally good and they are to take part in the fly past of the Independence Day Review in August* Two students have had accidents involving facial injuries but have now returned to duty. One pupil had a slight accident but suffered no injury, T.M. Abdur Razaq Khan who was trained in India is now a good flying instructor, and is very helpful to the British instructors whenever his services are made available. The British instructors consider that the Afghan Government should purchase a few Tiger Moth training aircraft for this school as tie | present system of training students on service aircraft is both wasteful and more expensive. This suggestion is to be made to the Commandant of the Afghan Air Force. 5 * Aerodromes, (i) It is anticipated that the Hangers and Barracks now under construction on the Khwaja Rav/ash aerodrome will be completed a'b the end of this year, (ii) A Hanger to accommodate four aircraft is being constructed on the Kandahar landing ground. (iii) A W/T and direction finding installation has been erected on the Herat landing ground ’under the supervision of Polish engineers and Messrs Lufthansa's representatives. Details where known have been reported separately.Notes for Registry. 19.44. Initials. Uader Secretary... Secretary of State,, Committee if AW' Under Secretary...

PERIOD 1st FEBRUARY TO 30th APRIL, 1941, ^ GENERAL Activities were considerably curtailed during the first two months of the quarter owing to weather conditions.. Snow and rain frequently rendering the landing grounds in Kabul unfit for use* The four Hind aircraft sent to Jalalabad for the winter months, and the three Romeo aircraft which were dispatched to Kandahar have now returned to Kabul. The Romeo aircraft at Kandahar which crashed on the landing ground there at the end of January is now stated to have been rendered unserviceable. Nothing further has been heard from the Afghan authorities regarding the scheme mentioned in my last report, for training 70 more Afghan students in India. The present position in the l 6k Wm*/ Afghan Air Force and the necessity for retaining British influence ' w* 00 &amp; in the Force was the subject of a special report to His Majesty's ■MM* &amp; Minister, dated 13th April, 1941, copies of which were sent to Army Headquarters, India, and Headquarters, Air Forces in India, under my Demi-official letter No.Hbk/L/6/M.A., dated 16th April. Appendix ’A’ to this report gives the number and condition of aircraft, and the number of trained or partly trained pilots in the Afghan Air Force on 30th April, 1941. 2 * HIND SQUADRONS . (a) Flying Hours . Owing to activities being curtailed due to weather conditions, Squadron-Leader Burt-Andrews has nothing of interest to report. (b) Operations . Three Hind aircraft with war loads carried out daily reconn aissances between 27th March and 3rd April over the Kunar valley area in connection with an incursion by Mohmand tribal forces. The presence of aircraft is said to have caused their dispersal. No ammunition or bombs were used.Page 2 . (c) Standard of Flying Efficiency, Nothing new to report. (d) Accidents. There were none during the quarter. (e) Maintenance. No change. Mr. Robinson,the mechanic supplied by Messrs Rolls Royce, has been dispatched to Bombay by the Command ant of the Air Force to purchase certain workshop material tA and spares. Rs. 10,000 Indian has been placed at his disposal with the Afghan Consul at Bombay. In the autumn of last year an Afghan officer was dispatched for this purpose but apparently returned without having been able to secure their full requirements. (f) G-eneral . During March, 1941, the British pilot instructor was required to make a large scale mosaic of the Kabul area. This work involved about 600 exposures, and the results were completely successful. This mosaic was originally intended for the Afghan Government’s town planning scheme which is under the auspices of the Public Y/orks Ministry, but copies are now to be prepared for King Zahir Shah, the Minister of Defence and the Commandant of the Air Force. The photographs have made such an impression on the Afghan authorities that demands for aerial pictures are now flowing in from various Ministries and His Majesty the King. It is interesting to note that the charges made by the Air Commandant for the original photographs for the Ministry of Public Works was the equivalent of approximately £125, a sum very much in excess of the actual cost of production.3* Romeo Squadrons * (a) Flying Hours . No change since the last report was submitted, (b) Operations, Nil, (c) Standard of Flying Efficiency. No change. (d) Accidents. No further accidents have been reported. (e) Maintenance .

(f) General, The prestige of the Italians and their Romeo aircra.ft continues to be low. 4• Flying Trai ning School, The training of the new pupils continued satisfactorily during the quarter^ four aircraft were flown for nearly 450 hours with out any failures or accidents. In conversation with the British Pilot Instructor, G.M. Ghulam Dastgir Khan, the Director of the School agreed that the British Air Ministry syllabus of flying training has proved so superior to that of the Italians that no further training on Italian lines could be com temp lated.APPENDIX REPORT ON TnE AFGHM AIR FORCE FOR THE PERIOD 1st FEBRUARY to 30th APRIL 1S41.

The report submitted is the first of the quarterly reports on the Afghan Air Force to be received at the 1.0/ Y/e hatJ^ heard that last October the Afghan Government asked if the Government of India would afford facilities for the free training in India of a further 70 Afghan Air Force personnel. We now learn that the G-ovemment of India had undertaken the training 7 but that the Afghan Government decided later not, tq acce/&gt;t the offer. The reasons givenj^/ere very plausible. This is most disappointing as the training of such a large batch of men in India would undoubtedly have strengthened our influence over Afgiian aviation and put the Italians very much into the background. As it is, however, the Italian flying prestige is low since their show in Libya and the number of their machines in service compare/compare very unfavourably with the British ones. Out of an original total of 24 Italian aircraft (Romeo and Breda) and 20 British aircraft (HawkerHinds) 9 Italians are serviceable as against 25 Hinds. The R.A.F. technical staff on loan to the force are well spoken of. Squadron Leader Bttrt—Andre-.vs who has been loaned to the Afghan Government for several years as British Instructor and has done excellent work there, is being replaced shortly by an R.A.F. Officer from India. (There is another file on this subject) It will be a great pity if the Afghans let the air force which we have helped to build up deteriorate for political reasons. The men trained in India have been superior to the Italian trained pilots and our British machines have given good service./ L&gt;ear Department, please refer to Northern uepeirtment’s letter No. N 3345/143/97, dated 29th uctober, 1940. 2. as requested, we forward herewith a copy of our letter no. 186/41, dated the 22nd February, 1941 together with enclosure, addressed to . the astern department, Foreign office, for your information.

Appendix ’A* to this report gives the number and condition of aircraft, and the number of trained or partly trained pilots in the Afghan Air Force on 31st January, 1941. The decision not to accept the British offer to train some 70 students in aviation in India is most disappointing, particularly as the Commandant of the Air Force and the Minister of Defence ha^ themselves asked for these facilities in October, 1940. Had we succeeded in dispatching tnis party to India it would I consider (and Squadron-Leader Burt-Andrews agrees with me) have eventually ousted Italian influence in the Afghan Air Force, and left the British predominent in matters of supplies, advice and training* The excuse put forward by the Minister of Defence and the Commandant of the Air Force for the cancellation of the proposed training was that the Ministry of Education have already provided a number of students for the Military College, and were unable to supply further suitable students for training in India. The reason given hardly holds water, since for some time, 25 cadets have been undergoing preliminary training at the sherpur aerodrome, were earmarked for dispatch to India for training, and have only recently been informed that the scheme has been abandoned. There may have been other political reasons for the decision, and it is possible that the Afghan Government do not at present wish to offend Germany, Italy or Russia, and prefer to wait until the international situation becomes more clear. At interviews I had with the Commandant of the Air Force and the; Chief of the General staff in January, I expressed my disappointment cat the cancellation of the scheme and pointed out that the Royal Air Force in India had gone to a lot of trouble to work out plans for the training of tnis personnel, only to find tin t their efforts had been wasted. Both these officers expressed their r^gr^t for the inconvenience caused, and the Commandant stated that he too was extremely sorry that he had been compelled to abandoned the proposal, he hoped however that the position would change during the next few mouths and an acceptance of the offer become possible. Whatever the real reasons fur turning down the offer of train ing actually are, thc.ro is no d.ubt that the Commandant and officers of the Air force are thoroughly convinced that British methods of training are far superior to those of other countries. British aircraft are hotter, and that the British instructors supplied to the Afghan Air Force are most efficient and largely responsible for any ability or technical skill which the Forc^ may have at present. These opinions are probably reinforced by events in Libya, where the Italian Air Force has put up such a poor show and undermined any local prestige the Italians may have had. It is therefore strange that the Afghan Government should have given way to probable.pressure on the part of tne Axis Powers, and abandon the scheme for training their air personnel in India.^ . Aq 2 i and 2. HIND SQUADRONS ; (a) Flying hours. Since the period of the last report there has been no change in tne flying hours of the Squadrons. Until winter came the school alone was granted unlimited petrol and in the first six weeks of the quarter the Training Flight did 130 hours with one flying instructor and only 3 aircraft; snow then interrupted flying. In December it was proposed to move the school to Jalalabad so that flying might continue. All preparations for this won. made and the three British instructors actually sent their furniture ahead, when the idea was suddenly abandoned/during one week three different excuses were given to Burt-Andrews for this sudden cancellation. One was that they could not afford the petrol to carry on through the winter and that flying could be resumed in Kabul in the spring; the second was that the Afghan Government did not want ''foreigners touring round the Eastern province at the present time' , and the third excuse was that there was insufficient material to maintain the Hinds flying through the winter. The excuses based on economy were in the opinion of Squadron-Leader Burt-Andrews obviously false. One flight of 4 Hinds with pilots from the two Squadrons did move to Jalalabad in the middle of December and reports indicate that only about 1 hour’s flying per week per pilot has been carried out since. (b) O perations. No operations were carried out during the quarter, (c) Standard of flying efficiency . The continued absence of any advanced flying training for the Hind Squadrons has not helped to improve the general standard. All pilots, however are now competent to fly the Hind under normal conditions and the standard ef formation flying is good and out of all proportion to th^ir operational efficiency. (d) Accidents. There were no accidents during trie quarter. (e) Maintenance. The arrival of Sergeant Gillette., a Fitter/Rigger loaned by the Royal Air Force for a period of one year (together with a Sergeant photographer, and a Sergeant Wireless Operator) has done much to improve the general standard of maintenance. He has proved of great assistance to Mr. Robinson who is now free to devote more time to workshop organisation. ■ The Keenan &amp; Froude test bed has now been erected and test work has started with excellent results; an engine entirely rebuilt in Afghanistan by Mr. Robinson from crashed engines and stores spares, has passed the standard Rolls Royce tests, much to the gratification of the Commandant. (f) General , Sergeants Murray (Photographer) and Brierly (Wireless Operator) mentioned in paragraph (e) above, have done excellent work since their arrival in November. The Wireless Section is now funct ioning smoothly and is ready for full tests when the weather becomes fit for flying.(f) (cont). - 3 - Sergeant Murray has organised an excellent Photo Section and early in January an Afghan Pilot flew with him and took part of a mosaic required by the Town Planning Department of the Ministry of Public Works. The photographs were a complete success, although through lack of training the pilot naturally did not produce a faultless mosaic; the job will have to be repeated by the British instructor, but the Afghans are satisfied that their photographic equipment is of the highest order. 3. RQMBO SQUADRONS. (a) Flying Hours . The lack of spares from Italy to make serviceable the Borneo aircraft of this Squadron has limited flying to a total of not more than 10 hours a month. The morale of the Squadron is therefore very low. One flight of 3 Romeos went to Kan d all a r for the winter in the middle of December and reports state th^t only a very limited amount of flying is being done. (b) Operations . No operations were carried out. (c) Standard of flying efficiency . The general standard of the Romeo squadron seems to have deteriorated, obviously owing to the lack of flying practice. (d) Accidents . A Romeo crashed on the aerodrome at Kandahar at the end of January. Full reports difficult to obtain, but it appears that the pilot was approaching to land in a wild side-slip and crashed; these aircraft are completely unsuitable for side slipping owing to the extremely small comparative area of the tail unit. Both occupants of the aircraft were injured and are in hospital; one report stated that they were not seriously inj ured ’’although the observer had broken his back”. When news of the crash reached Kabul a Kind aircraft was sent to Kandahar to investigate the circumstances, and returned after 4 days stay there. (e) Maintenance. The Italian Instructor has stated th^t as no supplies nr^ arriving from Italy maintenance problems are becoming acute. 4. Flying Training School. During the training of the new pupils on Breda Trainers, the Afghan ’’Instructors” broke four aircraft by swinging on landing and the Italian Instructor contributed a further breakage by colliding with a pupil when taxying. Breda serviceability has thus now been reduced to one Breda 25 and the Breda 28 (a special aerobatic machine given by.the Italian Government) which however nevers flies as according to Mazzini, the Italian Instructor, it has the nasty habit of whipping into a spin on the slightest provocation owing to some structural defect.4 - ^ Italian prestige in th^ Afghan Air Force is on the wane since events in Libya have shown up the weakness of the Italian Air Force. Mazzini is now openly blaming Fascism for Italy’s reverses and this will presumably diminish the effect of Italian propaganda. On the conclusion of light training for the pupils of the Flying Training school a ceremonial parade was held at which gold watches were presented to Warrant Officer Mazzini, Corporal Petrillo and Corporal Bocca, the three Italian instructors.P age 1.
