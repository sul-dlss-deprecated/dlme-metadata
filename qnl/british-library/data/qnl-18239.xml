Hennell states that the attack failed and that the resulting skirmish led to the deaths of ten men from Bushire, eight of whom were killed after they had surrendered. Hennell reports that the Tungistoon forces deceived the men into surrendering before mutilating and burning their bodies. Also included with this letter is a translated abstract of a report from the Agent at Shiraz, covering the principal occurrences in that quarter between 26 January and 1 March 1850. The abstract includes details of Mahomed Kurreem Khan being despatched as Governor to Behbehan [Behbehān], where reportedly he was received with all honour and respect by Mirza Sultan Mahomed Khan, the Prince Governor.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051546.0x000018#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
