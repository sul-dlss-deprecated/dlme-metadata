C i *5^^I*! , Ur. Hlghwood•s aaln proposal is to set up an institute in Bahrain which would eventually become a cultural and educational Centre for the whole Gulf. He hopes that financial support for this can be obtained fro* the Bahrain Government, the local merchants and the Oil Company. I agree with Mr. Belgrave that there is little hope of obtaining contributions fro* the Bahrain merchants towards a scheme of this kind. The Bahrain Government might or might not assist and this would depend very largely on the personal attitude of the Shaikh. So far as the Oil Company 4e are concerned, I am consldarlng the extent to which they should be urged to assist in local social and cultural developments on the basis of s separate note which has been prepared by Mr. High- wood. I consider that in any case our first object should be to * persuade them to take a bigger interest in the Technical School at Bahrain and I am a little doubtful whether they would be willing to aeslet in the setting up of an institute, the object of which can be described as partly political. 3* My own view is that Mr. Highwood's scheme is somewhat ambitious and expensive, end that we should start more modestly. 1 would accordingly advocate that the British Council should offer to find s British teacher as Principal of a local teachers' train ing centre and to contribute a substantial proportion of his pay. Ha would work In subordination to the Director of Education who is s Bahraini, and in addition to administering the training centre ^ should give instruction in English at the Secondary School. He should also set as Adviser to the Political Kesldent in educational matters and pay an occasional visit to Kuwait and possibly other Gulf States. I have discussed this proposal with Mr. Belgrave who welcomes it end thinks he could persuade the Shaikh to agree to it and to contribute to its cost. He said that for some time he had been thinking of obtaining the services of a British teacher owing to the bed accent which the boys who are learning English are acquiring from their present masters. In 1946 the Bahrein Government applied for the services of s British headmaster for the Secondary School as well as for those of s British Director of Education. In the controversy that followed regarding the latter appointment the fact that the services of s British headmaster had also been applied for appears to have been forgotten. Mr. Belgrave informs me that a flat is svsllsbls for s British teacher if one Is appointed. 4. I think it may take some time to establish s teachers 9 training centre on the right lines. At present the Bahrain Government have a class of about eight students under training as teachers in s room In the Secondary School. These students started their training about a yaar a*go and no fresh recruits have The Bt. Hon. Ernest Bevln, M.P., •tc. etc. etc., The Foreign Office. bHITEHAU., /been.••» 2 b##n forthcoming since. Boys from the primary schools can obtaif •mploymont at Bs.200 or 300 a month in Saudi Arabia and it is not surprising that in thoso circumstances candidates for the ill* paid teachers 9 profession are fern and a far between. Mr. Belgrade thinks however that if an English Principal Is made available more candidates will present themselves. 4. 1 accordingly recommend that a British Council officer should be made available to hold the appointment of Principal of the Bahrain training School. Be should I think be a man of about 30 and should possess some knowledge of Arabic. If the British Council can produce a suitable candidate and will advise me what he should be paid and how much they are ellllng to contri bute 1 will enquire whether the Bahrain Government are willing to meet the rest of his salary. To begin with be will find only a small class to Instruct and no separate building at his disposal. It will be for him gradually to put the training cantra on a proper footing to persuade the Bahrain Government to provide proper accommodation for it which I think they will be willing to i do. Meanwhlld he can devote much time to giving instructions in English to the scondary school f and can also give lectures on English culture and cognate subjr'ta to those of the public who know Engllsh f and perhaps organise Instruction classes in English for youths who have left school. The schools In Bahrain are closed from the end of June to the end of September and hit services should if possible be made available not later than the 20th September next. 6. If a training centre under a British Principal is established on the lines proposed there is a possibility that in spite of the jealousy with which Bahrain's position in the Gulf is regarded f other Gulf States will be willing to send students to it for training! as thera is a general desire to replace the Egyptian, Syrian and Palestinian teachers who are at present employed with local men. It is also possible that if the right type of man can be found for the position of Principal and he can stay long enough, he may be able in due course to build up some* thing in the nature of the cultural and educational centre for the whole Gulf envisaged by Ur. Hlghwood. 6. 1 have urged more than once that this Besldency should be provided with an officer who would combine the functions of an Educational Adviser and Information Officer. The work of the British Cemncil and Information Organisations, if I may be permit ted to say so, appear to overlap and in our backward Gulf States with their small populations I think both functions might well be combined in one man. If, therefore, a British Council officer is appointed to Bahrain, I would suggest that he should take over responsibility for information work In Bahrain (but not in tha Gulf as a whols) and that in particular he should counter the subversive political Influences which are at present at work in the Manamah and Muharraq Clubs c.f. tha last sub paragraph undar (a) in Mr. Blghwood’s general report. Alternatively if it is decided that the spread of British propaganda is more Important than that of British culture, a British Information Officer should be provided, who, in addition to his normal functions would take an Interest in the schools and with the consent of the local authorities give lessons in English both in the training centra and secondary school st Bahrain. 7. Apart from the above, I agree generally with Mr. High* wood's remarks and proposals. In particular I consider that the Bahrain Petroleum Company should be asked to assist in tha Improvement of tha Technical School and 1 hope to taka the matter up with them in due course. It will be seen from Mr. Belgrade's comments that Mr. Hlghwood's suggestion that Mr. Ahmad 'Omran should be confirmed as Director of Education has already been implemented. I would call attention to the Shaikh of Bahrain's /attitude...3 attltuto towards education as deserlbed in the penultimate sentence of paragraph 3 of Mr* Belgrade 9 s letter* His Highness has becone extremely apprehensive as a result of the part played by students in the deaonstratlons in Bahrain In December and the prominent part they are taking In polities In Iraq* Egypt and elsewhere and Is anxious to exercise a careful control over further educational progress* 8* So far as Kuwait Is concerned I have little to say* The Oil Company propose to set up some kind of a technical school on their own and apart from this are too busy with their own rapid expansion to be asked to take a close Interest in local social and cultural developments for the present* With regard t&lt; the suggestion than an Englishman should give local lessons once or twice a week In English at the Secondary School an offer to do this by a British Council officer on leave from the Middle East Centre of Arab Studies has recently bean refused* It Is posslble 9 however, that If the ground Is carefully prepared a . similar offer by someone with whom the local educational authorities are personally acquainted might be accepted* 9* In conclusion I should like to pay a tribute to the extremely good work dene by Mr* Highwood during his stay In Bahrain and Kuwait* His reports on the local schools are extremely valuable and It Is to be hoped that the local educat ional authorities will be guided by the sound advice which ha has given them* In addition to hla visits to the Schools. Mr* High- wood* while he was In Bahrain* spent much time In meeting sad holding discussions with the local Intelligentala and visited the various clubs which have recently sprung up and as a result of this was able to furnish me with much useful information regard ing local political under-currents* I have the honour to be Sir, With great truth and respect Your most obedient humble servant, t W. /J.

D.0.No.C/R-139 POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN, Dated 4th August, 1948 Dear Colonel Galloway, ^ ‘ CLf ' Belgrave has written about a letter which he recently received from Highwood in which Highwood refers to 'Hay* s recommendations on my report' and has asked me to let him know what Sir Rupert Hay has recommended in respect of a British Headmaster for the Secondary School - a proposal ahfittt which Sir Rupert Hay had discussed with Belgrave. I was not present at this discussion nor did I hear about it until I received a copy of Sir Rupert Hay’s letter No.43, dated the 5th May, 1948, to starts at the beginning of October, to know to what stage the proposal for a 'British teacher' has arrived, and I should be grateful if you could find out from the Foreign Office what action has been taken on Sir Rupert Hay’s pro posal. It would, I think, be better for nothing to be done about it in London, as Belgrave thinks (and I entirely agree with him) that if any one is to get a British teacher to worK under the local Director of Education, Highwood is the man to do so. Another consideration is that the Shaikh will have to be consulted before any such appointment is made and so far no one seems to have mentioned it to him 4 at all. The same applies to the appointment of a Principal for the Bahrain Training School which was proposed in paragraph 4 of Sir Rupert Hay’s letter. th e Ernest Bevin levant.

You will see that the Council, while they are unable to undertake any financial responsibility for the post of principal of the proposed Training Centre, have offered their services should we wish to find a suitable man for the appointment, and have provided an estimate of the cost involved^ in filling the pose, I note from paragraph 2 of your Despatch No 0 43 that you regard it as most unlikely that the necessary funds will be found from the Bahrain merchants, and I shall be interested to hear whether you consider that an approach to the Shaikh would now be justified, on the understanding that the salary of the new Principal would be paid entirely by the Bahrain Government. 3. I note from paragraph 2 of your Despatch No. 43 that you are considering the extent to which the Oil Company be urged^ to assist in local cultural developments, and I await your views on this possibility. 4. You will see from paragraph 5 of my letter of the 22nd June that we do not share the view that one man should combine the duties of education Adviser and Information Officer. The British Council is precluded from any form of political activity, and it would not be possible for them to be associated with the appointment of an educational Adviser, if his duties were also to include Information work. 5.

These documents constitute the observations for which Lees asked in his letter to Clinton Thomas, PG/s/l of the List April, but you will see from paragraph 2 of despatch No. 43 that Sir Rupert Hay has not yet sent us his considered opinion on the question of financial assistance from the oil Company for Highwood's projects, and I presume that we shall hear more from him on this subject. As regards Bahrain, you will see that there is little hope of obtaining any financial assistance from the local merchants. 3. Sir Rupert Hay recommends that we should make a beginning by find!** a suitable man to fill the post of Principal of the ' Training School, ^o take up fois appointment if possible by the 20th September. I wonder whether it might be possible to find a suitable candidate among the members of the Council’s overseas staff who have recently become redundant as a result of the recent economy' cuts, as we are doing in the case of a replacement*for Parker in Afghanistan. We shall have to decide also on the question of emoluments. In my letter to nees of the 3rd April, I said that I hoped that it would not be necessary for the Council to undertake any extra financial commitment in this area, and I still think that the desirable course, if it can be achieved, is to get the Bahrain Government to pay the new man's salary.. But we cannot count on this, and in that case it is for consideration whether the Council could provide a subsidy. We might perhaps consider an arrangement similar to that proposed in the case of the Adviser in Vocational Training for the Afghan government, namely that the Council should offer to put up one third of the total emoluments on the undertaking that the remaining two thirds were provided by the Bahrain Govern- ^ ment. The first step, .however, will be to decide what would be a suitable salary, and then to see how much the local government would contribute towards it. 4. I think we shall have to recognise that the Training College will have to be built up slowly, and that at the outset much of the work of the new Princiapl would have to be devoted to the teaching of English. This might be in conflict with the recommend ations on Education Policy which were reaffirmed at the meeting of the Executive Committee on the 13th April, but in the backward Gulf States there seems little to be gained by k trying to run before we can walk. As you will see from paragraph 5 of the despatch, Sir Rupert Hay is hopeful that, in time, the training centre might develop into an educational focus for the other Gulf States; but we shall have to be content with small beginnings. 5o I do not think we can support the suggestion in paragraph 6 that the Council's man should combine the duties of Principal of the Training College and of -Information Officer, but I agree that the right type of man would be able to do much to counter the influence of the political clubs in the area.As regards Kuwait, you will see from despatch No e 64 that we shall have to tread warily in making any move to introduce an Englishman to give regular lessons in English at the secondary school. It will obviously take time before we can*hope to bring about all the reforms which Highwood suggested, tfe should avoid, any appearance of interfering too frequently in the affiars^ of the Kuwait education Department, and I think that our most hopeful course would be for the new Council man at Bahrain to visit the State occasionally and build up a close acquaintance with the members of the Department before attempting to offer advice.THb BRITISH COUNCIL Ref: PG/701/2 3 Hanover Street, London. 20th July, 1948.

Your letter to Hussey of 22nd June, reference LG 1951/28 /451, with its enclosed copy of 8ir Rupert Hay 1 s‘Despatch No. 43 of 5th May and previous correspondence referring to High- Wood 1 s report on his visit to Bahrein last January have now been considered by all concerned in the Council. 2. It is agreed that the filling of the post of Principal of the Training School at Bahrain by a suitably qualified British teacher with some knowledge of Arabic, as recommended by Sir Rupert Hay, is the first object to aim at, but it has been decided with regret that the Council at this time cannot undertake the additional, financial commitments involved in subsidising this post, either fully or inpart. 3. V/e calculate that the total recurrent cost of such an anpointment would be about £ 2,200 p.a., assuming that the occupant would be a married man at a Council basic about the top of Grade III (about £ 590 p.a'.), with accommodation provided, cost of i of living allowance at 1S5 %, and leave fares for him and his wife every eighteen months, ^n additional non-recurrent expenditure of about £ 1,000 would be required on his’ appointment to cover installation grants and furniture, etc. 4. We should warn you that, even if the necessary funds are forthcoming, it will be difficult to find a suitable candidate for this post at' short notice, and we have no one among our redundant*staff at present whom we could recommend. 5. We are in complete agreement with all the points in your letter under reference as stated in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6, and though the Council cannot undertake any financial commitments it -would be very pleased to provide any advice and non-Iinan- ciai help within its power. 6. You will no doubt inform Sir Rupert Hay of the Council's views and calculations above, and we should be interested to hear his observations, particularly concerning the possibility of the Bahrain Government and/or the Oil Company undertaking the Xull cost of this post.

Colonel A.C. Galloway, CIE., OBE., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, BAHRAIN.—2— Confidential• Bahrain, November 13, 1948. D.O. No. P- ^ Last week I discussed with His Highness and Shaikh Abdullah the question of our employing a British teacher in the Secondary School and for^the young men who we have in a special class who are going to be school teachers. There are now 20 young men in this special class, about half of them have completed one term, of nine months, and the others have joined this class this year. This is a project which we regard as important, on itssuccess depends the possibility of our being able gradually to reduce the number of foreign masters. 2. I had discussed the proposal with Ahmed Omran, sometime ago, and ascertained that he was not opposed to it, though he did not regard it with much enthusiasm. I then spoke to Shaikh Abdullah about it. Shaikh Abdulla was strongly opposed to in any way sharing the services of an Education man. I had explained to him that we might either employ him as a full time official of the Bahrain Government or, perhaps, the British Government would contribute towards the pay provided that he occa sionally made trips to Kuwait and perhaps to Muscat. After some consideration Shaikh Abdullah agreed that it would be a good plan to have a British teacher for our schools provided that he spoke Arabic really well and was a suitable type. He stressed the need of Arabic and pointed out that lack of Arabic had been a very great disadvantage in the case of British Council men who were in the past working in the education department in Bahrain. Shaikh Abdullah and I then put up the matter to His Highness.3« His Highness very definitely did not approve of the proposal. He told us that he did not agree to the suggestion at present and that it was not now desirable to appoint another Englishman to the Education Department and to do so would be likely to cause trouble and to interrupt the smooth running of school affairs. Shaikh Abdullah then left. 4. His Highness discussed the matter further and said that the advantage to be gained by improving the teaching of English, and perhaps some other subjects, in the schools would not be worth the trouble which he felt that this innovation would cause. He implied that it would be unpopular both in the department and among the public. Later he sent for Ahmed Omran and spoke to him about the suggestion. From what I heard of the conversation, subsequently, I gather that His Highness referred to the difficulties which we have had in the administration of the schools which he regards to a great extent as a legacy from Wakelin. He also implied that therewould be adverse comment, locally, if a British teacher were given considerably better conditions, in the way of accommodation, furniture etc., than other non-European officials such as Egyptian head-masters. His Highness is obviously not disposed to agree to the suggestion at the present time. It is unfortunate because I believe that always provided that a suitable man could be found, the employment of a British teacher or head-master in our schools would stimulate progress.

Incidentally, Macmillan was strongly recommended to me by the British Council people, though I gather that he is a bit arty and crafty. He is about 40 and has, I believe, served in Egypt for 18 years. It will be necessary to pay him from £1100 to £1200 a year and provide him with free accomr odation. C.J. Pelly, Esq., O.B.E., Political Agent Bahrain.l Lx &amp; Copy of an extract of a note recorded by P.R. on the 23rd December, 1948, after discussion with the Shaikh of Bahrain on the 21st December, 1948. XXX XXX XXX 2. I also discussed the appointment principal of the teacher's training school, and gave the Shaikh particulars of our present candidate, Mr. Macmillan. I said that the principal would serve under the orders of the Bahraini Director of Education, and that if the Bahrain Government defrayed the whole cost of his employment, his services would be entirely at his disposal, but that if H.M.G. contributed towards his pay, then we would expect to be able to avail our selves of his services to inspect schools in other Gulf v States. The Shaikh took notes but did not commit himself. xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx of a British- PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY, BAHRAIN, 19th March, 1949. (64/20/49) r I enclose herewith a copy of a letter I have written to Barrows on the subject of a British Principal for the Teachers' Training School at Bahrain. I should be grateful if you could kindly get Belgrave to confirm that the position is as stated in paragraph 3 in order that we may endeavour to find a suitable man for the appointment. C.J. Pelly, Esq., C.B.E., political.Agent, Bahrain. Confidential. BAHRAIN RT 'EIPT;PEHSXAH GULF HESIDENCY, ! BAHRAIN, 19th March, 1949, (64/22/49) Please refer to my letter 18/6/48 of the 22nd October 1948 to Stewart on the subject of a British Principal for the proposed Teachers* Training Centre in Bahrain. 2. I have had several talks with the Shaikh and Belgrave on this subject. They have made enquiries about Macmillan, compare enclosure to Foreign Office despatch No.42 (LC.3475/28/452) of the 11th September 1948, and for some reason or other are not willing to employ him. I am accordingly informing Wakelin direct that his services will not be required. 3. I believe the Bahrain Government ate now willing to employ a British teacher whose functions will not be confined to the Training Centre on the understanding that he will act in subordination to their Director of Education and that they would prefer to pay his whole salary and have the benefit of his whole-time services rather than to share him with the Residency, and I am endeavouring to get this confirmed. In these circumstances, we shall have to rely on the British Council represen tative at Basra for advice in educational matters, c.f. the Foreign Office despatch referred to ^abev in paragraph 2 above, and I consider that this arrangement will meet our needs at any rate for the time being. B.A.B. Burrows, Esq., Foreign Office, London.S.O.Mo. C./&amp;-iz(, V 1 Dear Sir Rupert, POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN, Dated 5th April, 1949. C !5&gt; I spoke to Belgrave or* the sujzrject of your semi-official letter No. (64/20/49)', dated the 19th March, 1949, and he told me that neither the Shaikh, Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa, nor Ahmad Omran is at all keen on employing a British teacher; though Belgrave himself, I think, would like to have one in order to try and improve the English taught in the local schools.
