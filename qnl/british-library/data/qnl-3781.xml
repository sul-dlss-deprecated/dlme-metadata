The letter then goes in to details on the Omman [Oman] tribes who have been brought together by the Sultan during this crisis, the politics of, and limits to, their allegience and concerns they may be contributing to Wahabee coastal raids. Pelly also describes his attempts to travel to the hill regions of Omman, which were thwarted by his guides and the local tribe leaders who refuse to travel there and believe that the Sultan has no authority over those areas.The letter concludes with the suggestion that if the Sultan is succesful in preventing the Wahabee expansion on land and sea, and in so doing strengthens his own position, the British Government may wish to review and amend their agreements with the Sultanate.Enclosed with the letter are five letters of correspondence with local rulers and the Captain of the
