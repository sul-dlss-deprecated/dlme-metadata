Dispute between His Majesty^ Government in the United Kingdom and the Imperial Government of Persia in regard to the Concession held by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. Mirza Abol-Hassan Khan Foroughi, representative of Persia, came to the Council table. M.Benes presented the following report: 'At its meeting on May 26th,1933, the Council considered the communication from the Persian Government, dated May 1st, announcing that, as the outcome of the negotiations undertaken at Tehran with the representatives of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, a new concession had been signed by the company and the Imperial Government of Persia. The Rapporteur was able to add on this occasion that, having got into touch with the two parties to the dispute, he had found that, as a result of the signature of the new concession, the dispute between the two Governments might be regarded as virtually settled. As, however, the Council was soon about to disperse, the Rapporteur begged it to give him an opportunity, at its next ordinary session, of submitting to it a report on the complete and final liquidation of the dispute. 'Since then, there has been another communication from the Persian Government,dated June 5th (document C.371.M.182.1933. VII), announcing that the Persian Parliament has ratified the new concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. 'The text of the new concession is appended to this report (Annex 1467). 'In these circumstances, I am happy to say that the Council may take it that the dispute between His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom and the Imperial Government of Persia, which/which was 'brought 'before it last December, is now finally settled, 11 Mirza Abol-Hassan Khan FOROUGHI, representative of Persia.- I have the honour to announce my Governments entire approval of the report placed before the Council. I have nothing further to add. I wish merely to express my happiness at having had this opportunity of making before the Council a statement testifying to the better relations between my Government and that of His Britannic Majesty. I cannot fail to renew the expression of gratitude tendered by my predecessor to the Council in connection with this incident nor to offer our warm thanks to the Rapporteur, M.Benes, and to the Secretary General for all the trouble they have taken and the impartiality they have shown. Sir John Simon.- I am very happy to be able to join with the representative of Persia in expressing, on behalf of my Government, our satisfaction that this troublesome matter has been brought to a complete agreement, and, at the same time, to join in thanking the Rapporteur, M.Benes, for the useful part which he has played in bringing about and reporting that result. My colleagues will recall that it was my duty some time ago to bring this matter before the Council, and that the points of view of the Government of the United Kingdom and that of Persia were then put before the Council. At that time, it was still uncertain whether agreement could be reached by the method which is consecrated for use in such cases when Governments are not at one here at Geneva. I take great satisfaction in thinking that the action of the United Kingdom Government in bringing the matter to the Council has resulted in an agreement which is both complete in itself and expresses the continued good relations which, I am sure, will always exist between the Government of Persia and the Government of the United Kingdom. The Council took note of the Rapporteurs rej^ort. (The Council went into private session.)(T' -- i 5 d ; u ^ _ ne Residency, l 193 0 3ushi re, the 15th August,1933. S.O.No.lOSl-3 of 1933. ' ijUw Z.

Sir, Mr. Hoare to Sir John Simon.—[Received June 20.) Gulhek, June 3, 1933 I HAVE the honour to report that the new Anglo-Persian Oil Company Agreement passed its first reading in the Majlis on the 23rd May, having previously been passed by the National Economy, Budget and Foreign Affairs Committees. The second reading took place on*the 28th May and was passed by a vote of 105 out of 113 Deputies present. There was no debate, but at the suggestion of one of the Deputies an amendment was made in the translation of a word in article 15 (2). I am endeavouring to obtain a copy of the law ratifying the agreement as passed by the Majlis, but I have not 'been able to procure one in time for this bag. 2. The law and the agreement were approved by the Shah on the 29th May. 3. On the occasion of the first reading there was a certain amount of discussion, and I enclose a brief summary of the proceedings, together with a translation of the table of statistics furnished by the Minister of Finance. 4. This table shows a surprising correspondence in many years between the profit which would have been available for the Persian Government under the present agreement and that which they actually received under the D’Arcy Concession. In some years the royalty under the concession is even the greater. Roughly speaking, the wider the disproportion between the oil exported and the profit made upon it, the greater the benefit accruing to the Persian Government under the new agreement. The difference is particularly striking in very bad years, such as 1931, when the payment of the royalty on tonnage would have deprived—and in a sense will deprive owing to article 23—the shareholders of any profit at all and involved an actual loss on the year’s working, as the 'New Statesman, in the issue of the 13th May, has not been slow to point out. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s consul at Ahwaz (No. 44) I have, &amp;c. R. H. HOARE. Enclosure in No. 1. Extract from the Newspaper Iran of May 24, 1933. Anglo-Persian Oil Company New Agreement. THE new agreement was submitted yesterday, the 23rd May, to Parliament. In preliminary debates on the general aspect the following points were raised : 1. Kashef stated that the privilege granted to the company under section 1 of article 6 to import necessities without special permits will weaken the effect of the Foreign Trade Monopoly Act, and it should be limited to the import of essential commodities only for the company’s foreign staff. The Minister of Finance gave assurances that care will be exercised to limit such imports to goods required by the company’s foreign staff, and pointed out that imports effected with foreign capital do not prejudice the trade monopoly. 2. Referring to the exploitation of oil in Kermanshah, Mehda\i enquired what steps would be taken if the company failed to immediately execute their undertaking. In such a case, reference to arbitration would not remedy the loss of revenue to the public even if the company were forced to pay indemnity of 5 million (rials). [831 u—3]The Minister of Finance explained that in agreements it is impossible to make provisions for each and every article. When one party fails to fulfil an agreement it commits a breach. But the company will not fail to execute the undertaking, and, in fact, five or six days after signature of the agreement, we received a telegram to the effect that the Khaniqin Oil Company’s general manager had started to make necessary arrangements. The terms of the agreement were then discussed. The Minister of Finance, in reply to a query from Dr. Taheri, gave the quantities of oil exploited between 1925 to 1932 inclusive, and a comparative table showing Persia’s royalty under the D’Arcy Concession and what it would have been under the new agreement. Replying to a question by Kashef as to whether the question of revision of article 11 will be submitted for approval by the Majlis at the end of thirty years, the Minister of Finance declared that nothing will be done without Parliament’s approval. Mer’at asked whether dividends derived from the 20,000 shares belonging to Government are distinct from the royalty question or not. The Minister of Finance explained that dividends are added to the budget and have no connexion with royalty accounts. Dr. Taheri proposed deletion of article 27 as the agreement is being ratified by Parliament. The speaker suggested ratification of the agreement under a single article to be drafted for the second reading.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOYERNMENT P.Z. PERSIA.

Sir, WITH reference to Mr. Hoare’s despatch No. 260 of the 3rd June respecting the ratification of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s agreement, I have the honour to report that this agreement was passed by the Majlis on the 28th May in yroyria persona, so to speak, without any covering Bill. 2. A Persian translation duly appeared in the Proceedings of the Majlis for the 28th May (issue No. 18) with the following heading :— “Law (‘ Qanun ’). “The Grant of an Oil Concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (Limited). “ Concessionary Agreement granted by the Imperial Persian Government to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (Limited) on April 29, 1933. “ Preamble. “ With the object of establishing a new concession, &amp;c., &amp;c ” 3. At the end of the Persian translation followed an additional clause:— “ This concession, which consists of twenty-seven articles, was sanctioned by the National Consultative Assembly in its session of the 7th day of the month of Khordad of the solar year 1312 (the 28th May, 1933). President of the Majlis : 4. Issue No. 18 of the Proceedings of the Majlis actually contains two Persian translations. The first is that which was read out article by article to the Deputies and is interspersed with their remarks. The second is the formal text. 5. No text has yet appeared in the Official Gazette of the Ministry of Justice. 6. It is worth noting that the official French text given to the press on the 16th May by the Ministry of Finance was headed “ Convention de Concession.’’ A French text printed for the Majlis before the first reading was headed “ Projet de Concession.” The Persian translation in the Proceedings of the Majlis, as quoted above, is headed “ Concession ” in one place, “ Concessionary Agreement ” in another. I suggest that “ agreement ” is the word which we should use on all occasions, official and unofficial, as this term is more appropriate than “ concession ” in view of the circumstances in which the instrument was signed.

[E 2658/17/34] Mr. Hoare to Sir John Simon.—(Received May 22.) (No. 220.) Sir, Tehran, May 6, 1933. I HAVE the honour to submit a brief report on the negotiations for the renewal of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s concession. Full details of a highly interesting, and even dramatic, episode will be furnished to you by Sir John Cadman when he reaches London, together with the text of the agreement as finally signed. 2. Sir John Cadman, accompanied by Mr. P. G. Allen, his private secretary, arrived in Tehran by air from Bagdad on the 3rd April, having previously visited the oil-fields. He had been delayed by bad weather for some days, and the state of the weather had also constrained his travelling companions, Mr. W. Fraser, the deputy chairman of the company, and Dr. W. Young, the company’s principal medical officer, to make the journey by road. Dr. W. Idelson, tne international jurist, Mr. Duncan Anderson, the company’s chief accountant, and Mr. L. X. Lefroy, of the staff of the London office, had arrived a few days previously. 3. The Persian Government for their part had not failed to provide themselves with an array of experts, and there arrived in Tehran about the same time Dr. Hengeler, a Swiss lawyer of some repute, Mr. F. Clapp, who is described as an “ oil expert,” and was in the employment of the Persian Government in that capacity a few years ago, Mr. G. Inchbald, of the firm of Messrs. William McClintock and Co., the chartered accountants, and Mr. Kessan, another lawyer. These experts were kept severely in the background and, indeed, hardly consulted, and apparently, as the result of orders from the Shah himself, it was decided that they should not he present at the negotiations; they had a dreary time, as they were entirely segregated from all foreign society while the negotiations lasted. 4. The negotiations were conducted by Mr. Fraser and Mr. Jacks.^ the resident director, on behalf of the company, and by Mirza Seyed Hassan Khan Taghizadeh, the Minister of Finance, Mirza Mohamed Ali Khan Feroughi. Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mirza Ali Akber Khan Davar, Minister of Justice, and Mirza Hossein Khan Ala, on behalf of the Persian Government. The first few days were spent in extracting from the Persian negotiators a statement of their desiderata, which for some reason were still in an embryonic state, and Mr. Fraser firmly declined to embark upon any discussion of individual points until assured that the whole of these desiderata had been stated. The Persian demands proved eventually to consist of more than sixteen points, far more fantastic in their scope and variety than the famous ten points communicated to the company’s representatives in Paris in February. 5. The Persian case was finally completed on the 17th April, and on the following days JxAvas subjected by Mr. Fraser to a lengthy and reasoned criticism. In the words of Ala, he tore the sixteen points to shreds one after the other, and made it clear that they were entirely unacceptable and that no agreement could possibly be based upon them. At the request of the Persian Ministers themselves, the company’s reply was embodied in a memorandum which was communicated to them on the 21st April and was virtually a diaft of a new concession. 6. After this memorandum had been discussed the Persian Ministers stated that an agreement on the basis of the company’s draft was quite impossible, and it was agreed on the 22nd April to inform the press that the negotiations hac failed. At Sir John Cadman’s request, Feroughi immediately asked the Shall to receive him in a farewell audience, which took place the next morning (t le 23rd April) at 10 a.m. It was, perhaps, not a pure coincidence that Sir John s aeroplane was plainly visible from the Palace windows engaged in a trial nig t. However this may be, the Shah treated as a joke the statement that the Angjo- Persian Oil Company representatives were leaving the next morning, me [803 y—1]2 V interview was a brilliant success, and Sir John convinced His Imperial Majesty that neither the Anglo-Persian Oil Company nor any other oil company could possibly exploit the Persian oil-fields on the basis of the Persian proposals, and made such an impression that the Shah, to Feroughi's dismay, consented to be present at the next meeting between the Persian and British negotiators. 7. At this meeting the Shah consigned the Persian proposals to the wastes paper basket and gave his Ministers, to their considerable embarrassment, a good-humoured homily, the burden of which was that they, poor earth-worms, had worked away at the details of the dispute and had done their duty in approaching the question from the strictly Persian point of view and in battling to the utmost for every Persian claim. But he, who understood foreign politics, appreciating the need for Anglo-Persian friendship, had decided that the new concession must be based not on mere technicalities, but on broad statesmanship, and had concluded that the proposals of the company would provide a solution of lasting benefit to both sides. He was exceedingly friendly and reasonable throughout the discussion that ensued, and Sir John Cadman was greatly struck bv the quickness with which he grasped the point of an argument. 8. With one or two exceptions, all outstanding points were settled at this meeting, and it w*as hoped that it would be possible to sign a final text of the concession on the following day. It unfortunately proved impossible to complete the work of drafting in the time allotted. When the postponed meeting next took place further points were raised by the Persian negotiators, but thev gave wav vvhen Sir John Cadman threatened a further appeal to the Shah instead of the foi MazandtrTn 6 ^ a ready arran g ed prior to the Shah’s departure 2.90 9 a Qni fti ? g ?P cll P ied a further two days, and it was not until 2 20 am on the 30th April that the agreement was finally signed.

Foreign Office to Mr. Cadogan (Geneva). (No. 342. Confidential.) Sir, Foreign Office, May 19, 1933. WITH reference to Mr. Hoare’s telegram No. 95 of the 8 th May (repeated to you as Foreign Office telegram No. 220 of the same date) regarding the agreement reached in Tehran between the Persian Government and the repre sentatives of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to transmit to you the accompanying^ copies of the French text and of the company’s (provisional) English translation of the new concession which has been granted to the company.f 1 ) 2 . The text of the concession is now before a parliamentary commission of the Persian Majlis. It appears that discussion of its terms by the Majlis as a whole has been adjourned until the 21 st May at the earliest, and it is, therefore, very unlikely that it will be finally ratified and promulgated by the Shah by the time the Council of the League of Nations meets on the following day. According to a later telegram from His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, it appears that the Persian Government have now published the full text of the new concession both in Persian and French, but the company are, nevertheless, most anxious that, until the agreement has actually been ratified, any general discussion of its terms should be avoided as far as possible. I am to request, however, that you will now deliver two copies of the French text and of the English translation to M. Benes, in accordance with the promise which has already been made to him (see Foreign Office telegram No. 13 of the 2 nd May to His Majesty’s Minister at Prague repeated to you as No. 13, Saving, of the same date), explaining orally at the same time the desire of the company to keep the text as far as possible secret pending ratification. 3. The procedure to be followed when the Council meets will, of course, depend largely on the rapidity with wdiich the agreement is ratified by the Majlis. As you are aw T are, the dispute is due to come before the Council during the present session, and will automatically do so unless His Majesty’s Government and the Persian Government agree to make a joint request for postponement. If the agreement is ratified, and the necessary decree promulgated by the Shah, in the course of the week beginning on the 22 nd May, it will presumably be possible to dispose of the question finally during the present session, the rapporteur informing the Council that a settlement has been reached between the two Governments, and the necessary statement prescribed by article 15 ( 3 ) of the Covenant being drawn up thereafter. If, on the other hand, the requisite action is not taken in time by the Persian Parliament and by the Shah, it will presumably be necessary either to concert with the Persian Government with a view to a joint request being made for postponement of the question until the following session of the Council, or, alternatively, to arrange for M. Benes to inform the Council that he understands that a settlement has been reached, but that as certain necessary formalities are still outstanding he will be glad if the question can be postponed. 4. As you are aware from Mr. Hoare’s telegram No. 95 referred to above, the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs has promised to instruct the Persian delegate at Geneva to concert with you on the question of further procedure. I am to request, therefore, that you will discuss the question both with M. Benes and with M. Sepahbodi, and adopt whatever arrangements appear most suitable m the circumstances, reporting the action you decide to take in due course. I am, &amp;c. C. F. A. WARNER.

There has beer no press comment of any kind until (a) May 13th when a cartoon appeared in 'Nahid' a comic paper of no particular importance. Underlying idea is that 1 ersia gave original concession with her eyes shut but new one with her eyes open. As a consequence it has been ill-received in London. (b) May 14th when a long description \r.n. defence of new agreement appeared in 'Messager'. It is probably by Minister of Justice and is decidedly friendly in tone. It naturally tries to prove that Persia has made a good bargain but states both sides have had to make concessions and that most satisfactory feature of agreement is that both sides are satisfied and that cordial relations have been restored with Great Britain. Description seams to contain some inaccuracies but as neither I nor Company’s Tehran office have text of new agreement I cannot offer further comment*. Copy by bag.

New agreement which was signed late on April29th is reported to have been approved by Council of Ministers and is expected to come before Persian Parliament for ratifica tion within next fortnight* Chairman of Company was anxious that precise terms of agreement should not be divulged pending ratifica tion, but His Majesty’s Government had contemplated arranging with Persian Government jointly to communicate to .M.Benes, for his confidential information,full text of agreement as soon as it should be available. Mean while general lines of agreement as telegraphed by Sir J.Cadman were being treated here as confidential. His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran now reports that Persian Government has communicated text of agreement to Persian press and Tehran correspondents of English press have telegraphed summary which has appeared in somewhat misleading form in London papers of May 2nd* Full and accurate text is unlikely to be available before Sir J.Cadman’s arrival in England on May 15th and will then be formally communicated by His Majesty’s Government,if possible jointly with Persian Government, to M 0 Benes in order that he may take appropriate action* In the opinion of the Chairman agreement is most satisfactory*..satisfactory to both parties, and should 'open up a new era in the relations between the Company and the Persian Government'. Fact that it has been possible to reach such direct agreement so successfully is due very largely to most skilful manner in which question was handled in its initial stages by M,Benes,and His Majesty's Government wish to take this oppor tunity to express their warm gratitude to him for the important part ho has played in securing this most satisfactory result.

(U ^ SHEW -L COMMITTEE, Previous Paper# :— I understand that the suinnary of the A.P.O.C. agreement reproduced in yesterday's rt Times rt is inaccurate in material details.. It appears that the Persian Press is (no douht under instructions) doing its utmost to emphasise the'victory which the terms of the agreement represent for Persia and that the information in the ,, Times rt comes from Persian sources and is accordingly coloured to our prejudice. Sir John Gadman is particularly anxious that nothing should be done to disturb this impression and will,I gather, welcome a series of attacks on the unsatisfactory terms of the agreement in this/ 5041 2000 1.31this country which will help to coni'inn the Persians in their impression that they have done very well. The Foreign Office are not altogether satisfied, on the other hand, that in the general interests of British prestige some corrective, such as the publication of the actual terms of the agreement, should not be administered without delay* The terms of the agreement are not yet available. There seems, however, no Question that the Company has secured the point to which they have always attached the greatest importance, viz. a further extension of their concession for a substantial period, for the new concession will run to 1993, whereas the d’Arcy Concession wasuue to expire in 1964. Until full details *re available it is difficult to estimate the importance of the points on which they have had to yield, but even discounting to some extent tne statement in the •Times' it seems probable that they are by no means unimportant. This will ue particularly the case if the report is correct that the area of their concession has been substantially reaucea ana that they have lost the exclusive right to pipelines. now that this dispute has been- cleared away tne Foreign Office may wish to revive the Question our general negotiations with Persia. ^ text of miscnievous article m the 'Daily Herald- on this Point, suosequently officially contradicted both by : ;f he *'“*■* 0If *« * ». ^tioa in London, in antacneo. .so t a r aa tll e India cmcaFil.^ copy p.z. /V In any further communication on thysubjec/please quo^ r* ^ Q no. £ ia £f/o /OHO ~ - an d address —not to any person by flame, but to— ~“ “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W.

New agreement, which has been approved by Ministers and was signed on April 30th, is expected to come before Persian Parliament for ratification within next fortnight, and Chairman of Company is anxious that its precise terns should until then be regarded as confidential. Chairman is expected in England on May 15th and we contemplate then formally com municating (probably jointly with Persian Government) full terms of new agreement to M. Benes in order that he may take appropriate action. Agreement appears most satisfac tory to both parties and in the opinion of Chairman should open up new era in the relations between the Company and the Persian Government. Fact that it has been possible to reach such direct agreement so successfully is due very largely to skilful manner in which question was handled in its initial stages by M. Benes, and Kls Majesty's Govern ment wish to take this opportunity to express their grati tude to him for his share in securing this most satis factory result.Extract from “DAILY HERALD” dated ANGLO-PERSIAN TO PAY £2,000,000? ‘ BACK DEBTS ’ CLAUSE IN AGREEMENT From Our Own Correspondent BASRA (Iraq), Monday. Details of the agreement between the Shah of Persia and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, reported here to-day, re veal that the company is said to be going to pay £2,000.000 of back debts to Persia. It is to pay in the future a royalty of 4s. a ton on a minimum of 5,000,000 tons every year.11a-MAY 1933 Extract from “ DAILY HERALD ** dated lemier r 3T WATER ;ni5Ler from CLAIM AND ‘FUI Coming Here to Negotiate OIL PACT PAVES WAY FOR “FRIENDSHIP” ♦ From Our Diplomatic Correspondent A N Anglo- Persian I treaty, which will bring Persia definitely into the British “sphere of influence,” is likely to follow on the conclusion of the Anglo-Persian oil agreement. The Shah, I understand, has agreed to send either his Minister of Foreign Affairs or his Minister of Justice to London to negotiate a Treaty of Friendship, Com merce and Non-Aggression.” And, at the same time, he is expected to take strong measures to check the development of Russo-Persian trade relations and- - any development of Russian in fluence in Northern Persia. THE NEW TREATY The new Treaty, it is expecte will provide:— (DA mutual pact of non-aggre sion and guaranteed security. (2) General diplomatic co-operation. (3) Facilities for British air route and, possibly, a railway, linking Iraq with India. (4) Co-opera tion between Great Britain and Persia in the “ policing ” of the Persian Gulf. 1 (5) P r eference for British sub jects in all econo mic concessions in Persia, and for British banks in the floating of all loans. (6) British as sistance in re organising the Persian army and air force, and, in particu lar, the defences on the Russian border. (7) The purchase of large quant of military equipment in Great Briti Shah of Persia PREFERENCE TO BRITAIN The anti-Soviet character of the plan is fairly obvious. An4, with the diplo matic treaty, is to go a commercial treaty giving preferen tial treatment to British and Indian trade, which would involve the cancellation of the existing Russo-Persian agreement and, perhaps, special measures directed against Russian trade on the ground of “ dumping.” , To obtain a treaty of this sort, exclud ing Russian influence from Persia and making British influence do minant there, 1 has been a ' diplomatic objective ” ever since the Revolution put an end to the 1907 arrangement by which Persia was partitioned into British and Russian ‘‘ spheres of influence.” At the end of the war, large areas of Persia were under British military con trol, and enormous sums of money had been spent in converting Persian officials to a favourable view of British influence. In 1919, the Persian Government was induced to sign a treaty which provided for the appointment of British “ ad visers ” in all branches of the Persian Government, including the army, for Bri tish co-operation in the economic deve lopment of the country, and the like. But a wave of popular opinion against an arrangement which was re garded as reducing Persia to the status of Egypt overthrew the Government, and started the series of revolutions and coups d’etat that brought Riza Khan to the throne. Riza was supposed to be pro-British and anti-Russian; but a whole series ot disputes broke out between him and various British authorities, who found him far less amenable than had been hoped. Now the prospect ct far more profit able relations with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company—coupled with his very j difficult financial situation—has ap parently converted him to a belief in the necessity for complete co-opera tion with the British Government. And on the economic basis of the new oil agreement, diplomacy has been able to build up a new alliance which closes the gap in the British “ system ” of mandates and alliances, which stretches from Tripoli to the borders of India.

Jiarch 11th 1933. Sir, The Pereian Preee during the past fortnight has contained few references to the oil dispute. Sir John Cadaan’s departure from London on his way to Tehran has duly been announced; no definite statement as to the return of the Persian delegates to Tehran has however been seen in the press, and rumours have not b'en lacking that Dsvar and Ala are too frightened of their reception to return at all. A similar story concerning Ali Quli Khan Ansari was however proved to be false by the ex-minister 1 s return to Tehran at the end of February, which was duly announced in the Press. 2. The ,f Ittil&amp;’&amp;t w of the 25th and E6th February publishes four columns of translation of a radio speech broadcast by the Minister of Justice Davar frou* Geneva at 10 p.m. on Wednesday the 2oth January. The discourse follows the usual lines developed in the Persian memoranda to the League. A historical sketch of recent history of Persia is first given, beginning from the Anglo-Kuesian Convention of 1907. The various offences of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company are set forth on familiar lines. The argument about the Finnish ships is elaborated; though no mention is made of the 'legal decision' ? of the Majlis approving the cancellation of the concession. 3. The 'Kooshish' of the 28th February has a front-page article named 'The British Secret Service', translated from a Swiss paper named apparently the 'Courier de Voie' of the 9th Right Honourable 3ir John Simon G.C.S.I., otc., etc., etc., FOREIGN OFFICE.-2 9th February. The object of the writer appear® to be to show how omniscient and ubiquitous the British Secret Service is, and how its agents were successful in manipulating the Anglo- Persian Oil Company concession. 4. The ’♦Iran’* of the 1st March has a long article from the pen of Professor Arthur Uphain l ope* describing in very complim entary terms the state of civilization of ancient Persia. The 'Ittil&amp;’^t* of the same date continues a series of translated articles concerning ’•The oil war', referring to the world’s struggles for oil; and the 'Shafaq* of that day concludes a aeries of articles by a Persian named Dashti concerning the geology of the southern oil area. 5. During the next three days all Tehran newspapers allotted all available space to very detailed reports of the H cause c6l&amp;bre H of Mirza Abdul Hussein Khan iba and of his accomplice. The various arguments put forward by the advocates of the accused, and by the Public Prosecutor, were quoted in full* together with the exact text of the long judgment of the court. The whole proceedings, which were public, were entirely in legal form; and the courts judgment, condemning Dlba to ten months’ correctional imprisonment for false pretences in accepting a bribe, and his accomplice Mushar-i-Muazzam 8a*aaien to four months for aiding and abetting him, was izmt ± e-&gt; appealed against. 6.

CONFIDENTIAL March 7. 1933 Section 1. [E 1234/17/34] No. 1. Mr. Hoare to Sir John Simon.—(Received March 7.) (No. 70.) SL, Tehran, February 20, 1933. AS I have reported by telegram, His Imperial Majesty the Shah received me yesterday morning, in order that Lieutenant-Colonel Dodd might take his leave of His Majesty on the termination of his appointment as military attache to this Legation. The Shah, with good-humoured earnestness, expressed the hope that Colonel Dodd would resume normal military duties, indicating that, in his experience, true happiness was only to be found in the ranks of the army. Colonel Dodd replied suitably, and the Shah wished him good-bye, saying that in wishing him all prosperity, his good wishes included the British army. 2. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, who interpreted, had told me that His Majesty wished to have a talk with me, and tea and cigarettes were then brought in. 3. His Majesty began the conversation a little unsuccessfully by suggesting that this was my first winter here. We then compared this winter with last, and I hazarded the suggestion that the mildness of this winter was responsible for the epidemic of influenza; I was glad to think that His Majesty had quite recovered from his attack. His Majesty’s health and the mention of winter served as an introduction to an enquiry after the Valiahd and whether he was keen on winter sports. His Majesty’s reply was to the effect that he was afraid that he was too keen and might damage himself skiing. And this led me to aeroplanes via Mr. Buckingham, who is now here, having delivered the Tiger Moth aeroplanes recently acquired by the Persian Government, and who is a first-rate performer on skis. His Majesty said that he was very pleased with these machines, and mentioned the loss of one through the incompetence of the pilot, and suggested that it would be a good advertisement for the company to replace it. I replied that I would repeat his words to Mr. Buckingham, expressed my gratification at His Majesty’s satisfaction with the machines, said that our experts were fully convinced that British machines were the best in the world, and mentioned the great flight to South Africa. His Majesty had seen an account of the flight, and quite agreed about the supremacy of our aeroplanes. 4. At this point I formed the impression that His Majesty was waiting for me to talk business, and I mentioned the impending departure of Sir J. Cadman and his collaborators for Tehran. His Majesty replied that Davar had reported this, and that he hoped Sir John would be prepared to reach a satisfactory settlement. He quite understood that the directors must have the welfare of the shareholders at heart, but he felt that, considering the great interests that both the British and Persian Governments had in the concern, the directors should not regard it as a simple money-making business like any ordinary company. He hoped that His Majesty’s Government took a similar view, but he feared that they were not animated by friendly feelings towards Persia and did not share his desire for good relations, of which evidence was furnished by the attitude and conduct of the Persian Government subsequent to the cancellation of the concession. I suggested, in reply, that when the Persian Government pressed the company to send a mission here last spring to embark on negotiations, they had no idea how grave a crisis threatened the industry as a whole; the obvious and urgent need was for the leading oil companies to determine measures to save the industry from collapse. It was no great exaggeration to compare the action of the Persian Government last spring, when they required the company to send representatives here in order to discuss and establish a new basis for their relations, with that of a landlord who, with the house already on fire, wished his tenant to start talking about details affecting the manner in which he paid his rent. As for His Majesty’s Government and their views on the subject of Persia, [747 g-1]9 i TVipiv interest in the Anglo-Persian Oil i ompany, their they were unchanged. ^ prosper, and every other possible desire to see the world sett e down and p P wag no del - iberate to see the world se ' ‘ that t i lel . e was no deliberate hostility consideration must com ion t i at the policy of His Majesty’s Governmem ered whethei nis n } „ unrlnp imnortannA tn I wondered whether his impiession lii^l attaching undue importance to what was hostile to Persia was n0 “he r^ot^tta^^ ^ ^ .^at he had read in the press. the adverge criticism of the Persian Govern- necessary to explaintha f ^. ei(Tn press subsequent to the cancellation of the ment which appealed , ®,^ t f e pli e d that he did not attach great importance D’Arcy Concession His Majesty^ep^ ^ aU to scu[ . nlous personal attacks tfj to press polemics i o 1 ’ ired some measure of prominence were alwavs which P ers ° nb ' h P 1 !, t attitude of His Majesty’s Government was not j exposed.

Nl received Feroughi may. of course, have toned it down, but, anyhow, the bhah answered quite amicably that we were entitled to defend our interests, fi At this point I concluded that the Shah had had enough, and I therefore asked Feroughi to say again that the desire of my Government was to see a prosperous and stable Persia. His Majesty explained that a Pers.a master in her own house, with a patriotic Government sufficiently strong to run a. independent foreign policy, should be one of our political goals, but he greatlv feared that this was not the case, and that we resented all manifestations of ''dependence0^! His Majesty that almost all of what he had just said would have been quite suitable for inclusion in a speech by you on Anglo-Persian relations, but that his conclusion was quite wrong^ , . . . _ 8 It would be interesting to know how Feroughi put this into I ern™ Up to a point the Shah listened with the impassivity which I imagine he has cultivated, and then started, and ejaculated an angry “ what ? Feroughi made a second attempt, this time with entire success, as the Shah laughed with eve appearance of real good humour. Shortly afterwards he terminated the audience. . , , a 9. On reconstructing the conversation, I notice that I failed to take up in point made bv the Shah that “ the entire loss should not fall on one party only. That he should have said this makes it, I think, abundantly clear that he belief the decline in the Persian royalty to have been out of all proportion to the dec ine in the receipts of the shareholders and in the income tax received by His Majesn | Government, and it now seems to me possible that a slightly childish sense o being unfairly treated, as well as actual anger at the smallness of the roya provoked what Feroughi in the course of the audience called the geste o cancellation. Other remarks also suggested that the company was unfair. 10. Of course, all this, and the Shah’s alleged fear that His Majesty Government’s disposition is “ unfriendly,” can he dismissed as merely an asp^ of oriental bargaining, but I do not see that we should gain anything by SC J I am at present strongly under the impression that it would be well worth w ^ to prepare the ground for the actual negotiations by trying to remove some , the Shah’s misapprehensions. This might be attempted by drawing up m simplest possible form a general statement, reviewing the growth of the compa the policy of the directors, the effect of both on Persian interests, the reasons subsidiaries were formed, how they were financed, why in some cases the ^ om P, ^ have resisted the Persian claim to a share of their profits, and so on, and s 011 ^ translation of it to the Shah through Feroughi, with a message that if tnere any points which are not clear, I shall be happy to elucidate them to the bes mv ability. my auniiy. ^ 11. Before actually deciding whether to submit such a proposal f 01 ’.- t consideration.

I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad (No. 13). and to the Honourable, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (No. 25). I have, &amp;c. R. H. HOARE. p*. P.S. (February '22 ).—I had intended to send this despatch by the hand of Colonel Dodd on the 20th February, but a sudden indisposition prevented him from leaving. My telegram No. 44 of to-day's date contains a record of my conversation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the subject of the audience and the Shah’s general outlook. Feroughi confirmed my impression that suspiciousness of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s past conduct, which had been greatly increased by his growing mistrust of Teymourtache, was almost certainly the reason for his sudden irruption into the arena and his order for the cancellation of the concession. Feroughi also agreed that the conflict between Teymourtache and the Minister of Finance had probably played a part, in that a natural result of it would have been that the Shah was less well-informed of the facts than usual—perhaps I should say even than usual. But if we are to accept as truthful the astounding confessions of ignorance made by Davar in the course of the conferences with representatives of the company in Paris (Mr. Jacks gave me the records to read this morning), we are led not so much to wonder at the Shah’s ignorance and suspicions, but to ask ourselves whether Teymourtache. in spit of his apparently extensive knowledge of the company’s affairs, had any real understanding of them. Again, in my conversation with Feroughi, I mentioned the opinion by Messrs. Lumley and Lumley annexed to the Persian statement to the Council of the League. Feroughi’s demeanour suggested that this was the first he had heard of this opinion, and it is to my mind quite doubtful whether he has read the Persian statement. Finally, the fear of the Shah is now. as Davar plainly said in Paris, so great that his advisers, “ falsely so-called,' would not dare, even if they had the knowledge, to attempt to clear the atmosphere. And that is why I think we must face the task if the negotiations are to have a reasonable prospect of success. In conclusion, I venture to express my entire agreement with the view of the company, as conveyed to me in youi* telegram No. 30 of the 18th February, that the visit to Tehran is sound tactics if we believe that a further reference to M. Benes or the League of Nations will be necessary. When I suggested that the visit should not take place, it was with my eye on the negotiations rather than on the possibility of their being abortive, remembering that President Wilson was gravely handicapped at Versailles by not being able to “ refer the point to his Government.” R.

THE Persians seem now to regard Dr. Benes’s role as finished, and any supervision of our negotiations as an interference on his part. The following is a brief account of what has followed our last meeting on the 3rd February :— On Saturday, the 4th February^ our representatives in Geneva saw their Excellencies Davar and Ala by invitation to discuss the procedure of negotiations. We pressed the Persian representatives to have a complete draft of a new concession prepared by qualified experts in Europe for discussion, but this appeared to the Persians impracticable. They said that, before discussing any draft, they wished the company to agree on certain points which they were going to submit to the company, or to submit detailed counter-proposals/ Our repre sentatives agreed to wait for certain points under ten headings, and the same night before leaving Geneva they received a list of those points. We all met in London on the 6th February and came to the conclusion that the Persian demands were not only extraordinary, but also extremely vague. - With all their vagueness, their effect was very much that of his Highness Teymourtache’s letter of the 1st April, 1931, with which Sir John Simon dealt so ably in his speech at Geneva on the 26th January. We decided to send our representatives to Paris to see their Excellencies Davar and Ala (who had agreed in Geneva to meet us in Paris) and to try to elucidate the demands of the Persian Government. The attempt at elucidation lasted on Wednesday, the 8th, for five and a half hours. As a result of the conversation of the Persian representatives with our representatives, the Persians were quite unable themselves to elucidate, and admitted that the Tehran demands were extremely vague, and suggested one of two alternatives : either that the Persian Government should produce in Tehran a complete draft of a new concession, say, in the course of the next six weeks, or that a draft should be submitted by the company after further elucidation had been obtained by them from the Persian Government by telegraph, which would be very difficult. Our representatives said that they wished to report to London. On Thursday, the 9th February, we came to the conclusion in London that, in order to expedite matters, it would be better for the company to prepare a general outline of a scheme for a new concession and send it to their Excellencies Davar and Ala in Paris. We accordingly instructed our representatives to see their Excellencies Davar and Ala on Friday and inform them of our intention. Our representatives saw his Excellency Ala only on Friday, the 10th. His Excellency Davar had a luncheon engagement. When his Excellency Ala was informed of our decision, he stated that it would be just as well to transfer everything to Tehran at once, as neither he nor his Excellency Davar had any authority to discuss any scheme with us. He told our representatives that the “ ten points above mentioned were produced only because M. Gulbenkian, who, we understand, is on the staff of the Persian Legation in Paris, pressed them to put before the company concrete proposals. According to his Excellency Ala, M. Gulbenkian strongly advised such proposals on the ground that I had explained to him that without such proposals the company could not negotiate. I cannot confirm his Excellency Ala’s understanding of any conversation I had with M. Gulbenkian. However, out of the three-quarters of an hour’s conversa tion with his Excellency Ala, about twenty minutes were spent in a discussion with constant reference to M. Gulbenkian, of whom you may have heard. On Saturday, the 11th, we received from our resident director (Mr. Jacks) ln Tehran a telegram stating that at the request of the Minister of Finance (his [719 y—1]2 Fxcellencv Taqizadeh) he had that day had an interview with the Minister, at whl he wL informed of his Excellency Taqizadeh s app—ent to negot.ate with the comDany in Tehran m accordance with the J,ea 0 iie s aecision. His Excellency Taqizadeh expressed his readiness to begin negotiations at once, and Si if Mr Tacks could tell him the date on which the company s representatives wSLrivetntehr Mr. Jacks s^ date but would refer the question to London His Lxcellency aqizadeh statei that'he understood from the representatives of the Persian Government m Europ* that we were disinclined to comment negotiations until the principles had been agreed but he stated that it was impossible for the Persian Government to negotiate 'bv telegram. He indicated that it was necessary to complete negotm- tfons before May and added that responsibility for any delay would he with the ^We had a few days before received another telegiam fronp Mi. Jacks, in , . t i lp feeling of the Persian Government that, in the existing Sio^ of “ pubL^inlon.” which they, of course, had created, serion negotiations elsewhere than at Tehran were out of the question. The reality of this nosition we are now forced to recognise. , n For the time being at least, we must abandon the hope ente!tamed at Geneva that the venue of the discussions should be some neutral point in Europe, free from the influences of either London or Tehran, but accessible to experts and, above all, to the mediating influence of Dr. Benes himse f. Obviouslv we do not want any delay. We are ready to go to Tehran, and, indeed, are preparing to do so. The only thing that we now want to elucidate Lnd if possible, establish finally is the role of Dr. Benes^ In view of the Pers.ao mentality which you know as well as we do, we feel that it is our duty to keep Dr Benes informed of all the important stages of our negotiations. I will telephone to you to-morrow at Geneva at 7 p.m., Geneva time. It that hour is not convenient to you, please leave a message indicating the exact hour when you wish me to ring you up. I should not have troubled you with a telephone conversation unless I felt that the matter was of great importance and urgency Somehow I feel that whatever we do at this stage may create a precedent in the history of the League as to the role of the rapporteur. ^ ‘ Yours sincerely, JOHN CABMAN.

Mr. Cadogan to Dr. Benes.—(Communicated by United Kingdom Delegation, Geneva, February 20; Received in Foreign Office, February 22.) Your Excellency, Geneva, February 19, 1933. I VENTURE to address to your Excellency the following letter in confirmation of my recent statement to you concerning the negotiations between the Persian Government and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company:— As appears clearly from the letter from Sir John Cadman which I showed to your Excellency, the representatives of the company have experienced considerable difficulties in their negotiations in Paris; the Persian representatives have indicated that, in their view, the negotiations should be transferred to Tehran, and in all the circumstances the company have come to the conclusion that it would be best to adopt this course, though they are anxious to make it clear that their understanding was that it had been agreed that the negotiations should be conducted in some neutral place under the auspices of yourself as rapporteur to the Council for this question. The company have expressed the hope that, should the need arise, they might still be able to count on your friendly assurances of assistance and mediation. I ventured at our interview to enquire whether your Excellency would be good enough to communicate at once with the Persian representatives, calling their attention to the fact that this new development was not consonant with their former undertaking, and making it clear that, though it was not your desire at the moment to raise any objection to the transfer of negotiations to Tehran, your Excellency, nevertheless, had no intention of dissociating yourself from the negotiations, and that, in the event of further difficulties arising, you would reserve your rights to take such measures as might seem appropriate to keep the negotiations within the framework of the arrangement which the Council of the League had approved and from which you had no power to authorise any departure. I beg to express my gratitude to your Excellency for the friendly way in which you received my request, and for your kind promise to assist on the lines indicated. I take this opportunitv, &amp;c. A.

Extract from the Minutes of the Sixth Meeting {Public), held on Friday, February 3, 1933, at 10-30 a.m. —{Communicated by League of Nations, February 8.) President: Baron Aloisi. (C./70th Session/P.V.6(1).) THE members of the Council were represented as follows : United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland by Mr. Eden, replaced by Mr. Cadogan; China by Mr. Wellington Koo; Czechoslovakia by M. Benes, replaced by M. Osusky, and afterwards by M. Kiinzl-jizersky; France by M. Massigli; Germany by M. von Keller; Guatemala by M. Matos; Irish Free State by Sir.

The Secretary-General, Sir Eric Drummond, replaced during the discussion of the Anglo-Persian dispute by the Deputy Secretary-General. 3237. Dispute between the United Kingdom and Persia in regard to the Concession held by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (continuation). M. Davar, representative of Persia, came to the Council table. M. Benes presented the following report and draft resolution^):— “ I have made a careful study of the statements made at the Council table by the honourable representative of the United Kingdom and the honourable representative of the Imperial Persian Government, and I have co-ordinated them with the documents already in our possession. “ The Council is sufficiently acquainted with the facts and contentions in the present case, in view of the written documents and verbal statements of the two parties. I therefore do not think it necessary to give a detailed account of all the facts and contentions put forward on either side. “ As the Council is aware, the Persian Government considers that, so long as the concessionary company has not exhausted the legal remedies which are open to it in virtue of the national law of Persia, the Government of the United Kingdom does not possess, or has never possessed, the right to make the present case the object of a diplomatic claim, a fact which, in the opinion of the Persian Government, renders article 15 of the Covenant entirely inapplicable. “ The Government of the United Kingdom, while fully admitting the general principle on which the contention of the Persian Government is based, maintains that it is not applicable, and cannot be invoked by the Persian Government, in the present case. In addition to this preliminary question, the case involves important questions of law. I do not think it necessary for the moment and in existing circumstances even to mention these questions, for, since the first examination of this question by the Council, I have been able to proceed to conversations and to an exchange of views with the parties concerned with a view to arriving at a provisional arrangement, and I have the satisfaction of informing the Council that I have been able to arrive at a result which, I hope, may lead us to a final settlement of the difference. This arrangement has taken the form of the following conclusions :— 1. The two parties agree to suspend all proceedings before the Council until the session of Slay 1933, with the option of prolonging, if necessary, this time-limit by common agreement. ( 1 ) Document C. 100, 1933, VII. 1719 h—112 “ 2. The two parties agree that the company should inmmediatelv enter into negotiations with the Persian (io\einment, the respective legal points of view being entirely reserved. “3. The two parties agree that the legal standpoint of each of them as stated before the Council in their memoranda and in their verbal statements remains entirely reserved. If the negotiations for the new concession remain without result, the question a\] 11 come back before the Council, before which each party remains free to resume the defence of ^ its case. . i “4. In accordance with the assurance given by the Persian Govern ment in its telegram of the 19th December, 1932, to the President of the Council, it is understood that, while negotiations are proceeding and until the final settlement of the question, the work and operations of the company in Persia will continue to be carried on as they were carried on before the 27th November, 1932. “ If my colleagues agree, I venture to propose that the Council approve the present report and adopt the following resolution ‘“The Council, “ ‘ Having had referred to it the dispute between His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Imperial Persian Government:— “ ‘ 1. Takes note of the cases put before it by the two parties concerned and reserves the right to study them. “ ‘ 2. Appreciates the wisdom for the two parties to the dispute in refraining from any steps likely to aggravate the situation. “ ‘ 3. Approves the present report, together with the conclusions of the provisional arrangement to which the conversations between the ra'p'porteur and the two parties have led.’ M. Davar (representative of Persia) : I have transmitted to my Government the text of the agreement in four articles which was drawn up by the rapporteur and which he has just read. I have the honour to communicate to the Council the translation of the telegram which the Minister for Foreign Affairs has sent to me on behalf of the Persian Government:— “ The Imperial Persian Government, unshakably confident in its right, but desirous of giving evidence of its goodwill, in particular towards the League of Nations, accepts the formula contained in your telegram.' To this acceptance by the Persian Government I should like to add my thanks to M. Benes for all the trouble he has taken. It is both a duty and a pleasure to me to pay a tribute to the spirit of impartiality and justice which he has displayed in carrying out his lofty task. Mr. Eden: In expressing the agreement of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom with the resolution proposed by the rapporteur, I should like to begin by assuring M. Benes of the deep gratitude which His Majesty’s Government feels towards him for the untiring efforts he has made during the past week to bring about an arrangement between the parties—efforts which have been crowned with such a gratifying measure of success. It has from the first been the desire of His Majesty’s Government that a settlement should be reached between the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Persian Government, provided always that such a settlement could be negotiated on equal terms. The arrangement which the rapporteur has been able to bring about, and which will form the basis for the negotiations which are about to begin, provides these conditions. His Majesty’s Government is therefore hopeful ot the outcome of these negotiations. In this matter the true interests of the Persian Government and of the gre^ undertaking whose cause His Majesty’s Government has been defending nte identical, and I feel confident, therefore, that a new T agreement mutually benefkia to both parties will be reached. Meanwhile I accept, on behalf of my Government the proposal that the further consideration of this matter by the Council shou be postponed until its May session, and I trust that the negotiations may by then have been concluded so that the Council may be able to record a final settlemen of the dispute.3 ^mediately respective -h of them ie ir verbal •r the new before the defence of ^ m Govern- lent of the eding and ions of the carried on dl approve Majesty’s 1 Persian tvo parties dispute in elusions of 'tween the M. Massigli: I should like to express my Government’s satisfaction at the agreement which has been reached.. &amp; The French Government is sincerely glad that a dispute of so delicate a nature as this which has arisen between the two parties has been solved in this way It is, of course, a provisional solution, but we all feel confident that it will shortly lead to a permanent settlement. I should like also to associate myself with the congratulations and thanks ^which M. Davar and Mr. Eden have addressed to the rayporteur. Once again his eminent qualities as a conciliator have been successfully employed in the common interests of the parties and in the interest of the Council and its authority. Mr. Lester: I merely wish to associate myself with what M. Massigli has said. A provisional arrangement has been made, which every member of the Council hopes will lead to a settlement of this dispute. I will not for the moment refer either to the questions of substance or to the legal position of either party, but I think we may congratulate the parties and the rayyorteur on having reached so satisfactory an arrangement. The President: I should like to express to the rapporteur the satisfaction felt by the Council at the work he has done and the result he has obtained, and I desire to express the hope that the dispute will shortly be settled.

Member for Colchester on this subject, I described the provi sional arrangement which had been arrived at as a result of the proceedings before the Council of the League oi Nations last January with a view to the settlement of the dispute. In accord ance with the terms of that arrangement, direct negotiations, which will, however, remain under the aegis of the Rap porteur, will shortly be resumed between the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Persian Government at Tehran. Major MILNER: Is it proposed that the Government should be represented at this conference 1 ? Sir J. SIMON: No, Sir. The nego tiations, as I have just stated, will be negotiations between the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Persian Go\ein- ment, but the Rapporteur, Dr. Benesh, will remain in touch with what is going on.-• —— ~r— r J '’.5 A' go, 56j e ; n i o 27 FEBi953j British Legation, IjriHSAB. February 11th 1933. Sir The Persian press has reproduced at some length the interview which Mirza Ali Akbar Khan Davar, one of the Persian representatives at the hearing of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company dispute before the League of Nations, gave to foreign journalists on January 23rd. 2. In this interview Davar declared that instances have occurred in which Persian courts of law’have not been afraid' to issue judgements against the Persian ^lovermaent and in favour of foreigners. I 3. As such instances do not come readily to the mind, I have caused enquiries to be made as to the possible basis of this declaration. But except for the administrative tribunal of the Ministry of Finance, which occasionally decides in small cases in favour of the petitioner, no instances have yet been discovered. I am however causing further enquiries to be made and if they are successful I will report again. A. It seems possible that the argument used on the British side that as the cancellation had been made retroactively legal by the ?/ejlis, no Persian court could do otherwise than uphold the cancellation, came as a bolt from the blue to the Persian representatives* Davar makes no attempt, in the reports so far available to me, to attack this argument, though he repeats that the Company should have sought their remedy in the Persian courts I have the honour to be with the highest respect.

The position is briefly that the A.P.O.C. have agreed to negotiate in Tehran, despite tne unaerstanaing reached at Geneva that negotiations would take place in Paris. There are obvious arguments in favour of negotiations in Tehran and M. Bents, as will be seen from the Foreign Office telegram of 18th February, No,30, has undertaken to remind the Persian delegates that they must keep in touch with himself as Rapporteur and that the negotiations 'must remain witnin framework of arrangements which Council has approved and from which he has no power to authorise ue parture.' 3/f 11 3. Ihe remaining telegrams are largely concerned witn Lr.

The Foreign Office, in their telegrams of 23rd February, No.32 and 25th February, No.33, have indicated the grave objections which they see (and iihich are patent) to any proposal to volunteer tne statement at this stage, ihe Shah's attitude at the auuience and the attitude of tne Government generally does not suggest that our course would be aavanced by the adoption of either an unduly xnenaly or of an apologetic attitude. As for the 'gooa permanent understanding with us' which, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the shah is anxious to secure, a great change will have taken place if tne Persians are not anxious to secure this solely on their own terms and without making any concession which they can avoid m respect of our desiderata.

I said it was not long ago that His Majesty could not speak too highly of the Com~ pany - see Sir R. Clive’s telegrams Nos. 1 and 2 of January 1st, 1928. I did not know what had happened to U change his views. I wondered whether he had at the time of cancellation any idea of immediately preceding events which I recited to Minister for Foreign Affairs v/ho re*- t plied though he could not speak with certainty as he was not here, my account made him think that the Shah could nothave been properly informed, making it plain that in his opinion the Shah alone was responsible for the can^ cellation. Turning to the Shah’s views regarding the policy of His Majesty’s Government I said that they seemed sucv ject to violent and inexplicable changes. I could think of nothing during,say the last ten years which could ex plain these fluctuations. Minister for Foreign Affairs had no explanation but said that the Shall was very sus ceptible for instance he bad been delightedly grateful for spontaneous abolition of consular guards in 122 In spite of passing difficulties KisJMajesty's Gov ernment must believe Shah’s goal was- good permanenta, underwit’i us. If, as Minister for Foreign Affairs hoped 5 .Anglo- Persian Oil Company business v/as satisfactorily settled, all would be well. I then asked Minister for Foreign Affajrs what he thought of audience and he said he was pleased and re plied to a further question that he thought His Majesty did not see us oftener because he was embarrassed by not knowing a foreign language. This conversation has to some small extent con firmed the impression that audience did something to clear the fog of the Shah’s suspicions and I think it might be worth while to try and prevent it settling down again before the arrival of representatives of Anglo-Persian Oil Company. My idea v/ould be to send the Shah through Minister for Foreign Affairs a short account of the developments of the Company, of reasons J tw. t (H. for tdc Qrtyavo,gn.n^i manner in which they have been financed, of difference of opinion to which they have given rise and the efforts made to reach settlement. I would add that my wish was to give His Majesty a general but clear picture of a complicated matter. 1 felt sure that on his arrival Cadman v/ould be happy to explain my points which remained obscure although I was of course at His Majesty*s orders. Hoot of most of cur evils here rests in the sus picious nature of the Shah. Since I drafted this Mr. Jacks has shown me records of conversations in Paris which convince me more than ever tlxt prospects of negotiations would be immensely improved if before they began the Shah’s suspicions had been attacked.

While you are best judge of local situ&amp;ion, it seems to me on general grounds that satisfactory result is more likely to be obtained if Persians find, when negotiations reach practical stage, that company are willing to treat them more generously than they had expected, tha.n if they are given beforehand further explanations or assurances of company’s good-will which if they take them seriously ma.y only lead them to expect more favourable terms than company can in practice agree to.

Apart from, all other considerations our interests lay in that direction.

As I thought he was on the point of terminating the audience I said I wished to repeat what I had said regarding disposition of His Majesty's Government. This evoked a speech on the subject of interest which His Majesty's Government should have in seeing a stable independent Persia, under patriotic Government but he feared that His Majesty's Government viewed such Persia askance.

Dispute between the United Kingdom and Persia in regard to the Concession held by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. M. DA VAR, representative of Persia, came to the Council table. M. BENES : In order that I may be able to prepare my final report, I would suggest, Mr. President, that you call upon the repre sentatives of the two parties to the dispute, who will furnish the oral explanations necessitated by their memoranda. We can then examine the question further. SIR JOHN SIMON : I will gladly do my best to comply with the suggestion made by the representative of Czechoslovakia, who has been appointed as rapporteur in the matter of this dispute. The members of the Council are aware of the fact that on the 16th December, 1932, the United Kingdom Government circulated its memorandum, and that on the 18th January, 1938, the Persian memorandum in reply was also circulated. I will endeavour within limited compass to state as clearly as I can the nature of the dispute and the essential facts, and will also shortly deal with the juridical basis upon which, as my Government considers, the matter should proceed. On the 27th November, 1982, the Persian Government announced that it had cancelled the Concession held by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, a British company. This Concession was duly made on the 28th May, 1901, between the Persian Government and the former concessionnaire. I would like in the first instance to draw the attention of my colleagues to a number of relevant facts which are not in dispute at all. There is no dispute that the Concession was validly granted and bound the Government of Persia at the time it was made. There is no dispute that the original concessionnaire validly transferred his rights to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and that the Persian Government has recognised the Anglo-Persian Oil Company for many years as the holder of the Concession. There is no dispute that the Concession was for a period of sixty years and, therefore, when the Persian Government claimed to cancel it some two months ago the Concession had still nearly thirty years to run. There is no dispute that the Concession contains no provision for cancellation which is relevant in the present case. There is no dispute that the Concession contains an arbitration clause (article 17 of the Concession which is annexed to the British memorandum) under which any complaint, whether well- or ill-founded, by the Persian Government against the Anglo-Persian Oil Company could be brought. And there is no dispute that the cancellation was the unilateral act of the Persian Government ; that is to say, the Persian Government made no attempt to use the arbitration clause before [691 hh—1] Einnre about which there is no cancellation. There is on ^ to n gaVt i 8 most material from the dispute and which, ve . cance iiation, the Persian Government juridical point °f vie . unilateral act by the Persian legislative has secured a ratification of not ^ in any , ase any authorities with t e resul An persian Company in the Persian remedy pliable f £ cil understand that the action of courts. Members brought about the situation that there the Per®^ authorities has^now p^^gnt in Persia saying that the is an equivalent - p 0 Persian court would have fszzvtt « C 0 X n M.ie 8 ty &gt; « Government bring this matter before the Council of the Learnie as a matter involving internabonal law in which they as ha* been'perpetrated bv the unilateral act of the Persian Government. I wouWUke to sav a few words about the application of article The .Tseouence of 'the cancellation has of course adversely affected ?he com pane and might well develop into a st,11 more serious situation ^leading to a rupture between two countries both of which, f am Tore, desire to maintain friendly re at.ons-I would like to Lr, he honourable representative of Persia of my own sentiments. If “e Concession has been cancelled, which is what the Persian Government claim, the right of the companv to carry on its work to Persia would automatically disappear. The Persian authorities, “there is no concession which they respect, could tell the company o clear out. could claim to take over the company s operations and ould nut in jeopardy works and enterprises which have cost the “mpanv many millions of pounds sterling It is quite true that the Persian Government has not done that. Fortunately t ese extreme consequences have not happened because the Persian Government has hesitated to give logical effect to its unlawful act and has undertaken not to prejudice the position while the matter is being decided. But it is quite evident from the declarations made bv the Persian Government that its real reason for cancelling the Concession is that it hopes by this means to dictate to the company a new concession while the company is in the adverse and mi air situation of having its Concession cancelled. The position of a companv which has no concession in negotiating with a Government is of course, perfectlv different from the position of a company which has a concession, but is discussing with the Government whether there should be a modification. His Majesty’s Government submit that this is an indefensible use by the Persian Government of its sovereign power. The company ought not to be exposed to the risk of negotiating a new concession on the basis produced when the Government has illegally sought to cancel the old one. His Majestv’s Government, as is shown by their action in bringing this case before the Council under a procedure providing for conciliation, are very willing that this dispute should be happih settled. But they must insist that the illegal basis which the I ersian Government has sought to create should not be the basis upon which future discussions proceed. As I have said, I trust that there ma) be a reconciliation, but I must make quite plain to the members o the Council that, if it becomes necessary. His Majesty s Governmen will have to ask the Council to decide that an international wiong has been committed, and that accordingly the Concession must be restored. . . . , Allow me to give a short explanation of the provisions in ttie Concession as to royalty, and as to the way in which these provisions have operated in practice. Under the terms of the Concession t e company, apart from certain other payments, is required to 16 per cent, of the net annual profits, as indicated in article l'*- to the Persian Government, and it has in fact paid to that Govern ment very large sums amounting to over £11 million. At the tune when the Concession was granted in 1901. there was no commercia production of oil in Persia at all, and it was quite uncertain in wha areas, or with what outlay, or in what period of time, or in wha quantities, oil could be produced. Indeed, an earlier concern h prior to the grant of the Concession in 1901, held a concession onvery similar terms for oil in Persia, and had in 1899, after large expenditure, abandoned it as unprofitable. Manifestly, therefore, we are dealing with a case in which the company takes the risks. It is of the essence of such a concession that the burden of outlay and expenditure and risk of loss falls on the concessionnaire, and it is a manifest abuse of the contract—validly entered into—if after this outlay and risk the other party seeks to appropriate, in breach of the terms of the contract, the benefits of the exploitation. Under this Concession the members of the Council may have observed that the company was given rights to prospect over the greater part of Persia, and it has had to spend over £22 million in exploiting the Concession in Persia. The Persian Government has never contributed one halfpenny of the capital, and has never taken the smallest part of the risk from beginning to end. One of the many complaints contained in the Persian case, which I read with great interest and respect, will be found in paragraph 27 (a). Like many other complaints, it appears to have nothing to do with the question in dispute, and has never even been made the subject of complaint until now. It is that the company has confined the extraction of oil to an area of little more than 1 square mile. May I be forgiven for saying that this is an excellent example both of the relevance and of the accuracy of the details alleged to constitute the Persian defence. May I tell the Council the facts? Oil is at present being produced under the Concession by the company from over 150 times the area mentioned, and the company has spent vast sums in prospecting over large areas in order to find where oil can be profitably and economically produced. I have been provided by the company with a few figures. It has examined in detail over 150,000 square miles of territory; it has geologically traversed another 250,000 square miles: it has drilled test wells in no less than twenty-three areas; it has carried out 380 geological and geophysical surveys; and it has spent over £3,500,000 sterling on work of this character quite irrespective of its expenditure on the great oil-fields from which the principal supply now come®. I would ask the Council also to consider this : oil is a highly competitive commodity, and nothing can be more foolish (especially from the point of view of the Persian Government, which depends on the profit the company makes) than to extend oil works at random. The company, as the Persian Imperial Commissioner well knew and has acknowledged, is working on a carefully-planned scheme of development—a plan that has necessarily taken into account all relevant considerations, including the markets which are economically accessible. It is clear that in this respect the interests of the company are identical with the interests of the Persian Government, and the suggestion that the company is seeking to limit the profitable production of oil in Persia is as baseless as the suggestion that this was a reason why the Concession was cancelled, and in any case it would be impossible to justify a unilateral act for cancelling this Concession. The story about the royalties I understand to be this : After seven years of prospecting, involving heavy expenditure, oil began to be produced in commercial quantities in the year 1912. Profits began to be made in 1913 or 1914. In the years 1914 to 1919 the company paid on account of royalty to the Persian Government a sum of £325,000. I call attention to this fact because, when I turn to paragraph 5 (b) of the Persian case, I am a little surprised to read : “Up to 1919 no sum had yet been paid under this head.'’ It is very odd that that impression should exist, because the fact is that £325,000 had been paid on account of royalty. The years of the war produced considerable difficulties in this part of the world: the pipe-line which runs through Persian territory was cut by hostile tribal action, and the company suffered heavy losses. The company claimed under article 14 of the Concession that the Persian Government had undertaken to protect its pipe-line, which was in Persian territory, and consequently must make good the loss. If my colleagues will look at article 14 they will see that that was not an unreasonable construction; I do not say it was right, but it is one that might be advanced under that article. This led for the time being to the holding up of certain royalty payments, [691 hh—1] b 21919- 20 1920- 21 1921- 22 1922- 23 1923- 24 1924- 25 1925- 26 1926- 27 1927- 28 but this and other controversial matters were brought to a settlement as the result of negotiations conducted on behalf of the Persian Government by its Financial Adviser, Mr. Armitage-Smith. One of the terms of the settlement ultimately reached was that the company should pay to the Persian Government a lump sum of £1 million in respect of outstanding claims under the Concession during this period. It may be with surprise that the Council will observe that in the Persian case, which goes back into very ancient history, the Persian Government now suggests that Mr. Armitage-Smith had no authority for what he did, and that the settlement he made is not valid. What that has to do with cancelling the Concession so many years after wards I leave others to find out, but I would point out that if, indeed, the settlement made by Mr. Armitage-Smith, Financial Adviser to the Persian Government, is not valid, the Persian Government has received £1 million from the company which it ought to pay back. Secondly, the question whether it is valid or not has nothing whatever to do with the cancellation of the Concession on the 27th November. 1932. more than ten years later. I would be grateful if my colleagues would note what is included in the memorandum of my Government—what have, in fact, been the payments of royalties to the Persian Government during the last twelve years. The figures will be found in a note to paragraph 5 of the British text. For the last twelve financial years the payment of royalties to the Persian Government have been as follows :— £ 469,000 585,000 593,000 533,000 411,000 831.000 1,054,000 1.400,000 502,000 Henceforward the commercial year of the company ended at the 31st December, and for the nine months to the end of 1928, royalties amounted to £529,000. For the commercial year 1929. the figure was £1,437,000; for the year 1930. £1,288,000, and for the year 1931. £307,000. The Council will observe, therefore, that there was a very serious drop in the year before the C oncession was cancelled. There can be no doubt at all that this reduced amount was disappointing to the Persian Government, and I venture to think is, perhaps, not altogether unconnected with the events which occurred so soon afterwards. It was due not to any failure to discharge the terms of the Concession, but to the heavy fall in trade and profits all over the world, from which the company and the Persian Government had to suffer alike. I art of the arrangements made by Mr. Armitage-Smith provided that the Persian Government should appoint its own firm of chartered accountants to examine the books and figures of the company and to check the royalties to make sure that they were correct. That is ob\ioush a most reasonable provision, and the Persian Government employed for this purpose a firm of chartered accountants in London of the highest standing, whose complete integrity and capacity no one could doubt, and the Persian Government does not, of course, challenge this. I can assure the Council that there is no firm of higher standing in the world. Consequently, as the Council will appreciate, the records of the company have been examined on behalf of the lersian Government year by year, so that anyone might see how it stood and the calculations might be checked. ( ci tain questions have arisen from time to time between the accountants acting for the Persian Government and for the company, and some of these remain outstanding, so that the amounts paid were received without prejudice. I may observe, in passing, that it is a mue i more complicated calculation than one might suppose, because t e compam is concerned in many enterprises; there are subsidiary companies, there is the question of the tankers that carry the oil, and a mini ei o t migs, to sa\ nothing of the deductions to be made fromg r osg receipts before the net profits can be arrived at. 't hat, however, is a situation which might easily arise in a complicated business. There is not the slightest ground for claiming to cancel the Concession on that account, and, indeed, it is obvious that questions of this sort, if not disposed of by agreement, are questions which could be determined under the arbitration clause. I am very unwilling, and it is not necessary at this stage, to detain the Council with further details of the earlier years, but I should like to interpose three comments, made in the most friendly fashion, on statements which I find in the Persian memorandum. If the Council will turn to paragraph 5 (a) of that memorandum they will find it there stated that the company, over a number of years, failed to pay a fixed annual sum of 2,000 tomans due to the Persian Government under an article of the Concession, and that in 1909 the arrears amounted to 16,000 tomans. It is further stated that the company refused to make any payment and declined arbitration. In any event, that is very ancient history, which must be the explanation of its inaccuracy. The real facts are that the matter was amicably settled by a payment by the company on the 9th January, 1911, of £2,000 sterling in respect of the Persian Government’s claim to date, and 2,000 tomans have been paid by the company in respect of every year since that date. Since it is difficult to extract the smallest item of humour from a case of this sort, let me add that in the year 1913. owing to an error, the sum was actually paid twice over! I take as the second example of what I regard as a rather unhappy collection of innuendoes, what I read in paragraph 27 (c). It is an allegation that the company has failed to observe a stipulation in the Concession concerning the employment of workmen who are Persian subjects. I think the company has some right to feel a little aggrieved that such a suggestion should be made against it; it is not a ground on which anybody has ever sought to cancel a concession, and has nothing to do with the case. The actual facts are these : The skilled labour employed by the company in Persia includes 118 categories of employees, managers, engineers, &amp;c. When the compan}’ began operations few artisans in any of these categories were available among the Persian population, and during the Great War rapid development led to the importing from India of skilled labour not available in Persia. Since then, the number of non- Persian employees has been consistently diminished, and 90 per cent, of the company’s non-European employees in Persia are now Persian subjects. In order to fit Persian subjects for employment, the company has spent over £100,000 sterling on education in recent years. Apart from artisan-training centres, it has built schools in the Persian Provinces of Khuzistan, where none existed, and for six years it has provided free university education in England for two Persian students annually. Further, the Persian Government has benefited directly and indirectly by the expenditure in Persia of not less than £22 million by the company. On medical services alone in Southern Persia the company has spent over £550,000 sterling since 1924, and tens of thousands of non-employees receive free medical treatment every year. I should regret if any prejudice were introduced into this case on either side, because it is not at all necessary. The matter is, I think, a fundamentally simple one to decide, but I am entitled to say on behalf of my fellow-countrymen that the reproach that they have not in this matter shown a sufficient regard for the very proper needs of the population of Persia in the neighbourhood concerned has not the smallest scrap of foundation. I will take one other example and then pass to the main issue. In paragraphs 5 (a) and (b) it is stated that in 1909 and 1917 the company refused to refer disputes to arbitration. In the first place, I would invite this tribunal to consider the relevance of that observa tion. We are considering a cancellation suddenly perpetrated in November 1932, and I would ask exactly what help is to be got from speaking of events that occurred in 1909 and 1917 in justification of the cancellation. I do not understand. The facts are that the dispute under discussion, in 1909, was amicably settled in 1911 by a capital payment. As to the dispute in 1917, in August 1918 the counsellor of the Persian Legation in Londoncommunicated to the company the text of a telegram from the Persian Government stating: “ We note that the company is ready to go to arbitration, but that it wishes to settle this matter amicably and this we much appreciate.' What is the use of presenting a memorandum which makes it a capital charge against the company that it refused to refer a dispute to arbitration in 1917 when the Persian Government, through their own representative in London, states : ' We note that the company is ready to go to arbitration, but that it wishes to settle this matter amicably, and this we much appreciate ” *? The matter in dispute was. in fact, eventually disposed of. The company has never refused any formal request for arbitration and indeed, it could not have done so. because as any lawyer or business man knows full well an arbitration clause in a contract is a clause of which either party may take advantage without the permission of the other. To say that the Anglo-Persian Company refused arbitration is a statement which, on the face of it, is very difficult to understand. It is not necessary at this stage to detain the Council with further details of the earlier years, but it is very material to ask their close attention to the events which actually occurred in the period imme diately preceding the cancellation of which His Majesty’s Government complain. This is the more necessary since the account given of the events of this period in the Persian memorandum appears to be quite inaccurate and materially misleading. This especially applies to para graphs 16 to 22. The Persian case correctly states that in 193] discussions were proceeding between the company and the Persian Government as to whether the Concession could be revised and a new Concession negotiated. Negotiations on this subject had indeed been proceeding since 1929. The position was that the company held a perfectly valid binding concession which the Government had no right to cancel, but. at the same time, the company was willing to discuss with the Persian Government the terms of a new concession which, once it was agreed between them, might be substituted for the existing one. In April 1931 the Persian Government, in submitting proposals for a new concession, put forward the surprising claim that in any new con cession the company should, as a minimum, guarantee an annual payment of £2,700.000 sterling to the Persian Government, whether any profits were made or not. The Council will observe that it is not a proposal to have an increased percentage of profits; it is a claim that the company must guarantee in any event whatever be the fortune oi the venture, £2,700,000 sterling as a minimum year bv year to the Persian Government. Let us take the year 1931, in which this modest suggestion was put forward. Such a payment in the year 1931 would have absorbed the whole of the profits of the company and left nothing for reserve, and the uncertainties of the future, which have since been exemplified in the world depression, make such a proposition quite impossible. Accordingly, after further discussion in Tehran, Sir John Ladman, the chairman of the company, wrote on the 7th August, 1931. to saj t lat while the company would continue negotiations for the purpose o settling any difficulties or uncertainties in calculating rcya ies undei the existing Concession, there was so great a difference x ween t e mows of the Persian Government and the company as to a ' a . s P° s?i ble and equitable at that time, that the revision of the ^t 8310 ?

What he said was that in view of the enormous claims put forward on behalf of the Persian Government, it was commercially and practically impossible to consider the matter when trade was in so chaotic a state. Now. will the members of the Council follow the last stage of this story? There remained the negotiations for an improved agreement as to the calculation of royalties so as to get rid of doubts and disputes which had arisen in connexion with Mr. Armitage-Smith’s settlement. I do not argue that that settlement is perfect; it may be that it is&gt; open to attack on other grounds, but the fact is that the parties were dis cussing how to reach an improved agreement which would calculate the royalties under the Concession. I ask particular attention to this part of the story, as the Council will see how extraordinary was the conduct of the Persian Government, who now claim that they are justified in cancelling the Concession in November 1982. Let us follow the dates. Discussions were by mutual agreement resumed late in 1981 with respect not only to past differences on the subject of royalty payments, but also regarding a basis upon which the net profits of the company could in future be ascertained for the purpose of calculating the royalty to be paid to the Persian Government. The company offered a number of concessions which would have had the effect of increasing the Persian Government’s revenue and disposing of differences of a financial character which were still outstanding. Early in 1982 a preliminary settlement on these several matters was arrived at. A large capital payment in respect of all matters in dispute in the past was agreed, and a new royalty agreement was drafted, (iesigned to supersede the Armitage-Smith arrangement, and to meet the taxation claims of the Government. Heads of agreement were drafted which, when formulated in proper shape, would be fit for signature. The Persian Minister of Finance, his Excellency Taquisadih, signed a formal letter of authority empowering his Excellency Mirza Eissa Khan Fayz, the Persian Imperial Commissioner, to sign the agreement when drawn up between the Persian Government and the company. I have the document before me, and it is dated Tehran, the 4th April, 1932. I will read it :— “Son Excellence Mirza Eissa Khan Fayz, Commissaire du Gouvernement imperial de Perse, a present resident a Londres, est autorise a signer avec le represent ant autorise de 1 Anglo- Persian Oil Company, 1’accord a conclure entre le Gouvernement imperial de Perse et ladite compagnie concernant le reglement des differends existant entre eux et relatifs an mode de calcul des redevances payables par ladite Compagnie an Gouvernement imperial de Perse en vertu de la Concession d Arcy datee de mai 1901 ainsi qu’en vertu de la loi persane concernant 1 impot sur le revenu. “ Ministre des Finances, “ S. H. Taqizadeh.' So here you have the responsible Minister giving a written authority to the Imperial Commissioner in London to sign the document, sent from Tehran to London on the 4th April, 1982. The formal agreement was drawn up by the lawyers and accountants of the two parties. I have a photostat of it here. Now, w 7 hat happened to the formal agreement? It was initialled for the company by its chairman, and for the Persian Government by the Imperial Commissioner, and the document was sent to Tehran at the end of May 1982. There is therefore every ground for stating that the Persian Government contemplated and authorised the conclusion of this agreement. But w 7 hat happened? Five days later the annual meeting of the company v T as held and there were published disappointing trading results for the year 1931. from this moment the Persian Government took up a different line. It stated that it desired additional information with respect to the agreement which its own representative had initialled. Obviously such information could w T ell be furnished by its ow ; n representatives, who had discussed and formalised the agreement, and the company was at that moment (June 1932) absolutely unable to send its London experts to Tehran. Very shortly afterwards the Persian Government announced to the resident director at Tehran that a8 new set of proposals on a different basis were under consideration bv the Government, and the company naturally waited to know what these new proposals were. The directoi of the &lt;ompan\ in lehran continued to receive assurances from responsible Persian Ministers that these new proposals were being prepaied. On the 25th October, as no proposals had come forward, Sii John C adman instiucted the resident director to enquire about the matter. On the 16th November the resident director reported that the Mimstei of l 1 inance had confirmed to him that these new proposals of the Persian Govern ment were almost ready. The Council will observe from this short account of the dates that down to that moment the company had not the slightest reason to suppose that its Concession was in jeopardy. On the contrary, the authorised representative of Persia had initialled, agreed and formulated proposals drawn up in London, and in Tehran the company was being told right down to the 16th November, 1932. that alternative proposals drawn up by the Persian Government were just ready to be produced. Instead of producing them, the Persian Government, as already stated, made no further communication, but, on the 27th November, announced that the Concession was cancelled. These being the true facts the Council may be left to judge whether they are fairly and impartially stated in the remarkable version contained in paragraphs 19-23 of the Persian memorandum. The document of cancellation does not purport to cancel the Concession on the ground of any breach by the company, but makes it clear that the Persian Government took this illegal step as the most effective means of trying to get a new arrangement which would be more favourable to its interests. That is, in the submission of His Majesty’s Government, a wholly unjustified proceeding, a breach of international law, and a wrong in respect of which His Majesty’s Government are both entitled and obliged to take up the matter on behalf of the company. His Majesty’s Government have studied w T ith care and the greatest respect the memorandum presented to the Council b} 7 the Persian Government, and have ventured to comment on one or two passages. Without occupying more time, my Government desire to point out that the document is largely composed of allegations which, even if they w T ere w 7 ell founded, could not possibly provide any justification for cancelling the Concession. Many of them refer to matters of ancient history that have since been settled by large payments which the Persian Government does not offer to repay. Again, the suggestion that the company prevented the use of the arbitration clause is quite unfounded. The arbitration clause is at all times available to either party, and it is not within the pow r er of the other party to forbid its being used. Plis Majesty’s Government will take the opportunity of delivering a written document which deals consecutively and more in detail wdth the collection of points of complaint wLich is contained in the Persian memorandum. They will be able to show 7 that the complaints are in large measure ill- founded, and, in any event, could not constitute a justification for unilateral cancellation. I should like now to say a few words on the juridical basis of this application. I have, I hope, shown to the satisfaction of the Council that there has been nothing in the past conduct of the company which could, on any view of the law, justify the Persian Government in cancelling a valid concession by their own unilateral act, and it is therefore unnecessary for me to trouble the Council with any discussion of the question suggested in paragraph 28 of the Persian Government’s case. I should, however, say something on the contention adduced in the last portion of the Persian Government’s memorandum to the effect that His Majesty’s Government, as they suggest, have not the right to take up the case of the company, on the ground that the company has not had recourse to the Persian courts. The principle that where an effective remedy exists in the local courts, diplomatic action is not admissible until that remedy is exhausted, is well established, and I do not dispute the principle at all; the Persian Government have reminded the Council that His Majesty s Government have relied on that principle in a case which was recently before the Council, and I need hardly say that.on the question of principle, His Majesty’s Government stand by the statements made in that case. But the circumstances in the present case are completely different, and I maintain that the principle in question is not applicable. Let us examine the Concession. The method of settling any disputes which arise under the Concession was laid down in the Concession itself in the shape of the arbitral procedure provided for in article 17. The Persian Government made no attempt to make use of that procedure before cancelling the Concession, and they claim that in consequence of their action in cancelling the Concession the remedy in question is no longer open to the company. This means that the Persian Government, by its own act, has destroyed the tribunal to which these disputes would naturally have been referred. This is stated in paragraph 28 of the Persian case. It is not open to the Persian Government, having thus purported to deprive the company of the remedy provided for under the Concession, to claim that it ought to have recourse to another remedy in the Persian courts, which under the Concession have no competence to decide disputes between the parties. If I may say so, this is one of those cases in which law and common sense go together. In fact, the action of the Persian Government in thus depriving the company of the remedy provided by the contract may be regarded as a denial of justice which in itself would justify diplomatic intervention. Moreover, it is elementary that there can be no question of exhausting remedies in the municipal courts if no effective remedy exists there, and the Persian Government and Legislature have effectively eliminated any possibility of the company being able to obtain a remedy in the Persian courts. One does not send people into courts when one knows before they go that only one result is possible, and that that result is against them. As I have already pointed out to the Council, the Persian Government have not only cancelled the Concession, but they have followed up that action by enacting a Persian law which provides that the Concession is at an end. On the 1st December the Majlis, the legislative authority of Persia, confirmed the decision of the Government cancelling the Concession in the following terms :— “ The National Consultative Assembly expresses its agreement with the recent decision of the Government in regard to the annulment of the D’Arcy Concession and approves and corroborates (supports) the action of the Government in this connexion.” The text of the pronouncement of the Majlis was published in the official Majlis journal under the title ‘ ‘ Legal Decision communicated to the Ministry of Finance.” I understand that in form this amounted to retrospective endorsement of the Government’s action, which was technically irregular as there had not been previous consultation with the Majlis. I do not understand how the Persian Government can contend that a decision of the Government endorsed by the Majlis in the form of a “ Legal Decision ” published in the official journal is not valid under Persian law and binding on the Persian courts, and if so those courts can give no remedy against it. Therefore a contention by the Persian Government that an effective remedy exists in the Persian courts can only be based on the hypothesis that the decision was not valid under Persian law— if it is valid there is nothing to argue about—and that the cancellation of the Concession was therefore a nullity. If they admit that, on those grounds I submit most respectfully to my colleagues’ further consideration—if indeed the matter has to reach a final examination and judgment—that there is nothing whatever in the citation, as applied to this case, of the well-known fact that municipal remedied must be exhausted. They have been exhausted by the simple fact that the Persian Government and the Persian Legislature have destroyed them. 1 nave already explained the serious view which His Majesty’s Government felt compelled to take of the situation created as between themselves and the Persian Grovernment by the action of the latter. In these circumstances it was the duty of His Majesty’s Government to adopt one or other of the two methods, judicial settlement or reference to the Council, prescribed by article 15 for such cases. For. [691 hh—1]reasons which have been explained m the written case which we have presented to the Council, His Majesty s Government have adopted the method of bringing the matter before the League and by so doing they have shown both their confidence in the justice ot their case and their desire to make the fullest possible use of the methods provided by the Covenant for the settlement of international disputes, ihe procedure under article 15 involves, failing a settlement by agreement a report bv the Council on the merits of the case, but it is the first duty of the Council in proceedings under article 15 to endeavour to effect a settle ment of the dispute, and it is the earnest hope of His Majesty s Government that, under the guidance of the rapporteur the Council mav bring about an amicable and equitable settlement which will ensure the continuance in the future of the friendly relations between them selves and the Persian Government which they are most anxious to maintain and will enable the company to continue its operations in Persia in’harmonious relations with the Government of that country. The Council may be assured of the co-operation of His Majesty’s M DA VAR : I desire to express may admiration of the eloquence of the representative of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom It has- enabled him to present the facts in the light most favourable to the British cause. I personally am far from desiring to impress the Council by oratorical means. I shall therefore first explain our memorandum in a few words, and then reply veiy simply and briefly to the observations of the representative of the l nited Kingdom The Persian Government has already replied generally to the state ment of the facts contained in the British memorandum. It should doubtless have entered into greater detail; a number of rectifications have been made, but it was impossible to deal with everything. That would take too long and would be of no importance at present. We simply ask that our silence should never he interpreted as. necessarily implying acquiescence. We venture, however, to make certain observations on three points in the memorandum of the l nited Kingdom Government. We read with genuine astonishment the following statement in paragraph 88 ot the memorandum submitted to the Council:— “ His Majesty’s Government observe with much disquietude that, in the various communications quoted above, the Persian Government has consistently declined to accept any responsibility for loss or damage to the company, although under article 14 of the Concession the Persian Government is bound to take any necessary measures to protect the property and employees of the company.’ The expression of this disquietude, which according to the circum stances of the moment would appear to take the form sometimes of a threat and sometimes of a justification, is really inexplicable. In support of such a view, the United Kingdom Government points out that the Persian Government has only returned unsatisfactory replies to its formal notifications to the Persian Government to fulfil its obligations. It has. forgotten that, in reply to the note of the 8th December, the Persian Government stated, on the 12th, that it “cannot understand how. while .... they have not interfered and do not interfere with the affairs of the company nor cause them any inconvenience, any responsibility can devolve on them.” It is true that the Persian Government, which now contends that the D’Arcy Contract has no validity whatever, declines any respon sibility that might arise under article 14 of the contract. As that article, which requires it to protect the plant and apparatus, as well as the representatives, agents and servants of the company, is part of the contract, it necessarily shares the same fate. While, however, it would have been inconsistent for the Persian Government to admit that it was bound by this article, it was nevertheless obliged by international law, once it regarded itself as relea-sed from the whole contract, to safe guard the person and property of foreigners in its territory, an obliga tion it has never intended to evade. It therefore regrets to note that by claiming that as a result of the letter of the 27th November, 1932 the personnel and the property of the company ran grave risks, the United Kingdom Government converted an unfounded supposition into a formal charge.Another point in the United Kingdom memorandum needs to be elucidated. The United Kingdom Government appears to charge the Persian Government with declining to comply with the summons to withdraw the cancellation of the 27th November, under penalty of being cited before the Permanent Court of International Justice in virtue of the obligation it assumed acceding to the optional clause, article 86, paragraph 2. To cite it in this way before the court or—to be more accurate—to threaten to do so, does not appear to be in accord ance with custom. If the United Kingdom Government thought the Persian Government ought to submit the dispute to the court, it had only to cite it to appear before the court. It has since given as its reason for not doing so that in its Protocol of Accession to article 36, paragraph 2, the Imperial Persian Government made a reservation whereby it could ask that proceedings be suspended and a dispute referred to the Council; and the United Kingdom Government could not prevent such a result except by itself taking the initiative and bringing the matter before the Council. That the United Kingdom, having warned Persia that unless the cancellation of the 27th November were withdrawn in eight days, she would be cited before the Permanent Court of International justice, should not have carried out that intention can be explained very simply. We have only to refer to Persia’s accession to the optional clause for compulsory arbitration to see that it covers “ any disputes arising after the ratification of the present declaration ’ ’—that is the actual wording of our reservation—“ with regard to situations or facts relating directly or indirectly to the application of treaties or conventions accepted by Persia”—I emphasise the words ‘‘of treaties or conventions”—and subsequent to the ratification of this declaration.” No jurist could conceive that ‘‘treaties or conventions accepted by Persia” could mean anything but treaties or conventions between States. No one could suppose that the Concession granted to a private individual in 1901 with power to substitute for himself one or more commercial companies was a contract between States. Moreover, we made another reservation which must be borne in mind: ‘‘with the exception”—the reservation reads—‘‘of . . . . disputes with regard to questions which, by international law, fall exclusively within the jurisdiction of Persia.” This stipulation was not without its value; it makes clear the respective positions of the two Governments in the present circumstances. The third point to which we desire to draw the Council s- attention relates to paragraph 83 of the United Kingdom memo randum, which charges the Persian Government with making no attempt to invoke the arbitration provisions of article 17 of the Concession. Having cancelled the contract, the Persian Government could not consistently resort to arbitration, for which provision was made in one of its articles. If the company thought we were bound by the contract, it should have applied to the courts to have this article put into operation. Having made these rectifications in the United Kingdom memorandum, we will explain our own point of view. How was the contract made? How was it carried out? These questions cannot be discussed at the moment. What must be made clear is that they arise, not between the United Kingdom Govern ment and the Persian Government, but between the Persian State, which granted the Concession, and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, the concessionnaire. For the United Kingdom Government to be able to present here as an inter-State dispute what is simply a dispute between the Persian State and a private individual, it must plead the right to diplomatic protection. As we said in our memorandum, however, diplomatic protection presupposes— (1) A violation of international law. (2) The previous exhaustion of municipal remedies. Neither of these two conditions has been fulfilled in this case. There has been no violation of international law, but a unilateral denunciation, falling within the sphere of application of civil law. While reserving its right to employ any legal means that might prove necessary, even to declare the original contract null and void, [691 hh—1] c 2the Persian Government confined itself to putting an end to a synallagmatic contract on the ground of non-fulfilment, this is the simple and lawful act by which, in many legislations, one party ends a contract, subject to the other party’s right to contest such act. In paragraph 28 of our memorandum we say : ‘ ‘ Roman law allows the party suffering by the non-fulfilment of the obligations assumed towards him to notify the other party that he reciprocally regards himself as released from his own obligations,” while “ French law requires the party to apply to the courts in order to vindicate his rights.” We must add that while French law differs from Roman law, in accordance with the progress of legal science, the most modern legislations have carried the idea of cancellation for non-fulfilment much further than Roman law. The Swiss Federal Code of Obliga tions is a noteworthy case in point. The legal principle of Persian law with regard to unilateral cancellation on the ground of non-fulfilment is therefore in complete agreement with the most modern codes. The application of this principle cannot be considered a violation of international law. There remains the second condition preliminary to diplomatic protection: the previous exhaustion of municipal remedies. The British national, who should have exhausted them before invoking diplomatic protection has had no resort to them whatever. There fore the United Kingdom Government cannot intervene. The principle that municipal remedies must first be exhausted is not only enunciated by the United Kingdom Government itself, as we have stated in our memorandum, but was recognised by the Permanent Court of International Justice in the Mavrommatis case, Judgment No. 2. p. 12, as follows :— ‘‘It is an elementary principle of international law that a State is entitled to protect its subjects, when injured by acts contrary to international law committed by another State, from whom they have been unable to obtain satisfaction through the ordinary channels.” In the present case, the ordinary channels (the Persian courts) being open to the company, the United Kingdom Government had no legal authority to interfere in the dispute between the Persian State and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. I shall now reply to Sir John Simon's very eloquent and able observations, which, however, in no way impair the legal value of the considerations I have just laid before the Council. The representative of the United Kingdom adduced several examples in an endeavour to prove that the Persian memorandum was based on a number of facts which were not substantially correct. He pointed out that it is said, in the part of the Persian memorandum relating to the company’s restricted exploitation of the Concession, that it was confined to an area of little more than one square mile. If you refer to this passage in our memorandum, you will see that our observations relate not to the prospecting operations and the activities of the company, but to actual extraction and exploitation. We fully recognise that in many areas the company’s prospecting operations have proved the existence of oil. But we do complain that, having found this product, the company kept exclusive possession of it and left it in reserve underground, making available only the oil extracted from a few wells—six or seven, if I am not mistaken. On the other hand, Sir John Simon pointed out that it was in t e interest of the Persian Government and of the company that oil extractions should be reduced during the depression. To that it might be replied— ( 1) That the oil industry has had difficult times only in recent }ears, whereas the company has been w r orking in Persia for a long time. (2) That even in the years of depression, the company considerably extended its operations outside Persia. the vears iqiViq n 7’^ H .^ rim g W ^e company during iqiu u f r&gt; ’•*? a ' V iave P ai ^ P art if 8 royalties before ’ ’’ u l e ersia d Government certainly received no royalties Un - 1 se ' eia y ear ® later than 1918, the year during which, accor ing o . n John Simon, the company began to make profits.IB In anv event, the fact that the company admitted, in 1920, that it owed a million pounds sterling in respect of arrears and claims by the Persian Government certainly proves that for years it had with held considerable sums belonging to the Government. Sir John Simon then mentioned a fact which, he alleged, clearly showed that our statement did not correspond to the facts. He referred to the royalty of 2,000 tomans. I take up this point to prove that our intentions were not, 1 think, bad and that we were telling the truth. We did not say in our memorandum, with regard to the royalty of 2,000 tomans, that a subsequent settlement was not reached. We simply desired to show that, even when so small a sum as 2.000 tomans a year was involved, the company did not fulfil its obligations, except after inadmissible delay. Sir John Simon himself said moreover,.that it was in 1911—that is to say, after ten years’ delav—that the company fulfilled its obligations and paid us this sum, which it should have paid in 1901. Consequently, when we said in our memorandum that the company was not fulfilling its obligations, our intention was simply, to show, from the history of our relations, how the company behaved. The sum in question was very small—2,000 tomans; and the company delayed payment for ten years. There is thus nothing incorrect there. Our statement was entirely in accordance with the truth. As the facts were so eloquently presented by the United Kingdom representative, however, this truth might appear in another light and create a different impression. Sir John Simon spoke just now of the employment of Indian labour. I should like to correct him on one or two points. The question was not that of the employment of Indian labour at the beginning of the Concession. Although the company has been working in Persia for many years, it still employs this foreign labour. In spite of all the Persian Government’s protests, it still has thousands of foreign employees who are not skilled workmen, but mere labourers. I will not go into details here regarding the negotiations between ourselves and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. What was asked of the company and what it was given in exchange are matters of no importance for the moment. The company itself knew very well, and knows very well, that there were certain circumstances which justified the Persian Government’s demands. I will not go into details now, as a discussion of them would, I think, be entirely premature for the moment. As mention has been made of the Imperial Commissioner’s having initialled a preliminary agreement, we must be quite clear on that point. There was no engagement at all; there was an agreement of principle, but—as the company knows very well, and as the British memorandum moreover mentions—the agreement had to be ratified by the Government and approved by Parliament. There were there fore simply proposals or plans in no way constituting an engagement between ourselves and the company. It has been said that if the Persian Government thought that the 1920 agreement concluded by Mr. Armitage-Smith was not valid it ought to return the sum of .£1 million received by it from the company. If we enter upon a discussion of this matter, if it is taken before a competent tribunal, we shall of course return the amount in question; but we shall claim everything that the company has acquired by way of profits gained without legitimate cause, and I think that in the last analysis we shall benefit by doing so. Again, mention has been made of the sums received by the Persian Government, £11 million. That is, of course, a very striking and impressive sum. Let us, however, compare it with the gains of the Government of the United Kingdom and the shareholders. Down to 192b that Government received more than £40 million, whereas, from the beginning of the Concession, we have received only £11 million. We have calculated that, if we had left our entire oil resources at the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s free disposal, we should have received £20 million under the head of duties collected by the Customs Administration. The United Kingdom representative told us that the reasons adduced by the Persian Government in its memorandum, even14 supposing they wort' truo to tlio f&amp;cts, did not \\tiiiiint tlio I orsutn Government's cancel] fit ion of the contract, ^e must point out that the question at present under consideration is not whether, legally, the arguments advanced by the Persian Government in its memo randum are sufficient to justify the cancellation or no. That is an issue to be discussed in the competent courts. In his verbal statement Sir John Simon referred to an interpre tation of article 17 of the original Concession. He seemed to be trying to imply that that article declares the Persian courts to be entirely without jurisdiction. That would be really astonishing. Article 17 means this: The contracting parties undertook to submit to arbitration any dispute that might arise between them during the term of the contract. We gave that undertaking. In our view it no longer exists, because the contract no longer exists, and that article is one of the articles of the contract. Either we are right or we are wrong. If we are right, if the contract has been cancelled, then we cannot be blamed for not putting this article into execution and for not having had recourse to arbitra tion. And, if it is claimed that the cancellation was unwarranted, where is that to be proved? Is it to be proved in the Council of the League of Nations? It is the first time I have heard that argument. It is the first time I have heard it said that upon entering the League a State substitutes the Council for its own courts. We have already mentioned some of our arguments, and when we go before the competent court, I may say that we shall present them all and in due form. That will be the time to examine whether the cancellation was justified or not. If it was, article 17 concerning arbitration can then be applied: but the Persian Government cannot at once cancel a contract and take the same contract as a basis. That would be inconsistent. Moreover, the law in Persia is perfectly clear. If two parties to any contract give a mutual undertaking to submit any disputes between them to arbitration, and if one of the parties refuses, in the event of a dispute, to comply with that undertaking, the law indicates the path to be followed. It stipulates that it is the other party that must apply to the court and oblige the opponent to appoint his arbitrators. If the arbitrators are not designated within a specified time-limit, they are appointed by the court. The matter is therefore quite simple. If the company believes our action to be unwarranted, it ought to apply to the courts and ask for the application of article 17. If that had been done, we could have argued that, having cancelled the contract, we w r ere no longer bound by the arbitration clause. The court would then have had first to consider the previous question of the cancellation. If that had been settled in our favour, there would be no occasion to submit the dispute to arbitration. If judgment had gone against us, we should then have been obliged to accept arbitra tion: but we cannot, without inconsistency, cancel the contract and accept the arbitration stipulated in that contract. The 1 nited Kingdom representative is, moreover, singularly mistaken when he claims that the measure of the , 27th November taken b&gt; the Iinance Minister subsequently received the approval of the Chamber, and thereby assumed the character of a law which the Persian courts would be bound simply to apply, so that the company would be deprived of all redress. . ^ ie President of the Chamber observed at the end of the discussion on the same day, the Chamber’s resolution was simply a motion of confidence, which is a familiar practice in all countries wi a pai hamentary system. It was not a law. In taking a decision m conformity with the rules of civil law, the Persian Government had no need whatever to obtain approval by statute for the cancellation 0 ie . ' Ic ^ Contract. Before, as after, recourse to the courts remained open to the company. As to the looses sustained by the company during the year, losses Much the company claims from us by withholding payment of 10 } a les ovei a number of years, I intentionally refrained from giving too many details m our memorandum; and I will limit mvself in the present discussion to a few explanatory remarks. Ihe company is claiming from us the losses due to the fact that ™ ng ] . e ' ai ^ e pipelines were cut in certain places by armed bands, acting on the instigation of the belligerent Powers, who hadviolated our neutrality. I will mention no names, but almost all our neighbours fought on our territory. Our neutrality was violated by the company, and perhaps by the Government of the United Kingdom; whereupon other belligerents came and organised armed bands, and it was these who cut the pipe-lines. And we were expected to pay for it! We cannot do so, since the losses sustained were due to the war and to acts at variance with Persian neutrality. According to one expert—and I am happy to have heard the United Kingdom representative say that he is above suspicion—the losses caused amounted to £‘20,000. The company claimed for £600,000. What did the Persian Government do? It asked the company to submit the question to arbitration; but the company replied : “ No. We will not allow the principle of your liability to be submitted to arbitration, but if you are willing to discuss the figures, we will ask experts to go into the matter.' In the company’s eyes we were liable, and it set itself up as both judge and plaintiff. Mention has been made of two persons holding scholarships. That is perfectly true, but we are prepared to tell the company that it can withdraw its benefactions. The Persian Government is now maintaining over 500 Persian scholarship-holders in France, Switzerland and Belgium. Nevertheless we must be grateful for what has been done, and as that has been put forward as an argument, I tender my thanks. I am anxious to avoid details as far as possible, and to confine myself to the substance of the case. I said at the outset, and I still say, that the substance of the question cannot be discussed before an international body until it has been proved that there has been a denial of justice. We were very glad to hear the United Kingdom representative say that his country still maintained the principle that the ordinary remedies should be exhausted before diplomatic protection is exercised. We take note of that declaration. There is, therefore, only one point to be elucidated, namely, whether the municipal remedies were open or closed to the company. We have already said that they remained open. If need be, that issue could be elucidated separately. SIR JOHN SIMON : I shall not detain the Council for more than a few moments, but I should like, while this discussion is fresh in our minds, to note one or two points which have been brought out in the course of the Persian representative’s interesting speech. Those points are concerned with the juridical basis of the British claim, with one exception with which I will deal first and which is purely a matter of fact. I can assure the Persian representative that, wherever he got his figures from—and I do not think it can have been from his accountants—the statement that His Majesty’s Government have drawn £40 million from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company is a grotesque exaggeration. I would further point out that His Majesty’s Government differ in this respect from the Persian Govern ment, in that Ilis Majesty’s Government have contributed to the capital of the company, whereas the Persian Government have contributed nothing at all. If the Persian representative would like to know what approximately is the figure which His Majesty’s Government have received in respect of a very large share-holding in the company, it is, I believe, round about £9 million. I do not give that as a certain figure, but it goes without saying that it can be ascertained without any difficulty on reference to the proper sources. As for the suggestion contained in paragraph ‘25 of the Persian memorandum—and to which I did not allude in my own observations, because I thought it rather spoke for itself—that if the Anglo-Persian Oil Company had been left to deal with this matter without having to pay royalty, then the taxes levied by the taxes department alone would have amounted to £19,998,509 16s. Od., 1 can only say that I admire profoundly the precision of these calculations, especially as the other calculations showed a mistake as between 40 million and 9 millions. I must really ask for particulars of the 16s.! The whole of that paragraph is, I submit with the greatest respect, based on a rather obvious fallacy. If, indeed, there was1C going to be imposed upon the company taxes to the tune of £19 million, then I wonder how much profit the company would make, and I also wonder whether it would undertake the Concession at all'. I am not myself aware what these taxes would be, because I am informed that there is no tax upon the export of oil; consequently, the only taxes must be on things imported by the company, such as machinery. If one sa\s to a British company that if it endeavours to extract oil from the soil of Persia it will be required to pav £19 million in taxation on its machinery, I think it very improbable that the company will undertake the operation. That is all I wish to say on the facts. I would like now to refer to the very frank and very clear state ment made by the Persian representative on the legal situation. He has referred particularly to clause 14 and clause 17 of the Concession, and I agree with him that it is well worth considering what those two clauses indicate as to the juridical position. Clause 14 is the clause which provides that the Persian Govern ment “ binds itself to take all and any necessary measures to secure the safety and the carrying-out of the object of this Concession of the plant and of the apparatuses of which mention is made for the purposes of the undertaking of the company and to protect the representatives agents and servants of the company.' It was, of course, under that article that the company, whether rightly or wrongly, thought that if its pipe-line, which is plainly one of its apparatuses, was damaged on Persian territory it might be that article 14 meant what it said, and that the Persian Government had guaranteed the safety of the pipe-line. Of course, the Persian Government, under that article, undertake to keep the company, its apparatus and senants safe. I am not concerned as to whether that was right or wrong, for I quite agree that the conditions of war in many cases make a great difference, for which allowance must be made: but the Persian representative said that when the Persian Government were asked by the United Kingdom Government the other day whether they were prepared, under article 14, to continue to hold themselves responsible for the various matters mentioned there, the Persian Government had been obliged to say that they were no longer bound by article 14, because they had cancelled the Concession. That is exactly the point which I endeavoured less clearly to make in my opening speech, in which I ventured to submit to the Council that it was plain that there was here the danger of a rupture, since, when the Persian Government cancelled the Concession, they tore up even- clause. and one clause was that which made special provision for the protection of the company, the Concession, its sen-ants, agents, material and plant. I concede to the representative of Persia that the Persian police authorities still exist, but. whatever may be the reason, it seems to have been thought worth while by both sides, when the Concession was prepared, to insert a specific article guaranteeing that the Persian Government would protect the Concession and all belonging to it: and. by the admission made here a half an hour ago by their representative, the act of the Persian Government has destroyed that article. The other point to which I would like to refer concerns article 17. whjch is the article which provides for arbitration. “ In the event of there arising between the parties to the Concession any dispute or difference on the subject.’’ amongst other things, “of the rights and responsibilities of one or other of the parties.” provision was made for arbitration. Now. the honourable representative of Persia says: “Yes. article 17 is in the Concession all right, and arbitration is provided for by that article.' but then he says: “The Persian Government have torn up the Concession, and therefore there is no longer any arbitration clause to which the Persian Government can give any respect or adhesion. That is exactly what I said in my opening speech. The bargain which was made between the two parties when the l oncession was made was one regarding the constitution of a tribunal, especially defined in the Concession, to which the company could go: but the act of the Persian Government in cancelling the lonee^sion has destroyed the tribunal, and. therefore, the Persian17 r' Government cannot say that recourse cannot be had to the Council of the League of Nations unless other remedies have been exhausted, when the Persian Government, by its own unilateral act, has deliberately destroyed the very tribunal to which the company wae contractually entitled to go. I think that is extremely clear, and I cannot imagine that any other view would be taken by a competent jurist, or, indeed, by any clear-headed man of affairs. There is one further point. The Persian representative can be most persuasive, and he has in an admirable manner endeavoured to suggest that there is still no question of international law arising between the parties. May I be allowed to point out, however, that this is not a question between two individuals, A and B. It is a question of a contract between a foreigner and the Persian Govern ment itself. This matter can be examined at greater length later, and I need not delay the Council by citing authoritiee, but I venture verv respectfully to state that this is the position in international law. Pronouncements by writers of repute in international law state that if a Government, by executive action or by legislative action, takes a course which is inconsistent with the terms of the Concession which it has granted to a foreigner, that is a violation of international law. Moreover, the Permanent Court of International Justice has established a finding that respect for the acquired rights of foreigners forms part of international law. Again, numerous cases have arisen where Governments have taken up the case of their own nationals in relation to a foreign Government on the ground that a breach of international law has been committed. Lastly, several cases of this kind which have been submitted to international arbitration have resulted in damages being awarded against the offending State. I will conclude all that I need say at the moment on this subject by reading a iK)rtion of the judgment that was pronounced in a case of that character. There was some time ago an international dispute which was taken up by the United States Government against Salvador because of the fact that the American rights of an individual had been disregarded. An international tribunal was appointed, and the following are two paragraphs from the judgment:— “It is abhorrent to the sense of justice to say that one party to a contract, whether such party be a private individual, a monarch, or a Government of any kind, may arbitrarily, without hearing and without impartial procedure of any sort, arrogate the right to condemn the other party to the contract, to pass judgment upon him and his acts, and to impose upon him the extreme penalty of forfeiture of all his rights under it, including his property and his investment of capital made on the faith of that contract. “ Before the arbitrement of natural justice all parties to a contract, as to their reciprocal rights and their reciprocal remedies, are of equal dignity, and are equally entitled to invoke for their redress and for their defence the hearing and the judgment of an impartial and disinterested tribunal.” I heard the Persian representative say something about the company being judge in its own cause; but I hope I am not exaggerating when I say that the Government of Persia, one of the two parties to the Concession, have plainly claimed to be judge in their own cause. I repeat the language of the judgment which I have just read, that in such cases the parties are “ entitled to invoke for their redress and for their defence the hearing and the judgment of an impartial and disinterested tribunal.” The I nited Kingdom Government, on behalf of a British subject, respectfully ask the Council of the League of Nations, if no adjustment is arrived at, to render that impartial and disinterested judgment. M. DA VAR : I have only a few observations to make in reply. With regard to the £40 million which I mentioned as being the profits received by the United Kingdom, I found this sum mentioned in a work by Mr. Winston Churchill, who was at one time Chancellor of the Exchequer. SIR JOHN SIMON : If I may interrupt, I would point out that the figure given in the book is an estimate of what might possibly be the ultimate receipts of the United Kingdom Government. [691 hh—1] DM. DAVAR: With regard to the £19.998,509 16s. which I indicated as the amount the Persian Government might have received under the sole head of duties collected by the Customs Administration had there been no D’Arcy Concession, the United Kingdom repre sentative expressed surprise at the exactitude of this figure. I may say in reply that the papers were prepared for me by the Customs Administration itself, and I can communicate them to Sir John Simon personally. I do not think it is a crime to be accurate in book keeping. SIR JOHN SIMON : Certainly not! M. DAVAR : With regard to article 14, I referred to it first of all in order to demonstrate the company’s methods : I pointed out that the company claimed more than £600,000 in respect of losses sustained by it during the war, whereas the sworn chartered accountant, a British subject, whom we commissioned to audit the company’s books, stated that, even if the Persian Government could be held liable, all that could be claimed from it was £20,000. We are very exact in our figures, but the company is perhaps less exact in its claims. I come now to a specially important point from the Persian point of view with regard to article 14. The United Kingdom repre sentative said that, after cancelling the D’Arcy Contract, the Persian Government considered itself no longer bound by article 14 and was pot prepared to take the necessary measures to ensure the safety of the company’s staff and material. I have, however, said that we would respect and protect the company’s staff and property, not under article 14 of the contract—since, in our contention, the contract no longer exists—but under the rules of international law. We are bound to assume that undertaking and we are firmly resolved to assume it. We agree that we are bound to protect foreigners and their property in Persia. We have never attempted to deny that obligation, and, consequently, there is no need for anxiety on that account, since, although we shall not protect the company under the D’Arcy Contract, we shall do so as an international obligation. With reference to article 17, the United Kingdom representative reiterates his previous arguments, stating that, in the Persian Govern ment’s contention, the tribunal prescribed in that article, which was to be designated by the parties to the Concession, no longer exists, since there is no longer any concession. But, as I explained just now, that is a point on which it is necessary to take up a definite attitude, there are two alternatives: Either the Persian argument is right and the cancellation of the contract was legally valid, or the Persian argument is legally unjustified. If the Persian argument is right, we have done nothing for which we can be blamed. If it is not, the company must apply to our courts and compel us through them to submit to arbitration, i.e., to inlfil the engagement undertaken by us in article 17 of the contract. We should then, however, have first to put a previous question and ask tliat it should first be considered whether the cancellation was justified or not. If we were wrong in cancelling the contract, we shall naturally be obliged to submit to arbitration. A remedy, therefore, still subsists. The United Kingdom representative has mentioned certain texts m connexion with the rules of international law\ He said that there las been a \ iolation of international law because there is a concession i? V -° ^ seems ^’ 0 me th ere has been a slight change in the British argument. Just now I thought I heard the United Kingdom lepresentatne say in his statement that we were in agreement as o t le principle, that is to say, he recognised that, until the remedies at municipal law had been exhausted, there was no ground for inter vention in the form of diplomatic protection and that there was no occasion to consider whether there had been a violation of inter national law. I now note, however, or rather I have the impression, that there las een a c ange in the United Kingdom representative’s argument: ie says m in t is particular case, seeing that a concession is involved, there was a violation of international law for the simple reason that the Concession w-as cancelled before any recourse had been had to the national courts or any judgment pronounced.19 t r r L 1 here is a very simple way of solving this preliminary question, namely, to refer it to the Permanent Court of International Justice. In that way we should receive complete enlightenment as to the principle. The principle does not concern Persia alone. Certainly the matter is of capital importance to us, not only in regard to the particular case we are now considering but for other cases likewise. The principle is of great importance from the international standpoint. I consequently propose that we should ask the Permanent Court whether it considers that before the remedies at municipal law have been exhausted there has been a violation of international law and whether there is ground for intervention by way of diplomatic protection. M. BENES : I have listened with very close attention to the state ments of the United Kingdom and Persian representatives. They contain a number of arguments and facts which the Council will certainly desire to consider more closely. As rapporteur, I shall in any case need to study them in detail and then to get into touch with the parties, so that at one of the forthcoming meetings of the Council I may submit a report on all the various questions involved and on the way in which an attempt might be made to settle the issue. I therefore propose that the Council adjourn the discussion of this item to a forthcoming meeting. (The rapporteur’s proposal was adopted.)

[E 227/17/34] Llg55 J Mr. Hoare to Sir John Simon.—(Received January 12. 1933.) {So. 568.) Sir, Tehran, December 31, 1932. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith copy of an interview obtained from the Minister for Foreign Affairs by Mr. Lyons, the Moscow correspondent of the United Press of America, who has come here on a brief visit to “ cover ” the Anglo-Persian Oil Company dispute and will shortly proceed to Geneva. 2. There is little in the interview which has not been said already, either in the official notes of the Persian Government or in the press, but it contains a satisfactorily categorical statement that the Persian Government never had the intention to dispossess the company, but merely desired to clear the ground for a more “equitable' concession. It is perhaps not unduly cynical to wonder whether the intentions of the Persian Government were not, in some degree, influenced by the discovery that His Majesty's Government, of whose intervention Feroughi complained, as he was bound to do, displayed a lively interest in the matter. 3. Presumably, this interview is an outline of the Persian case as it will be presented at Geneva. I understand that the archives of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Finance have been ransacked in the endeavour to provide documentary proof of the political pressure exercised by His Majesty’s Govern ment in order to obtain the concession for Mr. D’Arcy. 4. Mr. Lyons has told me that the Minister for Foreign Affairs refused to answer a number of his questions directed to obtaining some indication of the concessions which the Persian Government hope to obtain from the company. 1 here can be no doubt that refusal in this case is a synonym for inability, and I fancy that it is not unfair to ascribe past and present disagreements to the inability of the Persians to be precise in their demands; they always know they want more, but do not like to say how much lest they introduce an element of finality and then discover that they might have got more than they had asked for. “Le mieux is unquestionably “ Fennemi du bien.' 5. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 275). I have, &amp;c. R. H. HOARE. Enclosure in No. 1 . Interview on the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Dispute, given by His Highness Mohammad Ali Khan Feroughi, Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, to Mr. Eugene Lyons, Manager, Moscow Bureau, United Press of America, at Tehran, on December 24, 1932. l Rotes. ( 1 ) 1 HERE assisted at this interview Mirza Hossein Khan Ala, until recently Persian Minister at Paris and now appointed one of the two ersian delegates to present to the Council of the League of Nations Persia's case m the matter of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company dispute. k 6 ^ n ^ erv ^ ew is reported in the form of questions and answers. The c i l i estlon had been previously submitted by Mr. Lyons to the Minister for Foreign p a , lrS ‘ answers were prepared in the Minister’s own handwriting in the msian language. They were then translated into English by the Ministry’s ans ator. And that English translation w 7 as carefullv corrected bv the Minister, assisted by Mr. Ala. thp ^ uestlon So. 1 .—What, in your Highness's judgment, will be the result of eneva action on the Anglo-Persian question ? [691 m —1 ] B2 Answer No. 1.—You may be aware that we were the first to entertain the idea of referring this case to the Council of the League of Nations, the reason being the unfriendly attitude of the British Government in this oil question, and the threats and the pressure which that Government brought to bear upon us. As a matter of fact, there was no ground for such an attitude to be taken by the British Government, because the Persian Government simultaneously with the annulment of the D’Arcy Concession, intimated to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company its willingness to negotiate a new and fairer agieement based upon the respect of the rights of both parties. But it is not clear to me for what ulterior motive the British Government found it necessary to interfere in an affair which involved only the Persian Government and the company. \t first the British Government declared that they would refer the case in Question to the Permanent Court of International Justice at The Hague, but the Persian Government having questioned the competency of the above court, in this special case, and having hinted that they might be led to refer this matter to the Council of the League, the British Government hastened to take the first step ; invoking article 15 of the Covenant, they brought the controversy into the category of disputes that might lead to a rupture. \ow the Persian Government have always believed in the League ot hations and made it their policy to settle differences by peaceful means. They were amon- the first to adhere to the League and have constantly sought to co-operate with that institution. They are signatories of the Briand-Kellogg Pact and o numerous arbitration conventions with other countries. It was therefore natural for them relying as they did upon the justice of then case, to think of appealing to the Council and of welcoming the step taken by the British Government to bring the matter before that august assembly. \\ r e are. however, at a loss to know why the British Government have thought fit to interfere in an affair which concerns solely the Persian Government and a private company. . , „ i. n * Furthermore, we cannot conceive of any reason why the British Government should have considered this as a dispute which might lead to a rupture ot diplomatic relations, and, basing themselves on this ground, have invoked the provisions of article 15 of the Covenant. Indeed, the Persian Government have not only manifested their desire to negotiate a new agreement with the company, but have assured the British Government that, pending an amicable settlement with the company, they would refrain from interfering with the latter s operations and activities in Persia. . , As a matter of fact, since the cancellation of the D Arcy Concession, tne Persian Government have taken no steps whatsoever against the company an not one incident prejudicial to the interests of the company has taken place in JP6I*Slcl. This being the position, I do not believe that the Council of the League will have much difficulty in settling the question submitted to its appreciation. It will become evident that no ground existed for any threat or pressure to brought to bear upon Persia by the British Government in the discussion be w the Persian Government and the company. Moreover, the nature of the isp has been such as to dispel all thought of any diplomatic rupture happ e between the two Governments. It would have been much more ex P e ^ ien ; 1 t : ons British Government had not stepped in; and would have allowed the ne $.° j a ]j to go on between the Persian Government and the company unhampered. • ^ probability the two parties might have reached an agreement and arrive a understanding which would guarantee the mutual interests of both parties. ^ Now, coming to a different phase of the question, you will agree wi that public opinion everywhere and even in England recognises the reluctance of the Persian nation to be bound by a concession granted mo j?L 0Ilg thirty years ago under extremely one-sided and unfavourable con ^ ^ Moreover, the present Government in Persia considers the said conc ? ss1 ?? verD - in contradiction with its best interests. Why then, should not the Persian ^ ment proceed to revise the said concession; and why should she over ^ disregard the just claims and the best interests of the nation simply beca^ ignorant Government in the past has signed an unsatisfactory c 0 . I ?f' t raC t j ia t the With the points in our favour I see no reason and no probabnuy ^ Council of the League should require of Persia an attitude incompat 1 ^ ^ her rights and interests. It is with this spirit of confidence in the jus ic3 r cause and our assurance in the sense of international justice and the uprightness of the members of the Council that we are proceeding to Geneva; and we are hopeful of a satisfactory conclusion of this affair. Question No. 2. —Who will represent your country before the League in this matter? If a special mission is being sent from Tehran, who will be its head and its members ? Answer No. 2. —Yes, a special mission is being sent to Geneva for this purpose. The principal members of this mission are : His Excellency Davar, the Minister of Justice, and his Excellency Ala, our recent Minister in Paris, formerly Minister in Washington, and for several years a delegate of Persia to the League of Nations. The said mission will leave for Geneva very shortly. Question No. 3.—Pending settlement of the conflict, is there any possibility that the status quo, as to operation of the fields, &amp;c., will be disturbed ? Answer No. 3.—The answer to this question has been given along with the first question, namely, that the Persian Government, hoping to reach a new agreement with the company, has definitely expressed her attitude of non interference with the activities of the company. Question No. 4. —On what right, either in the concession itself or in inter national law, does Persia base itself in cancelling the concession? What is the purpose of the annulment—did Persia actually expect to take control of the properties or was it a method of obtaining more favourable conditions? Does the existing concession in any way hamper Persia’s great plans for modernisation ? Is its revision essential to His Majesty’s policy of national unification and economic advance? Answer No. 4. —It is an undeniable fact that petroleum is the most important source of natural wealth that Persia possesses. In the modern world, even in countries like the United States of America, whose economic power and prestige is not comparable at all with that of Persia, petroleum is regarded as a valuable economic asset. While Persia, unfortunately, owing to her geographical position and to historical calamities, has been deprived of other sources of natural wealth— lack of great rivers and the natural aridity of her climate are great obstacles towards the development of her agriculture—there are also great natural hindrances towards the development of an industrial Persia; in short, whatever' measures are taken for the advancement of either agriculture or industry, or in the shape of road and railway construction for the betterment of commerce, &amp;c.. all are met with unsurmountable obstacles. As a result, the development of Persia requires a long period and a good deal of patience, and an enormous amount of capital. These being the circumstances, do you think the Persian Government can afford to give up such an important source of wealth as her oil-fields, and overlook the best interests of the country ? Now, I leave it to your good judgment; suppose the oil resources of America had been leased to somebody on the basis of an idiot ic transaction, such as the D’Arcy Concession, how would the American nation feel about it; would they stand such an outrageous situation? I can assure you that the Persian Government and people have never had in mind the thought of laying hands on the properties of the company. They do not disregard the pioneer work of the company in the exploitation of these natural resources; but it is the express desire of the Persian Government that both parties to the transaction should receive their due share of the profits. This has been the principal motive for the action of the Persian Government in cancelling the D’Arcy Concession. Persia wants to obtain her proper and legitimate share of her natural resources. She seeks to acquire a share of the profits which would be concomitant with her rights of ownership, and the troubles and the sacrifices she has to undergo for the sake of the security and the safety of the company. With what has been said before about the obstacles in the way of Persia’s economic development, it is needless to mention how essential a new and equitable basis a £ reenien t is to the economic interests of Persia. The case is self-evident, and speaks for itself; and I think that no man with a grain of justice in his ma ^®' a P could deny this necessity. We have now to consider very briefly the arguments which Persia advances or the justification of her action in the annulment of the D’Arcy Concession. ?.^ e ^ rs f place, the company has shown on many occasions its unwillingness to a ide by the terms of the original concession. Can it be maintained that this [691 m— 1 ] B 2 1 F4 Government alone is obliged to comply with the provisions of the contract? Surel) , when one of the parties to an agreement shows any disinclination to execute the clauses and conditions of the contract, the other party is automatically released from its obligations to respect the said contract. This is not the time nor the place to go into any detail as regards the failure of the company in fulfilling its obligations. An attempt to enumerate the instances of negligence on the part of the company would lengthen our interview. For instance, the company has not adequately complied with its undertaking as regards payment of royalties to the Persian Government. \\ hile enjoying no immunity from internal taxation, the company has refused to pay the said taxes. Besides, the said company has not given the opportunity to the Persian Govern ment to avail itself of the right of inspection into its accounts. In the case of the determination of ordinary and capital expenditures and the inclusion of the latter in royalty calculations, the company has acted against the spirit of fair play. There are a host of other arguments which will be given at the appropriate time and place. Question No. 5. —There have been hints in the foreign press about American and Soviet-Russian interest in the Anglo-Persian conflict. Is there any truth in these allegations ? .4 nswer No. 5 .—1 emphatically deny the said allegations. It is to be much regretted that after the lapse of a period of several years from the accession of His Imperial Majesty to the Throne of Persia, during which space of time the world has witnessed the deeds of the Shah’s Government for the liberation of Persia from foreign influences, troublemongers can still succeed in spreading such distortions of actual facts. It has been my good fortune and a great honour to have had in various capacities a close and perfect contact with the national and international policies of His Majesty from the very first days of the establishment of his reign. I have been one of those persons who have been instrumental in the carrying out of His Majesty’s decisions for the advancement of the country. I can, therefore, explicitly declare with pride and perfect assurance to the world that the protection of the integrity and independence and the national rights of Persia has been the axis around which the wheel of our diplomacy has been turning for the last decade. In this respect, the present Government of Persia has shown its complete freedom from the influences of outside groups of Govern ments. I am sure of my ground, and I can assure you of this fact, that those persons who endeavour to poison the public opinion of the world in this matter cannot produce the smallest pretext for the justification of their false claims. Question No. 6 .—What would be Persia’s course of action if England were to land forces to protect British lives and properties ? Answer No. 6 .—As I have explicitly made it plain in the answers to the foregoing questions, British life and property are well protected, and there is no probability of encroachment upon their rights in this country. Therefore, it does not seem logical to me to imagine that the British Government would take such action as you mention. Should the contrary happen, the British Government will undoubtedly be considered as an aggressor in relation to Persia, and the Persian Government will not hesitate to take the steps which such an inconceivable attitude on the part of the British Government would entail. Question No. 7. —Is Persia still willing to negotiate its grievances directlj with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company ? (a) W ould you withdraw the annulment as a preliminary to such negotiations ? (b) Would you insist on negotiating in Tehran, or would London or some neutral point be acceptable ? Answer No. 7.—The first part of this question has been answered already.J but the answer to the second part is in the negative. The Persian Governmem sees no reason for the withdrawal of the annulment of the D’Arcy Concession. The answer to the third part of your question is in the affirmative^; the Persian \ Government will insist upon the negotiations with the company taking place m Tehran. Question No. 8 .—Has your Highness any message—on the oil dispute 01 an) other phase of your situation—which I could transmit to the press of the world5 Answer No. 8 .—I shall be much obliged to you if you will kindly convey the above statements to the press of the world, and emphasise the following points, namely, that the action of the Persian Government in cancelling the D’Arcy Concession has not been prompted by ill will or prejudice towards the company; neither should it be interpreted as an inimical gesture against foreigners in ^ general. Nor was it intended to signify that the Persian Government does not put any real value in the friendship of Great Britain. Our action simply means that we want to protect our just rights and interests. We do sincerely believe that international goodwill and good understanding can only be attained when the nations of the world recognise and respect one another’s rights. Friendly relations can exist only when agreements and conventions are not established in a one-sided manner. I have one more request for you, and that is to bring the following fact before your colleagues in the newspaper world : F rom a moral standpoint it is against the integrity and the moral prestige of a newspaper to publish fictitious and false news. As a matter of fact, newspapers have a great moral responsibility; it is through them that public opinion has to be enlightened and led towards the truth. To follow the opposite course would be treason towards their responsibility as torch-bearers of truth and dispensers of goodwill among the nations. I am talking of ideal journalism; but when we come down to bare facts it becomes obvious how far removed we are from the above ideal. When the news of the cancellation of the D’Arcy Concession reached the world, immediately after its publication some newspapers in different countries began to publish false news and rumours. Some of them started to talk about brigandage and lack of security in various parts of Persia, and especially in the southern region, where the Anglo- Persian Oil Company’s premises are located. It is, I think, perfectly clear to you during your sojourn in the country, that the situation is absolutely normal. Furthermore, security reigns supreme all over the country, particularly in the oil regions, where things are exactly as they were before. Some other newspapers have been talking about the financial needs of Persia, and that she is compelled to sell the Crown jewels and the peacock throne in order to obtain funds. Yet again, newspapers of the same type have reported that the British Government is sending an army and her battleships to Persia. For what purpose are such false rumours disseminated abroad ? Is it ethically becoming of the journalistic profession to have to sacrifice their integrity for the sake of sensationalism, and in this way mislead their readers? Is it not better for the newspapers to endeavour to soothe raging prejudices and to try for the spreading of goodwill and understanding among nations, rather than to poison the public mind and aggravate the differences ? Instances of this lack of understanding of the duty which the press owes to the public have been noticed before as regards the presentation of Persian affairs. The newspapers of Europe and America on many occasions have published fictitious and false news about our Government and our country. At times this erroneous information has smacked of ridicule, and has done little credit to the intelligence of its authors. Finally, may I be permitted to point out that the publication of such news by the foreign press only serves to harm its prestige and that of its country of origin in the eyes of Persia. The spreading of these falsehoods does not do any harm to our nation in the long run; but it unfortunately leaves a residue of ill- eehng towards those who stoop to such methods. M. A.

The case/to be taken in the forthcoming session of the Council of the League v\hich opens on the 23rd January. Mr. Rendel and Sir William MaJeolm will advise Sir John Simon on behalf of the Foreign office. The general line/line which the Foreign Office propose to take is set out in their telegram of 12th January on P.Z.360 to Tehran. I understand from Mr. xiendel that it is prohahle that the hearing of our complaint will he postponea until January 25th, partly in the hope of finding an opportunity for bringing the British and Persian representatives together and possibly of discovering some formula which will admit of the resunption of negotiations between the A.P.O.C. and the Persian Government on the basis that the d’Arcy concession still remains in force. The Foreign office anticipate that in any event a rapporteur, who will probably be the Czecho-Jlovak or the Norwegian representative, will be appointed by the Council on 25th January, whose task will be to endeavour to bring the parties together, if the Persians aaopt &amp; wholly intransigent attitude and no agreement or formula can be devised on the basis of the continued validity of the concession, the case may then have to go to a committee or possibly | be referred to The Hague Court for an advisory opinion. 3.

Your telegram No. 1, Is it not a fact that objections to my formula are matuer 01 form rather than of substance and that a little manipulation by draftsmen versed in League procedure of which I an ignorant would remove objections which you indicate, e.g, I intended that my concluding words should be in fact 'keep the shadow of Council hanging over proceed- ingo and I did not realize that if we agreed to 'removal 01 question from agenda' those same words would not in case of need enable us to put it on again. 2. With regard to paragraph 6 of your telegram, Persian contention is I think rather that rupture could only have been a possibility if Persirn Government had proceeded to give effect to cancellation by taking active measures to control, hamper or dispossess company and if h is Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom had taken spending measures to protect it but, as they have Puolicly stated they have no intention of interfering with company's operations, ail possibility of breach is excluded,, -minisoer for Foreign Affairs has argued in SS ~° n L '^ me ^hat this attitude constitutes a virtual e^aer to Views of His Majesty’s Government but at Per Qians might rather take the line that it renders interference fainterference of both Council end His Majesty's Government superfluous and from that line it would only be short sten 5&gt;VAxj£jL&gt;nrv«sOlX- to sulky statemeat, i.e, Persian Government would acquiesce in any decision that cancellation was ultra vires but would decline to negotiate new agreement and seek to attain their ends by means of internal taxation etc, 4= Lastly my formula would involve complete admission by Persian Government that matter remains an inter governmental issue throughout negotiations between Persian Government and Company and I thought this would suffice to ensure 'basis of equality,' 5. I quite realise that if vie viqtq dealing with an ordinary government it would probably be easier to formulate at, rather than before, Geneva, but special features of present case make me think that at least some exploratory v/ork should be done beforehand. It may be regarded as certain that with Teymourtache out of the Picture there will he no initiative from Persian side, though in interview with correspondent of United Press V'uich should appear in tomorrow^ newspapers the Shah said we hope the Council will not take position of hempering efforts of Persian Government to bring about amicable and equitaole adjustment &gt; u Addressed to the Foreign Office No, 3, repeated to the Government of India No, 1 ,* Thi „ D 0(?1 mifint is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be —““— returned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.] 14.;/l'//34)o To c^jPer xolc r orci'jn -m to I To ?oore (Tehran) 0 CixicOi January 12th 1933o 2*25 p«n© l\ 0 c 8 t AAAA^AAAAAA.\AAAA Your telegrem No©3 (of January 6th.

For this reason it seems essential that ^negotiations should take place either (a) on (accepted but disguised) basis that concession remains in existence and will so continue until something fresh is agreed upon, or (b) on bs.sis that question which His Majesty's Government have brought before Council of validity of Persian government's action in cancelling the concession remains before the League, even though suspended during progress of negotiations between Persian government and Company, and will have to be decided by the League failing a successful issue to those negotiations. 3. Such a decision is not in any case likely to be given at impending council meeting, since function of Council at this stage will be not so much that of a tribunal as of a conciliator.

Tehran, December 17, 1932. ^ ’ WITH reference to my despatch No. 532 of the 14th December, enclosing ti ie f u }| text of the Persian note of the 12th December about the cancellation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company concession, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a record of a statement made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs at a special session of the Majlis, held on Thursday, the 15th December, together with a record of some of the other speeches. No motion was placed before the House, and no vote taken. , . ' 2’ There is nothing of note in Feroughi s statement, beyond what appears to be an assurance, given in language as unqualified as the circumstances would permit, that no interference in the company’s operations was intended. The o-eneral tone, like that of the more recent press utterances, is less assertive and on the whole more conciliatory than the comments of a week ago. It is at least admitted that “ equity ” should apply to the company as well as the Government. 3 . There has been no time before the departure of the bag to gain any idea of the impression upon the Persian Government and press of the news that His Majesty’s Government have taken the question to the League of Nations instead of the Permanent Court. But it may be of interest to record that the immediate reaction of one or two intelligent Persians was to regard a reference to Geneva as a less severe step than a reference to The Hague. 4 . The only newspaper comment so far available is a short comment in the Shafaq-i-Surkh on the British official news, stating that His Majesty’s Govern ment had decided to refer the issue to the Council of the League of Nations. The Shafaq-i-Surkh remarks that Reuter’s correspondent appears to have made a mistake in the above news, because in their note the Persian Government expressed the view that a reference to the League of Nations would become necessary if and when the British Government made themselves an obstacle to the progress of discussions between the company and the Persian Government and brought coercion to bear against the latter. Otherwise the Persian Government consider this controversy to be definitely an ordinary internal matter between a business company and themselves, which should be solved according to the ordinary laws of Persia. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 263), the Hon. the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire (No. 222 ), His Majesty’s consul at Ahwaz (No. 99), and ta His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad (No. 131). I have, &amp;c. R, H. HOARE. Enclosure in No. 1. Record of a Statement by M. Feroughi. , Highness Feroughi read in the Majlis the text of notes exchanged with £ British Government on the subject of cancellation of the D’Arcy Concession, er which he made the following statement:— The trend of events has so far been as reported. The honourable Deputies th 0 r&gt; U1 ^ wel ! aware —and the contents of the notes also make it clear—why e Persian Government has cancelled the D’Arcy Concession. Briefly, it had Wo reas °ns : One was that, in principle, it was not satisfied with the Concession [691 b— 1 ]because it did not agree with our legitimate interests The other was that tb Anglo-Persian Oil Company have not complied with the terms of this sail Concession and therefore it was loss heaped on loss for the Government. At W the Persian Government came to the conclusion that as long as it considered til D’Arcy Concession as valid, it would not succeed in ameliorating the position For these reasons it cancelled the Concession, but it had no other intention ul doing so than to place its relations with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company on sound basis, which would safeguard the interests of both parties equitably It was due to this consideration that in the letter addressed by the Minister of Finance to the representative of the said company in respect of cancellation of the D'Arcy Concession it was pointed out that the Government was prepared to enter into negotiations with the company for the conclusion of a new Concession We were hopeful that at last the company, for the sake of meeting the views of the Persian Government and the nation, would be prepared to accede to our request. Unfortunately our expectation has not yet been fulfilled and the inter ference of the British Government and the notes which I have read to the honourable Deputies have prevented the Government from beginning negotiations with the company in order to arrive at a satisfactory solution to this question. “ One thing more has been noticed which has added to our regret, and that is the misrepresentations which are being made in the British and foreign press. People are picturing the action of the Persian Government, its words and its deeds as contrary to truth, and they represent that this action of the Persian Government has been taken under other influences. Some have declared the Persian Government as possessing anti-foreign feelings, and stated that the cancellation of the D’Arcy Concession has arisen from that fact. Others speal of disturbances in districts where the oil industry is situated and talk of inter ferences therewith, thus creating disturbance in the public mind; while everybody knows that in these days and at the present time perfect security and safety exists throughout Persia, especially in the districts where the oil industry is situated. In regard to foreigners also, no one has shown any animosity against nor interference with them. “ The Persian Government has not interfered or committed any aggression in regard to the oil industry and, as heretofore, considers the said industry as being included in its protection. It has, in addition, as a safety measure, increased its protectionary measures, and it is certain that no damage will be done to the company and its organisation in Persia, unless someone may consider it to its own interest to intentionally cause damage thereto. “ Finally, the only intention of the Persian Government is to protect iu own rights and interests. The Government says that this oil and its derivatives, which are produced in Persia, are the property of the Persian nation and that the nation should benefit from it in proportion to its right of ownership. What has been paid up to the present is insufficient, and its acceptance would create a bad name for the Government. If there was a day when Persians or then rulers were negligent or corrupt and gave away this national source of weai in a deceitful transaction—and even if within the limits of the same transaction they did not provide for the safeguarding of the country’s interests—there is no reason why the same method and procedure should be continued to-day, when all eyes have been opened. Of course the company, which has invested and employed its financial and technical capital in this source of wealth, should benefit equitably from it, but it is not just that the nation which owns tin- wealth should be deprived of its just share and taken advantage of. This is ou justifiable statement, which we have repeatedly said and written, and which w will continue to say as long as our rights are not provided for. f , Apart from this fact, the Persian Government has no ill will for British Government nor has it any enmity for the company or opposition to foreigners. It demands its own rights and nothing else, and it will hv eve means and method seek to obtain its rights. I hope that this statement will ® the matter quite clear and will remove all misrepresentations which may been made.” December 15, 1932.&gt; l\\^ \ 2 ^ b/i i ier that tli. 18 of this saffi ; nment J At laa t considered tfe f ng the positio, intention k ^ L ODipany QD ^ irties equitably ^the Minister if : can cellation of was prepared to new Concession ing the views of 0 accede to our d and the inter- ive read to the ing negotiations this question, regret, and that td foreign press, s words and its of the Persiau ve declared the stated that the t.

'ECTION p.z. No. 1. PERSIA. CONFIDENTIAL. [E 6842/3880/34] Mr. Hoare to Sir John Simon.—(Received December 28.) (No. 525.) ’ Sir, Tehran, December 9 , 1932. AS I have reported by telegram I communicated to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs yesterday morning the note contained in your telegram No. 135 of the 7 th December informing the Persian Government that His Majesty’s Government insisted on the withdrawal of the cancellation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company concession as a preliminary condition of further negotiations. (A copy of the note is enclosed for convenience of reference.) 2 . My intention when I decided not to deliver the note myself was to emphasise the fact that there was no room for any further argument. However, it transpired that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who, with the rest of the Cabinet, had accompanied the Shah to the Turkoman races, had been held up by a heavy fall of snow during the last two days. The acting oriental secretary, Mr. Trott, handed the note to Mirza Ghaffar Khan Jelal, the head of the English section of the Ministry, who promised to let me know as soon as the note was in his chief’s hands. He telephoned in the evening that he had delivered it at about 5 o’clock 3. The British Official Wireless reporting the statement made in the House of Commons by Mr. Eden on the 5th December was not published until the evening of the 7th December, the editor of the Messager explaining when questioned that, having referred to the police for guidance, he was instructed not to publish it, pending, it must be presumed, a reference to higher authority which was not immediately available. Since then it has been reproduced in the Persian press on the majority of which it has had a sobering effect, the general tone being that as His Majesty’s Government obviously, though wrongly, thought that they were upholding a legitimate British right, it was only natural and hardly alarming that they should take the view formulated in Mr. Eden’s statement. W ith regard to the general public, I am told, though I cannot vouch foi the statement, that there is already a sense of apprehension and a fear of untoward consequences. 4. In diplomatic and European circles generally there is naturally an eager ope that the Persian Government have at long last definitely and hopelessly over- reaciea themselves amd are about to be brought to book. As an instance of the general feeling I will record that the Belgian Minister, M. Paternotte de la ai lee, who only presented his letters of credence on the 27th November came i, me ^ hat conjunction with the Belgian experts he had been discussing AT p o le Persian Government the electrical concession which was regarded as ann uve ', er . s leaving present. ” The Persian Government were showing a most bv tb 11 ^ i s P^ r ^ an( l in fact, yielded on practically every point raised icrr a e :£] aris - -^e felt, however, and the representatives of the Belgian company r?snp w Rn nuffi^that in view of the action taken by the Persian Government in inv^ ^ Arc y Concession, it would be folly for a foreign company to this &gt; m0ney ! n Persia. Fie would, in all probability, advise his Government in Govern * 186 fu u 1 r ^ e ’ i n .

The paramount consideration is, of course, the fact that the (V hardly counts at all, and that what little 1 know of the Shah is not deri e ^ n ? ent personal contact. ved ^ 7. As my despatches have shown for some time past, dissatisfa t' incrrasing at an alarming rate; the malcontents assert that the only thi 10 V S prevents dissatisfaction from manifesting itself in open rebellion is the d at seated belief that the present regime is whole-heartedly supported b Majesty’s Government without whose previous consent no important step is t f The existence of this otherwise incredible belief is abundantly confirmed fact that the first and unquestioning reaction of the general public incl^ff one member of the Cabinet, to the news of the cancellation of the Ando-Pe 1 ^ Oil Company concession was that the whole thing was simply a put-inTd! betwen the Government and the company in order to render the extension of £ concession and an increase in the Persian Government’s share in the profit 6 acceptable to the Majlis and shareholders respectively. ^ 8 . This being the state of affairs, it is not unnatural to feel a little unea v as to what will happen when it is generally realised that a detested regime W issued an outrageous challenge to His Majesty’s Government and that the challenge has been taken up. 9. Again, it is impossible to feel entirely confident that the Shah’s political acuteness has not been finally blunted by the enjoyment over seven years of a gradually increasing and now absolute despotism. Ugly stories of his violence circulate with increasing frequency, the latest being that he marched into Diba s room at the Palace in order personally to dismiss him (see my despatch No 508 of the 2 nd December). Not finding him His Majesty vented* his displeasure on the furniture. In these circumstances it is natural to have in mind the observation once made to me by a profound student of affairs that no man can tor long support the mental strain imposed by unlimited and unquestioned power, and therefore to wonder whether the Shah will realise that a swift retreat is the only issue from the untenable position into which he has recklessly thrust himself. J Finally, the Soviet Government may welcome the opportunity of fishing in troubled waters, without running any great risk. 11 . The fact, however, that I have recorded these forebodings which at a distance must appear unreal, does not mean that I do not fully realise that the present incident may very properly be considered as the sort of case which must eait with strictly on its merits without regard for events which may possibly ensue, as the result of the dramatic shattering of one of the bases of the Shah's strength or m consequence of an outburst of Imperial rage. -c f passage at the end of Turkey in Europe, “ Ulysses wro e o iurkey as a sword with a contempt for all that can be cut and how the ^■^ni 1 , 1 ^ i° SW( ?Fd turned its contempt into stupidity.

Such a cancellation is a confiscatory measure and a clear breach of international law committed against a British company and His Majesty’s Government feel obliged to take the matter up in the exercise of their right to protect the interests of their nationals. His Majesty’s Govern ment liave°from the outset, as pointed out in my note of the 2 nd December, and as repeated in the statement made by the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the House of Commons on the 5th December, been anxious that an '-amicable settlement may be reached between the Persian Government and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. His Majesty’s Government cannot, however, regard the^Persian Government’s note of the 3rd December as offering any satisfactory basis for such a settlement. As I explained on the 2nd December His Majesty’s Government consider the action of the Persian Government in cancelling the concession to be an inadmissible breach of the terms of that instrument and have therefore requested the withdrawal of the notification made to the company on the 27th November. Since the Persian Government in their reply adduce no argument which can be regarded as in any way justifying their' action, His Majesty’s Government must reiterate their request. ' 2.' Should the Persian Government be unwilling to withdraw their notifica tion of cancellation of the concession within one week from the date of the present note, that is by Thursday, the 15th December, His Majesty’s Government will have no alternative to referring the dispute, which has arisen between them and the Persian Government in regard to the legality of the Persian Govern ment’s action, to the Permanent Court of International Justice at The Hague as a matter of urgency under the optional clause. In so doing His Majesty's Government would request the Court to indicate under article 41 of the statute the provisional measures which ought to be taken to preserve their rights. 3 Further, I am instructed to state that my Government do not accept the attitude outlined in paragraph 3 of your note'to the effect that the Persian Government cannot regard themselves as responsible for any damage accruing to the company. On the contrary, I have the honour to inform your Highness categorically that His Majesty’s Government will hold the Persian Government directly responsible for any damage to the company’s interests, any interference with their premises or business activities in Persia or any failure to afford the company adequate protection, and in the event of any such damage occurring His Majesty’s Government will regard themselves as entitled to take all such measures as the situation may demand for the company’s protection.

Dispute between the Government of the United Kingdom and the Government of Persia. M. SEPAHBODI, representative of Persia, came to the Council table. THE PRESIDENT : My colleagues will have received Document C.841.1932.VII containing the memorandum of the Government of the United Kingdom on the subject of the dispute concerning the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. Document C.844.1932.VII, which contained the letter addressed to the Secretary-General on the 17th December by the permanent delegate of Persia accredited to the League of Nations, has also been circulated. In this letter, the permanent delegate of Persia communicated a telegram from his Government, informing him that it had intended to lay the dispute before the Council, and that pending an agreement with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company it had not taken any steps against the company and did not intend to do so. The Persian Govern ment thought, however, that the Council should not begin the examination of this question until sufficient time had been allowed for the despatch to Geneva of a representative from Tehran with all the documentary material in the possession of the Tehran Government. This appears to me to be a reasonable request, and the Council may wish to postpone consideration of the matter until the January session. In these circumstances, I have sent the following telegram to the two parties yesterday, the 18th December :— I am fully confident that pending examination by the Council of the dispute between the Governments of the United Kingdom and Persia concerning the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, the two Governments will retrain from any act or step that might aggravate or extend the dispute.’^ 1 ) Since this matter has been laid before the Council under article 15 of the lJ e J] an ’ .

SIR WILLIAM MALKIN : I have to express to the Council, on behalf of Sir John Simon, his great regret that he has been prevented by indispo^tj^ from coming to Geneva for to-day's meeting of the Council. It is a matter of great satisfaction to His Majesty's Government in the Cnited Kingdom that the Council has been able to meet to-day to take cognisance of the question which they have found it necessary to bring before it Hk Majesty's Government were anxious that the matter should come before the Council without delay, because they felt that the situation resulting from the action of the Persian Government in cancelling the concession held by the Anglo Persian Oil Company contained elements which required it to be dealt with the Council as a matter of urgency. Accordingly. I am grateful to you! Air. President, for the action which, as you have just informed the Council Vou and the Secretary-General with your assent have thought it proper to take- and I trust that the result of that action will be to ensure that the matter will be considered here in due course without the occurrence of anv events which might call for the immediate intervention of the Council. On the merits of the dispute, it would. I conceive, be premature for me to say anything at this stage: the case of His Majesty's Government is stated m the memorandum which has been communicated to the Secretary-General in accordance with article 15. paragraph 2 of the Covenant, and is in the hands of the members of the Council.! 3 ) But. as you have stated, Mr. President, that tie matter will figure on the agenda of the meeting which opens on the 23rd January A’33. I desire to express the earnest hope of my Government that the matter will he ready for consideration by the Council on that date. I recognise that tie Persian Government are entitled to a reasonable period for the preparation of their case, but it will. I think, be agreed that His Majesty's Government hate not been dilatory in the preparation and presentation of their memorandum. &lt;ih«, as five weeks will elapse before the 23rd January. His Majesty's Government may.^F submit, fairly expect that the case of the Persian Government will read the Secretary-General in time to allow the Council to take the matter into consideration at the session which opens on that date. M. ^EPAHBODI: Mr. President, at 8 p.m. on the 14th December I received two letters from the Secretary-General communicating copies of the letter from s Excellency Sir John minion and of the Foreign Office telegram. These ocuments informed me that His Britannic Majesty s Government had requested an urgent meeting of the Council for the 19th or 20th December. The Foreign , e telegram stated that the I nited Kingdom Government's memorandum would be communicated shortly. I received the English text of the memorandum at ' P -M- on the loth December only. On receiving the first two letters I informed niy j-overnment or the subject of the request of His Britannic Majesty's Govem- men . summary of the memorandum, which contains twentv-four pages, wu also telegraphed to my Government at midnight on the dav 'on which it was receive y Government therefore is not yet in possession of the necessary par ic ars and has not had time to form a complete and exact idea of the reasons ^ lc h His Britannic Majesty's Government has seen fit to invoke article 13 p - e m COCLIlex ion with a dispute between Persia and the Angk- Persian Oil Company. m hVu midda F 011 ] 7t h December I received a telegramf‘) from mv Govern- .. i ^ t J ne L LP te nts of which I duly communicated to the Secretary-General tjf u. e ‘ , , T s LX) mmun ication nas been circulated to the members of the Council, but it would, I think, be advisable that I should read part of it here - rr- are n&lt; ^ ln possession of the request addressed to the Council j ^tennic Majesty s Government we are not aware in what manner ana on what bases the Council has been asked to deal with this question We cannot therefore come to any decision in the matter.

We have therefore no objection to the matter’s being laid before the Council. Should the Council intend examining whether the Persian Government was or was not entitled to cancel the concession, it is obvious that the Council will deem it necessary to wait until a Persian representative can attend. We consider, moreover, that prior to adopting any attitude whatsoever the Council must first hear the Persian Government’s statement. As the discussion of this question will require the presence of a special representative who will have to be sent f r om Tehran, and as the documents are at present in that city, it will be materially impossible for the Council to begin its examination of the matter immediately. Furthermore, as the Persian Government has already stated that pending an agreement with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company it has not taken and has no intention of taking any measures against that under taking, there is no reason for considering the matter as urgent.” As you will realise, my Government is only asking for the necessary time to send as its representatives special delegates, who will have to come from Tehran. I therefore propose that the Council should adjourn until they arrive. On reading the British memorandum I was glad to see that in paragraph 35 the United Kingdom Government states : “ His Majesty’s Government are most anxious that the present dispute shall not disturb the friendly relations which have hitherto existed between the Persian Government and themselves and they have every hope that the action of the Council will result in amicable and equitable settlement of the dispute.' It adds that His Majesty’s Government will do everything in their power to co-operate to this end. As the Persian Government is no less anxious than the United Kingdom Government to maintain the friendly relations which exist between the two countries and by which they have been united for many years, may I venture, without anticipating my Government’s opinion, to put* forward a personal consideration. I wonder whether the present situation really necessitated an appeal to article 15 ? In conclusion, I renew my proposal for an adjournment pending the arrival of the special delegates who will be provided with the necessary documents and instructions. THE PRESIDENT : My colleagues will join me, I am sure, in expressing the Council’s satisfaction with the action taken by the Secretary-General and with what he proposed to do by way of preparation for our work. Pending the Persian Government’s communication of its statement and the completion of the Secretary-General’s arrangements as provided for in article 15 of the Covenant, the Council might perhaps decide at once to place this question on the agenda of its next ordinary session on the 23rd January, 1933. I think I shall be voicing the unanimous view of the Council by expressing to the two parties its full confidence that nothing will be done that might prejudice he Council s action or aggravate or enlarge the dispute. May I add that the proceaure which it is the clear duty of the Council to follow does not, of course, exclude the possibility of an understanding between the two parties. The 'procedure proposed by the President was approved. (M. Sepahbodi withdrew.)

On the 7th December a celebration was held in front of the house of Seyyid Abu Talib, one of the new candidates for the Majlis in the Khiaban-i-Zand, about 200 yards from this consulate. Multi-coloured electric lights framed the house and platform. The heads of the Finance, Post and Telegraph and Police Departments were present, in addition to a’small number of merchants. The meeting did hot seem to attract a large crowd of ordinary citizens, of whom not more than a hundred gathered around. It is interesting that amongst the merchants were some whose feelings cannot be very strongly anti-foreign, as, for instance, the Dehkan Brothers and Hidayat, the Ford agent. The editor of the Gulistan was again the main speaker and made a speech not materially different from the two previous ones. After this the merchants met in the garden of the same house in a building called the “Chamber of Commerce.' where the repetition of the same speeches took place. 3. The effect of these various meetings and local newspaper articles has certainly been to arouse a certain feeling of animosity to foreigners and foreign institutions. A reluctance to salute or show signs of recognition has been noticed by Europeans amongst Persians previously quite friendly. The Khan Bahadur of this consulate, who has a large number of friends, has been requested by some to wear the Pahlavi cap if he visits them or goes walking with them While a few Persians seem genuinely to feel that the denunciation of the concession was, if not dishonourable, at least impolitic, the majority seem to be swayed by the carefully nursed feeling that a victory has been scored over the foreigner. However, a rumour which is now making itself heard, to the effect that under a new arrangement kerosene and petrol will be considerably dearer may serve to temper this enthusiasm. 4. On the 9th December wireless news of the note presented to the Persian Government, correct in substance, but omitting that part concerning reference of the dispute to the I ermanent Court of International Justice caused considerable apprehension amongst British residents in Shiraz. This apprehension was calmed to some extent on the reception of the correct text of the note on the next av but again aroused by a rumour of forcible measures being undertaken by the Persian Government to prevent the export of oil from Mohammerah. The istance of Shiraz from any centre directly concerned in the question makes the receipt ot reliable news very slow, and in the meantime the variety of rumours, some, such as that of an already existing new arrangement between the Anglo- ersian Oil Company and the Persian Government, obviously false and others more credible, is confusing to those following the development of the dispute.

Section 1. Mr. Hoare to Sir John Simon.—(Received December 29.) (No. 532.) Sir. Tehran, December 14, 1932. WITH reference to my telegrams Nos. 225 and 231 of the 12th and 13th December, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a translation of the note that I have received from the Persian Government in reply to my note of the 8 th December about the cancellation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s Concession. 2. This note shows every sign of having been drafted in a great hurry, and one theory that I have heard advanced is that this was because the Shah, who had approved its general tenor at Babul, on his way back from the Turkoman races, had given orders that the reply should reach me before he himself had returned to the capital. The note, in fact, reached me on Monday morning (the 12 th December), and His Imperial Majesty arrived back that evening. 3. The note is in the handwriting, not of one of the usual munshis of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, but the head of the English section himself. The Persian style is said to resemble that of Teymourtache, though the Minister for Foreign Affairs spoke to me as if he had drafted it himself. Jelal, in his haste, wrote “My dear Minister” at the beginning of the note, but he has since explained that this was a slip on his part and that “ M. le Ministre ” is correct. It may be of some interest to record that the Persian note of the 3rd December was in a handwriting believed to be that of Ghaffari, the Under-Secretary. I am not clear what the Minister for Foreign Affairs expects to achieve by these precautions, as the contents of the notes seem to become common property in the town almost as soon as they have been despatched. The present one is published in all the newspapers to-day. 4. I have, at Feroughi’s request, supplied him with a copy of the English translation, in order that he may send it to his Legation in London. His Highness has since told the oriental secretary that, before doing so, he has made one or two very minor alterations in the text, but that these do not alter the main purport of the note in any way. 5. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 250), the Hon. the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at Bushire (No. 210), the acting British consul, Ahwaz (No. 96), and to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad (No. 128).

Qoyp , 11 le lto, to the sentence in question, I have to state that the Persian the oi! lmen ^ ^ ave re peatedly pointed out the grounds for their dissatisfaction at company s behaviour, and did not, therefore, consider that it would be [663 ff —bnecessary to repeat the repeated statements. Should the Persian f fail to conclude a new and satisfactory agreement with the company J ° V j r ? lneilt necessary, with a view to substantiating their right to cancel the p’ 1 Concession, to refer the case to the court, they (the Persian Government^ -n rc ? their arguments in detail; and it is to be regretted that the reluctance on th 61 \ •of the officials of the Imperial Government to enter into controversy and a 6 ^ in view of the goodwill they (the Persian Government) have had in th (and this fact caused me not to give in my note in detail the reasons for th of the Government in cancelling the D'Arcy Concession) has been internr Th? the officials of His Britannic Majesty’s Government as showing that theP • Government have nothing to justify the genuineness of their action Fven '^ 11 in order not to allow His Britannic Majesty’s Government to think th ul’ Imperial Government refuse to mention the reasons for the cancellation of tf concession, I hereby enumerate them briefly :— In addition to the fact that the D'Arcy Concession has not in itself U drawn up in such a way as to be compatible with the interests of Persia andth 11 the legitimate rights of the country have been tampered with at the time of tf grant of the same, the said concession was secured at a time when the interest! and welfare of the country were not being taken into view at the time of cnantiT such concessions, and when those who used to obtain these concessions toi advantage of the ignorance of the authorities of that time. Furthermore in securing those concessions, all sorts of threats and coercive measures were hein* imposed at those times in such a way that, as a result of these threats and coercive measures, the authority who granted a concession was not free to abstain from granting such concessions. Your Excellency and His Britannic Majesty’s Government will admit that the world of to-day does not accord any validity to agreements and concessions which have been imposed in such a manner, and does not consider the same as binding. Apart from the defects mentioned above, the behaviour and activities of the oil company towards the Persian Government are not even compatible with (the terms of) the same unsatisfactory concession, and the company has always failed to respect the rights of the Persian Government in accordance with the same bad and invalid concession, and has thus brought about a situation leading to the suppression of the rights of the Persian Government. For instance, according 0 ^ lc ^ Concession, the company has had to pay to the Persian Govern- ment 16 per cent, of all its income, as well as of alfthe income of the other su si lan companies without any exception. The logical result of this under- Y 11 !^ s , Y , have the right of superintending the expenditure, the amount of W ( Y s 011 c l )e deducted from the company’s income before reaching the net i ?? 0 i-vf as . we ll as the right of expressing their views in regard to the necessity i 0 ei wlse 0 the sai d expenditure. Otherwise, the revenues of Persia would a ways le exposed to the danger of diminution and decrease. But. unfortunately. ? Y ^mpany, which is noted for its prodigality and extravagance, has never YIY. ? at the ?. ersiai ? Government should have the right of supervising tie mrw r!fKh ex f )eiKltu?e before the payment of the royalty. I need not say that a Y u Y ecessa yy ex penditure which is made by the company produces a amount ° n 6 ro ^ a an&lt; ^ was causing the said revenues to fall to a ridiculous GnvprrmlTrft ’ f company has hitherto never produced, either to the Persian for it* PYrkAnrif* ° ei T ^P^culalivc, its detailed accounts, nor the vouchers Gov mint puie, and that of all its subsidiary companies, so that the Persian has also so ^ ^ assured of getting their proper revenues. The company to o iv thp Y llS f ^ ^utravention with the explicit terms of the concession. subsXtv r-o^n^ ° f , Pers,an Government from the income of all of its certain im nor tint ff S t f ven consen ted to accord to some of these companies a,^^T- nanCial ^ elp °i Ut of its in come, and has brought the same into to an annrpriahlA 1 U f e ' an ^i? as ^u 8 decreased the Persian Government’s income opDosition to thp n? X bhe company has consequently proved that it ns 111 the mm mm 1 t0 . si , v - e &gt;’ ou instances of the lack of sincerity on the part« f the company in its dealings with the Persian Government, l'should have»r write at great length. If youi .Excellency cares to refer to the documents and reports submitted by various British experts, your mind will be enlightened with regard to the company’s behaviour on various occasions on which the interests of Persia have been prejudiced. One of the proofs showing that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company has not abided by the D’Arcy Concession consists of the fact that, notwithstanding the fact that during the Great War the price of oil and oil products was constantly rising, and the demand for the same was increasing, and that Persian oil was being considered as an effective factor for the navy of the Allies and that consequently the sale of Persian oil at the world price of oil entailed enormous profits for the company, yet the company, in contravention of the explicit terms of the concession, abstained from paying the Persian Government’s royalty and in practice rendered the concession invalid. And although the Persian Govern ment have repeatedly attempted to secure their rights and settle previous accounts, it is to be regretted that the steps taken by the Government have not led to a result which the Persian Government are prepared to accept. It is likewise known to your Excellency that, according to the D’Arcv Concession, the company did not enjoy any exemption from the taxes of this country, with the exception of certain instances of customs exemption and that the company was at the same time amenable and subject to all internal Persian laws. Although an income tax has come into force since the year 1309 in Persia and although the company was bound to obey the laws of Persia it has so far refused to pay its taxes, and has demonstrated its defiance of the laws of the country. 1 here will certainly be no need for me to explain to your Excellencv the present development and expansion of the company and its wealth. It is evident that all this wealth has been founded upon the capital resources of Persia Never theless if we compare the Persian Government’s revenues on account of oil with those of the company itself, it will be established how far Persia has been deceived m this transaction, and how unjustly the revenues of the Imperial State have been theTn ° te V a ? d , h0W t u e 011 com P an y has afc the present moment employed the riches extracted from, this country m other parts of the world and thus endangered the future prospects of Persian oil. ’ Although the company derives enormous advantages out of the Persian oil Se Z on 6 fwTthf 0 ' 6 d r y ghtly - e 5 pect t0 8 et at a reasonable and cheap j ‘ y nee , d . for thelr industrial and transport purposes the Z 'i d the oll 'P ro ducts are being sold by the company in this country even in the places from which they are actually extracted, at a price higher 'than that difficulties* ° ther COuntrles ’ and for ' this re ason Persia’s industrifl needs are in Pershn'ZTreZ* t0 L i te M° thei ' example of the indifference of the company to sim7’tfLinterests, we should say that, although according to the D’Arcv Conces- eZnHnn Tfi any had the nght t0 extract oil from all parts of Persia with the cannot 1 be d^hteH^TZ’ a ' ld a J thou g h the existence of oil all over the country necessitated’thaMt 8 ^ m TT fa .

Under the above circumstances, as I intimated in my former the Persian Government consider themselves justified in cancelling the D'\ r Concession, and they do not see any reason for the withdrawal of the cancellation I am also to point out that the Persian Government have always respected their international obligations and have always endeavoured to formulate their actions on the basis of righteousness and justice. But in the meantime the Persian Government cannot in any way allow their unquestionable rights to be disregarded or permit the interests of the country to be exposed to waste. As the Persian Government hope there exist in the present age listening ears in the world for reasonable and just pleas, they have therefore never refused, and in fact have always been ready, to set forth their difficulties and to expose to competent inter national courts violations of the rights of the country. In the present instance as your Excellency, in the name of your Government and basing yourself on article 3 tj 'of the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice, alludes to a reference to that court, I deem it my duty to draw your Excellency’s attention to the fact that, if the stipulations of the article referred to had placed the •examination of such questions within the competence of that court, the Persian Government, of course, would not have hesitated at all to accept a reference to that court, but it appears that the Permanent Court of Justice is not competent for the examination of the differences which have arisen between the Persian Government and the company, because article 30 of the said statute designates the competence of that court in such a way, in all cases where reference to the Permanent Court is made on the basis of the “ optional clause,” that the circum stances of the present case do not correspond with them. 3. Your Excellency repeats in paragraph 3 of your note that you consider the Persian Government as responsible for the losses which the company mav suffer. The Persian Government cannot understand how, while, on the one hand, they have no participation whatever in the activities of the company and. on the other, they have not interfered, and do not interfere, with the affairs of the company, nor cause it any inconvenience, any responsibility can devolve on them; and it is on the above grounds that I have the honour to reiterate that the company itself is responsible for any losses which it may suffer. 4. Coming to the hints which always appear in your Excellency's notes to the necessity for coming to friendly terms with the company, I venture to invite your attention to the point that the Persian Government have never refused, and, in fact, do not now refuse, to conclude a new agreement safeguarding equitably the interests of both parties, and they have proved their good faith in this connexion already in practice; and the reason why the Persian Govern ment did not take measures, after the cancellation of the D'Arcy Concession, in order to interfere with the company's institutions and still hold for the time being to the same decision in the hope of attaining the desired result, is that my Government have hoped that the company, instead of entering into the sphere of disputes over principles and of judicial controversies, would not lose the opportunity to send its duly authorised representative to Tehran in order that he might enter forthwith into negotiations with the Persian Government with the view of concluding an agreement which would safeguard the legitimate interests of Persia. But in practice it appears unfortunately that His Majestys Government are perhaps not in favour of such an agreement between the Persian Government and the company, because the threats and the intimidation that Hh Majesty s Government are bringing to bear on my Government, and the unaccepj a ole demands that are put forward, prevent in practice both the Persian Govern ment and the company from taking a single step towards reaching a mutua agreement; and, although the British Legation has so far not interfered in tlw discussions between the Persian Government and the company, it has now become an obstacle between the two parties and has adopted an attitude which does awav at once with any hope of success in the conclusion of a new agreement vi the company, and the authorities (of the Persian Government) cannot but iegre that, although His Majesty s Government are certainly aware of the deception^ practised on the Persian Government and of their losses, far from advising ^ encouraging the company to take advantage of the good faith of the Persia 0 Government and to hasten to ameliorate their situation are, on the contrary encouraging the company to resist by the pressure that they bring to bear on tne Persian Government.nner note, the ? the D'Arcv cancellation. va .ys respected annulate their ne the Persian ) )e disregarded. • LS the Persian the world for 1 in fact have mpetent inter- nt instance, as on article % , alludes to a icy’s attention ad placed the t, the Persian a reference to not competent n the Persian ute designates ference to the at the circum- t you consider company may The Persian Government consider this attitude of His Majesty's Government as incompatible with the spirit of uprightness and the desire for peace that should prevail among friendly Powers and members of the League of Nations, and consider themselves within their rights m bringing to the notice of the ^Council of the League of Nations the threats and pressure which have been directed against them. -to 1 avail, &amp;c.

CONFIDENTIAL December 30, 1932. Section 2. fE 6907/3880/34] No. 1 . Mr. Hoare to Sir John Simon.—(Received December 30.) (No. 545. Very Confidential.) Sir, Tehran, December 19, 1932. IT is gradually becoming possible to hazard a fairly definite opinion on the subject of the circumstances leading up to the letter from the Minister of Finance of the 27th November to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company cancelling the D’Arcy Concession, and to state that it is almost certain that the Shah had not consulted any of his Ministers before imposing his decision on his Government. 2. My first impression, which was almost entirely based on speculation, was that the well-known rivalry between the Minister of Court and the Minister of Finance had been a considerable factor. I imagined that the Shah had taken Taqi Zadeh to task for the long delay in bringing the company to book, and had obtained from him under severe pressure an admission that he had not yet got his proposals into final form and was in some doubt as to how to proceed. This admission had provoked an angry outburst from the Shah, who threatened to take the matter out of the hands of the Minister of Finance and once again to entrust it to Teymourtache, who had at least obtained from the company last winter a promise of £1 million in settlement of various outstanding issues. Thereupon, Taqi Zadeh, perturbed lest the fulfilment of this threat should mean that his long-drawn struggle with Teymourtache result in final defeat, either proposed or acquiesced in the cancellation of the company’s concession. 3. I made a record of this hypothesis on the 3rd December, but it was altogether too hypothetical to record officially. 4. The following information now given to the commercial secretary by Dr. f riedlieb (see paragraph 10 of my despatch No. 505) who has been in frequent contact with Teymourtache and other members of the Government in connexion with his business proposals, is, I think, as near as we shall get to the truth. I cannot say how much of his story is based on actual statements made to him. but m this country statements are no guarantee of truth and the conjecture of a shrewd foreigner is as reliable as anything else. . ^ On the 26th November Taqi Zadeh arrived at the Council of Ministers with draft proposals for communication to the company in his pocket, mmediately after he arrived, the Shah entered accompanied by Teymourtache. !s Majesty promptly started abusing Taqi Zadeh for his inability to bring the c A ° f 7 an y to ^eir senses and gradually worked himself up into a passionate rage. T • hesitation, and in the absence of any sign of life from Teymourtache, aqi Zadeh stammered out that the company alone were to blame for the failure he negotiations, whereupon the Shah exclaimed that the only thing to do was cancel the concession, and there and then proceeded to dictate to Taqi Zadeh room 0U ^ lne ^he letter to be communicated to Mr. Jacks. He then left the of wh ? x P lanati ? ns ensued between Taqi Zadeh and Teymourtache, the former he wn 0m ima £j ne d that, as Teymourtache came into the room with the Shah, order t a ^ are the Shah’s intentions and that Teymourtache had consented in said a w !a Cledit whereas Teymourtache, to whom the Shah had not in fact leg Tl! Id re &amp; arc ^ n g his intentions, had thought that the boot was on the other na^J 1 ^ 011 ^ a qi Zadeh and Teymourtache proceeded to draft a further Qovernm lnc lusion in the letter, expressing the readiness of the Persian submit, f ^ f e ^h ar k; on negotiations for a new concession. This passage was threatened ^ ^ ^ Teymourtache, who, when the Shah refused to accept it. o ies!gn and eventuallv induced His Majesty to give way. 1 artial corrohomfirm kn from Mndtp r5? ri 0 ^ ora ^ion 0: f a h this is furnished by the fact that we know (of whiob d)aa * vaan Fateh’s conversation on the 2nd December with Taqi Zadeh DompanvUhkt^T. 1 ^- 7 111 , been su PP lie(i to y° u b y the Anglo'' rk/L 1 Aac P ^ a( I e h did not approve of the cancellation of th Persian Oil the concession.2 We have also known for some time past how seriously the Shah was u * the drop in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s royalty.

Majesty, realising that the proceeds of the sugar and tea monopoly would Kp m-f inadequate, returned to Tehran determined to bring the issue with thp a i Persian Oil Company to a head. An glo- n v • u ^ adsw ° rth ; of u the American Legation, told me to-day that Dr. Friedlieb claimed to have been asked by Teymourtache in the course nf last day or two what he thought the intentions of the Persian Governmpnt i, a ^ en ' , ?A- Fr in d - lle u b , ' e P lied tha , t he had rejected the theory of collusion (see* despatch No. 505) between the Government and the company, and had conclnHM that the Government’s intention was to give the company an unmistakably cW intimation of the Government’s determination to get down to serious negotiation. According to Dr Friedlieb, Teymourtache accepted this as a generaflv co2 interpietation. while adding that he would have phrased it differently ” 9 I imagine that something of this sort will, in due course, emerge as the j ! C1 ll Persian explanation of a misunderstanding which the Persians will k delighted to believe could not have arisen had the company treated the matter a, a normal business issue and had His Majesty’s Government, by their intervention not rendered a settlement difficult. But even though some such result “ s inevitable, we may hope that for a short time the intervention of His Maiestv’s Government will be remembered. ‘ J ■ 10 .

But they have consistently held that no such negotiations coula take place with any hope of a satisfactory result save on the basis that the cancellation of the concession was not recognised and that failing withdrawal the matter must remain before the League.* 3* The Formula which has now been provisionally agreed seems on the whole adequately to meet both parties. The Persians make their point to the extent that there is so far no formal withdrawal by them of one cancellation of the concession.

Most of the articles are very long, and they are full of repetitions. The similarity of the arguments used leaves little room for doubt that the writers wrote under the direct inspiration and order of the Persian Government. The articles may therefore be regarded as supplementing, to some extent, the official Persian notes on the subject, and 1 have the honour to report hereunder a summary of the most important editorials of the Iran, the Shafaq-i- SwrM and the 2. On the 21st and 22nd December all Tehran newspapers published lengthy comments on the speech by which Sir William Malkin brought the British case before the Council of the ^League of Nations. The sum of 11 millions received by Persia is contrasted with the enormous benefits received by His Majesty’s Government, in income tax and other ways, and by British companies. The statement that any arrangement early this year was ever agreed to by the Persian Government is described as an absolute lie. The arguments concerning the invalidity of the D’Arcy Concession from the outset are repeated. No constitu tional Government existed in 1901, and no confirmation by the Majlis had ever taken place. The dishonest methods of accounting of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and of its subsidiaries are set forth, together with Mr. Armitage- Smith’s exposure of them. It is denied that His Majesty’s Government were the first to appeal to the League. Persia really invoked the League s aid first. It was a great pity that the Persian Government, through no fault of their own, were not able to make the first speech and be the plaintiffs against the unwarranted intrusion of the British Government. A long argument is developed concerning the British Government’s insistence on the Persian Government’s acceptance of responsibility for losses suffered by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, the suggestion being that this clearly means that Britain seeks an excuse for invading the oil-fields and taking possession of them, after causing the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to trump up an allegation of damage suffered. The Shafaq-i-Surkh concludes one of its articles bv the statement that the conscience of the great Persian people is clear in this matter. All Persians, with one accord, have acclaimed the cancellation with joy and unanimity; hence, even if the case is lost at Geneva, the Persian position before the world is clear and ' history will vindicate us.” The same paper, in another article, asks what right the British have’to interfere in Persian internal affairs, when it is well known that they condemn the unfortunate Egyptian people, 15 millions in number, to a capitulatory regime, not to mention the repression of the national aspirations of the 300 millions in India. ‘3. A large number of extracts from European papers are also published by the Tehran papers. The Ittilddt publishes, with evident approval, an extract trom an article in the New Statesman and Nation of the 3rd December saying that His Majesty’s Government are foolish to threaten force, and would be well advised to make a fresh agreement. Prominence is also given to an article in Mail (first circulated in the Soviet wireless), arguing that the British ?rl Culties at present are due to the fact that they failed to support the Sheikh of Mohammerah sufficiently. u .p^’ mos i interesting, as well as the most detailed, series of articles is to 99 a 0 r\ n( ^ var i° us issues of the Shafaq-i-Surkh between the 9th and the n December. In all nine articles appeared, from the “ pen of a well-informed wri er. From the nature of the evidence used it is certain that the writer had [691 r—41had access to a great number oi documents which could only be found either in the archives of the Persian Government or with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company The negotiations of Mr. Armitage-Smith are alluded to m detail, and the course of the conversations with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company during the last six years were evidently well known to the author, and it seems very probable, if not certain, that they were from the pen oi leymourtache himself. A summary of^ the articles is as follows : First article.— The Persian Government are entitled in law and i n equity to cancel the D’Arcy Concession and the 1920 agreement, to proceed against the Anglo-Persian Oil Company for damages, and to refuse to grant a°new concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Let us begin with the 1920 agreement. Mr. Armitage-Smith was an official^ of the British every ton of oil refined outside Persia ? Certain fixed deductions were made in calculating the royalties payable by the distributing companies. The deduction of 6 shillings per ton meant a loss to the Government of £7,200,000 Second article. —The National Oil Refineries (Limited), which owns the Llandarcy refinerv, is a source of great income to the British Government But the royalties payable by this and other refining companies are subject to much greater deductions than in the case of the Abadan refinery. The rates of deduction allowed in calculating the sums payable by distributing companies are cjuoted m detail, and stiess is laid on the fact that the intes of deduction are fixed amounts per gallon ; hence, in times of low prices, the real burden of the deduction and the disadvantage to the Persian Government are greater than thev ought equitably to be. Third article.— The Anglo-Persian Oil Company is a centre for intrigues against the Persian Government. It has indulged in bribery, and has fostered the secret spread of British imperialism. It concluded various agreements with local chiefs instead of with the Central Government, Mr. Churchill’s book, The World Crisis, is adduced as evidence in support of the statement that the British Government effected a saving of £7.500M through cheaper oil during the war. On the other hand, the manager oi the Anglo-Persian Oil Company at one time wrote a letter using threats against the officer commanding the Southern Persian army, stating that if he did not select the Governor of Abadan, in accordance with the desires of the company, the manager would insist on cash payment for oil supplied. Fourth article. —Mr. Armitage-Smith exceeded and transgressed the authority he possessed from the Persian Government. He PC!^ 86 •'J, n f that no fixed price per ton of oil was possible; why, therefore, did he, wi o authority, agree to deductions, fixed in money, from the selling price o products in calculating the royalty ? Hence, to sum up, the 1^20 agree ^ is invalid for the following reasons : {a) It has never been ratine Majlis; (h) it was based on fraud, ignorance, and the ex ® r TJ se A ° -^p. influence; {c) it was based on threats; (d) it involved deceit; (?) Mi. - i r Smith exceeded his authority. . * inni Ttisa Fifth article .—We now turn to the original concession of lUc . ^ general principle that force cannot create a right. A fonfwitv °Tk cancels all such agreements. Rousseau is quoted as an autn * • fact that the Persian Government did not proceed to cancel the c » at once makes no difference. Silence for a time may be due to ^ qjj other causes not the fault of the Government. If the Anglo- e ^ Company Concession is held to be valid, it would be possible to a g ^ the Anglo-Persian Agreement of 1919, the South ^ &gt;ers ^ a ! 1 Z'' 1 reasons capitulatory regime have not been legally abolished or ended. p ear 0 f for the Persian Government’s silence hitherto have been. i^ vernin eiit; pressure which would have been brought by His Majesty’s * DOWe rto and (b) the Persian Government did not hitherto possess sumcie defend its rights; but now that every male Persian of 21 y ear ® 0 ^cession the colours, things are different. If a Persian subject possesse a ppeall° in England, would the Persian Government lose their heads a ^ ^ g u t th the League without referring to competent quarters in Eng a • Anglo-Persian Oil Company have not had recourse to Persian3 th article.—The Persian Government has not consented to the a- Nation of the League in regard to the substance of the dispute. They t ip no intention of doing that. All they are doing is to complain to the r of the interference of His Majesty’s (Government in an internal ^tion Our courts are open to all who may wish to apply to them. A mher of other firmans have been cancelled, e.y., the firmans connected with th^rant of “ tuyul ” (feudal dues); fii’mans connected with the transfer of Yvwn lands- the firman concerning Abadan; the firman concerning the hnks of the karun River, held bv the Sheikh of Mohammerah. To sum up, the D’Arcy Concession is legally invalid, for the following reasons; (a) It was not ratified by the Majlis; (b) the grantor of the concession was ignorant of what he was granting; (c) the reason for the obligation has disappeared; and {d) deceit and fraud have been practised, and its conditions have not been complied with. r ^ ok + Seventh article.—The Iraq Petroleum Company pays 25 per cent. as a royalty, and guarantees £400,000 per annum. The terms of the D'Arcy Concession make it clear that what was really in the mind of the grantor was the surface oil at Shushtar, Qasr-i-Shirin and Daliki; no mention is made of Masjid-i-Suleiman and Haft Khel . Eiqhth article—The question of the consideration lor the agree ment is discussed. The 16 per cent, has not really been paid. The concession states (articles 9 and 10) that 16 per cent, had to be paid on all subsidiaries, and (article 12) that Persians are to be employed in all companies and institutions. The intention, therefore, was that all subsidiary companies should be formed in Persia and not abroad. The concessionnaire argues otherwise. This in itself shows that at the very beginning there was no agreement, and therefore no contract. Ninth article—The company have deprived the Persian Government of the possibility of controlling the accounts. t hey have also bought flour, Tice and bread from India instead of buying such stores locally; and in various other wavs acted contrary to Persia’s interests. 5. The series of articles then stops. Teymourtache was relieved of his duties on the 22nd December. It is not obvious why, with a prospect of the issue becoming the subject of a judicial decision, he should have been at pains to produce in such detail a statement which would make little appeal to the judicial mind.

By a contract signed at Teheran on May 28th, 1901, the Government of His Imperial Majesty the Shah of Persia granted to William Knox D’Arcy, a British subject, a concession carrying the 'special and exclusive privilege to search for, obtain, exploit, develop, render ^itable for trade, carry away and sell natural gas, petroleum, asphalt and ozokerite throughout the whole extent of the Persian Empire for a term of sixty years ”. 2.

In such circumstances, the negotiations, which had lasted several years, became increasingly difficult. On August 12th, 1928, the Minister of the Court wrote to the Chairman of the Company Sir John Cadman : “ I regret to learn that the negotiations have not as yet led to the desired results. Must I again refer to the community of Anglo-Persian interests in this enterprise ^ Must ^ I again allude to the obsolescence of the D’Arcy Concession, which was obtained at a time when the Government of the Kadjars did not realise what was being taken from it and what it was giving ? Consult any lawyer you like and you will be told that the concession needs to be remade, recast . . 13. Conironted by this prospect, Sir John Cadman said he was prepared to negotiate with a view to the revision of the D’Arcy Concession. In March 1929, he went to Teheran to discuss the draft of a new concession. 14. Glimpses of an understanding began to appear. Only a few points remained to be settled. Sir John returned to London to confer with his colleagues upon them. The negotiations continued. 15. Conversation succeeded conversation until 1931. There was still some hope of success. 16. On August 7th, 1931, to the Government’s great surprise and disappointment Sir John Cadman categorically stated, in a letter to the Minister of the Court that the revision nf the concession could no longer be contemplated. 17. The Persian Government, still convinced of the necessity of revision, had to content itself with determining the basis for the calculation of the dues. 18. Towards the end of 1931, discussions took place, first in Switzerland and then in London, between the Minister of the Court and Sir John Cadman, and a preliminary draft concerning the calculation of the dues was drawn up. 1 y 19. On January 8th, 1932, the Minister of the Court and Sir John Cadman again met at Pans to settle the dues of which the Government was deprived by the Armitage-Smith Agreement. The representative of the company offered an inadequate sum, and the interview was fruitless. 2°. The preliminary draft regarding the calculation of the dues had to be drawn up with all possible technical accuracy. It was submitted to lawyers and accountants, and, when completed, was sent to Teheran to receive parliamentary sanction in accordance with the constitution, followed by the Persian Government’s ratification. 2 i' ^hen it received this document, the Cabinet studied it at great length. It found that on more than one point the document was complicated and obscure, and might thus lead to amerences of interpretation. Tehera^fo^tha^pur 1 se C ° mpany to furnish explanations, and to send a representative to 22. The Company refused. 23. The Persian Government’s last hope was thus extinguished. thp ntmos ^ patience it had continually endeavoured for years past to secure Sir TnVm °i e^OHees 5101 !.

The Anglo-Persian Oil Company, which derives its power from the Persian deposits, is continually extending its activities outside Persia, but in Persia it confine; itself to a restricted exploitation—a line of action that is particularly inacceptable because the conceding party receives, not a fixed sum, but a sum varying according to the extent of the exploitation. Such an understanding and such an application of the contract are certainly inconsistent with its spirit. There are, however, other points on which the concessionaire disregards even the explicit terms of the concession. (b) The concessionaire explicity undertakes to carry out in Persian territory all the operations necessary for making the oil available for trade. This may be seen from the terms of Article 1, which uses not merely the words search for, obtain, exploit, but also “develop, render suitable for trade ” (referring to petroleum and other products mentioned in the article), throughout the whole extent of the Persian Empire. Notwithstanding this text, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company performs the greater part of the preparatory processes on Persian petroleum outside Persia. (c) According to Article 12, the workmen employed in the service of the company must be subject to His Imperial Majesty the Shah, except the technical staff, which is limitatively defined as “such as the Managers, Engineers, Borers and Foremen”. The concessionaire infringes this undertaking indirectly by constructing refineries and other works outside Persia, and directly by employing Indian workmen in Persia itself, despite the Government’s repeated protests. (d) Article 10 plays a vital part in the structure of the concession contract. It is the only article that settles, from the pecuniary standpoint, the division of the profits between the two contracting parties associated in the undertaking : “A sum equal to 16 per cent of the annual net profits of any company or companies that may be formed ” is to be paid annually to the Government. The execution of this article has always been seriously incomplete. The concessionaire not only flatly refuses to pay the 16 per cent on the profits of certain of its subsidiaries, bui even in respect of those that it agrees to subject to the dues it calculates them on bases which the British expert McLintock has shown to be incorrect ; even the accounts produced are such a nature that Mr. Armitage-Smith, notwithstanding all his friendliness towards! company, does not hesitate to write : “In my opinion these accounts are somewhat ambiguous ” (letter to the Persian Prime Minister). , , These quotations are given merely to indicate the state of affairs. The full gravity 01 the breaches of obligations in connection with the dues can only be established by a thorougn examination by an accountant. .. (e) In addition to all these fundamental breaches of obligations, the underlain? regarding the procedure provided for in Article 17 of the concession has not been observe. It reads : In the event of there arising between the parties to the present concession any dispute or difference in respect of its interpretation or the rights or responsibilities 0 ^ or the other of the parties resulting therefrom, such dispute or difference shall besu mi to two Arbitrators at Teheran, one of whom shall be named by each of the parties^ ^ an Umpire who shall be appointed by the Arbitrators before they P roceedtoa /o ltra r nl pi r e decision of the Arbitrators or in the event of the latter disagreeing that of tne v shall be final.” , On several occasions the Persian Government has been in disagreement with the comp J and has asked it to refer the dispute to arbitration ; but the Company has always (see Appendices II and V). the * &gt;jt 28. According to the most undisputed principles, the failure of one party 1 ^1$ his obligations entitles the other not to discharge his own ; this rule of justice e g ec j known to all legislations, though they may differ as to the manner of putting p 1 agsUIIie d Roman law allows the party suffering by the non-fulfilment of the obligatio ^ ^ towards him to notify the other party that he reciprocally regards himself as re his own obligations. French law requires the party to apply to the courts in order his rights ' . 1 w the fol^ As between these two types of legislation, Persian law shares with Roman la c ojnplel e rule : the party may himself, of his own motion, cancel the contract in case Ujjrg te 0 w b ^ ition. ,r y. it is only i from demand excessive ai n the conces'^ lonopoly. ntory larger tha, ouse of CoramoB i thirty years (out n one square mile, ts power from the i Persia it confines cceptable because othe extent of the tainly inconsistent ; even the explicit a territory all the ien from the terms mt also “ develop, mentioned in the ding this text, the 'ocesses on Persian the company must hich is limitatively Fhe concessionaire Tks outside Persia, irnment’s repeated ract.

If it regaraea uic ^ open to the compa ny : either to negotiate with the Persian Two hnes o d that it was prepared to conclude a new contract with the Xa'” - equita^ bases, or to apply to the Persian courts. ♦ * ^ Such being the situation, it can only have been through a misunderstanding that the British Government felt called upon to intervene. ,0 To interpose between the parties amounted in effect to a claim to remove from the jurisdiction of the municipal courts a dispute which naturally belonged to them, and : n J ;rif r infyp Persia’s jurisdictional independence. The Persian Government had therefore legitimate reason to be surprised at the terms in which the British Government informed it of its request to withdraw the cancellation notified to one of its nationals. it The Persian Government might have appealed to the League of Nations to enforce resoect for its jurisdictional independence. Indeed, it intended to do so, as it informed the British Government in its letter of December 12th, 1932 (Appendix VI). 12 As a result of this letter, the British Government thought fit to take the initiative by summoning the Persian Government before the Council in virtue of Article 15 of the Covenant. 33. Such a summons is contrary to the terms of that article. 34. Article 15 requires a “ dispute likely to lead to a rupture . only exist when a Government has, by means of diplomatic protection, one of its nationals. But the dispute can taken up the cause of But diplomatic protection presupposes : (1) A violation of general or conventional international law , (2) The previous exhaustion of municipal remedies. A procedure of cancellation based on the non-fulfilment of a contract is incontestably not a violation of international law. . . , , Even if the cancellation was unfounded, diplomatic protection could 0 ^y c 01 ^ 6 i n 0 P Y after the municipal courts had been given an opportunity of dealing with the ma er. On this point international law is quite definite. 35 - This is a principle of which the British Government quite recently reminded the Finnish Government before the Council (Official Journal of the League of Nations, ovem I 93 i. page 2217) : “ There is a perfectly well-established rule of international law and pia.ctice to the effect that a State is not entitled to make any diplomatic claim on behalf of 1 s na 101 } against another State in respect of any matter where, if the claim is valid, e mumcip law affords a remedy, unless such municipal remedies have been exhausted. e priva persons concerned have failed to exhaust their municipal remedies, there is no oun a 1 for any diplomatic claim/’ Lord Cecil, representing the British Government before the Council, said (Official Journal 0 the League of Nations, November 1931, page 2080) : “ I was surprised to read in the Finnish memorandum that the Finnish Government throws doubt on what is a perfectly well-established principle of international law namely, that, in a private claim of this kind, no diplomatic intervention can e use un es the parties have already exhausted all the remedies of the courts in the country against which they are making their claim And later : Both on principle and in virtue of the words of the Covenant and of previous ecisions of the Council, it was undesirable for the Council to embark on a discussion o a question which was really a matter of private law and not of public Internationa aw. Be submitted that, if the Council took a different view, very serious inconveniences would arica ”We read in the British memorandum of September 14th, 1931 [Official 7 League of Nations, November 1931, page 2231) : J°^nal of the “ It is clear that this is a claim which must come within the scope established rule of international law that the individuals concerned must ha ° ^ Wel1 ' all their remedies under the municipal law of the country concerned a s' 6 eXhauste(i precedent to the right of the Government whose nationals the claimants are\ C ° n(litio11 the claim and make it its own, and present it through the diplomatic channel case, unless and until this condition precedent has been fulfilled, the claimant - p SUcl&gt; ment has no right to take up the case diplomatically at all, and, if the condition 5 n' 1 ' must base its case on the failure of the country concerned to fulfil its internatio 1 1?^’ tions to provide a system of law and of courts of justice through which private n j 0b ^ a ‘ may obtain redress in conformity with the requirements of international law ln T d T 1Vlduals municipal remedies have been exhausted, it is obviously impossible in such Utlltlle contend that a State has failed to fulfil its international obligations in this resn &amp; t0 this condition has been fulfilled, such a claim cannot assume an internationalch ^ A little later, in the British Government’s memorandum to the Council, in reul Finnish Government's memorandum of December 1931 [Official Journal of the ll ° te Nations, March 1932, page 813), we read : “ In paragraph 4 of the Finnish memorandum of December 1931, it appears h argued that, as between Members of the League, the provisions of the Covenant in ° ^ way involve the abrogation or supersession of this well-known international rule 7 Majesty’s Government cannot help observing that this contention is somewhat startl ' and that few Members of the League can have contemplated when they accepted th Covenant that the result was that the machinery of the League could be used to take th place of the municipal courts as a means by which the claims of foreigners in respect of matters within the jurisdiction of those courts should be adjudicated “ Finally, if a dispute were properly referred to the Council under Article 15, which arose out of a matter in respect of which a municipal remedy had not been exhausted there is nothing whatever in Article 15 to suggest that the Council should ignore this fact in dealing with the matter. Indeed, the fact that municipal remedies have not been exhausted might itself form a valid ground on which the Council might find that the case was one which came within the provisions of paragraph 8 of Article 15, and decline to make any further recommendation on this ground.” * 5k 5|I 36. Like His Britannic Majesty’s Government, the Imperial Persian Government keenly desires that the present incident should not disturb the friendly relations which have hitherto existed between His Britannic Majesty’s Government and itself. 37 - H is the more assured that this will not be the case, inasmuch as, in this instance, it confines itself to endorsing the British Government’s own declarations to the Council quoted above. 38. For the reasons stated in the foregoing paragraphs, the Imperial Persian Government considers it to be clear that, in the case in question, the British national concerned has not only not exhausted, but has not even begun to utilise the legal remedies open to him under Persian municipal law, and that, accordingly, the condition precedent to diplomatic intervention, m conformity with the recognised rules of international law, not having been fulfilled, the British Government has not, and has never had, the right to make a diplomatic claim in respect of the present case, a fact which, in virtue of paragraph 1—and, in any case, of paragraphS- o Article 15, precludes, under the terms of Article 15 itself, any application of that article.— 7 tal J oun ‘‘lol« lt “haveet** Ms are to take,, channel.

No. 12187 I 539 , 14 Zilhajeh, 1335 (September 1917). I have had the honour to receive your answer of 22 Rejab, 1335. regarding the dispute that has arisen between the Persian Government and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. In reply, I beg to draw your attention to the fact that Article 17 of the D’Arcy Concession clearly provides for a reference to arbitration as proposed by the Persian Government, iha article stipulates that disputes and differences of every kind in respect of the interpreta. ion of the concession or the rights or responsibilities of one or the other of the parties shai c submitted to arbitration. . . . I therefore give my full support to the protests made by the Imperial Commissioner against the withholding by the company of the Persian Government’s dues (£19,600 for the year 1915 and £24,747 f° r the year 1916). I regard the action of the company, which, in violation °f ^ ® principles of ordinary law has taken upon itself to be judge in a case in which it is itselt mterestec (no man can be judge in his own cause), as wholly illegal and arbitrary. , s P ec ifi c object of the provision for arbitration in the deed of concession was to ensure at the principles of law to which I have just referred should be respected, and that this means s Quid be employed to put an end to disputes. , Although it was essential that these principles should be respected, the company as violated them : (1) By withholding the said sums of its own motion, without waiting for the arbitral award ; ( 2 ) By declining arbitration after acting illegally towards the Imperial Government, and thereby closing the door to the only means of settling the dispute. &gt; _ . e Government, having undertaken to ensure the safety and protection of the comp y eisian territory, is prepared to pay any sum that may be found due by it m consequeri e aibitral award. The company’s proceedings, however, and its withholding o ck croyalties, are intolerable. It is essential that the dispute as a whole be submitted t and that, as a preliminary, the company pay over to the Government the dues it b ° • trat ion withheld. as lrn P r operly I trust that, in consideration of right and justice, and of the cordial and friendl that exist between the two countries, Your Excellency will lend your good offi^ 1 ^ 0115 Persian Government with a view to reaching an equitable settlement of tv.; ^ es to arbitration. 615 dls P“'e by I also hope that, in order to protect the economic interests of both parti ^ prevent the company from persisting in an attitude which is making an unfavourabl 68 ^° U Wul upon public opinion. eim P r ession The Imperial Government, I repeat, will respect the arbitral award, whatever t and will put it into effect. Should the award assign damages to the company howe ma ^ e ’ the Persian Government has done all in its power to protect the company’s inter ^ er ’ since not responsible for the manoeuvres and operations arising out of the great war it will just and fair that the sum adjudged and paid by the Government should be refund at the time of the general liquidation of war damages, bv those who bear the rpal e J 0 , 11, for the losses sustained.

To His Excellency Farid-es-Saltaneh, Commissaire Imperial Chambellan to His Imperial Majesty the Shah, Attached to the Imperial Legation of Persia. Your Excellency, We have the honour to inform you that we have now perused and considered the various documents you have laid before us, and beg to submit the following observations for your consideration. Apart from the Agreement of December 22nd, 1920, between the Imperial Persian Government and the Anglo-Persian Oil Companv, Limited, requiring ratification to make it binding on the Government, we are rather inclined to the view (although it is not easy to advise with confidence) that, in entering into the Agreement, Mr. Armitage-Smith may have exceeded the powers conferred upon him by the letter of August 29th, 1920. These power 5 were limited to the final adjustment of all questions in dispute between the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Imperial Government of Persia, and if such powers are to be construe e strictly, they certainly do not appear to authorise his entering into and signing an agreemen, on behalf of the Imperial Government of Persia, effecting extensive variations in the terms 0 the original concession to the detriment of the Imperial Government. ., r It is to be observed that a perusal of the statement drawn up by Mr. Armitage-Smi the opinion of counsel shows that nowhere does he ask counsel to direct their mind to m question whether he had authority to enter into the alleged Agreement under the po' conferred upon him, and no copy of the letter of authority or of the private instruc io n August 29th, 1920, appears to have been laid before them. , ,• nt0 ihe joint opinions of two separate sets of counsel have already been taken in retat 10 * tie matter including the construction of the concession—namely, that of Mr. D- y ^ K.C., and Mr. Rayner Goddard, dated March 22nd, 1920, and that of Mr. Mark L. koi W.

Article i of the alleged Agreement of December 22nd, ^20 however, makes the 16 per cent royalty on profits subject to certain conditions, limitations I9 d exception’s, which are set out in detail in the subsequent articles of the Agreement. Moreover according to the alleged Agreement, the royalty is confined to profits arising from Peniafi oil only. If, therefore, the view taken by Messrs. Kerly and Goddard in their opinion be correct—namely, that such part of the profits of a subsidiary company as reach the parent company and are reflected in its own profits will form part of the profits of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company for royalty purposes—then this cutting down of the 16 per cent royalty is certainly disadvantageous to the Imperial Government. It is true that Messrs. Kerly and Goddard express this view in regard to only one type of subsidiary company, but the typ&gt;e contemplated bv them is an extreme one, and the view would accordingly apply a fortiori to the other subsidiary companies of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. It seems reasonable to suppose that, in agreeing to the deductions mentioned in the alleged Agreement from the 16 per cent royalty, Mr. Armitage-Smith was actuated by the fear that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company would, and could, carry out its threat to divest itself of all interest in the subsidiary companies, but, as indicated above, the conclusion that this might be possible in practice appears to have been based upon false premises. Again, by Article 17 of the Concession, any dispute or difference between the parties is to be submitted to two arbitrators at Teheran, one of whom is to be named by each party, and to an umpire who is to be appointed by the arbitrators ; the decision of the arbitrators (or, in the event of their disagreeing, that of the umpire) being final. By Article 2 of the alleged Agreement, failing agreement with regard to the matters referred to, the question is to be submitted to a single arbitrator, whose decision shall be final, such arbitrator in default of agreement being nominated by the President for the time being of the Chamber of Shipping in London. Furthermore, by Article 9 of the alleged Agreement, in the event of any dispute arising in connection with the calculation of royalty, etc., the question or questions in dispute are to be submitted to a chartered accountant to be nominated by the President for the time being of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England, the decision of such arbitrator being final. This change in the constitution of the tribunal and the venue of the proceedings might conceivably militate very seriously against the interests of the Government, and, in this connection, reference may be made to the statement of Messrs. Kerly and Goddard, that one consideration of far-reaching importance must necessarily be : Who is to be the arbitrator whose opinion will ultimately decide between the parties ? With regard to Articles 3, 4 and 5 of the alleged Agreement, attention is called to the paragraph numbered 5 of the opinion of Messrs. Kerly and Goddard, in which they state that, if the subsidiary companies are formed for the purpose of working the concession or any part thereof (that is, substantially to search for and obtain or to prepare for sale or to sell oil within the Empire of Persia or to carry oil away from the Empire), the royalty payable ought to include an amount equal to 16 per cent of their profits and that no deduction should be made in respect of the 16 per cent of the profits of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company itself also included in the calculation of the royalty, on the ground that the first-mentioned amount has been brought into calculation. Our reading of this is that the Imperial Government are entitled to a royalty of 16 per cent of the net profits of all subsidiary companies formed to work the concession, and also to a royalty of 16 per cent of the net profits of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, notwithstanding hat the latter may hold shares in such subsidiary companies. Assuming this view to be correct, en in so far as Articles 3, 4 and 5 apply to such subsidiary companies, all deductions s ipulated for in those articles would certainly seem to be a curtailment of the Imperial overnment s rights ; and there are other matters included in the alleged Agreement which Conc^ a ^ ec ^ ^judicially the rights and interests of the Imperial Government under the , understand the matter, it is a question entirely for the Imperial Government matt ^ a ^°P^ alleged Agreement or not, but we venture to think that the various w , j FS we uave indicated above point to the conclusion that the adoption of the Agreement Concessk) 68 ^ 11 ^ m P eiaa ^ Government giving up important rights and interests under the be tak' howe Y er » ^ is intended to repudiate the Agreement, we are of opinion that steps should IfTk ° &lt;a0 50 as P rom Ptly and with as little delay as possible, it will 6re are an y further points upon which Your Excellency would like to have our views, give us much pleasure to place ourselves at Your Excellency’s disposal. w e have the honour to be.

The Anglo-Persian Oil Co., Ltd., Britannic House, Finsbury Circus, E.C.2. Dear Sirs, Persian Government Royalty Arbitration. With reference to outstanding questions, I beg to draw your attention to these facts. On December 22nd, 1926, I sent a private letter to Sir John Cadman asking his kind intervention in bringing about an early settlement of all points under dispute pertaining to the years ended March 1924 and 1925, 1926 being now included and, in the near future, 1927. Our interests being identical, I remarked then on the distastefulness to me of having recourse to arbitration, and expressed the wish that things might be settled amicably. In Sir John’s reply of December 23rd, he promised to do all in his power to bring about such a settlement, since which date one year and five months have elapsed and we have made no material advance. The company making no movement towards a settlement, in February 1927 I curtailed my holiday in the South of France, returning to London, and took the initial steps necessary towards having the matter submitted to arbitration. In your letter of September 29th of that year, you say : “ The difference in opinion . . . should appear to be incapable of adjustment. Arbitration, therefore, would seem to be the only course”. In your further letter of October 18th, you say, in the last paragraph : ” We appreciate that it is because you believe it to be a rightful claim that you are adopting the procedure agreed on ; it is because we do not believe it to be a rightful claim that we have adopted the same procedure as the only means for the resolution of the difference between us ”. However, after all this loss of valuable time, yon did not pursue this course, but, through Mr. Spens, your accountant, made some overtures to Sir William McLintock, hoping thereby to render the arbitration unnecessary. Though of all outstanding questions requiring adjustment the one most disputed contention concerns refining allowances, yet all are so essentially linked up that, finding your suggestions inadequate, I made counter-proposals through Sir William McLintock, who, through Mr. Spens, wrote to the Chairman on April nth last, which proposals were briefly turned down by Sir John Cadman in his reply of April 25th, no further counter-proposals bring offered. In the course of conversation with me the day before his departure for France on April 25th, Sir John said that acceptance of my demands would be tantamount to tearing up the Agreement, to which I replied that, unfortunately, that was a course adopted by the compan) when their interests were served to the detriment of the interests of the Persian Government, who, it seems to me, have also a say in the matter. Article 10 of the alleged agreement decrees that the company agrees that ” it will not enter into any fictitious or artificial transaction 'd ij-* would have the effect of reducing the amount of royalty payable ”. Also in paragraph 7 of ^ instructions given to Mr. Armitage-Smith which appear in the Blue Book of which you au a copy, in Appendix III, page 20, we read : ‘' Le point de vue du Gouvernement est done le maintien d adoptant les tnoyens necessaires pour empecher la Compagnie de d diminuer la part de I’Etat persan, soil en soustrayant certains en inscrivant au compte de VEtat certaines depenses indues, soi\ reduit.” A case in point of the flagrant breach of these obligations is the method adopted ^y y regarding refining allowance. You will admit that, if the company sold all its 01 a ^ a ton which costs more than 15s. to produce, not only would there be not a P en ^ me that to the company, and therefore no royalty to the Persian Government, but it seems 0 under such circumstances, the company would soon cease to exist. instruct^ I have frequently said, and now repeat, that Mr. Armitage-Smith was no ss i on , or authorised to draw up an agreement affecting changes in the terms of the D e in ission which act alone is binding on both the company and the Persian Government. y 0l ir entrusted to him in accordance with letter No. 18059 °f’ August 29th, 19 2 ’ u pourcentage actuel, 0 ‘ manier ses comptes de, profits ou poi^ cen ^ a f es ’ ^ t en vendant le fetrole a1 V ^ndon, W.8. 128 . these facts, asking his kind pertaining to the ear future, 1927. : having recourse y.

France on April 0 tearing up the by the company ian Government, jreement decrees transaction which ragraph 7 of the which you ha^e 11 vn publication of the D’Arcy concession, was merely to bring about a final adjustment of 0 ou tstanding questions between us up to date, and to evolve a practical scheme based on the Jiew expressed in the above-quoted French extract. In drawing up an agreement, he most prtainly exceeded his powers , his authority to do so was accepted by you unquestioned, being to vour advantage. The alleged agreement has never been officially recognised or ratified by the Persian Government; but, as I have said on various occasions, pending a more satisfactory bsis of operation for the future which I shall be pleased to discuss with you whenever you &lt; disposed, my Government has unofficially acquiesced in this arrangement as a modus “vivendi for the time being. Developments have proved that its theory is in practice unworkable. It has had the effect of completely destroying the Act of Concession in many directions to the disadvantage of my Government, which manifestly should not take place. According to Article 10 of the Act of Concession, any company or companies formed are to pay the Persian Government ibpercentof their annual net pro fits without any deduction or allowance; but the alleged agreement has, so to speak, done away with that vital and all-important article by excluding profits arising from the transport of oil by means of ships and by making deductions for refining, distributing and marketing, etc., all of which is contrary to the letter and spirit of the Act of Concession and to the purport of the instructions given to Mr. Armitage-Smith. It is obvious that the profits arising out of all subsidiary companies form part of the annual net profits of the parent company and are therefore chargeable for royalty purposes without exception. Article 17 of the Act of Concession provides for arbitration in Teheran, which clause is modified in Article 2 of the alleged agreement to a course of procedure wdiich might conceivably be to the disadvantage of the Persian Government. Therefore, I think I am fully justified in saying that an agreement which provides so many loopholes of advantage for the company and which even then is disregarded by them when their own interests are to be served, of which fact the immediate refining allowance question is an outstanding example, is no more binding on the company than on the Persian Government. In conclusion, circumstances being similar, I quote again from paragraph 6 of the instructions given to Mr. Armitage-Smith appearing in Appendix III, page 20 : “ En formulant sa reclamation le Gouvernement imperial n’a point demande un acte de faveur, il n a fait que revendiquer les droits legitimes qu’il pense avoir contre la Compagnie, du chef de certains arrieris et des dividendes indument retenus par cette derniere.' I wish to avoid further controversy on these questions and fervently hope this may be my last communication of such nature. Though the rights are, to my belief, entirely on the side of the Imperial Persian Government, I am still open to any acceptable offer the company may be prepared to make covering all the points enumerated in Sir William McLintock’s letter to Sir John Cadman. Failing such, I earnestly request you, without further loss of time, to instruct your legal advisers to get in touch with mine, so that we may reach a final and complete settlement, before summer holiday arrangements intervene and further Anglo-Persian Oil Company His Excellency Sa digh es Saltanah Royal Palace Hotel, Kensington, W.

I promised to do so, and I now accordingly write to repeat what I saidtoyuu verbally. , . You informed me that your instructions were that, it w r e do not admit a liability-.! think you said, if we do not pay the 16,000 tomans we must forthwith proceed to arbitration but I regret that I cannot in the present circumstances advise the Directors to do so. I submit that it is not a reasonable request to make to us, until your Government has replied to our legitimate requests for certain information on the subject. Your Government’s claim is based on clause 4 °f fhe concession of June 6 th, igoi. That clause speaking of the said three springs as on June 6th, 1901, says : “quisont actuellement affermes d des particnliers et produisent annuellement un revenu de deux milktonm au profit du Gouvernement ”. Obviously then, if at that date the three mines collectively w'ere not “ actuellement affenm d des particuliers et produisent annuellement un revenu de deux mille tomans au profit du Gouvew- ment ”, and never have done so, but only produced to the Persian Government some sum less than 2,000 tomans, your Government’s claim would be automatically reduced pro tanto. I am informed by His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire that, in regard to the supposed spring (or mines) at Balcki, neither the Persian Government nor any representative acting on their part ever did collect anything from “ particulars ”. Did they then even collect 2,000 tomans per annum at Kassre-Shirine and Schouster ? I am informed by His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz that, with regard to the spring (or mine) at Schouster, the spring is farmed out now, as before, at 1,000 tomans per annum, out of which Samsam Khan, who claims a proprietary interest in the spring, receives 550 tomans, the Mustafi (or Treasurer) of the Persian Government 450 tomans, per annum. This has been regularly paid to the latter who has acknowledged its receipt to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul. As regards Kassre-Shirine, as I told you verbally, detailed authentic information has not yet reached me from His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, but it has been promised, and I hope to get it by any mail, wdien I w r ill advise you of its purport. You have told me that, since May 1901, no money has been received by the Persian Government in respect of any of these “ trois mines ”. If that be so, then your Government must apply to the Mustafi at Schouster for the 450 tomans per annum which he has collected and not paid in— i.e., 3,600 tomans. But, in any case, it is incumbent, under the terms of the concession, on your Government to give me the names of the persons “ particuliers ’’who were paying money in this connection to your Government and details of how much each one had paid annually, prior to the signature of the concession. We asked specifically for this, among other information, in our letter to you dated September 8th last, and I have to ask you to procure and give me this simple information in substantiation of your Government’s claim before w r e can go further into the matter. I am your Excellency’s obedient servant, (Signed) C. W. Wallace, Vice-Chairman. Appendix VI.

This to His Britannic lv I wish to state that the Persian Government has several times indicated the In Tks dissatisfaction with the action of the company holding the Oil Concession, and causes ot ecessar y t o repeat them. I need hardly say that, should the Persian Government thought 1 conclu( j e a ne w and satisfactory agreement with the company, and should it think be unah e ^ order to uphold its right to denounce the D’Arcy Concession, to refer the case it ne ^Q S ^ t it would not hesitate a moment to submit its arguments in detail. The Persian Government has always displayed good faith in this question, and it was with ^ b st intentions that, in its previous note concerning the denunciation of the D’Arcy r* e ssion it refrained from going into details. It is regrettable that this repugnance of the T 0nC rial Government to embark upon discussions and arguments has been interpreted by the British Government as a proof that the Persian Government could not found its action on any legitimate basis. In order that His Britannic Majesty’s Government should not think that the Imperial Government refuses to give the reasons that have led it to cancel the contract, I shall briefly indicate a few of them below : Not only was the D’Arcy Concession incompatible in itself with the interests of Persia, whose legitimate rights have been disregarded, but the concession was granted at a time when the interests and welfare of the country were unfortunately not taken into consideration in drawing up contracts of this kind, and when those who wished to obtain them took great advantage of the ignorance of the authorities in charge. Furthermore, in order to obtain these concessions, all sorts of threats and pressure were used at the time, and, as a result of these threats and this pressure, the authorities that granted concessions were unable to refuse them. Your Excellency and His Britannic Majesty’s Government will no doubt admit that the world to-day attaches no value to contracts obtained in this way and does not consider them as binding on their signatories. In addition to the defects mentioned above, the company, in its relations with the Persian Government, did not even observe the stipulations of the concession, which was already so detrimental to Persia. The company has failed to respect the rights of the Government as laid down in this burdensome and obsolete concession. In doing so, it has infringed the rights of the Persian Government. formation has not sed, and I hope to id by the Persian your Government :h he has collected your Government ' in this connection or to the signature ter to you dated pie information in : matter. lLLACE, irman. ; Y HIS Highn-ess &gt; Mk. Hoare- As an example I may quote the following fact : Under the D’Arcy Concession, the company was to pay to the Persian Government 16 per cent of all its profits and of those of all its subsidiaries without exception. The logical result of this stipulation was to give the Persian Government the right to supervise the expenditure which was to be deducted from the company’s gross profits in order to arrive at the amount of the net profits, and also the right to express its opinion on the justification of this expenditure. Otherwise, Persia ran the risk of suffering continual reductions in the royalty which was due to her. Unfortunately, the company, which has been conspicuous by its prodigality and extra vagance, has never consented to the Persian Government’s having a right of supervision over the operating expenditure before the payment of its royalty. I do not wish to expatiate on the fact that the expenditure, for the most part unjustified, in which the company indulged, has a very great effect on the royalty accruing to the Persian Government and reduced it to a ridiculously small amount. More than this, the company has never hitherto submitted to the Persian Government or its representative any detailed accounts or other evidence of its expenditure, and of the expenditure of all its subsidiaries, which would enable the Persian Government to check the calculation of its royalties. It has also refused, contrary to the express conditions of the contract, to pay the Persian Government its share in the profits earned by its subsidiaries. It has further granted to some of its subsidiaries large subsidies taken from its profits, including these sums in its accounts as expenditure and thus appreciably diminishing the Persian overnment s share. Consequently, the company has manifestly violated the clauses of the concession and has thereby caused the Government considerable loss. I could mention many other circumstances in which the company has shown a lack of sincerity in its relations with the Persian Government. If Your Excellency will refer to the repor s submitted by various British experts, you will find that on numerous occasions the ompany has acted in such a way as to injure Persia’s interests. Another proof that the company has not respected the stipulations of the D Arcy concession is provided by the following facts : the H Althou , gh ’ dur ing the great war, the price of oil and of oil products constantly rose and the ^ rew g rea t e r and greater (Persian oil being considered as an important factor in enorm 16 * an d although the sale of Persian oil at world rates brought the company Persiaifr company, despite the explicit terms of the concession, failed to pay the the contract 61111116 ^ sums w hi c h were its due, thus, in practice, completely invalidating royalties ^ &gt;e ^ s ^ an Government, has on various occasions, endeavoured to recover these satisfactory r |^ ecure a settlement of the accounts of arrears, but without obtaining anyYour Excellency is also aware that, under the D’Arcy Contract, the r entitled to any exemption from taxation in Persia (with the exception of certain^ 1 ^ Was n °t and that it was subject to all the laws of the country. tustonis taxes) Although an income tax has been in force in Persia since iaoo fio^o^ ^ a 4-^ ^„„rr. 4-u x -x i ana although the Pay the company was bound to submit to the laws of the country, it has hitherto ref a tax in question and has thus shown its contempt for the laws of my country t0 I have no need to inform your Excellency of the development of the c % present expansion and of its wealth.

Hence, the needs of Persian industry are not satisfied. I can quote yet another example of the company’s indifference to Persian interests Although, under the D’Arcy Contract, the company is entitled to extract oil in alln t of Persia with the exception of five northern provinces, and although the existence if i deposits all over the country cannot be questioned, the company, far from centralist t' activities in Persia and increasing its exploitation (thus augmenting the share of the - accruing to the Persian Government), has, on the contrary, limited its exploitation in Per and continually extended its activities outside Persia. Despite the above-mentioned violations, the Persian Government has on varinm occasions, endeavoured to place its relations with the company on a stable and fair basis and to put an end to all controversies. Unfortunately, the Persian Government’s efforts have not to any practical result. Last summer the Persian Government even expressed the desire that the company should send its representative to Teheran in order to arrive at a final agreement, but the company, taking the general crisis as an excuse, refused tosendhim. In view of the company s conduct towards the Persian Government, and the fact that it has refused to pay Persia her due, and has displayed no willingness to proceed to a revision of the contract, how can His Britannic Majesty’s Government consider the Imperial Government ? ^ Un ^ stifiable and feel entitled to exert pressure on the Persian * nview ad ^ iese circumstances, the Persian Government found itself justified, as I f a P revious n pte, m denouncing the D’Arcy Concession. It therefore sees no reason tor withdrawing its notice of cancellation. racr. ^ ^ euM specially draw your attention to the fact that the Persian Government has always -P . f 1 1 , n erna l ;io pal obligations and has always made a point of basing its actionsonthe p map es o aw and justice. But it cannot tolerate its most indisputable rights being disregarded or permit the interests of the country to be sacrificed. rm • Be m USe t ! le P ® r f lan Government hopes that, in the world to-day there are ears to he* . . e a , nc .

IW'Y' SEEN COMIVUTfEB, Previous Papers - 44 75e 1000 5.30 FOR INFORMATION. From the press cuttings below it will oe seen that the Persian Minister has been instructed to return to Persia in the immediate future and that simultaneously I the First Secretary of the Legation has been j transferred to Berlin with the result that the second Secretary will be left in charge. I understand from trie Foreign Office that no communication of any sort has been made to them in regara to xinsari’s withdrawal or the arrangements for taking charge of the negation. The Persian minister aid indeed ask last week whether he could see the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs and was informed in reply that Sir John Simon was away ana likely to remain away for some little time. But there was nothing in his . communication/ lconimunicution to indicate that the object of his request was to make any communication ir regarding his own future the statement made by the Persian { T~' : V' Uitji -&lt;K ^ ^ fcu. ^4j 2 . From Minister of Justice prior to his departure for Geneva it will be seen that the Persians proposed to take theliine before the league that the cancellation of the Concession was an internal matter which foreigners^ 'including the meague of Nations, had no right to discuss'. It would presumably be open to the league in the event of the Delegation taking tnis line to ask the International Court ior a ruling on this point. 3. Miong other extracts submitted, attention may be invited to an important and well-informed article in uo-day's 'Tir.es' on the Persian situation generally ana to a rather mischievous article by i-r. Em** in the 'Daily Herald' of 7th January. 4. I attach an appreciation of the situation as at 15th December 1932 by Lr. Elkington, General Manager in Persia oi the A.P.G.C., which has been circulated the Aiiddle East Committee,twhich speaks for’itself. oe nr.

Department. ;restrict output to that point compatible with retaining Ma. possession. It may be assumed,Lr. Elkington's i* view/,that in the event of this line being adopted by 'Persia the Persian Government will avoid any provocation which could be held to justify active intervention by British forces. (b) the closing down of operations by force ma.ieure after due notice and entailing the evacuation of the Company’s personnel. This in Mr. Elkington's view would be provocative action which would be taken by the Persian Government only quite deliberately. Note earlier in the memorandum tne statement that the Persians could probably make available in Khuzistan within 48 hours three infantry brigades of about 2500 each, together with supporting cavalry and machine guns^ as he says, active intervention (with a view to seizing oilfields or the likej would obviously be in such circumstances a very serious problem, o. For the moment we must await the result of the iiscussions at Geneva. The general situation appears to be normal and the Persians have carefully avoided giving us any cause for complaint.

The cancellation of the D’Arcy Concession and the subsequent diplomatic exchanges which have taken place between His Britannic Majesty’s Government and the Persian Government, would appear to have now reached a stage when both governments have announced their intention of referring the dispute to the Council of the League of Nations. We can thus take this opportunity to re-assess values, estimate further possibilities and consider consequent develop ments. It is the writer’s opinion, that it is practically impossible for His Imperial Majesty The Shah to rescind the cancellation of the Concession; to do so would shake the Throne and the existing regime in Persia to its foundations, and finally, if forced to abandon the position which the Crown and the Government have taken up - a position which has been approved by the Majlis and possesses the support of the Country - we tnen must ee prepared to be faced with a new regime and a completely new se t of circumstances in Persia. On the other hand, the pressure being exercised by His Britannic Majesty’s Government is severe and is, in the writer’s opinion, not only unexpected by but most disquieting to the Persian Government. Nevertheless, the Persian Government is batting on a gooo wicket; the country is organised, controlled, and ordered, 8n l all subversive elements, which a comparatively short time ago i-Cdt nave been expected to exercise an influence in our favour P°n such a situation, have now been completely eliminated.In the 'Scheme for the defence of the Anglo -Persian Oil Company’s Property in South Persia” dated September 1929 and its subsequent amendments 3 problems are dealt ^ith ? viz pro blem I 3 Ihe evacuation of women and children dependants of white and British Indian employees of the* Anglo Persian Oil Company. Pro blem lie Defence against widespread risings or insurrec tion following on a weakening ox the Central Authority in Persia,, Probl em III, Defence against a definite attack by force of the strength oi a Division or more equipped on modern European lines* And the object of the Scheme is: (a) To defend the Oilfields, the pipe-line and the various stations where essential services are performed,, (b) To ensure the safety of the Anglo Persian Oil C ompany : s pe :• s onne 1 * (c) To ensure the continuance of work in all stages of the movement of oil from well to tanker* Problem III e is considered to be a major operation to be dealt with by the Committee of Imperial Defence, and is tnerefore not considered in the Scheme which postulates a disintegration or weakening of the Central Government’s authority, with the consequent intervention of the minimum xorces of His Britannic Majesty’s Government to maintain law an ^ and to rally around itself the 'better elements whether tribal or otherwise in the affected districts. Problem II 6 postulates a weakening of Central Authority, iue situation to-day is indicative of no weakening of the Central Government’s authority; very much the reverse, and tue forces of His Britannic Majesty’s Government available or a lxocated lor the purposes described above, can only be re- g-rd^d as hopelessly inadequate in the face of a hostile Government and populace. It can be assumed, with reasonable accuracy, that the rS i an G ove rnment can place in Khuzistan, within 48 hours, brigades of Infantry, strongly supported by cavalryft 'Q./3 and machine guns but lacking in aircraft and artillery, field or heavy. hach brigade cannot number less than 2500 bayonets, and whilst the material is as yet untried, the equipment is good and the spirit, as far as one can judge, could be relied upon in the initial stages (One such Brigade is already located in the Province). It v/ould seem, therefore, that a continuance of its operations by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in face: of a hostile government and populace, could not be contemplated for a moment except under conditions which are far removed from those measures at present postulated in the existing Scheme of Defence which is referred to in this memorandum. We have therefore only to examine Problem I. which in any event becomes at once an urgent necessity should the active intervention of the British Government become necessary, A statement is attached hereto showing the numbers of men, women and children, both white and British Indian, and the areas in which these employees and their dependants are at present located. A further statement is attached showing the aerodromes in the immediate vicinity or adjacent to the Company* a areas of operations, and a note on wireless communications. One can presume that with a Persian Central Government in full authority, due warning and escort will be furnished by the Persian Authorities to enable us to evacuate all women and children from the country, and we m ust also contemplate the eventuality of the Persian Authorities requesting us to evacuate the men as well. It is hardly conceivable that the Persian Government would obstruct such an evacuation or act in Q ny way that would necessitate'the active interventionIt can therefore be presumed that so long as the Persian Government exercises its authority the evacuation of Yeomen and children, and possibly men, can be effected from Persia without difficulty, and that all that remains to be organised are the necessary arrangements for their reception in Iraq, and their ultimate repatriation from that country. To revert once again to possible eventualities which can be envisaged as the situation new stands. In our opinion these are (a) The maintenance of the ? status quo’ combined with passive resistance to an extent which -would render the Gompany '* s ope rations on a normai scale virtua 1 impossible. Inw r hich case the Company would have no alternative 'lout to restrict throughput to that point compatible with retaining possession. (b) The closing down of operations by force majeure after due notice and entailing the evacuation of the Comp any 1 s personnel* With regard to (a) it may be assumed that the measures adopted by the Persian Government will be sc designed as to offer no provocation for the active intervention of the forces of H.B*M ? s Government. With regard to (b) this con be assumed to ce a provocative action which the Persian Government will take with its eyes open and having regard to the forces available at her disposal to support such action. It is, of course, quite outside the scope of this memorandum to discuss the consequent retaliatory measures which might be taken by the British Government. We should like to emphasise that the foregoing notes are the expressions of personal opinion only, localised at that, but nevertheless w&gt;e trust, ox some use to those with wider know' lodge of these events.

Present: All the representatives of the Members of the Council, and the Secretary-General. The United Kingdom was represented by Mr. Cadogan, Czechoslovakia by M. Heindrich, France by M. Massigli, Germany by Baron von Weizsacker, Italy by M. Biancheri, Japan by M. Nagaoka, Norway by M. Lange, and Poland by Count Raczynski, Spain by M. de Zulueta. 3189 . Dispute between Bolivia and Paraguay. M. Costa du Reis, representative of Bolivia, and M. Caballero de Bedoya, representative of Paraguay, came to the Council table. The President informed the Council that, since its meeting on December 6 th, he had received from the President of the Commission of Neutrals a telegram , 1 dated December 10 th, and a further telegram of December 16 th . 2 3 * He drew the Council’s special attention to the last paragraph of the second telegram, which read: “ The Commission of Neutrals would be very glad if it could count upon the valuable support of the League in this work of peace and humanity. I venture to suggest that Your Excellency and the Governments Members of the League should cable to the Governments of Bolivia and Paraguay in support of the proposals in question, and I should be grateful if you would notify this Commission.” The Committee of Three appointed by the Council to follow this question had prepared the t\\o following draft telegrams to be sent, one to the Governments interested and the other to the President of the Commission of Neutrals: (a) Draft 1 elegram from the President of the Council to the Governments of Bolivia and Paraguay . z The Commission of Neutrals at Washington has just communicated to the Council the text of the Convention which it is submitting to your Government in order to put an end to the bloodshed in the Chaco and to arrive by pacific means at a final settlement of the ispute between Bolivia and Paraguay. Under the Covenant, of which your Government 18 a sl g n aTory, the Council is responsible for the maintenance of peace, and it hereby earnestly appeals to your Government in the name of all the Members of the League to accept as speedily as possible the Convention proposed by the Commission of Neutrals.

The Council has throughout followed your efforts with appreciation heartedly supports your present action. It has decided to despatch to the two parf t the following telegram (see draft telegram above). The Council would be glad informed of any developments in regard to the Commission’s important proposal” ^ The Council approved the text of the draft telegrams. The President added that, in view of the request in the paragraph to which he had ref in the last telegram from the Commission of Neutrals, he thought that the efforts to hr pacific settlement of the dispute would be considerably helped if the Members of the C who had diplomatic representatives at Asuncion and La Paz would ask them to convey to? Bolivian and Paraguayan Governments the sentiments which had been expressed at the Cou? meeting. Mr. Cadogan was sure that his Government would wish to contribute in any way it cotili towards the settlement of the dispute, and he would at once request that instructions mightbt sent to its representatives in Bolivia and Paraguay to make the representations desired . 6 M. Massigli was certain that, in accordance with the President’s desire, his Government would send the necessary instructions to its representatives in the two capitals concerned. M. Biancheri also felt sure that his Government would give the necessary instructions to its representatives at La Paz and Asuncion. Baron von W eizsacker w ould not fail to inform his Government of the desire expressed for diplomatic action to be taken in the capitals of Bolivia and Paraguay. M. de Zulueta, on behalf of his Government, associated himself with the statements just made. He desired also to offer his thanks and sincere sympathy to the President and Commissiou of Neutrals, whose efforts for the settlement of the dispute between two countries, which werenot only neighbours but closely akin by history, tongue and culture, were appreciated by everyone On behalf of Spain, he would appeal to the two countries to make a generous effort to accept the honourable settlement proposed and thus give the world an example wdiich w r ould be universal]' appreciated. P 16 President thought that all the Members of the Council were agreed on this matter I he Council w^ould certainly appreciate the offers of support made by the representatives of certain countries. The Secretary-General felt sure that the Council would wish that a report of the pre&gt;ent meeting should be transmitted as rapidly as possible to all States Members of the League. Fortu nately, the erection of the new League wireless station made it possible for the League to do that without at the same time incurring any expense. He would therefore suggest that he should authorised to transmit a summary of the Council’s proceedings over the League station that mg 1 so that it might be made immediately available to all Governments. He would propose that t e text should be sent in English and French, and, he thought the Council would agree in this case, m pamsh. It would seem that the use of the League wireless station in thus pressing for imme ia concerted international action in the interests of peace was exactly that for which the station &amp; been primarily intended. I he proposal of the Secretary-General ivas approved. 1 Document €. 843 . 1932 .VII.C./ 69 th Session/P.V. i 6 ((i) SIXTY-NINTH SESSION OF THE COUNCIL LEAGUE OF NATIONS the Co nmsu&gt; n } )h xytft rnst. it ge upon the partis ement of the Chaco iciation and whole- - two parties to-dav be glad to be kept it nrrmneol ” ' MINUTES it proposal SIXTEENTH MEETING (PUBLIC) Held on Monday, December igth, ig 32 , at 6 p.m. President: Mr. Lester.

The President. — My colleagues will have received document C. 841 . 1932 .VII, containing the memorandum of the Government of the United Kingdom on the subject of the dispute con cerning the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. Document C. 844 . 1932 .VII, which contained the letter addressed to the Secretary-General on December 17 th by the permanent delegate of Persia accredited to the League of Nations, has also been circulated. In this letter, the permanent delegate of Persia communicated a telegram from his Government informing him that it had intended to lay the dispute before the Council, and that, pending an agreement with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, it had not taken any steps against the company and did not intend to do so. The Persian Government thought, however, that the Council should not begin the examination of this question until sufficient time had been allowed for the despatch to Geneva of a representative from Teheran with all the documentary material in the possession of the Teheran Government. This appears to me to be a reasonable request, and the Council may wish to postpone consideration of the matter until the January session. In these circumstances, I have sent the following telegram 1 to the two parties yesterday, December 18 th: “ I am fully confident that, pending examination by the Council of the dispute between the Governments of the United Kingdom and Persia concerning the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, the two Governments will refrain from any act or step that might aggravate or extend the dispute.” Since this matter has been laid before the Council under Article 15 of the Covenant, the Secretary-General has certain preliminary duties to fulfil, duties which are indicated in the first paragraph of the article. He has, I understand, already taken the preliminary steps which such - a PP eal necess itates. Perhaps he will now be good enough to inform the Council of what he Ihe Deputy Secretary-General. — Upon receipt of the letter of December 14 th from the secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of the United Kingdom asking him to place the dispute e ween the United Kingdom Government and the Persian Government concerning the Anglo- ersian Oil Company on the Councils agenda, the Secretary-General the same day brought this twp 3 knowledge of the Members of the Council and of the Persian Government through nn +1 e ^ lan P er nianent delegate at Geneva, and, as it was his duty to do, duly placed the question n ttle Councils agenda. 1 Doc unient C. 847 .M. 391 . 1932 .VII.After receiving the United Kingdom Government’s memorandum on th brought it to the notice of the Council.

We cannot therefore come to any decision in the matter. The Persian Government had already decided to notify the Council of the intimidating—it might almost be said, threatening—attitude which His Britannic Majesty’s Government has thought fit to adopt towards Persia. We have therefore no objection to the matter being laid before the Council. Should the Council intend examining whether the Persian Government was or was not entitled to cancel the concession, it is obvious that the Council will deem it necessary to wait until a Persian representative can attend. We consider, moreover, that, prior to adopting any attitude whatsoever, the Council must first hear the Persian Government’s statement. As the discussion of this question will require the presence of a special representative who will have to be sent from Teheran, and as the documents are at present in that city, it will be materially impossible for the Council to begin its examination of the matter immediately. Furthermore, as the Persian Government has already stated that, pending an agreement with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, it has not taken and has no intention of taking any measures against that undertaking, there is no reason for considering the matter as urgent.” As you will realise, my Government is only asking for the necessary time to send as its representatives special delegates who will have to come from Teheran. I therefore propose that the Council should adjourn until they arrive. On reading the British memorandum, I was glad to see that, in paragraph 35 , the United Kingdom Government states: ' His Majesty’s Government are most anxious that the present dispute shall not disturb the friendly relations which have hitherto existed between the Persian Government and themselves and they have every hope that the action of the Council will result in amicable and equitable settlement of the dispute ”. It adds that His Majesty’s Government will do everything in their power to co-operate to this end. As the Persian Government is no less anxious than the United Kingdom Government to maintain the friendly relations which exist between the two countries and by which they have been united for many years, may I venture, without anticipating my Government’s opinion, to put forward a personal consideration ? I wonder whether the present situation really necessitated an appeal to Article 15 . In conclusion, I renew my proposal for an adjournment, pending the arrival of the special delegates, who will be provided with the necessary documents and instructions. The President. — My colleagues will join me, I am sure, in expressing the Council’s satisfac tion with the action taken by the Secretary-General and with what he proposed to do by way of preparation for our work. Pending the Persian Government’s communication of its statement and the completion of the Secretary-General’s arrangements as provided for in Article 15 of the Covenant, the Council might perhap 3 decide at once to place this question on the agenda of its next ordinary session on January . , I think I shall be voicing the unanimous view of the Council by expressing to the two parties 1 s lull confidence that nothing will be done that might prejudice the Council’s action or aggravate or enlarge the dispute. May I add that the procedure which it is the clear duty of the Council 0 0 low does not, of course, exclude the possibility of an understanding between the two parties ? The proposal of the President was approved. M.

Unfortunately, this expectation had been disappointed. ad create ^ In these circumstances, he was authorised to state that the Polish Government resm i right to define its attitude with regard to the report at a suitable moment, and in Darting? propose any amendments it considered essential. ’ ’ F ^iar,to M. Meyer said he was not aware of the source from which the Polish representative w obtained his information with regard to the ideas of the Committee, to which he had iust refer!? He thought he could say, however, that the Committee had not authorised that internretZ of its views. pcwiM With regard to the difficulties to which the Polish representative had referred they were certainly not due to the German Government. On December qth, Baron von Neurath explained m full detail the reasons for which Germany had been unable to accept the reixin submitted to the Council at the meeting held on that date. Baron von Neurath had given all the necessary explanations and information, and had even made definite proposals for safeguards the interests of the minority and remedying the injustices done. The German Government certainlv accepted full responsibility for its attitude, which was dictated solely by its responsibility towards the minorities of Pomerelia and Poznania. Count Raczynski said that, with reference to the first part of the German representative’s remarks, he would venture to draw his attention to the fact that he had apparently misunderstood w a ount Raczynski had said. 1 he latter had laid no claim to knowledge of the Committee's opinions. He had merely suggested that the Committee might perhaps for its part have expressed more c early its views as to the difficulties with which the Council was faced in drawing up a report. ,, 1 ^ re ? arc * the proposed adjournment, the Polish representative desired to point out that e o servations submitted by Baron von Neurath at a previous meeting were known for a long p&gt;een se ^ forth on several occasions in the Council and before the members ^ r'E ^ ommittee ’ wpl ° had time to study them. They had not apparently been regarded as jus i e since, after all, they had not been taken into consideration by the Committee and had not enabled the latter to present a report acceptable to the representative of the Reich. As ,to the German Government’s responsibility, Count Raczynski desired merely to call the ounc 1 s a tention to the interest which, according to the statements of the German representative, i 6 J^ rman Government took in citizens of German stock belonging to other countries. He noted a so, ovvever, that the situation was not identical, because, whereas Poland had certain contractual mmon y undertakings in virtue of which she was bound to discuss such questions before the ounci ermany was exempted therefrom. Count Raczynski considered that if Germany took o muc in eres m minorities, she might perhaps also consider the need for accepting on her part certain obligations in regard to German citizens of foreign stock. E j R simply to point out that the question of the protection of minorities had pZ!! dl 1 s ? uss / ! d at len S th in the Sixth Committee at the last Assembly.

Persian Government still believes that said cancella tion is not calculated to provoke conflict between two Governments, seeing that it has from outset expressed its desire to arrive at equitable agreement with Anglo-Persian. Nevertheless, after action of United Kingdom Government, my Government, hoping to obtain justice and protection from League of Nations, intended to submit its case to Council, and that intention was notified British Government. Consequently, we will not fail to send °ur special delegates to Geneva, but we hope that material possibil ity will be given us to enable said delegates to get there.

Meanwhile there have been no further incidents at Abadan or elsewhere, and special precautions seem to have been taken by the Persian authorities to prevent any disturbances. On the occasion of a recent visit by the Flagship of the East Indies Squadron, special steps seem to have been taken to ensure an unusually cordial reception by the local authorities. X Despatches received from Mr. Hoare describe in greater detail the discussions which took place between him and the Foreign Minister and others at the time of the cancellation of the/' ■ - the concession but add nothing material to what has already been reported by telegram. The Russian reaction to the cancellation of the concession is described in an interesting despatch from Moscow No.705 dated 6th December, on P.Z.7870/32. The question of tactics has been the subject of considerable discussion between Mr. Hoare x and the Foreign Office. It seems quite clear that the Persian Government (as distinct from the Shah) realise the weakness of their present position and the improbability that they will receive any consolation from the League; and while there is practically no prospect of their facing the loss of prestige involved in the withdrawal of their letter cancellling the concession, they would clearly welcome any action on our part which would ease their difficulties. Mr. Hoare, as in the past, has been rather anxious to meet the Persians so far as possible. The Foreign Office in their telegrams of 23rd December, Nos. 149 and 150 (P.Z.7856/32) gave him a general line. As a result of Tdiscussion with the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, he again reverted to his earlier suggestions that we should build a bridge over w ich the Persians could retreatf^ fiiese telegrams caused some uneasiness to the Secretary of State, on whose instructions the Foreign Office were informed that^xhere was to be question of a withdrawal from the general lines approved by the Cabinet^ ke would like an opportunity of communicating with the Foreign Secretary.

There can ; be no question of abandoning the proceedings at the League, but H.M.G. would be prepared, if all goes well, to co-operate with the Persians when the time comes by trying to find a formula which would sufficiently save their faces while providing a satisfactory basis for negotiations. The most important development in the last fortnight has, of course, been the fall of Teymourtache. We are still rather in the dark as to its precise significance and cause. The Minister’s views will be found in his telegrams No.242 of 24th December on P.Z. 7867/32 and No.l of 2nd January on P.Z. 87/33. The National Bank scandal to which he refers resulted in September last in the suicide of the German manager. Detailed information as to its magnitude is lacking, but the Chief Manager of the Imperial Bank informed Mr. Hoare o-f ttL U»kO (that 'there have been transactions which, if not fraudulent, were highly improper. But so far as he can ascertain, nothing reflecting on Teymourtache personally has been brought to light, hard though-and openly-the Minister of Finance has sought for evidence”. The disappearance of Teymourtache must inevitably make a substantial difference to the future of the general negotiations if and when they are resumed. m ^r (K. 6931/3880/34). ) CL..J^BgtA.

His Majesty’s Government have two objects, one ultimate and one immediate. Ultimate object is conclusion of new agreement between Persian Government and Company which will be suf ficiently satisfactory to both parties and enable Company to continue operations in Persia on basis of those amicable relations with Persian Government which are generally ad mitted to be essential condition of successful continuance of its operations. Immediate object is resumption of negotia- tionp between Government and Company with a view to con- i elusion of such agreement, such negotiations being conducted on a basis which does not put Company at a disadvantage, i.e. 1 on a basis of equality. 2. it seems clear that object of Persian Government in cancelling concession was not to turn Company out of Persia but to place it in a position where it would be bound to accept Government's terras. This object has for the moment been defeated by action of His Majesty's Government in up case. Pad Persian Government complied with °br request to withdraw cancellation negotiations could have t) * eri r8R um«d between them and Company on basis of equality ! ajesty's Government could have dropped out. As er81an Averment refused, however. His Majesty's Govern- ’trot decided to try to attain their two objects by bringing ^Uer before Council.2. t»ftY r ft nit) • ■ - '1 o '&lt; / 3 # object can perhaps be achieved during coming session of Council but is only a step towards attain ment of ultimate object which must involve detailed negotia tions between Company and Persian Government, and while these continue it is essential that shadow of Council should hang over proceedings. Otherwise we should lose advantage which we have gained by our action up to now and should not ensure that negotiations take place on basis of equality. 4. Any proposal resulting in lianedlate removal of question from Agenda of Council would thus not suit our book (see paragraphs 3 and 4 of my telegram ho. 150 /~of December 23rg7). Unless therefore Persians are prepared to withdraw cancellation and negotiate on basis that If no agreement is reached concession will remain in full force, case must remain on Agenda of Council until new agreement Is definitely concluded. 5. In order to attain immediate object, however, formula will have to be found to enable negotiations to be resumed on basis of equality, and there should be adequate opportunities of doing this at Geneva. &lt;e shall of course be perfectly willing to help Persians to get out of mess by co-operating with them in trying to devise a solution. If satisfactory formula for resumption of negotiations could be found in discussions at Geneva, council proceedings might be adjourned pending negotiations. You win see from above that His Majesty's Govern- ent could not accept idea of putting an aid now to pro- c^edingg G Wieva| xhle would Involve throwing away ad vantages of present position, we should, moreover, Justify 'wsian contention that we had brought the case before the council unnecessarily if, after having done so on grounds bbfl'tt •••••*— i 3* that It w»* likely to load to a rupture, we now agreed to its renoval from Agenda without having attained anything beyond expression of Persian willingness to negotiate with company* Further, having once ta*en case off Agenda in such clrcuraatances we could not put it on again. 7.

From official statement made by Persian delegate at meeting the Council of the League of Nations on December 20th you will have seen that desire of Persian Government to maintain friendly relations with His Majesty^s Government is unmistakable and they have noted that their wish is reciprocated. They are therefore anxious that the difficulty which has arisen on the subject of D'Arcy Concession - a difficulty which was in part due to mis understanding - shall be speedily eettled to the satisfaction of all concerned. I feel that such a settlement will be promoted if (grp. undec.) to give a new direction to negotiations which have been for some years past (without leading to ary final result) engaging the attention of Persian Government and the Company. The Persian Government have felt that this failure to reach an agreement may well have been due to the fact that basis of discussion was D’Arcy concession. That document may at the time when neither actual v/ealth of Persian Oil fields was proved nornor the Immense developments of oil industry were foreseen have been as precise a definition of relations between Company and Qr-vernaent as it was possible to formulate. In conditions political as well as economic that exist today the Persian Government feel that a new definition of relations between themselves and the company would be to their mutual advantage and that this purpose can be most readily achieved by negotiation of a new concession. The Persian Government are confident, having regard to views frankly expressed by company, that a satisfactory agreement can be reached and they trust in the light of explanations furnished ab've His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom will a(;ree to remove question from the agenda cf Counci?- of the League of Nations. Should hopes of Persia?! Government be disappointed and a direct settlement with company prove unobtainable the Persian Government will be glad t.) reach an agreement with His Majesty’s Government for .issue to be settled through diplomatic channel, by arbitration or by whatever appears best fitted to er.sure success. addressed to Poreifco office No. 248, repeated to Government cf India No, i-34,This Docume nt is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should b e * returned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.] (E.6S31/3880/34).

General situation as we see it is as follows. His Majesty’s Government have two objects, one ultimate and one ^mediate. Ultimate object is conclusion of new agreement between Persian Government and Company which will be suf ficiently satisfactory to both parties and enable Company to continue operations in Persia on basis of those amicable relations with Persian Government which are generally ad- mitted to be essential condition of successful continuance of its operations. Immediate et^ect is resumption of negotia tions between Government and Company with a view to con clusion of such agreement, such negotiations being conducted on a basis which does not put Company at a disadvantage, i.e. on a oasis of equality. It seems clear that object of Persian Government in Cunceiling concession was not to turn Company out of Pmsia out to place it in a position where it would be bound to accept Government's terns.

Sir J&lt; Cadman is replying that, as Persian Minister is aware, subject has since been before Council of League at Geneva, ’'hen President, in his concluding remarks intimated that Pact that it had been brought before the Council did not preclude possibility of discussions between the two parties, namely His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Persian Government*, If, as Sir Jo Cadman trusted.trusted, a satisfactory tasis for a continuance of negotiations between the Persian Government and the Anglo- Persian Oil Company should he found, he would he happy to discuss the matter further. 'R n ends. 5, A*bove is present position so far as Company are concerned. Object of Sir J. Cadman's last letter is to indicate that dispute is now one between Persian Government and His Majesty’s Government, and that negotiations can only be resumed on a basis which will be satisfactory t o His Majesty’s Government. It has been framed, however, to avoid any possible implication that His Majesty’s Government are standing in the way of a settlement. On the other hand, both His Majesty’s Government and the Company consider that satisfactory basis for resumption of negotiations is only likely to be arrived at by keeping question within the orbit of the League. It is important moreover that nothing should be said or done which might encourage the Persian Government to think that they can play off the Company against His Majesty's Government or that they can escape proceedings Geneva merely by opening direct negotiations with Company meanwhile. Any reopening of negotiation between Persian Government and Company at this stage on an uncertain basis or any apparent willingness on the part of the Company to send representatives to Tehran in advance of nex ^ meeting, would merely weaken position both of His Majesty Government and of Company themselves when matter next comes before Council and render it easier for Persians to argue that action of His Majesty's Government m raising matter underV under Article 15 of Covenant forms only obstacle to an arrangement between themselves and the Company,, 4o For these reasons we consider that proceedings should continue at Geneva in January and that negotiations in the meanwhile between Persian Government and Company are undesirableo On the other hand it is clear that if Company are to be able to continue their operations in Persia some agreement satisfactory to both parties will eventually have to be arrived at by direct negotiation,, Such negotiations can, however, only take place with any hope of success on the basis that in fact D : Arcy concession is regarded as maintained pending conclusion of new agreements. In view of difficulty of getting Shah to approve formal withdrawal of cancellation, only means of establishing satisfactory basis for direct negotiations seems to be adoption of some formula which will give Company necessary guarantee while sufficiently saving Persian face* Adoption of such a formula should form part of proceedings at Geneva, and we doubt whether agreement upon it is likely before meeting in January, Should Persian Government however show signs of desiring discussions with you with a view to finding a formula on these lines which does not involve any withdrawal from position which His Majesty's Government and Company have tarnen up, there would be no objection to such a discussion W1 ^ a view to facilitating agreement at Geneva. Naturally tnj do not wish course of proceedings at Geneva to be such a ° L0 ren der agreement more difficult-.

T H WE the honour to report that the cancellation of the Anglo-Persian Oil p nimv's concession has been recorded with considerable satisfaction by the V oin P f rip.o \ n extremely partial review of the history of the concession ^•ed in an article in the Izvestiya of the 2nd December. a p pe&lt;n g artic j e begins by observing that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, r , the standard Oil and Royal Dutch Shell “ forms one of the strongest props nf international imperialism, and plays a large political and economic role in the ® 0 f the British Empire, being closely linked up with the British General iLf, •• ,, m i i t a dds that the history of the company presents a rare picture of colonial rapacity.” After describing the original terms of the D Arey Concession it remarks that these terms were only conditionally carried out, and that the company emancipated itself from all central control, maintained its own armed forces, and finding that its political privileges were restricted after the war. attempted in 1924 to raise the local tribes against the Central Govern- ment. The increase in production and in capitalisation of this giant ot the present-day ” oil industry is recorded, and the article then observes that in spite of the company’s vast income it attempted to reduce the royalties payable to the Persian Government by means of the virtuous practice of wi iting down capital and profits, and by reckoning its investments in Allied enterprises as part of its overhead expenditure. The company is then accused of having “systematically infringed” the subsequent agreement (the Armitage-bmith Agreement), which it was obliged to make after its first large scale conflict wit the Persian Government in 1920. Notwithstanding the decrease in the company s production in the current year of 600,000 tons compared with the previous yeai, the Izvestiya suggests that its profits were employed in further investments so as to reduce the surplus available for the calculation of royalties payable to the Persian Government, and quotes the statement of the chairman of the company at the last general meeting to the effect that the ” previous year s working showed the exceptional financial strength of the company. In these circumstances, it adds, the reduction in royalties provoked new criticism in the Persian press and demands for the annulment of the concession. 3. The concluding paragraph of this article, of which I enclose a translation, supports the action of the Persian Government in cancelling the concession, suggesting that its existence is incompatible with the Persian Constitution It adds that the “ decision of the question does not lie within the scope of legal formulas, but depends upon the interplay of political forces, and applauds the cancellation as an act of considerable courage ” that was only possible owing to the decline in the prestige of the British Empire. 4.

WHAT does the annulment by the Persian Government of D Arcy oncession really mean ? The telegraph agencies are already reporting that tr nghsh Government denies the possibility of annulling or re-examining tlconcession, although this is provided for in the concession agreement TK Government, on their side, have some very serious arguments f ^crsii character in their brief case, and, in the first place, the fact that Constitution especially provides for the impossibility of qrantina / any concessions in Persia or of concluding foreign loans 'without ° • of the Majlis. As is well known, the Persian Majlis never confirmin’ Concession, and f rom the point of view of the Persian Constitution th • fC ^ of the latter is more than doubtful. Bourgeois specialists in intern will, of course, find thousands of reasons to condemn the decision of th ^ aw Government annulling the D'Arcy Concession. It is absolutely clear 6 decision of this question does not lie within the scope of legal forn 1 depends upon the interplay of political forces. Inasmuch as Persia is f a V Ut this question, not only by an oil concern of world-wide importance buth which has the backing of the political and military strength of the t/y 1 ? Empire, the decision regarding the annulment of D'Arcy's Concession can hT be regarded as an act of considerable courage. It became possible only f ^ reason that the British Empire, under the blow of the world economic crisis h already ceased to play its former role in the affairs of the world. Independentr whatever may be the results of negotiations which will take place in the ' future, the present Anglo-Persian conflict constitutes a serious threat to % th colonial policy of England, and its echo in Eastern countries will undoubtedly contribute to the further widening of the fissures in the shaken foundations A the senile British Empire.1st Dece him at i at his he my teleg Ferbugh the offici justified 2 . on the Is I allude of intere regardec away an It will 1 by the G 3.

Tehran, December 3, 1932. ir&gt; IN continuation of my despatch No. 505 of the 30th November, I have the honour to transmit to you, herewith, a copy of the note that I addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 2nd December. Your instructions reached me on Thursday afternoon and, as I reported in my telegram Na201 of the 1st December I sent his Highness a peremptory message that I wished to see him at noon the following day. As it was a Friday, the interview took place at his house, where I found him reading a theosophical review. It is recorded in m y telegram No. 203 of the 2nd December, and there is little that I can add here. Ferou°hi was obviously upset and apprehensive, but he would not withdraw from the official position that the cancellation of the concession was justifiable and ^ 2. I enclose press extracts giving an account of the speeches in the Majlis on the 1st December, including the statement by the Minister of Finance to which I alluded in my conversation with F'eroughi.( 1 ) The statement has few points of interest not already covered by the original letter and may upon the whole be regarded as a rather pitiful attempt by a normally honest-minded man to explain away an act of dishonestly forced upon him by a stronger mind than his own. It will be noticed that the resolution of the Majlis approving the step taken by the Government was passed unanimously. . 3. From Mirza Mustapha Khan Fateh, the head of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company marketing organisation in Tehran, who has had an enlightening private conversation with the Minister of Finance, as well as from other sources, I gather that immediately after his return from the south on the 14th November the Shah ordered a startled Cabinet Council to annul the concession. No Minister appears to have had the courage to point out either the dishonesty or the danger of such a course, and some even seem to have thought that there was no real harm in it, the supposition being that His Majesty’s Government might make a fro forma protest, after which everything would go on as before until a new agreement had been reached. Taqizadeh did, however, he claimed, persuade the Shah to insert the passage stating that the Persian Government were willing to consider a new concession, which did not figure in the original draft. Ine Shah probably took his decision in a moment of impatience at Teymourtacne s failure to reach a settlement with the company after four years of bargaining, his impatience being founded upon a very real and permanent determination to acquire a larger share in the profits of the company. His foreign contacts are so few and he appears to be so much at the mercy of his impulses that it probably never occurred to him that his action would affect Anglo-Persian relations m any sphere except that of the company, and even then he may have thought that only the company would be concerned. • • i 4- It seems quite certain that instructions were sent to all provincial centres to celebrate the occasion by decorations and illuminations, and that the P u ^ c rejoicings were organised and enforced by the police as was the case m e capital.

R - H. HOARE. • Enclosure in No. 1. Mr. Hoare to Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs. M. le Ministre, Tehran, December 2, 1932 HIS Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom have taken cognisance of the terms of the letter addressed by the Minister of Finance to the Resident Director of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company on the 27th November (6th Azar 1311). His Majesty’s Government consider the action of the Persian Government in cancelling the company’s concession to be an inadmissible breach of its terms; they take a most serious view of the conduct of the Persian Government and have instructed me to demand the immediate withdrawal of the notification issued to the company. 2. Furthermore, I am directed to state that while His Majesty’s Government still hope that the Persian Government will be at pains to reach an amicable settlement in direct negotiation with the company, His Majesty’s Government will not hesitate, if the necessity arises, to take all legitimate measures to protect their just and indisputable interests. 3. Finally, I have the honour to state that His Majesty’s Government will not tolerate any damage to the company’s interests or interference with their premises or business activities in Persia. I avail, &amp;c. R. H. HOARE.t Extracted from The Iran, No. 3967, of 2nd December, 1932. The proceeding* of the 118th Session of the Eighth term of the Kejllss opened yesterday at 10.46 a.m. After the speech of the Minister of Finance (a translaticn of ehioh appeared in the Messager of this nomning). Haji Muhtashem-us-Saltaneh (Haji Mirza Hass an Khan Esfandieri) said that he did not want to criticise the farmer governments or to flatter the one now in power as both the sovereign and the authorities in power seek after truth and shun untruth; but the point should not remain unmade that, given the attention paid by the present government to all matters concerning the interests of the country, were the concession to be drawn up at the present time, it would be drawn up in such a way as to secure public satisfaction. But conditions prevailing 32 years ago cannot advantageously be compared with those of the present day; conditions for th&lt; despatch of the State affairs in those days arc far from being comparable with those observed today. The Government found In the course of practice some flaws in this concession, to which it drew the attention of the Company 12 years ago, but the desired result was not obtained in the course of these retracted discussions. This, coupled with the daily increasing importance of the oil world politics, caused a certain despondency among the people of this country, as they realised that the advantage that the government ought rightly to derive from these invaluable treasures is denied to the Government. But they also realised that the present Government would certainly devote to this all important question the attention that it /usually« - 2 - 'll usually devotee to all other matters of State* The facts vere Indeed as they expected seeing that the Government again entered into negotiations with the Company four years ago* But the people were anxious to see the result and know about the deoision of their Government; the Majliss, which is the body representing the Mation y dealt with this question several times and the Persian press, again a mftrror of the feeling prevalent amonf the people 9 also discussed the matter on many occasions* The Shah returned from his last trip and the newspaper Iran published good tidings abomt the concession and this caused wild exultation among the people* The appearance of the note from the Minister of Finance to the Besldcnt Director of the Company in the local press caused unprecedented expressions of public delight and e exultation* The concession, as it was, was fraught with two defeats, vis* 1* the conditions under which, and the government through which, the concession was given, and 2, the non-observance by the Company even of the conditions laid down in the same concession* There are three points of controversy in regard to tills eoneession* One is the royalties claimed by the Government on account of thm revenues of the subsidiary companies and the uonp&amp;ny itself* The next is the treatment observed in respect of our Commissioner (the Speaker probably means the range Oi. authority aeeorded to him by the Company - translator and the third is the method of engagement of the staff of the Company* In all of the three items, as the honourable deputies have just heard, even the provisions ; concession were not observed. I must say that the negligence to shown in respect m£ these clauses was more harmful the interests of this country than the concession itself **hicii /wasI was of o aura a dafectiva «is the losaaa incurred by the Gorernment through this eonoeasion ware dafinitaly increased and coaplatad by negligence, (Kaaarunii The concession was cancelled by itaalf)• The speaker then proceeded to say that the delight ahown by the people was not so much for the cancellation of the concession aa for the realisation that the Government newer omits to assert their rights when and where they are to be asserted. The Government dealt with the Company most Reasonably in offering to consider favourably any new concession which the Company may tender and which may safeguard the interests of this sountry at the same time. But if the Company fails to take advantage of this offer there will be no ground for subsequent discontent. The Government will have to perform its duty at the right time, (This is true), Ifahiml (F&amp;him~ul«Mulk) made a speech which embodied many points already raised by the Ilinister of Finance and Huhtashem~d8«-Smltaneh« The points of Interest in his speech arc; He says that he thinks that even the Company does not deny that at the time when the concession was given the interests of the Persian Government were not at all safeguarded because (a) the Government was ignorant or indifferent and (b) the real value of oil was not yet known in the world. The ignorance of the authorities in power at the time can best be realised by some of the terms of the ooneession itself; it is mentioned, for exaa^le, that the Concessioner must pay the annual taxes so far due on the may lands which'contain oil mines, namely Tomans 2,000. With the millions of pounds involved in the concession, what was the worth of the small annual taxes due on those lands? But /thethe Government, not being eonfident of the possibilities and not knowing the real worth of oil, thought to secure at leaet the annual dues as taxes of the lands in question* The speaker then explains the insignificance of the royaltii of the Persian Government, the £300,000 lately offered to Persia against the £800,000 payable to the British Government ss taxes* He says that another 26% taxes art also paid to the British Government out of the dividends due to the share-holders. He says that the Persian Government would not hesitate to give another eonsession to the Company under conditions more favourable to Persia and that assures the Government xm*~the Mejllss tad the people fully approve the step taken by the Government for the caneellatioi of the coneession and will eooperate with the Government for its success* Bashti also made a speech on the same lines* The more Interesting points are as followss- He explains the great delight shown by the people for the cancellation of the concession, stating that its reason can be traced to the fact that the conduct of the Company towards the people and the Government has been so bad that the public detests the Company. He says that while millions sterling were derived from a eonoession based on a slip of torn paper (varaq-pareh), signed by the ignorant and greedy authorities of this e own try, all sorts of formalities were resorted to in order to reduce the 16% royalties of ths Persian Government, the real owner of the mines, to an insignificant item. 'Inspection of the accounts of the Company by able and impartial auditors will chow one day that we have suffered a loss of 100/a or 200/i» in the realisation of our Interests* He then speaks about the behaviour of the Company towards its Persian staff. /While•hlle there were European etaff with Mg salaries, whe&amp;ewer any eoonoay wae sanctioned by the Central Of flees, hundreds of poor Persian workers were s&amp;sked, or the wages, already ln8ignlfl« ,lIlt » ot i &gt;er ® ifcn staff reauosd considerably. Clean water was denied eran to higher Persian staff as the authorities of the Company argued that Persians were not elean aeoustomed to*water and they eould well do without it. An English engineer reeeiwed Tomans 1,000 a month and a Persian engineer with the same talents and qualifications reeeiwed one third of that amount Just because he was a Persian, peasants in Husistan who had imported water puaps for the Irrigation of their lands had to give up the pumps as the prise of Kerosene wae so high. Oil is more expensive ia Khusistan than in ’Iraq and it is more expensive in Bushire than in Tehran. The Company employed Indians who were not •xperta, Just as Persians wera not, and preferred tiiem to ^ Persians who had to obey the ordsrs and instructions of the former in their own eountry# A youth of the Persian staff of the Company wrote an article in one of tne papers giving some data about the oil wells and the importance of epcratioas at Uasjid-i-Suleiman and he was turned out of his job as he was held to hawe been divulging the secrets of his company. The Company was really a Government existing in the bosom of the Persian Government. It owned armed poliee forces up o six years ago. It had Political Agents and Political ri co« which were in communication with the , Iraq people and *i Cui tne Sheikh of Mohammerah. He adds that some years before a number of workers of the Company applied for an increase of their wages which would certainly have meant raising theii wages fro* Tomans 10 to perhaps Tomans 12 per month, bu* in order that no such habit should he adopted by others the Company accused the applicants of having aolsheviiv propens!tieand had reoours© to the good offices of the Governor of Khuaistan who# in order to give them no excuse (for complaint) cicl to silence them (the Company)# banished some 200 to 300 Persian workers and deprived them of their homes and their daily bread. He goes on to say that he himself saw people deprived of their eyes or other important parts of their body in the service of the Company who have been turned out of their work after years of service without any provision for their(? discrepancy or) disability whereas large figures are debited in the accounts of the Company as pensions due to their iSagllsh staff. Dashti then states that .fawab# the Deputy for Shiraz# told him on the day when the Minister of Finance gave a lengthy answer in the Mejliss to his question about the A.F.O.C.# some time ago, that the Government auditors who usually have to sign the yearly ace jpx oi ^ery Company had written underneath the accounts of the Company that the same accounts were correct and acceptable i£ the royalties of the Persian Government were paid fully and correctly. This proves that the accounts are not genuine and that the Persian Government are being played with. The speaker says that he Is very much inclined to think tnat the Company harboured political ill-will aga.un3t t^e - ersian Government because, as everybody knows# the royalties of the oil company are being devoted tby the Government to reserve funds of the country, which in turn are usually devoted to highly important expenditure of the State li e the purchase of munitions and warships# which art es^ i ^ -1 ^ jr the existence of the country, and any reduction of these royalties is a direct blow to the very existence of t ie country and this is why the general public is so pessimistic about the designs of the country and Is delirious withtt; canoellatioxi of the d’Arcy conoesaion, even more 30 tiian at tiie time of abrogation of the oapitulatory rights of foreigners in this country* 'ine speaker says that he ^members the opinio expressed hy Stuart (? Ooha Stuart Eill) one of the renowned English tninkers, naaely that there is no demand more reasonable and logical than that expressed by a nation which demands to have its own rights and this means that when a nation demanus its rights it is evident that that nation has reached maturity and its rights should be accorded to it* h&amp;shti then proceeds to explain why Xersians demanded and obtained the Constitution; how they were tired &gt; of the incompetence of their rulers end how with the revolution they demanded the removal of all fetters which hindered their freedom and evolution (Afeor; there were 83 concessions which we demanded to be cancelled). Thece iaeals of reform and toe f* aaehise demanded by Jie nation were cherished in their hearts till the day ox’ the eoup- d^htat of 1299 and ever since toe clamour for the realisation of these reforms and ideals was being more strongly asserted and intensified, 'fhe present Government has ulreud; effected many of these reforms ana. today is the tam of the d * 4 ic,&gt; concession, for the cancellation of which the w-ovemm&gt;..it must be heartily congratulated. All revolutionary governments in toe world have abrogated all toe agreements and contracts signed and concluded by their predecessors and tersia has to follow the lead and no nation should be condemned to starvation* The motion proposed hy Rslmema, as follows. was then read:- •The Rational Consultative Assembly expresses /itsits approval of the recent decision of the Government in regard to the abrogation of the d f Arey concession and guuports and admires the step taken by the Government in this matter.* Rahnema made a speech in support of this motion, of whien the more salient points are as follows:- Rahnema says that the tremendous benefits derived by the company from the oil mines and the hard blow now dealt to this exploitation will cause a strenuous campaign on the part of foreigners both in the country and outside. w We must know how to fight against this campaign by forwarding the necessary evidence in support of our cause”. A writer has written a hook in which he deals with the d’Arcy concession, stating that the concession was stolen from d’Arey by a priest, who was the agent of a foreign Government, in the steamer in which the latter was voyaging. Ihy that concession was stolen and why the majority ol the shares were bought by that Government afterwards is because oil has become extremely important in world politics ba.uct tue discovery of the Diesel engine. One of the great states u * of Great Britain writes in his book that he did not sleep for nights during the deliberations over the importance ol finding some oil mines for Great Britain for the conversion of the fuel of English battleships from coal into oil and this was before the d’Arcy concession was taken. One of the Englishmen, Mr. Araitage Smith, who took part iu tae settlement of the accounts of the Oil Company wit * ae Persian Government wrote a report which shows plainip the behaviour of the Company towards this country and the various breaches of the same concession by that company. Revenue accruing from the subsidiary oil companies 1ormed with the capital of the A.F.O.C., used to go to the safes of /thePersian royalties* this the latter without any paynent of was contrary to the text of the concession and it was Armitage Smith who was able to extract aoae £800,000 fro. the A.P.O.C., on account of these royalties. .jioti er violation of the terms of the concession by the Company is that they opened their fieflnery in .ngland ** the alte Qf the ref inery has grown now into a large town on account of the existence of the refinery there. This deprived Persia of a large amount of capital invested ia the refinery and big revenues, accommodation and employment of Persian workers whieh might certainly have been secured were the refinsry built in Perala. ^ ain cottier breaah of good faith on the par of the A.PcO.O., is the reduefeion »f their oil output during rucont eai-y. it is stated in answer to this objection that world over •product ion of oil was the basis of this policy of reduction of output but this is not true as the saae Company holds a concession of oil in Venezcella where three years ago the Company’s oil output was the 7th or the 8th in the degree of importance in the world’s oil production and in 1930 the saae nines had an output of 17,000,000 tons which ranged them as tne third among the oil-producing countries. Why then snould the same Company reduce the number of oil wells in ^eraia iron 50 to 2 and bring Persian oil output to such low figures? Rahnema then states that the only safeguard for tiie ^ ro motion of any agreement or concession in the world ib ^ a it 8hould be based on a reasonable and just basis •s otherwise the agreement in question gets cancelled of itself. oaa a8 an exajl |pi e man y agreements which *8*e concluded and signed with all good faith and reliability fcy boL-i contracting powers but whieh were abrogated, /automaticallyautomatically or ua.illi^iy tfterwM., ju S t because they were uot bounded on Just base.-. y*r 8 i. wae with toe oil concession ana represented in w instaneee her case and asicad for satisfaction ana rectification.

Sir ’ with reference to my telegram No. 1 91 of the 28th November, reporting k v the resident director of tdie Anglo-Persian Oil Company on the oTth 1 November of a formal letter from the Minister of Finance cancelling the D Arcv Concession. I have the honour to transmit herewith a translation of that document. nreviously there had been an intensive press campaign advltingSep butls the Minister of Finance had informed Mr. Jacks that he was on the point of submitting to the company proposals for establishing Winns on a new basis, I did not attach to the press campaign the importance I t UH otherwise have done but regarded it rather as a demonstration intended to SengAen the position of the Persian Government when it came to actual negotiations. ^ fQr Fo n Affairs had just returned from his visit to Geneva and Ankara, and I had already asked for an interview which took place yesterday^the 29th November)^ ^ j to i d ^ Highness that I did not Di’ODose to discuss in detail the action taken by the Persian Government as I Warded the matter as too serious to do so until I had received your instructions. I wished however, to know who was responsible. Feroughi replied that he thought that the company was mainly responsible, having, over a considerable period of time shown no disposition to meet the legitimate wishes and aspirations of^be Persian Government. ^ I told his Highness that I ” would examine recent discussions between representatives of ^^^“Xltion the company, he would inevitably realise that there was ' tha? for his statement. I begged him to go into the matter caiefl \ 1 ^ h matter when I received my instructions, he might be in a posi ion , t with me. I invited his particular attention to the fact that it was jess thanten days ago that the Minister of Finance had definitely moime • renlv was on the point of making formal proposals. His Hig ness s ^ that, as the Persian Government had signified their readiness c . 0 p I \ cl ^ d ' a b t e ieS ^ concession, the situation was not really so serious as I r ®P r ^ , i demanded replied that that argument could be used in defending the 00 P . , , , when with threats of force the surrender of a man s pocket-boo h u w hat it had been handed over, he would be prepared to discuss wi proportion of its contents he would restore. , dooision 5. I then asked his Highness again who was responsible and when it was taken. He replied that it was taken by e when I shortly before his return. I reminded his Highness that, a Y h ®w Vll deti7e that presented my credentials, His Majesty had expressed very c ea y f r i en dship. Anglo-Persian relations should be established on a fiim • desire Throughout my time here I had acted on the belief that this was c a Tyr a 4 es f V ’g and in this belief I had exerted myself to the utmost to induce for J w pj c i 1 Government to continue friendly negotiations in spite of e b • t y. at there was no justification on the subject of Hen jam, the on y ^ abroad within a day or two of the return of the Minister for iustifica- the Persian Government had taken a decision for which J dier , • tbe tion, either from the legal or moral aspect. Was I expected to relations opinion of the Persian Government, the matter had no bearing ^ om rekt , or had his Department, in fact, been consulted ? Feroughi not know. He went on to express regret that an agreement had be en re a che (it was not clear whether he meant in respect of the genera ie g or of the affairs of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company), and he went on to say it [663 u—3]the greatest pity that circumstances had rendered it impossible for you to H' our relations with him at Geneva. I replied that I did not think he had a t? 8 to regret on that score, as, had such a conversation taken place, subsequent^ would only have made him ridiculous in the same manner as they had I went on to say that matters had, if possible, been aggravated by the man 6 ^ which the Persian Government had trumpeted their action abroad and public rejoicings in the form of the decoration of the town and the illuminaf ^ which I understood had been ordered for that night. Feroughi assured me al ' with emotion, that no such orders had been given. ’ most 6. A messenger then came in to say that another foreign Minister had h waiting some considerable time to keep an appointment. I therefore took mv le after Feroughi had once again expressed the hope that a friendly settlement would be speedily reached and his reliance on my good offices, to which I replied that the action of the Persian Government made it impossible for me to advise His Majesty’s Government to be conciliatory. 7. Almost immediately after the interview Mr. Jacks telephoned to tell me that the police were removing or defacing the signboards of the company. As I reported by telegram, I immediately rang up Feroughi and demanded that immediate action be taken to put a stop to this. He lost no time in getting into communication with the chief of police, who within two hours had notified the company that he was taking the necessary steps to prevent anything of the sort I subsequently learnt from Mr. Jacks that the report had been somewhat exaggerated, and that there had only been one case in which the police had given orders for the removal of a signboard. 8. With regard to the public rejoicings, the town was brilliantly illuminated and decorated, if allowance be made for the limited resources at the disposal of the population. The method employed to ensure a satisfactory measure of public enthusiasm was house-to-house visits by the police. My chauffeur was actually in a shop when such a visit took place, and I also have first hand evidence on the point from Mr. Aratoon, the Legation dispenser, who owns a chemist’s shop near by, and other sources. The occasion has been, moreover, marked by orders to all cinemas that for three days the public are to be admitted free of all charge. The spontaneous and unofficial nature of the rejoicings has been delicately emphasised by the fact that all public buildings have been left severely undecorated. The fact that the first snow-storm of the year rather marred the celebrations is, I believe, regarded as mildly ominous among some sections of the populace. 9. A curious, and I suppose characteristic, aspect of the situation is that it is, for the moment, widely believed among educated Persians that the cancella tion of the concession is a deliberate piece of play-acting, the theory being that a new agreement favourable to Persia, but prolonging the concession, has already been signed, and that the apparently high-handed action of the Persian Govern ment is simply designed to ensure the smooth passage of the new agreement through the Majlis. 10. I learn that Dr. Friedlieb, a highly intelligent American Jew, nowhere in connexion with the proposed export monopoly, holds similar views, his variant being that an agreement has been reached on the basis of a 24 per cent, royalty, and that the cancellation of the concession was accepted by the directors °f the company as the simplest means of ensuring the acquiescence of the shareholdeis in this diminution of their profits. 11. Mr. Jacks has learnt from the Administrator-General of Customs that the latter at once asked the Minister of Finance what attitude the customs authorities should adopt, as a result of the cancellation of the concession, towai s such questions as to the duty-free importation of the company s stores. e answer was that everything was to go on exactly as before. , 12.

His letter denied that the company had ever violated the terms of the D Arcy Concession, and declared that the company could not recognise the right of the Persian Government to cancel that concession. It also dealt with the argument that the concession was invalid because it was granted prior to the establishment of the Constitution, and refuted the accusation that the company had never taken any steps to meet the views of the Persian Government on the subject of revision. It ended by expressing the hope that the Persian Government would immediately withdraw their announcement. 2. The Minister of Finance replied on the 1st December in a brier letter stating that the Persian Government did not accept any of the company s declarations or explanations and that the cancellation of the concession remained 3. On the previous day, the 30th November, the Minister of Finance had informed Mr. Jacks that on account of the cancellation of the concession the post of Imperial Commissioner had been abolished and the services of Murza issa Khan Faiz dispensed with. Mirza Mustapha Khan Fateh, the head ol the marketing organisation of the company in Tehran, subsequently took the mis i of Finance privately to task for this callous treatment of his representative. Taqizadeh explained that, as soon as the cancellation had been announce , e Persian Government had sent instructions to Eissa Khan to return to er f 1 ^: Eissa Khan had replied flatly declining to do so, and the Government had therefore had no alternative but to dismiss him. 4 .

He had yesterday morning and had dehnitely gained the impression that the 1 p- 111 must really be behind the Government's action. That impression was stre a?}! ians by a visitor who came to see him yesterday. At any rate he wished me various points which led him to believe that Russian influence was at worlf 6 ^ (1) In Taghi Zadeh's speech mention was made of the principle that two persons make a contract, one being weak, and that person subset i becomes stronger, the former engagement is not binding upon him This 1 ^ Bolshevik doctrine. ’ Was a (2) In Muhtashim-us-Saltaneh s speech, at the end, a hint was plainly ' (“ the Government will have to perform its duty at the right time ”) that tlT’ 11 was an intention to give the concession to some other company (presumably t t? highest bidder). ' .r °tne (3) In Fahimi’s speech the ignorance and indifference of the Government thirty-two years ago were stressed—the same point as mentioned under (1) above (4) In Dashti’s speech (though the speaker was well known for pro-Russian sympathies) details were given of the treatment of the pro-Bolshevik discontent in the oilfields three years ago, which gave ground for thinking that the information was derived from the Russians. Mention is also made of the fact that ‘ ‘ all revolutionary Governments in the world have abrogated all of the agreements and contracts signed and concluded by their predecessors, and Persia has to follow the lead, for no nation should be compelled to starve.” This has the true Bolshevik flavour. (5) Rahnema gives a number of details (such as the story of the priest who stole the D’Arcy Concession), which his Highness knew must be derived from Bolshevik sources. Vossuk also alluded to the blow which recent arrangements made by Sir John Cadman, Sir W. Deterding, and other oil magnates concerning price policy and control of supplies had dealt to the Russian oil interests. His Highness also mentioned the well-known avarice of the Shah, and the political bias of Teymourtache towards Russia. It would be easy for the Russians to come to an understanding with Teymourtache and to use him as their inter mediary with His Majesty. Vossuk therefore thought that everything pointed to the following The Russians had put it into the Shah’s head that the British Government were finished, would not pay their debts, and could not strike a blow in their own defence. The Shah would readily believe that from recent history. They had then suggested the cancellation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s Concession and the eventual formation of a mixed company similar to the fisheries organisa tion in the north, the Persians to supply the land, foreigners the capital and expert assistance, the net proceeds being divided equally. The Shah would receive a large sum of cash and also a suitable number of shares in the new concern. Perhaps he was wrong, but that was how he interpreted the situation. He, of course, deplored the whole matter, and was aghast at the bad effect which the cancellation would have on Persia's credit. In the circumstances the only thing which the British Government could do woujd be to maintain their rights first ot all by all possible peaceful means, and if these failed, to protect their oil by force- That would very likely mean the end of the present regime, but the new cou n be much worse than the present. It might not mean the disintegration o e country; the Shah was very clever and might still keep his throne. His Highness mentioned on several occasions the story that the Anglo-rersi Oil ( ompany had themselves engineered the cancellation, having prcviou ) signed a new agreement; on my assuring him that this was not so he said t a story must have originated through people being unable to believe that the er Government would take such a step on its own initiative. This brought nun to his original argument. . ^ 1 thanked Vossuk for his friendly communication and said ^ ] communicate it to His Majesty’s Minister, who I knew T would be very &amp;IV ., He said that in truth he always has been, and remains, a friend of the but he was a friend of Persia first of all.t) la d read them ‘■he Russians strengthened me to note the work. plo that when T\ subsequently • This was a r TT 1 mpntioned that he had that morning received a telegram from a stock- Hea Tnndon called Lockner (?) with whom his Highness had had some broker m a yisit to England: Lockner said that he hoped Vossuk could dealings am S ^ concession for a g roup i n the city which he represented. ffifflighness looked upon Lockner as a crook, and was taking no notice of ^the wire.

The circumstances which have given rise to the dispute between the Imperial Government of Persia and themselves, which His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom have found it necessary to bring before the Council under Article 15, are as follows: 2. By an agreement signed at Tehran on May 28th,1901 (see Annex:), the Government of His Im perial Majesty the Shah of Persia granted to William Knox D'Arcy, a British subject, a con cession for the special and exclusive right to prospect for, exploit and sell oil and other substances within the whole territory of the Persian Empire, with the exception of five named provinces. The concession, which was signed by His Imperial Majesty the then reigning Shah of Persia, signed and sealed by His Prime Minister and counter-sealed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Mines, was granted for a period of sixty years from the date of the agreement, i.e. up to May 1961. 3. Under the concession (Article 9) the concessionnairc was authorised to constitute one or more companies for the exploitation of the concession. Accordingly, the 'First Exploi tation Company', a company constituted under the law of England with its registered office in London, was registered on the 21st May 1903, anc i } oil having been first discovered2 . in commercial quantities in the concession area in 1908, the Anglo-Fersian Oil Company,Ltd,, a company constituted under the lav/ of England,and having its registered office in London,v/as form ed for the purpose of taking over the concession and assuming all the rights and obligations of the concessionnaire thereunder. The Angla- Persian Oil Company was registered on April 14th, 1909,and the concession and all the rights and obligations of the concessionnaire thereunder were duly transferred to it. Accordingly,the Anglo^Persian Oil Company is and has been since 1909 the holder of the concession granted in 1901, and has been recognised as such by all successive Persian Governments. 4. Mr. D’Arcy and his associates spent some seven years prospecting the territory covered by the concession, and expended thereon some hundreds of thousands of pounds before the existence of oil in commercial quantities wan proved. The Persian Government was not asked to take and in fact did not take any part of the risk involved in thus proving and developing the oil resources of Persia, and has at no time furnished any part of the capital required. 5. Production of Persian oil on a commer cial scale began in 1912, and since then the Com pany has conducted extensive operations in Persia under the concession. In accordance with Article 10 of the concession,under which the Persian Government was to receive (in addition to certain sums in cash and shares, which have beenbeen duly paid) siztpen per cent, on the annual net profits of any companies formed to work the concession, large sums have been paid to that Government by the Company. The sums paid to the Persian Government up to December 31st. 1931, amount to over eleven million pounds sterling. 6* ±he concession contains no provision for its termination 'bsfore the end of the period of sixty years for which it was granted* except Article 16, under which the concession was to become null and void if within two years from the date of the concession no com pany had been formed in accordance with its terms for the purpose of working it. Tha 'First Exploitation Company' having been duly formed, as stated above, within this period of two years, the provjsion in question ceased to have effect as from the date on which that Com pany was formed. 7. Under Article 17 of the concession, any dispute or difference between the parties thereto in respect of its interpretation or the The amounts (to the nearest thousand pounds) of the royalties actually paid by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to the Persian Gove ment have been as follows:- For the period 1913 to 1919, an aggregate sum of £1.326,000.

The decision of the arbitrators, or of the third arbitrator in the event of the two arbitrators appointed by the parties failing to agree, was to be final. &amp;• it is a matter of common knowledge that in the year 1914 His Majesty's Government, with the object of ensuring the oil supplies of the British navy, acquired a considerable interest in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, which interest they still retain. This statement is made fer the sake of completeness; His Majesty's Govern ment are bringing the present dispute before the Council not in the capacity of shareholders in the Company, hut as the Government of a state which has thought it necessary to take up the case of one of its nationals whose interests have teen injured hy acts contrary to international law committed hy another State* 9. While Article 10 of the concession provided that there was to he paid to the Persian Government annually a sum equal to sixteen per cent, of the annual net profits of any company or companies that might he formed in accordance with the berms of the concession to operate the same. it did not attempt to define the 'basis on which the annual4*0) annual net proi'its of any such company were to he arrived at in calculating the Persian Government’s royalty. It is obvious that the phrase 'net profits' is open to various interpretations* and when, after some fifteen year’s work on the con cession, profits wer^ first derived from it, questions soon arose between the Persian Government and the Company as to the manner in which the '‘.not profits' on which thv Persian Government was to receive its sixteen per cent, ought to be calculated That such questions should have arisen was not a matter for surprise, having regard, on the one hand, to the lack of precise definition within tho body of the D’Arcy concession agreement, and, on the other, to the steady expansion in ail directions of the Company’s business relations and to the inevitably increasing complexity of its financial and a c c cunt in g arrangem on t s 0 10. After lengthy but unfruitful negotia tions the Persian Government formally appointed, in August, 1920, the late Sir Sydney Aimltago-Smith- then its financial Advisor- as its representative to ad jus *0 finally all questions in dispute between the Persian Government and tho Company, eithtor by an amica b 1 c arran g omen t*, or , if that wore not possible, by arbitra tion, The Persian Government’s representativeL \ 6* represor.t vtive was assisted in his negotiations by irmSof|emj.nent)chartered accountants and lawye in Gneout iSmtaan® 11 0 A change of Ministry in Persia took place shortly after the appointment of the Government's representative, and the new Ministry confirmed hi authority to continue negotiations with the Company 12. The Company met the Persian Government's representative, both parties having the assistance of legal and accountancy advisers, and on the 22nd December, 1920, an agreement was signed on behalf of the Persian Government and of the Company, setting out the basis upon which the Company's profits were to bo calculated for the fuoure in ascertaining the royalty to do paid to the Peisian Government under Article 10 of the D’Arcy conces sion. At the same time, a collateral agreement was signed between the Persian Government's repre- sentative and the Chairman of the Company oy v/hicn the Company agreed to pay to One Persian Governm ,—vj in final settlement of the outstanding question^ between the Government and the Company sum o^ £1,000,000 sterling. This settlement covered all claims of the Persian Government in respect of. un paid royalties up to March 31st, 1^13, 13. Since that date the royalty to be paid to the Persian Government has been ascertained m accordance with the terms of this agieenent. 14 o prom 1.920 till about 1928 the arrangements provided in the 1920 Agreement substantially served the purposes for which they wen., designedo oa &gt;7. designee., and the royalties payable by the Company to the Persian Government in accordance with the D'Arcy concession, as interpreted by the 1920 Agree ment, were checked each year on behalf of the Persian Government by eminent chartered accountants in Great Britain. Some differences of interpreta tion again arose, but most of them were from time to time adjusted between the accountants of the two parties, and the royalties were accepted by the Peisian Government without prejudice to those differences which had not proved susceptible of adjustment by the accountants. In 1929 the Company's representatives went to Tenran, at the instance of the Persian jrovernmeno, bo conduct negotiations for a revision of tne concession. These negotiations however did not result in an agreement, 16. In 1931 fresh negotiations were opened -i.cr a revision of the basis upon which the 'net profits' of the Comoany were to be ascertained for the purpose of calculating the royalty payable to the Persian Government, and early in 1952 a preliminary agreement was arrived at between His Highness Teymourtache, Minister of Court, on behalf of the Persian Government, and sir John Cadman, the Chairman of the Company, setting out certain principles which had been agreed between •Hiem on this subject as the result of prolonged negotiations. This preliminary royalty agreement Wa ' s a Pproved by the Cornell of Ministers in Tehran in February, 1932, 17* It was understood by both parties that hls document was to be submitted to their respect- ~ne lawyers and accountants, who would discuss a nd draw U p a more formal agreement * * aww.uwaao feioxj.xi.uio one iijanner in which the royalty payment to the Perm latccl in the nature lan Government was to he calcu- , xii order to avoid,ii possible further on this differences of opinion between the parties point. The formulation of so detailed an agreement, in conformity with principles already agreed,and its correct rendering in the Trench language } which was to 'prevail',was a task involv ing a considerable expenditure of time. 1G. The lawyers and accountants,as the result of some months' work,eventually produced a formal draft royalty agreement which,subject to certain modifications - mainly in favour of the Persian Government .and included at the request of its representative *- gave effect in thoir opinion to the general principles which had boon agreed between tho Persian Government's representative and the Chairman of the Company. This draft was initialled in London on behalf of the Company and cy the Persian Governments representative, (hirza Kissa Khan,the Persian Imperial Commissioner appointed under Article 11 of the concession)on the advice of thoir lawyers and accountants,and was transmitted to Tehran,where it arrived on the 29th may, 1932,for formal ratification by the Persian Government,which has not yet been accorded. 19. On the 3rd June 1932 the Company's accounts for the year 1931 had been completed and,as is customary,tho provisional royalty figures thus ascertained were cabled to Tehran. It should be noted that the figures for royalty in the published accounts are provisional as they cannot be absolutely determined/determined at the relatively early date when the Company* accounts are published. Furthermore, under the terms of the 1920 Agreement, tho Persian Government is entitled to examine tho accounts and within an interval of six mantis to challongo any points in the statement of royalties with which it is not in agreement. Until tho current year this procedure has boen followed and the Persian Government has in fact regularly exercised this right. 20. On the Gth Juno the Resident Director reported that the Persian Government had protested regarding the smallness of the provisional royalty figures for the year 1931 (£306,872 as compared with £1,288,312 in 1930), and had requested that its representatives should have full facilities to examine tho figures. This was at once agreed. Those facilities have always existed and have consistently boon exorcised by tho Persian Government representatives. Both the Minister of Court and the Finance Minister had boen previously warned that owing to the depression in the oil industry,the amount of the royalty for 1931 was bound to be far below that of earlier and more prosperous years. 21. About the same time tho Persian Government informed the Company that it considered the initialled agreement, referred to in paragraph 18 above, which had been received on the 29th May, needed further interpretation and editing in more comprehensible language,and requested the Company to send authorised representatives and experts to Tehran in order uo explain the draft and to resellt it° Company replied that it, was impossible for the legal/—legc..l or chief ?.ccount&gt;aiLcy advisers of the Company to go to Persia at the moment, and sugges ted that the Persian Government should send its representatives to Loudon for a full explanation, since the le^al and accountancy advisers of both parties were ava. lable there, as well as all the necasoaxy data# Meanwhile steps were taken to nave, the trench text of the agreement re-edited by the legal adviser of the Company in Tehran for the assistance of The Persian Government. 22# On the 29th June the Persian Government refused to accept the royalty for 1931 payable to it under the terms of the existing agreements, and on the 7th July the Company learnt from iehran that the draft royalty agreement was still under examination, but that tentative pro posals to the Company on an entirely different basis were under consideration. The Company's representative in Tear an was subsequently informed that the Persian ministers concerned were pre paring a new set of proposals for discussion with the Company, and nn the 16th November the Minister of Finance informed the Company's representative in Tehran that these proposals were almost com plete. No such proposals have, however, in fact 'been communicated to the Company by the Persian Government. 23. At this stage, therefore, the situation was that early in the present year a preliminary agreement for modifying the existing basis (i.e. that resulting from the agreement of 1920) on which the royalty payable to the Persian Govern ment was to be calculated had been arrived at between the Persian Government and the Company and had been approved by the • • •11 . the Persian Council oi hiinistersj that the lorinal acreo- merit,which was to give effect to this preliminary agree ment ,had. 'been negooiated. and. initialled, 'by representative of the parties and had for some months been under con sideration by the Persian Government. The Persian Government, who appeared to be dissatisfied with the proposed agreement,had not in fact made any alternative proposals to the Company, though it had informed the Company’s representative at Tehran that such proposals were in course of preparation* The Company would have been perfectly prepared to consider such proposals on receiving them. moreover, should it have ultimately proved Impossible for the Persian Government and the Company to come to an agreement, any claims by the Government against the Company could and should have been submitted to arbitration in accordance with Article 17 of the concession. 24. The Persian Government, however, preferred to adopt another course. On November 27th, 1932, the Persian Minister of Finance delivered the following communication to the Resident Director in Tehran of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company r' 1 'The Anglo-Porsian oil Company has been re~ . peatedly informed by the Persian Government that the D’Arcy Concession of 1901 does not protect the interests of the Persian Government and that it is necessary to place relations between the Imperial Persian Government and the Company on a new basis ^ whi£h_ r-irt of all communications from the Persian Govern- quoted in this memorandum is the English translation received in London by telegraph.'has cancelled the D'Arcy Concession and wil1 cons Wer it void. At the: eane time as the Persian Government has no other intention except to safeguard Persian interests, should the Anglo-Persian Oil Company he prepared contrary to the past uO saleguard Persian interests, in accordance with the views of the Persian Government, on the basis of equity and justice, with the necessary security for safeguarding those interests, the Persian Government will not in principle refuse to grant a new concession to that Company'. 25. On November 28th, 1932, the Resident Directr- or in Tehran of the Company sent the following r °ply Po the above communication: 'I have by telegram submitted to the Directors oi the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in London the text of Your Excellency^ letter dated 27th November. I am instruct ed respectfully to inform Your Excellency that the Company does not admit that the terms of the D !

You will understand that the Company cannot recognise the right claimed hy the Persian Government to can cel the Agreement, such contention having no founda tion either in law or in equity. I am instructed to remind Your Excellency than, relying upon the good faith of the Persian Government and the rights con ferred upon the Company hy the Concession, the Com pany has expended in Persia many millions of pounds sterling. The benefits received hy the Persian Government from this expenditure ermot he ignored in considering whether the terms of the Concession are fair to the Government, nor can they he ignored in any discussions between the Government end the Company which are to he based on equity and jUboice. The Company takes the strongest exception to the statements in Your Excellency’s leu ter thao uLe Company has failed to take into consideration the needs of the time and the present position of the Persian Government. The Company has at all rimes shown itself willing hy friendly negotiatioub to endeavour to meet the views and tne ne.ds of the Persian Government, and so far as accord hdo been reached the failure has certainly not ^ een ^- ae to any want of effort or goodwill on the parm of the Company. The Company must point out that the publication of the Government announcement in Yne Press will have most damag;ing repercussion^ on the Company’s business, and the Directors venture to hope that on further consideration one Government will immediately withdraw this announcemeno. 26 # • •15. 26. On November 30th or December 1st 1932, the Minister of Finance replied in the following terms: 'In reply to your letter of the 29th November, I deem it necessary to state that the Persian Government does not admit the statements and reasons as mentioned in the said letter and considers itself entitled with sufficient reasons to cancel the D l Arcy Ccncession and that it remains its final decision which has been communicated under this Ministry f s letter of 27th November'. 21% On being informed of this situation by His Majesty's Minister at Tehran, His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom thought it necessary to take up the case in exercise of their rights to protect a British national when injured by acts contrary to International Law, committed by another State, and to ensure in the person of their nationals respect for the rules of International Law. Accordingly, on December 2nd 1932, His Majesty's Minister at Tehran presented the following note to the Persian Government: M (l) His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom have taken cognisance of the terms of the letter addressed !y the Minister of Finance to the Resident Director of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company on the 27th November. His Majesty's Government consider the action of the Persian Government in cancelling the Company's concession to be an inadmissible breach of its terms; they take a most serious view of the conduct of the Persian Government, and 'have instructed me t® demand the immediate withdrawal of the notification issued to the Company. '(^) Furthermore, I am directed to state that, while His Majesty's Government still hope that the Persian Government will be at pains to roach an amic- abl e settlement in direct negotiation with the Company, bis Majesty's Government will not hesitate, if the necessity arises/16 c to take all legitimate measures to t 'arises, to take all legitimate measures to protect their just and indisputable interests. '(5) Finally I have the honour to state that His Majesty's Government will not tolerate any damage to the Company ! s interests or inter ference with their premises or business activities in Persia.' 28, On December 3rd, 1932, the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs replied to this note in the following terms: H In reply to your respected Note of the 2nd December, I have the honour to state: '(1) The Persian Government regards itself as within its rights in cancelling the D* Arcy concession and does not agree to withdraw the Note of the Minister of Finance to Mr* Jacks, the Director of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, announ cing the cancellation of the concession. The Imperial Persian Government is of opinion that for some time past it has been entitled to take steps to cancel the D’Arcy concession and for a lo-'g time past the Persian Government has repeatedly pointed out the fact that the stipulations oi the ab o v e - rnent i oned c one css ion are not in ac c o rd w ith the legitimate interests of Persia, and that it has not been satisfied with the situation arising from the aoove-mentioned concession and with the conduct of the Anglo -^Persian Oil Company; tut, in the 0 cj 17.

Mr. RHYS DAVIES asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs the reasons given by the Persian Govern ment for cancelling its agreement with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company ? The UNDER-SECRETARY of STATE for FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Mr. Eden): The reasons given by the Persian Govern ment for cancelling the concession were contained in their letter of the 27th November, in which they notified the company’s representative at Tehran of the cancellation. The text of this letter and that of the company’s reply appeared in the Press on the 7th December. A statement of the Persian Government's case has also been issued by the Persian Legation, and this appeared in the Press on the 2nd December. Mr. DAVIES: Can the hon.

I invited His Excellency to look at recent events through our eyes. We knew Minister of Court had reached settlement of various points in London lost winter and subsequent to fate of that settlement, that Minister of Court had suggested 2i million pounds should be minimum figure of royalty and that only about a week before notice of cancellation was received Minister of Finance had informed Mr. Jacks that he was about to make comprehensive proposals to company.

H 5508/3880/34] No. 1. Sir John Cadman to Foreign Office.—(Received October 21.) gi r London, October 19, 1932. A VERY difficult situation having been reached in respect to the relations between the Persian Government and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, I consider it necessary to acquaint you with the present position, and with the circumstances which have led up to it. • •2. The Foreign Office is already aware that, from the early days of the company's existence as a commercial profit-earning concern, differences of opinion arose between the company and the Persian Government with respect to the interpretation of the phrase “ 16 per cent, of the annual net profits,” which defines the company’s royalty obligations to the Persian Government under the terms of the D’Arcy Concession. 3. That such differences should have arisen was not a matter for surprise, having regard, on the one hand, to the lack of more precise definition within the body of the D’Arcy Concession Agreement, and, on the other, to the steady expansion in all directions of the company's business relations and to the inevitably increasing complexity of its financial and accounting arrangements. 4. It was mutually agreed, as far back as 1919, that such a state of affairs, if allowed to continue, would become increasingly embarrassing to both parties to the concession, and the Persian Government therefore deputed Mr. (now Sir) Sydney Armitage-Smith—then their financial adviser—to proceed to England, and, with the assistance of expert advisers, to negotiate a subsidiary agreement with the company, which should regulate the royalty matters then in dispute, and thereafter constitute a basis for the regulation and settlement of the annual royalty payments. 5. Prolonged discussions took place in 1920 between Sir S. Armitage-Smith. aided by Mr. (now Sir) William McLintock on the one hand, and the company s representatives on the other which eventually resulted in an agreement, since known as the Armitage-Smith Agreement, being duly concluded and signed on the 22nd December, 1920. 6. The memorandum attached to this letter gives the most relevant and salient points of—. (a) Events leading up to, concurrent with, and immediately subsequent to the negotiations. (b) Powers entrusted to the negotiators. (c) The agreement itself. 7 Since the agreement was signed and until a few years back, the agree ment substantially served the purpose for which it had been designed. It must, however, be admitted that the ever-increasing volume and ramifications of the company’s business since 1920 led to occasional differences of opinion between the accounting advisers of the Persian Government and the company as to the correct application of the terms of the agreement. These, however, were generally settled by agreement, a relatively small number of disputed points being reserved 111 the hope that they might all be disposed of en bloc by discussion and settle ment between the Government and the company at a convenient and suitable time. 8- It is relevant to mention at this stage that in 1928, the view was expressed J Persian Imperial Commissioner (his Excellency Eissa Khan Fayz) that e ^ rm itage-Smith Agreement was invalid on the grounds that (a) It bad not received the sanction of the Majlis, and (b) The Government representative had exceeded his powers. ‘dmilar views have since been expressed by the Minister of Court (his ^ghness I eymourtache), but there has as yet been no formal denunciation, nor ' definite official statement by the Persian Government to any similar effect. [607 x—1 ] * bI need hardly say that my company has in no way accepted such a contention Indeed, had it been formally made, the company would have had no option hnt to contest the matter before the competent legal authorities. ut 9. Such was the situation in 1928 when—there being other important but less contentious questions needing settlement with the Persian authorities— a series of discussions took place between his Highness the Minister of Conn anc ! '\ myself in London, Lausanne and—later—Tehran. These discussions eventualh led in the direction of negotiations for a new form of concession designed, on the one hand, to admit of a shareholding participation of the Government in the •company’s operations and profits, and, on the other, to secure to the company a considerable extension of the concessionary period which, under the existing concession, expires in 1961. 10. Considerable progress was made in drafting a new Concessionary Agreement, which, in form and largely in substance, might have proved satis factory to both sides. In the final stage, however, when the actual extent of participation came under review, it became quite impossible to reconcile the demands of the Government with those which, though actuated with the strongest desire to come to a generous and lasting settlement, I found it possible to concede on the part of the company. The large royalties which were at that time accruing to the Persian Government owing to the favourable market conditions, had whetted its appetite for more, and—in substance—its new claims were based on a series of formulae calculated, under conditions of commercial prosperity such as were then existing, to give it a much larger maximum whilst securing to it an excessively high minimum, however adverse future trading conditions might become. 11. Finding it impossible to induce the Government authorities to take a more practical view of the matters at issue, I left Tehran in April 1929, not without hope that time and reflection would bring them to a more reasonable state of mind, the more so as the Minister of Court gave me to understand that he would again consider the matter and put forward new proposals. 12. No new proposals, however, were put forward, nor was any further progress made until the autumn of 1931, when, at the instance of the Minister of Court, prolonged discussions took place with him in London and Paris, with the double object of coming to a new agreement which should take the place of the Armitage-Smith Agreement, and of settling the accrued differences in respect to royalty payments between 1920 and 1930. Since the views already expressed by his Highness Teymourtache and the Imperial Commissioner had made the actual question of the validity of the Armitage-Smith Agreement a contentious matter, it was agreed on both sides to conduct the negotiations with as little reference to that agreement as possible—and, so far as it proved possible, this was done. 13. These particular negotiations, which also covered the newly-raised question of income tax, were successfully concluded, a draft agreement was drawn up, which it was the intention to make operative from the 1st January, 1932, and a further agreement was made with respect to settling the accrued differences to which I have already referred. The agreement was subject to the principles enunciated therein being put into proper legal and accounting form by the advisers of the two parties, and, thereafter, to the approval of the Majlis. 14. Unfortunately, before these final stages had been attained, the annual general meeting of the company took place (June 1932), and the amount of royalty for 1931 was thereupon notified to the Persian Government. Owing to depression in the oil industry the amount was naturally far below that of earlier and moie prosperous years. Warning of this had been given to the Minister of Com during the negotiations above referred to in London, and also both to him anc the Finance Minister by our resident director in Tehran. No actual figure was mentioned, but it was stated that the royalty would certainly not exceed FaOOl as a matter of fact, it ultimately worked out at approximately £307,000, as compared with £1,288,312 of the previous year. , 15. In spite of the warning given, this announcement evoked strong p 10 eh by the Persian Government, and led to invidious and misleading compai isorn between the share of the Persian Government by way of royalty and that o 1 British Government by way of income-tax and dividends. In violent pre^ al ? parliamentary propaganda, obviously inspired by the Persian Government, company has been publicly accused of falsifying its accounts and wi 11 )3 j f. uding the Persian Treasury. The new Royalty Agreement referred to h - 3 has been completely shelved, in face of what is termed “ public opinion,'' a Hthe Persian Government has actually officially refused acceptance of the aI1 unt of royalty due to it, on the ground that it is non-acceptable owing to its ^deanacy. The company has invited the closest scrutiny of its accounts by the ina Vt advisers of the Government, but the invitation has not been accepted. ig y[ Y Jacks, the resident director in Tehran, in the course of recent sations, both with the Minister of Court and the Finance Minister, has C °thered that new proposals are under contemplation, and will shortly be put f ward in respect to the Government's concessionary relations with the company. Proposals of this character were promised several weeks ago, but have not so far matured ^ ^ mean tinie, my board view with much concern the fact that inspired statements have appeared in the Persian press, not merely hinting at, but aetuallv endeavouring to justify, immediate Government action in the direction of a forced revision of the concession, or, inuoed, of its entire cancellation. My board take particular exception to a pronouncement—apparently official—by the Persian Legation in Berlin, of which a translation is attached. I do not, at this sta^e' propose to deal with the many travesties and misrepresentations of facts and events which characterise this and other published accounts, whether officially inspired or not, but it will be appreciated that the attitude adopted by the Persian Government is far from indicating any real disposition to discuss its past differences, or its ambitions for the future, in a just and reasonable manner. I have judged it advisable to submit this account of the impasse at which this company has arrived in its relations with the Persian Government, and of the events which have led up to it, since any “ proposals ” which that Government, as at present advised, is likely to put forward to the company, will not improbably be both impracticable in character and peremptory in tone, in which case a situation may well arise in which this company although most anxious to avoid doing so—may find itself under the necessity of seeking the aid and intervention of His Majestv's Government. T have, &amp;c. JOHN CABMAN. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Note on Armitage-Smith Agreement. IN virtue of the terms of the D'Arcy Concession (which w as granted by the Persian Government to the late Mr. D’Arcy in May 1901), the concession ^ was authorised to found one or several companies for the exp ox a 1( ? n ° , concession. While such company or companies were to enjoy al e rl £ privileges enjoyed by the concessionnaire, they were also to assume ^ engagements and responsibilities. All such companies were, in ei m, 1 • the said (i.e., Persian) Government annually a sum equal to P er c f ' , • annual net profits of any company or companies that might e accordance with the provisions of the concession . , , • 10n q The “ First Exploitation Company ” so formed was registered in ^ In 1908 oil was first discovered in commercial quantities ,n a«a, and in 1909 the Anglo-Persian Oil Company was formed for the purpose of taking over the concession and assuming all the rights t Production of Persian oil on a commercial scale began m 1912, and m 1913 the first royalty to the Persian Government was paid. of its The company thereafter very considerably extended the sphere ot its operations, not only in Persia, but elsewhere. Apart from the exploitation organisation, which' it built up in Persia, it created a tl net ^b n vL Toncelsions distributing centres throughout the world. Subsequen y, comnlications 'i countries other than Persia were acquired. As a result of the complications [607 x—1] B 24 in the calculation of the net profits of the company arising- from this oreat extension of its activities, differences of opinion as to the correct interpretation of the term “ 16 per cent, of the annual net profits ” began to arise between the Persian Government and the company. By 1919 these differences had reached an acute stage, and formed the subject of discussions in London between the then Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs (Firuz Mirza) and Mr. (now Sir) William McLintock, on the one hand, and the company's representatives on the other ^ These discussions continued into the summer of 1920, but no final agreement could be reached. The Persian Government thereupon decided to entrust the negotiations to Mr. (now Sir) S. A. Armitage-Smith, who was at that time acting as its financial adviser. The instructions to Mr. Armitage-Smith, which were issued by the Persian Ministry of Finance, on the 29th August, 1920, ran as follows :— “ Monsieur, “ J’ai Fhonneur de vous notifier que par la presente vous etes nomme comme representant du Gouvernement imperial pour regler definitivement toutes les questions en litige entre the Anglo-Persian Oil Company et le Gouvernement imperial de Perse. “ Dans le cas oil vous jugerez qu'un accord amical sur toutes les questions pendantes, de nature a satisfaire entierement aux droits et aux interets de la Perse, ne soit possible, vous avez Fautorisation d'avoir recours a Farbitrage au sujet des revendications du Gouvernement imperial contre la compagnie et d'admettre egalement ce meme precede, si ladite compagnie en exprime le desir, concernant ses propres revendications. “ Pour le Ministre des Finances, “ Le Sous-Secretaire d'Ftat, “ Eissay.' ’ Mr. Armitage-Smith's understanding of the powers delegated to him is evidenced by the following extract from his report to the Persian Government “ It ' (i.e., the agreement) does not require or admit of formal approval or ratification, for, under the powers which the Government did me the honour to entrust to me, it is binding. At the same time, it is a source of satisfaction for me to know that the brief resume which I cabled to Tehran met with your Highness's approval, and I venture to suggest that it might conceivably be in the public interest and a copy of this report might be submitted for the information of a specially appointed financial committee of the Majlis, in order that the situation may be generally appreciated. The discussions between Mr. Armitage-Smith (who was assisted by Mr. McLintock), and the company’s representatives in London, eventually led to the conclusion of two agreements. The first of these agreements settled the differences then existing as to the amount of money which was to be handed o\er by the company to the Persian Government in complete satisfaction of the latter s claims for adjustments in its favour of the royalty payments up to the 31st March, 1919. The agreed sum was accordingly paid by the company, on^ consideration for the payment being the acceptance by the Persian Governmen o the second or a Armitage-Smith ' Agreement. . , The main features of the Armitage-Smith Agreement, which was signed on the 22nd December, 1920, were as follows :— {a) Subject to certain conditions, limitations and exceptions thereinafter mentioned, the Persian Government were to be entitled iecel i| from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company a royalty of 16 per cent. ° n the annual net profits arising from the winning, refining marketing of Persian oil, whether all the stages of the above Pf oc \ c be handled by the company itself, or through subsidiary companies^^ and whether refining and marketing takes place within the e Empire or not.0 (bi The Government v* ns not to receive royalty on the profits arising from transporting oil b\ the company s tankers, but a procedure designed to protect 1 ersian Government interests was agreed for calculatim 1, freight rates. e ° (d The net profits on which rovalty was to be calculated were to be the p'' adjusted profits foi income tax in the T mted Kingdom, subject to the various adjustments embodied in the agreement. (d) In arriving at the net piofits of subsidiary companies (as defined in the agreement), on which the royalty had to be calculated, the company was to be entitled to make certain deductions in the cases of refining and distributing companies (the principle being that the company was entitled to receive a fair return on its capital invested in the said companies). (e) Special provision was made for the calculation of the net profits on Persian oil in cases where a refining or distributing subsidiary company handled oils other than Persian oil. (/) Further, the company undertook in the agreement “ that it will not enter into any fictitious or artificial transactions which would have the effect of reducing the amount of royalty payable.” As mentioned in the covering letter, the Imperial Commissioner (his Excellency Eissa Khan Fayz) first contended in 1928 that the Armitage-Smith Agreement was invalid inasmuch as (so he claimed)— (a) Sir S. Armitage-Smith had exceeded the powers entrusted to him. (b) The agreement had not received the sanction of the Majlis. The company has always claimed, and still claims, that the Armitage-Smith Agreement is valid unless and until replaced by another form of agreement. In respect to the views of the Imperial Commissioner as expressed in 1928, it is of interest to note the following extracts from letters written by him to this company in 1925 :— June 5. “ Pains have been taken to draw up an agreement as a guide alike to us astovou. and onlv bv adhering to it can we work in the best mutual interest. June 22. “ I am most anxious to reach an amicable settlement of all the questions at issue, whilst at the same time firmly maintaining the rights of my Government on every question of principle as laid down in the agreement of the 22nd December, 1920.” July 15. “ My whole desire is to make the agreement the sure foundation of our actions, and so enable us to work in an amicable and businesslike relationship calculated to further our mutual interests to the best advantage.’ Enclosure 2 in Xo. 1.

His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom have had under consideration Your Excellency’s note of December 3 re plying to my note of December 2nd in regard to the Persian Government’s cancellation of the A.P.O.C’s concession. I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that His Majesty’s Govern ment arc unable to admit the validity of a unilateral cancella tion of this concession. Such a- cancellation is a, confiscatory measure and a clear breach of international law committed against a British Company and His Majesty’s Government feel obliged to take the matter up in the exercise of their rights to protect the interests of their nationals. His Majesty’s Government have from the outset, as pointed out in my note of December 2nd, . and as repeated in the statement made by the Under-Secret ary of State for Foreign Affairs in one House oi Commons on December 5th, been anxious that an amicable settle- raent nay be reached between the Persian Government and tne A.B.G.C. His Majesty’s Government cannot, however, regard the Persian Government’s note of December 3, as offering any satis factory basis for such a settlement. As I explained on December His Majesty’s Government consider the action of the Persian Covernrnent in cancelling the concession to be an inadmissible breach,.,breach of the terms of that instrument and have therefore requested fee withdrawal of the notification to the Company on November 27th. Since fee Persian Government in their reply adduce no argument which can be regarded as in any' way justifying their action, His Majesty's Government must reiterate their request, 2. Should the Persian Government be unwilling to with draw feeir notification of cancellation of the concession within one week from the date of fee present note i.e, before midday on Thursday, December 15th, His Majesty's Government will have no alternative to referring fee dispute which has arisen between them and fee Persian Government in regard to fee legality of fee Persian Government's action, •to the Permanent Court of International Justice at The Hague , as a matter of urgency, under fee Optional Clause. In so doing His Majesty's Government would request the Court to indicate, under Article 41 of fee Statute the provisional treasures which ought to be taken to preserve their rights. 3. Further, I am instructed to state feat my Govern*- Kent do not accept fee attitude outlined in paragraph 3 or your note to the effect feat the Persian Government cannot regard themselves as responsible for any' damage accruing to the Company. On the contrary, 1 have fee honour to inform iour Excellency categorically that His Majesty s ^ovexnrmnt win hold fee Persian Government directly responsible for ny damage to the Company's interests, any M'ith thair rirpnii nr frusinGss activities ^ nT ^ wveiio UI any SUCH uauia-Kc ---- . - a ;n government will regard themselves as ex. 0 x.t-.ee. t -.--i s dch measures as the situation may demana foi th.

In Convei’sution outlined in that telegram Minister of Finance made it clear that Shah was entirely responsible and indicated that His Majesty had hardly given a thought to probable British re-action, apparently in the belief, shared by Minister of Finance, tho/t the Company would at once offer to negotiate. (Cr-v a days before His Majesty had expressed hope to Political Resident, Bushire that his relations with officials were cordial while at Ahwaz; he greeted Mr. cacko vatn with him amounts to positive friendliness). 2.

It will be seen that it is a categorical refusal to withdraw their note intimating cancellation of the Concession ana that they are not prepared to accept any responsibility for damage accruing to the Company. They repeat their readiness to enter into direct discussions with the Company with a view to negotiation of a new Concession rt which would safeguard in an equitable manner the rights and interests of Persia.' 1 h. Mr. Hoare, as will be seen from his telegrams 214 and 215, continues to attach importance/ memlinportence to building a bridge over which the Persian Government can retreat. Their latest note gives little justification for any belief that they are prepared to fetreat, at any rate at this stage. The Foreign Office take the line that it is important, in view of our public statements in this country and of the interest aroused here, to maintain a firm attitude and have recommended that, failing a satisfactory reply by the 10th December we should inform the Persians that we proposed to take the case before the Permanent Court, and,failing satisfaction, should be prepared to do so without further delay. 3. as will be seen from to-day* s newspaper cuttings attached^ the publication of the terns of our note in Parliament on Monday has concentrated attention on this question, and it will clearly be difficult to resile from the attitude we have adopted without losing face. Subject to this, there seems great force in the Foreign Office contention that the right course is to exhaust legal remedies before other sanctions are considered. But it seems desirable both to do all we can to secure that tnere is no delay in dealing with the question at the International Court, etc., and further to make our note to the Persians intimating our decision a fairly stiff one, so that uninformed opinion either here or in the middle iitst may not oe in a position to suggest that we have failed to live up to the terms of our original c ommunication*INDIA DIREC'^ With the Compliments OF THE Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.

Dr. Benes, the representative of Czechoslovakia on the Council of the League, was appointed rapporteur and as the result of his good offices an arrangement has been reached, and has been confirmed by the Council, whereby the Anglo-Persian Oil Company are about to enter into direct negotia tions with the Persian Government with a view to a settlement. In the meantime all proceedings before the Council are suspended on the terms that the point of view set out on each side before the Council remains entirely unprejudiced and that, if negotiations fail to produce agreement, the question will again come before the Council for decision. It is further agreed that during the period of the negotiations and until a final settle ment is reached, the work and operations of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company will continue to be carried on as they were carried on before the 27th November, 1932, that is before the Persian Govern ment claimed to cancel the concession.

LANSBURY: I beg to ask leave to move the Adjournment of the House in order to call attention to a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely: “ the declaration of His Majesty’s Govern ment or its intention to take whatever steps it may think fit to protect the interests or the Anglo-Persian Oil Company.” Mr. SPEAKER: The right hon. Gentle man the Leader of the Opposition has asked leave to move the Adjournment of the House in order to call attention to a definite matter of urgent public import ance, namely: the declaration of the Government of its +il' whatever steps it may think fit to protect the interests of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company.” The right hon. Gentleman will realise that, in considering this Motion, I am entirely governed by Standing Order Eo. 10, which lays down that the matters to be discussed on the Adjournment of the House, on a Motion of this kind, must be definite. It seems to me that this Motion does not come within that Stand ing Order, in that its terms are not definite, and therefore I cannot allow it. Mr. LANSBURY: May I submit, Sir, that it is definite owing to the statement that if, in the judgment of His Majesty’s Government, or of our representatives in 1 ersia, to-night, some damage may be threatened, or may take place, His Majesty’s Government would in such circumstances take action which might lead to war. I respectfully submit that it is definite to that extent. Mr. SPEAKER : I can quite understand the point which the right hon. Gentleman is putting to me, but he will realise that I must be governed entirely by the Stand ing Order on this question. The Motion, as he has submitted it, is based on a hypothetical consideration and some action, which is not defined, but which, if certain circumstances arise, the Gov ernment may take. Neither of these could be described as definite matters. In those circumstances, it is impossible or me, if I keep to the Standing Orders to give my consent to this Motion. Mr. LANSBURY: Of course, Mr. Speaker, I am obliged to accept youi decision on that matter, but I think it extremely unfortunate that such a state ment should have been made. BUSINESS Op THE HOUSE.

Hoare's important telegrams No.206 and 207 examine the question of future tactics. This is likely to be very difficult, it is increasingly clear that either/either H.M.G. or the Persi&amp;n Government will have to sacrifice some face in order to reach a compromise and the situation will have been aggravated if the statements in the press that ti at* the Persian Governmentrfeplied to a protest of the Company confirming and refusing to reconsider their action is confirmed.

In Convention outlined in that telegram Minister of Finance made it clear that Shah was entirely responsible and indicated that His Majesty had hardly given a thought to probable British re-action, apparently in the belief, shared by Minister of Finance, that the Company v/ould at once offer to negotiate.

I said that it seemed to me that there was an unjustifiable desire to get a full share of the ordinary profits of prosperous years while being sheltered from all danger of trade fluctuations. All properly-run companies took precautions to protect their shareholders from dc excessive fluaaiions by buiIcing up special reserves and I Baw no reaS0JQ 'ky the ?«rsian Government should not act on the same principle.

Me tathereh, however, that the distribution for , - a ° l y ear was ooiieved not even to give to Persia the full amount to tfiieh she was entitled under the Armitage-Smith setthoiaent. I replied that this seemed to ae extraordinarily im;) rob able seeing that the Persian Government had entrusted the protection of their interests in London to perhaps the most prominent firm chartered accountants* in any oase the An^lo-Persian Oil Company had expressed the wish that the Persian Government should satisfy themselves of the position by an inspection of the Company*s books and it seemed id me that it would have been infinitely better to await the result of such an examination rather than to start trying out before knowing whether there was any semblance of a grievance• Ferou^i did not deny this, *&gt;• notwithstanding the somewhat unsati sf ctory attitude of the two Ministers, it must be remembered that both&gt;oth wexe xii u, difficult situation, being obliged; to answer an attack upon a foreign Company in ter«s that would satisfy not only a Mejlis which realises that its duty is to be Nationalis tie, but a choleric sovereign.

I British Legation, 0 u 1 h e k, July £lst, 1932. 3^ a ear Minister, After reading in the 'Messager' of this morning the report of the discussion in the Mejlis on the subject of the activities of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, I have a feeling of regret that the Persian Government, how ever great the disappointment may be at the smallness of the ro alty, should have done nothing to refute the view which appears to be held that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company are hardly fair, and certainly not generous, in their dealings with the Persian nation. It is a matter of universal knowledge that there is no oil company in the world that has past not suffered severely during the/year, and I believe it to be a fact that the shareholders of the Anglo-persian Oil Company, including the Persian Government, have suffered relatively less seriously thai those of most other companies I like to hope that when these matters are further dis cussed in the Mejlis, the Government will be at pains to remove any false impressions and to show that it fully shares the view of the Company that adverse trading conditions can be more successfully faced in a spirit of close cooperation thai in the presence &amp;f recrimination and mistrust.

I have the honour to be with the highest respect, Sir, four most obedient, humble Servant, (Signed) R.H.Hoare.Enclosure In Tehran despatch Mo. 322 dated the 15th,July, 1932. The comments of the papers o^ the ode or ease in the Persia royalties for 1931 on the Anglo-Per si an Oil Company income started with an expose of figures by the paper Iran (Ho.3835 of June 27th 1932). In its r Hotes of the Day” of the above date, the paper states that the •Persian Royalties have decreas ed from £1,300,000 for 1930 to £306,872 for 1931. After quot ing a summary return of the revenues and expenditure of the Company for 1931 from the printed statements issued by the Company, the paper demonstrates that the same royalties have been shown by the Company in the printed report to be £134,750. What is the reason for this apparent and unaccountable differ ence between the two figures given both as royalties due to the Persian Government for the same year. The paper, 'Inform ation’’, a French publication shows that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s output of crude oil and oil products during 1931 had a surplus of tons 743,000 over and above that for 1930. '’Taking all factors of dxirjorw depreciation of the price of the oil in the world markets as a result of terrific competition, etc. into account, we cannot imagine that while the output was high er during 1931 to such an extent, the income should have been so enormously decreased. Further, the general income of the Company during 1931 shrank by two thirds but the Persian Got em inent royalties by -f* Why this big difference. It naturally occurs to one and more especially to a Persian whether the facts are really as stated. This gives more right and opportunity to the Government to examine with care the accounts represented by the Company. Are these d epreciations in the Persian royalties actuated by political or simpler and commercial factors ? This remains to be known. The Government is to elucidate this point.” The next issue of the paper Iran which deals with the above question is Ho. 3837 of June 29th 1932. TheThe paper egresses satisfaction at the fact that other papers like shafaq etcetera have tdcen up the comments, since tne date of the Iran paper's comments, in regard to the question of the A.P.O.cis royalties. She matter, the paper adds, is of such magnitude in principle that it is worth being tdren up by the Government and the Majlis and in fact by all authoriti. of importance in the country. The principle should first be admitted that the ultimate aim in granting a concession to a foreign country^by the Persian Government is not to see that as a result the beneficiary Company enjoys the third place in importance among the oil producing and oil-selling companies of the world- that it creates every day a new institution and subsiciary profiteering company for the better exploitation of profits to go direct into the packets of English shareholders and the British Government. Far from this consideration it is at least conceivable that the Persian Government which granted the concession should also receive sufficient benefits of the conoession which is orked on its own territory. There is no naed nere to give the history of the genesis of the D’Arcy concession in an epoch of our national life when concessions of nature and more important ones were given by indifferent officials who v/ere essentially devoid of patriotism, against comparatively trifling substitutes. In an age when the renunciation of solemn afcd unquestionable obligations of debts etcetera does not even astonish the general public throughout the world, there is every reason to believe that a cancellation of such a concession would not occasion any objection or reprimand against ^ersia. If the Persian Government were allowed to receive, as its royalties, a free supply of oil pro ducts for its current needs, its royalties must needs have far exceeded those which are assigned to it under the present arrangement, setting aside for the moment the calculation of what would huve been the gain of the Persian Government were it to enjoy the whole concession. The B 1 Arcy concession is•/•V -3- Ot therefore one that can be imagined to be beneficial and advantageous to the Wan Government, and the more so when think that i’ersia as a legitimate partner in the company is denied all participation in the secret dealings or the general trend of affairs of tv, Q n 1 ' of the company. Persia is ignor- ant of the masonio-like * reU of the Company (Faramoosh- n.n.1.1.

The reply is in the negative. The statutes of the Company and its various regulations allow, most unpleasant to acknowledge, more freedom of supervision and scrutiny to a private shareholder than to Persia. This state of things does not produce an enviable result for Persia and it is time for the Persian Government, Doth for the present as for future considerations, that it should have formulated with serious and firm attitude, its future position with the Company on a basis of equality and participation in all profits. There was a time when owing to the immediate needs of the Persian Government any sum offered by the Company had such an attraction for them that by its acceptance, they gave their tacit acquiescence to the accounts and balance sheets of the Company; but at the present moment the situation allows the Persian Government to throw off with ease a few hundred thous and pounds sterling pending the time when they cm elucidate their accounts with the Company, we do not advocate a high handed policy on the part of the Persian Government but we do not see why the Persian Government should be oppressed either. Se we hope that the Government will take the necessary decision and exert the required energy, we understand with satisfaction that/that the Government share our views and in the same spirit the A.P.O.C. has been notified that the Government do not accept their royalties at the sum fixed pending the clari- fication of the accounts.COPY.

In oonsiuerin, the proposal to reduce the nuraoer of sloops in the Persian Gulf, it is difficult to divorce the protection of British interests in -Iraq from the protection of British interests as a whole, as they are all inuirectly hound together by the history of our position i the Gulf. Perhaps it would not be out of place to refer shortly to the reasons which brought British ships to the Gulf end which have progressively led us to consolidate our influence in the Gulf. 3. Great Britain was originally compelled to interest herself in the Persian Gulf owing to its position relative to the line of sea communications with India, situated on the flank of those sea oomsiunications and at one time the refuge of hordes of pirates it must necessarily have attracted the attention of any maritime power interested in their sea communications with India. For these reasons it has been the declared policy of Eis KhJesty's Government to allow no other nations to establish a aaval base in the Persian Gulf or in the Gulf of Oc later, trade interests developed and led to the general pacification of the Gulf. L ter again in 1880 th. armstraffic in the Gulf attracted the attention of the Indian Government at the time of the Third Afghan War. Finally the Gulf became a vital factor in our system of Imperial Defence when the Persian Oil fields were de^oped and supplied jhe main source of fuel oil supply under British control* 4. lo these interests are now added two other important ones. In the first place the Persian Gulf is at present the only practicable military line of communication between Great Britain and f Ira and between f Ira^ and India, and it is upon this line of communication that depend for the maintenance of our military forces in tnis country* Secondly the Persian Gulf now lies directly on our air line of communications with India and Australia, the maintenance of which is one of the principal causes of our preoccupation with ^raq and its future* 5. It is now therefore more than ever important to maintain naval predominance in the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman in order that British communications with Basrah and Abadan may be safeguarded. Otherwise, apart from the vital question of oil supplies it would be not only impossible to give effect to plans for the reinforcement of our forces in this country by troops from India, but it would even become impossible to maintain the British force already in this country* That there is some danger of the development of hostile influence in the Gulf is si nified by the renewed claims which the Persians are making to territory which is at present under British j^jjp3.u0ii(30 and by the purchase by the Persian Government of war vessels for use in the Gulf* 6 * Furthermore, it happens just now that we are trying to establish a civil air route from Basrah via the ArabianArabian littoral of the Gulf to India. The practicability of the safe establishment of this route depends upon the predominance of our influence with the Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast over that Of the Persians or of Ibn Sa'ud. our prestige with the Shaikhs has already been shaken by our obvious wenicness in handling our own and their interests in Persia. Any reduction of force in the Gulf would tend to confirm them in the impression that ve no longer intend to dispute with Persia our interests in the Gulf* 7* Upon the above general grounds, therefore, it is obvious that any reduction of our number of ships in the Gulf would be most inopportune at the present time* 3, How as regards the specific role of these ships in connection v ith the local security of the Persian oil fields and of the town of Basrah. As was exemplified last Summer, serious internal disturbances may develop very quicidy in Southern T Iraq and the presence of a sloop at Basrah may be urgently required at very short notice. The present number of four vessels enables the Senior 2^aval Officer always to have two ships within the Gulf itself. A reduction of the number of sloops by one would mean that only one ship would be normally available within the whole of the Gulf. This would considerably reduce the probability of a ship being at hand in the event of sudden disturbances.in Basrah, and the reduction would therefore tend to endanger the safety of the European population of that town. 9. The scheme for the defence of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company^ oilfields in South Persia, referred to in your memora dum, is based on the supposition that there will be available to assist in the defence two sloops as well V as H.M.3.'Triad', making three naval vessels in all. The tas t ;s allotted to these vessels are as follows:-(a) (*) The landing of naval parties to protect Abadan* ine landing of naval parties to protect Mohammerah. (c) The provision of gunners for four armed cars or the a*j. 0 # C. until the Company can train its own men* (d) Demonstrations* (e) The covering of the move of European and Indian employees from xbadan to Basrah. 10. Tliis number of vessels would not be available if the present force were reduced by one, since one of the four sloops is generally refitting at Bombay. 'The scheme also pre-supposes that at least one sloop will normally be within twenty-four hours’ distance of Abadan, ana that the remaining two vessels will be available at short notice. If the proposed reductions are carried out this defence scheme will nave to oe drastically modified and I consider* that two ships would not be sufficient for the purposes for which these ships are required.
