The original treaty was given a term of twelve years, which was extended at regular intervals afterwards, initially for several years at a time and later on an annual basis.The volume covers the period May 1938-February 1939 (abbreviated as 'Feby' on the volume's cover). It documents informal discussions between the two parties regarding the replacement of the treaty; it also includes extensive correspondence discussing amendments, drafts and revised drafts. Also discussed are discrepancies between the English and Arabic texts of the draft treaty, and preparations for the final signature copies of the new treaty.The correspondence largely consists of interdepartmental discussion between officials of the India Office, Foreign Office, the Colonial Office, the Board of Trade, and the Government of India's External Affairs Department. Other correspondents include the Secretary of State for India, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and the Sultan of Muscat and Oman [Sa‘īd bin Taymūr Āl Bū Sa‘īd].In addition to correspondence the volume contains a full draft of the new treaty (ff 11-45) and notes on meetings between British representatives and the Sultan of Muscat and Oman in April 1938, concerning amendments to particular articles (ff 48-60).The Arabic language material consists of several items of correspondence and draft Arabic translations of certain passages from the treaty (English texts appear alongside the Arabic translations).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between Great Britain and Muscat (1939)</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India and Burma, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Political Service, External Affairs Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Colonial Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Board of Trade</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Treaties</topic></subject><subject><topic>Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between Great Britain and Muscat (1891)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x00001e#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x00001e#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
