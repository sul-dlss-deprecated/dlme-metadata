A telegram from the Washington Coal Committee to the London Coal Committee, dated 5 March 1946, states that the 200,000 tons of petroleum coke at Bahrain have been purchased by the Great Lakes Carbon Corporation, and that the Corporation wishes to move ‘all of the coke in a westward direction’.The file notes at the end of the file (ff 5-6) record a discussion held between the Political Agent (Cornelius James Pelly) and the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrain in October 1945, in which the Political Agent asks his Assistant how many bags of coke does he think he would need for a fire during the winter. The Assistant Political Agent suggests forty bags, which the Political Agent requests be sent to him with a separate bill.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Petroleum Company</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Petroleum products</topic></subject><subject><topic>Exports</topic></subject><subject><topic>Fossil fuels</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000071#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
