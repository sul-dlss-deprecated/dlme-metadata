It may here be noted that the transfer of the Departments of Irrigation and Agriculture from the military to the civil administration has recently (10th February 11)19) been sanctioned by His Majesty’s Government. But the ” quasi-civil” Departments of Local Resources, Inland AVater Transport, Port Directorate, Labour and Public Works, Railways. 1 clegraphs, and Medical, 4 still remain under military control. The Department of Inland W utjer 1 ransport alone employs nearly 800 British officers ; the Labour Department some 270; Railways 145; Port Directorate nearly 50; Local Resources 07; and Public Works 12o! The total number of British “ other ranks employed in “quasi-civil” military departments exceeds^ 13,000 ; while that ol Indian “followeis ” amounts to nearly 13(),CMi0, of whom abrmt 55 per cent, were enlisted for the duration of the war, and the remainder for specified periods. o. With regard to the War Office suggestion No. (i) (see paragraph 3), it may be explained that, under Army regulations, a commissioned officer is not entitled to any leav e on demobilisation. An officer willing to accept civil employment in Mesopotamia, and at the same time desirous of proceeding on leave to England, must adopt one of two courses. Either (a) lie may be demobilised in Mesopotamia, in which case the civil authorities can of course grant him leave at their discretion ; or (/&gt;) lie may proceed to the l Anted. Kingdom for early diseharge, with a view to subsequent re-employment in Mesopotamia in a civil capacity. In neither case would the cost of his return passage to Mesopotamia be accepted as a charge upon Army funds. The Wai* Office (letter of 11th February 19P.)) regard alternative (b) as the preferable course ; and suggest, as a way out of the difficulty, that the return passages of * There is also u small civil medical depart meat. I'J iS JS 40 4/19all officers adopting this procedure should “ be met by the State, i.e from the revenues of the occupied territories. This suggestion was telegraphed out to the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad on the 27th February. lie replied (24th March) agreeing that the cost of return passages might properly be met from Iraq revenues, and asking for the assistance of the War Office i n providing “ privilege ” passages by outward bound transports. d. Suggestion No. (ii) in the War Office letter of the 22nd February raises greater difficulties. &amp; In agreeing to Colonel Wilson’s proposals for the engagement of officers on temporary contracts, the Foreign Office laid stress on “the necessity for not proceeding too fast in the matter of these appointments” ; and it was by their desire fas intimated above) that the period of contracts was limited to one year. The reasons for caution are clear enough. Pending a pronouncement by the Peace Conference, we cannot be certain what our eventual status in Mesopotamia will be ; and it is very desirable on diplomatic grounds to avoid any action having the appearance of taking the future for granted. There is no need to labour the point ; the delicacy of the diplomatic situation as affecting the Middle East as a whole is sufficiently well known. It is to be noted in connection with the War Office proposal that the Civil Commissioner himself has not complained of the limitation imposed by ILis Majesty’s Government, and has given us no reason to believe that he considers it impracticable to secure the services of officers on a one-year contract. It is for consideration, however, whether the discretion allowed to the Civil Commissioner in the matter might not be somewhat extended. The orders of the 24th January laid it down that the period of contracts should not exceed one year unless absolutely necessary. It might perhaps be intimated to Colonel Wilson that this qualification may be interpreted with a certain amount of latitude, subject in all cases to an extreme limit of three years. 7. War Office suggestion No. (iii) seems to be open to objections of a similar character to those mentioned in the preceding paragraph. It is scarcely possible, under present conditions, to give “ definite indications” as to the future policy of particular Departments. 8. The question arises whether, with a view to facilitating the eventual transition from military to civil administration, a further transfer of “ quasi-civil” Departments to civil control might not now be authorised. As already stated, the transfer of the Departments of Irrigation and Agriculture was sanctioned by His Majesty’s Government on the 10th February. It was decided at the same time, that the Department of Local Resources, the main function of which is to obtain supplies locally for the army of occupation, should remain under military control. This decision will presumably be allowed to stand. Of the other “quasi-civil ” Departments, those of Inland Water Transport, Labour, Railways and Telegraphs can hardly be removed from the direct control of the military authorities so long as the Mesopotamian Field Force remains on its present war footing. The question of the Medical Department presents special difficulties, which are under active discussion with the War Office, the Civil Commissioner and the Government of India. They need not he gone into here. On the whole, no further transfer of Departments seems necessary or practicable in the immediate future. It may be left to the local authorities to raise the question hereafter as circumstances require. In the meantime it is suggested that authority might be given to the Civil Commissioner, in consultation with the General Officer Commanding, to engage officers on temporary contracts for service in “ quasi-civil” Departments under precisely the same conditions as those outlined above as applying to the Civil Departments proper., Such officers would form part of the military administration so long as their Departments remained under direct military control ; on the transfer of their Departments, they would pass automatically to the civil side. Their pay, &amp;e., would be chargeable to local revenues from the date of their engagement under contract. The arrangement would of course be a purely temporary one. It might be desirable to intimate to the Civil Commissioner that the authority which it is proposed to give him is intended to be sparingly used; and there can be no* question of maintaining the personnel of the “ quasi-civil 1 departments indefinitely at its present strength. 0. To sum up, the following recommendations are submitted :— (1) That the cost of the return passage of British officers and other ranks proceeding to England for demobilisation with a view to re-employment in a civil capacity in Mesopotamia should be accepted as a cffiirge against the revenues of the occupied territory; ' 1 (2) That the Civil Commissioner I* authorised, in amplification-of the instructions of employment in administration : (4) „ e ”fcage'officers under temporary contract for quasi-civi 1 Departments not yet transferred to the civil the conditions governing such contracts to be similar to those applying to the engagement of oflicers for the Civil Departments proper • Ihat ofheers so appointed to “ quasi-eivil” Departments should remain in direct subordination to the military authorities pending transfer of their Departments their pay, Ac being chargeable to local revenues from the date of their engagement under contract.
