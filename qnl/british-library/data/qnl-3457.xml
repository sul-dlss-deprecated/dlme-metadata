He encloses a copy of a letter, dated 18 April 1824, which he has written to Captain Charles Sealy, Senior Marine Officer in the Persian Gulf. In this attached letter, Stannus issues a set of instructions which are to be communicated to the officers under Sealy's command. The orders state that any boats detected as having attacked vessels under British colours are to be sunk or destroyed without hesitation. Boats which are found to have attacked vessels not carrying a British flag are to be seized and taken to a place of safety, while any boat or boats reported as being destined for piratical enterprises must be detained and taken to the Resident; if it is not possible to detain a ship then a description of the boat, its tribe and owner should be sent to the Resident.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054395.0x00003e#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
