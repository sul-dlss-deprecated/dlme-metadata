T/2 dated 25th Pebruary 1938 from the Political Agent xiut at Gwadur to the Representative of nis Highness the Sultan of Muscat and uman. Re impounding of the passports of British subjects by the Muscat State ufficials.After compliments. You will remember that the Hon»ble the Political Resident and I discussed with you on the i-Oth February i '08 the Uiattei of British Indian subjects who returned to Muscat Irom India without the necessary visas on their passports on the up Mail of 1st February r 36,^ These individuals were of course cuite in the wrong not to have tneir passports properly visa’d in India for Muscat and the Political resident has taken the opportunity, when ti'r,y called on him, to explain this to them, and to inform them that they will now have to pay the visa fees to the Agency* At the Sam) time the action of the Muscat authori ties in regard to these individuals was, in the opinion of the Political Resident, quite incrrect and he feels sure that you will agree with his view* This action consisted in Mr. Dulichand, the Heed of the Customs Department, impounding their passports without any reference to the Agency. At our discussion the Political Resident suggest- ed that in order to facilitate our joint investigation of the matter. Hr. Dulichand might be asked by you to come and explain his action, and you agreed. Mr. Dulichand explain ed that he had the passports taken from the individuals concerned and sent to the Passport Officer for action. There the passports reti.ained for about three weeks until they were returned to the Agency on the afternoon of the £Oth February 1838. In the first place the Political Resident does not understand what authority Mr. Dulichand, who is in charge of the Customs Department, had for interfering with the British subjects concerned, or in the second place why the passports were kept by the Pascport Oflice. The correct action/action for the author it ids; was obviously to ;-ave the individuals concerned and their passports to the Agency i»ith the report or the Incidence, an] you rer embor you agreed »ith Uie Political Heeiaent that in future any cue*tion. of hritich subjects and their passports should be bo referred, As incidents such cs; this tsnri to create friction bet^^en British subjects and tha Muscat State authorities, good relations between whom the &gt;olitlc;il Resident is much ccnternefd to aaintain, tiie Political Resident tru*ts that Youi- Honour will take such measures as yot? deem fit to ensure that tiiey do not recur.
