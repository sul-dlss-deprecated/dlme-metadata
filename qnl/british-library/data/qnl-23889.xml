Dear Sir, MUSCAT WATER SUPPLIES &amp; P.C.L^GEOIOaiSTS* VISITS In continuation of our No.DO/TCtf. 2/4351 dated the 13th July 1946 and recent conversations between the rion’ble the Political Resident and Mr. Lermitte. 1. Arrangements are being made by our Haifa Management, subject to final confirmation from London,for Mr. Williamson to visit Muscat about the end of October 1946 to investigate water supplies. Mr. Williamson considers that two or three weeks on the ground should be sufficient to enable him to make his recommendations. 2. We believe also that two other Company geologists, Messrs. Olynn- Jones and Chenevart,plan to visit Muscat this coming cool season. If this visit materializes, Mr. Williamson proposes a combined trip along the Batinah coast as part of the season’s programme. Mr. Williamson’s suggestion is that the three should assemble at Sharjah and proceed by road to Muscat and interview His Highness the Sultan and the Political Agent and ascertain the areas in which they are interested. In any case, it is Mr. Williamson’s intention to carry out his own water investigations in late October and November. 3. Mr. Lermitte was infoimed by the Hon’ble the Political Resident that His Highness the Sultan plans to leave Muscat on or about the 20th of October. In these circumstances, if it is considered necessary for Mr. Williamson to contact His Highness, it would seem that the date of Mr. Williamson’s arrival at Muscat must be put forward unless His Highness is prepared to postpone his departure. 4. We have telegraphed Haifa pointing out that in view of His Highness’s plan to leave Muscat, early and definite information with dates on our geologists’ programme is desirable.
