INDIA OFFICE ,, Quarantine Control in the Persian Gulf. This question has now been disposed of, at any rate temporarily, by the decision of His Majesty’s Government to acquiesce, subject to certain provisos, in the immediate transfer of control to the Persian Government, such transfer taking effect on 28th July. Should it, however, prove that Persia is incompetent adequately to discharge her international obligations, the position will call for further consideration. The Memorandum now attached describes in some detail the developments leading up to the surrender of control by His Majesty’s Government. 1. Under arrangements dating from IStid and confirmed and modified in 189b on the occasion of an epidemic in the Gulf, quarantine arrangements are in the hands of British medical officers lent by the Government of India from the Indian Medical Service, &amp;c. Since 1896 the pay and allowance of the Quarantine Medical Officers at Bunder Abbas, Lingah and Mohammerah, and the pay of the quarantine establishments and contingent expenditure at Lingah, Bunder Abbas, Mohammerah, Bushire and Jask, have been borne by the Persian Government. The Chief Quarantine Medical Officer reported in 1927 that expenditure on these ports averaged krans 2,20,000 per annum, but that, the Persian Government providing a sum of approximately krans 1,80,000 annually to meet this, there was invariably a claim for arrears. The remaining expenditure on the service and the personnel by which it is manned (allowances to Chief Quarantine Medical Officer, to Senior Assistant Surgeon, Bushire, and to Assistant Surgeon, Jask ; pay and allowances of junior Assistant Surgeon, Bushire ; total in 1927, Rs. 12,000 per annum) is equally divided between Imperial and Indian revenues. The Persian Government were, however, informed in 1926 that His Majesty’s Government would not be piepared to sanction further capital expenditure in connection with installations or expenses of maintenance. The Chief Quarantine Officer in the Gulf has in the past reported to the Sanitary Council in Teheran, which contains a British member. 2. At the International Sanitary Conference in Paris, the meetings of which concluded in June 1926, the Persian representative endeavoured, unsuccessfully, to secure recognition of the fact that Persia was now fully competent to administer the sanitary services in her ports without foreign intervention. Having failed to secure his object, and having refused to consider a compromise under which Article 90 of the Convention (which replaces Article 83 of the Convention of 1912, and under which the existing condition of affairs is regulated) should be replaced by an Article stating that the sanitary regime in Persian ports would be determined by subsequent negotiations between the Persian Government and His Majesty’s Government, he put in a reservation as regards Article 90. To this the representatives of His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India replied by a counter-reservation saving the status quo, pending the conclusion of an agreement on the subject between His Majesty’s Government and Persia, and both reservations were consigned to the record of the proceedings. 3. In January of the following year ::&gt; the Persian Government raised the question of transfer to Persian medical officers of the quarantine service in the south with the Minister in Teheran, who replied in the terms of the reservation of June 1926. In April 1927f the Assistant to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf agreed, without authority, to the exercise by the Persian Government of what was described as “ a nominal control ” over the quarantine arrangements carried out in the Gulf by our officers. His action was disavowed, the Resident taking the line, when opportunity offered, that the question was one which must be raised in Teheran through the ordinary diplomatic channels, but the error had been made and the Persian Government did not fail to take advantage of it. 4. In July of 1927^1 Sir Robert Clive reported that the Persian Director of Health had noted in the minutes of the Sanitary Council a statement that 2979a 75 10.28 A Teh.

At the same time in the light of the situation caused by the cholera outbreak at Abadan and Mohammerah it was agreed by the Sanitary Council, the Legation Doctor acquiescing, that the senior Health Officer of the South (the reference being to the Persian) should decide which Persian ports should remain open, all others being closed and that, further, Persian and English doctors should be asked to work together. On the instructions of the Minister a letter was sent to the President of the Council by the Legation Doctor to say that it w r as presumed that the Persian Health Officer would only make recommendations after consultation with and in agreement with the Chief Quarantine Officer.® 5. Meanwhile, the Persian Government had intimated unofficially through the Director-General of Health that their position vis-a-vis the Russian Medical Officers in the Persian Caspian ports, who had been deprived of powers of interference in quarantine, was difficult in view of the state of affairs in the Persian Gulf; that they in no way desired there to replace at present the existing British Medical Officers by Persians since it would be some time before suitable Persian doctors would be available and even when they did become available they would be installed only very carefully, and that they desired that the service should remain as it was, but under the supervision and direction of the Persian Health Department. Sir Robert Clive remarked that could we really rely on the Persian Government confining themselves to calling for and receiving quarantine reports and regularly contracting for the service of British quarantine officers in the Gulf for a number of years and not unduly interfering in the present system, he was of opinion that much might be gained by regularising the service on some such basis. The Foreign Office suggested that the Minister might be authorised to take action on these lines and the Government of India, whose views were accepted by the Secretary of State for India, reluctantly agreed, remarking that the best course apparently was to aim at tempering full nominal control by Persia with as effective safeguards as possible against executive control. They suggested that stress might be laid on our ability, if not unduly interfered with, to work the system for the present more cheaply than they could and on the necessity ol; avoiding premature innovations which might have the effect of bringing the present excellent arrangements into serious discredit with the Office International.f Sir Robert Clive was accordingly authorised J to endeavour to arrange with the Persian Government on the lines suggested by him. (It may bs noted that at this stage, the Ministry of Health m a letter of 11th August 1927,§ represented the undesirabilty, in view of the existence of the cholera epidemic at Abadan, of taking any action at the present juncture likely to impair the authority of the British Quarantine Officers in the Gulf Ports in the administration and execution of sanitary measuies, and referred to the reservation on the subject of control registered by the British representatives at the Sanitary Conference in 1926). ^ 6. Sir Robert Clive before raising the matter with the Persian Government took the opinion of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, suggestino- that the objects to be secured appeared, on a preliminary examination, to be the following:— (а) The retention so far as possible, by the British Quarantine Officers ot the Indian Medical Service in as unhampered a form as possible ^ of the leal executive authority in quarantine matters. (б) The regularisation if possible of the whole basis of the service of the British Quarantine Officers under the Persian Government so as to give the maximum possible assurance that the Persian Government would regularly meet the amounts due on their salaries and on the disputed leave salary and pension contributions. (c) That there should be no question of interference by the Persian Government with the appointments, &amp;c., of individual British Quarantine Officers. &amp; Oolonel Haworth replied on 12th September 1927 a^reeincr R.vi Chief Quarantine Medical Officer, with the Minister’s' concfusle bI suggested, however, that it was desirable that the Cl.ief Quarantine MedicalOfficer should be placed, for quarantine matters only, in a position of direct subordination to the Sanitary Council at Teheran, not to the Persian Director of Southern Health at Shiraz, an arrangement which would' he result m preserving real executive authority in quarantine for’the Chief Quarantine Medical Officer. Sir R. Clive, who agreed that this latter object would probably be attained if subordination to the Central Health authorities at Teheran (not necessarily to the Sanitary Council) could be secured, proposed (P. 5030) to discuss the question informally when oppor tunity offered with the head of the Department of Public Health, and in the light of such discussion to consider further the course to be followed. 7. It was decided at the beginning of 1928 that further consideration of the quarantine question should be left over until the treaty negotiations then being undertaken with Persia had further advanced. On 18th January, the Tn. De.p.nsi, Minister repoited, however,- that the Budget Commission had recommended 1927 ’ that provision for the payment of British quarantine medical officers in the . is Gul should be struck out of this year’s budget. The Head of the National F aS/as 1 Health Department had himself raised the question with the Oriental Secretary, assuring him that this was entirely contrary to his wishes and that he proposed to fight it, and had enquired on what lines His Majesty’s Government were ready to regularise the position of the Indian quarantine officers, and how long they expected the Persian Government to retain their services, as by law the Majlis would have to pass their contracts The Oriental beeretary replied on the general lines set out in para, li above and that a request should, be made for seven-year contracts ( h ^y ever &gt;t the Budget Commission informed the Director- + Teh. tei. 52 , Feb Geneial ot Health that immediate steps must be taken to replace the British 2[y p - “ss/as. medical officers by the end of the present financial year, while the Persian Cabinet, were also reported to be opposed to their continued employment. Ihe Director-General professed to hope to satisfy the Commission by retaining only one or two British doctors. He stated that he was convinced that some concession must be made, and added that he had sufficient competent 1 ersians to take over all the posts concerned. The Foreign Office took the line, with which the India Office agreed, that if the Persian Govern ment and the lersian Parliament were unwilling any longer to sanction the employment of all the British doctors at present employed in the Gulf ports, it would be difficult for His Majesty’s Government to insist on their doing so particularly 111 those posts in which the salaries of the officers had hitherto bee,, paid by Persia J In the light of the views of the Government j F . 0 . ,e tter t „ m of India and the lolitical Resident, the Secretary of State for India ao-reed Mar. 21928 , p. 1032 • moreover, that the ideal was that the present system should be retained both ™ at Mohammerah and at Bushire, Lingah and Bandar Abbas being given up ' ’ ' when necessary, but that, “ from every point of view,” the maintenance of a British doctor at Mohammerah was more essential than even at Bushire although at the latter place, as our headquarters in the Persian Gulf it was more important from the point of view of prestige. U. Matters reached a new stage with the conclusion of the first stao-e of the geneial negotiations with Persia in April. It will be remembered that it was then decided that an immediate decision should be taken on tariff autonomy, the capitulations and certain subsidiary questions, but that the Persian Gulf and matters affecting it should be left over for further discussion in the autumn, the Minister of Court promising that in the meantime “ no action would be taken to alter the existing state of thina S .” On the question of quarantine being raised with him in this connection leymourtache said, however, that in this matter the Budget Commission of Majlis had cut out the proposed grant for the payment of English doctors and he was powerless. On Sir R. Clive urging that the matter was of great mteiest to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, the Minister of Court replied that the I ersian quarantine officer at Mohammerah would be instructed to °u,;° pe O e Wlt 1 th , e , GO 1 offi ® ers of t!le Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and thU nothing would be done m such matters against the interests of the Company.§ 8 Teh. te ,. 10. But on the 10th May Sir Robert Clive informed the Foreign Office that ^ “ “ l * a telegram had been received from Colonel Haworth to the effect That a Persian4 * Teh. tel. 161, May 10 1928, P. 2399/28.

On representations being made to the Minister ConrJ stressing the extreme lack of courtesy to the Government of India and to the Vice-Consul at Mohammerah (who is also the quaiantme olhcei, n despatching a Persian doctor without any notification to them, levmouitache promised that instructions should be given that the I ersian doctoi should not at once require Dr. Lincoln to evacuate his house, and that he uould consider the sending of an official letter expressing thanks for the services- in the past of Indian medical officers m the Gulf and not Hying the changed . situation which had arisen from the refusal of the Majlis to vote money for foreign doctors, and the consequent decision of the 1 ersian Go\einmcnt appoint Persian doctors. The Minister added that the Persian doctor had categorical instructions to work in co-operation with the Angio-1 ersian Oil ConTpanv* On 4th May Sir R. Clive wrote to leymourtache, forwarding a memorandum on the question and stating that he had telegraphed to Bushire, proposing that the necessary instructions should be sent to Dr. Lincoln to collaborate with the Persian doctor despatched to Mohammerah by the fVntra 1 Govern ment. 11. The Government of India, in their telegrams of 13th May, No. 976-S (P. 2403), and 21st May, No. 1030-S, protested vigorously against the action of the Persian Government as being objectionable not only as likely to lead to quarantine inefficiency (responsibility for which, under the resolutions of the International Sanitary Conference of 1926, definitely rested with India), but as another deliberate blow at British prestige in South Persia and the Gulf. They suggested that strong representations, accompanied by a threat to dismantle the Duzdap Railway, should be made to the Persian Govern ment, and (on the assumption that finance was one of the chief difficulties), separately offered, in view of the interest of India m the question, to finance the quarantine themselves for, say, six months, to enable Persia to secure the foreign medical expert for whose recruitment as technical Counsellor to the National Health Department, the Majlis had given authority on the 29th April, and to provide for the satisfactory transfer of quarantine aiiangements from the Indian to the Persian medical officers. They suggested, too, that the Persian medical officer during the transitional period might usefully be attached to the Indian doctor to learn his work. 12. Meanwhile, however, Sir Robert Clive had reported' that the Minister of Court had definitely agreed to send an official Note on the lines referred to in para. 10 above, and to give definite instructions to the Persian doctors at Bushire and Mohammerah to consult and profit by the experience of the English quarantine doctors, in case the latter remained, and that Teymour- tache had added that he had already taken steps to prevent the status quo in the Gulf being upset, but that this question of doctors depended on the recent vote of the Majlis, and had nothing to do with his promise.t In a despatch dated the 4th May, No. 206, Sir IL Clive further stated that it was perfectly clear that the Persians had made up their minds to terminate the employment of the British quarantine officers. _ “ Teymourtache stated emphatically that this was not part of an anti-British policy^ The Persian Government had no intention or desire to contravene our rights, but, as I w-as aware, it was now the established policy of the Persian Government not to engage in their service citizens of limitrophe countries. No foreigner could now be engaged in any capacity by the Persian Government without his contract first being approved by the Majlis. Although he personally recognised the good work done by British quarantine doctors in the past, it would be useless to submit to the Majlis contracts for the-future employment of British doctors, as the Majlis would never approve such contracts.” Sir Robert Clive, in the despatch in question, had recommended that His Majesty’s Government should acquiesce, in the circumstances, in the Persian assurance that Persian quarantine doctors at Abadan and Moham merah would have standing instructions to work in co-operation with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s medical officer, and that the matter should immediately be taken up with the Minister of Court, should the Company have reason later to believe that the Persian doctors there had not received5 or were no ^ acting- in accordance with them. On the ^lat May-'- he added that, should the promised instructions not be given, and this lead to inefficiency this- summer, there would then be a strong case for submission of the question to the International Sanitary Council, that the Anglo-1 ei Sian Oil Company had offered for one year to pay Dr. Lincoln an additional sum equal to what he would lose as quarantine officer on the understanding that his Persian successor would be bound to co-operate in all quarantine matters with the Company’s medical officer, that, thanks to their helptui attitude, no difficulty need therefore be anticipated at Mohammerah, and that it was k) be hoped that the British quarantine medical officer at Bushire, by maintaining tactful relations with the Persian doctor there, would m fact be able to see the quarantine service satisfactorily maintained. lo. In the light of the developments set out above, the -Foreign Office on the 11th June, officially asked the concurrence of the India Office in the acceptance of the Minister’s recommendations, forwarding at the same time a despatch from the Ministerj' in which Sir Robert Clive pointed out that leisia was entiiety within her sovereign rights in sending her own doctors to the Gulf, that she was under no contract to the Government of India to maintain a Bntish-controlled quarantine service, that she was not bound by any promise made at the last International Quarantine Conference not to do what she had clone, and that, in the circumstances, the only possible policy was to minimise as far as possible any ill effects on our prestige in the Gulf 'by the I eisian action, and to endeavour to induce the Persians to continue to avail themselves of the wide experience and knowledge of the British quarantine officers, with a view to maintaining an efficient quarantine service. 14. At this stage the matter rested until July 1928, action being- postponed by the India Office pending a decision on the proposal to set up a Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence on the position of His Majesty’s Government in the Gulf generally, and the subjects to be considered by that Sub-Committee. lo. On 13th July, however, the Charge d’Affaires at TeheranJ reported that the Minister of Court had spoken to him with unusual vehemence on the quarantine question, stating that Persia must be allowed to take over at all costs and even hinting at the use of force. It transpired that the Persian attitude was to some extent due to the fact that Dr. Lincoln, the British quarantine officer at Mohammerah, had not yet been authorised by the chief quarantine medical officer, acting under the orders of the Government of India, to hand over control of his Persian successor and that effect had thus not yet been given to the arrangement agreed in May between the Minister of Court and Sir R. Clive. 16. On 18th July the foreign Office wrote to the India Office§ urging their concurrence in regularisation of the position at an early date on the lines referred to in para. 12 above, and expressing the view that the delay which had taken place in giving effect to the arrangements made in May with the Minister of Court was regrettable. On the same date the Government of India telegraphed that three Persian doctors had arrived in Bushire, one to take over the quarantine at Bushire, one for duty at Lingah, while the third expected early orders for Jask and a fourth was reported to be proceeding to Bunder Abbas. The Government of India, while strongly reiterating their previous protests against the relinquishment of control by His Majesty’s Government, stated that they were ready to issue immediate instructions for the handing over of charge to the Persian doctors should His Majesty’s Government consider that this was necessitated by the discussions which had taken place at Teheran, or by consideration of the wider interests involved. The Indian officers would be instructed to afford all possible assistance to their successors. The Government of India added that the Charge d’Affaires would no doubt be able to arrange that the latter should be instructed to act in close consultation with the outgoing officers, who could be retained for say six months to see that the quarantine regulations w r ere properly carried out and to give the new regime a fair start. 2979a b * Teh. tel. 186, P. 2660; Teh.
