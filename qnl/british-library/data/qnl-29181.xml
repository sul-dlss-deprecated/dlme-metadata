Yours faithfully for General Manager.—The Arab of the Desert A GLIMPSE INTO BEDAWIN LIFE IN KUWAIT AND SAU’D^T ARABIA By H. R. P. Dickson Colonel Dickson brings unusual qualifications to an intimate study of the Bedawin (more popularly, though inaccurately, knov/n as the Bedouin). Born in Syria, where his father was British Consul, he spoke Arabic from babyhood. As an infant he had the good fortune to be foster-mothered by a Bedawin woman of the desert, and thus automatically became a blood- brother of her tribe, the important and aristocratic ’Anizah. These unique adventures he has utilized to the full, spending every available holiday in his black tents, camping and trekking with the Bedawin as one of themselves, and being permitted the unheard-of privilege of friendship with their womenfolk. He was able even to catch two glimpses of the almost-sacred, jealously-guarded Black Camels of the Mutair, and to enjoy a draught of their milk. With acute sympathy, observant eye and unwearied diligence, he hasnoted down every detail of their daily life, giving the reader an insight into their wanderings, ways and wiles, and a vivid picture of a form of life doomed sooner or later to extinction. Colonel Dickson joins the very remarkable group of English men and women who have interpreted the magic of far Arabia—Burton, Doughty, Lawrence, Bertram Thoiiias, St. John Philby, Gertrude Bell, Freya Stark. Mrs. Dickson’s careful and accurate illustrations, some of them in colour, form a valuable complement to the narrative. Illustrated. Demy 8vo.

SHERWOOD VOLUME I SEPTEMBER 1939-JANUARY 1942 Medium 8 vo 504 pages 14 pages of plates 255 net EYRE &amp; SPOTTISWOODE 15 BEDFORD STREET, LONDON, W.C.22 THE WHITE HOUSE PAPERS of HARRY L. HOPKINS T HE WHITE HOUSE PAPERS, the first volume of which will be published in October and the second in the early spring of 1949, tell the most authoritative inside story that has yet appeared of what actually took place between the great men of the war period. It is no accident that The Harry Hopkins Papers are offered to the public immediately on the heels of the first volume of Mr. Churchill’s Memoiis. Everyone who reads Mr. Churchill’s book will want to know how the world crisis was being faced , at the White House, and, in fact, The Hopkins Papers take up the detailed story where Mr. Churchill’s first volume leaves off. As a principal intermediary between President Roosevelt * and Mr. Winston Churchill, Harry L. Hopkins made a unique contribution to history. His secret papers represent one of the most valuable documentary sources for the history of the Allied war effort, and reveal, in hitherto unpublished detail, the nego tiations which led up to every important decision taken by the leaders. Historic conferences, confidential missions, the con temporary impact of triumphs and disasters—all are described in the secret reports and memoranda which accumulated at the White House as the years went by, and which Harry Hopkins carefully arranged so that, when the time came, he could write his own first-hand account of the period. But death intervened, and he was never able to tell his own story to the world. Mr. Robert Sherwood as Editor F ORTUNATELY, Mr. Robert E. Sherwood, himself a close friend both of Hopkins and of Roosevelt, and a collaborator in the preparation of many of the Presi dent’s speeches, was persuaded to undertake the task of editing ,* the papers and weaving them into a consecutive narrative. In the preparation of this book he has had the advantage of personal interviews with all the leading actors in the drama and of access to a vast number of State documents, from which he has been permitted to quote extensively.3 Wherever possible, he has left the papers—and this usually means the great men with whom they deal—to speak for themselves, but his narrative is in itself an outstanding con tribution to history illuminated by a sense of perspective and a firm grasp of detail. Not only was Mr. Sherwood personally associated with the men and events which form the subject matter of this book, but, as a famous writer and playwright whose works have always reflected his preoccupation with olitical problems, he has been able to present his material in a highly dramatic and realistic form. It is, thus, the peculiar virtue of this book that it gives to the general reader, as well as to the expert on international affairs, a living picture, in all its contemporary urgency, of the White House at war. The character and qualities of Harry Hopkins T HE introductory section presents a vivid account of Harry Hopkins’s early years, when his work in East- side slums gave a stimulus to his organizing abilities and first brought out all the selflessness of his character. After pioneer work for the prevention and treatment of tuberculosis and silicosis, Hopkins was chosen by President Roosevelt, at the time of the financial crisis of 1929, to be Federal Emergency Relief Administrator. Here he first gave a hint of those powers and gifts of character which only came to maturity in the world war and made out of the trusty political ally the famous Ambassador-at-large, of whom Mr. Marshall has said that ‘he rendered a service to his country which will never even vaguely be appreciated’. The Hopkins who developed in the war years was, in large measure, President Roosevelt’s own creation. The President deliberately educated Harry Hopkins in the arts of politics and of diplomacy, and then gave him wide powers of decision for no reason other than that he liked him, trusted him, and needed him. The President's loneliness F OR his part, Hopkins had an almost ‘feminine’ sensitivity to Roosevelt’s moods, and seemed to know exactly the moments when the President wanted to deal with affairs of State and when he wanted to relax.4 ‘Why do you keep Hopkins so close to you?’ Wendell Wilkie once asked the President, and got a significant answer. ‘Some day you may well be sitting here where I am now as President of the United States. And when you are, you’ll be looking at that door over there and know ing that practically everybody who walks through it wants something out of you. You’ll learn what a lonely job this is, and you’ll discover the need for somebody^ like Harry Hopkins, who asks for nothing except tc serve you.’ The Man who came to dinner W HEN war came to Europe, Harry Hopkins, then Secretary of Commerce, was able to study, at first hand, the reaction of America and her leaders to the new war; his papers contain a searching analysis of the Ameri can political climate during the ‘phony war’ and give pictures of Cordell Hull, Harold Ickes, Sumner Welles, and other prominent American politicians. It was on May 10, 1940, the day that Germany broke into France and the Low Coun tries, that Harry Hopkins had dinner at the White House and stayed for the next three and a half years. From then on he was in a position to witness from back-stage all the historic events that followed. His early papers give, for instance, the full inner story of President Roosevelt’s decision to stand for a third term and of the great election battle between Wendell Wilkie and the President. There is also the secret history of the negotiations for the exchange of the fifty over-age destroyers with England in return for the lease of naval bases to the United States. And in the background is the rumble of guns and the crash of bombs from Europe, a background vividly illuminated by confidential cables and dispatches from the capitals at war and from the Prime Minister in London in particular. For the greater part of his association with President Roose velt, Harry Hopkins was a sick man, his energy being contin ually drained away by illnesses which the doctors never fully diagnosed. Throughout the period that he was travelling back wards and forwards across the world for the President, he wasoften so ill as to cause despair among those around him. Ill health forced him to resign from the post of Secretary of Commerce, and in the intimate personal letter which he sent to the President we get a reminiscence of some of his happiest moments with Mr. Roosevelt. In residence at the White House, one of his tasks with Mr. Robert Sherwood and others was to work on the speeches which did so much to earn for the President the great affection n which he was held. There are detailed descriptions, too, of the writing and rewriting of messages and ‘fireside chats’ to which the whole world listened. The story of Lease-Lend T OWARDS the end of 1940, England was reaching the last of her dollar resources, and the most pressing ques tion was how she was to pay for further essential war material. A famous letter from Mr. Churchill, setting forth Great Britain’s position and her needs for 1941, sum marized by Mr. Sherwood, crystallizes the problem. Harry Hopkins could see that an idea was already germinat ing in the mind of the President. This idea was brought into full light towards the end of one of Mr. Roosevelt’s seemingly unimportant fishing cruises—a complete and fascinating ac count of which is given in the book—and Hopkins saw the birth of the idea of Lease-Lend. The White House Papers give the full momentous story of the most ‘ unsordid act ’ in all history, as the Prime Minister described it, and go on to paint the background of the famous ‘Arsenal of Democracy’ speech, and Mr. Churchill’s equally celebrated ‘Give us the tools’ reply. London — I I N January, 1941, Harry Hopkins paid his first visit to London on the President’s behalf, carrying a letter from Mr. Roosevelt to the King, which stated: ‘Mr. Hopkins is a very good friend of mine in whom I repose the utmost confidence.’ In the book, the dramatic description of his 56 arrival in London (‘too tired to face Churchill’) is followed by his notes on his meetings with Mr. Eden, Lord Halifax, and, finally, the Prime Minister himself. There are long and detailed pictures of war-time life at 10 Downing Street and Chequers, and Harry Hopkins s secret report of the all-embracing and decisive conversations which he had with Mr. Churchill. Under the grey skies of a winter day, the President’s envoy travelled to Scapa to bid Lord Halifax godspeed on his journey to Washington, and heard Mr. Churchill’s heartfelt comments as he saw the Fleet riding at anchor. Back in London, he attended a dinner given for him by Lord Beaverbrook to meet the Press, and, after a complete description of this, we have Harry Hopkins’s report to the President of his con versations with the King and Queen. On his return to Washington, he was at the centre of the bitter struggle which led to the eventual enactment of Lease- Lend and the assurance of‘all aid short of war’ to the democra cies from the President. Appointed administrator of Lease- Lend even while he was undergoing medical treatment, he reveals in The White House Papers the size and complexity of the organization for which he was responsible. London — II T HAT summer—1941—Hopkins came to England once more, as Hitler launched his invasion of Russia. Hopkins was quick to realize that on a correct estimation of the strength of Russian resistance depended the whole scale and apportionment of Lease-Lend. Hastily obtaining the President’s consent for a flight to Moscow, he left England after a Sunday spent at Chequers with the Prime Minister, whose guests also included the late John Winant, Averell Harriman, Dorothy Thompson, and Lord Cherwell. Quentin Reynolds, who was also present, has given Robert Sherwood a full account— printed for the first time in The White House Papers —of this historic Sunday, and of Harry Hopkins’s departure for Moscow.Moscow H OPKINS was acutely interested in everything that he saw in the Soviet Union, and there is a full description of his landing, his first official meal on Soviet soil, and the reception that was accorded him. He then goes on to give a verbatim account of the first meeting with Stalin, when he received a full and frank report on the Russian situa tion and on the Red Army s needs in arms and material, followed by one of the first meeting with Molotov, and the reader is able to gain a very clear picture of the state of the Russian front at that vital juncture in history. Mr. Hopkins sent also a comprehensive report to the President gauging Russia’s military situation and revealing his own reactions to the evidences of totalitarian rule which met him. Mr. Steinhardt, the American Ambassador in Moscow, wrote of his visit that Stalin ‘discussed with a frank ness unparalleled in my knowledge in recent Soviet history the subject of his mission and the Soviet position’. The Atlantic Charter O N his return to England, he immediately joined the Prime Minister on H.M.S. Prince of Wales for the rendezvous with President Roosevelt that led to the issue of the Atlantic Charter. The reader is given probably the most detailed and intimate description of the first meeting between Mr. Churchill and President Roosevelt, and of the crowded days of conference which led, not only to the drawing up of the Atlantic Charter, but to joint consultations by the Chiefs of Staffs on every possible eventuality in the war, including the enigma of Japan ese action. When Hopkins returned to Washington, he knew that in the comradeship of Britain and America alone lay the safety of both and that such comradeship was assured in the friendship of their respective leaders. For his part, Mr. Churchill summed up his impression of Harry Hopkins in the descriptive phrase, ‘The great heart that is within that frail frame.’Pearl Harbour F OR the remainder of that autumn of 1941, news from the Far East was mingling with reports from Europe, until, on December 7, came the dramatic climax. Harry Hopkins was at the White House when the fateful messages were received, and before going to bed he wrote down his own full account of all that happened on the day of Pearl Harbour. This account is of supreme historical importance. ^ It is followed by the transcription of a transatlantic telephone conversation between Hopkins in Washington and Lord Beaverbrook in London, and then there is a full description of the arrival in Washington, on December 22, of the British Prime Minister for the series of conferences known as Arcadia. The Prime Minister at the White House T HE Arcadia conferences saw the formulation of the Allied grand strategy on which the whole of the later operations of the war were to be based. From them sprang the unity of command and purpose which constituted an integral element in the achievement of victory, and in the White House during those Christmas weeks of 1941 were drawn up in outline the plans by which the war was brought to a successful conclusion nearly four years later. Together with delightful domestic scenes of Christmas at the White House and of the President and the Prime Minister broadcasting to the world on Christmas Eve, there is the inside story of the planning of the North African Landings and of the complicated pohtical decisions that had to be taken, and an account of the factors leading to the setting up of the Combined Chiefs of Staffs organ ization whereby, from the beginning, the Anglo-American forces were assured of coherent and intelligent direction. 8On the production side, Harry Hopkins himself was given a key position as head of the Munitions Assignment Board, responsible for seeing that the Allied armies were backed by the full weight of Allied production, and he gives the inner story of the formation of the War Production Board and the appointment of Donald Nelson as its chairman. Volume One ends, therefore, with the setting up of the -Grand Coalition as a prelude to the united effort which led vO the complete overthrow of the Axis. It is the story of pre paration and long-range planning, and of the cementing of friendships and alliances before the final struggle for victory. In its pages the reader will be able to trace for himself the gradually uniting threads of policy which led first to the decisive victories in Africa and the Mediterranean and later to the momentous conferences at Casablanca, Teheran, and Yalta, with which the second volume deals in full. He will find re vealed for the first time the foundations on which the vital decisions of the later war years rested, and through the private papers of a leading actor in the great drama he will be able to see and know the personalities who controlled the destinies of great nations. Never, perhaps, did one man undertake so many confidential missions as Harry Hopkins, and never, therefore, has there been contained in one man’s papers so much of the raw material of liistory. Publication arrangements The White House Papers will be published in medium octavo format in two volumes. The first volume (medium octavo, 504 pp., 14 pages of plates, price 25s. net.) covers the period from September, 1939, to January, 1942, and will be published at the end of October. The second volume (of approximately the same length) will be published in a uniform format in the early spring of 1949. This volume contains the whole of the Papers covering the period from February, 1942, to the end of the war.■Mi CONTENTS OF VOLUME I INTRODUCTORY Before 1940: The Education of Harry Hopkins I.

You said at the time that you might perhaps be able to find someone to help us run a paper* 2* I have now got a printing press which is not set up yet as it is proposed to instal it in a new building which we hope will be ready at about the end of January. V?e shall them need someone to work the press and I wonder whether you could find anyone for this oob* One difficulty is that rates of pay here are very much lower than in Baghdad, on the other hand the cost of living, though high in comparison to what they were, are still much lower than in Iraq.* We could pay, for the man in charge of the press, a salary of Rs#250/~ per month + cost of living allowance at the rate of Rs#5C$ of basic salary, totalling Rs*375/- per month, and a house allowance of Rs*10$ of basic salary or free quarters* Would we be likely to get anyone for this? 3# As a beginning we have started a Government Gazette, quite a small afair publishing Government notices etc*, which at present is issued monthly. We have enough stuff to fill it weekly. It is much in demand and, I understand, is being sent out of Bahrain to Kuwait and elsewhere* We charge 4 annas for it, about the cost of the paper, it is produced on a duplicator. 2 /- ii., V- ^ \ / % s . o&gt;:..o\\ -*x b utrocTj* x-.

Dear Information Officer, It is necessary, in view of the paramount need for economy in all special expenditure, to review the supplies of newspapers and periodicals, and for this purpose we shall need to know the amendments that you require as soon as possible. You should therefore submit lists (in triplicate) giving your full requirements and all publications shown will, after review here, be sent in the revised quantities. We should like to point out that any titles omitted from your lists will automatically be cancelled. When compling your lists, they should show • a) the requirements of the Infor mation Section, the Mission/Consulate and Reading Room, showing quantities under each head, and b) any copies for free distribution. Although as you already know it is essen tial to reduce this to those special cases in which, for one reason or another, it would be impolitic to cease the supply, it will be necessary for you to indicate briefly the reasons why the continued provisions of free copies is in your view necessary and justifiable. For details of comiiiling lists, please see attached specimen. To enable the Central Office of Informationto effect these changes smoothly and officiently, the lists should reach us as soon as.possible after 1st August *e think it necessary to remind.you of the supplies arranged under our Circular letter (P.9174/1349/964) of 10th December, 1948. This material, for other members of your Mission/Consulate, is now completely integrated with your bulk supplies land is no longer regarded separately and when amending your requirements this should be taken into account. On account of the present financial stringency, it is necessary to consider the value, in terms of benefit to our publicity policy, of each individual publication that you receive. Your information Office should be kept supplied with the material which you can digost and use with advantage and your Reading Room should satisfy the demands, within reason, of the public you wish to influence bearing in mind that supplies must be kept down to the minimum consistent with essential information needs. $e particularly wish to draw your attention to the need to reduce the supplies of Technical, Scientific, Medical and cultural periodicals. It is normally one of the British Council's functions to supply such matericial, and where there are local Representatives of the Council those officers should be responsible for any distribution of such speciali sed publications to specialist recipients. We note that in several areas Informationjr Officers continue to receive quantities of these journals - not for their Reading Rooms, but for distribution to outside bodies. They are, in fact, sometimes given to the British Council Representative to distribute. When your amendments are submitted we expect to see many of these publications either completely eliminated from your demands or, at any rate, drastically reduced in volume. Wherever possible, former recipients of 'free” material should be encouraged to take out subscriptions - either direct with the publisher or through their local retail agencies. Where continued supply of these specialised publications is* requested an explanation of the circumstances should be given.The same principle must be applied in the case of the more technical trade journals which are designed for a specialist class of reader. Journals of this kind are in general not suitable for use in Information reading rooms, and their distribution to individuals and institutions is in our view more properly undertaken by the Board of Trade (either by direct despatch or by distribution through Commercial Diplomatic Officers) rather than by Information Officers. You should therefore examine your lists carefully fro'*] this point of view, and list separately those periodica] which come into this category, so that we can take the mattei up with the Board of Trade. ¥ Your requirements for 1950 will be reviewed in London by ourselves in consultation with your Regional Information department and, subject to financial considerations, we hope to fulfil your needs. As a result of this review, we also hope that alterations of your requirements during 1950 will be kept to the minimum of urgent necessities, since the work involved in continual small adjustments of orders from all over the world is immence. Regarding methods pf despatch, we recognise that unless newspapers and certain weekly political reviews reach you with urgency, they are almost useless. At the same time air space is limited by priorities and inordinately expensive. You should therefore out down your requirements by air to such as are absolutely necessary and have a reason- able chance of reaching you in time for actual use in In ormation work. Air mall despatch is only used in very exceptional circumstances and then only if financial approval is given. Wherever possible we avoid using this very expen sive service. The balance of your requirements, for back ground and reference use, will, in most cases, have to come by surface route, since expenditure on bag services is being curtailed. ^ »Ve should be grateful, therefore, if you would bear all these points in mind when reviewing your supplies and let us have your revised lists at the earliest possible moment.

Kef. : WAB/KAT TELEPHONE KEYNSHAM 3248 CA BLES KEECONARC KEYNSHAM The Secretary, Office of the British Political Agent, We have pleasure in sending you the enclosed details of KBESING 1 S CONTEMPORARY ARCHIVES,.the work of reference on current affairs which enjoys a great reputation in Governmental and Diplomatic Circles not only in this country but throughout the world. The main characteristic of KEESING * S is the fact that it can never be out of date because a fresh issue is added to its contents every week to keep the reference data constantly abreast of the latest developments. As we furnish a large number of our issues every week in bulk to the Central Office of Information and other Government Departments we are not sure whether your office already receives our material from that supply. In that case we should be much obliged if you would keep the enclosed literature on file in case enquiries regarding a service such as/^rurs should reach you from outside quarters. If, on the other hand, your office still lacks KEESING 1 S we hope that you will find the descriptive literature of sufficient interest to consider the question of placing a requisition for our current volume and ensuing service, which can be sent by airmail if required. Should you prefer to test our work before taking a definite decision, please do not hesitate to let us know, so that we can submit an inspection copy of KEESING’S to you on approval without, of course, any cost or obligation on your part. Yours faithfully, KEESING 1 S ITED. Publicity Manager.i ' : ’ •' ' - ; \ * THE DIARY * GENERAL. Keesing’s is a “ News-plus-Reference ” service record ing in scholarly manner the informative part of the World’s Press in condensed reports, fully indexed. It is issued each week in loose-leaf editions and is sent to subscribers by post or (upon special arrangement) case, specially constructed to hold two-and-a-half years’ output of between 1,500 and 2,000 pages. SCOPE OF SERVICE. Keesing’s service covers the da^*o-day developments in National and International Politics, Economics, Industry, Commerce, State Finance, Defence, Social Questions, Religious Life, Education, etc. It regularly presents extensive summaries, or verbatim accounts, of all important International Treaties, Charters, and Conferences, as well as the major pronouncements ot the world’s statesmen and other leading personages. The outstanding events in the realms of Art, Science, Sport, etc., are also recorded. Miscellaneous items of general importance dealing with such varied subjects as Aviation, Expeditions, Discoveries, Conferences, Trade Unions, Technical Developments, Agriculture, Medicine, Law—to mention but a few—are to be found week by week SELECTION OF REPORTS. Keesing’ s —non-partisan, inde pendent, and therefore unbiased—derives the material for its service from the official Government Information Departments and the recognised International News Agencies, as well as from a chosen number of the world’s leading Daily, Weekly and Monthly Publications. In recording events in each country KEESING’S applies the principle of utilising as far as possible that particular country’s own sources of information, thus not only greatly widening the range of reports but also ensuring the greatest degree of authenticity. After verification, careful scrutiny and counter checking, only those items are selected which are established facts and proven events of permanent importance. All salient points—stripped of journalistic phraseology and trimmings—are then condensed, while the non-English excerpts are translated into English from many languages. For every report the sources of origin are clearly stated. by airmail. The loose leaves are slotted to slip easily into a sturdy bindingKEESING’S established in 1931 in London ettet* ucu r THREE SOUND SAFEGUARDS ABSOLUTEI AUTHENTICITY - free from bias or inaccuracy - is ensured through fifteen years’ experience in sifting and verifying all data, minutely checked by a staff of experts under the supervision of a board of eminent advisers. PERFECT PRODUCTION and durability, designed tor incessant daily use in : and institutional libraries as a permanent record of present-day history. RAPID REFERENCE —as simple as the alphabet itself—to every entry in the diary, no matter whether it was recorded fourteen years or a fortnight ago . Printed in Great Britain— THE INDEX INDISPENSABLE FOR REFERENCE PURPOSES. Keesing’s copyright “ living ” Index is the most prominent feature of the service, for by virtue of its indexing system KEESING’S is a Work of Reference which can never be out of date. CUMULATIVE CHARACTER. Every other week KEESING’S diary sheets are accompanied by an Index (coloured green) which— recompiled fortnightly to incorporate the latest items—is cumulative and replaces its predecessor. Every quarter the last of these fort nightly indices is to be discarded, for its contents are embodied in a Quarterly Index (coloured yellow) which tabulates all items so far published in the volume. This procedure is continued until the com pletion of the volume, each new index incorporating the contents of the index previously issued. Thus at the end of each complete cycle the total contents of each volume—comprising approx. 15,000 reports—are tabulated in one single Index. ALPHABETICAL COMPILATION. The indices are arranged alphabetically and give for each item, under all its appro priate main-headings, a brief abstract together with page number and paragraph letter of the report. CROSS-INDEX. Apart from being “ gazetted ” in the alphabeti cal index, the items are linked together by means of a Cross-Index. At the end of each report reference is made to the page number of the previous entry dealing with the same or cognate subjects. This makes it possible to trace back the development of every item from the most recent to the very earliest event (throughout the seven volumes) without referring to the alphabetical index at all.« KEESING’S The Reference Tool of our day\ Annual Subscription Keesing’s is obtainable only on subscription terms. These are £4.13.9t a year (representing the pre-war subscription rate of £3.15.0 plus 25% surcharge instituted in 1943). The subscription year runs from tha 1st July to 30th June.

Sir Hugh O’Neill (Ulster Unionist) called the secession of Southern Ireland “ a disaster the repercussions of which on the structure of the British Commonwealth of Nations might have far-reaching an^ injurious effects.” He insisted that the case for partition was uni)*aMilU^ legally, constitutionally, and morally ; that talk of a unite(M»*l|lld was to a large extent “ a chimera of the imagination ” ^*ai*Ltmit the only union which could exist would be that attained mieBii Southern Ireland again decided to enter the constitutional stn^^rjj# of the British Isles. Expressing concern that the tactics use?F&amp;gainst Ulster in 1920-22—the assassination of prominent leapor^-fcnd policemen, terrorist bomb outrages, and the malicious burning of public offices and private houses—might be repeated, he wufflfced that if the Northern Ireland Government had to take counter-measures their action would be “ firm and relentless ”. Mr. Bglargy (Lab.), on the other hand, appealed to the Government to wiuidraw the guarantee to Northern Ireland, which he called “ a piece of sheer political affrontery ”, and Prof. Gruffydd (L.) also called &amp;U' the Bill’s withdrawal, saying that “ to the Irish it is an offence arm to the English a folly.” The present Bill, he said, did not contain a solution to the difficulty which would arise if an Irishman* was fleeted to the House of Commons, for how could a man sw^ir^hlifeiance to the Republic of Ireland and to the King of Britain.atflhe same time? Mr. McGhee (Lab.) supported the withdil|wal of the guarantee to Northern Ireland, appealing to the Govefflfcent for “ one more act of statesmanship ” to bring about mediation between Northern and Southern Ireland in the same way as (gfey had done in India. Mr. Haire (Lab.), who said he had lived in wfeland for more than 30 years, declared, on the other hand, that heJEhtl not believe that the language used in the Bail represented the m«tad of the Southern Irish people. In face of a threat to force Northern Ireland out of the Commonwealth, thousands would rally to dggpnd the retention of the border and their right to self-deter- ininatXon. He hoped that both Northern and Southern Ireland would eWnmally find themselves associated in a wider integration than thll/of Ireland alone—that they would find community of purpose m Western European union. Mr. McGovern (Lab.) declared that Xj, $&lt;-' bad a fundamental objection to the clause that stabilised “ one iM %^the most reactionary and oppressive Governments in Western ^Europe ” and “ made permanent the rule of tyranny ”, adding that f jy wwas “criminal for a Labour Government to hand Northern Ireland * to this junta.” Mr. Beattie (Ind. Lab.), the member for West Belfast, supported by Mr. Mulvey (Irish Nat.), moved the rejection of the Bill, which he declared was “ a sowing of dragons’ teeth ” and “ the greatest gift to Toryism in Ireland since the Black and Tans,” but Sir William Neill (U.U.), the Lord Mayor of Belfast, declared that it gave Northern Ireland the protection she desired and deserved, and that threats of force and propaganda would not solve the Irish problem, whilst Sir Ronald Ross (U.U.) described the “ attempt to bully the British Parliament ” as “ one of the most ill-conceived gestures that Mr. Costello has yet achieved.” Sir David Maxwell Fyfe (C.) thought that the granting of a special position to Eire citizens was right, and that there was “ no other country in the world which at a critical moment in her history would have the faith and courage to take so difficult a course ”. He declared, however, that “ there are colder and fiercer gales of the world beating on both Britain and Ireland, in the face of which we ought to stand together in defence of the heritage of Western civilization ”, and appealed to Eire for closer friendship, and co-operation and for getting rid of the “ old, unhappy, far-off things.” Mr. Herbert Morrison (Lord President of the Council), winding up the debate, reiterated that “ we could not be parties in taking the initiative and urging Northern Ireland to leave the U.K. and the Commonwealth ”, which would be “ an unthinkable course that would not be approved by any British electorate ”, and emphasized that Northern Ireland must retain its own right of decision. If Irishmen got together and made agreements among themselves, Britain would consider the situation, but it was no part of the Government’s business to take the initiative to diminish the territory of the United Kingdom. Nobody had coerced the Government to put in the Bill the guarantee to Northern Ireland. They included it because they thought it was right. The Government should be given credit for what they had done in accepting the decision of Eire to withdraw from the Commonwealth. There wore not many Govern ments in the world that would have done that, nor many Parliaments that would have “ swallowed it ” with the speed of this Parliament. The Government, he concluded, could not accept suggestions that the Bill should be withdrawn or postponed. The motion for the rejection of the Bill was negatived by 817 votes to 12 and the Bill read a second time. Those voting against the Bill consisted of 12 Labour members (Mr. Stokes, Mr. Skeffington-Lodge, Mr. Beattie, Mr. Delargy, Mr. Skeffington, Mr. McGovern, Mr. Mellish, Mr. Neil Maclean, Mr. S. O. Davies, and Mr. Gunter) and 2 Communists (Mr. Gallacher and Mr. Piratin), the tellers being Mr. Mulvey and Mr. Cunningham, the Irish Nationalist members for Tyrone and Fermanagh. Those voting for the Bill were 251 Labour members, 56 Conservatives and Ulster Unionists, 6 Liberal Nationals, and 4 Independents. All the Liberals abstained, whilst about 140 Labour members were not present at the division. During the Committee stage, which was taken on May 16, a number of Labour members voted against the Government in support of various amendments. Mr. Beattie (Ind. Lab.) moved the deletion of that paragraph of the Bill which declares that Northern Ireland remains part of H.M. Dominions and of the United Kingdom, and affirms that in no event will Northern Ireland, or any part thereof, cease to be part of the U.K. or of H.M. Dominions without the consent of the N.I. Parlia ment. He declared that the paragraph, as it stood, would “ destroy every reasonable opportunity of bringing Ireland, unified and united, into being again ” ; affirmed that the effect of this provision would be to hand over the Six Counties to “ permanent minority rule ” and keep them as a “ perquisite for the Northern Irish Tories ” ; and urged that the Governments of the Republic of Ireland and of Northern Ireland should take a plebiscite under the supervision of the British House of Commons. Colonel Haughton (U.U.) said that he had visited Dublin during the week-end and that, in the speeches and newspaper articles, there was a complete absence of any reference to the assurance which Mr. Attlee had twice given to the British Parliament regarding Northern Ireland ; the “ grimmest part ” of his visit, he said, was that he had seen posters in Dublin bearing the words “ Arm now to take the North.” Mr. Gage (U.U.) declared that the provisions of the Ireland Bill were welcomed in Ulster “ not only by the wealthy, privileged classes but by the ordinary working folk ”, and declared that Southern Ireland was considerably more of a “ stronghold of Toryism ” than the North, having had in the past 20 years “ some of the most reactionary governments in Europe.” Dr. Morgan (Lab.), supporting Mr. Beattie’s amendment, expressed the opinion that the rate of increase in the Roman Catholic population of Ulster was such that in 10 or 20 years there would be an overwhelming vote in favour of amalgamation with the South. Among other mem bers speaking in opposition to the Bill were Mr. Logan (Lab.) and Mr. Asterley Jones (Lab.), whilst support for the Bill came from Mr. Bramall (Lab.), Mr. Raikes (C.), Colonel Crosthwaite-Eyre (0.) and Major Harden (U.U.). Mr. Chuter Ede, the Home Secretary, reiterated that the situation ! created was not of Britain’s seeking, and added : “ This Bill would I not have been before the House but for the action of Mr. Costello I in severing the last link with the British Commonwealth. He has . . . made the question of the unity of Ireland more difficult than it has ever been before by his action When a claim is made that a certain State is the Republic of Ireland, which may be misunderstood by some people as meaning the whole of the island of Ireland, it it is essential to make it plain that there is a part of that island which is not included in the Republic. The Government regard that declaration as essential, but we do not regard it as being of necessity’ the final decision with regard to this matter.” If Irish unity were to be attained on the basis of the demands of the South, said Mr. Ede. it would be at the price of Northern Ireland going out of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth; the Bill, however, assured the people of Northern Ireland that they could not be put out of the Commonwealth without their own consent. Referring to Colonel Haughton’s speech, Mr. Ede said that if the paragraph to which Mr. Beattie objected had not been necessary before, it would have been justified by the posters that had appeared in Dublin during the past 48 hours, and added : “ It is essential that Parliament should make it quite clear that while it will welcome anything that, as a result of reasoned argument, may bring the two parts of Ireland together, what we cannot countenance is anything that attempts to secure the unity of Ireland by the threat of force on one side or the I other.” In reply to an interjection by Mr. Mulvey (Irish Nat.), who declared that only two-thirds of the people of Northern Ireland i wished to remain in the United Kingdom, Mr. Ede said : “ We cannot accept the position that because one-third objects, therefore the two-thirds must accept the point of view of the one-thirc On a division, Mr. Beattie’s amendment was defeated by 3ao votes to 21—Government majority 324. Mr. Asterley Jones (Lab.) then moved an amendment to delete the Northern Ireland Parlia ment’s consent being required before any part of the North ceased to- be a part of the United Kingdom, this being also rejected by 324 votes to 48—Government majority 276. Mr. Leslie Hale (Lab.) followed with a third amendment which sought to reword the relevant section of the Bill so as to make the consent of the “ people ” of Northern Ireland, and not the “ Parliament ” of Northern Ireland, necessary to any change in the constitutional position of the North ; after Mr. Herbert Morrison had described the amendment as “ unwise and impossible of interpretation ”, it was defeated by 312 votes to Government majority’ 258. The 54 members voting against the Government on this latter amendment—including the tellers— comprised 47 Labour members (Mr. A. Anderson, Mr. Barton, Mr. Beswick, Mr. Bing, Mr. Blyton, Mrs. Braddock, Mr. Braddock, Dr. Comyns, Mr. Rhys Davies, Mr. S. O.

Roberts and Lady Megan Lloyd George), 2 Irish Nationalists (Mr. Mulvey and Mr. Cunningham), 2 Independent Labour members (Mr. Beattie and Mr. Pritt), and Mr. Gallacher (Comm.). Those supporting the Government (including tellers) comprised 208 Labour members, 99 Conservatives (including 7 Ulster Unionists), 3 Independents, 3 Liberal Nationals, and a Liberal. Despite a three-line whip issued prior to the Committee stage, between 130 and 140 Labour members abstained from voting on the divisions, whilst 63 Labour members voted against the Government, some on one division only, some on two, and some on all three, as set forth below : *9998 KEESING S CONTEMPORARY ARCHIVES May 14—21, 1949.

Mr. Eden (C.), who described the third reading as “ a melancholy occasion,” spoke as follows : “ Patience is the strongest ally of states manship. ... If we can show ourselves patient in these events, perhaps our reward will come later on. My chief regret is that it is making it more difficult for North and South to come together, which is the solution the ordinary Englishman would most like to see. That is a pity, but nothing is unalterable in time, and maybe changes will come about that will make it possible. If only in Dublin they will Understand the spirit in which this House has sought to deal with this Bill, I feel that much of their recent eloquence would not have to be repeated. Maybe if they could capture the tone which these poor limited English can sometimes contrive to produce their Celtic brilliance might be tempered by the thought that perhaps the people with whom they do not agree have a point of view too.” It was officially announced in London on May 12 that the police guard in Downing Street had been issued with arms as a special security precaution against possible acts of violence arising out of the situation created by the Ireland Bill.—(Times - Daily Telegraph - Manchester Guardian) (Prev. rep. Ireland Bill, 9979 A; Dail Protest, 9993 A.) A. GERMANY. — Self-Government for Western Berlin. - Abolition of Veto Power in Kommandatura. The three Western Commandants in Berlin signed on May 14 a new charter, which came into immediate effect, granting wide legislative, executive, and judicial powers to the City Assembly of Western Berlin, and extending to the City Assembly a similar measure of responsibility to that conferred on the German Parliamentary Council in Bonn by the Occupation Statute for Western Germany. Under this charter, the City Assembly will become largely responsible for all day-to-day administration in Western Berlin, with the exception of certain specified powers reserved to the Allied Kommandatura in respect of such matters as disarmament and demilitarization, reparations, currency and credit policy, banking and foreign tr ide, the protection and security of the Allied forces and their employees, relations with authorities abroad, and supervision of the police, in the last-named case “ because of the special circumstances prevailing in the city.” The announcement added that it had been furthermore agreed to abolish the power of veto hitherto held by each member of the Kommandatura, and that the decisions of that body would henceforth be taken by majority vote. At a press conference given the same day by the Western Commandants, Brig.-Gen. Howley (the U.S. Commandant) described the neu r charter as “ a tremendously important step towards making the unity of Berlin possible if the people on the other side of the town desire it,” whilst General Bourne (the British Commandant) emphasized that Russia w r ould have to accept the abolition of the veto power in the Kommandatura if she desired a return to four-Power control of the city.

UNITED STATES. — Mr. McCloy appointed American High Commissioner in Germany. A statement from the White House on May 18 announced that President Truman had appointed Mr. John J. McCloy, president of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, as American High Commissioner in Germany, and that Mr. McCloy would resign his post on the International Bank with effect from July 1. The statement added that Mr. McCloy would take up his appoint ment in Germany “ on or about the time of the establishment of a German Provisional Government ” ; that one of his first considera tions would be to work out plans for the transfer of responsibility for non-military aspects of U.S. occupation policy from the Army to the State Dept, and the Economic Co-operation Administration ; that he would be the supreme U.S. authority in Germany, under the immediate supervision and direction of the Secretary of State, exercising all governmental functions other than command of the U.S. occupation forces : that he would represent the U.S.A. on the Allied High Commission for Germany set up under the Occupation Statute ; and that ho would represent the E.C.A. in Germany under the supervision of Mr. Paul Hoffman and Mr. Averell Harriman. 1 It was also stated that although the U.S. military commander in j Germany would continue to receive instructions from the Joint ! Chiefs of Staff, Mr. McCloy would have authority to direct the com manding general to “ intervene for the maintenance of law and order and to take such other action as is required to support U.S. policy iu Germany,” and that, pending the transfer of Military Government responsibility to the State Dept., he would serve in the interim as Military Governor of the U.S. Zone in succession to General Clay, under the immediate supervision of the Defence Secretary and the President. Mr. McCloy ( 54 ), who was born in Philadelphia, studied law' at the Harvard Law School, was admitted to the New' York Bar in 1921 , practised in New York and Paris, and in 1941 became special assistant to Mr. Henry L. Stimson when the latter was Secretary for War, having in this capacity special authority over the War Dept, political policy in Europe. On resigning this post in 1945 j he returned to his law practice, which he left on his subsequent appointment as president of the International Bank. Mr. McCloy is a member of the Republican Party. It was announced on the same day (May 18 ) that Mr. Eugene I Black, of Atlanta, Georgia, had been nominated by President Truman as president of the International Bank (of which he is a director) in succession to Mr. McCloy.—(New r York Herald Tribune) (Prev. rep. 9966 A ; General Clay, 9970 B.) D. CANADA. — Long-Term Plan for Ottawa. The Canadian Premier, Mr. St. Laurent, presented to the Federal Parliament on April 29 a long-term “ master plan ” for the enlargement and replanning of Ottawa as the national capital, drawn up after 2 £ years’ study by M. Jacques Greber (a well-known French specialist in town planning, and con sultant to the Canadian Government), assisted by Canadian architects and experts. The plan, which Is endorsed by the National Capital Planning Committee, envisages the creation of a “ national capital area ” or Federal District extending over 900 square miles of Ontario and Quebec, and the extensive replanning and modernization of Ottawa itself for a maximum population of 500,000 (the present population is 250 , 000 ). Features of the plan are proposals for the location of future Government buildings and national institutions in attractive surroundings ; the creation of “ green belts ” to protect the natural beauties of the area and prevent undesirable commercial exploita tion ; the provision of additional roads and scenic parkways; the re-location of railways; the enlargement of Gatineau Park (the summer and winter “ playground ” of the capital) from its present 24,000 acres ; and zoned industrial areas. The suburb of Hull, on the north (Quebec) side of the .St. Lawrence opposite Ottawa, is included in the replanning scheme. It was pointed out in Ottawa that the project, if adopted, ■would take many years to accomplish, and that it would involve the agreement and approval of the Federal Government, the Provincial Governments of Ontario and Quebec, the civic government of Ottawa, and the many smaller municipalities affected.—(Montreal Daily Star) E. UNITED KINGDOM. — Cotton Industry. Extension of Subsidy for Modernization of Mills. The Cotton Board in Manchester announced on April 30 that the Government had agreed to extend the time-limit for placing contracts for new machinery qualifying for a 25 per cent Government subsidy under the Cotton Spinning (Re-equipment Subsidy) Act of 1948 from April 30 , 1949 , to April 6, 1950 . It was stated that in the two years since the scheme commenced only 16 firms had applied to be registered as groups, and that less than half had their actual re-equipment proposals accepted by the Cotton Board ; that the President of the Board of Trade had made it clear that no further ex tension of the new r time-limit would be possible ; and that he had also expressed the hope that quicker progress would be made in submitting plans for modernization of mills and in proceeding with their implementation.—(Board of Trade Journal - Manchester Guardian) (Prev. rep. 9320 B.)6 PAKISTAN (com.)

Keesing’s diary sheets include important statistics, tables, maps, charts, diagrams, etc., covering such subjects as Army, Navy, Air Force, Cost of Living, Foreign Trade, National Revenue and Expenditure, Population, Elections, National Savings, Ship building, Price Levels, Employment, Industrial and Agricultural Pro duction, etc. In this manner the developments during the past sixteen years are made clear and vivid, and constantly brought up to date. OUTPUT. Keesing’ s —contrary to most other publications — has never been hampered by a stereotyped rule of a fixed number of pages per week. Thus there have never been committed the sins of either “ filling space ” or “ cutting down matter.” During the frequent periods of an acute rush of important world events, KEESING’S issues are increased to as many as 20 pages per week without extra cost to the subscribers. In this policy the publishers have had the understanding support of the Government throughout the war years, even during the period of the most stringent paper control. The present average output is fourteen pages per week, amounting to approx. 5,000 reports per year. KEESING’S contains no advertisements. PUBLISHING PERIODS. Keesing’s publishing years run from the 1st July to the 30th June. KEESING’S current (seventh) volume was started on the 1st July, 1948. A limited stock of previous volumes is still available to new subscribers, (subject to confirmation), i.e., Volume VI,+ covering the period 1946-1948. Volume V,* covering the period 1943-1945. Volume IV,* covering the period 1940-1943. Volume III,* covering the period 1937-1940. Volume II, covering the period 1934-1937. (Volume I, covering the period 1931-1934 supplemented by a Synopsis of important events between 1918-1931. OUT OF PRINT). *One of the main features—which makes KEESING’S so indispens.able to anyone con cerned with the history of our time—is the exhaustive War Report which, compiled day by day from the first hour of World War II to the last, is put on record in KEESING’S Volumes 01—V. tThe first completed post-war volume can be supplied immediately from stock. New subscribers interested in the more recent developments will find it a great advantage to purchase the records from 1st January, 1946, for reference purposes.ucinc.

February 1950 Dear Friends Hundreds of letters are receired by the United Nations each month from business executives, economists, statisticians, teachers, students, and others interested in current economic conditions, inquiring about the studies and reports prepared by the United Nations Department of Economic Affairs. We have, therefore, prepared the enclosed leaflet describing the principal economic publications of the United Nations during 1949. We are sending it to you because we believe that you will find many of the titles of value and interest. As you will note. United Nations economic publications during 1949 have included surveys on world and regional economic conditions, studies on trade and employment, and reports on the program for technical assistance to economi cally under-developed areas* In 1949 the United Nations also issued the first editions of two important reference volumes, the Statistical Yearbook and the Demographic Yearbook . To report on European economy in the period between the publicat ion of the annual Economic Survey of Europe, a new periodical publication has been established - the Ec on cede Bulletin for Europe . Two important new economic studies were issued so recently that it was impossible for us to include them, in the printed leaflet. They are: EUROPEAN STEEL TRENDS IN THE SETTING OF THE WORLD MARKET (U.N.Publications Sales No. 1949.II.E.2) 148 pp. with diagrams, tables and map. $1.50, ll/- Stg. Swiss francs 6*00.

Prepared by the Economic Commission for Europe. Available in separate English and French editions. FINAL REPORT OF THE UNITED NATIONS ECONOMIC SURVEY MISSION FOR THE MIDDLE EAST (U.N. Publications Sales No. 1949.H.B*5) Part I - Final Report &amp; Appendices, 103 pp. $1.00, 7/6 Stg. Sw.fr.4.00. Part II - Technical Supplement, 74 pp. $.80, 6/- Stg., Sw.fr. 3.00. This report on economic conditions in the Middle East was prepared by the United Nations Economic Survey Mission headed by Gordon R. Clapp, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the U.S. Tennessee Valley Authority. The Mission was requested to 'make recommendations for an integrated programme ...to promote economic conditions conducive to the maintenance of peace and stability in the area.' The report recommends pilot economic development projects to be undertaken in Jordan, Arab Palestine, Lebanon and Syria. The report is now available in Ehglish. A French edition is in preparation. The prices for United Nations publications listed in the enclosed leaflet have been quoted for convenience in U.S. dollars, pounds sterling and Swiss francs, but any of the books and periodicals may be purchased in other national currencies from the authorized Sales Agents for United Nations publications. A list of the Sales Agents appears in the printed leaflet. Sincerely yours. William C.
