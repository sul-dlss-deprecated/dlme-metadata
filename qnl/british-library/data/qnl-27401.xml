The Government of India are no doubt aware that there is a great deal of direct trade between J4ukalla and Arabian Gulf ports, Zanzibar, Pombass and Indian ports by dho*&amp;, and sometimes by ships, and it would greatly inconvenience those persons, or crews of dhows who fall ill and remain behind, if they all were to come to Aden to obtain British identity documents for purposes of travel.
