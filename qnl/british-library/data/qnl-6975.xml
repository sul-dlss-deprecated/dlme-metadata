B 353. I4J % ARABIA. Question oi Future Policy, Subsidies to Chiefs, &amp;c. * Notes by Political Department, India Office. Recent telegrams from Sir P. Cox on the subject of Ibn Sa'ud scarcely admit of answer without reference . to the general policy of His Majesty's Government with regard to the bigger chiefs of the Arabian peninsula. It would be inadvisable for example and is probably impracticable, to decide whether Ibn Sa'ud should receive an annual subsidy, and what the amount should be, without a simultaneous consideration of the casss of other big chiefs, even though it were to be generally admitted that his n end ship is of the value to us represented by Sir P. Cox in his telegrams or by Major Ihckson m his note on the political situation in Najd. It maybe assumed that His Majesty s Government are not prepared to support or interest themselves in one only of these chiefs. On that assumption, a subsidy to Ibn Sa'ud would seem to involve subsidies to other chiefs also. Supposing this were so, His Majesty's Govern ment would then find it necessary to discover some measure of value to ouide the distribution of their grants-in-aid. \ arious circumstances would then determine our policy. The chief considerations would be perhaps previous commitments on the one hand and present value on the other. These two considerations might be, so far as concerns particular individuals, contradictory as in the case of Hussain, or not contradictory as in the case of Ibn Sa'ud. But Arab politics change so rapidly that there is no certainty that contradictions may not arise and disappear in a month or two. There is one chief in the peninsula who has hitherto embarrassed us very little by his friendship, and this element has been, and may still be, the most powerful of all—that is, Ibn Rashid. One cannot afford to ignore Ibn Rashid's great name—probably the biggest in the peninsula—and his striking successes on important occasions in the field against Ibn Sa'ud. Hussain is almost without importance in comparison, and it must be remembered that any success which Hussain might win through alliance with Ibn Rashid would redound to Ibn Rashid's, not to Hussain's, profit. Is it to be envisaged that we may one day have to buy Ibn Rashid's friendship? He is the neighbour of the Euphrates tribes and the Dhafir, and the friend of Shaikh Salim of Kuwait. From the point of view, therefore, of our commitments in Mesopotamia, it might seem more profitable to buy his friendship in preference to that of Ibn Sa'ud. Since, however, as an enemy with a subsidy from the Turks he never harmed us, the question of a subsidy for him in a possible future chain of circumstances cannot be considered pressing.' But he is between Mesopotamia and Ibn Sa'ud. From the point of view of Mesopotamia, then, could there be any justification for a subsidy to Ibn ^ 1 ll( But there are other ways in which Ibn Sa'ud's friendship is of importance. There is Eastward, the Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf. The Government of India in their wire to Sir P. Cox about the danger of making too much of Saiyid Talib' emphasised this point. And there is. Westward, his power for harm in the Hediaz at Mecca and Jeddah, because it is quite clear that if he wished he could capture Tail and Mecca, and probably Jeddah. His friendship with the Idnsi makes T-^nt what of Hussain and our commitments to him and the Hedjaz, and his .crvices or services in his name, to the Allies during the war, and the necessity of seiMpes, o Muhammadan world? It could scarcely be Sdfdt a BaXtory motLd of yarding Mecca to pay ibn Sa'ud not to take it t+ inf nF course certain that the Ikhwan seriously have designs on Mecca. If it It is not, o ' - - - interests to break rather than make Ibn Sa ud, and 11 iS T/widT^robably be to our interests to break rattier tnan maKe ion oa ua, anu S DXonCserts that a stoppage of his subsidy wonld break h™. In any case „ld have thought that the mere suggestion on his part that if «e fad to comply ''tVMs w,shls he may not be able to control 1ns men should be met w.th a rebuke. I l h , :Tbn Sa-ud and the Ikhwan can take Mecca but probably dare not because ^ that such an act would involve them in a struggle with combined powerful Cher north which they could not hope to resist. From this point ot view, ? rC doubtful how far a subsidy then, it is 2547 is necessary at all. 40 11/20!

Then there is Faisal, who presumably will hav r e to be fitted in somehow, lie might conceivably take his father's place, and it would appear reasonable to ask both Hussain and Faisal to interest themselves in their own country in preference to /meddling in the affairs of countries with which they have prima Jade no concern. The question of previous commitments, however, adds an irritating complication to /their case, and it would be well for His Majesty's Government to make up their ^ minds what exactly these commitments amount to, and how far they are now prepared to carry them into effect in the face of French action in Syria, French suspicions of Faisal, and hostile intrigues on the part of Hussain and Faisal. One cannot acquit Faisal, for example, of tacit acquiescence in the co-operation of his Mesopotamiana with the rebels in Mesopotamia. The annoying feature of the Hedjaz situation is, thus, that there is a strong case for a subsidy in the interests of Mecca and Medina and the pilgrim routes, but there is no one to whom we can assign a subsidy with sufficient assurance that it will not be used against us, and that it will not be interpreted by the Moslems of India as dangerous and unwarranted interference in Muhammadan affairs. Then there are the cases of the Idrisi and Hussain on the one side and the Idrisi and the Imam on the other to crown the general complexity of affairs. As regards the Idrisi, he has recently expressed his expectation that His Majesty's Government will settle the Qunfidhah question ; and in view of the past historv of the case it may be difficult for us to decline. All these considerations make it difficult to devise a suitable policy We are committed too far to leave the situation to find its own equilibrium ' The onlv a ternative would seem to be to assemble all the big chiefs together, not excluding , Kashid if he would consent to come, and ask them to form some kind of confederation by agreement among themselves, and devise the strongest safeguard for Mecca, in which they are all interested. The occasion might then be taken lecturing them all on Bolshevist and other intrigues, whose objects are undonbted^ to the interests of Arabia as a whole.
