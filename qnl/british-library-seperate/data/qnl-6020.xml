The file is a direct chronological continuation of File 94/1915 Pt 1 ‘German War:- Turkey. Prisoners’ (IOR/L/PS/10/532). The file covers: reports of the release and deportation to Mosul of the remaining British women and children held at Baghdad; the decision to extradite these women and children to Beirut and the Mediterranean, rather than down the river Tigris to the Persian Gulf; requests from the Ottoman Government for information of a number of Turkish officials and their families detained at Amara; lists of British and Turkish prisoners of war to be exchanged by both sides; the General Officer Commanding at Basra’s objections to the repatriation of some Turkish officials from Basra.Several items in the volume (correspondence from the Ottoman Government and the Comité Internationale de la Croix-Rouge) are in French.The file includes a divider which gives the subject number, the year the subject file was opened, the subject heading, and a list of correspondence references by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Prisoners of War</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>United States Federal Government</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of the Ottoman Empire</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Commander of the Mesopotamia Expeditionary Force</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Mesopotamia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Baghdad</geographic></subject><subject><topic>First World War (1914-1918)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Mesopotamian Campaign (1914-1918)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0001ad#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0001ad#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0001ad#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0001ad#share">Copyright or data protection restrictions</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
