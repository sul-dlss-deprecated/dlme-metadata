Bakaia^ce,.- - h.2.Sw Dear Sir, In connection with its operations, the Company is considering alternative methods of softening water. One of the processes under consideration requires fairly large quan tities of salt. During the past few years the Company has obtained quantities of salt (about two or three tons a day) from salt basins located a few miles south of the town of Zellaq, the salt being mined by local inhabitants acting in the capacity of contractors and using the crudest methods involving scraping up the salt from the surface of the naturally existing evaporation ponds. To obtain the necessary quantities of salt for the proposed new scheme it will be necessary to expend a considerable amount of money on installations at the salt ponds area involving drainage canals, concrete lined evaporation ponds, pumps, roads, etc. It is the opinion of our geologists that there is an ample supply of salt obtainable in the area above-mentioned enough to last for many 1 years at the increased rate of consumption. Before proceeding further with our consideration of this problem we desire to know whether or not the area involved is Government land or privately owned and whether there are any existing rights to this salt deposit heM by others. I discussed this question briefly with Mr. Belgrave over the telephone yesterday morning. Yours very ty\s\ W. P.

Memor andum: - With reference to your Printed Letter No.C/790 dated 7th August 1945, enclosing a letter from the Chief Local Representative, Bapco, regarding the use of salt. The salt basins on the coast beyond Zellaq are Governinent property. In the past the Government has refused to give concessions for this salt to various people who have asked for them. Salt is removed from the area by the public, especially the people of Zellaq, who take it to Manama on donkeys and sell it in the bazaar. There are no restrictions on the use of tlB salt. Before any definite decision is made I think His Highness should be informed about the project but the question is now only under consideration I am not at present raisin^ the matter with him.
