The correspondents are the Foreign Office, the War Office, and the Acting Consul-General (Alexander Knox Helm).A list of the arms and ammunition can be found at folios 16-17. The Consul-General advises that the material falls into four categories: property of HMG or the Government of India; property belonging to Europeans who have left Ethiopia; property left behind by persons who took refuge in the Legation in May 1936; and miscellaneous. The possibility of handing the material over to the Italian authorities is discussed, as is the difficulty of disposing of 500 rounds of 'dum-dum' ammunition left by the refugees. The Foreign Office decision is recorded in a letter at folio 4.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the end of the correspondence (folio 1).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>War Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Consul-General, Addis Ababa</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Addis Ababa</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Weapons</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0002ed#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
