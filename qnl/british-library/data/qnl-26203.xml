Ref HB/PS/3156, 1st November, 1933. Bear Bertram, I am sorry to see from your letter of the 30th Octooer that the Persians are complaining that our aircraft regularly fly over Jask. I am, therefore, immediately writing to our Managers in Egypt and India, calling their attention to this and asking them to arrange for the necessary instructions to be given to the pilots to fly well outside the 3 mile limit of Persian territorial waters. There are, I believe, already instructions to this effect in force, but I have not an actual copy in this ofl'ica I will, however, ask the Managers concerned to let me know what standing instructions they have issued. fours sincerely.

According to your letter referred to above you have advieed Imperial Airways to ensure that their machines do not regularly fly over Persian territorial waters. We thin* it would be much better if they were instructed in the sense suggested by kallet vis. that their machines should never fly over Persian territory or territorial waters, unless the safety of the aircraft were involved.

My dear George Your despatch No. 30£ of July 21st (E 3760/11/91) Plights by Imperial Airways machines orer Persia. 2. We gather from this despatch that the position is that, up till April 20th, 1934, we can claim a right for the company^ machines to maAe occasional flights over Persian territory or territorial waters under the terms of the International Air Navigation Convention, while after April 20th, 1934, the most we could claim, and that very dubiously, would be a right for the machines to make occasional flights over Persian territorial waters only on the analogy of the custom of the sea. 3. We wish, if possible, to avoid a dispute witn the Persian Government as to the interpretation of the Convention, seeing that in this case its validity has so short a time to run. As for the general principles of international law which will alone be relevant after April 20th next, it can be taken for granted that the Persian Government would never be the first to accept any proposition about the right of innocent passage for aircraft over territorial waters: it would be necessary to show that some other State had accepted /the G.W.Rendel, Esq., C.M.G., The Foreign Office.the proposition beforehand. 4. In these oiroumstanoes t a non-committal reply, of which a copy is enclosed, has been sent to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, who have been pressing for an answer. We should explain, however, that the use of the word 'regularly” is slightly Jesuitical. It is rendered possible by the fact that the Ministry, when pressed for details as to dates, etcetera, have always replied 'Oh, they fly over Jask every week', and is designed to leave room for further argument on the lines of your despatch if the Persian complaints are repeated. But at the same time it is obvious that the burden of these complaints is not that the machines fly over Jask 'regularly', but that they fly over Jask at all. 5. The likelihood of further complaints will, however, depend upon how Imperial Airways themselves interpret the word 'regularly', and we cannot help feeling that it would be more satisfactory if they were to instruct their pilots never to fly over Persian territory or territorial waters, particularly near a town like Jask, unless the safety of the aircraft were involved. This is the only sure way of avoiding constant friction. 6. There is, moreover, one great objection to bringing the French and Dutch air lines into the picture and that is that if we do so the Persian Government may withdraw the permission granted to these companies to fly down the Persian coast (they only continued this permission, with much hesitation, after our own withdrawal, in view of our reservation that we should claim the same rights as /otherother foreign air lines in the event of the Arab ooast route proving unsatisfactory). In that case the /ranch and Dutch would again raise the question of flying down the Arab ooast, which is presumably the last thing we want. 7.

Sir, i am commanded by the Air Council to acquaint you, for the information of the Secretary of State for foreign Affairs, that Imperial Airways have asked if permission could be obtained from the Persian Government for their aircraft, in cases of emergency, to make use of the aerodrome at jask on the p ersian Gulf. 2. The reason for this request is that it has been hitherto impossible to find a suitable emergency landing ground on the east side of the Oman Peninsula which could be used on occasions when the aircraft encountered exceptional strong head winds on the westward flight from Karachi to Sharjah. 3. i am to add that, on a few occasions against adverse wind conditions, imperial Airways* aircraft have reached Sharjah on the flight from Karachi with only a small margin of fuel left, 4. it is expected that Jask would only be used on very rare occasions. 5. i am accordingly to request that, if Sir John Simon concurs, the Persian Government may be asked to permit imperial Airways* aircraft to make use of the aerodrome at jask in cases of real emergency. 1 am.

Simon to request you to inform the Air Council he sees serious political objections to approaching the Persian Government in the sense proposed* 2. It will be recalled that when the decision was taken to transfer the air route to the Arabian coast of the Persian His i-ajeaty’s Government were actuated to a great extent by the desire to make it olear to the Persian Government that they were not dependent on Persia for the continuance of Imperial air oomrauni eat ions with India* In the interdepartmental discussions which took place before the transfer, it was generally agreed that if an Imperial Airways machine were driven by stress of weather to make an emergency landing on the Persian coast, the Arslan Government, as a civilised Power, ooxild not well create difficulties. Clearly, however, to seek a general permission, officially and in advance, for all future emergency landings at a given Persian aerodrome, woulu be tantamount to an admission that His Majesty's Government are after all dependent on the favours of the Persian Governraent in this matter, a course which Sir John liiaon moat strongly deprecates on political grounds. 3, I am to suggest, for the consideration of the Air Counoil/ The Secretary Of t&amp;e Air Ministryci9 Council, that in these circumstances arrangements might he made for the aircraft of Imperial Airways to refill with petrol at Qwadur in oaeee where the direct flight from Karachi to iiharjah or ▼ice rerea cannot he accomplished with the requisite margin of safety* 4* In thie connexion I am to transmit to you herewith, to be laid before the Air Council, the accompanying copy of a despatch from Mis Majesty's Minister at Tehran, reporting that he has received private complaints from the lersian Government to the effect that Imperial Airways machines regularly fly over ersian territory in the neighbourhood of Jaak* I am to suggest that, if the Air Council see no objection. Imperial Airways Limited should he informed that their machines should avoid flying over any part of the Persian coast, unless actually in distress* Nor, in air John Simon's view, should their aircraft fly over Persian territorial waters, unless the right of innocent passage over territorial waters without special permission is clearly established* This point Is being further examined in this department* 5* A oopy of this letter is being sent to the India Office# I am 3ir Your obedient Servant (Sd.)

S. I have sent a reply to the effect that I will naturally make enquiries, but am sure there is some mistake, as the aeroplanes always keep outside Persian territory on their way down the Gulf of Oman and it is notoriously easy for laymen to think that an aeroplane is flying immediately above them, when it is really some miles away. 3. At the same time it occurs to me that the company^ aeroplanes, which I presume strike and leave the Persian coast somewhere in the neighbourhood of Ras-al-Kuh, may on occasions fly within territorial waters at Jask, which lies on a head land. I therefore suggest that the company^ pilots should be asked to take special care not to come within three miles of the Persian coast on their way up or down the Gulf of Oman, except when the safety of the aircraft is involved. 4* The preceding paragraph is written on the assumption that there is at present no right of innocent passage over territorial waters as well as through them.

[E 2783/208/34' No. 1. (No. 255.) Sir, Mr. Hoare to Sir John Simon.—(Received June 7.) Tehran, May 23, 1932. WITH reference to my telegram of to-day, No. 82, I have the honour to inform you that I had a meeting with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Court yesterday at the latter’s house at 10 o’clock. His Highness, in anticipation of an all-day sitting, invited us both to lunch with him. 2. I have had some slight difficulty in recording the conversation, and, though I am satisfied that the enclosed memorandum represents fairly faithfully the gist of our conversation, its chronological order is probably not completely accurate. 3. As you are aware from recent telegrams, I was afraid that the decision reached by His Majesty’s Government to transfer Imperial Airways route to the Arab coast would be ill-received. As a matter of fact, the only indication that Teymourtache gave of disappointment was an enquiry whether, supposing he asked us to reconsider the decision on the understanding that we dropped our request for facilities at Hen jam, we would agree to do so. When I told him that we would certainly not he made no further reference to the matter. 4. It will be observed that, with regard to the discussion on the subject of Hen jam, I made a very definite reference to the probable views of the First Lord of the Admiralty. I did so in order to make my statement as emphatic as possible, and, so far as I can judge, I produced the desired effect. 5. Ft will be further observed that I mentioned the steamships “ Khuzistan and ‘ k Baroda,' in connexion with which I am at present engaged in discussing with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs two recent instances of the aggressiveness of the local officials, to which it has been necessary to take exception. 6. With regard to the Arms Traffic Convention mentioned towards the end of my memorandum, I enclose, for convenience of reference, copies of Feroughi's letter, which 1 have already sent to the Department. I imagine that all Teymourtache has in mind (I* believe him to be really the author of the letter) is the fact, or at any rate the appearance, of co-operating in the Gulf with His Majesty’s Government on a footing of absolute equality. I admit that this hankering after appearances is a little wearisome, but the abolition of the fez in Turkey is an instance of a similar mentality, and I submit that where Mustafa Kemal has led we cannot complain if Teymourtache seeks to follow. 7. Throughout the discussion Feroughi spoke only once or twice, but he appeared to be enjoying himself, and displayed none of the uneasiness which I noticed in my first conversation with him and Teymourtache. This I regard as a favourable symptom, because, so far as I am aware, Feroughi, if he had the energy and will-power to espouse any cause, would always have been the champion of good relations with His Majesty’s Government. 8. Teymourtache was friendly to the point of effusiveness throughout, i am fully aware that at one time he was equally, or perhaps more, friendlv towards my predecessor, and professed to him just^as earnestly as he has to me his desire to reach a settlement. Even with this precautionary admission, I believe his protestations to be sincere, though I admit that 1 do not quite understand why he is so insistent in his endeavours to extract the last possible ounce out of His Majesty’s Government; indeed, quite possibly prepared to miss a settlement in an endeavoui to extract the last impossible ounce. It may simply be an extreme instance of the passion for a bargain which is deeply seated in the Eastern mind, or it may be that he considers his position to be weakened bv the discomforts which his economic policy has caused, and feels that an inconclusive suspension of negotiations as the result of even an excessive assertion of Persia’s [497 g-1] B3 this point that Teymourtache said something to the effect that he had detected in London an atmosphere of suspicion against the Persian Government. This gave me an opportunity of saying that I was fully aware before I came here that the atmosphere was not good; I had, therefore, represented to His Majesty's HJovernment after I had been here a short time and there seemed to be signs of improvement that to my mind a treaty such as we had in view should be the consummation of, rather than the introduction to, good relations and I had urged that the resumption of negotiations be deferred until the habit of neighbourliness on both sides had eliminated all traces of the past mistrust. I had, however, been over-ruled, largely, I thought, as the result of his visits to London. He could, therefore, safely conclude that His Majesty’s Government were keenly anxious to reach an agreement. Teymourtache replied that he did not see that anything could possibly have been gained by a postponement of the negotiations, and asked how I thought that a spirit of confidence could be created while major issues were outstanding. I said that I thought there were a number of ways, instancing the joint survey of the Baluchistan frontier, which we could perfectly well have refused, and from which I rather fancied we had nothing to gain and possibly a little to lose, and a possible arrangement for dealing with frontier district “rebels” in that region. Teymourtache agreed profusely that matters were- easier now, but did not agree that negotiations should have been deferred. This led Teymourtache to wonder whether a frontier rectification in Baluchistan might not provide the necessary “compensation” for Bahrein,, though he hastened to say that the East was not the favourite part of the Empire. E told him that T did not know in the least, but anyway it would be quite useless to make any suggestion if the Persian attitude on the subject of Henjam was a completely non j)ossumus one, as his language seemed to indicate. As regards Henjam, I, having lived a good deal in the East, could understand his objections to a lease, though I doubted whether other people, e.g., the First Lord of the Admiralty, who was a person of some importance in the councils of His Majesty’s Government, would be able to; but I could not understand, and quite certainly people in England would not understand, why the Persian Government should object to affording, in the full exercise of Persia’s sovereign rights, the facilities for which we asked in consecration of a treaty of friendship. A refusal of these facilities would quite inevitably be regarded in England as a signal proof of unfriendliness and the feeling engendered would render it quite certain that no further “ compensation ” for Bahrein would be entertained for one moment. In fact I should regard it as a waste of time to try and think of something. Teymourtache replied that though he did not admit that the potential charge of unfriendliness was justified he quite understood that it would almost inevitably be made, and he said positively that if Persian national sentiment could be satisfactorily appeased over Bahrein a settlement regarding Henjam could be reached. (Throughout the discussion of Bahrein I was insistent that he wanted window-dressing and nothing else and he did not deny it.) With regard to Henjam specifically, at one time he talked of the practical difficulties of meeting our wishes, rather suggesting that they lay in the high handed attitude adopted by the naval store-keeper there. I gave him recent instances, i.e., the “ Khuzistan and “ Baroda.” to convince him that this was very far from being the case and so he reverted to the line that Henjam would present no serious difficulties, but for the irregular situation in the Gulf which was a relic of the past and which made Persian opinion particularly sensitive and, indeed, suspicious. Persia had suffered severely, more especially during the war. When I said that we had not taken the initiative in violating Persia’s neutrality he admitted it readily enough, and also admitted that we had at no time been guilty of aggressive action against Persia, but said that the effect on Persian opinion of the abandonment of Persia’s interests by the conclusion of the Anglo-Russian Agreement of 1907 had been just as disastrous as any act of aggression and created the mistrust which had lasted ever since. I told him that J quite understood all this, but that we were engaged in removing anomalies, and if we were successful in removing them his objections to Henjam seemed to me to disappear. Throughout the conversation whenever I pressed the discussion of Heniam he was inclined to switch off to Bahrein as soon as he could, and he kept saying that he wondered how a settlement over Bahrein could be reached. I reminded him emphatically that he had said in London that he foresaw a quick and easv [497 g-1] r2agreement. This to my mind could only mean, in view of the course of the previous negotiation and of his knowledge that Hen jam was the one material thing we cared about, that he contemplated some advance to meet us. By his own admission the withdrawal of Airways to the Arab coast made matters much easier for him, but, none the less, there was no advance. W hen I asked what we should do next if we failed to reach a settlement b£ negotiation, I eymourtache looked gloomy and evinced a definite dislike to an appeal to any outside body, saying that if they lost their case opinion in Persia would take the view that the arbitral body had not regarded the issue as between the Sheikh of Bahrein and Persia, but as one between the British Empire and an Asiatic State; it would all make for unpleasantness; but from another aspect an aibitral decision would, of course, relieve the Persian Government of a considerable measure of responsibility. At this stage Henjam once again came into the discussion, Teymourtache observing that it was a matter which lav withm the undisputed control of.the Persian Government. I quite agreed and said that of course the Minister for Foreign Affairs could address us a note to-morrow asking us to withdraw. I supposed that we should then burn down e club-house and canteen, remove the coal-depot and blow up the store-houses and hPtSrT 111 taC 16 a . dded r7 fi11 ll P the wel1 - 1 suggested that it might be easier and better to poison it and he quite agreed.

When I asked what he meant, I gathered that he would like a bilateral understanding— possibly for inclusion in the treaty—not unlike the projected Slavery Article. Feroughi, breaking a long silence, said that he had written to me about it, which • Feymourtache said he did not know. Anyway, said Feroughi, the convention is virtually a dead letter. I gave reasons why I thought that the Persian Govern ment had rather misunderstood the matter, and that, had the Persian Gulf been called the Gulf of Arabia, they would have seen little in the convention to shock them. Teymourtache replied that on re-examination of the document they had also formed the opinion that they had cried out rather louder than the hurt warranted, but, none the less, the native craft aspect of the matter was offensive to Persian sentiment. I said that I imagined something could be done to meet their views on this point. We did not discuss any of the five numbered points, and Feroughi, wPo by this time was hours late for an appointment, suggested that we should adjourn. I therefore asked whether I could inform my Government that the extension for Imperial Airways would be granted. They said that they would submit the request to the next meeting of the Council of Ministers on the 25th May, and hoped that there would be no difficulty. The hope expressed was in rather disquieting contrast to the absolute assurance with which they told me that the previous prolongation would be granted. I said I presumed that, in any case, supposing there were delay in reaching a decision, there would be no difficulty in respect of any planes due to arrive at Bushire or Task in the first days of June, and was told that this would be quite all right. R. H. H. May 22, 1932. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. M. Feroughi to Mr. Hoare. Mon cher Ministre, Teheran, Je 6 arril 1932. LORS des entretiens que nous avons eu le plaisir d'avoir avec votre Excellence, le Ministre de la Cour et moi, Foccasion s’est presentee d’effleurer la question du controle, dans le golfe Persique, taut de la traite des noirs que du commerce des armes. II est a propos de Fapprofondir, d'autant que, selon toutes vraisemblanees, la Conference pour la Limitation et la Reduction des Armements, qui siege actuelle- ment a Geneve, ne manquera pas de s’occuper du controle de la production et du trafic des armes et munitions. Au surplus, le Gouvernement britannique a marque recemment Finteret qu'il portait au sort de la convention de 1925 sur le commerce international des armes et vous-meme vous avez semble souhaiter une adhesion de mon Gouvernement aux principes de cette convention, meme si elle devait s'accompagner de reserves. Dans ces conditions, il m'a paru que ce serait un geste arnica! et qui ne pouvait manquer d’etre apprecie si j'exprimais a votre Excellence confidentielle- ment et en toute sincerite mes vues sur la question. II n’est pas interdit d’esperer preluder par-la a une entente a ce sujet entre nos deux Gouvernements. A la suite de nos conversations, j’ai procede a un nouvel examen de la con vention de 1925 sur le commerce international des armes. II m'a eonfirme dans Fopinion que le Ministre de la Cour et moi nous vous avions laisse prevoir. Des dispositions telles que celles de la Convention Internationale sur le Commerce international des Armes ne sont pas de nature a rencontrer Fadhesion du Gouvernement imperial. La delimitation dans une note Internationale de “ zones speciales,” dans lesquelles se trouve englobe le golfe Persique, du point de vue du Gouvernement persan, est vexatoire et inutile. Vexatoire, car, de lui-meme, le Gouvernement, qui a d’ailleurs interdit en Perse le commerce prive des armes et munitions, s’est charge de la tache de controler ses cotes et ses eaux territoriales et dans Finteret meme de la seeurite nationale d’y exercer le controle le plus vigilant. Mais ce qu'il a fait spontanement et dans Finteret du pavs, il blesserait la dignite du peuple persan et son sens de la souverainete nationale qu'il y fut oblige du dehors et comme par une espece de servitude internationale.mam o DO. 3.

I hope there will he no difficulty over extension and will take an opportunity of emphasising Importance of the matter in the interests of general negotiations which on the initiative of Minister of Court we discussed for over six hours. Fall record leaves hy hag May 25th. Minister of Court was extraordinarily insistant that we surrender Tamh. I said this was quite out of the question and refrained from asking reasons for his insistance in order to do nothing to weaken my refusal. I can only imagine reason is that possession of Tamh lighthouse will in his opinion strengthen Persian position in the matter of l ights and huoys. At the outset his line appeared to he tnat in no circumstances could Persian Government contemplate affording us special facilities at Kenjam. When therefore v/e passed on to Bahrein and he suggested that v/e make further con cessions I explained bluntly that it was not worth while my wasting my time suggesting anything of the sort to His Majesty’s Government because refusal of facilities jn Kenjam in any shapscor form would he regarded as so unfriendly that any further payment in respect of what v/e regarded asa worthless claim would not he entertained for a moment. Conversation strengthened impression recorded in my despatch No. 146 that 'minister of Court is really anxious for a settlement. The conclusion I reached was that remission of the whole debt except pre-war which would he paid in the near future and a further sop of some kind will probably result in an agreement including facilities though not a lease at Hen jam.

Your telegraia No. 53. I would propose to take following line with Minister oY Court; improbability of obtaining further extension of Persian route naturally led His Majesty's Government and imperial Airways to examine possibilities of trans- ier to Arabian coast as you twice told him in London mlsht be ae^for. This examination largely contributed to development of new Hannibal type which has given such good results that Arabian route no longer presents terrors to which we have so frequently referred in the Past. Examination of route has moreover convinced military authorities of the aav^-TBc-cr, ui wie eavuntages of permanent air , . ^ Su be uhe essential^ strategic air route 11 ^ everitual international complications.

His Majesty's Government therefore desire to reserve ....2 . y &lt;A, reserve possi'oility of re-opening the question of using Persian route if practical considerations or permits granted to other air navigation companies justify formulation of such a request. I shall then say His Majesty's Government hope Persian Government will give a further and xinal extension up to October 1st using oovious arguments; as you are aware I anticipate that this communication will he taken amiss. It is in view of this that I have asked you in my telegram No, 76 for a suitable message intended to convince Minister of Court that His Majesty's Government are as anxious to reach a general settlement as he is. I would at first reinforce that argument by telling him how averse I had been at ilrst to resumption of general negotiations with the arguments I used and reasons why my views were not endorsed, I do not propose to take any initiative in raising question of Kenjam at this interview. if it is raised I shall take the line that it is evident from my corres- poxidence with you that even if Persian Government had isolated the issues and proposed a definite settlement by which Airways permit would have been prolonged in return -or our renunciation of demand for a lease of Henjam tnat proposal would not have been acceptable. I quite understood his objections to the Henjam situation of today because it was a survival from a time when a weak Central Government almost obliged us to disregard the sovereign rights of Persia but I could see no possible objection ...objection to Persian Government granting to a friendly Power, with which it was concluding a treaty of friend ship on a basis of absolute equality, certain specified facilities of an entirely innocuous nature 0 As regards prospects of obtaining a .lease. of Henjam, my firm belief is that prospects are very small but I have not discussed the matter fully enough with the Minister of Court to justify a categorical statement. Our impending conversation will perhaps enable me to make up my mind on the point. If I conclude that Minister of Court is determined not to grant a lease, I propose to invite him to make counter proposal as soon as possible for submission to you. If he asks whether I have any ideas on the subject I shall say I have been so long in the East that I understand instinctively aversion to definite settlement just as Frenchmen long resident in London may hope to understand our love of compromise even in the teeth of logic. Personally therefore I should be prepared to accept article such as that sketched in my despatch No, 75, the more so as I felt confident that once we had concluded a treaty, the local officials at Henjam would take their cue from Central Government and avoid causing petty vexations to our long suffering naval officers, I have sketched in detail the direction which I should wish conversation to take because i have been very near misunderstanding the sophistical objections of His Maj esty 1 s Government„ I am sure we should not show any hesitation about continuing negotiations at once, see your telegram No,51 paragraph 11, and therefore hope that replies to points raised in my despatches Nos, 73, 101 and 106 are bn thei^ way e■I T his Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Governm ent, and should be returned to the Foreign Office if not requir ed for official use.] ST?

Your telesTorn No. 77 (of Fay 15th: air route end negotiations). Line proposed in paragraph 1 does not tally with the facts, as the development of the new Fannioals is net due to the examination of the Arabian route. I suggest there fore that relevant passage he amended to reed: 'Feanv/hile development of new four-engined types of aircraft has shenu that the operation of the Arabian route no longer presents the terrors, etc.' I do not quite like proposed statement that the 'maintenance of such air bases cun only be justified in present financial situation if they one being regularly used by civil aviation', as here too there would be some inaccuracy in such allegation. In point of fact Arabian coast route will be developed as a military route in any case, and use of landing grounds by civil aircraft will not seriously effect the military expenditure involved. As regards tactics to be employed, following considera tions occur to me: Is it not fact that Persians fear that if they allow continued use of South Persianroute by British air service. Fis • • •Ms , ajesty's Govern cnt may wish to utilise it in an emergency as a military route and landing grounds as air 'basesi' ii so, ’'ould it not be well to omit telling Persians unau we must hesve Mr oases, that the Gastern air route is x egardeo. as strategic, and that expenditure on air bases cannc u be justified unless they are also used ior civil fli^nus, as such arguments rM 0 ht appear to confirm their worst suspicions? .dll it not then be sufficient merely to explain that the existence of the military route along the Arabian coast is strong practical argument in favour of taking the civil rou^e along the some cdi._.nment, since the civil route con then benefit by services established in connexion with the military organisation?[ This Document is the Property of His Br itannic Majesty’s Government, returned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.! — r~ aim suoum ue tecyphe X o D„ R.

Question of Airways permit was originally raised, hy me with Minister of Court on November 15th as entirely independent issue (see my telegram No. 181). Realising importance which Hie Majesty’s Government attached to it he explained three days later that he proposed to ask a price for it without indicating terms (see my telegram Noo 132) and was given no reason to believe that His Majesty’s Government would bargain. On December 23rd he took initiative in suggesting resumption of negotiations on all subjects including air route, and offered provis ional extension of permit as circumstances might require* Fact that this offer v/as not rejected cannot be held to havecommitted His Majesty’s Government to more than awaiting statement of Persian terms* 2o He did not indicate terms until February 16th (see your telegrams Nos® 24 and 25), when he suggested extension in return for evacuation of Henjam* Shortly afterwards, this not having been immediately accepted* Teymourtache, in mere fulfilment of his promise in London (see your telegram No* 38) extended permit till May 31st®eiore regard situation as follows: 2o 3. oher r.T,- vrithstanding my statanent the,t air route was separate issue, he has decided, to try to inane it subject cl bar gain, to linlc it v/ith general negotiations, and to asn a high price for desired concession. Fulfilment of his own offer of temporary extension pending decision was only logical, and cannot limit freedom of His Majesty’s Gov ernment to examine, and if necessary to reject, Persian terms, or to maintain their original view that air route and treaty negotiations are essentially independent is sues. Thus, in view of nature oi terms now put forward by Persians, it is, as you yourself recognise in last part of paragraph 12 of your despatch No. 92,against Teymourtache only that accusation of disingenuousness could be made. 4. Consideration of general Persian attitude to wards air route as revealed in your despatch No. £2 and subsequent correspondence has taken time owing xo neces sity for consulting Government of India and obtaining further data about alternative routes, regarding possible adoption of which Teymourtache was specifically warned on December 23rd. Conclusion is that his terms for a settlement of the air route are too high, that there are strong objections of principle to paying a price of this kind or even a commercial price on a scale so high as to tempt the Persian Government. meanwhile, His majesty's Government find that Arabian route, which will in any esse have to be developed as a military route for strategic purposes, presents definite advantages.3 . Without stressing argument in paragraph 7 ox - o* eign Ofxice letter of March 15th to India Office, to v/hich you take exception.ari cn which applicability would in any case have depended on circumstances, it is clear that air route utilising territories rulers of which are in special relations with His Majesty's Government and where comparative security of tenure could he assured, presents important advantages over route which Persxans could close at any time and continued use of which might in future again become subject of political bargaining. 5. Moreover it is now clear that Teymourtache re gards His Majesty's Government as entirely dependent on Persia for the maintenance of this essential link in inter imperial communications and that he is confident that he can exploit this situation to win a diplomatic triumph which would secure most important of the Persian political desiderata (Compare second sentence of paragraph 4 of your despatch No. 92). Definite transfer of the air route without further bargaining seems the only possible means of convincing the Persians that this is not the case, and until they are convinced it seems clear that no progress can be made towards the satisfactory settlement of any other outstanding question between Persia and tnis country.. 6. In these circumstances, His Majesty's Government have decided that balance of advantage lies in refusing the Persian terms, and in transferring the air route to the Arabian coast of the Gulf as soon as possible.Certain practical difficulties however (see my telegram No. 48) makemm* make it impossible to effect transfer by May 31st, and we must therefore consider question of further temporary extension. 7. I realise that in view of decision to refuse Persian terms and transfer route, extension may be more difficult to obtain, and that if we say nothing about our decision it might be argued that this further extension had been secured on false pretences. It may therefore be wiser to explain to Teymourtache frankly v/ithout delay that His Majesty's Government have decided to transfer route to Arabian coast. Such an explanation,preferably oral, should be so worded as to make it clear that His Majesty^ Government in deciding to adopt the Arabian route have been much influenced by the practical as dis tinct from commercial advantages which it has now been found to possess and especially those in last sentence of paragraph 4 above. This is mere statement of fact, and, while meeting point in paragraph 5 above, should show that His Majesty*s Government are not transferring route merely as result of Persian pressure. Any statement to Teymourtache regarding impending transfer should avoid committing us to permanent renunciation of wish to resume use of Persian route at some future date. Statement could then be followed by explanation to effect that, as pre parations for transfer will still take a few months to complete, we shall be glad of further temporary extension until October 1st. 8. On the other hand, general situation in regard to.5* to various questions connected with negotiations is still so obscure that it may be preferable to postpone such an announcement if you consider that you can obtain further temporary extension without cresting false impression. 9. I am opposed to threat of transfer as distinct from definite announcement of its impending execution since this would make transfer dependent on outcome of further negotiations. if it were then carried out as result of failure of such negotiations, it might be represented as a diplomatic defeat and lead to second consequence foreseen in final sentence of paragraph 4 of your telegram No. 63. 10. I am also opposed to proposal in final pr ra- graph of your telegram No. 63 that questions of air route and of Henjam should both be excluded from negotiations pending settlement of other outstanding points. This would mean that our main desideratum (Henjam) would re main unsettled, v/hile Persians would obtain most of their demands in return for concessions of less tangible value to us. It has been suggested to me that unless we even tually succeed in obtaining satisfactory settlement re garding Henjam it will not be worth concluding any treaty at all. I do not share this view but I am convinced that it would not be in our interests to conclude such a treaty without at least a further attempt to secure a satisfac tory Kenjam settlement first. Finally proposal would involve coupling air route and Henjam questions, which is precisely what we wish to avoid.6 . 11. Question whether negotiations regarding Henjam and other points should he continued now or postponed till alter transfer of air route must depend on nature of settlement rea.ched regarding temporary extension. 12. Immediate point is to secure further temporary extension. It is debat eat le whether announcement of im pending transfer of air route should he made at once when applying for extension, or deferred until preparations for transfer are complete. I leave this point to your discretion, and shall he glad if you will now take what ever action you consider best with a view to secure desired extension.

In this connexion it la of some interest that Mr. uats, of Airwork Limited, mas recently in Tehran and in an interview with Tey*uourtache obtained a general assurance to the effect that if his firm established a service In ’Iraq, there would be no objection to their landing passengers in Tehran when required In return ior the permission accorded to aircraft operating in Persia to land at Baghdad.HU Highness also Indicated that permis sion could always be obtained as a setter oi course ior charter flights and that he would be prepared to consider the question of further services. 3. Mr.runts* object was at that time to connect Tehran with Aleppo, where the , •Wagons-Lit ,, service can be taken to Europe. He was also prepared to consider running s service between Tehran and BushIre, if this would help Imperial Airways* Lat r I received from him a letter, written before the announcement of tJu her* a withdrawal, in which he contemplated the absorption of Junkers* interests in The Right Honourable Sir ^ohn Simon, G*C.8.I., etc*, etc*, etc*, The Foreign Office* etc*, • i * tIn ’Iraq and poaaibljr on the Baghdad-Tehran-rniahire Xlnee and the utlllsatlonoi their aeroplonea and experience on these lines, 4* Since then the Inperlal Airways have offered to operate the Baghdad- ehran-Bushire lines for three months 9 in order to ensure the continuity of the Persian sir ser vices 9 without asking for my subsidy. In ay telegrsua Ho#&amp;® of the 3rd Instant I deprecated the making of this offer and I am convinced that if it were accepted it would only lead to a useless expenditure of tlae 9 trouble and money, Whether accepted or refused 9 it would be regarded as a transparent attempt to remove the air issue from the scope of the general negotiations, That Issue is regarded by Teymourtaehe as his ace of trumps* This being the ease even if an offer to operate this line whether at a loss or not for as long as the Company were allowed to use the Persian coast would 9 in ay opinion, be equally useless and would create the l^pxession that the Company# and mors especially His Kajesty’s Government, attach enormous import ance to the Persian route, 6, Since drafting this I have studied your letter to the India Office of March 16th and my telegram Mo,56 of yesterday's date will have made it plain that I welcome the proposal to attempt to deprive Teymourtache of his ace of trumps* He bluffs so hard and so success fully himself that, if the course of action proposed in your letter le adopted, it will not be easy to c onvlnce him that His Majesty's Government seriously mean to abandonmm the 'erettLn roat« pother than aubuiit to blackmail. how h® will react when he ie conwinced I will not venture to prophesy. 6.

Further complication from extension of permit in return for subsidy would be that foreign services might continue free use of route at our expense thus involving in fact discrimination against British service, Moreover s even if subsidy could be paid in so indirect a manner as to render these objections of principte less applicable, figures which you now quote introduce new serious difficulty which would almost certainly prove in superable. Initial cost of transfer of Imperial Airways' service to Arabian coast is unlikely to exceed £30*000 and may, c e 0o ^ • may amount, if land, planes arc used, to less than £10,000, while subsequent annual cost to Ills Majcsty*s Government is expected to prove comparatively slight* Subsidy to Aii\ /errk to oe effective would have to be very large, since apar o from making up dead loss on internal services of approximately £&gt;30,000 a year, it would be necessary to provide for Airwork profit* Further, if Persians regarded arrangement as equivalent to subsidy in return for con tinuance of Imperial Air way fe 1 permit, they would probably i-iiposo conditions on Airwork involving gree-tor running losses than those experienced by Junkers and increased subsidy. Even if satisfactory concession for Airwork V 4* operate Persian internal services could be obtained by these means, we should merely have given Persian Govern ment another hostage in connexion with our Imperial com munications, as Persians could always utilise Airwork con cession uO create difficulties for Imperial Airways, and connexion between two concessions would be likely to prove constant source of friction and difficulty. Offer of subsidy in ary form for continuance of Imperial Airways’ permit at this stage, even if disguised in manner proposed, would strengthen Persian conviction of omr extreme emmioty oc secure boutli Persian permit and tnereioro encourage them to link that question more close ly witn political negotiations.

It was suggested by Mr. Muntz and Mr. Woods Humphery that a subsidiary Airwork- Persian Company might be formed to run a service Baghdad-Tehran-Bushire. Mr. Hoare has suggested to the F.O. that he might conceivably suggest such a service (to be run in conjunction with Imperial Airways) to Taimourtache if the latter dilates on the uselessness to Persians of the South Persian route. Mr. Hoare and the F.O. think that Taimourtache would not accept the suggestion, but^in view of the chancethat he might accept it^it seems necessary before the suggestion is made to Taimourtache to work out the cost (including subsidy) of auch a sub sidiary service as compared with the cost of the Arab route.

Dear Mr. Hoare, As you know our associated Egyptian Company - Societe /uionyme Misr Airwork - is now well on the way and should be launched this coming winter. I shall be out in i^gypt about Christmas time and shall be going on to Iraq, where the ground has been prepared with the aid of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company for the formation of a similar company, and it is about this that I am now writing. The point is that Imperial Airways and ourselves are now collaborating, and in the case of Iraq the arrangement is that they will come in with us in the Anglo-Iraqi Company. Imperial Airways are very keen to bring in feeder services along the fSmpire route and they would very much like to operate via the Anglo-Iraqi subsidiary company the service between Baghdad and Tehran, and the first question therefore is whether you think there is any chance of an Iraqi Company obtaining permission from the Persian Government to run a service between Tehran and Baghdad. As you know Imperial Airways are having a _ood deal of difficulty in obtaining operating concessions from the Persian Government on the route between Baghdad and Karachi. It occurs to me, and to them, that if Airwork via an Airwork— Persian subsidiary company - could obtain operating concessions H.H. Hoare, ;.sq. , C.M.G., British Legation, Tehran, Persia.concessions in Persia, their Indian route problem might become much easier. The second question therefore is whether you think there is any chance of being able to form an Airwork- Persian Company on the lines of the Airwork-Iraqi Company. I realise that Junkers have had a sole operating concession, but I understand that it terminates or comes up for renewal at the end of the present year. I gathered from Sir John Cadman, who I believe discussed it with the Shah, that it was unlikely that Junkers would get a sole concession again. In this connection I was for six years in the service of the Anglo-Perslan Oil Company, and as a matter of fact I am still retained by them. Sir Arnold Wilson, who has had a good deal to do with the Anglo-Persian negotiations in that part of the world, is a shareholder in Airwork, and ,ir John Cadman has definitely promised the whole of the Anglo-Pereian aviation work to Airwork and to give us their full support in Iraq and Persia. I mention this to show that I can bring full Oil Company interest to support the coming into existence of Airwork-Iraqi and Airwork-Persian Companies should the opening appear good enough. I hope to be out in Iraq in the New Year and I shall certainly visit the Anglo-Persian oil fields while I am there. If there is any chance of doing any good in Persia I could easily fly over and pay you a visit at Tehran. There is also some likelihood that I shall be holding a watching brief for Imperial Airways. I shall be exceedingly grateful if you can spare time to let me have your guidance in this matter. Yours sincerely, (Signed) ALAN MUNTZ.C^y. GWH/ttLW/1992. Airway Terminus, Victoria Station, Personal , London, S.W. 1. 13th November, 1931. My dear Mr. Hoare, You invited me to write to you personally if there was anything in which you might be able to help us while you are in Tehran, and I am, therefore, taking you at your word in this personal letter. When I was lunching with Sir John Cadman the other day he told me that there were considerable difficulties between the Junkers Company and the P.G., and he had an idea that the latter might welcome a suggestion that we would be willing to consider the possibility of participating in some way in the development of air services in Persia, so that they are not left permanently and solely in the hands of the Company. I write this to suggest to you that should you have a favourable opportunity and consider it wise to do so, you would throw out the hint to the P.G. , that you felt sure that we will be only too pleased to be of assistance to them in the development of their internal and local aviation. You would, no doubt, add the caution that we are an ordinary trading concern and rather ppor at that, and, therefore, we probably could not afford to run air services at a loss. I hope you like your new surroundings - for myself I think I should prefer Cairo! With kind regards, Yours sincerely, (Signed) G.E. WOODS HUMPHERY. Reginald H. Hoare, isqre., C.M.G., The British Minister at Tehran, Persia.Copy. Private and Confidential. British Legation, Tehran. 8th December, 19dl. My dear Muntz, I am glad to learn from your letter of November 17th that the -igyptian business is going on well and that you hope to develop in Iraq. Ac regards Persia, it is almost certain that tunkers will clear out at the end of January, exactly why would be hard to say, as Weil has quite recently tolduus that he nus expressed his readiness to meet the Persian wishes on every point which they have raised. I give you one example: - the Persians suggested that Junkers were making excessive profits instead of the losses shown in their books. Weil replied that he would be delighted if they would take a fifty per cent interest, and was then told that it was unreasonable to expect Persia to meet any part of the losses! we believe that one reason why the Persians are willing to let bunkers go is that they intend to send the mail by military aeroplane. Having read this far, you will hardly be surprised to learn that I am quite sure that it would be the purest waste of time and trouble for you to touch Persia for the present. The Persians do odd things at times, but it would be beyond all limits of oddity to give a concession to a new concern immediately after breaking with your old concessionaires who are universally admitted to have given an admirably efficient service. It is hard to say whether the Persians will feel themselves Alan Muntz, ;&lt;)sqre. , C/o Airwork Limited, Heston Air Park, Hounslow, Middlesex.'X themselves seriously inconvenienced hy the absence of an air service. Perhaps they will and perhaps, if your Irak show goes well, a little Jealousy creep in and they may say to themselves that it is absurd for Iraq to have an air service and for them to be without one and then - a year or so hence - it might possibly be worth while to have a try. You can readily imagine that if I thought there was the slightest hope now , I should urge you to come, for preference in the winner of the Schneider Cup, as the prospect of being air service-less does not smile on us* I’m sending a copy of this to Cairo in case I miss you in London, and also privately to the Foreign Office and Woods Humphery from whom I’ve had a letter similar to yours. ./ill you let me know how long you will be in Iraq (which presumably depends on how things go). Yours sincerely, (Signed) R.H. HOARE. _____Jopy. 8th i)eoember, 1931.

British Legation, Tehran, i November 1st, 1951, Dear Department, Very many thanks for your letter of September 30th (W 10739/312/50) and for letting us have an up-to-date copy of the International Air Navigation Convention with accompanying Protocols, which will be moat useful to us. You state that some of the parties, including Persia» have not yet even signed the Protocols. Does this mean that ^ersia can hold up any such amendments indefinitely, in spite of her anomalous position? So far as we are aware this continues to be that though she has not yet chosen to submit the Convention for ratification by the Majlis, she may still do so in her own good time. In the meanwhile we suppose it is correct that she is a 'party” (see also F.O. despatch No. 24 of January 15th, 1927 - E 82/1/65). We should be glad to learn whether, since 1925, Persia has paid her subscriptions or taken any part in the meetings of the International Commission. She is quite capable of doing so, and at the same time claiming that she is not bound by the Convention. We are interested in the question of Persia’s-r f V Z. 1 (2 L J O U obligations mainly as they affect Imperial Airways* chances of being able to continue their Indian service along the Persian shore of the Gulf. This is an international airway and obligations of parties to the Gonvention respecting international airways are governed by Article 15. Whatever doubts there may have been about the interpretation of Article 15 in its original form, there can hardly be any doubt as to the meaning of the amended version approved under Protocols of June 16/P©cember 11th, 1929. It is clear that the amended version grants to parties discretion to deny their territory to international airways. This interpretation having once been adopted, the less restrictive one can hardly be maintained. It follows that even if the Persian Government admitted themselves to be bound by the Convention, Imperial Airways would not be entitled under Artic^V 15 to claim to traverse Persian territory as of right (still less to choose their own route). From this point of view it seems to be immaterial whether the Persian Government admit their obligations under the Convention or not. On the other hand Article 2 prohibits discrim ination by a party as between nationalities in the application of regulations made as to the admission of aircraft over its territory. Supposing that Persia admitted her obligations under the Convention, it would follow that if she allowed the French Air Orient or the Dutch K.L.M. to fly their services over her territory Persia/ * J • ereia would be obliged to accord similar facilities to Airways* We are aware, from P.0, despatch No. 643 of the 21st September that there may be difficulties in claiming equal treatment for Airways under our general most-favoured-nation rights. But if Persia conformed to the Convention, Airways would seem to be able to claim moet-favoured-nation treatment under it. Any reservations and restrictions as to ’’cabotage’* are, by Article 16, confined to national aircraft. The disguise of a permission for the French or Dutch f ompanies to fly their international services as a con cession from which Airways could be excluded, would seem to be ruled out under this clause of the Convention. From this point of view therefore it would be material to Airways interests that ersia should acknowledge herself to be bound by the Convention. In Foreign Office despatch No. 24 of January 16th, 1927 it is stated that 'its provisions are binding on Persia, whether the Majlis has approved it or not”. If therefore the Persian Government should continue the permission to use the coast route for the French or the Dutch while refus ing to continue the permission for Airways, this would be a violation of a treaty obligation and would be a justiciable case. Could it not properly and usefully be made the object of an appeal to the Permanent Court of International Justice? There occurs to us another possibility. Con tention or no convention, the Persian Government could allow the French Air Orient to camouflage their machines flying the Gulf Section as Persian national aircraft. Indeed we have heard a report (hitherto(hitherto unconfirmed) that the French Government are intriguing lor a concession to establish an aircraft factory and aviation school in Persia to serve as a - pint d^ppui for their Far-eastern service and that Teymourtache has been tackled and possibly convinced by the Quai d’Orsay. The Persian Government could then grant the exclusive right to fly the Gulf section to these camouflaged quasi-Persian machines with French pilots. They might try to blackmail us into allowing these machines to land in India and ’Iraq by representing that if we refused such permission* we should be depriving the world, ourselves included, of flying facilities in the Persian eection of the international airway. They would then have turned the tables on us. (we presume that the provisions of Article 7 can be circumvented without too much difficulty - conditions of national registration).

AS your Highness is aware, from the report contained in my note of the 1st instant, Imperial Airways have satisfied themselves that the route through Central Persia is quite impossible for a regular commercial air service. 2. The company's right under existing agreements to use the present route expires on the 31st March, and the question of future arrangements for the air service between the United Kingdom and India requires a prompt decision. 3. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of India would, of course, greatly appreciate it if the Persian Government were prepared to extend for a further term of years the present authorisation by which Imperial Airways call at Bushire, Lingah and Jask. The two Governments like to believe that some slight political and material advantage accrues to the Persian Government from the fact that Persian territory now forms an important link on one of the great lines of world communications, the development of which is unanimously regarded as one of the most important factors of modern progress. 4. Your Highness will readily understand that any uncertainty with regard to the future must inevitably be a cause of embarrassment. It will therefore be greatly appreciated if this question can receive the prompt attention of the Imperial Government, who will, I have no doubt, examine it with a full appreciation of its international importance.

Tehran, November 1, 1931. Enclosure in No. 1. Mr. Hoare to M. Feroughi. M. le Ministre, Tehran, November 1, 1931. IN your note of the 10th March, 1931 (19th Esfand, 1309), your Highness communicated to His Majesty’s Charge d'Affaires the route across Central Persia which the Persian Government proposed should be followed by the aeroplanes of Imperial Airways (Limited) on the expiry of the present authorisation under which they fly along the coast of the Persian Gulf. Imperial Airways (Limited) sent their senior pilot, Mr. Travers, to Persia in June last, with instructions to survey this route. He carried out these instructions on the 23rd June, flying in a Puss Moth machine. Mr. Travers reported that he found the route selected by the Persian Government to be quite impracticable for a regular commercial air service; and, on the 2nd August, Mr. Lascelles, at that time His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, informed your Highness officially in this sense in the course of a conversation. I now have the honour, under instructions from His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to confirm Mr. Lascelles’s oral statement, and in support of it to communicate to your Highness herewith the .enclosed copy of a letter, dated the 7th October, 1931, addressed by Imperial Airways (Limited) to the Air Ministry, which contains the substance of Mr. Travers’s report. I also have the honour to enclose a copy of Mr. Travers’s original report, namely ;— (a) A general description of the route. {b) An account of the aerodromes and landing grounds. {c) The meteorology of the route. The original report is more technical than the letter of Imperial Airways (Limited), and may be of interest to the Persian aviation experts. 2. The Air Ministry agree with the views expressed by Imperial Airways (Limited) in their letter of the 7th October. Your Highness will observe that in this letter the route in question is considered not only as a whole but also section by section; and that the objections to each section are stated separately. I would invite your Highness's especial attention, moreover, to the last paragraph of the letter, where it is stated in effect that similar objections would apply to any other route which might be selected through Central Persia. The conclusion of this authoritative survey is, in short, that there is no route across Central Persia practicable for a regular commercial air service. I avail, &amp;c. R. H.

I begged him to make it clear that in no circumstances would Imperial Airways accept central route and I emphasized international aspect as well as necessity for prompt decision.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT TEYMOURTACHE, the Persian Minister of Court, called on me to-day. fie arrived in London two days ago and told me that he was staying for a few days more. I told him that I should like to learn from him whether the Persian Government were disposed to renew the concession to the Imperial Airways Company, and that this was a question to which His Majesty’s Government attached considerable importance. He replied by saying that there were a number of questions between Persia and ourselves on which he hoped that discussions might take place, but I replied that this was a matter that should be considered and dealt with by itself as a “question nette.” He referred to the suggestion of the Persian Government that an alternative route might be adopted through the centre of Persia, and that this proposal might be investigated by experts. I replied that such an investigation had taken place and that the route across Central Persia w r as not a practical alternative because of : (1) The height of the mountain ranges to be crossed; (2) the difficulty of winter weather; (3) the absence of telegraphic facilities, and (4) insurmountable difficulties in connexion with the transport of petrol to the aerodromes. He observed that two of these reasons were physical obstacles which could not be removed, and I agreed with him. He gave me no assurance that the Persian Government would continue the concession, and I said that I should regard it as a grave and serious matter if his Government found a difficulty, or refused to co-operate, in a service which was international and for civil purposes and was necessary for postal communication. I added that it would, I felt, make a very disagreeable impression if it became known that such an attitude was adopted, and that I trusted that the good relations which existed between Persia and ourselves, and which would, I hoped, be preserved, would lead his Government to assist international transit in the way required, so as to avoid the adoption of any other measures. I asked him to transmit to his Government the views which I had expressed to him and he promised to do so. PERSIA. November 13, 1931. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. [E 5639/439/34 (No. 673.)

'R' hegiBc:- Your telegram No,248 (of November 9th - South Persian Air Route). I saw Teymourtache on November 13th. Full record follows by bag. I enquired whether Persian Government would renew concession to Imperial Airv/ays to which His Majesty T s Government attached considerable importance. He replied that there were many questions for dis cussion between this country and Persia, but was told that this was matter which should be dealt with separately. He referred to suggested Central Route, whereupon I gave him reasons for which it had, upon investigation,proved impracticable. He gave cno assurance that Persian Government would renew con cession. I said I should regard it as serious matter if they refused to co-operate in a service which was international, civil, and necessary for postal communication. I alluded to disagreeable impression which such attitude would create and trusted that our good relations with Persia, which I hoped would be preserved, would lead Persian Government to assist international transit in manner required so as to avoid necessity for other measures. At my request he promised to communicate my views to Persian Govern ment . 'R” ends. InIn course of dinner conversation with Sir K. Vansittart on November 16th, Teymourbache intimated that Persian Government would be prepared to consider renewal Imperial Airways concession in conjunction with settlement of other questions but not as an isolated matter. He did not, however, indicate what these questions v/ere. He alluded in a different part of the conversation to question of Abu Eusa and Iamb, He explained at some length past hist 017 in regard to Imperial Bank and Persian action in ordering ships from Italy. He threw out allusion to re-opening of general negotiations in London, Sir R. Vansittart said that to his regret he was proceeding on leave at end of v/eek. Conversation was most friendly and affable in tone and Teymourtache is lunching with Sir R. Vansittart on Friday when it will bo renewed.[This Document is the Property of Kis Britannic Majesty returned to the Foreign Office if not -equiret? for ^fjfioial us (E.5440/439/34).

The file also covers the subsequent decision to abandon the South Persian route for an alternative along the coast of Arabia, and a request for a temporary permit from the Persian Government to fly via Persia during the transition. In connection with these topics, there is some discussion between British officials over Persia's obligations under the International Air Convention (or the Paris Convention, 1919), mainly with regard to the extent that Persia can object to foreign aircraft flying over its territory. The unsuitability of a route proposed by the Persian Government through Central Persia is also discussed.Other topics covered to a lesser extent include: the question of the extent to which British aircraft have a right of passage over Persian territorial waters following the withdrawal of Imperial Airways (see folios 3-24), a proposal to request access to the Jask Aerodrome for Imperial Airways in an emergency (see folios 25-35), and a proposal from Imperial Airways to establish a landing ground at Shenast near Lingah [Bandar-e-Lengeh].The file also contains two pages extracted from two – 8 and 22 October 1931 – separate issues of
                           The Near East and India; see folios 174-5. A couple of Parliamentary Notices can also be found within the file; see folios 46 and 50.The main correspondents are HM Minister at Tehran (Reginald Hervey Hoare) and officials of the Foreign Office. The file also contains some correspondence with the Persian Foreign Minister (Mirza Mohammed Ali Khan and Miraz Musa Khan Noury Esfandiary), representatives of Imperial Airways and Airworks Limited (Alan Muntz and George Edward Woods), and officials of the Air Ministry. The correspondence is periodically forwarded to the Under-Secretary of State for India by the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Airways</topic></subject><subject><topic>Airlines</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Imperial Airways</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Airspace (law)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0001ec#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
