The chief correspondent in the file is Lieutenant-Colonel Percy Zachariah Cox, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf between 1904 and 1913. Included in the file (folios 9-10) is an assessment of the prospect of opening British banks in the Gulf, dated 31 October 1911, authored by Frederick Nöel Paton of the Department for Commerce and Industry, which rules out any present need for British banks in the Gulf. Following this is a response to Paton’s assessment (folios 12-13), undated and unsigned, but possibly authored by Cox, which argues the case for the opening of a bank at Bahrain.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter book</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Eastern Bank Limited</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Banking</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0000ab#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
