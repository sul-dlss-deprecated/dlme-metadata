Political Depaktmkxt. From, COLONEL SIR W. L. MEREWETHER/k. c. s. i. &amp; c. b. Commissioner in Sind. To, His Excellency the Right Honorable SIR W. R. SEYMOUR V. FITZGERALD, g. c. s. i., Governor and President in Council, BOMBAY. Commissioner's Office, Kurrachee, \~ytlt September 1870. Right Honorable Sir, It is with extreme regret I have to submit to your Excellency copy of a further letter received from Colonel Phayre, c. B., Political Su perintendent on the Frontier of Sind, and of my reply thereto. 2. This letter is, I consider, so exceedingly improper in tone, and disiespectful to me, that I have felt precluded entering into any further discussion with that officer, on subjects regarding which he has assumed such an unbecoming attitude. While acting so, however, it is necessary I should remark on the letter for the information of your Excellency, and to show how grievously Colonel Phayre continues to misunderstand the situation, and the different documents he has quoted from. I would take this opportunity of begging that I may be favored with early de cision in these matters, and with your Excellency's instructions on the course you wish followed, as I cannot help feeling that, under the pre sent circumstances, the most serious complications may any day be brought about, causing results which may not be readily rectified. 3. I trust that the correspondence which has been previously submitted, will have already proved to your Excellency that, bearing in mind Colonel Phayre's lengthened service, his well known zeal andacknowledged ability, i did every thing in my power, going even if anything to too great lengths, to induce him to modify his hastily formed views, and by careful explanation to get him to understand and accept the course, which my experience in Frontier affairs, and duty as the person responsible for the proper administration of this Province, pointed out to me to be the correct one. 4. For convenience, in reviewing the subject, the remarks I had to make on Colonel Phayre's letter are placed opposite the paragraphs to which they apply. i have the honour to be, Riffht Honorable Sir, Your most obedient servant. Colonel, Commissioner in Sind,No. 12G0 or 1870. Remarks hy the Commissioner in Slnd* 2. Copies of tlie derrri-official correspond ence alluded to are appended. They will I think tend to show your Excellency, that every consideration has been paid by me to Colonel Phayre, and every possible effort made to in duce him to act with proper consideration and due justice to all. 3. The interested persons I intended to refer to in my previous letter were Moonshees, and the different Belooch about who, from experience, I know to be very ready to impose, if they saw an opening, and every new person is liable to afford such. 4. It was quite right taking up Moolla Ma homed's case where Sir 11. Green lett it, and I entirely approved of such being done. But when Moolla Mahomed refused the liberal and g , i od terms offered him by the Khan, lie forfeited Political Department. From, The Political Superintendent, Frontier Upper Sind. To, The Commissioner in Sind, Jacobabad, 3rd September 1870. Sir, I have the honor to acknowledge the No. 519 dated 20th August 1870, rece ipt of letters ' ^ '• ^ noted at margin, „ 5-21 ^ 23rd , T # 0 ' ., 522 ^ 23nl „ which I find are From the Commissioner in Sind, . 1 . . To the Political Superintendent on filled With aCCUSa- the Frontier. . • tions against me. 2. I have already afforded you explanation upon a series of similar charges in my demi- oliicial dated 1st instant, in reply to yours of the 28th ultimo, and I am glad to avail my self of the present opportunity of answering the present ones. 3. Commencing with your letter No. 519, I observe that in the 2nd para, you state that when I first came to the Frontier in 1808, you invited me to free intercourse with yourself, because ' of the risk I ran of being led by ' the misrepresentations of interested persons ,e to adopt a line of policy contrary to that ' which has been steadily adhered to since the ' commencement of the late General Jacobs ' rule on the harder, an I which had proved so ' erumantly successful.' 4. In the first place I beg to state that T am at a loss to conceive who the interested per sons are to whom you refer, as likely to have misrepresented matters to me, because, besides yourself, I have not consulted any person on( 2 ) all claim to our sympathy, or any further interposition in his behalf. Colonel Phayre forgets also that Sir H. Green only consented to interpose on condition that both sides agreed to abide by his arbitration. I have nowhere pointed out that Colonel Phayre should reject the arrangement entered into by Sir II. Green. Ehelat affairs. Indeed, I have already in formed you that the first official document placed in my hands on my arrival, was the last report written by Sir Henry Green, on the eve of his departure from the Frontier, dated 14th April 1868, in which he records his last advice to the Khan as follows ;—■ ' * * I then wrote to His Highness ' the Khan, who was at Khelat, pointing out ' that these Chiefs had received severe and ' well merited punishment at his hands, and ' suggesting that it would be for his benefit ' and the well-being of his country, if they ' were forgiven and allowed to return to their ' homes. In due time I received a reply from ' His Highness, saying that he placed every- ' thing in my hands, that he would agree to ' any arrangement I might suggest.' 5. But what I have objected to in Colonel Phayre's proceedings is, that after Sirdar Moolla Mahomed had ungratefully spurned the Khan s generous treatment, he. Colonel Phayre, per sisted in considering Sirdar Moolla Mahomed injured, and unfortunate, and that it was ne cessary we should interfere in his and other Sirdars' behalf, to the extent of forcincy the t O Khan to yield to what they demanded, how ever unreasonable. This was the new policy I objected to, as totally different to what had been previously carried out, which had for its object always the improvement of the Khan's position and power, not lowering it as Colonel Phayre would do. Had Colonel Phayre been allowed to carry out his own views, the Khan would have felt ill-treated and justly affronted ; placed in direct antagonism to us, the rebel Sirdars would have been made by us triumphant over their Sovereign, and in a short time would have again attempted his dethronement, and removal altogether. There being no adult suc cessor of the blood Hoyal, a struggle for power would have ensued between Moolla Mahomed, the Jam of Bey la, and Azaad Khan, and the whole country would have been convulsed. 5. This report, and the policy it represented, received the full approval of Government, and had I rejected it, and adopted some other, I should have been justly open to the charge of intro ducing a new line of policy on the border, but the real fact is, that from this and a host of precisely similar documents, I received, and have retained my impressions regarding Khelat affairs, and not, as you would now make it appear, from the misrepresentations of interested persons.[17^ ( 3 ) C. Tlio quotation from Sir II. Green's letter 6. Moreover tliat this policy was of eleven can scarcely be said to apply to Colonel Phayre's years standing at the very least, and not an action. The latter was unmistakeably siding ephemeral production of mine I shall proceed with one party, the Sirdars, and in a way that would be far from for the good of the whole. Sir Henry Green's report No. 712 of 185H, 29th December. 10. The commencement of this para, is like ly to mislead. General Jacob's policy was, as I have over and over again pointed out to Colonel Phayre, to steadily endeavour to promote the establishment of a fjood and strong Govern- o o ment in Khelat, and to do so through, and by supporting, the Khan as long as he proved him self faithful to the Treaty, and fit to govern. to prove. At the very commencement of his connection with Khelat, Major Hen ry Green expressed himself as follows : ' Du- ' ring the time I have been in the country, my ' policy has been to distinctly side with neither &lt;£ party, but to faithfully and scrupulously act ' for what I considered the good of the whole. ' To allow myself to be biassed by no party c&lt; feeling, or to enter into or acknowledge any ' intrigue.' 7. 1 have given these quotations from the two extremes of Sir Henry Green's connection with Khelat affairs, viz. 1858 and 1868, to show that what was begun in the one year, was faithfully adhered to in the other, and that there was a steady adherence to it generally in the interim may be gathered from my ' Abridged narrative of Khelat affairs' dated December last. 8. That this was general Jacob's policy, I am now in a position to prove, having found several of his letters in 1858 to Sir H. Green at Khelat since I commenced writins: this letter, and which I have seen now for the first time. 9. I hnve been very particular in quoting the above passages, because you have distinctly charged me with initiating a new line of policy ' contrary to that which has been steadily ' adhered to since the commencement of the ' late General Jacob's rule on the border, and ' which had proved so eminently successful.' 10. You have defined General Jacob's policy as follows, as quoted in para. 7 of your letter under reply :— ' The policy I would wish you to follow is, ' that of friendly counsel to His Highness the ' Khan, as the sole person in Beloochistan with ' whom we have any right or reason to( t &gt; Colonel Phavrc, by forcing the Sirdars on the Khan, would have irretrievably broken the Khan's power. 11. The policy quoted in the 7th para, of my letter was the one I laid down for Colonel Phayre's guidance, founded on the general prin ciples followed by General Jacob, myself, and Sir H. Green from the first. - 12. Nos. 2, 3 and 4 are, as above stated, what Colonel Phayre was told strictly to follow, be cause he had clearly shown by his letters in April and May 1869, that as little as possible should be left to his discretion and judgment, from a tendency he had to make general prin ciples so general, as to apply them to the exact opposite of what they were intended for. AVhat- ever the Political Superintendent did, it had to l&gt;e reported to tike Commissioner, and was sub ject to his approval and that of Government. 13. The instance given here is quite one in point of how General Jacob managed things through the Khan and for his good. There was no supporting any one against the Khan. Inl852Moolla Mahomed lloossem, the Wuzzeer of Meer Nusseer Khan, then Khan of Khelat, deliberately asked at a!) interview at Jacobabad, at which I was present, the consent of the British Government to his usurpation of the Khanate. This trross act of treachery General O J .Jacob immediately brought to the notice of the Khan, explaining to him, that all his. General Jacob's, elforts for the good of His Highness ' communicate. That we are in no way entitled ' to interfere between him and his nobles, or sub- ' jects, and to carry out this policy fairly and 'justly, it is above all things most important ' that it should in no way be shown that we are meddling in the affairs of his country by identifying ourselves openly with the cause ' of those who are acting in opposition to him.' 11. This may be divided into the following heads : 1st.—Friendly counsel to the Khan allowed. 2nd.—The Khan to be the sole person in Beloochistan with whom we are to communicate. 3rd.—We are not entitled to interfere be tween him, his nobles, and subjects. 4th—Not to meddle in the affairs of the country. 12. No. 1 requires no comment. All concur in that Nos. 2 r 3 and 4 however were not General Jacob's policy in the absolute sense of invariable non-intervention, as you have defined it, though they were no doubt general princi ples, subject to the discretion and judgment of the Political Superintendent on the Frontier, who always acted according to the emergency or otherwise of circumstances at the time being, without reference to any one, but report ing fully to the Commissioner. 13. Por instance, at the time of ratifying the Treaty in 1851, General Jacob, after a good deal of trouble apparently, succeeded in inducing the last Khan to dismiss his traitorous Prime Minister, Mahomed Hussun, and on that occa sion he pointed out to the Khan that ' the difii- '■ clilties between the two Governments had been 'caused by the conduct of some of your High- ' ness* Officers, especially of the Wuzzeer, Maho- a med Hussun.'( wore paralysed, if such people were retained about him, and that he was being thwarted by the Khan's Officers. The ones alluded to parti cularly were Moolla Mahomed Hoossein, his brother Moolla Mahomed Ameen, and their relative Futti Khan, a Minghul Chief. 14. Faiz Mahomed, a Babee Merchant, was a very poor individual. The Bunyah, Gungaram, and the Darogah, Gool Mahomed, were deadly hostile to the British, and were seriously inju ring the Khan's (now Khodadad Khan) power. General Jacob repeatedly advised their removal, and at last, with the approval cf the Commis sioner in Sind, Sir Bar lie Frere, called on the Khan to remove them, which was done. This was surely not forcing any one on the Khan, or lowering his power. It was inducing him to act himself, and to remove people who were doing him and his country harm. Colonel Phayre makes a greivous mistake in here call ing the present Prime Minister, Shahgassee AVullee Mahomed, ' the son of the Daroirah, ' o 7 Gool Mahomed/' lie is no relation whatever to the Darogah. On the latter's removal from office, his successor, Shahgassee Wullee Mahomed, was selected by the Khan as the most trusty, and able man in all Beloochistan, and the selection was fully approved by the British authorities, and also by the Chiefs of Beloochis tan. AVell has the Shahgassee borne out that reputation. 15. Interference advisedly used and appro ved by superior authority, having for its object the good of the Khan, and of the country. Colonel Phayre had to be restricted from inter fering, because he showed the one idea he held was, that we were bound to keep the Khan from what he called ' dracfooninn: it over his sub- o o ' jects under our moral support.' This was in A pril 1869, and in December of the same year, he upheld the same doctrine, viewing the acts of the Khelat Government as solely faulty, and the refractory nobles as unfortunate victims. 14. Again, in 18o7, a merchant named Faiz Mahomed, and a Bunvah named Gunofaram, as y j o ' also the old Darogah Gool Mahomed, who had just murdered his master, the good Xusseer Khan, because of his real honest friendship to us, rendered themselves obnoxious to the Political Superintendent, and they were dismissed ; tiie present Prime Minister, Shagassee Wullee Ma homed, the son of the old Daroga just named, being appointed Prime Minister in his father's place. 15. Thus between 18.'4 and 1858 four of the Khan's advisers and Prime Ministers were dismissed, and the present one appointed, all owing to the direct interference of the Political Superintendent on the Frontier. 10. Active intervention with Ministers, 16. This shows that active intervention was Khans, and Chiefs was not a necessary part ot an essentially necessary part of General Jacob s( 6 ) General Jacob's policy. It was certainly not adopted with the first and last, and only with the second under exceptional circumstances. Such circumstances have not occurred since August 1868, and I therefore considered Colonel Phayre's proposed interference with the Khan's Government as unwarranted, and such as it would be most unjust to sanction. 17. From this para, to 20, inclusive, extracts are given from correspondence between General Jacob and Sir Henry Green, at the time when the Daro^ah Gool Mahomed and the Bunniah Gungaram had the young Khan completely in their power, and were using that power for the injury of the Khan and country, and to the detriment of British interests. The words then used were fully justified by the then exist ing state of affairs, but are not applicable to the present. The events then occurring induced General Jacob to consider it advisable that the Political Agent should be withdrawn from the Court of the Khan. But the Khan seeing in time the force of what was pointed out to him, removed the Darogah and the Bunniah from office, and the Political Agent remained at his post. There is no such evil influence affecting the Khan now, the Minister he has is a tried and trusty person, approved by the British Go vernment, and the Khan has in all things shown himself ready and willing to act in accordance with the expressed wishes of the authorities of that Government; witness his demeanour to Sirdar Moolla Mahomed in May 186i. The Khan's character has undoubtedly much im proved of late, and therefore the expression of ' the evil nature of his successor'' is no longer suitable. The good work Sir Henry Green is said to have accomplished amongst the Chief tains of Beloochistan refers to the excellent effect the straiofhtforward manlv conduct of o *j that Officer had on all he was brought in con tact with. policy with Ministers, Khan, and Chiefs also, when he saw that matters were going wrong. It is clear too that the power which removes and appoints Prime Ministers virtually rules the country. 17. I now proceed to give General Jacob's letters to Major Henry Green at Khelat (two en tire, and two in extracts) when he was there fighting the battle of the Chiefs and others with the present Khan, as related last year in my n &gt; abridged narrative of Khelat affairs :—• ' Jacohabad, 2Srd August 1858.—* * * I asked— when unable to write myself to write to you, to retnrn to me at once with all your party, giving the Khan the letter which I sent to you to be used on such an occasion. Please now do so. Come back to me as soon as con venient. Your remaining longer will only do harm * * * * * The good you have done in Beloochistan will still remain ours after your departure.'^ * * The death of the late Khan and the evil na ture of his successor, have rendered it necessary * * to re-arrange our whole proceedings, but there need not be, and shall not be, if I can prevent it, any change of principles of action * * De tails vary with the time and circumstances, true principles are always the same, however the form of their application may change. I wrote advisedly about Futteh Khan, and fully saw all the consequences you mention, and others also, but still it is as I wrote to you. * * You have done most excellent service, and need not be dissatisfied because you could nob do more. It is if no use our making our own particular link in the chain, immensely strong a when all the others are weak, that is the best piece of work ichich is best proportioned to the whole. I shall, I am confident, succeed in get ting the whole imperial apparatus into a more healthy state before long, and meanwhile I am still more confident that the good work you have accomplished amongst the Chieftains of( 7 ) 18. The remarks on previous para, apply equally to this. The Khan was not then show ing a friendly part to us, because he had as ' his chief adviser one bitter enemy'. This is not so now. The real intentions of the Chiefs had not then fully developed themselves, and as they were acting against the person who was injuring the Khan and country, their attitude towards Sir Henry Green, and exertions in the cause of the Khan, as supposed then, claimed General Jacob's approbation. Beloochistan will stand, and eventually lead to great good. * * *—(Signed) J ohn J acob.' IS. Again three days after, on the 26th Au gust 1858, General Jacob wrote to Major Henry Green at Khelat— ' 1 had written the accompanying when your letter of the 21st arrived. Nothing could have been better than all you have been doing, and saying from first to last, and whatever may be the state of things now, most excellent results must very shortly ensue from the noble way in which you have fulfilled the delicate and dange rous duty entrusted to you. All that you now write only confirms me in the correctness of my determination to with draw you from the Court of Khelat at present. I will no longer work with this young knave, who is unworthy to be ranked amongst Princes. Wo will now readjust the board, and go to work in another way. All will come right if I can get recruits. I do not think that Government will object much longer to my raising any force I think proper here. Meanwhile come back to me, telling the Khan that I will not place, as a friend at his Court, a representative of the English Govern ment, while I now find that he, the Khan, is not friendly to us, and that he has taken as his chief adviser our bitter enemy ; and thank- ino- all the Chiefs for their friendly and bono- O ^ rable proceedings which, assure them from me, will ere long meet with full reward. The way you have behaved to that Gool Mahomed delights me. I wish the Chiefs had publicly executed him before departing for Punjgoor. I will tell you all about everything viva voce. It is long to discuss all on paper, but it is clear to me now that a little open threa tening of our frontier now from without could O do good, and I should even be glad to be at tacked. (Signed) John Jacob.''( 8 ) 19. The Khan by listening to the advice of a man known to be bitterly, and almost openly, hostile to the British Government, was thwart ing General Jacob's measures for the establish ment of the Khan's authority. General Jacob's object was to establish that authority on a sound basis, and not to take from it. The Khan fortunately saw this, and dismissed the Darogah, and his associate. 20. The influence Sir Henry Green had gained in Beloochistan, supported cordially by the Political Superintendent on the Frontier, was quite as stated by General Jacob. Colonel Phayre neglects to support the present Political Agent, and terms the wholesome influence Captain Harrison has gained with the Khan, by his firm and prudent conduct, ' partizanship,' and even goes the length in more instances 19. Again, on the 29th August 1858, Gen eral Jacob wrote to Major Green.— &lt;c Your letters of the 22nd and 23rd reached me this morning, all that you say therein is right enouofb and was well known to me. But I can- not consent to keep 'with the Khan of Khelat a British representative, while the Khan himself is secretly but perseveringly thwarting all our measures for the establishment of his authority, and the good Government of his country, while he retains in a position of trust and honor, and listens to the advice of a man, known to be bitterly, and almost openly hostile to the British Government, and whom we know to have caused the murder of the late Khan; while he has al lowed, if not encouraged, attempts at corrupt ing our soldiers, and has endeavoured to annoy yourself and your escort in all manner of petty ways, such as impeding the supply of provi sions, &amp;c., and last, not least, while he witholds from the army serving him in the field the supplies, and payments necessary for their maintenance, although bis existence as a Sove reign Prince may depend on the conduct of this army, and the Chiefs have been induced to as semble to exert themselves in his cause by rea son of the influence of the British representa tive only. Either Gool Mahomed and all advisers hostile to our interest must be at once publicly dis graced and removed from all employment, and the Khan must fairly and actually without any underhand opposition take up the line of policy which you have indicated to him, and by follow ing which alone his rule can prosper, or we must withdraw the British mission from his Court. On no other terms can you remain a day longer with hope of ultimate advantage. (Signed) John Jacob.' 20. On the 17th September 1858, General Jacob again wrote to Major Green at Khelat as follows ' r * * ' 1 have more than once indeed reported that I consider your influence in Be loochistan to constitute a force as valuable to us as an army of 10,000 soldiers. * * * I wish you would now at leisure pre pare a report, sketching lightly the proceedings( 9 ) than one of doubting the accuracy of that Offi cer's statments, thus placing the Political Agent in a most embarrassing and dangerous position, instead of according him the generous counte nance, which was General Jacob's invariable habit with his subordinates. 21. Colonel Phayre's summary of the course lined out by General Jacob in the remarks sub mitted bv him to the Khan, with the draft . Treaty in 1854, is very correct. It is exceed ingly hard that the Khan, having passed through the fire of heavy misfortunes, and come out relieved of the evil points in his character, which helped to bring those misfortunes upon him, should find the support, so distinctly pro mised him by General Jacob, withdrawn. That when he is really endeavouring to act up to the fourth injunction, as recently proved, he should have his efforts misunderstood by the Officer holding the same post General Jacob did, and find himself coerced into favorably re ceiving, and into giving power, to subjects who have repeatedly rebelled against his authority, are still in sullen opposition to him, and who have refused the liberal concessions, which at the request of that British authority, he had generously conceded. The Treaty of 1854 was concluded with Meer Nusseer Khan, and fully accepted by his successor, Meer Khodadad Khan, the present Khan. In faithful attachment to the British Government, it has repeatedly been reported, he lias never failed, lie is now doing his best to follow General Jacob s wise counsels, and I certainly consider is deserving of our warmest support, not opposition. 22. General Jacob pledged himself to support the Khan with ' every effort in his power to bring about the establishment of order and good Government in Khelat dominions,' and we are bound to redeem that pledge, while he is doing all in his power to secure justice to all. In giving our support, we must however be most careful not to intrude anything that will be derogatory to his position, or tend in the of yourself and others in Beloochistan since you left the plains, and appending a memo : of any circumstances worth mentioning of which you may have notes, with respect to the nature, re sources and statistics generally of Beloochistan, or any particular part of, or towns in it, and respecting the people, their chief history, &amp;c. The slightest information of the kind will be highly valued by Government. (Signed) John Jacob.' 21. The report then called for by General Jacob was furnished in December 1858, and bears date 4th of December of that year. It il lustrates General Jacob's policy in all its branches, as declared by him at the ratification of the Treaty in 1854. That policy is as fol lows. The words are his own, summarised :— 1st. The exertion of everv effort in his power to bring about the establishment of or der and good Government in Khelat domi nions. 2nd. Strong advice to His Highness to pro tect life and property. 3rd. No oppression or violence to be allowed by great or small. 4th. Justice to be strictly administered to all men. Cultivators and traders to be encoura ged and protected. Hoads made safe and easy, no private transit or such like exactions to be allowed. 5th. ' Your Highness may rest assured that no effort will be wanting on my part to en able your Highness to carry out measures such as I have alluded to, and that they and they only can lead to the prosperity of your Highness, your nobles, and your people.' 22. In this partial summary of the memo- moranda, which accompanied the Treaty in 1854, we see that General Jacob pledges himself to ' exertion,' effort, and strong friendly advice to secure justice for all—king, nobles, and people. No one is excluded, ' great or small.'( 10 ) least to lower that authority which was Ge neral Jacob's object to establish, and should still be promoted. 23. In 1858, when General Jacob wrote, the present Khan had only been a little more than a year on the throne. He was but a youth, was completely under the evil influence of two bad men, and, as has since appeared, was thus early being made the catspaw of two rival factions, each struggling for the supreme power in the State. 24. The state of affairs in 1858 in no way resembles what it was 10 years later, or now. The general policy I have maintained towards the Khelat State is precisely the same as that laid down by General Jacob. The only differ ence is, that the support which the Political Su perintendent on the Frontier always merited and received has unfortunately been compulsorarily withheld from Colonel Phayre of late, because he persisted in advocating views in regard to that policy, which I was convinced, were dangerous, 23. This occurred in 18ji, and in 1858 we see its practical application exemplified in Ge neral Jacob's own letters and Sir Henry Green's report. In those documents we have presented before us the Political Agent at Khelat bat tling in British interests against oppression and injustice—fighting in fact for nobles and people against the Khan. The Political Superintend ent, General Jocob, is at Jacobabad, supporting him in his ' difficult and dangerous' task. His eulogy on Sir Henry Green, and entire approval of all his proceedings, are summed up in these words.—' I have more than once indeed re ported that I considered your influence in Beloochistan to constitute a force as valuable to us as an army of 10,000 soldiers.' General Jacob's language to the nobles was— ' thank all the Chiefs for their friendly and ho norable proceedings, which, assure them from me, will ere long meet with full reward. 5 His lan^uasre to the Khan was indeed a o o contrast to the above. It was— 'Either Gool Mahomed, and all advisers hostile to our interests, must be at once publicly dis graced, and removed from all employment, and the Khan must farily and actually, without any reserve or underhand opposition, take up the line of policy which you have indicated to him, and by following which alone his rule can prosper, or we must withdraw the British mission from his Court. On no other terms can you remain a day longer with hope of ultimate advantage.' 24. This was the late General Jacobs policy in theory and practice on the eve of his death in 1858. It was a policy which, as I have often expressed it, ' stemmed the tide of Khelat politics,' and insisted upon justice to all nobles and people. No other will ever produce the fruits specified as aimed at on its first announce ment, or make Khelat a really strong friendly power on our border. From that time up to my arrival on the border in 1868, the records show that as a general rule, an intelligent and( 11 ) which would never have been entertained by General Jacob, and which were certainly not held by me, when I had the honor of succeeding that distinguished Officer, and endeavoured to carry out his intentions, with which from close intimacy and serving under him for a great many years, I was in a position to be thoroughly acquainted with. judicious interference in Khelat affairs was exercised by the Political Officers on the border, supported by the Commissioner in Sind, and the Bombay Government—seeSirBartle Frere's, Lord Elphinstone's, and Sir Henry and Major Malcolm Greens' reports passive. 25. Taking up Sirdar Moolla Mahomed's case, and that of the other Chiefs, as promised by Sir Henry Green, met with my entire appro val. But when ' they were forgiven, and al lowed to return to their homes' in possession of their hereditary estates, all that had been promised, or was just to expect, had been per formed, and by their refusal of the Khan's favor, they rendered themselves unworthy of further consideration, as well as showed that they disregarded the terms under which Sir Henry Green had consented to act. I deny that there is anything to show that the Khan 'never meant to perform his promise, if he could help it.'' On the contrary, his every act since has gone to prove that he was sincere when he made it. He gave the Mittree lands back to Hybut Khan, the brother of Moolla Mahomed, and has since received Alia DInna Khoord into favor, on his presenting himself at Khelat- 26. The statements in this para, that di rectly Captain Harrison was appointed Political Agent at Khelat in 1869, i( the Khelat Govern ment took to its old habit of organising treachery and secret thwarting,'' is mere suppo sition on Colonel Phayre's part, and is not borne out by the recorded facts. Colonel Phayre chose to assume at the time, that such was the case, and I immediately pointed out to him the great impropriety of doing so, unless there was ^ clear proof to warrant such an assertion. There was none, and I regret exceedingly to observe that Colonel Phayre should again venture on such a grave charge against the Khan and his Government, as if he had just reason for doing so. There was no manifest act of hostility on the part of the Klian, and therefore, the Sir dars were not justified in marching towards 25. On arrival, I, as already reported, at once took up Sirdar Moolla Mahomed's cause and that of the other Chiefs, on my predecessor's own arrangement, concurred in by the Khan himself, ' that it would be for his benefit and ' the well-being of his country, if they were ' forgiven and allowed to return to their homes.'' I beo- to draw special atten- See para. 28. , • ji • « . • -m tion to this fact 01 the Khan s promise, because the sequel will show that he never meant to perform it, if he could help it. If lie had, he would have listened to what I said long before I thought of sending the Chiefs to Khelat. 26. It was eventually arranged in March 1869 that Captain Harrison, having been just appointed Political Agent at Khelat, should occupy the relative position that Sir Henry Green did in 1858 'when maintaining the same good cause. No sooner however was this de cided, than the Khelat Government took to its old habit of organising treachery and secret thwarting, even at Jacobabad itself, where an assassin entered the camp of the Sirdars as a guest, and accompanied them on their march towards Khelat. This scoundrel ran a muck, killino; one Chiefs son and wounding several. o o The principal Sirdars happily escaped. This manifest art of hostility, which was quite in keeping with the former experience of the Sir dars, as Khelat history proves, drove them to meet the Political Agent, accompanied by a( 12 ) Khelat at the head of 3,000 armed men. The very fact of Sirdar Moolla Mahomed going to Bey la, and joining the notoriously hostile J am of Beyla, was of itself an act most offensive to the Khan. But even that was pardoned by the Khan on the interposition of the Political A^ent. Whether the numbers were half, or equal to those at Khelat, matters little, the Sirdars went in hostile form to make demands from their Sovereign, a thing which can hear no other name than deliberate rebellion. force of about 3,000 men, only half the strength of the Khan's forces at Khelat. 27. I expressed no doubt whether ' it was optional or not with Captain Harrison to have taken the Sirdars to Khelat or not.' My words were ' it does not appear from the records, whether you gave any written in structions to Captain Harrison on his leaving for Khelat.' No copy had been forwarded to me, but as Captain Harrison alluded after wards to some, I noted the matter, to place on record that I had suggested to Colonel Phayre that he should not be so trammelled. I con clude now that what instructions he did re ceive, were verbal. I am still of opinion that it would have been the more correct course, that Captain Harrison should, on first entering the country as Political Officer, have gone direct to the Khan, and not have held communica tions with -any one else before presenting himself at the Khan's Court. Fortunately, Cap tain Harrison's prudent conduct prevented any mischief resulting, and the Khan's good feeling deterred him from taking umbrage. Captain Harrison's difficulties were also relieved, he says, by the receipt of my instructions forward ed through you, ' which clearly defined the policy to be pursued,' and apparently enabled him to bring affairs to the proper issue that followed. 27. It was optional with Captain Harrison to have taken them on to Khelat or not, under such altered circumstances, on which point you have expressed a doubt in the 5th para, of your letter under reply; but he at length resolved to do so. He had doubts about it, which he waived for the following reasons :— ' My first intention was to decline to receive ' them, but taking into con- Extract para. 2 of Capt. . .. .i i. .i i i Harrison's report No. 9, SlueratlOU tliat tlie 'UllOie of 9tli Juue 18G9. ,, ir n c m u \ alley 01 Bhagwana was ' covered with luxuriant crops of wheat and ' barley nearly ready for reaping, I thought it ' would be better to temporise with them, as ' they would otherwise have plundered and de- ' vastated the whole country. At this critical ' moment I received the Commissioner's letter ' No. 266, which clearly defined the policy to be ' pursued.' * * 28. I consider that Colonel Phayre is in no way justified in making the statement which com mences this paragraph. The letters he wrote at the time clearly showed that he was doing any thing but following General Jacob's polic} 7 , and that in his mistaken view of the merits of the case of the Sirdars, he was drifting most unne cessarily into a course of direct opposition to 28. From that moment the policy of Gene ral Jacob and Sir Henry Green, which I was steadily pursuing, as all my letters of that pe riod prove beyond question, fell to the ground. The rest is easily told. The whole party went on to Khelat, and the Khan, adroitly used the altered state of affairs, which he well knew to be the results of the assassin's attack, as( 13 ) the Khan. This T pointed out to him at the time, and I found it necessary to lay down rules for his guidance, and for that also of the Politi cal Agent at Khelat. These met with the ap proval of the Government of Bomuay, and the Government of India, and were ordered to he observed, but I regret to say Colonel Phayre has failed to accept them as they were intended. Ever since then he has persistently endeavour ed to prove he was right in supporting the Sir dars' cause, even after what followed at Khelat, and to maintain that we were bound to force the Khun to accept any demands they might choose to make. It is not clear either how Colonel Phayre can state that in March, April, and May 1869 he was steadily pursuing the policy of General Jacob and Sir Henry Green, when in December of the same year, in his statement of Khelat affairs, he acknowledges that it was on ly after close examination of the records of the office, that he had arrived at a clear, and full understanding of what had been done, and what ought to be done. At page 71 of the printed papers submitted to Government in January 1870, there is the following passage—' I need hardly say that had I known the whole of the facts now produced, before assuming the task in March last, of trying to reconcile the Khan with the Jalawan and Sahara wan Chiefs, and to obtain justice for them, I should not have attempted using the ordinary means of repre sentation for that purpose.' In December, he had only just fully mastered what he now states he was steadily pursuing in the previous spring. I must again repeat that Colonel Phayre is wholly unjustified in stating that ' the Khan adroitly used the altered state of affairs, which he well knew to be the results of the assas sin's attack, as evidence of rebellion on the part of the Sirdars.'' Sirdar Moolla Mahomed's disregard of Colonel Phayre's instructions and my wishes that he should not go to Beyla, the collection of armed men there, the arrangements made with Azaud Khan, that he should meet them on their way to Khelat, and their advan cing at the herd of an armed body close to Khe lat, showed their determination was to try and jn'ess their demands by force, a procedure which can be called by no other term than rebellion. The Khan gave his promise to Sirdar Moolla See para. 25. evidence of rebellion on the part of the Sirdars. The Khan, it is true, went through the form of promi sing to restore all hereditary rights ; but he at tached to that promise such conditions, that, after all that had happened, and seeing the Po litical Aofcnt himself sidinf* with the Khan, the o o ^ Sirdars w r ere naturally enough afraid to trust him. The result however of all was that Captain Harrison gave them a pass as a guarantee that they would not be molested, if they went to their homes. This thev agreed to do, and thev at once left Khelat enroute home, in obedience to those orders.( 14 ) Mahomed froely, and frankly, and there were no conditions attached to it that rendered it difficult of acceptance. lie was allowed to proceed to his own home in safety, his heredita ry lands were restored, but the Enam lands granted to him in 1864 for good service then done, and which were escheated on his misbeha- biour in 1805, being* a reward for ^ood conduct, would be withheld, until the Sirdar proved that he was deserving of their beinor re-srranted to O O O him. Nothing could be fairer or more liberal than this, but Moolla Mahomed listening to the Jam and Azaad Khan, and evidently thinking (vide his letter to Captain Harrison) that he would receive some further support from Colo nel P hay re, rejected the terms and hastily de parted for Cutchee, and, he gave out, Jacobabad. He was very properly not permitted to visit the latter. Instead of going quietly to their homes in obedience to orders, Moolla Mahomed went to the Affghan district of Seebee, while the Jam. and Nooroodeen, retired to their homes it is true, but only to mature plans for an exten sive rebellion, which they had already discussed in April when near Khelat, and which was to take place in the autumn. The Jam did carry out his plan in the end of September, but he was only backed by his relative Nooroodeen Mingul; the other Brahooee Chiefs he tried to incite to join, but they steadily held aloof. 29. The failure in obtaining any good result from our interposition was undoubtedly caused by the impracticability and ungrateful conduct of Moolla Mahomed. Colonel Phayre s attempted comparison of affairs is neither happy, nor just, while the acts and intentions he imputes to the Khan are nowhere proved. The tone and conduct alluded to in this para, is purely imaginary. When it is necessary to address severe remonstrance to the Khan, it will always be done in the same straightforward manner as before, but to attack His Highness on mere sur mise and hasty conclusions, would be most in equitable. 29. Thus ended the last ciTort at carrying out General Jacob s real policy, as exemplified in 1858, under his own working—vide paras. 23 and 24, above, and preceding letters. It is im possible to have better practical examples before us than the above, and that which is said to re present the same policy in 1869 afford. In the one case, the Khan yields to proper firmness on the part of the Political Agent, though the latter's life was in danger, and intimidation was not wanting. In the other, the same diabolical machinery is put in motion, but this time towards the Sirdars, and it succeeded too well. The Khan got his own way, and he has kept it ever since, until it has culminated in a tone and conduct which will produce yet worse results, unless checked by some of General Jacob's wholesome advice and thorough determination to call things by their right names.( 15 ) 30. The Khan's application to Captain Har rison to arbitrate in the Kumal Khan Village question, was no more than had been often done before to previous Political Agents, and was in tended to prevent the renewal of hostilities between the Khan and the Jam. The latter however was determined on further rebellion, and used this question as a continuous source of irritation. The Khan s wish that Captain Har rison should actively interfere and receive pos session of the Village was disapproved by me, and not allowed. stated here, and the florid description of the Jam smarting under a deep sense of wrong, &amp;c. is simply absurd. The Jam at first preten ded to accept the decision, and withdrew the man he had placed on the disputed lands. But suddenly he sent people to seize the revenues of the place, which constituted a gross insult to the Khan. The latter at once despatched his faithful Minister Wullee Mahomed, with a force to punish the Jam, and the operation being vigorously carried out, the ally, Nooroodeen, was first surprised and routed, and the Jam also shortly after sustained a complete defeat. One circumstance will show how much patriotism had to do with the Jam's conduct. When about to,tly from the fight, which he did at the very earliest, he told the mercenaries he had recently entertained to look sharp, and going to Beyla, the town of his own people, plunder it before the Minister could arrive. They did so, and the Ex-Jam actually had the impudence to claim articles of the plundered property, as his own, when thev were afterwards brought into Kurra- r O chee for sale by some of the mercenaries. 30. It would have been well however liad no further interference been attempted at such a time in the Sirdars' affairs, but unfortunately such was not the case, for no sooner had the Sir dars left Khelat under Captain Harrison's gua rantee, than the Khan finding how much more successful he had been than he eyer was with Sir Henry Green, or indeed any other British Agent, who had visited the Court before, went to Captain Harrison and asked him to arbitrate in the nature of an old dispute that he and the Jam of Lus Beyla had about the Jummal K1 ian estate, which was then in the Jam's pos session. Strange to say, in spite of the absolute orders he had received from the Commissioner, sooften repeated inthecourse of this correspond ence, he was unable to resist the Khan's influ ence, and unfortunately undertook the arbitra tion suggested, notwithstanding that the Jam was not present to defend himself in so im portant a civil and political suit. 31. The result was that Captain Harrison gave his decision against the Jam, who was eventually forced to give Up the property ; but naturally enough, being exasperated at the ad vantage which had been taken by the Khan in his absence to enlist the English Agent's power and decision against him, and smarting under a deep sense of wrong, he flew to arms, issued proclamations through the country, ac cusing Captain Harrison of having broken faith with him, and having very little time to pre pare for war, was defeated by the Khan's troops, who seized his country. The Jam and his fa mily iled for refuge to British territory, where •they now are in exile. 32. The first part of this para, would also, 32. All the other Sirdars, seeing the British 1 regret to say, give an impression quite power which had been so friendly to them( ) contrary to what should be held according to what under General Jacob and Sir Henry Green, now really occurred.

The ' brooding over wrongs' as well as the 'truly asserting' misjht be introduced into a romance, but should have no place here a bit more, than the implied inference that the Chiefs were not forgiven, and were not allowed to return to their homes. Sir Bartle Frere's remarks were applied to a very different state of affairs. 33. General Jacob's estimate of Sir Henry 33. If General Jacob was right in estimating Green's value was given in reference to his Sir Henry Green's value in Beloochistan at manly straightforward conduct, which com- 10,000 soldiers, when strenuously upholding the manded full respect.

In 1857 no immediate danger to us was threatened from Khelat. The young Xhan ascended the throne in June 1857. In September there was dread of a revolution, and Major (then Lieutenant) Macauley was sent to Khelat to assist the Khan, and adjust matters if possible. This he successfully performed. He went to Khelat without any escort, and on bis way refused to see Taj Mahomed Zehrec, who wished to complain, telling him he would see the Khan first, and then if any Chief or peasant had anything to say, he would be happy to hear it in the presence of the Khan.

He thanks them in another letter for their ' friendly and honorable proceedings, ' he eulogizes them for having in the moment of our need and the Khan's ' been ' induced to assemble and exert themselves in 'his cause, by reason of the influence of the ' British representative only.'' 34. We are in no danger of losing our in fluence as long as we deal justly, and fairly by all. In 1858 the Khan was found to be secret ly thwarting General Jacob's measures, by keeping with him, and acting in accordance with, the counsels of a man, who was our most bitter enemy, the Darogah. There is no Daro- gah now, there is one filling his place r Shah- gassee Wullee Mahomed, described in 1868 by Sir Henry Green, who knew him well, as having ' never failed to offer the best advice to His Highness the Khan in all matters,' and to ' his firmness and loyalty towards the Bri tish Government,'' he attributed most iqipor- tant results. There has been no opposition by the Khan, all he was asked to do he readily did, and I see therefore no reason to conclude that such a reply, as was given by General Jacob in 1858, should now be again requisite.' 34. Are we not in danger, T would ask, of losinsf that influence which was worth 10,000 soldiers to us in our hour of need, by pursuing our present policy 1 The question is a very important one for our national interests, inde pendently of those of absolute justice. And what was the Khan doing all the time that the Chiefs were thus aiding and supporting Sir Henry Green and General Jacob? The reply is General Jacob's, not mine. ' Secretly, but per- ' severingly thwarting all our measures for the ' establishment of his authority, and the good ' government of his country.' 35. General Jacob's complaint of the secret thwarting by the Khelat Government, alluded to in Colonel Phayre's letter, to which my No. 521 was a reply, undoubtedly referred only to the case of Wuzzeer Mahomed Hoossein in 1854, when Nusseer Khan was Khan; the associates alluded to on that occasion were the Wuzzeex's brother, Mahomed Ameen, who was Governor of Cutchee, and their connection Putti Khan, the Mingul Chief. In 1858, according to the papers since found by Colonel Phayre, the expression is again used towards the new Khan, Khodadad Khan, because he allowed himselftobemisled by another evil minister, the Darogah. No British Officer has 35. These expressions of General Jacob's I would here observe are a complete reply to your letter No. 521, of the 23rd ultimo, in which you impugn ' the very unnecessary suspicions *' and surmises formed by me with reference to ' proceedings at Khelat,'' and comment on ' the ' unfounded nature of the suspicions I had ' formed,' by endeavouring to show that Gene ral Jacob's complaints of the ^ secret thwarting ' of the Khelat Government was confined to Wuzzeer Mahomed Hussun's case, and was ap plicable to him solely, whereas even in 1854 when that expression was used. General Jacob distinctly associates ' others of His Highness'( 18 ) yet ever complained against the Shaligassee TTul- lee Mahomed, so why Colonel Phayre should per sist in trying to maintain that the same reme dies should be used, when the circumstances are totally different, is most inexplicable. 1 cer tainly also fail to see what ambitious, and sinis ter designs the Khelat Government have now, unless it be the desire of the Khan really to govern his country, and to insist on order and peace being maintained; most people would consider this a very creditable ambition in a Sovereisfn. 36. When the Shahgassee proposes to poi son Captain Harrison, and becomes a diaboli cal scoundrel like Gool Mahomed, it will be time to consider about withdrawing the Poli tical Agent from Khelat. It should also have been mentioned that, when General Jacob wrote in September 1858, Gool Mahomed and Gungaram had been dismissed by the Khan from their offices, and had no longer any thing to do with the Government, therefore the General's remarks applied only to those as evil individuals, not to the Khan. Officers with Mahomed Hussun, and now in 1858 he uses still stronger terms. If further evi dence however is wanted of what a Khelat Government is capable, when their ambitious and sinister designs are opposed, let the follow ing extract from General Jacob's letter of the 17th September 1858 to Major Henry Green bear testimony to it :— 36. ' Latterly, I have, to tell you the truth, ' thought that those diabolical scoundrels, Gool ' Mahomed &amp; Co., would be trying to get rid ' of you by poison or assassination in some ' way, and I felt that I had no right to subject ' you to the risk of such a fate. I would far ' rather lose my own life than do so. These ' villains, Gool Mahomed, Gungaram &amp; Co. are ' extensively connected with the intrigues now • ( ramified all over these countries. Their crea- ' tures are all about us. ' I knew that they must feel that you were ' their most formidable enemy. Other means ' failing, it was likely that this would be at- ' tempted. I had good reasons for knowing *' this not to be improbable. Pirst, from the ' proposal of the Murree to murder you at ' Gundava, and next, as you will see by the ' enclosed, which please return to me and show ' to no one. * * * * (Sd.) John Jacob.' 37. I do not see that the circumstances above alluded to are any justification for the Sirdars' proceedings and attitude, when they advanced from Beyla. It has just been shown that the Khan and his Government in September 1858, had nothing to do with the plot spoken of by General Jacob, and certainly the Sirdars had no fair reason for stating the attack of the assassin in 1869 was in any way countenanced by, or proceeded from, the Khan. The culprit was proved to be a madman, and Colonel Phayre should have been careful how he entertained any idea that the Khan was implicated in his 37. One may now appreciate and sympa thise with the feelings of the Sirdars when at tacked by the assassin, and give them credit for their ulterior proceedings being not entirely disconnected with the safety of their lives as asserted by them, because a power that would thus unblushingly plot to murder the British representative, because he was simply doing his duty, and had solely their good and that of the country at heart, would scruple at nothing; and having been long ago convinced of these truths from a close observance of passing events, I spoke advisedly, and with good reason, when( 19 ) acts. There has been no reason shown for the necessity of putting a check on the so-termed ' growth of the Khan's unbridled power,' and the expression is, I consider, most improper. A correct knowledge of human nature, and of events in Beloochistan, would have enabled Co lonel Phayre to form a more accurate opinion as to the objects of the Sirdars than the one he so persistently holds 38. The circumstance alluded to in this pa ra. is detailed in a report from Captain Harrison, copy of which is appended ; as also of Colonel Phayre s forwarding letter and my reply. The act of the Khan was undoubtedly barbarous and brutal, but he gives reason for it, which would go to prove it was done with a fair intention ; and certainly it is not necessary to conclude from it, that the Khan is capable of all Colonel Phayre asserts, though it is quite right, disap probation of such a proceeding should be mark edly shown, as was promptly and very properly done by Captain Harrison. Captain Harrison's Report No. 69, of 27th August 1870. 39. This para. I consider most unbecoming and highly disrespectful. I used the expression ' wholesome check on the growth of the Khan 's unbridled power, a which, in the 14th para, of your letter No. 510, &lt;c you designate as the very dangerous extent to which I carry my mistaken views.' The fact is that, having a good knowledge of human nature, it is easy to discern from the passing events of a country, and the condition of its inhabitants, throughout a lengthened period of time, the character of its rule. 38. Indeed a remarkable confirmation of my opinion as to the really unchanged character of the Khan has come to my notice whilst writing this letter—vide Captain Harrison's re port as per margin, which has filled that Officer with distrust, but O 7 that is not the worst of it. Arbitrarily to emasculate a man for any crime is equally against the laws of his religion and his country, and will not fail to fill his adherents with shame, and his enemies with more intense hatred of him and his rule than before, were such possi ble. It must be borne in mind that, amonjrst 7 o Brahooees and Bolooch, death is a light punish ment compared with a cruel and tyrannical pun ishment, that renders life burdensome from the shame to which it exposes the sufferer. 39. I trust that I have now adduced suf ficient evidence to disprove your two assertions ; first, that General Jacob's policy as defined by you in para. 10 above, has been ' steadily ' adhered to since the commencement of his ' rule with eminent successand secondly, that I have been attempting since my arrival on the Frontier to ' introduce some other policy.' If so, then all the accusations you have founded on those assertions fall to the ground. 40. In your 8th para, you charge me with ' adhering to the idea that the refractory Sir- ' dars were being unjustly oj)pressed, and that we were bound to force the Khan to comply ' with their demands, whether he liked it or ' not; and also that I persisted in advocating ' them, in my narrative of January last, in spite ' of my knowing that you dissented from them ' in toto.'( 20 ) 41, This para, also shows a very improper and disrespectful view of the relative positions of the Political Superintendent on the Frontier, and the Commissioner as the head of the Pro vince. Fair representation, of what he thought was the correct course to be followed towards the Khelat Government, was never denied to Colo nel Phayre; what was objected to by me was his persistently adhering to, and allowing his atti tude towards that Government to be guided by views, which I, as head of the Province, had pointed out to him repeatedly were wrong, and did not meet with my approval. In words he professed ' to give effect to whatever orders may be issued in his letter No. 1725, of 5th December 18G9, para 4, but in recent corres pondence especially, he has shown that he was disposed to work directly contrary to those or ders. Whatever his views may be, I maintain that he is bound to act in accordance with the instructions which I, as the person respon sible for the proper administration of the whole Province under Government, conceive it necessary, and expedient to give. The terms •used in this para, show a very wrong sense of the nature of due subordination to superior authority, and I trust that I may be fa vored with an early exposition of the wishes of your Excellency, in respect to the mode in which Political matters on the Frontier are to be conducted, so that I may be saved having to comment again on such a very improper line of conduct as Colonel Phayre has ventured on adopting in this letter. 41. In reply to this, I beg to acquaint you that my letter No. 1725 of 18G9, and the narrative that accompanied it, speak for them selves. As Political Superintendent on this Frontier, and Executive Officer of the whole Frontier administration, I, by virtue of the pow ers entrusted to me by Government, exercise full freedom of represention on all matters con nected with my duty, the only limit to those powers being that I address all my reports, &amp;c. to you as Commissioner of the Province, but to be obliged to mould and subordinate all my reports upon the detailed working of my sphere of administration, in all its branches, so as to correspond with your ideas, would be indeed an abdication of my proper functions; which I am bound in honor to exercise to the best of my ability, with the independence of mind that befits my position. After my reports leave my office they are open to fair criticism, and are accepted or rejected as may appear right to my superiors ; thus, though I brought out that nar rative 44 in spite of my knowing that you dis- ' sented from the opinions expressed therein' as you are pleased to express it, yet, I have to learn, that the Government was displeased at my bringing such a mass of distinguished evi dence to light, as that narrative contains ; indeed, it is the more valuable now, that I have been casually enabled to endorse it by the confirming evidence of General Jacobs letters. 42. In your 10th para, you state as fol lows— a now, however, that in addition to enun- ciating wrong views and principles of action, ' you have further ventured to act upon them, ' treating the Political Agent at Khelat unjust- ' ly, and censuring him when he was carefully ' and studiously carrying out the orders I had ' issued, I must interfere and desire that you ' will abstain from acting on the opinion you ' have chosen to form, and simply follow, both ' in your own conduct and in correspondence ct with the Political Agent Khelat, the instruc- ' tions quoted above. These you are well aware ' were aproved of by the Government of India iu Mr. Seton Karr's letter No. 961, of the 13th( 21 ) 44. The proof, mentioned herein, Is certainly not established, and T can imaofine nothing ' o o more different to the policy of General Jacob, than the course Colonel Phayre has pursued from the time he so unadyisably took up the cause of the Chiefs, after they had distinctly shown themselves unworthy of further consider ation. ' July 1809, and should not have been deviated ' from in the slightest degree, either in u thought or deed. I refer you to that letter as ' also showing that Captain Harrison is direct- ' ed to mark carefully all he sees and hears, and ' he should regularly report noticeable events ' to Government. I do this particularly here, ' because I notice in recent correspondence you ' take exception to Captain Harrison reporting matter that he heard, and which, I regret most to observe, you question the accuracy of ' that Officer's statement. This is a course ' most unbecoming in official correspondence, ' is most uncourteous to say the least of it, ' and merits most marked disapproval.' 43. The charges brought against me in this para, may be divided as follows :— 1st. —-That under 'wrong views and prin- ' ciples of action and the opinion I have chosen ' to form' I censured Captain Harrison when he was carefully carrying out your orders as above quoted in my 10th para. 2nd.—That I am not in future to deviate from these orders in the slightest deofree in O O thought or deed. 3rd.—That T have taken exception to Cap tain Harrison for reporting matter he had heard. 4th.—That by calling in question his state ments I have merited marked disapproval. 44. With regard to the first of these charges, I beg leave to state that what you term ' my wrong views and principles of action, and ' the opinion I have chosen to form,' I have abundantly proved by the evidence given in the first 38 paras, of this letter, to be General Jacobs and Sir Henry Green's, and that hav ing been endorsed by the approval of Govern ment, I, as in duty bound, adopted them and acted on them at once from the first month or so of my arrival on the Frontier ; I need there fore say no more on that point, but as regards my censuring Captain Harrison for carrying out any known orders of yours, I am at a loss to conceive how I have done so, as I will now proceed to show.( 22 ) 45. All the matters In this para, have been fully discussed before. I need only remark, that one very important point in dealing with Khelat affairs has entirely escaped Colonel Phayre's attention. That is the unquestionable necessity of according his fullest support, and confidence to the Officer holding the difficult, and delicate post of Political Agent at Khelat. This was a matter that was highly regarded by General Jacob and all his successors, till Colo nel Phayre. The withdrawal of support and confidence by Colonel Phayre dates back from correspondence which took place last November and December, on the subject of the Khan's ar- 1 rangements in Cutchee, and which was forward ed under my letter No. 159, of the 26th March 1S70, wherein f ' I was concerned to observe that perfect confidence in the Political Agent, Captain Harrison, is not reposed as it should be, or as Captain Harrison's able, and judici ous conduct, since he has been at Khelat, merits.' Colonel Phayre objected to Captain Harrison having cleared up certain misconcep tions, and Wrote about it in a way which could not fail to be most painful, and embarrassing to that Officer. 40. The Government orders I directed Co lonel Phayre s attention to, were those contained in Mr. Secretary Seton's Karr's letter No. 9.31, of the 13th July 1869, approving of the line of conduct I had laid down to be followed by the Political Agent at Khelat. My attention has been lately drawn by Government Resolution No. 2685, of 31st August 1870, to a Government Resolution of the same period, in which Cap- tiin Harrison Avas directed to report fully on all that occurred at Khelat, especially with re gard to the Province of Bey la lately brought under the Khan's direct control. I considered Colonel Phayre's remarks on Captain Harrison's report as most injudicious, and unjust to tliat Officer, and felt it was necessary to express my disapproval thereof. The Government Re solution No. 1712, of the 30th June last, was not referred to. But, as Colonel Phayre now quotes it, I would remark thai, as Government 45. In my letter No. 1110, dated 21 st July 1870, Captain Harrison sent in a report (No. 29 of 1870) purporting to be an account of Khelat affairs from the occupation ofLus Beyla in the end of (1869 to June 1870). I objected to its one-sided tone, and pointed out most impor tant omissions which ought to have been fully reported on in such a document, or at all events noticed^ if that were impossible. I next express ed my dissatisfaction at his not satisfying the Khan's curiosity about Captain Sandeman's visit to Kahun, which, from the conversations he acknowledges having had With you and my self on the subject, he certainly might have done, even though he Was not so precisely in formed as he has since explained he was not. I next expressed my dissatisfaction at his con duct in regard to the policy sanctioned in con nection with the Murree and Boosftee tribes now actually in force on a small scale. T also told him that I thought it was premature his telling the Khan, in connection with the Ameer of Cabool's advocacv of their cause, that he 7 did not think the British Government would take up the matter, 46. Looking at your orders, as quoted in your 7th para, of this correspondence, I see noth ing in them about either omitting to report events fullv, or omitting 1 to satisfy the Khan's * 7 CD curiosity, or about the Murree and Boogtee policy, or that he Was at liberty to make com munications to the Khan on behalf of Govern ment, when, in Government Resolution No. 1712 j dated 3rd June last, it was distinctly stated that ' the position of the .Khan and his relations to ' Sirdars will be considered in a separate Go- ' vernment Resolution.' Therefore it does not appear that I have censured Captain Harrison for ' carefully and studiously' carrying out your i orders, unless you have issued any orders to him that have not passed through me as principal Officer on the .Frontier.( had the question referred to therein still under consideration, he was bound, until Government issued other instructions, to abide strictly by the course I had laid down, and which had been approved. 48, I do not understand what Colonel Pliayre intends to convey when he says that he has not deviated from my instructions in deed. Almost since^ he received them, he has rejected their sense, advocated a totally contrary course, and lately has severely censured Captain Harri son for doing his best to faithfully carry out these instructions. The expression ' either in thought or deed'' is, I candidly own, more limiting in the first part than it might have been. But the slight est reflection on Colonel Phayres part should have shown him that ' expression of thought' 1 was intended, and that the remarks he makes on this point Were quite uncalled for. The word ' thought' was used in reference to a warning I had found it advisable to give him in my letter No. 35, of the 5th June 18(39,— ' Every little act of ours is watched so closely by these people, and significance attached often in a way least intended, that it is of the first importance to be most guarded against any demonstration of a leaning one way or the other.' Any expression of such thoughts as were entertained by Colonel Pliayre, in favor o,i the rebellious Sirdars, and in antagonism to the Khan, would be, I considered, most danger ous, and I was desirous therefore he should carefully avoid display of them. ) 47. You next order me not to deviate from those instructions in the slightest degree, in thought or deed.' 48. I have already proved that I have not deviated from them indeed in any one instance; I was the more particular about this, because 1 felt sanguine that as the arrangements regard ing the Murrees and Boogtees had been con curred in, matters would eventually come right; and I was determined that no act of mine should in the least degree give you cause for displeasure. Hence, since the occurrences at Khelat of last year, I have in no way directly or indirectly communicated with these Sirdars, as they themselves state in the intercepted corres pondence. I feel therefore your present attack as the more deeply unmerited. With regard however to my not deviating from your in structions in the slightest degree, in thought, I must respectfully submit that, in making such a demand, you go beyond your province entirely; and independently of that, you order what it is out of man's power, either to demand or give, when you arbitrarily attempt to subordinate my mind and powers of thought to your ideas. Even the slave whilst performing his daily drudgery quite faithfully to his master, is free in mind and thought, otherwise he would sink under his burden. Apart, however, from the higher principles of such a question, you must surely be aware that what the British Govern ment in every branch of its administration re quires, is an intelligent obedience to its orders, not the paralysis of mental power, and I must ask you to be so good as to submit your instruc tions on this point for the orders of Govern ment, it being impossible for any man to control his thoughts in the way you require me to do mine, and even could I do so, or rather were T to consent to suppress my honest conviction's( 24 ) 49. The censure I referred to was Colonel Pbayre accusing Captain Harrison of partizan- ship with the Khan, when he reported favora bly of His Highness' proceedings. This I considered most unjust, in the first instance, and in the next, as seriously trammelling Cap tain Harrison in the execution of his duties, and carrvinff out the orders of Government. O reofardinof the various branches of the adminis- O O tration under my charge, so as to present to Go vernment a lifeless uniformity with yours, would it be expedient or for the good of the State to do so \ In my humble opinion there can be only one answer to such a question. 49. You next accuse me of censuring Captain Harrison for reporting matter that he had heard, and quote the order of the Government of India desiring him to do so. I conclude that you refer to para. 4? of my letter No. 1110, dated 21st July last, in which, when speaking of that Officer's report on Lus Beyla affairs, what I really said, was as follows. . . . ' As it at ' present stands,the report would lead persons at a distance to conclude that you really spoke cc from personal knowledge, and not from the c&lt; hearsay accounts of interested persons. It ' would be better therefore I think to quote &lt;c the source of such information, which would ' then be estimated accordingly.' This certain ly is not censuring Captain Harrison for re porting what he had heard, as ordered by the Government of India. I do not think I touch ed on the subject in any other letter than the above. 50. My words were 'what I most regret ^ 011 sa y general terms that, b} call- to observe, you question the accuracy of that i n question certain of Captain Hauisons Officer's statements.' This undoubtedly in- statements, I have meiited maiked disappioval, fers that it was unjustly done. Colonel Phayre's but you do not say whether I have done so recent letters to Captain Harrison all display unjustly or not. In lepl} 1 to this, I ha\e oruy in some degree this questioning of accuracy, to soUcit tl)at iustances meriting such marked hut I referred particularly to some of Colonel disapproval may be pointed out, and should it Phayre's marginal notes to Captain Harrison's he proved that I ha\e acted unjustly in any letter No. 29, of the 21th June 1S70, especially comment that I have made in this respect. I to the ones against the 15th and last para', will acknowledge it at once and apologise, thereof. Captain Harrison justly points out, in concluding his letter Xo. 52, of the 5th August, that Colonel Phayre's review of his report eon- tains ' allegations that must affect my char acter, not only as an official, but as a private gentlemanshowing how much he felt what had been written.. I2S ( 25 ) 51, In your lifcli para, jour remark that the Khan might well appeal, if he understood that, contrary to the repeated orders of Goveruraent, I interfered to coerce him in matters so nearlv concerning himself and the Government of his country, as the settlement of questions be tween himself and his rebellious subjects ; and again, that you ' regret to have to observe that ' a very serious and most undesireable change ' has taken place in the action from and mode of procedure at Jacobabad, which the Khan ' has not merited, and which cannot be per- ' mitted to continue.' 52. The course referred to by me was Colonel Phayre's persistent antagonism to the Khan in all he has adduced during the past year, and now this has taken a more direct form, not to the Khan exactly, bat to the Political Agent at his Court, in unnecessarily limiting that Officer's powers. 52. In the first place I have already point ed out most clearly that I have not interfered to coerce the Khan contrary to the orders of Government. What I did attempt, was in car rying out Sir Henry Green's arrangement, con curred in by the Khan himself and approved by Government, that the Sirdars should bo a forgiven and return to their homes.' Indeed, no case of absolute and practical interference has taken place since I came to the Frontier, except that of Captain Harrison in the Kum- mal Khan estate dispute, between the Khan and the Jam of X*us Beyla—vide paras. 30 and 31, above. 53. The undesirable chanfje is the view Colonel Phayre takes of our relations with the Khelat Government. He cannot suppose for a moment that the ideas he holds are not known to those about him, and quickly spread far and wide. Even if they were not r the manner in which he allowed the Belooch Chief to ask his (Colonel Phayre's) permission to address the Khan, thus ignoring the latter, and putting Colonel Phayre as his governing authority, was quite sufficient of itself to show every one that His Highness the Khan was differently esteem ed at Jacobabad from what he used to be. 53. Then as to the serious and undesireable change now at Jacobabad from what it was. This is a point that I can enter upon with plea sure, no matter what branch of the Frontier ad ministration be referred to. 54. The first part of this para. I hold to be most unbecoming, and disrespectful. Any re marks I have felt compelled to make on Co lonel Phayre's proceedings can in no way be deemed attacks, but an expression of my opinion on matters emanating from him, which do 54. This however is a very serious matter, as reflecting highly upon my character as a public servant; and as I am entirely upon my defence in this matter, and have controlled the feelings 3 o of honest indignation which I have felt at your series of attacks, I will say no more at present than( 26 ) not meet with my approval. To style such at tacks is simply to abandon all idea of subordina tion, and it is with great astonishment I find ari officer of Colonel Phayre's long standing in the army should venture on making use of such an expression. It has nowhere been stated that Colonel Phayre addressed the Khan in an improper manner. Had he done so, it would have been immediately noticed. His letters to me about the Khan are not a very dift'erent matter—they are the chief question in point— and as being most unjust to that Sovereign, as well as showing intentions towards him con trary to those approved by Government, they called for my marked disapproval. The quota tion from Sir Henry Green's, Sir Bartle Frere's, and Lord Elphinstone's letters, all refer to a totally different state of affairs from the present. And I can scarcely conceive they are adduced as reason for following a different line of con duct to what I have demonstrated, as the only one which should now be adopted towards His Highness the Khan. 55. This is hardly to be brought about, by preventing the Political Agent reporting freely, and certainly does not appear likely to be ad vanced by the attitude towards the Khan Co lonel Phayre has shown throughout he himself would assume, 56. I distinctly maintain that there is nothino- * o that has occurred on the Frontier since Colonel Phayre came to it in August 1868, to show that secret, and persevering thwarting has been adopted by the Khan. All the latter s proceedings have been most open, and frank, and there has been nothing in this way to point that lie de served the imputations which Colonel Phayre that I court the fullest possible Investigation into everything. I have in this letter showed pretty clearly what the tone regarding Khelat affairs was before I arrived, and in all my letters to the Khan, it will be seen that I have been studiously courteous, because I always felt that he knew no better, and that I might lead a man of his stamp by kindness and manage ment. My official letters however to Govern ment about the Khan are a very different matter, even in those, however, I have never used such strong language as found in the letters pro duced in this correspondence. Indeed, I believe that Major Henry Green addressed his letter dated 30th April 18G0 to the Khan during your own incumbency at Jacobabad as Political Su perintendent, and if so, the whole records scarce ly show more complete interference than that letter does. I never spoke to the Khan in such terms as the following—' A British Officer is not ' placed in my position merely for the purpose &lt;£ of protecting you against injury from your ' own subjects caused by your own mis-govern- *' ment. The friendship of one individual is of ' little service to the British Government, but ' that of a contented and well governed country ' is of the utmost service.' Sir Bartle Frere and Lord Elphinstone also both wrote about the Khan as a ' worthless character,' and really in the face of all this evidence now before us, very little can be said in his favor, and therefore the greater the necessity of managing him with great care. 55. My sole object in all that I have done has been to force the Khelat Government to report everything fully, and bring it to the test of the light. There never can be real improve ment and progress in a country, so long as acts of oppression, injustice, or discontent remain concealed. 56. Another point that I determined to op pose directly I found it out—first in the case of the Sirdars on their march to Khelat; then Political Superintend- with regard to my last year's ent's report No. 1838, . • i ., r dated 29th December arrangements with the Mur- rees and Boogtees, and fi nally in many instances brought forward in this correspondence, is, as General Jacob has( 27 ) has taken upon himself to so freely bestow. 57. This is also a most improper paragraph. Having consideration for Colonel Phayre's long standing in the service, and being well acquaint ed with his zeal, energy, and ability, I con sidered it was just to him, and well deserving the trial, to endeavour to explain to the fullest, all matters relating to Khelat in which I had so many years' experience, with the view of causing him to take them in their true lisrht. O o But my object has been grievously misunder stood, and my efforts, I regret exceedingly to find, wasted. I gave Colonel Phayre my full support, until he showed an intention of dia- re^ardino: what I intimated to him was the o o course I desired to be followed. I also freely offered to him every assistance I could give. 58. I have undoubtedly approved of Captain Harrison's conduct. It has been all that could be desired, and merits very different considera tion from what it has received at Colonel Phayre's hands. If, in his adverse ' action to what he knew to be the orders of Government/' Colonel Phayre refers to the Khan s proposals and Captain Harrison's recommendations in regard to the Kumal Khan village case, he has strongly forgotten what passed. The corres pondence shows I did not approve of what was recommended. The latter part of this para, contains a most improper insinuation, which Colonel Phayre should have been careful to avoid. I have written constantly privately or demi-officially to Captain Harrison, to encou rage him in the important position he holds, but no official instructions have of course ever been given to him, that have not been communicated through Colonel Phayre, with one exception, and that was, when Colonel Phayre was in Bombay. expressed it,' the habit of secretly but persever- ingly thwarting all our measures for the estab- ' lishment of the Khan's authority and good ' Government of his country.' 57. I respectfully submit that, though you have endeavoured to explain away the palpable facts brought forward, you have not contro verted any one of them ; you have thrown doubts on everything but have disproved nothing. You have not only censured everything I have done in this matter, but you have cast a most serious reflection upon my character as a public servant of thirty years' standing, though my whole career for that period, passed in some of the highest appointments in the service, is in itself, independently of the evidence of those facts, a complete refutation of your attack. 58. On the other hand, you have given Captain Harrison your unqualified support in everything, even in his adverse action to what lie knew to be the orders of Government. This of course I cannot in honor submit to, and it leaves me no alternative but to appeal to the Right Honorable the Governor in Council for justice, particularly as it would appear from some re marks of your own and Captain Harrison's in this correspondence that, since April last, you have been in direct communication with him upon official subjects, belonging to my duty as Political Superintendent on this Frontier, with out my knowledge and consent. 59. Colonel Phayre took up the duties of Political Superintendent in August 1868. Tlie statement that after a few months, &amp;c. is not quite correct. Every assistance and support was given to Colonel Phayre by me at • first, 59. I would also submit to the Pight Honorable the Governor in Council that, by Uis Excellency's kindness, I was appointed Political Superintendent on this Frontier in 1868, and that after a few months I found myself in a( 28 ) knowing how much he had to learn. I spent a month nearly with him in the Frontier Districts, in February and March 18G0, so that all ques tions might be freely discussed between us. It was not till May 1869, nine months after his arrival, that it became necessary for me to interpose for the first time, to point out to him that he was adopting a wrong course with re ference to the Sirdars, and to desire he would enter into no further communications with them. Had I not done so, Captain Harrison's position at Khelat would have been made most dangerous, and the very worst possible conse quences must have followed. Had Colonel Phayre been permitted to continue pressing the cause of the Sirdars, after they had shown such unmistakeably rebellious designs, and had re jected the several offers of the Khan, he would have certainly turned the Khan into a bitter enemy of the British Government, and most serious disorders have immediately broken out in Beloocbistan. Beloochistan, united under one rule, is an element of strength to us. But Be loochistan divided into a number of factions, all fighting against each other, as would be the case were the Government of the Khan allowed to be destroyed, would he an ever-menacing danger, demanding the presence of strong bodies of troops all along our Frontier, from Jacobabad to the sea, a distance of 350 miles. There was no interference until Colonel Phayre rendered! it necessary hy the tendency he evinced to fol low a course different to that which had been given for his general guidance. Such inter ference was not exerted before certainly, but then no Political Superintendent had ever before rendered it necessary. The passage ' introduc tion of fresh blood on this Frontier, so far from having been attended by iU-effects to- &lt;c Government interests generally, has been highr ' ly beneficial to them,' is, I would submit, quite beyond the bounds of good taste and official propriety. It reflects most unbecomingly on Colonel Phayre's predecessors^ It is hardly in accord with his statement that he has strictly followed the policy of General Jacob and Sir Henry Green. very difficult position, owing to my appointment having been previously held by yourself; and your requiring, as appears from this correspond ence, that I should either adopt your views of everything, against my own judgment, based on the records of my office, or incur the treat ment I have now received at your hands. I submit, moreover, that I have been subjected to an interference with the executive details of my duty as Political Superintendent which no Commissioner in Sind has ever ^et exercised, as may be seen from my office records passim. It is this, I deferentially submit (not the policy which I advocate, for that is the same as General Jacob's and Sir Henry Green's) which has led to the Khan's and Captain Harrison's virtual contempt of my authority. I am fully prepared to show by actual facts, should His Excellency be pleased to order the investiga tion referred to in my paras. 53 and 54, above, that His Excellency's introduction of fresh blood on this Frontier, so far from having been attended by iil effects to Government interests generally, has been highly beneficial to them, although in the 14th para, of your letter No. 519, dated 20th ultimo, you would make the contrary appear to be the case. CO. I forgot, until now, to notice the view you take of the Boogtee Chiefs son's conduct at(Ha ( 61. Colonel Phayre fails entirely to under stand the important bearing of this question, or to appreciate my remarks. 11 is own report states ' a day or two ago in Durbar, when dis- ' cussing a matter affecting a Chief of the ' Eoogtee tribe, in which the latter, according ' to the custom of a century, deprecated the ' Khan's interference with the internal econo- tc my and management of his tribe, and soli cited to address a petition to His Highness ' on the subject.' The impertinence of the Belooch was daring to question the right of the Khan, his Sovereign, before Colonel Phayre, and asking the latter's permission to address his own Khan. This was most disrespectful to the Khan, and ought to have met with immediate rebuke. Its not being so, would be regarded by the Belooch, as marking that his view of the case was the correct one, and that he could put the British Officer before the Khan, which I hold lie did, when he asked permission of the former to address the latter. This is what was regarded as ignoring the Khan, and it is not explained to have been otherwise. !9 ) my Durbar in your letter No. 522, dated 23rd ultimo, and the strong censure you pass upon me in connection therewith. 61. In reply to this, I beg to state that neither did the man make an impertinent re quest, nor did he ignore the Khan as his Sove reign, for it was as his Sovereign that he ad dressed him. G2. This is an instance of the very unsatis factory, and I may say reckless, way in which Colonel 1 hay re quotes particular sentences from records, when he finds they suit particular points he is desirous of urging, without stating whe ther such sentences are correct data to go upon, or whether they are not modified, if not entirely altered by others that follow. This quotation is taken from a very valuable sketch of States and Six dais connected with the Frontier of Upper Sind, drawn up by General Jacob in September 1854, and is to be found in the printed records of the Sind Horse, 2nd volume, page 195. In the opening part, it is generally Stated that putting aside the Bhawulpoor State, « the others (meaning tribes) may be naturally arranged c ' under three heads. ec ' 1st.—The tribes residing beyond British teiiitoi\, and dc Jcicto independent of any ' other State. G2. You are aware that General Jacob classifies the Barokzyes of Seebee, and the Murree and Boogtee clans, with certain others on the Punjab border, as ' independent tribes ' residing beyond British territory, and de ' facto independent of any other State.'( 30 ) ' 2h(i;^Tlic State of Khelatj with tlie indU ' vidual bender tribes, its subjects. ' 3rd.—The Border tribes, British subjects, ' living within the British Prontier. ' Independent Tribes—Under the first head ' are comprised the Khetranees, the Lusharees, ' the Gorechanees, the Kujjueks, and Baroozies ' of Seebee, and the predatory hill tribes, the ' Boofrtees and the Murrees.' Tlie above by itself would make it appear that General Jacob considered the Murress and Boog- tees were independent, and Colonel Phayre, ta king only this quotation, asserts so. But it is only a general statement at the commencement of a subject. But if the paper is gone further into, there would be found ample information how General Jacob really estimated the relative posi tions of the Khan and the Murrees. It is the more strange that Colonel Phayre should show ignorance on this point, as in the document he so constantly alludes to, the memorandum show ing what General Jacob endeavoured to impress on the mind of the Khan when offering the Treaty, General Jacob's ideas as to the Sove reignty of the Khan over the Murrees, are very clearly given in the following paragraph—' For ' the Wuzzeer (Mahomed Hussein) no longer t£ even pretended to restrain evil-doers, but ' encouraged the rebellious subjects of your ' Highness, the Murrees, in their outrages, &amp;c. ' fcc.,' Colonel Phayre also should not have forgotten that the annual subsidy paid to tlio Khan under Article V of the Treaty, under which he binds himself to prevent all plunder ing or other outrage by his subjects, was with held once, because the Murrees and Boogtees committed a serious raid on the Punjaub Fron tier. The fact of these hill tribes being.sub- • o jects of the Khan, has been so often repeated, that I never supposed it was doubted, and cer tainly was under the impression that Colonel Phayre held them to be so too. In very recent correspondence, however, there has been a de sire on his part to make it appear otherwise, and he quotes the fragment to support this{ 31 ) G3. The opening and whole tone of this paragraph is, I submit, most objectionable. I would however desire to leave it to higher authority to dispose of without any further remark from me. Colonel, Commissioner in Sind. 63, This Is a complete answer to your letter under reference, and though you know this, yet you do not hesitate to attack me on this point also. General Jacob is the highest authority we can quote on these matters, and this conveys his view of the relation of these tribes to Khelat, to whom they owe a nominal allegiance only, but they gladly recognise the Khan as their Sovereign; yet they claim, and always have done, to rule their own clans in all matters of internal economy. Whether I keep these and the other Belooch tribes in order, and allow them to be disrespectful or otherwise, will abundantly appear when the investigation above referred to takes place, i have, &amp;c., E.
