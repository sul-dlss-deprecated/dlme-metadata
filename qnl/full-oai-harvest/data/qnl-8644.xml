The memorandum chiefly concerns the material demands being made upon Iran during the occupation, and requests that the Iranian Government be given more input into arrangements made between its British and Soviet counterparts, with, or in regard to the establishment of a ‘Persian Corridor’ for the transport of war materials from Iran’s ports on the Gulf to the Soviet Union. A copy (in English) of the memorandum and its enclosures is included in the file (ff 40-82). A copy of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Robert Anthony Eden’s response to Hagir’s memorandum is also included in the file (ff 14-25). Other correspondents in the file include: the British Minister in Tehran, Reader William Bullard; and the Foreign Office.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="personal"><namePart>ʿAbd-al-Ḥosayn Hažir</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Anglo-Soviet occupation of Iran (1941-1946)</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Diplomacy</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000063#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000063#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
