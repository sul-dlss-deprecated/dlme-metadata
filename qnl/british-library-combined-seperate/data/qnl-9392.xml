Sulphur was used in the production of sulphuric acid, which was an essential component of almost all explosives. It was therefore considered to be an essential wartime commodity, and the British Government was keen that resources of sulphur should be available within the British Empire. Commercial and political agreements were concluded in 1940, but exploration by the company in Kuwait in 1945 discovered no indication of the presence of sulphur in workable quantities.The papers include: India Office papers concerning the interest of the Kuwait Oil Company in obtaining a concession to exploit sulphur deposits in Kuwait, 1940; negotiations over an agreement, led by R O Rhoades; comments by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the British Government's desire for a pre-emption clause in the agreement in case of national emergency; draft and signed copies of the agreements between the Shaikh of Kuwait and the Eastern Gulf Oil Company Limited (signed on 5 June 1940, folios 80-102), and the political agreement between HM Government and the Eastern Gulf Oil Company Limited (signed on 23 October 1940, folios 41-42); correspondence concerning explorations by the company, 1940-45; and the discontinuance of operations in 1945, following which the company's personnel and equipment were handed over to the Kuwait Oil Company.The Arabic content of the papers consists of the Arabic text (with English translation) of the signed agreement dated 5 June 1940.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Eastern Gulf Oil Company Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Kuwait Oil Company</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Kuwait</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Sulphur</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001f0#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001f0#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001f0#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001f0#share">Copyright or data protection restrictions</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
