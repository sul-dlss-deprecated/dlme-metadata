Iclo ^v. 30th May, 1940. Dear Gibson, You. will remember that it has been agreed that the archives of the former Bagdad Residency, which were sent to India in 1917, shall remain there for the present. Our Embassy at Bagdad are now anxious to make some arrangement lor the disposal of the High Commission archives, since if an emergency arose the staff would not have time to destroy them all. These archives, which are unbound and occupy sixty yards of shelf space, should be sent to the United Kingdom for permanent presei’vation, but this is impossible under present conditions, and the best solution seems to be that suggested by the Embassy, i.e., to send them to India for the duration of the war. In the circumstances I hope the India Office will be prepared to consult the Government of India by telegraph, asxing them (if they agree to accept the arcnives) to notify the Embassy direct so that uetailed arrangements may be made as soon as possible. I shall be grateful if you can arrange for the desired action to be taken soon. Yours sincerely. J.P. Gibson, Esq..(L 539/72/402) t — ft- L FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. 16th February, 1940.

From paragraph 2 of that letter it will be seen that His Majesty’s Government have agreed to bear the cost of the examination of the records by a member of the Imperial Record Department, viz. pay at the rate of Rs.150 per mensem for approximately one year plus leave and pension contributions.

This will greatly facilitate both our work here and the reception of the volumes at the Public Record Office. ^ We should make it clear that v/hile we desire that the whole of these archives should be examined, documents of ephemeral interest may be eliminated only from the Consular archives. We have no authority at present for the destruction of any of the archives of other than Consular posts, and the weeding of the archives of these is governed by the provisions of the schedule of destruction, of which I enclose a few copies for the use of the person who will undertake this task. We do not of course knov/ precisely the nature of these records*5 arranged, I have no doubt that the person concerned will /S have no great difficulty in discriminating between Consular and other papers. Since it will doubtless be necessary for a considerable proportion of the archives to be bound in this department, we assume that whoever is selected to do the work of examination will take care that the papers are put together in a form suitable for binding without the need for further re-arrangement here and that each bundle will be appropriately labelled with a description of the contents which may be stamped on the back of the volume when bound. 7 Finally may I ask that a detailed list of the volumes in each consignment may be supplied to us as each consignment is forwarded?

There are approximately 150 bundles and 450 bound registers. Of the bundles ; about 25, containing on an average 800 documents each, will require detailed examination» The remaining bundles contain more or less separate collections on particular subjects which are indi cated an the cover, and will take less time to examine. It is estimated that the entire work of weeding can be done in one year. It is, however, not possible for the Imperial Record Department to attend to this work in addition to their normal duties; but they are willing to allow a competent member of their staff RECo.

In addition to the pay His Majesty’s Government will also have to bear leave and pension contributions. 2. As regards the second proposal contained in the Foreign Office letter No. L. 4962/453/402, dated the 20th July 1938, I am to add that there would be no difficulty in sending home the archives in small consignments. 3.

In his reply just received, Jenkinson says that in the Record Office’s view, though there is an arguable case for leaving the documents in India, there is a much stronger one for treating them as Foreign Office archives, and that we should accordingly proceed as suggested in the pftnnT tim a_te paragraph o f my letter to him. i/ J.P.

I should also he glad to have your views generally on this matter and in particular on the question whether the archives could he sent home eventually in small consignments.

One argument in support of the view that these archives should remain under the control of the Government of Inals is the fact that the post at iagaad was under their jurisdiction during the period in question, and that at one stage it was supervised by the set indie Company. /On lOn the other hana eguad has been a consular post since 1793» the officer in coarse preexunabl^ combining the post of olitioal ^esiaejit ana Consul-General, so th- t although certain essential consular records were returned to S^gaad soon after the war It muat be assumed nevertheless that much of the correspondence that remains woula be of direct concern to the Foreign Office* If, however, it were decided that we must maintain our claiit to these archives the question of ‘’weeding' and blnulng would present a serious problem, since we assume that nothing has been ,one in that direction. We could haraly expect the mbaasy staff to undertake the examination of this vast amount of material (about four tens in weight), nor could we ^eal with it at the Foreign Office, la that case the only remaining possibility would seem to be to ask the Keeord Department at Calcutta whether they would be willing to weed the strictly consular portion of the archives in accoraance with our stanuing Instructions to Consuls /and— 1 ——— — and then aenu aatchea for binalng and eventual tranaala Ion to ym.

Documents of Historical Interest among Consular Archives. Sir, I AM directed by Mr. Secretary Henderson to state that it has been brought to his notice that at certain Consular posts of long standing there are documents of historical interest among the Consular archives. His Majesty’s Consul-General at Tunis, for instance, recently reported the existence in his records of autograph letters of King Charles II, Mr. Secretary Pepys, and Admiral Lord Nelson. 2. Mr. Henderson does not necessarily wish to direct that such documents as these should he sent home, unless there is any doubt as to the security of their custody; but the existence of any such documents, and even of others of considerably less historical interest than those instanced above, should be known to historical students, and the information will be most readily available at the Public Record Office. 3. I am therefore to instruct you to examine the archives in your charge and to send home a list of any material among them which might he considered of historical or antiquarian interest, for trans mission to the Deputy Keeper of the Public Records.

The first transfer of records took place after the British occupation of Baghdad in 1917.It is agreed between government officials that the work of examining, selecting and cataloguing the records would be done at the Government of India Imperial Record Department, Calcutta, and paid for by the Foreign Office. It is also agreed that at the end of the Second World War (1939-1945), the selected records would be transferred to England for permanent preservation at the Public Record Office (later the National Archives of the United Kingdom). There are two enclosures of an earlier date than the main correspondence. These are a telegram from the Political Resident in Turkish Arabia to the Government of India in 1918, and two copies of Foreign Office instructions issued in 1920 about the criteria for the preservation or destruction of British Consular records, in accordance with the Public Record Office Act, 1877.The principal correspondents are: Stephen Gaselee, Librarian, Foreign Office; John P Gibson, Head of Political Department, India Office; and M Smith, Secretary, Government of India, Foreign and Political Department.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office, Librarian</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign and Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Baghdad</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Government archives</topic></subject><subject><topic>Consular services</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x0002d3#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
