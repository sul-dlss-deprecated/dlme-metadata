The first is a request to the Colonial Office from a firm of leather merchants for permission for two Arab skin selectors, nominally Turkish subjects, to proceed from Aden to Nigeria.

The second issue concerns the loss of a passport by one of six skin selectors, who also went from Aden to Nigeria, and who had been employed by a Mr G Schaerer of Messrs Max Klein of Aden. Minutes show that the former was a Swiss citizen, that the firm was American, and that the Political Resident, Aden was satisfied with the legitimacy of both.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Leather industry</topic></subject><subject><topic>Passports</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100037366739.0x000002#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
