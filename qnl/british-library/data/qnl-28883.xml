In a letter of the 13th March, we wel comed this idea, but suggested that the whole question of our future relations with the Sheikh of Koweit might be considered at a meeting of the Middle Hast Official Sub -Committee. The correspondence was forwarded by the India Office to the Political Resident and the Government of India, and Powle replied, on the 4th April, that he would submit his views on the matter in due course. I understand that Ward, of my Department, has dis cussed the question with you once or twice, and that you/ M.J. Clauson, Esq.you undertook to ascertain Fowle ! s views before he- Returned to the Gulf and to let us hear further on the subject in due course. I do not know whether it will really be practicable to proceed much further with this question in Ifite present circumstances. Although ^agreed some time ago that our policy as regards the Sheikh of Koweit should be one of tillering up out* control wherever possible, the meeting of the Middle East Official Sub-Committee on the 24th September shewed that there was still a good deal of difference of opinion as to the general direction which our policyskould follow on the Arab side of the Persian Gulf. It may be, therefore, that leave this rather difficult question over for the present. On the other hand I understand that Fowle is leaving for the Gulf in a few days and we may thus find that we have missed a good oportunity of consulting him on a question which may possibly become acute again sooner than we think. You may therefore like to take the oportunity of discussing the question with him v/hile he is still here, and I need hardly say that if you would both like to talk^^71-l-Ya^L juX . it over with me here, I am completely at your disposal* Yours sincerely,D.E CYPHER D F T ELEG R A M, (COPIES CIRCULATED) Prom The Political Resident in the Persiaa Gulf to Secretary of State for India 0 Dated Risher, 85th September, 1936 0 Received £ 0 15 p 0 mo, 85th September, 1$35 X * Addressed tc Secretary of State for India, copy sent by sea mail to Government of India and Koweito Your printed letter P 0 Z 0 7, January 84th e Sheikh of Koweit has handed us copy of letter dated July 24th (which has followed him about) from Trader, Limited, that it is not their intention to accept Sheikh*s decision to grant concession to Koweit Oil Companyo Matter in hands of Trader ? s Legal Advisers 0 is shortly expected ir.

It will he reraemhered that the Resident was instructed ( P.Z.1725/35); (a) to address a rehuke to the Sheikh on the subject of his clandestine dealings with Traders Ltd. last year; and (b) to attempt to obtain from the Sheikh a clearer undertaking regarding the grant of oil (and possibly other) concessions. The Resident has now sent us, with his Express Letter of the 3rd May below, copies of two letters which he addressed to the Sheikh on 11th April last, together with two letters from the Sheikh in reply, dated 21st April. No/ 3330 1000 12.34No comment is (in reply t0 required on the Sheikh’s first letter the rebuke) which, in all the circunstances, may be regarded as fairly satisfactory. On the question of the grant of concessions, it will be seen that the Resident decided to ask the Sheikh m the first instance for an assurance to cover the grant of all +*«+ the Sheikh 'should undertake not concessions, viz. that the oneit to grant concessions of any kind, or to enter into discussions with any party in regard to any concession ^t^vcr. save with the prior approval of His Majesty’s Government'. The Sheikh, in his letter, refuses to give this omnibus assurance, on the grounds that he 'does not think that it is H.M.G.’s intention or desire to restrain or prevent him from enjoying any advantage or benefits that may be derived from my country and lands' from the grant of concessions of various kinds which he specifies in the letter On the other hand, the Sheikh gives the necessary assurance in regard to Oil in the neutral zone, and in view of the fact that he has already granted an Oil concession to the Kuwait Oil Company in respect of Koweit territory proper, the position is quite satisfactory for the time being, since the question of the grant of other concessions is not a matter of any urgency at present* Colonel Powle proposes that he should he authorised to address a further letter to the Sheikh about the grant of concessions, hut since the Sheikh is now on his way to this country, where he proposes to spend several weeks, action on this question will have to he deferred* The Resident himself is coining home on leave at the end of July and the question of any further action being taken can he considered in consultation with him while he is here.

The Sheikh has given us the assurance in respect of oil- As regards the omnibus assurance, v/e have had recently to take so stiff a line with the Sheikh on various matters that there is no harm in leaving this one over for the moment. We have no treaty rights in the matter, and the question of such an assurance can conveniently be considered in connection with that of approaching the Sheikh in regard to a consolidating treaty, which is a matter on which Col. Fowle has promised his views later. These questions can be discussed with Col. Fowle during -r-rcR his deputation to this country. ICaL COWiMlT T E- fci j i' If JUL 1935&gt;/99 Confidential.

Finally that if he expects His Majesty’s Government to help him generally when he stands in need of assistance, they wish to make it clear to him that the least they expect on his part is that he should, keep them fully informed on all matters of importance. sd.

My esteemed friend, With reference to your letter No. R/4/1864 of 16th December 1934 to Colonel Dickson regarding the negotiations entered into by you with Messrs .Traders Limited. I have communicated to His Majesty’s Government Your Excellency’s letter explaining the circumstances in which you did not inform them earlier of your negotiations with Messrs. Traders Limited. In view of the clear intima tion of their wishes communicated to Your Excellency by Colonel Dickson on 23rd inpril last to the effect that His Majesty’s Govern ment would expect Your Excellency to consult them before you even opened any negotiations witfci any Company, His Majesty’s Government feel that Your Excellency could have communica ted the mere fact of these negotiations either to Major Watts, whose knowledge of Arabic is sufficient to understand such a communication, or to the Acting Political Resident, Colonel Loch (who speaks Arabic) when he was at Kuwait from the 21st to the 29th September 1934. They note also that Your Excellency did not inform /- 2 - inform Colonel Dickson 'till about the middle of November, though he had returned to Kuwait on the 16th October* Further they note that when Your Excellency did inform Colonel Dickson you did not divulga the name of the Company nor the fact that you had written to them as far back as September 2nd, stating that subject to their securing the approval of His Majesty's Government and their acceptance of certain of your conditions, you v/ere ready to accept their terms, and were prepared to sign their concession. In these circumstances His Majesty's Government have instructed me to inform Your Excellency that they take a serious view of your disregard of their wishes in this matter having regard both to your treaty obligations and to the pains which, as you are aware, His Majesty's Government have through out these long and troublesome negotiations taken to safeguard Your Excellency's interests in this matter. On their instructions I am addressing Your Excellency separately as to the steps to be taken to avoid any similar misunderstandings in the future. I desire to express the high consideration &lt;rwhich I entertain for Your Excellency and to subscribe myself Your Excellency's sincere friend, sd.

The misunderstanding which occurred in the case of Traders Limited (one unfortunate result of which has been to involve Your Excellency in the displeasure of His Majesty's Government) has emphasised the importance oi a clearer understanding- as to the position in regard to concessions in Your Excellency's territory. His Majesty's Government consider that in order that the position should he expressed in a clear and unambiguous form it is most desirable that Your Excellency should Undertake not tenant concessions of any kma nor to enter into d iscussion with any party in regard to any concession whatsoever save with the prior approval of His Majesty s Govemt, &lt;*io Would Kopt f»lW i»r«r«d confidentially of all details in regard to any /-§~ any such negotiations, and I am to request that Your Excellency will give an assurance accordingly.

The present moment is not a very good one for taking a stiff line with the Sheikh about Traders, since we are proposing to take rather a stiff line with him about the Koweit-Iraq smuggling, and it would be better to leave the Resident discretion to rrake the communication proposed in regard to Traders any time up to about the 7th April, which will give him a week after his return from India. 3. The communication suggested in paras.6 ana 7 of our ietter of 19th February to the Foreign Office will presumably be made in writing.

C.B.E A.» 71, Queen Street, Your Reference London, E GA Our Reference i^fif 24th January, 1935 Dear Laithwaite As promised some time ago, I send you herewith 12 copies of the Kuwait Concession. More copies are available if you should want them. We understand from the negotiators that two maps were used in connection with the Concession. The large scale map bearing names in English and Arabic was placed loosely in c signed copies of the Concession. The small scale map was pasted on to the last sheet of f of the signed copies. Neither map, however, was initialled by the signatories. If it is necessary for you to have copies of these maps to accompany each of your 12 copies of the Concession, I will supply them. In the meantime, however, I am sending you three photostat copies of the large scale map and three photostat copies of a tracing of the small scale map. In the original of the latter the printing of names was rather indistinct and for the purpose of photostatting, all lettering was redone. The important features - boundaries, etc. - are identical with the copies attached to the original Concession. Yours sincerely J. G. Laithwaite, Esq., C.I.E., India Office, S.

D.O.No.C-377. The 28th December 1934. My dear Fowle, am glad to say the Oil negotiations are through at last, for they have caused me no little worry and anxiety especially the lust stages* 2* As you will have seen from ray telegram and other correspondence on the subject, the Shaiich signed the Concession in the Drawing Room of the Agency at 11 A.M. on Sunday the 23rd December and Holmes and Ohisholra followed suit. I acted the part of official witness etc. 3. There is no doubt in my mind that the Kuwait Oil Company had a very narrow escape, and that the iuaerican side of the Company (Gulf) were very nearly the victims of what I believe to have been a barefaced attempt to 'double cross' them, on the pert of their allies and friends, the British side (A*?«0*C.Ltd«}• 4. If you will refer to my Secret D.O.C-297, dated 17th November and rayftelegram No.338 of 13th December, you will see that in November I was well on the track of the hostile Oil concern, which was operating from Basra (and which later turned out to be Traders Ltd.) and every fresh piece of evidence that I have since been able to get hold of has tended to confirm my suspicion^ that the A*P*0.C. were the hidden hand behind 'Traders'. b. of course the A.F.O.C. have coveryd their tracks well, and one will never, I suppose, be able to prove anything against them, which I ouppose in any case would be undesirable. That very strong suspicion attaches to them, however, will be seen from the enclosed 'Note r , which I send you, the contents of which I have gone to great pains to The Hon’ble Lt.-Colonel T.C.Fowle, C*B.S., Political Resident in the Persian '-ulf, BUG HIRE.pains to get hold of both from ^iasra, Baghdad and London, 6. The haikh of oourse has been to blame from our point of view for his stupid axoesa of seorecy, but from his own point of view (and don’t forget he is a Nejdi; he has played a supremely clever gane f and has forced the Kuwait Oil Company in the end to grant him all he wanted. 7. I take a little credit to myself for having 'saved the Shaikhs bacon' to some extant with His Majesty's Government, by getting through to you on 17th November my Secret D.0ajo.C-297 f which X trust not only put His Majesty's Government on their guard against the A.P.O.C., but to a certain extent showed that the Shaikh did m&amp;ke some sort of belated effort to keep me Informed of what was going on ? though not until I had got most of the facts myself. 8. After the Concession was signed, I tackled Holmes judiciously about Traders Lwd*, and found out enoug^i to satisfy me that he had been suspicious as far back as Jay 1954 that something seriously wrong with the internal affairs of the Kuwait Oil Company, especially when he received a wire from London tolling him and Chisholm to get hold of K.B.Mir a ^ohamed of Basra, and entrust him with all their Wa Arabic translation work. Holmes who says he refused to act as ordered did not apparently begin to find out about the full nature of the n olot' until he and Cnisholoi returned trm London enrly in October last, vrora that date, however, although he did not say this to me, I feel sure he got *ell on to the track of Traders and kept his American principals in London fully informed of every move. 9. Chisholm, X am confident now, knew all about Traders Ltd. as far back as May 1954, also, and though I my this with the utmost reserve, X feel sure he was im.de to act the part of liaison officer between some one high up in the A.P.O.C. in London, and Krank -trick &amp; Co., of Basra,- 3 - of Besre, inoludix^; Mir e Mohamed and Gabriel, In part proof of this, I may mention tb&amp;t since his retuxn from London in October he has made some 6 trips to iiasra and on each occasion visited Frank Stride's offices, and those of Miiv.a ?4ohamed and Gabriel. 10* I will go further and say that on the night of June 17th 1934 t and actually when my wife and I broke our Journey in Baghdad whilst en route to the United Kingdom, Chisholm secretly it seems met the following persons (Maude Hotel) also in Baghdad:- (a) K.B.Mir a Mohamad, (b) Mr. Gabriel, (o) Hajji Abdulla Williamson, (d) The local / .P.O.C. Agent In Kuwait (an ^rab). (o) Shaikh Salim el Hamad el Subnh, cousin of the Shaikh of Kuwait and a very pro —.P.O.C. personage. At this meeting Chisholm, I have reason to believe, propunded the forthcoming campaign of Traders Ltd., and discussed plans and methods of procedure. 11. It is a curious fact that ever since my arrival back from England (16th October) Chisholm from being the very onen and delightful friend of the family that he used to be, all of a sudden adopted a close and decidedly aloof attitude. I now put this down to the fact that he had received 'his orders' in London, and not only ’’disliked' playing &amp; dual role, but definitely felt he was playing a 'dirty' game, and was ashamed of himself. He certainly was continually at loggerheads during this period with Holmes, and whatever progress Holmes scenicjd to make in the negotiations he, Chi&amp;holm, appeared to want to spoil. 12. actually when the Oil Concession was finally signed (on ?3rd Deo ember} Chisholm showed a curious lack of enthusiasm, in my house, Just as if he were a 'beaten' man. Holmes on the contrary acted the part of 'conquering hero'. According to Holmes - though I say this with reserve - ChisholmChlffcolra volunteered the Information to him (after they had gone home from signing) that he had all along been aware of Traders activities in Basra but had not liked to say so to Holmes,lest he get 'worried' about it. He also passed the oryptio remark that 'some people in this world had to do lota of things by order which greatly went against the grain of a decent minded person'. From this you will gather that i iKht up to 23rd December neither mentioned a word to the other about the existence of fr^dors^presumably because xor his part ^olznes believed Chisholm to be acting the traitor and Chisholm because he felt guilty. 15* I give the above facts at length in order to show you what has been going on out here, and the unpleasant atmosphere that has surrounded and hampered the last stages of the Oil negotiations* 14* Can it be wondered, I ask, that the Shaikh who (as he told me a few days before he signed the Concession) believed that he saw in Traders Ltd., the hand of the JWP.O.C., decided to go all out and play with them to suit his own hand* You remember that I reported this to you when you were last here (22nd December/. 15. The last stages of the Oil negotiations were I now know marked by an intensive propaganda from Traders Ltd* araong~~the leading people of Kuwait, and it is fully admitted n^yv* that Gabriel distributed large suns of money in the Town, on behalf of Traders Ltd*, ao that pressure should be brought on the Shaikh, to decide the right way* Gabriel employed sub-agents to pay out the money, one of whom was the i *P*0*C* local i^gent himself, I understand* It is even said - though I can hardly believe this - that in two oases certain individuals received Rs*5000/- apiece, and two others Rs. I JjOQO, Certain it is now that Gabriel end his backers were confident of success right up to the end, especially after Traders in London had made contact with His majesty’s Government. 16* In conclusion, £ enclose, ^ith my attached note,note, a catting which appeared In the Iraq TIMES of December 18th 1934 and which curiously supports what I have said about the * #PoC • The relative portion reads as follows;- 'Lord Greenway, President of the &gt;»♦?♦(),C.Ltd .. died w at Hamsey,Hamp8hire, yesterday at the age of 77. r M Lod Greenway was one of the founders of the Company, 'and was also senior partner in Shaw, Wallace. &amp; Co. , ’’who have large business connections in Iraq, India 'and Ceylon'. 17.

Those emendations (apart from some minor verbal alterations) are as set out in his enclosed letter; and also in article 6(A) His Sbroellency rQqulre4s the following wording: ‘’The Company shall maintain/the region of the Persian Gulf a Chief Local Representative to represent it in matters relating to this agreement with the Nhaikh. The shaikh has the right to select in the first instance the Chief Local Representative In consultation with Hie Majesty’s Government'. ith reference to the second paragraph of the Shaikh’s enclosed letter, the gist of his new sub-clause 9(B) is that he reserves the right to permit companies operating oil fields in neighbouring territories to trans port oil through Kuwait. ^,ith reference to the third and fourth paragraph of the i hellch'a enclosed letter, these refer to the fact that although we have agreed the halkh's fir;6r,cie.i demands Including royalty, we have not yet agreed exactly the be ls on which royalty is payable. Yith the above explanation we n*y sumi-arise the position as follows. The financial terms have been settled apart from the exact royalty basis, which we hope will shortly be agreed. The shaikh's emendations to the general terms (including his two new clauses regarding- 2 - regarding traneport of oil and accounts check) are now under consideration but should present no difficulty. ■r-.s regards the ohaikh's proposed wording for article 6(A), we are Infomlng our Directors of our opinion that that wording Is acceptable, In view of the facts ( 8 ) (b) that the shaikh no longer requires to appoint the vhief Local -fepresen tative« that the Shaikh has, as we understand tram vou undertaken to conform with Hie Majesty's y ’ requirements in this matter. that this article is in any event governed by article 4 of the agreement between ^is Majesty’s Government and the Kuwait Oil Company of 5th Kerch 19d4, which we understand has been formally accepted as binding by the Shaikh. e have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servants, Sd.Frank Holmes, Sd.A.Chisholm.

And you have informed us at our lact interview with you that your Company has decided to accept financial terms as shown in our suggestion (A) and therefore the Com pany has decided to work the oil basis on a foundation of royalty of won-and-saved.

In accordance with discussions with you, we forego our right as shown above, but on condition that we appoint a representative in London in lieu of our foregoing this.

'If any dispute arises as to the aceur? cy of the Company’s accounts in connection with the amount of royalty and/or other payments clue for payment to us under this agreement we shall have the ri/rht to appoint (after consulting R.M.G.) a recognised firm of accountrnts to check the Company’s registers on our behalf either in Kuwait or inLondon as is found necessary, and we shall pay to this firm of accountants all the expenses they happen to incur for this business end the Company shall have to allow the recognised firm of accountants appointed by us all that is necessary to facilitate the work of checking the Company’s books and registers and to afford them all facilities to obtain a final check of what is due to us.

The Resident (Bushire despatch No.C.325 of 3. 21st December, 1934, at P.Z.43/35, flagged) does not regard the sheikh’s explanation of his dealings with j Traders Limited and his failure to keep H.L.G. informed of what was going on as satisfactory and reconmenas ♦ that he should be authorised to address a letter + ^ 2 G H e not attach importance to the apparent breach by the Sheikh of his undertaking to trie Kuwait Oil Company to negotiate with no other party for a period of three months from 14th June, 1934.

It is, however, for consideration whether any further steps should he taken, in the light of the Sheikh's conduct, either to bring home to him the displeasure of H.Ii.u. or to remedy the defects in the terms of our engagement with him which have been revealed by this incident. 5 . it is perhaps difficult to go very far by way of applying sanctions to the sheikh so long as the jestion of the date gardens remains unsettled, out &lt;'1 F*o &lt;Ot4 HA-f x^Caaj [ft sjr . + ^ (r^ &lt;-+vLc+ &amp; kuL± (r ^ Us* k. * l CVW ATU.

There is, of course, no question of | undertaking any additional commitment. 6 . As regards the first of these points, it is still of active importance to tighten up the terms of the sheikh's undertaking to grant no oil concession 'without the approval of H.M.G. While the Kuwait Oil Company have secured a concession in respect of Koweit proper, no concession has yet been granted for the Koweit Neutral zone in which Ibn Saud and American interests are closely interested, and it will be remembered that Hafiz Wahba recently hinted that the2956 6000 7/34 Minute Paper. - 3 - Department. Arabian Development Syndicate W ere endeavouring to secure a letter from Ibn Saud to the sfreikru We might i ina ourselves in an embarrassing position if the Sheikh entered into direct correspondence with ibn Saud on c* Question such as tnis* In these circumstances there seems much to be said for taking steps to tighten up our control over the grant of concessions by the Sheikh and the Foreign Office share this view* we should have the plausible excuse for raising the matter with the sheikh that owing to the looseness of the wording of his existing engagements and the absence of a clear understanding as to what was involved, he had, in his negotiations with Traders Ltd., been so unfortunate as to take action vihich had brought on him the displeasure of and that the object of this clearer definition of his undertakings was to prevent any recurrence of such a misunderstanding. 7. As regards the conclusion of a formal treaty, reference is invited to the correspondence in the Foreign Office print/Tlagged below* H.M.G. have already agreed that there would be advantage in consolidating the various Koweit agreements in a formal treaty and the Resident was instructed in torch 1934 in due course to submit his views on this question. He was, however, given a lead in the direction of deferring disposal of it until further progress had been made with the Koweit Blockade and oil the Koweit and Koweit Neutral Zone/concessions, and no report has so far been received from him. 8 . The arguments for the conclusion of a formal treaty (without, of course, in any way increasing our obligations/obligations towards tne sheikh) have it anytning oeen strengthened by the grant of the Kuwait Oil Concession to a semi-American company which seems likely to take active steps for development if furtner survey reveals good prospects, and there is much to be said for making our position internationally secure oefore the Company begins to operate on a serious scale. It will not be overlooked, too, that the sheikh, once he has x a representative in London and once the company are well established in Koweit, may be inclined to be : slightly less amenable than he would be at present. I think in these circumstances that we might, if the Foreign Office agree, ask the Resident to consider without further delay the practicability of the conclusion of a formal treaty. The main obstacle to action, viz. the undesirability of prejudicing the negotiations of the Kuwait Oil Company, is now disposed of; the Neutral Zone oil concession is not of WMMMtl&amp;OtHuU importance - it is quite probable that there will be a long delay before any decision is taken in regard to it; while there is now some hope (though the attitude adopted by the Sheikh in regard to his claims against Ibn saud may stand in the way) of early discussion with the Saudi Government over the Koweit Blockade. 9.

The Sheikh's present formal obligation is confined to the very unsatisfactory letter of 27 Oct. 1913 on pages 264-5 of Aitchison's Treaties, vol.xi, 1929 edition. .Ve might also proceed to the consideration of the question ^which has already been mooted^of consolidating in one general treaty (without addition to our substantive commitments) the various undertakings (some of them of a very informal character) taken from and given to the Sheikh in the past. We might, with P.0. concurrence, first consult the G. of I. and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf on this question. We are already committed by the pledge of 1914 to the protection of the Koweit Principality and we control her external relations. In view of the increasing political and strategic importance of Koweit it is necessary to maintain this position of external control^ and it may be desirable to J 0yy~4s**sl*4/' consolidate and tighten up the scattered and / informal A Instruments from which we derive this necessary control, without, however, undertaking new responsibilities in regard to the internal affairs of Koweit except as regards oil#/ (fa** c^wo***^ ■ The last para, of the draft is important.

The secretary of state agrees with Colonel Fowle that the two points in respect of which the conduct of the Sheikh is open to criticism are: (a) that in face of the warning conveyed to him by Colonel Dickson on 23rd April 1934, he entered into and conducted negotiations with Traders Ltd. without consulting and (b) that he broke his promise to the Kuwait Oil Co. not to conduct negotiations with any other party for three months as from the 14th June 1934. 3. As regards the second of these — points, the secretary of State is new- on^4ho whale-disposed to that there may have been some genuine &amp; * misunderstanding in the mind of the Sheikh as to the date from which the period/ 3436a 5000 1.35 .NT BY^B/AVU copy i s M ofperiod of 3 months during which he undertook; not to conduct negotiations with any other party was to run* Ihe matter isrom-4.his, one primarily between the She itch and the Kuwait Oil Co. and subject to Sir John GSfs . , . Simon's views agrees with the Resident that it is unnecessary to take it up with H.E* 4* As regards the first point the w Secretary of State dirrects mo to-say teat takes a serious view of the conduct of the sheikh/in entering into negotiation with Traders Ltd. in face of the explicit warning given him on behalf of H.M.G. on 23rd April 1934; and in failing to disclose to H.M.G. or their local representatives until a very late stage the existence or nature of the negotiations in question. The result, as Sir John Simon is aware, has been to produce a situation which might well have placed H.M.G. in a difficult position and vhich may even now have embarrassing reactions for them. 5. subject to the views of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Secretary of state agrees in these circumstances that the Resident should be authorised to write to the Sheikh in the terms of the draft enclosed in his despatch of 21 st December, Nq&lt; 323 . He would, however, suggest io-Wie-wcofta | uf' Uie crqph of buab 1A 'V Draft Paper.

The incident under consideration in this letter has emphasised the extremely loose wording of the specific engagement which precluaes the sheikn from granting any oil concessions in respect of his territory save with tne approval of H-M.G* This latter point is one which is still of «cet-±*Q importance, since, as Sir John Simon is aware, while the oil concession granted to tne Kuwait Oil Co. covers the whole of Koweit proper, no concession has yet been granted in Y . i / u- i respect of the Koweit Neutral Zone. 7/T. The 3/3 would therefore suggest, subject to Sir John Simon's views, that(not only by way of bringing home to the Sheikh the view held by H.M.G of his conduct in the present case, but on general grounds,j the opportunity should be taken to tighten cpntrol 'in respect of oil (and possibly other^ concessions in Koweit, and that the sheikh, simultaneously with the receipt of the letter referred to in para.5 above, should tie requirea tiO entiGr intiQ &amp;n ajiiGiiciQa una6rt»aKiiieo regard t»o t»iie granli of concessions&gt; t»ne effect of w.nicli would be tnat he undertooli to grant no concession and enter into no discussion with any party in regard to a concession save with the prior approval of who should he kept fully informed confidentially of all details in regard to any such negotiations. The line might he taken with the sheikh that the misunderstanding which had occurred in connection with Traders Ltd. (one unfortunate result of which had been to involve the Sheikh in the displeasure of H.M.G.) had emphasised the importance of a clearer understanding as to the position r and that it was in these circumstances that H.M.G. thought it desirable that his undertakings to them in regard to the grant of concessions should be expressed in a clear and unambiguous form, which would prevent a recurrence of the unfortunate confusion which haa arisen in connection with the recent oil negotiations. 8.

Sir John Simon to Sir A. Ryan (Jedda). (No. 10.) * V ' Sir, Foreign Office, January 10, 1935. BY correspondence ending with that enclosed in my despatch No. 6 of the 3rd January you have been kept informed of the general course of events with regard to the negotiation of the Koweit Oil Concession. It may, nevertheless, be convenient if in this despatch I recapitulate briefly the recent history of this question. 2. In February 1934 the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Gulf Oil Corporation of California, who had previously been competing against one another for an oil concession in Koweit, combined to form the joint Koweit Oil Company with a view to prosecuting negotiations for such a concession together. On the 5th March a political agreement was concluded between the Koweit Oil Company and His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom by which the latter were assured of their essential requirements should a concession be granted. The company, for their part, were given to understand that, if they succeeded in negotiating a concession agreement with the sheikh on generally satisfactory lines, the approval of His Majesty’s Government would not be withheld. His Majesty’s Government also examined and approved the draft concession agreement which formed the basis of the negotiations. 3. Negotiations between the Koweit Oil Company and his Excellency the Sheikh, for which permission had been given before the end of February, were begun without delay. Considerable progress was made, but at the beginning of June the negotiations were suspended, at the sheikh’s request, for three months in order that the company’s negotiators might consult with their principals in London. According to the company, the sheikh undertook that during this period of three months he would not receive or consider applications for the concessions from other parties. The company understood this period to end on the 14th September, but the sheikh, as afterwards became apparent, considered himself bound until the 30th August only. 4. The negotiations were, in fact, resumed early in October and made good progress. Agreement had been reached on all but one or two minor points when, on the 19th November, His Majesty’s Government learnt circuitously from a private source that the sheikh had granted the concession, subject to the approval of His Majesty’s Government,” to a new British group named Traders Limited. The principal member of this concern was stated to be Mr. P. LI. Hunting, a director of the British Oil Development Company (now known as Mosul Oil-fields Limited). Although it was understood that that company itself was not involved, various other directors of it were said to be associated with Mr. Hunting. . . 5. Information was immediately sought from the political authonties in the Persian Gulf with a view to establishing the accuracy of this lepoit. The exact position was, however, still unknown when, on the 28th November, His Majesty’s Government, who on the 26th November had been informed that the negotiations between the sheikh and the Koweit Oil Company had now been concluded save for one or two final points, were officially informed by Traders Limited of the agreement which had been reached with the sheikh and were requested to approve it. Traders Limited at the same time communicate to His Majesty’s Government the texts of the draft concession which they stated that they had negotiated with the sheikh, and of a letter which they stated the Sheikh of Koweit had written on the 2nd September to Mr. Gabriel, the sheikh s Basra lawyer, who was acting as their local representative. From this letter, a copv of which is enclosed, you will observe that Traders Limited were asked to seek the approval of His Majesty’s Government for the draft concession which the sheikh (subject to certain minor points) was ready to sign, and were to ask His Majesty’s Government to telegraph their decision to Koweit. [306 k—1]2 a fimnrial terms which this draft concession offered appear to have been morltvouS to thTsheikh than those offered by the Koweit Chi Company, been moie lu ' uu i““, _ , ■ it d were ostensibly an entirely British concern twhereas th!

Meanwhile, the Koweit Oil Company, whSad been pursuing their discussions with the sheikh ,n regard to the minor wno naa oeeii { 5 aDDeared now to have gathered that there was anotner compa ^ informed that an application had, in fact, ..d «h.l if cool,! no, he ijoo^ 0 , Z 17 th December the Koweit Oil Company, in the light of further discussions between their local representatives and the sheikh, informed Hm Majesty s Government that complete agreement between them and the sheikh had been reached On the same date it was learned from the Political Agent at Koweit that the sheikh having heard no more from Traders Limited since he wrote his letter of the 2nd September, had already on his own initiative and before discussing the matter with the Political Agent, warned Mr. Gabriel by telegram on the 12th December that he was about to come to terms with the Koweit Oil Company, and that his Excellency had telegraphed again to Mr. Gabriel on the 15th December stating that, as he had now reached agreement with the Kowei Oil Company further conversations with Traders Limited must cease. The sheikh, moreover, when questioned by the Political Agent denied that his letter of the 2nd September in any way meant the actual grant of a concession as had been stated by Traders Limited, and affirmed Ins readiness to sign the concession which had been negotiated by the Koweit Oil Company. 8 The sheikh having thus of his own free will given an unequivocal decision in favour of the Koweit Oil Company, His Majesty s Government saw no ground for withholding their approval of his decision, of which the company were accordingly informed by letter, more especially as they had already made it plain to the Koweit Oil Company, before any other applicant had entered the field that, if certain conditions which His Majesty’s Government regarded as essential were fulfilled, the consent of His Majesty’s Government to the grant ot the concession would not be withheld. At the same time a letter was addressed to Traders Limited informing them of the decisions which had been reached m the sheikh and by His Majesty’s Government. Copies of these two letters are 9 10 9. It is relevant in this connexion to bear in mind that the sheikh apart from his obligation embodied in the agreement of the 27th October, 1912 (o which he is well aware), not to grant any concession without the pnor consent oi His Majesty’s Government, was reminded as recently as the 23rd April last tna His Majesty’s Government would expect him to consult them before even opening negotiations with any company. This warning, which is in clear conformity wi the spirit and intention of his written engagement, the sheikh, in his dealing with Traders Limited, did not observe. , rrj 8 10. On the 23rd December the sheikh, having been informed tnat n Majesty’s Government had given their approval of his decision, signed Koweit Oil Companv’s concession agreement. I am, &amp;c.

Previous papers :— Please see the previous submission on P.Z.7813/34 flagged and the letters which were issued on that paper to the Kuwait Oil Company and Messrs. Traders Ltd. The reply of Traders Ltd. of 31st December is on P.Z.7/35&gt; flagged. It will be seen that they intimate that they 'cannot accept the rieni^n of the Secretary of State in this matter asflnal. The whole question is now in the hands of my legal advisers and I shall communicate again with you in due course'. Nothing further has been heard from Traders (or from Lord Lloyd). It is to be hoped that on closer investigation of their position they will not wish to press this matter The decision against which they complain is essentially the Sheikh’s and not that of H.M.G. and/ 2730 1000 4.34—I- and we have endeavoured to make this clear in the letters addressed to them and to the Kuwait Oil Company on the 21st December. But an endeavour may, however, be made to urge that H.M.G. ought to have refused to grant them approval to the Sheikh’s decision until there had been an opportunity fully to investigate the proposition put forward by Traders. There is nothing of substance in this but it ,1 + +« Viowp to fieht the battle with them. would be preferable not to have to ngm, 2 . The Sheikh’s explanations and the Resident’s comments thereon are contained in Colonel Fowle's despatch of 21st Jpi December on P.Z.43/35- Submission of this (and of the correspondence with Traders) has been postponed until, m the first place, we could see whether Traders were likely to return to the charge, and, secondly, conseouent on informal discussions which have been proceeding with the Foreign Office nn the orooosals put forward by the Resident. As the Resident says, there are two main points in | issue - first, the Sheikh's breach of his undertaking to the Company; second, his conduct vis-a-vis H.M.G. As regards the | first, it is conceivable that there was a genuine misunderstanding | as to the date on which the Sheikh's undertaking not to negotiate | • i • ^ with any third party expired and we may, I think, agree that it is unnecessary for us, the matter being primarily one between the | Sheikh and the Company (though it is, of course, indirectly of concern to us), to take it up with His Excellency . 4. As regards the second point, we can agree with Colonel Fowle that the Sheikh’s explanation of his conduct is not satisfactory. The question of the line to be taken with him has been informally discussed with the Foreign Office and a separate submission will be made on this subject in due course. At this stage it looks as though the most we can do would be: (a) to approve the despatch of the letter suggested by Colonel Fowle, possibly with some stiffening; (b) to consult the Resident as to the practicability ofr » FOREIGN CFFICE ‘TTX 1 9th January, 1935. % dear Laithwaite, Apart from the minor alterations which you took down over the telephone this morning, the only amendment which Rendel would like to make in our draft despatch to Ryan on the subject of the Kowfiit oil concession is to insert after paragraph 8 the following, the general lines of which we have discussed.

J^L A meeting v/as held at the India Office on 19th December to discuss the applications of the Kuwait Oil Company cUiCi of iraders Ltd. for the Koweit oil concession. Present: Mr. Walton ) Mr. Laithwaite ) Mr. Crombie ) Mr. Starling Mr. Rendel ) Mr. Johnstone ) Mr. Malcolm ) Mr. Seal India Office. Petroleum Department Foreign Office. Commander Dickson) Admiralty. Mr» Walton circulated copies of a confidential report which had been obtained from Sir Henry Strakosch on the subject oi Traders Ltd., briefly recapitulated the history of the case as disclosed in the correspondence which had been circulated to the interested Departments, and explained the reasons for which circulation had not been made until 17th December. Mr. Starling pointed out that in view of the issues raised in this matter which it was considered involved more than a local question, and might already have been raised in Parliament, he was instructed to say that his higher authorities were surprised that the Petroleum Department had not been informed of the intervention of Lord Lloyd at an earlier date. This course had been suggested by Mr. Rendel in his note of the 29th November. He reminded the meeting that the Petroleum Department had not agreed with some of the other Departments at an/ ENCLOSURE IN WEEKLY LETTER~j NO. -3 17 JAN 1936 FROM SECarTARY, POLITICAL AHB SECRET DEPT. INDIA OFFICE2 . an earlier stage in the Koweit Oil negotiations, before the *A.r.O.C. had become associated with American interests, a steo which he felt sure the Company would contend had been forced upon them, as a result of the policy of H.M.G. as the only means of securing for British interests a share in any Koweit oil concession which mi o-h+ ^ , Which might be granted. In February and March, 1933, the Secretary for Mines had written personally to the Secretaries of State for the Colonies and India urging that i't v/a,s a. mi stake to ■fcirppii’ r ^ Americans so favourably, and pressing the claims of the A p o r rpho -d + t The Petroleum Department r s line all along had been to support tho A.P.O.C. They appreciated that British oil interests must in certain directions work in with other big oil interests, but they regarded the A.P.O.C. as entitled to special consideration in the Gulf. The instructions which he had now received from his Minister were to press at this mating that in view of what had happened in the earlier negotiations, it could not now be reasonaoly contended that some other Company, even a hundred Per cent. British concern, had a prior right to the A.F.O.C. The non-official approach which Traders Ltd. had made to the Sheikh was very similar to what had happened in the case of the Eastern and General Syndicate at Bahrein. In that case an pparently British concern obtained the concession only for H.M.G. to discover shortly afterwards that it had assigned its rights to a purely United States Company. He wished to stress thu fact that as long ago as the 5th March last the Kuwait °il Company had.signed an Agreement with H.M.G. covering the safeguards whioh were considered necessary to protect British interests and had been given to understand that if they came to 'terms with the Sheikh on a basis which H.M.G. could approve, as e i- n g in the Sheikh’s interests, their approval would be given the grant of the concession. Mr./f 3. M-r^/alton said that the whole position had been * eXplained in Se ^ ral a day or two before to the Kuwait orl Company who had been unable to understand why, after their long ^*2golinlions and novi +h^+ +&gt; - i -i ana now that tney had reached an agreement with tho Shuilrhi tt T&gt;f p j ’ oould n °t approve it at once. The question was now for decisinn h-t v,,- v, aversion by higher authority and the provisional view of the TnrH n p-f-p- oi the India Office was that H.M.G. should approve the Sheikh's o-rnnt , b ant of a concession to the Kuwait Oil Company. Their reasons were:- (D The Sheikh's wishes: He had apparently changed his mind since September and now proposed to accept the Kuwait Oil Company's concession. This was of much importance. (2) The manner in which Traders Ltd. had handled the question: They had acted wrongly in approaching the Sheikh airecb ana especially in not informing H.M.G. They had lot almost three months elapse before approaching the India Office after receiving the Sheikh's letter of 2nd September. (3) A comparison of the merits of the two applicants: The information furnished by Sir Henry Strakosch, which the Petroleum Department might perhaps be able to supplement, Boomed to show that although Traders Ltd. were financially they did not apparently have that intimate knowledge and experience of exploiting oil concessions which the A.P.O.C. and the Gulf Oil Company were known to have. It did not aoem so P table that Traders Ltd. would work the concession themselves as that the Kuwait Oil Company would do so. It seemed more that they would transfer it to another Company or throw be.ck on the Sheikh after a short attempt to work it. It eccmed better to go to a Company which was willing and able to work the concession if there was any oil there. (4) The Commitments of H.M.G. to the Kuwait Oil Company: H.M.G. were already very closely committed to the Kuwait/Kuwait Oil Company. H.M.G. might have to face criticism whatever action they took- hut if they turned down the Kuwait Oil Company the criticism from the British and American interests behind it would be, to say the least of it, pungent. ilib^l^nchil suggested that it was very important to be as far as possible consistent in these intricate negotiations. '' e had oominitted ourselves by our past policy to acquiescing m allowing the Sheikh himself to grant a concession subject to certain essential conditions being fulfilled. H.M.G. should therefore make it quite clear on this occasion that these conditions having been fulfilled their action was limited to approving the Sheikh's grant of a concession. It seemed important so far as possible to place the responsibility for final decision on His Excellency. Mr. V.'alton pointed out that H.M.G. had never oommitted themselves to letting the Kuwait Oil Company have the concession if a competitor appeared in the field. Sir Findlater Stewart had drawn attention to the fact that Traders Ltd. had in their possession a letter from the Sheikh which on the face of it was a definite grant of a concession and on 'which, if the Sheikh were a private individual, there might conceivably even be a question of an action in the Courts, except for the fact that the grant was subject to the approval od^IMM.G. He suggested that on that letter they would bo in a strong position to criticise H.M.G. if the latter now failed to take the merits of the competitors into consideration. Mr. Handel suggested that the Sheikh’s subsequent letter of 12th December was relevant in this respect, and must be regarded as definitely superseding the letter of September End.5. ^■i§lton agreed but said that the main point in the * letter of 2nd Sc-ptembor was that the Sheikh put the onus of approval on H.il.G. Sir Findlator Stewart would like to be satisiiud that on merits tha T&lt;rnwni+ n-M me iiuv/ait Oil Company was the bettor potential concessionaire, but he felt that if the concession went to the latter and H.M.G. were criticised they would not be able to depend solely on the Sheikh's having chosen, but would have to take their stand on the merits of the case as well. suggested that the line to be taken by H.n.Q. in answering criticism might be as follows:- This matter of the Kowoit oil concession had a very long history. At first there had been two companies computing for a concession. H.M.G. had then laid down, and committed themselves to, a certain policy namely that, subject to certain essential safeguards for British interests and for the Sheikh himself, there should be a fair field and no favour and that the Sheikh himself should decidu. no reminded the meeting that correspondence had passed 0n ° sui:i juct (e.g. with the U.S. Government) which was accessible to persons outside II.M. Service. H.M.G. could base their defence on the fact that they had consistently followed the policy which they had then publicly laid down. It was true th^t the Sheikh's letter of 2nd September purported to give a concession to the Company subject to certain conditions, but it Vuo obvious from that letter that the Company should have got mto immediate touch with H.M.G. Instead of this the Company's first approach had been more than two months later, when they hc.d allowed Lord Lloyd to telephone through a circuitous channel and only privately and confidentially an obscure and inaccurate hint. Even before Lord Lloyd had begun his private and confidential messages the Sheikh himself in October had resumed his negotiations with the Kuwait Oil Company. H.M.G. had been kept/(l 24- 6 • kupt ontircly in tho dark by Traders Ltd., and in these circumstances it had been impossible for them, in yie ’ V oi thoir P est P°licy, not to commit themselves to tho Kuwait Oil Company, who had accepted their conditions and were on the point of reaching an agreement with the Sheikh. ~~—suggested that it was precisely tnis policy to which H.M.G. had committed themselves in 1932 which Lord Lloyd would criticise. iiKj—JlKhQ-. 6 1 suggested that, in order to attack the, policy of H.M.G. , Lord Lloyd would have to take the line that H.M.G. had refused a fair opportunity to compete to Traders Ltd. an ostensibly British company. H.M.G.’s policy, however, had been laid down long befoie Traders Ltd. entered the field and there had been no information of the existence of this Company until H.M.G. ’were completely committed to the Kuwait Oil Company owing to the latter’s acceptance of H.M.G.’s conditions. It was true that in 1932 there was a purely British company in the field, namely the A.P.O.C.; but he did not think that Lord Lloyd would take the line that H.M.G. ought to have supported the A.P.O.C. at that time, since his attitude to the A.P.O.C. was now definitely hostile. What Lord Lloyd would say was that H.M.G. should have given the concession to Traders Ltd., his own proteges. Against this attack we had an extremely/extremely good defence, namely, that Lord Lloyd had ooen much too late in bringing them forward. ——-~°il s ^ id ^bat the fact that the Sheikh had now chosen the Kuwait Oil Company, coupled wi i,h the policy which K.M.G. had laid down in 1932 &gt; was certainly a powerful argument against Traders Ltd. -mu-bend^ agreed. H.M.G. might reasonably say that they had had no opportunity of changing that policy in the absence of another purely British competitor for the concession. Had Lord Lloyd produced his purely British company earlier, H.M.G. might have had an opportunity of reconsidering their policy, though this did not necessarily mean that they would have done so. M b-*. Starling suggested that if the concession were to be given to Traders Ltd. H.M.G. would then have to moot the argument that there had once been a purely British company in the field, namely, the A.Jr.O.C., and that they had failed to support it. Mr. Hended suggested that the immediate point at issue was to decide how to meet the criticism which might bo expected from Lord Lloyd that H.M.G. had unjustifiably sacrificed an important British interest in allowing the concession to go to the Koweit Oil Company instead of to Traders Ltd. But it would be quite compatible with this for H.M.G. to produce other arguments later in defence of their past polioy.(IZjo ii £.• » '--c,i’«ed tnat it was a good argument that in the absence onT any declaned competition with the Kuwait; Oil Compadij 1 there had been neithep reason nor opportunity lor H.M.G.to reconsider the policy laid doym in 1902. If Traders Ltd.had approached H.H.G. last April,H.H.G.,if satisfied as to thcii qualif icat.ions cc .,//oulu have had to allow them to compete lor a concession. Traders Ltd.had in fact postponed their application until 28th November,by which date (on 26th November) the Kuwait Oil Company had reached agreement with the Sheikh save on certain unimportant 'final points'. hr.Lendel suggested that the possibility ought also to be considered of Lord Lloyd taking the line that in April the Sheikh had informed K.M.G. that there was a purely British group in the field, but that in spite of this H.M.G.had not slowed down the Kuwait Oil Company’s negotiations. He might say that when his proteges obtained their concession from the Sheikh on 2nd September, they had not understood that they ought to have approached H.Ivi.G. at once, and he might insinuate that when they did ultimately do so on 28th November, H.M.G.had put up the Sheikh to - refusing their offer. It would be necessary to be ready with replies to these arguments. Mr.Stariinr&lt; said that the answer to this was that in response to a definite enquiry the Sheikh had declined last April to give the name of the British company which had made him an offer. Further the Sheikh had been told at that time that he must consult H.M.G. before entering into negotiations with any group. Mr.V/alton referred back to the point that the Sheikh had put the onus of making a decision upon H.M.G. The position was that the Sheikh had informed first Traders Ltd.and then the Kuwait Oil Company that he would grant them concessions. Mr. /9 . 'S i;£r, Sjial suggesocd that the offer which the Sheikh had iiiacle to 11 au.er s L^d.on c,nd September could not be regarded as open for acceptance indefinitely, and that the Sheikh was perj.ee uj./ justified in informing the Company on 12th December that the offer was now withdrawn. ——ii saiu he agreed with this up to a point,but that Lord Lloyd could make a good deal of capital out of the letter Oo. nnd September, mat was why Sir Findlater Stewart suggeoted that h.ivI.G. might have to base their case partly on the qualifications oi the tv/o companies. At any rate it uould be veil to have in reserve an argument on these lines, me asked the Peti oleum Department whether could say that ihljllA-.£,l c if^ on a- comparison of the two applicants, ix coders Ltu.ui e not so linely as the Kuwait Oil Company to make a good concessionaire? Mr.St arling said that the Petroleum Department felt clear on this point, but some of the reasons which influenced the Department in reaching its conclusion might be difficult to disclose in a discussion in Parliament. Traders Ltd.might, j.or example, come lorward with still further associated companies. From the Company’s articles of association there was nothing to show that they were competent to do much except obtain concessions. nr,Dalton suggested that we could not leave out of account the interests backing the Company. M r.Laithmaite said that the difficulty would be to meet the argument in Parliament that without considering in detail the status of Traders Ltd., their ability to work concessions, etc. ,H.M.G-.had approved the grant of the concession to the Kuwait Oil Company. It was important to find as much justification for this course as possible. Apparently 'tae financial position of the Company was sound. But were they/* r 10 . they equally sound technically ?, v/ere we in a position (without a detailed investigation, which would he a lengthy process) to say at once that they did not compare with the Kuwait Oil Company from this standpoint? ,ihh sohd that looking at the two companies it could he said that prime facie the Kuwait Oil Company was undoubtedly the stronger group of the two. Traders Ltd. were not equipped to search for, exploit or sell oil in large quantifies. Huntings, being a tanker shipping company, might sell a little as hunker oil, and Berry Wiggins, a comparatively small concern, might take small quantities for refining. Traders Ltd.had produced no evidence that they had the necessary qualifications for working a concession. With regard to the B.O.L. connection of Traders Ltd.,Lord Glenconner, who was one of the Directors of the Company, was associated with the notorious Mr. Rickett in an interprise known as the Anglo-Iraq Transport Company which had a distinctly B.O.D.flavour. The Foreig'n Office had supplied a report on this concern in which it was suggested that it was an extremely unsavoury business, of the sort v/here British people came in, made money, and then got out again as quickly as possible. Mr.Rickett was still a large shareholder in the B.O.D. He also referred to a report of an interview given a few months ago to Colonel Bovill and Mr/4*9 ^ ^ Mr.Hunting as representing the B.O.D. at the Admiralty (he had Mr.Seal’s permission to mention this) when they told a fantastic story about the enormous quantity of oil which had been discovered in the area west of the Tigris. Mr.Seal intervened to say that they had asked the Admiralty not to pass this information on to other Departments, not even the Petroleum Department whom they regarded as wholly identified with the A.P.O.C. interests; he therefore asked that the matter should be treated as confidential. Mr. Starling continuing said it was difficult to know why these gentlemen, who were also acting for Traders Ltd.,should attempt to give information of this character to a Government Department especially as although the B.O.D. had had their concession for more than two years as yet they had failed to discover oil in commercial quantities and had. had considerable difficulties in finding the money to pay their last dead rent of £125,000 (gold). These facts seemed clearly to justifj^ H.M.G. in regarding the Kuwait Oil Company as a definitely better concern than Traders Ltd. and their associates. Mr.RendelMr. Rendel suggested that there seemed to he three matters for decision;- (1) Whether H.M.G. ought now definitely to approve the Sheikh’s grant of a concession to the Kuwait Oil Company; (2) In the event of their doing so how to meet the expected criticism from Lord Lloyd; (3) The actual machinery of carrying out their decision. The first two had already been discussed. With regard to (3) he still thought that H.M.G. should put the onus of making a decision on the Sheikh. Mr. W r alton agreed that H.M.G. might do that in the first instance, but said that Sir S* Hoare in considering the matter would attach great importance to the question whether Traders Ltd. were definitely not likely to be as good a coneessionnaire as the Kuwait Oil Company. Were we in a position to say this? Mr. Starling said he thought we were. Besides the points which he had mentioned a most inport ant point was that there was nothing to show that Traders Ltd. would be able to market their oil if they got the concession. Mr. Rendel pointed out that it was urgent to get a decision on the matter if possible before Christmas. The Sheikh was a slippery individual. He was now ready to clinch with the Kuwait Oil Company, hut there was a danger that if any delay took place he might change his mind again. In view of this it was important that H.M.G. should not he responsible for delaying matters.13. It was Impossible for K.M.G. definitely to go against the Kuwait Oil Company, and he agreed that they should decide in their own minds in favour of the latter, but he thought it preferable, and Sir Robert Vansittart, with whom he had briefly discussed the whole question, had agreed, that H.M.G. should not themselves veto the application of Traders Ltd., but should fix the responsibility on the Sheikh, which could easily be done in view of His Excellency’s recent oommunications to that Company. Mr. Walton said that the India Office would have to write letters both to Traders Ltd. and to the Kuwait Oil Company. These letters would require very careful drafting. Mr. Rendel suggested that the India Office might remind the Kuwait Oil Company that the understanding reached earlier in the year had been that H.M.G. would raise no objection to the Company obtaining a concession from the Sheikh provided certain conditions were fulfilled. These conditions had now been complied with*and the Sheikh was now ready to sign a concession. Therefore in view of their earlier understanding with one Company, H.M.G. had no objection to the Sheikh’s granting the concession to the Company. The letter to Traders Ltd. presented more difficulty, and he suggested that the India Office might explain that the policy of H.M.G. had for some years been to allow the Sheikh a free choice in the matter of granting oil concessions, subject to certain specific conditions. These conditions v/ere (1) that any Company should communicate with h.M.G. before entering into negotiations and that the Sheikh should not enter into negotiations with/14. with any company without prior consultation with H.M. G. ; (2) that the essential interests of H.M. G. were properly safeguarded; (3) that the interests of the Sheikh were also properly safeguarded. neither the Sheikh nor Traders Ltd. had informed H.M.G. of their negotiations. The Company had failed to communicate to H.M.G. the Sheikh’s letter of 2nd September, despite the fact that the first paragraph of that letter, with its request for a telegraphic reply, made it clear that it was intended that the Company should at once get into touch with H.M.G. On the other hand another Company (which appeared to be the only one in the field) had complied with all the conditions mentioned above, and had, in view of this, been given to understand that H.HiG. would raise no objection to their obtaining a concession from the Sheikh if he would grant it. The Sheikh now informed H.M.G. that he was ready to grant a concession to this Company, and in view of their earlier understanding with the Company H.M.G. had given their approval to the Sheikh’s decision and were unable at this late stage to reconsider the matter. Mr. Laithwaite suggested that they might also say that even in so far as the Company had received the letter of 2nd September the Shedkh had denied that this letter was in any way intended to represent the definite grant of a concession. In any event the Sheikh said that he had heard nothing from the Company since 2nd September and there was nothing to show that the Company had in fact accepted the conditions put forward by the Sheikh. Mr. Seal/15. '23 — r » Seal pointed out ths,t the weakest link in the argument was that the Sheikh’s letter of 12th December did not antedate the application received from Traders Ltd. , but he agreed tnat H• id• G• could, if necessary, answer effectively any insinuation that H.M.G. had put the Sheikh up to writing his letter of 12th December to the Company, since it was clear from the correspondence that the Sheikh had not seen the Political Agent or the Political Resident before writing that letter. After further discussion it was agreed that the India Office should draft letters to Mr. Hunting and to the Kuwait Oil Company. Advance copies of the drafts would be circulated to the other departments and the India Office would simultaneously submit them to the Secretary of State for India with the results of the meeting. Copies of the two letters, as eventually concurred in by the other Departments concerned and despatched on December 21st to the Kuwait Oil Company and to Traders Ltd. respectively, are now attached (Annex).

As regards (a) - vide his letter No^R/4/1864 of 16th December 1934 - I do not think that the Shaikh’s explanation ( is a satisfactory one. In the first place he could have mentioned the fact of these negotiations, without going into details, to Major Watts who knows sufficient Ar^uic to under- stana such a communication; or to Colonel Loch, who can speak Arabic, when he was here at the end of September. Moreover he did not inform Colonel Dickson who had returned to Kuwait on the 16th October about these negotiations until the middle of November. In the second place when he did inform Colonel Dickson he did not divulge the name of the Company and merely stated that he had been approached by the Company, not that he had intimated to them as far back as September 2nd that, subject to their securing the approval of His Majesty’s Govern ment, and their acceptance of certain conditions, he himself approved the terms of the concession and was prepared to sign it. 6. I suggest therefore that I may be authorised to write to the Shaikh in the terms of the enclosed draft.

Kuwait Oil Go. Ltd., I am directed by the s/s for I. to refer to your interview at the India Office on 17th December, in which you reported that agreement had now-been reached between you and H.E. the Sheikh of Koweit on the subject of the terms of an oil concession in respect of ? Koweit and that H.E. was prepared to sign the concession in your favour immediately, subject to the approval of K.M.Gr. 2. It was understood in the earlier discussions between your company and H.M.l. that no objection would be raised to the grant of a concession by the Sheikh to your company, subject to certain specified conditions. These 4 conditions have been fulfilled, and having regard to the understanding in question and to the fact that the Sheika has now decided to grant the concession to your company I am directed to inform you that H.M.G-. have approved the Sheikh’s decision^and to say that it is assumed that you will now take the necessary ste_.;s to complete the signature of your agreement with H.E.jJRAI^r LET TEE LI. Hunting, Esq., c /4 A^k vi ^ rtiy** U-tL , €-C*l. I am directed by the S/S for I. oo state that he has had under consideration your letter of 28th November, PLH/WGL, on tne question of the grant of an oil concession in Koweit to Messrs. Traders Ltd. 2 * 0n receipt of your letter of 28th Novemberjwhich was the first intimation which he received from your Company that they were interested in the matter, the S/S took steps to ascertain from the Sheikh of Koweit the ^ *'Hy- position in regard to his relations with Traders Ltd. The Sheikh has now stated in reply to this enquiry that the letter of 2nd September to Mr. Gabriel, of which a copy was enclosed in your letter under reference, was not in any way intended to represent the grant of a concession to your company by him. He added that as he had heard nothing further from your company subsequently to the date of that letter he informed Mr. Gabriel on 12th December that he was about to come to terms with the Kuwait Oil Co. ( and that on 15th December he telegraphed to Mr. Gabriel that he had done so and that further nogotiatitmc with your company must cease. 3. I am to explain that H.M.G.have for some considerable time been guided in regard to the question of the grant of oil concessions in Kuweit by certain definite principles which they felt bound to adopt in view of the special circumstances of the case, and which are well known to the Sheikh and tothe various applicants who have from time to time approached H.M.G. in the matter. The effect of these principles is that the responsibility for deciding as to the grant of an oil concession shall rest with H.E. subject to the following conditions:- (a) that the Sheikh (and similarly any applicant for a concession) should consult with H.M.G. before entering into negotiations for a concession and that H.M.G should be kept fully informed of all negotiations in connection with the grant of any concession; (b) that arrangements should be made to ensure that the interests of H.lvl.G. should be specifically safeguarded in the event of any concession being granted; (c) that the interests of the Sheikh himself and of his principality should be sufficiently safeguarded in any concession granted. 4. As you are aware, the Kuwait Oil Co. have for a considerable period been in negotiation with the Sheikh. Before initiating those negotiations the Kuwait Oil Company placed themselves in touch with H.M.G. and were informed of the conditions set out above. Having undertaken to satisfy those conditions they were informed that no objection was seen to their initiating negotiations with H.E. and they were also given to understand ; long before it was known that your Company were in the field, that inthe event of their reaching agreement with the Sheikh as to the terms of a concession within the limits indicated above, the approval of H.M.G. to the grant of such concession would not be withheld. the case of the negotiations between Messrs. Traders Ltd. and the Sheikh, no approach was made to H.M.G. by your company and no information that they desired to secure a concession in respect of this area was received by H.M.G. until 28th Hovember, although from the papers submitted with their application on that date it appeared that discussions with the Sheikh had reached an advanced stage by 2nd September. Despite the request in the opening paragraph of the Sheikh’s letter of 2nd September (which, as explained above, the Sheikh states that he did not in any way regard as constituting a grant of a concession to your company) that your company should place themselves in communication with H.M.G. and obtain a telegraphic reply, a delay of almost three months took place before any communication was made to H.M.G. by your company^by which time the negotiations between the Sheikh and the Kuwait Oil Company had been completed except tor one or two minor points. 6 . Having regard to the understanding with the Kuwait Oil Company referred to in paragraph 4 abovej to the iact that the conditions referred to in paragraph 3 have been/been satisfied by that company, and tiiat the Sheikh, in the exercise of nis choice, has elected to grant a concession to that company, and to the communication which H.E. states he has made to hi. Gabriel, the S/S now directs me to say that H.M.G. are not prepared to interfere with the decision which tne oheikh has reached. They have, therefore, informed H.E., in accordance with tne understanding previously reached with the Kuwait Oil Company, uiiab they concur in his granting the concession to that Company. /:51&lt; &gt;i 5000 10.34 Draft Paper.

After review of all the circumstances the conference unanimously recommended that immediate a proval should be given to the grant by the Sheikh of the Koweit concession to the Kuwait Oil Company, and that Traders Ltd. should be informed that this had been done, a full statement of the ^circumstances in which approval had been given by of such a nature that it could if necessary be quoted in Parliament, being embodied in an official letter of rejection to them. 3. The meeting considered that the acceptance of the Kuwait Oil Company could be justified on the following lines and that difficulty ought not to be experienced in dealing with the matter if it was raised in Parliament. / The Policy adopted by H.ivi.G!-. in 1932-05 . The Sheikh 1 s choice a free one . /^eTm.G. in 1932 informed the U.S. Government in effect that they left the Sheikh free to choose between A.P.J.C. and E. &amp; General Syndicate provided his and our fundamental interests were safeguarded; and the liberty of choice then granted him had never been withdrawn (P.Z. 2298/32) In 1933, after the A.P.O.C. and the Gulf Oil had for a long time been competing against one another, they ado^.t) aft opgn ppi i '^iwn i -h } subject to certain desiderata being satisfied/satisiied. They had informed the Kuwait Oil Company of those desiderata and had given them to understand that subject to fulfilment of them by the company and to the company 1 s being able to secure the grant of a concession from the Sheikh, the approval of H.M.C. to such a concession would not be withheld. The Company had satisfied our desiderata, and the Sheikh had now spontaneously given them the concession. The Company having regard to their understandings with E.M.G-. and to the Sheikh’s action, could legitimately ask that our approval should not be withheld. Whatever might be said about the wisdom of an open door policy, it had been laid down when no competitor other than those represented by the Kuwait Oil Company was in the field, and had had the advantage of securing definite British safeguards. There had been no reason to reconsider it in the absence of any competitor other than the Kuwait Oil Company; no information was in fact received of the existence of any possible competitor until 28th November 1934, by which time the Sheikh had reached agreement with the Kuwait Oil Company on all except certain minor final points. The mere fact that Messrs# Hunting had, for the first time, made an official application on that date was hazS^y sufficient justification for a last moment reversal of the policy. In any event, if Messrs. Hunting were to be admitted on a basis of preference for British competitors the A#P#O.C. , who, as a result on the open door policy adopted in 1932, had had to comoine with tne Standard Oil, would have a legitimate complaint i± they weie not allowed to compete on a purely British basis. (b) Comparison of the two Companies on merits # Financially Traders Ltd. seemed satisfactory.3.

Points of great importance were: absence of proved ability, of experience of oil exploitation on the large scaie^tS, in particular, ‘^Oet^^Tth^^^ * products - even so large an organisation as the Standard Oil had been in serious marketing difficulties over its Bahrein production. This was, of course, material from the point of view of the Sheikh's royalties. The Admiralty further gave confidential information about certain rather wild-cat oil proposals which had been put up by Mr .Hunting in respect of areas in Iraq. The proposals had not been 01 such a nature as to encourage any confidence in the —- cpaoit, o, ar. Hunting. ' tne 0c: ' la ' nGe advantage appeared definitely to rest with the Kuwait Oil Company. ^ c ^ j-As handli ng oj. the matter by Messrs .Hunting . We cojld noc make too much play with Messrs. Hunting’s failure to use the proper official channels, or, perhaps, with the Sheikh’s repudiation of his letter of 2 nd September, though that was an important point. But, on the informatior oiven us by the Sheikh, His Excellency might reasonably as a matter of ordinary business have regarded the company as Waving dropped out of the bidding. They had sent no replyto tne Sheikh's letter of 2 nd September, and did not appear to have given him the understanding for which he asked in that letter. Most important of all, they had clearly disregarded his suggestion in his letter that they should get in touch with H.M.Gr. as a matter of urgency (tne Sheikh's letter suggested that a telegraphic reply should be sent). They had taken three months before they approached Even then they appeared to have done so with some reluctance, and through Lord Lloyd, who, in the first instance, was not prepared to have his name quoted in connection with their application. 3. The general line of the drafts attached (which are largely based on suggestions made by the Foreign Office) was agreed in the meeting. Advance copies were sent to the other departments for consideration last night. It was, of course, understood that they were entirely subject to the views of higher authority here. It is submitted that they represent the best that we can make of this rather difficult case and that on the whole there is advantage in giving a full explanation to Messrs.

My dear Kisch, With further reference to my letter of yesterday on the Koweit Oil Concession, I have now received further information regarding the Mosul Oilfields, Limited, in which the group who are negotiating for the Koweit Oil Concession is ./. interested. The information is contained in a note which I enclose herewith. Y 0 u will observe from this that the British interests own 51/6 in the Company, while the whole of the balance is apparently held by foreigners. You will also note that the Company owns a big oil concession on the west bank of the Tigris in Iraq, its rights extending for 75 years. The Company proposes to build a pipe line from Mosul to Alexandretta - about 500 miles - and they have already struck oil. Contrary to the impression expressed in my yesterday’s letter, it seems, in the light of the further information received, that the Company is apparently not merely engaged in the exploration of the concession area, but intends to exploit Yours ^sincerely, the oilfields.33 (! f 3 U MOSUL OIL FIELDS LTD., 9, Mincing Lane, E.C.3.

(l £6 Please see previous submission on P.z.7298/34 flagged oelow. since the date of that submission: (a) the information given us by Lord Lloyd and by Traders Ltd. as to the Sheikh’s relations with that company have been substantially confirmed; (b) before any communication haa been made to the Sheikh on oehalf of H.M.G. in connection with the application submitted by Traders Ltd., the sheikh, who says he had heard nothing from Traders since the date of his letter of 2nd September, had warned them on 12th December that he was about to close with the Kuwait Oil Co. and informed them on loth December that he had now reached agreement with the Kuwait Oil Co. and that further conversations must therefore cease; (c) the Sheikh has formally intimated to the Kuwait Oil Co. that he is prepared to grant the Koweit oil concession to them. The Kuwait Oil Co. have made a formal official request for the approval of H.M.G. to the grant of a concession by the sheikh; (d) in reply to a direct enquiry by the Kuwait Oil Co. as to whether any other applicant was in the field it proved necessary to inform them on 12th % December that an application had been received from another company which was still under investigation ana that pending enquiry of the sheikh as to what had in fact passed between him and the other company and what his position was in regard to it, it could not be assumed that, even if the sheikh were now to approve the Kuwait Oil Co.’s draft concession, the approval of H.JL.G# to the grant of the concession to the Kuwait Oil Co. would necessarily follow as a natter of course. jLtd 2. The questions now for decision are: (a) what answer is to^ oe sent to iraaei (t )) what reply is to oe given to the Kuwait Oil Company's request for approval; (c) what line we are to talce with tne Sheikh; (d) whether the history of this case reveals any weaknesses which should he remedied in the staffing of the political posts in tne Persian Gulf. An interdepartmental meeting has been summoned urgently for tomorrow afternoon - Wednesday, 19th December - to reach a decision as to the line to «ae be taken, and the other departments have been informed that we would endeavour to obtain the provisional instructions of the secretary of State in time for the meeting. The only points of active concern to the meeting are, however, (a) and (b)- (a) Question of reply to be sent to Traders Ltd. 3. In dealing with Traders we shall have to oe very careful to avoid exposing surface to Lord Lloyd, but the position is greatly eased by the fact that the Sheikh has apparently now spontaneously and in advance of any communication by H.M.G, (we have sent a telegram to place this beyond doubt, but it seems clear from para.1(f) of Colonel Dickson's telegram on P.Z.'niV34) informed Traders that conversations with them must cease as he had reached an agreement with the Kuwait Oil Co. Traders may allege that they have suffered as a result of submitting an application formally to us on the 28th November and that we ought to have taken steps more urgently to ascertain what the Sheikh’s position was in regard to that application and whether we would be prepared to consider it. I do not think this is a substantial point. Traders seem/5/ Minute Paper. 3. Department. seem to have made no approach to the sheikh between 2nd September and 28th November when they first communicated with us, and they must thank themselves ior mie difficulties that have arisen. Ihere was in fact a certain delay in making the communication to tne sheikh which was authorised on P.Z.7298/34, as the result of illness in Colonel Powle's family, but the correspondence makes it clear that there was no intentional laxity on our part. 4. Both to Traders and to Lord Lloyd we could oay that Traders have themselves to thank for the trouble that has arisen, if they had approached Hin April last instead of endeavouring to estaolish. contact with the Sheikh hy circuitous means, H.li.G., on the assumption that their financial credentials were satisfactory and that they were prepared to give us the necessary 'British safeguards' (which are in fact to a large extent lacking in their existing draft) would certainly have been prepared to * * - - — - * «_ A XL L L /T — ' ^ r ^ &lt; entertain their application. Had they come to us even so late as 2nd September, when they secured the Sheikh*s letter agreeing to grant them a concession 'subject to the approval of H.M.G.' and had they (or one sheikh) then alleged that the Sheikh Is action was due to the fact that he had given up hope of any agreement with the Kuwait Oil Co., it would have been very difficult for us to refuse to consider them. Actually, oy leaving matters to the last moment, they have allowed the sheikh to reach agreement with the Kuwait oil Co. ana made it impossible for us to interfere on their behalf, even if we wanted to do so.5. There need, I tiiiiikc* oe no. difTicultry in answering Lord Lloyd if He should put down aquestion on this subject. The correspondence couldrbepublished as it stands; we have been extremely cautious, nave brought no pressure to bear on the Sheilch, and made no communication to him before he himself broke with Traders. 7/e further havefgone out of our way to warn the Kuwait Oil Ooj that even if they now secured the Sheikh's approval (as they have done) oo their draft concession they could not assume the approval of H.L.G. because of the presence of the new applicants. We are relieved of the burden of urging the claims of the new applicants by the Sheikh's decision to terminate negotiations with them. 6. in these circumstances I suggest that the reply to Traders Ltd. should he that the sheikh, on a communication being made to him in regard to their application, has informed us that he had now reached agreement with the Kuwait Oil Co. and that he had Ax iv*&gt; *A***Jr b* «£• a -0 earlier in the month warned Traders Limitec^T' ilaci later, of his own initiative, informed them, through A*- f +- .

There can, I think, In all the circumstances, be no question that we must approve the Kuwait Oil Co• f s concession. Uafortunately, the effect of the discussions of the last few days and of the inter vention of Traders Ltd. has been to arouse not unnatural suspicions of the attitude of H.M.G. in the minds of the American partners. But the case for accepting their application seems in all‘the circumstances to be a clear one. Tv J UrC fagr Aa- LaxtK. 'Minute Paper. 5. Department. Sheikh*s canduct and t.hs to h e taken wita hlmT 8. The Sheikh's explanation, as contained In Colonel Dickson's telegram on F.z.7714/34, of 16th December, Is wholly unsatisfactory. It will be seen that he endeavours to minimise the importance of his letter of 2nd September to the Company. But that letter (subject to a minor reservation about certain portions of the draft concession underlined in the Arabic text) is a formal intimation of his acceptance of Traders* proposals 'subject to the approval of H.L.J. 1 *. secondly, he was explicitly warned last April that we expected him to consult with us before entering into discussion with any other negotiators. Despite that warning he seems (putting it at its lowe st) to have received!'several determined advances' from Traders Ltd. during the summer about which he mad no statement to us, and even on his own story to have accepted their proposals immediately they were laid before him on 1st September. It seems difficult to oelieve, given the lengthy and contentious negotiations which have taken place with the Kuwait Oil Co. over the terms of their concession, that the Sheikh would have been prepared to accept an elaborate concession such as this in full after one hay's consideration. In any event, he ought to have asked H.JL.G. before committing himself. Thirdly, only the Kuwait Oil Co. can clear up whether the Sheikh or fn. Chisholm is in the right as to tne date from which i ■Jie three months* option which the sheikh gave to the 2621 6000 3/34 Kuwait oil Co. in the summer ran - whether- 1 f rom the 30th/30tti Fay or from tiie 14th June. Whatever the position,, The Sheikh entered into the understanding in question on the basis that the Kuwait Oil company's negotiators would return to London; make his position clear to the principals; and then come hack to Koweit in the autumn to resume negotiations. His suggestion that on the date on which he alleges that the option expired 'the Kuwait Oil Company had done absolutely nothing to meet his demands* is both disingenuous and unfair to the Kuwait Oil Co. His conduct in resuming negotiations six weeks later, in October, without any warning to the Kuwait Oil _Co. : that he was committed to Traders, sm-hls failurefCo' inform tjho rola^iicai Agent of what, t CG- + Ctj.

The sheikh has teen lowing signs for some time past oi getting slightly out of hand - possibly our own fault, because we have given him too much liberty in regard to his oil concession*. Admittealy he has grievances against us in respect of his date gardens and of the Koweit blockade (though he is to some extent himself responsible for the delay in disposing of the latter question); but be that as it may, it is now recognised by all the departments concerned that Koweit is becoming more and more of a key point, ana it seems essential to tighten up our control over the Sheikh, if it is agreed that the Kuwait Oil Co. are to be approved by H.ihG. it will be ^eot that he shoula formally sign a concession in their i-avour. ye might consult the Government of India as to what line to take with him once that Jpas been done (iu will, 01 course, be necessary also to discuss the* matter with tne foreign Office).

The sheikh has a grievance against Ion Saud. in respect of this olockade, which we have promised to try to remedy. But our endeavours to do so have for the last 12 months or more been held up because the Sheikh, without consulting us, wrote a foolishly expressed letter to Ion 3aud which Ibn Baud read as abandoning certain raid claims. This was apparentlyf^the intention of the Sheikh, but a situation has arisen In which Ibn Saud refuses to proceed with discussion of the blockade unless the Sheikh stands by his earlier letter and withdraws the claims, while the sheikh refuses to contest Ibn Saud*s interpretation of the letter, but equally refuses to abandon his claims. It is proposed, in the light of discussion with Colonel Fowle during the sumner, to inform the sheikh that he has hopelessly t compromised the position as regards his claims ana that inform • ■ve propose therefore to/ron 3aud that they are abandoned and to continue to press the King to raise the blockade. 1 6000 3/34 (h)/(d) We adopt a stiffer line on tne question of airect correspondence between tne Sdeikii and Idn Saud.

From comments made by other departments it is already clear that our anticipations that the failure of our intelligence service in Kuwait has produced a oau impression are likely to be fulfilled* lajor Watts, though he has been some time in the Gulf, knows vei'y little Arabic and spent much of the summer away from Koweit where he was acting*. Colonel Dickson, despite his close relations (possibly too friendly) with the Sheikh and his great knowledge of the State, seems to have been kept entirely' in the dark by His Excellency and began to find out that anything was afoot only hi the course of November (see his despatch of 17th November below). It is a question, too, whether there is not something to be said from a different standpoint for arranging that intelligence, etc. reports from Koweit shall invariably be repeated airect to the Secretary of State or the Government of India, as the case may be. This however can be considered more at leisure. 11. In the light of the minutes above, it is submitted: (a) that the reply to Traders Ltd. should be on the lines suggested in para.(3) above.

XM- 1 At interviews with the Koweit Oil Coy. on 12th and 13th December we informed them, in reply to a specific enquiry from them, that an application from another company had now been received, and that we were awaiting certain information from Koweit before deciding what action to take. At a farther interview on 17th t December we were able to give them further information in the light of Col. Dickson's telegram of 16th December c (without, however, disclosing the name of the other applicant); the fact that the Sheikh had himself broken with Traders and was prepared to agree with the Koweit Oil Coy. obviously made the position easier; nevertheless, we continued to maintain a noncommittal attitude/attitude, and stated that as an official application has been received from'another company, we must submit for the decision of higher authority the question whether anproval should be accorded to the grant of a concession to the Koweit Oil Coy. This question, and the difficult question of the terms of the reply to be made to the letter Traders Ltd. of 28th November, are now the questions which require urgent decision. The Koweit Oil Coy. naturally took the line that, in view Ox all that has passed between them and H.M.G., a competitor ought not to be admitted to the field at this late hour o: the day, of and that there was no reason why they should not at once receive H.M.G.*s approval of the concession which the Sheikh is ready to grant them. One cannot but have full sympathy with this attitude, and we promised that at any rate we would take with the utmost expedition the steps necessary (i.e., consultation with the other ^epts. concened and submission to higher authority) for arriving at a decision. The quest ions what line to take with the Sheikh and whether we should address the Viceroy on the subject o the staffing of the Gulf posts (2(c) and (i-) of Mr. Laithwaite’s minute) are also important questions, but the se matters can, if necessary, be considered at greater leisure and with the deliberation which they deserve. Meanwhile, it is submitted that at the meeting to-morrow with representatives of the Petroleum Dept., F.O. and Admiralty we should take the line that approval should be given to the grant of the concession to the Koweit Oil Coy., and that Traders Ltd. should be informed that we cannot grant their application. These communications will need careful drafting. We might submit/Minute Paper. Department. 2956 6000 7/34 submit the attached drafts for the consideration of the meeting. ihis decision is recommended on the following grounds: - « (a) ihe attitude of the Sheikh towards the two applications. We have received from Col. Dickson (telegram o: iHth December) confirmation of the fact tiiat the Sheikh had broken off negotiations with Traders Ltd. before Col. Dickson’s interview with him. The Sheikh, therefore, in doing so had acted on his own initiative before he received any communication from . us (moreover, our communication was at this stage designedly confined to a request for confirmation of what had happened, and an explanation). The Sheikh’s own wishes in choosing between two competitors are, of course, a very important - perhaps the most important - consideration. (b) The conduct of Traders Ltd. has not been such as to inspire confidence m them. They approached the Sheikh direct m April, without giving H.M.G. any intimation of their proposal to do so. Then, at some time before 2nd September they submitted an actual draft concession, again without giving H.M.G. any information. On 2nd September they received a letter from the Sheikh agreeing to their terms subject to the approval of H.M.G. Traders Ltd. acted wrongly in the first place in approaching the Sheikh direct and secretively, but what is most inexplicable in their conduct is that between receiving the Sheikh's letter of 2nd September and 28th November they still took no steps to apply for the approval of H.M.G., or even to inform/ 4 a SJf W i■ infon^that they were a candidate. (c) Sir H. Strakosch has most kindly made comprehensive enquiries into the financial standing of Traders Ltd. and their backers, the likelihood of their being seriously inclined to work the concession, ana the nationality of their associates. It will be seen from his letter of 18th December that, while the financial resources of the new applicants are beyond doubt, there is no evidence of their experience or capacity for working an important oilfield; furthermore, the most important of the associated enterprises (Mosul Oilfields; is under forei^i influence, if not foreign control!^, Sir H. Strakosch’s conclusion is that, on all the information, the new applicants are not likely to prove as desirable a concessionaire as the Koweit Oil Coy. It is submitted that the above facts give us ample material for answering any criticism that may be levelled against H.M.G. for approving the Koweit Oil Coy. after another company, which alleges itself to oe purely British, has entered the field.

Sir, I am directed by the S. of S. for I. to state that he has had under consideration your letter of 28th Novr., reference PLH/kVGL, on the question of the grant of an oil concession in Koweit to Messrs. Traders Ltd. . 2. It is understood that you first approached the Sheikh of Koweit in regard to a concession m April last. I am to observe that, as the Sheikh is precluded from granting any oil concession without the appoval of H.M.G., the more regular course would have been for you to approach H.M.G. in the first instance. however, received no information that you were a candidate for the concession until 28th November, although your negotiations with the Sheikh had evidently reached an advanced stage by 2nd September. Throughout this period negotiations were in progress between the Sheikh and another Company, the Ke^wsit Oil Coy., which had approached H.M.G. at an earlier date and received their permission to negotiate. 3. After 28th November, when he first had an opportunity of considering your application, the S. of S., having’ regard to the history of the other negotiations/f' t • negotiations, decided that it was necessary, as a first step, to obtain farther information from the Sheikh of Koweit as to the position in regard to his relations with yoar Coy. The Sheikh now states that the letter of 2nd September to Mr. Gabriel of which a copy was enclosed in yoar letter ander reference, was not m any way intended to represent the grant of an oil concession to yoar Coy. by him. He adds that, as he had heard nothing farther from yoar Coy. sabseqaently to the date of that letter, he informed Mr. Gabriel on 12th December that he was aboat to come to terms with the Koweit Oil Coy., and that on 15th December he telegraphed to Mr. Gabriel that he had done so, and that farther negotiations with yoar Coy. mast cease. 4. In view of the decision which the Sheikh has taken in this matter, with which H.M.G. are not prepared to interfere, and of the commonication which H.E. states that he has made to Mr. Gabriel, the S. of S. assames tn^t you will not desire to oroeeed ;arthe^witiryoar sppiicationT and/is unable to accede to yoar reqaest that approval shoald be given to the grant of a concession to yoar Coy.Draft Paper. political Department.

Sir Cecil Kisch, K.C.I.E.. C.B., Assistant Under-Secretary of State, INDIA OFFICE, Whitehall, S.W.i. My dear Kisch, KOWEIT OIL CONCESSION. Partly owing to an indisposition, which incapacitated me for a few days last week, but also because of some difficulty in collecting the necessary information, I am only to-day able to reply to some of the questions which you put in your letter of the 6th instant, and which were set out more precisely in the Minute which you sent with it. I shall deal with them seriatim:- (a) The financial standing of Mr. Hunting and of the other persons connected with the enterprise is, I am informed, undoubted. Many of the limited liability companies controlled by them (of which a list is herewith enclosed), with the exception of the Mosul Oilfields Limited and Charles Tennant, Sons &amp; Co., Ltd., have relatively small capitals.Sir Cecil Kisch, 2. Wm •/ • 18/12/34. I am told, however, that the means of those controlling these companies are substantial, from which it may be inferred that they and their companies would probably be able to provide considerable sums of money for the exploration of the oilfield in question. There is also attached a schedule showing the Board Seats occupied by those chiefly connected with the enterprise. (b) Judging from the shortoparticulars given in regard to the companies, it may be inferred that they have been engaged in exploratory operations on oilfields, as also in the over-seas transport of oil (through their tank steamship enterprises), in the refining of oil on a small scale, and m the trading in oil. There is no evidence, however, that they have been engaged in the exploitation - as distinct from exploration - of any important oilfield, nor that they possess an organisation capable of efficiently exploiting, that is, working, an oilfield when once its value has been established. (c &amp; d) The information which I have been able to collect is not sufficient to enable one definitely to say whether the group has any serious interest in actually working the concession. Judging, however, from their past activities, it does not seem likely that it has, having regard especially to the difficulties which they would be likely to encounter SSir Cecil Kisch, 3. * ^ -r 18/12/34. 1D t» e . my well-equipped oil exploitation companies, and their great financial strength. (e) Judged by its capital, the most important enterprise with which the group is conneoted is the Mosul Oilfields, Ltd (housed in the offices of Messrs. Charles Tennct, Sons » c„ ' Ltd). The Company is a private one, and my endeavours to ’ obtain particulars regarding its assets and its operations have so far been fruitless. All I have been able to ascertain about the Company will be found in the note which accompanies this letter. 1 have been advised that further information can only be secured by applying for it to Uud Glenconner direct. This I have thought undesirable at the present stage. I should like to draw particular attention, however, to the fact that, judging by the persons represented on its Board, the interests of foreigners in the Company are very important. In a directorate of 16, there are at least 8 - possibly 9 - foreigners, the greater number of whom seem to be Italians. While I am dictating this letter, I have obtained further information about the capitalisation of the Company. The original capital was £1,000,000, of which 200,000 shares of £1 each were issued for cash, and 783,704 shares of £1 each were apparently issued as fully paid in respect of Vendors consideration. The balance of 16296 shares have apparentlySir Cecil Kisch, 4. not yet been issued. On April 6th, 1934, the capital was increased by 1,000,000 'A' Ordinary shares of 6/8d each. Of these, 750,129 shares were allotted in April last, 2o, 995 ' ' n « j U jj e « 15,000 'it it n Sept&gt; „ Total 789,124 shares allotted. 18/12/34. | These were apparently issued for cash, providing the Company with £261,000, which, together with the 200,000 shares of £1 each, issued for cash, would appear to have given the Company a total wooing capital of £461,000. The balance of 210,876 shares have apparently not yet been issued. On September 13th, 1934, the capital was again increased by 500,000 new 'A” Ordinary shares of 6/8d each, and 350,000 new 'Ordinary” shares of £1 each. No allotment, however, has yet been made of this new issue. It will be observed that, among the principal shareholders, there is the General© National Petroli, Rome, which holds Shares of £1 each Shares of 6/8 each and the Deutsche Treuhand Gesellschaft, Berlin Total 237,387 100,800 338,187 625,000 36,000 661,000Sir Cecil Kisch, 5. 18/12/34 Thus these two foreign companies together hold 36/ of the £1 shares, and 84/ of the 6/8d shares at present issued. I have not been able to ascertain the voting rights of the two classes of sharesj It is clear, however, from the number of foreign directors, and from the very important financial interests of foreigners, that the Company is under the influence, if not the control, of foreigners. Generally, I am inclined to conclude from all this information, that the group is not likely to prove as desirable a concessionaire as the Anglo-bersian Oil Company and the Gulf Oil Company of Pennsylvania as joint exploiters of the concession. 0*4^ VO.

A meeting was held at the India Office on 17th December with representatives of the Kuwait Oil Company: Present Mr . Walt on ) Mr.Lai t hwa i t e ) Mr.Crombie ) Mr.Stevens ) Mr. Hearn ) Mr.Kemp ) India Office Kuwait Oil Company. Mr.Stevens opened the discussion by touching on one or two matters of minor importance. The words 'in the first instance' had now been retranslated to read 'on the first occasion' in the English version of Article of the Commercial Agreement, and the Sheikh had accepted a small amendment in Article 6 (c), namely the insertion of the word 'production' before 'records'. The Company had now telegraphed to Koweit accepting the Sheikh’s terms in full and had received a reply that the Sheikh desired to sign the concession as soon as possible but that he would require an assurance irom the Political Agent that H.M.G.approved. The documents were being despatched to Koweit from Cairo by air mail and should arrive on 18th or 19th December, Were n.M.G.now prepared to give the necessary assurance to the Sneikhr Mr. Walt on said that he noted that the Sheikh had reached agreement with the Company and that the lattei now formally asked for the approval oi H.M.G. It would now be necessary to take orders from higner autuoi itg as to the answer to be given to the Company’s request for approval and to the other application whicn had been received/N received. It was impossible to ignore the latter. He was not yet in a position to divulge the name of the other Company. The position was that the India Office had received the other application on 28th November and that according to the applicants a good deal of progress had been made towards obtaining a concession. The India Office on receiving the application had been distinctly puzzled since they had heard nothing about any other application since last April when no one had taken the matter very seriously. They had therefore decided that the first essential was to check up the position with the Sheikh and ascertain what foundation there was for the other applicants account of their position vis a vis the Sheikh. They had only that morning received a reply to their enquiries from Koweit. This reply confirmed that last September the Sheikh was in negotiation with another applicant and had to some extent committed himself to the approval of a concession; but nothing further had happened until the end of November when the other Company had made a formal application to the India Office asking lor approval for the grant of a concession. Mr.Hearn suggested that now that the Sheikh had exchanged letters with the Kuwait Oil Company accepting the latter’s terms there was nothing lor any other applicant to apply for, since the Sheikh could not, presumably, grant the concession a second time. Mr.Y/alton agreed that the fact that the Sheika was now ready to sign the Kuwait Oil Company’s concession did to some extent clear up the position. But it would still be necessary to submit the question oi approving the grant of the concession to the Kuwait Oil Company, 01 alteinative- ly of further examining the other application, to the other/other interested Departments and to the higher authorities. It was impossible for any further step to be taken without reference to these higher authorities. j..Ij «haithwui ^e explained tnat the other Govermiieiit Departments had not yet been consulted for tlie same reason ao no coniuiuriicabion had been made to the Company until uue matter was raised by Mr.Stevens on lEtli December LCr. Stevens said that the impression which he had received from past discussions had been that the Company would be at once informed if any other applicant applied for a concession, and speaking frankly he felt that the Company had been badly treated in this respect. Mr. Walt on explained that the other application had only been received on 28th November and that the India Office had felt bound to ask the Sheikh for confirmation of the position before informing the Company. The Resident had accordingly been instructed to go himself to Koweit to interview the Shei 1th, but owing to illness in his family Colonel Powle had been unable to do so. Colonel Dickson, the Political Agent, had then been authorised to interview-the Sheikh, and the telegram reporting his interview had only been received tnat morning. Before that the India Office had not known where they stood and had not felt justified in broaching the matter with the Company (until Mr. Stevens himseli. asked a question on 12th December) as we were still not in possession of relevant information. In considering their decision regarding the concession the higher authorities concerned would be fully informed of the past history of the case and of the Sheimh 1 s vvishes in the matter; the other applicants appeared to be quite substantial financiall5 r , but it was not yet known whether they had any previous technical experience in '‘working/working oil concessions. In reply to a question from Mr.Stevens, Mr. Walt on said that at this stage political interest in the matter of the Kowe it Oil concession was a factor which could not he ignored. The position based on the Sheikh* s treaty with ELM. G. and also on past practice and policy was that the Sheikh was not permitted to grant an oil concession without the approval of H.M.G. The British Government therefore had a certain responsibility to the public in the matter. So long as there was only one applicant for the concession the position was quite straightforward now that a second competitor had entered the field and submitted an official application before the Kuwait wil Compc-n^y had finally come to terms with the Sheikh, there 'was a possibility of criticism ii H.M.G. failed to take both applications into consideration, and on account 01 unis risk our higher authorities might wish to weigh the matter further before arriving at a decision. Mr. Stevens suggested that the criticism refeired to would be criticism of the existence of an American element in the Kuwait Oil Company. Mr. niton said that that no doubt might be one factor in any criticism, but reiterated that the main point ;hat we now had two applications. Mr.Stevens said that lie would ^gree with statement of the position if there were in faot t '° aegotiators, but not in a case like the present v-’laere one of the negotiators had already reached agreement with the Sheikh* Mr .Hearn refused to imagine the possibility ot Government authorities concerned giving the ; ..o,.vit concession to other applicants who had been so late in submitting their application. Mr.StevensHr.StevenG said that he would he put to great personal inconvenience if he had to remain in London for more than a fortnight. He suggested that in ordinary fairness to himself personally and to the Company,every effort should he made to obtain the decision of the Government authorities at the earliest possible date and if at all possible before Christmas. After further discussion it was agreed that all possible steps should be taken to expedite a decision, though clearly no firm undertaking in regard to a particular date could be given.ohlldifth attempt to try and force the Kuwait Oil Company to bid higher than they were (ioing* 5.

Kuwait Cil Company ^ izzl M r. Steven s opened the discussion by touching on one or two matters of minor Importance. The words 'in the -irst instance' had now been retranslated to read 'on the first occasion' in the English version of Article of the Commercial Agreement, and the Sheikh had accepted a small amendment in Article 6 (c) , namely the insertion of the word 'production' before 'records'. ihe Company had now telegraphed to Koweit accepting one Sheikh’s terms in full and had received a reply that tne Sheikh desired to sign the concession as soon as possible but that he would require an assurance from the Political Agent that H.M.Gr. approved —documcirts.

The Resident had accordingly been instructed to go himself to Koweit to interview the Sheikh, but owing to s^7 ^m^u G— /Ui. Kt^GIa. \AA~Qi Colonel Fowle had been unahle to do so.

A* ^ f\/y (s/aUtlZ working oil concessions, ftd that at this stage political intere-t in the matter of the Koweit oil concession was a factor which could not be ignored. The position based on the Sheikh’s treaty witTfH.M.G. and also on past practice and policy was that the Sheikh was not permitted to grant an oil concession w r ithout the approval of H.M.G. The British Government therefore had a responsibility to the public in the matter. fconBequerrtiy jthile/fher'e was j * only^ applicant for the concession the position was quite straightforward/c 3econd oompetitor had entered the fieldfFeiore the Kuwait Oil Company had ( finally come to terms with the Sheikh, f mi-M ^c.axpas^dHro criticism if failed to take both applications into consideration,^ ^ Mr ..Stevens suggested that the criticism referred to Cy»-&lt; IxxrVL *f 0-4^ ' would be criticism of thefSiiH^i element in the Kuwait Cil Company.

Mr. Laithwaite and Mr. Crombie were also present. ^• Mr. Stevens explained that the words ”in the first instance” in the Sheikh’s re-draft of Article 6 (a) of the Commercial Agreement regarding the appointment of the Chief Local Representative came after the word 'select” in the second sentence. The Company’s negotiators informed them that the implication of the words ay as that the Sheikh was interested only in the first appointment of the Chief Local Representative and not in his successors. Did His Majesty’s Government see any objection to the re-draft? Their position seemed safeguarded by the Political Agreement as was to some extent that of the Company. The re-draft seemed merely intended to satisfy the Sheikh’s vanity, particularly in view of the fact that the Commercial Agreement would be a published document and the Company saw no objection to it. The Sheikh seemed to realise that in practice one of the Company’s superior local employees would have to be appointed to the post of Chief Local Representative. 3. Mr. Walton said that the India Office vi gay was that Article 6 (a) was subject to the provisions of the relevant Article in the Political Agreement, which the Sheikh5./ had accepted in writing. After considerable discussion it was agreed that the position of His Majesty's Government and their right of veto on any appointment being fully safeguarded by the Political Agreement, and the provisions of the Commercial Agreement being subject to that Agreement a,nd primarily otherwise matters for the Company and the Sheikh, His Majesty's Government would not press an objection to the Company's acceptance of the Sheikh's terms regarding the Chief Local Representative on the understanding that the implication was that the Arabic words which had been translated as 'in the first instance” really meant 'on the first occasion' and not that the Sheikh would have the right to propose a candidate for Chief Local Representative on future occasions as well. Mr. Laithwaite suggested that the words should be retranslated into English to read 'on the first occasion' if the Arabic text allowed of that interpretation. Mr. Stevens agreed and promised to let the India Office have copies of cmy telegrams on this point exchanged between the Company and Koweit. He reminded the meeting that the English rendering would, under the terms of the Commercial Agreement, prevail in the event of any discrepancy between the English and Arabic te ^1.13 S • 4. it was agreed that the rest of the Sheikh's 'final points' were commercial matters for decision b^tw^en the Sheikh and the Company except the point in Article 6 (c) regarding the nationality of the London representative which did not, however, appear to be of much importance from the point of view of His Majesty's Government.3. 5. The Company intimated that they now proposed at once to inform the Sheikh that they accepted his n final points' in full, and to clinch their Agreement with him. He had informed them in writing that he would sign the con'ceesion subject to acceptance of these points. Was there any objection on the part of His Majesty’s Government to their proceeding on these lines? Mr. Walton explained to the Company’s representatives that it was for the Company to decide how to handle their own negotiations with the Sheikh but that he must make it clear that the conclusion of an agreement between the Sheikh and the Company and the approval of His Majesty’s Government to tho grant of the concession v;ere separate and distinct matters and that in view of a recent development the Company must not take for granted His Majesty’s Government’s approval of the grant of the concession to them. He reminded Mr. Stevens that, as he had informed him the day before, His Majesty’s Government had now received an application from another oil company which was under investigation and that in the light of the results of that investigation it might bo necessary for His Majesty’s Government to consider the other company s application at the same time as that of the Kuwait Oil Company and before there could be any question of granting their approval. 6 . Mr. Stevens said he inferred that this other company had throughout carried on their negotiations without the permission of His Majesty’s Government. The Kuwait Oil Company had understood that no other competitor would bo allowed to enter the field save through the appropriate channels: they had kept His Majesty’s Government informed at every/4. every point of their negotiations, which were now practically concluded and had met every requirement of His Majesty 1 s Government both over the Political and Commercial Agreement. They found it difficult to understand how there could be any question of withholding approval of the concession once its terms were agreed by both Company and Sheikh. In their view no Company other than the Kuwait Oil Company could properly be considered as being in the running for a concession. 7 , Mr. Walton explained that this was hardly the case since at a stage when no agreement had yet been reached between the Kuweit Oil Company and the Sheikh official His Majesty’s Government had received a formal/applicatiDn from another company which they were bound to investigate. He agreed with Mr. Stevens that an important consideration would be the Sheikh’s attitude to the other company and to the Kuwait Oil Company respectively, but said that he could not go any farther than this pending th- rcoalt of the enquiries v/hich were being made by his Majesty Government. ILa repeated that the Kuwait Oil Company must not take it fo-r granted that even if tney were now t agreement with the Sheikh it necessarily a.ollov.od changed circumstances that approval of their by His Majesty’s Government could be assumed. Indie Office, 13th. December 1934. 1P.%. 7734/34. Discussions with Sheikh, and with Kuwait Oil Company, “bearing on negotiations betw’een ‘Sheikh and Traders Ltdi TApril to Hovember 1954)': On 17th April 1954 the Kuwait Oil Company infoimed the India Office that they had received an intimation from their negotiators in Koweit that the Sheikh had warned them (? on 12th April) that he had received on the 11th April a telegram frcm a hundred per cent. British company asking for permission to open negotiations. 2. The Company were informed in reply that H.M.G. had no infomation that any such offer had teen made. The B.O.D. seemed unlikely to be interested, but in any event were only about 51/^ British. As the result of the discussion the Resident was however on the same day instructed by telegraph that Colonel ’’Dickson might ascertain the position as regards alleged offer oy outside company and remind Sheikh that he is not at liberty to grant any concession without the prior consent of H.M.G. As you will appreciate we should of course, in practice, apart from this, expect him to consult us before opening any negotiation”. (Telegram 17th April, Secretary of State to Political Resident No.962, P.Z.2559/54). 5. On 25rd April Colonel Dickson reported that he had read the India Office telegram practically worn fox- word to the Sheikh and had thereafter discussea it with him. No one else had been present and there had been no interpreter (Colonel Dickson is a fluent Arabic speaker). 'The Sheikh admitted that he had received a telegram/wo6/ /» x The Traders Concession offers 5 laMis on signature. J.G.L. / 22 Si 2 . telegram from London purporting to come from an all British concern. The letter had asked peimission to open negotiations and offered over 5 lakhs of rupees on his signing, as v/ell as other equally favourable x terms. He could not divulge the name of Company even to me, but would say that he had replied that he could not consider the offer unless negotiations with the Kuwait Oil Company shewed signs of breaking down altogether...The Sheikh finally assured me that he perfectly well understood that only an all- British or a 50/50 British company would be allowed by H.M.G. to compete for the Koweit oil concession'. (Political Agent Koweit to Political Resident, 24th April, C.146. P. Z. 2921/34) . 4. On the 2nd May Colonel Fowle telegraphed to the Secretary of State in a telegram repeated to Colonel Dickson, with reference to Colonel Dickson's statement reported in the preceding paragraph, that. 'Sheikh presumably understands from Dickson that he should consult us before opening any negotiations with outside companies'. (Political Resident to Secretary of State 449, dated 2nd May, P.Z. 2941/34). 5. On the 3rd May Colonel Dickson reported tnat Major Holmes (? on 2nd May) had 'expressed the opinion that the Sheikh was being pressed from an outside quarter and so had decided to force an earl^ issue with the Kuwait Oil Company. He mentioned that he had inner information that the Sheikh had received two further telegrams from the strange company, whom he suspected to be the B.O.D.' (Political Agent to Political Resident 3rd May, C.163, P.2.3301/34).k &gt; ( ZZ7 3. 6 . On 6 th June the Company informed the India Office that the Sheikh had informed their negotiators that unless the Kuwait Oil Company would accept draft Ho. 4 (being a draft unacceptable to the Canpany, unaccept able also in certain respects to H.M.G., and drawn up without instructions by the negotiators) in toto 'he does not wish to continue discussions at present, but wishes them postponed until next September or a later convenient date. Pending a renewal of discussions the Sheikh has said that he will not entertain or discuss any offers from other parties, and he wishes the negotiators to return to London to explain.. .his point of view. We (i.e. the Kuwait Oil Company) are instructing the negotiators to return. .. after writing a letter to the Sheikh agreeing to postpone discussions in accordance with his wishes on his undertaking not to negotiate with others in the meanwhile'. 7. On the 8 th June, after discussion with the India Office the Company agreed not to withdraw their negotiators without consultation with us. 8 . On the 15th June the Company stated that the Sheikh had warned the negotiators that, he could not understand why they were remaining in Koweit in view of his expressed wish that they should return home and that if they did not leave at once he would withdraw his offer of a period of grace until next September. The negotiators were thereupon authorised by the oompany uo withdraw (P.Z.4025/34). 9. On 20th June, the Political Agent Koweit was informed by Mr. Chisholm , one of the negotiators, 'that/4. ^ 'that Sheikh promised him not to receive or consider for a period of three months from 14th June offers from other parties for oil concessions'. (P.Z.4145/34). 10. On 2nd September (i.e. within the 3 months period) the Sheikh wrote his letter to Mr. Gabriel, accepting, subject to the approval of His Majesty’s Government, the draft concession put forward by Traders Limited. 11. Negotiations between the Kuwait Oil Company and the Sheikh were resumed early in October and have been proceeding actively since. The latest information received from Koweit (there has been considerable correspondence and discussion with the Sheikh) is that the points outstanding are very few indeed.. 12. Apparently later in November the Sheikh informed the Political Agent that in August an Iraqi had approached him offering terms financially and otherwise more favourable than those offered oy the P.Z.7170/34 Kuwait Oil Company. He had replied that the Company Bre.Tel. 1010 of 22/Ll. must first approach His Majesty’s Government and secure their approval. J.G.L. 29.11.34INDIA OFFICE. ^FIDKNTIAL P.Z.7733 / 34.

After discussion with Mr. Wakely, Mr. Walton and I saw Mr. Hunting and Lieutenant-Colonel Bovill, representing Traders, Limited, on 28th November. 2* Mr. Hunting at the opening of the meeting produced an official letter of 28th November from Traders Limited to the Secretary of State for India intimating that the Sheikh of Koweit had declared his readiness to grant an oil concession to Traders Ltd., covering the whole of Koweit, subject to the approval of His Majesty’s Government. The Company’s official letter enclosed a draft of the concession in the terms stated to have been accepted by the Sheikh, together with a translation by Mr. Gabriel, the Sheikh's lawyer, of an Arabic letter, stated to be the Sheikh’s autograph, from the Sheikh intimating his willingness to grant a concession to the Company, subject to the approval of His Majesty's Government. A list of the persons and companies associated with the application now put forward by Traders Limited was also enclosed. The Company's representatives were informed that the application they had put forward would clearly require consideration and that we would submit the matter. In reply2V- O £&gt; • to a question as to the period over which they had been negotiating with the Sheikh they stated that negotiations had been proceeding since last April. When reminded of the Sheikh 1 s Treaty obligations in regard to the grant of concessions and of the fact that their approach should in the first place have been made to His Majesty's Government or the political authorities concerned, they answered that had they adopted that course they would not to-day be so far advanced as they were. Mr. Hunting offered no explanation of this remark. (Presumably he may have meant that - as Lord Lloyd had alleged - Lis Majesty 1 s Government supposed attitude towards the xlnglo-Persian Oil Company made his company think that they had better try to confront us with a fait ac compli so far as possible 1 .) They were, Mr. Hunting said, well aware ohat the terms embodied in their concession were more favourable than those which had so far been offered by tho Kuwait Oil Company and they doubted if the Kuwait Oil Company were so far advanced as they might imagine.

Mr.Stevens ) Mr.Kemp ) ■^■ uwa it Oil Co. The Company’s representatives had asked for an interview in order to report the ’’final points' which the Sheikh of Koweit wished embodied in the Commercial Agreement and details of which they had now received from their representatives. 2. The points in question are attached as an appendix to this note. Mr.Stevens intimated that the Company were telegraphing to Koweit to clear up certain obscurities and that the Company’s representatives would probably ask for an interview to-morrow to discuss these matters further if a reply had been received by then. On the commercial side the Sheikh had now made it quite clear that he insisted on the 'won and saved' basis. The other points involved were of relatively minor importance. So far as the Government is concerned the Company were anxious to know whether in the interest of closing the negotiations the Government would be prepared to accept the modification now proposed in the article dealing with the appointment of the Chief Local Representative. Mr.Stevens was informed that this question would be further considered. 3. Mr.Stevens then enquired whether in the event of the Company deciding to adjourn negotiations in the hope of bringing the Sheikh to a more reasonable/reasonable frame of mind they could be sure that no other competitor would be allowed to enter the lists. Could we confirm that no application had in fact been received from any other competitor ? 4. Mr.Walt on replied that an application had in fact now been received. He was not in a position to make any statement regarding it, since we were not ourselves at this stage fully informed of the position in regard to the applicants and the negotiations in which they had been engaged. We were waiting for confirmation or otherwise from the Sheikh of information given us by the applicant. If, when the points which were still in obscurity had been cleared up, it was necessary to entertain the application, the Kuwait Oil Company would of course at once be informed. 5. Mr. Stevens expressed concern at the news tha.t another applicant was in the field and asked a number of questions which suggested that he had some knowledge both of the fact that an all British company had applied,that the B.O.D.might be interested ,and that Parliamentary pressure might be brought to bear in favour oi an all British company as against a Company which, like the Kuwait Oil Company, was 50^ American. He enquired in particular whether, in the event of the applicant proving to represent a substantial business such as would have to be considered by H.M.G. , the nationality question assuming that the terms offered by the competing company and the Kuwait Oil Company were in other respects identical, would make any difference to the attitude of H.M.G. He was informed in reply that it was impossible to deal with the question hypothetically, and before we receive the information for which we are waiting. Hut that nationality was one of the various questions which H.M.G. would have to take into account in dealing with any application which they had to consider and that it was impossible to say more than that. Mr. Stevens might, however, be sure that full and fair consideration would'be given to all parties concerned# 6 # Mr•Stevens said that there had been during his association with the Kuwait Oil Company considerable 'Parliamentary criticism oi the fact that American interests had been allowed to establish themselves in the Persian Gulf. Would that make any difference to the attitude of the Government? Mr.walton replied that it was obvious that a democratic government cannot altogether ignore criticism, whether ill-founded or not. Mr.Stevens finally enquired whether, if the Company were prepared to meet the Sheikh on all outstanding points and the Sheikh were in consequence to sign the concession on Monday, His Majesty*s Government would be prepared to grant their approval, or whether they would hold up approval pending investigation of the application put forward by the new competitor. He was informed in reply that we could not say; an answer which he received with some concern. 7. In conclusion, Mr. Stevens was informed that as we did not yet know where we stood in regard to the new applicant we should have preferred to say nothing t.o him at this stage. He had b een given this information only because he had specifically asked for it, and on the understanding that it would be regarded as entirely coni iuential ano. should not be repeated to the Persian Gulf* He said that he agreed as to this, but was anxious to o e allowed to mention it to Mr.Eraser as representing the A.P.O.C. share in the Kuwait Oil Company. He was informed that he might do Mi is, but on the same understanding. It would do nothing hu.o harm if this information were to b ecome generally known at the present stage. Once we knew where we stood in regard uo the new application we would then be able to tell him something officially.4. Later* Mr.Eraser telephoned and asked what the effect would he If his Company did, what they ordinarily might do m a case of commercial competition, viz: clinch with the Sheikh as soon as possible. Mr.Walton said he did not thlnK 11 W0Uld be ° f advant age to anybody to rush matters with the Sheikh, since if our enquiries show that the other competitor's application has to be taken seriously, we should in any case have to consider his proposition in conjunction with that of the Kuwait Oil Company.

Subject:- ”011'. Since my return from leave last month, I have been quietly trying to find out something about the intrigues of a strange Oil concern or Company, inimical to the Kuwait Oil Company, which (and I say this guardedly at present) as far as I can wmlzo out has been operating from BASRA during the past oumner, and continues to be active. 2. If you recollect in my Confidential express Letter No.C-146, dated the 24th April 1934 anc 1 paragraph 6 ( 0 ), I mentioned the fact that the haikh had received a telegram from a rival Oil ooxicern which at the time was thought to have come from the Company by Holmes and Chisholm. ^Tie purport of that telegram was that the strange Company ^ offered to the Shaikh to go one better in every respect than the Kuwait Oil Company, and was obviously sent with a view to prevent the Shaikh coming to a favourable decision with the Kuwait Oil Company (as it was thought he would). 3. ^he Shaikh, as you know, admitted at the time to me that he had received the telegram in question, and said that it purported to come from an all British Concern, but he would not tell me the name. . 4 . I believe later enquiries from London satisfied Holmes and Chisholm that the B.O.D. hao nothing to do ^vitb the telegram, nor were the I*P.G. suspected. 1 myself came to the conclusion that it had probably been sent at the instigation of the shaikh himself in a rather childish/ The Hon'bla Lt.-Colonel T.C.Yowle, C.B.IS.,^ Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, BUSKERS. ■ ychildish attempt to try and force the Kuwait Oil Company to bid higher than they wore doing. 5. I believe I have now got cn the track of the senders of the telegram, but of course I say this with the greetect reserve -a-t present, seeing that my svidenco is only of a circumstantial nature at present. It was hesars: Frank . trick &amp; Co#, of Basra (and London), working t rough their Lawyer in Easre, K.3. Mirza kohamed, C.I.2#, 6. 1 have sIbo practically proved that friend Kirza Mohamad is in suorat partnership ith \ r#Gabriel, the ihaikh’s lawyer (thereby also hangs a tale whore the Shaikh*s date gardene are concerned), and that before I returned from England the fonaer sent Mr#Gabriel on 20th August last to uwait, to see the Lhaikh. Mr# Gabriel was armed with a oomplcitely drawn up and printed Oil Agreement in which he offered the haikh every single thing he wanted including money, royalty, director, Chief ooal Representative etc., etc. The firures of course being better in every respect than those offered by the Kuwait Oil Company# 7. B’he haikh was, I understand, very gratified that another Company had come forward to bid against the Kuwait Oil Company, but viien he was asked to sign, his native caution came to his aid and he said Lo, and told Gabriel that the Company he represented must first go to His Majesty*© Qovortvaent in London, be ’vetted ana then come back with His Majesty’s Governments blessing. 8# The haiich himself and ’’quite off his own bat f after pledging me to secrecy, told me the story ana sain that the completely drawn up concession had been brought hlmfFraq and by an Iraq 1,Tthat he had been pressed hard to sign. He declined to say hafferer who the person was who brought the papers to him, nor would he divulge the none of the Company# L I have not of course discussed a word of the- 3 - of the Eweit oil company, but fra* one or two remarks which the '’ormer has pacsed X should not be surprised If he was not himself well an the track of the enemy. 10. One thing X have gathered, and that is that Holmes and Chisholm are not working as smoothly as they should be these days. The reason may be (and I only suggest this, mind you; that holmes has found out about the rival concern, ano puts down the whole business to plot on the part of the A./’.O.C. to 'double cross' the Kuwait Oil Company, and may also fuel that Chisholm ie not as ignorant of the business as he pretends to be. 11. The following facts ere significant, I think: (a) *.. trick &amp; Co., are connected ’fith the A.P.O.C. and receive an annuel s rx of money from the latter for 'good will' etc. (b) Mirza r .chained is legal adviser to the A.P.O.C. Ltd. and ie also lawyer to ^.Ctrick k Co. (o) : irza Mohamad end I'r.Gabriel are partners in the crime firm, though the world believes the latter to be working with a Turk named Artoen iffendi. (d) Mirza Mohamad recently became an Iraq subject. 12. Is it beyond the bounds of possibility that the A.P.O.C. smarting under the fact that they were unable themselves to get an Oil Concession out of the &gt; haikh because of the jjxterieans, for appearances sake leagued thejasolves with these selfsame Americans, and while outwardly agreeing to work with them under the name T uwait Oil Company secretly set themselves the task of hindering progress from the stf rt with the deliberate intention of preventing the ; haikh from giving the Oil Concession to the Kuwait Oil Company, and at the psychological moment and when negotiations with the Kuwait Oil Company had reached a deadlock they had ready &gt;11 - 4 - rea&lt; * rv i evt and secrot subsidiary coapany to throw Into the breach, and so walk off *ith th© prize* This Company, of ooureo, would in no way be connected with the /**P*C,C., as r &amp;r as the world was concerned, it would b© till British, and be re d stored in London and Iraq, 15, i ^ra wher also that *;irza Mohamad and ? r, Gabriel are already directorc in the new concern, 14, I send you th© above for what it is worth and I hop© you will not think my su&amp;restion about the A,P,0,C, boin&amp; behind £ trick too fantastic or unfair.

XXX 2974 * / 0Ur telegram datei 13th December,1221. We agree that point discussed in your para. 2 (d)is only one of direct importance to H.M.G. After full discussion with Company we are however of opinion that as reference to this point in Commercial Agreement is subject to the overriding provisions oi Political Agreement and is of concern primarily to Company we need not press objection to revised wording and have so informed them. The position of H.M.G. is in our view fully safeguarded by Article 4 of Political Agreement and our right of veto of any 'selection' (he has abandoned his claim to 'appoint') which the Sheikh may put forward is entirely unimpaired. Squally under clause 4 of Political Agreement Chief Local Representative would have to be found from among principal employees of Company and will ordinarily reside in Koweit* 2o Company inform us that implication of words 'in the first instance” is understood to be 'on the first occasion'. I understand that Company now propose to authorise negotiators to accept all 'final points'. They have been warned i-hat signature by Sheikh does not necessarily involve approval of H.M.G.because we. have now received official application from competitors which may need consideration and about which no statement can be made at the moment. They have undertaken to treat this information as strictly confidential. I have some reason to think that they have independent confirmation of it.As the intervention of Traders Ltd. creates a situation which may require consideration it cannot now be assumed, either by the Kuwait Oil Company or by tho Sheikh, that approval of H.M.G. will necessarily follow when once they have agreed between themselves on term3 c * 4 concession, even though such agreement v: signed. It is of course unnecessary for Dickson to mention hypothetical contingencies to Sheikh but it •’■eemr. possible that the latter might assume from previous history of the negotiations that he has already the approval of H.M.G. to grant a concession to the Kuwait Oil company. True position is of course that the grant of any concession is subject to the expressed approval of H.M.G. Dickson should therefore ensure that Sheikh clearly 'understands that his signature of any concession should be accompanied by a written proviso that it is subject to the approval ofUnder Secretary of state, xlease see the record of a meeting at the witn tile Kuwait All fvim uie Kuwait oil ooiapany on i^th December ,.uai is seii-explanatory. it « U i nav6 p „ rtrabu tafl It teen pssalble to a»oia ^ .t«« Mnt to ffie compony stout tho wllctlon Iim Iraoers U 4 . aut it saomed topossttlo to ao tois In face or tlielr Ulrsct question and or tto previous discussions Ulcl, nave taKen place between us as to the exiataiw n r wit, dxi 0 x,enc6 of other competitors. ihere seemeu little doubt, moreover, as the conversation proceeded that the Company were not in the dark as to | wh.*c was going on. The statements made were, of course, non-cocmlttal in the extreme, the danger of exposing ourselves to the charge that we were assisting an Anglo- Amerlcan combine against a purely British company being iully realised. The 'i'lnal points* introduced in the draft are ali of them commercial points, save one affecting the position oi the Chief Local Hepresentatlve. At a further interview to-day the Company stated that they had ascertained from Koweit that the.revise of clause 6(a) of the draft agreement which the sheikh was anxious to secure would run as follows:- 'The Company shall maintain in the region of the Persian Gulf a Chief Local Representative to represent it in matters relating to this agreement with the sheikh. The sheikh has the right to select in the first instance tne chief Local Representative in consultation with His Majesty’s Government'; ana that the implication of the words 'in the first Instance* was 'on the first occasion'. They undertook to confirm this in writing, and If the Arabic phrase woulu stand translation/translation equally well as *on tiie first occasion- to iiistruct tneir representatives to use that phrasing. After considerable discussion, having regard to the full safeguards for toe position of H.M.G. embodied in clause 4 of- the Political Agreement, the official representatives xelt that it was hardly worth standing out on this point and informed toe company that they were prepared to abandon it. 3. Cie Company then Intimated tout they proposed t accept toe sheikh’s -final points- In full and to Instruct their negotiators to clinch the agreement. They were informed In substance that we were not concemea with their handling of their own coiuuercial negotiations, but that they must understand that bich- .ture by tne sheikh ana toe approval of H.M.G. were two different tnings ana that it might be necessary for H.L.G. to proceed with consideration of tneapplication which had been officially submitted to them by other interests and of toe existence of which toe company had been informed yesterday, before deciding whether their approval could be given. 4. we may hope In the immediate future to have further information from colonel Dickson as to toe position of the sheikh vis-a-vis Traders Ltd., but it seems better to warn the Political Resident at once of the latest developments and In particular to emphasise that H.ii.G.'s approval to any agreement which toe Kuwait Cil company may now secure from toe sheikh is not to be taken/' P.Z.7591/34. INDIA OFFTm. CONFIDENTTaT.. U-L' n y ' Note of telephone conversation with Lord Lloyd on 12 th December 1934 . Lora Lloyd rang me up to-day and said that ne naa Deen tninking over the Gulf oil position further ana tnat he felt that all the information that reached him tended to show that things were going from bad to worse and that there was a real danger of the Americans estaolishing themselves in Koweit. He had, as I knew, most reluctantly refrained over what was now a long period from ventilating this question in Parliament, but ne dia not feel that he could ao so any longer and he thought he might find it necessary to put down a question in tne House of Lords before Christmas. I said that this must, of course, be a matter entirely for his decision. 3o far as I was aware there had been no recent material change in the situation. Lord Lloyd then enquired whether we could give him, any understanding that, if he aia not press the ' ttur in parliament at this stage, no final decision ^oula be taken in the Gulf. I said that, as I had warned him before, these commercial negotiations, which had been proceeding for a very long time, haa reached a very advanced stage, and that, while it was not for me to say, i thought it was impossible to give any such guarantee. Lord Lloyd expressed great regret at this, hut asked that we should bear his point in mind ana give it consideration. J.G.

On the other hand, many of Hunting's other companies oommnd considerable resources. 2. On receipt of this information. I advised my colleagues to make the most careful enquiries to check, from various points of view,any report which they might eventually supply to us. This they have done and I append —^ aQ extract from their report. notice, however, in the enclosure to your letter under reply, the statement that Lord Grlenconner and Messrs. Charles Tennant, Sons &amp; Co.Ltd. appear to be J.G.Laithwaite Esq.,-a- be associated with Mr.Huntim? in t hi = 8 ln ^is project. How Charles Tennant, Sons &amp; Co t+a * ^o.Itd. are an entirety re spectable fir m 0 f merchants dealing ■ dealing in minerals and chemicals, hat i 0 rd denconner himself. we know from a private and absolutely reliable eource, i 8 reg arded by hrs other partners as being rather a wild young gentleman and. in the words of one of his partners 'he recently went for a trip abroad and seemed to have picked up half the crooks in Europe?*.' while one must 1 not take a statement of this sort too seriously - as it was probably made partly in jest - it is unfortunate ly true that His lordship has been approached by at least one individual of whom mo v,„„„ wnom we have the most unfavourable reports, namely. F.w.Rickett. It would however, be undesirable for you, or anybody dealing with Mr.Hunting. openly to question him about this man as Riokett himself knows that he is being watched and has already made one complaint aoout official persecution. I mentioned the fact simply to indicate 'where the nigger in the wood pile is likely to exist' - if there is such a nigger. It is also possible that Hunting himself might mention the name of the man spontaneously For the rest, the only inference which we are disposed ...disposed to draw from the facts at present before us is that whoever has to grant this concession, or to support it, would do well to ascertain in greater detail the precise financial plans of Mr.Hunting, since obviously it is unreasonable for him to expect His Majesty's Government to support a tiny company with only £ 1,000 in shares for the purpose of a large enter prise of this nature. It rests, therefore, with him to satisfy you not only that he deliberately intends to float a company with adequate capital, but also that h .6 will have no cl iff ioulliy in ohfcoi ning Treasury sanction for the necessary public issue.

The position Is that the India Office has been negotiating for a considerable period with the Koweit Oil Company, representing the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Gulf oil Company of Pennsylvania in equal shares, for the exploitation of an oil concession in the territory of the [Sheikh. An a^ree. ;.ent ms arrived at last March between the Koweit oil Company and His Majesty’s Government regarding the political conditions to be observed. Since then the representatives of the Company have been negotiating a commercial agreement with the Sheikh and we understand that they are on the point of reaching an agreement with him. We now find that while these affairs were in / cir Henry ctrakosch, 95 &gt; Gresham Street, X.C.2.returned to the Uheihh for dlepoeai'to another Conpany. ith apologies for troubling you with this aatter. Yours sincerely,(ztz) corppaniss ana inaividuals whose names are given in Appenaix A to their application are associated with them, a. HQ have asked the Department of Overseas Trade in the letter of which a copy l s attached, to make enquiries about the financial standing of this company and its associates. The secretary of state has approved a suggestion that sir Henry Strakosch should also be asked if he would be good enough to advise, and we should be ^rateful if he would do so. I attach a note giving such particulars as are available about fcir. Hunting and his associates. 4 - As will he seen from the draft concession, i..r. Hunting and his friends are prepared to enter into an engagement to pay a minimum royalty of Rs.500,000 per they intend to develop the concession, they would presumably have to enter into very considerable capital expenditure in connection with the necessary drilling, exploration, construction of houses, workings, offices, etc. it seems nrirm opin to r ^ ” -- -- - associates t are good for the capital involved^, we should, however, greatly appreciate any information which sir Henry Strakosch could confidentially obtain for us as to (a) the financial standing of Mr. Hunting and of the companies and persons associated with his application, ^ having regard to the obligations which would be undertaken by Traders Ltd. under the draft concession, if they obtained it; (b) the extent of the connection of Mr. Hunting and the companies and individuals referred to in (a) with the/the oil business - it is clearly of much importance from our point of view that we should know their ^ 13113111638 01 this type of the A.F.O.C. and the Gulf oil of Pennsylvania. (c) (oO far as possible) the extent to which n L) * Qr ,^^ Iikely to ilave » any^riou^ interest^ It will be seen that Article 27 of the draft concession provides that they may transfer or assign their interest in certain circumstances, and it may be that they are merely anxious to secure the concession v\iuh a view to its transfer to some other company or companies.

CONFIDENTIAL. , A CONVERSATION WITH LORD LLOYD QN LBN DAY. .. 3rd DECEIVBEF . 1Q54. KQWEIT PIT,. Lord Lloyd rang me up this morning to say that Lr. Hunting haci comie to see him and told him that he had been kindly received hy the India Office, with whom he had left a copy of his concession. He was, however, apprehensive lest the sheikh should get into trouble for what he had done and perhaps he so frightened as to repudiate his agreement altogether. Lord Lloyd wished to pass this on and said that he trusted we would not he too hard on the sheikh. He repeated that he had no personal interest In Mr. Hunting and Traders Ltd., and said that he had never heard of them until they had come to see him as the result of his speech about oil at the Central Asian Dinner in October. His sole anxiety was to lend support to British interests and try to redress the injury which had been done by allowing American interests to establish themselves in the Persian Gulf. 2. I said that Lord Lloyd would appreciate that we must, of course, ascertain from the sheikh whether in fact he had written the letter produced by Mr. Hunting, and on the general position and the question of our attitude towards the sheikh he would ttgree that it might have been very awkward if the sheikh had, without approval, given a concession, e.g., to wholly American Interests/— I - 2 - f interests, we were investigating Mr. Hunting's application. But there must clearly be some little aelay because we would nave to refer the matter to the Gulf, ana to make enquiries about their position, as to wmch we haa no inaepenaent information, ana also examine their proposals. Haa Lora Lloya noticed the Bntisn control provision^ in their araft concession? If he would look at it he would fina that it was very loosely expressed inaeed ana seemed to affora no substantial safeguard, on another point, we had omitted to ask Mr. Hunting whether, if he secured the concession, he would work it himself, or merely paS s it on. Could Lord Lloyd throw ary light on this? 3. Lord Lloyd said that he had not in fact looked at the concession at all closely. He had merely teen anxious to put Traders Ltd. in touch with the appropriate authority ana uo what he coula to forward what he believed to he a British project. But it woula, of course, he essential for H.M.G. fully to safeguard British interests ana to tighten up any doubtful clauses as might he necessary. It was, of course, the business oi the Departments to check the details of the concession. As regards tne working of the concession ne understood that Mr. Hunting was contemplating working it himself if he got it, hut he really knew very little about him or his plans. As regards tne standing of tne Company, be had been impressed by the names attached to his application. Some of those names appeared to be persons of substance. I said that on the face of it this certainly seemed to be so, and that they seemed to be largely concerned with the B.O.D., which, as Lord Lloyd was aware, was now less than 50% British, but that we would/3 woula, of course, examine this aspect of tne natter xully. m conclusion Lora Lloya again begged that, as it was a British ana not an American interest wmcn appeared to nave secured this unaertaking from tne Sheikn, we snoula not oe too haru on His Excellency icr anything he had aone, and I said we would take note of what he had said and that we would of course give the closest consideration to the proposals of Traders Ltd.

It is unnecessary to go into the detail of the discussions* Suffice it to say that very strong pressure was brought to bear on the Foreign Office by the American oil Interests (and by Mr. Mellon) in favour of an open door policy; the Cabinet reluctantly decioed on 9th April 1932 to agree to an open aoor policy; and the American Government were so informed.

At the ( end of 1933 the competing companies combined on a 50/50 basis and established a new company, known as the Kuwait Oil Company, in which the A.P.O.C ana the Gulf Oil^had equal interests, to negotiate with: the Sheikh. From the point ol view of H.M.G. this was not unsatisfactory, since it secured as a minimum a 50?5 British interest and degree of control in the operation of the Koweit oil concession. Further, as a preliminary to their commercial negotiations with the Sheikh, the Kuwait Gil Company concluded what was known as a ■political agreement.' of a confidential character with H.M.G., which embodied substantial safeguards for British strategic and political interests in the area of the concession; and secured that there should be no assignment of the Company*s rights save with the ■ approval of H.M.G.

He was separately warned in April last that H.M.G. expected that he would not entertain any overtures from outside negotiators etc. without prior consultation with them. Tne latest indications (November 1934) were that negotiations between the sheikh and the Kuwait oil Company were on the point of a successful conclul - the company having made a variety of concessions to the sheikh. On 19th November Lord Lloyd privately infoi^ the Foreign Office that he understood that the sheikh haa granted a concession to a British company known as • Traders, Limited; expressed the hope that we would lend them our fullest support, and intimated that in the interests of maintaining the British position in the Persian Gulf, which was in his view gravely threatened 'by the weakness of the Government In agreeing to the admission of American oil concessionnaires, he might feel bound to raise the matter in Parliament in the near future. The Political Resident was at once asked whether there was any foundation for the suggestion that a concession had been given by the sheikh. Almost simultaneously the P.A. Koweit reported that the sheikh had informed him that he had received overtures, through an Iraqi, in August last from an unnamed company that he had replied to the intermedJary that the would-be concessionnaires must first approach ' H.M.G. and secure their approval. 6 . Lord Lloyd again raised the matter with the i Foreign Office on 27th November (see record of conversations on P.Z. He was informed that-4- we had no confinriation of his story, whereupon he offered to put Traders, Limited in touch with the India Office. Representatives of the Company attended here yesterday and produced a rs&amp;'fctif-isd translation ^ tL ■ of an alleged autograph letter hy the sheikh in which he agrees to grant a concession (a draft of which is also attached) to Traders, Ltd., 'subject to the approval of H.M.G*' The Company stated that negotiations with the sheikh have been proceeding since last April, and the Sheikh's letter is dated 2nd LLJL.

In other words, the* fare quite possibly a worse b usine ss proposition, and politically rather worse gMour^djoto^^uJIu^lt oil compan*. 9. The Company might reply that they will willingly meet us on all the above points If they were to do so, and if the result of the confidential enquiries which we are making into their financial stability is satisfactory, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to refuse to allow their application to be considered, pari passu with that of the Kuwait Oil Company, despite the impropriety of the Company's action/action and tlae advanced stage of the Kuwait Oil Company’s negotiations. If on the other hand they refuse to give us the political safeguards which we have secured from the Kuwait Company; if they prove to be financially unsound; or if they refuse to give a guarantee about-the assignment of their rights to non- British interests, it might conceivably be possible to inform them out of hand that we cannot approve their application, and difficulty should not be experienced in Parliament in defending such a decision. The first thing is to find out what the sheikh has done and we can then ask Traders Ltd. for guarantees etc. The position is a very delicate one. we must, on the one hand, avoid any suggestion that we are discriminating against a company which is professedly British and which is prepared to offer better terms to the shaikh than its Anglo-American competitors. Dais is especially important as the Foreign office, who are very uneasy at the thought that Lord Lloyd may pillory them for their past deference to America, would gladly see responsibility company„ and they have shewn tiiieiris 0 g/V -7- Minute Paper.

K the sheikh were by any chance to grant them the concession in the next few aays that might get us out of our difficulties, though we should probably be criticised^ approv&amp; it in advance of consideration of the Traders' project. Unfortunately the indications are that the Sheikh is playing lor time; and he will no doubt hear indirectly that Traders, Ltd. have now formally submitted their concession for consideration to the India Office. While we cannot finally decide whether we must necessarily allow Traders Ltd. to compete with, the Kuwait oil Company until the points examined in paragraphs 8-9 have been cleared up, we cannot refuse to consider their application, and that may tak time, subject to any explanation which the Political Resident may be able to secure from the sheikh of his action, it seems desirable in these circumstances to let the Kuwait Oil Company know in the immediate future that we have now received a formal application from a competitor and that we feel that we have no option but to admit this to consideration. The communication to the Kuwait Oil Company would, of course, be in the most general terms and would not enter into any detail. Biey will feel that they have been badly used; but that cannot unfortunately be helped. (c) H.M.G. AND THS SHEIKH . 11. There seems little question that the Sheikh has behaved very badly indeed. It may be that we made a mistake in 1932 in allowing him to choose between the '• &lt;v7 , competitors/competitors witix wbom tie was tHen aealing, out, as wiU te seen from tiie papers at A, ha was^jfon.gly warned at the stage when Traders Ltd.^ entered into negotiation with him that H.M.G. expected to he consulted before he entertained overtures from elsewhere. Apart from that, he gave a formal guarantee to the Kuwait Oil Company in June that he would not enter into negotiation for a period of 3 months. It now lookamvery much as though his anxiety to get rid of the Kuwait Oil Company last June was so that he might complete his discussions with Traders Ltd. and it is significant that his letter indicating that he is prepared to a concession /troit-tiawir was signed on the 2nd September - in other words, before the period of 3 months during which ne undertook: not to deal with other possible competitors, had expired. xf the sheikh confirms what Traders Ltd. havs told us it will he difficult to avoid taking a strong line with him. What has happened will he conmon talk throughout the Gulf and we may well find ourselves at the next stage faced hy a grant hy the Sheikh of C^itar to the standard Oil or some other wholly American Company of an oil concession in respect of his State which would he politically most embarrassing Apart from that, the fact that we have been outwitted, for practical purposes, hy the sheikh cannot redound to our credit locally. Nor, finally, given trie dependence of Koweit on H.M.G. and our special treaty relations, is it satisfactory that the Sheikh though admittedly he has legitimate grievances against us overhis date gardens and, to a lesser extent, over our failure (for which he is himself partly responsible) to secure the removal of Ibn Saud 1 s blockade/v Minute Paper. blockade of Koweit), should have behaved as he has done, we had better, however, consult the Government of India and the Political Resident as to the steps to be taken in dealing with him. priiria facie , there is much to be said for conveying to him an intimation of the severe displeasure of H.M.G. and the fact that our support would be removed from him and possibly, even, that the question of succession may have to be considered^if there is any similar incident in the future. Secondly, for instructing him that the free hand which he has hitherto had to negotiate on oil questions is withdrawn; thirdly, for putting into effect the provisional decisions about the Koweit raid claims and his direct correspondence with Ibn Saud which we have hitherto postponed implementing; far ' and fourthly,(In future InterpreVour treaty engagements^ in a strict sense and 'tigtiten dur control over Koweit. The main difficulty about withdrawing the Sheikh's liberty of choice between competing alternatives is that if we had to recommend him to take a decision in favour of Traders Ltd. it would saddle us with the hostility both of the Americans and of the A.P.O.C., while in the contrary event we * /„ a. ^ should he attacked in parliament as favouring American as against British interests. But it may he necessary in the long run to face this dilemma; if we can establish satisfactorily that our decision is right on the merits the position woulu he less difficult. I do strongly feel that the local reactions of allowing the Sheikh to escape with no more than a warning will he very unfortunate, ana in particular may upset our plans for keeping the Americans/- 10 - Americans out of Q,atar. 13. I am not quite sure that we have been very well served locally in Koweit, and the India Office an the Political Department in the Gulf may he exposed to criticism both from the Kuwait oil Company and possibly from other Departments as the result of our failure to ^discover that these negotiations had been proceeding for the last six months. It is the more surprising as Colonel Dickson is understood to be in very close touch and with the Sheikh/is a fluent Arabic speaker, who has held the Agency for some time. It may be that most of the harm was done during the Political Agent's absence on leave during this summer when the Agency was occupied ' a Pollt,ica l Officer (Major Watts) with little knowledge of Arabic, who for some weeks was absent at Shiraz, it is perhaps for consideration whether we might not mention this question of staff to the Viceroy privately?

The Americans’ purse was much longer, and there is little doubt that they could have outbid the Anglo-Persian. Consequently, when the two companies at the end of 1933 joined forces on a 50-50 basis, we welcomed this ! development. No other competitor, British or otherwise, came forward. Representatives of the Anglo-Persian and of the American grtfap have been in continuous consultation with us throughout this year in settling the political conditions, the procedure for dealing with the Sheikh, and the of the commercial concession; the Koweit Oil Coy. was formed, the political agreement with H.M.G. was signed at the 1.0. on 5th March last (copy attached), and the Coy. sent its representatives to Koweit to negotiate the commercial agreement; those negotiations have been proceeding, with a break during the summer,' various difficulties with the Sheikh have been cleared out of the way with our assistance, and our information during the last few days has oeen that an agreement was on the point of being reached. I it is clear that the new group (whatever their standing may be) haer behaved badly in going behind oar backs to the Sheikh without giving as any information that they were in the field, althoa# they knew of the progress of the negotiations of the Koweit oil Coy. They have in fact deliberately attempted to force oar hand by confronting as with a faoi accpPipLl- This behaviour does not aagar well for their being a satisfactory concessionaire from the point of view of H.M.G. According/&gt; S' 3, According to Lord Lloyd, the present applicants are 100% British. Mr. Hunting in his letter does not definitely state this, bat merely that 'Traders Ltd.', th rf- actaal applicants, are 'a company art* bntish invested capital' entirely owned and controlled by Messrs. Hunting and Son, Ltd., and their associated companies. If, however, we assume that the capital of Messrs. Hunting and ^ 'Ckx*, yo their associated companies is 100% British owned and controlled, it is important to note that the nationality of the original concessionaire^ carries by itself absolutely no guarantee that the concession will remain under British control. It is quite a usual course for a concessionaire immediately to transfer his concession to other hands, and indeed the original applicants may be, and vei&gt; frequently are, mere concession- hunters. A clause restricting transfer^ is the only method of providing for British control of the concession. Clause 27 of Mr. Hunting’s draft provides merely that at least 50% of the invested capital of a transferee company must be British/. Tne Koweit Oil Coy. starts by being only 50% British, but we have an absolute guarantee against any transferee company being directly or indirectly controlled by persons other than British subjects as regards more than 50% of its capital and voting power (see Art. 2 of the agreement of 5th March). W© must not, therefore, necessarily regard the present applicants as more acceptable on grounds of nationality- 4 t, A further point of great importance is that we should be very sure that Mr. Hunting’s financial backing is such that there is a reasonable prospect of thi concessionaire being able to pay the very large sums contemplated/ MiMinute Paper. Department. ■A contemplated in the draft concession; the dead rent alone postulates a capital in the neighbourhood of a, 000 , 000 ; the cost of exploiting the concession and the other financial inducements which the draft pu.poros to offer to the Sheikh would demand a further large capital. The compan^|who Hunting says,are interested might perhaps have no difficulty in putting up ohis capital, but the question remains whether they are likely to continue for long to consider it worth while. The concession may he terminated by the concessionaire any time after three years. It would be of no advantage to the Sheikh if, instead of giving the j concession to the Koweit Oil Coy., who^we have reason to j believe, mean business, he obtained three years’ dead rent ; from Traders Ltd., and then had the concession returned i to him without any attempt to exploit it. It is true that he would still have the concession intact, but there m i ght by then be no market for it. j This brings us to the point that in weighing ! the merits of competitors, we are justified in | considering not only their financial backing, but their I experience and refutation m the oil world. If the sponsors of the present applicants have little previous connection with the oil busines (or if they are connected with the B.O.D., which I understand has a reputation for inefficiency and instability), this is a factor which must tell heavily against them as compared with the great experience and qualifications of the Anglo-Persian anu the Gulf Oil Coy. The latter, of course, also have enormous reserves, so that there can be no question of their ability to carry out the terms of any concession kthey obtain for the whole period of its duration. The local knowledge and experience of the Anglo-Persian is also a factor to be taken into consideration. It means that in all probability, if the Koweit Oil Coy. get the concession, it will be the British partner m that Coy. which will mainly inspire its policy, direct its management and supply its local personnel. These points are of obvious importance for safeguarding our political interests. C. if “British Traders” have behaved ill, it appears from their account of what has happened that the Sheikh has, from our point of view, behaved even worse. The first step we have to take is to check their account by his and see whether he has any explanation. It is possible that the original nrabic text of his letter of 2 r September may differ in material respects from the translation supplied by his lawyer, Gabriel, who has been evidently acting as the agent of Traders Ltd. Conceivably by some turns of phrase the translation may appear to commit him more deeply than the original text actually did. d 7 . While we are obtaining the Sheikh’s explanation, we can simultaneously take steps to investigate the financial backing and the general standing of Traders Ltd, 7/e have already written to the D.O.T. (Mr. Laithwaite’s letter of 28th November). Their information may be mainly useful m regard to the commercial bona fides of T r. Hunting. Perhaps we could obtain independently (through Sir C.

Hunting’s application is not to be taken too seriously. On the other hand, they may ^ now that there is at any rate a prima facie case for examining his application. In that case, and after receiving a report from the Political Resident, we should have to examine the draft concession m detail in consultation with the Petroleum Dept., and we should at I thik stage evidently, I think, have to inform the Koweit Oil Coy. that an application, which appears to be i serious, has been received from another competitor, ana j that we have no option but to examine it. f- ^ the next step would be to enter into negotiations with to ascertain whether, on condition of being allowed to compete, they would be prepared to agree to our political conditions and safeguard^. At this stage we should require^to be satisfied as to the exact extent to which they are British controlled, and would of course require a guarantee that the concession, if grantee to them, would not pass outside British control. u, if British Traders were then able to satisfy all our requirements, we could allow them to enter the auction, but it is clear that the Koweit Oil Coy. would still be in the running and should have an opportunity of capping any terms offered by British ; Traders. This would presumably be the procedure, on } the assunrotion that the merits of the two companies were 40(10 3 32 'in the aggregate evenly balanced, taking everything into account, i.e., financial stability, commercial soundness, technical qualifications, nationality, and the safeguarding of British political interests. If,on a balance of all these and any other relevant factors the new applicants were obviously not in the same class as the Koweit Oil Coy., we might be justified in deciding in favour of the latter out of hand, without giving the Sheikh any other choice. I agree with Mr. Laithwaite that, unless the Sheikh has some adequate explanation, it will be necessary to consider what action can be taken to tighten up our control of him. I also agree that these events seem to indicate some deficiency in our present system of control in Koweit, and the desirability of ensuring that sc far as possible the political posts m the Gulf are adequately filled. This opens a general question which m4y require mature consideration. ' &gt;. '\,&gt;y / DrDraft Paper. 3. Department. T - tH /^4»' 4i-«y &lt;~X A^X k\KysJ tt^Lw. V&lt; ^ C arvA h -*-^q /I-^v^^v*^!

I should he grateful if you would look at my official telegram No. dated , to the Foreign and Political Department. Koweit Oil. You will, I think, agree that our position is most embarrassing vis-a-vis both American and A.P.0*C. constituents of Kuv/ait Oil Company, i^iile of course I appreciate the difficulties I cannot help feeling ; especially with Dicksons great local knowledge and experience, that it ought to have been possible for local political authorities to have kept closer watch on Sheikh and warned us in time of turn things were taking, though The damage may of course have been done it’ k* A+j during Dickson 1 s absence, and .11—i-s— [si X .supjK&gt;QO pooe-ib-Pe that we have let Sheikh get out of hand by showing undue tenderness to him. But I fear that we may come in for criticism here, both from oil circles and from other departments concerned on ground of failure of our intelligence \ arrangements. Question of measures to be taken with Sheikh if statements now reported are confirmed is/My dear Gilbert, I send you herewith the draft record of the conversations we had with Lord Lloyd on the afternoon u.r: ^/th November. I have, as you see, somewhat re draftee the xirst five paragraphs, and I have had your ± jl li^inai y amendments embodied in the remainder, j have also made one or two minor verbal amendments ( elsewhere. £• If you concur in this draft, I think it might now be well to circulate copies, with the necessary explanations as to the previous conversation with me to which Lord Lloyd referred and the action which we took thereon, to the Admiralty and petroleum Department for their information, it should also be explained in the covering letter, with reference to the final paragraph of/ :.ai thwai te, :;sq, ,o of the record, that, on th* ~ iie onlj occasions in the summer ’• 7ilen the ? or eign Office unofficially advised lord Lloyd against taking up the question publicly, what ‘‘ aft ln mlnd was not 30 much the Eoweit negotiations - although we were of course most anxious that the standard Oil of California should not be encouraged to enter into competition with the Koweit oil Company in Koweit - as the rcxicat-j negotiations still proceeding between the Anglo- persian Oil Company - Iraq Petroleum Company and the ohe-ikh o± Qatar *or the Qatar concession. vfhat vie told Lora Lloyd was that any premature publicity about oil questions in the Gulf might well have precisely the result which he wished to avoid, i.e. further s uiiiulatiQn 01 competition by a purely American group, and the reduction of the chances ox any concession going to tiie groups which were predominantly, or at any rate very largely British. Yours ever,kowfit oil. eonTereatione with Lord &gt;_7 WOV. Lord Lloyd rang mo up this afternoon ^ ej with reference to hie preTloue oonveraatlon with me (g o972) and asked whether i had any further information as to the oil situation In Koweit* I said that, as a result of his previous communication, we had made discreet ^nc^uiries, but had been unable to obtain any information as to any concession having been given to any British group such as he described. Lord Lloyd said this was very odd as the concession had actually been signed and he had been given a copy. Lord Lloyd admitted, however, after some further discussion, that the copy of the agreement that he had before him was undated, and that the Hunting group, though they had olearly given him to understand that it had been signed and concluded, had not categorically said so in writing* Lord Lloyd eventually said/aaifi that h« nouifi obtain further particular a aa to tha conoeaaion from ®r. Hunting and ring mb ^iu Lord i.Iojrd was anxious to £novr whether the negotiations between th« An^le- Forslan Oil Company - Cult oil group %nd the Sholkh of rows it had, made any progrosg* j sal* 1 that x believed that they were well advanced♦ c 9 Lord Lloyd also enquired whether any progress had been mnde as regards the negotiations whieh he understood were going on between Britlsn and American oil Interests in connexion with the Bahrain oil concession* He had understood that there had been a proposal on foot which might have resulted in transfer of the Bahrain concession to British interests in return for the grant to American interests of increased marketing facilities* especially in the Far fast. The American- Bahrain Oil Company had recently tried to market their oil in Japan* but had experienced difficulties. Lord Lloydwas uafl«r th« impression that the result of the negotiations might be much affected by what happened as regards the solution of these difficulties. I told Lord Lloyd in reply that this question ^a* om which was beingr dealt with entirely between the various oil interests concerned by direct negotiations carried on in their own way, and that I was therefore very much in the dark as to the situation, about which I feared X could give him no information. 4. Lord Lloyd had already explained that he would almost certainly feel it his duty to raise the whole question of our oil policy in the ^rsian Gulf in the House of Lords at an early date, as he felt v&amp;at strongly that the virtual exclusion of surely British interests from this area wao in the nature of a national disaster* 5* immediately after this conversation I asked Mr. Laithwaite to oom over, and having explained/nnlft to raist the matter in the Houee of Lords* H® had felt It hi8 duty to glee l«r. tendel the ' inforBiation reoordea In S 697E and now to raise . the matter again with a riew to aroidiag any suggestion by the cowrament* if he had to attack/attack them in public, that he had not laid all hie cards on the table and given them the fullest possible information. in hie view the Government ought to have taken steps. before allowing matters to go as far aa the/ had in Koweit, to make nuite sure that there was no British company which could be induced to interest themselves in that area* 7* Mr* Laithwaite said in reply that the information which lord Lloyd had given me had come as a complete surprise. We had no information that any negotiations had taken place between the sheikh and the group mentioned by him. ?he group in question did In fact appear to contain individuals of some substance and closely associated with the British Oil Lttelopatn* company, but if they were in fact eoiapetia&amp; as a British group, they must have known that the sheikh was bound by special arrangements to His i£&amp;jtaty v 8 government as re gar da oil, and that their proper/- proper course was to approach the Sheikh oal? through His Majesty’s Government or the proper ^plitioal authorities* 8 * As regards a further point which Lord Lloyd had raised* he was probably well aware that the KOweit oil company* which represented the fusion of Angio-persian Oil Company and American intersets* had come into being only after lengthy endeavours by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to captui'e this concession for themeelvee. ^he terms which they were in a position to offer as independent GompetltOi© appeared tc have been capped by American Interests* Mr* Laithvmite thought it was fair to say that there had really been no alternative British group to the Anglo-?ersian oil Company at any earlier stage of the negotiations# Traders Limited were now apparently coming forward as competitors on a British basis* but Lord Lloyd would/wuld appreciate in the first place that it would be necessary to oonduct close investigations into the financial standing and bona fides of an^ group which am forward. secondly, very substantial financial offers were understood to have been saade to the aheifch of Koweit by the Koveit Oil Company and it would be difficult to persuade the sheifch to acoept any less favourable offer from another company# even if its composition was British. Thirdly, negotiations between the sheikh and the t roweit Oil Company were, so far as we were aware, now at a very advanced stage indeed. 9. Lord Lloyd said that he had no personal interest in Traders Limited. He was solely concerned with Britisn prestige and British interests in the Gulf. He was supporting Traders Limited because, so far as he knew, they were British and they had asked for his help on that ground. If for any reason/r#a8on th«y had mad# an error in approaching the sheikh direct he much regretted it and could ly think that it was due to uncertainty m to the attitude of the OOTernxaent I)epartraents, who were regarded aa being active supporters of the Anglo-peraian Oil Company* But he trusted that any such error would not prejudice thi*m if they were nov? to make an official approach to His Majesty^ Government* as regards the sheikh and his interests, these could not, he thought be paramount* W« had done much for Koweit in the past, and the deciding factor in a craestion such as the present could not be whether the Sheikh would benefit to the extent of a few thousand pounds more or less: it must be British interests* He knew that we could If we wished bring strong pressure to bear on these small Persian Gulf sheikhs and make them do what we wanted* as regards the state of the negotiations between the sheikh and theKoweit oil Company* he begged ue* even if 1 it vtare nos? the eleventh hour* to lend a sympathetic ear to graders Limited if they approached lie* ^ould m be prepared to # discuss matters with them* and if so ought they to approach the Foreign office or the India Office? 10* Mr* L&amp;ithwalte said that he did not think we could entirely accept his views as to the financial position of the sheikh* It would be most difficult for us to say to the sheikh M You must break off negotiations 'with the Company with which* with the 'approval of His Majesty’s Government you have 'now been negotiating for a considerable time, 'and which has offered substantial financial 'inducements to you, and you must cotamence 'negotiations with an alternative group which 'has indeed the great advantage* fro® the 'point of view of the Gove r nine at, of being 'British, but which may not be able to give 'you the same price for your concession'*m should find it very difficult to convince the sheikh of the validity of mioh a proposition* A8 for Traders Limited* we should be prepared to discuss matters with them if they had any positive proposition to make* But they must realise that matters were now at a most advanced stage in the discussion at Kowe it * 11# if they approached the Government they should approach the India office, which, while it concerted its action in oil questions with the '©reign office, was now the department primarily responsible for oil questions in this area, in consultation with the other interested departments* IE* Lord Lloyd said that he could not say whether Traders Limited would be prepared in fact to oocamunicate with a Government department* iut he would himself at once approach the® about it, and only hoped that if, as a result, they should approach the India Office, we should deal with them sympathetically Mr, Laithwaite/...—.. nmL -- Mr* Laithwaite aaid that we should certainly give them a sympathetic hearing within the limits which he had indicated above. !$• Lord Lloyd again deplored the way in which His M&amp;jetty's Government had, according to him* capitulated to America throughout this affair. He said that one of the most deplorable and scandalous pages in the history of the business and one which would produce a very bad effect if he had to refer to it in public* was that the peak of the negotiations took place during Mr. Mellon’s tenure of the United states embassy here. He then indulged in a mild diatribe against our general substrvianoe to the united states* aad explained that his essential object was to redress the balance dn tne Persian Gulf in favour of the true Interests of this country. 14. Lord Lloyd subsequently again rang up and spoke to Mr. Laithwaite. H« said that in/In the light of the conversation he had got in touch with Traders Limited and strongly advised, them to put themselves right with the Government and get into touch with the India Office* 15• H« made the further point that he had for some time been restrained by the foreign office only with difficulty from ventilating the whole of this question* of which he took so serious a view* was it entirely fair that when he had held his peace because he was advised that it was in the best Interests of the country. Government departments should be pressing on in the Gulf with steps designed to hand the concession over to a syndicate which# even if 50,C British# aae likely In praotioe to be deoisiT* American interest* Was It too late even at this stage# when he had shown that there was a purely British group in the field# to close the negotiations down? Mr* Laithwalt© said that' s deplorable impreesion. He might even feel obliged to say that vm had begged him to hold peace and take advantage of his silence to push forward our particular polioy*-o' B* 4 3 ^ this agreement dated the tt day of One thousand nine hundred and thirty-four is made BETWEEN His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom (hereinafter called “His Majesty’s Govern ment ”) of the one part and the Kuwait Oil Company Limited (hereinafter called “the Company” which expression shall where the context so admits be deemed to include its successors and/or assignees) of the other part.

Traaers Ltd &gt; ( April to November lS!54 )J On 17th April 1934 the Kuwait Oil company informed the India Office that they had received an intimation from their negotiators in Koweit that the Sheikh had warned them (? on 12th April) that he had received on the 11th April a telegram from a hundred per cent. British company asking for permission to open negotiations. 2. The Company were informed in reply that H.M.G. had no information that any such offer had been made. The B.O.D. seemed unlikely to he interested, hut in any event were only about 51% British. As the result of the discussion the Resiaent was however on the same day instructed hy telegraph that Colonel 'Dickson might ascertain the position as regards alleged offer hy outside company and remind sheikh that he is not at liberty to grant any concession without the prior , consent of H.M.G. As you will appreciate we should, of course, in practice, apart from this, expect him to consult us before opening any negotiation'. (Telegram 17th April, s/S to P.R., NO. 962, P.Z. 2559/34). 3. On 24tS April colonel Dickson reported that he had read the I.O. telegram practically word for word to tee Sheikh and had thereafter discussed it with him. No one else had been present and there had been no interpreter (Col. Dickson is a fluent Arabic speaker). 'The sheikh admitted that he had received a telegram from London purporting to/V to come from an all British concern. The letter had asked permission to open negotiations and offered over 5 lakhs of rupees on his signing, as well as other X equally favourable terms. He could not divulge the name of Company even to me, hut would say that he had replied that he could not consider the offer unless negotiations with the Kuwait Oil Co. shewed signs of breaking down altogether...The Sheikh finally assured me that he perfectly well understood that only an all-Britisn or a 50/50 British company would he allowed by H.M.G. to compete for the Koweit oil concession'. (P.A. Koweit to P.R., 24th April, C.146. P.Z.2559/34). 4. On the 2nd May Colonel Fowle telegraphed to tiie Secretary of State in a telegram repeated to Colonel Dickson, with reference to Col. Dickson's statement reported in the preceding paragraph, that 'Sheikh presumably understands from Dickson that he should consult us before opening any negotiations with outside companies*. (P.R. to S/S. 449, dated 2nd May. P.Z. 2941/34). 5. On the 3rd May Colonel Dickson reported that Major Holmes (? on 2nd May) had 'expressed the opinion that the Sheikh was being pressed from an outside quarter and so had decided to force an early issue with, the Kuwait oil Co. He mentioned that he had inner information that the Sheikh had received two/two further telegrams from the strange company, who^he suspected to he the B.O.D.' (P.A. to P.R. 3rd toy, C.163, P.Z.3301/34). 6. On 6th June the Company Informed the 1.0. that the sheilch had informed their negotiators that unless the Kuwait Oil Co. would accept draft No.4 (being a draft unacceptable to the Company, unacceptable also in certain respects to and drawn up without instmctions by the negotiators) in toto •he does not wish to continue discussions at present, but wishes them postponed until next September or a later convenient date. Pending a renewal of discussions the Sheikh has said that he will not entertain or discuss any offers from other parties, and he wishes the negotiators to return to London to explain ...his point of view. We (i.e. the Kuwait Oil Co.) are instructing the negotiators to return.. .after writing a letter to the Sheikh agreeing to postpone discussions in his on P accoraance ^ lae wis k es k * 3 ^4 undertaking not to negotiate with others in the meanwhile'. 7. On the 8th June, after discussion with the 1.0. the Company agreed not to withdraw their negotiators without consultation with us. 8. On the 15th June the Company stated that the sheikh had warned the negotiators that he could not understand why they were remaining in Koweit in view of his33/ 4. PzijJ* r f$VL. tZ.li l*e ZZfn expressed wisti that they should return nome ana that if they did not leave at once he would withdraw his offer of a period of grace until next September. The negotiators were thereupon authorised by the Company to withdraw. (P. Z.40&amp;5/34). 9. On 20th June, the P.A. Koweit was informed by Mr. Chisholm, one of the negotiators, 'that sheilch promised him not to receive or consider for a period of three months from 14th June offers from other parties for oil concessions j 10. On 2nd September (i.e. within the 3 months period) the Sheikh wrote his letter , accepting, subject to the approval of the draft concession put forward by Traders Ltd. 11. Negotiations between the Kuwait Oil Co. and the sheikh were resumed early in October and have been proceeding actively since. Tie latest information received from Koweit (there has been considerable correspondence and discussion with the Sheikh) is that the points outstanding are very few indeed. ttL^A'Cizr VpZ^K tfcrLu* L 5 t K^UrCjr' Oxt Cy, fa.

Other points for consideration are (4) Whether any warning should be given by us to the Kuwait Oil company. We shall have to go very carefully about this, so as to give Lord Lloyd no excuse for saying that we have used information given us by him to help an American against a British company. ^I^ave asked flrf Parrer of the D.O.T. to males enquiries about Mr* Hunting .

Mendel concursK 0 E I T 0 T T- GQIjTFiaBNTIAL. / Lore Lloyd rang ae up this morning to say that he was becoming increasingly disturbed about the oil position in the Gulf, and that he feared that he would have to raise the whole matter publicly in the near future# As I knew, he felt extremely strongly that oil exploitation in the Gulf should, as far as possible, be kept under purely British control, and he regarded the intervention of American interests with the utmost misgiving. It will be remembere&lt; that at his speech at the Central Asian Club dinner on October 18th Lord Lloyd delivered a strong attack on the Anglo-Persian Oil Company for having missed the opportunity of making sure that all the oil in the Persian Gulf was under British control, and was very critical of H#M. Government for not having influenced the Anglo-Persian Oil Company more strongly in this direction, and for having acquiesced in Americen interests getting a footing in the Gulf-.. 2# Lord Lloyd then went on to say that before taking the whole matter up publicly he wished to inform me most confidentially of the position as regards the Sheikhdom of Koweit (as distinct from the Neutral Zone)* He said that I was no doubt aware that an entirely British group was now competing against the Anglo-Persian- Gulf Oil of California Combine. I told him that I had not myself heard of this, but that the Foreign Office were only somewhat indirectly involved, and that it was possible that the information was still on its way. Ljprd Lloyd seemed somewhat surprised, and in these circumstances^heTwould he glad if I would keep his name out o: the affair as far as possible. The information had been given to him in confidence, and he did not wish to be quoted, but at the seme4 ^r IB* amr; time he felt bound to pass it on to me confidentially, so that there might be no misunderstanding about his own position if he eventually raised the matter publicly, and he would indeed be glad if I would make a note of what he had said so that it might be on record. He then went on to tell me that the new Interest, which he was informed was wholly British, was represented by Mr. P.. M . Hunting and was known as the Hunting Group, or 'Traders Limited 1 ! Hr. Hunting Y/as a Director of the B.O.D. (Mosul Oilfields Limited), but the B.O.D. were not concerned in this matter, and Mr. Hunting was acting independently. The following were, however, associated with him in 'Traders Limited':- Lord Glencohner, Charles Tennant,S and Company, imited, Sir Richard Redmayne, Mr# Edward Tennant of Hohler and Company, Mr. H. H . Holmes, and several others. 3. It appears that Mr* Hunting has now informed Lord Lloyd that his group have concluded an agreement with the Sheikh of Koweit (the signed and sealed text of which, in English and Arabic, has apparently been shown to Lord Lloyd by Mr# Hunting) by which the Sheikh grants an oil concession over the whole of his territory to the Hunting Group 'subject to the approval of H.M. Government'. Lord Lloyd was unable to tell me anything about the terms of the concession except that the document is extremely long and complicated But he clearly anticipated that if the Sheikh had a free hand the concession would go to the Hunting Group and not to the Anglo-Persian Gulf Oil Combine. He was inclined to take the line that it was now up to H.M. Government to ensure that the concession went to a purely British concern instead of to one which was at least half American. Moreover, Lord Lloyd, who gave me the impression of being now definitely hostilo to the A.P.O.C., explained that he thought that fdr political reasons it was most undesirable that ell the*»«* • ithe oil in the Oulf, or rother all the British control over Gulf oil, should he concentrated in the hande of a single group, more especially os it was unlikely that that group would hurry to develop it.

The Kuwait Oil Company was 50-50 owned by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (APOC) and the Gulf Oil Company of Pennsylvania. The Shaikh of Kuwait was precluded from signing an agreement without the permission of the His Majesty's Government (HMG).The file consists of minutes and correspondence from the India Office. The other main correspondents are the Foreign Office; Traders Limited; the Kuwait Oil Company; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; and the Political Agent, Kuwait (Lieutenant-Colonel Harold Richard Patrick Dickson).The file covers: negotiations over an oil concession between the Shaikh of Kuwait and Traders Limited; the involvement of Lord Lloyd [George Ambrose Lloyd, 1st Baron Lloyd]: in particular, Lloyd's contention that the concession should go to a wholly British-owned company, without any American involvement; enquiries into the composition of Traders Limited (e.g. folios 281-283, 273-276); company information about the concession supplied to the India Office by Sir Henry Strakosch, including Strakosch's view that Traders Limited were not likely to prove as desirable a concessionaire as the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Gulf Oil Company of Pennsylvania (folios 197-207); India Office approval of the awarding of the concession to the Kuwait Oil Company, and correspondence with both companies; correspondence between British Government officials and the Shaikh of Kuwait, expressing the British Government's disapproval of the Shaikh's dealings with Traders Limited (especially folios 137-154); the signing of the commercial agreement on 23 December 1934; minutes of discussions at the India Office between British Government officials and representatives of the Kuwait Oil Company, and Traders Limited; copies of the political and commercial agreements (folios 111-118); the suspicions of the Political Agent, Kuwait that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company were the 'hidden hand' behind Traders Limited (folios 62-69); copy of the Kuwait oil concession document supplied to the India Office by the Kuwait Oil Company, including two maps (folios 57-58) that accompanied the concession, with related correspondence (folios 38-58); discussion of what the British Government's attitude to the Shaikh of Kuwait should be in future, in view of the Shaikh's 'disregard' of his treaty obligations toward the British (e.g. folio 23); and the threat of legal action by Traders Limited against the decision to award the concession to the Kuwait Oil Company (folios 14-17).The file also contains one document of a slightly earlier date than the stated date range: a copy of the political agreement between the British Government and the Kuwait Oil Company dated 5 March 1934 (folios 324-325).The Arabic language content of the file consists of Arabic equivalents of place names in English on the map of Kuwait on folio 58.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>George Ambrose Lloyd</namePart></name></subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Henry Strakosch</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Kuwait Oil Company</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Traders Limited, Basra</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Kuwait</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Kuwait</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00017c#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
