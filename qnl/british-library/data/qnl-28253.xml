(Translation.) Dated 8 th Rajah 1331 ( 13 th June 1913 ). From—A bdul Aziz bin Abdul Rahman Al Faysal es Saud, To—His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire. After enquiries after your esteemed health. We beg to address yout Honour in consideration of the previous friendship between us and you and of the still earlier treaty belonging to the time of my grand father Faysal—may God forgive him—of the period of which fifty-five years have e^psed and fifty-five years still remain to run. I desire to establish the same in the same manner as it existed between you and my ancestors and this (fact) has prompted me to make this reference. Firstly, I am confident that there will happen nothing to your people to produce causes which may be contrary to friendship and rules. And we have now-a days conquered the 'country of our fathers and grand fathers (viz), El Hasa and El Qatif, as well as their dependencies and spared the soldiers remaining there, sending them over to Bahrain because it was more convenient for them to make their way to Basrah from that place. When they reached Bahrain, however, they were assisted by some one from your side and he afforded them the necessary facilities and encouraged them to stay at Bahrain and to cause trouble in our side. We received the news of this but we did not believe it because your wisdom and justice would not agree to this. After a few days they set out from Bahrain for El Qatif, but they returned in disappointment and remained for several days, having no supporter but your subjects and dependents. A few days afterwards they pro ceeded towards El Ojair and on their arrival there they experienced such a disas ter at the hands of a small party of our dependents as had not crossed their minds and they returned disappointed and repentant. Praise and thanks be to God that we do not attach the least importance or significance to them—or rather to them and to the party to whom they are connected. Yes, we, the Islamic and Mohammedan Arabs, wall rise to uphold our honour and will recover our rights with the last drop of our blood and we are doing this with confidence in the One Single God and also in all our Moslem brethren. We all have joined hands and there is no difference between us, we having been joined together by the cause of Islam and by the Arab sense of honour. In view of my friendly feelings I desire to be on the same terms with you as existed between you and my ancestors and (1 desire that those terms) should exist between me and you after them, (my ancestors). If the relations are as before and if it is incumbent upon both the parties to protect the subjects, we bind ourselves to you in regard to those who are in our side and to what concerns your subjects, and we will respect their honour, protect them and be responsible for them—because there remain certain people in our side who are against you and your subjects, and we ask for similar treatment from you. If this be really the case in view of the past friendship and of laws, please give us an intimation accordingly, and if the conditions are changed and the situation is not as we expect, then please warn us, so that we may be cognisant of the same. And thanks be to God, the Lord of both the Worlds and may his peace be on our Lord, Mohammed, his posterity and companions. Greetings.

With reference to the telegram on the subject of over tures by Bln Saud, from Secretary of State, dated June 10th. Bin Baud has addressed letters dated June 13th, in ana logous terms, to Political Agent, Bahrein, and myself, Thesi were sent by him to Bahrein by the hand of his former emis sary. Bin Baud commences with a reference to the long-stand ing friendship which has existed between the British Govern ment and his house, and to the agreement of 55 years ago entered into by his grand father - presumably the declara tion dated April 21st 1866, and given to Colonel Pelly. He goes on to complain of the facilities which he al leges were afforded to the Turks by the Political Agent in allowing them to use Bahrein as their base of operations. u o is most anxious, he continues, to preserve the long standing friendship between us and on his part undertakes to ensure that protection and good treatment are accorded to British subjects, and desires that we should give him similar assurances. If, however, the position has changed and we no longer wish to continue the friendly relations of the past (which he says he is most anxious that we should continue) he asks that he may be warned explicitly in order that he may be able to take steps to safeguard his own interests. In conclusion he says that he anxiously awaits my reply. The mail for Bahrein, where his envoy is waiting, leaves on July 3rd from Bushire. Cox.From - Secretary of State for India, London, To - Viceroy, Simla, Dated 3rd receivod 4th July 1913, 9. ;W} With reference to your telegram of July 1st and Cox’s telegram of June 27th. You should inform Bin Saud that the Turkish troops have received no assistance from us and that His Majesty’s Government while appre ciating his friendly sentiments, must maintain the strict est neutrality between the two parties and cannot inter vene in the dispute in any way, (lind of communication to be made to Bln Saud). Hie importance of the Amir is not being overlooked * by His Majesty’s Government, but they are very anxious * above all tilings that at the present juncture nothing should be said or done, which might arouse the suspi cion# in Turkey or elsewhere, that disintegration of Turkish dominion in Asia is desired by them, or that they will encourage it, and they wish great care to be taken to avoid any language or thoughts suggestive of spheres of influence and the like.— 10 . © Tolagram - r . ^'ron - foreign, Simla.

I am sorry that some days have elapsed before I have been able to reply but the reason was that I could not give you an authoritative answer without reference to the British Government. I have now received their reply. I am authorised to inform Your Honour that the reports which seem to have reached you to the effect that our Agent at Bahrain, Major Trevor gave facilities to the Turkish Troops while halting at Bahrain, vere not true. 1 heir stay at Bahrain on this occasion was unavoid able under the circumstances, but no assistance was given them. Secondly, I am to explain that your expression of friendly feelings towards them is appreciated by the British Government, but that they do not see their way to intervene in any way in the dispute which has arisen between Your Honour and the Turkish Government. On the contrary, the British Govern ment consider it necessary to observe a strictly neutral attitude towards both sides. This was the message of Government, and I beg to add an expression of my own appreciation of the friendly sentiments which you evince towards this Residency, and also of the kind hospitality and assistance you have been good enough to accord to English travellers who have passed through the spheres of your tribes.

The conversation drifted on to Bln *- ^’aud carelessly aid Sheikh Handan asked me what the intentions of Government were with regard to him, of course I wasn’t going to talk aoout that, even if I knew what those Intentions were, so I asked him If he was a .ft aid of Bin S’aud and he said that of course he was . 1 chaffed him saying that Bin S’aud had got a deal on his hands and would have to settle pending questions with Bin Rashid , the Sharif of Mecca and the Turkish Goverime a oefore he could find time t 1 swallow u) the Trucial chiefs.- The conversation however was confined to generalities and I heard 10 confirmation' of the rumour which originally reached me from Taimur and it seems quite possible that, as yrfu' say, it might be a Hinavi ruse to discredit the-Ghaf iris, it would ceftainlv not have ba^ni easy for Sheikh Hamdan to discuss any such rumour in a public maji4.ssslikc the one in which we were sitting.

From— Lieutsvant-Ooloxel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.L, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. la continuation of previous correspondence on the subject, I have the honour to report progress in connection with the proposed meeting with Bin Saud. 2. He having informed me that he would be returning coastwards after Resident to Foreign, telegram No. 1791, dated 23rd the ’Id-lll-Haj (10th November) I Wrote October * to him on the 27th October saying that I intended to be at Bahrain on or about the 18th November and hoped he would make it convenient to meet me at O jair on or about the 21st, and that I would expect news of his movements on arrival at Bahrain. The same day that I reached Bahrain however a messenger came in. from Bin Saud with a letter saying that my letter had found him in Qasim at too great a distance to admit of the possibility of reaching Ojair by the 23st November, but that he was hurrying in and begged me to meet him on the 10th Muharram at Ojair. This it is impossible to do without missing the mail by which I have arranged with the permission of Government to proceed on leave, but if this meeting is to take place at all it is urgent that it should be brought off as soon as possible, and I therefore instructed Major Trevor verbally to undertake it in my behalf accompanied by Captain Shakespear. I beg to attach a copy of my letter in that connection to Bin Saud and of the “ sailing directions ” which I have handed to Major Trevor, and I trust that higher authority will see nothing in them to which exception can be taken. 3. I also enclose for the information of the Government of India a copy of v „ a report from Captain Shakespear stating I«o.C.-24, dated ]8t,h November. ,• i 1 ^ i 3 according to current rumour, the nature of the terms which the Porte hopes to make with Bin Saud. It seems to me that the final item, if the report proves well-founded, is one to which we should take exception, if it is contemplated to leave Bin Saud in control of Katif and Ojair, and I therefore venture to recommend that a timely decision be arrived at as to the course we should take for the protection of our interests in case the present report, in regard to this item, is confirmed. The Government of India will not have forgotten the correspondence which has passed in recent years regarding the representation of our commercial in terests at Katif and the continued desire of British Indian traders to settle there. Our right to be represented has been recognized in principle and, apart from the capitulations, there seems no reason we should tolerate and fresh an un friendly compact between the Porte and Bin Saud, to the continued prejudice of our rights and interests in this connection. Memorandum setting forth the position as regards Bin Saud for guidance at the time of the contemplated meeting with him. It is highly important to have in mind to start with a clear understanding the policy of His Majesty’s Government towards Turkey resulting from recent developments of the general political situation in Europe and the Middle East; on which policy the attitude of Government towards the question of Bin Saud and his relations with the Turks is based. i The family having been relegated to Central Arabia for the last 40 years odd, the present (Amir ?) has lately ejected the Turkish garrisons from the Al Hasa sanjak and coast and descended to the shores of the Persian Gulf where he is in de facto control of the ports of Katif, Ojair and other small posts. As long as he continues in that position, practically independent of any control, heis a danger to our general interests in the Gulf and to our relations with the Arab Principalities, unless we have a working understanding with him. This is recognised by His Majesty’s Government. Thus the Secretary of State for India addressing the Foreign Office on the subject on 13th August, last wrote “ * * they (the Government of India) cannot afford to make him their enemy and they propose to enter into a friendly exchange of views with him in order to regularise the position. “ It must of course he realised that Bin Saud, in return for a friendly attitude towards us, may ask for our support against the Turks. It will b e necessary then to make it clear to him that His Majesty’s Government, whil e willing to use their good offices to bring about a reconciliation, cannot under take to support him, but must maintain the strictest neutrality.” A few days later as the result of deliberation between His Majesty’s India and Foreign Offices, the following instructions were telegraphed to the Govern ment of India by the Secretary of State (on 21st August) :— “ The Amir must be made clearly to understand, if he asks for our support against Tnrkev, as a quid pro quo for complying with our wishes, that while we are willing to do our best to reconcile him with Turkish Government, we are unable to support him against the Turks P. Z. C.) and are bound to keep a strictly neutral attitude Later still, this time in connection primarily with the general subject of Railway enterprise within Asiatic Turkey, the Government of India in making comment on certain aspects of the negotiations, telegraphed to the Secretary of State on Sth September, as follows :— «* • * There can be no doubt from the point of view of Indian in terests, that a strong and reformed Turkey in Asia will act as a safeguard to India from interference on the part of Foreign Powers from the west, and might even in an indirect manner result in the maintenance of Persian integrity. Now tlfat His Majesty’s Government have come to terms with the Turkish Government, as regards their respective interests in the Persian Gulf, they have nothing to fear from Turks and every advantage to gain from friendly- relations with the Porte. * * % * The Government of India are there fore strongly of opinion that His Majesty’s Government should spare no effort to avoid any measure likely to contribute to the partition of Asiatic Turkey either at the present time or hereafter and that His Majesty’s Government should pursue a consistent policy of reforming strengthening and maintaining the Turkish Empire The above extracts indicate the policy of Government sufficiently clearly. As regards Abdul Aziz-hin-Saud and the imminent meeting. It is apparent from the correspondence with him that on his part he is pmwd/Vm'e anxi ous to establish relations with us, hut seeks a more definite exposition of our attitude in regard to his relations with the Turks than mere expressions of good-will and the declaration of neutrality. It has been suggessted to him that he should explain more fully in what way he would expect us to evince our good-will and in response to this he has 'replied that he w r ould like to have a meeting with a British representative and discuss the position with him in person. It seems therefore to rest with Bin Saud to open the discussion by stating frankly in what direction it is that he desires the expression of our good-wull or our co-operation. On our side we have explained to the Porte that now that Bin Saud has come down to the shores of the Gulf and controls certain Gulf Ports, he must be regarded by us as having entered the sphere of Gulf politics and w r e cannot ignore him but must find a modus vivendi with him for the protection of our own interests, while at the same time maintaining a strictly neutral attitude in regard to the estrangement prevailing between Bin Saud and the Porte. It would also appear that we have expressed our willingness to promote a reconciliation if desired to do so.Hakki Pasha to whom the communication was made appeared to be grati fied rather than offended by it, and later on, apparently at the beginning of October in thanking His Majesty's Gov ernment for their friendly offer, he stated that the Porte was actually in negotiation not fail to avail itself of their help if necessity Enclosure to Foreign Department Endorsement No. 2627-E. A., dated 13th November 1913. with Bin Saud and would arose. It may be taken for granted that the Porte will be anxious to avoid our mediation if possible—meanwhile the meeting between Bin Saud and a British representative will be taking place. It is probable that in course of discussion Bin Saud, referring to Resident's letter No. 338 of 11th September and to our desire that he should refrain from interfering in the territory or politics of other Arab Principalities on the Coast, and co operate with us for the suppression of piracy and the arms traffic, will revert to his previous suggestion and enquire whether, if he gives us satisfactory undertakings under these heads, we shall be prepared to guarantee him immu nity from attack by sea. Our recent warning to the Porte that they would not he allowed to use Bahrain as a base for attacking Bin Saud, amounts indirectly and practically to a partial substitute for such a guarantee, and if Bin Saud makes a bargain with the Turks by which he is confirmed or left in his present de facto position and if we can also reach an understanding witn him, with the cognizance of the Porte, providirg for ; (i) Non-interference in territory or politics of other Arab Principalities in the Gulf including Katar. (ii) Co-operation for preservation of Maritime Truce and suppression of piracy. (iii) Co-operation for suppression of the illicit arms traffic. (iv) Admission of British Indian traders to Katif as of old, and accept ance if necessary of a Residency Agent to look after them, it is possible that His MajestyGovernment might see their way, especi ally in view of the fact that Bin Sand's oo-operatiou in suppression of arms traffic prevents his arming himself, and of the practical impossibility of the Turks putting troops into Katif without using Bahrain to obtain an undertak ing from them not to take hostile action by sea against the coast left in Bin Saud’s control without a previous exchange of views witli us,the result of which would probably be that we should be able to compose the quarrel. Lastly, it is possible that the question of Katar and the status of Bin Thani may come up in course of the discussion. In this connection I think it will be well if the text of a portion of the artk^e of the Anglo-Turkish Conven tion relating to Katar is translated to Bin Saud :— “ The Imperial Ottoman Government having renounced all claims concern ing the Peninsula of El Katar, it is agreed between the two Governments that the said Peninsula shall, as in the past be governed by Shaikh Jasim bin Thani and his successors. His Britannic Majesty’s Government declares that it will not permit the Shaikh of Bahrain to interfere in the internal affairs of El Katar nor to encroach upon the autonomv of the country nor to annex it”. It might he added that as the result of this agreement the present Turkish garrison will be withdrawn in due course. Dated 22nd November 1913 (=22nd Zilhijjeh 1381).

But it makes no difference. Inshallah an interview will take place on the date asked for by you, between Your Honour and Major Trevor, British Agent at Bahrain and Captain Shakespear, British Agbnt at Kuwait on my behalf, and they will be ready at Bahrain about that time, and will await news from your side from Ojair. In conclusion, I bid you farewell with regret and trust that a meeting may take place between us sometime in future, and that your affairs will prosper in the meanwhile. ‘ 1 (Usual ending).

I have the honour to report for your information that the following rumours are current in connection with the desire of the Turkish authorities to come to terms with Abdul Aziz “ Bin Sand and, Shaikh Sir Mubarak-as-Sabah appears to believe that they are well founded. xt 2 -' i 11 j 8 Said that the Porte is P re P ared to recognise *• Bin Sand ” as ruler of JNejdand Hassa, to give him a formal appointment to that post, and to ayow him to collect the revenue, paying to the Porte a fixed sum per annum or the privilege, but it is understood that two of the primary conditions which they hope to make good as part of the above arrangement are : (1) that “ Bin Sand ” should admit Turkish troops to the coast towns of Ojair, Katif as before ; (2) that he should bind himself absolutely to refer all matters of foreign politics to be dealt with by the Porte and to allow no foreign merchants nor agents in his territory as now recognised. y Cli 5FI?—44— 22-12-13—GCBP SimlaCONFIDENTIAL.

I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, No. T.-806, dated the 20th December 1913. a co Py th® letter, marginally noted, which ‘ . has been received from the Political Agent at Bahram in regard to a request of Bin Saud for a pass authorising him to procure certain arms and ammunition. No action seems possible at the present time, but the fetter amplifies the remark made in paragraph 11 of the enclosure to my letter No. 24, dated the 4th January 1914, while for an earlier notice of Bin Saud's relation to the arms trade I would refer you to my predecessors letter No. 1669, dated the 26th May 1913. No. T.-806 (Confl.), dated Bahrain, the 20th December 1913. From Major A. P. Trevor, C.I.E., Political Agent, Bahrain, # • f To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to report that in the course of a conversation at Ojair on the 16th instant. Bin Saud asked me if I could give him a pass authorising him to procure from Muskat, for the use of his forces, 4,000 Martini Rifles and Carbines, of which 1,000 should be Martini Metfords, with 400 rounds of ammunition per rifle. 2. In reply, I informed him that I had no power to grant such a pass, but that I would refer the matter to you. Bin Saud enquired when a pass or an answer to his request could be obtained. I replied that as the number of arms applied for was a large one, it was probable that the question might have to be referred to the Government, which would naturally entail some delay in getting a reply. I also added that it was possible that the answer might also be delayed by the question whether such a pass could be granted at the present moment, in view of his diffi culties with the Turkish Government, and of the neutrality of the British Government in the dispute—possibly the grant of such a pass might be considered an infringement of neutrality. 3. I am not, of course, in a position to make any useful remarks on this point, but I think that Bin Saud s request shows that he wishes to co-operate with us in respect of the Arms Traffic, and (leaving aside the question of neutrality), I would respectfully suggest that it would be advisable to encourage Bin Saud to obtain his arms in a legitimate manner. Otherwise, he will doubtless attempt to smuggle them by sea or overland from Muskac if he can obtain any there, or he may get them fiom Jibutil to some port on the Red Sea and thence overland across Arabia. 4. Bin Saud stated, and Captain Shakespear confirmed the statement from personal experience, that modern small bore magazine rifles afe useless to Arabs in the desert, as the sand speedily makes the mechanism useless. There is also the objection of the impossibility of re-charging the cartridges for such 'weapons. For these reasons Bin Saud requires Martinis for his men, and for the same reasons the considerable number of magazine rifles recently captured from the Turks are practically useless to him. 5. I may add that Bin Saud gave me most explicit assurances that the arms were required solely for the use of his armed forces, and were not in any way for trade purposes and would not be sold. 6. If the pass cannot be granted now, I venture to suggest that it might be givsn when the negotiations between Bin Saud and the Turkish Government are completed, or are in a fair way to settlement. C614FDV 2 No. 24, dated Busliire, the 4th (received the 12th) January 1914. From J. G. Lorimer, Esq., C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, T 0 ^he Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Delhi. In continuation of my predecessor^ letter No. 4005-M. of 2nd December 1913, No. T.-805, dated the 20th December 1913. 1 1 \ ave the honour to submit a Report by Major Trevor, Political Agent, Bahrain. 2. In forwarding this report to the Government of India, I would remark that our position between Bin Saud and the Porte is somewhat difficult. On the one hand we have recognised as belonging to Turkey the province of Hasa, which Bin Sand at present governs as an independent ruler, and which he wishes to retain. On the other hand, it would be imprudent to shape our action on the assumption that Bin Saud s retention of Hasa will be permanent or indeed more than tempo- rary. At the same time it is impossible, regard being had to the local interests of British subjects and proteges, that we should continue to treat Hasa as a region politically derelict and having no administrative head with whom we can deal in matters affecting British subjects. 3. Every free bargain has two sides and must contain, if it is to be accepted, some element of advantage to both parties. With due regard to this principle a mutual arrangement seems not impossible, in regard to certain points, between ourselves and Bin Saud ; but in respect of the practicability of an accommodation between Bin Saud and the Turks, and the outlook is less promising. 4. Bin Saud is willing that British subjects should reside and do business in Hasa. He would protect them and would, in practice at least, recognise our right to represent their interests. It appears to me that, if our subjects who are desirous of trading in Hasa take advantage of his present disposition, a valuable point will have been gained by us, and that Bin Saud will himself benefit, and will be conscious of benefiting, by the mere fact that subjects of ours whom we trust him to protect reside in his territory. He cannot but be aware that he lays us under an obligation by encouraging them and that we on our part will seek every means of maintaining a situation more favourable to our people than that which existed under the Turkish regime. British subjects who are desirous of proceeding to Hasa are now being permitted to do so, and I am authorising the Political Agent in Bahrain to enter into such correspondence with Bin Saud as their concerns may hereafter necessitate. In this way, perhaps, one part of the Bin Saud problem will be solved without further discussion, and in a manner making it difficult for the Turks, should they subsequently reoccupy Hasa, to resume their former attitude to British subjects there. To consolidate the position, I I recommend that a Native Agent be at Once posted to Katif to act as medium of communication between the Political Agent in Bahrain and Bin Baud’s local governors. The Turks could hardly obtain the removal of this agent if, on recover ing Hasa, they found him holding an established position in the province. 5. Other matters which, it seems to me, might be settled directly with Bin Saud at th.e present time are that of his relations with the Shaikhs of Katar and Trucial Oman and that of the control of refugees from his authority who settle under their protection. These questions arise from Bin Sand’s own position as an Arab Chief and do not concern the Turks. It might be arranged with Bin Saud, on condition of his not entering the territory of the said Shaikhs without our consent, that we should use our influence to induce them to restrain or expel refugees whose conduct in their chosen places of residence was shown to be injurious to Bin Saud’s legitimate interests. A reciprocal arrangement of this nature should now, I venture to think, be proposed to Bin Saud through the Political Agent in Bahrain. 6. The crux of the present negotiations is Bin Saud’s virtual request that we should intervene between him and the Turks in order to secure to him the govern ment of the province of Hasa on an assured, autonomous, and probably hereditary basis. Here it seems to me that, the views of the Porte and of Bin Saud being at bottom irreconcileable, there is small prospect of our interposing with success, and that we should, therefore, in the interests of good relations both between our selves and him and between ourselves and the Turks, not be too forward in our inter position. Bin Saud is, from the Turkish point of view, a very recent and only moment of Bin S moment There ca Hasa by of actior the Otto selves st however disposed negotiati able to b 7.

After a short interview in the Serai Bin Sand called for horses and we rode to the camp with him accompanied by a large crowd of horsemen, who on the way gave us an “ ardtha ” or welcoming ceremony, which consists in galloping furiously to and fro in front of honoured guests, shouting, brandishing swords, firing off rifles, etc. 5. Bin Saud told us that he had arrived about half-an-hour before we did and was exceedingly cordial and friendly. The friendly personal relations existing be tween him and Captain Shakespear, resulting from their meetings at Kuwait and in the desert, put us on good terms at once, and made our subsequent interviews easy. On arrival at the camp we found that Bin Saud had caused a very large tent to be pitched for us, and done all he could in other ways to make us comfortable, inter alia by getting one of the best cooks in Bahrain over and entertaining us sumptuously in Arab style during the whole of our two days’ stay. 6. On the day of our arrival and the greater part of the next day, Tuesday (16th December), we discussed with him the points mentioned in the memorandum attached to Sir Percy Cox’s letter under reply. The result of these discussions is set forth in Memorandum I attached to this letter. After we had discussed these points Bin Saud raised the question of the policy of the British Government in Katar and Trucial Oman with special reference to their attitude in regard to enemies of his who might take sanctuary in these states and then use them as a base for intriguing against him, or as a retreat after inciting some Bedouin tribe to revolt against him. He said that of course he had not the slightest objections to fugitives from his wrath taking refuge with the neighbouring Shaikhs in accordance with the usual Arab custom, provided that they did not use their sanctuary as a base for intrigue ; but if they did so he would be compelled to take steps for his own safety. The gist of this conversation is recorded in Memorandum II attached to this letter. 7. After business had been concluded at the final interview Bin Saud volun teered to show us in confidence the conditions which had been proposed by the Turkish Government and himself as a basis for settlement of his future position. The document he produced and read out to us was in the form of a draft agreement containing 11 articles, five of which had been suggested by Bin Saud himself and the other six by the Turkish Government. The terms proposed by Bin Saud in sisted on complete autonomy for the region actually controlled by him, special reference being made to his right to the coast-line and to the appointment and control of all local officials. The terms proposed by the Turkish Government laid down a partial autonomy for Bin Saud under the suzerainty of the Sultan with the following conditions :— (1) The re-instatement of the former Turkish garrisons in the Hasa pro- vince. ( 2 ) Kazis and other judicial officers to be appointed by diiect “firman” by the Sultan. (3) The exclusion of all foreign merchants and agents of Foreign Powers. (4) All communications from Foreign Powers or their representatives to be referred to the Turkish authorities for disposal. (5) The payment of an annual revenue of £T.3,000. (6) No concessions to be given by Bin Saud to any foreign companies for railways or motor-car services. 8. A 'pro'pos of condition (6) above some conversation took place, from which we gathered that Bin Saud would not be averse to giving concessions under British auspices, should his position be regularized or in some way assured through our good offices. 9. I would add that during the discussions, on more than one occasion, Bin Saud made it clear that he would prefer that any reconciliation between himself and the Turks should be carried through und(* the auspices of the British Govern ment, because he had no faith in the permanency of an^ arrangement made direct ly with that Turkish Government. 10. Before leaving Bin Saud sent instructions to his Deputy at Katij that he should permit British subjects to enter and trade and open shops, should they arrive5 ' at Katif and should protect them ; and that he should communicate with the Poli- ica Agent at Bahrain regarding them should any questions arise. * ^ ^ ie f° rm al and private discussions which took place Bin Baud was mos xrendly ; he seemed very much in earnest and most anxious to do whatever ire could to meet the wishes of Government and to obtain their support. We ^ ^ T itish Government could not give him any assurance that they would keep the peace, as he expressed it, on the Hasa coast; this of course rs what he wanted, but he realized that it was impossible. The tangible results o our interviews with him were that he at once agreed to accept and protect British raders in k at if (and no doubt in other places on the coast should they want to go there) and to postpone making any settlement with the Turks until he marches nor h in the spring, i.e., for three mcnths. Bin Baud also stated in a more ir formal manner that he would not interfere in the politics of Katar and the Trucial Coast states, and I think that Memorandum II shows that he has no desire to act con- trar y to 'G 16 wishes of Government in these regions. Further, I am of opinion, u ^ a P^ ln Shakespear shares my view, that there is not the slightest doubt that should His Majesty s Government consider it desirable to use their good offices to effect a settlement between Bin Baud and the Porte, by which he would remain de jure ruler under Turkish suzerainty of the territories cf which he is at present ‘ de facto ’ ruler, Bin Baud would be only too glad to make a formal arrange ment with the British Government cn the remainder of the four points men tioned m Bir Percy Cox s memorandum, viz : to co-operate in the suppression of piracy and the arms traffic, and in the preservation of the Maritime Truce. In connection with the Arms Traffic question I may mention that Bin Baud has made an application to be allowed to import rifles for the use of his troops : this is being dealt with separately in my letter No. 806 of the 20th December 1913, but it shows, I think, that Bin Baud means to work with the British Government in the matter. 12. In the course of our conversations with Bin Baud we gathered indirectly that he would probably accept autonomy under the suzerainty of His Imperial Majesty the Sultan with the payment of a trifling revenue (or tribute) to Turkey if necessary, as an acknowledgment of the suzerainty. Should' His Majesty’s Gov ernment see fit to try and effect a settlement between Bin Baud and the Turkish Government, it would seem desirable, I respectfully submit, to take some definite steps within the next two months, i.e.,—say before the 1st March,—of which at least a hint could be communicated by me to Bin Baud before he goes north in the spring in cider to save him from making some arrangement with the Turks -which might be hostile to our interests. In the meanwhile if one or two British subjects who have been pressing me to allow them to go to Katif are permitted to go there, it will strengthen our position in resisting the conditions regarding the exclusion of foreigners, which the Turks particularly desire to impose upon Bin Baud. 13. In conclusion I would observe that only Bin Baud, Captain Shakespear, and myself were present at any of the interviews at which politics were discussed, and I should like to say that the exceedingly friendly and cordial attitude of Bin Baud at the meeting was due to his friendly feelings towards Captain Shakespear. The latter’s knowledge of the language and ways of the Bedouin from Central Arabia was also most helpful and his presence was mainly responsible for any favourable results which may follow from the meeting. / I .—Memorandum of interview with Bin Baud on 15-16th December 1913. In order to make his position clear Bin Baud began by giving an account of the history of Nejd, from his point of view, of which the following paragraph is a resume:— His family, he said, had been in Nejd from time immemorial and had for gene rations ruled over it without interference from outside. He himself was an Arab Chief whose views on matters of policy naturally differed from those of European Powers. Bedouin tribes are not concerned in weighing the merits of different Governments as they Jive as nomads, and when oppressed move off to another lo cality. When Ibn Rashid attacked the Bin Baud family, the latter eventually wonthrough, in recent years he (Abdul Aziz Bin Sand) himself has been able to consoli- date his authority in Central Arabia and has now taken Hasa and Katif. As is well-known these places originally belonged to his family and did not pass into the hands of the Turks by fair conquest, but by stratagem, rtz., by fomenting dis cord between two members of the family, Abdulla and Saud the sons of Faisal, and by supporting one against the other. Eventually when Abdulla was successful the Turks, in return for their help, retained their garrisons in the Hasa province, and actually took over the government of it, though Abdulla was made titular governor. After a time the Bedouin Arabs finding that the local Turkish Government was weak and impotent took to indiscriminate raiding, thereby causing grea,t chaos and want of security, while the more respectable and responsible portion of the po- pulation became dissatisfied with the Government because it was unable to put a stop to the reign of lawlessness. In the meanwhile he (Abdul Aziz Bin Saud) was approached by Arabs, not only of the Hasa province but also of Baghdad, Basra and other places who were equally dissatisfied, and became convinced that the whole Arab world scorned the Turkish rule. Finding that the province of Hasa, where our word runs/’ was being oppressed and bled by the Turks, and having been asked several times by the people of the province to intervene, he eventually determined to take the bull by the horns, re-occupy the province and ask for the support of tne British Government. 2 At this stage it was pointed out to him that our first object in arranging this personal interview was to find out precisely in what way he wanted the assistance of the British Government, seeing that he was aware of the friendly relations between the British and Turkish Governments and of the neutrality of the former res pect of the differences between him and the latter. In reply Bin Saud stated that what he was concerned with was his honour, the honour of his house, and the pre servation of his ancestral rights. He desired to renew and maintain the ancient friendshin between his family and the British Government and to have his position secured ' He was led to ask the British Government for assistance because he had seen how that Government had dealt with Kuwait, Bahrain and other places and had realized that they were to be trusted. Bin Saud added that he wishes to have nothin- to do with any other Power although he has already been approached by the Turkish Government. He feels that he must make some terms with them to sate- guard his position, if the British Government disappoint him. He wants to know definitely what their expressions of goodwill really amount to, m order to be able to secure his own position. 3 At this point he was asked to explain himself rather more clearly . He re plied that all he wants is to be left in peace, and he sees thadthe British Govern ment keens the peace all along the coasts of the Persian Gulf except in this small section-the coaJst of the Hasa province. If he could get an assurance that the British Government would maintain the Maritime Peace on this strip of coast and recognise his position as “defacto” ruler, he would be satisfied; if not he would have “to trust in his own sword.” He feels convinced that the British Government could secure this result by diplomatic means if they so desired. 4 At this point it was explained to Bin Saud that we could give him no such assurance and moreover we were convinced that the British Government, in view of their friendship with the Turkish Government, could not do so either, as any such assurance at the present time would obviously be directed against the Turks. 5. He said that the Turkish authorities had written to hiin proposing that he should come to terms; the draft conditions laid down that the ‘‘ status quo ante should practically be restored, that he should not accept any representatives nor subiects of Foreign Powers in his territory, and that he should not hold any com munication with any Foreign Power except through the Turkish authorities. He said that he thought the Turks would be ready to drop all the conditions in pro posed agreement except the questions of the conduct of foreign policy and of the admission of foreign agents and foreign subjects. These he thought, were their principal demands, and if he conceded them the Porte would probably agree to leave him in peace as “ defacto” ruler-how would the British Government view such an 7 It was pointed out that if he continues to be the “ de facto ” ruler pf the Hasa coast, it would be absolutely necessary for the local British authorities tohave direct communication with him and his local officers for the settlement of various commercial, pearling and other disputes, which constantly arise, rot to mention the apprehension of fugitive offenders and absconding divers. British Government, therefore, would in all probability have to take up the question of the prejudice to their rights and interests which the existence of any clause excluding their representatives and subjects would entail. 7. In the discussion which followed Bin Saud said he would be glad to co-ope rate with the British Government in the suppression of piracy and the illicit arms traffic, and in the maintenance of the Maritime Truce, and would also agree not to interfere in the politics of Katar and the Irucial Coast, and to admit British sub jects and representatives in his territory, provided that the British Government would give him the assurance mentioned above. In fact, he went further than this, and said he would be willing to consult the British Government in all impor tant matters if he received these assurances. We again repeated to him that it was quite impossible to give him any such assurance. 8. In the course of his remarks Bin Saud pointed out that, though he claimed the Trucial Oman and Katar as part of his ancestral dominions and could make his power felt there, he was quite willing to meet the wishes of Government in regard to them. He hinted that the only reason which restrained him from overrunning Katar, and possibly Trucial Oman, after he had occupied Hasa and Katif was his IV desire not to alienate the sympathy of the British Government. 9. Bin Saud pressed the urgency of making a definite reply to the Turkish pro posals at an early date, and said that correspondence had already been going on since Ramzan last (August 1913), but that he had delayed doing so in the hope that the proposed meeting with the Resident might result in some understanding. 10. It was then suggested to him that, as we were not in a position to state the attitude of His Majesty’s Government in regard to the proposals made to him by the Turkish Government, it might be still possible for him to delay a definite answer until His Majesty’s Government have had an opportunity of considering the report of our meeting. Bin Saud pointed out that the mere fact of the meeting would draw upon him a certain amount of opprobium from the Turks and thereby prejudice the progress of the negotiations already instituted by them. We explained that this meeting was necessary in order to find a basis for a working arrangement to settle local disputes and questions arising between his officers on the coast and local British officials. In fact, we informed him, the necessity of such a meeting is recog nised and so far back as the middle of September (Shawal) last His Majesty^s Gov ernment had informed the Turkish Government (through Hakki Pasha) that as he (Bin Saud) had reached the shores of the Persian Gulf, the British Government would be unable to ignore him indefinitely, and for the protection of their own inter ests would be compelled to find a modus vivendi with him, while at the same time maintaining a strictly neutral attitude and desiring a speedy reconciliation between him and the Turks. 11. Second day.—Bin Saud reverted to the concluding portion of the previous day’s discussion, and we further explained that the primary object of our visit was to ascertain his views with the object of enabling the British Government to find a mo lus vivendi with him on the lines already suggested. It was further pointed out to him that the commercial and pearling relations between Bahrain and the coast of the Hasa province were very intimate, and that British subjects who had pre viously been in Katif had several times pressed the Political Agent, Bahrain, to allow them to return, but that he had refused to agree, pending the regularisation of Bin Sand’s position or a clearer idea of his probable attitude towards them. Bin Sand then said that he had no objection to British subjects coming to Katif provid ed that their claims against local people received adequate investigation before settlement, and that, subject to this proviso, he would afford them every protection. He appeared to be under the impression that British officials might perhaps uphold and press all claims of their nationals, irrespective of the correctness of such claims. We reassured him on this point, and he then said he would gladly admit and pro tect British traders. 12. Bin Saud then reverted to the question of replying to the overtures of the Turkish Government. He said that he realised that the entire exclusion of foreign enterprise and commerce from the Hasa coast was impossible at the present time.8 in fact it has already existed for years. Accordingly he proposed to reply to the Turkish overtures that the questions between him and the Turkish Government ap peared to him to be matters which could be better discussed at a personal interview, that he would be moving to the northern end of his territory in the spring after two or three months, and that he suggested that the Wali should meet him then some where in the neighbourhood of Basra. He would add (and would also inform his agents in Basra and Baghdad) that his recent meeting with British officers at Ojair had its raison d’etre in the necessity for making some arrangement to faci litate communication between his officials on the coast and the neighbouring Bri tish officials in regard to the settlement of commercial and pearling claims and cases arising between British subjects (and proteges) and the local people; the apprehension of fugitive offenders; and the co-operation of his local officials in cases of piracy. 13. As Bin Saud was frank enough to tell us the lines of his proposed reply, we ventured to say that its terms seemed to us unobjectionable and asked him whether he had any objection to our communicating its general ten our in our report; to this he replied that he had no objection, but that he hoped that the British Govern ment would see therein an earnest of his sincere desire to arrive at a modus vivendi with them, and would exercise their benevolent good offices on his behalf.

Note .—In order to prevent any misapprehension the note of our interviews from which this memorandum has been compiled were translated to Bin Saud, and he agreed that they were an accurate resume of our discussions. 18th December 1913. AT SEA. CONFIDENTIAL. II .—Memorandum of questions raised by Bin Saud regarding Katarand Trucial Oman. After the discussion on the subject of arranging a modws vivendi with Bin Saud had been finished, he said that he had another matter to discuss with us. He then asked us what was the policy of the British Government in regard to Katar and the Trucial Oman states. We said that we could not make any definite pronouncement on the subject, but that as a general rule, as far as we were aware, the policy of the Government was one of non-interference in internal matters; in the case of the Tru cial Chiefs we had certain agreements of long-standing regarding the Maritime Truce, the Slake Trade and Arms Traffic to which we held the Shaikhs, but we did not as a rule interfere with their rule on shore. As regards Katar we translated to him the clause referring to that region in the recent Anglo-Turkish Convention, and said that we presumed the British policy there would also be one of non-interference. Bin Saud said that there was a possibility that enemies of his might take re fuge in some of these states and plot against him and foment trouble—he instanced the case of his relatives, the Araif, who are now in Katar—and asked what the c.f., Bahrain and Kuwait Diaries, 1912-13. attitude of the Government would be in re gard to such cases. We said that we were unable to state definitely but would be glad to refer the matter to higher authority with a view to getting the point settled as soon as possible. He was apparently satisfied with this, but urged that the matter was important to him as affecting his authority over the adjacent Bedouin tribes. At any time in order to check the intrigues of such people it might be necessary for him to take reprisals and this might involve him with the British Government, which he was anxious to avoid. 18th December 1913.

D.—21-1-14.—12.—C.W.Mlb . , fsf: &gt;/f0 No. Cf.-203 (Confidential), dated Bushire, the 1st September 1914. From— Major S. G. Knox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To —The Hon’ble Lieutenant-Colonel Sir P. Z. Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.T., Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, Simla. I have the honour to invite a reference to correspondence ending with my letter No. Cf. 52, dated 21st July 1914, on the subject of a proposed treaty with Shaikh Abdullah bin Jasim bin Thani. In my telegram No. 1042, dated 30th August 1914,1 informed you, Sir, of the satisfactory reply that had been received from Shaikh Abdullah in reply to the letter in which I announced to him that war had broken out between Great Britain and Germany. The value of that telegram is however, to some extent, discounted by reports received by last mail from the Political Agent, Bahrain, who derives his infomation mainly from Khan Saheb \ usuf bin Ahmad Kanoo. He has also had the advantage of recently discussing the situation with Shaikh Khalid bin Muhammad bin Thani. The reports of Khan Saheb Yusuf bin Ahmad Kanoo undoubtedly show that disunion reigns among the members of the Bin Thani family, and that Shaikh Abdullah bin Jasim has some difficulty in holding his own. He seems to be far more tractable than the remaining members of the family, and, theoretically at all events, holds views as to the maintenance of order, equality of all before the Shara’ Law and general justice which seem to mark him out as the man for our purposes. But the difficulties of his position, which he would, it might be hoped, surmount if left alone, are greatly enhanced by the tendency to intrigue with Bin Sa’ud, shown by Shaikh Khalifah bin Jasim bin Thani. The Amir would be no Arab if he did not welcome the opportunity of increasing his territory and influence and the outlook for the independence of Katar is gloomy, unless we can arrange to bolster up the authority of the Shaikh. The Turks would jio doubt view with satisfaction Bin Sa’ud’s advance along the coast line hoping, not without some show of reason, that it would embroil him with us. The result might be to throw Bin Sa’ud still more under Turkish influence or to weaken his prestige and authority. In either case, the Turk, who loves fishing in troubled waters, would think he stood to gain. Again, if Katar should fall into the hands of Bin Sa’ud, the consequence for the Trucial Chiefs, commencing with Abu Dthabi, are bound to be most serious. They have been severely scourged this year by the ravages of plague and, on the top of that, comes financial ruin, caused by this most disastrous war now raging in Europe. The only remedy for this state of affairs would appear to be, as has been already stated, an attempt to preserve Shaikh Abdullah bin Jasim bin Thani and show, in good time, by marks of our favour towards him, to Bin Sa’ud that he must reckon on our strong opposition' in the event of any intrigues tending to undermine the position of our prestige. I have been warned by Khan Saheb Yusuf bin Ahmad Kanoo that any attempt at a treaty with Abdullah bin Jasim bin Thani alone must be kept secret, as otherwise the Shaikh runs great danger of assassination or, at least, of being ousted by combination of his relatives against him on the charge of selling his country and their rights to the British. The fact that such an accusation is absurd and rests on no foundation does not make it harder for an Arab to believe. We are therefore faced with a small problem of considerable difficulty. The solution appears to me to lie in support, as strong as we can make it, of Shaikh Abdullah without for the present asking for any return and trusting to the future to bring us our reward. And here the personal factor comes into play whether Shaikh Abdullah is worth support. I have already mentioned that he appears tractable and well intentioned. The next question —and a most important one f or us is whether he is strong and will be able to make a good use of such aid as we shall give him. Will he be Shaikh Mubarak or Shaikh Isa ? I am afraid that I must here plead guilty to absolute ignorance of his character and, as I am not6 sure that any other political officer in the Gulf is in a position to give a more satis factory reply to the question I have pbsed above, nothing but personal acquain tance with the Shaikh himself is likely to enable us to form a reliable judgment. Personal acquaintance with the Shaikh is also calculated to lead us to satisfactory conclusions as to what form the support to him, on which I have already laid stress, should take, for I must confess that I am not in a position at present to put forward any definite proposals on this point any more than I can form an accurate estimate of the Shaikh’s personal qualities. On both these points we require fuller information. While lam unable to submit more than the general lines of the policy on which I venture to think we should embark, I can, with some confidence, state that the present seems a favourable opportunity for the inception of that policy. Shaikh Abdullah bin Jasim bin Thani has recently addressed an appeal for advice to Khan Saheb Yusuf bin Ahmad Kanoo which seems to me to show the great need in which he stands of assistance, and how fully he realises that need. A translation of this appeal was hurriedly transmitted to me at the moment of clos ing the mails by the Political Agent and, though the English is crude and faulty, evidently clerk’s work, as I have not the original Arabic to refer to, I have con sidered it advisable to enclose a true copy as an appendix to this report. The meaning is clear enough. The answer I propose to send to this appeal is indicated in the following paragraph. Your telegram No. 588-S., dated August 18th, to my address appears to put the possibility of my making any long stay at Katar out of the question. I would therefore propose to leave the report on the questions I have indicated to the Poli tical Agent, Bahrain. Should he form a favourable opinion of the Shaikh’s quali fications and power to rule, he might then sound him as to what form of support would be most useful to him and report, giving at the same time his own opinion. He might also indicate confidentially to the Shaikh the nature of the payment in the shape of a treaty which we shall at the proper time when the Shaikh’s power is firmly established, require for our services {vide enclosures to my No. Cf. 52, dated 21st July 1914). Captain Keyes has so far had only a comparatively limited experience of Arab Chiefs but, since his arrival at Bahrain, he has thrown himself con amove into all the questions connected with his charge, and I consider that he can safely be relied on to form an accurate estimate of the qualifications and necessities of Shaikh Abdullah. He will, I hope, receive valuable assistance from Khan Saheb Yusuf bin Ahmad Kanoo. Should, therefore, the Government of India agree generally with the conclu sions I have reached in the above statement of the Katar problem, I have the honour to request that I may be favoured with sanction to the despatch of Captain Keyes on the mission I have assigned to him. On receipt of this sanction Captain Keyes, to whom a copy of this letter is being forwarded, could arrange by corre spondence for a meeting with Shaikh Abdullah bin Jasim bin Thani when I could place the R. I. M. S. “ Lawrence ” at the disposal of the Political Agent for the pur poses of the meeting. APPENDIX. Translation of a note attached to a letter from Shaikh Abdullah bin Jasim al Thani to Haji Yusuf bin Ahmad Kanoo of Bahrain- A.C. In these days you informed me that you had some opinion and views con cerning my interest. I had been waiting for it from you. Now some friction has occurred from the side of my cousins. My brother Khalifah is with them in this matter. The cause of all this is that I do not agree with them in high-handedness. They do not care for a woman or a subject or any foreigner. Daily they commit more and more high-handedness. I do not agree with them at all, because such things do not last long. If right is proved against one I wish to make him to pay it according to justice, they stand up against it and insist in not paying up the right.fo) zc 7 Neither they nor Khalifah will pay. All this time I had been trying to facilitate and brush up the matter, thinking that perchance God will lead them to the right path. Their opinion is that of Khalifah’s. This intrigue has made the thing worse. Now I have shown myself angry with them. Possibly they will collect and come to me. Khalifah may or may not come with them. But if they com 3 , they will say something of high-handedness as mischief is their habit and they would not leave such a habit on which they had been brought up. Perhaps you will hear from some people that I wish to change my residence from here to another place. Mind that won’t be right. Ncr that my object is. I consult you and ask you to let me know what your opinion and view is. I cannot do without your opinion in this and other matters. I will afterwards make up my opinion. Kindly write good advice. This is secret.

The impact of this development upon relations between Bin Saud and the British Government generally is also discussed, notably the need to maintain neutrality in the conflict between him and the Ottomans. This discussion includes mention of the importance of maintaining the independence of Qatar and the states of the Trucial Coast vis-à-vis Bin Saud.The correspondence in the file is primarily between officials at the Political Residency in Bushire, the Government of India's Foreign Department and the Political Agency in Bahrain but also includes a limited amount of correspondence (in English translation) between Bin Saud and British officials.In addition to correspondence, the file contains a document entitled 'Memorandum of Interview with Bin Saud on 15th-16th December 1913' written by the Political Agent in Bahrain, Arthur Prescott Trevor, and the Political Agent in Kuwait, William Henry Irvine Shakespear (folios 24-25).The file contains an index on folio 2 that lists all the letters contained in the file with details of the correspondents and the date.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>District Magistrate, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>King of Saudi Arabia 'Abd al-'Azīz bin 'Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa'ūd</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Al-Hasa</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Qatar</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Bilateral relations</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000257#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
