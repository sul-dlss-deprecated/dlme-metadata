MIDDLE EAST POSITION The Board of Trade announces that, although the import licensing regu lations in force in Middle East tem- tories continue, it will no longer be necessary to obtain a Middle East Supply Centre recommendation to cover Impofts^ except of certain goods. Items of principal interest to U.K. exporters which .remain under control are textiles of all kinds and a few types of machinery. Other types of machi nery, iron and steel and hand and machine tools are, however, among^tbe goods no longer subject' to Mid f ^e East Supply Centre procedure,No. log* -36/43(a) THE POLITICAL AG^TCY PAH JAIN.

Dear Mr. Morley, I premised to let you have some information about the arrangements made during the past year to provide for the Persian G-ulf area. I apologise again for being so slew about this. In January, 1945, vve made a special release of 10 tons of cotton to cover supplies of piece goods to the Persian Gulf. At that time there were a number of outstanding recommendations from the Political Resident, and though, as you know, these recommendations were simply shipping priorities ana did not guarantee that supplies would be forthcoming, we agreed to release a quantity which seemed sufficient to give these recommendations clearance. % In adaition, in May, 1945, approximately 1 ton was supplied to the Persian Gulf from stock held by one of the normal exporters to that area. (The same firm has supplied from stock on several previous occasions). A further special release of 5 tons was made for the Persian Gulf in September, 1945, to clear more outstanding Political Resident*s recommendations. I am not sure, incidentally, exactly what your interest is in this: am I to understand that the Indian Supply Commission have undertaken the resx^onsibility for this area? Yours sincerely, (Sd.) Marion Y/ard. G.R. Morley, Rsq., The High Commissioner for India, Inuia Supply Ccmuiaion, 45/47, Mount Street, .V. 1 .I.S.C, 1684 February, 1 Miss M. Vfard, Board of Trade, Millbank, London a S.V/.1. Dear Miss Ward, In your letter CKT.17/4-6 dated 28th January, about cotton textiles for Bahrein, you asked whether the India Supply Cannission have undertaken the responsibility for the Persian G-ulf area. We are now sponsoring such demands for the Persian G-ulf as require official support. !e have taken over from the India Office work in connection with supplies for India and this arrangement has been extended to cover supplies to the Persian Gulf also. The former procedure whereby imports to the Persian Gulf were covered by Essentiality Recanmenoations issued by the Political Resident and endorsed by the Governuent of India, followed by a letter of shipping support issued by the India Office, was dis-continued as from the 14th December, 1945* An announcement to this effect appeared in the Board of Trade journal where it was stated that applications for Export Licences should henceforth be made to the Export Licensing Department and not to the India Office. We do not therefore consider it to be likely that except perhaps in exceptional cases, we shall have to undertake sponsorship of individual orders for the Persian Gulf* There may, however, be cases of a more general nature where help is required to obtain certain supplies for the Persian Gulf and in these cases we shall do what we can to help. The present case of cotton textiles xor Bahrein is an instance/ The shortage of cotton textiles has been brought to our notice in connection with Bahrein only, and my original enquiry too was confined to Bahrein, which is xor this/&lt; t this purpose probably the most important of the Persian Gulf territories. It seems likely that conditions similar to those in Bahrein would prevail in the other territories and our further efforts might therefore be directed towards improvising supplies for all the Persian G-ulf territories rather than for Bahrein only. It seems to me fairly clear that the releases for the Persian G-ulf area mentioned in your letter have not been sufficient to meet legitimate requirements. I enclose a copy of a letter dated 23rd November to Mr. Dalrymple-Belgrave, Advisor to the Bahrein G-overnment, explaining the difficulties encountered and stressing the inadequacy of supplies. t ii e are, of course, unable to make supplies available fron the allocation of cotton textiles for export to India. This allodation *is intended, to meet the needs of India alone incidentally it is inadequate for w the purpose - and is confined to special qualities whereas I imagine the needs of the Persian G-ulf area are for a general range of textiles. I should be grateful for your views as to whether it would e advisable to ask the Textile Sub-Committee for a special 1 location for the Persian Gulf, cr whether you would be able ;o meet these requirements by special releases as her ^°^ e - ^ « it would be as ,ell if we were f f .robable requirements froa the ^°f *fefore 3 te le sraphin^ for an ■here is to be formal allocation but beiore teles, .

Dalyrample Belgrave, Hsq., G.B.fi,, LONDON, Dear Mr. Belgrave, I would like to confirm a conversation I had with you In London, in which I explained the difficulty which we are experiencing in arranging shipments of Textiles to Bahrein. Proa the beginning of the ttar, it has been most difficult to satisfy the requirement;* of this Uiorket. In the first place, the Authorities on this side did not apparently take into consideration the fact that there was such a territory as Bahrein, and for many months there was confusion as to whether this territory should come under the Jurisdiction of the M.iS.S.C. cr the India Office. Ultimately it was decided, and rightly so, that Bahrein under the Jurisdiction of the India *jffios. J^Q&amp; that time, difficulties were to a certain extent simplified, as in s far as cotton and woollen textiles were concerned, it was^ agreed that if our clients could secure a reccmaendation frcm th&amp; political Resident in Bahrein, and same was supported by th Indian Governaent at New Delhi, a Letter of Shipping As sis tana would ultimately be issued to us by the India Office in London. As however this procedure entailed delays of several months, you can appreciate the difficulties with which b®th we and our clients were confronted, particularly as even when the India ^office Letters of Shipping Assignee were in possession, it still remained to secure goods which coula be exported to this particular market. BetweeVt ■ ‘ ■ t • • t ~ H t A Between i$h2 a nd ^944 the Cotton Board were agreeable, under Instructions from the Board of Trade, to permit shipments of Cotton Textiles which has been-produ^d in the country prior to the allocation system ccuing into force. (The allocation system came into force early in 1940 ^ u t no raw material was released, it meant that the only goods that could be shipped were those stocks which were available, and which the manufacturers .ere prepared to dispose of without obtaining replacement. As, however, the Cotton Beard themselves v»re offering replacement against any stocks offered to them to is utilised for Relief Shipments to various territories, you can readily understand the impossibility of securing any substantial weight for our Bahrein customers. Throughout this period we were, and still are, receiving Letters of Shipping Assistance freu the India Office, covering many tons on Textiles, but from where are these goods to be obtained? From the end of 1944* it is true the Cotton Board / agreed to issue an allocation to ourselves and bthef recognised exporters fof the Bahrein market, but the total quantity is negligible compared with essential needs of this market. In fact the only raw material that has so far been released to us, and we fully believe that we have received; the bulk of the allocations for this market, are as followsj- [ November 1944* Approximately 4 tons. j. » February 1945 ' 2 tons. With this small wei^it it is of course qp.iite impossible to satisfy the demands of our friends in this market, or for that matter, to re-establish these qualities of Lancashire Piece Goods, which were so well liked by the Bahrein native population in the past. ! w t We/ t e Cffe firmly believe that the native population is being caused c nsiderablc haz*dship on account of the lack of suppHea fraa this country, and although we have repeatedly heard, arguaents put forward by the Authorities on this side that Bahrein onn and should be sup])lied by India, we know £t(Xbl our own experience that it is quite impossible for India to manufacture those specified lines which are an intrinsic part territories came under the jurisdiction of the no such difficulties in covering for these uarket* s reculrafemts were experienced. In fact, on receipt of a U.K.C.O. Confii\afttion of a Pricrity A. I^^ort Licence, the Cotton Board on this side automatically released sufficient yarn to cover the weight stated on ths Import Licence in qua ation. If the same procedure had been adopted in regard to Bahrein, and Inula office Letters of Shipping Assistance considered on a par with U«X«C.C. Confirmations, then no such difficulties as the above would have boen experienced. the India Office, as we firmly believe that if the necessary approach is made to the Caameroial Relations and Treaties Department of ths Board of Trade, they will realise that the Bahrein market is not receiving ©ijuitable treatment. We make tills statement knowing full well the enormous demands which are being L^ade from all quarters of the world on Lancashire at the present time. We feel, however, Bahrein is being neglected owing to the fact that It has not in the past been considered sufficiently important to warrant the personal attention which in our opinion it fully deserves. ws In so far as your own requirements are oonoernad, we would explain that there is little possibility of being able to satisfy same, unless an allocation is given to us by the Cotton Board to enable the production of the qualities in question* a ' We would, therefore, suggest that you ask the India Office to make this position clear to the Authorities on this side, ^ as we are convince d that if the Board of Trade will support the applications made to them by the India Office, the Cotton Board will then receive the necessary authorisation to release the raw material to us* Yours faithfully, t ■ * (Sd. ) p.p* J.M* hHASHA.

Dear Hiss Heady, Will you please rei’or to Hiss Cutcliffes letter of 14th Hay reference I.S.^KHX/CO/BA about supplies of cotton textiles to the Persian Gulf. We are somewhat taken aback to learn that there has been no release of cotton for this area since September 1945, and should like to lend our sup; art to the request for a special release to cover outs tan dire orders. With regard to the future requirements of the Persian Gulf area, we are ready, if it is considered desirable, to ask the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf for an estimate of future requirements in order that a ereoiaj allocation may be made or some other arrangement arrived at which would meet this case. I see no reason to suppose that such an estimate would be unreliable. X am sending a copy of this letter to Itiss Cutcliff® at the Inaia Supply Commission. Yours sincerely, • &gt;. A. K.

I have been in touch with Mr. Hamersley of the Cotton Board and he tells me that no further special releases have been made for Bahrein and that as the Open Export Scheme for Period I, 1946, has only just closed he cannot yet say whether any supplies for Bahrein have been booked by converters during this period. Unless any such supplies have been booked it would appear from Miss Ward's letter of 25 th January that there has been no release of/ cotton for the Persian Gulf area since September, 1945* P ^ 3 . The External Department, India Office, has again been in touch with us regarding the serious shortage of supplies of cotton textiles for Bahrein, and I should be grateful to know whether it is now possible to arrange with the Cotton Board for releases to cover any outstanding orders fnorn the Persian Gulf, and particularly Bahrein. 4 . Also I should be glad to know whether, in future, you will be able to meet the requirements of this area by special releases as previously or what alternative you would propose for meeting the requirements of the Persian Gulf area. We should be reluctant to have to ask the Textile Sub-Committee for a special allocation since this would, presumably, necessitate a cumbersome enquiry through the TOlitical Resident which would probably produce a highly unreliable estimate of requirements. The free pool / arrangements( « ' airrangeraents seem to us to hold out little hope of satisfaction for the trade in this area, since U,K* suppliers are likely to use material available to them from this source for building up more profitable lines of business. 5 .

Brotherton and Co. to Bahrein. The matter has been taken up with the firm and it is hoped that there will be no repetition. Apparently the unfortunate statements arose from there being Indian stamps on the envelope and as the firm are now«ll established in other markets, they did not wish to undertake fresh business in the Persian Gulf area. I should be glad, however, if you would convey to the Political Resident our thanks for the useful information supplied concerning Bahrein. Yours sincerely, (Sgd• A.G. Watson. F.A.K.

Description of enclosure. Name and date Subject. Minutes of F&lt; )od Meeting held on Thursday, 28th September 1950. V Reference to previous correspondence\f Minutes of Pood Meeting held on Thursday, 28th September, 1950. The meetting was called in order to discuss a complaint which was made by owners of gardens to the effect that the sale of Bahrain dates was being adversely affected by the Government granting barter and excemption from customs duty upon imported.dates, which come from Basra. The matter was very fully discussed. Between 75,000 and 90,000 Ratali (84 lbs) of imported dates are required each year to provide for local consumption. The normal Bahrain date crop provides sufficient dates for 3-6 months of the year. Dates are one of the main foods of Bahrain and are used by people of all classes, rich and poor. Any change in the present arrangement, which is in fact in the nature of a subsidy by the Government, costing the Government about one lakh a year, intended to encourage the import of dates and to keep the price of dates and the cost of living low, would result in higher prices for Bahrain dates. The persons who would benefit by this are few and those who benefit from dates being cheap are almost the whole population of the country. It was unanimously decided that for the present there should be no change in the existing arrangement. If large quantities of Basra dates arrived the question of then allowing the export of local dates might be considered. Other matters which came up for discussion were, the export of wood, for building. It was agreed that merchants holding large stocks of wood would be allowed to export wood to Saudi Arabia where the demand is high. There was a discussion about meat prices, it was agreed that the situation was unsatisfactory because the meat business was a close company consisting of brokers and butchers who now and in the past control the meat sales. The committee decided to take action against the butchers if they failed to lower prices in accordance with the recent large imports of meat. Matters of general interest were considered including the effect of the order announcing the increased rice ration, from 6 to 10 lbs. per month per head, which it is confidently expected will cause a sharp drop in the price of privately owned rice in the bazaar. There were comments upon the criticism of the committee by merchants who resented the reduction in maximum profits from 25$ to 10$. It was learned that since the news of the Korea war was better more steady prices ruled in the bazaar and the rush to buy goods for hoarding had stopped. The meeting closed at about 11.45 a.m., the chairman having left somewhat eqrlier.^ IVvu.

Until the whole matter is clarified, I am not prepared to help in hny way, and when^ or if it is. I am inclined to think that the Qatar Government should buy the proper quota (15 tons a month?) and distribute it itself - but perhaps the ability to do this would be too much to hope for from such a primitive administration. At any rate I see no reason why we should help Abdullah Darwish to work another ramp. * P ro -ft Co O f ) 3050.
