A copy of the political agreement can be found at folios 65-66. The negotiations ultimately concluded an exploration permit for the Shaikh’s territory; with an allowance within the permit to a subsequent agreement for drilling and exploitation should the results of the exploration be favourable.Also included is correspondence regarding the Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr [Sulṭān bin Saqr Āl Qasimī], Ruler of Sharjah’s refusal to undertake the previously agreed exchange of letters, including his attempt to reword one of the letters, and potential measures that could be used to compel him to complete the exchange prior to his eventual agreement and formal completion of the Sharjah Concession Agreement. A printed copy of the concession agreement, political agreement and letters exchanged can be found at folios 92-101.Further correspondence relates to the question of the political agreement and whether the agreement of the Trucial Coast Shaikh’s to such an agreement is necessary.The correspondence concludes that the agreement does not require the Shaikh’s approval however as Dubai and Sharjah had both previously agreed to the political agreement and the Regent of Kalba was happy to agree to it as part of the concession it was not necessary to take any action on the matter at that time. Also discussed is the requirement for HMG approval to the establishment of a bank as part of the agreement and whether this was necessary; and the movements of the Standard Oil Company of California and the likelihood that they were using their alleged interest in Trucial Coast Oil Concessions to improve their chances of obtaining a concession in the unallotted area in Bahrain.Other matters discussed in the volume include:attempts at re-opening negotiations with Shaikh Shakhbut bin Sultan [Shaikh Shakhbūt bin Sulṭān bin Zāyid Āl Nahyān], Ruler of Abu Dhabi, and the Shaikh’s insistence in writing that he was not bound by His Majesty’s Government approval and was free to negotiate with whomever he wished;a conversation between the India Office and Hamilton Ballantyne of the Bahrain Petroleum Company (BAPCO) regarding representatives of the Shaikh of Bahrain (Shaikh Ḥamad bin ‘Īsá Āl Khalīfah) having alluded to the Shaikh’s desire to grant a concession for the remaining unallotted area of his territory to BAPCO but fearing that he would lose control of the Hawar Islands if he did so;Petroleum Concessions Limited’s interest in a negotiating concession for the territory of Kalba [Kalbā] with Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmad bin Sultan [Shaikh Khālid bin Aḥmad bin Sulṭān Āl Qasimī], Regent to Shaikh Hamad bin Said [Shaikh Ḥamad bin Sa‘īd Āl Qasimī] who was a minor. The correspondence discusses the actual extent of Kalba territory; Shaikh Khalid’s desire to create a combined Qawasim [Qawāsim] Shaikhdom with himself as ruler and his close relations with the Bani Chittab [Beni Qitab] tribe; and the concession agreement that was reached between the two parties;printed summary issued by the Petroleum Department of His Majesty’s Government detailing petroleum developments in the Arabian Peninsula in relation to Petroleum Concessions Limited (folios 103-105, 127-129).A series of file notes which were maintained as a record of the correspondence in the volume can be found at folios 196-203.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Petroleum Concessions Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Trucial Coast, Sharjah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Abu Dhabi, Āl Nahyān dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Ra's al-Khaymah, Āl Qāsimī dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Regent of Kalba</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Sharjah, Āl Qāsimī dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Abu Dhabi</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Ras al Khaimah</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Sharjah</topic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Kalba</topic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Ra's al-Khaymah</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00028d#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00028d#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00028d#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
