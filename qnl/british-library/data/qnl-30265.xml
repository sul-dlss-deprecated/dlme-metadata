(b) The election of a Deputy from Mukran to the Majlis was held again under the supervision of igha Didar, appointed by the Central Government. Agha Murad Khan Reki having procured 8660 votes against Agha Arbab Ibdid Mehdi’s 7868, was declared by the Central Election Committee at Iranshahr as elected to the Majlis as the Deputy from Mukran. As a result of the kidnapping and murder of 4gha Farukhzad, the agent of Agha Arbab Mehdi, Murad Khan , s election has so far not been approved by the Majlis as they seem to think that he was implicated in the kidnapping and murder of Agha Farukhzad. A Court of Enquiry headed by Sartip Ghulam Ali 4nsari has recently been sent to Mukran from Tehran to enquire into the kidnapping and murder of Agha Farukhzad. The result of the inquiries made by the Court of Snnuiry is anxiously awaited by the Rekls and other Baluch tribes of central and southern Mukran# As an attempt towards the pacification of the tribes in Mukran, the Central Government have permitted ^ardar Juma Khan ^smailzai to return to his home at Shorn. He fought against the Persian Government about 8 years ago, escaped to British Baluchistan and was later allowed to return to Persia and kept under military surveillance at Isfahan and Shiraz. His presence among his tribesmen will, it is hoped, act as a check on their unlawful activities. (d).

Doubtful of the loyalty of the Rekis and aware of the unrest in central Mukran, the Persian authorities concerned are moving troops southwards (para 1(a) refers) as a precautionary measure* (b) Boad 3acurltv.

Tha ^nd July 1945. ^ T)-,sb-q Appreciation o** xn« Political situation in tha province of Wokran for the half year ending 194 5 ths 30th Juno 1945. i. ttzmsvzmii (a) According to the provincial division of Persia for administrative purposes, ’hakran fore’s part of the 8th tfstan, and, as sveh, tha Farmandar for Mnkran should be subordinate to the Governor General for Kerman# A deoartur* from this procedure can only ba aauctioned by the Majliss# but with the help of his father-ir-lavr, the late H#n# Amir Ibrahim Alam 3haukat-ia--*ulF of Birjand who oxercised considerable influence at the contra, Agha /fenir Hussejjn Khozeimah Alam, Farmandar for T hikran# has boon successfully defying the authority of successive Governors General at Kerman and keeping himsolf more or loss independent of them since his appointment to tho post in 1340. tf5.th tho changed conditions consequent on the death of H#E# Amir Ibrahim Alam, it soamed likely that in accordance with tho representations made in the natter to the Contra! Oovomaicnt by the Governor General Kerman, the Farmandar for Mukran would once more be made subordinate to Kerman. Agha Amir Hussein left for Tehran about 4 months ago to arrange for Mukran to remain an independent Farraandari directly responsible to the Central Government. Ho was later joined by Ms brother-in-law toir Assaduilah Alan?, and by Agha Amir Ismail Khan. Farmandar of Zabul, Tho party is still at Tehran and it is probable that if their combined efforts fail to keep Kulcran independrnt, Agha Arir Hussein may be transferred elscwhorc. Igha ^mir Ismail Khan is being mentioned as a possible successor. (b) During the period under report the Headquarters of the Gendarmerie in Mukran \tgtc transferred from Iranshahr to Zahidon. 2 . (a) ihere has been no change for the better in the general character of the administration. Ctovommant officials are as corrupt and vanal as over. Aeons*'omed to Reza 3hah f s iron rule for so long, the official classes are taking full advantage of tho change at tho centre and go much their own way. Consci^uontly tho general efficiency of all Government Departmonts, including tho Array, has greatly deteriorated since the establishment of tne present regime. Many Persians &gt;vho fail to obtain justice or redress from the various Persian departments, earnestly hope for enforcement of stricter control over all departments with a view to the inprovoraont of their general efficiency. In fact many have been heard to remark that a constitutional Government like the present one does not suit the Persian character. They think that the country needs a dictator like Beza Shah to guide its destiny. (b) Ilukrnn so far remains unreprnsented in the 14th Majlis at Tehran. Owing to the intrigue of the wealthy and influential Arbab Mg hoi, who hlnself contested'the election tha credentials of Agha Murad Khan Raki, issued in his favour by the Central Flection Committee of Mukran on the rasujt of the noil,have recently been cancelled, by the Majliss. *©fi) 2 . By his Improper interference in the elections in favour of Agha Arbab Mehdi t by whom he is reported to have been bribed heavily, Agha Amir Hussein, Farmandar for Mukrar has estranged the Rekls - the most powerful tribe in Mukran from which about 70% of the Gendarmerie in Mukran are drawn-from the Government* The Court of Enquiry, headed by Sartip Ghulam All Ansari, which visited Jfukran during the second half of 1944 failed to find anything Incriminating against any of the Rekis in connection with the murder of Agha Farrukhzad, the Agent of Agha Arbab Mehd5 but it encouraged the harrassment and intimidation of the Rekls by local officials and is said to have recommended the removal of several influential Rekis from Mukran* The oppressive policy adopted by the authorities concerned towards the Rekis goaded them into attempting to migrate enmasse to British Baluchistan in January 1946* This was prevented by the timely intervention of some influential Rekis at the request of the G*O.C* Kerman* The situation soon returned to the normal, but the Military Authorities, who are the virtual rulers of greater part of the Central and Southern Mukran, retaliated by stopping payment of political allowances paid to various tribal leaders in Mukran* It is reported that Agha Arbab Mehdi and *gha Murad Khan Reki are trying to compose their differences and to come to an agreement with regard to the election of a Deputy to the Majlis from Mukran. If successful this may eventually help to improve the relations between the Persian Government and the Rekis, and the security situation in ?£ukran* 3. fignaral prosperity or otherwise of the traders, land lords and the peasantry* (a) Mukran depends entirely on India for the import of its requirements of cloth, sugar, tea,spices etc* It is customary to blame the Indian export restrictions for the acute shortage of these commodities* but the blame should, at least, be shared by the Persian Government who delay the release of goods from the Zahidan Customs for periods which sometimes extend to years* For instance, no licences for the export of cloth for the period under review have yet been received! in spite of this over 800,000 yards of Indian cloth are still frozen in the Customs* It was anticipated that on the collapse of Germany, the import of various commodities from abroad would be possible within a reasonably short time* Consequently prices of imported articles fell considerably* Owing to lack of shipping space and the non-relaxation of export trade regulations in the exporting countries, the hopes of the traders have not m*t6rialised* Prices have therefore risen again although they have not touched the previous high levels* The traders who have been fortunate enough to be alloted a share of the quota of export of cloth to Persia have made good profits | the cloth being bought and sold many times while still in the Customs custody. On the other hand the traders engaged An the export trade have suffered losses during the period under report because the price of various commodities such as almonds, almond kernels, pistachio nuts, carraway seeds etc t fell owing to war situation before the goods could be transported to to their destinations in India from Zahidan by the Railway which was handicapped by shortage of wagons* Traders are therefore now anxiously looking forward to utopian days when trade wftll be free and the export restrictions now in force will be abolished f3. EXT 47 '7 if © area to the (b) The land lord class In Mukran especially Zabul has prospered during the period undey report* Owing shortage of grain in Iran and the hi the black market f the land owning cli principal grain producing centres of Iran f has made fortunes while the peasant class has been hard hit by the abnormal rise in the price of all essential imported article! U* V/’ /XXig vHXj gh priCH^it fetched in ksv Zabul^ef the The bread situation in the chief towns of the province has on the whole been satisfactory, and the price of Government controlled bread has been practically static* Zahldan and Khwash depend for their supplies of v/heat on Zabul* The harvest this spring is reported in some parts of Zabul area as good but in others it is said to be below the normal. Only 1600 tons of wheat are to be collected against Tahods from the Zabul area from this yea^s harvest for the use of the civilian populations of Zahldan and Khwash* The collection this year is to be made by the Revenue Department and not by the representative of Messrs K.B* Sheikh Faiz Muhammad A Sons as last year* This will givs the officials concerned the chance of H squeejEing H the small farmers and lining their own pockets* Government Departments (Army, Amnieh ) are making their own arrangements for supply* The majority of the land lords in Zabul area are worried over the opening of the Bohara canal in Afghan territory adjoining Selstan, which is now nearing completion* When working it will draw off a large part of the water of the Helmand to irrigate land in Afghanistan, and leave very little water for irrigating the land in Zabul area* They think that this will mean a great decrease in the area under cultivation in Zabul and may eventually result in large number of Zabulis migrating to Afghanistan. Swarms of deselrt locusts from the Oman and Fars visited Mukran in March this year and laid eggs in the vicinity of Iranshahr, Bampur. Sarbaz, Khwash f Mir,1awa,Zahidan and Zabul. Steps were taken by the Persian authorities concerned for the destruction of the eggs and hoppers and the menace was dealt with effectively* Very little damage was done to standing crops* 4 * msiQ Mm Owing to distrust between smugglers in British Baluchistan and smugglers on this side of the border, large scale smuggling of prohibited goods from British Baluchistan to Persia via the Mirjawa frontier and Afghanistan has practically ceased* During the period under report about 25000 tins of Anglo Iranian Oil Company^ petrol and kerosene oil were smuggled to Afghanistan via Zabul. These were mostly purchased by smugglers from the A«I*0«C* office at Zahldan and its agenda at Khwash and Zabul at rates varying from Rials 150 to 200 per tin. The cost of the petrol thus sold was credited to the A.I.0.C at the rate of Rials 78 per tin and the balance was pocketed by the officials concerned* As a result of enquiries made, the Manager of the Anglo Iranian Oil Company at Zahidan was held responsible for the sale of the greater portion of the petrol thus smuggled to Afghanistan, and was consequently dismissed* 5. BRITISH INTERESTS ‘ j Sardars and important land lords in the Zabul area, who remember the benefits they received during the last war, cannot help feeling that the British Government has now los interest in Selstan* One and all draw a contrast between tJ /Consulate4. Consulate in its hey-day and the rather decrepit appearance it now hears| the opening of the boviot Consular gencyf which is well supplied with money, does not help the comparison. The Reki tribe which inhabits the country around Mirjawa and Khwash on the borders of British Baluchistan rendered valuable services to the British Government during the war 1914-18. The Chief of the tribe, Sardar Taj uohamad Khan, undertook responsibility for the security of the line of communication from Mirjawa to Hormuk. His son Ttehrullah Khan, the present chief of the tribe is friendly towards the British Government and always turns to Brioish officials for advice and help in times of neod and stress. The policy of appression lately adopted by the Persian autiiorxt.ies against this tribe is in fact an i^ irGC t.result of some of the leading members of the tribe being friendly with British officials. 6. RUSSIAN ACTIVITIB&amp; For some time the Russians have been trying to start a branch of the M Hizb Tudeh* in Zabul, and are now taking an increased Interest in the affairs of the tribes in Mukran. The Russian Consular Agent at Zabul occasionally visits Zahidan, Khwash, Iranshahr and Sarawan, and, in addition o the distribution of propaganda material, is known on more than one occasion to have contacted tribal leaders and to have assured them of the syppathy of the Russian people towards them in their distress caused by the shortage of commodities such as sugar, tea. cloth etc in their area, giving out promises of alleviating this by sending sunplies In the near future. (How he proposes to do this is not clear) Consular Agent undertook an extensive tour of the villages in the Zabul area recently. Everywhere he contacted the cultivators and drew a contrast between the privileges enjoyed by the Russian farm workers and the conditions under which they themselves lived and worked for their land lords. This was greatly resented by the land lord class in Zabul. A Russian reading room was opened at Zabul during the period under report, and recently the Russian Consular Agent explored the possibility of opening one at Zahidan as well. Efforts are being made o open a night class for teaching Russian at Zabul and to arrange for meetings to be held weekly in the Reading Room at which discussions will be held about Islam as practised by fcfUslims in Russia and the privileges enjoyed by them under the Union. It is also proposed that general questions concerning agriculture will be discussed at these meetings for the benefit of the agriculturists. Russian agents are active in Mukran disseminating Russian propaganda and trying to win over the working classes by painting bright pictures of the future it only they look to the Russians for the solution of their difficulties. To substantiate this statement the Soviet Consular Agent at Zabul has helped Shah Quli Khan ^arabandl, a local garage erwner who works for the Russians and whose father served the British Government as a Resaldar of the Levies in the last Great War, to aemiire about 200 acres of irrigable land from the local Revenue Department. It is difficult to see the object of many of these activities, some of which defeat their own end by arousing resentment. It Is apparent, however, that they are approved, by the higher authorities, as contact has been maintained /with5* @(v) \fllth tha Russian Consular Agent by other Russians on tour the Consul General, Joshed, a locust officer, an Intelligence Officer etc* It is possible that much of the activity Is deliberately provocative, purely in order to arouse British suspicion, and increase its nuisance value* Kor example the recent photographing of Mirjawa aerodrome (from the ground) by a Russian Intelligence Officer, can have been of little military value* 7. ROAD SKCURm Road security deteriorated in ttakran during the period under report. Although six of the robbers responsible for a hold up on the Zahidan-Meshed road were shot in Zahidan in January 1945 (in circumstances of considerable brutality; their execution did not help to improve the security situation in Mukren as was anticipated* During the period two ^hold ups H of lorries t»ore staged by armed robbers on the Zahidan-Meshed road* No loss of life resulted and as usual the Gendarmerie sent in their pursuit failed to contact the robbers, who are believed to have been Ismailzais from Shelag in Afghanistan* 8. AflMV (a) Rumours war© heard during the period under report that conscription was to be introduced in the tribal area of Mukran very shortly, but nothing has so far happened* During his recent tour of Mukran, the G.O.C* Kerman Division asked several tribal chiefs to produce conscripts for the army, to which they are said to have replied that they rould do so only if the Rekis did first* (b) Inspite of the presence of the American Advisers, who do their best to prevent peculation, army commanders in the area continue to make money at the expense of the soldiery under their command* During his recent tour of Wukr Mukran, the G*0*C . Kerman detected an embezzlement of 160 kharwars of wheat from military stocks by the ^ Military Commandant at Khwash. The G.O.C • found the soldie^ at Khwash and Iranshahr half starved and the animals reduced to mere skeletons, as the rations and fodder had not been issued according to tNr scale eaitefcioned since the present Commandant Sarhang Shahindeh took over as Military Commandant at Khwash* He found the medical arrangements at Iranshahr most unsatisfactory and the garrison depleted in numbers by illness and disease* On the whole the disciplilie and the morale of the Persian troops is very low* 9 . smwj &amp;m m Mirjawa- The maintenance of the/Birjand and Zahidan-Keraan roads has been carried out during the period under report by the British Military Authorities. The Khwash-Chahbar and the Zabul road are being maintained by the Persian Road Department* The former still remains impassable for wheeled traffic beyond Iranshahr and there is no likelihood of its being repaired in the near future. The latter is motorable but is deteriorating steadily. The United Kingdom Commercial Corporation finally closed down during the period under report, and, as a result, the transportation of passengers between Znhidan and Meshed has become very difficult* The Road Transport Board Trucks and a few other trucks released by the U*K.C.C are still working on the road, but the lack of reliable transport is being felt everywhere.10. WEST ^ REFORMS continue to be popular with the officials with and the wealthy only. SOne oif tribal chiefs in Mukran occasionally dress in tyle Ccne Sardars invariably ask one for help in obtaining cloth for new suits) and the tribal elders no longer object to their young men joining the Gendarmerie shaving their beards wearing uniforms and hats of European style. It take long time for the tribesmen to take to European dress, as firstly the adoption of European dress demands a standard or living much higher than they can afford, and secondly they find their present dress more suitable and convenient for the kind of life they lead. 11* ffB ACT IQffS TQ JCM-1A B During the period under report Nazi Croi*many , s unconditional surrender to the Allies broiight the hostilities in Europe to a successful conclusion. This was warmly greeted by all classes and shades of opinion among the Persians in the hope that it would bring about a relaxation of restrictions on exports of essential commodities to Persia from the countries concerned and help to ease the difficult situation created by the high cost of lining in this tne second most expensive country in the world.

As far as Seistan is concerned, the most significant event has been the official recognition in Seistan given by H.I.M. the Shah to Amir Asadullah Alam, son of the late H.E.

This change is not looked upon with favour either by the local authorities or by the local population, possibly because of the fear of associating Seistan affairs with those of * eshed which is considered to be under Soviet influence# 2.

Ql. Tiw Mth term of the Majliss at Tehran has exolred without a Deputy from l.ukran having been elected. The Persian uovernment have now declared their^intention of postponing, until after the evacuation of^allied armies from Persia, tne holding of elections to the 15th Me.lliss. Agha Arbab ^ehdi who fought Arha Murad Khan Heki in the last elections proposes to stand again and has already sent his agents to do propaganda on his behalf in Central and outhern rukran.

The enforcement of the Foreign Exchange Control Law has also served as a check on smuggling because of the difficulty of making payment in rupees for foods received. Petrol and kerosene oil are still being smuggled to Afghanistan from Zabul* S. B^ITISTi INTERESTS The evacuation of East Persia by the British Military forces was completed on the 2c&lt;nd December 1945. The aerodromes and alD military buildings at Mlrjawa and Zahidan were made \ over intact to the Persian military authorities. This has created a very favourable impression among Persians of all classes who are now convinced that, unlike their northern neighbours who are said to be attempting to assert their right to keep their military forces in Persia even after the 2. 2nd March 1946, the British will evacuate Persia by the 2nd of March as provided in the Treaty of Alliance signed In 1942. The evacuation has also caused a temporary boom in the private incomes of local officials who are busy selling the assets left behind for which they do not have to account 6. RUSSIAN ACTIVITIES The efforts made by the Soviet Consular Agent at Sabul to start branches of the Hizb-i-Tudeh at Zabul and Zahidan have failed. Although the plight of the peasant class in Seistan p ovides ample ground for revolutionary propaganda directed by the Soviet Consular Agent, it has so far been successfully countered by the power and influence of the Sardars and land lords who have realised that their personal interests are at stake and that if Russian propaganda among the peasant* class bore fruit it would mean thair own downfall. Events in the north have left no doubt in the minds of the people as to the intentions of the Russians, and although a little success has been achieved in Seisten at the wxfMKSM cost of considerable sums of money, the Persian of average intelligence has come to consider the Russian as his enemy. The failure of the Russian class, and the fall in the attendance of the Russian Heading room at Zabul, are indications of the feelings harboured by educated Persians for the Russians. Reports have also been received during the period under report of the Russians having brought small arms to Zabul from Meshed in covered military trucks and of their having distributed some to the followers of Sardar Mohammad Roza Purdili. These arms have presumably been distributed by the Russians with the intention of preparing the way for armed opposition to the present Government if ever suitable opporttnity offerred. But it is doubtful if an armed uprising in Seistan would meet with success in face of the overwhelming opposition from the great majority of the Sardars. Sardar Mohammad Reza Khan Purdili alone is the only influential land lord willing to lick a Russian boot. But even his own family are not solidly behind him and his brother Sardar All Khan Purdili, looks on at his actions with disapproval. The Ru sian Consular Agent snd the members of his staff visit Zahidan, Khwash, Mirjawa f&gt;nd Iranshahr occasionally and, in addition to the distribution of propaganda materialthey try to contact tribesmen and preach revolutionary ideas to them* Such ideas do not seam to appeal to the tribesmen of Tukran who ?&gt;re content with their lot and realise that Soviet propaganda which they consider is contrary to the tenants ^nd idetOs of Islam* cannot brin^ any good to them* Parties of Russian sponsored artists and acrobats from the north have also appeared in Mukran during the period under report. The local Persian authorities who were susoicious of their intentions, did not permit them to stay for more than a few days at any one place* The Russian anneal to migrate to the Soviet Union has fallen on deaf ears, the only intending immigrant being an Aimenian garage owner of doubtful habits and integrity* 7. ROAD SECURITY AND LAia SS]^ During the first three months of the period under report bands of Shahbakhsh outlaws from Mukran, who had taken up residence in Sholag in Afghanistan, made the area within a radices of 60 miles around Zahldan as the centi*e of their unlawful activities. Traffic by road, and within the countryside was partly paralysed. Ur able to obtain any redress at the hands of the local authorities, Sardar Mehrullah Khan Reki, some of whose tribesman were killed by the robbers, approached the Brigade Commander, £ahidan, and renuested nis permission to attack the strong hold of these outlaws in Afghanistan and inflict suitable punishment on them for their depredations in his tribal area. The Brigade Commander did not agr-e in view of the political complications involved, but shortly afterwards the outlaws were taken to task by the Afghan Governiflent for an Afghan ^orean. 4 mixed force of Afghan Gendarmerie and 0 armed tribesmen attacked the main body of the outlaws in Shelag and inflicted heavy casualties on them. The robbers fled with their families .and animals towards the Persian border and made for the ^smailzai territory. Before reaching their destination they were surrounded by the Persian Gendarmerie near Nasratabad and captured* Twenty three of them are in prison in £ahidan awaiting confirmation from Tehran of sentences passed against them. £s the robbers captured were mainly responsible for disturbing the peace in the Zahidan area, the situation has improved considerably since their capture and is likely to remain reasonably quiet for some time to come. 8. A&amp;1UL On the whole the morale and discipline of the Persian army is vary low. Officers continue to make money at the expense of the soldiery; medical arrangements are inadequate; and the toll taken by disease is heavy. Soldiers do not get their nay, rations or clothing either regularly or according to the sanctioned scale. 9. COMM UN ICATION S With the evacuation of the British Military forces from &amp;ast Persia in the second half of December 1945* the maintenance of the Zahidan-Mirjewa, Zahidan-Keman and Zahidan-Meshed roads has been transferred to the Persian Ministry of Roads. A3 though these roads are in good condition at present, their condition will gradually deteriorate as in the case of the Zahidan-Zabul road.6 . The Khwash-Chahbar road is motornble up to Iranshahr only and inspite of repeated re uests by the Military and Gendarmerie authorities in Mukran, nothing has so far been done to make it passable for wheeled traffic beyond Iranshahr. Government mails between 2*hidan and Khwesh are carried by lorry and between Khwash and Chahbar by camel* The sale in Persia to private owners of all the Lease * and Lend Trucks brought by the Americans for the transportatic of suoplies to Russia* has helped to ease the motor A transport situation in Persia and the rates of hire for the transportation of merchandise end passengers have decreased dur5.ng the period under report. The working of the Persian Posts and Telegraph Department does not appear to show any signs of improvement. Triegrams continued to be received during the period under report after long delays vrhich are always attributed either to interruptions on the line or because the lino has been taken over by the Russians. 10. vffiSTSRK IS TNG 111 FORMS continue to be popular with the official »nd wealtliier classes who can still afford the luxury of European dress. Owing to the high cost of living the poor classes find it difficult to meet the cost entailed in keeping up the standard of dress acquired during the last few years. 11. GENERA L The Democratic rising in northern Persia for which it is universally believed the Russians are responsible* has created much hatred for the Russians in the hearts of the Persians, who fear «s similar fate fill overtake the other northern provinces under Russian occupation. In their distress* Persians earnestly look towards Great Britain and the United States of America for help and hope that something may be done to save Persia from disintegration. Some have been heard to remark (incorrectly) that the British brought the Russians into Persia and they should therefore turn them out of Persia before they leave Persia themselves. Falling that they should stay if the Russians refuse to evacuate* In general there is an atmosphere of gloom in Mukran at the rapid course of events elsewhere which, it is felt, may ultimately result in the complete disintegration of Persia. There are no grounds for optimism an/ account it is known that Persia alone is incapable of resisting Russian demands and while there is very faint hope that Great Britain and the United States of America may stand by Persia it is more generally believed that the problem will resolve itself into one to be settled between Russia* and Persia alone from which Persia must inevitably emerge on the debit side.

The .iurisdiction of the Farmandar for Mukran remained unchanged during the period under report* MC.4L AD!.:XIUHTHATIQN $ On the whole there has been no change for the better in the general character of the administration# During the period under report, the Persian Government agreed to the formation of City Councils in all provinces in accordance with the law governing the formation of City and Provincial Councils passed in May 1907# The formation of the City Councils in Mukran and Seiatan has so far not been completed# In Mukran members to the City Council from Zahidan town only have so far been nominated but the question of nomination of members from the districts is still under consideration# Owing so the failure of Amir Assadullah Alarms party and the opposition party lead by Sardar Mohammad Reza Khan Purdiii to come to an understanding over the representation to be given to their respective parties on the Committee to be appointed for supervising the elections, the Central Goverhmont have ordered the postponement for an indefinite period of elections to the City Council at Zabul. It is hoped, however, that the formation of City Councils in Mukran and Seistan will give the general public a voice in the administration of their provinces and serve as a check on the anti-social activities of the official class who have hitherto shown very little regard for public opinion and welfare. (b) The elections for the nomination of Deputies to the 16th Majliss at Tehran will probably be held in August or September 1946 and in order to assure an impartial election, all Bakhshdars, Shahrdars and other officials capable of influencing the elections in any form who have been in their present posts for on® year or more are being transferred. Agha Murad Khan Reki and Agha Arbab Mehdi have both decided to contest the election in Mukran again# Issa Mubarki of Champ and Sardar Mohammad Amin Khan Narui of Qila Nau, Zabul, are new candidates for election. It is believed that Itfurad Khan and Issa Khan Mubarki have come to an understanding and that one of them will finally withdraw in favour of the other# It is also rumoured that Agha Amir Hussain Khan Khozeimah Alam, ex farmandar of Mukran has resigned his appointment in the Ministry of Agriculture at Tehran and will contest the election for either the ?!ukran or the Zabul constituency# ITS The general efficiency of Government Departments is steadily deteriorating and heads of departments still go much their ovm way. Officials are mostly corrupt and the spate of auditors and inspectors who with very few exceptions usually return to Tehran wit! * * “1 lined, / merely2 . ® fi) moroly encourag© the official classes to continue to harass the public. The settlement of the Azerbaijan question and the withdrarfal of Russian forces from northern Persia has strengthened the position of the Qawam Government. Educated Persians believe that Russian support of Qmmas Saltaneh will lead to a dictatorship, a form of Government which according to them suits the Persian tempararaent and character best* 4* HEMBBAL OHOT^RWISJBQETH E TRADERS.LiTO LQRM 4RD PE A S AJITS • The supply position from India has not on the whole shown an appreciable improvement and restrictions on the export of most commodities from India still remain in ^orce. Consequenrly prices of imported goods are still high and this position is aggravated by increased domand in the northern provinces of Persia which have only recently resumed normal trade relations \7ith the rest of the country* (b) The. wheat situation in Mulrran and Seistan has not been very satisfactory* The land lords in Seistan have been . hoarding wheat and the price rose to Rials 12 per Tabrezi Man. Through the generosity, however, of Amir Assadullah Alam who purchased wheat in the open market and sold it at a loss to bakers in Zabul to provide cheap bread, the poor of Seistan have been spared the ordeals of starvation until the collection of this yea^s harvest. The wheat and barley crop in Seistan this year is said to bo good and it is estimated that about 9000 tons of wheat and 3000 tons of barley are to be collected from Seistan this year on behalf of the Persian Government to feed the population of non-producing areas like Zahidan. the Pcrsian^nd the Gendarmerie in Mukran* Some Oarai officials from Tehran have begun the collection of wheat but owing to propaganda by the Hizb-i-Tudeh who are urging the peasants not to sell any wheat and barley to Government, progress has not been satisfactory* Consequently the Farmandar, Sabul, has rocorupended that K.S* Iffian B ashirullah should be appointed agent for the collection of wheat and barley for the Persian Government this year. The land lord class is on the whole prosperous as prices of cereals still remain at a high level, but the peasants are hard hit by the high cost of living and find it difficult to meet the requirements of a reasonably simple life* Locusts appeared In -hokran and Seistan during the period under report but did very little damage to the crops* As h result of various requests by local S ardars and notables of Mukran for financial aid to improve irrigation, the Central Government ordered the Agricultural Officer, Zahidan. to submit proposals for the improvement of agricultural land and the afforestation of certain suitable areas in Mukran. This officer has now submitted proposals recommending an expenditure of Tonnns 500,000 on these purposes over a period of five years* The Central Gove^faent’s approval of this scheme is still awaited. 5* SMUGGLING Large scale smuggling of goods from British Baluchistan to Persia has almost ceased but certain controlled articles which are scarce in Persia continue to find their way into Persia in small quantities. Since the imposition of a duty of Rupees 25 per tola on gold imported into India, gold sovereigns are now being smuggled back into India*3. 6. pftI TISH INTERE STS There Is strong rumour that the Railway from Ouetta to Zcihidan will be withdrawn behind the Zahidan frontier* The reasons given are that it is no longer required strategically, that it operates at a loss and that the local Persian officials obstruct its operation. No comments are offerred on the first point but on the second, it seems that an improvement in trade may soon be reasonably anticipated, in which case the opportunity to recoup previous losses should not be neglected. At the same time, the withdrawal of the railway would give a severe blow to Indian trading interests in Zahidan* As regards the third point, a close examination of the various complaints shows that far from being obstructive, the Persian officials have been very co-operative. But service on this line is unpopular and railway officials do their utmost to magnify their grievances in the hope of a mass transfer* It is understood that^eeeive no financial compensation for service in Persic and in view of local conditions and of the improvement in anti-smuggling measures on both sides of the border, the attitude of these minor officials is at least underston&amp;abl e • ?. mzm m x m iM Russian propagandists from northern Persia have been active and a branch of the Hiz.b-1-Tudeh was formally opened at Znbul on the 30th .Tune under the leadership of Agha Shah Quli Khan, the Soviet Agent. It has at present a following of about 300 people but the number is likely to increase, since existing social conditions afford ample scope for its success. The local Sardars, with the exception of Bfohamfflad Resa Purdili, have decided to boycott this movement. Tudah workers have recently Increased their activities in Zahidan but owing to strong opposition from some influential local traders and officials have so far failed to form a branch of the Hlxb-l-Tudeh in this town# They have, however, succeeded in creating a semblance of ui ity among the working classes and this was demonstrated in the form of x xkxt an organised riot which broke out at Zahidan on the 26th Ju^e, consequent on the murder of a Muslim boy by some members of the Bahai sect for using abusive language towards their community. It has been observed that well-to-do Persian traders and the majority of officials are not interested In the Hiab-i-Tudah but appear to be favourably inclined towards the Hizb Democrat which is sponsored by the Prim© ’inister and of which &amp; branch may shortly be established in Zahidan. During the period under report Mr. Alexandre Kiartser, fctecretary to the Russian Consular Agent at Zabul, visited Zahidan on the pretext of medical treatment and remained there for over one and a half months. During this period ho contacted many Persians and some British subjects and is said to have established a service for increasing Russian activities in India. As a result of enouiries made by Sarhang Aaizullah Azizi, G.O.C. Kerman, the Ministry of ^ar has informed the x Fnrmandar for Mukran that there is no truth in the allegatio that arms had been given by the Russians to Sardar Mohammad' Reza Khan Purdili. This has encouraged Sardar Mohammad Roza Purdili who has now refused to pay revenue tax and to sell wheat to Government. The activities of the Russian Consular Agent at Za r ul directed through Sardar Mohammad Baza Khan Purdili and Shah Quli Khan have dealt a serious blow to the power of the Alam family in Seistan and if the opposition continues to b€ /asas active as at presentj it is doubtfal ^ifwrther the Alem faraily will bo able to recover their position* s# HQ AD ssomm am Since the capture of 23 Ismailsai robbers* security situation in Mukran has improved considerably and with the exception of a minor incident on the 25th April in which a bund of armed robbers fired on some lorries and on being pursued by the Gerdarr'erie escaped into Afghanistan* no othor hold up of any significance took place in Mukran during the period under report* Mirza son of Shamsher* the ^small*si outlaw and leader of the gong of 23 captured by th^ Gendarmerie* is still at large and the Brigade Commander et Zahidan is trying to induce him to surrender to the military authorities on promise of an amnesty* Mir*a is said to have demanded the release of his 23 confederates before he will negotiate* A number of Ba3-uchis who had recently been transferred to Zabul fi*om the Turbat-i-Haidari area are being used by the local G a rdars and security situation in Seistan has deteriorated* T‘d counteract this arid the raids of Afghan robbers* the authorities have decided to increase the strength of the Gendarmerie in Seistan district to two Grohans. Quarrels ?ind feuds among the local tribal chiefs of Mukran continue and often result in armed conflicts* The local authorities concerned never take action in time and interfere only when the losing party approaches them for redress* This encourages the tribal chiefs to renew their old feuds and a sense of insecurity prevails in the tribal areas* 9# AIM The morale of the Persian army is low and the average Baluchi tribesman has very little respect as a fighter for the Persian soldiers stationed in Mukran who are drawn mainly from Seistart and Kerman* There appears some improvement in rations and clothing at Zahidan and Zabul but at Khwash conditions remain unsatisfactory* Medical arrangements are still Inadequate end far below the standards of modern^ armies. The Brigade Commanders at Zahidan and Khwash have been instructed by the G.O.C* Kerman to submit nroposals for the disarming of the tribesmen in Mukran and estimates of the expenditure involved* The ©Derations will be undertaken in the winter* 10* COiMMIOiTIMfi Since the evacuation of British troops from Fast Persia the condition of the roads in Mukran has steadily deteriorated and the Persian authorities are doing very little to keep them In good repair* Some temporary repairs to the Khwash-Ohahbar road have been effected recently and vehicles can now reach Chahbar from Khw&amp;sh* The Irantour Company which is already operating an air service in northern Persia extended its service to Zahidan via Meshed in June 1946* The working of the Persian Posts and Telegraphs seems to have improved and no Instance of delay in the delivery of telegrams was reported during the period under report*v 5 IX, m^S y .TW continue Although the wealthi©? classes ean rlross, officials and non officials of small moans cannot afford to do so* Among the tribesmen European dress has so far been adapted by Chiefs and notables only# Tha sottloment of the Azerbaijan quest.ion has strengthened the position of the Suv/am (Jovernment* Although the intelligentsia anong the Persians are thankful for the help given to Persia on the Security Council by Great Britain and America, Tudeh propaganda against the British is increasing. We are being accused of interference in the intorhal affairs of the country and attempting to maintain oufc stranglehold or* Persia by giving our support to r actionarios. Several articles have anpeared in the Tudeh prose attacking this Cons^fLate and one quo cation is that •’the British Consulate rules over Zahidan, that the power and influence exorcised by it is immense and that it can do and get anything done as it likes 11 . As regards the Hirfb Democrat, most IocjiI Persians believe that the Prime minister is aiming at dictatorship with the backing of the Russians. Ko J?.56-V/8^ Dated the POth July 1946.

Dated the 18th January 1947. 1. INTRODUCTION The jurisdiction of the Farmandar for Mukran remained unchanged during the period under report. 2. LOCAL VWiriRTRATIQN On the whole there has been no change in the general character of the administration. In accordance with orders from Tehran a City Council was formed at Zahidan for the purpose of supervising the elections. Great care was exercised by the local authorities to prevent the nomination of supporters of the Rizb Tudeh or of any other individuals likely to protest against the various unscrupulous activities of Government officials. Consequently with the exception of Agha Tawakul Kampuzia, a local lawyer and a son-in-law of Doctor n usaddiq. the leader of opposition in the last Fajliss. the members of the City Council are individuals of no consequence. Agha Kainpuzia has also recently been put in charge of the local branch of the Hizb Democrat and exploits his position to the full. (b) The holding of the elections has been delayed apparently to gain ^irae for the Hizb Democrat to establish itself firmly throughout Persia. Branches of the Hizb Democrat were opened at Khwash and Iranshahr and unsuccessful attempts are being made to pursuade Baluch tribesmen to interest themselves in its aims and ideals. Under instructions received from Tehran in order to ensure an Impartial election all Bakhshdars and Shahrdars in Thikran who had been In their posts for more than a year and could influence the elections in any way were transferred. In F'ukran at least this order has been Interpreted to mean the election of the Prime Minister 1 s nominee. At the instance of Agha Arbab Mehdi, who inspite of his great Influence at the centre and the expenditure of 250,000 Tomans, failed to get himself elected to the last Majliss, the Governor General for Kerman,.'hiring his recant visit to Khwash took the opportunity of pursuading the Baluchi chiefs and notables of Uukran to stand down In Arbab r &lt;r ehdi , s favour, one rival candidate, Agha Murad Khan Reki, being promised a Farmandari provided he did not contest the elections. 3. ?Jm mssx .°. f . thg prqswnt rogln. ana Its ropularlty or otherwise *dLth the local population. The news of the liberation of Azerbaijan has considerably increased the prestige of the Qawam Government and the influence of revolutionary elements like the Hizb Tudeh is fast vanishing. Although many Persians admit that this could not have been accomplished without the helo of the British and Americans, many insist dn acclaiming 7awam-us-Saltanah as the greatest statesmen of the day. Their enthusiasm for^ Prime Minister, however, does not in any way help to make the average Persian official any more honest or diligent in his dealings with the general public. He remains as corrupt /asJ 'W as «v«r and tha enhancamant of tha prastlgf^of Govarnraant has In fact mada it aasiar to axa^t i gratification. Central gal (b) Although tha civil administration officially functions throughout ^ukran, the southern and central parts of the provinca are in fact ruled by military and Gen'iarmeria officers who systematically exploit tha countryside for their o.vm profit. The Bakhshdars in that part of tha country wsild no authority whatever and remain in office only so long as they are willing to work according to the commands of the military and the Gendarmerie. Consequently tha Baluchi tribsemen who are looked do *n on by Persian officials as uncivilised are dissatisfied. Complaints made to higher officials are unheeded and result in a good deal of resentment end unrest. This was noticed by responsible Persian officials sometime back and instead of following a policy of appeasement they suggested the adoption of punitive measures to disarm th&lt;&gt; tribesmen. The military authorities agreed to these proposals and sanctioned an expenditure of Tomans 100 $ 00G for the purpose. The rising of the Qashqais in Fare, however, put an end to this nroposal as a greater part of the garrison in ?1 ukrsn was transferred to Fars to reinforce the garrisons there, nftth the troops in tfukran considerably reduced and the knowledge that some of the Baluchi chiefs were ready for a fight, the local authorities became' uneasy and were considerably relieved when H.E. Hesa Hikmat, Gstandar Kerman, accompanied by the G.O.C. Kerman division arrived at Zehldan by air on the 19th Koveiaber and flew to Khwash the following day. There at the wish of the Shah the Governor General Kerman announced the gT»ar«t of a general amnesty to all Baluchi tribesmen for their past misdeeds and the grant of 100,000 Tomans for agricultural development in Mukren. disarming of the tribesmen was postponed to a later date when it was honed it might be unnecessary. The Governor General also promised to ask the Shah for more money for agricultural development as he considered Tomans 100,000 insufficient. (c) The Persian authorities no doubt believe that these measures have pacified the Baluchis but the fact remains that although the occupation of Azerbaijan by Persian forces no doubt to some extent serves as a deterrent against any armed rising in Mukran, the real cause of the dissatisfaction has not been removed. The amnesty covers only a few individuals of little importance and it is unlikely that any major Portion of the grant of Tomans 100,000 will benefit those for whom it is intended. (d) Another major cause of dissatisfaction is the ^^rigged* 1 election of the wealthy Arbab Wehdi as Baputy for Mukran, iince most of the Baluchi Sardars and notables, whatever their differences, would have welcomed the election of a Baluchi to represent them in the fajllss. Sardar Tohamma* Amin IChan Narui of ICilla ftau, Selsten, who has a large following in Uukran, Murad Khan son of K.S. Idu Khan who is backed by the Reki tribe - the most powerful in Ihxkran- and Mir Abdi of Dashtiari have all been declared ineligible to contest the elections since, at the Instance of Agha Arbab Mehdl, Nalb Sarhang Issa Kariroi, lately Officer Commanding Gendarmerie in Mukran reported to Tehran (incorrectly) that they had been given arms by the British and ^ere planning an armed rising against the State. The average Baluchi trbesmen finds this practical interpretation of democrary contrary to the theories propounded by the lli?b n^mocrat and remains as suspiciousVof its intentions and ideals.4. qPMJ .J and peasants. |l^ ^v7 The supplies from India have not shown any appreciable improvement as export trade restrictions were only slightly relaxed. Prices of imported articles have fallen, however, and may go down further, as after the occupation of Verbal,1an by Persian Imperial troops the uncertainty with regard to the political situation in the north no longer exists and traders have been compelled to sell their hoarded stocks of imported articles. The trading community is on the whole prosperous though many of the traders have already suffer/ed heavy losses owing to the fall in prices of imported articles Some Indian and Persian traders are already busy •stablishing relations with firms in England, America and China. (b) 4s usual Mukran has been entirely denend^nt upon Seistan for wheat. The price of wheat went ku up to Rials 25 per Tabrezi Man against Rials 21 in Tune 1946. This is due to the hoarding of wheat by land lords who refuse to sell it in the open market* 4 further rise in the price of wheat is expected before the new crop is harvested. This indicates prosperity for the land owners and hardship for the peasant class, and the latter might therefore welcome a return of the Hizb Tudeh which appeared at least to champion their cause for better wages and working conditions. 5. SMUGGLING Tea, cloth, sugar, gur, old military clothing, medicines, shoes and toilet requisites continue to be smuggled In small quantities from British Baluchistan. 6. B IT I SI! INTERESTS The rumours about the withdrawal of the railway to Nok Kund: have fortunately Ao far proved entirely untrue and although it is operating at a loss, the fact remains that it serves as an important link between India and Iran, 'thatever the views of the Central Government at Tehran, local Persian officials at any rate hope that it will continue to onerate up to Zahidan. 7. RUSSIAN ACTIVITY The closing of the Russian Consulate at Zabul, the opening of the branches of the Hlzb democrat at Zahidan, Khwash and Iranshahr and finally the occupation of Azerbaijan by Persian Imperial troops have one after the other contributed to the total eclipse of Russian and Hizb Tudeh influence in Jmkran, where thanks to the efforts and prestige of some of the local officials and traders, it never succeeded in gaining a real foothold. Some of the official supporters of the Hizb Tudeh have been transferred and pressure has be*n successfully brought to bear against them to give up their pro Tudeh activities. Propaganda directed against the British in the Tudeh Press has also come to an end. 8. ROAD SECURITY A’D L4 T /LE3SNESS Quarrels and feuds among the local tribal chiefs continue and often lead to armed conflicts. A sense of insecurity prevails in the tribal areas and the local authorities constantly try to play off one chief against the other, leading to endless feuds. Even so road security in Mukran is improving and there have been no serious hold ups during the period under report.IS T* EXT secret » p. —'v «... w /l. in® /T** &amp;&gt;*&gt; ^ British Consulato, Z^hidan,/ (East Iran) The 26th July 1947. Appreciation of tho political situation in the province of Mukran for the half year endin* the 30th June 1947 !• LOCAL ADKIillGTRATION (a) . The .jurisdiction of the Farmandar for Jhikran remained unchanged during the period under report. On the whole there has been x bhange in the general character of the administration. Polling for the election of a Deputy to the 16th Majliss at Tehran was held throughout I'ukran in the 3rd week of January 1947. Very few voters recorded their votes personally and as previously arranged under or. ers of tho Prime Tiristerf Sijjlls of people residing in towns were collected by leading citizens and those of ;l le i.ul ibs ??? n ln . co ^tryside by their chiefs and broughl to t le polling stations to have their votes recorded in favour of Agha Arbab Mehdi. As a result Agha Arbab Mehdi who lives at Tehran and left Zahidan about 18 years ago was Uacted Deputy for Thikran by an overwhelming majority of votes. The result was not received favourably by certain sections local tribesmen but it was welcomed by the Iranian official class who hope to be able to use the Arbab s influence at the centre for the advancement of their own aims and objects. Since the departure of Agha Kadi some five months ago t.ie town administration has much deteriorated. There being no ^armandar it is impossible to get an official to commit himself to a decision and affairs will go on getting worse till a new Farmandar arrives. e s (b) As a result of the representations made in the matter ^ a JLH! hdi for l ^an, a proposal to the effect that ^fukran should be formed into a separate ustandari with headquarters at Zahidan and that the district of Seistan which hitherto formed part of the 9th Ustan should be included in it. The Central Government nave to the formation of Mukran into an independent «^ li ? 42 tra ^ 1 r 2 u ? lt under a s0ni or official to be called a Waali and the inclusion in it of the district of Seistan as Proposed. The arrival of the Waali is still awaited and in event of an honest and energetic official being appointed to the post, the conditions in ^ukran both poli leal and economic may take a turn for the better. If the new Waali” is Agha Amir fcssadullah Alan, as has-been stated many time, under such a man with a reputation for honesty and sympathy the future of Mukran Mu-iir *«3 m?T** C i? a ^ fether, tho late Shaukat-ul- ^? n 3 s Moulders. The Baluchi tribes ^ill be satistied with his appointment and the frontier from irjand to the South would be less restive. Under . another Governor General the future has possibilities of unrest among the £«&gt;nt;ier tribes, as these are I understand still uncertain afcd have no confidence yet in the future Indian administration of the frontier. 2 * IM,.p.bwo r Q f thq m or otherwise wit regim ,-md Its nomn nrj t.v the local population. Influence of the reactionary elements such as the I.izb Tudehjaas practically vanished but still there is lot oi aiscontinent among the working classes whose cause it cnampioned so ardently. The Persian Government recently made some haif hearted attempts to gain the confidence of the Baluchi tribesmen in Mukran by sanctioning monetary aid to deserving cases for improvement of their means ofi 2. irrigation. The grant has so far not been distributed but it is thought that only a small percentage of the amr-unt will be paid out to the tribesmen and the remaining will be pocketed by the officials to whom the task of distribution has been entrusted. Whatever measures the central Government may devise for the welfare of the ryots in the out of the way provinces, their success depends a good deal on the local officials concerned who invariably place their personal interests before those of the ryots. (b) In Central and Southern Mukran the civil administratioi functions in name only. The country is virtually ruled over by the military and gendarmerie officers who exploit their position to the full. In certain areas, however, the tribal chiefs who are strong enough to defy the local authorities do not tolerate any interference lay the military and gendarmerie. All Naqdi of Bent who is reported to have an armed lollo ping of about lf?00 strong being a notable example. In other cases the local officials encourage tribal chiefs to harness the tribesmen and exact unauthorised taxes such as 'Dah Yak' (one tenth of the produce) and share the proceeds. Thus Instead of promoting peace and prosperity, Government officials actually sow the seeds of dissention and discontent* (c) Inspite of repeated notifications issued by the Military authorities calling upon all tribal chiefs and notables in Mukran to surrender the unauthorised arms in their possession, only a few obsolete weapons have so far been su rendered by the tribesmen. Some of the chiefs have in act told the Government officials plainly that they required the arms for their protection and were not prepared to surrender them unless and until their enemies had been disarnod. This indicates that the average tribesman riiatever his shortcomings has very little respect for the present regine. It has been announced recently that the Government proposed opening more schools in Mukran and two hospital*at Sarawan and Iranshahr, but both the proposals are in the preliminary stage at present and should take time to materialise. (d) The average Persian official remains as copyupt as ^ i s Poetically impossible for a member of the public to get anything done without payment of an illegal nra irication in 'one form. Auditors and inspectors sent from Tehran visit the province occasionally not to help towards the smooth and efficient working of the departments concerned but to receive their share of the illegal wealth amassed by the heads of departments concerned. 3. SSUMMt Pif SPKRm OF! OTHOTTISE 0? TTHo TIUDEHS. T.AMD LORDS WD pfiSAKTS (a) flukran obtains a good many of her requirements in the form or cloth, gunnies and tea, tyres, spices end sugar, gur, leather and cement, glassware, sport goods and hardware from India while a major portion or her exports via the Zahidan land route are consumed in India. The supnlv position in India therefore remains an Important factor in determining the volume of the import and export trade between Persia and India. Many of the important commodities required by Persia are still controlled in India. As long as the supply position there warrants the retention of the itarii various controls in force at present, the imports from India to Persia 'rill remain restricted. Insplte of the diffieultie and the restrictions involved, the trading class is onThe whole prosperous, but anxiously awaits the day when with ‘. it i mprovement of the supply situation throughout the worldand the availability of more shipping space, trade will resume its normal flow free of all present day restrictions. (b| Mukran is not self sufficient in the matter of food. The deficit areas obtain their requirements from Selstan which forms part of the 9th Ustan. As there is an acute shortage of wheat and barley this year in Selstan* purchasers from Mukran have been experiencing difficulty in procuring their requirements. Actually this shortage is due to the hoarding of grain by the land lords with the intention of forcing up prices. The land lord class is prosperous but the condition of the peasant class is deplorable. They are at the mercy of both the officiils and the land lords and neither of them seems prepared to entertain the Idea of any Increase in their wages or improvement of the conditions under which they work. It is high time that the Persian Government did something to improve the lot of these wretches whose discontentment may prove a source of danger on coming into contact with reactionary elements. 4 . m mm Tea* cloth and sugar* gur, old military clothing and medicines, canvas and leather shoes and copper utensils continue zo be smuggled in small quantities from British Baluchistan to Persia while gold is being smuggled to India from Persia. 5. MgJM immw? The North Western Bailway continues to operate up to Zahldan. It appears that the Iranian Government does not favour its withdrawal beyond the Persian border, but the local Persian officials do not appear to share the same views and instead of co-operating with the Railway officials to ensure its smooth working* try to prove as obstructive as possible. The stage of perpetual stupid bickering between Railway and Persian officials has now developed into one when violence on Railway officials, if not condoned, is at least prosecuted with the minimum of energy. Until some active steps are taken by an energetic Governor (not an Head Clerk acting as such) to secure co-operation by the Persian officials concerned the next stage may well develop into open and violent friction. e. wmim jumam The activities of the Russian sponsored Hizb Tudeh and witi it the Russian influence in Mukran has practically come to an end. A few Armenians who were said to be In touch with the Russian Consulate as Zabul, are still residing in Zahldan but do not appear to be active in fostering Russian propaganda. 7. RQlfi. SECURITY; AND LAIVLESSNHSS ' There has been no hold up on any of the important roads in Mukran during the period tinder report and road security appears to have improved. This is supposed to be largely due to the energy of the local cammmdsx Army Commander S&amp;rhang Muizsi. At least two of the outlaws who had been disturbing the peace of the estem and north western Mukran for sometime were rounded up and paid the supreme penalty for the armed robberies and murders committed by them over a period of several years. Mirza son of Shamsher the Israailzai outlaw, however, is still at large and efforts of the local authfc'iti -es to capture him have failed. It has recently transpirer’ that the Ismallzai chief keeps Mirza informed of the intentions of the localauthorities and re?»ularly ?3upplies x v/ith arras, men and food. No doubt Mftrsa shares his booty &gt;dth the Israailzai chief. The condition of then troops stationed at Sahidan is staid to be slightly matter than those stationed at the out of the vray places lUte 2abul, Khwash aytd Iranshahr. The clothing and rations issued to men and animals are not according to the scale sanctioned by the Government and the saving effected goes to .well the pockets of the an&gt;iy commanders and the Inspectors and auditors from Tehran. Most of the conscripts do no. receive the small pay allowed them for the term of thoir Military training. Consequently the morale of the Persian soldiers both regular and conscript is low. Medical err an ■thm^nta are inadequate and military personnel in need of a major operation has got to be sent to*Kerman. 9. CQ^T TJNIC ATXONa The condition of the roads in t'ukran is going from bad to worse. Repairs of a temporary nature have recently been carried out to the Khwash-Chahbar road beyond Nekshahr and it is now said to be passable by wheeled kraeffim transport. Ihe Central Crovernment is said to be seriously considering t;tc possibility of abandoning the firaoont section of the roao ^here it rims through a river bad in Tangi Sahreh and is wMied away by floods every year.
