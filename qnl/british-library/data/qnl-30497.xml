As a road report was asked for, and as the political pack of the interior tribes is constantly being shuffled and re-dealt, I have not dwelt on the intar-tribal relations. The following note as regards ■''ahabi encroachment however ray be of use. Whilst at Mahadhah Shaikh Salir bin Diyan informed re that sore few days before our arrival the Bani Na'im had sent a messenger to Ibn Uiluhi, Ibn r Saud’s lieutenant in Hasa, asking for help in arms and men against Shai kh r Isa bin Saleh who was then advancing towards Birairri^ and had taken r Ibri. The Bani Na'im had written to SHaikh Salim apprising him of this and asking for his help. Salim expressed anger at this action being taken by the Bani Na'im before they had consulted him. He appeared to have a great hatred of the Wahabis, party owing to his grandfather having been kept a prisoner by them in Nejd for 7 years. When we left he had not made up his mind as to what line he should take, but I gathered that he proposed to consult the Bani Citab with whom, he was $ friendly terms.

Lees and K.W* Gray.SITUATION AND PRELIMINARY ARKAHGi^MTS This narrative is a brief description of a journey taken in the interior of Oman by a Geological Surveying Party of the D’Aroy Exploration Coy* I, as a Muscat State Official, was asked to accompany the party in a general advisory capacity. The members of the expedition were:- Mr* G.M. Lees.) ) Geologists* ' K.W. Gray*) M Joseph Fernandez who was deputed by the Bombay Natural History Seciety through the kindness of the Company* H A.F. Williamson (el-§ag‘Abdullah) in charge of general camp arrangements, and transport. Messrs. Lees and Gray together carried out a geological and topo graphical survey* Mr* Fernandez confined himself to the Flora &amp; Fauna; whilst Mr. Williamson and I maintained social relations with the Shaikhs and people of the tribes through whose districts we passed. At the request of The Hon* The Political Hesident Bushire I have undertaken the writing of this report, which is chiefly concerned with the human side of our journeying; but I have to thank all the members of the party for suggestions and notes on various points. As Oman Proper does not acknowledge the Muscat Government negotiations were opened with Shaildi ’Isa bin Salih, the paramount chief of the Hinawi faction which controls that district* At the same time the Council of Ministers wrote letters to all tribes friendly to them, Messrs. Lees, Gray and Williamson arrived at Muscat from Muhammarah in the middle of October, During their journey they had managed to survey the tract known as Ruus al-Jibal, and Malcolm and Elphinstone Inlets* This was most fortunate as it linked up with the surveys made on the journey under report and thus completed the survey of Oman North of the Wadi Hawasinah to the Trucial Coast. The Political Agent, Lt,-Colonel C.G.Crosth- waite, C.B.E., who had played a large part in the negotiationsbetween the Company and Hie Highness the bultan and had been unstinting in hie help, was unavoidably absent on their arrival, but he had given full instructions to Mr, B.S. Thomas, O.B.S,, the financial Adviser, to whom also the party was greatly indebted for his trouble and aid in making all preliminary arrangements 0 As a result of discussions held with him and the Council of Ministers, it was considered inadvisable to attempt any penetra tion of the lands 6, and S*iS. of the Wadi Hawasinah as Shaikh 'Isa who controlled all the country in that direction had written politely regretting his inability to control his tribesmen should the party enter his territories. It was therefore decided to proceed by the coastal route to Khaburah and up the Wadi Hawasinah to the hills; thence to travel along under the hills as near the watershed as possible - penetrating wherever the tribes appeared to be friendly disposed, - as far as Murair, which place marks the northern boundary of the Batinah &amp; the limit of Muscat’s l authority, Shaikh ’Isa bin Salih had at this time decided to make an advance in company with the Imam from Oman proper to the N,W, with the object of bringing the tribes of the Bhahirah under his authority up to and including the Biraimi Oasis. This was un doubtedly of help to the party, as many Shaikhs who might otherwise have proved refractory, received the party with open arms hoping that exaggerated reports would reach Shaikh ’Isa of the presence of Muscat Officials in their territories, and perhaps also seeing a vague chance of getting some help from the Muscat Government* The financial Adviser arranged for the transport, which was drawn at first from the tribes round Barkah and arrived with a promptitude incredible to those who have had to deal with Arabs in such matters. The oamelmen however were skilled exponents of the art of a ca^canny, and as soon as possible after leaving the coast hill- camels and camelmen were substituted* These men proved themselves far more straight forward and willing, whilst the camels, hardy and bred in the rough Wadis, negotiated places impassable by the soft camels of the Batinah, used only to flat3. sandy plain. , , , Whilst these preparations were being made Fernandez joined from Bombay and the whole party, followers, transport arc ^ores were finally collected ready to move at Bait al-tfalaj on the 3rd November 1925* 1st Stage- Bait al-ffalaj to Khaburah^ (Itinerary. Boshar - Sib - Barkah - Musanna - Suwaiq - Khaburah) 4th Nevr. 5th Novr. 6th Novr. i-flS On the following morning, after the confusion and arguments in loading up inevitable on the first day of such a journey, a start was made. The dignity of the departure was somewhat marred by the freshness of the camels several of which were bucking and bouncing around strewing their riders over the plain. But no serious damage was done and we arrived that evening at Boshar where we were hospitably received and entertained by Shaikh ! Aii bin Abdullah al-Khalili, brother of the Imam. As soon as the tentf were pitched I entered mine, changed into Arab dress and returned to Shaikh 'Ali. Lees and Gray arrived later and after shaking hands with the Shaikh turned and greeted me* I shook hands with Lees, but refused to do so with Gray who until he recogniaed me cudgelled his brains as to what he had done to offend this ill- mannered Arab. We were more fortunate than Sir Percy Cox in that we were using the Indian (Bikanir) Camel Saddle. Our following however were riding in the fas ion described by him^that is-behind the hump. Weiisted is inaccurate when he describes X his Arabs of Oman as sitting 'cross-legged on their war-camels'. They either sit with their legs hanging, or kneel back on their heels with their feet pointing inward and acting as a further cushion. Leaving Boshar on the next morning we spent the night at Sib, and thence proceeded to Barkah where we picked up Abdullah bin Humaid, clerk to the Wali of Barkah, who had been deputed to accompany us as representative of the Muscat Government. A portly man of over 50 he hated travelling and proved himself nothing x Chapter 3.but a costly incubus, 7th &amp; 8th Leaving Barkah we passed through Muwanna* to ttuwaiq where we were Novr» regaled with a meal of chicken pillau, the yellow legs of the chickens protruding importantly from an enamel utensil usually 10th Novr. found in closets. The following night we camped outside Khaburah and entered the village on the morning of the 10th. Wali iiudhaffar bin Sulaiyim, Wali of Khaburah, will play a large part in this narrative, and deserves a short description. 4 His father ^ulaiyim, son of an African Slave, was a noted warrior who by his own ability and character had risen to a position of great importance becoming Wali of Sahar, which place at that time included in its Wilayat many more tribes and villages than is the case now, Mudhaffar on the death of his elder brother Salim became Wali and held the position when Saiyid faimur succeeded as Sultan of Muscat* A quarrel ensued and the family migrated to Dubai* The Sultan made many efforts to bring him back but was unsuccessful for 3 years. Finally liudhaffar returned and was made Wali of Khaburah, He inherits much of the character of his father, is forceful, active and much liked by the badu in the handling of idiom he i s expert. He is however subject to moods and has the violent, unreasoning temper of the African, At such times he completely loses control of himself, though when left alone for some hours he calms down, and is soon heartily ashamed and more than willing to show his repentance by some especially hard work. He i s moreover full of fun and heartily appreciates a joke even when against himself. Although only supposed to come as far as Sahar he accompanied us throughout the whole journey and was general manager of the transport, stage manager of all durbars and feasts, and our con stant and trusted adviser, much to the relief tinged with jealousy of Abdullah bin Humaid, whose work this should have 0 been, Mudhaffar handed his whole house over to us, and the rest of the day was spent in discussion with the various Shaikhs about routes, and haggling over their pay and the number offollowers to be allowed them, whilst Lees and Gray measured a base for the plane-table traverse which they proposed to carry on from here. Of the three Shaikhs who were to have met us { only two had arrived, Saif bin J-iuhammad of the Kawasinah &amp; Ghussun bin ^alim of the Bani ‘Umr, but as our way lay first through their country the absence of the Bani *Ali Shaikh caused us no inconvenience. By the evening everything was ready for the morrow which was to see the beginning of the really useful and interesting part of the journey. 2nd Stage. The country of the tribes of Kawasinah &amp; Bani r Umr, / / (Itinerary, Khaburah - Ohaidhain - IPalaj al-Hadith - Naj d al-iQiabbain - Hail Islat (or Li slat) i*urfar - Lihban - Palaj al-Hirth (near Saham), Our new arbiter rerum Shaikh Saif bin Muhammad of the Eawasinah did not impress us favourably at our first meeting, and this unfavourable impression was fully confirmed later, A man of about f&gt;0, blear-eyed and foxyfaced, his miserly and greedy nature had estranged many of his own villages and tribesmen, who openly expressed their shame at a Shaikh who rode such a broken down and ancient camel that he could not keep up with the party. His one object was to prevent any of the expected flow of infidel dollars from being diverted into other pockets than his own and to accomplish this he resorted to all sorts of shifts as will be seen. After some delay due to the absence of Bhaikh Saif we left iOiaburah and V/illiamson and I puaned forward whilst Lees and Gray turned aside to visit the deserted village of Qasaf. The bare stumps of date palms bore mute testimony to the repeated failure of the rains during the past ten years. We arrived at Ghaidhain at • about noon and selected a very good capixig-ground on the near side of the village. This did not fit in with Saif* &amp; ideas and unaer protect of showing us a far better place a little further on he led us some 2 miles up the Wadi past the village and showed us a place strewn withboulderB and with no water close by. As this wee our irst day in the Kaw&amp;sin&amp;h country I dared not express xay ieelmg^ — simply walked back to my original choice and ordered our men to unsaddle and, as the caravan had meanwhile arrived, ,to pitch the tents, iiaif’e idea in leading us on in that way was twofold - to avoid having to offer the hospitality of his village, and to prevent us from buying anything except through himself or his personal followers. ffliaidhain (bbb ft) wrongly placed in hunter’s Map of 1908, is built on a 25 feet river terrace on the left Bank of the &amp;adi Hawasinah about half a mile before the V^adi emerges from the foot-hills into the open plain. An older river terrace 95 feet above the present level of the river forms a steep cliff opposite the village. This and other villages of the Kawasinah are well and strongly built, in sharp contrast to those of other tribes which we visited, strangely enough well-built fortified villages are a source of weakness rather than strength to the tribe, as each petty vjllage bhaikh comes to rely more on his fortifications than on the unity of the tribe. This was most noticeable among the Villages of the 1 awasinah where one was on unfriendly terms with the other and the tribal Shaikhs had very little authority; whereas on my expressing surprise at the wretched condition of the Ban! ’Umr forts ana villages at a later date, their bhaikh said that this had been the deliberate policy of his father and himself; a policy whose success was evident from the discipline and obedience of his tribesmen. The Wadi Hawasinah at Ghaidhain is dry except in time of flood but the ^alaj or water channel of the village obtains its supply from underneath the surface shingle about a mile above the village and continues underground for some distance. The construction of the underground channel is exactly similar to that of the Persian “Qanat* or M Kariz'. The head of the falaj is protected by a well built fort. The channel later divides into two , each stream watering a half of the village gardens. Hence the derivation of the name GMi dhain 'The Two Groves* 1 .7. 12fch Noyr, Xitet and &lt;&gt;ray decided to spend the next day climbing the hills, so Williamson and I held a aurbar of the local ohaikr and Villagers. Saif turned up and started a long tale about the dangers of the road and the necessity for keeping strictly to the track. I replied with a few straight words, telling him that I held him responsible for the safety of the party whilst in his district. Ke then said that the next 3 villages were on bad terms with him and he was frightened that they would do something against us in order to dishonour him. I replied that in that case he must produce representatives from each of the 3 villages to guarantee our safe passage. 13th tfevr. ^he next morning he again - in my opinion deliberately - delayed us for one hour before appearing from the village. We nassed by one village, duddan, and reached a second Bida’ah. * spot This looked a very inviting/and as Lees did not wish to go very far I proposed to camp here, ^'he ^haikh however protested so strongly that no fodder etc., could be obtained that I consented to go on to the next. Here he started the same arguments but I refused to go further. Ian demon! um reigned. All his followers shouted their loudest. I sat down, told the Askaris to unsaddle and began to eat my lunch. As soon as they saw I was determined they became quite happy and started making preparations for the night. The village ^haikh came to visit f and proved no at friendly. It appeared that S&amp;it had had a quarrel with them and was determined out of spite that they should not benefit by our passage up the vvadi. As Lees decided to spend the next day here Williamson and I were able to inspect the place at leisure, ^alaj al-Hadith, as it is named, is perched high up above the Wadi with its gardens on a shelf below it. ^he Wadi had running water and was sprinkled with oleander and Ziziphus shrubs up to 10 feet high. The village holds about 30 families, is well built and clusters round a strong two-storied fort. We sat in the hajlis for over an hour eating dates and honeycakes and drinking coffee and sweet ginger. On our return to camp we found that ^aikh8 Shaikh Muhammad Mn Hilal of the Ban! ‘All had arrived; so I donned toy bioht and went with Williamson to receive him in Wall Mudhaffar ! B tent, where all durbars, official and un-official, were held* He seemed a very pleasant man, quiet and unassuming, with an natural air of good - breeding - in every way Saif’s opposite* x We were now on w^ngted’s route « He entered the Wadi Hawasinah (which he calls Wadi Hussuf-el-Kuroos) from the last above Ghaidhain and spent a night at Suddan which he describes fully* Our routes coincided till beyond Najd el-Khabbain, where he turned slightly left to Mi skin, whilst we, as will be seen turned to the right under the hills, to re-enter them through the Wadi Bani ’Umr* There must have been a considerable rainfall * before Wellsted^ passage up the Wadi Hawasinah, The stream was indeed Iks flowing when we were there but except for some isolated pools off the track there was nothing 'so deep and rapid that it nearly swept my horse from its legs' 15th Novr* As I had been having attacks of malarial fever for the past few days Williamson and I decided to go on a head of the caravan. The way led up the Wadi bed through the thick oleander trees* The Indian camel saddle, raises the rider much higher than does the Arab, and we were many times in danger of suffering to* Absalom’s fate; but further on the Valley opened out* After going some two miles we passed a large tower on the right bank. It appeared that the Sultan though he exercises no authority in these parts pays the ^aikh of the Hawasinah ten dollars a month to keep some men in the fort for the protection of the caravan route from robbers. There were 3 mein in it, as we approached, two of whom came down to meet us. Williamson and I were a little behind, and when we arrived a heated argument was taking place* The guards were demanding the douceur which they were accustomed to take from all travellers* We gave them 3 dollars and passed on* But the man left in the fort, either not realizing that we had paid the w oustom H or thinking it not enough, ran to a point directly over-looking the Wadi # pointed his rifle at us, then x Chapter 12.9 . fired over our heads, and started screaming in the sharp high- pitched feminine tone used by men in this country to warn their villages and friends of the approach of hostile or strange parties. His own companions ran to him from the fort, and our following all started loud explanations from below, whilst Williamson and I went steadily forward and left them to settle it* One half-hour’s riding from the tower brought us to the Wadi Jhillah which enters the Wadi Hawasinah from the West, The confluence of the Wadis marks the boundary between the Hawasinah and the Bani ^mr, so that we now eatf;e under the protection of ^haikh Ghussun bin Salim. He i s a short squat man, his head sunk deeply between a pair of broad and powerful shoulders* A large, curved, and fleshy nose gives him a Jewish appearance of the type popularised by cartoonists. He i s a splendid camel rider, and contrary to the usual custom of the country was riding a powerful ba’ir or male camel* It was a relief to deal with him after the mean and greedy Saif. His discipline is firm and tactful, and he has a strong hold on his tribesmen* ffrom a high hill top near Palaj al-ffadith, Lees had a good view of the upper part of the Wadi Hawasinah, Below Falaj al-Hadith the wadi is flanked by steep black serpentine hills 2000 to 3000 feet in height. Above this point, however, the hills recede further from the Wadi, which allows small plots of cultivation on the river terraces. The following villages were seen in the Wadi Hawasinah above its junction with Wadi Dhillah- Hajajah, ’Abaila, Hajah, Tdwi, Suwairiq, Washah and Harm ’Ali, The Wadi -Ghillahjby contrast, is much narrower, vertical cliffs rising sheer from the shingle bed of the Wadi, Jabal Mindim 2 miles to the South is 4800 feet above bea level or 3000 feet above the Wadi* This Wadi is uninhabited except for some bedouin squatters who live in oaves or under trees and who obtain water by digging pits in the shingle river bed. We marched steadily up, spending one night in the Wadi Bed. As weIS), approached the head, the Wadi became narrower and steeper and the going became very bad, till finally we reached a zig-zag pass 18th ^ known as Naj d al-iQiabbain (2970). Here we were forced to dismount and lead our camels to the top. We had now reached the watershed ■j dividing the Batinah and the Bhahirah. Immediately below were 2 small date plantations and some forsaken terraces which formed a splendid natural camping ground. The continuous ascent had told on our camels and I had been sick for some days. It was therefore decided to spend three days here during which Lees and Gray could work on the hills &amp; bring the plane- table traverse up to date,whilst Williamson could reorganize the 17th Nsvr.transport. We had already changed some half of the Batinah camels # for those of the Bani *Umr and here Williamson changed the remainder, so that for the first time the Caravan was composed of one tribe and the §haikh oould be held responsible. This simplified matters greatly, and these camels remained with us till we reached S&amp;har. Ghussun had been telling us tales of a chain embedded in the rock, and as Lees and Gray were as usual bent on climbing the most precipitous and inaccessible mountain they could find Williamson and I determined to investigate. The way led across the outlying spurs of the main ridge, which falls in far gentler slopes on this side. The country was well wooded with Si dr trees and oleander. The village of Raht is situated at the point where the Wadi al-Ghor leaves the more open plain of Hayyal and enters a narrow defile. Half a mile further on we passed the small village of Hail Nakhl with picturesque terraced gardens.. We now appeared to be making straight for the mountain till we realized that we were close to the wonderful Naqs gorge 10 to 20 ft. broad with perpendicular walls rising to a height of 400 ft. From half a mile away it was quite invisible. With some difficulty we made our way along till we came to a drop of 16 ft* There were 2 possible ways. On the left the stream had worn a deep channel in the rock and a boulder had iallen blocking the outer edge of the groove and leaving a man-hole with a pool 4 ft. deep immediately below. On the right in the smooth face of the rock were cut some niches sufficient to hold the toes, but the edges of which had been bevelled by time. There *11 was nothing to grip and one could only spread-eagle on the rock. Wall Mudhaffar without any hesitation made for the niches. William and I after watching him decided on the pool. He stripped and went first taking a good plunge in the icy water. I sent 3 men down before me, lowered myself on to their shoulders, and came out scarcely touched* A short distance further on we came to the chain. Well-forged with long narrow links it was firmly secured between 2 rocks and hung over a 40 ft, drop, but a rope was attached to the further end as it was not long enough to reach the bottom. The face of the cliff was concave so that no foot hold was obtainable. The tribesmen with us said that up to 20 years ago there had been only a rope and many had lost their lives by its breaking as they descended in the light hearted careless bedouin manner. They coula not give the name of the broad-minded and public-spirited Shaikh who 'mm substituted the chain. The gorge breaks through the Knife-edge ridge of Jabal Rais and later joins the Wadi hbillah. By using this track the natives avoid the much longer route over Naj d al-Khabbain by which we came. On our way back I managed the climb by the niches and was very glad to reach the top, Williamson preferred the pool, but found it easier to drop in than to climb out. Three times he scrambled up till his head was through the man-hole then slipped and fell with a loud splash. The tribesmen shrieked with merriment. It was a joke they would recount for the rest of their lives, *Vhen we finally reached the top they gave a loud ’’Allahu Akbar M whioh echoed and re-echoed up and down the gorge*, Some way back we found Fernandez who had had a fall and jarred his spina, Gray also came back to camp with fever, Lees told us of his bedouin, guide who smoked tobacco in an empty cartridge- case with a hole punched through the cap, 19th Nov. As Gray and I were still weak we spent the following day quietly in camp. The ^haikhs of Hayyal and Qanat came to visit and ’’coffeed 1 * in /Wali Mudhaffar's tent. Lees and Williamson climbed Jabal el Oala f ah (4900 ft.) whence a magnificent view of the Lhahirah was obtained and even the edge of the great sand desert, the Ruba* el Khali, could be ,een in the distance. To the South East the great12* ar sc^pp of Jabal Akhdh&amp;r plainly risible. The tfadie draining West and Bouth West open out into extensive plains broken here and there by groups of small hills. The villages of Mix Qanat, Dariz and ^bri were pointed out by the guides but Mi skin was hidden by a range of low hills. 20th Kovjp* We were reluctant to leave this pleasant ccmp, but time pressed, so we set out for the Wadi Bani ’Umr through which we intended returning to the Bat in ah. As we were loading up Williamson tried to make a camelman place^ on his camel some hens which had been bought ^ for the Mess* The Arab prejudice however against the carrying of any kind of a fowl or chicken by a man proved so strorg hare that insistence would undoubtedl^resulted in e mutiny. In the same way we could only obtain eggs if we sent one of our own servants to fetch them from the village or camp. Our route lay along a wide valley dominated by a strong but dilapidated tower standing on a small hill in the middle, then over the watershed by a short but difficult pass into the Wadi, which we followed past the village of Suw idah to Li slat (2300 ft.) This place had formerly belonged to the Hawasinah and much * resembled Ohaidhain in its building. The spot marks the con fluence of 3 Wadis one of which, some 100 yards from where it debouches, is split by a solitary abrupt hill perpendicular on three sides. On the summit is a strong fort which they told me was built by the Bani Bhimas, of Qahtani origin and ancestors of the Bani Buwaisah from whom the Hawasinah claim descent* I have been unable to trace these tribes but perhaps the ruins of Ruwai sah described by Mr. Philby may mark a settlement of the tribe before they were driven out by the present inhabitants of the Wadi Dawasir, and migrated to Oman, A feature of the fort was the well. This had been dug in the Wadi bed against the side of the hill and enclosed by a wall built in the shape of a semi-circle against the cliff right up to the fort 100 ft* above. The village was captured by the Bani *t3iar 40 years before and has been held by them since. They have abandoned the old village, which ie in ruins, and built a new andmiserable one of palmbranches on the further bank, afoen I asked Ghussun the reason he said, as I have mentioned above, that his and his father’s policy had been to discourage the use or building of forts and strong villages and to rely rather on the unity of the tribe* 21st Norr* Lees and Gray spent a day here pocketing and ticketing the hills so I decided to write letters, When pitching tents I always tried to place Wali Mudhaffar’s tent between me and the village so that he could divert all sight seers to himself. But on this day I was taken unawares by the village head-man who sat himself down in the door obviously intending to have a long chat. He asked me if we had found any gold and was disappointed when I said we were searching for knowledge not for gold* However he rallied and asked me if I read the fyiran* On my replying that I had read it he said 'Allah Yubaiyidh Wajhak” • ”God whiten your face' «* which I should have taken as a reflection on my truthfulness had not lir* Philby stated that it i s a high compliment. Williamson was told that he was certainly making dollars out of the stones brought in by Lees and Gray. Otherwise how could he go on paying out to the Shaikhs and camel men? A 2k.-id Novr, Soon after leaving Li slat the road left the Wadi and passing the small village of Qlsah on the right climbed over the northern shoulder of Jebel Ra’is, by a pass called Naj d Bani’UAr or Naj d al-Q,afs t the 'Pass of the cage'* (3110 ft.). This was the roughest stretch we experienced throughout the journey. But the sturdy hill-camels made light of it and by the evening we were encamped at Purfar where we re-entered the Wadi Bani ’Umr. The village was situated at the junction of 2 Wadis from one of which flowed a hot and bitter stream, and from the other cool and sweet water. Wherever we came across hot springs (and there are many) the people were most anxious that Lees and Gray should examine them. I think they had some misty alchemist ic notions of discovering stones transmuted into gold by the hidden fires, if only we would show them where to search.23rd Novr* During the night I heard much shouting and arguing in Shaikh Ghuesun’e tent. On the following morning Wali Mudhaffar came and told me that Nasir bin Salim Ghussun^ half-brother, had arrived the preceding evening from barkah and had spent the night upbraiding his brother for taking us through his country. He asserted, on whose authority I cannot say, that we had no permission from the Muscat Government to enter the hills. Actually he was extremely jealous of the money jgiussun was making by accompanying us and supplying transport. When he came to call on me I asked him to honour us with his company for a day or two, which pleased him and kept him under observa tion, On the same day all our glasses were smashed, a tragedy which we agreed later was the cause of the troubles which over took us in the next few days, 24th Hovr, We were now coming into the low foot-hills and the Wadi beds were broadening. Passing through Purfar we reached Lihban &amp; and wellbuilt village with extensive date planta tions on both sides of the Wadi, ^his was Hasir** headquarters and he pressed me h^ard to stay and drink ooffee* I refused politely and we pushed forward turning to the N.W, Parallel with the hills, and leaving the village of Dukh&amp;l on our gight. We had arranged to ©amp at a small well in a valley only occasionally traversed by shepherds. Gray and I arrived first. He set up his plane-table and covering it with a sheet of brown paper placed the Indian-ink open on top. As he stooped down to take something the breeze whisked away the brown paper and upset the ink right over the middle of the survey. It seemed at first as though the irreplaceable results of a fortnight’s hard work were to be entirely destroyed, but fortunately it was found that by careful scraping after the ink had dried sufficient could be deciphered for a tracing to be taken though at a cost of much extra labour. This was our first misfortune and was quickly followed by a second, Lees turned up in the evening. He had spent the whole day with Pernandez who had been very ill with a sharp go of fever accompanied by very severe vomiting and collapse. Meanwhile Williamson had not arrived with his15* V) following which included the camp cook* As it grew dusk search parties were sent out, a lamp was placed on the highest hill nearby, and Wali Mudhaffar always ready for emergencies, prepared the Arab 'Kabuli' or mutton pillau* We were not very anxious as there were settlements near and Williamson had spent years amongst the Arabs* At about eight o’clock loud shouts of 'Allahu Akbar' heralded his arrival. As soon as he realised that he had lost the way, he had gone forward to a village some eight miles further on and hired an old man to guide him to the well. He was however very pleased to see the beacon, as the old man seemed somewhat vague as to its locality, 25th Novr, Strangely enough on the following day Lees was overtaken by an attack very similar to that from which Pernandez had suffered. He had left his camel man on the road and gone a short distance out of sight when he was taken ill. He lay down for some hours to recover. In the meantime his man growing tired of waiting, oame on into camp. Williamson and I saw and questioned him and realizing that something was wrong sent him back on a fresh camel with some of Williamson's choicest Arabic curses ringing in his ears. He met Lees trying to walk * into camp. The day's march had brought us right into the Batinah and we stopped at kalaj al-Hirth, a prosperous village 7 miles inland from Saham, As we were now about to enter the Bani ’Ali country we said good-bye to Nasir, but retained Ghussun as we were keeping on his camels and camel-men. 3r d K&gt;tage# -^he Go untry of the (Itinerary# Falaj al-Hirth - H&amp;khsah - Wuqbah - Y&amp;nqul - al-Raudhah - Cjfrgiqyirfiffoh' - Khabaitjiah - Sahar), GKadKalfalu At our last camp Shaikh Muhammad bin Hilal of the Bani 'Ali had come to me and invited us to visit Yanqul, the capital of the tribe and residence of his brother Khalifah the paramount Shaikh, The invitation was sincerely given and to explain the motives underlying it I must recount briefly the history of the family.10 IQi&amp;lifah’s grandfather Ghussun had 3 sone Hilal - Ginan - ’Amir, On his death Hilal became ^haikh, Sinan had 3 sons IQmlaf- Sulaiman-MuhammacU IQialaf murdered his uncle Hilal and made himself Shaikh* Bilal 1 s four sons the eldest of whom was Khalifah, the present Shaikh, fled and took refuge with the Muscat Government. Khalaf as Shaikh quarrelled with his younger brother Muhammad, whom he murdered, but, in spite of warnings, brought up iiuhamniad’s two sons as his own. These two as soon as they # reached manhood murdered their uncle Khalaf and were themselves murdered by Khalaf 1 s slaves and followers* There was now no one in Yanqul and a race ensued between Khalifah bin Hilal, Sulaiman bin Sinan younger brother of Khalaf, and Saif bin 'Amir. Khalifah who at the time was Wali of Liwa arrived first, seized the fort and became Shaikh. Sulaim&amp;n thereupon went over to £&gt;haikh *Isa, Saif also had but latejfly joined him at Dariz during his advance into the Bhahirah. With his two cousins in Shaikh ’Isa^ camp both of them awaiting their opportunity to seize Yanqul and the Shaikhdom, iQialifal^s position was becoming most precarious, and he was ready to snatch at any chance of increasing his prestige and getting some help. Twice he had appealed to Muscat Government but without avail, ^sa however bad not still yet advanced beyond hariz and there was time. Perhaps, he thought, this Muscat official, travelling with other Sahibs with a large caravan and spending apparently immense sums of money would help him. At any rate if he made a great show exaggerated reports would reach f Isa who might really think that Muscat, and even the British Government were behind him. (In fact when Lees and Williamson were visiting the peninsular of Q/Btbar some Months later they were asked if they had heard of the party of Sahibs who had turned back Shaikh ^sa from the Lhahirah). This is not to belittle Khali rah* s hospitality which I think was sincere and spontaneous* Both he and his brothers17. had spent long periods in Muscat and had lost much of the bedouin prejudice against Europeans and Infildels. But I oannot help thinking that the invitation to come all the wa&gt; to Yanqul would not have been given had matters been otherwise. But given it was and we were only too ready to jump at the chance offered. Our original plan therefore of working along the foot-hills to the &lt;adi Jizzi was abandoned and we determined to start for Yancul on the following day by way of the Wadi Ahin* 26th Novr . We always found a diffieulty in getting away early when oaiiiing near a village, as the people Insisted on the Shaikh having coffee and breakfast with them, nor could he with decency refuse. V,e were therefore late in setting out again for hills. A fast pace wae possible over the plain but as we re-entered the hills we were forced to drop to a walkl The track led up a small Wadi to the South of the Wadi Ahin into which we dropped at ito junction with the -adi Hibi, which enters from the South and contains the village Hibi, wrongly placed on Hunter's hap. -e left the Wadi and climbed a small pass to Rakhsah, a hollow in the hills beside* a small Wadi with pleasant running water. Lees had turned aside to examine a hill. Immediately he dismounted, the guide given him by Shaikh A-uhammad. tried to take the camels on, whereupon Lees who had begun to olimb the hill, turned back and stopped him. An old bedouin woodcutter then appeared and started chatting with the guide. Lees made another move to climb th« mountain, on seeing which the wood-outter started running towards him and shouting abuse and, as Lees continued on his way, began to throw stones. Lees, a tall, and doubtless terrifying figure in is panama hat, turned and took 3 paces towards the old man crandi shing his geological hammer. This was sufficient: the old mand ran like a hare. Sfcaikh Muhammad oame in the evening to apologise for the incident. We told him that we knew it was only the ' iin ' s ignorance, but that in order to prevent the possibility of such a thing happening again we thought action should be taken against the guide and the wood-outter. He promised to dismiss the guide and to take the wood-outter in irons to Yanqul. We heard nothing more of the matter and I concluded that he18 27 th Novr* 28th ' 29th Novr that he had taken no action, until we arrived at iiahar on our return ficm Yanoul, when juot before taking leave of us he asked what we wanted to he done to the old-t.an, who wae still imprisoned at Yanqul. In this as in ether matters he proved hinself a man of hfes word. Both Lees and Fernandez had had attacks of Malaria, which necessitated a day* a rest at Rakhs&amp;h before we set out for Wuqbah. Dropping into the Wadi Ahin ju«t above the village of Ghadhaifah we kept to the bed of the Hullah, which gradually became narrower as we ascended till we reached a part where there wan a considerable stream with deep pools. In order to avoid this stretch which probably in rainy weather became a series of rapids a road had been built over the side of the Wadie with steps made of stones and local cement ( earuj) at either end from the nullah bed. These were a source of great pride to the tribesmen who had oeveral times warned me to look out for the 'dirjab', I think the cleverness of the idea appealed to them more than the actual steps, which were very ordinary* A short way further on the valley opened out and the first palms of Wuqbah c&amp;7ie in sight. We were welcomed by one gun and much indiscriminate rifle fire. The village itself is very poor but the date plantations are very extensive while bananas, mangoes, limes, grape-vines and other fruits are cultivated. The hand book of Arabid (Vol, 1 Page 268) places Wuqbah in the Wadi Dhank. This is incorrect as it is in the Wadi Ahin some 10 miles below the Watershed on the Batin^h side. Above Wuqbah the valley gradually broadened into a p?.ateau, well covered with jungle bushes and grasses, A short and easy pass brought us over the watershed 2850 ft* which is here not clearly marked, and we camped by pi a. id a well between some low hi!3.s in a *Man&gt;e called Shiga*, One mile beyond stretched from K.W. to S,E, a wide well-wooded plain bounded on the Last by the irregular and serrated black peaks of the serpentine hills which form the watershed and on the by a long regular limestone scarp known as Jabal al-AMadh.* Leec wished to climb this mountain at its central and highest point # and we therefore decided to send the oamp and direct to al-Haudhah^a mosque and well immediately -slow the middle of the scarp, - whilst we should turn aside and make for Yanqul, which lies at the Southern end* Williamson and I would remain there the night as guests; Lees and Gray would return to camp as soon as they had paid their respects to the Shaikh* 30th Novr. Shaikh Khalifah bin Hilal, brother of Muhammad, had evidently determined to give us the most impressive welcome he f f | could manage. His motives for doing so I have already explained* But the almost identical welcome given tc Sir Percy Cox at ’Ibri (Geographical Journal Sept. 1&amp;£5) shows that it is the customary form in this district of receiving those whom they wish to honour. As we approached the town one gun was fired and 10 horse men mounted on goodlokking Arab ponies galloped out to meet us. We had formed up into 2 mj&amp;n lines and were keeping up a continuous chant, moving at a walk, while the horsemen led by Khalifah galloped round us in circles, fhey were followed by lines of tribesmen moving as though at a review and firing their rifles as they came. A n old slave danced up and down in front of our line of camels waving his sword and giving it a twist which made the blade shiver and glint in the sun. Should any camel rider be squeezed out of the line he woula dance before him shouting to him to get back. The tribesnen then formed up in one long line and we stopped at right angles to them. In the arena so formed the horsemen galloped round and round as the line of men chanted and the dancer leapt before them brandishing the sword and keeping them in their places. The circling was followed by horse .races, then camel-races in which Mudhaffar and his son took part. In these the racers clasp each other by the thigh or body, a habit mentioned by Wcllsted X . Finally we moved forward followed by the still- chanting crowd* dismounting outside the village we were led to x Chap. 1320 . % the open Council-Hoube where shaikh Khalifnh and hie brother form««ly received us. The usual coffee and halwah followed. As soon as etiquette allowed, we rose and proceeded to the house set apart for us. This was a strong 2-storied building ovcrlookinga pleasant garden. The upper rooms were high and well-windowed* The beams were painted red and decorated with verses from the Q,uran in white* The Stair-case as in all Arab buildings was very narrow, ateep and low, A pleasant feature, which I saw in no other towns, was the baths, formed by irrigation channels runningfrom the main T'alaj directly under the houses, where special bathing pools were constructed. The water was very clean and cold* I notea as an instance of the prevailing unrest and suspicion that strong grating*were placed over the channel where it entered ana left the house, After a substantial lunch Lees and Gray returned to the camp* Shaikh Khalifah came a little later to talk politics, 1 had noticed that he oould hardly speak and wondered if he haa a bad throat* The reason now became apparent. The night before, he told us, an attempt had been made to murder him. Three of his cousins, bribed it was presumed by Saif bin Amir, determined to take advantage of the absence of Khalifah 1 s brothers (one of whom had accompanied us, and the other had joined us the day before fron* the Batinah) and shoot him. It had become a custom that whoever neld possession of Yanqul fort should be acknowledged as Lhaikh. One of the cons pirators therefore was to enter the fort, whilst the other two were to shoot Khalifah as he oame out from the evening lajlis. But the suspicions of the door-keeper of the fort were somehow aroused, marv and he refused to allow the entr&gt; ; . Realizing that without possession of the fort the plot was bound to fail he warned his brothers and the three of them escaped from the town. There must however have been a disaffected element among the towns-people as Khalifah had lost his voice in haranguing them. The three brothers were caught by Khalifah 1 s horsemen ana imprisoned in the fort. Mudhaffar and the Shaikh then started discussing their fate* Mudhaffar was all for killing them ana instanced the children of Muhammad bin Sinan. 'Wait* said he 'till the Captain21 . ✓ 1st Deer* i 2nd Deer, 3rd Deor. H Captain and his friends have departed, then slay them all, 'Idhrab hi ^-saif wa akal ^sal*. But no decision was made and I have not yet heard of their fate. The ^aikh then turned the conversation to his present position. He protested his and his father’s friendship to Muscat, and reminded us, as was very true, of Yanqul * s loyalty when the Oman tribes revolted* Now he himself was in dire straits and was he to be left in the lutteh? My position was somewhat diff icult. He would not believe that I had nothing to do with Muscat’s policy and could make him no promises. But I told him that I would write a letter explaining the situation and he seemed fairly satisfied. The letter was drawn up and despatched, but in any case it was too late* On the next day news came that Shaikh ’Isa had captured ’Ibri. There seemed nothing else for Khalifah to do but to make the best terms he could, and two days later he set out for 'Ibri, Yanqul village stands in a strong position between the Southern end of the Jabal Abiadh scarp and a high conical peak named after the village. The fort is a large and rambling building in good condition with a low tower, I was so over- helmed with interviews and conversation that there was little time to wander through the gardens, which lie mostly to the West of the town and include lucerne, and millet in plenty. In the meantime Lees and Cray had climbed the scarp and gained a splendid view of the Dhahirah up to the Bir&amp;imi. Oasis. Gray was fortunately able'to spot the mountain, Jabal Ra’is which he had used as one o f hi s points in the Wadi Hawasinah traverse and was therefore MtXM able to check his positions* Bearings were also taken on 'Ibri and Dariz which gave intersections with those taken from Jabal al-Q,ala ! ah* Of our return to Sahar little need be recorded, as our way led back down the *adi f Ahin* One very cold night was passed below Wuqb&amp;h, Instead of branching off to H a £hsah we kept to the Wadi, passing through the villages of (Siadhaifah and Khabaithah.

He sent his son forward to re-assure them but I noticed that they still had their rifles at the ready as we passed. 4th Stage. Country of the Bani _Ka’ab_ (Itinerary.

The Muqabil provided riding camels and two minor ohaikhs of the tribe accompanied us. The Bani, ^mr baggage camels agreed to carry on. The country 8th Dec, lying along the coast between Sahar and Liwa is fertile and well wooded and a very pleasant march brought us to Liwa, The next * day it was decided to c'jmp at Kuniairah, a hamlet some two miles inland from ohinas. On the way Williamson and I turned aside to vasaifin to visit a Baluchi Bhaikh, Muhammad bin oulaiman, famous throughout Oman for his hospitality. He certainly maintained his reputation for when I said we had only come for ooffee he seized my beard (by now quite a respectable one and24, 11th Deer, the backbone of Oman.

Among other things tobacco was being extensively grown. The fort is perched •n a terrace overlooking the valley, and is well built and includes a strong round tower, here the B&amp;ni ^mr e&amp;melmen repented of their bargain and struck work alleging with some justification that they had agreed to come with us along the foot hills and that wc had not told them of our intention to re-enter the mountains* With great difficulty and at the expense of a wasted day we managed to get some from the Wushaihat.

A little way above f Ajib the Wadi narrows to a gorge (el-wajajah) with running water and deep poo^s which the path skirts. At the near end on a shelf over-looking the gorge and at the junction of '^adi Kahfi and Wadi Hatta stands a strong tower whose only method of ingress is by a rope thrown from a window. It holds a garrison of two men supported by Sahar and i x Chapter 15,25 13th and marks the administrative boundary. The garrison levy the usual toll on passers by and have thrown a barricade of teKBtoraa brushwood across the valley floor. From the gap in this barricade runs a cord attached to an alarm bell inside the tower. Lees and ^ray had visited this tower the previous even- ing t when they received a most effusive welcome from the ancient who was in charge. He seized Lees by the beard and appeared to be swearing eternal friendship in a voice whose stentorian tones suggested that he put down their failure to understand him to incipient deafness. Merging from the gorge we passed the village of. Mashabbe-h, the gardens of which have been almost entirely killed by drought, and entered an enclosed plateau dotted with small hills, and saw on our left Hatta, a prosperous looking village belonging to the Hhaikh of Dubai, We then came to a group of villages, the gardens of which are continuous on either side of the Wadi - Salmah, Musaiyif and tfalaj al Wara’, At the latter we were met by a relative of Ma’adhad, In greeting each other they touched noses twice. This was the first time we had seen this custom which we subsequently found was the common form of salute among the Bani Ea f ab, Sir Percy Cox mentions it, and ccneiders it to be a habit introduced from Africa by the slaves. As we advanced up the plateau keeping Jabal Raudhah to our right and the spurs of Jabal bamaini to our left front a wide plain covered with jungle bushes came into view whilst in the far distance a line of sand-hills gleamed red and gold in the sun. The contract between the black and gloomy serpentine hills with their ragged peaks and the smooth and bright contours of the sand dunes was enhanced by the imperceptAbility with which the one merged into the other. There was no marked watershed or pass. The stony plateau loses marking the head of the ^adi Hatta simply Muub itself in the plain which slopes down toward the Dubai Coast, iitirtCii 1 Ci_ l is in striking contrast to such passes as Eajd el-Khabbain,26 , 3Q The reason was explained l&gt;y Lees who found recent marine shells near the Tillage of I'alaj al War* 1 at a height of 1060 ffr* above the present sea 1&lt;vel.

To give him a rest we stayed one whole day here. Herds of cattle were grazing round about - a sight very rarely seen in the Batinah • and ia’adhad had tales of panther to be found which, he said, took toll not only of the flocks but also of grazing camels. He invited us to ®Bhadhah,ki8 brother* s town (though Shaikh balia himself was at dh&amp;rjah). and proposed that we should return to b&amp;h&amp;r by the w&amp;di Jizzi which was exactly what we wisned* Gray x^as no better that evening we informed wali r aaJhaffar and l&amp;’adhac tlxat we should romain here yet another dayj but .‘j-udhaffar who had apparently run out of rice and other commodities was in a hurry to get forward and, as I suspect, persuaded l&amp; , adhad to urge us on.The latter came to me and said that we must move, firstly because all his men were frig) t ened t hat the panther r wcul d de at joy the c am el e, an d th en, when he saw that I remained unmoved by the thought, because we were cloee to the border o f hi s airah and he feared a raid or some sniping of the semp.

They embraced and all was well. That evening at durbar a very amusing argument took p3ace a$ to which side of the Batinah was the more hospitable - the Sahar district North of Khaburah or the Muscat District South* Mudhaffar a arguing on behalf of kusoat won mainly by refusing to allow 17th Deer, any one else to be heard, leaving Lees and ^r&amp;y to follow on the next day, we crossed the Wadi Shi'ah and a small pass, eand. Naj d Shaham, and entered the plain. The, dunes here reach the hills and we'were forced to cross one ridge before dropping into a stony plain, after passing which we turned again into * the first range of hills. Leaving Jahal Abu ^-Milh on our right we passed the village of Nuwaihah and reached Bhara, Ma'adhad's home town and the second in importance of the Bani Ka*ab settlements. The village and gardens are well hidden between two low ridges* The whole population turned out to welcome us* There were no horsemen as at Yanqul but the men formed one long line and chanted, linking arms and swaying frem side to side as swordsmen and riflemen danced in &amp; eiro^Le throwing their weapons into the air. Whilst we had coffee and indeed throughout the rest of the day the dancing continued, * somewhat of the kind seen by relisted at Buwaiq (iAtfqputiCitt) Two lines were formed at a distance of 10 or 15 yards and approached each other in turn to the sound of drums beaten bj^ 4 slaves dancing in a frenzy midway between them.

We must therefore return by the way we had come. This was a sudden blow as, apart from the traveller's maxim ’’Return by another path in a doubtful land” Our coming as far as this would be from a geological point of view bare wasted time i f we could not go forward, Whilst the ^xaikh went off to pray the evening prayer and we were somewhat despondently discussing our plans one of the tribesmen came to tell us that the real reason was that the eamelmen, whose pay ka^^had had insisted on our handing over to him, had as yet received nothing and had refused to go further from their homes. On the Shaikh*s return we put the matter straight to him and by appealing to his honour and playing on his vanity managed to biing him round. But two hours later letters came from kahadhah announcing the murder of Bhaikh ’Isa bin ualih at 18th Beer, 'Ibri and Bhaikh ^alim s return to kahadhah, Wali Mudhaffar had often remarked on my good luck, and now he was almost awed by it. Be thought it supernatural, ’’Hadhdhukum Yaqsir al-Bakh*' he said H Your luck is strong enough to break stones”. And really nothing could have been more opportune, though the news about wjhaikh ’Isa turned out later to be false. But this was not known until we had returned to the Batinah and • * it was quite true that all his forces had retired in confusion to Oman proper, x Doughty, Rage 341, Penetration of Arabia, Page 141,w f, &amp; 29. 19th Deor. with balings written inritation in our hands Ma*a.dhad could no longer 'balk us and we get out with light hearts for H&amp;hadhah. An hour and a hal^s riding over stony plain within the first ridge of hills brought us to the town which #i *»w lies in a broad and bare batheh* The town and gardens lit between the H©rth ^ast ridge ol the valley and uhe fortj, which stands on a small hillock in the middle of the bathah* On the further side and to the West of the town rises Jabal Mahadhah blocking any view of the plains and sand-dunes beyond, bhaikh Salim we found to be an older and more sedate man than his brother ka’adhad* ore frequent journeys to Sharjah and Dubai had accustomed him t© European manners and town-dwellers f amenities, and he was altogether more polished, more intelligent, and broaderminded than hie bedouin brother, whose violent nature rebelled against Salim*s more concil iatory and gradual policy. \*hilst Williamson and I listened 20th Dec. to the local politics and strolled round the gardens admiring the broad and strong water channel and the mango trees and banana palms, Lees climbed Jabal Mshadhah (3400 ft) and gained a splendid view of the hiraimi Oases and Jabfcl Kafit. During our journey from Jabal Raudhah to Hail in the ^adi Jizzi this mountain was constantly coming into view, v/e heard no other name for it but Hafit, nor was any mention made of a village named * , Uqda\ It is as bir Percy Cox states a solitary hogback hill but he fails to distinguish it from such low nills as Jabal Faiyah. In reality, it is a towering mountain rising to about 5000 ft. or nearly 4000 ft above the surrounding plain. Just before we left Mabadhah a message arrived from the bhai^h of the Bani Na*im inviting us to Biraimi. Lack of time forced us much against our will to forego an opportunity which will probably not recur. During his descent from the mountain Lees had a race with his guide. The man so astonished by Lees* speed that on hi o arrival at the general Majlis some half an hour * y/JcL Cevumt bU.30 after Lees’ entrance he hurst into delighted rhapsodies, whereupon t»haikh ^alim formally chri stened Lees 'Abu f l-Jibal M and said that he alone should be known by that title^ M Yes ♦ even if the Khalifah himself should covet it”, Gray who was still sick moved off with i’ernandez and the caravan in the morning whil st Lees Williamson and I stayed to lunch with the hhaikh and set out later. Ih« track crossed a level boulder-strewn plain between high serpentine crags on the left and some low foot hills on the right. Several **dis emerge from the serpentine hills in which there are a number of villages; in order from North to South they are as follows:- Abud, LaKhbaib, Baqlah, Haiwan^Li shgar, Lhatwah, Khabbain, fhe camelmen were supposed t® halt at a well named ^awi ’Ubailah in the *adi of that lame. Hearing on the way that the well wadry they turned aside to the ‘est and, according to their own story, sent messengers to warn us. These, if they were ever sent, did not meet us, binding no one at the well and thinking the caravan had pushed on, we rode forward until we were within two miles of Hail. We were no# well into the hills again* It was nearly sunset and our doubts were confirmed by some bedouin coming from Hail who stated that no caravan had passed that way. Wali Mudhaffar and two men immediately went off to scout round. We sat down to wait and passed an hour. Then one of ka’adhad’s followers, who had been sitting with us all the time suddenl stated that he hid seen the tracks of the caravan branching off to the ^est some 8 miles back. The ^haikh reviled him for not having spoken and we started back. After going three miles Kudhaffar met us and said there was nothing to the “est. It was now dark and everybody was shouting, some to go back, some forward and some to stop whre we were, a b we were still retracing sur steps a faint cry was heard to our left. We turned toward it and carried on stumbling over bushes and through nullahstill we sighted a lamp on a hill to our right. When we pointed it / •ut to the A rabs they refused t0 belleve itt It mu8t31 21st Dec*. 22nd Beor* either a star or a jinn. However we insisted on turning toward it and after a rough ride and a scramble down a small precipice we arrived in camp at 7,30 p,m #l safe but very tired. The well (Tawi Thaqaibah or Tawi al-A^hfa'ir) was in a • holltw surrounded entirely by small hills and would have been very difficult to find even in daylight. Shaikh ] a’adhad and his men were most disappointing. They had apparently no sense of direction and no knowledge of ground, and from the time we were lost did nothing but argue and shout. This was our last day of wandering in unexplored country, V*e followed the V»adi 'Ubailah, which gradually narrows as it enters the hills, to its junction with the Wadi Jizzi along which many European travellers have parsed. Passing a night at Sahailah we turned aside to visit the Persian ruins at Hurah Barghah, and found a delightful camp site under the mango trees of ’Auhi, vdienoe a short ride through a pleasant park land brought us once more to Sahar.
