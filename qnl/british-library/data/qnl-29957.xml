Important negotiations, it is reliably understood, are at present proceeding between the G-ovemment of &amp; the G-ovemmant of Iran for the demarcation of the boundaries between Iran and British Baluchistan and also to restore I normal conditions in the adjoining territories, where the jj local tribal Sardars are reported to have caused unrest and h to have harassed the villagers. A Demarcation Commission, consisting of representatives of the Govt, of India and the Iranian Govt., recently visited the boundary-line and conducted investigations at Jalq,in Iran, and Saravan,in British Baluchistan,which are at a distance of about 20 miles from each other, ihough no final decision has been taken, inquiries at the Iranian Consulate at Karachi show that the terms of the settlement are now being worked out. Information available here also shows that both the Iranian Government and the British Baluchistan authorities have been experiencing trouble from Sardars (heads of tribes) on the border and that the Iranian Government has in consequence recently carried out military measures to combat this trouble. A small military force, together with some aircraft,is stated to have been stationed in the territory for the purpose. TRADE INTERESTS. The villages on the two &lt;sides of the border have consi derable joint trade interests and it is reported that the Iranian Government has recently taken measures, firstly, to regulate the trade between these villages and,secondly, to encourage its development by the construction of a ro&amp;d from Bhabhar to Zahidan,which passes through the towns of Guatar and Mir Javah. » Tr x • xu The construction of a railway from Kerman to either Chabhar or Zahidan,which will link British Baluchistan.with the Trans-Iranian Railway,is also under the consideration of the Iranian Govemwent.

In the event of the Persians raising it, however, we agree with the line which Seymour suggests he should adopt, and subject to your concurrence, we propose to approve the reply suggested in paragraph 3 of his letter. 3. As regards the Residency, you will see that in present circumstances Seymour sees no alternative to adopting/ R.T. Peel, Esq., M.C R£CD. POL. DfcPT. 17, OCT 1938 INDIA OFFICECopy . (E 5838/461/34) No. 539/3/38. BRITISH TEHRAN. 8th September, 1938. My dear Lacy, Your letter of the l?th August, (E 4552/461/34), deals with two allied questions, the possibility of the Persians proposing negotiations on Gulf questions, and the Residency. 2. As regards the treaty question. It is iairly clear that Soheily was the man who was personally anxious to try to get some new treaty with us. Before he went to London he spoke to me about it and said that Samiy meant to raise the matter - which he never did. During my interviews since my return with the Minister foi foreign Affairs and Under-Secretary of State, neither ot them has given any hint of a wish for treaty negotiations. It seems quite on the cards therefore that, with the disappearance of Soheily, the subject will be dropped for a time. The Shatt negotiations will presumably be taken up in Bagdad quite shortly, and I should think it unlikely that the Ministry would want to tackle the two questions at once. 3. If, in spite of all this, the Ministry do say anything to me about negotiations, I think the best course would be for me to speak on the following general lines:- His Majesty’s Government are always anxious to improve their relations with friendly countries, but they are not convinced that this object is served by concluding agree ments which ignore existing difficulties. In the present case/ Lacy Baggallay, Esq., The Foreign Office, London, S.V/.l*case they would not consider a general agreement worth while unless the Iranians were disposed to include in it a recognition of the relations of His Majesty’s Cxovernment with the Arab rulers and a renunciation of their claims to Bahrein and the islands in the Gruli» If the Iranian G-overnment are not so disposed - and His Majesty’s Govern ment are not prepared to offer a quid pro £Uo for the surrender of claims which they believe to be unfounded - it would be better not to engage in negotiations which would be bound to break down on this point, and to continue the system, which has worked well for some years, of removing possible causes of dispute and friction as they arise. Do you think this is a suitable line? 4* As regards the Residency, it is always very difficult to forecast Persian action, but on the whole I remain of the opinion that the Persians, unless some incident occurs or some new personality is injected into the scene on the Persian side, will probably not bring up the question during Powle’s tenure of office. The request for an agr&amp;nent for a successor would give a natural opportunity for them to object to the indefinite continuance of the post on Persian soil, and I should expect them to take this opportunity. If they do, I don’t see what I can say except that I will at once refer the matter to London. This is perhaps not a very brilliant repartee, but I have no other. 5. There is one further point: I think it most unlikely that the Persians would allow the Resident, in case of a war in which the Arab Coast was in any way affected and/and Persia was neutral, to carry on from Persian soil functions which they would probably consider incompatible with their neutrality. (I am assuming that, whatever the theory, there will in practice be neutrals in a future war). In fact I think that in such a case the Resident should at once remove his headquarters to some place where he can be sure of functioning without interference. Yours ever, (Signed) H.

I enclose herein an extract from a letter from Butler, at Tehran, to Oliphant on the subject of Persian Gulf questions, which as you will see, are likely to be raised by the Persian Government before long. Aa regards the references mentioned by Butler, copies of Tehran telegram No. 78 of the 11 th June, of Tehran despatch No.51 of 5th February 1937, and of our telegram to Tehran N o.32 of_the 5th March, 1937, were sent to you under cover of Foreign Office letters of 18th June, 1938, of 22nd March, 1937 and 6th March, 1937 respectively. 2. It is unfortunate that Soheily is determined to take up Persian Gulf questions with us, since we see no basis for an agreement with Persia on the questions at issue. 3. The main difficulty is that Persia, as part of any agreement. POL MPr. 2 0 .jJL 1938 R.T. Peel, Esq. , M.C.C&lt;£ Soj&amp;l agreement, would be required to give up 6-4- j Bahrein, Tamb and Abu Musa, and to recognise our special relations with the Arab rulers on the Western side of the Gulf. We can hardly expect Persia to agree to this without at least some counter-concession on our part which the Persian Government could use for face-saving purposes. But there are no suitable counter-concessions which we can give. 4. Soheily probably wishes to obtain Tamb and Abu Musa in return for giving up Persia’s claim to Bahrein. We should have to refuse to consider this suggestion, as we have refused to consider it many times before. If he were to make a further suggestion that Persia’s face-saving requirements would be satisfied by being granted a lease of Tamb, we might consider the question further. But w£ could not put forward such a proposal without the consent of the owner of the Island, and even then it is very doubtful whether an acceptable settlement could be reached on this basis. 5. As for the Bushire Residency, Butler asks whether we shall eventually withdraw the Residency (as we withdrew fromj P. Z. I 5114 ; ® 8 ^ \ I938 l from Henjam and Basidu) without any £uid ^ro quo* The answer, it seems to us, is that we cannot make very much use of our withdrawal from Bushire as a make-weight in the negotiations, because the Persians can at any moment insist on our withdrawal without any quid iqro quo. If we were to try to use our readiness to withdraw the Residency as a bargaining counter in the general negotiations with Persia regarding the Gulf, the Persians would be tempted, if the negotiations were going badly, to call our bluff by insisting on the Residency’s immediate removal. And how would we look then? • 6. The only point which seems to us to require consideration at the present stage, before Soheily has raised these Gulf questions, is what Seymour, who will shortly be returning to Tehran, must say if and when Soheily raises the question of the removal of the Residency. One possible line of reply would be to say that this is a matter which really need not be discussed, since we have already decided in principle some time ago to move the Residency to Bahrein. The disadvantage of thismmmmm y . this course would be that it would raise the expectations of the Persian Government; they would at once ask when the Resident was leaving Bushire, and we should thereafter be asked every month or so if we could yet give a date for the Resident’s departure, even if the Persians did not take active steps to make his position intolerable. 7. Another possible line of reply would be for Seymour to say that he knows that the question of removing the Residency was at one time under discussion, but that he does not know the result of the consideration which has been given to this question. The disadvantage of this course would be that we should very soon have to make a further communication to the Persians, telling them how the matter does stand, and by that time the Persians might well have formulated a definite demand for the Residency* s removal. We should probably have to rule out the idea that Seymour should allow it to be understood that we have not hitherto considered the question at all, since I understand that our decision to move to Bahrein is very likely known locally. The problem is a difficult one, and we shall be glad if / ) i i 1 iiCopy (E 3987/461/34) f”p r z. i i 5114 ! Confidential. 19 38 j j Extr a ct from letter from Mr. Nevile Butler (Tehran) No. 539/1/58 dated 15th June, 1938. ^64 H '!&lt;*+ i s-aq I have reported in a telegram about the alleged expulsion of Iranians from Bahrein, (No. 78 of the 11th June) , that Soheily told me that presently he would have to take up Persian Gulf questions with us. At the Birthday party I said to him something to the effect that happily there was no serious trouble between our two countries. He demurred a little and went on to say with the greatest geniality that, when he had disposed of various ’questions actuelles* with other countries that he had found requiring settlement, he would really have to take up Persian Gulf questions with us, and I understood him to say that he realised that it was no good expecting that we would give up Bahrein. We were then interrupted. Soheily’s views about the Gulf are discussed in paragraph 4 of Tehran despatch No.51 of the 5th February, 1937, and those of His Majesty’s Government are defined in Foreign 1 Office telegram No. 32 of the 5th March, 1937. Possibly it is worth thinking now whether anything should be added to them. We withdrew from Hen jam and Basidu without any quid pro quo. Shall we eventually do the same as regards Bushire? In the event of discussions of Gulf questions taking place, we would of course insist on the Iranian Government recognising our special relations with the Sheikhs. I wish that we could, as ca make-weight, (a) promise withdrawal of the British Residency from Bushire, and (b) give a date and an early one* If a Persian sees his money he gives you an easier price* And I believe that the Shah, who is ageing and in a hurry over everything, would like to see Bushire and Shiraz clear of Residency traces. In October, .1936, Soheily told me that he had hopes of getting Tamb, and I rather think that Adi said the same to the Minister about Tamb or Bahrein this year. Neither got any encouragement, the Minister replying that we could not make presents of other people* s property. I imagine that there would be strong objections to the Sheikh leasing it to the Iranian Government even under strict conditions. Friends in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs tell us that Soheily is working very hard and trying to get settlements. He has helped us in the very small matter of our Berberis in Khorassan. But his energy may flag in the face of Iranian conditions, and very possibly he will not talk about the Gull again until the Minister is back. I think that we must expect him to do so then.6NCLOSUR* !N POREIGN OFFICE COVERING LETTER DATED tt.9 nrhis Document is llic rrr&gt;r&lt;riy of tfK HHrannlc Ma)o«tyN'*?S&gt;v«rn...e.i. ■ ^ to the Korean Offl e if not required for official o»e/ I 7 'P.

Little Tamb, an uninhabited and waterless island, 1 mile long by 4 mile wide, 8 miles to the west of Tamb, was agreed by the Government of India, the India Office and the Foreign Office in 1908, to depend from that island.* Tamb itself: is an island 17 miles south of the south-west point of Kishm Island and 46 miles north-west of the nearest point on the coast of Trucial Oman, roughly circular in shape, and about miles in diameter. A lighthouse was erected on it by His Majesty’s Government in 1913 (see paras. 25 to 28 below). It is sparsely inhabited and almost waterless. It appears probable that deposits of red oxide are to be found both in it and in Little Tamb. Abu Musa is a larger and more thickly populated island, a few miles nearer to Shargah in 1 rucial Oman than to Lingah in 1 eisin, with good supplies of water, and valuable deposits of red oxide which have been under exploitation for some years, and royalty in respect of which is paid to the ruling family of Shargah. Sirri, 40 miles south by west of Bustaneh, the nearest point on the Persian coast, is more prosperous and fertile than Tamb, and, like it. contains deposits of red oxide, though these are apparently unimportant.! 2. The history and status of these islands is identical. While, however, the Trucial Sheikh of Shargah on the Arab coast still controls Tamb and Abu Musa, on which he flies his flag. His Majesty’s Government, and the Sheikh under protest, have since 1887 tacitly acquiesced in Persian occupation of Sirri. The Persian flag was stated to have been hoisted on Little Tamb in 1901! at the time of the Persian aggression on Tamb and Abu Musa. It was presumably removed at ihe same time as it was removed from those islands; but the Political Resident reported in November 1908 that the Shargah flag had not been flown on Little Tamb by the Sheikh.§ It is not known whether steps have since been taken to do this. 3. The islands are claimed by the Trucial Sheikhs of Shargah as representative of the Jowasimi Arab chiefs, one section of whom in the 18th century established themselves by force or alliance at Lingah and elsewhere in South Persia. The Persian claim to the islands has in the past been based on the fact that the Jowasimi Arab Sheikhs of Lingah, under whose administrative control they were for many years prior to 1887, had for long been Persian subjects governing Lingah as Persian officials, and it was suggested that it was in this capacity that they had administered the islands, which had become Persian territory. The latest Persian claim is based on the fact that the islands, together with Farur, are shown as Persian in a War Office map of 1887 of which copies were presented to the Shah by the Minister at Teheran, under the orders of Lord Salisbury, in July 1888 (cp. paras. 34 and 36 below). 4 . The recent reassertion of the Persian claim to the island of Tamb renders necessary a more detailed examination of the history of that island, and of the islands of Abu Musa and Sirri, the status of which is identical, than would otherwise have been the case. Persian ownership of Farur does not appear to have been disputed in the past; the island is in any event in a different category from Abu Musa, Tamb and Sirri, and no reference is made to it in the present Memorandum. II.—History of the Islands prior to 1887. 5 . It has proved impossible to trace any reference to the history of the islands in the 17 th and 18th centuries.

In 1737 they were attacked in their own territory by Persia * Lor. i, *j3i-2. an( j appear to have made submission, ,t: but it does not seem that Persia retained any hold on Ras-al-Khaima. 6. About 1750 a portion of the Jowasimi tribe crossed the Gulf to aid the Persian Governor of Bander Abbas and Ormuz against the then Shah, when they took possession of Lingah, opposite the island of Kishm, and other places on the Persian Coast. Lingah they continued to hold until the deposition by Persia of the last Arab Sheikh of Lingah in 1887. But for a number of years before that date, while Lingali up to about 1882 remained a tribally administered Arab principality, the ruling Sheikhs had gradually come under the power of the Persian Government, having finally acknowledged Lor. i, 2063 - 4 . themselves Persian subjects, paying to the Persian Governor-General of Fars such tribute as he could exact from them, and governing Lingah as Persian officials. 7. It is not clear whether any effective dominion had been exercised by Persia in the islands of Tamb, Abu Musa and Sirri prior to 1750. It seems entirely clear that no effective dominion was exercised in any of them by her between that date and the seizure of Sirri in 1887. In the intervening period, if not from a much earlier date, the islands were apparently part of the hereditary estates of the Jowasimi Arab Sheikhs, the Sheikhs on the Arab shore having an equal interest with those on the Persian littoral. Their management, administration, and jurisdiction had, however, for many years prior to 1887 by common consent been vested in the chief Jowasimi Sheikh of the Persian coast, viz. the Sheikh of Lingah, but in his capacity of t Pol. Res. to Jowasimi Sheikh and not of Persian officialf—a state of things which would appear to have arisen from the fact that Tamb was for a period used by « Tei. from Pol. Res. Lingah Jowasimi more than by other Jowasimi.No recognition of Persian to s. of s. for i. suzereignty in respect of any of the islands had been made by the Jowasimi p. 4558. Arabs ol Oman. 8. Up to about 1873, owing to the close connection existing between Tamb and Lingah, the Residency authorities at Bush ire took the view that Tamb was Persian, and in the period ending with 1879 several enquiries regarding it are stated to exist in the Residency records. In 1882, however, in reply to an enquiry, the Residency Agent stationed at Shargah, on the Trucial Coast, furnished the Resident with translations of letters to the Sheikh of Shargah which established the rights of the Trucial Chiefs. Copies of these letters were produced in another connection in 1900 by the Residency Agent, who stated that he had himself seen the originals. t©i. from Pol. Res.

The Persian claim was first asserted in 1877, and has been repeated in 1904, 1923, 1926 and 1928. The history of these incidents is as follows. I G. of I. Pro- ceedings, Sept. 1888. § Tel. to Res., Sept. 26 1887. III.—Occupation of Sirri by Persia, 18874 10. In the year 1877 an armed Persian party, with two small cannon, was sent to erect a flagstaff and hoist the Persian flag on Sirri. The Political Resident, the Minister at Teheran, having enquired§ whether the islands were under British protection, and whether any action at Teheran ivas necessary, replied that Sirri and Tamb were beyond the zone of Persian interference, and that the islands belonged to Arab Chiefs under British protection in common with Arabs of the Persian littoral. The Resident separately reported to the Government of India that the islands formed part of the hereditary estates of the Jowasimi Arab Sheikhs; that for many years, however, their management, administration and jurisdiction had by common consent been vested in the chief Jowasimi Sheikh on the Persian coast, viz., the Sheikh of Lingali for the time being ; that the Jowasimi Sheikhs domiciled on the Persian coast had acquired the status of subjects of Persia, and those who governed Lingah had been, in fact, Persian officials qua Lingah ; that the Persian claim was doubtless based on these grounds ; and that, ivere it not for the fact that the Arab Sheikhs of the Oman coast jointly owned the islands, the Persian position could not be disputed. The3 Resident supported his statement with the translation of a letter written in 1877 by the Sheikh Ali-bin-Khalifah of Liugah to the Chief of Ras-al-Kliaima, in which the former “ admits that Tamb is a dependency of the Kovvasim of Oman, and that the Persians have no property there nor any right to ^ interfere, save with the consent of the Chief of Ras-al-Khaima.” In r conclusion, he expressed the opinion that the Persian Government had no good title to the islands in question.|| 11. The Sheikh of Shargah protested to the Resident on 16th October 1887 against the Persian action at Sirri, and asked that similar action at Tamb might be prevented. The Government of India felt, however, some difficulty as to the action to be taken, in view of the fact that Persian Jowasimis had joint rights on Sirri and Tamb, and that one Arab Sheikh only had appealed, and it was agreed, in consultation with the Resident, that, no overt action having been taken by Persia in the case of Tamb, representations at Teheran should be confined to the question of Sirri. w 12. On representations being made, the Persian Government stated! that for nine years Sirri and Tamb had paid taxes to the Persian Government, and that, documents in support of the Persian claim being at Bushire, the Governor had been instructed to explain matters to the Resident. The Governor, however, informed the Resident that “ he had no documents relating to the Persian claim, and that he had wired to the Amin-es-Sultan excusing himself from discussing the question with the Resident.Enquiry was independently made of the Chief of Shargah as to the Amin-es-Sultan’s statement. The Chief’s reply explained the connection of the Governors of Lingah with the island of Sirri, and added that Tamb was uninhabited, and that no taxes had been paid to Persia. He further enclosed three letters from Chiefs of Lingah, admitting the Chief of Shargah’s ownership of Tamb.§ 13. The Persian Government had meanwhile produced five official letters from a former Sheikh of Lingah (Yusuf-bin-Mahomad) in support of the Persian claim to the two islands.I| The Resident,^ after examination, replied “ that he considered that the documents did not bear out the Persian claim, and that weight should not be attached to the statements of the Sheikh in question, who was a dependant and servant of the Jowasimi Sheikh, Ali- bin-Khalifah [cp. para. 10 above], whom he murdered in order himself to become Chief of Lingah,'’ and, the Persian Minister appearing to rely on a statement of Sheikh Yusuf that he had “gone to the island of Sirri to inspect and recover Government (Persian) dues,” the Resident wrote that he considered that “ this statement could not be accepted as establishing or even supporting the Persian claim to possession, nor as sufficient to deprive the Jowasimi Arab family of their ancient and previously recognised rights on that island.” (It may be added that on 29th March 1884 Sheikh Yusuf wrote to the Chief of Ras-al-Khaima fully admitting the possession of Tamb bv the Jowasimis.)§§ The Resident further pointed out that the Jowasimi Sheikhs of Lingah had usually also been Deputy-Governors of Lingah on behalf of Persia; they exercised authority on Sirri island, but it was qua Jowasimi Sheikh and not qua Persian Governor. 14. A reply on the lines of the Resident’s report was sent to the Amin- es-Sultan by 'Her Majesty’s Minister on 2nd March 1888. The Persian Government, on enquiry being made** as to the grounds on which they had annexed Sirri, repliedtf that it was in their possession, being a dependency of Lingah, to which the Legation replied that jurisdiction over Sirri had been exercised by the Governors of Lingah solely in their capacity of Jowasimi Sheikhs, that the traditional rights over Sirri of the Jowasimi Sheikhs had never been disputed and were generally recognised, that the hoisting of the Persian flag altered the existing status, and that it was on this ground that Her Majesty’s Government desired that reasons should be shown for this alteration. The note, after adding that while “ possession, if of long standing, and undisputed, undoubtedly carried considerable weight . . . the argument would scarcely govern in the present instance,” concluded by asking the Persian Government to com municate “ the proofs they possess of the former dependence* of Sirri island on Persian authority.” || Pol.

On the 28th April 1888 the Resident communicated to the Minister at Teheran a copy of the translation of a report drawn up locally for the Amin-es-Sultan, which he had obtained privately, relative to the Persian claims. It appears that “ there was nothing fresh in this report beyond a new claim put forward to the island of Abu Musa,” which, again to quote the Resident, “ has no justification whatever.” In the summer of the same year (26th July) the Minister telegraphed to Bushire that a reply had now been received from the Persian Government that “ as the Jowasimi Sheikhs were Persian Governors of Lingah, they considered no further proof of the justice of their claim necessary.” To this the Resident replied that the Persian reply begged the question, and that the Arab contention as regards Sirri was that the Jowasimi Sheikhs of Lingah represented the family, and derived no right from their position towards the Persian Government. 16. In order to facilitate the disposal of other negotiations, His Majesty’s Government decided in August 1888 tacitly to acquiesce in the Persian occupation of Sirri. Save, however, by such acquiescence, to which reference was made in othcial correspondence with Persia in 1904 (see para. 21 below), they have never in any way admitted or withdrawn their original objections to the claim of the Shah’s Government to the ownership of the island, while the Political Resident stated in 1904 that it was equally clear from the Residency records that the Jowasimi Arab Sheikhs of the Pirate Coast had never voluntarily dropped their claim, which they had formally reiterated in 1895, to proprietary rights over Sirri, any more than over Abu Musa and 'Lamb. IV.—Temporary Persian Occupation of Abu Musa and Tamb, 1904. 17. In January 1903 the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf reported that, trade having to a large extent been diverted from Lingah as the result of the short-sighted policy of the Belgian Customs officials, Lingah merchants were endeavouring to arrange with the Bombay and Persian Navigation Company to make the island of Abu Musa a port of call. He added that, in view of the Sirri incident of 1887, he was apprehensive lest the result might be the advancing of a territorial claim to this island by Persia. The Resident stated that the island undoubtedly belonged to the Jowasimi Sheikh of Shargah, that the Jowasimis did not, however, fly a flag on the island, and that it might be well to advise the Sheikh of Shargah to do so as a si mi of ownership. This course was approved and action talven accordingly. 18. The question having arisen of advising the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaima (a sheikhdom at that time and now dependent from the Sheikh of Shargah) to adopt a similar course in regard to the island of Tamb, which beloimed to the Ras-al-Khaima section of the Jowasimis, the Resident reported that%o far as he was aware, sovereignty over that island had never been asserted by Persia, that the Sheikh of Shargah in his existing capacity as Ruler of Ras-al-Khaima claimed it as on appanage of the Jowasimis of the Arab coast and that he was in possession of documentary evidence in the shape' of letters from two former Arab Chiefs of Lingah admitting the claim of the Jowasimis of the Arab coast to those islands, as against the claim of the Jowasimis of Lingah. It was decided that the Chief should be advised to hoist his flag on Tamb as on Abu Musa, and this was done. 19. In April 1904 the Viceroy telegraphed that the Belgian Customs officials had placed guards on Abu Musa and Tamb, forcibly removed the Arab flags, erected new flagstaffs and hoisted the Persian flag on both islands. This action led to immediate protest by the Sheikh of Shargah who appealed to His Majesty’s Government, under his treaty relations with them, to take the necessary steps to prevent such interference in his territory * P. 737/04. t F.O. to I.O., April 23 190 4 ; I.O. to F.O., May 4 1904, P 2559/04 ' 20. The Government of India, who took a serious view of the incident proposed- to despatch a gunboat to the islands, with * representative of the Sheikh of Shargah on board, to haul down the Persian flag, reinstate the Jowasimi flag and remove the guards to Persian territory. It was decided t however, to give the Persian Government the opportunity to withdraw from the position they had taken up, and on the 24th May the' Minister reportedthat they had telegraphed orders to Bushire to remove the flags and guards from A bn Musa and Tamb, while reserving their right to discuss with ITis Majesty’s Government the respective claims to the island. Their Note,t however, stated that Persia considered “ these two islands as its property,” and proposed that “ neither party ” should hoist flags in them pending settlement of the question. 21 . The Note of reply sent to the Persian Government on 15th June 1904, while expressing willingness to transmit to the Government of India any proofs that the claims of Persia to the ownership of these islands outweighed those of the Sheikh of Shargah, stated that the suggestion that the Sheikh of Shargah should not be permitted to replace his flag, hauled down by the Persian Customs officials, could not be accepted, and went on : “I would remind you, in this connection, that we have not insisted on the Persian Government removing their flag from the island of Sirri till the controversy between the two Governments as to the ownership of the island, which originated many years ago, has been reciprocally settled. The position would have been different if the Sheikh of Shargah had removed an existing flag from Tamb and Abu Musa; what he did was to hoist his own flag upon the islands, which were not yet formally occupied by any other Government, and he has the right to fly it as the first occupant until his lawful possession of these islands is disproved.” 22. The Persian flags were removed, and the Jowasimi flag of the Chief of Shargah re-hoisted in June 1904. No serious attempt was made by Persia to produce proof of Persian ownership,* and the discussion lapsed, though in 1905 a complaint by Persia of the erection of new buildings at Tamb by the Sheikh of Shargah was investigated and found to be baseless.f 23. The opportunity was taken to make it clear to Persia that the status of Sirri was still mb judice, a view in which she acquiesced, and the Persian Government were warned in 1905 that “ the revival of their claim to Tamb meant the revival of ours to Sirri.” V.—Status of Sirri, 1909. 24. The question of granting a concession to mine red oxide on Sirri having arisen in 1908-9, His Majesty’s Government, after consultation with the Government of India, informedj a British firm that, while the status of the island was in dispute, they had never acquiesced in the Persian claim to dispose of concessions on it regardless of Great Britain ; and the Minister at Teheran presented a protest to the Persian Government in April 1909 against their action in granting a concession, in which he reminded them of the caveat entered by His Majesty’s Government and asked them to arrange for the discontinuance of operations on the island by their concessionnaire.§ VI.—1912-3 : Erection of a Lighthouse on Tamb Island. Communications to Persian Government and to Sheikh of Shargah. 25. Early in 1912 it was decided to erect and maintain a lighthouse on Tamb Island.|j With the approval of His Majesty’s Government no communication on the subject was made to Persia,^ but the Political Resident, Sir Percy Cox, was authorised** to obtain the consent of the Sheikh of Shargah, which was granted by the Sheikh subject to an assurance that his rights of sovereignty were not affected.ff Sir Percy Cox in writing to the Sheikh, added that while it was desirable that the Shargah flag should always be en evidence on Tamb, “now at all events this island will be preserved for you by the mere presence of the lighthouse.” 26. In October 1912, in reply to an enquiry by the Governor of the Gulf Ports, Sir Percy Cox statedthat, with the concurrence of the Sheikh of Shargah, a light was about to be erected there. His Excellency replied that “ there was no doubt that the island properly belonged to Persia and that they had to thank the blatant action of the Customs in 1904 for spoiling their case in regard thereto. 1 rejoined that we considered . . . that it + June U 1904, P. 2904/04. * Lor. i, 746, 2138. t Teh. tel. to Pol.

In February 1913 the Persian Foreign Office raised the question with the Minister at Teheran, urging that the ownership of the island was contested by Persia. Sir Percy Cox, on reference being made to him, intimated§§ that he had recently made it clear to the Governor of the Gulf Ports that the ownership of Tamb was not. open to question, and added that “since the correspondence of 1905 the subjects of the Sheikh of Shargah and his flag have remained established on the island ” ; that if the question w’as now reopened His Majesty’s Government would no doubt revive the question of Sirri ; but that a flat refusal to discuss it would probably be best. 28. The matter does not appear to have been taken further by Persia. The light was exhibited at Tamb on 15’th duly 1913, and His Majesty’s Government agreed that notification of its erection should be made to foreign consular representatives in the usual manner by the Government of India. || 1 1 VII.—Statements made by His Majesty’s Government to German Government as to ownership of Abu Musa, 1907-14. 29. It may be remarked at this stage that in the lengthy negotiations which took place with the German Government between 1907 and 1914 over the claim of Messrs. Wbnckhaus in respect of the cancellation of their red oxide concession in Abu Musa by the Sheikh of Shargah, no reference was made to the Persian Government, who were, indeed, privately reminded by the Charge d’Affaires in 1908 of the incident of 1904, and warned against any attempt to renew the Persian claim.His Majesty’s Government con sistently referred, in their communications to the German Government, to the “ sovereignty ” exercised in Aim Musa by the Sheikh, and a quantity of local evidence was produced to show that the ownership of Abu Musa vested in the ruling Sheikh of the Jowasimi of Oman residing at Shargah.| It would clearly,have been impossible for His Majesty’s Government to have taken the very definite line actually taken by them vis-d-vis Germany had the status of the island been, in their view, a matter at all open to dispute. VIII.—Reassertion of Persian Claim to Tamb and Abu Musa, 1923. 30. In 1923 the Minister at Teheran reported that he had learned confidentially that the Persian concessionnaire of the Hormuz red oxide concession, Moin-ut-Tujjar, a person of great wealth and considerable political influence, was urging the Persian Government to raise the Persian claim to Abu Musa, couple it with that to Bahrein, and refer both to the League of Nations. J Sir P. Loraine was instructed by the Foreign Office to draw the attention of the Prime Minister to the incident of 1.904, when His Majesty’s Government had been prepared to take naval action to remove the Persian flag from Tamb and Abu Musa, and hint that revival of the Persian claim might lead His Majesty’s Government to take the measures then contemplated.! 31. The Minister made the required communication to the Prime Minister, making, however, no reference to Tamb in his Aide Memoire. His Highness made no reply on the matter of Abu Musa.|| Ten days later a Note asserting Persian rights over both Tamb and Abu Musa, “ of which notification was made to His Majesty’s Legation in the year 1903-4,” having been addressed to the Minister by the Persian Foreign Office, Sir P. Loraine adopted an uncompromising attitude, and returned the Note to the Prime Minister with a strongly worded covering letter.^ It seemed probable that the despatch of the Note was due to ignorance on the part of the Acting Foreign Minister of the communication which had been made to the Prime Minister, and, the position of His Majesty’s Government having been made clear, the incident went no further.IX.—Persian Customs Interference, at Abu Musa, 1925-6. • )_?. In the autumn of 1925 the Persian customs authorities sent a launch to Abu Musa which inspected the red oxide and removed one bag. On a protest being made, they replied that Abu Musa belonged to Persia. Energetic action was taken at Teheran by His Majesty’s Minister, who reminded the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs of the 1923 correspondence, and subsequent!}' warned him privately that persistence in the Persian claim would make it necessary “to request the Government of India to despatch a ship of war to Abu Musa to uphold the rights of the Sheikh of Shargah.”** 'The Persian Government withdrew, and the customs authorities were instructed “not to take any steps in Abu Musa or Tamb pending reply from Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding status of these islands.” X.—Reassertion of Persian Claim to Tamb, 1928. 33. In July 1928 a Persian customs launch, which had been operating from Tamb for about two months, seized off the south of the island a Debai dhow carrying passengers, to Khassab, on the Arab coast, with a small cargo of sugar and dates, and brought it to Lingah, where the cargo was confiscated as smuggled and the passengers imprisoned. The incident created a very serious situation on the Trucial Coast, the Trucial Chiefs being restrained only with difficulty from immediate reprisals; and its possible reactions proved a matter of grave concern to the Government of India. 31. Strong diplomatic representations by His Majesty’s Government at Teheran secured the release of the dhow and its passengers and crew. The cargo remains under seizure, and a claim for compensation has been met by a reiteration of the Persian claim to ownership of Tamb, based, according to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, on a British Note dated 27th July 1888, signed by His Majesty’s Minister under instructions from the Marquess of Salisbury, then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, communicating a map “ recently issued by the Intelligence Department of the War Office ” for presentation to the Shah on behalf of Her Majesty’s Government. The Charge d’Affaires has indicated that the argument is unsubstantial, while the fact cannot clearly in itself affect the validity of the Arab claim ; but it is clear that in the forthcoming negotiations with Persia, not only the immediate Tamb incident, on which the Government of India have expressed themselves very strongly, but the position of Abu Musa (and of Sirri) will come up for disposal. XI.—Summary. 35. The effective occupation of Sirri by Persia since 1887, and the tacit acquiescence in that occupation of His Majesty's Government, make it difficult, if not impossible, at this stage to dispute the Persian claim, though His Majesty's Government are not estopped by any formal admission on their part from using the Shargah claim to the island for bargaining- purposes. 36. The position is different as regards Tamb and Abu Musa. At no stage has the Persian claim been formally admitted, and at no stage has it been allowed to pass unquestioned. The argument in support of the latest Persian claim as set out in para. 34 above could be strengthened, so far as it has any value, by reference to the fact that the islands are also shown in Persian colours on Lord Curzon’s (unofficial) Map of Persia of 1892, and on the Survey of India Map of 1897.* While, however, the error in question is extremely regrettable from the standpoint of His Majesty’s Government, it cannot be taken as a formal declaration by His Majesty’s Government of their view of the status of the islands, nor, it is suggested, can it be regarded as of substantial importance in view of the consistent repudiation, before and after the dates mentioned, of the Persian claim. ** Teh.

As regards the merits of that claim, the historical summary above- shows that the history of the islands prior to 1750 is obscure; that since that date such authority and sitcli effective occupation as there has been has had its source in the Jowasimi Arabs, who between 1750 and 1820' exercised in the Gulf a maritime control uncontested by Persia. There is nothing to show that those Arabs, having obtained a footing on the Persian coast, thence derived authority over outlying islands. Probability suggests rather that they carried with them to their new settlement a position in the islands which they already possessed. The fact that a section of these Arab intruders later acquired the status of Persian subjects, and held their authority on the Persian coast in subordination to the Persian Government as local Chiefs or Governors, cannot affect any original rights the Jowasimi tribes on the Arab and the Jowasimi tribes on the Persian littoral may have had in common; an intimate connection appears to have been maintained between the two sections of the tribe, and the islands remained their common property and did not become Persian territory ; nor, the islands being held by a Sheikh only on behalf of the tribes, had an individual power to alienate any sovereign territorial rights which he might enjoy qua ruler of these tribes.! Finally, de facto possession resting with the Jowasimi Arabs of the Trucial Coast, it would appear to be for Persia, in the absence of evidence at any stage of effective Persian occupation or of acknowledgment by the Trucial Arabs of Persian overlordship in the islands, to prove the case for alteration of the status quo. 38. As between His Majesty’s Government and the Trucial Chiefs concerned, the latter, under their treaty engagements, are entitled to the protection of His Majesty’s Government and are not themselves allowed to communicate or negotiate direct with any foreign Power. Apart from the fact that their claim to the islands has consistently been upheld by His Majesty’s Government, it was on the initiative of His Majesty’s Government that the Jowasimi Sheikh of Shargah and Ras-al-Khaima hoisted his flag on Tamb and Abu Musa in 1903 (see paras. 17 and 18 above). 39. The satisfactory disposal of the matter is important in view of its immediate reactions on the Trucial Coast, and the wider reactions on Mohammedan feeling in India of disturbance in that region. But its importance from its possible reactions on the relations of the Trucial Chiefs with Ibn Sand is hardly less great. J. G. L.

The Iranian party arrived at zahidai about the end of February* Some confusion was caused at first by the fact that it wa^ reported that it was headed by a General Abdul Razzaq, whereas the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had stated that it was under a retired civil engineer named saghairi. General Abdul Raszaq,however, proved to be the same person as Monsieur Ba^iairi,a retired military engineer who calls himself General,but whom the Iranian Government call 'Monsieur'. He is the same officer who was in charge of the irsnian survey party in 1932. 3. On the loth March the Iranian party went to iiabul in connection with a survey of the Afghanistan frontier. They apparently stayed there about ten days, and then they proceeded to Govani,about 125 miles South east of Zahidan t near Bou dary Pillar 11 at the northern end of the demarcated portion of the frontier. From this point they propose ! to work north-v/est towards Mirj&amp;wa, instead of working south-east from the Kuh-i-Taftan rail way station as previously reported. Presumably the survey party has been at work since the end of March. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs have recently informed me that /in The Right Honourable, The Vi so aunt Halifax K. G. ,G.C.S.I., etc., etc., etc. I'tr-v i - 2 - in view of the approach of the hot weather t w&gt; rk will shortly be suspended u^til the end of September. The Gover or of India arranged for an escort of twenty nen under lUsaldar Faqir iTuhanmad of the Chagai Levy Corps to aocompariy the Iranian party arid to be responsible for its security in British territory. It was also arranged that Captain G.A. Cole,Political Agent, Chagai,should meet the Iranian party at Govanl* Instruct ions were issued by the Government of India that the Iranian party should be allowed to penetrate as far into India ns might be Necessary to enable them to carry or out their survey of obtain the necessities of life, provided reciprocal treatment was accorded to the British escort party. 5. This stipulation for reciprocal permission to enter Iranian territory as given rice to considerable discussion with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tehran, who had assumed that the British party would not cross the frontier. The Head of the Third Political Department argued that a distl ction should be drawn between the 1932 survey,when thtrsides sent survey parties,and the present one,when there is only one survey party,sent by the Iran ian Government. The British party was only required as an escort in British territory,^ d therefore need not cross the frontier. Similarly the Iranian escort would remain in Iranian territory,and only the actual survey party would cross the frontier,as their work retired. Repeated efforts have been mad ^ to convince Monsieur zanjani that, given the nature of the frontier region t it is essential that both parties should be able to cross the frontier freely. Some impression seems at last to have been made on him,but he has asked that the reasons for the /Government i ' -Af* 'A iGoveriiraent of India*a attitude should be explained in writing* I have the honour to enclose a copy of the letter which is accordingly being addressed to him. 6* I hope that before work is resumed in the autumn,the Iranian Government will have formally agreed to allow the British party to cross the frontier. in the absence of any reports to the contrary,it seems possible that during the nreaent spell of work,satisfact ory arrang ements may have been made locally. I have the honour to be, With the highest resnect.

Extract from Baluchistan Intelligence Bureau Summary No. 15, dated 15th April, 1938. BOUNDARY 36 . In past Sammaries it has 'been reported that Iranian officials v/ere showing great activity in inspecting ohe Indo-Iranian frontier. These activities appear to he the result of the Iranian 3 -overnment 1 s decision to survey one entire frontier over a period of several years. a start was to he made this year, and orders were issued for Abdur Razaq. Baghaire, a retired Military engineer, with a staff and escort totalling 40 men to survey the border between Koh—i—Taftan railway—station and G-orani. The part ciul^ arrived at Gorani but returned to Zabul after a short stay. It appears that the return of the survey party was due, firstly, to fear of a general attack on them by the Domani tribe, secondly, to the hostility oi the Gamshadzais and Yarmohdzais, and thirdly, to the possibility of the Ismailzais helping other tribes in preventing the carrying out of the survey. It is reported that the party received no helo v/hatever from the tribes and returned ^o Zabul before the attack anticipated by them materialised. It is believed that the party will not attempt to carry out the survey in the near future.Reference Tehran telegram repeated/you as iio.5. Iranian Boundary Survey. 2.

Reference Minister* Tehran^ telegram No.29, dated the 8th April 1938, repeated to Baluchistan as No.5. 2. I enclose a copy of a memorandum No.51-Con, dated the 14th March 1938, from the Political Agent, Chagai, from which it appears that there is reason to believe that the Iranian survey party has abandoned its proposed survey» at any rate for the time being, axid, in these circumstances, instructions have not been issued to the Political Agent, Chagai as desired in External Affairs Department telegram No. 623 , dated the 10th Aprill938.V y &amp; E Copy of a Confidential rcemoranduff; Ko.51-Con, dated the 14th March 1938, from the Political Agent, Chagai. In conversation with Kulian Khan s/o Mir Kiya Khan Reki I gathered, that the Iranian Survey party left Gorani for political reasons and probably are not returning at any rate this year* 2. The reasons are that Mir Jiand Khan Yarmuhammadzai died in Jail in Meshed six months ago. His two sons Paqir Muhammad, and Bejar Khan are still in jail in Keshed. (Shah Sowar jdeceasedl is the father of Sirdar Khuoyar Khan ^armuharamadf zai and the nephew of Jiand Khan). As a result neither the Yarmuhammadzais nor the Gamshadzais to whom the Yarmuahmmadzais are closely akin and related would go near Survey party nor assist them. They were afraid of arrest, and the Survey party latterly seems to have anticipated a general attack upon them by the Damani tribes, and so moved off before the attack materialised. 3. Kulian Khan and Mir Kiya Khan visited General Abdul Pezza at Gorani and they gathered from him that the General was anxious regarding the hostility of the Gamshadzais, and Yarmuhammadzai*, and the possible collusion between them and the Ismailzais to prevent the Survey which the General wished to carry out. 4. Kulian Khan seems positive, that the Survey Party will not return from Seistan to the Chagai Iranian border for the present. r VFTzr] / o / b i q :&lt; o Telegram R.

My dear Clauson, I understand from a conversation which 'owker has had with Symon that the India Office do not pronose to offer any comments on the Government of India’s telegram No. 1116 of the 29th April to Tehran conies of which were enclosed in your official letter to us No. P.Z. 2897/1937, of the 30th April. In this telegram the Government of India expressed agreement with the substance of Foreign Office desnatch No. 112, of the 25th March to Tehran, on the subject of the Persian nronosal for an Anglo-Persian Consular Convention, but at the same time nointed out that the stock most - favoured-nation article which, in the event of it being imnossible to let the matter dron, the itinister is authorised to suggest inserting either in the pronosed treaty of friendshin or some other future treaty 25t93Nl967i ’’might incre ase the difficulties of maintaining British LDIA %-/»'FlOEj iLOSURE IN V LY LETTER /'consuls ^ 0 . 2 6 1 JUL 1937 M. J. Clauson, Esq. OM 8ECR '’'A!' , POLlTfOAL SECRET DEPT. INDIA OFF’O'’•consuls in Persia in towns in which representatives of ’’other nations are not at present admitted'. 2 . The position seems to us to he as follows:- At present, in virtue of Article 9 of the Anglo-Persian Treaty of 1857, we are entitled to most-favoured-nation treatment as regards the estah 1 ishment and recognition onsular officers in Persia. In suite of that, we * consuls at Shiraz, Zahul and Zahedan, three posts where we think we are right in saying there were no other foreign consular representatives, when we first went there and are none now (although there may have been at times in between). Thus we are at present getting more than our strict treaty rights. The article which the Minister has been authorised to suggest inserting in the proposed treaty of friendship or some other future treaty amounts to a re-definition of most-favoured-nation rights. An objection to re-definition is that it might conceivably lead to the treatment 'which we at present enjoy being reduced to within strict most-favoured-nation limits, i.e. it might: (l) lead to the abolition of our posts at Shiraz, Zabul and Zahedan, and ( 2 ) make it difficult for us to open new posts in /townstowns where there are no other foreign consular representatives. 4. With a view to meeting this difficulty it would Ue possible to substitute for the urooosed stock most-favoured-nation article: (a) a vague formula such as 'It shall he free *»to each of the High Contracting Parties to annoint 'consuls-general etc. to reside in the territories 'of the other party. Such consul s-general (This, however, might have an even more restrictive effect than the most-favoured-nation article, since it would merely give us the right to appoint consuls in Persia, without having the right to ~ick and choose as regards place of residence, even among the towns to which other foreign consuls have been appointed.) (b) A formula giving reciprocal unrestricted rights as regarcls place of residence. (it seems pretty certain that the G-overnment of Indie, would not consent to this. ) (c) A unilateral clause, e. g. an undertaking by Persia to admit British consuls to any place in Persia in return for some corresponding concession (preferably not in relation to consuls) from His Majesty’s Government. /But(But it is most unlikely that the Persians, on their side, would in any circumstances give us the unrestricted right of appointing consuls in any nart of Persia). 5. The only remaining course is not to h;'ve any new consular article and rely on the usages of the oast. This, as exolained in our despatch to the Minister, is what we want and hone to he able to do. Tie stock most-favoured-nation article was given to the Minister for use only in the event of it oroving imoossible to let the Persians' suggestion for a consular convention droo. If it does orove imoossible, then for the reasons given above, the stock most—favoured—nation article seems to be the best of a not very good choice of solutions of the difficulty. 6. In the circumstances, therefore, there seems, you agree, to be no reason v/hy our instructions to the Minister to whom we are sending a cony of this letter, should not stand.——P.Z.2897/37.

U My dear Baggallay, With reference to your letter of the 29th April, No.E.2131/809/34, I agree that the Government of India’s express letter of the 1st April is a little . obscure. What, however, I think they mean is that they wish to qualify to some extent their agreement with the last sentence of para.5 of Foreign Office telegram dated 5th March.

Please see P.Z. 1102/37. CKh Besides suggesting a new 'Treaty oi friendship”, the Persian Under Secretary for foreign Affairs in his conversation with Mr.Seymour on February 4th (P.Z.926/37) suggested the possibility of a Consular Convention. Mr.Seymour asked for instructions and we now have the Foreign Office’s draft reply (I am sorry to have delayed the file). The drafts seem satisfactory. Article 9 of une 1857 Treaty prescribes most favoured nation treatment in regard to the establishment and recognition 0 - consuls. If a new Treaty of Friendship is concluded it will supersede the 1857 Treaty. In that case some provision will have to be incorporated to replace Article 9, quite apart from any Persian desire for a Consular Convention. In these circumstances it seems reasonable that an article on the lines suggested by the Foreign Office should be put forward. It appears to be a 'common form' article, and it provides for reciprocity in regard to the grant of official rights, privileges, exemptions, etc., on which the Government of India are always disposed to insist (e.g. in such matters as flying flags and customs exemptions). It may, however, be desirable to let the Government of India have the opportunity of making observations before H.M.Minister takes action. A. draft d.o. letter to the Foreign Office is submitt ed.P.

Mr* Seymour, Tehran, y Wy [ o'o o \ 1937 F 0., March . 1937 Sir, With reference to my telegram No. of the February regarding the proposed conclusion of an Anglo-Persian Consular Convention, I transmit to you herewith a copy of a Foreign Office memorandum (Confidential 13810 of 6th January, 1931) regarding the conclusion of consular conventions and the policy of His Majesty’s Government in regard thereto. 2. as v/ill be seen from this memorandum, and in particular from the considerations set forth in paragraph 21, the principal reason for regarding the negotiation of consular conventions as undesirable is that, apart from the legal dif iculties involved, they must inevitably bring into relief the disparity v,hich exists in many cases between the treatment enjoyed by foreign consular officers in the United Kingdom and that enjoyed by His Majesty’s Consular Officers abroad, and may result in the curtailment •••curtailment of some of the privileges which hnve hitherto been extended to Hie Majesty's Consular Officers in the particular country concerned. The general attitude of His Majesty's Government on this question has not materially alt( red since the memorandum was drawn up. 3. His Majesty's Government are at present under nn dblig. tioii to give Persia most-favoured-nrtion treatment in regard to the establishment and recognition of consular officers, as a consequence of Article 9 of the Tre t^ of 1857, and Persian Con, ulr r officers in the British Empire (except in India, where Persian and Afghan Consuls are specially fav Hired) are in fact accorded precisely the sa ie treat ment in these resx)ecta as those of other foreign countries. Apart from this His Majesty's Government are at present under no contractual obligations towards Persia in regard to the treatment of Consular officers. In practice however they make no distinctions between any foreign countries in this eu tter. du :*1 * 1 , iIn regard to customs privileges alone do they insist upon reciprocity, hut as the customs privileges granted to foreign Consuls in this country are restricted within the narrov/est » limits, few countries find it impossible to comply with this condition. 4. As the same time 1 realise that in spite of the limited effect of Article 9, if literally interpreted, it would probably be undesirable, having regard to the attitude of the Persian authorities towards His Majesty’s Consular officers, to allow the Treaty of 1857 to be terminated without making some alternative provision in regard to Consular affairs. If therefore it should prove impossible to let the matter drop (which I should much prefer) either because of the prospective supersession of the Treaty of 1857 by a new treaty of friendship or for any other reason, you may, subject to your further observations, suggest the inclusion, either in the proposed treaty of friendship or in some other future treaty, as the case may be, of an article on the lines of the •.. *the foliov.ing formula, hich ia taken from the Board of Trade’s standard draft commercial treaty on which all of the more recent general cormaorcial trer ties between the United ingdom and other countries are based; * It shall be free to each of the High 'Contracting P rties to a point consuls- 'general, consuls, vice-consuls and consular 'agents to reside in the towns and porta of 'the territories of the other Party in which 'such representatives of any other nrtion 'any be admitted by the respective Oovermaenta. uch consuls-general, 'consuls, vice-con, uls and consular agents, 'however, shall not enter upon their 'functions until after they shall have been 'approved and admitted in the usual form by 't e Government to which they are sent* 'The consular officers of one of the 'High Contracting parties shall enjoy in 'the territories of the other Party the 'same official rights, privileges and 'exemp tions, ••M exemptions, provided reciprocity be granted, 'as are, or may be, accorded to similar 'officers of any other foreign country. This formula appears in commercial treaties dating back to 1821 and also appears in recent commercial treaties with Germany, Greece, Portugal, Roumania and Turkey, among many other countries. You will observe that unlike the Treaty of 1Q57 it provides specifically for reciprocal treatment in the matter of rights* privileges and exemptions. 5. The possibility must also be borne in mind that a detailed discussion of consular appointments and privileges might lend the Persian Government to raise afresh the question of the appointment as Consuls in Persia of officers of the Indian Foreign and olitical i f dr- Department, ' /.

At same time it may he useful to you to know that His Majesty's Government would not in fact feel justified m signing treaty of friendship unless the Persian Govemmeno first, recognised their special relations with the Sheiks of the Persian Gulf.

But although his Majesty s Govern ment could not sign treaty unless the position in the Gulf were thus regularised, they do not particularly mina if this position remains unchanged. In other words, they v/ould be gratified n the Persian Government were to recognise their special relations with the Sheiks, but are not prepared to ofter them any special inducement to make them do so. 3 0 You may use this information at your discretion in any future discussions on this subject. 4.

But you need say nothing about this at present. 5. As regards Baluchistan frontier, please await observationsi of Government of India. Subject to these you may reply as follows. While in principle His Majesty s Government and the Government of India see no objection to Persian proposal, they doubt whether the conditions on this particular frontier necessitate the trouble and expense involved in full demarcation. If, however, any part is to be demarcated, they suggest that work should be started on the southern section (see in this connexion paragraph 2 of Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen’s letter of the 24th December, 1955 to Mr. Rendel, and enclosure No. 5 in that letter) 6c If you disagree on any of the above points, I shall welcome your observations before you take action. Addressed Tehran ho. 52. Repeated to India, No. 5.Minute Paper. P.Z.1102/37 Department am'B 5000 10/30 The Persian Government, shortly after Mr. Seymour has taken over the post of Minister at Tehran, is again about to raise the luestion* of the conclusion of an Anglo -Persian treaty. This is a question which A. in recent years has generally been revived on the appointment of a new Minister. Previously the negotiations have been for a general comprehensive treaty, and these negotiations were started about eight years ago. At that time our chief desiderata included the retention of the right of Imperial Airways to fly along the Arab coast, the retention of the naval base at Henjam and Basidu, the retention of the Residency at Bushire, and the recognition by the Persians of H.M.G.'s special relations with the Arab Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf, including the withdrawal of the Persian claim to Bahrein, Tamb and Abu Musa (the latter two islands being the property of the Jowasimi Sheikhs of Sharjah g jitb u+auifch* and Ras-al-Khaimah) . The negotiatio and meantime all our main desiderata, except the last, haVfc evaporated: the air route and the naval base haW been transferred to the Arab side, and it haj$ been practically decided on principle to transfer the Residency (it is hoped that a new Residency may be built in Bahrein very shortly, and that the transfer may take place in about two years time). Thus all H.M.G. stand to gain at the present time from a treaty with Persia^fapart from Persian friendship) is the withdrawal of the Persian claim to Bahrein, Tamb and Abu Musa, and the general recognition of H.M.G.'s special position on the Arab side of the Gulf. This is a desideratum of a very negative kind. H.M.G., after consultation/ jconsultation with the Law Officers, have satisfied interests in the Sheikhdom# are now so vital that any enforcement of the Persian claim is really out of the question. Similarly there can he no question of H.M.G. admitting any Persian claim in regard to Tamb and Abu Musa, which in any case are de facto in the possession of the Jowasimi Sheikhs under British protection. The abandonment by Persia of these shadowy claims would therefore be of very little practical value to H.M.G.. As regards Persian friendship, it may be said that relations with Persia have really become considerably more friendly since the treaty negotiations died and the removal of difficulties such as the Henjam naval base and the Imperial Airways’ route in Persia In these circumstances, while any s' general treaty of friendship which the Persians may make should be politely received by H.M.G., it is obviously unnecessary and undesirable for H.M.G. to go out of their way to secure such a treaty. The line which the Foreign Office propose to take is explained in Mr. Baggallay’s letter of 15th February now submitted, and in the draft telegram which he encloses. It is to the effect that, while welcoming any Persian suggestion for a treaty, H.M. Minister should (a) suggest that it should be on very general lines, and (b) fct should make it clear that though H.M.G. would be quite glad to have a treaty of friendship they are not prepared to pay for it, nor are they prepared to enter into one unless the Persians definitely withdraw their claims on the Arab side of the Gulf. It is submitted that we may readily concur in the line of action proposed by the Foreign Office.Minute Paper. Department. One further point arises in this connection, though not perhaps, at this immediate juncture. The only^outstanding* cause of friction with the Persians A a is the treatment by them of British (mostly Indian) subjects and British Consuls in East Iran. A note on this subject (which was prepared for the conversations which took place at Delhi with the Persian Foreign flagged ’A’ below It would appear that there has been some improvement in this respect since that date. For instance, the Legation has .been able to secure compensation for the Authorities during civil disturbances^ Persian Moreover, in his Despatch ofat flag ’B’, Mr Butler reported that the general attitude oi the Persian Authorities at Tehran to matters of this kind had somewhat improved. The subject, however, is one that should perhaps be borne in mind if there is any question of an Anglo-Persian treaty of friendship, and it might be pointed out at some appropriate s^age to the Persians that such a treaty could hardly be made unless H.M.G. were satisfied that the treatment of their nationals in East Persia is in point of fact going to be friendly. It is, however, a matter which would need careful consideration in consultation with the Government of India and H.M. Minister, Tehran, and it is unnecessary to go further into it at this stage, though it is proposed to put the point to the Foreign Ofiice. A draft d.o. letter to Mr. Baggallay at the Foreign Office is accordingly submitted. 531UB 5000 10/36Draft Paper. P.Z.1102/37 -r=T Department. H.L. Baggallay, Esq., Foreign Office. Copy to with co letter secret (/air mail) of Mr. Baggallay ! s \A1K « Ak '‘ P.Z.779/36 2 6 FEB 1937 My dear Baggallay, Please refer to your letter of the 15th February, No.E.809/809/34, enclosing a draft reply to Tehran telegram No.19 about the suggested conclusion of an Anglo-Persian treaty of friendship. 2. We agree that a reply on these lines would be suitable. 3. Apart from the withdrawal of the Persian claims to Bahrein, Tamb and Abu Musa, we are of course anxious also to secure a permanent improvement in the treatment of British Indians in East Persia and in the relations between H.M. Consular Officers and the local Persian authorities. The first two enclosures to Knatchbull-Hugessen*s letter of December 24th, 1935, (to which you refer in your letter) deal with this subject. But it would appear from the Legation's reports during the last year that there has been a certain amount of improvement in this respect, and in any case it is perhaps unnecessary to labour the point at this stage. 4. All we would suggest, therefore, is that before any detailed negotiations are undertaken for the conclusion of aquestion of the treatment of British subjects and H.M. Consuls in East Persia should be reviewed in consultation with the Government of India, in case it may be felt that any proviso or statement in respect of it should be made. 5. As regards the draft telegram, we suggest amending paragraph 4 as shown in the enclosed revised paragraph.tr 4. as regards Baluchistan frontier, please await observations of G. of I. Subject to these you may reply as follows. While m principle H. M.G. and the G. of 1. see no objection to Persian proposal, they doubt whether the conditions on this particular frontier necessitate the trouble and expense involved in full demarcation. If, however, any part is to be demarcated, they suggest that work should be started on the southern section (see in this connection para. 2 of I'r. Knatchbull-Iiugessen 1 s letter of the 24th December, 1935, to lir. Rendel, sent from India, and enclosure Do. 3 in that letter). vMinuteV- er E 810/809/54 of the 8th February enclosing a copy of a telegram from Seymour at Tehran regarding the suggested conclusion of a treaty of friendship between His Majesty’s Government and the Persian Government, I write to say that I have been authorised to discuss provisionally with the India Office a reply on the following lines: 2. The reply would state that Seymour's proposed answer as given in paragraph 4 of his telegram was approved, hut that he should know for his own information ( and should use the information at his discretion) that His Majesty’s Government would not in fact feel justified in signing a treaty of friendship unless the Persian Government first recognised the special relations of His Majesty’s Government with the Sheiks of the Persian Gulf, ^'1 ‘.ml / which/ H MAR 1937 M.J. Clauson, Esq. RECO. PC4. DEPT. 6FEB1937would involve inter alia the withdrawal by Persia of her claims to Bahrain, Tamb and Abu Musa. But although His Majesty’s Government could not sign a treaty unless the position v/ere regularised in this respect, they did not in fact mind very much if the present position continued unchanged. In other words, while they would be gratified if the Persian Government were to recognise their special relations with the Sheiks, they were not prepared to offer them any special inducement to make them do so. 3. As a matter of fact, the only advantage which we still derive from the 1857 Treaty seems to be its most-favoured-nation provisions, and as the -ersian Government will probably find it easy in practice to denounce this Treaty (the greater part of which they could clearly show to be antiquated and out of date) without incurring any more serious penalty than verbal remonstrances, there might certainly be some advantage in transferring these most-favoured-nation provisions into some new instrument. Whether the proper place for them would be a treaty of friendship is perhaps another matter.This is not, however, a point that need hold us up at this stage. 4. As regards the proposed demarcation of the Perso-Baluchi frontier, I do not think it would be possible to refuse definitely to proceed to demarcation, since in principle the more fully frontiers are demarcated the better. But we could point out that in this case full demarcation hardly seems worth the trouble and expense involved. We could also suggest that if any part is to be demarcated it should for preference be the Southern part (as desired by the Government of India: See December, 1935 to Rendel, of which Rendel sent you a copy at the time), t, 2 $sj*$*/&gt;* 5. In order to illustrate more clearly what I have in mind, I enclose a draft telegram, but the actual draft has not been shov/n to or approved by any higher authority here. 6.

This presumably would only be the case if they thought they were getting a sufficient quid pro quo- 3. Under Secretary also indicated that Iranian government were thinking of proposing to mark Baluchistan frontier. They take the view that though there is no dispute as to the frontier it would be well to mark it on the ground and preclude the ■possibility of future disputes.c / 2 . 4.

The papers, chiefly exchanged between HM Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary in Tehran, Horace James Seymour, the Foreign Office, and the India Office, cover: outstanding points remaining to be agreed prior to the signing of any treaty, including the withdrawal of Iran’s claims to Bahrain, Tamb [Greater Tunb] and Abu Musa, and the demarcation of the Perso-Baluch frontier, between Iran and British Baluchistan, now part of Pakistan; the British Government and Government of India’s reluctance to commit to a demarcation of the Perso-Baluch frontier, in part because of the financial implications of such a project; the despatch of an Iranian technical commission between February and May 1938 to recommence a survey of the Perso-Baluch frontier that was originally started in 1932; arrangements for the Government of India’s cooperation with the Iranian survey party, with the support of the Political Agent at Chagai; reports on the Iranian survey party’s activity and progress; a confidential entitled ‘Status of the Islands of Tamb, Little Tamb, Abu Musa and Sirri’ written by John Gilbert Laithwaite of the India Office, and dated 24 August 1928 (ff 45-48); the return of the Iranian survey party to the frontier in late 1938.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
