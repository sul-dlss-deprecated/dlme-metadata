It was not an order, but a notification that the Tapu offlc# would re-open for the transaction of business. It was published in the dally ^Basrah flmes'* from the 5rd to 7th Iff/, 1915, inclusive. Unfortunately for our purposus it we® not issued by the General Officer Commanding but by Sir Henry Bobbs himself as evenae Commissioner. We have not been able to discover my order or proel amotion leBued by the Gene rail Officer Commanding that gave Sir Henry Dobbs eny ^owere at ell, even es evenue Oomr? las loner, nor la there eny definition of his responalbllitlas* for the Tapu Department* There epnear to be no copies available in Mra^ of the General outine Order a of the Amy of Occupation of the period In which such m order ■night possibly have appeared but Sir Henry Bobbs himself say® In his letter that he believes thst no such order was ever publlahed. /Ithout It the notill cation in the Baarah Timea cannot attain the status of an order by the General OlTloer Qomsmndtng and le px*actlcally valueless ao far aa the Paddaghiyah estates ere concerned. You U WtmmAtM IKTOETf, ESQ., M.O.\7 You aA me to give you any infortetton obtainable re ge I 'd lag the extent to which the title to property in Basrah depends on the steps ta en by the Revenue Coin;lasloner under this notification. I em advised that there is little rlek that any Tapu deeds given by the Revenue Cowslesloner in regular manner, and In conformity with Turkish l«w, ',*111 be impugned. You *111 see from the notification Itself that Tapu deeds were to he prepared ''under the -omer lews and 'orders' and it la reasonable to as busk thla was adhered to and that sansds wore laoued In o regular wanner end are, Tor all purposes, valid. The danger of Invalidation of title would only exist where Tapu deeds were Issued irregularly and not in strict conformity with the technical requirements of Turkish law. There are no scsns of ascertninlng whether any irregular deeds were issued, f© know that In the Faddaghlyah case this was so, but it Is qiuite likely that this was the only instance. Briefly put, there is no attack upon the vslidity of the re opening of the Taou Department or of the bona fide tranaeotlons registered therein. The flaw In the Feddeghiysh title deeds exists because the revenue Commleslnner in laaulng them went outside the terms of his notification end, for reasons which at the time eppeered to be good end compelling, granted them not in accordance with the 'lews sind orders'. I am driven to the conclusion that we should not be able to argue with conviction that the non-vtslldatloa of the Tapu deeds Issued for the Paddaghiysh estate would have a serious detrimental effect upon regular Tapu transactlona carried out in tesren during the Occupation. It la the legality of these particular deeds, not the operation of trie Tapu department, which is in Jeopardy.

Bo long, therefore, as the Shaikh was in possession i*e# his 'ta^abs' recognized him aa landlord by paying their 'mallakiy^i^ I landlords dues), so long would it be Impossible to oust the Shaikh. ■« I 9.

In tha first instance the Shaikh would have been a defendant and oould afford to laugb at any effort made to dispoasesB him under the Law, while in the second in stance he would have been placed in the position of a plaintiff , asking for the Law's assistance against tenants3M - 3 - tenants who refused to recognize him, He would then have been called upon to prove ownerabip, which without Tapu Title deeds etc etc., would have hsan far from especially if the head of the local Administration (as was the case) was against him. (See para 4 of Mr.Oabriel's letter), 11. Fortunately as 1 shall show in ay official report the 'ta'abs' have been tactfully managed by the Shaikh and his Lawyer and inspite of all the Mutesftrrif's efforts they have been persuaded to cone to Kuwit, and for the most part, to settle on a 56/44 basis and ateit the Sheikh as their rightful landlord. 18, Only a very few 'ta'abs* have been allowed to set tle on a 50/50 basis, so far, this because their lands were bad or had suffered from floods etc, 13, I an sending a copy of this to the Political Resident Bushire, with enclosures.

My dear Dickson, For your personal information I enclose a copy of memorandum sent by the Mutasarrif of Basra to the Ministry of Interior on the subject of the trouble at Fao,. The trou ble about the proportionate division of the produce seems to j be connected with our old friend the Istihlak Law* The Fellaheen are trying to recoup from the Shaikh^ what they will have to pay in taxes when they market their produce. As the old form of taxation fell primarily upon the landlord their attitude does not seem so unreasonable, but the matter is complicated in this case by the fact that the Shaikh did not pay the old form of tax: and claims that he should be immune from the new. The Prime Minister informed the Ambassador, | when he was tackled on the subject, that other landlords in other parts of the country are settling on a fifty fifty to basis. The change in Mutasarrifs, though it had nothing/do * with the Fao troubles, may, we hope, turn out to the Shaikh's f advantage. The T Iraqi Government will, we feel sure, protect the Shaikh against any really subversive movement by the fellaheen, but they will be less sympathetic to complaints which merely have to do with the division of the produce* i 1 I Yours sincerely, Sd.J»H»B»Nihill, Lt.-Colonel H.H.P.Dickson, 0.1.3., Poli ti cal Agent, Euwa it.3^ Translation of Mutasarrif Basra's memorandum No # C/318, of 27th August 1933, to the Ministry of Interior• Fao Estates• Our memo No#0/261 of 3rd August 1933» As the dispute between the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Fao fellahs reached at last the stage of ownership n Malakiya tr I summarise 'below the history of the Fao lands under dispute# LiluLK IN L^KDo. Reports are current since old that the lands of Fao were a small and limited spot containing a small number of date trees under the Tasarraf of Muntafiq Shaikhs# Eighty years ago, one of those Shaikhs offered same to the Shaikhs of Kuwait, who divided it into parts (Ahwaz) having fi fixed the boundaries, and made the 'Ta T abs T V settle therin^ They had constructed bunds, and planted date trees, thus, these lands became vast due to the addition thereto of lands that appear from the sea each year # At last, the number of date trees in the lands in question amounted to over 7000 'Jireebs'. You will gather from the above that most of the said lands, if notjall, are unalienated Miri ones, because they appeared from the sea, as indicated above# ^v.;^ til-, ^ As a result of local investigations, it appeared that the Ta'ab receives 2/5ths of the produce. The Ta f abs share of the first fifth is considered 'Musha' to him from date trees, and the second fifth is given to hi: for his work, such as, digging out rivers, making bunds, planting date trees, their fecundation of cutting and other falaha works. As regards fruits - which are naturally few - they usually go to the Ta'ab# From this n Ta T amul' at Fao, only some properties, (the number of their Jireebs Tt is estimated at about 40) which are said to have been belonging to A1 Jubran, are excepted. As also a similar number belonging to the Bait of i^ashid, and other few Jireebs, are excepted from the Ta f amul in question. Only l/4th of the produceproduce of these dates trees is to be paid to the Shaikhs of Kuwait, in acoordance with an old procedure based - as stated - on a written will from A1 Subah's grandfather^ J, ^ ^ ^ # The difference between the Ta'abs and A1 Subah is attri buted to the following three reasons: !• It is stated above that the Ta'ab receives 2/5th from the net produce 3 and the remainder goes to the Shaikhs* The fifth of the original fifths of the Shaikhs is deducted, being G-overnraent dues which the Shaikhs used to pay in the tine of the Ottoman Government» This customs continued in force until the application of the Istihlak Law, when the Ta T abs claimed half the produce of the date trees, considering that they are required to pay the 'Ushr' from their own net shares. The Shaikhs of Kuwait have agreed to pay them ^ 44 ^ from the produce, but the Ta'abs refused this division and insisted on claiiling half. Owing to this insistence on the part of the Ta'abs, and the shaikh obstinacy, the difference between the two parties took a serious form. The Shaikhs of Kuwait began, therefore, to stand in the way of the river crafts arriving in Kuwait and which belong to the Ta'abs, on the allegation that these ere u carry smuggled sand, etc. Further, the Shaikhs have fileci. suits againsu certain ra , abs, for the recovery from them of their Malliklya, a fact which led the Ta^bs to ask the Agents of the Shaikhs to produce the document which Drove their ownership. The wnaikhs have obtained Judgement in default against the Ta'abs, but the latter have submitted ob jections to those judgements, thus the eases remained for the agent o^ the shaikhs to produce an agency wherein the 'Tabligh rf and'Taballagh' aliould not be excepted. The case was adjourned until after the vacation of courts. These are the true facts, submitted for information.3?

Conaequently 25 law suits were filed ag against certain Ta'abs for the recovery of the balancos. (bj •Twenty three of the above mentioned suits were filed in the Court at Abul Khesib, and two in the Court of 1st instance at Sasrah. The suits at Abul Shasib Court came up for hearing first, when the counsel of defendant having denied the shaikh's ownership to the land and having requested the Court, passed an order celling upon the2 ~ upon the counsel of the Shaikh to produoo the title deeds. (o) iihaikh's eounsel appeared l^fore Ahul Khasife Court on the day of rahaartag of the ease and was prepared to submit his arguments. Bat whan he was oailed and ap peared %e he found that defendant's counsel was absent and therefore asked for an ex parte' judgemant which was accordingly passed. Six Ta'abs accepted the Judgement while 17 Ta'abs objected there-to and the day for hearing iaie objection was fixed for Sunday the 24th October 1933. (d) The two suits in the Basrah Coiart came up for hearing on the 10th of July. One of them dismissed from the Court's Jurisdiction point of view. The other suit under Ho,36 of 1933 was heard (as a test case It was It was a most laportant on© for having been decided by a full b art oh of the central let Instnnos Court}* Th® counsel of defendant brought up the same defence (as in a previous case before the single judge at Abul Khasib) and asked the Court to pass an order calling upon plain tiff's (Shaikh's) counsel to produce the title deed. Plaintiff's counsel argued that defendant's defence was quite irrelevant inasmuch ae the claim was not one for an ejectment or restoration of ownership of property. It was purely a pecuniary one for the value of the balance of dates short delivered by defendant under an oral agreement. (e) The Court therefore rejected defendant's plea, and In view of his counsel's refusal to enewer the plaintiff's claim ordered him to bring his client (defendant) person ally before the Court on the next hearing 18th July 19S3. The defendant and his Counsel having not appeared on the said date (18.7.53) end on the request of the plaintiff's counsel, the Court passed an ex parti judgement against defendant to pay Iraq Dinars SO/- with costs to plaintiff.

Llia ilchs Bii.0 ^stateG, y Sir, In continuation of my confidential despat^Sh No. 209, dated the 6th September 1933 and my telegram No-221, dated the 18th September 1933, I have the honour to make the following report. 2 # When the news got about early in September that the Llutasarrif, Basra, Abdur Razzak al Kilmi was shortly to be transferred to Hilla, an immediate and marked im provement came over the whole Fao situation. A further 36 of the Shaikhs leading fellahs or Sarkals (headmen) came down to Kuwait accompanied by the £haikh T s lawyer, and in a notable interview with the Shaikh confessed that they had been deceived and led astray and wanted to resume their old relations with him. The leaders of this deputation, including three ringleaders in the troubles, next visited me in the Agency and I was able to have a heart to heart talk with them. 'Mh/y clearly believed that His Majesty's Government had been instrumental in arranging for the re moval of the Mutasarrif, and I did not discourage this belief. I told them among other things that the King of 'Iraq and the Shaikh of Kuwait were equally the friends of the British Government and that we would neither countenance the intrimie V A- 2 - intrigues of evil people who attempted to make mi set between these two rulers nor would we fail to support the Shaikh with the T Iraq GoTemment, if they (the Shaikhs tenants) attempted to indulge in any agrarian troubles of a communistic nature, whereby the Shaikhs rights as land lord were threatened. Their bad behaviour as tenants had come to the notice of His Majesty^ Government and His Majesty's Government had decided to interfere and give her fullest support to their frined, the Shaikh, etc. etc* The net result of this visit of the Shaikh's fellaheen was (a) The signing in Kuwait of 'Iltizams' (agreements) in respect of the whole of the Feo property by Sirkals repre senting 70 &gt;5 of the fellaheen on a 56/44 basisj (b) The signing of 'Iltizams 11 on a 50/50 basis by Sirkals representing some 50 % of the tenants: (c) The appointment of a special ^Wakil' from Kuwait to permanentlypreside,and represent the Shaikh, at ?ao. (This person has since taken up his residence in the Shaikh's country house there); (d) The submission of the ringleaders, their recog- mition of the Shaikh of Kuwait as their landlord, and their promise to give no trouble in future. 4« The Shaikh for his part gave handsome presents to all of his Sarkals and in a later suitable speech ex horted them to remember that he and his forefathers had always been their best of friends; that they and their families had worked for and with the Al Subah family, their rightful landlords / for close on 100 years and hacfc* never W cause for complaint. Lastly he urged them to come direct to him should they ever have any other complaints or feel they had a grievance and not permit themselves to beccme the tools of misch^if makers, who wished ill both to the Al Subah and themselves, etc, etc. Sarkals ^en returned to Fao and h 0 ' and 8thul - 3 - 8th October all exoitement may be said to have died down again, and the situation to have returned to as near normal as could 'be expected. 6, The Shaikh tells me that as a result of all this trouble he has, unfortunately, lost in stolen dates, fruit, luoerne grass, firewood, etc, approximately Ks,10,000; and that he has paid, out in presents at Basra, Siba and j ao (including la yers fees) close on Rs*$9 f 000/-, all of which he bitterly said, could have been saved him, had the f Iraq Government played the game and come to his assistance in the beginning by taking action against the ringleaders in the movement against him, as he had originally asked. 7* The Shaikhs lawyer, Mr.Gabriel, who visited Kuwait as recently as 7th to 9th October also told me in recapitulating recent events that a most serious situation, in fact a deliberate and organized attempt to dispossess the Shaikh of his Fao lands had been fortunately safely frustrated. The chief trouble maker in the piece, he said, had been the late Mutasarrif, who, advised that the 'Law of Limitation' would frustrate him k in his efforts to oust the Shaikh by direct methods, had deliberately gone to work to get the fellaheen to revolt, declare the Shaikh to be no landlord of theirs, to testify that they themselves were the original and true' landlords, to refuse to pay rental, and lastly to appeal to the 'Iraq Government to assist them get justice. 8, All would have gone well for the Mutasarrif, added the lawyer, had he not made the tactical error of sending verbal orders to the 'Ta'abs' (fellahs) to refuse to hand over to the Shaikh any dates or produce generally from his property, and to claim protection from the 'Iraq G-overn- ment against the Shaikh, who was an interloper. These orders were, he said, actually given to the Mukhtar of Fao- 4 - JTao who passed them on to the Shaikhs fellaheeru The Shaikh4 lawyer countered the move by immediately writing officially to the Mutasarrif and in viting him to deny that the said orders had been issued by hinu He added in his letter that he had been uold by the llukhtar himself and the recalcitrant fellahs that he (the Mutasarrif) had issued such orders. The Mutasarrif -i-n a -dilemma was forced to deny the story* This saved the -situation, but the Mutasarrif to the end tried to revenge himself on the lawyer» 9« Another factor in righting the situation was the straightforward conduct of the QaimLvIakam of ^iba, in Y /hose administrative area the Shaikhs i ?ao lands lay• apparently and contrary to the Mutasarrif^ orders mentioned above, issued urgent instructions to the fellahs that unless they ceased acts of sabotage and agreed to pay their landlord his rightful dues, he would proceed most rigorously against their ringleaders• 10 # These contrary orders from different administra tive superiors caused uncertainty and an early split among the fellaheen, and gave the Shaikhs lawyer, as well as the Shaikhs Agent, the opportunity they sought^ They visited the fellahs and by diplomatic and tactful means made them see the error of their ways. It was at this juncture that they were persuaded to go to Kuwait and make their peace with the Shaikh. 11,, The Shaikhs lawyer added that the affair has ended as successfully as it has by the sole efforts of the ShaiMi .himself and the ^aimmakam of Siba. He was most strong on the point that neither the Government of T Iraq nor the late Mutasarrif gave any assistance or help at all from the beginning, on the contrary apparently did all in their power to attack the Shaikh and wrest his property from him. In his {the lawyer's) opinion had not~ 5 - had not the Assyrian question come up and distracted attention in Baghdad, nothing short of a British warship at j ao would have restored the situation. 12, As it is, the lawyer, Mr^Gebriel, gave it as his considered vie?/ that the 'Iraq G-overnnent would come back to the attack with even greater vigour as soon as they had cleared up the Assyrian mess. His underground inform ation from aghdad, which had rarely been at fault, he said, convinced him that the trouble was only scotched, not ended. 13. I apologize for the length of this letter, but I am most anxious that you get a true picture of recent happenings and what people are thinking about, for I regret to say that I also take the view that we shall hear more of this JTao business later if not this year then next, and probably just before the dates ripen once more. 14 # In conclusion, I note that in some quarters there is a tendency to think that the whole Fao trouble is nothing more than a noisy dispute as to what percentage of the produce the fellahs should pay the Shaikhs I trust that my above remarks will show that the trouble has had a much deeper and significant origin. The mere fact that the Shaikh has gone Tt all out tf to avoid the 'Iraq 'Courts' and arrive at a direct settlement with his tenants, was because he and his lawyer, Mr.Gabriel, realized in time the trap they were being shepherded into. Although a settlement has been arrived at, it should be realized that the Shaikh has given away much in money and prestige and, it will take him sometime to recover the ground he has lost with his tenants.

Dear Helm, Would you kindly refer to your letter to Donaldson, No.E.4945/308/93, of thejBth September, about the date gardens of the Sheikh of Koweit# I am very soi^ry that owing to great pressure of more urgent work I have not been able hitherto to deal ?/ith this. 2. We are glad to note from the letter in question that the Treasury are prepared to consider, without prejudice to the issue of principle, the basis on which compensation in respect of tax exemption could be paid in the event of compensation being ultimately agreed upon. 3. We agree in the first place with the opinion expressed by Humphrys at the meeting of 12th June that now that the Law Officers have advised that a definite obligation rests on His Majesty's Government to compensate the Sheikhs in respect of any imposition of the Istihlak tax on the produce of those of their date gardens covered by the undertaking of 1914 the payment made by His Majesty's Government/ . Helm Esq.., C.B.S., Foreign Office, S. ¥. i. I yyvhi Government should 'be a sum directly related to their losses. 4. Secondly, in considering the basis of compensation it seems important to bear in mind that the exemption promised in 1914 was in terms perpetual and without limit or time, or, save to the extent that it is confined to the descendant^ of Sheikh Mubarak of Koweit, and to 'yourself and for your successors from among your male descendants 1 ' in the case of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, of beneficiary. The Sheikhs of Koweit remain independent rulers, but the Sheikh of Mohammerah has relapsed into subjection to Persia and it is conceivable that he will have no 'successor' 1 in the special and semi-independent feudal circumstances which we can, I think, reasonably claim to have had in mind in entering into the engagement of 1914. This fact is relevant to the question of the basis of compensation which is discussed below. 5. For convenience, I deal in the first instance y /ith the position of the Sheikh of Kowe it. , The main alternatives open appear to us to be (l) the payment annually of a sum sufficient from time to time to indemnify the Sheikhs in respect of any annual payment which they may have// c/ (9^ have to make to Iraq despite the obligations entered into 'by us in 1914; His Majesty ! s Government to remain liable for such payments so long as the descendants of Sheikh Mubarak hold the gardens covered by the 1914 pledge. (2) A corresponding payment for the lifetime of th^ present Sheikh only- (3) The capitali sation on the basis of the value of a perpetual exemption (? 23 years 1 purchase or thereabouts) of the present cost of the exemption; and the payment thence annually to the Sheikh and his successors of the proceeds of the capitalised sum. (4) Payment to the Sheikh of an immediate lump sum representing the capitalisation referred to in (3), the Sheikh thereafter becoming liable for such taxation as the Iraq Government might impose on his property in common with other similar properties, and His Majesty's Government's obligation under the 1914 pledge being finally liquidated. The Foreign Office or Treasury may have further alternatives to propose, and we do not suggest that the above list is exhaustive. 6« Woods at the meeting of 12th June made it clear that there would be strong Parliamentary objections to any annual grant and I think we should all agree as to this#/(,1 this. The India Office, I think, feel strongly that having regard to the terms of the original grant we cannot, at any rate, in the case of i he Sheikh of Koweit, regard our obligation as discharged merely 'by the indemnifying of the present Sheikh during his lifetime in respect of demands of the nature covered 'by the 1914 pledge from Iraq. The position in the case of the Sheikh of Mohammerah may be rather different. His expectation of life is probably very small and, as suggested in paragraph 4 above, the position may enable us with a clear conscience to regard our liability as discharged on his death. 7. Subject to further discussion with you and the Treasury we should, I think, at the moment rather be inclined to suggest that the best course in the case of the Sheikh of Koweit would be capitalisation on the basis of the value of a perpetual exemption and the payment thence annually of the proceeds to the Sheikh and his successors within the limits of the .1914 pledge. As was pointed out at the meeting of 12th June there is some advantage in a procedure of this nature. It avoids the nocessity of returning to Parliament year after year for a grant to the Sheikh; and it gives us an/7' an additional hold over the Sheikh, since if he behaves hadly it will be open to us to withhold payment in any particular year. But it raises certain points which you will no doubt consider# The first is whether the capitalised value of a perpetual exemption is likely to produce a revenue markedly below the burden imposed at the moment on the Sheikhs in respect of Iraqi demands. As you know, the present scale of Iraqi taxation is relatively favourable to us, but it seems desirable that any arrangement we come to should, at any rate in the tirst year or so, fully meet the Iraqi revenue demands against the Sheikh. 8. Secondly,will such a payment be payable every year, irrespective of whether the Sheikh in fact has to make any payment to Iraq or not? This point is not too easy. On the one hand the Sheikh can reasonably claim not to have the worst of both worlds. In other words, if the annual payment made to him is, say, for the sake of argument, iox, and his payment in three, successive years to the Iraq Government is £x plus 1,000, he could reasonably claim that if in the fourth year the Iraq Government abolished the tax altogether/7' altogether there was some case for the continuance of payment at the rate of £x 'by His Majesty's Government for a certain further period. On the other hand, we do not, of course, wish to saddle ourselves with an indefinite payment in compensation for payments out by the Sheikh which he has in fact ceased to make. A possihl© compromise on this would 'be that we should inform the Sheikh that in the event of the Iraq_ Government ceasing to levy tax for a pei'iod say of 3 years consecutively, the question of the payment under our guarantee would need reconsideration# 9 # As regards the Sheikh of Mohammerah, we can d®al with the matter either on the 'basis of indemnification during his lifetime in respect of payments 'by the Iraq. Government or, as in the case of the Sheikh of Koweit, on the 'basis of an annual payment 'based on the capitalised value of his exemption. But I think that, as at present advised, and subject to your views and those of the Treasury, we should 'be disposed in this case definitely to favour re-examination on the death of the present Sheikh, since we do not regard his position as really analogous to that of the Sheikh of Koweit# On general grounds, however, it would seem desirable if possible/n Is possible to treat him during his lifetime on the same 'basis as the Sheikh of Koweit without prejudice to a possible decision on our part on his death that he had no ''successors', and that we could therefore regard our obligation as exhausted. In such an event, if he were dealt with on the basis of alternative (3) in paragraph 5 above, it is arguable that we might claim that the capital lump sum should revert to His Majesty's Government. 10- I am sending copies of this letter to Woods. The suggestions made in it are very tentative in character and we shall no doubt need to consider the whole question more closely and in greater detail in consultation with the Treasury. But what is said above may provide a tentative basis for further consideration. Yours sincerely, J. G. LWTHWWTE. P m JL u AJuXt fa ciJt t/itx '/'/» 4^31 4 P.Z.6861/33. iTANT. LONDON, i. ¥. 1. 31st October 1933. Dear Helm, I am sorry to have been so long in replying to your letter of the 14th October, No.E.5912/308/93, enclosing a draft reference to the Law Officers about the date gardens of the Sheikhs of Kowoit and Mohammerah. 2. We agree generally (subject to any comments which the Treasury may have to make and the remarks that follow) in the draft reference. But we suggest, in the light of comments by our Legal Adviser, that in lines 12-13 of paragraph 7, the draft as it stands gives perhaps an unnecessarily definite leaa in one direction, and that it might be reworded ti read 11 .. • * . i in 1930, and levied in a different manner* It is for consideration whether any contention based on the international status of the Sh«ikh could be supported in the case of. n 3. Is it not the case as regards the second part of paragraph ? that the Sheikh has compromised his position only in respect of the Bashiyah property? The Iraqis have not yet succeeded in effecting service on him in respect of the Faddaghiyeh property and if our efforts to l Esq.., C^B.E., keep/ :n Office.keep this case out of the courts were to prove fruitless and service in r espect of it we should, I think, 'be disposed, subject to the concurrence of the other interested departments, to advise him to accept service only aft^r specifically pleading and' then waiving (if the Iraqis refused tc accept it) a claim to exemption from jurisdiction on the gruund of his sovereign status. His submission tc the jurisdiction in the case of Bashiyah may be relevant. But it is an isolated incident which cannot in our view carry the weight of a long dealing extending over a course of years, much less operate as a bar for ever from raising the question of sovereignty. The modification involved in the drait would, of course, be a small one. 4. I am sending copy of this letter to Woods at the Treasury. it were to be necessary to advise the Sheikh to accept Yours sincerely, (Sd.) J. C.

It looks as if this mi^it be the preliminary to the 'Iraq Government coming bade to -Qie attack. 3. You, no doubt, are aware that the Mutasarrif, Basra, who relieved Abdul Razzak al Hilmi (See para 2 of my No.258, dated the 15/l9th October, referred to above), was himself relieved after about one month's sojourn in Basra. 4. The latest incumbent, one TAHSSEN BEG ALI, I under stand from a certain British official in Basra, to be rather of the same 'kidney' as was Abdul Razzak, and so may be ex pected to 'return to the charge' where the Shaikh of Kuwait is concerned, as soon as he settles down.

The Al-Subah have now turned their attention to the political task of creating dissension among the different clas ses O j . 5ellaheen, so that they can preserve their control over 4feem those lands, ?/hich they have seized from the legal owners by means of their well known methods. We understand that their j (the Al-subah's) agent at Basrah has been seducing some of the Fellaheen {from the right path) and has begun to give them large presents for the sole purpose of getting them against those who are only claiming their rights. This indeed seems to be a new way of doing things, which may easily be copied by others who want to devour the rights of the Fellah. We bring this to the Government's attention and ask them to seize hold of the hands of the man who is trying forcibly to remove the veil from the eyes of Justice. TEB FiiO FELLAmmTJ. There is much excitement among the fellaheen at Fao similar to what is happening on the Faddaghiyeh Estate against the Al-Subah. The latter are cleverly playing fast and loose f with the rights of the Fellah so as to gain their own ends. We learn also from local sources that the Al-Subah have so ex tended their severe regime as to bring about a general feeling of restlessness among the fellaheen, this, inspite of their (the Fellaheen's) undoubted rights and proved documents. We ask the High Authorities to take necessary action against Al-Subah and compel them to follow the right path and carry out the usual engagements, which exist between than and the Jellaheen. ..e also ask the Government to protect their subjects from the intrusion of such foreigners.

My dear Powle P Please 4th December, 1933. despatch No, G/l^l of November 24th, forwarding a copy of a despatch from Kuwait about the taxation of the date gardens of the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Mohammerah in Iraq. The 'very positive' opinions expressed by the Basrah lawyer of the Shaikh of Kuwait are such mischievous nonsense that I feel they cannot be allowed to pass without comment. 2. Mr. Gabriel asserts positively that the Iraqi Crovernment completely changed their entire revenue system throughout Iraq, necessitating the introduction of extensive new and complicated machinery and the scrapping of the whole of the previous revenue system so laboriously built up on the Turkish pattern since the days of the Occupation, in order to obliterate the comparatively trifling revenue exemptions enjoyed by the Shaikhs of Mohammerah and Kuwait in respect of their gardens in Iraq. -there was in fact no need for the Iraqi Government to use heavy artillery to kill what is, in their eyes, a /very -Golonel T.G.W. Fowle, G.B.E.- 2 - y/ ^ very small t)ipd» They iiave always consis'teii'tly main tained that the promise of His Majesty's Government that the Shaikhs should enjoy their property free of taxation was not binding on the Iraqi Government and that they were at liberty to collect revenue from them. They had only to issue an order to the local Shaikhs and the deed was done. Such an order in fact had already been issued in 1931 and had been postponed at my request for one year oslj!.. They had every intention of enforcing recovery thereafter and coiild easily have done so. 4. Mr. Gabriel is positive that now that they have made the ohaikhs toe the line' the Iraqi Government will go to all the trouble of scrapping their new machinery and reverting to the old system, thereby rendering nugatory all the preparation and labour which has been expended upon the change. It is incorrect to say that the Iraqi Govern ment are losing heavily in their revenue collections since the introduction of the Istihlak system. It was anticipated that the administrative relief given to the cultivators and land-owners might result in a small drop in receipts and provision was made accordingly. Revenue collections are /well- 3 - '7 well up to expectation, the 'budget is Toalanced, and there is no financial necessity for the re-introduction of the old system of land-taxation.

The Mutasarrif, Basra, acting under instructions from the Minister of Interior, Bagdad had very confidentially approached Abdulla al Zuhair, the plaintiff in the Faddaghiyeh Suit and had asked him to accept I.D.2,500/- or a maximum of I.D.3,000/- to stop all further proceedings. 4, Abdulla al ^uhair, under the advice and pressure of his lawyer, Mr.Sulaiman al Shawaf, had so far refused the Mutasarrif's offer, for the following reasons:- (a) He was under written agreement with his lawyer to pay him I.D.2,000/—, whether the case was won or compromised out of court; (b) He had to pay approximately I»ruE50/- (-1 in/- 2 - in court fees, and over and above this, a sum of 1.0,1,500/- to the guarantor who had guaranteed payment of the above court fees to the court in the event of he (Abdulla al Zuhair) losing his case, iir ,Sulaiman al Shawaf, I believe, is the son of the President of the Sheria Court in Baghdad, 5. Clearly, as Mr.Gabriel pointed out, Abdulla al ^uhair could not reasonably be expected to accept I.D.3,000/- 'hush money', when he stood to lose I,D,3,750/- in making payments to his confederates, 6. In the meanwhile, added Mr.Gabriel, the 'Iraq Government appeared to have lost sight of the astut^e Lr.kirza Mohamed, C.I .E., legal adviser to the other two claimants to the Faddaghiyeh Estate (namely the ladies Najeeba and Aida). This person was apparently entirely wide awake to iniiat was going on and fully aware of the secret negotiations in progress between the Mutasarrif and Abdulla al Zuhair, Naturally, said Mr.Gabriel, Mirza Mohamed, would at once come forward as soon as Abdulla al Zuhair'was squared', and demand a similar sum from the Mutasarrif for each of his two lady clients as the price of their keeping their claims out of the courts. In other words, said Mr.Gabriel, if the 'Iraq Government were going to offer financial inducement to Abdulla al Zuhair to withdraw from the case, then they must expect to make similar con cessions to Hajeeba and Aida, v^io had equally strong claims, and a very good lawyer on their side. 7, The above interesting developments appear to me worthy of His Majesty's Government's consideration, firstly because it is possible that the 'Iraq Government may turn round later and ask His Majesty's Government to foot the final Bill under the excuse that it had cost them 'so much' ;~ 5 - tt so much n to persuade the three claimants to compromise the case, and secondly because it affords an excellent example of how state secrets cannot be kept in r Iraq- I am assuming, of course, that His Majesty's Embassy is un aware of the offer to Abdulla al Zuhair. 8. Mr•Gabriel incidentally mentioned that rumours uo the effect that the ^raq (government were trying to com promise the iTaddaghiyeh Case, had already reached the ears of the ladies whose interests he had represented in the 'Bashiyeh' Case and were causing them much anxiety* They had recently visited him and pointed out that the Lower Court as well as the Appeal Court, had given a decree in their favour, and appealed to him to try and find out when the decree 7 /ould be served, so as to enable them to take possession of the Bashiyeh. They (the ladies) had told him that they felt that the Ministry of Justice were holding up proceedings for political reasons which, opined Mr» G-abriel, was probably the case. Mr^Gabriel naively enquired from me as to what was the best way to keep these troubled ladies quiet. 9 # I asked Mr .Gabriel if he thou^it that when the Badiiyeh property was finally taken from the Shaikh of Kuwait and given to his clients, Aether the Shaikh could successfully bring a counter claim against them for the original purchase price. His reply was a definite negative. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your mos t obe di ent s ervant, v * Lt.-Colonel, Political Agent,Kuwait,Confident iai .

Basra _ n i' 1 Dated the 21st Deoember 19Si | ^ear Colonel Dickson, I confirm my telegram of 20th instant reading: 'Istanbul Power of Attorney arrived completely 'correct stop The defect in the previous one due h to clerical mistake stop Our case now very ^ i| 'strong and success very sure stop Copies v 'ill ^ &gt;e forwarded you shortly', My partner had wired me of the arrival of the xower in question on the morning of my departure from Kuwait. [ The telegram must have reached immediately after my departure. and as it was addressed throng His Excellency the Shaikh His Excellency must have opened and known the contents. I did not, therefore, wire to His Excellency. Moreover I am [ sure that you will communicate to His Excellency the contents I of my telegram to you and very kindly explain the reason why I I had not informed him of IHe defect in the previous certified I copy. At this stage of writing I received your very kind 1 telegram reading: Tr Heartiest congratulations on arrival document 'stop Hy best wishes for Xmas and may have 'similar good luck in 1934. Political 304' I reciprocate profoundly and request you to be good enough to accept my sincerest thanks for your good wishes. I am indeed more than glad for the document and am so much encouraged that I am now in a position to express I my humble opinion of the final victory for my client, His Excellency the Shaikh* The position of the plaintiff will, by the existence f of this complete and strong document, be that he may veiy- 6 c very probably obtain a judgement against His Sxcellenoy for uhe cancellation of the Tapu title deeds , and the restoration of the land, but a judgement must likewise be simultaneously issued in our counter claim against the plaintiff for repayment of the sale price, and because the plaintiff is unable to repay the sale price, the land for whiq which he obtains the judgement will be attached and auctioned I through the Execution Department* His Excellency will then have the option to bid for the land and purchase it or let someone else buy it and pay the price thereof to him. In view of the present market value of the ea land in question, I am of opinion that the sale price by auction through Execution Department may not realize half of the price originally paid and for the repayment of which His excellency shall have a judgement against plaintiff. The plaintiff therefore must meet the shortage and as he, the plaintiff , is a pauper he will naturally not be able to meet the claim i/tfien it will be left to His Excellency to ask for his imprisonment if he wishes. The greatest benefit that His Excellency will derive from the judgement for repayment of' the sale price against plaintiff will be that the two co-heirs of the present plaintiff namely Najiba and ^yda owners of 2/3, will refrain from bringing up a similar claim which they are now resolved to bring should the present plaintiff finally succeed in his claim,. The whole case including Appeal, Execution etc. and professional fees may ultimately cost His Excellency the Shaikh at the maximjam about £.3000/-. I am enclosing herewith (in triplicate) copies of the rower of Attorney in question for your kind perusal and record. The text of the present Power is exactly the Serine as the previous one • The only omission in the previou s one was the name of the two identifvi ng witnesses whoseV'/- whose names having been duly inserted in the present power is therefore quite complete. I have therefore not translated the contents. I will, Mien convenient, add the name of the said two witnesses to my previous translation, alter and modify the dates and numbers of the verifications of the present one and have the same retyped; when this is flone I shall not fail to send you copies of same. I am writing to His Excellency about the subject in question in confirmation of my partner's above mentioned telegram to me» x am waiting for the promised Hs.15,000 by His Excellency for qurdah (loan) to the Fellaheen. I am writing and reminding His Excellency, should the occasion arise you may kindly remind him if you consider it advisable.

(428/7/33) Sb%~ Sir I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of a note by the late British Inspector-Oeneral of Agriculture on certain aspects of the Iraqi 'Law Governing the Rights and Duties of Cultivators' which was enacted on June 14th last and came into force on October 1st, three months after its publication in the Arabic Official Gazette. This note was handed to me by Mr. Webster shortly before his final departure from Iraq and represents the views which he himself originally laid before the Iraqi authorities in 1930 at the time when the first draft of the Law was under consideration* A translation of the Law appeared in No. 31 of July 30th of the English 'Iraq Government Gazette', copies of which are forwarded regularly by His Majesty's Embassy to the Foreign Office Library. For convenience of reference, however, I enclose herein an extract from the Gazette containing the full text of the Law. 3. The origins of the 'Law Governing the Rights and Duties of Cultivators' go back to 1929, when a draft was prepared by the joint efforts of a number of prominent Iraqi ght Honourable 'John Simon, G.C.3.I., K.C.V.O., etc., etc., etc.(CI Iraqi politicians, including the then Prime Minister and Yaain Paaha al Hashimi j who were interested in large- scale pump cultivation. The Adviser to the Ministry of the Interior deacrihed the draft in a meiaoranduni to the High Commission of January g7th, 1930 as hadly arranged and on the whole objectionable, despite some good points, since it would impose on the fellaheen a relationship with their employers not far removed from serfdom. Moreover, it proposed to apply to the whole of Iraq an organisation inspired by experience of pump cultivation in the Bagdad and Kut Liwas. Sir Kinahan Cornwallis endeavoured to bring the Minister of Interior round to his view and even produced an alternative draft law to regularise the position and rights of pump owners without depressing the status of the fellaheen and incurring the risk of agrarian unrest. The Cabinet persisted, however, in their attempt to bring the draft law before Parliament and this project was only delayed by a communication from the High Commission to the Ministry of the Interior objecting to the terms of the proposed law on the grounds (l) that it would prejudice the recommendations on land tenure which were then expected from Sir Ernest Dowson as a result of his special enquiry; (2) that one of its articles (providing for unpaid labour) appeared to constitute a breach of the International Slavery Convention to which Iraq had adhered; and ('3) that the local authorities in the Liwas had not been consulted in its drafting. No more was heard of this first draft and the promoters of the Law made no further move in the matter until the termination of the mandatory regime, whentry when a new and siore comprehensive draft was produced and hurried through Parliament. 4. You will observe from the enclosed copy of his note that Mr» Wehster^ the former Inspector-General of agriculture, criticises the Law severely and anticipates trouble among the fellaheen if it should ever be put into general operation* On the other hand Sir Kinahan Comwallis informs me that some of the most objectionable features of the original draft do not figure in the Law as finally enacted. He agrees with Mr* Webster that the Law is essentially an instrument created by a small class to serve their own ends, but he does not think that it is likely to provoke serious unrest, especially as the Law appears incapable of universal application throughout Iraa and is unlikely to be enforced in districts where the interests of its promoters do not require it. Sir Kinahan Cornwallis prefers to keep his detailed comments on the Law until it has been in operation for a sufficient period to show how it is working in practice. In view of the political consequences which may follow from the enforcement of this Law I shall not fail to communicate to you the further expression of his views, with which the Adviser has promised to furnish me in due course. I have, etc., (Signed) P.H. Humphrys.'O SncloBure in Bagdad Despatch No. 807 of 22. 12* 33. Note on 'Law Governing the Rights and Duties of Cultivators No. 28 of 1933'. There Is no doubt that the non-success of a great many new agricultural ventures In recent years has been due^ In part, to the difficulties experienced by the 'farm owner' in establishing control over the 'Lazmah' holders and their fellaheen. For better or worse, the greater part of these newcomers into agriculture have been active politicians, and it was inevitable that they should seek some legal remedy for their troubles. They have been granted very extensive tracts of valuable government land, not only without payment, but also with revenue privileges, provided only that they undertook to exploit such lands. The terms 'development and exploitation' have been universally interpreted as meaning only, the erection of a pump and engine for irrigation purposes, and a subsequent attempt to farm the lands using the 'Laziuah' holder and his fellaheen as the basis of their labour supply, and following the customary share-system of farming, as almost universally practised by existing 'Tapu* holders. Naturally friction followed, for the 'Lazmah' holders regarded the new pump-owner as a mere outsider who supplied water against payment (by crop-share), and themselves as the proprietors of the land and as the sole agricultural authority. Converselyfilf Conversely the pump-owner regarded himself as the proprietor and farmer, and the lazmah holder as his employee. This latter position has now been legalised. It must he remembered that, though the Law under comment deals with all Agriculture, yet it was really occasioned only by this special (and new) type of agricultural practice. The only reason that seems to have been admitted, in the framing of the Law, for the numerous failures of new enterprises, is the difficulty experienced in the control of 'seracil' and 'fellaheen'. There are, however, many other causes equally potent. Among these may be mentioned (a) The sudden slump in Agricultural Prices, (b) The prevalent belief that agriculture is a part-time occupation, necessitating only infrequent visits to the farm, and easily combined with other business or political activity. (c) The frequent complete lack of any real agricultural knowledge or experience on the part of the pump-owner. (d) The disproportion between the area to be developed and the capital available. (e) An irrational expectation that capital disbursed would be recovered in a year or two years' working (most engines and pumps were bought on credit with 'compialaa' (instalment payments) falling due at the first harvest). The new Law cheerfully Ignores all these issues, a: concentratesid conoentratee on the rights of the Parm-ovmer, and the duties of the Fellaheen. The farm-owner now becomes the agricultural authority (Article 3), and unfitted though he may be, gives his orders for sowing, irrigating and harvesting, orders which the fellah is obliged under severe penalties to carry out (Article 18). All advances made to the fellah, all charges Incurred by the farm-owner, are to be regarded as an •Agricultural Debt' recoverable from the fellah (Article 10) These charges and these advances will be incurred whether the venture is a success or not, but if even by bad farming and bad direction on the part of the farm owner, a loss is incurred, then that loss becomes the fellah's debt to the farm-owner. So long as such a debt exists he is legally incapacitated from seeking employment on either a more successful farm, or in Government Departmental Service or in Municipalities or Registered Companies (Article 15). Article 11 (a) admits, in a naive manner, that it is more or less expected that the fellah will be permanently indebted, and allows him a remission from his debt of the value of the seed only for any crop destroyed by a natural calamity. Under Article 13, an indebted fellah may have even his plough and plough animals confiscated, unless he continues to work on the same estate. The valuable, though somewhat vague, rights in Land known as 'Lazmah' seem to be completely neglected, except in Article 49 (4), which lays down that an evicted fellah if he be a 'Lazmah' holder shall still have 'his personal right in the land, and in spite of his eviction his relatives may still use that right according to local custoia 11 • TheoreticallyTheoretically the fellah has certain rights which are to be safeguarded, but when one considers the relative positions of the two parties, should a dispute be laid before a Mudir Nahiya or a Qaimmaqam Qadha, one is obliged to regard the fellah's rights as theoretical only. Practically every disaster that can occur to a crop, damage by fleod, damage by locusts, etc., etc, can be (and most frequently is) attributed to the negligence of the fellah, and Articles 6 (d) and 9 (c) are particularly dangerous when read in conjunction with Article 18. would again insist that the necessity for such a law only became felt when a new, and largely unqualified type of person undertook Agricultural Development. The old Tapu owners and the tribal shaikhs never felt such a necessity and were able to conduct similar enterprises chiefly on the basis of ,, cu8tom ,, . The share of the fellah is such that unless he has his 'customary' perquisites, such as free grazing for a goat or two, free firewood, a certain amount of free vegetables, and a certain amount of 'stolen' produce, it is doubtful if he could exist. The old type 'farm-owner- accepted this, cursed his fellaheen for a set of rascally thieves, but winked at their 'stealing in reason'. The new type of agriculturalist, whilst doing nothing to ameliorate the conditions of the fellah, refuses to tolerate these 'customs', and has provided (Article 49) dire pains and penalties of which the old-type farmer may take advantage if he so desires. I should regard with very considerable misgiving any attempt to implement generally this law. Naturally the fallahaan are, .a yet, unawr, of It, ailatanaa. lt to ^ ^ ^ ba looked upon at « r ,t a, noo.l InJu.Uee', lu oouree,n of time it will come to be understood, and might easily lead to serious trouble. he system which the Law attempts to set up has many points of resemblance with the Feudal System. When feudal chiefs are acceptable (old Tapu estates and Tribal agriculture) it may possibly work, but feudal chiefs need more discriminate selection than was exercised when the state lands were handed over to pump-owners for development* In times of agricultural depression! or in the hands of an unskilful farmer, the fellah under the provisions of the present law, is doomed to perpetual indebtedness, and since he cannot leave the land, he is, in reality, reduced to the status of a slave. Such a state of affairs is almost inevitably- followed, sooner or later, 'by revolution. u. 2.2/-s, *4-^A/%&amp;jll ai ht 1 ml ^ r 9 10 gllf,! 5i8liii ^elegram xx l^rom Secrrtary of State for 'foreign Affairs, London, ^o H.M.'s .Ambassador, -Baghdad.

Shaikh of Kuwaitis date gardens.that His Majesty*® Government might be able to judge in the light of recent developsients (1) how far it was desirable aetually to go to arbitration, and (£) to what extent the threat of arbitration could be used in order to bring pressure to bear upon the Iraqi Government to agree to a satisfactory settlement• It was agreed that, if the Iaw Officers had said that His Majesty's Government «oald be likely to lose their case, then the idea of arbitration would have been definitely abandoned: it did not, however, follow that, because the Law Officers had advised that His Majesty^ Government had a good case, it was now necessary to go to arbitration without first trying to reach a satisfactory settlement. 2, The maetlasthen discussed the last y- / paragraoh of the Law Officers' opinion. ,, ^ y ' ter. Woods said that this paragraph sesased at first sight to indicate that His Majesty's Oovernment could not lose whatever the result /ofof aroitratlou. It was bowsvsr, a qualified opinion and, even If it were a valid one (wblcii in all tb© olreumstangss of the case lie doubted), ne appreciated that the political departnente would be strongly opposed to acting upon it vie—d—vie the Shelxhs. **• t.r. -ieo/iett; thoaght tuat. although the argument in this paragraph might in theory be a sound one, it fall to the ground in the particular case of the oaeikha' date gardens, because there had been a tiiaa since the war when it had been in the power of His Majesty's Qovernioent to see that their undertakings to the Shellhs were implemented, and His Majesty's ttovernaent had failed to take this opportunity, the meeting agree with this view and concluded that His teajesty's Covernment should not be influenced by the last paragraph of the Law Officers' opinion when considering whether or not it was desirable to go to arbitration. S. far* Jielffl observed that in these oireumstances the dangers involved in arbitration remained much as they had been. /TheW 0 The &amp;8st coarse might therefore be to ub Btuob use of the oplaion as posi lble la order to persaad® the Iraqi Gorernaent to o f ree to &amp;a amieable settlement, whleh they «ould bear their fair share of th® reepoaemilty for i®pla®snting the pledgee given to the Shelihs In 1914. Mr. tielffi reoalled that in My, 1932, Sir Fraaeis Hnnphrys had been inatrnoted to approaeh the Iraqi CoTeraaent a tltre oereonnel and nithOBt prejndioe and to Inform thera that, if tne Shelich of Koweit's title could be aade eeonre. Hie Majesty's Uovornment would probably agree to waive their claim to tax exemption for the two Sheiiths, and would arrange taernselvss to compensate both isheikha in reapeet of futmre taxation, provided that the iraal aovernaent for their part abandoned any claim to arrears of tax and undertook to iapoae no diaoriBinatory taxation on the Sheikhs in the fatare. Under a aettleraent of this nature the Iraqi Government would be /bearingdespatoJa Mo* 1997-8 of the 30th Beoamber* 1933, ratiaer suggested tiiat this would in fact profeabl^ be the case); audi it now se®m4 advisable to us© the Law Officers* opinion to persuade tm Iraqi Governj?ient, imking me if necessary of the ttoeat of arbitration, to shoulder the whole responsibility, including any financial resaonsibility involved, for satisfactorily settling the possession side of the question# 6• Mr* Woods agreed that a reasonable compromise was still preferable to arbitration* lie had, however, noted from &amp;owelt letter Ho. 17? of the 6th August. 1933, enclosed in Bushire despatch Mo. 1070-S of the lEth August that the original power of attorney given by the owner of the faddaghiyeh estate to the vendor, empowering him to sell the estate, had been found, and that Mr* Mihill had expressed the opinion that this discovery tod so completely altered / thethe aUuaUon In tie Shelich's favour tliat It »as even desirable ttot he ahoald defend the suit In the Iraqi Courts, it seemed possible therefore that there might now be no question Of the ahelkh losing the faddagiyeh gardens were he to defend the action. if this were so, the oomproffilae suggested last May might no longer be a good bargain for His fcajesty's OtPTmrmmnt . ^ thought that th® eompromlsa suggested offered the best possible solution. The alternative appeared to be arbitration. In spite of the Law Officers' opinloa there would always be an element of risk and if His Majesty's Government lost, they would be responsible not only for the taxation side of the question, bat also for the possession side. Moreover, there was the possibility that the Iraqi Government, if they won, might claim damages in respect of arrears for taxation which had been eotimted at eighty thousand pounds. It was also possible that. If the matter were taken to arbitration, the /arbitratorsarbitrators might find that tha oaiitatlon of Hi a Majesty's CrOvsranant had darolved apoo the Iraqi Governnont. bat that the losses of the Sheikh as a result of the Istihlak tax were not oovered by those obligations. In this event our position would still be Tery unsatisfactory. 6. jar. Laltiwalte agreed. The India Office riew was that, even if an arbitrator found that o«lng to some nicety in the wording of the undertakings Ills Majesty's Government were under no legal obligation to secure for the Sheikhs exemption from the new Istihlak tax. Sis i4ajeaty's Government would still be morally oblifed to eo®pen©ate the Sheikhs for their losses under the tax. fcoreover it was uarticalarly important at the present tise for political reasons to keep the Sheikh of iCowelt well-disposed towards His Maiesty's Government, and the Sheikh was certainly of the opinion that the new tax was covered by His Majesty's /Governsant 'sQorernmut'a unaertaking, it woaid »• qalte liq&gt;os8lble to get hia to appreol«t« the legal point b InrolTed. 9 ' **• iSSiS eonsldered that arbitration «a8 not the oals' alternative to a eoiapromise. If tiie sheiJcli put la a defence in the Faddaglyeh lawsuit, and was saoeeeefal, the only outstanding questions would then be those of taxation and of the jashiyah gardens, fhe position would then be materially altered, and It might be possible to reaeh a ooatproaise •hioh would be aore farourable to ale Majesty's (ioTernaent. i0, Mr. Beckett observed that as yet »e had not even persuaded the Iraqi OOTsrniMat to seeept the settleiaent suggested last May, let alone one nore favourable to His kajasty'a (Jovernment. It was his impression that, while they might agree to settle the possession question, which eonId be done by private negotiation, the Iraqi .linlsters would rather go to arbitration, even thoagn advised that they would lose, and face the Iraqi i 'arllaawnt /witha?tth an adverse decision than propose to t&amp;at body t on tile stros^tli of an agraament viittt His Mnjest^'s uov@rameat # to exempt th@ SlieiXte from taxation or to them coffipeiumtioju thoxight that It wouW la any uase b# extremely fiaxiiieroiis to ailo^ the Sheikh to defend hi* oase unless it was absolutely certain tuat he would wia. If he defended and lost, it would be far more diffioalt for th® Iraqi uovernxaent to prevent his losta^, the gardaae; muoii lirae wonld i»9 loat anfl tii® orotrsss already aacio b.y Sir Hiifflpnr^s In al»-na^otiatlons rait at »e ssaorlfieefi; moreover the Iraqis might argue that, if the i'addagl^eh case were ailowed to go to the eourts, the Jashiyaa ease s no aid be settled the sa!,.e means - and jadgEeat had already seen given against the Sheikh in that oaae. 12. %tr.Laithwaite agreed. He was disposed to tftiM: that it was in any case /undesirabler??? undesirable tJiat these oases shoaid be heard In the courts If it could be avoided. It was impossible ever to be certain of the result of a ease which was heard in the Iraqi courts, and in this case the uncertainty would be far greater owing to the character of the lawyers who were interested in it. ^• w r. otaart.icinf, also agreed. He pointed out that if Hia Majesty's Governraent intended to make the Iraqi Governnent responsible for the settlement of the possession question. the.y should do so as soon as possible. Otherwise the Iraqi Government might put forward the argument that the question had beon so badl^ handled before they became responsible for it, that they could not now settle it satisfactorily. 14. fcr. ' oods still felt that Iror. the point of view of the Treasury it was desirable to know definitely to what extent the discovery of the power of attorney affected the chances of the Sheikh if he defended the Faddaglyeh case. Without this infonaation / itIt se«ia«d impossible to dee ids tbe exact nature of tae eettleoeat wtoloii would be acceptable to His mfasty'B GoTernaent, who would cave their own dlffleultles in yarliaioent. It would be necessary to be able to show that the final settleraent, whatsrer form it took, was a reasonable one. 15. It was agreed that this point should be cleared up, if possible in consultation with Mr. Mihlll, who was believed to be in Sagland, or, if Mr. tJihill was not available, by enquiry of oagdad. It was agreed taat in tbe latter event the telegram to Sir Francis Hamphrys, after stating that, having regard to all the oirontsstances. Hie majesty's aoverns^nt considered tnat no use could in practio® be made of the last paragraph of the Law Off leers• Opinion, saould indicate that, although His Majesty's ^ '' Government still preferred an amicable settlemsnt to arbitration, they considered that, la view of the La** Officers' opinion, /the/ff the Iraqi (iOTermaent sUould bear their full share of responBibility in any auoh settlement Sir francis Huaphrye should be asked for his ooasldered oplaioa oa the effect of the discovery of the power of attorney, and he should be informed that, should it still He decided to seek the solution suggested in i 1- /'w for ® 1 « a Offioetelegram So. 69 of 6th May. the Iraqi Government would have to bear full responsibility for Implementing the pledge to the Sheikh of ioweit as regards possession: His Majesty's Sovernment could not agree to share that responsibility by making the ft L-'v' i ' payment suggested In Jagdad telegram Bo. 9 of llth January. The manner in which the Iraqi Government carried out their part of the settlement would not concern His MaJestj ■ Government, so long as the pledge to the Sheikh was in fact completely implemented. • Mr« Woods asked whether any figures had yet been received from dagdad to show the Qsl/- amount of the Sheikhs' losses tiirougli i I* 1 * \h taxation during the past year, it was explained that His Majesty 's Ambassador at / ijagdadBagdad had been asked to snpfly this Saving of &amp;4t2i hovenbep, bat that ho had not y*t dona ao.

His Majesty's Government eonsider that, having regard to all the circumstances no use can in practice be mde of last paragraph of Law Officers' opinion. Ihey still consider equitable amicable settlement preferable to arbitration, but, since Law Officers think that iraqi Government would in fact lose in ar bitration, they could only agree to settlement by which Iraqi Government would bear fair share of responsibili^ ty for implementing pledges. In order to judge nature of settlement which might be regarded as satisfactory, it is necessary to know whether discovery of original power of attorney to whieh Political Agent at Koweit referred in his despatch No. 177 of the 5th August to Bushire, and which he discussed at Embassy on 28th July, makes it morally certain thatj if Sheikh defended Paddagiyeh suit in court, he would win. Please telegraph your con sidered opinion on this point. If His Majesty's Government then still think that most satisfactory solution would be settlement suggested in ray telegram No. 69(of 8th May)l933, it would be essential that Iraqi Government should bear full responsibility for implementing pledge to Sheikh of \x 2. of Koweit as regards possession, and His Majesty's Gov ernment could not agree to sharing that responsibility by iraklng payment suggested In your telegrarn No, 9 (of 11th January). In any case it Beoms likely from des patch No. 302 of December 19th from Political Agent, Koweitj to Bushire that £2,000 would not suffice for purpose indicated. Question of method by which Iraqi Government carried out their part of settlement would be matter for them and His Majesty's Government would not be concerned so long as pledge to Sheikh was in fact completely implemented by them. When may I expect roply to my telegram No. 9 Savingfof November 24th),1933? Addressed to Bagdad No. 1 Saving; repeated to Bushire; No. 1 Saving. /as practically none of his produce was sold in the 'Iraq market, although some of his tenants' produce was so sold. 4o You will further notice that His Excellency has submitted two statements (Wos.I¥ and which deal respective -ly with serious losses which he was forced to incur (a) in compensating certain tenants {with whom he had no agreement regarding the specified shares of landlord and tenant) in order to assist them meet the 10fo tax, wMch they, as well as himself (the Shaikh.) had to bear on the sale of their date produce: (b) 3y reason of the openly rebellious attitude of his Jao and Faddaghiyeh Fellaheen, a certain number of whom actively stirred up by hostile persons (who need not be mentioned here) started rioting, stealing the dates, and generally showing open defiance of the Shaikh 1 s authority by driving out his agents and refusing to pay him his landlords share of the produce, all of which resulted in the Shaikh losing 7101 maunds of dates valued at Rs.29176/13/- during the 1952 and 19 53 seasons• The Shaikh claims that there were deep political influences at work behind these agrarian riots, which coincided exactly with the introduction of the new Istahlak system of Taxation. He therefore attributes the losses which he incurred then directly to the introduction of new system of Taxation. 5. In submitting his statements IV and V, His Excellency has taken full advantage of my invitation to him (See para.5 of my letter No.291, dated 6th December 1933, quoted above under letter 'A') to give details of any other/- 3 - attlu' t T ^ taS ' n0 ''• ' 1110h that His Sxo.ik^^ 4amala aM ^ ^ ^ unraasonabla, , seloe that he oat, Justly claim that hs ne«h aMoe MSi aia faffiers&gt; ^ ffaMfatter , s a aay trouhhe ,1th „ my ^ ^ ^ behaviour and mo^t most loyal cooperation from his tenants whether '^Taab' or ^Fellah' trUSt tl:iat 1S Ma J e sty's Government in reviewing ikhs various statements of losses submitted with this will not lose sight of the above facts. In conclusion I may say that I have carefully examined all His Sccellency's statements and have compared them all with their Arabic origins, in my opinion His Excellency has taken great pains to put up a fair and reason able case and has care^lly avoided putting forward exaggerat ed figures, which he might easily have been tempted to do. 8.

In such case, I would suggest that they be compiled in the form of statements to be called stateiient (d), (e), etc. so that they are not con fused with the three other statements which I have asked you for above.

Its value lies in the fact that if the Shai&amp;h loses his case it establishes the bona fides of the sale and gives a solid basis for an action for recovery of purchase money, v ' 1 ■ ' ■■ ■' . ■ ■ \ Shaikh^ attorney has however discovered a legal defect in it which may seriously effect its usefulness. It is impossible to forecast how the Court will deal with the case but the chances still are that judguent would be given against the shaikh. There appear to be only two alternatives by which to ensure the retention by the Shaikh of his Faddaghiyah property without the case being heard in Court; (a) legalisation of the Sanad by the Iraqi Parliament, or (b) buying off the plaintiffs. I have commented on these alternatives in my telegram of 11th January Ho, 9, I do not believfe that Parliament would pass the enabling act necessary under (a) during present session and further delay till November would only result in stiffening Iraqi opx^osition to the proposal I see no reason at present to question accuracy of figure quoted to me by King ahazi and Nuri Pasha and endorsed b/ Drower as sufficient for purpose (b) in spite of gossip reported From H.M.

Moreover fact that we were ready to consider such suggestion miprht well give 'Iraq Government impression that we were anxious to avoid arbitration at all ? costs and therefore lead them further to stiffen their attitude, 2« In view of these objections His Majesty f s Government consider that further determined efforts should be made to bring about general settlement on lines proposed ^ in my telegram No»69 of 19 33. It is now clear that this would constitute most equitable and practical solution to whole matter. His Majesty's Government feel that they are on strong ground in pressing for this solution in view of successive opinions expressed by Law Officers of the Crown. You should therefore make further effort to induce ^raq Government to accept solution on these lines. 3.

With reference to your Printed Letter No.324-S, w dated the lath.

In line 10 of the first page. His Majesty's Ambassador says, 'The Shaikh's Attorney has however dis covered a legal defect in it which may seriously affect its usefalness'. If you will refer to my 'Secret' despatch Ho. 309, dated 21st December 19 33 and to my 'Secret' despatch r No.316, dated 29th December 1933, you will see thatthe second Power of Attorney obtained frcm Istambul contained no such legal defect, and the names of the ' two missing witnesses ' were correctly recorded in the document. This fact seems to have been overlooked by His Majesty's Ambassador in his Saving telegram Ii o.3 of 2nd March to the Foreign Office. 3 In line 4 of page 2 of the same Saving telegram, 37 under reference, His Majesty's .ambassador uses the words 'in spite of gossip reported by interested Armenian Lawyer to Political Agent, Kuwait'. With/- 2 - U With the very greatest diffidence, I would remrk that this surely is not quite a fair thing to say of Mr.Gabriel's valuable information as reported in my Confidential despatch No.302, dated 19tli December. After all Mr.Gabriel received his first legal training under Colonel Knox when the latter was Chief Judge in Basra, and later completed same in the Law Schools of Calcutta after the war, where he came out with flying colours. We must, I think, credit him with being sincere and honest until we find him out t o be other wise. 4, In line 6 of page 2 of the same Saving telegram under reference, His Majesty's Ambassador says, n l am in formed til at the Ministry of Justice is considering taking disciplinary action against plaintiff's Attorney on the grounds of 'champerty^. As I acn not a lawyer and know little of legal phrases, I should be grateful if you cculd let me know what the term n champertyS means. If it refers to the action reported to have been taken by Abdulla al Zuhair, the plaintiff in the Faddaghiyeh case(as described in paras 3, 4 and 5 of my Confidential despatch No.302, dated 19th December to you) it would appear as if the contents of my despatch in question had been in some way conveyed to the 'Iraq Ministry of Justice which does not seem quite fair to Mr.Gabriel or the Shaikh of Kuwait.

Despatch No»162, dated 22nd March from His Majesty T s Ambassador, Baghdad to the Foreign Office); I have the honour to draw your attention to lines 8 to 12 of para 6 on page 3 of the said despatch, ^lich read as follows: 'By an oversight on the part of the 'Iraqi Custcans 'the Shaikh had for some years been allowed to M export his household requirements free of duty, 'but the concession was withdrawn two years ago** 2. If you will refer to my Confidential Despatch No-ElO, dated the 8th December 1932, and especially to x paras 7 and 8, also to my Confidential D»0»No,194, dated LjO 28th October 1932, to H.A.Cooper, Esquire, Director of Customs, Basra (referred to in above) copy of which was sent you at the time, you will see that the exemption from Customs duty of the produce of the Shaikh's gardens intended for his ocm household use, was no accident, and was certain ly not by an oversight, seeing that Sir Percy Cox himself confirmed the existing order by telegram to Captain Arnold Wilson in Basra who passed it on to the Political Agent, Kuwait, for the information of the Shaikh. This telegram read as follows: 'From Political, Baghdad (Sir P.Cox) To2 - n To Political, Basra (Captain A .Wilson) No. 6880 * Dated the 1st October 1917 # Following from Political, Baghdad begins.

Quite apart from the above point, I regret to see ^30 that His Majestyis Ambassador in his despatch No.162, refer red to above, seems to think that the Shaikhs claims are excessive and that they should be arbitrarily cut down. I trust that you will use your utmost endeavour with His Majesty's Government to prevent any 'whittling' down of the claims. 4. No doubt all kinds of holes can be found by lawyers and destructive critics in the way the Shaikh has presented his various claims, but we must not forget that his is little more than a Bedouin State, and the methods of his Agents and clerical staff are of the simplest imaginable. As things are the Shaikh has done well, in my opinion, to have kept serious accounts at all, and the case he has presented is to my mind a reasonable, and fair one, nor has he made the mistake of exaggerating. 5. I for one am in favour of accepting the Shaikh's claims as they stand, and am not for damaging His Majesty's Government's prestige and good name further, by attempting to give with one hand, and take back with the other, which the process of 'whittling' dowi after all means. 6. The issue is a plain one: By a combination of circumstances we have (unconsciously no doubt) broken faith with the Shaikh of Kuwait, a friend and ally, in (a) 'The matter of taxation of his Date Gardens'; andand are on the high road (unless we are careful) to break similar faith, in the matter of (b) 'his ownership to these self same gardens'• Surely it is up to everyone of us to see that the fullest and most generous form of restitution is made, when we have the opportunity of doing so* 7« It is my belief that we shall be repaid tenfold, if we do the right thing new, for nothing is appreciated by the Arab so much as 'loyalty to ones word' and the 'amende honorable', when such is due» I have the honour to be.

Losses sustained as a result of the recalci trance of certain of the Shaikh*s fellaheen, claimed by the Shaikh to be direetly due to the introduction of the Istihlak tax# hv f 3* Colonel Dickson is of opinion that the Shaikh's claims should be accepted as they stand. He has commented iB detail, howeTer, only on the claim under III ( b) above (Export duty), vide enclosure to my Printed Letter Ho# C-198 of 11th May 1934. 4. With regard to Statements I and II . Sir ifrancis Humphrys, for the reasons stated in paragraphs 4 and 5 of his despatch, is of the opinion that the correct formula for calculating the loss in the sale price of dates under this head is not 10^ but B/i of their value, and that the totals of the Statements should be reduced accordingly, becoming I.B.706/027 and I.B.729/169 respectively# 5# It would seem that in Making these calculations His Excellency had in mind the previous miri tax, but (vide Foreign Office telegram 3Jo#78 f dated the 13th April 1934, to His Majesty's Ambassador, Baghdad), His Majesty's Govern- ment expect the 'Iraq Government to waive all previous claims up to a certain date. What this date may be is not fb{J) &gt; 7f / certain, but it might well;be the 31st May 1931, the date jj £ on which the Istihlak tax was introduced, and on which the Shaikh was forced by the 'Iraq Government to pay taxes, since/-3~ since while the miri was in operation the Shaikh paid nothing to the 'Iraq Government# 6, If this argument is correct, then for calculating the compensation which His Maj esty 1 s G-overnmeiit should pay to the Shaikh for the future we are only concerned with a computation based on what he has paid under the Istihlak tax. tfhis is 10^ as laid down by the 'Iraq GoTernment# a proportion of this tax the Shaikh, as producer, has presumably passed on to the consumer, as is the custom all the world over, and His Excellency the Ambassador has referred to this at the beginning of his paragraph 5. It would seem, however, very difficult to assess this proportion# 8, fith regard to the question of customs dues on dates referred to in Statements I and II exported for sale to foreign markets I am of opinion that the Shaikh cannot claim compensation from His Majesty's Government. 9 # With regard to Statement III (a\ and (bU Sir francis Humphrys (paragraph 6 of his despatch) considers that compensation for (a) (Istihlak tax| is admissible. I agree# He is of opinion however that the claim for compensation under (b) (Export duty) is not admissible as not being covered by the undertaking of 1914. 55ie authority for the exemption enjoyed by the Shaikh during the period of British Administration is an executive order passed by the Chief Political Officer, Baghdad, in 1917 (vide enclosure to my Printed Letter No#C-198 of 11th May 1934). Whether this order was passed because it was held that the undertaking/«4. \ ■ undertaking of 1914 coTered exemption from export duty as well, is a moot point; and the admission of rejection of the olaim under (b) ^ould appear to foilow|a@cordingly. The sum involved in any case, is a small one as it is only 3$ of a relatively small quantity# iO* fith regard to Statement IT , For the reasons given in paragraph 7 of his despatch. Sir Francis Humphrys is of opinion that this claim should not be accepted. 11# His Excellency writes ^On the other hand, the Shaikh can fairly claim that he has had to iforeigo part of his saleable share of the produce as a direct result of the Istihlak tax. The amounts involved are large, ID.439/815 for 1932, and IB.531/595 for 1933, and if admitted in principle will represent a substantial annuity. The inclusion of tals large item in an assessment of the Shaikh 1 s recoverable losses on account of Istihlak taxation paid can, in my ©pinion, fairly be resisted'. The first sentence of this quotation would prima, facie seem to be inconsistent with the last sent ens e. 12. It may be that the additional proportion of the produce which the Shaikh now pays his cultivators is to compensate the letter for the Istihlak tax which they now pay on that portion of their share which they sell, and on which they did not pay tax under the miri system. 13. Whether the Sheikh is or is not due compensation under this heading is certainly a point for argument. Personally, however, I am inclined to regard it as a private arrangement between the Shaikh and his cultivators and therefore/therefore non-admissible# i»ith regard to St atement Y « Sir Francis Humpiirys is of opinion (paragraph 8 of Ms despatch) that this claim is also inadmissible. I agree. 15. I agree with 3ir ITrancis HumphrjS (paragraph 11 of his despatch) that the produce prices included in the Statements may be taken to be trustworthy as a basis of caloulati on. sd.

After Cofepliments, I should like to inform Your Excellency that both Abdulla al Suhair and his lawyer Salman ash-Shawof, have asked me to write to you with a view to a reconciling and compounding of their case against the Ameer of Kuwait (Eaddaghiyeh Suit). When called upon by the Government of Baghdad (to withdraw the suit) they did not give any definite reply, because they thought of the money that they will have to pay. They, therefore, desire that the case be settled through Your Excellency. Awaiting your reply. Both men are prepared to call on you at Kuwait, if you would like than to do so. Sd/6»'f II y6 NO. 8.

The Iraqi Government, however, did not consider the order of exemption issued 'by the Givil Oommissioner in 1917 as being binding upon them, and it was not included in the promise given to the Shaikh of Kuwait on behalf of His Majesty's Government in 1914. The Customs Department can only take cognisance of exemptions or concessions granted by law. The exemption had no basis in statute or agreement and was, in fact, illegal. Immediately it came to the notice of the British Director of Customs and Excise, orders ^ere issued to the Collector at Basrah to discontinue the practice. The Director of Customs and Excise informed members of the staff of the late High Commission that the free export of these products had been permitted by the Collector of Customs irregularly, without the knowledge of the Directorate, and that it was a pure oversight that the export, free of duty, had been permitted.

This I did to put him on his guard, and not because I have anything against him at all. 3.

No. J Copy, with compliments to H.Nihill, Esquire, Legal Secretary to H.B.M's Ambassador, British Embassy, Baghdad.PRIVATS &amp; CONglD^TIAL,. Basrah, 22nd September 1933. Date Dear Colonel Dickson, I am not surprised to see that by my becoming the agent for His Excellency the Shaikh Sir Ahmed Jaber as Sabah I have opened a wider scope for my enemies to work against me. I say I am not surprised because it is natural that the higher a man rises in the social community the more conspicuous and attractive he becomes, moreover there is no better way to test the importance of one's position in the social community than to know the number and the personality of his enemies. There is no doubt that when one requires the services of some one he will either rely on his own personal knowledge in choosing such a one or that he will accept the recommendation of those who have actually tried and known him. I may be allowed to enclose herewith copies of my testimonials (in triplicate) for your kind perusal, which may prove that I have not been recaamended wrong:ly to His Excellency the ShaiMi, although His Excellency and your goodself have since known me by the services I have rendered so far. Yet another piece of evidence, may I be allowed to cite, is that notwithstanding that I and my partner both being christian and that there being more than a dozen of ?/ell known Mohammedan lawyers at Basrah we are being occasionally chosen by the local Government as law yers to conduct good many important case{§ filed against them. I give the following as an example (a) The site of the Basrah Central telephone exchange case. (b)(b) The famous Tanooma Land case ( Previously occupied by the Port Directorate, Basrah) (c) The site of the Old Government Sarai case(Basrah) Besides the well known British Mercantile and Banking Houses whom we represent we are also permanent lawyers of:- (a) The Shaikh of Aghawat of Mecca 31 Mukarrama and Nazir of their Awqaf at Basrah. (b) His Highness Sayid Hashim Bey the Naqib of Basrah for a yearly retention fee of I.D.150/-. It may be a pride for me to mention that I am a self made man and it therefore suffice me to say that no better man could know and appreciate the value of his standing position and reputation in the social community (which he has attended after very hard struggle) than a man like my humble self, inasmuch as it is natural that anything acquired after hard struggle will be more valu able than that acquired otherwise by ease or chance• It is therefore my fundamental principle to hold fast my standing reputation and position which I have ahieved after such a bitter and hard struggle, and in order to be able to do so I have learned and I have believed to be ^HONEST' as there is no better policy than honesty. With best compliments and kind regards. I am Yours very sincerely, Sd. J♦Gabriel.
