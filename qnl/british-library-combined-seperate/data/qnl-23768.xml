This would cause distress throughout the Gulf by stopping the export of dates, and would reflect badly on the British Government, because of its known influence at Muscat. Stannus would therefore use the powers granted to him by the Imam to warn the commander of the fleet to abstain from any hostile act. Stannus asks Taylor to make representations to the Turkish authorities and people of Bussorah.The letter is accompanied by the following enclosure:extract of a letter from the Imam of Muscat to Stannus, dated 12 July 1826, certified as a true translation by Samuel Hennell, Assistant to the Resident in the Persian Gulf, concerning the financial claims of himself and his subjects at Bussorah [also spelled Bussora] and the orders given to his fleet.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024055009.0x0000b7#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
