Moreover, Bjihrain was also a signatory to the General 'rraty, and yet would be sorely affronted to be called lipon to fly the r, rucial ■plsg I ''here may, too, be some advantage later on in emphasising a definite 'Oawasinl nationality' as opposed to the (let us call it) 'Bani Yas national!ty' of Dibai and Abu '^habl. 8.

POLITICAL.Copy of endorsement No.! 1 #2.1775/36 dated the 30th March 1936 from the India Office, London. I am directed hy the Secretary of State for India to refer to Admiralty letter of 29th June, 1935, No. N.L. 1981/35, concerning the flags of the States of the Trucial Coast, and to forward copy of the letters noted Political Besident*s Express Letter of 1st February,1936, No.233/14/132-11 Government of India's Letter of 28th February, No.F. 356-N/35. 0 in the margin. 2. The Marquess of Zetland coticurs in the suggestion that the Persian Gulf Trucial Coast flag (as shoxvn in 'Flags of all Nations - , plate 31) should in future he jir described as tbucial Coast Flag No.2 (Sharjah and Eas- al-Khaimah)* 1 . He also concurs in the suggestion in regard to the flag flown hy the other Trucial Sheikhs (i.e. an ohlong flag, the length being approximately three times the breadth; about five-sixths of the flag being red and the remaining one-sixth, that nearest the mast, white) provided that the mention of Qatar is excluded. The future description of the fla^,^/ should therefore read ^Trucial Coast Fla^ No,l(Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Debai and the Umm-al-Qaiwain)' 1 . 3. His Lordship agrees that the two Trucial Coast flags described above should in future be employed in lieu of the Muscat Ensign when saluting the Trucial Sheikhs. 4.

The Government of India are in general agreement with the Political Besident's views 'both with regard to the condonation of breaches of Treaty obligations re lating to the flying of these flags, and as to the use of the term 'State flag% which seems to them suitable for application to the condition of the Arab States in the Persian Gulf and is well understood in India.■I I (aO Copy of Express Letter No»?.33/14/132-II dated the Ist February 1936 from the Political Besident in the Persian Gulf. Joreign and Political Department Express Letter No. D.3202-N/35 dated the 26th July 1935. 2. The first nolnt raised hy the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty is whether there is any ohjection to changing the title of the flag at present called 'Trucial Coast Flag' at Plate 31 in rt Flags of All Nations' to 'Trucial Coast Flag No, 2 (Sharjah and Eas-al-Khaimah)*. 3. This is the flag known as 'white pierced red' 1 prescribed in the General Treaty of 1820 to he flown hy all the signatories.to the Treaty, viz., Bahrain, Ahu Dhahi, Dihai, Sharjah, Ajman, Uinm-al-Qaiwain, and Bas- al-Khaimah. In practice it is now, and has for many years 'been, flown only hy the Bulers of Shar.lah and Bas- al-Khaimah, and is now regarded exclusively as the triPal flag of the Jowasimi family. 4. I see no ohjection to this Admiralty proposal provided their second noint with which I am ahout to deal, and on which it is dependent, is accepted accord ing to my recommendation. 5. This proposal is that an ohlong flag, the length 'being approximately three times the Preadth, ahQ,ut five- sixths of the flag heing red and the remaining sixth (that nearest the mast) white, should he included in 'Flags of All Nations', under the title of 'Trucial Coast Flag No. 1 (Ahu Dhahi, Ajman, DelDai, Qatar and Umm-al-Qaiwain)*. The Admiralty say that this flag is flown hy all the Trucial Sheikhs other than Shar.lah and Bas-al-Khaimah. 6. This flag is in fact flown only hy the Bulers of Ahu Dhahi, Ajman, Dehai and Umm-al-Q.aiwain. It is not flown hy Qatar which has its own separate flag, vide, 'Flags of All Nations', Plate 118 A, and correspondence ending with my Express Letter No.l228/l4/132-I i flated ^ 2.7/2.//3/S'/-s- the 26th May 1934. 7. These four Eulers should strictly speaking fly the Treaty Flag, hut they have not done so for many years, and could hardly he induced to do so now, as the Treaty Slag has come to 'be regarded as the trihal flag of the Jowasimi family, as explained in paragraph 3 ahove. (See correspondence ending with my predecessor's letter No. 1143 dated the 4th June 1932). 8. I see no objection to the Admiralty proposal if mention of ^.atar is excluded, provided that the Government of India are prepared to tacitly condone a continuance of the breach of the letter of the Treaty 'by the Eulers of Ahu -^hahi, Ajman, Dehai and Umm-al-Qaiwain. A similar tacit condonation has already heen made in the case of Bahrain which, as one of the signatories of the General Treaty of 1820, should strictly speaking also fly the Treaty Flag, hut in fact flies its own flag, vide 'Flags of All Nations Plate 43 A, I accordingly recommencl that the breach he tacitly condoned, and the existing situation recog nised, in the case of the above-mentioned four Bulers al so. 9. The t hird uoint raised by the Admiralty is that the title of the Bahrain State Flag should be changed to the Bahrain National Flag, as the word 'State 1 * is said to imply a personal flag which is precisely the impression it is desired to avoid. 10. The word 'State' would not appear necessarily to imply a personal flag, e.g. State flags of Indian States. The word 'national' would, in ray opinion, be unsuitable, and I deprecate any change in this respect.» V -J -3- '13 11. The fourth -potnt. raised 'by the Admiralty is that the two Trucial Coast flags, which it is proposed to call Nos. 1 and 2, should he employed, in lieu of the Muscat Ensign, when saluting the Crucial Sheikhs, I concur in this suggestion. « • • » «V f' k [■I ui) Telegram Prom To No. G.T.C.

Qatar Flag Sir &gt; Reference your letter No;876/14/132-II dated the 19th April and telegram No.381 dated the 14th May 1936. 2. I have the honour to state that during my recent visit to Doha I asked the Shaikh of Qatar to describe the flag or flags flown by himself and his subjects. He said that there is only one flag flown and that it is used by himself and his subjects. It is a crimson flag with a serrated white strip near the mast. The word Qatar in Arabic characters is inscribed on the first half of the crimson portion in white. I obtained a sample and am forwarding it with this letter. 3. The sample is not crimson in colour. It. was originally, but has faded. White cloth is purchased in Bahrain and dyed crimson with locally purchased dye. The dye is of poor quality and fades rapidly and the flag takes on a chocolate colour. This explains the difficultyV, difficulty that has arisen regarding the exact ■ colour. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant. /V Captain, Officiating Political Agent, Bahrain(Original on file (C.O.)

I sent the Head Munshi Mirza Jassim Barduli ashore with instructions to send for Shaik$ Abdullah. The Shaikh's absence was not unexpected because it had not been possible to warn him of my visit. At half past two Shaikh Hamad attended by his sons Jasim and Ahmad came on board and apologised for his father's absence on the grounds that he had not been able to come on board ©wing to a bad knee but was nots? at the Qasr. After Shaikh had been given coffee etc. in the Captain's cabin he returned to the shore. Commander C.F. Bowlby, D.S.C., Head %inshi and Deptford's Doctor Surgeon Lieutenant Cooke and I went ashore.
