Bainfall and harvest. —It will be remembered that a timely fall of rain in March 1898 saved the crops last year. Less area than usual had, however, been sown, and there was not, therefore, grain for exportation, nor did prices fall appreciably during the summer, or indeed until the rainfall in the winter assured the coming harvest. The rains this year commenced in the middle of November, and, though there was immediately afterwards a prolonged break, they recommenced in December, and continued off and on till the beginning of March, when they ceased entirely. It clouded up several times in March, and a good 'Nao Roz' rain was confidently expected, but, unfortunately, none fell, and the crop has not, therefore, been quite so good as was at one time expected. The late-sown fields required more rain to bring them on, and even the early ones would have benefitted. On the whole, however, the harvest has been a good one, a great deal of land Prices in 1897-98. b as t) een cultivated, and prices, as wdll whpatKrs. 21 to28per Hasbimmaand of 124 lbs, be seen from the marginal statement, Barley Krs. is to 24 „ „ „ „ j iave f a |] en greatly.

There are, however, I believe, diffi culties in the way of its removal while prices are so high at Tehran. I trust that ere long the Persian Government may see its way to remove this prohibition, which is doing much injury to the trade of Southern Persia. The effects of the plentiful rainfall were seen on the Bushire plain, and changed,its ordinary parched and dried up surface into a green sea of young corn, interspersed with masses of w r ild flowers, for which, according to the old sailing directions, Bushire has always been famous. Early in the year fields of narcissus scented the air, and these, later on in Pebruary and March, gave place to a profusion of other flowers, poppies, larkspur, wild stocks, lilies, etc., which, mingled with the green of the wheat and barley, were very pleasant to the eye. The want of rain in March shortened the spring, and by April the plain had resumed its normal aspect. Changes in the Governorship of 'Bushire. —There have been five Governors of Bushire during the year under report, viz.t (1) the Imadi-Nizam, (2) Saeedus- bultan, (3) Muzzafer-i-Nizam, (4)) Muez-ul -Mumalek, and (5) the Daris, Begi, orlord of the seas,' the high-sounding title of the Persian Admiral.ADMINISTRATION REPOET ON THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL The first four named were deputies appointed by the Eirman Firma, who was then Governor-General of Ears; but later on, when the Gulf Ports were taken from the Pirman Firma and given to the Mujir-es-Sultaneh, the Muez -ul-Mumalek stayed on as the deputy of the last-named official, who is the nephew of the powerful brothers, the Saad-ul-Mulk and Nizam-es- Sultaneh. The Daria Begi obtained the Governorship in September and has held it ever since. Public peace and tranquility —It is pleasant, after the record of ] 897-98, to be able to report a comparatively quiet year at Bushire and in its neighbour hood. There have been few cases of violent crime, and the English com munity have not suffered at all. This improved state of things is, no doubt, chiefly due to the good rainfall, which provided plenty of agricultural work for everyone, and to the consequent fall in prices. Other causes, I think, are the stoppage of the arms traffic and the punitive measures taken during the spring and early summer against the Tungastanis. As mentioned in last year's report, a small force of Cavalry and Infantry, with a field gun, was sent by the Firman Firma in April 1898 from Shiraz to Borazjoon, where I saw them. They were under the command of the Saeed-us-Sultan, and were about 800 strong. It is not necessary to enter into a detailed account of his proceedings. The expedition is believed to have been a success, but it is doubtful if it had much lasting effect on the Tungastanis, or if any punish ment reached those really to blame for the troubles which occurred in the early part of 1898. The Saeed-us-Sultan came to Bushire on the 20th May, and took up the post of Governor. He was recalled, however, immediatelv afterwards by the Governor-General, and returned to Shiraz with the greater part of his troops. It will be remembered that the Tungastani leader. All Khan, was believed to be the instigator of the attacks on the Bushire Kesi- dency, and on Mahmoud, the Jemadar of the Telegraph Department, whose relatives were killed and whose house was looted in March 1898. Im mediately after these crimes, Ali Khan fled from the Imamzada * where he had been in ' bust', and returned to Tungastan. His enemy Hyder Khan Joined Saeed 'Us *Sultan, and was confirmed in his position of Tungastani Governor. Ali Khan hearing of this fled to a port higher up the coast, with the intention of going by sea to Basrah. No attempts bein? made, however, to seize him, he returned to Tungastan, from where he com menced writing, to Mahmoud, and to the Hesidency, declaring his innocence and threatening that, if the efforts which were being made against him were not relaxed, he would come in and take 41 bust ' with Mahmoud It should here be explained that this custom of taking 'bust' is carried in Persia to such a length that an accused person can enter the house of his accuser, who is bound to receive him, and unable to take anv steps a-ainst him, wMe he is in 'bust'. Ali Khan did not eventually go 'to Mahmoud's house but applied to the Besidency Authorities, statin? that he would come in and surrender himself, provided he received a fair trial, and that a promise was given him that he would not be handed over to the Persians I was at that time away from Bushire at Shiraz. and Mr. Prideaux, Assistant Resident! agreed to Ah Khan s proposal. He came in accordingly, and an investigation which was held pointed strongly to his connection with the crimes wh eh occurred while he and his followers were staying at the Imamynd, ' r therefore;of 4 000 Tomans were put forward hy'the iLwency a ™ensaS to those who had suffered. Ah Khan would probably have paid the amount but h« w. s hed to be assured that he would not be molested afterwards,bv the Persian Government. This assurance we were unable to obtain, and I told Ali Kb,? on my return from Shiraz, that as he had come in on enf V British Officer, he was f^ to leave tL Kesidencv ^here be had b^-H 0 * six months, whenever he pleased, but that as he had not paid tl-e romi f demanded, we would now endeavour to recover it through the I'w r' 100 ment, to whom he is subject.

M.bmoud ci.taM |„ ^ g' W S.RESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1898-99. I now think, a political object, and Mahmoud, was attacked not because he was a British protege, but for personal reasons. Quarantine and public health. —Quarantine has continued to be adminis tered at the request of the Persian Government by the Government of India, who have given the services of Assistant Surgeons to supervise the arrange ments at Mohammerah, Lingah and Bunder Abbas. At Bushire itself quaran tine is managed by the Residency Surgeon, an Assistant Surgeon and a Hos pital Assistant working under him. No case of plague has appeared in the Gulf during the year under report, but two imported cases have been discovered at Maskat since the 1st April. The victims were promptly segregated, and subsequently recovered. There have been no further cases. Quarantine is enforced against all ships from Karachi, the nearest infected port, and where the ship is herself infected she has to do quarantine from date of arrival. The only instance in which plague has occurred on hoard a ship coming up the Gulf is that of the fC Patna' who lost a stoker at Karachi. Her passengers had, in consequence, to do quarantine on arrival here. The general health of the country bordering on the Gulf has been good, no epidemic having occurred during the year under report. Currency. —The currency of Southern Persia has fallen into a very unsatis • factory condition. The silver Kran, which is equivalent to about 4 annas 6 pies, and which is almost universally used in commercial transactions, has been much depreciated. There are, too, several distinct mintings, the Krana of which ha^e different values. In Bushire alone some 18 different kinds of Krans containing different quantities of silver and having different market values are in circulation. New Krans, which are almost the only kind which the Imperial Bank of Persia and the Customs House will accept, have been sent in large quantities up-country, with the result that it is difficult to obtain them in the Bushire market, and merchants have been put to much incon venience in consequence. The matter is now being considered by Her Majesty 's Minister at Tehran. The inconvenience experienced from the defective state of the currency has been enhanced by the action of a native company called the ' Bushire Trading Company'', who flooded Bushire with ' Bijecks ' or notes made 44 payable to bearer This syndicate appear to have collected a quan tity of good Krans, and sent them up-country, paving their bills in their own notes, which their constituents, generally petty dealers, could not refuse to accept. Similarly, British firms who had dealings with Persians, have been obliged to accept 'Bijecks ' or bad Krans in payment of their claims, and have subsequently experienced much difficulty in getting rid of them. As the issue of these ' Bijecks ' appears to be a breach of the Bank's monopoly, they protested, with the result that the Persian Government have recently issued orders, directing the (&lt; Bushire Trading Company ' to call in all their Bijecks ' and declaring them illegal tender after the 1st of June. This course should have a beneficial effect, especially if the Shah's Government can call in all the old Krans, now in circulation, and re-mint them. In August last, the Persian Government issued a proclamation forbidding the importation of copper coins into Tehran and their transport from place to place. Tours during the year. —I visited Maskat in April 1898, returning to Bushire at the end of the month. Soon after my return I started on a pro- longed visit to Shiraz and other places in Pars, returning to the coast in October. An account of this trip, which enabled me to avoid the summer heat in the Persian Gulf, will form the subject of a separate report. In January I visited Kharj Island, Koweit and Mohammerah, and in the follow ing month went to Maskat, where I remained till the end of Pebruary, when I visited Bahrein, returning finally to Bushire on the 6th March. I sent Mr. P. B Prideaux in December to enquire into some pending cases at Lingah, Bunder Abbas and on the Makran Coast, which has also been twice visited by- Mr. Sealy, Director, Persian Gulf Telegraph Department, and Political Officer for the Coast. Settlement of claims for compensation. —A good deal has been done during the past year in disposing of claims by British subjects for compensation on8 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL account of thefts, robberies, etc. Since I toolc over charge in June 1897, there have been 30 claims for compensation aggregating Krans 3,04,564. Nearly all these have been disposed of and the claims either compromised or paid in full. While I was at Shiraz, I managed, with the assistance of Captain Sykes, Consul at Kerman, to dispose of 17 cases in direct communication with the Firman Firma. The amount claimed was Krans 32,275, and a compromise was arrived at for Krans 19,626, which was distributed amongst the various claimants. In August last a serious robbery took place from a lighter bringing piece- goods from the S, S ' Parran' \o the Customs House. The lighter was supposed to have capsized during the night, but in reality her cargo was removed and handed over to certain Persian merchants, who actually des patched a portion to Shiraz, where I was at the time. Fortunately the crime was discovered and traced home, with the result that the guilty persons were punished and obliged to make good the value of the stolen property, which came to about Krans 1,50,000. The lesson has been a very beneficial one, as it has probably put an end to a system of fraudulent jettisons, which are generally believed to have bsen going on, and which were causing the Insur ance Companies much loss and annoyance. The assistance given by the Governor in the disposal of this case deserves special notice. Claims on behalf of the Telegraph Department for Government and other property taken at the time of Mr. Graves' death have been made good by the Persian Government, who hare recently remitted Krans 16,841, which have been handed over to the Department. Mr. Sealy's recent visit to Charbar on the Makran Coast has resulted in the partial settlement of a number of claims for compensation put forward by British Indian subjects there. Mr. Sealy met the Mamoor, who represents the Persian Government, and Mowladad Khan, the new Baluchi Governor of Persian Baluchistan, and came to an understanding with them, which will probably result in a complete settlement of these questions during the coming year. Generally, out of claims aggregating Krans 3,16,947 at Bushire, Krans 2,02,190, equivalent to about Rs. 56,i64, have been recovered from the Persian authorities, leaving a sum of Krans 1,02,108 still recoverable. This, however, includes Krans 40,000 on account of the outrages committed at the house of Mahmoud, the Telegraph Jemadar, and at the Bushire Residency in March 1898. This was delayed as it was hoped that the money could be recovered direct from Ali Khan, but, as this has been found impossible, we have been oblio-ed to go to the Persian Government, who will now be obliged to take active measures against the culprits. Mail robberies, —The Persian Post Kossid, who left Bushire for Shiraz on the 8th of October 1898, was attacked and killed near Khan-zanyan, The robbers, who belonged to the Rai-Rahmat tribe, carried off all the parcels and cash. The Governor-General of Fars sent about 40 sowars under an officer to punish the robbers, but beyond recovering some of the parcels nothino- was done. 2.—OMAN—MASK AT. Major C. G, F. Fagan, I S.C., was Political Agent throughout the year and his report accompanies as Part II of this compilation. 3.—OMAN—PIRATE COAST. Affairs appear to have proceeded quietly on this coast during the past year, and there have been no casualties among the trucial Chiefs I fullv intended visiting the coast during the winter, but wo.-k elsewhere prevented my doing so. It should, however, be visited next year as no Re idem has been there since 1896.RESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1898-99. 9 It is reported that the uncle of the Sheikli of Shargah has given a long lease of some oxide mines to Eaji Ali Dubash, also known as Nakhoda Ali, who is a resident of Bush ire, where he got into trouble and had to leave. He is said to have already exported 400 tons of oxide, and a further enquiry into the concession will be made when an opportunity offers. 4.—BAHREIN. Sheikh Isa has continued to be ruler and has enjoyed good health. I visitied the place towards the close of the past financial year and took the oppor tunity to visit some remarkable mounds at a place called Ali about seven miles' from Menamah, the chief town on the large island. There are ap parently some hundreds of these mounds, of which a few have been partially explored. They are supposed to be pre-historic and to date back to early Phoenician times. I have not been able, however, to obtain much inform ation regarding them, and an organised scientific examination might give in teresting results. 5.—NEJD. Abdul Aziz, a nephew of Mahomed bin Rasheed, the Amir of Jabal Shammar, succeeded his uncle at the end of 1897- It was stated that the sons of the late Sheikh of Koweit had enlisted the Shammar Sheikh on their side, and that be intended making a descent on Koweit with the object of ousting Sheikh Mobarek. In January last, Abdul Aziz was reported to be within three marches of Koweit itself, and his movements were watched with some anxiety by the people of the place. He appears, however, to have become involved in hostilities with some of the Bedouin tribes of that part of Arabia, and to have come to some understanding with Sheikh Mobarek, the latest accounts being that he is returning towards Nejd. 6.—KOWEIT. Sheikh Mobarek has continued to be the ruler during the year under report. When I went to Koweit in January last, I had an interview with him at his house, and found him to be a venerable looking Arab Sheikh, of, I should say, between 55 and 60 years of age. It would, I think, be an advan tage if the British India steamers could visit Koweit, as the trade of the place has now to be carried to Mohammerah and there re-shipped. The town is fairly clean, and as it is the chief outlet for the trade of that portion of Arabia, it may become a flourishing place in the future. 7.—PERSIAN ARABISTAN. Trom Koweit I proceeded up the Shat-el-Arab to Mohammerah, and had two interviews with Sheikh Khazal, brother of the late Sheikh Mizal, whose death was referred to in last year's report. The present Sheikh received the title of Muez-es- Sultaneh from the Persian Government in April 1898, and he appears to have governed his district, on the whole, in an able manner, and has earned the good opinion of British firms trading to Mohammerah, who say that their interests are better looked after now than they were in the days of bis brother, Sheikh Mizal. The Sheikh has been engaged, during the year, in various expeditions against Arab tribes within his jurisdiction, the most important of which was that against the Bawi tribe of Nasri, whose insurrec tion at one time gave rise to some uneasiness. Sirdar Akrem continued to be Governor-General of Persian Arabistan throughout the yeai, but has since been relieved by Ain -ed-Dowleh. A riot occurred at Dizful early in the year, when several persons were killed. The residents of one of the quarters of the town attacked the Deputy Governor of Dizful, who, however, was able to defeat them but had to leave Dizful soon after to avoid further fighting. B10 The members.of the French Mission at Suza have continued their explo rations, but appear to have suffered from the hostility of the Arabs of that vicinity. They went last summer to Ispahan, and intend spending the coming hot weather in the mountains north of Suza. Messrs. Lynch Brothers were engaged throughout the year in the con struction of the road which is to connect Ahwaz with Ispahan. It will be a mule track and will shorten the land journey very considerably, Messrs. Lynch have various claims against the Persian authorities, but, on the whole, their affairs are progressing favourably. 8.—FARS AND PERSIAN COAST. His 'Royal Highness the Eirman Eirma, a near relation of the present Shah, was Governor-General of Ears when I visited Shiraz. In January last, lie was relieved by the Nizam-ul-Mulk, and came down to 13ushire in February on his way to Kerbella, where he is gone on a pilgrimage. The harvest in Pars was better this year than it has been for some time back, as the locusts did not appear as early as usual. It is hoped that the period of agricultural depression, which has now lasted for several years, is about to end, and that a period of prosperity will succeed. Oulf JPoris, —There is not much to mention about the Gulf Ports with the exception of Lingah, the history of which has been interesting during 1898-99. Lingah was originally founded by the Jowasimi Arabs, whose Sheikhs ruled it, yielding more or less submission to the authority of Persia. Eventually the' Persians succeeded in obtaining the complete control of the place, and in 1887 the Sheikh of that time was captured and sent to Tehran, since which Lin^ah has been under Deputy Governors appointed by the Governor of Bushire. Last year, however, Sheikh Mahomed, a descendant of the former Arab Sheikhs, attacked Lingah, and easily got possession of it. 'No damage, to speak of] occurred to our subjects in consequence of this revolution, and it seemed likely at one time that the Sheikh would establish himself finally in plnce of his ancestors, ^ and that the Persian Government would accept the situation and acquiesce in the restored Arab rule. Such was not, however, the case, as the Persians appear, throughout, to have been resolved to re-assert their authoritv Accordingly, in February last, the 'Fersipolis ' went to Lingah conveying the Dana Begi and a small force. An attack was suddenly made and Lin -ah retaken by the Persians. The Sheikh made his escape. 0 The British India Steam Navigation Company, before the attack on Lin- gab, had made some arrangements with a contractor for the landino- of cargoes at special rates. This clashed with the contract held by the old Hamal B-fshi and m the confusion which resulted from the capture of the place the comoanv seems to have been put to some inconvenience. I believe, however, that matters are now on a better footing. 1 steers ^n important case regardmg the Island of Hormaz has recently been settled.

It was decided to make a frcsu Slbntbn ^of lieEESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAE 1898-99. H subsidies by giving- more to the headmen over whose lands the telegraph line actuallv passes, and less to the Chiefs. It was found that in the case of Geh, for instance, the Chief, who received Rs. 3,000 a year, did little or nothing to protect the line, which runs through the property of various smaller men. it is hoped that the new arrangements will result in the lesser Chiefs considering themselves personally responsible for the safety of the line, which passes over their land, as well as for that of the telesrraph employes and other Europeans who may have to go there. A Baluchi Chief, named Mowladad Khan, who has been appointed by the Persian Government as the Baluchi Governor of the district in place of Husein Khan, the Chief of Geh, as I have already men tioned, met Mr. Sealy at Charbar, when arrangements were made for the payment of claims of British Indian traders. Mir Abdi Khan, of Dashtiari, who gave so mucli trouble last year, and who repeatedly threatened to attack Charbar, was seized by the Persians and removed to the interior of Persia. The present District Officer, Mowladad Khan, is a near relation of Abdi Khan, and he has made the release of the latter a condition for the payment of our claims, he, on his part, guaranteeing Abdi Khan's good behaviour in future. The matter is now being considered by the Legation. 10.—SLAVE TRADE. Little has been done in the way of seizing slave dhows during the past year, only one vessel was taken by the Sphinx' in June 1893, and she had to be subsequently released on enquiry. There has been a good deal of correspondence regarding the manumission of slaves, and 14 persons applied to this Residency for manumission during the past year. Borne of the applications are still under consideration. We are also arranging for the return of freed slaves to Africa. 11.—PIRACY. No piracies took place on British Indian vessels during the year under report. This was chiefly due to the special measures adopted by the Govern ment of India in stationing a gunboat in the Shat-el-Arab during the date-sea son, when the Indian craft come up to buy dates. Owing to these measures, the Turkish and Persian authorities appear to have also stirred themselves, and special patrolling parties were organised for the safety of the river, with good results. 12.—ROYAL NAVY. During the early part of the year H. M. S, Sphinx ' and &lt;c 'Redbreast ' were in the Gulf. Both these ships left the Gulf in May, the former for Karachi and the latter for Trincomalee, H. M„ S.' taking their place. The Sphinx ' returned to the Gulf in June, and remained until Octo ber, when, on beirg relieved by H. M. S. ' pigeon' she left for Bombay for usual repairs. Prom Bombay she again came up in December, and was on the station up to the close of the year. The e{ Redbreast' returned to the Gulf in October, and was placed on special duty in the Shat-el-Arab during the date-season. Hear-Admiral Douglas, Kaval Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Station, came up the Gulf, in Pebruary last, in his flagship the ' Eclipse' Por many years past no large men-of-war have entered the Gulf. 13.—OFFICIAL CHANGES. Major (temporary Lieutenant-Colonel) M. J. Meade was confirmed in the post of Eesident in the Persian Gulf on the 10th March 1898, and there haveADMINISTEATION EEPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL been no permanent changes in the personnel of the Residency during the past year. Captain P. Lumsden, Eesidency Surgeon, took furlough to England in May 1898, and Captain E. Wickham Hore, I.M.S., has acted for him, remaining at Bushire during the remainder ot the year. In November 1898, Mr. J. P. Sequeira, the Uncovenanted Assistant to the Resident, went to India on two years' leave, and Mr. P. Candhy, the Head Clerk and Dragoman at Busrah, took his place. Lieutenant F, B. Prideaux, First Assistant Resident, took short leave to India, and the Residency Surgeon, with the approval of the Government of India, carried on his duties during his absence. 14.— OBSERVATORY.

POLITICAL. The year under report has been one of exceptional tranquillity in the interior and is remarkable for the comparative absence of internecine wars among the tribes. Seldom has Oman enjoyed so long a period of tranquillity. This quiet is partly attributable to the removal by death of several of the most troublesome of the tribal leaders, notably of Saiyid Ibrahim bin Keisj of Rostak. The following incidents, regarding all of which special reports have been submitted, occurred during the year under report:—- Rising of the Jeneheh at Sur. —In March 1898, Suleiman bin Suweylim, Governor of Sur, arrived at that place from Dhofar, and after summoning the Sheikhs of the Jenebeh he informed them that he did not intend in future to respect khafir (a system of safe conduct in vogue amongst the tribes). He then dismissed the Sheikhs and proceeded the same day to Maskat, leaving his son, a youth of 12, in charge of the Governorship. The Jenebeh were much incensed at the Suleiman's averred intention to disregard the ancient custom of khafir, but it is improbable that they would have faken any active steps to show their disapproval had reasonable tact been shown in' dealing with them. 1 0 . But subsequent high-handed acts on the part of the Suleiman's son, coupled with an attempt on his part (under instructions from his father) to build a fort on a spot commanding at one time the water-supply of the town and the caravan route leading to the interior, so incensed the Jenebeh that the various sections ot the tribe combined to protect their own interests. Their efforts in this direction were, however, marked throughout with commendable moderation, ahey commenced by sending a petitfon to the Sultan praying His Highness to stop the building of the fort and to remove Suleiman s son from the post of acting Wall. The Sultan ultimately acceded to their wishes and tent a new Wall and a fresh garrison to Sur which w P n&gt; duly accepted by the Jenebeh, and the affair was thus peaceably settled „ I''P™onmer : t oj Dhofar Chiefs.—On the 12th Mav a report was that Sheikh Salim bin Hamad al Mahrooni had been arrested it DVmfi and had been brought to Maskat and placed in irons in .Port Jellalv (Maskat ( It was further reported that the arrest of this Sheikh had been' instigated by Suleiman bin Suweylim out of revenge for the death of his son, who was killed by the Dhofar tribes in the late rebellion, which it will be rememberw) oflndia 7 aCtlVe aSSiStan0e aff0rded t0 tlle Sultan b ' v Goverament In June a further report was received of the arrest at TIW,,. ci -i , Oomer bin Abdulla al Mahrooni, cousin ot Sheikh Salim hi, 7 u i S1 1 leikh the instigation of Suleiman bin Suweylim and for the'same reasons hf 0 tins occasion the prisoner was taken to Sohar (Suleiman's head nnaH- and incarcerated m the fort there.

A communication was made to the Sultan GENERAL. On the 13th April a fire broke out in one of the shops in the bazar. Information was brought to the Political Agent. Prompt arrangements were at once made for the despatch to the spot of the detachment of the 21st Bombay Infantry on duty at the Agency and a party of blue jackets from H. M. S. ' Lapwing,'* by whose exertions the fire, which at one time threatened to be come serious, was soon got under. On the 23rd May another fire was reported to have taken place at Bun der Jisseh, which resulted in the destruction of the whole village with the exception of seven huts. wi t On the 3rd June a disastrous cyclone passed over Maskat and the adjacent country accompanied by heavy rain. Great loss occurred amongst the small craft at Matrah and other towns on the coast. Thousands of date and other trees were uprooted by the violence of the storm, and some damage was done to property in Maskat and Matrah. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf visited Maskat early in April m the R. I. M. S. ' Lawrence ' and again in Pebruary in the same vessel. The imposition of quarantine on account of plague in India; remained in force throughout the year, and the country is still free of this scourge. NAVY.

In June a pearl-fishing dhow, bound from Khaburah to Bahrein, was seized by Commander Baker of H. M. S. 'Sphinx ' and brought in for adjudica tion in the Consular Court at Maskat, having Vice-Admiralty jurisdiction. The Court on enquiry found that there was no evidence to prove that the Nakhoda was aware at the time of his departure from Khaburah of the slave's presence on board, and he and his vessel were released. The slave was duly liberated and his owner handed over to His Highness the Sultan for punishment. In December an African slave-boy, Ferooz bin Mabrooh, who had been liberated at this Consulate, was reported to have been re-enslaved by a Persian subject named Abdul Rasul bin Ibrahim, of Bunder Abbas. Further enquiry confirmed the truth of the report, and steps were taken which resulted in the boy being again set at liberty. At the same time the matter was reported to the Political Resident with a view to punishment being meted out to Abdul Basul by the Persian authorities. _ ^ . • .n n During the year under report 105 fugitive slaves took refuge m the Con sulate. Of these, 89 were manumitted under the stipulations of the Treaty ot 1873, and 16 left the protection of the Consulate and found their way to Africa or India before their cases were enquired into by His Highness the Sultan.

The volume of trade in 1898, unfortunately, has not shown the improve ment predicted in last year's report, consequent upon the grain crop not turning out as good as was anticipated. The reports for the year show a decline of Rs. 31,85,724. The principal items showing a decrease are cotton goods, arms, loaf sugar, candles, drugs, chinaware, matches and timber. The following imports show increases: tea, provisions, soft sugar, copper, yarns, indigo, woollen goods, coffee, kerosine oil, glassware, gold lace and hardware. The exports on the other hand have improved hy Rs. 1,81,941 under the heads and order of shells, carpets, tobacco, almonds, gum, wheat and horses. Among the exports a decrease is shown in the case of arms, opium, wool, dates, hides, cotton, perfumery and silk. The German firm trading under the style of ' Deutsch Persische Handels Gesellschaft,' mentioned in the previous year's report, confined their transac tions chiefly to imports of German sugar, and failing to obtain paying indents liquidated, having almost absorbed the subscribed capital. It would appear from this that old-established firms need not at present fear competition from foreign enterprises to any great extent, but it must not be accepted that further attempts will not be made in the near future. It is believed that a large German Association, who have established trading centres in East Africa and Zanzibar, will venture to extend their operations to the Persian Gulf at an early date. It is not, however, German competition which British manufacturers need most fear. Though uj figures are given in the returns as regards cotton goods imported from Holland, yet such goods are said to be seen in the markets marked ' made in Holland.' 8ome houses are evidently importing into Persia through Bushire and via Baghdad and Kermanshah grey and white shirtings, dyed cottons and prints of poor and cheap quality, for which class of goods, there has been much demand owing to the impoverished condition of the principal buyers who cannot afford to indulge in better material. These Dutch goods are transhipped either at Manchester or London into British bottoms: they therefore are treated as imports from the United Kingdom. British manufacturers might find it to their interest to study the reason why their Dutch competitors are able to send these goods to Persia and find a sale for them, notwithstanding that they have to pay extra freight and other charges to the British port of transhipment. It is noticeable in the returns that kerosine oil is growing into general use, and it is gradually finding its way into the markets of the interior. It is obvious that with the increased use of this illuminant, a large demand for lampware, especially of cheap quality, will be created. All lamps in use here are either of Austrian or German make. There appears no reason why British manufacturers cannot imitate the Austrians and Germans and participate in this trade, which, though yet young, promises to become prominent. In addition to the steamers of the old-established shipping companies mentioned in last year's report, the British and Colonial Steam INavigation Company, Limited, sent a few of their chartered vessels to Persian Gulf ports. Freight averaged 24 shillings per ton for general cargo and 40 shillings for shells. The prices of food-stuffs continued high for the first five months of the year, and reached figures overtopping those for 1897. When the harvest was gathered and the new grain offered for sale, they fell nearly 50 per cent, in June, but in July they advanced again and remained at a rate 60 per cent.B2 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL above the normal prices of ordinary years, ihe chief cause of these abnormal figures was that the grain producers were afraid to part with their surplus grain in case another bad year might follow. An embargo on the export of wheat to foreign countries was in force throughout the year and seems likely to be continued in spite of our efforts for its removal. The restriction is undoubtedly bad for trgde, and, during the year under report, was unnecessary as prices were too high to allow of any transactions. The prospects for 1899 are bright. The sowing season opened under favorable conditions. The rainfall, though not plentiful, was well distributed, and a much larger area has been brought under cultivation. If good rain falls early in the coming year, a general revival of trade may be looked for. The confidence of the public was shaken during the year by the discredi table state of affairs at the Bushire Customs House. Numerous thefts and robberies culminated in the removal by night of the cargo of a lighter bringing piece-goods from the 8. S. ' ^'arran! , It was stated that she had capsized during the night, and that her cargo hnd been washed away, but it was subsequently proved that the goods had really been carried off by certain Persian merchants acting in combination with the Uamal Bashies or Custom officials. The crime was traced home and the insured value of the goods was recovered from the culprits to the extent of Tomans 15,000, equivalent to about Us. d3 } 0J0, which was distributed rateably among the owners of the goods. There has been some difficulty during the past year over the debased state of the currency at Bushire. There are several distinct mintings in use, some of which are not so valuable as others, and this has given rise to much confusion and some loss to merchants. The matter is under consideration, and it is to be hoped that the Persian Government will shortly take steps to call in all but the best Krans, and have them reminted. Considerable difficulty has also arisen in consequence of the issue by a Persian syndicate of notes generally known as ' BijecW It is doubtful if the syndicate can redeem all the paper money it has issued, and its circulation is much objected to by European firms, who are, however, obliged to use ' Bijecks ' in the course of their business. The Imperial Bank of Persia have protested against the action of the syndicate as being a breach of the monopoly they hold from the Persian Government. IMPORTS. Jrms and Ammunition. —The enforcement of the prohibition against the importation of arms and ammunition into Persia has put a stop to this trade, and the figures shown in the tables represent the value of weapons imported for private use under special licenses. Candles accumulation of unsold stock from the previous vear and a more extensive employment of kerosine oil, together with the poorness of the prices realized, deterred dealers from importing to any extent. Coffee. The trade in this article is reported to have been unremunerative the quantity imported being in excess of the demand. A small speculation made in Java coflee to test the market for that variety is not believed to have been attended with success. _ Cotton During the first quarter of the vear the povertv of the cultivators, «ho are the principal customers, caused transactions to he limited. AS the year advanced the trade became brisker and large clearances of old Slocks were effected. In the last quarter a favorable rate of exchansre and the anticipation of a good harvest effected the placing of numerous orders in the bands of merchants. 0 numerous Yarn and Ticist.—'Yhe failure of the crops for three successive vears on be Persian Coast ed many of the cultivators to resort more largely to weaving lor a livelihood, a demand being thereby created for these enrn iuto ^ aiid «-RESIDENCY AND MA SKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1898-99. 33 Drugs and Medicines. —The demand has been less, more probably on account of the inability of the poorer classes to purchase than because of any particular improvement in the general health. Glass and Glassware.— imports into Bush ire show an increase of 108 per cent, and at Bunder Abbas of 40 per cent, over th'ose for the previous year. The revival of this trade is chiefly due to a greater demand in the interior of Persia for cheap lamps, table glasses and looking glasses. Gold lace and thread—In the aggregate, the imports show an advance of about Rs. 16,170, the demand for gold embroidered cloths and muslins from India, Turkey and France having increased. The last mentioned country supplied all the gold thread. Hardware and Cutlery improvement over the preceding year's returns for this trade cannot yet be considered satisfactory, as the figures are still lower than those of 1896. India is shown as being the principal exporter in this line, but most of the articles exported by that country were of German manufacture and cheap quality. —Calcutta samples continue to be neglected and transactions have been limited to the cheaper sorts. ' Oudh ' indigo is said to be preferred in most of the Persian markets. The revival of the weaving industry and dyeing operations in the interior caused a greater quantity ot the dye to be used this year, thereby improving the imports by about Rs. 1,20,428. It is however reported that large stocks remained unsold at the close of the year. Matches—WiQ import of this article has declined to the extent of Rs. 16,720, consequent upon the tightness of money amongst the poorer classes. Austria takes the lead in the export to this country, and Japan matches are finding their way through India into the Persian markets. The latter description do not seem, however, to meet with much favor at present. jUletals. —The trade under this head, as compared with that of 1897, shows the very considerable increase of Bs. 2,63,049, due almost entirely to the large imports of copper and brass. All other metals with the exception of tin show a slight decrease. Oil, Kerosine. —This article is gradually coming into more general use making its way into the markets of the interior and taking the place of candles. Porcelain and CUnaware.—^z growing demand among the upper classes in the northern districts for a better quality of porcelain of European manu facture induced dealers to import greater quantities than last year. The imports of such description, consequently, rose 40 per cent. There was, however, a sharp decline in the trade in cheap wares from China, so that the total value of the imports was lower than the previous year by Rs. 29,040. Seventy five per cent, of the porcelain imported was supplied by the United Kingdom. Provisions and Stores.—The figures for 1898 show that the value of pro visions imported was more than treble the amount for 1897. The principal articles were wheat, flour and barley from Karachi, and rice from Calcutta and Burma. The increase amounted to Rs. 7,10,110. These abnormal figures were caused by the failure of the local crops for three consecutive years. Suqar to'/.—There was a considerable falling off in this commodity, amounting' to 40 per cent, on the figures for the previous year. As in the case of some other imports, the decrease was mainly due to a greatei number of the Doorer classes being constrained bv necessity to favor the cheaper article, viz * soft suo-ar. The lead in the import appears still to be kept by 'France, though Germanv and Austria are keenly competing in the trade, and Egvpt has made an attempt to obtain a footing in the market. Transactions are said to have been generally satisfactory to traders, the exception perhaps being m the case of German importers, who have tried to compete unsuccessfully with the French by asking 15 per cent. less. Suaar soft. —The decline in loaf sugar has benefitted the trade in thk article causing it to advance 50 per cent, on the trade of 1897, and 5 per cent on that of 1896. The principal exporting countries are Germany, 1 ranee and Austria. K84 ADMINISTRATION EEPOET ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL ^—The importation of tea, though showing an improvement of nearly 50 per cent, on that of the previous year, has not quite regained the position it occupied in 1896. The revival is due partly to Indian tea continuing to siow in favor with the internal and northern markets, and, if weil pushed, it is likely to supersede altogether the more exppnsive sorts of China and Java teas/ After India, these two countries in the order given supplied the greatest quantities of the commodity. limber and Wood. —Bad times affected building operations. Consequently the reduced demand for the materials caused the imports to be 10 per cent, less tran those of last year. Woollen Goods. —There was an advance of 70 per cent, in the imports of woollen fabrics. The increase was principally in broad cloths, which are finding much favour with the wealthy classes in the northern and central districts of Persia, and they appear to be able to compete successfully with similar materials of Russian manufacture imported from the north. The principal supplying countries were Great Britain, Germany, France, and Austria, British manufacturers should watch the Persian markets, as the trade in these fabrics is likely to expand. Shawls from India also showed a substantial improvement. EXPORTS. Eorses —The export trade in these animals showed a little improvement on the preceding year, viz, 76 horses against 10. The famine of 1896 in India, followed by the outbreak of plague , diminished the demand so considerably that year, that exporters from Persia experienced heavy losses, from the effects of which they have not recovered. The export to India consequently has not regained its former condition. Arms and Ammunition.—The reason for the disappearance of this trade is the same as given under the same heading in the ' In]ports. ,, The weapons exported from Bushire, valued at Es. 500, were swords, daggers, and spear heads of native make intended for Turkish Arabia. Cotton —A further decline in this export has occurred in 1898. The causes appear to be a greater local consumption, a partial failure of the crop, and an increasing export to Russia, where better prices for this commod ity are obtainable than in India. Dates. Short crops and high prices ruling locally curtailed the demard for dates on the Arab coast, but the exports to India from Bushire were nearly doubled. On the whole there was a decline of 13 per cent, in the exports. Almonds.—'llie shipments to India of this nut and its kernal showed a great improvement. Exports to other countries conf-iderably decreased and on the whole there was an advance of 37 per cent, over 1897.' Wheat. The grain exported, as was also the case in the previous veir nearly all went to other Persian ports where prices were still higher ' t Hp large imports made by Lingah from foreign countries enabled her fo sunnlv the greatest quantity. iSU PPv Gum.-High prices offeriBg in India and London encouraged larger exports, which show an increase of 37 per cent. India, on this occasion, was t' I biggest consumer taking 59 per cent, of the total quantity shipped and tin United Kingdom coming next with 36 per cent.

Shells.— large profits realized in oyster shells in 1896 and 1897 and the demand in London led many merchants, who had hitherto held aloof, to speculate in this article. There was comequently a further increase of Es. 4,69,458 in the expirts. The eagerness of the shippers, unfortunately, prompted them to consign everything they could purchase irrespective of qualitv, thereby causing the London market to be overstocked and disaster to all who' indulged in the trade. Losses of 75 per cent, and more are said to have been suffered. SUk. A further fall of Rs. 13,650, as compared with the figures for 1897 occurred in the export of this ware. This is due probably to an increased local demand and a poor market in India. Tobacco. —An increased demand in Egypt, Turkey and Greece improved the exports by Rs. 1,32,852. The figures are, however, still below those for 1896. jfool.-^ks anticipated in last year's report, there has been a decline in the export of wool to the extent of Rs. 1,63,295. The primary causes were a dull London irarket and the operations in America being limited. The year's clip has been unsatisfactory in quality on account of a considerable portion^ of the wool having had to be shorn from the carcasses of sheep, amongst which the mortality has been abnormal owing to the poorness of the pasturage. A consi derable stock of wool was awaiting sale at the close of the year. Carpets. —An extensive demand in the Egyptian markets and in a _ lesser degree in Turkey has resulted in an increased exportation amounting to Rs! 1,85,350. MISCELLANEOUS. Exchange — The year opened with a rate of Krans 54J for the pound sterling and fluctuated near that figure till the end of August, when it rose gradually to Krans £0^ a month later, and then took a downward tendency to Krans 52J at which figure it stood at the end of the year. The average exchange with India for the year was Krans 853 for Rs. 100, and the highest and lowest figures touched during that period were Krans 365 and 3b0 respectively. Specie —No statistics of imports or exports of specie are kept by the Customs authorities of the Persian Gulf Ports and Shiraz. The figures given in the tables are gathered from the records of the steamship companies and the Imperial liank of Persia. There is a considerable amount of specie, other than that noted, carried by native sailing craft for purposes of trade with Turkish Arabia, Arab Coast, Oman, India and East Africa for which figures are unprocurable; the recorded movements of specie are therefore only approximate. The imports of treasure into the Persian ports show a slight decline of 1 per cent, and the exports a decrease of 18 per cent, below the year before. Lin gab imported 60 per cent., Bushire 32 per cent, and Bunder Abbas 8 per cent, of the total treasure imported ; and in the exports Lingah sent 81f per cent., Bushire 10^ per cent, and Bunder Abbas 8^ per cent, of the whole. India supplied 60 per cent, of the specie, nearly all to Lingah, principally for re -export to the Arab Coast and its neighbourhood for purchasing pearls, and oyster shells. Consequently the exports of specie from that port is four and a half times as great as those from the other two ports. Hitherto information regarding movement of specie at Shiraz has not been forthcoming, and the figures for 1898 obtained though the Imperial Bank of Persia were received too late to be included in the tables for centre of trade. The imnorts from the districts south of Shiraz were about 232,500 Tomans, equal to Ks. 6,45,833, and exports to the north were 263,400 Tomans, equal to Rs. 7,31,666. The Toman equals about Rs. 2-12-5. Mule ILire.—T&amp;Q rate of transport, a most important item in the import trade, opened with a quotation of Krans 105 per 100 maunds of 775 lbs. to Shiraz at the commencement of the year. It steadily declined till July, whenS6 ADMINISTKATION EEPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL it fell to Krans 70, the lowest figure touched, and, in the following two months, it stood at Krans 80, advancing Krans 5 in October and November, and finally the year closed with a quotation of Krans 90. Freight. —This ruled at 25s. per ton to London for the first five months of the year.' In June it rose to 30 shillings falling again in July and August to the former figure, and further declining to 22s. Cc^. in November. In December it stood at 23 shillings per ton. Shipping. —The returns show that the total number of steam vessels entering Bushire during 1&amp;98 was 98, with a tonnage of 99,847, an increase of 3 vessels and a slight fall in tonnage, as compared with 1897. Of these, 96 vessels carried the'British flag, and the other two were Norwegian and Turkish. The failure of the grain crops in Southern Persia and the Euphrates valley for the last three years have been the cause of the falling oil in the shipping trade, the other articles of export being insufficient to accommodate larger amount of tonnage without having to call at Indian ports to fill up on the return voyage.RESIDENCY A^D MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1898-99. 37 APPENDIX A TO PART III.

The statistics of the trade for the year are furnished by the Customs farmer, and their accuracy cannot be relied oq as it is obviously to his interest to sub mit as low a return as possible of the trade of the port in order to choke off would-ba competitors from endeavouring to purchase the right to farm the customs. The total value of the trade is returned at $4,289,600 as against $5,372,000 for the preceding year, showing a decrease of $1,082,400. The imports including specie show a decrease of $945,300, as compared with the figures of the previous year. The importation of arms received a severe check by the agreement entered into by the British, Persian and Maskat Governments for the suppression of the arms traffic into Persia and British India and the consequent seizure of the arms and ammunition found on the S. S. Baluchistan. While oil, twist and yarn from India, ghi from Persia and piece-goods from America show an increase, cereals, coffee, piece-goods, silk and rice from India show a remarkable decrease. The cause of the falling off in the importation of the latter article is stated to be due to the glut in the Maskat market arising from a large portion of the previous year's stock remain ing unsold. The exports also show a decrease of $137,100, particularly in dates to India, America and Turkey in Asia and limes to Persia. The cause of falling off in dates is due to the unfavourable crop of the previous year caused by the failure of the hot dry winds which usually prevail at this season of the year without which the date does not ripen. Under other heads, including specie, a slight increase is noticeable. The average price of dollars throughout the year varied from R130 to R140 per 100 dollars. The customs were farmed to Shett Damodhur Dharamsee for $145,000, C. G. E.

After the first few months which were affected by the failure of crops in the previous year there was a general improvement in trade, which would have been greater had the embargo on the export of grain not been enforced. Exports. Wheat. —The total export shows a great decrease owing to the absence of wheat ; a small quantity was forwarded to Basrah by native craft, the amount of which is not ascertainable. Ghi and wool. —Owing to scarcity of fodder and cold there was no ghi for export, and the supply of wool was of inferior quantity and not suitable for the London market. Gum. —The supply of gum was good and a large quantity remains to be shipped. J) a tes, —In April there was a demand for dates for the Persian Gulf Ports and prices rose 50 per cent,, the amount being shipped by native craft is not obtainable. Specie. —There was a further decrease of specie shipments to India, the increasing scarcity of rupees necessitating remittance by draft. Shipments of specie to Gulf Ports are chiefly on account of the Provincial Government. Imports. Cotton goods. —The increase in local imports is nearly entirely in cotton goods, chiefly due to petty traders on the Shat-el-Arab and from Hawizeh buying their supplies in Mohammerah, where the trade is in the hands of a native firm importing at a low rate of duty. These goods are nearly all imported from Manchester either direct^ or via Bombay ; the principal demand is, as previously reported, for grey shirt ings (8ib and 9ib ) ; prints, soft finish; tanjebs ; printed jaconet; lappets; imi tation Turkey red; imitation Syrian; and in addition this year for white shirting soft finish, principally for re -shipment to Shushter. Matches. —Matches show an increase of thirty per cent, due to spread of use. They are all of Swedish manufacture. Bice. —The imports of rice are entirely for re-shipment to Koweit in Turkish Arabia. Karun imports. —There was an increase in trade to the Karun ports chiefly from India due to increased prosperity and increased enterprise on part of the Shushter traders. Sugar, —Sugar, especially loaf, showed an increase, there being a demand for this from the tribes near Shushter and Dizlul; though principally liench beet, there were some consignments of Egyptian cane sugar, and endeavour to introduce this is being made. S hipping. Sea. —Seventeen steamers called from London, Manchester, and Marseil les and eight for Marseilles or London of the Anglo -Arabian »nd Persian Steam Navigation Company, and of Bucknall Brothers.118 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL From and to Bombay the Britisli India Steam Navigation Company's mail steamers called weekly, and those of the Bombay and Persia Steam Naviga« tion Company at internals. Returns of sailing craft under foreign flag are not obtainable. Karun~Vs\z Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company's steamer ran fortnightly to Bunder Nasri on the Karun. Freights. —Freights to London ranged from 23 in spring to R17 -6 in autumn; to India to R12-6 per ton. River steamer to Bunder Nasri about RIO and to Shushter about R18-6 per ton. Shoal. —On the 8th of February a shoal caused by silt from the Karun, formed in the Shat-el-Arab just below the Karun, which gradually shifted down the river till it disappeared in September. A griculttjke. Wheat. —The wheat crop was good, the area sown was much less than usual, but the return larger. As soon as the new crop was ready to cut, wheat of the 1896 crop which had been stored by the Arabs came into the market at 32 Krans per 156 ib ; the new wheat coming in brought the price down to 20 Krans; at Bunder Nasri the price ranged from 30 to 40 Krans per 376 &amp;, as the embargo was enforced no large purchases could be made, but small purchases were made for Basrab, where prices were high, which prevented prices from falling. Prospect for next harvest. —The rains at the end of the year were good and an unusually large amount of grain has been sown : grain came up well: but the result depends entirely on the March rains» Oilseed. —The oilseed, linseed and sesame crop was good, and the demand especially for sesame seed for export is encouraging cultivators to sow more; this crop is grown in the Dizful and Ram Hurmuz districts, where the fields are irrigated and largely independent of rains. Dates. —The date crop was very small owing to the cold spring Prices were abnormal, being per hundred weight from R9-3 to R7-8 according to quality, but falling, after the packing for the European market was finished to R6-9 to R5. ' Cattle. —The cold weather lasting unusually late checked the growth of fodder, and mortality among sheep continued during the first three months. In consequence the price of ghee in Mohammerah was 25 per cent above nnrmal from and after March. Caravans. No statistics of the caravan trade of Mohammerah are available. DizfuX.-- During the year few caravans have arrived from Dizful the trade with that town being now nearly entirely by river to Shushter. Uawizeh.—Ywm Ilawizeh caravans bring rice and load cotton goods. Interior.— route from Dizful to Khoremabad and beyond continued c osed by ths lawlessness of the tribes, in consequence some native merchants of Hamadan and other towns have been making enquiries as to the Shushter- Jspahan route, and one small experimental consignment gave satisfaction. A mule road is now being made from Bundar Nasri (Ahwaz) to Ispahan. Health.
