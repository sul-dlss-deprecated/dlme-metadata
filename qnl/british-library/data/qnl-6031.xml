As a result of this number the paper has been banned by His Highness’ orders and the editor, who is the only Yemeni teacher here (he has been here for about 10 years), has been dismissed from his post as a teacher. 3. Apparently the article that give offence was that on the first page which, to me, seems inoffensive enough. Yours sincerely, H.E. Sir xRupert Hay, KCIE., C3I., Political Resident, Persian Gulf Residency, Bahrain.Translation of an article published in A1 Arab Weekly News Paper, Paris owned by Yunus Bahry in issue No.64 dated 26th Rabia A1 Awal, 1368. THE SHAIKH OF KUWAIT SELLS HIS PEOPLE FOR A YACHT. It was announced by the United Press, Long Beach, Port, America that the American Oil Companies had presen ted the Shaikh of Kuwait, Ahmed A1 Jabir A1 Subah with a yacht edged with gold on the occasion of their recei ving an oil concession from him. The length of the yacht is 195 feet and it costs one million dollars. The Shaikh will board it to save himself from drowning in the oil of his poor people who are in need of a piece of bread, but nothing will save you from the wrath of God 0 Shaikh.Translation of an article published in A1 Arab Weekly Newspaper, Paris owned by Yunus Bahry in issue No.55 dated 3rd Rabia-Al Thani, 1368. AMIR OF KUWAIT SHAIKH AHMED AL JABIR AL SUBAH A Shaikh who has become very old and weak, has ruled this Arab State for 30 years and has made of his people, who total 100,000, phantoms who believe that there is no village beyond Abadan. He receives from the American Oil Companies, who are benefiting from the oil which belongs to the people of Kuwait, 50 thousand dollars per day, but no school has been opened nor has a hospital nor a mosque been built and he cares not but for himself, his palaces, his concubines and his American yacht which alone with its decorations and furnishings is worth one miilion dollars. He has not donated anything to save Palestine nor has he contributed a mouthful of bread to our unfortunate brothers the refugees. The miserliness of this shaikh has /known become better than the generosity of 'Hatim Tai' . You will even hear his relations grumbling at his ex treme miserliness towards them and at his disposition to wards himself and his private secretary (Izzat Jafar). He is like the B.B.C., spreads his empty propaganda of a string of lies on a wave length of 20 metres. It is time to abdicate his Office of State in favour of another better and more useful than himself.AL BAHID 28/3/49 The special correspondent of the paper at Kuwait sends the news of the generous donation which H.H. the -mir has made for the promotion of learning and the raising of the educational level of Kuwait, 1 he gift amounts to 3 millions of rupees to be spent by the authorities in charge of education on various projects connected with the increase of educational faciliation. Seven new schools are to be estabilighed and opened during the next school year. Soon Kuwait will have a considerable number of well-educated and professional men. The writer says that the standard of culture and education reached by -^uwait has mostly been due, exclusively to the Syrian, Egyptian and Palestinian teachers employed in the schools,. Then he commends some Kuwait families for the desire they show for education by encouraging their children to attend school.EXTRACTS FROM BAS BA. PRESS. AL NAS 29/3/49 . H.H the Sheikh of Kuwait is to make a trip to the Mirates of the Gulf, to India and Pakistan, the the yacht presented to him by Arabian Pacific Oil Company, to honour the signing of the oil agreement between the contracting parties, by which the Emir received the sum of ?i million dollars as an initial instalment. The yacht is first class but the company has made it better by spending between 1^ to 2 million dollars on decorating her and fitting her with additional luxuries. H.H. intends visiting Bahrain, ^.atar, Dubai, Muscat and Omman, on the Arabian coast from whence he will go to Karachi and from there to Bombay. When this trip is completed he will return to Shatt al Arab visiting Basra and lying at anchor at Mohemmerah and Abadan before returning to Kuwait. The correspondent admires the Sheikh’s discrimination in choosing the spring as the season for his trips. A few lines haves been deleted by the censor. In the end he seems to be critical of H.H’s procedure, and says he will have another word to say when the Emir starts this auspicious excursion.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000e1_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/5/226</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000e1</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/5/226</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 4/39 Kuwait State: Criticisms against the Sheikh and Government'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1949/1949</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-02-02T22:14:55</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (12 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the front to the rear of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence for this description commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 14; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This file contains articles from the Arabic-language press that all concern the Ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah.The articles - most of which are critical of the ruler and his government - are from the following publications:
