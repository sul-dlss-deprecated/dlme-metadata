INDIA OFFICE, LONDON, Forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary, Political Department, India Office.V JBfcm RECORD OF A IvffiETINC- HELD AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE ON MONDAY OCTOBER 8TH, REGARDLNG RELATIONS BETWEEN SAUDI ARABIA AND BAHRAIN« The following were present; Fir. Rendel, Sir A. Ryen Lieut•Colonel Fowle, I'^r. Lri tAwait e ) Mr. G.E. Crombie ) Mr. Johnstone ) Mr. Malcolm } Foreign Office (in the Chair) H.M. Minister at Gedda. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. India Office. Foreign Office. 3. MR. RENDEL recalled that the Saudi Government had been repeatedly invited to send delegates to Bahrain in order to discuss with the Bahrain Government the question of commercial relations between the two States. He v/as doubtful, however, whether the Saudi Government would agree to such a. conference while they were still in doubt whether or not His Majesty's Government were trying to blockade the Hasa coast. It might be necessary to make a definite statement of policy to the Saudi Government in order to persuade them to accept an invitation. 3. SiR A. RYAN stated that his conversation with King / JUtjg Ibn Saud at Taif previous to his departure on leave had convinced him that the King felt with great intensity about this subject, mere particularly in regard to what he con ceived to be His Majesty's Government's boycott of his j , attempts to develop the Ha.sa coast. He took umbrage at / ' anything in the nature of exceptional treatment of his /*• ports as compared wit brothers in the Gulf. He already j ( ! f believedbelieved that the Bahrain Government, whom he identified with His Majesty's Government, were preventing ships from carrying cargo direct to the Hasa Coast* such a notifica*- tion by the Bahrein Government with regard to vessels carry- ine direct cargo for the mainland as Colonel Fowle had proposed in his letter Ho*575/S of the 25th June to Mr. Laithwaite, would only intensify King. Ibn Baud's grievance. 4. COLON’LL FOVLE explained that his proposal had been intended as no more than a. tentative suggestion, and that in the light of the views expressed by the Foreign Office (see hr. Rendel T s letter of ' to Mr. Laithwaite) and the Board of Trade in regard to it, he was willing, to withdrew it. 5. The discussion then passed to the question of the tactics to be adopted vis-a-vis of King Ibn Baud in dealing with this dispute. Assuming that the question of the economic relations between Bahrain and baudi Arabia would have to be included among the subjects discussed in the proposed general negotiations between His Majesty’s Govern ment and the baudi Government (and the meeting agreed that this question must in fact be pooled with other outstanding questions in these negotiations) it was necessary to draft a line of policy for Sir A.Ryan’s guidance. There were two distinct aspects of this question: (a) King Ibn baud desired an assurance from His Majesty Government that the hostile attitude of Be-hrain towards direct shipments to Hesa, the most striking example of which was the 'Ahmedi' case, did not represent the consistent policy of the Ba v r° 4 n Gove ran e-j’i or His Majesty's Government. fb)3 . (b) Apart from this question of direct shipment to Hasa ports, there nras also the question of the rate at which the transit dues levied by the Bahrain Government on goods for the mainland were to be fixed. 6. With regard to (a) the first point that arose was whether it was permissible or desirable to use the possi bility of a policy of 'blockade' as a threat to induce Ibn Baud to agree to a conference at Bahrain. 7. MRo LAITHWAITE suggested that, although it was clearly desirable to arrange a conference at Bahrain if this could possibly be managed, ultimately, if the Saudi Government proved unaccommodating, a policy in the sense indicated by the Bahrain Government’s action in the 'Ahmedi' case might be justified on grounds of necessity. The bheikh of Bahrain could not afford to lose the money which came to him from Bahrain's transit trade and his action in defence of this trade could be justified on those same grounds of uigent economic necessity which Fuad Bey Hamza had recently invoked in defence of the Saudi blockade of Koweit. It therefore seemed legitimate at least to threaten King Ibn Baud with the possibility of action in this sense, and perhaps also to use this threat as a lever to secure the lifting of the Koweit blockade. 8. MR. RENDEL saw the strongest objection to using an argument which virtually amounted to the thesis that necessity knows no law', even if the Saudi Government had themselves appealed to it in connexion with their treatment of....4. 0 °. of Koweit. In his view such a policy could only he justified as a direct measure of retaliation against the Koweit blockade - and it had been agreed that there were serious objections to establishing any direct connexion between these two questions. Moreover the influence enjoyed by His Majesty^ Government in Arabia and the Persian Gulf rested in face partly on their not using such retaliatory methods. Two blocks did not make a white and we should gain nothing by using the illegitimate methods sometimes practised by our adversaries. further, the Saudi Govern ment had already been assur ed that the 'Ahmedi' incident did*not represent a settled policy, and that His Majesty’s Government did not intend to blockade Hasa. 9. SIR A. RYAN added that, in his view, the Saudi blockade of Koweit and the suggested Bahraini blockade of the Hasa ports were not really parallel. A precedent for the first might perhaps be found elsewhere, but it would in Sir A. Ryan’s opinion be contrary to all civilized practice to prohibit the carriage of goods, by way of through ship ment, to the Hasa Coast under penalty of the ships not being allowed to call at Bahrain or compelled to pa^y transit dues there. He considered that His majesty's Government would not be able to justify these extraordinary measures which constituted King Ibn Baud's main grievance. In replying to the Saudi complaint His Majesty's Government must either deny that they, or the Bahrain Government, were preventing British shipping from making direct shipments to the Hasa coast or they must admit it. He suggested that a possible course....5. course mi girt l)e io Pdiiiit&gt; ‘tlie-'t 'tlie Brit/ish. iiidis- Compsny were acting under some pressure from the Bahrain Government and in the light of their own interests, tut to add that His Majesty's Government would not actually encourage the Company to adopt another policy unless a satisfactory general settlement were reached between Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. 10. MR. HHNDHL objected that tins might result in an awkward discussion with the Saudi Government as ’go the extent to which action could be taken oy His Majesty 1 s Government to facilitate direct shipments, and that such discussion might end in His Majesty’s Government being engaged in more active intervention than they had contemplated. On the main point at issue he added that it seemed unlikely that King Ibn Baud would agree to a conference until he knew whether a blockade were seriously threatened or not. In view of this and also of the irregularity of a, blockade policy, he proposed that King ibn Baud should be approached on the following lines, ho blockade would be imposed on Saudi ports; on tne other hand the tiansit dues were essential to the finances of Bahrain, his Majesty’s Government must, therefore, once again invite the Saudi Government to discuss the general question of their commercial relations with Bahrain at a conference. If a. satisfactory general settlement were reached at this conference, His Majesty’s Government would undertake to see that the transit dues were not raised above a certain point. This would enscle His Majesty’s Government to make the proposal for a conference attractive to the Saudi Government without necessitating6. necessitating the employment of a threat of doubtful legitimacy. 11. SIR A. RYAN egreed generally. He then further elaborated Mr. Renders suggestion and proposed that the following line should be taken with the Saudi Government on their being once again invited to a. conference at Bahrain (a) The Saudi Government should be assured once again that the action of the Bahrain Government in connexion with the !, Ahmedi' incident did not represent r settled policy. (b) As regards the attitude of British shipping towards direct shipments to Hasa, the Saudi Government might be told that His Majesty's Government were unable to dictate a. policy to the interests concerned, who naturally followed their own advantage. His Majesty's Government would, however, ensure that the Bahrain Government did not exercise undue pressure. (c) The Bahrain Government were entitled to raise the transit dues. Sir A. Ryan very much doubted, in spite of the renewed representations which had recently been mode to them, whether the Saudi Govenment would agree to a conference without receiving beforehand an assurance that is Majesty’s Government did not intend to enforce a blockade of the Hasn ports. Such an assurance might nevertheless be confined to tiie most general terms and it might be hinted to the Saudi Government that, if they proved obdurate, the transit dues might be raised against themthem* 12. MR. LAITHWAI might refuse to negoti agreed, hut observed t the proposal for a conference, he might be told that the Bahrain Government must recompense themselves for the lack of any satisfactory commercial arrangement with Saudi Arabia by raising the dues. The question then arose whether any raising of the dues in these or similar circumstances should extend to the levying of dues on those goods which at present pass into Saudi Arabia free as being for the King’s personal use. SIR A. RYAN recommended that goods which were genuinely for King Ibn Saud's own use should in any case continue to enjoy exemption, since his resentment at the removal of this privilege might do more damage to Anglo-Saudi relations than its abolition could profit Bahrain. MR. LAITHWAITE inclined to the view that, if failure to reach an agreement resulted in an economic war, even King Ibn Saud's personal stores could not be passed over 0 As it was, he appeared to be receiving under this exemption consignments very much larger then the needs of his household would seem to warrant, e.g. 30,000 bags of rice, end it might be assumed that the surplus went to the tribes. 13. On the main issue MR. LAITHWAITE and COLONEL FOWLE concurred generally in the course proposed by Sir a Ryan. Mr. Laithwalte proposed, however, that the assurance regarding the blockade should only be given if o o 7 . TE suggested thet Xing Ibn Saud ate under e threat. SIB A. RYAN hat if King ibn Saud did declineIt the 3a.udi Gover.ment refused to attend the conference unless they received it* He also preferred that His Majesty's Government should not specifically undertake to ensure that the Bahrain Government did not being pressure to bear on the shipping companies* It had already been arranged that the Political .Agent, Bahrain, would lend his assistance in connexion with any discussions at Bahrain. But, if the Saudi Government particularly desired that the negotiations should be tripartite, there would be no objection to arranging for the Political Agent or the Political Resident to be a, member of the conference. It seemed, however, better that the Bahrainis and Saudi representatives should, at any rate in the first instance, deal with the matter direct, with the informal assistance of the Political Agent. 14. MR. RhNDEL also agreed to the course proposed, A threat to raise the transit dues would, in his view, be a legitimate bargaining; counter, whereas a threat of a blockade would not. 15. MR. LAITK' ; AIIE in conclusion suggested that it might be possible to say to the Saudi Government that, if they would agree to negotiate at Bahrain, His Majesty's Government for their part would advise the ■Bahrain Government not to exercise for the time being their undoubted sovereign rights and raise the dues* A summary of the course of action agreed upon by the meeting was then dictated, which is given below as amended later by Sir A. Ryan* 1. It is still the policy of His Majesty's GovernmentGovernment to press for en early discussion of this question at a Baudi-Bahra.ini conference, to he held at Bahrain, with the assistance of the political authorities, to explore all the issues end endeavour to arrive at a settlement which would he confirmed in due course through the , diplomatic channel. See the 1932 correspondence, the record of Sir Ac Ryan’s conversation with Ihn Send at Taif on Jule 13th last and the record of the conversation with Fuad Bey Hamza at the Foreign Office on September 21st 0 2 C If the Saudi Government now agree to this local conference and a settlement acceptable to the Governments concerned results from it, cadit quaestio* If a settlement does not result, the ground will be clear for further discussion with the Saudi Government in the course of the general negotiations contemplated after Sir Ao Ryan returns to Gedda* 3. If, as a condition of agreeing to the local conference the Saudi Government press for a statement by His Majesty's Government as to their attitude regarding the imposition of restrictions by Bahrain on direct shipments to the Hasa Coast, Mr. Calvert, or in due course Sir A. Ryan, is authorised to ma.ke a statement on the following lines, using discretion as to the precise form to be given to it;- (a) The action of the Bahrain authorities at the time of the isolated Ahmedi incident was10. was en expedient adopted by them in conditions of urgency and did not represent a considered policy of His Majesty’s Vj v ^ Government• (b) Neither His Majesty’s Government nor the Bahrain Government have forbidden shipping companies to accept cargo for direct shipment to the Rasa Coast, under penalty O-l not being allowed to call at Bahrain, although, in the single case of the Ahmedi, transit duty was claimed. His Majesty's Government cannot in fact issue instructions to snipping companies regarding such matters in normal circumstances. It is for the companies themselves to consider applications lor facilities for direct snipment, neving regard to all the factors affecting them, including such regulations as may be made by the Bahrain Government in the exercise of their sovereign rights. (c) i;is Majesty’s Government are, however, c ' n ^ous to promote the removal of a.ll causes of difficulty in connexion with the general Question of shipments for Hesa. If the loc^1 conference is agreed to and produces favourable results, they will urge the Bahrain Government to refrain from any future action analogous to that taken in the case of the Ahmedi. (d)11 . (d) it is owin^ to tlic influence of His r-^jesty’s Government, whicla w?s exerted n oro.inly with the Brnrain Government in 1910, that Saudi importers have for many years enjoyed trie benefit of a very f p - arable rate of transit duty. His Majesty’s Government cannot, however, ignore the importance of the transit trade to the economic life of Bahrain. Hhile recognising that the fostering of direct trade to the Saudi mainland is a matter entirely within the rights of the Saudi government, tiiey must eouaiiy recognise tnat any considerable diversion of trade ■^rom its present channels would seriously Pj-fcct tne revenues of Bahrain and would necessarily compel the Bahrain Government to compensate themselves by raising the o.ues on goods continuing to pass through Bahrain. The interests of Bahrain and .&lt; ■ sa must continue to be interdependent :or many years to come and the case is one ior a mutual accommodation of those interests. (e) His Majesty’s Government consider that this statement should remove any misgiving on tne part of the Saudi Government as to their attitude, which is inspired solely by their desire to promote the desired accommodation of interests, as a result of0 12. t of f. fres exchsnge of viev/s between experts qualified by local knowledge to advise on the best means of attaining it. &gt; 4. If the Saudi Government should not agree to the local conference and its proceedings should nevertheless be delayed by insistence on the Saudi side on the grievances alleged by Ibn Saud, the Political Agent will have authority to moke a statement on the above lines at any stage, where it may seem to him appropriate. 5. The Saudi Government have made a special point of urging that goods consigned to Ibn Saud or his Government should be exempted from transit dues. If the local conference is agreed to, this point will doubtless be raised and it will be necessary to define the scope of any such exemption. If no settlement is arrived at, it may become necessary, not only to raise the dues, but to restrict the exemption or to refuse nay exemption whatsoever, even in the case of goods for Ibn Saud ! s personal use. It is left to the discretion of the Legation in Jedda and the Political Agent to include a hint a.s to the ultimate possibility of a severe restriction of existing exemptions in vny statement on the a.bove lines, buu care should be taken to avoid any premature pronouncement which might be construed a,s a threat aimed at Ibn Baud personally.GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN. £&gt;4, v D.O.

It seems to me that the pendulum has now swung back, and since the Bahrain Government cannot repeat the action in the Ahmedi case I suggest that we shoulu take the opportun ity of furthering British shipping interests against the competition of foreign shipping interests by informing kessrs* acklnnon /- 2 - MackiniiOn MackeiLiia A Co. conficiantiaia^ that no reatrictiona will be placad by the Bahrain Oovemmeut on veaaela which carry cargo for direct diacharge at mainland porta. The Britiah India Steam Navigation Com^ny^who are the only Company to run a regular weekly service in the Perai&amp;n Qulf, including Bahrain, will be in a very strong poaition to eliminate foreign competition if they can make iiaa Tanurah a regular port of call for their alow mall ateamera. 4. I am not aware to what extent the proposed communication to Messrs. Mackinnon Mackenzie &amp; Co. will deprive Sir Andrew Byan of a card in the forthcoming negotiations, but as it la very likely that the ;^audi Government will press early for a statement from His Majesty’s Government on the question, it la a card whose value would soon vanish. 5. with regard to Messrs. Mackinnon Mackenzie &amp; Co.'a enquiry as to the possibility of Government undertaking the survey and marking of the channels to Has Tanurah 1 propose, if there ia no objection, to advise the Company to raise the question with the Persian Gulf Lighting and Buoying Committee. At the same time it Is for consideration whether, now th t it is in our Interests to render the approach to the port safe for British shipping, we could not make a virtue of necessity by offering to the Gaudl Government to undertake, on payment, the work of providing navigational aids for the approach to the port. It is a gesture that would probably be appreciated by Ibn Baud. 6. .vhen, and if, cargo is taken direct to uas Tanurah instead of passing through Bahrain, the Bahrain Government will of course lose heavily on th«ir trams it dues, but this seems /-3- seems inevitable* I am sending copies of this letter to His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires, Jeada and the /olitical Agent, Bahrain, with whom 1 have dis- cussed the question* I have the honour to oe, Sir, Your most obedient servant, sd# T.

We have the honour to invite your attention to the subject of steamers calling at the Fort of Has Tanurah. Up to the ^resent we have declined to send our kail steamers into that port for two reasons, firstly because of the navigational dangers entailed in niaking the port of Ras Tanurah and the difficulties oi finding a suitable anchorage with adequate b*ing,ng room for the vessels and secondly because we were unwilling to take any action which might prejudice the good relations which have existed between this Company and the Ghaikh of Bahrain for a very long period. Unfortunately inuications are that we shall be forced to send steamers to Ras Tanurah or allow other Lines to intervene in the Persian Gull trade which this Company has built up over an expensive period as it is obvious that any Line willing to send steamers to Ras Tanurah will be unable to maintain a service to that port only and cover expenses. The e.g^Ahmedi' called at Ras Tanurah in 1932 and the s.8. M Fagervik M called last year and it is therefore clear that the danger to which we allude is not imaginary and we apprehend that unless this Company can ta..e steps to cater for the trade Ibn Saud will come to some arrangement with another Line as, according to our information, he is determined to obtain regular direct shipment to Raa Tanurah.'I - 2 - 2m «ve have the honour to enquire therefore if there is any possibility of the Government unaert kin* the survey and proper marking of the channels to Has T&amp;nurah to afford safe parages to vessels bound for th t port and whether you could see your way to approach the Shaikh of Bahrain with a view to obtaining the withdrawal of all notifications placing restric tions on Vessels calling at Bahrain when such vessels have also cargo for direct discharge at mainland porta.CONFIDENTIAL.

Sir, &lt;1&lt;K with reference to India Office letter No.Z.4687/34 of the 18th July, regarding Bahrain transit dues, I an directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to request you to inform Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare that he has had u der ^ consideration the proposal put forward by the Political •v Resident in lilio iersian Gulf that the Bahrain Government should forbid vessels which carry direct cargo for the mainland to call at Bahrain on the sane voyage. 2. From previous official and semi.official correspondence between the Foreign Office and India Office on this subject v ad in particular from Mr. Rendel*s letter No.£. 142/101/25 of the 31st January to Mr. Laithwaite, Sir Samuel Koare will be aware that Sir John Simon views with serious misgiving the present policy of the Bahrain Government with regard to the Hasa Coast trade, which appears to him to be not only contrary to ordinary international practice in these matters but also detrimental to relations between His MajestyIs Government in the United Kingdon and the Saudi Goverment and possibly even to the best interests of the Bahrain Government themselves. The effect of Colonel Fowle f s present proposal would be to invest with the character of a public and settled policy, the principles which inspired tye action of the Bahrain Government in the isolated cese of the .Ahmedi. The adoption of so drastlean expedient in the hd^e of safeguarding the p o sition/position 01 tne -ucoiirain Govsrriinen't — &amp;,n object wiiicii incidentally it seems most ill-calculated to achieve - appears to Sir John Simon to be open to objection under each of the three heads mentioned above. &lt;-/• So far as international practice is concerend, Sir John Simon observes that in a semi-official letter oi the 15th September to Mr. laithwaite, Mr. Marker of the Board of Trade characterises the procedure suggested by Colonel Fowle as high-handed. with this description Sir John Simon fully agrees. Although the proposed measure might technically avoid the charge of discrimination in re ard to trade with Hasa insofar as it would be equally applied to shipping of all nationalities, the action suggested, even though legally within Bahrain’s sovereign rights, would certainly le open to . a ccusation that it was in fact an attempt to dietate the channels through which seacorne trade with tne Ease coast must pass. It would also expose the Bahrain Government to the change of discrimination of a different kind, as it would be peculair to ships wishing to trade with the Has^a Coast. Ships wishing to carry direct cargo to that Coast would be debarred fron calling at T 'ahrain on the same voyage but no such prohibition would apply to ships with direct cargo for non-Saudi ports such as Basra, Dibai, or the ports of the Persian coast. 4. On these grounds the proposed action v,ould most certainly ce resented by the Sa.udi Government. From the memorandum by His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda recordiig his conversation's with King Ibn Baudot Taif in July, a copy of v/hich was enclosed in Foreign Office letter No.E.5063/2429/2523 of the 27th August to the India Office, it is clear that the steps already taken by the Baixai n Government io the matter of transit dues end direct shipments to the Hgsa Coast have aroused King Ibn Saud’s bitterest resentment. The burden of King Ibn Saud^ complaint is that His Majesty’s Government - for he persists in attaching the true responsibility for this matter to His Majesty’s Government ratner than the Bahrain ^ Government - have been trying to make him economically dependent Mi-on Bahrain and to place him in such a position that it would be a waste of money for him to devojlop his own ports, only to see them rendered useless by a British boycott. A public notice in the terms contemplated by Colonel Fowle could only confirm him in this belief. In paragraph 6 of his letter Co.'.onel Fowle admits the t the action which he proposes would probably not be received with equanimity by the Saudi Government, but he suggests that any unpleasentness fro,, that quarter must be faced. Clearly, however, it is not a case of rousing a passing irritation, but of exciting in King Ibn Saud a rancourous hatred of the methods employed by the Bahrain Government in what he not unnaturally regards as an attempt to secure a stranglehold on the import trade of Hasa* 5. Finally, it appears open to question whether the action proposed would in fact be in the best interests of the Bahrain Government themselves. v/hile not wishing to press his views on a point which is primarily the concern of the India Office and the _ ocal autho ities, Sir John Simon feels bound to suggest that, in view o*.f King Ibn -audts attitude, tre present policy of the Bahrain Government may well in the end defeat its own object by stimulating the Saudi Government and/and the Standard Oil Company of California, which h£. s now a great interest in devolpping the Hasa potfts, to develop those ports more rapidly and intensively and to make every possible effort to make themselves independent of Bahrain. The ultimate ^f. ort Of this can only be to reduce the Bahrain transit trade, and as Banrai n is admittedly dependent on its transit dues, t .e effort can only be very serioud to Bahrain finances. 6. So far as Colonel Howie’s proposal is concerned, there may also be considerable danger to British interests, since it seems open to doubt whether in fact the pos*iblity of Japanese competition with British shipping and trade can be so lightly dismissed s it is in aragraph o of Colonel Fpwles fetter -f the 25th t-une. The Japanese have been energetically exploring commercial possibilities in the Persa# Gulf; further, Mr. xhilby informed His Majesty’s Minister at Jedaa orally on the 14th July that one of the ftusaibi family had been enlarging to King |bn Baud on the possibilities of trading with the Japanese. There thus appears to be some danger that if the Japanese were to run a shipping service to all ports except Bahrain, but including Has Tanura, the eventual result would be to-foster the sale of Japanese goods and the use of Japanese sh$ps to the detriment both of British trade and British shipping. As Sir Samuel Koare is aware, the possibility of effecting a general settlement with the Saudi Government of all outstanding' questions between them and His Majesty’s Government is a t present under consideration. It is proposed that/(iT) tliat this settlement should include many questions of great importance to the nrab Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf, more especially those of the Koweit blockade, of the eastern and south-eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia and ol the Bahrain transit dues. The desirability of such a settlement was urged uoon the De.p^juy Baud Arabian Minister for Foreign Affairs during his recent visit to London and the possible items in it were discussed individually. Faud Bey Hamza agfeed in principle to the general proposal, though naturally suoject to the approval of King Ibn Baud. At the end of the conversation relating particularly to the Bahra n transit dues, Faud bey agreed to make a further attempt to persuade King Ibn Saud to send a Saudi delagation to Bahrain in order to discuss the transit dues question. 8. Apart fro t the general arguments aguinst Colonel Fowle’s proposal, therefore,it appears desirable at least to postpone aqy action in the sense he suggests, a.t any rate until it is known ,whether Faud Bey’s representations have induced King Ibn Saud to agfee to a conference, or wnether, failing this, the proposal for a general settlement, including the transit dues problem,will be found practicable, In any case, it is clear from King Ibn Baud’s conversations with Sir Andrew By an at Taif, that action in the sense proposed by Coloc^frl Fowle would in all probability provoke the King to such indignation that it 'would prove fatal to any hi pe of promoting a sett lenient at all. In these circumstances Sir John Simon hlpes that the idea of any such^action will not be approved by Sir Samuel Hoare. 9.

As you will observe a now and possibly important factor has now been introduced into the problem, viz. the possibility of foreign shipping being encouraged by an obstructive attitude on the part of the Bahrain Ooveimaent to compete with British lines in the Persian Oulf carrying trade. it would therefore aeon advisable to tnite stock of the situation and to consider carefully (a) what are our precise objectives* vb) what is the 'best aeans of aobieving them, it will no doubt ce agreed that our sain objectives are (1) to safeguard the financial interests of Bahrain which, ii' it wore to lose its present position as the entrepot lor the Arab Ooaat Trade, would probably suffer complete financial collapse* ( 8 ) to assist in 30 far as may be possible British shipping flraa to retain their presentprcsanfc predominant position in the Persian Gulf, which would he threatened, ir they deoiineu. c»o oarry cargo direct to Ihn baud’s ports on the mainland and foreign firms (e.g. Japanese firms wno have already shown interest in this trade) are able and willing to do so. Xnese two ohjeo lives are to some ej; bfc;n t conflicting but it appears tc tho aovernment of India that the conflict can he resolved and both objectives achieved, if tlie establish ment of an effective port &amp;o Bus Xanurah or elsewhere on the mainland by Ibn Saud can be prevented or at least indefinite ly postponed# Bahrain * s interest in cuch|de veiopmen ts lies not only in the loss of her transit duos which are a comparatively small item but also in general loss of trace and inhabitants. Should Has Tanurah become a port for ocean-going ships it wouXd be necessary for shipping agents ana merchants* who now prefer the safety and amenities of X-ahrain, to migrato to Has Xanurah* Thus the revenue which now accrues to Bahrain from customs duties on articles consumed locally would materially deareas© and their profits from trade would largely disappear. 3. It remains to consider whether it is possible to persuade Ibn laud to drox&gt; his scheme 3 for mainland ports and if 30 what arguments arc most likely to appeal 00 liim. jfowle-3- Fowle in hia laUat Qoamuaioafcian tatos the view that the ^stablishiiien t or a port at Hag Taturah ig inevitable and tn-?t we should maive the hegt of a bad joh ana assist in iiiakixi fe uae port sat'e for British shipping. rne Governaent of India however oonsiaer tnat this view is unduly possliiis tio. In the first place we Know tnat Idn Saua has been unable aur^ng tae last years to muse any real pix)gres3 towards inaiiing Has Tanurah a suitable and safe port X v or ocean-going snips* He is moreover most unlikely to ue i: t a position to spend much money on it in tne near future as nis exchequer was put to a great strain by the recent operations against the Yemen, To us it seems that nia annoyance over the Bahrain tr^isit dues and nis desire to get them reiuoved is due in ■oart at least to the knowledge that he cannot develop tlie jfiainlfind ports without an amount of expense and trouble wiieh he is not prepared to face. If this estiiaatw^li correct it would need no groat concessions to induce aim to oe reasonable. Turning now to the question of viUtt B^Jlrain can offer we are strongly inclined to the view that she might with advantage to herself surrender her re-export duties altogether f i.e. # not only transhipment dues but al?o dues on goods actually landed at Bahrain and re-exported within 20 days, fe have seen the great prosperity which has attended the policy of-4 © Vo 0 r Tree ports* at Singapore, Hong Kong ana xam and Bahrain’s favourable geographical situation via-a-vis the Hasa hinterland should with the advantage that she haa enjoyed for many y-ars enable her to secure an unassailablo position as the c:i jot of vrah trade. So imaerstana that the re-export autios at present collected ao not nzoeo&lt;L about j.Is. 30,000/- por annum and this though a considerable sum for an impover- ishod 3 v£.i.e should be offset by iiicreased IncoiiU from custo/w^ duties on articles consumed or ^ urate sea locally* Xlie new Income from oil ^Iiioh Bahrain is now commencing to receive should also make it easier for then to risk the surrender of a small and In any case uncertain iHa of income in order to increase their eventual prosperity.

We find it difficult to accept Fowls*e premise that sole advantage accruing to Bahrain by das Tanurah not being developed is retention of transhipment dues. The argument in paragraph 2 of our demi-official letter No. F.166-N/34 of December 24th 1934 was that loss of transhipment dues might prove small item in comparison with loss in tr«de, population customs dues to Bahrain if she ceased to be sole entrepot of nortnem Arabian coast. li only live per cent of present mercantile community in Bahrain found it necessary to migrate to Has Tanurah, Bahrain would lose five per cent of her customs dues or about Rs. 30,000 in addition to re-export duties. 3he would also lose if das lanurah became a useful port or big town the custom of those who now come from Kasa to buy supplies and replenish their stocks. At present we understand that miscellaneous goods are not imported direct to the mainland owing to the un certainty of demand but are stocked by merchants in Bahrain and purchased from them as required by shAp-kee^ars and others on ^vrab Coast.

They appreciate immediate financial loss involved. But this as Government of India point out is less important now with oil royalties than it would have been and in any event is not comparable to loss which any development of Ras Tanurah would involve. 2 .

We greatly hope that Fowle will be able to persuade Shaikh that on a long view proposal on lines suggested above for abolition of re-export and transit dues promises to work out best in his-own interests. If Shaikh as we hope agrees and if we can arrange local conference with Sa’udis concession / evidence of Bahraini goodwill to Bin Sa’ud. Failing conference it can be made by Ryan on same grounds. We agree with Government of India (save in improbable event of offer by Sa’udis to cease development In return for concession over transhipment) it would be undesirable to link the concession openly in any way with lengthy preliminary discussion as guarantee that Has Tanurah would not be developed.

When I approached the Shaikn _n regard to (a) agenda and (b) date of proposed conference at Bahrain, he agreed after some discussion between himself. Shaikh *Abdullah tin »Isa and me. Be Arab reminded me t t once that ior many years w&gt;a*udi/Government iad enjoyed rate of 2% on which his Majesty’s Government nad insisted, instead of %$% for which Shaikh ’Isa nad pressed (in 1917 he nad mposed 5$). I* should judge, however, that he is fr endly disposed in the matter towards Bin Sa’ud for whom he has a great personal regard. •i. I feel that -»■ should at tne outset warn you that it would be most inadvisable for us to be placed in the posit on of forcing (or appear jag to force) on to Bahrain the giving up of the transit Fact that we hisisted on 2% instead of Shaikh ’Isa’s 2A (or 5 £) has always been regarded locally and along the coast as an instanc of t our sacrificing the interests of our weaker fr.enas to those w‘t s.e. Hrp— 785S&amp;P—(M-10U)—18-8-33—2.00.000. / pOWCTpower While I appreciate arguments used, 1 think that proposal vies is based to some extent on misconception of : first place our present information is (a) tnat Bln Sa f ud has done no work recently at Has i amir ah and (b) that the California Arabian Standard Oil Company have made pier (and according to latest news living houses) at A1 Akhbar (some miles south of bammam) where steamers cannot go. In view especially of (b). development of steamer port seems much less likely tnan it was when 5. In the second place, even if &amp;ln Ba*ud were to make landing arrangements at a mainland port, it seems improbable that larg^- to n v-ould grow up (a) because the Ss^udi Arao Government nave treated their merchants so badly over money, (b) because tae leading Najdi merchants (Qusaibis and Bassams) are buying land and 'uig^iag them selves ln n in Bahrain, and (cj because, mo:t important , all openly fear chaos when Bin 3a , ud dies. 6. Although, in the event of a port being established on the mainland, some persons would no doubt leave Bahrain, it seems unlike! that the numbers who left vou^d materially affect local consumption; and on the other hind if a port is not made there is no reason to suppose tnat any more people will come to Bahrain because of the reduction of the 2$ dues. 7. ihe figure Hs.d0,000/- for the transit dues is now an under estimate, as the actuals for the last nine months are Rs..M,474/-. This figure is likely to improve as the California Arabian Standard Oil Company is beginning to tranship considerable quantities of roateriel to A1 Akhbar. 8. I am not ha A py over comparison of Bahrain with Singapore, Hong Kong and Aden as conditions seem so different. Incidentally, I presume those ports charge harbour dues, which Bahrain does not. ^ if you wrote your letter No:1064-S dated the ?0th November 1954i*. nould. suggest tnat the Bahrain representatives at the Conference should hear the complaints of the S&amp;»udi Arab Government and try to find out if possible what their intentions are. As the ba’udi Arab representatives will have come to a conference, it will no doubt be necessary to meet them to some extent in the interests of friendship and I believe that a settlement might be reached on the lines of giving a snail reauction in the transit cuss and granting a Iree pass for a fixed annual Quantity (whi.ch might be generous) of certain commodities for the personal use of din SaJud. 10. I feel that it is important to retain some transit aue — x *1 quote the general local belief j as 'v^hen hasa and fiajd revert to chaos n , it would be easier to increase an existing transit due than to re-impose one which had been abolished. i.ieut-Colonel, Political Agent, Bahrain.- 2 - that in 1920 under ^res&amp;ure from us they lowered their transit dues for wfiat they considered was to the benei it 01 Ihn daud) that we ware now asking tliem to give up for the advantage of the d^udi Govemrient a certain income o; cs.30|000/- a year to ward off a hypothetical danger which at present seems most unliKeiy to m&amp;teirlalise • 4. further if I were to put prqpoeai to shaikh and lie were to ask mie| as most likely he would* what was cy personal opinion of the likelihood of the development of Has Tanura* i do not see how 1 could avoid replying that the likelihood at present seemed to me very small* 6.

His Majesty's Government recognise advantage of informal discussion.

COifc' No. ( IDEWTIAL /t&gt;L February I2th 1935. Dear Colonel Loch, /fith reference to our recent conversation about Ibn Saoud and the R.E. duty it may interest you to hear of a conversation which I had yesterday with Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa. He came to see me about some other matter and by chance began to talk of this matter. He reminded me that since the Turks were in Hassa Bahrain has charged dues on transit cargo which used to pay the full until, very unwillingly, Shaikh Isa reduced it to at the request of Colonel Dickson. He does not believe that Ibn Saoud will make a port at Ras Tanoura because he cannot afford to and because it is not a suitable place for a pofct. However a port was made he believes that apart from the loss of the actual dues it would not affact Bahrain because none of the important mainland merchants would move there because if they did so they would become liable to the exorbitant taxation and frequent demands for loans,^which are never repaid, and they would have to pay the very heavy customs duties which in some cases are over 100%. He says more merchants from the mainland are coming here mainly to avoid taxation in their own country. t Also everyone knows that if anything happen^ to Ibn Saoud there will be an end to all law and order in his country. He thinks that as Bahrain holds all the cards if any concession is made it should be a small one such as exemption on a certain amount of the King^ own imports, he was very doubtful at the idea of reducing the rate generally. He thought it possible unavoidable that one or two small ships might visit Ras Tanoura every year, f Crr^ COCONFIDENTIAL.

His dealings in respect of arms appear to have been with German firms, perhaps with Italy and with Poland, where Ibn Sa'ud placed a very large order in 1930.

What threat of development of Ras Tanurah is to Bahrain penalisation of shipments is to Sa’udi Government while (b) is a friendly gesture. 4. You should therefore arrange that Bahrain Government after suitable hesitation (so as not to cheapen their concession in proportion) should grant (a) and (b). 5.

Such surrender would operate against her even in the event of disappearance of present Saudi regime.(2) We are aware that Foreign Office hold strong views about procedure adopted In Ahmedi case but we have never admitted that that action was contrary to international usage (even if that is applicable in present case) or in capable of repitition in certain circumstances.

It wi 1 be seen from paragraph 6 of Resident*s telegram of February 7th, 177, that Bahrain Government are prepared to acquiesce in this. Moreover categorial nature of assurance of non-repetition of Ahmedi policy in future which is contained in Bahraini representative’s letter of April 7th would be difficult to reconcile with a proposal to limit it in time or to leave it open to denunciation at few (ommiss-ion) notice thought Bahrain Government intended such limitation. Intermediate course proposed n Jedda telegram of May 13th, 112, is dependent on our future policy towards Treaty of Jedda.

This letter records concurrence of the Secretary of State for India in the proposal that the sutMitsinee 0 f the agreement reached between the Bahraini and Saudi delegations at their recent conference on the Bahrain transit dues etc#, should be embodied in cm exchange of notes between His Majesty’s representative at Jedda and the Saudi Minister for Foreign -affairs. It has now also been agreed ^ that the undertaking by the Government of Bahrain not to claim dues on goods carried direct to or from ports of Saudi Arabia without trand-shipment at Bahrain in ships calling at Bahrain should be made perpetual. 2. In view of the agreement reached between the interested departments of His Majesty’© Government as to the procedure to be followed in giving effect to the conclusions reached at the Bafcrsin conference, an early opportunity was taken to raise the matter with Fuad Bey Hamza in ondon, and it was discussed at both the Fifth (First Part) and Sixth meetings with His Excellency on 15th July and 18th July respectively. Records of these two meetings will reach you b/ this bag under cover of my despatches Nos.204 of 23rd July and No.211 of 25th July; and you will observe that it was agreed that as soon as draft notes had been prepared and a proved by His Majesty’s Government and the Government of Bahrain copies of them would be sent to Fuad Bey Hamza through the Saudi Minister in London. At the same time copies would be forwarded to you at Jedda with instructions •.• 3. Calvert, Beq., eto .0 etc., etc., Jedda.instructions to communicRte them formally to the uaudi Government for their concurrence, as soon as His Excellency had expressed hia personal agreement with the terms employed in the drafts. 3. 1 now enclose the drafts of two notes from yourself to the Saudi Minister of Foreign Affairs, which have been approved by His Majesty’s Government. It had been hoped that the drafts would have been completed by the morning of 23rd July in order that they might be taken out to Bahrain personally by the Political .-gent, who left that day by air on his return journey to the Pereian Gulf, for the formal concurrence of the Government of Bahrain to be obtained. Unfortunately a difficulty arose at the last moment over the use in the letter from the Bahrain to the Saudi delegation (which forms the basis of the agreement) of the words transhipped at sea*. This expression, I am advised, night be interpreted as implying a claim on the part of the Government of Bahrain to levy dues on the high seas, and its appearance in any agreement concluded under the auspices of His Majesty’s Government might have embarrassing consequences in view of the stand which His Majesty’s Government are taking, as against certain other Governments, in maintaining that no jurisdiction can be exercised outside the limits of territorial waters. It was accordingly proposed to replace the words transhipped at sea* by the words ”transhipped vithin Bahrain territorial waters”. The Political Agent at Bahrain, who was consulted in the matter, explained thf t owing to the excessive shallowness of the water in this part of the Persian Gulf steamers calling at Bahrain and landing or trans-shipping goods there are in fact often obliged to anchor more than three miles (and occasionally asColonel Loch was emphatic far as 16 miles) from the shore* that the distance of vessels from the shore had never been taken into consideration in collecting dues on cargo tranc-shippcd at Bahrain, and that the right of the Government of Bahrain to exercise territorial sovereignty within the whole of the extensive area of the buoyed anchorage off the port of Manaaah had never been challenged. He feared that if the exchange of notes contained any reference to territorial waters it would give rise to a most difficult situation at Bahrain as local merchants might well endeavour to contend that 'territorial 'waters” meant a limit of three miles and Importers in consequence seek to evade the dues hy trans-shipping goods just outside that limit* 4* It was not &gt;o®sible to find a solution ox this difficulty before the departure of Colonel Loch, but it was arranged that he should take out to Bahrain copies of the draft notes as originally p*i$&gt;ered in the Foreign Office, and that as soon as the final wording had been decided the India Office should instruct hia by telegraph to make the necessary alterations in the drafts with a view to their early submission to the Government of Bahrain* 6. After further discussion with representatives of the India Office on 23rd July agreement was reached that the beet solution would be to use the words 'transhipped without being 'landed', and I enclose for your information a copy of a telegram which was subsequently despatched by the Secretary of State for India to the Political President in the Persian Gulf on this point. It was also agreed that if the question of the extent of the territorial waters of Bahrain were to be raised at any time it might be possible to defend Bahrain’s claim to s limit well outside the normal three mile limit, (at the l 8 £\St» e e •lefiBt in the vicinity of the port of Manamnh) on the ground of prescription and ueege. 6. Provided Colonel Loch sees no objection to the new form of wording he will now endeavour to obtain the concurrence of the Government of Bahrain in the terms of the draft notes. As soon as this ia forthcoming the drafts will be communicated to Fuad Bey Hrjaza in accordance with the arrangements referred to in paragraph 2 above, and I hope then to be in a position to authorise you at an early date to communicate them officially to the Saudi Govemnent. Paragraphs 5, 4 and 5 above are, of course, for your own confidential information only. I am, with great truth, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (For the Secretary of State) (SO.) J. c.

In deference to this objection Foreign Office agree to withdraw words 'within Bahrein territorial waters' but explained that it was out of the question, for legal reasons, to use in this connection, in an official Note communicated to a Foreign Government by His Majesty's Government, the unqualified phrase 'at sea'. 3.

This in our draft is stated to be 1 and three-quarters ad valorem whereas Yusuf Yasin states that at conference 1 and seven-eighths ad valorem was fixed. Hamid Sulaiman and Khalid Valid confirm this. Although latter figure w r as of course less favourable Saudi Government he drew attention to what might be error in our draft. (in this connection please see Bahrain telegram 57 April 5th). 3. Second point concerned paragraph 7. Yusuf lasin enquired whether Saudi Arab Government ^ ^crr reconsidering the arrangements implied Saudi Arab Government was bound to import goods via Bahrain § agreement. If so Saudi Government could not agree. He added however that from terms 'Ahmadi' draft note he judged Saudi Government were not so bound and if that interpretation were correct he would propose to add to paragraph 7 following clause: 'it being understood that Saudi Arab Government and • ' /theirmmttmm / 2. their subjects are free to import goods to coast of tiaudi Arab t)y wa y Q f Persian Gulf via Bahrain and its ports, or by another way”• 4.

This suggestion was adopted mainly with a view to expediting, in the interests of the Saudi Government themselves, the formal conclusion of the matter. In view of the foregoing facts, I can only regard the attitude which Fuad Bey, according to M.Zada’s letter, has adopted as most disappointir^f if not actually discourteous.

I explained that His Majesty 1 s Government had been in communication with the Sa’udi Arab Government and that the latter now proposed to send a representative to Bahrain to discuss these matters. I said that they wanted to discuss (a) shipments to the mainland, (b) transit dues, and that they would like to do so towards the end of February, that is to say in a month’s time. The Shaikh said he had no objection but at once pointed out that had it not been for the pressure exercised by His Majesty’s Government, Bahrain would have enjoyed 2i% instead of 2$ for many years. 2. Shaikh ’Abdullah came at the beginning of the discussion and remained. 3. I pointed out that if it was merely a question of one2 S.NoslS. S.No:i3.

They mentioned that a pier was now being blj • ^ r ~ T 1 Akhbar, which was not a deep water place and also the point was taken that Bin Sa f ud might die and then the position would be very different.

On the 2nd March 1935 I discussed with Shaikh Hamad the question of the Shipping and Transit b ues# He thought that his representatives should be Shaikh ’Abdullah and Shaikh Salman and said that any of them, including Shaikh Muhammad, would be ready to act as representatives. He asked me what the idea of His Majesty’s Government was and I said that Government’s attitude was that on the one hand they did not wish Bahrain to lose but on the other hand they feared that B^ Sa’ud might make an harbour at Has Tanurah. I said that as a matter of tactics it would be a good thing to start off with the n Ahmedi n case and claim at first that it was within Bahrain rights and then subsequently to agree that in the interests of friendship it would not be done again, secondly that some goods might be passed free for the Ruler and, thirdly, if necessary some small reduction might be made in the Transit Dues. I said that one point that we had to bear in mind was ‘that the Arab Press and that if an agreement could be reached on that basis it w r ould look well in the press as an agreement between two &amp;rab Rulers. 2. Fairly early in the talk Shaikh ’Abdullah came in and took part in the discussion. Shaikh Hamad wisely said that he did not think that the Sa’udi representatives would be content with a small abatement of the transit dues, such as l/8th or l/4th but would demand a reduction to 1$.SMknfch*... mam Shaikh f Abdullah was, however, confident that they would not make a port at Has Tanurah because of the difficulty of getting stuff away from there and thought that they would agree to a substantial reduction. It was decided that the representatives of both sides should meet at the Agency and that I should welcome t.aem and suggest that they should discuss matters together. 4. I am arranging to be kept informed of the proceedings daily. 5. At one point I mentioned that a certain argument for use with the delegates was that Bahrain charged no nort dues, which were included in the customs duty, and that other ports charged port dues even if they did not charge transhipment dues. 6. The Shaikh said that the point to be urged with the delegates was tnat in the past the transit dues had been 5% in the time of the Turks and had been reduced to 2% for Bin Sa»ud for many years and that they had not increased itbeyond the 2%. I think that it would be well before the discussions start to warn the Bahrain representatives not to tie themselves up in any definite promise. Dictated on 2-3-1935. S.No:36.

Both Sulaiman (Deputy Financial Secretary) and his brother ’Abdullah (Financial Secretary) were working in Bahrain as dallals for Najd products but used to deal chiefly in ’Na’als’. About the year 1917 they became heavily indebted in Bahrain that they had to leave the place for Riyadh where they were employed as clerks. They are still indebted to Hajji ’Abdun Nabi Bushiri for about Rs.1500/- and to the owner of the shop in which they were living for Rs.i20/-.

File? n % i /t &gt; &gt; 4 - On the morning of the 11th March 1935 Shaikhs Muhammad and Salman brought the three Sa’udi representatives and also Muhammad al Tawwil to see me. The call was very brief and of the nature of a courtesy. Khalid al Qarqani asked ♦ if I would arrange for a meeting and I sai that I am very glad to welcome you here and hope that you and the representatives of His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad bin ’Isa, Shaikh ’Abdullah bin »Isa and Shaikh Salman bin Hamad, will discuss the questions of shipments to the mainland and of the transit dues and that if God is willing you will reach a suitable agreement.I emphasised that I hoped that they and the representatives of His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad would be able to come to a suitable agreement• The p arty left and I understand that they had some discussion after which Shaikhs 'Abdullah and Salman came back to see me with the Adviser. They said that the Sa'udi representatives had no instructions and had been told that they would know everything at Bahrain. They had been told only that the Sa'udi Government had sent their demands to uondon and that they were to get the Answer of the Bahrain Government. They said that the whole thing had been arranged by His Majesty 1 s Government. I said that I had had telegrams up to the very date of their arrival of the delegates and that there had been no detailed demands by the Sa'udi Government. I also said that it was not true to say that this matter was arranged by fch Hi s Majesty’s Government. In the first instance it had been ^in Sa’ud who had complained about the 'Ahmedi' and the only part played by His Majesty's Government was to try to bring the tw r o parties concerned together. •3. After some discussion it was decided that they would see the b a » udi representatives again and should say that no detailed demands had been put forward by the Sa’udi Government, that the idea was that they should discuss shipments to the mainland and transit dues and that it was for them to explain what they asked for. It was also arranged that they should, if the situation demanded it, expiain that if it was a question of arranging for shipments for the King's own use that they would consider it in a friendly way. 4. The result of this interview is contained in telegram No:47 dated the 12th ^arch 1935. Dictated on 12-3-1935.On the 19th March 1935 &amp; meeting was held between the Political Resident, the Political Agent, Assistant Political Agent, the Adviser to the Bahrain Government and Mr. de Grenier, to discuss two points which the Sa f udi representatives had raised, i.e., (a) that manifests should be issued to all craft going to Sa’udi Arabian ports, and (b) that the same duty should be levied on Hasawi dates as is levied on Basrah dates. £. There was considerable discussion about the question of manifests, as the request, although perfectly reasonable in the face of it, had many implications. For instance, if we send manifests to Sa T udi ports we might be asked to send them to Persian ports and so may gradually work us into a kind of 'Kuwait blockade position'. It was, , however, appreciated that the request would be a very difficult one to refuse as all countries issue manifests and it would be unwise to produce any argument for not doing sowhich would stand the light of day. Finally, it was decided that we should agree to the proposal on a basis of reciprocity. It was also decided that it would be prefer able for the Bahrain Government to bear the cost because it is not desirable to do anything which might harm local shipping and perhaps make them seek other ports. The rates charged for Basrah and Hasawi dates were fixed about 10 years ago on a basis of the prices then ruling. The ap arently higher charge on Hasawi dates are due to the fact that the Hasa maund is different from the Basrah maund, but in actual practice Hasawi dates are charged slightly less than the Basrah dates. 3. It was decided that Mr. de G ren i er should attend a meeting of the Representatives as an 'Expert Adviser' to the Bahrain Representatives and explain the position to the ■Sa'udi representatives, who doubtless do not know the actual position.
