During the course of our visit to the Quarantine Station on Sunday June the 28th it appeared to me that there were various matters requiring the immediate attention of the Bahrain Government. The electrical wiring of the premises and the installation of lights and fans is essential. There is no reasonable wash house accomodation for second and third class passengers and no adequate cook house for second class passengers. The floors of the permanent buildings are made of dust and proper concrete floors should be provided. There is no method of fumigating or disinfecting the belongings of inmates. There are no semi-permanent fixtures kept ready for patients such as. bed frames, bed pans and commodes. I shall be greteful for your views on these points and also I shaJl be grateful if you would add any suggestions that you may have to make as the Medical Officor-in-Charge.

No. The 19th December 1937. Dear Belgrave, &amp;S' A I have had a reply at last from Dr. Holland. He h^d been in hospital with fever and that is why I had not hea^d from him before. 2. He tells me that it will not be easy to get the type of doctor that we want here. They themselves get some of the best men, but then in their case there is the missionary urge which is missing in the case of Bahrain. This urge, must therefore, be replaced by very attractive terms if a really good man is to be found. Dr. Holland himself suggests that the best method would be to advertise in the and the LANCET, giving the fullest possible particulars about Pay, Leave and Pension (if any); and applicants should be vetted by some one at home. It is at least confori^ing*to know that this corresponds exactly with the method v/hich you f had proposed to adopt. I do not imagine that you have had time during the last week to draft an advertisement but,;I expect you will be doing so shortly. » 3.

Dated Simla, the 26th June 1940. MEMORANDUM The increased risk of the introauction of yellow fewer into India by the traversing of yellow fever areas on the new air route between the United Kingdom and India has been the subject of consideration by the Government of India. The recently published India Aircraft (Public Health) Rules, 1940, prohibit the entry into British India of any aircraft which has on board a person who within nine days of arrival in India has been in a yellow fever infected area unless (i) the person has been protected against the disease by satisfactory inoculation within the preceding two years or by a previous att ck of the disease, or (ii) the person has only alighted in a yellow fever infected a~ea at a non-infected anti-amaryi aerodrome. Note 1. Satisfactory inoculation under the orders of the Govern ment of India means inoculation not less than 21 days before first arrival in a yellow fever area. Note 2. Exemption (ii) will not be effective in the case of the Empire service and may be ignored. 2. In order that they may not be delayed on their return, official passengers who go to the United Kingdom from India on short terms of duty and are returning by air should if possible have themselves inoculated against yellow fever at the Wellcome Institution, Euston Road, London, at least 21 days before they are likely to arrive in a yellow fever area. Passengers who are inoculated or have not been inoculated 21 days before arriving in a yellow fever area .&lt;ill ordinarily be required to break their journey to India in the Sudan or Egypt or at some other place en route after leaving the yellow fever area in order that they may not arrive in India before the eaipiry of nine days from the date on which they left the yellow fever area. In special emer gent cases a passenger who has not been inoculated 21 days before 1irst alighting in a yellow iever area may be brought on direct to India with the previous approval of the Government of India tut all such passengers will be required to remain underobservation in the isolation hospital at Karachi Air Port until the expiry ol a period of nine days from the date on which they left the yello/ fever area*. As the transit time 1 rom the nearest yello.i/ fevtr area in Africa is likely to be fi/e days, such passengers will have to spend four days in the isolation hospital at Karachi. A^hen later the transit time is reduced the period of observation will be consequently ext ended. ( Sd . ' . A. D.

Ibn Saud has learnt that authorities in Bahrain have made it compulsory for all persons entering Bahrain to produce certificate of recent vaccination. In view of lack of doctors and serum in Nejd it Is virtually impossible for Saudi Arabian travellers to comply with this regulation. The King would therefore be most grateful if a concession could be made whereby such travellers may be vaccinated on arrival at Bahrain. 3.

The State Medical Officer writes 'I understand that it will not be easy to check up on every traveller entering Bahrain. Again there is a certain risk in allowing unvaccinated people to enter Bahrain who have perhaps been in recent contact with Small-pox. Dr. Steele presumably would receive the greater bulk of people for vaccination, and he would be more knowledgable of every person’s arrival. I suggest that 50 tubes of vaccine be supplied to Saudi Arabia, that is to the nearest big town or to the nearest port of embarkation to Bahrain. TheiB'is surplus fresh stock here, which can be sent immediately. It would vaccine 5,000 persons. After the next three months there would be no further need for these extra restrictions, and people could safely be vaccinated in Bahrain.” S.ZTelegram Q.

Memorandum:- Reference your 2202-2/7A dated 6th November 1941, is it suggested by Dr. Steele that the Bahrain Government should cease public vaccina tion or does he mean that vaccination of people entering Bahrain from Saudi-Arabia is no longer necessary? I discussed the matter with the State Medical Officer and I agree with his opinion that it is to the advantage of the public that vaccination should continue. We have a large supply of vaccine and if this is not used it will deteriorate. The people are now being vaccinated free in large numbers at the Government dispensaries and I think in any case the more people are vaccinated the better. o Adviser to the GovernmentNo. 2392 - 2/7-A Political Agency, Bahmin, the 6th December 1941 To The Adviser to the Bahrain Government B A H H A I N Memorandum Reference your memorandum No. 2208/10 dated the 17th November, 1941. 2. ir. Steele considers that smallpox no longer exists in epidemic form in Bahrain and that special quarantine res trictions which were imposed for the duration of the epidemic might now be dispensed with, namely 2 (a) Restriction regarding certificate of recent vaccination for all entrants into Bahrain; (b) Restriction regarding a similar certificate for all persons leaving Bahrain. 3. With regard to (a) above, Dr. Steele is of the opinion that Saudi Arab subjects u nprotected against smallnox can be vaccinated on landing at Bahrain and suitable steps could be taken with the assistance of the Passport Officer to ensure this. 4. As regards (b) above, he explains it would be no longer necessary to insist on all persons leaving Bahrain producing a certificate of vaccination within 3 years, that a certificate showing vaccination within five years would suffice. 5. If the Bahrain Government agree, will you kindly take necessary steps to notify the public with regal'd to removal of special quarantine restrictions.

Areas vaccinated have been chiefly Manama and Muharraq towns. Other places have been Suk Al Khamis, both Rifa’as, Sitra, Badaiya, Sakhir etc: £ Special communities have been compulsorily vaccinated (a) All Govt: Schools. (b) All Govt: Office personnel. (c) All Barbers, Bakers, &amp; Coffee Shop Owners, &amp; people entering or leaving the island. (d) Police and Defence personnel. About 12 special campaigns through certain of the worst ^anama districts have been carried out when doctors in person, sometime up to 6 at a time, visited from house to house. A Quarantine centre on Moharraq island has been brought up to date, and is run extremely efficiently smoothly by Dr.Steele. It may be mentioned that without this centre our efforts would have been useless. As far as possible all cases reported with their families, have been transported then, and give* free facilities with food. It has been kept busy the whole time. Comments . The Medical Departments have gone as far as they can to eradicate smallpox. Any further progress will now have to come from the people themselves, and if certain houses, certain communities and villages, would voluntarily come for vaccination, it would help a great deal. One village completely refused vaccination. The other point is, because so much smallpox has been exposed and treated it seems on the increase. Actually this epidemic has not been worse than most years, as in the past smallpox cases were concealed, and died frequently without people knowing. It is a good sign that most people realise its danger now, and are coming forward more for vaccination. measures have been The following results have been STATE MEDICAL OFFICER K k U* - &amp; * c*. .copy tfli? ® ^ r ihe amount of t je bill umst be paid in caeh by meenfe of 1RT1R or postal m 'ney order)* Pavment by means of cheques on Banks other tftan the Imperial Bank of India at places where there is no branch of this Bank should include exahange commissi on.
