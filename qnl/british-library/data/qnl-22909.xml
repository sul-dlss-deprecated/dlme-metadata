SAUDI ARABIA MONTHLY ECONOMIC REPORT January/February 1948. (extracts) 24. The arrangement whereby Messrs. Aramco were obliged to purchase rivals for local expenditure from a private group headed by the Minister of Finance at a fixed rate of 30 U.S. cents a rival has come to an end. Messrs. Aramco are now free to sell dollars in the open market at a rate approximately 25 cents a riyal. It is reported that Messrs. Aramco have also purchased rivals on the free market in Bahrein. 25. Mr. Galambos informed the Commercial Secretary that in his opinion Messrs. Aramco’s aggregate local expenditure exclusive of Oil Royalties now approximates to ^1,000,000 a month. The highest figure so far admitted by the Company is only #360,000 a month. He quoted the incredible figure of # 100,000,000 for Saudi Arabia's dollar earnings in 1948. Since Messrs. Aramco's royalty payments and local expenditure will total less than # 35,000,000, on the highest reckoning in 1948, it is difficult to understand the basis of this figure (of # 100,000,000). It undoubtedly includes large prospective disbursements by Messrs. Bechtel and Messrs, the Trans-Arabian Pipeline Company. On the other hand Mir. Galambos is well informed in these matters and not usually given to exaggeration. 31. The Arabian American Oil Company now employs approximately 3,000 U.S. citizens, 1,200 Italians from Eritrea, 800 Indians, and a conjectured total of 12,000 Arab employees. 34. ' The extent to which American interests in Saudi Arabia are prepared to invite British supplies and assistance provides a remarkable contrast with their former self-sufficient attitude. The Jedda manager of Ivlessrs. Aramco has even ififormed the Comrercial S cretary that Ms firm feels itself to be in honour bound to pay dollars to British suppliers and contractors, in consideration of the fact that Messr.'-. Aramco ar&lt; receiving dollars for the sale ef oil to the United Kingdom. 35. Sir Hugh Meightman, CSI, CIE, formerly Foreign Secretary of the Government of India, has arrived in Jedda on the business of Messrs. Trinidad Leaseholds acting in association with some as yet undisclosed American interests. His purpose is to negotiate the surrender of some part of Messrs. Aramco's present concession - under the terms of their original concession that Company may be called Upon, ten years after the date of their concession (1933), to surrender any part of their concession which they are not then exploiting - to his Principals. It is understood that Messrs. The American Independent Oil Company, a Company floated largely on the initiative of Messrs. The Philips jlgtroleum Company, with a capital of # 100,000,000, also have designs on Messrs. Aramco's concession and upon the Neptral Zone between Kuwait and Saudi Aralia. It is difficult to assess the chances for such revolutionary innovations as these at the present time.V (Extract from ^Rcvu© of Middls East Prass 1 * issued Ey JlBulEj British Middle East Office, Cairo). W 30. Developments in the Hedjaz ) In an interview published by A1 Mokattam, Shaikh Abdalla El Solirnan Finance Minister in the Saudi Arabian Government, made some interesting disclosures on developments in his country. By virture of the agreement with the American company, the Saudi Arabian Government has to receive 4 sh.Cgold for every ton of oil extracted. The agreement did not clearly regulate the problem of the differ ence invalue between the gold pound at New York (c dollars 24 cents) and at Jeddah (16 dollars)...(Then follows details of the dispute between the Government and the oil company)... the company agreed to pay the impot in English gold pounds on the basis of 12 dollars to the gold sovereign, with provision for changing this rate should there be any change in gold values. During the last quarter of last year, oil production averaged 300, 000 barrels a day, or about 46,154 tons. The profit to the Government is about 10,000 gold pounds daily. Production is rapidly increasing and in 1950 it is planned to reach 700,000 barrels daily after the installation o_f the pipelines The Minister added that prospecting carried out up tonow gave hopes that oil existed in other areas of Saudi Arabia, but not in the northerr or central parts of the Hedjaz. questioned on the region called El Rab el Khali, the Minister replfed that there were possibilities of the existence of oil there, but pros pecting had not yet begun. In any case, this was a rich area frorn^ the archaeological point of view, and new discoveries might be made in the future. The Minister continued by stating that talks with a foreign company about the establishment of a cement factory in tne LI Zahr^iie region, had reached agreement in principle. A new Saudi/Arabian company would r be formed in which the Arabians would own 46$ of the capital - to be increased to 51$ after two years. It was hoped to reach final agree ment shortly. Cement could be manufactured to a greater or less degree all over Arabia but the El Zahrane region was particularly suitable for it^Manufacture. Speaking next of communications, the Minister said tnat the railway linking El Zahrane to El Ehsaa and Riad would be finished about 1950. At the moment the completion of the construction and fitting out of El Damam port was receiving particular attention. The. bay, 10 Kms wide, will be able to shelter the largest vessels. Finally he mentioned that traffic through El Zahrane airport had increased considerably since the war.

The transarabian Pipeline Corporation has just finished the first mile of the pipeline from the Saudi Arabian field to the Mediterranean - a distance of 1,075 miles. Mr. Hull, President of the Tapline stated that ' construction would progress in future at the rate of one mile a day. About 40 miles of 30 in pipes and 40 miles of 31 in pipes and 40 miles of 30 inch pipes have been discharged at Has Miskah, the company^ new port on the Persain Gulf.

The Saudi Arabian Government has decided to create a National Bank at Jeddah, working under governmental control. A large building in course of construction will the offices of the new bank. ‘ (Commerce du Levant, 10 April '483 (La Revue d*Egypte Economique et Fiananciere ) 39. The Oilfields of Dhahran. (extracts from an article by H.St. J.B. Philby). The town of Dhahran has grov;n out of all recognition during recent years, though the world-wide shortage of build ing materials has slowed dov/n the development and necessitated the use of temporary wooden house made on the spot, which for comfort and convenience compare favourably with the accommod ation available in many places J of much longer standing. This oil industry employs, directly or indirectly, some 3,000 Americans including women and children, and no fewer than 17,000 Arabs, for whom an expensive model town has been built, in which the original temporary accommodation is as rapidly as possible, being replaced by spacious and very xpip comfortable brick buildings, around an imposing mosque. At the present moment there are four groups of producing wells in the area of the Aramoo concession: located respectively at Abu Hadriya, Qatif, Dhahran itself, and Abqaia. The tot^l oil production of these four groups together is running at present at approximately 300,000 barrels a day, with every prospect of this production being doubled in the near future, when the great 32 inch steel pipeline is ready to carry the oil to the Mediterranean coast. The southern terminus of the pipeline will be at Abqaiq, i / whichwhich has the reputation of being one of the world's greatest oil reservoirs, and will have a potential output of some 300,000 barrels a day, which will in due course monopolise the full carrying capacity of the Mediterranean pipe-line: the remaining three groups sending their oil, as at present, to Has Tanura, to be carried the world over by tankers. It is said that the Burqan reservoir in Kuwait territory, and that of the Qatar peninsula, are in the same class as the Abqaia reservoir, and there can be little doubt that this Arabian field bids fair to become before very long one of the principal sources of the world's oil supply. The monster wireless station at Jidda is nearing completionj the Jidda water-supply scheme is in full operation; the power house for the supply of electricity to Riyadh for household and irrigational purposes is making rapid progress. Taif will soon have electric lighting; artesian wells are being drilled in many places; and good motor roads are eating up miles and miles of desert tracks. The starting point of the railway is to be the new port which is being constructed at Damman, about a dozen miles from Dhahran, where a causeway jutting out five miles or so into the sea will ultimately be a railhead alongside the spacious wharves at which the big ships will dock. This causeway still remains to be built; but the railway has been laid from the actual shorline to Dhahran (12 miles) on what will be a branch line, which has been laid from the fork for some five miles towards Abquiq, wdiile a further eight miles have been made ready to receive the sleepers and rails. It is expected that Abqaiq qill be reached by the end of the summer, while the material now. available on the spot is sufficient to carry the line on to at least half way between Abqaiq and the Hasa capital at Hufuf, from where the engineering problems involved will be relatively simplA in comparison with the heavy s?nd-dune country of the coastal tract. The Crown Prince and his party greatly enjoyed the experience of travelling from Dhahran to Damman in a train made up of three 380 HP Diesel engines, without untoward incident except that at one fck point the train had to be stopped for a few minutes while spades and shovels got to work to clear the track of an infant sand-dune.

Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie and Co., (Bahrain) Ltd., have confirmed that they are not yet in a position to under take import business on the East Coast of Saudi Arabia. Messrs. Mitchel Cotts (Sharqieh) Ltd.,'also have plans to exploit the market offered by the Americans resident in the oilfields, but display equal dilatoriness in carrying them out. In the meantime it is to be feared that both British firms will be forestalled by American and local enterprises. MINING AND OIL . 3. With reference to paragraph No.35 of this report for the months of January and February 1948, it is now known that Sir Hugh Weightman is acting on behalf of the Central Mining Company of London and the Superior Oil Company of Los, Angeles. These companies are not listed in the 1947 edition of the ’’Oil and Petroleum Yearbook”, and it is therefore presumed that they are of recent origin. His object is not, as was at first understood, to take over any part of the present concession of the Arabian American Oil Company, but to secure exploitation rights in the seabed outside Saudi Arabian territorial waters. A premature disclosure of Sir Hugh’s intentions, amounting to a breach of confidence, made by the Minister of Finance to the Arabian American Oil Company, appears to have evoked a very unfavourable reaction from that Company. The Minister, possibly annoyed by the Company's dog-in-the-man*ger attitude, has published the fact that the Company may now be called upon to surrender any unexploited portion of their present concession, as widely as his means permit./iPS ( o / J • . Copy of an extract of a letter No.82E 333/4/48, dated the 29th April, 1948, from His Majesty^ Ambassador, Jedda, to the Rt. Hobble Ernest Bevin, M.P., Foreign Office. XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX . XXX 4. The Minister of Finance has also stated publicly that the current daily rate of production of the Company is 46,165 tons, implying a rate of payment of royalty of £.9,233 gold daily. Upon the unlikely assumption that the daily rate of production will not increase in the course of the year, royalties for 1948 will total £.3,370,000 gold, worth approximately £.16,000,000 at current local exchange rates. Upon the minimum assumption that the Company will pay dollars instead of gold in respect of the whole years output, royal ties will total 0.40,000,000, plus an unknown total of arrears. This compares with an approximate total of 0.12,000,000 in 1946 and 0.19,000,000 in 1947. The rate of increase is startling, but does not indicate the true magnitude of Saudi Arabians foreign exchange resources in the near future. In addition to royalty payments, both the Arabian American Oil Company and the Trans Arabian Pipeline Company are committed to a heavy local expenditure upon capital projects involving further dollar outlay. The Saudi Arabian Government are consuming the 0.25,000 United States 'Line of Credit' granted in 1946 at a prodigious rate, and are reported by members of the staff of the United States Legation in Jedda to be seeking a further 'Line of Credit'. It is, moreover, by no means certain that the United States Government will in future refrain from selling gold to the Saudi Arabian Government at the United States Treasury price. A statement made some time ago by a member of the staff of the United States Legation in Jedda, to the effect that Saudi Arabian dollar earnings in 1948 may approach a total of 0.100,000,000, does not now appear to be as incredible as it did when first made. 5. It seems certain that the receipt of gold andforeign currencies upon this scale must produce a revolutionary impact upon local exchange rates and local price levels. The Arabian appetite for gold for hoarding purposes in great but not insatiable. Saudi Arabia is becoming a favoured market for purveyors of foodstuffs sold in disregard of allocations made by the International Emergency Food Committee, and the inducement offered to smuggling must injure internal supply arrangements in such adjacent British territories as Aden, the Sudan and Somaliland. Complaints of this kind have already been received from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Even more serious consequence* may follow upon Saudi Arabian attempts to purchase depreciated sterling with gold. On the other hand, if a close control can be impose.d upon such purchases a salutary fall in the local price of gold may result. In this connection it is of interest to observe that the Saudi Arabian Government has recently reinforced the ban upon the export of gold. XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX \ r v. * ET \ , 1 I_ I_N__U _T__E_S.
