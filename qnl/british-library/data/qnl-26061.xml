Bushire• 17th June, 1946. Kl i ' I have the honour to refer to my telegram No.101 dated the 17th June 1946, on the subject of the recent strike in the Etemadieh Mill, Bushire, and to enclose herewith translations of the final demands made by ths strikers, together with translations of an account of the meeting to c onsider such demands and the agreement finally reached at this meeting. 2. The strike commenced on 11th June when it was limited to the spinning section of the Mill. Since cessation of work in the spinning section automatically led to stoppage of work in the weaving section the virtual effect was that of a general strike. No prior notice was given tc the management and in fact the strikers at first had no leaders and no definite idoa of what they wanted. Certain d emands fca* increase of wages wore however soon forthcoming and though these were at once accepted by the management, local political agitators managed to persuade the strikers not to come to any settlement before the arrival of Tudeh leaders from Shir ax. In due course these arrived and presented the enclosed demands. A meeting to consider these demands was held at the Governor ate, Bushire, and as a result of the agreement reached (see enclosures) work was resumed today. 3. It is pertinent to point out that the majority of the workers did not at the outset wish to join the strikers who however .picketed routes leading to the mill and were successful in imposing their will on the other workers, who being unorganised were unwilling or unable to oppose the strikers. Even now, many workers are uncertain of the wisdom of their action, since even they cannot fail to see that the final outcome is likely to be bankruptcy of the mill and loss of their means of livelihood. The Managing Director, Mr. Agar, has throughout made no attempt to oppose the strikers and in fact, apart from accepting demands almost as soon as they were offered, his only overt act has been to tender his resignation as Managing Director. It is believed, however, that he hopes to control the future destiny of the mill from a safe distance, viz. Shiraz. It has been difficult to ascertain the reason for this attitude on the part of Mr. Agar, but apparently he places no reliance on getting any kind of support from the Persian Government and considers that refusal of the demands would lead to seizure of' the mill by the workers. No doubt the example of Isfahan was in his mind and since the mill here holds stocks of cotton sufficient for some months work, the strikers could well have operated the mill without any capital. 4. It Is yet too early to say what exactly will be the effect of the new agreement. Undoubtedly there will be some considerable loss in efficiency and economy but the main effect will be financial. Rough estimates of the extra amount to be given In wages vary from 9 to 15 million rials per year, while Mr. Agar claims ‘that wages alone will represent 7 rials per metre of cloth produced which at present can only be sold at to 10 rials per metre. If this is correct/correct, it is quite clear that the mill will run at a loss. Until the stocks of cotton give out, i.e. for 4 to 6 months, there should be no actual loss in cash but after this period it is doubtful ^—whether the Directors will agree to purchase further cotton and the mill must then stop. 5. Mr. Arar informs me that 25$ of the shares in the Company are held by himself ( a naturalised British subject having dual Persian- Knglish nationality), his son, who is a British subject by birth, and a British firm doing business in Manchester. British business interests are therefore to a certain axtent involved, but since the mill has paid out something like 500$ in dividenta since the commencement of the war, the shareholders have no real cause for grief. 6. Undeniably the immediate effect of the strike is to enhance the power of the Tudeh Party but should the mill eventually stop work and provided the workers realise exactly why work has stopped, the final outcome might well be against the interests oi the party. It is rumoured that the success achieved in Bushire will be usea to promote strikes in Shiraz and Bandar Abbas mills. 7. I am sending copies of this despatch (with enclosures) to Consuls, Shiraz and Kerman (for Bandar Abbas). I have the honour to be. Sir, Your Excellency’s most obedient Servant, (Sgd.) G.I.

Sir ^ I have tho honour to refer to your Circular No.77 (1160/2/43) of the 12th September, 1943, a copy of which has just reached me, and to forward the following information. 6th Ustan, omitting Khorramshahr and Abadan, *iich fall within the district of H.M.ConBul Khorramshahr, is roughly as under The basic wage rate for ordinary unskilled labour Is 40 to 50 Rials per day| the Anglo-Ir&amp;aian Oil Company and the Allied Military i orces pay 14 Rials per day plus a ration of flour, sugar and tea per month# Working hours are on an average eight hours per day six days par week. Overtime of two ho^irs per day is common and Is paid fora t the same rate as ordinary woik Ing hours. At present there are said to be between three and four thousand unemployed in Ahwaz, due to laying off of labour by the Allied Military Forces. At the same time, the Anglo- Irani&amp;n Oil Company in Abadan are short of about the same number of labourers. The Arab, however, prefers to sit at home if he possibly can, rather than go elsewhere for employment. Necessity probably in due course gradually force this labour to go to Abadan to take up employment. It can thus be said that there is no real permanent unemployment in Khuzistan. Migra tions of labour, however, within the province result in voluntary transitional unemployment such as that described above and in a labour turnover unheard of in most other countries. Except for the Hizb-i-Xargaran, whose aims appear to be primarily political, as evidenced by Its spread in an agricultural area liice Behfceh&amp;n and its small headway in Ahwaz and amoniT the employees of the Iranian State Railways there and at Dorud, there are no labour organisations. Among the railway workers at Dorud the Tudeh party has gained a certain number of followers. This party, however, can hardly be called a labour organisation. Most of the labour employed is unskilled, and has no bargaining power. Consequently industrial disputes do not at present exist. Some social and industrial legislation has been enacted by the Persian Government but, like many other laws in this country, is not properly enforced. 2 At present the state of employment of labour in the Anglo-Iranian oil Company Iranian State Railway Allied Military Forces 18900 6000 16000 /* • •. •-3- 3. As long as Allied Military Forces remain in the country and Aid-to-Russia material continues to go up the road and railway, the labour situation is unlikely to undergo much change• When Aid-to-Russia ceases and the Allied troops leave, an acute unemployment problem will arise. It has been estimated by a competent observer that in the whole Uatan ^ipprd^imately 5C,00G labourers will be thrown out of work. Somaof them will probably be people who have come from other parts of Persia. The problem of re-absorbing discharged labour* Into tne agricultural life of the country is one which Is likely to tax the capacity of the Persian Government to the utmost. At present there are few signs of any planning to meet the emergency, and it seems unlikely that anything will bo done until the crisis arises or that, mce it has arisen, the Persian authorities will be able r,o cope with It success fully. 1. Persia is primarily an agricultura3. country and indus trial labour problems are of small importance compared with the more vital ones of the relations between landlord and peasant and the extent of Government control over the selfish land profiteering merchant class. Relations between agricu ltural labour and the landlords are still semi-feudal. The peasantry on the whole reside in a particular area for genera tions unless compelled to move by so'uo unusual event, and are largely dependent on tine landlords. Agricultural labour is paid for by receiving a proportion of the grain grown and is thus not as conscious of economic incentive as wage-earning agricultural laboutp in other countries would be. How far the rise in the cost of living and tna scarcity of essential commodities such as cloth, tea and. sugar, combined with the callousness displayed by the landlords and ruling classes to the sufferings of the poor, will affect the present apat?ay and resignation of the peasantry it Is difficult to say. Soma awakening may take place but the peasants have been ground down for so many years that I doubt if they are likely to be able to make their discontent felt unless the country fells into a state of general anarchy. The increase of malaria Is a real danger to the agricultural life of the country. Agricultural labour is already scarce and unless the inroads now being made on the life of the agricultural community by the malaria mosquito can be checked, Persia will gradually become more and more a land of deserts and abandoned villages.

A 1 whole of the Province of Mukran is not an industrial area. Con sequently there are no industrialists in the Province and trade unions do not exist in any form. 2. Baluchi tribesmen who form the bulk of the population lead a semi-nomadic life and only a small proportion are settled in villages in areas where cultivable land and water are to be found. The agricultural land is mostly owned by tribal chiefs and sub chiefs. Their tribesmen till the soil and collect the harvest and they receive a share of the produce for their work. There are no professional labourers in these tribal areas. 3. The number of the labouring class in and about Zahldan is small and members of this class earn their living by domestic service or are employed by traders. Wages vary ana fluctuate according to supply and demand and there is no labour union in the Province to look after their interests. 4. A greater part of the Province of Mukran is a barren sandy waste and there is no likelihood of any industry being established in it in the near future unless oil or minerals in sufficient quantities to make exploitation worth while, are discovered. Any improvement in the working conditions and social status of the labouring class and peasantry can therefore only be brought about by influence from outside the Province. I have the honour to be.

Sir, British Consulate, BAITDAR ABBAS, 25th June, 1944. I dated to on No. and ou r 01rcu Jnr dcspa t ch the subject of labour countries, district is concerned the Industrial conditions is very few industrial ecnc rns such as have the honour to refer the 12th September, 1943, development of industries in foreig In so far os this Consulate scope and material for the study of limited as, with the exception of a the Fish Canning Factory, the Khonji Cotton Spinning hill, the local Electric lower Company in Bandar bbos town and the Red Oxide mines at Hormuz, there are no trades which foil outside the definition of home ind cottage industries. As regards social and industrial legislation these concerns are no dovbt supposed to conform to the existing legislation of the country but in both the fact cries the terms of such control are very loosely interpreted and can for all practical purposes be termed as non-existant. Labour, with the exception of a few tech nicians in both factories, is local and proceeds daily from the sur rounding villages to tho scene of employment. Factory uplift and social amelioration do not exist, although the Fish Canning Factory is contemplating providing accommodation and facilities such as drinking water, baths and essential clothing to their employees with the hope of persuading them to reside closer to the factory and not to have to wall:, sometimes as much as five to eight miles each way, to reach their employment, thus reducing their effective working capacity. There are no forms of workers * unions nor methods whereby the employees con redress their legitimate griev ances against the mplcyeri The employment, control and dismissal of labour is without any reservation at the disc-ration and whim of the management. In winter no trouble is experienced in ob taining sufficient labour, but in summer the fhonji I, ill has some difficulty in meeting its demand, as a very high percentage of V'int r industrial laboue turn agricultural and reek employment in* gathering of the date crop in the Minab area. The Fish Canning Factory closes during tie ummer months. The present scale of wages for unskilled labour is from 14—20 rials per diem with a possible increase of 1QA during the period of the date season. 3erai-skilled labour fetches from rials 30-60 a day. rising in the case of technically experienced (althoug] unqualified; labour to rials 150 per day. Both factories employ an eight hour v/orking day, six days a week which doss not appear to have been challenged by the workers. There is lit life comment on the organisation or development of industry in this area and Government officials not directly connected show neither enthusiasm nor interest in any off. the factories and information as regards the probabilities of future action even in the domestic sphere is not forthcoming. Other labor, apart from industrial, is employed in the usual commitments f$und in a town and port of the size of Bandar Abbas while labour for agricultural purposes is specifically em ployed for the harvesting of the date crop, for which there is a large-scale migration from Bandar Abbas to the Minab district. Labour is also widely employed in the fishing trade and in the coastal traffic of native craft. In conclusion, labour in this ares is largely agricultural in the Hajiabad, Minab, Biaban and Jask districts, while in Bandar Abbas it is interchangeable and obtains whatever employment happens to be available, except as already stated during the period of the summer migration. There is at present liitle indication of, or desire for, any industrial social or -domestic development in this area, while the or misation of workers’ unions, now making a start in other parts of iersia, has not as yet percolated to the few in dustrial concerns in this area.

This has been noticed by all Persians and its latest development is the announcement of the Russian intention to open a branch of their Institute for Irano-3oviet relations in Isfahan# Up to the beginning of this year the Soviet Consulate was on more or less friendly terms with a number of Isfahanis of the upper class. How, with the rise of the Vatan party here andits opposition to the Tudeh the Soviet attitude has chan ^ e J ^ 0iie ul general dissatisfaction, openly expressed, and rather bitter complaint that the Isfahan! hates the Soviets. In recent months the Soviet Consul has shown himself extreroely touchy about alleged attacks made on the Soviet system by various people in Isfahan, usually of no great importance and some of them connected the Vatan party and in some cases has asked for removal froin Isfahan. The incident mentioned in my despatch No. 4. of ^prll 23rd, 194kju paragraph 6, has as yet reached no conclusion and the w 5 ersdhofwhom complaint was made is still here, but another and more recent request for the removal of a Persian mxVajir who had been turned out of Russia some years ago and had here attached himself to the Poles as a photographer f Ali Mahmoudi by narn ?» bas been met by the Governor-General and was I think a justifiable case. Frequent complaints are also made to the Persian authorities that the Soviet Consulate is being watched, often on what, as tola to me by the Persian side afterwards, seems most inadequate reasons. The Soviet Szribassy in Tehran, too, seems actively interested in Isfahan to the extent that the former Soviet Consul here, M. Rassadin, now on the staff of the Kmbassy, is reported as saying to some Persians in Tehran recently that, as regards the struggle now going on here between the Tudeh and Vatan parties what was wanted was a Governor-General with a sub-machine gun who would shoot a few dozen people here, presumably meaning the opponents of the Tudeh. 3. Among the Armenians Soviet activity is considerable and meets with no small success. From the time when s boviet representative first came to Isfahan in the summer of 1924-2, in an unofficial capacity, more attention has been paid to the Armenians than to the Moslems here. This indeed is natural for the home oi the Armenians and, what is more important, oi their church, lies in Soviet territory* Concert parties from Soviet Armenia, usually second-rate, have several times visited Isfahan, to the great joy | of the Armenians of Julfa and now, without doubt with Soviet encouragement, for other, ise it could not .happen at all, a represen-» tative has come here from the Stchmiadzin and will ■visit othjr Armenian communities in the world to discuss the election o^ a new catholicoa and a new archimandrite for Julfa \see my telegram No. 9 saving of June 12th, 1944 )• 4. I / Sir R. Bullard, K#C.B., K#G.M#G. , i British Embassy, Tehran.I think / 4. I am unable to say with any certainty how far the local activities of the Tudeh party are directed by the Soviet Consulate here, but it is likely that there is some underground connexion between the two. A few months ago, when the political atmosphere here became rather heavily charged, several Persians discussed the matter of the Tudeh party with the Soviet Consul and were told that the Soviet Consul was opposed to any attempt, from whatever quarter it might be, to upset order in Isfahan. It is probably that the Soviets while disapproving of disorder in ^ general terms, are prepared to close the eye to any activities of that sort in which the Tudeh party may indulge, provided they do not go beyond a certain limit. There is no doubt that the Tudeh party is working hard underground both in and outside Isfahan though it has suffered setbacks in both areas recently. As regards activities in the villages, I have within the last few days heard of two cases where villagers have refused to divide the groin crop, which is now ripe, with the landowner on the traditional system of two thirds to the owner end one-third to the villagers, on the ground that one third is not enough for their * share. 5. As regards the tribes there is also evidence of more than passing 3oviet interest in them. Some time ago the Soviet Consul mentioned to me that he had seen accusations in the Tehran press against Morteza ^uli Khan of exercising a 'dictatorship* in Bakhtiari and I have heard from others that the Soviets are not very favourably disposed towards him. I was told a fev; days ago by the son of Sarem-ed-Douleh that the Soviet Consul here had tried to persuade Sarem-ed-Douleh to intrigue against Morteza ]uli Khan, but that Sarem-ed-Douleh had refused. This may have been a tale for my benefit but on the other hand it fits in with the rest of the picture. According to Asghar Mirza, who is on fairly intimate terms with the Soviet Consulate the Soviets are opposed to all tribes because they represent the old feudal system and because the tribal leader’s control is more or less absolute in most coses. Morteza Quli Khan and the Bakhtiaris were particularly disliked because of their connexion with the British and because Morteza v uli Khan was backed by the Persian Government. I asked what was the Soviet view about the Qaflhqai and was told that they regarded them as being on bad terms with both their own government and with ours and therefore less of a menace from their point of view. This may or may not be true, but is interesting as perhaps showing Russian disapproval of any tendency for the Persian Oovernment, the tribes of south Persia and the British to unite. While I was in Tehran recently I was told by the Ha^i Ilkhsni Bekhtiari khans, who are opposing Morteza Quli Khan, that one of their supporters, Kha^eh Mehdi Quli of the Muguhi sub-tribe of the Chahar Lang Bakhtiari, had asked them for instructions because he had recently been approached several times by emissaries bf tbs ^udeh party from Sul tan t bad. ^The reason, unstated, of cours©, for Khajoh Mehdi ^uli’s desiring instructions 1 was that he is at enmity with Morteza Quli Khan and was contemplating dallying with the Tudeh as a possible means of protecting himself against Korteza Quli .Khan. But, nevertheless, the method adopted by the Tudeh, of lighting on discontented elements in an area and seeking to win them over, has been seen in and round Isfahan and in view of the remarks of Afcghar Mirza may show Russian interest in the Bakhtiari, but being'developed from the north instead of from Isfahan. Finally there is the reported intention of the Russian musician Knipper, who has been in Tehran and north Persia for some time, ox visiting Chaqakhor in Bakhtiari for the purpose of recording Bekhtiari folk music. No doubt his own intention may be of the most genuine but it will be interesting to hear of any other activities in which he or members of his party may indulge during their stay.. i1i rnay fairl y be that in Isfahan c-.nd its district the Russians are working very hard to extend their influence but not with any universal success - yet. Unfortunately the steady refusal of the governing and monied classes to adopt theroselves to modern ideas is doing the Russians* work for them among the lower classes, where lies the Russians* natural sphere of activity in social matters. Isfahan may be regarded as of great importance for the Russians because it is a big centre, lying on the edge of the so-called British zone of influence in Persia and is well placed for the carrying on of activities among mill- workers, villagers and tribesmen, koreover it lies freedom oTacUo'n?' 1 ' 000 ^ ^ thUS all0W8 gre0ter I have the honour to be, etc., (Signed) CHARLES A GAULT.

Sir, With th« Compliment* of th Under Sscretar for Foreign Affair* (&amp;L A* fxr lvt/*H}. }&amp;ji s.f&lt; 12 Q 1 '‘y - I am directed by Mr. Secretary Kden to trananiit herewith, for the consideration of the Minister of Labour and National Service, a copy of Tehran despatch No. 228 of the 26th May last, regarding the intention of the Persian Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Mines to draft legislation relating to certain labour questions. These include hours and conditions of work, insurance, trade unions, strikes, relations be tween factory owners and employees, benevolent funds, etc. 2. It will be observed that Sir Reder Bullard considers that there would be advantage in giving guidance to the Persian Government on this question, and that he asks to be supplied with material on the subject which may be communicated to the Persian authorities. 3. Mr. Kden agrees that it is in the interests of His Majesty’s Government that the Persian Government should draft their legislation on these questions on sound lines, and he would accordingly be grateful if the Ministry of Labour and National Service could furnish memoranda on the subjects referred to by Sir Reader Bullard, together with the names of any The Secretary, Ministry of Labour and National Se fr^oks/. 3ECu. kl ftspr. fA OFF! iiSfitboo^fe which, in the Minister of Labour and National Service 1 e opinion, the Persian authorities could usefully be given to study. 4. A copy of this letter is beinr sent to the India Office. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Slgnad) G. W. BAXTERC0££. (E 3366/1906/34) British Embassy# Tehran, No* 226(C/S•136/17/44) D O 1 ! 26th May,1944. Sir, I have been informed by Mr. Habibullah Naficy, one of the Directors of the Ministry of Commerce, Industry &amp; Mines, that this Ministry intends to draft legislauion relating to the following labour questions: hours and conditions of work, insurance, trade unions, strikes, relations between factory owners and employees, benevolent funds etc. Mr. Naficy has asked this Embassy to procure for him texts of existing legis lation in Great Britain and the Empire on these matters, which he intends to use as a model for the drafting of similar legislation in Persia. 2. As you will have seen from recent reports from this Embassy, there has been a considerable increase in labour activity in this country in the last few months, especially in the formation of trade unions and other activities designed by the workers to secure an improvement in working conditions, rates of pay, insurance, etc. Under this pressure the Government finds itself faced with the need to regulate by law the relations between the parties concerned, and Mr. Naficy has been entrusted with'the task of making the preliminary ' studies on which such legislation will be based. 3. A private deputy has introduced a bill for the protection of labour which is so far in advance of anything that could possibly be applied in this country (and even in advance, in many respects, of the regulations in force in the United Kingdom) that I have warned the Prime Minister against the danger of a doctrinaire approach to this difficult problem. The Prime Minister, I think, realises this danger, and he has promised that the private bill above-mentioned will not be accepted and that he will consult His Majesty’s Embassy when the time comes to draft the Government bill on the sub ject.Except for the carpet factories which had been set up even before the war of 1914 there were no factories in Persia until after the war. The despotic character of the late Shah, who had a personal interest in many of the factories, prevented the introduction of any legislation for the protection of the factory workers, whose condition was often pitiful. Ihe restrictive influence of Reza shah has now been removed, and on the other hand there has come into existence under Russian influence the Tudeh partv which has an advanced programme of social reform and is trying to organise all &lt; the factory workers under its aegis. The Persian Government realise that unless they introduce protective legislation A for the work people, there may be a devastating struggle betw en the employers, who are stupid and selfish, and the employees, who are conscious of their new-found power, but have no sense of proportion, and no experience cn which to rest proposals for an improvement of their lot. It is desirable to encourage the Persian Government to look towards His Majesty’s Government for a&lt;ivice on this subject, not only because we can perhaps approach 'th^ problem with a more practical spirit but also because if we leave it to others the resulting legislation ^ might include provisions which would hamper the work of the /Anglo- The Rt. Hon’Ble Anthony Eden, P.C**M*C.&gt;M.P., etc*,etc.,etc., The Foreign Office.Anglo-Iranian Oil Company considerably without doing any good to their employees. I am doubtful* however, whetaer copies of English laws (in the absence of a concise labour code) would be the best guide for the Persian Government, and I suggeit that it would be best to supply them with some book or books in which the provisions they wish to study ore summarised. This seems to be the more suitable in that the proteotion of labour in the United Kingdom rests to a large extent not on legislation but on collective bargaining. 4 . as conditions in India resemble those prevailing in Persia more closely than conditions in the United kingdom, I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Government of India, in the hope that they may be able to supply copies of regulations, or publications, which may be of use to the Persian Government. I have, etc.. (Sgd) R. Bullard.DA/. f~\ OOPY. No.10-10/23» British Residency &amp; Consulate- Gen eral f Bmhire, dated 3rd April, 1944.

Industrial development in this area has bcdri;dolifine^ to 3ushire where the Lteinadieh Gpinnins and Weaving Hill^has been established since 19156. Statistics of v/agts, working hours # numbers employed and general conditions are given below:- _ ^ (a) Working hours start at 6.20 a.u. and consist oi t:iree shiits u * B hours in the cotton and thread section, and two fOiirts of 9 hours each in the weaving section. (b) The numbers employed in the spinning and weaving section are at present 600 and 2C8 respectively and the following wages are given;- _ r Girls under 15 on the bobbing section. Rls. 10-13 per uay. Boys under 15 on the weaving section. Kls. 13-16 per day. Women employed on cotton. Rls. IT-19 per day. Wages for labour vary from Rials 17-35 per day, depending on the quali fications of the individual concerned* .’hose in weaving section are paid on piece work and may earn from Rials 10—00 per day. (c) No housing is given to the labour employed but free bread is issued, medical attendance is provided and working dress is also supplied. Conations are generally satisfactory judged by Persian s t andards. (d) * The mill is obtaining fresh machinery and will shortly i icreas the number of spindles. ’he old spinning machinery was imported from England, as also most of the power plant and the new engines to be installed are hirrlees Diesels. 2. regards conditions among the peasantry the aro*.falls in tc four natural categories:- (i) The northern districts of Liravi, Hiat Baud and Dashtistan are primarily occupied in agriculture and possess large flocks which are taken to the higher country inland for grazing in the spring and summer. Crops, except for those in the arettsouth west of badabad whicl are irrigated from the dhabankareh head works on the Shahpur river, are dependent on winter rains. In a good year, large quantities oi grain are produced. N.h. ;There are possibilities for installing a hydro electric plant at the Shabank&amp;reh dam). (ii) The areuof Tangistan which has always had a heterogeneous tribal population, turbulent and warring among themselves, is not particularly fertile nor are the date groves very productive, but the date gardens of ^hram and fruit.trees in the neighbourhood of hhaviz normally ensure a good income for their owners* (iii) Dashti again is a grain growing district which possesses comparatively extensive cultivation, in some parts, but full use is not made of the fund river which if properly utilised for irrigation purposes would probably result in a great increase in the arse.under cultivation. ^ . , ,, (iv) The Bandar-i-Salas, a comparatively snail area in whu.cn tner&lt; is very little agriculture and the inhabitants are mostly of Arab stock.- It is hard to comment on the social situation of -he peasantr; who for years past have seen subservient to the khans of their various districts, but in general terms it may be said that the conuitions are good to the North of lushire but the sane standard is not maintained in the southern districts. The ex-Chah did his utmost to end the regime of Chans in this area cut since his abdication, the old system is once lore coming into its own, and as far as car bp^een, this is welcomed by the peasan— try some of whom have bitter memories oi t ie iuterierence v/ith their rights shown by Government officials during his reign. The khans have now reverted to the old practice of collecting taxes on ohe lands they claim to own from the peasantry engaged in cult!vatfcdnn.r - ^ -d .1.

This, he complained, not only led to dishonesty among the workers, but also made it impossible to keep the factory fully supplied with labour. 11* In Tabriz, Bazvin aad lenjan, ilninjum wages were fixed in September and October last by 7r* Abal Qasim TiCikh, ' iieolor- *eneral of the Ministry of Commerce and Indaetry, at 15-16 Rials per day for men, 10 for women and 8 for children, plus free oread, charcoal and clothing. 12. hours of work are not controlled oy statute, but a limit of eight hours par day is becoming general. 13* Unemployment does not at present constitute a problsm in Persia* There is a distressingly large number of beggars, but the majority of these are unemployable and there Is plenty of aork on offer, more especially by the iolios force and the gendarmerie which,i at the existing low rates of pay, are unable to find the men to fill sup the 1 r ranks. 14* The prevention of accidents %und of industrial diseases in mm tn h: ve receive! little attention bo far, and even kazviru •. *% '1 i - 4 - Ka«Tln and Senjan, and notes on the aettlenentB toe nade at thefce places are attached* On the '30th Deoemtoer last there was a strike for higher wages at the Oovemnient munitions factory at ^altana’ta5ad when, as reported in my telegram ?^o. 34 of the ?th ^armory, General Ohafa’l, Mlniotei* of Commerce and Industry, Irew his revolver and killed one of the demonstrators* 16# ,T, he attitude of the factory owner a Jind of the officials of the liniet^ of Oommme and Industry Is of necessity slowly evolving in the direction of more generous treatment for workers.

Iranian Jinistry of Commerce &amp; Industry, after his recent tour of inspection of factories in Tabriz. C. ^ The Acting Governor-General has to lei me that the regulations have been accepted by all the local factory-owners and that they are already being put ink) operation, but that the workers are still not satisfied. 3• Whilst it is true that industrial conditions in this area left much to be desired and that war-time conditions had made radical changes imperative, it se -ms to me iliat Dr .Che ikh ’ s regulations go to the extreme and will place a very heavy burden on the emrloyers, if they are, in fact, ever properly implemented. Should the employerA find it impossible to carry out all the provisions of the regulations or attempt to find some means of circumventing them, the workers will have been presented with further grounds for agitation, not t has-been made clear whether these regulations arply only locally to Tabriz or whether they are in conformity with regulations applying to industry throughout Iran. If the former is the case, it se ms possible that, when they become known, workers in other parts of Iran may agitate for not less favourable conditions. 5• Certain clauses, in particular those referring to medical facilities, whilst feasible in large industrial concern® of gurcpe or America, are hardly so in Tabriz where the total number of industrial workers is only some 5000. flven were the factory owners to establish their individual clinics and their hospital, it is difficult to see where they would obtain the necessary drugs when the Government hospita is itself kept constantly in short supply of even the commonest remedie 6* Although it seems as if Dr.Sheikh has allowed his enthusiasm to carry him away, he at least deserves congratulating on having at tempted to do away with one griev^ous abuse, namely the employment in factories of younri children.

Tactary owners must give to their workers free of charge, two suits during tne year, une summer and one winter suit, 2 shirts, 2 pairs ol underpants and one shirt for working. Or, alterna tively, instead of supplying these gar jents, they may pay the workers over 18 years rials 850 by instalments; to workers under 18, 600 rials, also by instalments. olausu workers are not allowed to sell or to give to another person the suits which the factory owners nave bought for them. Tne penalty for infringing this clause is that the worker shall receive no suit the following year. 5. All factories who employ more than 100 workers must have a fully- equipped medicjfl post in charge of a doctor, and faotoxy owners must cooperate in establishing a hospital with 100 beds complete with mattresses:, linen etc. axid provide for surgical cases and womens diseases. such a hospital is to be established by the end of 1323 (1944) and the hospital will provide medical treat ment aid drugs for employees and their families.

Ey ^ L Dear Le^ett, » v.^3 ^On receipt of your letter of the 13th April regarding the telegram from Tehran to the iniater of State, Cairo, whidh I had not seen before, I made sore enquiries and the result has Just reached me on return from a week’s leave. I?am afraid this lias somewhat delayed ny reply. We have had no canaent from India and it may be that they are waiting for a lead from Cairo or from here to knew whether H.M.G. approve the idea. Ve ourselves share your view that the idea is one which is well worth pursuing, though of course it would remain to be seen whether there is a suitable nan who can be spared from India. It looks to us as if the man who is wanted should be one who has expert know ledge of conciliation work as naich as welfare. But if it is welfare tliat is wanted, then it is worth remenfoering that though&gt; as Mr. Bevin suggests, the British firms in India are on the whole ahead of the Indian firms in this respect, the largest Indian firm of all, namely, Tata’s, have from the outset taken an enlightened view of welfare matters and ight be in a position t ' ~ , Sir Frederick Leggett, C. B., Ministry of Labour,'3ore ©specially in view of the fact thO they are a Parsec firm and, therefore, not altogether disinterested in Persia. nothing seeing to have cone in from Cairo on the subject, and 5 gather that the ^or eiga Office are waiting for reactions from the Minister of Jfcate or from India a«d, moreover, have some doubt Aether they could justify to the treasury the chargin ' ot the cost of the proposed export to British revenues. evidently nothing will happen if everybody waits on each other, and I suggest it ndght be useful if you were to make known to the Foreign Gffioe directly Mr. Bevin* s interest in the matter. lours sincerely, (3d.) W. D, CROFT./O Secretary, External Dearti.ient , iS • • Have you been in touch with the Foreign Office about the telegram of the 19th March (from) the Minister of State on the sub ject of labour conditions in Persia, and do you know what their views are and have you any particular views of your own? Perhaps you have ^already received something from India on this subject. * I imagine it would be generally agreed that India might be encouraged, as suggested in this letter from Sir Frederick Leggett , to do what is proposed. No doubt, as a general rule, the British firms in India are ahead of the Indian firms in regard to welfare work, but there are, I should think, a good many European firms which do not do much on these lines and some Indian firms which do. Hie two outstanding firms in India for welfare work, within my knowledge, are Binny* s, who rim cotton mills, more particularly in Madras City, and Tata* s, who for a long time past have taken an enlightened view about welfare work and who have certainly been the pioneers in this matter among Indian firms, and whose welfare work at Jamshedpur must be much the biggest thing of its kind in India. It occurs to me that possibly Tata’s, being Parsees and having some sort of a connection with Persia, might be more appropriate than a British firm. Tata's, of course, have varying enterprises apart from iron and steel, and these include cotton mills, which is presumably the kind of industry referred to at Isfahan. I believe, too, that the Indian Railways have quite a good record in regard to welfare work and accordingly the Government of India themselves might be in a position to help.

Since last simmer there have been continual small strikes and disputes in these mills, apparently produced by two causes, the first place wages are low and hours long (eight per day plus two hours compulsory overtime for men, women and children alike . Secondly, it appears that trouble was deliberately fomented hy the local G-.O.C., General Sahidi (since arrested by the British .dili^ary authorities), whoNis trying to work up a case for being appointed I-Iilitary Governor of the town; and by the mill-owners and police who wanted an excuse for the forcible suppression of the workers. The Consular Diary dated February 17th said:- ’’There have been more small strikes in the factories. In spite of the various agreements made here and in Tehran during the last • six months about increases in wages and improvements on conditions of work # it is clear that the owners are not applying them honestly yet. dhis ^ may be dangerous in the end for the workers are v now more or less organised in unions and have the power to make serious strikes if they should be too badly treated.

In these circumstances it would seem more important that the expert ^ from India should be skilled in industrial conciliation than in welfare.

Bullard, Tehran to the Minister of State, Cairo, of which a copy is .... attached. Mr. Bevin would like to suggest that, if possible, a representative from one of the British firms in India should be sent as he understands that welfare work is more advanced in some of these than in other establishments. He would be very glad to have any information which you may get in regard to the action taken in India on this request as he feels that this kind of assistance will become increasingly important.

His Majesty’s Consul recommends that we should act on this suggestion and secure expert with oriental experience. I agree. Most obvious source would be Anglo-Persian Oil Company but it would be invidious for them to be mixed up in this matter and discontented mill-owners might afterwards take revenge on the company. 2. Could Government of India lend us for a few months expert with experience of industrial conditions and possibly welfare work in Indian mills? I propose at first that he should be paid by His Majesty’s Government and attached to His Majesty’s Consulate at Isfahan.

He could begin with enlightened mill-owner above mentioned and an improvement in one mill should raise the standard in others.
