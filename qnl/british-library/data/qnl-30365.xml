The actual correspondence runs into many files. 2. It may interest you to know that I showed your letter to Colonel Fo?/le, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, who expressed pleasure that Air Head quarters were sympathetic towards the Shaikh in the matter of his garden troubles on the Shatt al Arab, and incidentally asked me to send him a copy of my letter to you, when written. 3. Of course you realise that one of my chief anxieties at the present time is the Shaikh^ attitude of mind towards His Majesty’s Government. He has I fear lost much faith in us British, not only in the matter of the gardens question, but because no relief has been secured to him by His Majesty’s Government from Bin Saud’s Blockade, in spite of our promise made in 1929. The Shaikh is today faced with having to decide whether to give an Oil Concession to the Anglo Persian Oil Company or the American Group represented by Holmes. It is of paramount importance that he should decide in the right direction, of course, but he feels so bitterly that he has been let down over the date gardens and Blockade business, that one cannot but help see that the scales are already in large measure ^frighted in favour of the Eastern &amp; General syndicate. -—■ — ooo—SECRET . Note on the various points in dispute between His Excellency the Shaikh of i-uwait and the ^raq Government in res pect of certain Garden Property on the Shatt al Arab. Ehe disputes fall under three distinct and separate heads. (a) The Shaikh’s claim that his date gardens on the Shatt-Al Arab should be exempt from paying Revenue or faxes. (b) The attempt in the Iraq Law Courts to upset the Shaikh’s ov/nership to two of the said gardens. (c) The insistence of the Iraq Government that tha produce of the said gardens destined for the Shaikh’s own household in Kuwait should pajr Export Tax. 2. As regards (a) the late Shaikh Mubarak owned four large and important .Gardens on the Shatt al Arab, r* known under the following names The Fao Estate. The Mutaawa’ah Estate. The Eaddaghiyeh Estate (in which is i*r included the Bashiyeh garden). The Earhaniyeh Estate- These four gardens are to-day in the hands of the present Shaikh of Kuwait, who administers them and divides the produce*, among the decendents of the said bhaikh Mubarak. In the early stages of the Great : %r when Turkey threw in her lot with the Central Powers, Shaikh Mubarak intimated to His Majesty's Government that he wished to be associated with Great Britain on the side of the Allies and placed himself and the resources of his Stated at His Majesty's Government 's disposal. On/On 3rd November m 1914 His Majesty’s Govern ment addressed a communication to Shaikh Mubarak and afier thanking him for his loyalty and offer, ordered him to attack the Turkish posts of Urn Qasr, Safwan and Bubiyan and occupy them. He was further told to follow this up by an attack on the Basrah and liberate it from the Turks . If this should prove an impossible task, he was to arrange to prevent Turkish reinforcements from reaching Basrah or even Qurnah, until such time as the British Expeditionary Force which was being despatched from India arrived. Other detailed orders, such as the using of his influence and strength to prevent the Turks harming British Subjects and their property in Basrah, as well as the guarding of &lt;bther European subjects there etc. etc. were included in this official letter. As a reward for his labours and in the event of the allies winning the war, His Majesty’s Government made the following promises to the Shaikh:- w (a) That your gardens which are now in your possession, viz, the date gardens situate between Fao and Qurnah, shall remain in your possession, and in the possession of your decendents, without being subject to the payment of revenue or taxes. (b) That if you attack Safwan, Urn Qasr and Bubiyan and occupy them, the British Govern ment will protect you from any consequences arising from that action. (c) That the British Government does re cognize and admit that the Sheikhdom of Kuwait is an independent Government under British Protection” The war over, His Majesty’s Government imple mented all her promises, up to the time of signing of the treaty between Great ^ritain and Iraq, which was to admit the latter to the League of Nations as an Indepen dent State. Unfortunately nothing was said in the treaty His Majesty’s Government’s promises to the HulerRuler of Kuwait in respect of the four exempted date gardens. To-day the attitude of the Iraq Government is that the promises made by His Majesty 1 s Government are not her concern, and that she considers herself entitled to take full revenue and taxes from the four gardens owned by the Shaikh. Up to the middle of 1951, His Majesty’s Govern ment managed to persuade Iraq to hold her hand pending disucssions on the matter, but with the introduction and enforcement of 'Istahlak” Law by the Iraq Government in 1931, which Law provided that the purchaser and exporter of garden produce (dates, etc.) should pay the tf Ashur n (10 $) tax, the Shaikh of Kuwait has in effect had to pay full taxation on his gardens, for naturally the in dividual, merchant, or company, buying a garden owner’s produce, dedeucts from the fixed purchase price, the exact amount he the exporter is required by Law to pay over to Government in taxation. This indirect, but nevertheless very real, method of paying revenue, has been enforced since the Autumn of 1931, and as far as the Shaikh’s 4 gardens are concerned, taxation has been indirectly paid on his Tinta? crop ’’Shitwi” of 1931-32 (fruit, wheat, barley etc.), and again on his Summer crop 'Saifi” of 1932 (dates). The Shaikh made many vigorous appeals to His Majesty’s Government in the matter, but so far without result. It seems clear that since His Majesty’s Govern ment failed to insist on a clause being inserted in the Treaty ith Iraq, under which the latter should have been required to honour His Majesty's Government oblige ionsobligations to the Shaikh, His Majesty’s Government must nov 'pay the piper' and compensate the Shaikh for present and future losses due to the payment of the Ashur Tax. As regards (b). In August 1930 a clever com— paign was started in the Basrah Law Courts with the object of dispossessing the Shaikh of his Bashiyeh garden (part of the large Faddaghiye# Estate). Proceedings lingered on till 20th December 1931, when the appelate court in Baghdad gave a decision against the Shaikh. The plain tiff in the case was a certain lady named Rafiyah daugh ter of one Shafiqah, who sold the property to Shaikh Mubarak in 1908 for £ T.4489. The case was apparently a 'test” one and ac cording to the Shaikh, was not so much due to lady Rafiyah T g own activities, as to inspiration from Baghdad. In the Spring of 1932 a similar attack was made in respect of the Shaikh*s large 'Faddaghiyeh' Estate, and in the summer of the same year, a suit was filed in the Basrah Courts against the Shaikh by one Abdullah Beg As Zuhair. The Faddaghiyeh property, is situate opposite Abadan and was purchased in 1908 for £60,000 also by Shaikh Mubarak, from a lacy called Aisha (Awasha), wife of Ahmad ^asha as Zuhary, and every person of note in Basrah witnessed the sale deeds including such prominent men as the Shaikh of Mohammerah, the Naqib, Sayed Talib Pasha, Isa Pasha al Zuhair ( father of the present plaint iff in the case) etc. A regular 'Cause celebre” resulted for the Turks refused to allow Shaikh Mubarak to take outtake out Tapu Deeds, unless he registered himself as a Turkish subject. This under instructions from His Majesty’s G vernment he resued to do. Behind the Turks policy was the idea that by exerting pressure on Shaikh Mubarak, they might get him to break with the British Government, with whom he had recently allied himself by treaty. Intrigue and counter intrigue continued between the Turks and Shaikh Mubarak till 1914 without the latter budging fiom his standpoint, or registering as Turk. During this period his garden was looked after by one Hamad al Khalid an important Kuwaiti land owner of Basrah. On the outbreak of the Great War in 1914, and after the occupation of Basrah, proper Tapu papers were finally issued to Shaikh Mubarak by Mr.Dobbs, later Sir Henry Dobbs, who was the Revenue Commissioner, Basrah, after full enquiry into the whole history of the case had been made, and the Shaikh’s title proved. Much correspondence passed between the Shaikh and His Majesty’s Government regarding the Bashiyeh and Faddaghiyeh Law suits, and ended in the Shaikh anneal ing in 1932 (June 26th) to the British Government to protect his interests, under the first clause of TT is Majesty’s Government’s promise, made in their letter of 3rd November 1914 to Shaikh Mubarak (see above ), and on the grounds that he, the Shaikh, possessed proper title deeds issued by His Majesty’s Revenue Commissioner during the British occupation, and lastly because proceedings were ’’time bar red” • The Faddaghiyeh case at the time of writing this note, remains undecided apparently as a result of His Majesty’s Government interesting themselves in the matter. The Shaikh, however, ontinues to be consumed with anxiety as to the eventual outcome of suit, as a vast6 vast property is involved, and he feels uncertain of His Majesty's Government's eventual reactions. As in the Bashiyeh case the Shaikh is convinced that much of the trouble has been inspired from Baghdad. As regards (c). During the Turkish regime, all dates etc. exported from ^raq paid an export tax to the State, which in the case of laden dhows was collected at Fao. After the occupation of Iraq by the British Forces, this tax continued to be taken, except on dates exported by the Shaikh of Kuwait from his own properties, and for his own household use. This exemption was allowed in accordance with the first clause of His Majesty's Government’s promise made to Shaikh Mbarak in their let ter of 3rd November 1914. In 1917 the question arose as th whether this was a fair exemption in the interests of the Qivil Ad ministration of Iraq, but on the matter being referred to the Civil Commissioner, Sir Percy Cox, the latter decided that the exemption fell within His Majesty's Government's promise, and ordered the Director of Customs Basrah to continue such exemption. See Sir Percy Cox's telegram No.4051 of 30th September 1917 to the Political Agent, Kuwait, the contents of which were communicated to the Shaikh. In December 1932 the Iraq Government following out their declared policy of allowing the Shaikh of Kuwait no exemption from revenue or taxation, informea the lat ter’s agent at ?ao that all produce exported from the hitherto exempt gardens must pay export tax, as others were doing, under the plea that it was the Law of the land% 7 Protests and necessary representations were immediate -ly made by the Shaikh to His Majesty’s Government as before, but at the time of writing nothing has been done. At the end of December 1952, the first cargo of dates from the Shaikh’s garden at Fao, destined for his own household, was seized at Fao by the Iraq Customs authorities and export tax demanded. After nearly a month’s delay the Shaikh was forced to pay the tax in self-defence and to enable the dates and other produce to reach his household. The circumstances of the seizure of this cargo, was apparently attended by much unnecessary rudeness and lack of tact on the part of the Customs authorities, who are said to have refused to allow any steps to be taken by the Shaikh’s agent to protect the dates from the heavy rains of early January. 3. The above points have been summarized in this Agency’s confidential letter No.210 dated the 8th December 1932 to the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, a copy of which is attached to this notw with the request that it be kept strictly confidential. 4. There have been other instances also notably that connected with the compelling of Kuwait water boats to pro ceed to Fao, and register themselves there every time they go to fetch water, with payment of certain fees, which all according to the Shaikh tend to show that the Iraq authorities are pursuing a well defined policy towards himself and the people of Kuwait. 5 ^ The policy the Shaikh believes to be the same as that followed by Bin Saud, although different methods are employed. Both Bin Saud and Iraq clearly covet Kuwait, fo' the reason that its port is the best in the mersian milf. The former chooses to use the ’’Blockade' and. 'Starving methods', hoping eventually to force the Shaikh to acknowledgeacknowledge his suzerainty, while the latter prefer to adopt the more subtle means of attacking his private person, in the form of pressure on his estates* oth kingdoms do not as yet appear to have realized that ! is Majesty's Government is bound by treaty to protect the independence of Kuwait. Possibly they would modify their methods, if they were made to realize this fact.Copy of Confidential No.210, dated the 8th December 1932 from the Political Agent, Kuwait, to the Konbble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. h O' Subject:- Iraq Customs demand for export duty on Shaikh T s Garden produce, exported fjom/i his own household use. I have the honour to forward for your information translation of the following communication which I have received from His Excellency Shaikh Sir Ahmad al Jabir as- Subah, E.C.I.E., C.S.I., Ruler of Kuwait; Letter Ho.2/745.R. dated the 4th Shaban 1351 (2nd December 1932) from His Excellency the Ruler of Kuwait to the Political Agent, Kuwait 2. The letter speaks for itself, and requires little comment. 3. This demand by the Iraq Customs Department for an Export Tax on that portion of the produce of the Shakh f s gardens destined for his own household use in Kuwait, car ries out to its end, the declared policy of the Iraq Govern ment, to tax the Shaikh of Kuwait’s four date gardens on the Shatt al Arab for which, he ( the Shaikh) possesses a document dated 1914 from His Majesty’s Government to the effect that they shall be exempted from any taxation for all time. 4. If I may make the suggestion I think the time has come tior the strongest representations to be made to His Majesty’s Government, for an early decision as to the manner in which it is proposed to compensate the Shaikh of Kuwait• Phe long drawn out delay in settling this ques- tion has had a deplorable effect in Kuwait, and will without doubt find an echo down the 'ersian Gulf and in i.ejd. t(£ 3 ? j.t is unfortunate, but as you know true, that we have been accused of breach of faith, where the Shaikh of Mohammerah was concerned and I think our good name and prestige should not be asked to stand another such 'shock' where Kuwait is concerned^ 6# rrile Shaikh’s cousin Abdulla As Salim yester day made the rather unpleasant but ssbmewhat apt remark to me apropos of the recent annulment by the Persian Government of the D’Arcy Concession. 'If you do not play square with your friends, you must not expect sym pathy if your enemies break agreements'. This I mention in passing as an example of what people are thinking of here. It is of interest to note that the Iraq Govern ment has proceeded quite methodically in the matter of taxation of the Shaikh’s gardens. (a ) 'Ashur' Tax was taken on the 'Shitwi' (or '/inter crop) of the gardens in the Spring of 1932. (b) S!shur tax was taken on the 'Saifi” (or Summer crop) in the Summer of 1932. (c) They have now (Autumn 1932) demanded Customs Export tax on garden produce ( fruit, wood, lucrene, grass, dates, palm fronds, etc.,) destined for the Shaikh’s own household in Kuwait, such produce being exempt from taxation by law, to property owners residing in Iraq. 8. In connection with 7(c) above I would draw vour attention to my confidential D.O. letter No.194 v ^ ( ,| i-inhrtrrr-—' &gt; ^^^kx^xm*^**** dated the 28th October 1932 to H.A.Cooper, Esquire, the Director of Customs and Excise, Basrah, copy of which was sent to you, in particular to telegram marked 4, which was sent as an enclosureTranslation of a letter No.2/745-R, dated the 4th ohahan 1351 (2nd December 1932), from His Excellency the Ruler of Kuwait to the Political Agent, Kuwait. After compliments, It is not to be hidden from Your Excellency that we have received information from our agent at Fao, to the effect that the Director of Customs there has de manded from his custom duties on garden produce, such as fruit, firewood, etc., which is exported from our gardens for the use of our household. This indeed, has filled us with astonishment as such produce has since a long time, been exempted by His Majesty’s Government.

You probably know the reason for my telegram of to-day regarding the area of the Bashiya estate. Sardine telephoned to ask if I knew the number of Saribs in the estate and said that since it had been taken from the Shaikh by the Iraqi Courts, the British G-overnment were considering making a cash payment to the Shaikh of the value of the estate. I replied that I did now know the area but that the estate was purchased by Mubarak for about £.t.5000 gold. Land valued in the Basra area have of course depreciated tremendously (witness Farhads case) and Jardine says good land is now going for Rs.500 per Jarib. He added that he intended to recommend Rs.1000/- per Jarib for the Bashiya, which, he thought was a fair price as according to records the estate v/as only pro ducing Rs.60 per jarib before expenses had been paid. I have not sufficient information to dispute his figures but no doubt you know if they are approximately correct. He did not say he was telling me in confidence, and in any case, I expect you already know all about it.* If not, I am sure you will appreciate my point when I say I shall be grateful if you can aboid disclosing your source of information.

Iraqi Government have ordered that export duty shall be taken on all taxable exports from ’Iraq by the Shaikh of Kuwait. Immunity from these dues hes been conceded in the past to garden produce exported from ’Iraq for the personal use of the Shaikh, but, as it is not covered by any Itew or agreement, it is not possible, now that the istihlak tax is being enforced throughout the country, for the Government to continue to allow exeraption for these } iL British Embassy, Baghdad, 12th January 1933, x sMrl exports. This produce is, therefore, brought into the same category as that of the remainder of the produce exported from the Shaikh’s gardens in * Iraq. 2. In view of the fact that the ’Iraqi Government have given no official reply to a request made by the High Commission, and subsequently by His Majesty’s Legation, that the produce of the gardens of the Shaikh should be exempted from the istihlak tax until the whole question had been settled, I do not anticipate that any good result would be achieved by an official protest on this smaller matter, certainly not until some progress has been made towards reaching a settlement of the problem# 3. I take this opportunity to forward a copy of my despatch No.29 of January 12th 1933, to the Foreign Office in/ U ae Honourable The Political Resident^ in the Persian Gulf, B u s h i r e.• • • 2~ in wMcii I put forward suggestions as to the lines on which an attempt should be made to estimate the amount which the Shaikh is out of pocket as the result of the imposition of the istiMak tax, as a basis for the assessment of compensation should it be decided that His Majesty’s Government will pay compensation• 1 have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servant, s a/~ •H.h umphry s •Mo.29. Britisii almbaesy, 12tii January 1933. 1 have the honour to address you on the subject of the revenue exemption of the shaikh of Kuwait, and the dis cussion at the inter-departmental meeting held at the Colonial Office oh September 13th,1932, which took place regarding the undertaking given to him. 2. It is shown in the minutes of that conference that it was generally agreed that steps should be taken to secure the payment to the Shaikh of some kind of financial compensation in liquidation of the obligations arising out of the undertaking given to him in 1914, and that it would be necessary to form some estimate of the extent to which he would be out of pocket as the result of the imposition of the istihlak tax. I promised, after giving the question further consideration on my return to Baghdad, to advise as to how this could best be done. 3. I have reached the conclusion that it is not possible to compile an accurate estimate of the financial effect of the istihlak taxation upon the Shaikh of Kuwait, except by calling upon him to provide substantiated figures of crop sales and exports. Mo estimate will be of real value unless it is based upon actuals and the fact that the Shaikh is now paying, or * bearing the burden of, the tax, provides an opportunity for an approximate assessment of his losses. 4. The collection of istihlak tax on the produce of his gardens in ’Iraq can only affect his pocket detrimentally in thr ee/ Ihe Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.G.S.I.,K.C.V.O., etc., etc., etc.- 2 - three ways, vizs- (a) by the direct imposition of a 10% tax upon the value of all produce exported from * Iraq, whether for his own use or for sale; (b) by the collection of the tax upon all produce from his gardens placed on the market in 4 Iraq; and (c) by the recent decision of the 'Iraqi Government to take customs duty upon garden produce exported by the Shaikh from 'Iraq for his own personal use, these exports having been passed duty free until a short while a&amp;o. She cash value of this exemption is small, 5, For purposes of calculation, (a) and 1c) can be grouped together. All payments of istihlak tax upon exported produce of the gardens must have been made by the owner of the produce, i.e. the Shaikh, or his agents. Receipts for such payments should be available, and state- raents regarding export can be checked* It should, therefore be a simple matter for the Shaikh to prepare at the end of one year from the date of application of the new system of taxation to dates, i.e.on 1st August,1933, a comprehensive statement, which can be easily substantiated, of the whole of his payments on this account. Care would be needed in checking to ensure that no exports of produce from pro perties not covered by the exemption were included, but i: the Shaikh or his agent had purchased such produce and subsequently exported it istihlak tax would have been payable at the time of sale and not at the time of exp or K (b) is more difficult, as under the law the tax would generally be paid by the purchaser, or by the owrrMV of the licensed store into which the produce is placed preparatory-3« preparatory to being marketed# Tiie Siiaikh or his agents would not, therefore, necessarily pay the tax, and might have no receipts to produce# The effect of the tax on the Shaikh is indirect by reason of his receiving a lo#er price for the produce than he would have received had there been no taxation* It should not, however, be beyond the resources of t he Sh aikh to provide a statement of dates and grain grown u pon his e states and sold in ’Iraq by his agents. His agents doubtless keep some tally showing how the crops are disposed of, and it would probably be possible to verify, by reference to the ’Iraqi Government tax records, the transactions which the Shaikh claims have involved him in loss* The statement should cover the same calendar year as is suggested for the figures of export* The rate of tax is computed according to a fixed official conversion rate, and no difficult questions of valuation of produce need be encountered. Given the above information, there should be little difficulty in assessing, in September next, with a degree of accuracy, the bxtent of the loss which the Shaikh has suffered, and will be likely to suffer in the future, by the imposition of the istihl&amp;k tax. 6. The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, in his despatch Ko.34 of 1932, dated the 16th of August,1932, paragraph 6, offered to try and obtain whatever details are required for this purpose frcm the Shaikh. 1 recommend that the Shaikh should be asked to provide these particulars* I can think of no other simple method of obtaining them# 7e 1 understand that the question as to whether the payment of corapensation to the Shaikh is a legal obligation which rests on His Majesty’s Government has been referred for opinion to theLaw Officers of the Crown, and that if it is held thst # # # #• • # Mi ^W&gt; that no legal obligation exists a lump sum payment will be made to the Shaikh GtK gratia to be shared if possible between the Treasury and the Government of India. Such a payment would finally dispose of his claim. Whichever solution is finally adopted it will be necessary to form a preliminary estimate of the Shaikh*s losses due to the imposition of the new tax. In the meantime the instructions to the Political Resident can no doubt be framed in such a way as to avoid committing His Majesty’s Government to shouldering any responsibility in the matter. 8. The above remarks apply in general to the exemption accorded to the similar case of the Shaikh of Mohammerah, although no objection has been raised by him or on his behalf against the effect of the istihlak tax upon his revenue exemption. If it is decided, in principle, to grant compensation, the amount to be given to him could be assessed on the lines suggested above, and I hafce little doubt that his agent at Basrah will be able to supply the particulars required. i 9.

I haw the honour to report that His Excellency the Shaikh celled on me yesterday l 23 rd January 1933 ) and informed mo that his Fao Agent had arrived in Kuwait with the news that his boat~load of dates lying in the Shatt al Arab off the Fao Customs House was in eminent danger of being com pletely ruined as a result of the recent widespread rains, and that it was imperative that the Customs Report Tax be paid Immediately and the boat released. That he, the Shaikh, had accordingly ordered the Customs iSxport Duly to be paid under protest, purely in order to save the dates, and because he had. received no further instructions as a result of your represent ations to His Majesty* s Ambassador, and none seemed likely toto b« forthocaaing in the immediate future* S* Hla i^coeXIenoy further mde the following rather serious allegation against the lau&amp;ir of Oustoms at fao, but whether this was due to a deliberate desire on the part of the latter to mke himself unpleasant t or because of orders he had received, he, the Shaikh, was not prepared to say* ^h© allegation took the following form, and was ba&amp;eu on the report of hi®, the Sheikh’s i^gent* The dates in question, which as already reported were destined for the Shaikh’s own household use, consisted of approximately It-0 basket® (gosaras) each of ^?t* These at the end of Deoesiber had been loaded cm a small dhow ready for shipment to Kuwait* The dhow had been ordered to anchor opposite the F&amp;o Customs House and remain there, until the Customs Export Tax was paid* then the heavy rain which fell on X£&gt;th, 14th, 15th and 16th of January first started, the Shaikh’s Agent requested the Mudir of Customs, to allow him to unload the date® and place them under shelter cm shore, or failing this, either to permit tarpaulins to be placed over the cargo or at least allow the boat to be run up a neighbouring creek and placed in a position of shelter close to a house belonging to the Shaikh which lies inside the said creek. According to the Agent’s stafeent all three requests were categorically refused, with the result that the boat became waterlogged with resulting heavy damage to the cargo* 4* His Excellency pointed out that he had no reason to doubt the statement of his agent who had hitherto proved himself a reliable man, and opined that nowhere in the world would a reasonable request of this nature, have been refused. The fact that it was so refused, forced him to the belief, much against his will, that there was behind the Mudir * a action, the intention to put him the shaikh to financial loss and shame* ©• His Hrcellency significantly added that of course the ultimate responsibility and fault lay with HieEls Majesty’s Oovarment which had so far failed to implement the promise made by c»ir Percy Cox in hi a telegram Uo 9 4051 dated the 50th v^eptember 1917, copy of which had at tine time been given to i his predecessor Shaikh Salim by the Political Agent. This was to the effect that dates, etc., destined for the Sheikh of Kuwait’s household us© should be exempt from Iraq Export Duty. 6 . While I am not prepared entirely to vouch for the statements of the Shaikh’s Agent regarding the refusal of the Mudir at Fao to allow reasonable measures to be taken for the protection of tins cargo of dates, during the undoubtedly heavy rains which fell on the 13th January and onwards, the latter prime facie would appear to have displayed some lack of tact and courtesy, more especially as he must have known that he was dealing with dates belonging to the Huler of a neighbouring and friendly State. There is little doubt I think that the dates did also suffer damage, otherwise His Excelleney who for a close cm a month has steadfastly refused to pay the Export l&gt;uty in the hope© that some thing would be arranged by Hi© Majesty’s Grovernment, would scarely have decided suddenly to pay the tax# 7. It is very regrettable that the above indident should have come on the top of the long drawn out delay in settl ing the Bate Gardens and Blockade questions, and at the very moment when the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and Eastern General » syndicate having received His Majesty’s Government’s permission to open direct negotiations with the Jhaikh, are engaged in trying to get an oil concession out of him. For it is obviously desirable that the Shaikh at this time more than any other should not have his faith and trust in His Majesty’s Government ’o power to extri cate him from his difficulties, further shaken.

No, 6' of 11th January forwarding a copy of the Arabic letter dated 3rd November 1914 issued by Colonel Knox to the late Sheikh Mubarak. As you know, the question whether the wording of the 1914 Pledge must be legally construed as applying to the Istihlak Tax is being referred to the Law Officers. At an inter-departmental meeting regarding the date gardens which was held here last autumn Sir Francis Humphrys, who was present, and the Legal Adviser to the Foreign Office advanced the view, with some confidence, that the pledge does not legally apply to the present tax. We therefore felt bound on our side to ask that ti© question should be referred to the Law Officers, since, though the legal position does not in our view affect the political desirability or the moral obligation to tenant Colonel H.B.P.Dickson, compensate/ C.I.E., Litical Agency, Koweit.( 4~ ? conipensate the Sheikh, it may well affect the amount of the compensation considered reasonable; if we have to acquiesce in the view taken about the legal position we may have to agree to a smaller amount of compensation, and beiore doing this we thought it desirable to get the highest Je gal opinion. The Treasury at first demurred to this but, subsequently, after consultation with the Treasury Solicitor and the Foreign Office, came round to our view and have prepared a draft case fcr the Law Officers, unfortunately after a long delay* A perusal of the draft case suggested that the opinion of the Law Officers may largely turn on the exact sense and implications of the Arabic words into which the expression ’immune frcm taxation 1 was rendered by Colonel Knox. It was for this reason that we thought it important that, as the Treasury also suggested, the Arabic text should be available here* According to Storey the words in question bear the literal meaning of 1 taxes or imposts' , two more or 3e ss synonymous terms covering/CONFIDENTIAL.

Sir John Simon is of the opinion that it would be unwise to invite the Shaikhs to furnish a statement of their losses until it has been definitely decided that compensation is to be paid to them and also upon what basis compensation is to be assessed. Subject to the concurrence of Sir Samuel Hoare, he proposes to return a reply in this sense to Sir Francis Humphrys* despatch. 3.

I have the honour to address you on the subject of the revenue exemption of the Shaikh of Kuwait, and the discussion at the Inter-departmental meeting held at the Colonial Office on September 13th, 1932, which took place regarding the under taking given to him. 2. It is shown in the minutes of that conference that it was generally agreed that steps should betaken to secure the payment to the Shaikh of some kind of financial compensation in liquidation of the obligations arising out of theunder- taking given to him in 1914, and that it would be necessary to form some estimate of the extent to which he would be out of pocket as the result of the imposition of the istihlak tax. I promised, after giving the question further consideration on my return to ^agdad, to advise as to how this could best be done. 3. I have reached the conclusion that it is not possible to compile an accurate estimate of the financial effect of the istihlak taxation upon the Shaikh of Kuwait, except by calling upon him to provide substantiated figures of crop sales and exports. No estimate will be of real value unless it is based upon actuals and the fact that the Shaikh is now paying, or bearing the burden of, the tax, provides an opportunity for an approximate assessment of his losses. 4. The collection of istihlak tax on the produce of his gardens in Iraq can only affect his pocket detrimental]y in three ways, viz.:- (e)/ The Right Honourable ’ Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I.,K.C.Y.O., etc. etc. etc.(a) by the direct imposition of a 10^ tax upon the value of all produce exported from Iraq, whether for his own use of for sale; lb) by the collection of the tax upon all produce from his gardens placed on the market in Iraq;and (c ) by the recent decision of the Iraqi Government to take customs duty upon garden produce exported by the Shaikh from Iraq for his own personal use, these exports having been passed duty free until a short v/hile ago. The cash value of this exemption is small* 5. For purposes of calculation, la) and 1c) can be grouped together. All payments of istihlak tax upon exported produce of the gardens must have been made by the owner of the produce, i.e. the Shaikh, or his agents. Receipts for such payments should be available, and statements regarding export can be checked. It should, therefore, be a simple matter for the Shaikh to prepare at the end of one year from the date of application of the new system of taxation to dates, i.e, on 1st August 1933 a comprehensive statement, which can be easily substantiated, of the whole of his payments on this account. Care would be needed in checking to ensure that no exports of produce from properties not covered by the exemption were included, but if the Shaikh or his agent had purchased such produce and subsequently exported it istihlak tax would have been payable at the time of sale and not at the time of export. lb) is more difficult, as under the law the tax would generally be paid by the purchaser, or by the owner of the licensed store into which the produce is placed preparatory to being marketed. The Shaikh or his agents would not, therefore, necessarily pay the tax, am^night have no receipts to produce. The effect of the tax on the Shaikh is indirect-3- (aj oj sMisg k \ erfB 9iiJ M ad Hto [ ,is&amp;3 rg od iliit: noitoii'l : t30 iliidnii^ ! ■ |;lJJ0f9- [Oi! eoiW o ,i0^ 551 £ ni3 w^'' 1 itepq ^ (fl) d *8 t*^' ®3« is&lt;(! ,9^ by reason of hie receiving a lower price for the produce than he would have received had there been no taxation. it should not, however, be beyond the resources of the Shaikh to provide a statement of dates and grain grown upon his estates and sold in Iraq by his agents. His agents doubtless keep some tally showing how the crops are disposed of, and it would probably be possible to verify, by reference to the Iraqi Government tax records, the transactions which the Shaikh claims have involved him in loss. The statement should cover the same calendar | year as is suggested for the figures of export# The rate of tax is comfiuted according to a fixed official conversion rate, and no difficult questions of valuation of produce need be encounter ed. Given the above information, there should be little difficulty in assessing, in September next, with a degree of accuracy, the extentjof the loss which the Shaikh has suffered, and will be likely to suffer in the future, by the imposition of the istihlak tax. ,, y f° ^ ^ :J 1 6. The Hon f ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, in his despatch No.34/df 1932, dated the 16th of August 1932, paragraph 6, offered to try and obtain whatever details are required for this purpose from the Shaikh. I recommend that the Shaikh should be asked to provide these particulars. I can think of no other simple method of obtaining them. 7. I understand that the question as to whether the payment of compensation to the Shaikh is a legal obligation which rests on His Majesty’s Government has been referred for opinion ; to the Law Officers of the Crown, and that if it is held that no legal obligation exists a lump sum payment will be made to the Shaikh ex gratia to be shared if possible between the Treasury and the Government of India. Such a payment would finally/finally dispose of his claim. Whichever solution is finally adopted it will be necessary to form a preliminary estimate of the Shaikh’s losses due to the imposition of the new tax. In the meantime the instructions to the Political Resident can no doubt be framed in such a way as to avoid committing His Majesty^ Government to shouldering any responsibility in the matter. 8. The above remarks apply in general to the exemption accorded to the similar case of the Shaikh of Mohammerah, al though no objection has been raised by him or fen his behalf against the effect of the istihlak tax upon his revenue exemption. If it is decided, in principle, to grant compensa tion, the amount to be given to him could be assessed on the lines suggested above, and I have little doubt that his agent at Basrah will be able to supply the particulars required. 9.

Sir, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your telegram No.20 of February 24th last relative to the revenue exemption * granted to the Shaikh of Kuwait, and to enclose a copy of the note which I addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in accordance with your instructions. 2 . I have also considered the question put forward in paragraph 3 of your telegram upon which you asked for my views as to whether the Shaikh should safeguard his rights by paying the amounts demanded from him by the ’Iraqi Ciovernment under protest. As the agents of the Shaikh have already protested vigorously to the ’Iraqi Government as represented by the Collector of Customs and Excise at Basrah, when paying the export duty demanded, I am inclined to think that no useful purpose would be served at this ^ stage by the presentation of a formal protest by the Shaikh through me to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Indeed, in view of the fact that His Majesty’s Government have not yet agreed that the operation of the istihlak tax does violate the 1914 undertaking, and this question is now under the consideration of the Law Officers of the Crown, I am advised that such action might present possible dangers. I suggest, however, that on each occasion when the tax is paid, his agent should continue to protest in writing and to keep copies of such protests. In my opinion the written protest which has now been presented to the ’Iraqi Government is all that His/ THE RIGHT HONOURABLE SIR JOHN SIMON, G.C.S.I.,K.C.V.O., etc., etc., etc.- 2 - His Majesty’s Government can safely do to preserve the rights of the Shaikh until the opinion of the Law Officers is available. 3 .

My dear Fowle, Under cover of your official despatch ho.107-S of 1933 of February 1st, you sent me a copy of a letter from the Political Agent, Kuwait, putting forward a complaint from the Shaikh of Kuwait against the conduct of the Mudir of Customs at Fao in the matter of a consignment of dates held up at that post pending payment of export duty. Your covering despatch asked that the allegations should be brought to the notice of the ’Iraqi Government. I considered it preferable, before taking this action, to refer the matter privately to the British Adviser to the Ministry of Finance, with the request that he would make enquiries Irom ' the Customs Department, which is still under the direction of British officers, and let me knew if the allegations made by the Shaikh’s agent could be substantiated. I cannot do better than send you a copy of the letter which has been received in reply, from which I think you will deduce, as I have done, that a formal representation to the Iraqi Government would not result in the Shaikh receiving any satisfaction. There is possibly some ground for complaint but as the oflicial concerned will apparently have a support of his superior officers, I do not feel that any good purpose would be served by pursuing the question further. I a m very sorry indeed that the Shaikh should suffer from such annoying incidents and I hope that we shall soon be in a position to take definite action towards settling the whole question. I am looking forward to hearing from you what dates will suit you for a visit to England. V/e shall be delighted to see you/ he Hon'ble Lt.-Colonel T.C.W.Fowle,c.B.E.you here next month, and I feel that an exchange of views on the question of the Shaikh’s relations with the Iraqi G-overnment will be most helpful to me# Yours sincerely, (Sgd.)

D.O. 82 Ministry of Finance Bagdad, 9th March, 1933 0 My dear Stafford, / ' / Reference your letter of 24th February to Mr.Hogg regarding the allegations made by the Shaikh of Kuwait against the Customs Authorities. Sivwright has reported in full on this matter but I do not think I need send you copies of all the docunents. The case may be summarised as follows; Orders were sent to the Customs Officer at Fao to detain a shipment of approximately 200 maunds of dates consigned to Kuwait against a claim of I.D. 3/455 for export duties. The officer in question reports that he permitted a boom to be loaded with 50 maunds of dates only and that he was then requested by the Agent to permit the unloading of these dates at one of the Shaikh’s houses in Fao. He refused this. He denies that the Agent requested permission to cover the cargo with tarpaulins and states that had the Agent done so he would certainly not have withheld permission. [V The Acting Collector of Customs at Basrah states that he has enquired into the matter and is satisfied that the report of the Customs Officec'at Fao is full and correct. Yours sincerely, ( Sgd).

Otherwise might not a formal protest on the lines proposed in your telegram be tantamount to an admission by His I 0 ajesty*s Government that there is a legal breach of the undertaking, which would subsequently be embarrassing, particularly if law officers advise in a contrary sense. As regards placing tax collections on deposit Iraq Government are clearly most reluctant to grant any concession to Sheikh where Istihlak tax is concerned. I should prefer not to address protest officially on this minor point as there is nothing much to be gained from having the amount of tax collected placed in a deposit account. The same effect can be achieved by Sheikh keeping a complete record of amounts paid. If in subsequent negotiations Iraq Government agree to refund such collections it will make no difference whether the money is nominally on deposit or not.(deceived under Governnent of India, ^orei^n and Political Beoartnent endoraenent No. P.P3-N/33, do+ed 5th April 1933.) ^ Telegram from the London Foreign Office to Sir Francis Humphrys» Baghdad, No#20, dated 24th February, 1933* Your telegram No. 27fof February 21st.

But we do not feel complete confidence that the Sheikh (who does not appear to be a particularly businesslike person and who has clearly not been too well served by his agents and bailiffs in the past) can be relied on to take the obvious course of keeping a record of payments made and we still do not think that any harm would be done by a discreet and quite informal hint (we would not go beyond this) as to the advisability keeping some record, to be given by Dickson, who, as you know, is in close daily ' contact with the Sheikh and from whose despatches the question of the date gardens appears to be a frequent topic of conversation. We trust that in these circumstances you willsee bo objection to action on the lines proposed.

Xours ever, CHANCERY. The Residency, BUSHIRE*A conference was held in the Ambassadors room this morning. There were present besides the Ambassador: Lieut.-Colonel T*C#Fowle, Political Resident In the Persian Gulf. Mr. Stafford, Financial Secretary. Mr. Nihill, Legal Secretary. The Ambassador said that he would like to consider first the actual present legal situation with regard to the two suits, Bashiyah and Faddaghiyah. Lieut.-Colonel Fowle pointed out that, although the Shaikh had lost the Bashiyah suit in the Appeal Court, it still apparently remained open to him to apply for mvision. If he did so, he would have to again accept the jurisdiction which might prejudice him in the matter of the Faddaghiyah suits on the other hand, His Majesty’s Government might take the view that he should exhaust all legal remedies open to him before coming to them for compensation. The Shaikh had two grounds on which he might base his claim for revisions- (a) that the Court had improperly refused to admit evidence that he was in possession prior to sale, and (b) that the *IraQ Land Act should override the provisions of the Mejelle. If he was right on either of these two points the suit was statute barred. Mr. Nihill said that he thought it unlikely that a claim by the Shaikh for revision would be accepted by the Court. The Article in the Civil Procedure Code which dealt with revision of Appellate judgments made it clear that the only permissible grounds for revision were when an aggrieved party could show a prima facie case that the winning suitoi had obtained his judgment by fraud or by the suppression of some material document. Both the points raised by the Polit leal/Political Resident were points of law which had already been before the Appeal Court. Mr. Stafford pointed out that the successful applicant would not be able to oust the Shaikh from possession until similar judgments had been obtained in favour of his co-heirs. Summonses had been issued by these co-heirs butthe Shaikh had refused to accept them. If ultimately the Shaikh accepted jurisdiction, presumably the points raised by Colonel Powle could be urged again on Dehall ol the Shaikh. The Ambassador asked Colonel Powle how far he thought the Shaikh had been prejudiced by the advice given to him befor the War by His Majesty’s Government on the question of his acceptance of Turkish nationality. Colonel Fowle replied that it looked as if the Shaikh could have acquired a Tapu title quite easily nad he been willing to accept Turkish nationality. Ihe Resident in the Gulf at that time certainly advised him not to do so, as it was His Majesty’s Government’s policy to keep the Shaikh under their influence. Lefeut.-Colonel Powle said that, as regards the Paddaghiyah suit, the Shaikh was going to give as his reasons for refusal to accept service of the summons, that, as an independent ruler, he was not amenable to the jurisdiction of the ’Iraqi courts. Mr. Hihill said that this would be a valuable delaying move. He did not, however, think that the point was good m International law as the suit concerned immovable property situated within the jurisdiction. The Ambassador stated that in his view little further could be done until the opinion of the Law Oificers of the Crown on the general question of the guarantee was received. But/But it would be necessary to bear in mind that, besides ihs compensation for loss of revenue exemption, it looked as if the Shaikh might ultimately appeal to His Majesty's Government for compensation for loss of possession as well. The question of the revenue exemption was briefly dis cussed but it was agreed that no further useful action could be taken locally until the Law Officers had advised (a) as to whether there was any legal obligation on His Majesty's Government, and (b) if so, whether the istihlak tax is an infringement of the revenue exemption guarantee. 11th Anril. 1933. ■***#•**COriFI DI-QIITIAL.

I have also considered the question put for?/ard in paragraph 3 of your telegram upon which you asked for my views as to whether the Shaikh should safeguard his rights by paying the amounts demanded from him by the ’Iraqi Government under protest. As the agents of the Shaikh have already protested vigorously to the ’Iraqi Government as represented by the Collector of Customs and Excise at Basrah, when paying the export duty demanded, I am inclined to think that no useful purpose would be served at this stage by the presentation of a formal protest by the Shaikh through me to the Ministry of foreign Affairs. Indeed, in view of the fact that His Majesty’s Government have not yet agreed that the operation of the istlhlak tax does violate the I 914 undertaking, and this question is now under the consideration of the Law Officers of the Crown. I am advised that such action might present possible dangers. I suggest, however, that on each occasion when the tax is paid, his agent should continue to protest in writing and to keep copies of such protests. In my opinion the written protest which has now been presented to the ’Iraqi Government is all that His Majesty’s Government can safely do to GHT HON’BiBS preserve/preserve the rights of the Shaikh until the opinion of the Law Officers is available. $.

M( COKT!’TT)J!?T r ’TAL. &lt; 6 I/* 4 ' My dear Metcalfe, As you will remember, the obligations of His Majesty’s Government in connection with the guarantee given in 1914 to the Shaikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah in respect of their date gardens in Iraq have been the subject of very considerable interdepartmental discussion and correspondence here. Pull details of such discussions and correspondence have been sent to the Government of India (and to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf) from time to time. -4s the result of the meeting with Sir Prancis Humphrys on 13th September 1932 and subsequent consideration it was agreedjin the end that certain points should be referred to the Law Officers. 2. Plie Law Officers were accordingly ultimately requested to advise whether, in their view, the imposition of the Istihlak tax on the produce of the date gardens in question involved any breach o^ the 1914 undertakings; whether, as a result of its imposition, any obligation rested on His Majesty’s Government to compensate the Shaikhs; and whether His M Majesty’s Government were under any obligation to compensate the Shaikh of Koweit in respect of any portion of the gardens in the possession in 1914 of Shaikh Mubarak o^/hich the present Shaikh might be deprived in consequence of a judgment of the competent Iraqi Coufcts. The Law Officers were also asked wh e the r/ Hon’ble Mr H.A.P. Metcalfe, C.I.K. , M.V.O 0- 2 - whether, for the purpose 8 of this last question, it was material to consider (a) whether any such judgment was based on the failure of the Shaikh of Koweit to register certain documents before the War, that failure having been admittedly due to the fact that His kbccellency, in accordance with the wishes of His Majesty’s Government y refused to declare himself a Turkish subject; and (*) whether any such judgment of the Iraqi Courts was or was not in accordance with the justice of the case (i.e. whether anv liability for compensation would arise in the event of His Majesty’s Government considering that the decision of those Courts was wrong). 3 0 I am now asked to let you know, for the confidential information of the Government of India, that the Law Officers, in the light of an exhaustive examination of the case as a whole, have expressed the opinion that the imposition of the Xstihlak tax by His Majesty’s Government while in control of the government of Iraq would haw been a breacn of the undertakings given in 1914 and that on this basis an obligation to compensate the Shaikhs for its imposition bv the present Government of Iraq rests on His Majesty’s Government; that in the event of the Shaikh of Ivoweit being deprived, in consequence of a judgment by the competent Iraqi Courts, of any portion of the gardens in the possession of his predecessor in 1914, an obligation for compensation rests on His Majesty’s Government, and that in regard to this matter the test would be whether the then Shaikh of Koweit was, at the date of the undertaking, de fadto in possession of the portion of the gardens affected by the judgment. 4 .

Your telegrams Noe.60 and 70 (of 27th April. Date gardens of the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Mobtainerah). First essential is to protect Shaikh of Kuwait from dispossession. This has now become paramount consideration. JJpart from serious damage to British prestige, dispossession might involve payment by His Majesty's Government of a very substantial sum in compensation, and Iraqi claimants might not rest content with ejecting Shaikh but might put forward claim (even if this should not prove enforcea&amp;ej to an account of all profits made by Shaikh from estate during period of wrongful occupation. 2. If Shaikh's title could be made secure, it is probable that His Majesty’s Government would agree to waive claim to tax exemption, and would arrange themselves to compensate both Shaikhs in respect of future taxation, provided that Iraqi Government for their part abandoned claim to arrears of tax and undertook to impose no discriminatory taxation on Shaikhs in future. 3. Every possible effort should therefore be made to induce Iraqi Government to va.lidate Shaikh's title by legislative or administrative act. Intervention by Iraqi Government is fully justified on grounds of equity, since, owing to a purely technical flaw in Shaikh's title, normal process of law would lead/■ t ^ - 2 - lead to grave injustice* Legislation to remedy position need not refer expressly to Shaikh of Kuwait but might take the form of general measure of validation similar to postwar United Kingdom legislation, (e.g.Indemnity Act and War Charges Validity Act)* Such an act would be in accordance with normal practice of nations and would be entirely consistent with principles underlying Part 8 of Iraqi Constitution. 4. I appreciate that Iraqi Government might find it more difficult to intervene in case of Bashiyah estate than in that of Faddaghiyah estate^ which was registered by responsible official acting in the due discharge of authority regularly conferred upon him during military occupation - see note to Article 114 in Hooper’s edition of Iraqi Constitution). But if at all possible Iraqi Government should be persuaded to redress miscarriage of justice in Bashiyah case also. 5. Unless you see overwhelming objection, please explore the possibility of an amicable settlement on the foregoing lines, making it clear in your discussions with the Iraqi Government that you are acting a titre personnel and M without prejudice”. While you alone can judge what arguments are most likely to prove effective, I suggest that you emphasize the desirability of disposing of this troublesome question, which may seriously affect the relations between the two Gove nments, tdTore King Feisal visits this country in June. Also you might state that His Majesty’s Government take so s eriqusy i ^ w of the question of possession that it is your personal opinion that, failing an amicable settlement, they may well feel compelled to refer the whole issue, including the question of taxation, either to the Council of the League of Nations or to The Hague under Article 10 of the Treaty; and you/-3- you might point out the unfortunate effect which this would have upon Iraqis international reputation so soon after her admission to the League of Nations. 6 . The question of the co-operation of the Shaikh of Kuwait in suppression of smuggling, in return for payment to cover cost of preventive measures, might be discussed at the same time, if you consider it advisable in interests of securing a settlement. Shaikh will presumably be more ready to co-operate if his grievances over date gardens are removed■NO DISTRIBUTION (E 2iby/50b/y3j. Cypher telegram to Sir F. Humphrys ^Bagdad).

I have taken up the matter in a personal capacity with Peisal and Nuri separately on following lines: I said urgency of settlement of obligations towards Sheikhs was emphasized both by imposition of sales tax and by recent attempt to dispossess Sheikh of Koweit from portion of gardens by legal action. If our gov ernments could not agree among themselves recourse to arbitration seemed inevitable but before advising my government to take this extreme step I proposed to ex plore final possibility of friendly settlement. I as sumed first that if obligations could be satisfactorily disposed of Iraqi Government would be willing to legalize past exemptions. My government were unable to fulfil their promise regarding continuance of possession with out assistance of Iraqi Government. I put forward short draft law which would have the effect of valididotdng Dobb’s grant of Tapu registration for Faddaghiyah I gardens. jl said if this law was passed and Sheikh was left in undisputed possession I would undertake to try to persuade my government to settle direct with the Sheikh about ©ompensation for taxation subsequent to 1932. I could not of course commit my government as ••••••2 /o' as if the case went to arbitration they would naturally press their claim that entire obligation devolved on ' Iraqi Government« i Nuri was not hopeful that legislation on these lines would be accepted by Iraqi Government. The King on the other hand expressed himself as very sympathetic to my proposals and promised to use his utmost en deavours to protect the Sheikh ox Koweit from being dis possessed of property acquired by bond fide purchase. As regards Bashiyah estate I fear payment of compensa tion is the only remedy. I will keep up pressure but it seems clear that the deal cannot go through before the King leaves for London.■xted that in any further commwu- s subject the under-mentioned letter ■ may be quoted, and the reply Secretary of State for India, Political Department, India Office, London, S.W. 1.foi &amp;*!

For the purposes of this reference, Sir John Simon thinks thst It my be •»«»*•* the Treql Oovernment would agree to the question being referred to the Permanent Court of International Justice, but as Iraq has not signed the Optional Clause, the reference would have to be bjr agreement*agreement and not by a unilateral written appli nation (aee Artiela 40 of the statute of the Court)* file terms of a ajjeoial agreement for thin purpose would of aourao be a mattar for negotiation with the Iraqi GoverniK ntj but before these negotiations are opened Sir John Simon would be glad to know whether* in existing circumstances* you agree with the f- ▼lew,-expressed by your predecessors In 1950 that any reference to the Permanent Court should* if possible, be framed in the widest possible terms so as to cover all the ground a on which It mliiht be held that the obligation-• to implement the undertakings given by His Hal^ jly’a Governs, at to the two Sheikha haa rf- devolved on the Iraqi Government. 6 . The question then arises whether thoae gr &gt;unua h va been affected th davelopmonta which hove occurred since 1930.

Sir, I have the honour to report that in a recent conversation which I had with Mr .Gabriel, the lega^ representative of His Sscellency the Shaikh of Kuwait in •Iraq, the latter gave it as his ver 2 _JEOsltlve_oEini°a that the 'Istahlak' Law had been originally introduced by the 'Iraq Government mainly in order to enable than to’get at' the Shaikhs of Mohammerab and Kuwait in the matter of their large properties on the Ghatt al Arab, which were exempt from taxation. 2. Mr. Gab riel was equally posjjlXg. that as soon thqy (the ’Iraq Government) could conveniently do so, j v.i n «n outcry agsinst themselves, without raising too bl S ^ o^ 01 ^ - especially from His Majesty's Government, they would revert again to the old Turkish system of Land Tax i.e. the ™ rs-r the crop system, vfriich used to be , Khums 1 or 20 % oj. the crop y tendme- crops by measurement, and on date assessed on standing ■* i , »T a rib T or acreage calculation, gardens by the Jarit ^ by me ^ to his reasons S# Mr.Gabriel ^en challengeo ■/ m -hp. «?uch a change, replied . „ t there would be such for assuming taiat n ^ ^ were definitely losing some (a) that the ’Iraq Government were (rupees) under the Istahlak sys an, 15/20 lacs of revenue P® rmp to lose this amount for , , nnc;Qiblv continue vo xu© and could not possi y(b) That they had foreseen this loss from the first, but counted it worth while, provided they could get the Shaikhs of Mohammerah and Kuwait to ’toe the line’ and pay taxes: (c) That he (Mr.Gabriel) had certain very good underground sources of information as to the Central Government’s in tentions, which had not yet played him false, from these he had deduced that the change would inevitably come. 4. Mr.Gabriel pointed out that His Majesty’s Government would do well to consider the above possibility carefully, if it were ever their intention to compensate the Shaikhs in question, by capitalising future revenues due, by giving them a lump sum down, the interest on which would go towards meeting their obligations to the ’Iraq Government. The foint being that under such plan it would be quite un fair to asses the future revenues due from the Shaikhs, on amounts paid under the Istahlak system, as this came to con siderably less (nearer half of what they would have to pay under the Turkish system of ’al Khums’, if the latter were reintroduced). The only fair calculation, said Mr.Gabriel, and the only acceptable one to both Shaikhs would be on the revenue that was paid to the Turks, receipts for wbidi were, in the case of the Shaikh of Kuwait certainly extant and carefuly filed. 5. Curiously enough the Shaikh himself mentioned the same thing to me sane 9 months ago, and at the time 7 I drew your attention to the matter. 6.

S.5912/308/93, erclssing a draft reference to the Law Officers about the date gardens of the Sheikhs of Koweit and hohemmerah. 2. We agree generally ( subject to any comments which the Treasury may have to make and the remarks that follow ) in the draft reference. But we suggest, in the light of comments hy our legal Adviser, that in lines 12-13 of paragraph 7, the draft as it stands gives perhaps an unnecessarily definite lead in one direction, and that it might he reworded to read rt in 1930, ana levied in a different manner. It is for consideration whether any contention based on the international status of tbe Sheikh could be supported in the case of 3. Is it not the case as regards the second part of paragraph 7 that the Sheikh has compromised his position only in respect of the Bashiyah property ? Lhe * Iraqis have not yet succeeded in effecting service on him in respect of the Faddaghiyeh property and if oui efforts to keep this case out of the courts were to prove fruitless ana it were to be necessary to advise the Sheikh to accept service in respect of it we should, I Uimk, Is aiop'^s^d, subject to the concurrence of the othei interootec. -i- -ments, to advise him to accept service onl^ ^peex.i -cally pleading and then waiving ( if the ’Iraqis refused to acc§pt : it ) a claim to exemption from jurisdiction on the ground of his sovereign status. His submission to the jurisdlotion in the case of tne Bashir&amp;ii oiay De ^ —- “ v an t • • • •2 . relevant• But it ,is an isolated incident which cannot in cur view carry weight of a long dealing extending over a course of years, much less operate as a har for ever from raising the question of sov ereignty. The modification involved in the draft would, of course, he a small one. 4. I am sending a copy of this letter to Woods at the treasury. Yours sincerely, sd/- J.G.WALTON. p k &gt; t dIHDIA OFj?ICE, P.Z.6861/33. M LONDON f S* w• 1# 26th October,1933. Dear Helm, would you kindly refer to your letter to Donaldson, No.E.4945/308/93, of theMth September, about the date gardens of the Sheikh of Koweit. I am very sorry that owing to great pressure of more urgent work I have not been able hitherto to deal with this. 2. be are glad to note from the letter in question tnat the Treasury are prepared to consider, without prejudice to the issue of principle, the basis on which compensation in respect of tax exemption could be paid in the event of compensation being ultimately agreed upon. 3. We agree in the first place with the opinion expressed by Humphrys at the meeting of 12th June that now that the Law Officers have aavised that a definite obligation rests on His Majesty's Government to compensate the Sheikhs in respect of any imposition of the Istihlak tax on the produce of those of their date gardens cove*ed by the undertaking of 1914 the payment made by His Majesty's Government/ A.K. Helm Esq., C.B.E., Foreign Office, Q • VV • 1 *Government eiiould be a sum directly related to their losses. 'P*\ T T / 4. Secondly, in considering the basis of compensation it seems important to bear in mind that the exemption promised in 1914 was in terms perpetual and without limit of time, or, save to the extent that it is confined to the descendants or Sheikh Mubarak of Koweit, and to 'yourself and for your successors from among your male descendants' in the case of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, of beneficiary. The Sheikhs of Koweit remain independent rulers, but the Sheikh or Mohammerah has relapsed into subjection to Persia and it is conceivable that he will have no 'successor' in the special and semi-independent feudal circumstances which we can, I think, reasonably claim to have had in mind in entering into the engagement of 19X4. This fact is relevant to the question of the basis of compensation which is discussed below. 5. For eonvehience, I ueal in the iirst instance With the position of the Sheikh of Koweit. , The main alternatives open appear to us to be (1) the payment -P-f-i-i t from time to time to indemnify annually of a sum suitiwi . r, T annual Daymen t which they may the Sheikhs in respecu oi a yhave to make to Iraq despite the obligations entered into oy us m 1914; His Majesty’s Government to remain liable tor such payments so long as the descendants of Sheikh Mubarak hold the gardens covered by the 1914 pledge. (2) A corresponding payment for the lifetime of the present bheikh only. (3) The capitalisation on the basis of the value of a perpetual exemption (? 23 years’ purchase or thereabouts) of the present cost of the exemption; and the payment thence annually to the Sheikh and his successors of the proceeds of the capitalised sum. (4) Payment to the Sheikh of an immediate lump sum representing the capitalisation referred to in (3), the Sheikh thereafter becoming liable for such taxation as the Iraq Government might impose on his property in common with other similar properties, and His Majesty’s Government’s obligation under the 1914 pledge being finally liquidated. The Foreign Office or Treasury may have further alternatives to propose and we do not suggest that the above list is exhaustive. 6. Woods at the meeting of 12th June made it clear that there would be strong Parliamentary objections to any annual grant and I think we should all agree as to this*/this. Xhe xnaia Of lice, i Lh i nh, i eel sti^ongly that having regard to the terms or the original grant we cannot, at any rate, in the case of t he Oheikh of Koweit, regard our obligation as discharged merely by the indemnifying of the present Sheikh during his lifetime in respect of demands of the nature covered by the 1914 pledge from Iraq.. The position in the case of the Sheikh of Mohammerah may be rather different. His expectation of life is probably very small and, as suggested in paragraph 4 above, the position may enable us with a clear conscience to regard our liability as discharged on his death. 7. Subject to further discussion with you and the Treasury we should, I think, at the moment rather be inclined to suggest that the best course in the case oi the Sheikh of Kbweit would be capitalisation on the basis of the value of a perpetual exemption and the payment thence annually of the proceeds to the Sheikh and his successors within the limius of the 1914 pledge. As was pointed, out at the meeting of 12th June there is some advantage in a procedure 01 tms nature. It avoids the necessity of returning to Parliament year after year for a grant to the Sheikh; and it gives us an ./an additional hold over the Sheikh, since if he behaves badly it will be open to us to withhold payment in any particular year. But it raises certain points which you will no doubt consider. The rirst is whether the capitalised value of a perpetual exemption is likely to produce a revenue markedly below the burden imposed at the moment on the Sheikhs in respect of Iraqi demands. As you know, the present scale of Iraqi taxation is relatively favourable to us, but it seems desirable that any arrangement we come to should, at any rate in the iirst year or so, fully meet the Iraqi revenue demands against the Sheikh. 8. Secondly,will such a payment be payable every year, irrespective, of whether the Sheikh in fact has to make any payment to Iraq or not? This point is not too easy. On the one hand the Sheikh can reasonably claim no*, uo have the worst of both worlds. In other words, if the annual Payment made to him is, say, for the sake of argument, fix, and his payment in three successive years -o the I 1 Government is fix plus 1,000, he could reasonably claim that if in the fourth year the Iraq Government abolished the tax altogether/altogether thei - e was some case i’or the continuance of 1 payment at the rate of £x 'by His Majesty’s Government for a certain further period. On the other hand, we do not, of course, wish to saddle ourselves with an indefinite payment in compensation for payments out by the Sheikh which he has in fact ceased to make. A iDossible compromise on this would he that Vv 7 e should inform the Sheikh that in the event of the Iraq Government ceasing to levy tax for a period say of 3 years consecutively, the question of the payment under our guarantee would need reconsideration. 9. As regards the Sheikh of Mohammerah, we can deal with the matter either on the basis of indemnification during his lifetime in respect of payments by the Iraq Government or, as in the case or the Sheikh of Koweit, on the basis of an annual payment based on the capitalised value of his exemption. But I think that, as at present advised, and subject to your views and those of the Treasury, should be disposed in this case definitely to favour re-examination on the death of the present Sheikh, since we do not regard his position as really analogous to that oi the sne ,,, 'hn-&gt;'pver. it would seem desirable if On general grounds, however, possible/ &gt;posoiole to treat him during his lifetime on the same 'basis as the Sheikh or Koweit without prejudice to a possible decision on our part on his death that he had no ’'successors’*, and that we could therefore regard our obligation as exhausted. In such an event, if he were dealt with on the basis of alternative (3) in paragraph 5 above, it is arguable that we might claim that the capital lump sum should revert to His Majesty’s Government* 10. I am sending copies of this letter to Woods. The suggestions made in it are very t entative in character and we shall no doubt need to consider the whole question more closely and in greater detail in consultation with the Treasury. But what is said above may provide a tentative basis for further consideration. Yours sincerely, j.

I have again reminded the Shaikh about the accounts he was asked to produce showing the amount of his losses under the Istahlak system during the last two years. For your information, he has promised to let me have them very shortly. The delay he said was due to his not having completed the sale of a quantity of 1933 dates, and to his having had to write to certain dhow owners, who had taken dates to India for their accounts.

                           Istihlak(consumption) tax has been imposed by the Iraqi Government on the produce of the gardens. British Officials discuss payment of export duty on garden produce from the Shaikh of Kuwait’s gardens in Iraq, and the allegations made by the Shaikh of Kuwait against the customs authorities at Faw.The British Ambassador in Baghdad reports that because of the enforcement of the new tax law, the Iraqi Government is no longer able to make exempt from taxes the Shaikh‘s gardens' produce that has been exported from Iraq for the personal use of the Shaikh.The volume includes a copy of minutes of a conference on the Shaikh’s date gardens held in Baghdad and minutes of an interdepartmental meeting held in London in regards to the gardens issue.The Political Agent, Kuwait, asks the Shaikh of Kuwait to provide full and detailed statements showing all payments and losses resulting from the imposition of Istihlak tax by the Iraqi Government.
