Dear Chancery, Will you pleaae refer to your letter No.238/4/46 dated the 15th February 1946? 2. As suggested by Sir Reader Bullard in his despatch No.31 of the same date, arrangements have been made for the printing of 50 copies of Lt. O.F. Magee 1 s report entitled n The Tribes of Pars' at the Government of India Press.British Consulate, Shiraz. The present work, which was written under my general supervision in the summer and autumn of 1945, is intended to be read in conjunction with the Report on Pars by Captain a.T. 7ils©n, C.F.G., (Simla, Government Monotype Press, 1916) and Report on the Tri't.es of ^ars by Captain .4. T. Christian (Simla, Government Monotype Press, 1919' both of which it in part supercedes. one respect, by omitting a survey of the Boir dhmedi In it differs from these two publications, rn he reason for this omission is that although part O ' 0 the Boir .Ahmedi summer ouarters lies within Pars official Persian contacts with the tribe have, since the transfer of the Farmandari or Behbehan from the p-ovine of Pars to that of Khuzestan, lain with Ahv/az rather than Shiraz. P°r the purpose of compiling the present work access was had to consular archives including reports made by sonu of the British military officers attached to the consulate in Shiraz as Liaison Staff from 1^49 to 1945. Thus the reports of Major P. Pow- ler,^Bla«k Watch, were the exclusive source for the sections on as for P'Tamassani and Poshmanziari and reports made by Captain T .R.Henry, Gordon Highlanders, were drav/n on for the sections covering the Baser! tribe of Khamseh, for Kordfchuli and for T ^ash- kuli T 'uchek of Qashoai. Reference was also made ' to of Captain O.C.Garrod. R.ii.I‘ n *.C, , v/ho was in mobile dispensary that operated in tribal territory 1943 and 1944, the reports command of a in Pars in It is possible that this is the’ last report on the tribes of Pars that will be compiled from British sources. Firstly because it is perhaps unlikely that British officials and officers will in future be available j/i sufficient numbers or will again have the opportunity of moving about freely in tribal territory. Secondly because evolution, either natural or imposed, will in— .vitally in the not distant future divorce the tribes from their migratory life and settle them, with a |onsequent loss of tribal Identity, permanently on the land.'\1 though called ’’The Tribes of Pars' this report does not cover the tribes of the Persian Gulf littoral. i f 'ranslite ration m he system of transitteration Arabic words adopted throughout the Persian Vowels ant Consonants of.

In ny case,in 1933, Soulat and Naser were put in prison from which Soulat never emerged alive. He died suddenly or was hilled there in 1934.

In Sentembe r* 1941. on the aodicati :»n of Reza Hr.a. the tribal situation in Pars,particularly chit cr 0 isheai.was suddenly 6) ing'id.

By 1942 the O.ash \ d were re-armed. The old fdudal system of control returned immediately. The members of the leading tribal families,who had been in exile or in poverty for ten years,resumed their Kalan t a r-shins and appointed or approved dhe Kadkho d; p of their trJ T ’il sub-sections. The migration was made in full -.ores once more; the settlements, which had been forced on the sub-iect:onspwero lar y ^ y abandoned; Qashqai tribal organization quickly res oneu tne fopm of 1911- Th r - - was,however,no 111 hani nor Iibegi. Naser Khan had returned as head of the tribe.. He refused submission to the Government; he demanded the settlement of his land claims err personal immunity fr nn arrest.

Tbe reasons for this ware &lt;a common 1 atref of the~arny and opposition to any disarmament measures. Further, the Khans v '' now got back to their old tribal way of lifr - levying taxes and paying none - and to their much-loved independence. Government offi bale no longer contm lied tribal affairs. One of Naser’s first steps was a defensive alliance wit! the T ~iir Ahmedi chief,Abdollah Targhampur,with whom he had been detained in Tehran. All the sub-tribes were united in thei^ opposition to Government control but by no means all wished Naser Khan to head the federation. / During 1942 and 194touring 1942 and 1943 the Qashqai looted and rob'd-; at will. This outburst of lav/lessness was tho reaction to the Government oppressions of Reza Shah’ time for the Qashqai is not a habitual thief, Naser Khan was variously referred to as rebel,a brigand and an outlay/. The army was too weak, to bre him and although his position was a threat to the Central Gov erxment he v/as left alone. At this time his tv/o brothers Malek Mansur Khan and Mohammad Hossein Khan were in Gemang, This fact, combined with the knowledge that a group of '-erman parachutists were being harboured by him and that lie h a pr-;pared a landing-ground at Farrfruhband made Nasebs pooiti n onetof opposition to the allies. ak In .late 1942 the Government decided h , t to attempt J :o oreaK has or Kh'in s power. In February of thu year General Sh£hbakhti was appointed to t^e command of the troops in Faro with instructions to begin eperr tions for the subduing and dis--*r armament of Gashqai and other dissident tribes.

TTaser incited General Pirns, Governor-General ■»f Pars, to be present but Piroz, although prex^ared to go as far as Abadeh to join them would not go outside his province and so (fortunately for tpin in view of his Q r meeting took place without him. One result of T/ uh Ruyeh was the consolidation of ITaser’s positior. among tie tribes and an increase in his preftoige throughout ‘Purs. Another was the rousing of Russian suspicions that thi a bloc in the south* A third that the Shah became alarmed and embarked on a policy of supplying arms to Pbooru Znrghampur to help him fight his half-brother Abdel 1ah B irghampnr so that one tribal problem - that of th Roir Ahnedi - might findf.'its solution in the rival sides killing off each other. ^ fourth, result was to bring the M spent ^orce” of n avam back into the political aren of Pars where he persuaded Rgser to join him in the dangerous precedent of ousting the Governor-General. Cn the credit side it has been claimed that iUih uyeh ensuied peace in Pars. But there is no reason to suppose that Na.ser and Morteza Ooli Khan would not have settled thei. rr^aor border disputes enually happily if they had not met at Kuh Ruyeh, that Neser would not have shown himself eauai.ly arxi 'us to keep Qashoal in order in their summer and v/inter quarters as well as on migration or that it would not have been egually easy to keep the Khamseh in order without the presence in nf Qavar attempting revive waned influence among th.un.

Naaer Khan Qashqai has, since his return to ^ars in 1041, serured for himself the position of head of the tribe. He holds no appointment from the Government, as Ilkh^ani (the post having been abolished in 1928) and his *nly official commission is his responsibility as Rn’is-e Entezamat for security in the eashgai ar o a. ^ — He enjoys rmreh of the authority and priv^iciiges and cl-ins the loyalty and 'prestige of the Ilkhani. Although he exacts no ^ offNtial dues from the sub-tribes he receives regular ^'ifts or ...cattle, horses, agricultural produce and possibly land fron leading subordinate khans over whom he can anti does exert lauc* authority. He directs the migration, orders changes in the pos ition cf tribal areas, appoints khans in the sub-tribes over whies he has close control, particularly the Sheshbcluki, and can in^most cases ensure the removal of undesirable leaders in the ot ^r cud— .tribes. It is probable that no command of Naser’s is ignored but that Naser tempers his commands so as not to strain such all&lt; gi as exists. How far Naser could carry the other khans with him in matters of external policy - c.g. combined resistance to uisa ent, allianoe with tribes such as Boir Ahmadi to resist tie Go/e ment and similar major Questions - is open to Question.t the dications a^e that if he tried he would fail. But the same circumstances that have produced the -emblance of U'nitjr in the Qashqai under Naser Khan might well s-°rv to bolster up Naser on occasions when his personal authority would otherwise inadequate. The attitude towards the Government of all th- tribes cf Ears, 'not only the Qashqai, is one of distrust. In the days of Peza Shah’s harsh mile a hatred cf the Government was bom that would quickly flare up again if the Government made any attempt to regain cantro3 ever the tribes. This distrust and lingering hatred he If • to consolidate the p*si ti‘4n of Nn.ser Khan so that h- is not pnly the snn of the loathed fcut respected Soulat^ ed Douleh and him self possessor of a strong personality but als© ’’leader of the resistance'. The attitude of the rrm-st important sub-tribes to Naser Khan is reviewed under each separate sub-tribe. 2, Organization, The organization of the sub-tribes - n*w only 15 in ^amb.r - under Nacec Khan is as follows: Only the four largest sub-tribes (Darrehshuri, Kashkuli, Sheshb^luki and Parsimadan) are of political importance: these four represent about 75 per cent of the total Qashqai population and their Khans have much influence in the handling of the internal and external .affairs of the tribe. The Amaleh section, numbering about 1,500 families, the personal following and bodyguard of Naser Khan and his fbmil v ~ the feudal lord’s retainers - and over them ITas^r Khan has complete personal control. The smaller sub-tribes - SafiCKhani, Yalemeh, Ga lehzan etc. - come under Naser Khan’s direct jontrol to a great/ r extent than the mom independent larger sections. ....Each sub-tribeprosperity which they* lost when,driven presumably by th old independent spirit, they resumed the migration. This partial abandonment,of agriculture combined with the necessity of carr ing on trade through rapacious agents and intermediaries and the difficulty of obtaining goods that are a Go'ernment monopoly am. the consequent resort to the free market is the prime cause for the generally low standard of living in Qashqai. Compared,however,with the Rhamseh and many of the sett led districts (e.g, Eetahbanat) of Pars,the Qashqai are fairly well-off. This results oartly from the proceeds of two years of plundering and rol®|ap&gt;dny ^ of whi«h the greater share went to the Ichans) and partly from the fa«t that 14,000 migratory u ashqai families are living in an area that formerly contained nearly 30,000 nomadic families. Further,Naser Khan and the p&gt;rincipal subordinate khans have for several years followed a policy of subsidising tie agriculture and stock-breeding of the ;&lt; orer sevt-uoms the trite. In many i&gt;arts of pashqai th; khans have ensured a regular supply of monojDOly goods to their people but in many others such supplies have been app' opiated for vrivat j profit.

The ^nans naturally make their profits on all trading in tribal produ. and receive regular gifts in kind from their following. The Government therefore receives no taxes from the tribe apart from those levied on goods going to market. The nhans evep. more than the ordinary Persian lanadlord, luanagd t- eVidtp ey ing taxes on their properties. KELATIONS WITH NEIGHBOURING TRIBES. In their summer quarters the Qashqai have as their neighbours the Boir Ahmedi in the west,the Bakhtiari jn the north, the Arabt and Baseri of Khamseh to the east and in the south the Kpamasb.yii, In the winter quarters they are bordered ’^y the Baseri,Mamassari ,Doshmanziari and the Kuhgalu tribes of-dBRsht- pud Bavi. The attitude of the different sub-tribes of ashaaito these neighbouring tribes varies and napticular.’referen?e is made to this subject in the analysis of each suh-tribt under the heading ’'Relations with Neighbours”. In general re ations are as follows: The Boir Ahmedi and Qashqai are bound by a pact to unite in resisting Government attack. In the oime of pc.... Shah Naser Khan and Abdollak Khan Zarghampur, the Inir .,hmed i chief/ were both under decenTion in Tehran and they made their escape from the capital at about che Sfime time. The tw chiefs seem* personally loyal enough to the terms of their pact but the extent to which the tribes would follow them,if called upon ; do so,is doubtful. Robberies and counter-robberies,wit' t,r Boir Ahmedi as first offenders,are continually occurring b'fv i the two tribes but seem to be settled amicably. / The Cyishqai and Khams^hviewed. Ml aovemnent officials are vith suspicion and aversion,an attitude the ^ash-^ai «an on.i.y afford to auop openly 'because of the weak state of the (rove ’raviont roes.

The policy of enlisting the support of’onc_tribe to disarm another,should it ever be contemplated,would call for the employment of a loss corrupt class of Government ofiicial uhan is available* The professed Qashqii attitude to disar inen^ is that th y will not surrender their arms without a struggle unj-oss^ they receive guarantees of security and freedom f rom op]., res si n from the British as 'well as the Persian -overnmert. ’hey recognise that the enances of receiving such guarantees are remote and consequently continue to re-arm,in a haphazard and possibly ineffee iv : manner,in preparation for an eventual clash with the army. THE FEO#LE. As there ax-e considerable differences in the appearance and the physical characteristics of the different sub-tribes of Qashqai this aspect is dealt with under the eppropiate suh- tribal heading, KHdNS, The 'lashqai khans,as a m.le,li\e close to tbeir people and are attended by a personal following* They live In more luxurious surroundings than,and enjoy many r f the tr rts of life denied to,the ordirary Iribesman.

In his dr°lings with the Gov#mme^t and his other 4 enemies moral considerations have no part. It is the custom of the ruling families,from whom the khans are ©hcscn,to intermarry and Naser Kaa,. is strongly in favour of maintaining this tradition,even among bis own family. / The worn of the khan’s22 The wonen of the khan’s family enjoy a position near ing equality with the men an I monogamy is a strict rule. The veil is not worn, 'The Tashqai women seem to he endowed with intelligence,dignity and. sensibility above the average Persian woman. Sons of the khans are pampered but at about 8 years they,in company with the other tribal boys,learn to ride and shoot and quickly bccomo accustomed to the vi^rous nomad life. The khan,who is generally literate nowadays,sees that,where- ever possible,his son picks up reading and writing in the nearest village school or from one of the educated members of the sub-tribe. Tribal b*ys a re frequently sent to school in Shiraz or Tehran* 2. THE TRIBESMEN. /-.Ithough the general standard of livin • is lower than that of the villager,the Qashqai nomad is,in every way, a ‘etter man loan his settled compatriot* his hard and vigorous -^fe makes him healthy and free from the man} diseases pre valent in the villages and gives him a-strong,tou .. physiqut that is rape outside the tribes. Many of the customs and characteristic* peculiar to certain sub-tribes are mentioned elsewhere. In general tribes men are cleanly and healthy in their mode of living sin^ight- foTward and h^nes't in tbeir dealings with one another and werk well together They allow none of their own people to go without ass'.ctancs when it is necessary atii tney avoid, quarrels, flood feuds and the like are almost non-existent in ^aihqti. Towards -strangers and other tribes they show litil 3 respect although the tradjtion of hospitality ensures a warm reception for^any visitor wh 1 has an introduction,either persona^ or by letter. They rot and plunder from other tribes and travell ers but .when accused by their cnief confess freely and take their, punishment. The visitor need have no fear of any of his belongings being missing uhtn he leaves a ‘'ashqai camp? thefts of that nature arc unknown. It mo t parts of ashqai the mn cho( sc their wives freely and brokerage in marriage is forciwgn to th Q m.

Later dnring the Afghan invasion the Qezei Bash we re forced to abandon their villages at Vardasht and retreat into the mountains. The ruins of their burned villages can, it is stated, stil n be seen. The tribe appears to have joined the Qashoai at the time of Kerim Khan Zand, It does no “ -n pear to share the uas? uai origin but to have joined the main group in recent times. HISTORY During the operations in south-west Persi i in 1918, the D'arrehshuri under Ayaz Khan Kikha were actively hostile to the ■ritish. .hen Sardar Dhtesham (Saigham ed Donl-h, elder half- ■fcrotlK 1 of Soulat ed Douleh, fa dier of Laser Khan ^asuq i) b'•ame I±] ''■ani, .‘iyaz Khan sup^-orted hir .at first, then later transferred his allegiance to f oulat ed i &gt;uleh (Sardar Ashti'tr' again. In 19S0 All Panah Kikha, an opponent of Sou-let ed Douleh, with Nas- rol l.'.h Khan, took a latge section of the yribe off to Bakhtiari. On the death of Ayaz. Khan in 19his son &lt; .ossein. Khan became chief of the tribe.* He assisted thw Government troops in operations against ‘the T 'oir Ahmedi and later the Rostam section of Hama^sani. In 1930 .the tribe joined the Qashoai revolt against the Governn nt, Hossein Khfth was removed to Tehran in 1930 and was killed there in 1934, Thereafter until 1941 the Parrehshuri wro passive under the exto;rti*«ns and harsh treatment of Government officials, in l n 3 r the. tribe was forced to turn loose a gr at hunber o^ anim- 1 ^ wb r n :hey were held up by the ^rmy v/hen returning ter*their • inter quar ters. As a result thousands of mimals (the reputed ‘ilgure - 5,000 horses and 12,000 sheep - is an • nagger 1 • -ion) were ^ost^ i The Darrehshuri quickly profited by the confused situation that followed the abdication of Reza Shah and have .since rapidly r gained their strength. In 1942, .on their way to th. winter eu■ rt rs : , part of the Darrehshuri was intercepted y the Army near Kam Firust a scuffle followed in which fou&gt;- soldie r-.. 9 women and childrefi, 'two horse men and.^everal hundred sheep .e^re killed. ^&gt;ciser Khan, on his return t - ■ epasheai, me ^ much opr^osi t ion v lied rather than open, from .th. djarrehahuni but after the first months the khans ~*once^led their.reso ntment of his preset ' and they have since appeared ta■support him effectively/ The +ribe \vras .yery prominent ;at the Semirom battle with the Arrr.y in ^.943 - Zaki 1 nan gives the figure -of his men invclve-.d as 800 - *nd it’ was •,h^ Darrehshuri who held up the convoy at Mehr-e Herd prior to the engagement. Since then, coop, rating in Laser Khan’s policy ef security throughout the Qashq'ai area, the tribe has b$en w-ll-be- haved and has indulged only in petty thieving.

Even the venal rule of Reza Shah’s officials md Iocs os of livestock in 1937 did not seriously weaken them. The sale of animals and the products of the flocks are the main source of income but wheat, barley and fruit, produced in the summer quarters are also marketed on . considerable scale. ... Various wov.n carpets.Various woven carpets mats, saddlebags, etc. are produced mainly for home use but many find their way to the town bazaars* Purchases are mainly of monopoly goods, leather goods and domestic articles. The main markets are Isfahan, where most of the sale of live stock takes place as the animals are in better condition in the summer quarters, and Shiraz. S: me trading is also done in Pehbehan, (inch S_aran, Basht, Kazerun, Prdekan and Shahreza and there is barter ing with neighbouring tribes. Dues are only paid to the onvernrent in controlled market centres, • , ' No accurate information is available of the ‘mount paid in taxes to the khans.

RT LPTIONS WITH NEIGHBOU RS The neighbours of the Darrehshuri are as follows • in the . winter quarters Kashkuli Bozorg Bakesh and Rostami liamasaani, Tir ^a.ji, Ba^vi and Boir . hmadi Harmsiri, hoa . T a.ri and Lira.vi. Jn the summer quarters : - Narsinadan, Chehar Nah^l hakhtlari and - r ane];i Sardsiri. h common anti-government f' ^ling tends to develo^&gt;, superf iciaT ly at least, good relations between the tribes. Such relations are strain -ed during the migration periods when the Darrehshuri cross the Pavi, Nomassani and Doshmanziari territories. Their frequent robberies and incursions make the Darrehshuri very unpopular with their Cheharmahal neighbou rs. THE PEOPLE There is a wide variety type among the Darrehshuri : the usual dork, lean, hawk-face, alternating with fair faces with broad features. Health is excellent, malaria rare, venereal disease unknown and trachoma occasional. Tribal dress is worn r )ro among the Darrehshuri than am ng other Qashqai sub-tribes that have greater contacts with the towns. The shepherds and poorer trib sr n -e verv badly clad and usually wear only a.tattered shirt and trousers covered with a rough wool - felt coat. . bove ail other ^ar ’ i sub-tribes the Darrc 1 shuri are not c for their fighting a-d ( '-ring. ey are keen hunters. is little opium-sin 'king. The tribesmen speak a mixture o-r ' r ^-5 Persian but almost all can speak the latter as well. r ' 1 heir religion is Shi’ah Islam. Outwardly the I’ irr ^hshuri ar dovout compared with their Kashkuli neighbours. So far as the youths of the tribe are concerned, education is still in Its infancy,, although some have learnt to read and write and some attend school in the. towns. Exports exceed imports.

A section of them that continued the migration lost many animals when held over winter in the summer quarters by the Army in 1932 . In the summer of 1939 a mysterious illness afflicted the family of the kalantar and f members of his family died.in the soace'of six da vs - Hossein Qoli Khan (father of Amir Teinur\ Ami* Khan, Saftar Khan and Elias Khan the son of Sa^tar. The tribe suspected foul play. T 7ith a reputation for loyalty to the IlkharH tbp Sheshboluki ayyarentlv declared th~ir allegiance to Ttaser Khan on his return In 1941. 'Amir Teimur Khan, the kalantar, loses no opportunity of re seating that Naser Khan has whole-he a reted Shesbboluki suj port. This however is far ■erom accrnrate '‘or other tribal khans resort Naser Khan's assumption of power, his administrative methods and hTs obvious desire for personal advancement and gain. Hut it is true that since his return Naser Khan has kept the Sheshboluki under closer personal contro'; than almost any other section of Qashoai except Amaleh. Some of the khans appear to lean towards Ali Khan Salar Heshmat. brother of Soulat ed Douleh, but Naser Khan certainly commands the allegiance of the ka lantar , ^mir Teimur. Since 1941 the Sheshboluki have grown in numbers to become the largest sub-tribe of Qash M ii. They are not so influential as the Darrehshuri nor Is Amir Teimur as wealthy, powerful or respected as the Darrehshuri khans The Sheshboluki have not been involved in any clash with the Government since Naser Khan's return and have gained for themselves a reputation for respectability. This probably means that they have'indulged in petty theft rather than mass plundering. They occasionally steal sheep, _oats and household goods frou their KhamF'eh neighbours but their disputes are settled through the re spective authorities and not by fighting. The Sheshbjluki are well spoken of by the rest of the ^ashgai tribes who say that they are ... indu s.triousCo PHYSICAL (a) V/lnter Q;i ar ters The She.hhol.kl «»^«sr»t,rw SSlTAS sssk S'^rie^erSef 'hl'S.rth,™ .eilon (.Tereeh, and f^aps in the nonntains, the altitude f ^owh-nd^ and Barr^h mteadily as the Culf coast is approached* Farrashh.nd and Barren Jf rinn ei. 9 000 ot • Khun, Talhak and Lavar 1,000 ft,, ^rhurmnj and Shomfeoh near sea level. ost. of ^ + , _' In appearance but some have trees.

It includes the Baba Sheikh Ahmad plain 20 miles in width, stretching north from th~ Sheikhan stream to I \hmanzad r v -6 e . The surface of these plains is uneven, covered with scrub and gum C* tragacanth. There are many springs near the flanking hills and torrent beds are frenuent. The Sheikhan stream is perennial.

An alternative Tine used since 1941~is Khan-e Zenia.n - Famur - Farrashband - dispersal. PRGANIZATI'N the 'head of the Sheshbmluki is Amir Teimur Khan. Le is ^r^ry much Naser Khan’s tool and the tribe is therefore largely Refilled by Naser Khan.* Amir Teimur Khan is of the family that hae held the kalantar-shlp ‘Sheehboluki ft&gt;F many years (see Appen- fix II). Under Amir Teimur the khans of the sub-sections keep the sub-tribe in fair order. Although Anir Teimur is far from generally popular, and Naser Khan still less so among the junior khans, cri ticism is never open as llaser Khan could oul ckly get rid oh any ch&amp;ef he disliked in Sheshboluki. The system af holding the heads of sub-sections responsible for the behavious of their people operates in Sheshboluki as it does throughout Qashoai. In the case of Sheshboluki many of the khans of sub-sections are wealthy and semi-indeyendent• four cf the sub-sections of Sheshboluki (see ANALYSIS OF SUB-SECTIONS) number over 700 families and the kadkhodas enjoy the position and wealth of the average kalantar. Income is derived largely from the flocks. Less of the K'n”fa~inoome Is divert** by the kil.mtar and his family and the standard of living in the sub-tribe is considered to &gt;e high for Qashaai. Amir Teimur and the rest his family are poor anr un- ianded by Qash~ai standards. ECONOTTC Th^ Sheshboluki are «aid to possess bhe greatest y/'-alth in flocks of all Qashnai. During Reza Shah's reign the group that settled in the winter * quarters seems to have managed to keep up its numbers and maintain its economic standing. The number of families was estimated at 4,-5,000 in 1918 which is similar to the &gt;11946 fi&gt;rure. Only in the summer quarters do the Sheshboluki «? any large-scale farming and the sale of wheat, barley and fruit ^orms a very small part of their tribal income. General living conditions are the highest to be found in any oash'eai sub-tribe. The subordinate khans are as a rule better dressed than their equivalents in ether sub-tribes and are reputedly n3 t rapacious. The tribespenple are more prosperous and healthy- loeking than any others in -ashpai. They are industrious , have incomes above the average and spend freely. Their income formerly depended largely on the Yezd market to v/hich tlv- Sheshboluki were accustomed to take Uv ir flocks ^*r sale and barter in exchange ^or cloth, tea, supar and household p-c~ds Isfahan also was a market for their ^reduce. Naser Khan Stoured this trade on the grounds that tb f ' tribe’s economy should be confined to the province of Pars wit* the result that they turned fer trade to Eglid, Ahadeh and Shiraz. Several sub-sections of Sheskbdluki, particularly Haibatlu and Kuhi. are famous for their rugs. These are mostly for home use many find their way into the bazaars. ...Salestribe, '.’he total of r ',6f'0 fanilies , 'iven bv ’ T :iser Khan cun „ (l0v/n fc y comparison with Information from other'eon roes to minimum total of* 4 # 0&lt;^0 T\omadlc families, 1 4 Th , e , r P aee P r ' ohnbl y as many as 5,000 fi-htinp 1 men in r.hesh- Hansn^ Khan, brother of Naser Khan, makes the mich - O' 0 ^,000 fighters, 'Che Sheshboluki tribesmen apo ir i8l o Sis w assem *&gt;ltnp- for Hattie and it is unlikely that rn^re than ^,00n fighting men could mustered from the tribe at one time, nn a h„ , The . number of- rifles held by Sheshboluki (as by every othr-r and l oor^'^ln^ la dlfflCT,lt to °aloul*te. fOO modern rif?cs estimate “n^t^o 01 V w f apo !?? can be taken as a very conservative 1 0 Rn^ t * „ L tbl reckonin 5 the Sheshboluki would be able to r.ut l,-600 amedcfighting men into the field. ;AN^LY 3 I£ 0 T - SlfB-Si^CTinTIS Vnor^ o in the tNallowing table are the n.'jme.s of all the fami^l 2 f Sh ^hboluki, together wit: the number of 1 2 ® ach sub-seotihn and its winter and summer carters.

Since the return of Naser Khan th Farsimadj.n, alt’nough professing loy'ilty to him, have giv n him little r al supprrt. They were poorly represented in + he f 1 ;■ ting for '’iruz^bad and later aL Semir jn. They took thw oppor /unity of looting freely in the J rreh district. During the //inter 1943-44 they were accused o' rofb ry and petty thieving as ^ar north as Khar-p Zer fan. ^hey g ive moral s/: pert at least tc the brigand A Ta Jan Dahli who operated the Kemarej area. Sin^e the si ^render of Ana_ Jan little has 1 ^n heaed 0 f Them and they hav- not been guilty of any crime gr- at-r than routin' pilfering and sheep-stealing. The Farsimadan have little importance. They are small in numbers and the fac that they are poor may account for their tad reputation for theft. Ziad Kh m Darrehfthuri has r t T ted that given smpprm by the British the Farsimadan would combine with the Ka/h- kuli and D rrehshuri against Fas' r Khan. There are however no in dications of this dissension in the tribe where the khans, particu larly Z°rir K v m, declare thei'-* loyalty and all/giance to Nas^r Khan.

The original Pmaleh yronp of tribespeople has devel oped in the las- thirty y^ars into a much larger and less well defined cmylomcration. Its history is the history of many of the sub-tribes of .ashpai that v/ere on 'te imp ortant units but have n^w been reduced to x &gt;verty or dwindled in number.

A great variety of types is to be found in the diff erent su^f-tribes so that the Imaleh,as a whole,have no well- defined appearance.habits or characteristics. STRdNGUL In th( following analysis the strength of ^maleh is given as 9.095 families. Taking into consideration the number •f settled people in each sdb-tribe md the fact th.t some of the suB-tribos are almost entirely engaged on agriculture it is estimated that net more than 4,000 families Ian be reckoned aj truly nomadic. The rest may be considered to have cut their ctnnex.ions with fashoai to such an extent that they are no 1 nger interested in the tribes survival as an independent body. Force rf circumstances and their habitat obliges them to owe nom inal allegience to Naser Kh .n. The Timaleh tri 1 es - or at least these that migr ite in company with Naser Khan's h-cusehcld - are better armed than any afh&amp;h^youp in Qashqai, It is estimated that there are about 890 modern rifles and 1,600 oldir wAaptaie am«ng the . maleh. Of these ^os.aibly 2,000 are in the possession )f the mi ratory sec tions and the rest are held by settled groups for security pur poses.

Mohammad Ali Khan, father of Kliae Khan, particularly distinguished himself and Mohammad Khan, father of Jehangir, died of wounds received in the fighting .against the Qashoai* Consequently when he again had close control over the tribe in 1921 (Naser Khan being officKl Ilkhani) Sou lat took his revenge on Kashkuli S-v detaining the khans who had sided against him in the fighting (ir.dueling 1' ; .t.as and Jehanjir), ippbinted his own puppet khans and deliberately set out to bre ik u- ana im^Cv jr— ish the K'.shkuli tribe. The Kailhkuli have never really recovered from this period of oppression. In 1921 certain Kashkuli khans (Alias,Atol Path, Kadi, Arde- shir and Pathollah) concluded an agreement with the A. 1,0.0., whiuh v/as operating in the Bikarz area, by which the Kashkuli were paid for the use of the land and for the provision of guards, Soulat ed .Douleh', however, with the support of the Minister of War, had this agreement cancelled and himself signed a new one with the This in turn was cancelled when his puppet K q-ntars , Gholam Herein md Esfandiar Khans, incited an’attack on the ,-.1.0.0. officials in the area. Turing the.1930 QashGpti revolt the Kashkuli took part in the fighting against the- Government: alias Khaa was prominent in the en counter at. Pol-e Khan near Mervdasht. As a result Alias and Asfandiar Khans were exiled. In Reza Shah’s time the tribe was faced with three alternatives: settlement in the sumrier (quarters, settlement in the win ter quarters or the payment of ’ m u i ;e bribes to corrppt Government offi cials, If they adopted the first course their flocks would die off -in winter; If the second they would face ruin in summer in the blister ing heat of the arid Mehlatun region. They were thus forced to pay the bribes and this, combined with the effects of Ooulat ed Douleh’s oppression, impoverished the tribe: - The khans lest all their power and many fell into debt.

KHArS^F five f*pib#s”, m h«se five of the T ^honeeh groux&gt; # the Nafar tribes. To then have large anr* small, that have under the jurisdiction of the additions are tribes that were INTROfTTCTION The name Khamseh implies 'the tribes are the five original members Arab, Baser!, Ainalu -u Baharlu and been added a number of oth«r tribes, been placed or have voluntarily oome Clovernor of the Khameeh, The later formerly indepdndent or attached to other main groups such as ^ash— qai but finding difficulty in managing their affairs or being un able to maintain thoir positions in the face powerful neighbours have attached themselves to or been grddually incorporated in the Khamseh administration. The 'five tribes' number roughly 60,000 souls and the tribes attached to them an additional 10,000, The Governor of Khamseh therefore controls Mahout ^0,000 tribesmen. HISTORY 25 ^ears ago the Khamseh group were Oavarn ul Hulk’s 'people'. But even at that time he took little active par + in the administra tion of their affairs and was reckoned to have little real author ity over them. Since then Oavam and the Khamseh have drifted still further apart and only after the entry of the allies into Persia did they show signs of coming together again, Puring Reza Shah’s reign the Khamseh were administered by a series of Military governors and there is little doubt that had Pahlevi not fallen all connexion between the Qavam family and Xhomseh would have been finally se vered, In 1922 Qavam lost the right to take taxes from the tribe and he has not since/asserted it, / re- Treatment of the various tribes of the Khamseh varied during the reign of Reza Shah, The Baser!, Ainalu and Nafar were to sorrre extent left to themselves on condition that migration ceased, Sec^ tions af the B^seri impoverished themselves by paying bribes to Government officialq so as to continue their' migratienj^.and other sections settled into comparative prosperity. The three small settled tribes, Ainalp:, Baharlu and ITafar, suffered only a few of of corrupt officialdom. The Arab tribe who have settlement were forced to abandon the migration, state of self-martyrdom and made no effort to get the land they'farmed which was some of the finest continued indulgence in lawlessness brought them with the Military Governor .and they suffered arbitrary the hands of the Army, They did not however at any the oppressions an antipathy to relapsed into a the best out of in Pars, Their into conflict punishment at time suffer any oppression comparable to that meted out to Qashqai. The reason for this was that the KHamseh never presented threat to Government authority or to the security of the province nor had they the political impnrtjtance of the Qashqai, The Army therefore dird not consider it ncessary to kick them while they held them down. The total strength of Khamseh decreased from*about IT,000 families in 1918 to 14,000 in 1045 . The settled tribes who number roughly two fifths of the Khamseh total alt^ou^h not prosperous have largely lost their love of tribal indep.-rndunae and it is almost true to say that they are part of Khamseh in n tme only since their attitude to tribal affairs is that of settled peasants in a tribal area, ..•Reza ShahReza Shah carried ont an almost complete disarmament of Khamseh who remained disarmed until 1941 1 The inclination to TiJg v/as never as strong in Khamseh as in Qas^oai and Khamseh are not commonly described as a warlike tribal group* Thus the disarmamen did not have the effect of partially taming a v/arrior band but i forced the tribesmen to resort to sticks and stones when engagea in rebbefeis and hold-ups for which they have not lost their tns e* The khans of the Khamseh tribes with fev/ exceptions wc. re not detained or arrested during Reza Shah f s time* They remained ^ in control of their sub-tribes at the loss of much-of their authoi* rity and of the privileges of their position* But in mort cased they were sensible enough to obey the instructions of the Military Gov ernor and so kept out of trouble* Although they and. their people chafed under the irregularities of Government control they did not become hostile to the Government or harbour the resentment, hostility and hate of officialdom that smouldered in qashoai for twenty years. In 1941 ther^f^re when the sudden collapse of Government control allowed them to return to their former ways thoir first thought was not of preparation ^or battle with all outside autho rity. They saw the tribes around them rearming and. decided to rearm themselves, m his they did chiefly hy unearthing old -weapons. buying in the open market and , to a lessser extent, by snuggling, buying from Army deserters and theft from th p disorganized troops. m hey thus acquired about 1,500 good modern rifles with which num ber it is believed they have remained content. With the relaxing of Government authority the khans of the sub-tribes of the main Khamseh tribes regained their old positions v/hich are those of petty feudal chiefs. Kalantar - ship once more became a profitable business and each khan had his hand of armed follov/ers. V/ith the exception of a very few sub-tribes th§ Arab and Baseri resumed the annual migration, as in 1918 the Khamseh were Teaderless; the only leader they could recognize, since there was no Ilkhani, was Qavam ul Mulk and him they professed to accept. The Khamseh did not unite either in opposition to V a Govern ment or as a defensive measure tov/ards other hostile tribes but all the tribes declared their readiness to oppose any expansion «rr aggression by the Qashqai and their *-associates. The five tribes returned independently to their former way of life and the Arabs and Baseri in particular reveretd to lawless ness, In 1942' and 1943 hold-ups on roads in the Kh'meeh area, inter-tribal raids and rbbberies, general insecurity and banditry v/ere rife. As it was only a minor anxiety to the Army and Gendar merie v/ho were more occupied with the open hostility and armed superiority of Qashq.ai this sta&amp;e o^ affairs continued unchecked. The Military Governor^ appointed to Khamsoh. Amir Sadri and Razm.1v&gt;. made use of their authority to amass considerable fortunes, appoint ed and dismissed a number of minor unscrupulous khans and. as far as they dared* let the five tribes go their own way. in IG 44 . with the easing of the Qashoai situation Government control on the roads of Pars was tightened up and hold-ups and robberies much reduced, Interhal strife in Khamseh v/as unchecked end villagers throughout the Khamseh area suffered their depredations and pillagings Y/i th ou t much hope of Government intervention* 1944 saw the appoint ment of a Civil Governor to replace the Military Governor of Khamseh. Sahebdivapi, a close relative of qavam, was chosen. His incompe tence did nothing to improve conditions in Khamseh and lawlessness and internal troubles continued on a little reduced scale. In 1945 Lotfali Qayami. Amir Arfa. a'nephew of Qavam, was appointed as Supervisor ( sarparast ) of Khamseh. Sahebdivani lost his appointment at Amir Arfa 1 s insistence and became Amir Arfa’s unofficial assistant. It is very unlikely that the Govornor- ..,G^nepal-General would hsve appointed any man to thxS poat who was not approved of by Qavarr ul Mulk and ho was fortunato in his choice of Amir Apfa, Tindei- hij just and able administration the Khamsey progressed noticet'oly towards prosperity and foeority,. ■ i Sin le 194i no taxes .hav^ been x&gt;iloctsd from Khamseh and this is said to o bec&amp;Ude of the benevolence of Qavam ul Mulk* It is not Cxoar nowever how taxes could be collected fbom the tribespeople if it were even uesired since the Government is un able to col_i.eci them from the settled population of the province.

PHYSICAL The large area occupied by the ^hamseh tribes is described district by district under the various tribal headings. In general it consists of (i'' the high plateau and valleys around Dehbld in t*-^ north and the Mervdasht plain (ii'' the sparsely populated va.leys in the Abadbh Tashk and Niriz regions in the north-east and (iii) the hot,dry pTains and low valleys of the ^asa, Jahrom, . T uyom f D^rab, Furg,and Lar districts in the south and south-east. Area (i) oom/ises the 6 ,ono f Pehbid plateau with the valleys to west and east which run in a general north-west to south-east di rection. These are separated by hicf' and sometimes precipitous ranges of mountains/connected from north to south by the Isfahan- /and arc/ Shiraz road and a number of difficult, elevated passes passable Only for animal transport. These valleys include those of Ahmadabad, 1 ord- shul and Qeshlaq-e Dehbid to the west of the main road and those of Bavanat, Bagh-e Siah, Khafrak and Araenjan to the east. The Merv- ’dasht plain, watered by the Kur River and its tributary from the north, the Polvar, runs eastwards between ridges of steep hills from Ramjerd to the Tashk salt lake. It varies frcm 10 to 16 miles in width and is dead Area (ii) is made up of the settled ^b_^deh Tashk, Uiriz and Estahbanat districts through which a few sections ofthe Khanseh pass on migra 11 an(an&lt;?/.where some smaller sections are settled''and the bar ren mountains to'the north and north-east which are watered in winter by a few springe and streams and become a wilderness in summer. In general the valleys run south-east becoming more barren as they s^ope dewn to the S^rjan depression* In the narrow plains to the irmrediate north-east of Abadeh Taohk there is - more water and the Lashani and Cheharrahi tribes, attached to Khamseh, graze their flocks here throughout the year. Area (liO in which all the five tribes spend the winter is only very roughly mapped and partly^red. In the north-west a number of deep, high-walled valle^c run'South-eastwards -erom SMraz towards Fasji, the centre of the area. In the north a high range of mountains forme the boundary with a narrow pass giving access to Niriz, Estahbanat and the wilderness beyond. This range extends eastwards into the unmapped mountain mass north-dast of Dpirob. ly&amp;edlately south of this range, in the west, is the Fasa-Jahrom pll.in and in the east is the Darab valley. The Rasa and Dar_ab plains are connected by a series~~of narrow passes and valleys. The Fasa - Jahrom plain is a great stretvh of undulating country broken by a few low ridges and hills and watered by wells and water-channels frwn the springs in the surrounding hills. It is a very; fert^le area. The Darab district is no less fertile and is a flat valley hemmed in by very- high mountains. It is water^ hv streams and irrigation chann els which have-their sources and une mountains. South and south-east of these three fertile areas, Fasa Jqhrcm and Darab, is a more barren region* It consists of two great flat plains,“one, in the n^rth-east, about 800 feet above the level of the other, in the ®outh-west. They are divided by a ridge of mountains running from Jahrom south-east just north of Juyom to the mountain mass north of Lar. Both pi Uns become parched in summer and «way from the few sells the land beco' es a desert. After the winter rains grass nd small plants spring up and provide grazing for tribal sheep and goats. The plains are bound.-e4 to the south by the parallel ridges and valleys of the mountain/ around Lar ..and toand to the east by the barren mountain mass around Fung. .4. CLIMATE AND AGRICULTURE Throu^houttfhe northern of the Khamseh territory a severe winter confines agricultural pursuits to warmer seasons. In the valleys around Dehbid it Is impossible to keep livestock in the open after November and there is in general no winter crop ofi cereals north of Slvand. The Khnfrak and Arsenjnn valleys and the Mervdasht plain in the Centre lie lower and have a milder winter. Although coaroely any members of the Khamseh tribes spend the winter here, there is a considerable settled population which reaps a winter crop of cereals and vegetables. Even these mild valleys, the Arab and Baseri claim, are too ^ccld for the flocks in v/inter, In winter therefore the Khamseh nomads are to be found in the southern section of their territory where they graze their flocks, produce crops of cereals, beans and peas, opium etc. These crops grow mostly on lands owned by the khans but farmed by the native Persians and not by the tribesmen# The latter keep almost exclusively to their livestock. In summer this southern area is one of the warmest parts or the province. The surface water very soon dries out. The old Irrigation systems still visible in the south and east have been abandoned and little effort is now made to bring this very fertile soil under cultivation. Except near the few wells where villages cluster the plains are nearly deserted in summer. Around Fasa w , Jahrom and Barab landlords from Shiraz have bought up the fertile tracts and the heavy props of rice, wheat, barley, oranges and dates which are produced there in summer ^re not a factor in ^hamseh economy. In summer the nomadic sections of Khamseh take their flocks to the cool, 6,000 ft. valleys in the north. The climate there is mild and the nights cold throughout the summer. Here again a casual participation in agriculture makes a relatively small addit ion to the Khamseh income. A more industrious people could doubt less make much more of the well-watered Mervdasht and Khafrak valleys where probably less than one quarter nr the suitable land is under wheat, barley, vegetables and fruit motivation. The settled sections of Khamseh have not yet ridded themselve of their aversion to agriculture. Whereever they”are found condit ions are porr and crops indifferent. In the Ramjerd valley (I^rv- dasht) part of the Nafar have settled. The climate, soil and abun dant water supply enable the local Persian peasants to reap good crops of rice and cereals throughout the year hut the greatest squalor and poverty is found in the i: villages occupied by Nafar tribesmen. ^ These conditions are paralleled in the southern area around 1 asfj and Darab and south of Lar where respectively the A'in— alu, Baharlu and-part of Nafar are settled. The advantages of the climate and agricultural resources of these regions have already been mentioned yet the Khamseh tribespeople in almost every case in P wMch 0 tS R Hve. leaSt ° fthe conditionP the district COMyiTNIC.ATIONS 1 . KX''TONAL (Under the various trlhal headings details of many of th,&gt; below are given’. * (a) Summer Quarters routes The Isfahan-SMrnx road runs through th° centre of the nomad ...KhamsehKhamseh summer quarters and representative sections of the tribes can usually be found in Dehbid, Sa^dAtabad and Mervdaeht. In summer access to the remoter parts of KEamseh territory is possible by the six routes outlined below: (i) Surmaq to Eqlid: the latter a Qashqai and Arab trading centre; surface fair but passable in summer only. (ii) Dehbid to Qeshlaq-e Dehbid, Khonjesht, Ahmadabad and Aeopas with a branch to Sirbanu: Baser! summer quarters; very difficult going; from Khonjesht onwards impassable for all but the stoutest cars.

(b) Winter Quarters Apart from the main motor roads running from Shiraz to Rasa, Darab and Lar(vin JahronO and the matter native route to Jahrom via Khafr add Qotbabad there are practically no recognized means of access to the KEamseh winter ouarters. Throughout the area however there are numerous camel tracks which in m^ny cases can be followed by a stout car in summer. The main roads are very rough in summer and much more so in winter, A brief descriptiQn follows: (i) Shiraz to Rasa; surface in summer very rough, in winter soft and very difficuTfe for private cars. Very rarely impassable for a lorry or a vehicle with twin-axle drive. (ii) Ras^a tc Djirab: surface very rough in places in summer; a number of torrent beds stop communication for several days at a time in winter; after heavy rain very soft and difficult for private cars. (iii) Rasa to Jahrom: surface very rough in summer and muddy in winter* streams across road; very difficult after heavy rain, (iv) Jahrom to Juyom: Surface good in summer and winter; the road climbs over a 40 -mile long pass- the last five miles of which are very steep and rough; satisfactory in summer and winter, (v) Juyom to Dehkufi (UI.T 29 ): the track is quite undefined and passes over a flat plain; surface exceedingly rough in summer and a quagmire in winter; practically impassable for a truck with twin-axle drive in March: all communication impossible after heavy rain. (vO Dehkuh to Lar: track passes over s flat plain, then a very steep pass and finally down 15 miles of river bed into Lar; impassable after heavy rain and exceedingly difficult throughout the winter* very rough in summer (vii) Pol-e Rasa (5 miles east of Shiraz) via Khafr to Ootbabad (11047': surface satisfactory in summer, difficult in winter: The quickest route from Shiraz to Jahrom and Lar.

INTERNAL The migration of the nomadic Khamseh tribes is confined tp two main routes and the tribes keep to these although the amount of traffic varies from year to year* These routes are as below: (O Assembling at Fasa: thence to Sarvestan or Runiz-e Bala. Khammeh (Korbal) and Band-e Amir; dispersal to various areas via Ramjerd in the west, Sivand (on the main Shiraz-Isfahan road' in tKe centre and Arsenjan in the east. (iO Assembling in the Juyom district: thence to Qotb_bad , Khan-e Kahdan (U01497&gt; and Khafr, Sarvestan, Kharameh and Band-e AmTr: thence dispersal as alcove, Note: In general the tribespeople camping in the north, north west and east of the winter quarters use route (i) above while those of the south, south-east and south-west use route (it). The latter route is generally the less used of the two. ORGANIZATION 1. THF POSITION OF rn HF GOVERNOR (STTPFRVISOR&gt;. The Khara^h tribes and the tribes attached to Khamseh are controlled by a civil Governor appointed by the Governor- General with the title of Sapparast , Lotfali Qavami, Amir Arfa's, conception of the position of /-ment/the Sar^arast is nuite clear: he accepted the appoint/ on con- ditions which the Governorate accepted. The status of the Snr - paraat might change a great deal with the appointment of another Gove mo r-Gene r al. The position and authority of Amir Arfa is that of IIkhani of Khamseh. As far as possible he exercises his authority through the khans and their armed following and avoids making use of the Army and Gendarmerie, The Army provides him with an armed body guard of about 20 mwn and transport for use when he is in tribal territory, His reluctance to employ these two Government forces is reasonable: he regards himself as incorruptible and bltTAs that the fewer corruptible agents at work in the tribes the better He offers the khans and their subordinates the alternatives of obedience or instant dismissal. H e realises that he cannot treat Army and Gendarmerie subordinates with the same peremptory justice that he offers the khans. He has informed the commanders of the Pars division and of the Pars Gendarmerie as well as the Governor- General that he will stay in his post only if he has full control of both military and gendarmes in the area so that he can prevent them from interfering in tribal administration. The largest tribe in Khamseh, the arab, has no supreme head. The Baseri are controlled by one kalan tar . The three ,.smallersmaller settled tribes are rach loosely united under owr fcftlantnr (in the case of Nafar the appointment is freouently var^nt). The attached tribes are split up and are under the authority of thei. head man (kadkhoda') of their tribe or village. *»mir ^rfa there fore administers Chains eh through the kalantars of the sub-tribea in the case of Arab and the jhiefs of the other smaller tribes. Over these leaders he exerts complete control. Under the separate tribal headings the organization of each part of the Kharnseh tribal group is described in detail. Amir Arfa,as Governor of Khamseh, holds a position of ex ceptional independence , He owes his appointment to the Gover nor-General but well knows that nothing must occur in Khamseh to prejudice its shadowy connexion with Qavam ul Hulk. Consequently ^mir Arfa owes two allegiances: an' official one to the Governor- General and a family one to C^avam ul Mulk. In the interests of his own career ^.mir .*rfa would no doubt resign from £he Khamseh if a Governor-General unwilling to tolerate the pretensions of Qavam in Khamseh were appointed to ?ars and he thus found hinself in a conflict of loyalties. 2* FINANCIAL For the post of Sarparast Amir ;*rfa received about 12,000 rials monthly and in addition is paid about 15,000 rials as Gov ernor of v asa. All extra expenditure he incurs as Sarparast of Khamseh is met by Qavam ul Mulk, So far as is knov/n he is neither offered nof does he accept presents of money or goods. There is a deeper penetration of Persian administration into the Khamseh area than into Qashqai territory.in that Gendarmerie posts are established all along the roads in the - south that inter sect the Khamseh winter quarters while in the north there are posts in the remote villages of Bavanat, Cheharrah, Kharameh and Abadeh Tashk, H10NQMIC 1. ECONOMIC CONPITIONS Some sections of Khamseh touch the lowest level of squalor, disease and poverty to be found in Fars. The bulk of the Khamseh, the nomadic tribes, are by tribal standards very poor and compared with Qaeh^ai give a very unfavourable impression of the life led by a nomad people, li\ ing The reasons for these pcor/conditious are to be found prin cipally in the nature of the khamseh tribesman: he makes singu larly little effort to better himself. This charbte ristic is found to a greater or lesser extent among all the tribes of Khamseh. Another reason lies in the fact -that the land in the khamseh summer quarters is poor when compared with that to the west and north-west where the Qashqai camp. . This disadvantage is partly discounted by the existence in the Khamseh winter quarters and southern part oti the summer quarters, the Mervdasht plain, of very fertile and well- watered tracts of land. The K v amseh tribesmen show no inclination to farm these regions unless all arrangements are made and expenses defrayed ^or them. 'Aiey apparently prefer their flocks and an im poverished existence. The effects of poverty on their way of life, appearance, habits and character are mentioned under PEOPLE . 2. REVENUE 'Aie value of Khamseh income can no longer be judged from the .. .partpart appropriated by Qavam ul MuIk as the latter 90 longer collects any tribute from them, Amir ^rfa has done his best to restrain rapacious khans and to encourage agriculture and economic cooperation • 'between the tribes and although no taxes have been collected but all the income spent, ostensibly, on the betterment of the lot of the.people, there has been little improvement in conditions in Khamseh, If this is to be taken as an indication of the exiguity of the income of the tribe and not of the enormity of the khans 1 rapacity the Khamseh are indded distressed, \ The principal sources of income are the flocks and herds. The nomadic sections rely almost entirely on the wool, meat, fats, etc which they obtain to barter for household goods, clothes and other necessities from the villagers. They make many woollen goode for home consumption ard their rugs which are of good quality and design find their way into the bazaars. Their ?ro^s of cereals in the winter ouarters are used largely within the tribe-s and little is marketed. This applies euually to their fruit and veg-.table pro duce except that tribes living near large towns will market much of their produce in the nearest bazaar. Camels., horses, mules and asses are a mainstay of the Khamseh income , These are hired out in the summer quarters for the trans port of the sugar-beet crop to the Mervdasht'sugar factory and both in the summer and in the winter quarters for grain transport. They also ofcrry tribal produce to more distrust markets such as Shiraz. Horses, apart from drajght animals, are scarce. The khans of Khamseh rarely possess large and productive landed properties.- But where, both in the summer and winter quar ters, the post of halantar has remained in one family for several generations and an estate has been acquired villages have grown up around it. In general., however, the post of kalantar is a temporary appointment and the khans tend to fill their purses rather than to build or acquire gardens or estates. 3. TAXATTON m he people of Khamseh pay no direct Government tax. The khans evade payment of taxes on their properties, '''he only dues paid therefore are those on goods sold in the town markets. The khans make the usual deductions on all,sales and purchases and it is estimated that the average khan collects about 1,000 tomans in a month in this way. This however is peculation rather than taxation. RELATIONS WITH N^IQ-HFPtTRING BRIBES The only important tribal neighbour of Khamseh is Qashqai. The two sections of Khamseh that have Qashqai sub-tribes '&amp;s their neighbours in both summer and v/inter quarters are the Arab and Bas er!. Their respective attitudes towards Qashoai are mentioned ~ elsewhere. In general there exists in Khamseh a jealousy/rather /of/ than a long-standing hatred for the Qashqai. The fact thnit the latter by three years of plundering and looting and o^en opposition to the Government have considerably bettered their lot is a source of much annoyance to the docile Khamseh. The Qashqai point to the Khamseh nomads as an example of the evil results of submission to the Government. The Khamseh for their part long for the day when they will be able to point to the Qashqai as an example of the evil consequences of opposition to the Government; nothing would please them more than the forcible disarmament and taming of the Qashqai. Day to day relations with Qnshqai are disturbed by raids and stealing. Resulting quarrels are in principle settled by the Governor and Naser Khan by repayment in kind of all stolen goods. In practice the Qashqai are said to be many thousand sheep^and *-oats •.♦to the good.to the good # Relations with the settled population of their area ire siipple; no tribe in Pars has a reputation for robbery and lawlessness eoual to that of the Arabs: the Baseri are not far behind and the settled tribes, it is believed, only escape the stigma because they are few in number anr 1 their depredations are in consequence insignifi— unfortunate villagers of the Khamseh trrritory have suffer ed much from these depredations and justly £lnme the Government is much as the tribes for their continuahce. RPLATIONS WITH THE PERSIAN GfflVERNMPNT After their experience of Reza Shah *8 officials the Khamseh tribes naturally have no great faith in the Government. They have cooperated freely with Amir Arfa hoping that he will help them to- v/h y they should work with this Governor and not witn o^hebdivani or the earlier succession of Military Governors is clear. Amir Arfa ! s predecessors did not disguise the fact' that they had pockets to fill. With a strict and honest Governor and the exclusion of the corrupt Gendarmerie and Army the Khamseh say that they can progress a long way towards abandoning their lawless ness, settling and becoming industrious farmers, but they maintain that settlement is imjos&amp;ible if the Government troops continue to oppress th^ peasants. Relations between the Khamseh rand the Government dopend large ly on the person of the Governor-General of Pars. Not every Os tanda r may be subservient to Oavam ul Mu Ik. It is even less like ly that future officers commanding the Amy and Gendarmerie will accept the exclusiveness of the Governor o-r vhamseh in matters of tribal administration when they have a perfect right under the existing system to interfere. The future administration of ^hnmeeh is therefore uncertain. vu v /? 1 * 1 {' rfa is ln favour ’ 0f ‘ permanent settlement of all tho Khamseh but lacks the necessary funds.

Purigg the settlement very many sheep, goats and horses were killed off and.the numbers of the tribe were depleted by death and the bre$k up of the Sub-tribes. ™he figure given for the Arabs in 1916 was 10.000 families. In 1944 it was rediiced to just over 6,000, Duping the 1914-18 war the Arabs remained cuiet while 2 a vam ul Mulk fefught the Qashqai and their reputation for submission tc the Odvemment Sates from that time. Unlike the Oaghqai they made ^rg^ized revolt igainst cr resistanse to *eza Rhah’s oppressive treatment although they were forced to pay the usual brilree to the Military Goyerncrs for the privilege of migrating* Robbery on the r#d‘'ts and between the sub-tribes continued an s small scale during thd reign of Pahlovi* . After.the allied occupation in 1941 the Arabs %emmenced re arming and resumed their former free migration. Most of their rifles were obtained by purchase from ^rmy deserter's or were dug up from former caches* a few were smuggled/through the rersian bulf/in/ •knd others stolen from the military, The tribal chiefs why under the Military Governorship had had little or no say in administration regained their authority and position. u avam ul bulk had retained his family^s hereditary attachment to the tribe but since he put in rd personal eppearanee and had no direct dealings with the dhiefs- his leadership was not effective. The kalantars became responsible to the Government for the security of their sub-sections but robberies and fighting occurred more frequently than before The Arabs claim that they in particular suffered much from the maladministration of the Military Governors of irhamseh, Captain Amir Sadri and Colonel Razm+u successively, between 1R42 and 1944,. • • .''ith ♦ The Arab, although not a’*group tribes.” in the same sense as Qaahqai. is excepllvons - '^iiown as Il-e Arab and not Taypf'pii-.y, Ar«b. “ “—^^r ith the appointment of B^hebdivani as civil Governor to the Khamseh in 1944 seourity improved little and conditions ’ytthin the tribe became \ 70 rse owing to the ^overnor^s incompetence and, sviepected, venality.

Thus a hold-up can ^ l»ute4 to the sub-tribe in whose area it oa ??5 ®nl r”lts whether they that sub-trl&gt;e is responsible for finding the culprits whe^er tnuy belong to his people or not . The Governor appoints and r«PO£ie the ehiefs of the sub-tribes at will and the chle^ c&gt;_ their tribes appoint and remove the heads of their 8 • ' . own discretion. This lack of permanence In appointments and th_ fast that no chief of the Arab tribe exists accounts for the eence of gonfcalopdcal trees. The Governor of Khamseh has declared that It would be 1m- pssslble to appoint any single Arab chief as IIkhan1 of th . r es no A rat. could command general respect. As Is the case with the other tribes of Khamseh no taxes are collected from the Arabs In money or In kind. ECONOMIC The Arab tribe relies principally on its flocks of sheep and create ft^r its livelihood. Another important item in tribal economy are the camels and horses. In the summer quarters these are hi redout for th® transport of the beet and cereals crops to pv r dashl and Shiraz respectively and in the winter quarters f°r h carrying of cereals and other produce to town stores and mafcfcets* With markets in Oehbid, Mervdasht and Shiraz in summer and Pa^, Jahrom and Darab in winter, they trade their cooking-fat, mutton, wool,and skins for rice, grain, fr-e-market sugar and tea and ot^.r ccrr»n&lt;tflities. Ip clothes, fruit, fuel and most of the necessx 1 s of life they are self-supporting. Practisally all trade is carrledon through the khans and th&lt;? khans arc thus the only members of the tribe who have money. They are consequently responsible for the welfare ^eir P^P e pa far ae goods not produced within the tribe are concerned an., they handle the supply of monopoly goods. This supply Is organized what the Governor has described ap the only vorKab^e system, the khans 8«11 in the black market one haltf of the ration of r,on £'' roly pdode td pay for the pthor half which they give t# their pedple. By any other system the Arab people would receive no tea, sugar or dloth at all oino'C they themaelves have no money to buy the good©. Some of the khans of the tribe own property In both the rummer and winter -ou&amp;rters \vher« they produce cro?s of grain, beans, fruit and rice in the summer ouarters and grain, dates, ‘' mci rice in the winter quarters. No taxes arc collected from whe Arab tribesmen an the khanr pay no taxes dn t^eir lands. The Arab triba is probably the least prosperous tribe of Pars. The reasons for this have been given under PEOPLE. Sc far as future schemes for bettering their condition are concerned results are likely to be disappointing. The Arabs describe t..eir ^eiiod cf enforced settlement under Reza Shah as the low water mark of their econc’ 1 '^ ^ ,f '^p^essiAn ' 1 and state that the best hope qf prosperity is free migration and an eff icient and ^ust civil Governor RELATIPNS^TH NEIGHBOUR !^ J2i^ES In their summer Quarters the Arabs camp just to the cast of sections of the Qashqai (principally Sheshboluki). Invariably, however, they leave a strip of no-man f s-land about 15 miles wide between themselves and their more prosperous neighbours. Despite thisthis precaution theft and counter-theft of flocko antf personal . -property Is unending. Settlement of disputes Is made by negot iation •'between the Governor of Khamseh and JTaser Khan Qashfjai. The Arabs attribute the affluence of the Qashoai' t« their two yetrrs of wild outlawry from 1941 t* 1943 when they indulged v in wholesale pillaging and looting of villages in their area. They admit their own-indulgence in robberies and hold-upe in the years that followed the allied occupation but point out that these were never on a scale large enough to constitute active opposition ^ t* the Government or to enrich the tribe. They pro’febs to rate the Qaohqai a smart but far from formidable enemy. THE PEOPLE The average tribesman is tall and lean. Complexions are 1 n^ddier than * * elsewhere in Pars. Almost without exception the khans look like, and are, crooks. The people are a ragged add undernourished-looking rabble but this is largely due to economic conditions and their own lack of industry. Unlike the Turki-speak- ing tribes , the Arabs are lazy, dirty and careless. This,and not the nature of their territory, accounts for the lower standard of living in Arab than in Oashoal. f ^his also partly explains their indulgence in petty theft and robbery. The outstanding Arab quality is bravery which was shown in operations against the South Persia Rifles during 191? and 1918. Since then the Arabs have engaged in no major conflicts and so have n*H been put to the test. Prom all accounts they are consid- „ erably mvre formidable fighters than, for instance, the washoai nomads. Their religion is Shi 1 ah Islam; the people are not given STERNGTH Tba strength of the Arab tribe is about 8,165 families or roughly kbeut 31,009 souls. Practically all uf this total ap ear# tq.be migratory. The Arabs probably pqaaesfc about 3,000 rifles «f all types apai wintagee. Of this number little more than 1,500 are riiedern weapons (Brno, Lee Enfield, Mauser and Russian ridels). Fi hting strength (armed men) is estimated at about 2.000. The number of mounted armed men is negligible. ANALYSIS OP ARAB SITBlTRIBES In the following tables the Arab tribe is divided, into its tv/b Sections, Sher ani and gabbareh. The two sections are split int4 their different sub-tribes and each sub-tribe into its sub sections, if any. ’There a sub-tribe consists of two or more sec tions these sections are indicated by the vertical writing in the second column. The numbers quoted v/ere obtained in the presence of the Gov ernor who particularly requested khans t'a give' the correct figure and not that invented to obtain extra rations from the Finance Department. Numbers of sub-sections are not given as even the khane themselves are uncertain of the numbers'of their sub-secticns The latter frequently intermingle or camp apart from their refcuec— tive sub-tribes. * The names of the chiefs ( kalantars ) of t^e sub-tribes onlyflfe given anl even these hold only a very tem^rary appointment- The hea.^.s of the snb-sectlons (kaj khodas ) are appointed by the ka.iantars (see ORGANIZATION) and are continually being r moved and reappointed. No names of kadkhodas are therefore given. In some instances lines of migration of individual sub- tribes appear as variations of the main routes (see COMFTTTiiCATIONS- INTBRNAL;. The comments on the reputation of the sub-tribes were supplied by the Governor. ^ The location of the summer and winter quarters of each sub- tribe is liable t.D change at any time. N*te: Many sub-tribes are divided into two sections with one section bearing the sub-tribal name and the other section being called Jam *i « In these cases the first section is the original sub-tribe and Jam f i means 'people subsequently incorpor ated' cr 'attached sub-sections'.APPENDIX I ~K-' T ''.’T-: m-ORTS 1.

It is said that the tribe originated in Ihorgsan and Is made up of the descendants of the clans le .d by three brothers, Musa, ^ol^mbehi and Abdol. There are still in exifctenw In tfee tribe three sub-sections which b^ar the above nar.es. The Baser! appear to have taken in dissenting eectionr of Aciifr and m urk tribes and they have certainly swallowed up numbers l ©f villagers who till the land on which the B'iseri canp and who Join the ^migration and call themselves Baser!. They were once und**r the authority of the leader o-n the .Arab tribes and their language is a corruption of Arabic. HISTORY The Baser! section of T 'hanReh sneered few hardships in the reign of~Reza Shah. Although, in comron with most of Jhanseh. they possessed a reputation for robbery they were not reckoned a throat to Government authority and after their disarmament in the late twenties were not molested to the same extent as pashpai. Settlement was enforced in 1933 and lasted until 1941. Many tribes men evaded this by paying the necessary bribes to Government Offi cials. No particular area was fixed for then by the Government so the tribe built its villages both in the smith around Pas_a and in the north around Mervdaaht. They took up agriculture on a fair scale; stock-breeding took second place among thorn. Some of the t khans hold that this period was one of considerable prosperity; ethers say that without the migration life was intolerable and that Government officials opiiressed them and ro bed them of any money they made through growing crops* the .tribe seems to have given little trouble during this settlement period it may b* aseumetf that they were reasonably content.

HTS m OKY The Ainalu abandoned their migratery life in the early 19^0 s. Some sections continued to move northwards in poor years and it was net until the late twenties that at the request of yavam ul hulk they all became entirely sedentary. In the time of Pezn Shnh the leader of the Ainalwas Abol h.nsem Ar,1omand. H e was still In charge In H45. He had the good sense to keep his. tribe under tight control during the P^evi mile and their good behaviour had the happy result of warding ofi oorrup , and nn scrupulous Government officials. A fixed tribute was demanded ron Ainalu during this period and Ariomand saw that it was promptly pal' . '’his' tribute was a strain on the tribal economy but conditions never became desperate in the Ainalu villages. Having seen bis tribe successfully survive the Pahievi regime Ariomand was able ^o do much to increase its prosperity during the years that followed Reza Shah’s abdication. He was fortunate in having a mild landlord. Compared with other Khamseh peoples the Ainalu are well behaved and lawlessness in their area is seldom the fault of th^se tribesmen but rather that of raiding bandits. income has increased considerably since 1042 and under a benevolent chief there has been a correspond ing improvement in ..heir nn&gt;. conditions. TERRITORY H59X, Oct r 41; H40S. Mar ’42. c * 1. POSITION The tribe is settled in three main districts r Shesh I)eh and Qarabolagh in the Fasa area. 20 miles east and 16 miles south-east of Fasji town respectively and in the Rudbal valley north-west ol Larab.’*’ Other families are found around Fasa town. 2. BOUNDARIES Sinee the tribe keeps to its villages no definition of their habitat other than that given above is necessary. Map references 4 of all vill ages (see ANALYSTS^ are given where possible. 3. PHYSICAL Oarabolagh is an uneven.slightly rolling plain broken by low mounds at irregular intervals. Dry watercourses cut across it from t^e bills and a small stream'which dries up in summer flows across its south-eastern border, ^he surrounding hills are completely barren and all uncultivated areas are *uite devoid of vegetation after April. Shesh Deb is the name given to a long narrow valley running from east to west with a slight northerly trend. It is about miles long and 4-5 mil^s wide. From the surrounding hills flow streams which are underground in Channels and brought into the valley for irrigation. The valley flucr is fairly level, grass- covered in spring and hare in summer where not under cultivation. ...The RudbalThe Rudbftl valley appears to be a basin In the centre preelpttous mountains north of Darab, It is reputed to e * _ watered and fertile ana conmunica + es by way of narrow and diffiu t* gorges and x asses with the Shesh P^eh valley in the south .. i Nioiz plain in the nor’th. The Ainaln territory lies in the hills and valley* or immediately to the south of the precipitous limestone ridge tnat divides the Fasa - Darab plains from the Fstahbanat and Nlriz valleys in the north. 4 # CLB'^TE In winter the climate is mild and warm. Snow very rarely falls and the rain supply although not abundant is sufficient for a much greater area than it is crustsmary to cultivate. i.hc rainfall feeds springs and streams that ire run off into underground channels in the Shetfrb Deh and Rudbal districts and fill water tanks and shallow wells in the Qarabola^gh region. After April -the s^uth begins to dry out and by June the grass is burnt off and all land not under cultivation becomes a bare desert. The head is intense: allsurface moisture and streams dis appear entirely. 5. AGRICULTURE Products from the Ainalu lands in winter are wheat, barley. • beans and other, vegetables” in summer a second crop of cereals is grown together with crops of maize, opium, cotton- rice, dates and oranges. The amount of surplus produce from the Ainalu lends is uncertain but roughly half of the available land is under culti vation. The total annual wheat and barley crop reaches approxi mately 1,000 tons. OOMMimi^ATTONS 1, EXTERNAL The road from Easja to Qarabclagh.

This they achieve bv good rule. They hold a few Govern ment-issued riffles. ...In theIn the analysis of Ainalu each sub-tribe has the name of a chief written opposite it.

He keeps or er ^n settles disputes so far as he is able. Thereafter he c Is n assistance 'f the kalantar and his armed men if necessary* Conditions in Ainalu are good. Since 1^41 the Income of the tribe has increased and the Crovernment tax has been abolished. mand himself is known as a benevolent leader, 'or instance h^ ara- 'bolagh district is owned by the widov/ of Hazm Ux ?ul^.. beo^ e^ PouTeh. who takes one tenth of all produce and allocates one fortieth to Ar *cmand. The lat J er exacts no additional tribute by irbegu ar means and the rest of the Income goes back to the tribespeop.i-e. in Shesh Deh the chief villagers own their own property outrignt and are reported to deal very fairly with their pe isani-ry. The Governor of Khamseh reports that this tribe has received satisfactory supplies of Government monopoly 'roods^ since the mono poly system was introduced. Markets are Pas^a and Dr^rab rhere the pbople purchase household goods, clothes p tc. RKLATIONC WITH NEIGHBOURS As mentioned under the heading PEOPLE the Ainalu tribespeop-LC have not intermingled with the native Persian villagers in their area. Thus a village of pure Ainalu population will neighbour a pure Persian village. Relations between the two peoples arc as a rule cordial. The Ainalu suffer no less than other settled farmers from the plundering and thieving of the Arabs who overrun the area in winter. In general they have no enmities and clash only with marau ding tribal migrants and bands of thieves. THE PEOPLE Spoken of as a reliable type of man, honest and, for Hhamsefri, hard-working, the Ainalu tribesman displays qualities not commonly found in the other Khamseh tribes. His industry is possibly attri butable to his murk origin. This may also account for his appearanc© which more resembles the bold bearing of the Oasbnai than that of the.uncouth Arab.. The Khqns -are also of a nobler breed than their Arab counterparts. /inter- r:Y he A^nalu have maintained tteir independence in thatthev have not/married or settled with the Persians native to their area. They keep to themselbes and live in separate communities, '.'heir way of life is 1‘ttle above the standard cleanliness ruling in the dis trict. Their health is deteriorating because of the spread of typ hoid by polluted water supplies. Typhus is common and arises from dirty llvinv conditions which Foster other contagious diseases. STRENGTH The Ainalu total 1,410 families or ”.050 souls. Tn 101B their numbers were given as 1,200 families, 'hey own about 100 rifles ac- nuired from Government and private sources. Ainalu tribesmen are said to make excellent foot-soldiers but in recent history there has been no occasion to put this reputation tti the test. ANALYSIS OF SUB-SECTIONS s In the following table a list of the sub-eectionof Ainalu is given together with the village occupied by each sub-section, the number of its members and the name of its ’’head man”. Y/here marked cn the map or otherwise available the map reference of each village is given. . •♦ANALYSISgAHARLU ORICrllT The Bahaplu tribe is of Turkish origin and came U) Pars during the twelfth nnd thirteanth centuries, HISTORY In 1018 the Raharlu had already been settled for many years .and they have since shown no signs o^ returning to a nomadic way of life. Once the fiercest fighters in Khans eh and a terror to their ^ B^ifthbours, the Baharlu wrre suppressed by O.avam ul Hulk in l 0 !’ 7 and suffered severe Iqsses in the fighting against Oashmi near Shi- . raz in 1018, Poverty and disease further depleted their nunhe /l ri 45/a r! a in / they total scarcely 1.0^0 families. They have lost their fighting reputation and their once famous horsemen no Ion ere P 0 V i p t . It is not r 'u uprising that with their reputation for lawlessness the Baharlu had a hard time during Reza Shah’s reign. All the vil lages were taken away' from the khans who previously owned them and left in charge of the gendarmerie, heavy taxes 'rere exacted by land lords and ex+ortion was rife among Government officials in their district. The three leading khans were removed to Tehran where two of them, Qasem and Abol Hossein Khans,died and the third, Amir Aaa Khan, survived to return to the tribe in 1941, After 1941 Government contrel over the tribe relaxed and taxes were no longer collected, Amir Ana han returned and. those who re mained Of the former khans, tor thelTr descendants, again took charge ofl thr Baharlu villages. The Baharlu thus lost one set of oppressive masters and gained another and al-though their income has doubled since 1941 the let £rf the people has seen no improvement. They have been guilty of much lawlessness although not on a scale comparable with that of the nomadic tribes. In tieir dealings with officials and traders they have earned a rpputation f?r unreliability for which the khans can be fairly blamed. TERRITORY Map: H40S, 1. POSITION Mar’42.

Small sections have settled in the hills to th^ north and east and others hav^ pene trated the..plains further south than Khosu. 2, BOUNDARIES The main body of the Baharlu tribe is settled in the villages included by the boundaries giv-n below.

It is entirely ringed by mountains. In the north these rise very suddenly and.precipitously to heights of 10,000 feet (7,000 feet above the. plain) and are practicably impenetrable (a very difficult animal track gives access^tothe adjacent plain of Niriz). \ series' 4 /*! ■ i? a 1*0' Mwlttfvs nnd pacers lc?aflo ofl' 'Trow th^ eaatr?rr copnea nhe H ; lfiln towards Pur^r and another series in the west tov/ards Fasa.

The Khosu plain, which lies a few hundred feet higher than the ncrhhern extremity ''f a vast flat t?rea of land**'that is divided into tv/o parte hy a line of mountains (n#t. marked on the map) running in a north-west to south-east di rection through JuyOm to &lt;the mountain masses around Lar . • The northern part which extends from Juyom in the west to within 25 miles of Fur&amp; in the east and t', the mountains around Lar in the s©uth is broken throughout by chains and masses of mountalna, (5,-8,000 feet) which emerge from the flat land like islands fr:m the sea. For about 75 miles the desert track from Khosu south west te Juyom winds round these mountain masses without climbing over any passes or even the slightest rise and making a sharp con trast with the steep passes, saddles and cols that link the valleys of northern and western Tars. The land becomes progressively more barren and arid as Khosu is left behind and verv soon turns into a waterless desert, habitable only in winter and spring when the tribespotiple graze their flocks there after the winter rains. The southern part,which is known as the Banaruyeh-Juyom plain and stretches nearly to Lar in the south-east, is reached from the- northern part by a precipitous descent (500 - 1,000 ft.^ of the line of mountains already mentioned and tretches o west towards the Qir and Karzin (Qashoai) lowlands. For a further description of this area see BASHHI- rr, FRFI ’ORY - 'Vinter Quarters, 4. CLIMATF A mild winter with three months of showers and 11+tie really cold weather together with a very hot dry summer are 'typical of the climate of SanoL, The cool d'imp of the winter f civ ours the cultivation of cereals and the heat and adequate water supply fr^m wells and channels in the summer encourages rice production. Rice cultivation accounts forthe high incidence of malaria. The intense summer heat makes stock raising nearly impossible and horses and camels are the only animals found in large numbers in Baharlu villages. 5. AGRICULTURE The Darab district is rne of the more productive areas of Pars, The Baharlu, like the rest of the inhabitants the area, sell much produce from their land in both summer and winter. In winter heavy crops of wheat, barley and vegetables are reaped: in summer a second crop of cereals is reaped together with rice, opium, maize, cotton, dates and citrous fru$ts. The amount cf surplus produce which the Baharlu people market in Darob and Khosu is not known since record is kept by the supply department only o-h purchases from individual villages which contain a mixed population of Bahar lu and native Persians, Only about half of the water supply of”“ the Darab valley is utilised and great areas of fertile land lie uncultivated. goE.ruTTic/nous 1, EXTERNAL ...Access.Access to the Baharlu district is e isy by me'*4ns cf the main Faea to Bar^b road frorTwhtch branch tracks connect with the vil lages in the D^rab plain. A g* od motor-able track leads south from to Rhosu and its continuation permits mot;r transport to reach the barren southern plain between Khosu and Juyom, In the Thcsu plain many villages are accessible from the road as all this country is level and broken by very few irrigation channels, ^he hill settlements of Baharlu can only be reached by animal transport 2* INTERNAL During 1943 and 1944 grain collecting trucks covered most of the ground in the Djarab and T 'ho r ’u valleys, A stout car ui 11 cover much or this area in summer but in v/inter it is a ouagmire and impassable. ORGANISATION The head of the Baharlu tribe is Amir A qa Khan who assumed control ef the tribe after the far of Reza Shah, He holds his appointment frcin the Governor of Khamseh, In principle the Bahar lu tribesmen could rid themselves of this kalantar by complaining to &gt;}he Governor, Amir Ana Khan has suocumed to the effects of opium and is no longer capable of exercising close oontrel over the tribe. He therefore concentrates on collecting excessive taxes and leaves the welfare of the tribe to chance, his khans folio;/ his example: they take the maximum of taxes frcto their .tribespesple and do little or nothing for them in return. They perfdrh few of the duties of khans such as seeing that a satisfactory supply cf monopoly g^ods is maintained and protecting the rights of their people. ; 'hus feuds and quarrels are frequent in Baharlu as a result of never- eddinm inter-tribal theft and pilferage. It frenuently happens t^at a head man oversteps himself and is obliged to leave his village in a htlrry. A new man then takes over charge of the village and as a rule is soon as grasping as his predecessor,, rn his lack o-r permanency in the appointment of village head men accounts -Per the absence of their names in the analysis of Baharlu sub-sections. ECONOMIC With markets in Darob and rhosu the kh ms of Baharlu sell the surplus crops from their villages to be transported to Shiraz and to deficit i re as such as Lpir. The kh ms also appropriate a large part of all crops grown on the landtnder their supervision whether surplus er not. ^he result is that the average Baharlu khan lives in considerable comfort (Baharlu land is very fertile^ while conditions among the people are as low \s is to be found in T^ars, They give the impression cf a fine people having sunk Into squalor and disease. RELATION? WITH NEIGHBOURS The Baharlu have so intermingled with the native population of their area that they are frequently no longer racially^distinct from their Persian neighbours. Yet in many cases the baharlu popu lation of a village is at odds with the rest of the vill ~ers and thefts and raids are not uncommon both between Baharlu and Persians and amongst the Baharlu themselves. The neighbouring ^inalu have no respect f_r the Baharlu and regard them as untrustworthy ’’he Governor of Khamseh says that this description fits these peoule in whom he himself places no reliance, ' ...THE peopleTH^ PEOPLE i 75 fh ?

STHKNOTH In 1944 the kalantap of ^abarlu stated that his tribe totalled m ? n ’ Yiornen and cKll'dren. As previous estimates varied around 90 famili« this figure is probably correct.

No explanation of their separation from the main body of Turk! tribes is offered*. The tribespeople are mostly settled in the district between Niriz and Fstahbanat* A few families migrate from the former to the latter place summer with the tribal flocks and herds. They have cultivated the land for many years and .enjo.t a very 'ood reputation by Khamseh standards.

TTTB PEOPL E The average M amassani is of medium height, spare - except, for those persona on whom the sedentary life is having its ^1 ecu with dark hair and eyes and in some case an almost delicate complexion. Refined features are not uncommon. Despite set corner i: the Mamacsani retain their tribal costume to a great extent. This consists of a round, often black, felt hat (in shape like that cT the Qa.l ai without the hrims) a light coloured rohe and bx^rk trousers, Th-~ women wear small nose ornaments and have the! - ’ brows tattoed. Settlement has made the majority of the Mamassani mean and ungenerous; the khans are very wealthy hy tribal standards bu* their concept ion of Hospitality in most cases falls far below tb = t of Qashqai. They are noted for sharp practices in commercial activities. General living conditions in Mamassani are sligh*' ly iowcw than those found in Qashqai but mui h bette : 1 than those of Khamsce Arab.

The native language is Lori hut Persian is spoken when reouired. STRENGTH The total number of Mamassani as given under -NALYS TS 0^ SUB-TRIBES Is 8.070 families or approximately 32,000 souls, ir believed to : e accurate. The fighting qualities of Mamassani have not been tried for many years. Their reputation for bravery and stamina is still quoted in Pars but it*is probable that the effects of malaria and settlement have not increased the Mamassani's desire or sapa'i'y for a fight&lt; They x-^bfess to he prepared to deal with anyone wno molests them and the face that no—one has molested them in th° past few years shows that the: are still regarded with respect by t?n i. neighbours.
