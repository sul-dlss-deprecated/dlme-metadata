The Agency, 4 ' Bahrain, 5 /4 /22. Dear Colonel, There has been a considerable irnprovement in matters hero lately and Abdulla seems to be genuinely out to help to the best o. l his ability. t hcuve had several lengthy meetings and discussions with Hamad and Abdulla and some of tho leading people and there is a general desire to put their house in order a little. ihe idea is to start recognised government offices, at the outset in temporary structures near the Customs, and provide - O or prop«r registration of suits (as regards B^hrain'subjects) and for regular court days and tho hoarinn- 0| G ' j ' vj. o 1 Court, with a sort of advisory committee of 5 or six of thw leading people, a roster of whom should be prepared «, certain number required to attend each court day. After that it is proposed to introduce a roOTlar and ipir system of taxation, based 6n taxes collected in the This 18 whore the difficulty comas in. it is proposec to collect 1. A tax of l/lQth annual value of date gardens, instead of the arbitrary sums hitherto levied. l/lOth tax on fish produced instead of odd sums now extorted. ' * T ' :e ^i v ing tax of R? 6 per pai^ of one Dive and one ^aib', leviable from Na.ldiudas. 4. A small house tax on property outside Tuharraq and ananeh, (which are excused on the ground that they subscribe to Baiahiehs). 1 and 2 are permissable in 'Shara' and seem quite reasonable, being only half that collected in Mesopotamia xor yrars past, both in Turkish and British times. 0 * n ha3 been spasmodically collected for years past.past, when posaible, and represents the Government T s share in the proceeds of Diving, compounded for a fixed sum. in Kuwait the Ruler gets one diver's share from each 'boat. No. 4. It is proposed to substitute for the countless illegal and unfair extortions now existing, such as the 'Poll, tax' on Bahrainis in some villages. Tax on Bahrainis in tho north of ruharram etc. All those v. re perfectly acceptable to the Bahrainis who 'refer any regularised taxation to the Dresent form of looting. In the past, practicably nothing has been collected from the Sunni tribes, and to make up for it the Bahrainis have been Oppressed out of existence almost. The two taxes 'hich 'Till level things up and compensate for the decrease of taxes from the Bahrainis, are (4) the house tax levied on all and (3) the Diving tax, most of which will fall on the Sunis, whereas the fish and date taxes mostly fall on Bahrainis. The house tax is new, and will be accepted by the Bahrainis without murmur, but the Sunnis may squeal. The Diving tax is recognised by o-ll as part of the'rights'of the Ruler, but for two or three years past, the Doworir and some others, have 1 gently but firmly failed to pay. Tt is further proposed, that once things are on a fd,ir basis, a certain sum should be definitely ear mark, for jll Government expenditure on public works etc. The difficulty is to get the thing started. It is evident that the Rulers are afraid of tho Sunni tribes, and thoy really is the stumbling block on the whole, system and till i f 1.3 removed little or no improvement can be expected ci,nd they will always want to make up their losses - O rom the tribes by plundering the Bahrainis, who will, I think, not fail to shout and give trouble in the future, unless things are put right. The Rulers now realise this point. The ^a e to settle, then is how to introduce the3 the new scheme, if approved, in such a manner that it will ensure buccoss . Abdulla, (and I agree with him) is certain that if they try to do it 'off their own bat', the Sunnis will complain and decline to obey, and then they will be in a worse position than if they had not attempted to enforce obedience. His idea is that, if some sort of o ceremony could be proposed, at which you were present, in which Sheikh Esa would announce his intention of rejoining his Government and providing adequate means for dispensing future etc and would announce the revised rules of taxation. Then if you could reply congratulating him and stating that you approved of his intentions and of the scale of taxes proposed, provided they were fairly and impartially collected and provided a good organised Government were given to the people in return, and that His Majostyts Government would support Sheikh Easa in this policy in enforcing his rule if necessary, it is believed that the whole thing would be started without any trouble. Once they know that it is with our concurrence no trouble would be made. If we do not do something of this sort, they will continue to take it out of the Bahrainis, who will continue to make disturbances and in a very short time Sheikh Easa's administration will go bankrupt. He is already a good deal in debt and now not only gets practically no taxes from the Sunnis, but little from the ^ahrainis, who are rerusirig all over the place.to pay up unless taxes are fairly dist: 3].mted. Recently the Sheikh had to stop «.ny collections in Sitrah, fearing a row, till th«y could evolve some order out of the present chaos. T have written privately, as I should like to know your views as to the lines we should go on. The Ruler is now prepared to take advise and to put things on a better basis, if we will give him the necessary support to enforce his authority, without this he can do nothing, and I do not think it will be longV- long before, he goes bankrupt and we shall have to take things over as in Muscat. It is rather necessary for us to come to an early conclusion as to our policy because the Sheikhs have announced their intention of altering affairs and meanwhile, everything is at a standstill and neither Bahrainis nor tribes will pay up or obey any orders. It seems to me that without our backing, th^ Rulers can do nothing, and in return for it we can now insist on the introduction of a decent form of government. I apologise for writing at such length, but thought it better to ask your views, rather then bombard you with official reports. If you require an official statement of the situation, I will prepare one. Yours sincerely Sd/- 0. Daly.Telegram R. From Resident,Buohire. To Daly,Bahrain, No.655 Dated 10th April 1922, Demi-official. Your letter dated the 5th April re reforms. My impression is that Government's attl tude is very much * let sleeping dogs lie 1 , and I should have to consult them before I could promise the Sheikh anything at all definite in the way of ^pport. I think it would 'be best If you put in an official letter giving proponed reforms with spare copy I could send on to Government asl^for telegraphic reply, or since no doubt it is advisable to act quickly perhaps you could send report ± h with resume in telegraphic form which could be telegraphed on. Trevor.7 to pass th i night grouped &lt; Ground the flagstaff. Such situations vvere not dovoid of difficulty. On ono recent occasion,a further .?,ct of oppression by one of 3 Xhalld v s sons,c&amp;used some fifteen hundrid persons to appear at the Agency.They refused to * leave and to I'y their grievances before the Huler ^ae I suggest ed. ;^inca their nunbora were being constantly addc?d to by frosh arrivals,! decided to end for Shailcs Hamad and Abdullatat to endeavour to arrive nt a settlement. The chalks interviewed a deputation from the crovd.and undurtook to instruct Shaik KhiO-id to cease interference with liberty of persons sud to postpone collection of taxes until further orders. They promised tte t.in the me'ntime, they ^ould consider the whole question of t ^xr'Ion,and the administration of justice, and would request laaa to mice rj announveraent later. On my reconmen- dation ,th8 crowd accepted thoae 'a-uranceB »nd dispersed. ^fter his there followed a series of discuss:-'ion3 at vhioh I nea as^od tc edvise.It waa pointed out to me th^t the^c Shoiks desired to intrAduce reforms and wished to substitute reasonable and just taxation,for the obnoxious texes hitherto forced firora the Shiahs. T learnt that,apnrt from the customs, the revenue of thn oh^ iks, h&amp;s been derived as follows- 1. Date garden tax. Collected quite erbttrarily,according to the whisn snd appetite for oppression of the particular sb ikling vithin whose area the garden exists. Practically co^ndted from 3haiah only. 2. •He ? abieh f literally 'neck tax' cr pol!! tax levied on males, at varying r^tee in different localities^It has been collecte /rom shtihs only an(3 is particularly obnoxious to them. 5. Fish tax. Levied from Shiahs only ?t varying rrtes. 4 »A special t x on 3hiahs during Muhcrram. 5* A vari ity of t&lt; T 'xos collected in kind from ^hiahs only. 6. A pearling tax.This was originally co''looted from all pearling boats, which re mr. inly owned by sunnis.Of late yerrs a l^rga number of thd boat owners h ve ceased paying. A similar t^x is collected by the rulers of JCovrit, A atar etc and/is the 9 1 acknowledged right o r the ;$hL ik.r 6 My advice was asked as to the form treasonable fiitare taxation might taice . After several discussions and sounding of locrl opinion, scheme for the following taxes va »e thought feasible - /\ Date tax of l/lOth on gardens watered by flow and 1/20 on those watered by lift,to be collected uniformly.This tax is admissable under 3hara T Law. 2* Fish tax of l/lacOth on fish caught in the local fish traps &amp; ^20th on fish caught otherwise. 5* Abolition of T Ra &gt; bieh T and all other taxes on shiahs,and * substitue therefore a very light ground tax for all houses,other than those in the tovns of Manameh and Muharraq, v hich p^y Munici pal taxes. To be collected without religious distinction. Details, which need not be gone into intthis report, v ere discussed at length, 4*The impartial collection of the existing pearling tax. The above scheme would be acceptable to the Bahrainis,but the Sunni tribes might not be agreeable,as they have been permitted to consider themselves practically immune from taxation, I was sounded as to whether the ruler could expect support from Government,in the event of hi^ introducing necessary reforms,should there be disinclination on the oart of the sunnis to accept them. 1 naturally g^ve no answer to this,and it is to request instructions on this matter^ that this report is written. To summarise- I* If the as in the past .seek to oppress the shiahs to compensate thenselves for their inability,or disinclination,to collect taxes fr6m the sunnis,they will be faced with continual disturbances, injsac which,! am of opinion, we shall sooner or later be involved • 2. If they forego most of the revenue from the shiahs, they will inevitably become bankrupt in the near future,and we m$iy be faced with the necessity of taking over their affairs,as was the case in Mascat. I learn from several sources that Shaik tesa is a good deal in debt privately.lt is bellieved he is also indebted to his Director of Customs,9 Shaik Abdulla ia in debt and 3hnik Hamad has informed me in con fidence that he also is in debt and that his liabilities are steadliy increasing,particularly as he is noWunable to collect full revenue from shlahs from fear of disturbances. . If the 3haiics attempt to introduce the proposed forms 01 taxation, the Sunnis may be expected to object. Should this be the case the Bahrainis would follow suit,and no collections whatever would oo possible. To overcome this possibility it has been suggested to me t and I am inclined to concur,that it would only be necessary for it to be made clear to the leaders of both sunnis and shiah3 ,that the scheme was introduced with the knowledge and approval of yourseli. It would then probably be expected without difficulty, though it might be necessary to convey that the ru'er would be supported if necessary. Shaik Abdulla suggested that this might be effected by the ruler meking an announcement to a public meeting *t vhich you were pre sent, and to which you might add Governments aoproval of the reforms. It would seem that if we afford**this support we might not unreasonably^ require the ruler to improve his adminib^- tration and to set aside xacxx an annual sum for works of public 'Although -tha collection of revenue is momenti rily at a standstill and the shaiks are at a loss as to what to do,I have advised them not to hasten matters without mature reflection. l^ut to strengthen their position,and favourably impress their subjects, by the commencement of some ordered administration. They have agreed to this and Issued orders for the opening of a Government■ office with two regular clerks for dealing with ublic bi^mess, and for the establishment of a regular court _or the dispos cases among their subjects, in which a rough record of proceedings will be iept. These improvements, together with some o.hers -re being strongly demanded by public opinion.

This report has only just b^en roceivod and I think it advisable to send it on by today 1 s nail to save a week, and I am therefore unable to deal with the ratter in detail. Major Daly has, however, reported very fully, and it is thereforo unnecessary for me to do so. The Sheikh apparovitly desires to introduce a fair scheme of taxation outlined under hoads 1 to 4 on the 3rd page of Major Daly's letter. lie Is however afraid of the sunni tribes, which for some time past have not borne their full share of taxation. The Sheikh desires to know whether lie could expect support from Government in the event of his introducing the necessary reforms. His advisers think that if tho local population knew the reforms woro being intro duced with the approval of Government, they would raise no difficulty about paying the taxes. The Political Agent is incli»ed to agree with this. Sheikh Abdulla suggested that affairs at Bahrain, I have the honour to forward for the/3 that the beat way of doing this would bo for the Sholkh to announce the reforms at a proposed meeting at which I was present, and I could then say that the rofoms were approved by aovemnent# I now beg to enquire whether the Govemnent of India will be pleased to authorise me to say that they approve of the rotUorma in taxation and will support the Sheikh in introducing them provided they are levied fairly and equally all round without (iiscrinination or preferential troatmont* If the Govemnent of India decide to give some measure of support I agree with the Politic:*!

It is the ardent desire of the Government of India that they should not be drawn into interference between the Ruler of Bahrain and hir. subjects. But as the proposed reforms are mainly due to their warning against opression etc, and appear sound in themselves you are authorised to Inform the Sheikh that Government welcome his scheme and will lend their moral support to an honest attempt to put it in force impartially. This authority is given on the understanding that you feel that more than moral support is unlikely to be required. But nothing should be done to encourage ides, that Sheikh is introducing reforms at Government dictation. Hence you should consider whether better plan would not be for Sheikh to make announcement shortly before your arrival. Another meeting mie:ht tben be held at which you should central- ulate Sheikh on introduction of reforms and estpress hope * that they will prove of lasting benefit to whole community.

BAHRAIN REFORMS. Sir, With reference to the correspondence ending with your , telegram No. B5l-»S dated 24th Jtme on the subject of the proposed reforms at Bahrain I have the honour to report that matters remain in statu quo and it now seems unlikely that the Sheikhs will seriously attempt any reform unless driven to it by rebellion on the part of the Bahrain! s. 2. The reasons for this are as followsI- The Sheikhs expressed their original desire for reform shortly before Ramzan and Ramzan had started When Foreign and Poli tical Department telegram No. 549--S dated Snd May was re- . ceived. in Racizan especially if the fast occurs during the \ hot weather no one does much in Bahrain and needless to say nothing was attempted during the month. By the end of Ramzan the Sheikhs desire for reforms had fizzled out to a great extent. Another reason is that a few months before the Dowasir a powerful tribe of sunni Arabs who reside at BuiAa- iya and the neighbourhood on the H.W. corner of the main island and fit out a lot of boats for the Pearl fisheries, sent a deputation to the sultan of Kejd. The latter received the deputation well and is said to have promised them his support. This has frightened the Sheikhs as they have a great dread of Bin Saud and the Akhwan, and now that they0-1 they think the Dowaslr will have Bin Saud behind them in resisting reforms which touch their pockets, it is very unlikely that any reforms will be attempted, unless as I have remarked above, they are forced on the Sheikhs by pressure of events# I have the honour to be # Sir, Your moat obodlont servant, u V'fr, Lieut-Col Political Resident in the Persian Gulf,Ko.^g- S of 1982.

As the Sheikhs were understood to be in earnest over introduction of taxation reforms Government of India*8 chief concern was avoidance of any action that might give colour to impression that reforms were being introduced at their dictation. If as you now report Sheikhs are unlikely to introduce reforms of their own motion matter assumes entirely different aspect and question arises whether pressure should not be put on Sheikhs to bring reforms into practice forthwith. Foreign Office point out that gross injustice involved by Sunnl immunity from taxation and victimisation of Shiahs with British connivance affords opportunity for anti-British agitation in Persia and elsewhere. Please submit youY reasoned proposals. Success of your personal intervention last March suggests advisability of repetition but Government of India ei-re unable to gauge how far your present repot'^ Regarding deputation of Dowasir to Ibn Saud and his alleged pronibe of support complicates the case for they are unaware what deput ation was about and whet(@(h|r Sheikhs knew before they bruit sd introduction of reforms # lf there is really any danger of the Akhwan movement being imported into this bueihess^ Sir Percy Cox must clearly be referred to and all necessary papers should be sent to him.

In the p^st the Ruler has relied on the Dowasir and other ^unni tribes to enable him to overawe the ihiah ^ahrainis and they were always allowed a free hand in their dealings with shiahs.

The Dowasir bitterly criticised this attitude,but ware also afraid to take the law into their own hands v sinoe th^y distrust the Shai]cs 9 and suspect ed that,should their action cause disorders the blame would ba nlacad upon them to clear the ShaiJcs* They hare since frequently tried to force Shailc Hamad's hand by picking quarrels with the Bahrainis t an example of which was the •Barbar 1 affair which was reported ■■Jug at the time* This matter has never bean settled •Although they dare not admit it, the rulera know that the Dowasir deliberately instigated the affair. They would gladly orifice the ifeihrainia to placate the Dowasir who continue to press for v redress 9 but are afraid that aach action would cause a revolt among the Ihaihs.They therefore continually delay a full enquiry. ^t is probable thrt the recent more determined attitude of the Bahrain Shiahs to rid themselves of oppression is displeasing to Bin band 9 I suspect thia from the attitude of hia agent here in the matter* Bin Saud haa shiah subjects at ^atif who are closely connected with the . Bahrainis &lt;&amp; whom he taxes out of all proportion to their wealth.Haports have been once or twice received that they were inclined to resent the treatment and on one occasion which was reportedxfc to you and to the High Comnii sionor for Iraq, they attempted to approach ma ,but were ^discouraged as we had no desire to interfere in the affairs of the Saltan of ^ajd. Also it is becoming increasingly apparent that ^in 3aud is anxious to have a hand in Bahrain affairs.The same attitude has, I believe been noticed by the A. JCuwait in regard to that place. It would therefore be in his interests if the inef ficient administrat ion of Bahrain continues,enabling him to ma^« secret alliances with independent factions such rs the Dowasir. Heforms,entailing equitable taxation, means support to the Bahrain Gove moment to eiiable them to* '• ' il control equally the sannl and Shiah tribes. The Dowasir have been &gt;led so ^ong in Bahraiii that they f re recognised as Bahrain subjects la their relations with the ahailcs they do not enjoy the good ofirices tli ;,Qney # u3 is the case with all recognised subjects of J&amp;in Saud* 3ince they are however virtually independent they have no neexd for such assiatanca. Th?! Rulars of Hahmadn have recently adopted a somwhat 5t ,aor« just attitude towards the ahlaha,probably aa a result of the wamln, giren by OoTern^nent.but quite raoently they appear to be testing their power again In this rospeot.and as In aooordanoe with the Instmotlons of Ooremoment I hare soruoously arolded Interference,they are Inclined to gnin oonfidenoe. The Jiahrainis on the other hand are dlviSai,and some of the leaders tee disoouraged at haring obt- ined no support from H.M.G. as a result of appeals,whereas others advocate open rebellion should oppression again increase and are reported to hare imported arias. • ^ sunni tribes are almost . p 11 pearling HaJchudas* GrcvQt oppression exists in th€ pearl diving,and the majority of the oppressed are shiahs and under British protection,being foreign arabs or Persians. The Sunni tribes resent all reforms.lest a small beginning should lead to reforms also in the diving. I would point out that whereas reforms introduced by * the ShaiJcs,might bo a good thing even if imperfectly devised and Inefficiently carrUd out, it will be a difforent matter if they are introduced under pressure from H.M. Govt. In that event every pos ible flaw wi covered and exploited. Before embarking on such a POj r I would therefore respectfully suggest that I may be ^iven sufficient time to make a more careful study of the present s*Me of tax: tion the nature and effect of improvements which could be tec. .particularly those originally suggested by the ^haika. It would place us in a most invidious position to insist on reforms if in practice they did not adequately remove cause for grievance. a. 't ijTom ohe question of ta335tion is the more crying need ^or some system which will ensure Justice as between bonnis and 3haiha t for this is the grievance which is most likely to react on opinion in neighbouring ShdAh countries.are now In the pearling season and any enquiries now mad •iQ 1 ovo r oiroumapeot will aroase the greats st suspicion among the ^unni pearlers. I beleive that after the olose of the season ^ full study of these matters could be mada without causing a st Iso^aa already reported I am Just finishing negotiations which it is hopadxwill result in a reconciliation between Shailca Abdulla and Hamad, It would be adrisable to test Abdulla»s attitude for soma little tima .If he proves that he is genuinely *^parful tomassist Hamad the introduction of reforms would be to same extent simplified.Otherwise,regrettable though it will be, wo shall be compelled first to deal with him,for he would join forces with the iunni tribes against Hamad to oppose reforms &amp; discord among the ruling family would again result and render effective control by them an impossibility. This report has been written in great hasie in order to catch the mail,and I beg that fehK its inTOlved nature ^ ria^ be ovurlooiwod• I trust that all assentiel points are however dealt with* /} Itftfxfr.

Since m / return frOM recess I teve devoted nuck time \ consideration to tke refoms whiek tke Govcmitent of India desired skould be introduced into Bakrain vide jour Ifo 1217 of 1922. The *iain necessity for tka introduction of certain reforms,as far es Great Britain is concerned •in tke capacity of Protecting Power,is on aceount of the accusation which is frequently wade ,tkat the British authorities connive at the victinisation 0 the shiafch population, and at the very .erious abuses whiek have crept into the diving industry,rendering the divers,ninety per cent of whom are foreigners '* und r British protection, slaves in all but the naMe. It is said that Great Britain in handing over the rulership tp Shaik -^asa.had stipulated that he should rule with equity &amp; in accordance with the dictates of humanity &amp; has,on more than one occasion, assisted him to assert his authority,but has taken no steps to chnck his abuse of the same in late years,nor to insist on a reasonably effeei^nt form of Government. The above protest is frequently made to me A I am asJccd whether proteetion 3s afiffarMed merely to the rulers, to the detriment of their subjects. They are substantially the same arguments as vere brought forth on the occasion of the demonstration lant year,vhen you visited Bahrain, During the last few months the position of th'i Bahrainis whom the Shaiks have onen more subjected to considerable oppression, has been constr»t.i r broa^tt -•/ notice by Persians,who ^s co religionists taice a lively interest in their affairs A I learn that certain members of the Persian community are in close touvk vltk the leaders of the Bakrainis.

I have been at pains to discover the eauses of the increased unrest of l.ste /ears &amp; believe the* to b«- 1.

Suck results would increase rather than decrease the critieism * of the Protecting Power.

Sir, In my letter 529-S dated 16th July 1922 I asked leave to send in my considered proposals regarding the Reforms in Bahrain after the close of the pearling season. i would have submitted my views to you earlier had I not received last month your memorandum no. 3664/ 1126 Est. A. of the 5th December in which you referred to the Reforms as having 'now lapsed indefinitely** • This reached me on my return from a visit to Bahrain where I had been to discuss the question with the Political Agent; and I was on the point of closing a letter to you asking for the orders of the Government of India in view of that announcement when I received your memorandum no. 33-82 Est. A.,dated 10th January 1923 f reminding me that my proposals were still awaited. I have the honour now to acquaint Government with my views on the present situation in Bahrain. 2. The position of affairs is no better than when i last addressed you. During the past few months, the oppression of the Bahrainia by the Sheikh and the members of his numerous family has seriously increased; and is giving rise to deep discontent with the ruling family, and - asas we are inevitably associated with the SheiMi's despotic rule - more and more criticlsn of our connivance at the victimization of his shiah subjects. The Political Agent reports that a leading Bahralni, Ahnad al Khamjs, himself a victim of persecution a few years ago, recently visited him, and after expressing disappointment at Government's inaction, assured him that, the Shi ah s were convinced their only hope of relief lay in a vigorous Press agitation. There is some reason to believe, to9, that in pressing their old claim to the possession of Bahrain as they are doing at present, the Persian Government are influenced by the complaints of Bahrainis of whom, as Government are aware, there are large com munities in Lingah, Bundar Abbas, and ^ohammerah. All this merely confirms the opinion of the Foreip^i Office, which you nuoted in your telegram of the 10th July feat, that for the sake of the well-being of the Shiah population, and of our good name, the administrc tion of Bahrain is in groat need of improvement. 3. The reforms which Western Standards mi^t suggest as desirable are numerous; but it is not necessary to consider for the purpose of practical politics, more than the mintmum necessary for the removal of the most flagrant abuses. These are:- (a) The inequality of taxation as between Sunnis who evade all payment at present, and Shiahs. To remedy this the introduction of an equitable system of taxation is called for. (b) The liability of Shiahs to imprisonment and any other punishment at the mere whim of the ruler and his family without any kind of legal sanctions a state of thix ^gs which demands the introduction of a regular judicial system. (c) The complete disregard of the diving rules,andand the regultlnc; injustice to the divers who are at the mercy of the Nakhudas especially in the matter of their accounts. The observance of the rules, proper maintenance of accounts, and their production before some impartial tribunnal, ioust bo enforced* 4. The creation of machinery suitable for the purpose of carrying out such reforms would be a comparatively simple matter. But before entering upon details, it appears to me advisable to examine the consequences which their introduction is likely to involve in the conditions at present ruling in Bahrain, which make the problem more difficult ^of solution than when Government last considered the question. 5. The difference lies in the increased obstinacy and obstructiveness of Sheikh Isa himself. When I delivered the Government of India warning to him in March 1^22, he was thoroughly alarmed by the demonstrations of the Bahrain!s, and by the fear that drastic action was going to be taken. His fears speedily wore off when he found that nothing happened, and the question of reforms was not pressed. Since thon his character seems to be steadily deteriorating, owing no doubt to increasing age* Though physically he appears to be in sound health, mental ly he is in his dotage. Completely dominated by an ignorant and despotic wife, he is utterly opposed to change of any sort excopt such as will directly increase his income without adding to his .responsibilities. As M 4L an example of the old man , s intransigence Major Daly reports that the Municipality of Manameh have been trying in vain for the last two years to secure his consent to a scheme for the supply of water and electric power to the town. The whole 'Tunicipal Council sunported by nearly all the notables and both his sons approached hiirJ \i -to? C 1 him recently and begged him to give his approval• Though ho was not asP'ed to contribute in anyway to the cost of the undertaking, and was even offered a royalty on the water, he resolutely refused to agree, and would assign no reason for his refusal which is depriving the in habitants of much needed benefits. As an example of his credulity and ignorance Major Daly mentions the following: The roads near Manamah are being repaired and Major Daly procured some old rails discarded by the Army for use for small bridges* The Sheikh refused to allow these to be used on the ground they were Government pro perty,and Government would claim the ground they wore in! • if such is his attitude to schemes of purely material progress urged on him by his own family and subjects^ it can be supposed that there is no hope whatsoever that the sheikh will ever agree, save under strong compulsion, to the introduction of administrative changes which he would regard not as reform but as re action, and which are desired only by the Shiahs, and by the British Government, indeed such is his intract ability that it is extremely doubtful whether even strong moral compulsion would induce him to agree. A year ago, a hint of Government's severe displeasure would probably havo moved him. I do not think it is likoly to do so now. And if that failed, it would have to be followed up by a show of material force, or by a tightening of moral pressure - ending ultimately (for I can see no alternative) in the throat of deposition if he were to continue in an attitude of passive resistance. In all human probability such a threat would bring the Sheikh, and his wife, to their senses; but if it did not Government would have no choice but to carry out its throat, and that would only be done by resort to iorco, however embarassing the circumstances. inl&amp;s St In fact, onoo it Is decided to bring pressure to 'bear, it bGooraes impossible to guarantee that Government will be able to stop short at any particular point of moral or physical compulsion* ?• It follows that if Government are determind to put a stop to the abuses in Bahrain, they must be prepared to impose the Reforms upon the SheiWi; to support their introduction if necessary with material force (whether it be bombardment by H.M.Ships, or the actual deposition of the ruler); and finally to meet the criticism which is bound to be levelled gainst us by our ill-wishers for taking a strong line. For it is certain that any action which Government may decide to take in Bahrain will be closely watched both by Persians and by Arabs and sunnis generally; and especially by Bin Saud, whose hint at his recent interview with Sir Percy Cox as to the unpleasent situation of the Sheikh of Bahrain vis-a-via an aggressive Political Agent, plainly indicates w,hat his attitude as an ultra-orthodox Sunni is likely to be towards a vigorous policy of pro-Shiah reform in Bahrain. in This point has also been alluded to/the letter from the Political Agent,Bahrain, no. 111-C dated 3rd July 1922 enclosed with my letter no. 529-S dated 16th July 1922 (quod vide). The one easy solution is the natural succession of Sheikh Hamad who though ignorant is reasonable and progressive. He could be trusted to introduce the reforms himself with the advice of his Political Agent; and Government would be relieved of the unpleasent alternative of tolerating abuses or forcibly intervening to end them. But that solution need not be anticipated for some time. 8. For all practical purposes at present therefore Government is presented with a choice between these two alternatives, either of which is attended with difficulty. TheThe decision as to which course should be adopted mist bo governed by question of Imperial policy. Fut T feel bound respectfully to point out that in ny opinion sooner or later something will have to be done. Present inaction may only result in our hands being forced later on. On the other hano, if the matter is firmly grasped now, this advantage will at least follow that some definite good will be accomplished and an unsatisfactory condition of affairs ended. It would seem, then, that if action is to be taken it should be taken as soon as conveniently possible, but I recognize that it may be some time before the orders of K.ivl.(xovomraent can be obtained, in the meanwhile T am propa^ring the details of the required machinery which 1 hope to be able to submit to Government for their c approval if necessary, as soon as I am a/uainted with their decision. 9« To sum up, my opinion is as follows:- (1) The state of affairs in Bahrain calls for reform more urgently than ever. (ii ) But in his present mood the Sheikh may not yield even to strong moral pressure; and (roVemment must be prepared to back up moral pressure by material force if they are determind to carry through the Heforms. (iii )porcible intervention is bound to attract hostile criticism; but so too is inaction; and at any rate the former has the merit of achieving some good, Trhile the latter may be merely putting- off the evil day.

Lrd No.y-H Dated 9/lIay.1923 m In my opinion all facts are not 'before His Majesty' G-overn- ment . Shaikh-Isa 1 s case has not 'been fully presented and sufficient// consideration not paid to Sunni point of view. Further, Persian challenge was not before permanent, incumbent when he wrote . It is now directed not at our conduct of affairs but at our main position. Persian G-overnment will probably take Bahrain case before Internation Tribunal where our arrogant claiir? to protect all the world in Bahrain and interference with Shaiih Isa's independence will {tear invidious aspect . Things will leek even worse if, in the leatime , we have set aside an old man who must die soon and Shaikh Hamad will share all tne odium which our action will excite and nis useiulfiiess oe thereby destroyed, Rx Reforms will not placate Persian hostility but rather provoke the larger issue we are anxious oo avoid, ^urtner as Shaikh Isa is quite incapable of carrying out reforms , action proposed by India will certainly mean Shaikhs deposition and deportation of Abdulla and worse soill nis mother . These measures must set Sunni Shaikhs and .bin 3aud against us at a time when latters subsidy is ueing stopped. Incidentally they will involve considerable expense. Immediate ris^s are therefore enormous buo in any case as HKttiiRK matter of principle apart from Expediency I do not agree that 'misrule has reached such a pitch' . Matters are no worse than stste of affaiis we have tolerated for twenty years. '« r e have no real case against bhaikh Isa to justify such strong measures as deposition, ilere existance of clamour for reform is conclusive proof that position(2) r- 7 of foreigners is better not worse. As regards details of reform scheme Taxation. You will not carry responsible Sunni opinion with you- and this I regard as essential to success of reforms- tUnless you allow for privileged position of Sunnis. Pearl trade. It is positively unjust to hold A1 Khalifa family responsible for pearling abuses. Pearling reform is a G-ulf, not a Bahrain, question and can only be effected by European agency ; success is doubtful and only certain elements are expense of reforms and bitter hostilities your attempts will arouse. Dooj^toh j ^qIIowd. It follows that we should concentrate our strength on upholding status quo and not emphasise, by further intervention in Bahrain, weaker aspects of our case before international opinion . T^eir judgment would either consolidate our position v/hen we can reform to our heart's content i^ we so desire, or insist on our withdrawal or more probably still some indefinite middle course. In latter two eventualities we should withdraw with better grace and it will not -be Persian but Wahabis who i would sucfeed us . we can hang on uiitil either Shaikh Isa or Persian agitation die, v/e can introduce our reforms in natural course of events by insisting on suitable conditions before installing Shaikh Hamad. h*. tcL. jYlLiub .

The olitical .agent sees no necessity for deportation ol Abdullah, who has been behaving irreproachably ofof late.

I held a Vajlis on the 26th vay, which was well attended by representatives of all classes at Bahrain, ■ including the £1 Khalifa family, Dow^sir and othrr tnibes- men. These last, though urged to attend the tfajliss by Sheikhs Hamad and Abdullah, consulted Sheikh Tea before complying. He however sent them to attend, thereby acquiescing to an unexpected extent in the proceedings. The proceedings opened by a speech fro 7 ^ Hamad, well sn d fluently delivered by his brother, Mohammad, in whiQh Sheikh Tsa's fuljy ®powered' agent announced his intention of rulinfr and carrying on his fatherts policy of working for the c^ood of the peorle under A1 Khalifa rule, stating that he relied confidently on help promised* him by his brother Abdullah, and by the British Govt, to which the Al,Khalifa family we^e.steadfastly loyal. I followed speaVing in praise of Shei ,T h Isa's rule of bo years, dwelling.on the difficulties that surrounded him especially at the outset, and stating th^t there v, r as nothing to wonder at that at the age of he had found himself unwilling to ente^ on the stony path of reform, which would mean a constant struggle with petty tyrannies and independent communities that had ptow ^ 1 up during the •latter years of his lack of rule, as i preferred to call it and that therefore'Govt. had found .if necesr ary to introduce■M new blood and forbid Sheikh Tsa 's interference with the reforms which it had been found necessary to introduce to bring Bahrain up to the'plane of nodern civilisation. I said that no doubt many-Sunnis there would naturally view with regret the disappearance of their old ruler, to whoTii every body present including myself as representative - of h .-.GrOvt., owed a debt of gratitude for long and on the whole prosperoins rule of many years in srite of many difficulties andk covetous eyes on both sides of the Gul-f^ I indulged however in the hore that the reforms would lead to the ultimate benefit of the Sunni community. I contrast- - ed the rule of the 'Political Agent over foreigners with the Sheikh 5 s rule of Sunnis. The one w^s oren and above board, while the other had been behind the ptmdah and marked by the aloofness of the Sunni community from foreigr^ progress. Foreigners had progressed multiplied and prosper- -ed, while the Sunni community had lagged behind in the race and was not pulling its weight in± the boat or enjoying that preponderance in Bahrain affairs which was its birth- -right, and* I horded that Sheikh Hamad 1 s rule, assisted by his brother Abdullah and support^ by n.^.'iovt. against external aggression and internal sedition would 1ea^ thf Sunnis to their right place. • I then lectured each community* in turn, laid stress on the absolute necessity for strong rule of one Sheikh of the AI Khalifa family and not the irresponsible rule of ?0or more persons appointed by and responsible to themselves alone. So much w s in English, read out later in Arabic. ^ I then turned to Hamad and ga ^ve him in Arabic and in public some useful advice for his future guidance, explaining that for one word to Hamad, I spoke six to my other hearers. Both sDeeches were well received by a represent— -ative audience, and both hanad and Abdullah are enthusiast- -ic and were especially pleased at the flattering references to ^heikh Isa. As far as can be judged, the Bahrain reform'-' I H I ■ -V gr19/1*5.

He said that, with few and unirportant except- - ions, no Persian in Bahrain desired Persian rule or the • severance of British connection with Bahrain. Local Persians were genuinely delighted at the discomfiture of Qasaibi and imagined that the steps taVen by us were purely on their account-.

I regard it as of first importance that such \ Assistant be despatched at earliest possible moment before enthusiasm has time to wear off. Daly suggests Shuldham who has already worked under him and knows Arabic . But I regard it as of first importance that the selected Assistant should be officer with legal knowledge especially on admin istrative side . My experience in Basra leads me to suppose that with such a selection Bahrain Court under Bahr- rain Order in Council might be entirely self-supporting or so nearly so that a modest contribution from Bahrain Customs would enable Bahrain itself to pay fer this parti cni.lar yelorm and entail no extra expense to Government ior this particular reform. Knowledge of Arabic though desirable is not essent^- iai for it will be nowhere quicker learnt than in miscellan eous legal work. Daly anticipates no present difficulty about accomodation. A man of Sidney's stamp would be in - valuable. Daly must have his hands free and time to think. When the Arab side of Bahrain Government is running smoothly post of Judicial Adviser to Bahrain Government might be reduced and political Agent take over work again, say in live years 1 time . I trust urgent steps may be taken to give effect to this proposal already sanctioned in principle t subject to India's remarks, by Secretary of State for Inaia in his telegram No. 1844 dated 18th May.

We, all the Shiah Bah;aronah residents, be^ to state that since about 50 years that you apoointe^l 11.E, Shaikh Isa ben Ali A1 Khalifah in this town, we were in quite peace and comfort till 30 years. Then v/hen Shaikh Isa^ family grow up the rules were changed owin^ to the subdivision of the villa,^ej among them and every one was acting des^oticly apcording to his own opinion and had an absolute control over the subjects. For this reason the public were rebelled and we did not see anything except that the oppression, cruelty, plunder and murder were increased and we endured every evil in those years until v/e could not bear it. We seeked redress from H.E. Shaikh Isa ben Ali but found that he was unable to use his influence over his sons, cousins and his relations. The oppression were increased on us and we again asked him for redress and reminded him of the oppressions done to us. We asked him to remove oppressions, fine and employment by force, etc, as the ruler was one and the Bahrain Island is too small to have so many rulers of v/omen and men because we do not know who '.s the ruler over us. He gave us a document signed by him v. lich was kept in the British iigency, but v/e 'do not see that out of the conditions one was carried out. We came to know that it was due to his disability and weakness as he was advanced in age and was unable to superintend the rules and to establish order in the town, -i-he object of writing this is to ask that we may be given assurance, oppressions removed from us, order established in the town and our lives and properties safe guarded because vie cannot live at rest and safety v/hen we see that so many men would be killed and every night raids are made on villages such as the matter of the Aali village and v/hat was happened to its inhabitants by murder of men and plunder of property and also the raids which virere made on Karzakan etc and the llanamah itself and what was happened in it.

Dated Simla,the fLf -June 1923. APPCINTli/iEOT OF A BHITISH A33ISTAMT TO THE POLITICAL AGENT,BAH^SIN. Sir, I am directed to refer to your telegram No. 482,dated the 29th Hay 1923. 2. It is open to question whether the Secretary of State's telegram to which you allude can he held to do more than give a general approval to the immediate course of action proposed by you at Bahrein. In any case the sugges tion that the Political Agent at Bahrein should be given a British Assistant is one which obviously demands more detailed explanation than can be given by telegram.I am therefore to ask that, to enable the Government of India ft to give/this proposal the consideration which it deserves, you will submit it again by letter showing in detail the probable cost of the proposed appointment, whether any t portion thereof should in your opinion be met from Bahrein revenues, and how much of the estimated cost is likely to be covered by Court-fees and judicial receipts. I need hardly remind you that any proposals involving an additional charge on Indian revenues require the strongest justification at the period of general retrenchment. 3. If it is your intention that Bahrein revenues should bear any part of the charge, you will presumably support this proposal by argument justifying it both on grounds of precedent and also of propriety. It is understood that the main function of the incumbent of the post to be created is to exercise jurisdiction over foreigners and decide theirdisputes. If so, are you satisfied that the Shaikh can with propriety he called upon to contribute .seeing that he has ceded jurisdiction over foreigners to the repre sentative of the protecting power- On the other hand, if Bahrein revenues hear the cost or any part of it, they would seem to-be entitled to receive some portion of the resultant revenue. 4. The Grovemment of India have- recognised that the introduction of the reforms at Bahrein may necessitate the provision of .some relief from petty cases and routine work for the Political Agent. But they are of opinion that he must be on his guard against being tempted to interfere too much and too directly in the ShallcV s affairs and to become the , . i actual administrator rather than the adviser and counsel! or. Nor are they altogether satisfied that the importance of the Agency to India is sufficient to Justify the appointment to it of a second British officer. It was their original intention to consider on the introduction of the reforms the filling tne existing appointment of Indian Assistant (to v/hich no allusion is made in your telegram) and before considering other proposals they desire an expression of your opinion whether this would not suffice. • • * * * 0 * • • ■ , 5. It is perhaps premature at this stage to examine in detail your suggestion that the Assistant Political Agent Bahrein should normally look for the reversion of the Bahrein Agency,but on further reflection you will perhaps agree that any such arrangement is open to obvious objection and is bound to result in administrative inconvenience. ^ .

This affair - the one referred to by Major Daly in the open^ing sentences of his memoran dum - should be settled according to Shara and, strictly speaking, by a Sunni Qazi, the forum of the defendants; but it will be difficult to get the Baharinah to accept such a judgement.

The Residency, Bushlre, 30tli June 1023* To My dear Bray, Very many thanks for your private letter of the 13th June and for your kind oongratulatione on my handling of the Bahrain tangle# I only hope you will be able to repeat them when the full text of all that I did at Bahrain and particularly my speech at the 'Majliss' is before you* At times I folt that I was sailing very near the wind and might be treading on other people's toes and perhaps occasionally going a little beyond my instructions when I , began to set forth what shaikh Hamad, Daly and I proposed to do in Bahrain# 2* I am afraid I must agree with you that the official answer to my telegram No. 482 of the 29th May is very un satisfying, but I will proceed to consider your three points seriatim* As to (l) I can clear the ground at once by saying that I do not expect you to bear one penny of the cost* I realised at the outset that that would be hopeless in these days and I saw no reason why India should bear the cost. Daly and I by a two-line order to the Director of Oustoms, Bahrain, have stopped a drain of V?. 1,000/- a day, half of which, H? 500/-, was, so the legend goes, to all intents, buried. Just try to realise what that meansi All this wealth comes from the ttiflux of foreigners who have been encouraged to come there by the greater security afforded to them by British protection, and surely we are, on general principles alone, justified in insisting that D« de S. Bray, Esqr*, C.3.I.,C.I.E.,C.x3.E., Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and^ Political Department, SIMLA#that the Bahrain Customs, fed by foreigners, should contri bute to the cost of a court designed to give those foreign ers the ordinary benefits of law and justice* I shall not say more at present for I shall revert to the subject again in considering your point (3)* As to (2), Daly, like all other Mesopotamians, is by no means in love with India or India*s institutions* By the way, I fully agree that he is a capital officer and I do not disguise from myself the possibilities of over-zeal* I had already sounded a note of warning in my telegram Tie* B-l dated 15th May 1923 that there was grave danger that the position in Bahrain might approximate to that of TT uscat* Perhaps this was overstating the case, for iruscat is a dead city while Mananeh is a live and flourishing town and has every prospect of a brilliant future* But the danger will be borne in mind and guarded against as carefully as possible and after all, in my view, the danger was none of our seek ing* Trevor - you can read it througji and through the lines of his despatches, not to mention his private letters which reach me by evory mail - was as opposed to the Bahrain reform as ho very well could be* I sent in a fierce remonstrance which called down upon me a reprimand* India's telegrams were cautious in the extreme but the Foreign Office, London, determined to placate Persia, insisted on the reforms and they were hurried through in the course of a week and we are left with the baby on our hands to evolve order out of a welter of chaos* But I must not further anticipate now, I will come back to this in my closing paragraph* Now I turn to your point (3) *1 am sure that you will agree that it will be unwise to over-elaborate the judicial system'* You will forgive my smiling at the dialectical skill with which you combat my proposals and at the same time ask me to be the first to agree that they are r&amp;diculoue and unsound* I have too ctuch legal blood and too many legal relations to be particularly alarmed at law, courts and lawyers* What does upset me is that while we have anan elaborate Order in Coimcll with elastio powers of expans ion, the court that administers the law on that Order should be the travesty of a court of justice and the plaything of a l Olitical Oliicer who lias no legal training itfhatover, in his sc .nty leisure noments* Every step of the reforms, the settlement of revenue, the regulaMzation of the Customs, the network of municipal rights as against private holders when property begins to take definite shape in the town of Manamoh, is going to land him in a maze of legal technicali ties* People die, are born, they encroach on each other's rights and on the public rigjits, they go bankrupt and are fugitives from justice In India, and the Political Agent is Cjcpooted, struggling with administrative problems, to compose ^.11 these private quarrels in his leisure moments or allow them to settle themselves which only makes confusion worse confounded and nullifies his measures of reform# I want to give him assistance and have chosen the path of least resist ance whereby at a comparatively small cost to the administra tion - I uyself believe, at no cost - he can shuffle off all these minor worries on to the shoulders of a trained judicial adviser. If, as I recognise is only too likely to be the case, we have at times to drive a coach and four through the Bahrain Order in Council, at least let it be done by someone who has handled the ribbons before and has some rudimentary notions of how to drive. As judges and magistrates, Daly and his predocessor, Dickson, were beneath contempt and would probably be the first to admit the fact. Behind them stretch a long line of temporary holders who had no time and probably not the inclination to tackle Bahrain legal problems, which are, in themselves, of absorbing interest. I shall tell the Judicial Adviser, as I see him in my mind's eye, that he is at all times to keep a most watchful eye on his receipts and expenditure and that to a very great extent the measure of hiB success win be the smallness of the amount which he requires to draw from the Bahrain Customs revenues. He must drag ovcry penny of receipts and expenditure into the limelightllnolight and 'bo prepared for oriticitsn 'by the Political Agent, by Shaikh Hamad, by the Political Resident as Chief Court and by the Foreign and Political Department of the Govornment of India. 4* Kovr with your gracious permission I am going to scold you. As I have said above, the reforms were forced upon us and were carried through in a week or ten days and I have a Political Agont working practically single-handed and alone in a wet-bulb temperature of 100° and it takes me 16 days to get a reply to my telegraphic proposals and what does the roply amount to¥ It amounts to this, that T am to send in a regular proposition statement carefully arranged to conciliate all departmental prejudices, giving precedents, facts and figures which simply do not exist. The Bahrain Court has been let down and no one can possifcly stato what would be the judicial receipts if it were pro perly worked. There goes one side, and the most important side, of your budget. It is the business of the new judicial adviser to work it up and I safeguard you against loss by guaranteeing that Bahrain should pay for it itself. On general principles, a town of 80,000 inhabitants, many of whom are cosmopolitan traders, Buniyas, Boras, Persians, Jews British firms, Paris pearl merchants, can and will read ily adapt itself to modem Justice and can and should pay for the privilege. To my mind it is the foundation of all things and the machinery is there already. As regards the expenditure side of the account the only important point to my mind is that the judicial officer selected should not be of a status superior to the Political Agent. I should be inclined to pay him a salary of K*? 1,000 a month: and with regard to court clerks, Nazars, books and all the other paraphernalia of a court of justice, ho Trtust work up to them as funds permit and within those funds I would give him carte blanche provided that every penny was brought to account and to audit.5. I deal with your letter aa it should in the ordinary course of official routine be dealt with, I shall have to send it to Bahrain, pester the Political Agent r already fully occupied, with the preparation of figures that when produced would be thoroughly unreliable* And all the tine please renember that the letter post to Bahrain sees onoe a fortnight. It would be six months before this worthless statenent could be sanctioned and m ^h© meant imo riy sapling of Bahrain reforms will be growing up all crooked* G. I don't ask India to pay anything. I ask them to lend me a carefully selected officer on deputation* If they can't find one, let me know by telegram and let me look elsewhere# Sir a .T^Wilson or Sir Henry Dobbs In Mesopotamia could probably find the man in a week but of course I realise that this will mean saddling the Indian Political Department with an officer with shadowy claims on the Indian Political Department which might prove in the future extremely Inconvenient. Can you not help me to get on with the job, unwelcome as it is, to give the Foreign Office proposal a chance to matured Goin,^ back to the official letter No. 1683/1460-.E dated 14th June, I still st-Lclc to my point that the Judicial officer should, during this period of probation of the Bahrain reforms, be the future Political Agent, Bahrain, and be considered to be in training for the job. I have already answered of ficially about the Indian Assistant and would add the foll owing rotearlrs. Our experience in Bahrain has, I fear, in this respect been unfortunate and Shaikh Hamad 1 s personal experience when he visited India in January 1921 on a round of sight-seeing, was most trnfortunate. The Indians who accompanied him, I regret to nay, utterly failed to realise their responsibilities and instead of protecting the Shaikh against unprincipled adventurers, were the first themselves to set forward rapacious claims and.although shaJJdi Hanad ±3 too nuch of a gentlonan to G( of their bohaviovi^, I have every reason to 3mow that ho was thoroughly disgusted r/lth them, and I could not possibly reooamond that he should 'be called upon to bear the cost of an Indian Judicial Adviser vrhc would be thoroughly un popular in the islands* Thanking you once again for the opportunity of thrashing the 'whole thing out in frank and friendly private I remain. Yours sincerely,PRIVATE . The Residency, pushire, 30th Jine 1923 . My dear Daly , The following cotiea of private correspondence between mysell and Bray will no doubt Interest and exasperate you as they have done me. They must of course not be quoted in any official correspondence . Shaikh Eaaad . I want hiiL to realise th^t, if we can over- come this pernicious departmental vis inertiae , he must be cost which I have every reason to believe will be fully repaid to him . Further, that he must be prepared to surrender, to be spent by the Foreigners • Court for Foreigners, all judicial receipts including - and this is most important - all costs of execution proceedings which form part of the or-inary revenues of a court of Justice. 1 aa under a vague imj-resdion that as civil executions were performed by and through fidawis , they used , probably at exorbitant rates , to be the perquisites of the Amir? . Put of course I am talking of fifteen years back and you may have changed all that , and it may be innecessary to go into worrying details with Phaikh Hamad now. Fidawis could be replaced by Court bailiffs enlisted , paid for and res-* ponslble qy arxf to the Court which would only in emergencies enlist the aid of the Executive. Pome conversations of this kind warning Shaikh Hamad of what is in front of him would be most useful when the time^comes to secure his formal consent. 1 need not go over , here , the general principles which to my mind entirely justify our demand on the Bahrain Customs . You will find them all m my iwtter to Pr*y . I hope that la the end the demand will be very sniall , perhaps even the court become a paying proposition and give some contribution towards the cost of police . What 1 want you to do now is to pave the way with prepared to pay out of Bahrain Customs revenues , some initial Yours sincerely, Wajor C .K.Daly , Political Agent , Pahr^in.OCmP • No • -s or 1923.

Finances Bahrain are causing him some temporary anxiety as it is slack season for Customs and unpaid debts have been coming in. He does not doubt eventual solvency but money is now tight. He therefore thinks that while Bahrain can afford to pay lor Customs expwrb,which Shaikh Hamad has accepted , no further burden should be imposed for the present. When finances are again flourishing , he thinks legal assistance should not take form ol permanent judicial Adviser but preferably judicial expert advice much as deputation of Customs expert.
