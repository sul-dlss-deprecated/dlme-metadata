Bahrain Receipt Dear Sirs We refer you to our letter of 6th May wherein was mentioned the difficulty that this Company was experiencing in obtaining adequate monthly supplies of postage stamps in the higher denominations from the local Post Office. We believe that a postal franking machine, such as our associates, Caltex (India) Limited, are using, might solve the problem since our stamp requirements would be re duced to a small monthly order for the lower denominations to use on our employees 1 mail. We also believe that such a machine should enable us to handle our mail more expeditiously, than in the past. It would be necessary that the machine be equipped for the higher denomination stamps, say up to Rs. 10, 15, 25 because of the weight of our individual postal packages. We understand that these machines are loaned out on a hire basis. Will you please advise as soon as possible whether a machine could be made available for our use and on what terms. Yours very truly, THL BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED R. M.
