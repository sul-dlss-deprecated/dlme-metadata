He speaks of his upbringing and education in the U.S. , coming to AUC in 1964, its changing (diminished Christian missionary) nature by then, and leading faculty present when he arrived. He describes the Main campus (including the flooding of the Palace Building during the final inundation of the Nile), and AUC’s expansion with the acquisition of the Greek School campus. He also addresses the impact of the 1967 and 1973 wars on AUC, conditions in Egypt during the interwar period (during which time he was out of the country), government surveillance, and the controversy over President Chris Thoron’s previous association with the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Rodenbeck discusses the English and Comparative Literature Department during his time at AUC, describing its multidisciplinary nature (hosting arts, theater, and philosophy), longtime chair Doris Shoukri and other faculty members, and students in its programs (also offering a portrait of AUC students in general). The internationally-known authors and poets (like William Styron) invited to AUC as Distinguished Visiting Professors are mentioned as well.  The American studies initiative at AUC and his own role are addressed too. Rodenbeck outlines his term as director of the AUC Press in the 1970s, covering his efforts to avoid its closure, the introduction of new accounting methods, and its publishing record achieved in the face of technical printing challenges. He also offers an assessment of Lawrence Murphy’s book on the history of AUC that was being edited at the time, commenting on the origins of the university. Life in Cairo is also described extensively, ranging from conditions in Cairo like transportation and the unavailability of basic foods in the 1960s, residing in Maadi, socializing by expatriate AUC professors and others, and his wife Elizabeth’s (Buffy’s) pursuits.</dc:description><dc:subject>American University in Cairo--History.</dc:subject><dc:publisher>Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:publisher><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:source>AUC Oral Histories; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2017, American University in Cairo.
