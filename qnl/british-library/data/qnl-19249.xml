Kemball writes to account for the current delay in sending a number of slaves to Bombay. Enclosed with Kemball’s letter (not included in the volume) was a letter from Lieutenant Alexander Foulerton, Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf. The delay may have been caused by a marriage proposal made to one of the female slaves to be despatched, to which Kemball makes reference in relation to Foulerton’s letter.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024052050.0x000003#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
