In view of these facts t I propose that the Sub- Office at Koweit should no longer be considered part, of the Indian Post Office but should be considered part of the Civil Postal Administration of Iraq, its revenues arid expenditure being treated similarly to those of the other Civil Post Offices in Iraq. I have discussed the case with the Civil Commissioner, who concurs. In this connection I enclose a copy of letter No. 9793, dated the 17th May 1918, from the Civil Commissioner, to the .

She case as now presented seems to be oaseu on - (1) the congestion in the Indian Post Offio. at Ahwaa which delays the onward despatch of the mails to che oil fields; and (2) the delay and pilfering which takes place in the Persian Customs over the parcels post. As, however, all parcel traffic to and from the Persian Gulfhas now been suspended, it is thought that this relieve the congestion at Ahwaz and will also do away entirely with the delay in the Persian Customs. In such circumstances, and in view of the opinions No. 758-F, dated the 13th December 1916, it is not lively that His Majesty's Government would regard the so .erne more favourably at this juncture than when it was onginally to move further in the matter at present unless there are Indian Post Office than those put forward in Captain Memorandum no.^fjO E.A.

W ilson, Deputy Chief Political Officer, Basra, to the Chief Political Officer, Baghdad. Xo. 9855. Chief Political Office, Basra, Sir, 21st July 1917. I have the honour to submit herewith as directed a report on the present situation in Northern Arabistan. 1 have prefaced it with a brief resume of the circumstances which necessitated the various steps taken during the last two years to restore and maintain order there. 1 have added an appendix on the situation in Luristan and the Luristan road. 2. On the outbreak of war with Turkey a political officer was stationed at Dizful, in connection primarily with railway survevs, and there was a British Consular Agent, a Persian of good family, at Shushtar. We had had little or no practical relations with the notables of Shnshtar, a town notorious for its faction lights and fanaticism; but thanks to the presence since 1911 at Dizful for the greater part of the year of a British Officer, the attitude of the notables and people of that town towards the British had for some time been iriendly and helpful, and progress had been made in the same direction with the tribes of Luristan. 1 Ik Lolita al Officei at Ihzful was withdrawn shortly after the outbreak of \\di and posted to fvurnah ; this step was taken not as a consequence of the hostile attitude of the inhabitants, but because no other officer was available, and because railway developments in Luristan were not likely to materialize during the war. Our Consular Agent at Shushtar resigned soon afterwards, partly for private reasons, and partly no doubt owing to the (act that when the Jihad agitation commenced in Arabistan it became cltai that we weie not m a position to give him effective personal protection. r). I ho m\jsionol Aiabistan b\ tbe lurks m January 1915, synchronized with the vigorous preaching of the Jihad by itinerant priests from Najaf and Kerbela in Turkish pay, or under the influence of Turkish threats. The campaign had some success in Shushtar, and had an unfavourable effect on the attitude of Persian employes on the Oil Fields, where many Shushtaris are employed. A single fanatical outbreak on the Fields at this time might have forced the Company to close down altogether, as some of the subordinate European Staff were already very nervous, Ahwaz having been evacuated by the European community in February and the pipe line cut, leaving the fields en Vair. Fortunately no Such outbreak occurred. 1 he campaign had less effect at Dizful, where tbe principal priests counselled moderation or held aloof; but it would have been difficult for a European to have remained in Dizful at this time. 4. In March 1915 Wassmuss and his party of Germans, with Indian and 1 ersian Seditiomsts, passed from Turkey through Pusht-i-Kuh and went to Shiraz, stopping for a time at Shushtar, where he was warmly welcomed ■ theie is little doubt that he could have caused a complete stoppage of work at the jields by inciting attacks against Europeans or on the pumping station, but, as is known from captured documents, such action would have prematurely disclosed the German plan of campaign in Persia, and probably lor this reason he passed on to Behbehan and Shiraz without dom* anv damage. ^ J 5. In May 1915 Amara was occupied, and in September of the same year vut c, .' maiah, the situation m Arabistan became relatively normal, and the pipe line was repaired. Dizful and Shushtar, however, ivere rent by a renewal of faction fights and tribal raids, the immediate result of which S 371 40 10 17 ||was a general decrease o[ the area under cultivation and much damage to trade. c ^ 6. In September 1915, it was decided to make a large purchase of mules and other supplies in South-West Persia for military requirements, and purchasing officers were sent to Shushtar and I)izful‘ where they worked under arrangements made by His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Ahwaz; the countn was at this time in such a disturbed state that no caravans travelled unless strongly guarded. The Sagwands wore raiding Ghazban and other tribes in Aiabistan and Mesopotamia, and vice versa, trade was at a standstill and the 1 eisian Customs and Revenue Departments could not collect enough to pay the salaries of their local representatives, much less finance the Local Government. J he puK.hase of mules was carried out under circumstances of considerable difficulty and at a heavy expenditure in blackmail. 7. In hebiuary 191b, a large party of Persian gendarmes, who had joined the Germans, and lately the Turks in Persia, and had been defeated by the Russians, then advancing on Karmanshah and Khanikin, endeavoured to return to their homes in the Bakhtiyari country and Ispahan through Pusht-i-Kuh. They were intercepted near Dizful by a strong detachment of our cavalry,^ the majority were killed or captured, and the remainder dispelsed. I hen leaders, two young Bakhtiyari Khans, were captured, but were released soon afterwards on representations by the Ilkhani. They subsequently joined the German Kardorff and took a prominent part against the Russians and ourselves in Ispahan. A second party was similarly dealt with shortly afterwards. The incident had an excellent effect on our prestige in the district, and had a widespread effect in Luristan and Pusht-i-Kuh. 8. I his phase of the situation was succeeded by less favourable developments. Kut was captured by the Turks and during the following months the Russians were forced to evacuate successively Karmanshah and Hamadan. Ihe situation m Persia gave rise to considerable anxiety,,and the attitude of the Bakhtiyari Khans became equivocal. 9. In view of our past, experience and having regard to the greatly increased importance, both to the Mesopotamia Expeditionary Force, and to the Admnalty, of the oil fields it was realised that we could not afford to usk a return to the status quo m ISiorthern Arabistan. it seemed equallv cleai that ioi the same reasons the enemy would not again neglect the chance ol ruining the fields and of threatening our flank, and militarv and political measures were concerted accordingly. . . 10. A Political Officer (Mr. E. B. Soane) was sent to Dizful with instructions to get in touch with the tribes, to prevent enemy agents from having access to the district, to encourage so far as practicable co-operation by the Luristan tribes with the Russians, and to take such steps as were necessary to prevent the local situation from getting out of hand in the event of the situation in Central Persia turning to our disadvantages, as seemed at one time very probable. The military authorities were known to be averse to sending troops to Dizful or Shushtar, but they were none the less anxious lliat no stone should be left unturned to ensure that, in the event of further Turkish successes in Central Persia, Northern Arabistan should not again become a hot-bed of intrigue in which German propaganda would flourish, with a consequent menace to the fields ; the detachment at Shush was strengthened and the garrison at'Ahwaz increased. II. By the early autumn matters had apparently reached a critical stage in Central Persia, and it seemed likely that the Turks would make a further considerable advance. The whole situation in Arabistan came under review on the occasion of the visit of the Commander-in-Chief in India to Basrah, and after being referred home, it was decided to take steps to provide amilitary guaid -for the pumping station, near tlie oil fields, and to be prepared to take further steps for the protection of the iields in the event of necessity arising. Orders were given for the completion of various bridges at strategical points, and for the accumulation of stores, &amp;c. l!?. At about this time, the Persian Government, after several abortive attempts to send a representative to Arabistan, nominated one Ain ul Mulk as Governor, to reside at Shushtar. The appointment is financially one of the most unattractive in Persia, and soon after his appointment he came to Basrah to ask for assistance in obtaining funds from the Belgian Director of Customs at Mohammerah, in the latter’s capacity as Financial Controller. After-much trouble a certain sum per month was obtained for him, to be spent in^accordance with the “Budget” authorised in Tehran. The . however, was so modest, and the prospect of obtaining additional income from other sources so remote, having regard to the long standing disrepute into which the office of Governor had fallen, that it was found necessary later on to increase it by a personal allowance (from British sources) It soon became clear, however, that without much more supervision than could be exercised from a distance, the Governor would not “ make good from any point of view. The notables of the town openly flouted mu, it was clear that Ins resignation would be deferred only until such time as he had accumulated a few months’ pay and extorted what he could from the weaker of his clients. On the other hand, he was well meaning and friendly, and nothing was likely to be gained by a change. 13. A Political Officer, Mr. 0. J. Edmonds, Levant Consular Service was therefore sent to Shushtar to act. as the Governor’s adviser when indicated and m particular to see that he expended the sum allotted to him in accoidance wnh the official “.Budget” approved in Tehran This appointment ha,1 the destred effect: before long the Customs, Revenue Judicial and Opium Departments recommenced under their old heads’ l-l A', ul Mulk applied for and obtained three months’ leave in M-iv and IS hkely to return in September. The climate of Shushtar is considered unhealthj and hot by Persians unaccustomed to it, and few Governors- Gtneial have ever spent the summer there. He left one of his principal in rpiffirf a S b'ffi C h™. n administration has since run fairly smoothly, 15. There have been few robberies in the district. The roads are kept safe by several guard houses, some of which have been erected durim- the puTlA lm ?l' Vn i rS ’ eml)oldened .'by the unaccustomed tranquillity of the past.

This number could not be reduced without risk. They wear Persian dress and supply their own horses and uniform. The cost of the present establishment of the Political Officer at Shushtar works out at about 2001. per mensem, inclusive of his own salary and the Governor’s extra allowances. 17. The position at Dizful, which I will now endeavour to describe, differs from that at Shushtar principally in the following respects :— (i) When our representative went to Dizful there was not a Deputy Governo r in the town, nor had there been one for many years. The restoration of order had to be framed with due regard to this fact. Hie Customs, Revenue, Opium, and other Depart ments existed in a moribund condition. They are now in active working order and their receipts have considerably increased. (ii) Shushtar is not a centre in which tribes have to be considered, except the Pakhtiyari, to whom a special officer is accredited. Dizful, on the other hand, is the market town and political focus of all Luristan, and our policy at Dizful must be guided with due regard to this fact. It cannot simply be regarded as a town in North Arabistan. (iii) Dizful is a frontier town and district marching with Mesopotamia for many miles, and our representative there has to deal with Arab tribes from across that border, as well as with Lurs and Pakhtiyari and with Arabs of Arabistan proper. • 18. The Political Officer has been obliged in consequence to take a more direct part in the administration, and this circumstance has been accentuated by the fact that local conditions have hitherto made it impossible to start a Judicial Department with local talent, and by the fact that questions of importance outside the town, as indicated above, take up much of his time and determine his attitude towards internal .matters. 19. Ain ul Mulk soon after his appointment to Shushtar proposed to send his assistant, Asad ud Dauleh, to Dizful as Deputy-Governor. This individual was, however, notoriously so unfitted for the post by his habits and temperament that Ain ul Mulk was asked to defer his despatch and willingly agreed to do so. 20. A Persian Deputy-Governor is, however, still a desideratum, and if Ain ul Mulk, who is now on leave at Tehran, could be asked to bring with him a suitable candidate, who would work in harmony with our officer there, the position of the Persian Government would be further strengthened without serious or permanent detriment to the present administration. 1 met a number of merchants and local notables at Dizful and saw the various branches of the administration, which one and all appear to be a source of satisfaction and even of pride to the community at large, excepting only such local hotables as have had their former power for evil restricted. The powerful pnesthood at Dizful, as at Shustar, are supporters of the present regime, and the common people share their views. 21. This fact need not, however, deter us from endeavouring to re-establish the traditional hierarchy by securing the appointment of a Persian Deputy - Governor. The possibility of appointing a Judicial (Adliyeh) Department is more doubtful. No such institution has ever been known in Dizful, and many difficulties are likely to arise when the attempt is made. But it is of first importance that this institution should be established if possible. Once it is done, it will be easier to start other branches of the local administration. 22. That the Dizful is are not without public spirit or enterprise is demonstrated bv the readiness with which thev subscribed some 4,0U0J.0 towards the rebuilding of the bridge, which had broken down so completely that local talent was quite unable to encompass its repair. 'Die bridge crosses the Diz river, which is practically always unfordable, and gives the town access to the rich lands across the river,, the nomad tribes and to Burnjird and Hamadan beyoryl. Thanks to the hearty co-operation of the military authorities at Ahwazand Basrah, to the services of engineers lent by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and to the skill of local masons, the main gap in the bridge was spanned by a rapidly improvised suspension bridge of 160 feet in length, the other arches were repaired with brick and much work done, in spite of the lateness of ihe season, on the foundations. ! he tolls taken on traffic crossing Ihe bridge have exceeded expectations, and place the soundness of the scheme as a paying concern beyond doubt. Structural weaknesses which have developed (the bridge was hastily erected with,such material as was then available in the Field Bark at Basrah) are now being remedied by a Royal Engineer officer kindly lent by General Officer Commanding, Ahwaz. T&gt;. Public security is maintained by a few watchmen within the town, whilst order is maintained in the district on both sides of the Diz by a force of 45 mounted men di'awn from the Sagvvands, a Lur tribe, now semi- sedentary, living opposite to Dizful west of the Diz. This tribe has for many years terrorised the districts and pillaged Bakhtiyari and other piopeity alike with absolute impunity. Organised on Persian lines, this force is at present being trained by a British officer lent by the military authorities. ^ Its pay is at present met from British sources, but it is a legitimate diaige on the 1 eisian (lovernment, and should be charged thereto as soon as practicable. — 1. It is unnecessary, for the purposes of this report, to go into further details icgarding the administrative and executive work being performed by the political officer or under his supervision. That it is being well done, and with good results, I have satisfied myself by personal inspection. That it is welcomed by the people and by the local representatives of the Persian Government I equally have no doubt. ~o. I think it is apparent from the foregoing that it would be most unwise, during the period of the war, to countenance any steps which might lead to an alteration in the present position to our disadvantage by a slackening of our control. ^ \Ve do not know what the future holds in store for us. More than once m the past three years the fortune of war has temporarily'gone against us and om allies in these regions, and on each occasion it has turned again in our favour. If our present position in Arabistan is maintained we need not apprehend a rapid revulsion of local feeling, even if the situation in Persia or Iraq should again become temporarily unfavourable. LTi. It is of special importance, from this point of view, not to encourage foi the present the political aspirations of the Bakhtiyari Khans in the bhushtai and Dizful districts. 1 heir considerable landed interosts are amply protected, and they have this year farmed out their estates at higher rentals than for many }eais past. But their rapacious predilections and the incuiabl\ \ idem anti high-handed methods of their agents make them uniteisadv Jeaiod, whilst the anti-British or anti-foreign tendencies of some of them make it a matter of first importance from every' point of view that they should be dissuaded, or in the last resort prevented, under existing circumstances, from descending on the town, as of old, for three months in the winter, to levy taxes, lines, Ac., at wall, departing, in March for the hMi country again. ° After the war it should be quite possible to come to a satisfactory agree ment with them on the subject, but conditions are too unsettled for tins to be practicable at present and the allegiance of individual Khans too uncertain.27. As to the future, assuming that Mesopotamia will be administered by us, it would appear that all considerations, political, military and above all economic, point to the maintenance in Arabistan of some such system as at present in vogue, under which commercial enterprise, both indigenous and foreign, has some prospect of success, and agriculture is encouraged. The practical results, even though partly negative, of the large increase of cultivation at Ihzful and Shushtar this year have not been mi important j famine has been averted for this year, ami if good rains fall next year, the crops should be larger than for many years past, resulting in a substantial diminution of tonnage for military needs. _b'&gt;. It is abundantly clear from the trend of recent pronouncements at home that in matters economic His Majesty’s Government do not intend to pursue for the future a laissez-faire policy, and from the recently published 1 report of the Mesopotamia Trade Commission, it is equally clear that Arabistan is the province par excellence m Persia m'w hich British economic ' interests, actual and prospective, are strongest and most susceptible of development. With unlimited acres of good soil, almost unlimited water, and cheap fuel, it is a paradise for engineers and agriculturists. Even now the oil-fields are producing, f am given to understand, one and a hab times as much oil as the wliole of Burma, and with additional pumps the capacity of the present pipe lines can be quadrupled. 20. The total present cost of the Dizful Agency including this 2 guard (an expensive item) and the salaries of the officers concerned, is about 2,000/. a month, a sum which may be considered large if regarded as purely diplomatic or consular expenditure. Regarded, however, as politico-military expenditure and compared with the very large sum expended, with almost precisely similar objects, in Ears, the expenditure is inconsiderable,' and thoroughly justified by tangible results, which have in them every element of permanence. 30. The presence of a small military force in Arabistan is, however, essential for some years to come to the stability of the new administration, and it is of great importance that when military dispositions in this area are reconsidered, the necessity, in the interests of the oil-fields, and of the maintenance by the Persian Government of order in Shushtar and Dizful, of retaining a force on the Karim should be borne in mind. Its precise location need not be considered at present. 31. In conclusion, 1 would bring to notice the fact that during the last 18 months we have received overt support and assistance from many quarters in Dizful and Shushtar, particularly from the priests and merchants. The satisfaction of these classes at the present tranquillity of affairs is tempered by a lively apprehension of tl\e retribution that would be wreaked on them were any change of policy to make possible the return of their quondam oppressors, some of whom have not hesitated at murder, rape or robbery in the past. Some of our supporters would have no option but to leave the district permanently, and many vmuld lose practically all they now possess. In the interest of our good name, therefore, we should do our best to ensure continuity of administration by means of the nomination of friendly independent Governors by the Persian Government.

The Situation in Luristan and the Luristan Road. * The appearance of an organised administration at Dizful, the market town of the greater part of Luristan, the pacification of the Sagwand and their successful conversion from the pursuit of robbery to that of agriculture, to their own great profit, awoke varying ambitions amongst Luristan tribes’ All alike desired an extension of the same regime to Luristan in order that they might, like the Sagwand, become prosperous and eat wheat bread instead of corns and live by serving Government instead of opposing it. Ihcn old Habits of blackmail and robbery might not have long remained proof against temptation, had action been taken at once in Luristan. But alter a lapse of 10 years, during which nearly every tribe between Dizful and \ laramabad has formally and spontaneously expressed its desire to enter into political relations with us, and in many cases has submitted inter tribal and other disputes for settlement, tribes which have not been visited by Europeans since 1846 have welcomed visits by British Officers. hiring the.last few months, a number of men from various tribes united to start carrying goods on account of merchants to Kharamabad.

Nevertheless, for the next 10 years a direct trade route between Dizful and Hamadan so Ionc desued, is likely to be of the greatest value to British trade in Persia, and if it can be encompassed without our direct intervention, by some such arrange ment as that outlined above, the trouble and expenditure involved by direct piactical relations between the Political Officer at Dizful and the Lur tribes amii not Have been wasted. From this point of view it is important that if and when a Governor of unstaii is appointed he should be selected with the concurrence of Ills i ajes i s . mister, and tnat he should undertake to pay due regard to the existing mercantile traffic from Dizful.

I have the honour to submit herewith as directed H, a report on the present situation in Northern Arabistan. I have prefaced it with a brief resume 7 of the circumstan- . ces which necessitated the various steps taken during the last two years to restore ana maintain order there*. I have added an appendix on the situation in Luristan and the Luristan road. 2. On the outbreak of war with Turkey a political officer was stationed at Dizful, in connection primarily with Railway Surveys, and there was a British Consular Agent, a Persian of good family, at Shushtar. We had had little or no practical relations with the notables of Shushtar, a town notorious for its faction fights and fanaticism: but thanks to the presence since 1911 at Dizful for the greater part of the year of a British Officer the attitude of the notables and peoole of that town towards the British had for some time been friendly and nelpful, and progress had been made in the same direction with the tribes of Luristan. ine Political Onicer at Dizful was withdrawn shortly after the outbreak of war, and posted to Kurnah: this step was taken not as a consequence of the hostile attitude of the inhabitants but because no other officer wa£ available and oecause railway developments in Luristan were not likely to materialize during the war. Our Consular Agent at Shushtar resigned soon afterwards partly for \ ; private reasons and partly no doubt owing to the fact thatT'** whenwhen the Jihad agitation cormiended in Arab is tan, it became clear that we were not in a position to give him effective personal protection. 3. The invasion of Arabistan by the Turks in January 1915 synchronized with the vigorous preaching of the Jihad by itinerant criests from Najaf and Kerbela in Turkish pay or under the influence of Turkish threats. The campaign had some success in Shushtar, and had an unfavourable effect on the attitude of Persian employes on the Oil fields, where many Shushtaris are employed. A single fanatical outbreak on the Fields, at this time,might have forced the Company to close down altogether, as some of the subordi- nate European Staff were already very nervous, Ahwaz having been evacuated by the European community on February and the pipe line out, leaving the fields f, en Pair”. Fortu nately no such outbreak occurred. The campaign had less effect at Dizful, where the principal priests counselled moderation, or held aldof; but it would have been difficult for a European to have remained in Dizful at this time. 4. In march 1915, Wassmuss and his party of Germans with Indian and Persian Seditionists passed from 'Turkey through Pusht-i-Kuh and went to Shiraz stopping for a time at Shushtar, where he was warmly welcomed: there is little doubt that he could have caused a complete stoppage of work at the fields, by inciting attacks against Europeans, or on the pumping station, but, as is known from captured docu ments, such action would have prematurely disclosed the German plan of campaign in Persia, and probably for this reason he passed on to Behbehan and Shiraz without doing any damage. 5. In May 1915, Amara was occupied, and in September of the same year Kut al Amarah: the situation in ArabistanArab is tan becaijig, relatively normal end tne pips line ..as repaired, Dizful and Shushtar however were rent by a . i ' - renewal of faction fights and tribal raids the immediate result of which jwas a general decrease of the area under cultivation and much damage to trade. 6. In September 1915, it was decided to make large military requirements, and purchasing officers were sent to Shushtar and Dizful, whe»'they worked under arrange ments made by H.LI's Vice Consul at Ahwazi tne country was at this time in such a disturbed state that no caravans travelled unless strongly guarded. The Sagwands were raiding G-hazban and other tribes in Arabistan and Mesopotamia and vice versa: trade was at a standstill and the Persian Customs and Revenue Departments could not collect enough to pay the salaries of their local repre sentatives, much less finance the local Government. The purchase of mules was carried out under circumstances of considerable difficulty and at a heavy 7. In February 1916, a large party of Persian &lt; Gendarmes, who had joined the Germans and lately the Turks in Persia and had been defeated by the Russians, then advancing on Kamanshah and Khanikin, endeavoured to return to their homes in the Bakhtiyari country and Ispahan through Pusht-i-Kuh. They were intercepted near Dizful by a strong detachment of our cavalry: the majority were killed or captured, and the remainder dispersed. Their leaders, two young Bakhtiyari Khans, were captured but were released soon afterwards on representations by the Ilkhani. They subsequently joined the German Kardorff and took a prominent part against the Russians and ourselves in Ispahan. afterwards. The incident had an excellent effect on our ex-oenditure in blackmail. A second party was similarly dealt,with shortly(0 our prestige in the district, and had a widespread effect 8. This phase of the situation was succeeded by less favourable developments. Kut was captured by the Turks and during the following months the Russians were forced to evacuate successively Ksxmanshah and Ramadan. The situation in Persia gave rise to considerable anxiety and the attitude Ox the Bakhtiyari Khans became equivocal. In view of our past experience and having regard to the greatly increased importance, both to the Mesopotamia Expeditionary Force, and to the Admiralty, of the Oil Fields it was realised tna.t we could not afford to risk a return to uhe staous quo in northern Arabistan. It seemed equally clear that for the same reasons the enemy would not again * neglect tne chance Ox ruining the Fields and of threatening our ilanx, and military and political measures were concerted accordingly. 1 ! J. A Political Otficer (Mr.S.B.Soane) was sent to Dizful with instructions to get in touch with the tribes, to prevent enemy agents from having access to the district, to encourage so far as practicable co-operation by the Luristan trioes with the Russians^ and to take such steps as were necessary to prevent the local situation from getting out of hand in the event of the situation in Central i-’ersia turning to our disadvantages, as seemed at one time very probable. The military authorities were known to be averse to sending troops to Dizful or Shushtar, but they were none the less anxious that no stene should be left unturned to ensure tnat, in the event of further Turkish successes in Central Persia, N.Arabistan should not again become a hot-bed ox intrigue in which G-erman propaganda would flourish, with a consequent menace to the fields: the detachment at Shush was strengthened and the garrison at •— t in Luristan and Pusht-i-Kuh. Ahwaz increased. 11.(M) 11. By the early auturon matters had apparently reached a critical stage in Central Persia, and it seemed lively that the Turks would make a further considerable advance. The whole situation in Arabistan came unaer review on the occasion of the visit of the Commander in Chief in India to Basrah, and after being referred home it was decided to take steps to provide a military guard for the pumping station, nea.r the oil fief ST and to be prepared to take further steps for the protection of the Fields in the event of necessity arising. Orders were given for the completion of various bridges at strategical points and for the accumulation of stores etc. 12. At about this time, the Persian G-overnment,after several abortive attempts to send a representative to Arabistan, nominated one Ainul Mulk as Governor, to reside at Shushtar. The appointment is financially one of the most unattractive in Persia, and soon after his appointment he came to Basrah to ask for assistance in obtaining funds from the Belgian Director of Customs at Mohammerah in the latter's capacity as Financial Controller. After much trouble a certain sum per month was obtained for him, to be spent in accordance with the 'Budget' authorised in Tehran. The 'Budget' however was so modest and the prospect of obtaining additional income from other sources so \ remote, having regard to the long standing disrepute into which the office of Governor had fallen, that it was found necessary later on to increase it by a personal allowance (from British sources), It soon became clear however that without much more supervision than could be exercised from a distance, the Governor would not 'make good' from any point of view. The notables of the town openly flouted him, it 5 was clear that his resignation would be deferred onlyira until such time as he had accumulated a few months pay and extorted what he could from the weaker of his clients. On ; 31© On the other hand, he was well meaning and friendly and nothing was likely to be gained by a change. 13. A Political Officer, Mr. O.J. Edmonds, Levant Consular Service, was therefore sent to Shushtar to act as the Governor’s adviser when indicated and in particular to see that he expended the sum allotted to him in accord ance with the official 'Budget” approved in Tehran. This appointment had the desired effect: before long the Customs, Revenue, Judicial and Opium Departments recommeri under their old heads, with greatly increased receipts much to the gratification of the Belgian Director at Mo hammer ah. 14. Ain ul Mulk applied for and obtained three months leave in May and is likely to return in September. The climate of Shushtar is considered unhealthy and hot by Persians unaccustomed to it, and few Governors General have ever spent the summer there. He left one of his principal subordinates in charge and the administration 1ms since run fairly smoothly, inspite of a bad harvest. 15. There have been few robberies in the district. The roads are kept safe by several guard houses, some of which have been erected during the year. Landowners L emboldened by the unaccustomed tranquility of the past 12 months, have spent considerable sums on cleaning out old canals and have intimated their willingness to spend much more, if only we can give them some guarantee that there will be no reversion to the status quo ante 1916 whereby they would stand to lose the benefit of any expenditure for the common good, owing to the chronic feuds in which they are involved, and owing to the rapacity of certain of their Northern neighbours. The trade of the town has greatly increased, and pices have fallen: taxes, previously farmed to local notables, bring in greatly enhanced, sums to the Persian Government.0 Government e.g., the ferry tax, which was formerly farmed for 200 tumans a year to a notorious ruffian (no one else dared to take it) now brings in 200 tumans a month on the same scale of charges. 16. These results have been achieved through the intermediary of the Governor General or of the Heads of Departments concerned. The Political Officer (since March 1917, Captain F.S. Greenhouse, I.A.) abstains from direct intervention, as far as possible, referring cases to the Eampsiii competent department for disposal, whilst maintaining close touch with events, and seeing that departmental decrees, once given, are enforced. He has an escort of 22 Persian mounted sowars, who assist in maintaining order in the district, or by making sorties, when necessary, in pursuit of raiders, but do not garrison posts^ etc. This number could not be reduced without risk. They wear Persian dress and supply their own horses and uniform. The cost of the present establishment of the Political Officer at Shushtar works out at about £200 p.m. inclusive of his own salary and the Governor’s extra allowances. 17. The position at Dizful, which I will now endeavour to describe, differ® from that at Shushtar principally in the following respects (i) When our representative went to Dizful there was not a Deputy Governor in the town nor had there been one for many years. The restoration of order had to be framed with due regard to this fact. The Customs, Revenue, Opium and other Departments existed in a moribund condition. They are now in active working order and their receipts have considerably increased. (ii) Shushtar is not a centre in which tribes have to be considered, except the Bakhtiyari to whom a special officer is accredited.. Dizful on the other hand is the market town and political focus of all Luristan, and our policy at Dizful must be guided with due regard to this It fact./ © (iii) Dizful is a frontier town and district marching th Mesopotamia for many miles, ana our representative iere has to deal v/ith Arab tribes from across that border, •abistan proper. © 18. The Political Officer has been obliged in conse- quence to take a more direct part in the administration and this circumstance has been accentuated by the fact that local conditions have hitherto made it impossible to start a Judicial Department with local talent, and by the fact that questions of importance outside the town, indicated above, take up much of his time end determine his attitude towards internal matters. 19. Ain ul Mulk soon after his appointment to Shushtar proposed to send his Assistant Asad ud Dauleh to Dizful as Deputy Governor. This individual was however notoriously so unfitted for the post by his habits and temperament that Ain ul Mulk was asked to defer his despatch and willingly agreed to do so. 20. A Persian Deputy Governor is however still a desideratum, and if Ain ul Mulk, who is now on leave at Tehran, could be asked to bring with him a suitable candi date, who would work in harmony v/ith our officer there, the position of the Persian Government v/ould be further strength ened without serious or permanent detriment to the present administration. I met a number of merchants and local notables at Dizful and saw the various branches of the administration, which one and all appear to ce a source of satisfaction and even of pride to the community at large, excepting only such local notables as nave had their lormer power for evil restricted. The powerful priesthood at ajs well as with Lurs and Bakhtiyari and with Arabs of Dizfu -1 i+r' 'N23 . Dizful, as at Shushtar, are supporters of the present regime, and the common people share their views. / 21. This fact need not however deter us from endea vouring to re-establish the traditional hx xe hierarchy by securing the appointment of a Persian Deputy Governor. The possibility of appointing a Judicial (Adliyeh; Depart ment is more doubtful. No such institution has ever been known in Dizful, and many difficulties are likely to arise when the attempt is made. But it is of first importance that this institution should be established if possible. Once it is done, it will be easier to start other branches of the local administration. 22. That the Dizfulis are not without public spirit or enterprise is demonstrated by the readiness with which they subscribed some £ 4000 ^towards the re- building of the Bridge, which had broKen down so complete ly that local talent wa^ quite unable to encompass its renair. The bridge crosses the Diz River, which is practical* ily always unfordable, and gives the town access to the rich lands across the river, the nomad tribes and to Burujird and Ramadan beyond. Thanks to the hearty co-operation of the military authorities at Ahwaz and Basrah, to the services of engineers lent by theA.P.O.CJ and to the skill of local masons, the main gap in tne'TJridge was spanned by a rapidly improvised suspension bridge of 166 feet in length, the other arches were repared with brick and much work done, inspite of the lateness of the season, on the foundations. The tolls taken on traffic crossing the bridge have exceeded expectations, and place the soundness of the scheme as a paying concern beyond doubt. Structural weak nesses which have developed (the bridge was hastily erected wxi with such material as was then available in the Field Park at Basrah; are now being remedied by a R.R.Officer kindly lent by G.O.C. Ahwaz.23. Public security is maintained by a few watchmen within the town, whilst order is maintained in the oistrict on both sides of the Diz by a force of 45 mounted men drawn from the Sagwands, a Lur tribe, now semi-sedentary, living opposite to Dizful West of the Diz. This tribe has for many years terrorised the districts and pillaged Bakhtiyari end other property alike with absolute impunity. Organised on Persian lines this force is at present being trained by a British Officer lent by the military authorities, -^ts pay is at present met from British sources, but it is a legitimate charge on the Persian Government and should be charged thereto as soon as practicable. 24. It is unnecessary for the purposes of this report ;o into further details regarding the administrative and utive work being performed by the political officer or under his supervision. That it is being well done and with good results I have satisfied myself by personal inspection. That it is welcomed by the people and by the local represen tatives of the Persian Government, I equally have no doubt. 25. I think it is apparent from the foregoing that it would be most unwise during the neriod of the war to counte nance any steps which might lead to an alteration in the present position to our disadvantage, by a slackening of our control. We do not know what the future holds in store for us. More than once in the past three years, the fortune of war has temporarily gone against us and our allies in these regions, and en each occasion it has turned again in our favour. If our present position in Arabiatan is maintained we need not apprehend a rapid revulsion of local feeling, even if the situation in Persia or Iraq should again become temporarily unfavourable. 26. It is of special importance, from this point of view^not to encourage for the present the political aspira tions of the Bakhtiyari Khans in the Shushtarm ~ Dizful districts. Their considerable landed interests are ai)iply protected, and they have this yean farmed out their estates at higher rentals than for many years past. But their rapacious predilections and the incurably violent and high handed methods of their agents, make them universally feared, whilst the Anti-British or anti- foreign tendencies of some of them make it a matter of first importance from every point of view that they should be disaaded, or in the last resort prevented, under existing a circumstances^ from descending on the town, sjs of old, for three months in the winter, to levy taxes, fines etc. at will, departing in March for the high country again. After the war'it should be quite possible to come to a satisfactory agreement with them on the subject, but conditions are too unsettled for this to be practicable at present, and the allegiance of individual Khans too uncertain. 27. As to the future, assuming that Mesopotamia will be administered by us, it would appear that all considera,- tions, political, military and above all economic point to the maintenance in Arabistan of some such system as at present in vogue, under which commercial enterprise, both xnaj indigenous and foreign, ha.s some prospect of success, and agriculture is encouraged. The practical results, even though partly negative, of the large increase of cultivation at Dizful and Shushtar this year have not been unimportant; famine has been averted for this year, and if good rains fall next yey.ar, the crops should be larger than for many years past, resulting in a substantial diminution of tonnage for military needs. 28. It is abundantly clear from fes the trend of recent pronouncements at home that in matters economic K.M.G-. do not intend to pursue for the future a laissez-faire policy, and from the recently published report of the Mesopotamia . TradeTrade Commission, it is equally clear that Arabistan is the province par excellence in Persia in whicn i^iioisn economic interests, actual and prospective, a,re strongest and most susceptible of development. With unlimited acres of good soil, almost unlimited v/ater, and cheap fuel, it is a paradise for engineers and agriculturists. Even now the Oil Fields are producing, I am gicen to understand one and a half times as much oil as the whole of Burma, and with additional pumps the capacity of the oresent pipe lines can be quadrupled. 29. The total present cost of the Dizful Agency including this guard (an expensive item) and the salaries of the officers concerned is aoout £ 2UQ0 a month, a sum which may be considered large if regarded as purelj diplomatic or consular expenditure. Regarded however as politico-military expenditure and ared with the very large sum expended^with almost isely similar objects, in Pars, the expenditure is nsiderable, and thoroughly justified by tangible results, which have in them every element of permanence. 30. The presence of a small military iorce in Arabistan is however essential for some years to come to the stability of the new administration, and it is of great importance that when military dispositions in this area are reconsidered, the necessity, in the interests oi the Oil fields, and of the maintenance by the Persian Government ox order in Shushtar ana Bizful, of retaining a iorce on the Karun should be borne in mind. Its precise locarion need not be considered at present. 31. In conclusion I would bring to notice tne fact that during the last 18 months we have received overt support and assistance from many quarters m present merchants. —»I present tranquility of affairs is tempered by a lively apprehension of the retribution that would be wreaked on them were any change of policy to make possible the return of their amacts quondam oppressors, some of whom have not hesitated at murder, rape or robbery in the past.

The appearsjnce of an organised administration at Dizful, the market town of the greater part of Luristan, the pacifica tion of the Sagwand and their successful conversion from the pursuit of robbery to that of agriculture, to their own great profit ; awoke varying ambitions amongst Luristan tribes. in alike des-e^ifi^ an extension of the same regime to Luristan in order that they might, like the Sagwand, become prosperous and eat wheat-bread instead of corns end live by serving Government instead of opposing it. Their old habits of blackmail and robbery might not have long remained proof against temptation, had action been taken at once in Luristan. But! after a lapse of ten years, during which nearly every tribe betv/een Dizful and Kharamabad has formally and sponta neously expressed its desire to enter into political relations with us, and in many cases has submitted inter tribal and other disputes for settlement. Tribes which have not been visited by -Europeans since 1846 have welcomed visits by British Officers. During the last few months, a number of men from various tribes united to start carrying goods on account of merchants to Kharamabad. They were joined by a number of muleteers to whom the Ahwaz-Ispahan road, with its exhorbi- tant prices, lack of grazing and indifferent security offered no attraction. The example thus set was infectious during the month ending July 15th some 7000 animals left for Kharamabad, and there seems every likelihood that a similar number will leave during the next four weeks. The occupation of Mesopotamia has radically altered the probable lines on which the construction of roads and railways from the sea to Central Persia is likely to proceed, and in this connection Luristan is likely to play a less prominent part than seemed possible a year ago.ago. Nevertheless for the next ten years a direct trade route between Dizful and Ramadan, so long desired, U3&amp;) is 1 ikely to be of the great value to British trade in Persia, and if it can be encompassed without our direct intervention, by some such arrangement as that outlined above, the trouble and expenditure involved by direct practical relations between the Political Officer at Dizful ana the Lur tribes will not have been wasted. From this point of view it is important that if and when a Governor of Luristan is appointed, he should be selected with the concurrence of H.M's Minister, and that he should undertake to pay due regard to the existing mercantile traffic from Dizful. The appointment of a predatory Governor of the usual type will simply involve the Persian Government in further expenditure on punitive expeditions and will stop#' what traffic now exists, and, if the precedent of 20 years or so is any guide, will be totally ineffectual.■ - Ith V 453 [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Goveripfeplf ^^ ) and should be returned to the Foreign Office when done w^hT^tmlesB required for official use.] ^ ^ ^ ^ EX^;) any Deayp.ior. oir c. i.fr.rlin 3 , (TRheraa).

(7) A Persian Post Office would in no Cc*se meet re quirements because the Persian Post Office Uvnemits no foreign paroel post, valuable payable or money order business, which constitutes the bulk of the traffic of Indian Post Offices, nor could the Company or Government prudently consent to the residence on the oil fields of Persian Postal or Customs officials who would eventually become c*. focus of intrigue.

India, Fore Mo 0 « CLu*bd r L : ‘ C! i ^ i v/£££ 2. Since the year 1903 Union rates of postage have been applied in the case of correspondence posted at all the Indian Post Offices in the Persian Gulf, and in 1911 Sir Charles Stewart-Wilson decided, on a reference made by the Postmaster-General, .Bombay, that articles posted in the letter boxes on board the British India mail steamers while they are in Persian ports should be treated as if posted in the local Indian Post Office. The demand made by the Persian administration is that the postage on articles posted in letter boxes on board the mail steamers, while at anchor in a Persian port, should be prepaid hy means of Persian postage stamps. According to Article 11 of the Principal Convention of Borne •SubEncio.4 below. an extracfc * from whic h i s sub mitted, for information, articles posted on board a steamer at any port of call should be prepaid by means of the postage stamps and according to the tariff of the country in winch the port is situated, and under Union Regulations the claim appears therefore to be reasonable. 3. The posirion in the Persian Gulf is however one to which Union P-egulations cannot properly be applied. There is an Indian Post Office at each of the ports in question, and the mail steamer service is subsidised entirely by the Government of India. The letter boxes on board the mail steamers, 'which anchor a long way from shore, are a great convenience to the varims ships in the anchorages and also to the general public and business firms, for whom they provide the means of posting correspondence up to the last moment. If ihe concession of posting on board were withdrawn, all correspondence now posted on board the mail steamers would be sent to the Indian Post Office on shore, and in my opinion the Persian administration have no real grounds for complaint as they have for years acquiesced in the arrange ment, under which Indian Post Offices in Persia accept articles for despatch which bear Indian stamps in payment of postage. It is, therefore, quite reasonable that articles posted in letter boxes on board the mail steamers while at a Persian p:&gt;rt should be stamped in exactly the same way as if they had been posted in the local Indian host Office. 4. With respect to the question now raised bv the Persian Administra tion regarding the status of the Indian Post Offices in the Gulf, 1 beg lo request the orders of Government as to the reply to be given by me. So far as I am aware, there are no treaties or agreements concerning the establish ment of these Post Offices in the Persian Gulf : they have been established from time to time since 186i and the Persian Government are well aware tf their existence, while the conveyance of mails by sea between the Gulf ports has long been arranged and paid for exclusively by the Indian Government.

I have the honour further to forward herewith copy of a letter, quoted in the margin, with enclosures in which the Post No. 48418, dated 32nd July 1914. Master General, Bombay, asks whether there would be any objection, from a political point of view, to allowing the Persian Post Office at Charbar to make up direct closed Mails for the Bombay-Karachi Sea Post Office and the Karachi post office. &lt; ^ In view of the consistently hostile and inconsiderate attitude taken up and maintained by the Persian Postal Administration towards our British Post Offices in the Persian Gulf, and in view of the fact that, so far as 1 am aware, the Persian Administration does not pay any contribution to our mail subsidy, I have not felt justified in replying to the Post Master General, Bombay, otherwise than by informing him that the question has been referred to our Legation at Tehran and that a final reply will be sent to him on receipt of instructions. In my view, our uniformly courteous attitude in the past has been miscon strued by the Persian postal authorities, and I venture to urge that a more uncom promising attitude will probably be more calculated to advance our interests. It does not appear to me either from the Principal Convention of Rome or from the records that we are in any way bound to accept closed Persian Mail bags for despatch by our Mail steamers and it would appear well that the Director of Persian Post Offices should clearly understand that we do so as a favour.

If my supposition is correct there is no objection to a Mail being made up by the Per sian Post Office at Charbar for the local Indian Post Office and intructions have been issued to the Postmaster of the Indian Post Office at Charbar to accept and dispose of such a Mail if it is received from the Persian Post Office at Charbar.

Townley, K.C.M.G., His Majesty’s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of Persia Tehran. 1 I have the honour to forward certain comments on the Persian propositions detailed in Your Excellency’s despatch No. »i 3 , dated 15 th April 1914 to His Majesty s Principal Secretary of State for Foreia n Affairs, and with regard to the question of the establishment of a British Post Office at Ahwaz. . Chef de Cabinet of the Foreign Ministei commences his attack with a series of sweeping charges of a general character against the Indian Government presumably the Indian Postal Administration. So far as can be judged from the rather voluminous records on the subject in this Consulate-General, and it would appear that copies of all correspondence between the two Postal Administrations is always furnished to this office, the objections of the Persian Government have invariably met with courteous and prompt attention; any real abuses and incon sistencies with the Postal Convention have been promptly removed and it is only where plausible expression of the desire for compliance with the strict letter of the law of the Postal Convention has thinly veiled a concerted design to para lyse or abolish the only efficient postal institutions in these regions that the Indian Postal authorities have declined to be drawn into useless and dangerous correspondence and have referred their critics to the diplomatic channel. &amp; I do not propose to content myself with this general denial of the allegations of the Chef de Cabinet, but have taken from the records specific instances in which the complaints of the Persian authorities have received full attention and their reasonable grievances immediate redress. They will be found detailed in Appen dix I to this desaatch. The Chef de Cabinet states that Persia has been denied the most elemen- tary rights in her own territories. The latest indictment of Persian postal arrangements—I refer to despatch No. 10 , dated lath May 19 . 4 , from His Majesty’s Consul, Kerman, on the postal mce between Bandar Abbas and Kerman—would certainly justify the retort mat Persia, in this particular connection, is either unable or unwilling to fulfill the most elementary duties in her own territories. ■&lt; '„T a /rt PS be P , e T, t . ted a,S ° \° refer t0 Your Excellency’s remarks as to ln ^ ' d ' fficu ‘ ie3 °n the Shiraz road ’in despatch No. a 18 , dated aoth October I 9 '-' t0 H ,' s Majesty s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and A ' ln despatch No. 34 dated 30 th January 1914 , to the same address as to unsatisfactory nature of the existing postal arrangements in Arabistan ”. 1 J. ha y e .been unable to trace in my records the explicit understanding given by H,S Majesty’s Charge d'Affaires, Tehran, in September , 908 , and in lhe sence of that document (?) it is only possible to guess at the contents. But as contended by the Chef de Cabinet what is required by the Persian Postal C80FD2 Administration is a strict compliance with Detailed Regulation No. i of the cipal Convention of Rome of May 1906 , obviously not as erroneously quoted by him Arictle 1 of the Principal Convention aforesaid, he has simply misread the articles and failed to comprehend their purport. Detailed Regulation No. 1 merely imposes on the accepting Administration the obligation to forward by the quickest route closed mails and correspondence in open transit. The question of acceptance of closed mails is governed by Detailed Regula tion No. 2 and would appear to be a matter of bargaining and mutual consent on the part of the two Administrations concerned. I speak with the dirhdence o a layman in these matters, but it would seem that, if the object of the request is not postal facilities but a patent desire to impair the usefulness and efficiency ot another administration, a Hat refusal by the latter would be justifiable. Closed mails would appear to be obligatory only on the application of an intermediate administration. Thus, as between Persia and Turkey vrd the Persian Gulf, the Indian Administration would be entitled to insist and so presumably would the Persian and Turkish Administrations, if agreed, after due notice given to India according to Detailed Regulation II ( 2 ). Nothing seems to entitle one adminis tration, as in this case, demanding as a right that its closed mail bags for all foreign countries should be accepted without quest.on by another administration. The question of the Persian Post Office at Abbadan has been fully discussed in the correspondence on the subject ending with Residency letter No. 1113 , dated 6 th April 1913 , to the Government of India. a Post Office to be the use of the general Company’s premises by the Belgian official no doubt that it is And it is the Chef de consideration on the It has been shown that it is out of the question for located on Anglo-Pers'tan Oil Company’s premises for public. he location of a Post Office adjacent to the Oil has been unfavourably reported on as a paying proposition most qualified to judge of the proposal and there can be urged by the Chef de Cabinet simply to annoy the British. Cabinet who complains of consistent hostility and want of part of the Indian Government ! The 4 th proposition is so vague that I find it impossible to reply to. I am entirely ignorant as to what foundation there is supposed to be for the charge implied. Nothing in the records of this Residency would appear to justify it. On the other hand, I find in my records the three following extracts which 1 reproduce verbatim :— /. Extract from M emorandum by Mr, H. M. Kisch, late Postmaster-General, Bengal, dated 24 th October 1907 . “ Secondly, up to a few years ago—I think up to the time I left India in igo ^—the Persian Government was in debt to India to a considerable extent for postal services ard in spite of frequent applications it had not been found practi cable to obtain payment of the balances due. Therefore, there might well be a not unreasonable reluctance to make a change of procedure, which in the ordi nary course w r ould lead to a diminution of cash receipts and an increase of the liabilities of Persia, under the Conventions, for transit payments.” 2 Extract from letter No. 4 ^ 1 , dated gth February 19 / 3 , from Sir Percy Cox, to the Secretary to the Governme?it of India in the Foreign Department. * * t * • * * “ In conclusion, I venture to remind Government that the Persian Postal Administration, whilst making use of our fast and subsidiary mail service to carry its own sealed mails between Persian ports in addition to letters posted anywhere in Persia for places abroad, does not so far as I know pay a penny for the privn e g e of doing so, and in the not very probable event of their questioning our title to initiate our own postal arrangements at Hanjam and Charbar, l would suggest3 that this consideration might be brought home to them, if not by a request to contribute to the mail subsidy, then by an allusion to their good fortune in being immune from such a contribution/’ »••**** j. Extract from a memorandum on the British Indian Post Offices m the Persian Gulf and Turkish Arabia by Mr. F. B. O’ Shea, Personal Assis tant to the Postmaster-General of Bombay. Revised Edition by Mr, F. Whymper, Postmaster-General, Bombay&gt; dated June 1905, page 29, para graph 18. *•••••* “ The Persian Post Offices were allowed to exchange with each other closed letter mail bags through the Indian Post Offices by means of the British India Steam Navigation Company’s mail steamers. No payment on account ot sea transit was claimed for the conveyance of these closed mails as the service was not considered to be of sufficient importance to call for special statistics on union principles.” And these concessions are all the acts of a consistently hostile and inconsi derate administration ! It would seem high time to reconsider the situation and whether the Persian Postal Administration should not be informed that in view of the consistent y hostile and inconsiderate attitude taken up and maintained by them, the Uov- ernment of India finds itself unable to undertake the carnage of Persian mails between Persian Ports in the Gulf by their subsidised mail steamers except upon payment in advance for carriage on strict union principles. It is on the representations of this Administration that we are requested to abandon our intention to establish a Post Office at Ahwaz. its estabhshmen was first advocated by Sir Percy Cox in the following passage on his report No. 431, dated Bushire, 9th February 1913, to the Government of India. “ q Ah ■was. —Ahwaz is at present unprovided with a British Post Office, hough British steamers run regularly on the Karun between Ahwaz and Moham- nerah, and though there is a growing European colony there. The principal firms have learnt by bitter experience that correspondence of urgency or mp t Mice cannot safely be entrusted to the Persian Post Office and generaUy have recourse to special private messengers to carry their mails to and from Moham merah; a similar course was adopted by His Majesty s Vice-Consul Ahwaz, when the post was first created, for similar reasons and has been continued since. “ It would be convenient both with a view to facilitating our commerce and in order to emphasize the position of Ahwaz, as one of the Ports of the Persian Gulf, to initiate a British Post Office there ; there is think, htt e doub , t P‘ i h would be self-supporting and that it would be greatly appreciated by the British and Foreign communities as well as by Persian mercantile classes,^ who depend largely on the British Post Offices to make remittances to Bombay . It was probably because Sir Percy Cox had, in the passage produced above so clearly established a case for the creation of a mis ° S a |j v an .i ground of “ postal facilities ” and the advantages to commerce generally and British trade in particular that he confined himself mainly, though by no means entirely, in his later despatch No. 3585 ° f the 2tth November 19.3 to the Polm cal advantages of the Scheme. There appears to be ht le prospect when every Southern Province in Persia is bankrupt and the Central Administration g ^calling on these same bankrupt administrations for funds to enable it to carryon that any money will be forthcoming to improve Persian postal arrangements in Arabistan. The Persian Government and particularly the foreign element in it were, it was fully realised, from the first, sure to object but it is doubtful whether a single Persian inhabitant of Arabistan will have the smallest objection to the opening of a British Post Office at Ahwaz. All persons of influence in the neighbourhood will welcome it and I would venture to express the hope that an indispensable reform may not be sacrificed to save the “ amour propre ” of a Belgian Director of Posts. A copy of this despatch is being forwarded to the Government of India, and to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, for informa tion.5 APPENDIX I.

British Post Offices in the Persian Gulf are instructed to receive and despatch Persian postal matter in accord ance with rules of Postal Union and British Postmaster receives instructions to receive and despatch letters posted in local Persian Post Office and franked with Persian postal stamps.

I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of No. io, dated iath May 1914. to His Majesty's India a copy of the letter nnargmally Minister, Tehran. noted, which I have received from His Majesty’s Consul, Kerman, on the subject of the Persian Postal service in Kerman. Enclosure. No. 10, dated Kerman, the I2th May 1914. F rom —His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, j 0 —.His Britannic Majesty’s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary etc., etc., Tehran. 1 have the honour to submit for your consideration some remarks on the unsatisfactoriness of the Persian Postal service in Kerman, in the hope that it may be found possible to induce the Post Master General to give his attention to the subject of introducing certain improvements and reforms. The task of effect ing substantial improvment should not, 1 think, lie outside the competence even of a Persian Government Departm nt, and the present time, when there is ground for hoping that the Gendarmerie will within a calculable period render the post secure from external forces, appears a suitable one for calling for an overhauling of the resources and practice of the Kerman postal service. 2. 1 shall proceed here to indicate where the principal defects of the present service lie. There are two main postal routes connecting Kerman with Europe and with other parts of Persia :— 1. That via Bandar Abbas. 2. That via Yezd and Tehran. The Bandar Abbas Route. This is the more important route as it alone provides connection with India with which there is a considerable commercial correspondence, including tha Th important Hindu community in Kerman. By far ^ greater bulk of imported goods come from, or rid India by way of Bandar Abbas. Ihe Hmdus and the Carpet Firms have also agents at Bandar Abbas and H&gt;s Bn tanmc Majesty Consul’s official correspondence with Bushire and India follows this t . The chief subject of complaint in regard to the service by this route is its slowness and uncertainty. n Incoming Bandar Abbas Mail. The recognised minimurn time taken by the nost in com'me from Bandar Abbas to Kerman is 16 days. The length of the sCestrouteVd Baft and liable to be difficult in wmter).se 7 o miles. Alter- native routes run up to 340 miles in length, but 1 y distance is very bad going for a post. It should certainly be done in not more than 10 days, and a week shou not be at all impossible. The slowness complained of is due 1 . to want of organisation, and to insufficient staff, and re ays o men an 2. to the'route followed via, Bandar Abbas, Daulatabad, Sirjan (Saidabad) Rafsinjan (Bahramabad), Kerman. C55FD mi 191 il nr I 4. With regard to (1) the following information was supplied to Majesty's Consul at Bandar Abbas. Men and animals allowed for carriage of post. His From To Men. Donkeys. Horses. Bandar Abbas ... Daulatabad ... 4 2 • •• Daulatabad ... Sirjan ••• • • • ••• 3 (2?) ••• Sirjan ... ... ... Rafsinjan ... 1 ••• 1 Sirjan ••• ••• ••• Kerman ... ... 1 ... 1 As however the Kerman post comes round by Rafsinjan the last two items appear to duplicate each other. 5. The following information has been supplied by the Kerman Post Master to myself:— 8 men are employed between Bandar Abbas and Rafsinjan. 1 man and 1 horse are employed between Rafsinjan and Kerman. 10 days is the time fixed for transmission from Bandar Abbas to Kerman. The weight of the post is supposed not to exceed 8 ‘ mans ’ (about 54 lbs.), but in fact it averages from 18 to 20 * mans and on this account it is perfectly impossible to keep within the regulation 10 days. It appears clear that the postal establishment was fixed years ago before Kerman had become the important commercial centre it now is, and before it en joyed its present large European Community. The deficiency of means of carriage operates most seriously in the case of parcels, which appear frequently to be delayed in Bandar Abbas for weeks until it is possible to send them on. The delay is often, however, due to the Customs Office, vide below paragraph 8 V 6. As regards (2) it is absurd that Kerman should be treated as if it were a petty village and made subordinate to Rafsinjan, which is worked as a distribut ing centre. Kerman should have a direct service of its own by the shortest and directest route practicable. Other sources of delay. 7. These are:— 1. The presence or robbers or the existence of disturbances on the route. These difficulties may, it is hoped, be removed by the Gendarmerie in as short a time as it will take the Post Office to put its house in order. 2. Inclement wiwther, snow, flooded streams, etc. These are of course not wholly susceptible of cure, but a few cheap bridges and more and better animals, might produce some improvement. Delay by the Customs Authorities in Bandar Abbas. This is a very serious and a perfectly remediable obstruction. 8. The present practice is for the Bandar Abbas Post Office to send all parcels arriving from abroad to the Customs Office in Bandar Abbas. After this it appears that all responsibility on the part of the Post Office in regard to them is at an end. Agents of the consignees, and Bandar Abbas Agents, who are a highly unsatisfactory class, have to pass them through the Customs and then renost them bv the Persian Post, caving fresh postage on them. This entails very heavy additional expense, liven my own parcels, wmcn are not naoie iui(\36j 3 Customs, have to go through the mill entailing the usual delay and payment of fresh postage. Damage to material passing through the post. o. No efficient steps have been taken in the past to protect letters and parcels from the effects of the weather. If wet weather is encountered, or if a bridge over a stream breaks, the post is delivered at Kerman in a s °a d &lt;; n con ' dition. I have, with others, suffered much in this way, and have had many books ruined. I have frequently complained to the Post Master, who usually satisfies himself with denying patent facts, and when pressed further informs me that “ books are not susceptible of damage I have recently however been shown by him a telegram from M. Molitor sanctioning the purchase of water proof wrapping material. This appears to be a compliance with my reiterated recommendations, and is duly appreciated. I do not however unagine that the Post Master has the least idea what sort of material to get or where to procure it from. Outgoing Bandar Abbas mail. 10 Much that has been said above applies of course equally, mutatis mutandis, to the out-going mail. Apart from these points the chief source of complaint in this case lies in the fact that the out-going mail is so timed as hablt * ually to miss connection with the Indian-bound mail steamers at Bandar Abbas. According to His Majesty’s Consul the Kerman post reaches Bandar Abbas, when not delayed by abnormal circumstances, on Saturday or Sunday, while the India mail leaves in alternate weeks on Friday and Sunday. The Kerman post therefore never catches the Friday boats, and frequently misses the bunday ones. It will be noted that as the post leaves Kerman on Thursday even ing it apparently takes 16 to 17 days to reach Bandar Abbas. It is possible however that it takes 9 or 10 days ; I cannot say for certain. If the latter is the case it only further shows how inefficiently the up-coming post is dealt with. n. This missing of the mail boat at Bandar Abbas results in the extremely frequent despatch of two outward mails by the same boat, and the delivery of two weeks’ mails together in Europe. I have known cases in which 3 weeks mails were delivered together. This, it can be easily understood, is otten excessively annoying both for business men and private individuals. The Tehran mail route. 12. The chief defects in the Northern Service are 1. Slowness. 2. Insecurity. As regards (1) the post from Tehran never, I think, reaches Kerman m less than 3 weeks, and at least a month is the normal time. - This can only be due to the failure to employ wheeled transport, and then to an insufficiency 0 pack or riding animals. In F. G. Browne’s “ Persian Revolution page 417, 1 is stated that in the time of the Amin-ul-Mulk, about 1873-4 apparently, a let ter would go from Tehran to Kerman or vice versa in seven or eight days . From enquiries I have made it appears that this particular statement of the author’s is correct. This was of course only possible when pohtica experiments had not removed the “ Chappar ” System along with other traces of administra tive efficiency from the country. 11 As regards (2), the post is very frequently held up or actually robbed between Yezd and Isfahan. The Pars robbers’favourite striking point appears to be Nau Gumbaz. This place lies outside the Kerman province, which makes it impossible even to attempt to remedy matters from here.General security of articles in the charge of the Persian Post, 14. The security of the post is rendered worse than indifferent by thieves existing without and thieves existing within the Department. The former are highway robbers whose elimination cannot fairly be expected from the Postal Authorities. The tract between Yezd and Isfahan has just been mentioned as the principal danger-area on the Northern route. On the Southern route, according to circumstances, the whole course from Sirjan to Bandar Abbas is unsafe. Actual robberies however have not been very frequent during the year and a half that I have been here. In Autumn one robbery took place in Sirjan and another at Daulatabad in Spring and the post has been opened and tampered with at these places on more than one occasion. The Gendarmerie, as already stated, should be able to put an end to insecurity on the Southern route. But whether Gendarmerie activities or Postal reformations will be first on the field is a subject for speculation. 15. The existence of thieves within the Department is certain, but it is not easy to detect the culprits and run them to earth. The post is opened both in the Bandar Abbas and Kerman Post Offices, and also I believe in that of Rafsinjan, There are also the Bandar Abbas Customs officials to be reckoned with. If however the criminals are obscure, their operations are apparent. Unregistered parcels seldom succeed in successfully running the gauntlet, and the contents even of registered parcels suffer from the attention of pilferers. I have myself lost the contents of many parcels in part or in whole. Redress is practically out of the question. It is usually months before the loss is establish ed as certain, and then it is quite hopeless to endeavour to locate the respon sibility. 16. Reference has already been made, vide paragraph g, to another source of injury to material passing through the post, viz. the failure to protect it from the weather and the elements. The Staff and Management of the Post Office in Kerman. 17. Numerous complaints have been received regarding the inefficiency of the staff and irregularity in the management of the local post office. The SVajf appears to consist of 1 Post Master, I Mirza, and 1 Postman with one private donkey. I do not wish to bring any very severe charges against the Post Master, who appears to me to be no worse than the average of his class. His replies to enquiries and expostulations have on the whole been courteous, if fatuous. In December and January I had reason to complain repeatedly of the Post Office being found closed during office hours on days that were not holidays. This appears to have been due to slackness on the part of the Mirza and want of supervision on the part of the Post Master. I have not had to complain again for the last 3 or 4 months. 18. I have no proofs of attempts to cheat over the stamping of letters sent down to be posted, though I have heard grumbling on the subject ; and the Mirza does not appear to have succeeded in making himself trusted or popular with the European Community. Sorting of letters, etc, 19. The most serious complaint against the Post Office staff is their inability to sort letters and parcels addressed in the Roman character, j.£., practically the whole of the postal matters arriving for Europeans. It appears that no one in the office is able to read the Roman character, with the result that the post is hawked slowly rou-id the various Europeans in the station, who are at liberty to extract what they please and pass on the re mainder. The first sorting is, I believe, usually done in the office of the Oriental Carpet Manufacturers. The last point reached by the post, some hours after its issue from the Post Office, is His Majesty’s Consulate ; when it does arrive there5 it still invariably comprises articles addressed to other people. In a community largely consisting of trade rivals this system of sorting is liable to lead to abuses, or at least to suspicion and complaints. That no official complaints have as yet been made to me regarding the treatment of the post by individuals says much ^ f or the amiability and honesty of the community. Nevertheless the system is a subject of universal distrust and reprobation ; and it should certainly be put a stop to by the appointment of a properly qualified sorter by the Postal Authorities. 20. The position is made still worse by the apparent inability of the Post man to read any script whatever, or to identify the numbers on parcels and registered articles with those in his registers. The individual in question appears to me to be habitually steeped in opium or drink, but it may only be that he is intellectually peculiarly dull. Delay in delivery of the post. 21. The postman has recently appealed to me to move the Director of Posts to give him an allowance for feeding his own donkey on which he goes his rounds. What his pay may be I do not know, but in view of the fact that the European quarter is the best part of two miles, and the Consulate the best part of 3 miles, from the present Post Office, he should certainly be given sufficient means for making delivery rapidly. On occasion, when there is a heavy post, I understand he has to hire an extra donkey at his own charges. At any rate 1 have had to decline his request to pay the hire of an extra animal. 22. The delivery of the post is also retarded by other causes beside delay in sorting and insufficient means of carriage. I have heard cases mentioned in which the post was known to have arrived by midday on one day and was not delivered till the following afternoon. Such delay is very much to be deprecated, for no one is likely to deny that every half hour of detention- in the Post Office seriously jeopardises the safety of the contents of the post, by allowing lightfingered persons time to exercise their talents and ingenuity. How often an unnecessarily lengthy period elapses between the arrival of the post and its issue from the office it is impossible to say for reasons which bring me to my last subject of complaint. The Remoteness of the Present Post Office Quarters. 23. The Post Office is situated in the “ Ark ”, a mile or more from the business centre of the town, and a couple of miles from the European residential quarter. It follows that it is under the eye neither of the Persian nor the European public, who are consequently not in a position to become immediately aware of the arrival of the post, or to exert any pressure on the postal officials to deal with it expeditiously. This is a very serious defect which should be remedied by bringing the Post Office up into the centre of the town, where, I believe, it used formerly to be. I have already recommended that the present Post Office should be made over to the Gendarmerie. If this is done, and I understand that it is under consideration, the transfer of the Post Office to the town should at the same time be insisted on. It may mean some slight extra expense on account of rent, but this can be added either to the Budget for the Postal Department, or to that of the Gendarmerie who are responsible for ousting the Post Office. Petty pecuniary considerations should not for a moment be allowed to interfere with the location of the Post Office in a suitable situation, for the benefit of the service and the public. Proposals for the reform of the Postal Service. Importance of European Community. 24. I will now summarise the measures, which in my opinion, ^ should be taken in order to secure a tolerably satisfactory and efficient service, but in the first place I would lay some stress on the importance of the European Community, which has of recent years grown up in Kerman,^ and on the right that it has to make itself heard and claim attention to its grievances from the Postal Department.25 . The Community for which this Consulate speaks numbers about 26 Europeans and Americans, excluding married women and children. These represent 10 institutions or business firms including the Telegraph Department, the Bank, and the principal export firms of Kerman. To these are A to be added 9 British Indian Subjects representing Indian houses of business in whose hands is the bulk of the Import trade. Besides these the Community comprises 5 Swedish officers of the Gendar merie, and the Russian Consul and Doctor. 26. According to rough calculations made from information I have collected, the amount of postage paid annually by the Community (excluding the British Indian traders and the Swedish and Russian officials and the official correspond ence of the Financial Department) approximates to :— Krans 7,000, of which something over half at present represents the postage paid on articles sent by Northern route. With an accelerated Southern post, the bulk of the post would probably go by that route. 27. These facts seem sufficiently to justify the claims of the European and Indian Community to demand attention to their complaints. The rapid growth of the Community in recent years, in number and importance, has probably escaped the notice of the Postal Authorities in Tehran. I may now put forward the following proposals :— 1. The speeding up of the mail service on both the Bandar Abbas and Teheran routes, by The provision of adequate means of rapid carriage. Mules to replace donkeys on the Southern routes ; and carriages or automobiles to be in course of time provided on the Northern route. 2. When carriage has been reorganised, arrangement of dates of arrival of post in Bandar Abbas, and departure from Bandar Abbas, to suit the sea mail service. 3. Institution of a direct service between Kerman and Bandar Abbas and vice versa, so arranged as to receive at least the protection, and perhaps the more active help, of the Gendarmerie. 4 . Protection of the Northern post between Yezd and Isfahan, particularly at Nau Gumbaz. 5. Establishment of a Customs house at Kerman to obviate delay, trouble and risk of loss at Bandar Abbas and Enzeli, and the expense of extra postage. 6 . Post always to be carried in suitable water-tight bags, which should be replaced at once whenever necessary. 7. Keeping in repairs of small bridges over mountain torrents. 8. A stricter supervision by travelling inspectors, or other means, of the staff of the Post Offices, to reduce pilfering and other irregularities. At present no visible steps are taken to supervise and control the provincial officials. 9. The sorting of the post in the Post Office, prior to issue, necessitating the appointment of an official fully qualified to read the Roman character and sort European letters, etc. 10. A new Post Master would probably be necessary to initiate and main tain reforms. n. The appointment of a postman, able to read at least Persian, and riot habitually in a state of mental fog. 12. The provision of adequate means of carriage for the delivery of the post, in Kerman. Also of water-proof bags to withstand rain, dust and dirt. 13. The prompt sorting and delivery of letters immediately on the arrival of the post, which will only be secured by :— 14. Locating the Post Office in the business centre of the town where it will be under the eye of the public to which might be added the hoisting of a flag in a conspicuous place when the post arrives.

The various British institutions, e.g. y the Indo-European Telegraph Depart ment, require payment in Indian coin. With a dual currency in vogue (Persian krans and Indian rupees'), the charge involved by the exchange operations of the Imperial Bank of Persia fall very heavily on those who have to deal in rupees, and there is a growing tendency among traders and others to remit money to India or England through the British Post Office. Recent wholesale rejection by the Imperial Bank of Persia in Bushire ot Persian krans tendered in payment, on the ground that a large part of the coin in circulation is light, sweated, or underweight, and the consequent reluctance ot local traders to accept payment in krans cash is also likely to increase the use | of rupees. Many would welcome the advent ^ to the Gulf of an Indian Bank } offering greater facilities in respect to business in Indian currency. The facilities offered by the British Post Offices in the Gulf, and especially in the Persian Ports are a most valuable asset to British interests and commerce. (Sd.) H. G CHICK, Commercial Adviser.

About the eon# tiste I also received a semi-offKlal protest made to me verbally by the ~hef de Cabinet of the loreign Uinlster in hie Excellency’s name.

Th® sight Honourable rir E-Grey,'art.,K.O.,k.FThe Chef de Cabinet also stated that the policy of the Indian Govern&amp;ent towards Persia in postal matters has been in general consistently hostile and inconsiderate : international agreements have been dieregarded,and Persia has been denied the most elemarfcary rights in her own territories, and unwarrantable objections have been made to the operations of foreign off i dale in the Per a - ian service. He asserted that Indian officers have r fused to accept Persian closed mails made up for Bussorah and Bagdad,and that the complaints of the Persian postal officials have invariably been met by a refusal to discuss the matter ,ref - eren ,e being made to the Diplomatic channel. He also argued that no account had been token of the explicit understanding given by His hajesty* s Charge d*Affaires in September 1908,under which it was agreed that Indian officers would in fut - ure accept all foreign correspond nee of Persia in compliance with the terms of the International Postal Union Agreement. The Chef de Cabinet finally put forward the following four propositione 8 which the UiniBter for Pore ifn Affairs hoped would be favourably considered by His kajesty* s Government 1.- The suppression of the Post Offices opened at chahb&amp;r and Henjam, 9.- The acceptance of Persian closed mails and other oorrespondenue by the British postal administration in compliance with Art:1of the Convention of ivO&amp;e (1006) and the letter of the Britifch Charge d*Affaires at Tehran to the Persian Coverrmait under date of the SiOth Sep - teeter 1906.

I have returned no answer that the creation of a Post Office at Ahwas would meet with determined opporition on the part of the Persian Government, It is Impossible for me to judge from here how really necessary such an Office is,and how far it is desirable that we should for polit wal reasons insiet upon opening one,to strengthen our position in the neutral zone,as wpaid would appear to have been one of the main objects of fir P.Cox in making the suggestion.

The extension of business in Money Orders done through the British Post Offices in the Persian Gulf in the course of the past few years deserves note. The total number of orders issued at the Bushire Head Office, and its sub-offices during the year ending March 1914 was 29.423 for a total value of £174.632, the commission accruing to the Post- Office being £1836; whereas in the year ending March 1913 the total value was £121.822, and commission £1.298. This represents an increase in one year of £52.810 value of orders issued, and of £538 commis sion. The relative proportions of this business at the various Post Offices during 1913 - 14 were as follows:- Persian Porte. alue Orders issued excluding commission Bushire 7.875 £46.600 Bandar 'Abbas 2.274 39.688 Muhammareh Lingeh 7.493 1.031 36.475 e - lL! £130.957 Masqat Bahrain Basrah 2.775 5.451 2.524 18.991 10.490 14.193All the above amounts represent suing paid into the Post Offices in Kupees (and smaller Indian coins). Postal business naturally covers only a small percen tage of the total currency in circulation; but these figures serve to illustrate the large amount of Indian money xn use xn the Central dxstricts of the Persian Culf. It is particularly noticeable that the largest remittances were from Persian Ports, in two of which there are branches of the Imperial bank of Persia. This is not only the result of the growth of the V.P. system. To an increasing extent along the Persian coast, as well as in the Arab ports, Pupees are the standard currency, and prices are quoted and payments are,* made in Pupees. The various British institutions, e.g. the Indo-European Telegraph Department, require payment in Indian coin. t With a dual currency in vogue (Persian Krans and \ Indian rupees), the charge involved by the exchange operations of the Imperial Bank of Persia fall very heavily on those who have to deal in Pupees, and there isis a growing tendency among traders and others to remit money to India or England through the British Post Office, decent wholesale rejection by the Imperial Bank of Persia in Bushlre of Persian Krans tendered in payment, on the ground that a large part of the coin in circulation is light, sweated, or underweight, and the consequent reluctance of local traders to accept payment in Krans cash is also likely to Increase the use of rupees.

Tontefois, remission eventuelle dans la feuille d’avis de la mention “Remb.” et du montant du remboursement n’altere pas la responsa- bilite de FAdministration du pays de destination pour le non encaissement du montant. ARTICLE 8. Responsabilite en matiere d'envois recommandes. 1. Eh cas de perte d’un envoi recom- mande et sauf le cas de force majoure, Pexpediteur ou, sur sa demande, le destinataire a droit a une indemnite de 50 francs. 2. Les pays disposes a se charger des risques pouvant deriver du cas de force majeure sont autorises a percevoir de ce chef sur I’expediteur une stirtaxe de 25 centimes au maximum pour chaque envoi recommande. 3. L’obligation de payer I’indemnite incombe a TAdministration dont releve le bureau expediteur. Est reserve a cette Administration le recours centre PAdmi nistration responsable, e’est-a-dire contre PAdministration sur le territoire ou dans le service de laquelle la perte a eu lieu. En cas de perte, dans des circonstances de force majeure, sur le territoire ou dans le service d’un pays se chargeant des ris- ques mentionnes au paragraphe precedent, d’un objet recommande provenant d’un autre pays, le pays oil la jierte a eu lieu en est responsable devant POffice expe diteur, si ce dernier se charge, de son cote, des risques en cas de force majeure ii Pegard de ses expediteurs. 4. Jusqu’a preuve du contraire, la res ponsabilite incombe a PAdministration qui, ayant reqm Pobjet sans faire d’observation, ne pent etablir ni la delivrance au desti nataire, ni, s’il y a lieu, la transmission reguliere a P Administration suivante.

L’Office responsable est tenu de rembourser sans retard, a POffice expe diteur, le montant de Piudemnite payee par celui-ci. the Detailed Regulations contemplated in Article 20 of the present Convention have not been fulfilled. Nevertheless the omission from the Letter Bill of the entry “ Remb.” and of the amount of the trade charge does not affect the responsibility of the Administration of the Country of destination for failing to collect the amount. ARTICLE 8. Responsibility for registered Articles. 1. In case of the loss of a registered article, and except in cases beyond control, the sender, or at the request of the sender, the addressee is entitled to an indemnity of 50 francs. 2. Countries prepared to undertake risks arising from causes beyond control are authorised to collect from the sender on this account a supplementary rate of not more that 25 centimes for each registered article. 3. The obligation of paying the in demnity rests with the Administration to which the despatching office is subordinate. To that Administration is reserved a remedy against the Administration responsible, that is to say, against the Administration on the territory or in the service of which the loss took place. In case of the loss, under circumstances beyond control, on the territory or in the service of a country undertaking the risks mentioned in the preceding paragraph, of a registered article sent from another country, the country where the loss occurred is responsible for it to the despatching Office, if the latter undertake risks in cases beyond control in dealing with its own public. 4. Until the contrary be proved, the responsibility rests with the Administration which, having received the article without making any observation, cannot establish the delivery to the addressee or the regular transfer to the following Administration, as the case may be. For articles addressed “ Poste Restante,” or held at the disposi tion of the addressees, the responsibility ceases on delivery to a person who has proved his identity according to the rules in force in the country of destination, and whose name and description correspond to those indicated in the address. 5. The payment of the indemnity by the despatching Office ought to take place as soon as possible, and at the latest within a year of the date of the applica tion. The responsible Office is bound to refund to the despatching Office, without delay, the amount of the indemnity paid by the latter.CONVENTION. 11 L’Office d’origine est autorise a des- interesser Texpediteur pour le compte de I’Office intermediaire ou destinataire qui, regulieremeut saisi, a laisse une annee s’ecouler sans donner suite a Faffaire.

Office must take upon itself, in addition to the indemnity, the subsidiary expenses resulting from the unwarranted delay in payment. 6 . It is understood that the application for an indemnity is only entertained if made within a year of the posting of the registered article ; after this term the applicant has no right to any indemnity. 7. If the loss has occurred in course of conveyance without its being possible to ascertain on the territory or in the service of what country the loss took place, the Administrations concerned bear the loss in equal shares. - 8.

Les soussignes, vu 1’article 20 de la Convention postale universelle, conclue &amp; Rome le 26 mai 1906 ont, au nom de leurs Administrations respectives, arrete d un commun accord les mesures sui- vantes, pour assurer I’execution de ladite Convention. 1. Direction des corrcspondances. 1. Chaque Administration est obligee d’exp^dier, par les voies les plus rapides dont elle peut disposer pour ses propres envois, les depeches closes et les corres- pondances a decouvert qui lui sont livrees par une autre Administration. Dans le cas oil une Administration, par des circonstances extraordinaires, se voit obligee de suspendre temporairement Texpedition des depeches closes et des correspondances a decouvert qui lui sont livrees par une autre Administration, elle est tenue d’en donner immediatement avis, au besoin par telegraphe, a CAdministra tion on aux Administrations interessees. A 48592. The undersigned, having regard to Article 20 of the Universal Postal Con vention concluded at Rome on the 26th of May, 1906, have, in the name of their respective Administrations, settled by common consent the following measures for ensuring the execution of the said Convention. 1. Route of the Correspondence. 1. Each Administration is bound to forward, by the most rapid routes at its disposal for its own mails, the closed mails ? , &lt;/' and the correspondence d decouvert which j are delivered to it by another Adminis- j tration. ■ In the event of an Administration finding itself obliged, by exceptional cir cumstances, to suspend temporarily the despatch of closed mails and correspon dence d decouvert which are delivered to it by another Administration, it is bound at once to notify the fact, if necessary by telegraph, to the Administration or Administrations concerned. C34 UNIVERSAL POSTAL UNION. 2. Les Administrations qui usent de la faculte de percevoir des taxes supple- mentaires, en representation des Irais extraordinaires aiierents a certaines voies, sont libres de ne pas diriger par ces voies, lorsqu’il existe d’autres moyens de com munication, celles des correspondances insuffisamment affranchies pour lesquelles I’emploi desdites voies n’a pas ete reclame expressement par les envoyeurs. 2. Administrations which avail them selves of the option to levy supplementary charges, as representing the extraordinary expenses pertaining to certain routes, are free not to forward by those routes, when other means of communication exist, any \y insufficiently paid correspondence for which the employment of the said routes has not been expressly prescribed by the senders. H. Echange en depeches closes. 1. L’echange des correspondances en depeches closes, entre les Administrations de rUnion, est regie d’un commun accord et selon les necessites du service entre les Administrations en cause. 2. S’il s’agit d’un echange a faire par I’entremise d’un on de plusieurs pays tiers, les Administrations de ces pays doivent en etre pre venues en temps opportun. 3. 11 est, d’ailleurs, obligatoire, dans ce dernier cas, de former des depeches closes toutes les fois qu’une des Adminis trations intermediaires en fait la demande, se basant sur le fait que le nombre des correspondances a decouvert est de nature a entraver ses operations. 4. En cas de changement dans un service d’echange en depeches closes etabii entre deux Administrations par 1’entremise d’un on de plusieurs pays tiers, 1’Administration qui a provoque le changement en donne connaissance aux Administrations des pays par I’entremise desquels cet echange s’effectue. III. Services extraordinaires. Les services extraordinaires de I’llnion donnant lieu a des frais speciaux dont la fixation est reservee, par 1’article 4 de la Convention, a des arrangements entre les Administrations interessees, sont exclusive- ment:— 1° ceux qui sont entretenus pour le transport territorial accelere de la Malle dite des Indes ; 2° celui qui est etabii pour le trans port des depeches par chemin de fer entre Colon et Panama. II. Exchange in Closed Mails. 1. The exchange of correspondence in closed mails between the Administrations of the Union is regulated by common consent between the AdministTations con cerned, and according to the necessities of the service. 2. If an exchange of correspondence is to take place through the medium of one or more countries, timely notice must be given to the Administrations of those countries. 3. It is, moreover, obligatory, in this latter case, to make up closed mails when ever a request to that effect is made by one of the intermediate Administrations on the ground that the amount of corres pondence sent d decouvert is such as to hinder its work. 4. In case of alteration in a service of closed mails established between two Administrations through the medium of one or several other countries the Adminis tration which has originated the alteration gives notice thereof to the Administrations of the countries through the medium of which this exchange is effected. HI. Extraordinary Services. The extraordinary services of the Union- giving rise to special charges, the fixing of which, is reserved by Article 4 of the Convention for arrangement between the Administrations concerned, are exclu sively :— 1° Those which are maintained for the accelerated conveyance b}^ land of the Indian Mail; 2° That which is established for the conveyance of mails by railway between Colon and Panama. IV. IV. Fixation des taxes. 1. En execution de Particle 10 de la Convention, les Administrations des pays Fixing the Bates of Postage. 1.

Les fractions monetaires resultant, soit du complement de taxe applicable aux correspondances insuffisamment affran- chies, soit de la fixation des taxes des correspondances echangees avec les pays etrangers a 1’Union ou de la combinaison des taxes de 1’Union avec les surtaxes prevues par Particle 5 de la Convention, peuyent etre arrondies par les Adminis trations qui en effectuent la perception. Mais la somme a ajouter de ce chef ne peut, dans aucun cas, exceder la valeur d’un vingtieme de franc (cinq centimes). V. Exceptions en matiere de poids. II est admis, par mesure d’exception, que les Etats qui, a cause de leur regime interieur, ne peuvent adopter le type de poids decimal gnetrique, out la faculte d’y substituer Ponce avoir-dupois (28,3405 grammes) en assimilant une once a 20 grammes pour les lettres et deux onces a 50 grammes pour les autres objets, et d’elever, au besoin, la limite du port simple des journaux a quatre onces, mais sous la condition expresse que, dans ce dernier cas, le port des journaux ne soit A 48592. 2. In case of alteration in the monetary system of any one of the countries above- mentioned or of an important modification in the value of its money, the Administration of that country must come to an under standing with the Swiss Postal Adminis tration in order to modify the above equivalents ; it devolves upon this latter Administration to notify the change to all the other Offices of the Union through the medium of the International Bureau. 3. The monetary fractions resulting either from the complement of the charge applicable to insufficiently paid correspon dence, or from the fixing of the charges for correspondence exchanged with countries foreign to the Union, or from the com bination of the Union charges with the surcharges contemplated by Article 5 of the Convention, may be rounded by the Administrations which levy the paj'ments. But the sum to be added on this account must in no case exceed the value of one- twentieth of a franc (five centimes). V. Exceptions in the matter of weight. As an exceptional measure, it is agreed that States which, by reason of their internal regulations, are unable to adopt the decimal metrical system of weight, have the option of substituting for it the ounce avoirdupois (28*3465 grammes) assimilating one ounce to 20 grammes for letters, and two ounces to 50 grammes for other articles and of raising, if needful, the limit of the single rate of postage of news papers to four ounces, but 'under the express condition that, in the latter case,■' 3g UNIVERSAL pas inferieur a 10 contiraes et qviil soil pergu un port entier par numero de journal, alors memo que plusieurs journaux se trouveraient groupes dans un memo envoi.

IX. Application des timbres. 1. Les correspondances originaires des pays de I’Union sont frappees d’un timbre indiquant autant que possible en caracteres lathis le lieu d’origine et la date du depot a la poste. En outre, tous les timbres-poste vala- bles doivent etre obliteres. 2. A I’arrivee, le bureau de destination applique son timbre a date an verso des lettres et an recto des cartes postalep. Le bureau de la premiere destination pent, en outre, marquer une empreinte de son timbre a date au recto de la seconde partie des cartes postales avec reponse payee. 3. Les objets de correspondance mal diriges doivent etre frappes de I’empreinte du timbre a date du bureau auquel ils sont parvenus par erreur. Cette obligation in- combe non seulement aux bureaux seden- taires, mais aussi aux bureaux ambulants autant que possible. 4. Le timbrage des correspondances deposees sur les paquebots dans les boites mobiles on entre les mains des agents des postes embarques on des commandants incombe, dans les cas prevus par le para- graphe 5 de 1’article 11 de la Convention, a 1’agent des postes embarque ou, s’il n’y en a pas, au bureau de poste auquel ces correspondances sont livrees en main. Le cas echeant, celui-ci les frappe de son timbre a date ordinaire et y appose la mention “ Paquebot ” soit a la main, soit au moyen d’une grille ou d’un timbre. 5. Les correspondances originaires des pays etrangers a I’Union sont frappees, par POffice de 1’Union qui les a receuillies, d’un timbre indiquant le point et la date d’entree dans le service de cet Office. 6. Les correspondances non affranchies on insuffisamment affranchies sont, en outre, frappees du timbre T (taxe a payer), dont 1’application incombe a 1’Office du pays d’origine s’il s’agit de corres pondances originaires de 1’Union, et a POffice du pays d’entree s’il s’agit de correspondances originaires de pays etrangers a 1’Union. 5° Extent of pecuniary responsibility as regards registered articles ; 6° Whether advices of delivery are obtainable or not; and 7° As far as possible, the rates of postage from the country outside the Union to the countries of the Union. IX. Application of Stamps. 1. Correspondence despatched from countries of the Union is impressed with a stamp indicating as far as possible in Roman characters the place of origin and the date of posting. Moreover, all the valid postage stamps should be obliterated. 2. On arrival, the Office of destination impresses its date-stamp on the back of the letters and on the front of post cards. The first Office of destination can, more over, impress its date-stamp on the front of the second half of reply-paid post-cards. 3. Missent correspondence must be date-stamped by the Office to which it is sent in error. This obligation is imposed, not only on sedentary Offices, but also on travelling Post Offices as far as possible. 4. The stamping of correspondence deposited on board Packets in the movable boxes or in the hands of the postal agents on board or of the commanders devolves, in the cases contemplated by paragraph 5 of Article 11 of the Convention, upon the postal agent on board, or, if there be none, on the Post Office to which the correspon dence is handed over for disposal. In the latter case this Office marks the correspon dence with its ordinary date stamp, and with the word “ Paquebot,” either in manuscript or by means of an autograph stamp or an ordinary stamp. 5. Correspondence originating in coun tries foreign to the Union is marked, by the Office of the Union which first received it, with a stamp indicating the place and date of entry into the service of that Office. 6. Unpaid or insufficiently paid corres pondence is, in addition, impressed with the stamp T (tax to be paid), the appli cation of which devolves upon the Office of the country of origin in the case of correspondence originating in the Union, and upon the Office of the country of entry in the case of correspondence originating in countries foreign to the Union.DETAILED REGULATIONS. 41 7. Les envois a remettre par expres sont frappes d’un timbre portant en gros caracteres le mot “ Expres.” Les Administrations sont toutefois autorisees a remplacer ce timbre par une etiquette imprimee ou par une inscription manu- scrite et soulignee en crayon de couleur. Les envois qui ont ete munis de la mention “ Expres ” par le bureau d’origine sont remis a domicile par porteur special, meme en cas d’omission ou d’insuffisance de I’affrancbissement. Le cas echeant, le bureau d’echange du pays de destination est tenu de signaler 1’irregularite par bulletin de verification a 1’Administration centrale dont releve le bureau d’origine. Ce bulletin doit relater tres exactement I’origine et la date du depot de 1’envoi. 8 . Tout objet de correspondance ne portant pas le timbre T est considere comme affranchi et traite en consequence, sauf erreur evidente. 9. Les timbres-poste non obliteres ensuite d’erreur ou d’omission dans le service d’origine doivent 1'etre de la maniere usuelle par le bureau qui constate Firregularite. X. Indication du nombre de 'ports. Lorsqu’une lettre ou tout autre objet de correspondance non affranchi ou in- suffisamment affranchi est passible, en raison de son poids, de plus d’un port simple, 1’Office d’origine ou d’entree dans I’Union, suivant le cas, indique, a Tangle gauche superieur de la suscription, en chiffres ordinaires, le nombre des ports de Tobjet. XI. Affranchissement insuffisant. 1. Lorsqu’un objet est insuffisamment affranchi au moyen de timbres-poste, TOffice expediteur indique, au moyen d’un timbre ou d’un autre precede, en chiffres bien lisibles apposes a cote des timbres- poste, le double du montant de Tinsuffi- sance en Texprimant en francs et centimes. II est fait exception, toutefois, pour les correspondances qui sont devenues insuf fisamment affranchies par suite de leur reexpedition et auxquelles sont appli- cables les dispositions de Tarticle XXVII du present Reglement. 2 . D’apres cette indication, le bureau d’echange du pays de destination frappe Tobjet du montant de la taxe annotee, conformement aux dispositions du § 3 de Particle 5 de la Convention. 7. Articles to be delivered by express are impressed with a stamp bearing in large letters the word “ Express.” Ad ministrations are, however, authorised to substitute for that stamp a printed label or a written inscription underlined with a coloured pencil. Correspondence which has been marked “ Express ” by the Office of origin is delivered by special messenger, even when prepayment has been omitted or is insuffi cient. In such cases the Office of Exchange of the country of destination is bound to report the irregularity by Verification Note to the Central Administration to which the Office of origin is subordinate. This Verification Note must state very precisely the origin and date of posting of the article. 8 . Every article of correspondence which does not bear the stamp T is con sidered to be paid and treated accordingly, unless there be an obvious error. 9. Postage stamps not cancelled in consequence of error or omission on the part of the Office of origin must be cancelled in the usual way by the Office which detects the irregularity. X. Indication of the Number of Bates. When a letter or other article of correspondence, unpaid or insufficiently prepaid, is liable, by reason of its weight, to more than a single rate of postage, the Office of origin, or of entry into the Union, as the case may be, indicates in the upper left-hand corner of the address, in ordinary figures, the number of rates. XL Insufficient Prepayment. 1 . When an article is insufficiently prepaid by means of postage stamps, the despatching Office indicates by means of a stamp or other process in easily read figures placed by the side of the postage stamps, double the amount of the deficiency, expressing it in francs and centimes. An exception is made, however, in the case of correspondence which has become insufficiently prepaid in conse- quence of redirection and to which the stipulations of Article XXVII. of the present Regulations are applicable. 2. According to this indication, the office of exchange of the country of the destination taxes the article with the amount marked, in conformity with the provisions of paragraph 3 of Article 5 of the Convention.42 UNIVERSAL POSTAL UNION. 3. Dans le cas oa il a ete fait usage de timbres-poste non valables pour I’affran- chissement, il n’en est term aucun conipte. Cette circonstance est indiquee par le cliilfre zero (0), place a cote des timbres- poste. XII. Conditiomicment des objets recommandcs. 1. Les objets de correspondance adresses sous des initiales et ceux qui por tent une adresse ecrite an crayon ne sont pas admis a la recommandation. 2. Aucune condition speciale de forme on de fermeture n’est exigee pour les objets recommandes. Chaque Office a la faculte d’appliquer ii ces envois les regies etablies dans son service interieur. 3. Les objets recommandes doivent porter a Tangle gauche superieur de la suscription une etiquette con forme on analogue au modele B annexe au present Reglement, avec Tindication en caracteres latins, du nom du bureau d’origine et du numero d’ordre sous lequel Tenvoi est inscrit dans le registre de ce bureau. Toutefois, il est permis aux Administra tions dont le regime interieur s’oppose actuellement a Temploi des etiquettes, d’ajourner la mise a execution de cette mesure et de continuer a employer des timbres pour la designation des objets recommandes. Il est cependant de rigueur, pour les Offices qui n’ont pas adopte Tetiquette modele J&gt;, de designer chaque envoi re- commande par un numero d’ordre. Ce numero doit etre inscrit a Tangle gauche superieur de la suscription. Il est obli- gatoire pour les Offices reexpediteurs de designer Tenvoi par le numero original. 4. Les envois recommandes non af- franchis on insuffisamment affranchis sont transmis aux destinataires sans taxe, mais le bureau qui re^oit un envoi dans ces conditions est tenu de signaler le cas par bulletin de verification a TAdministration dont releve le bureau d’origine. Le bulletin doit relater tres exactement Torigine, la date du depot, le poids, la nature et le numero de Tenvoi, ainsi que ia valeur des timbres-poste apposes sur Tobjet recommande si Taft'ranchissement est insuffisant. Cette prescription ne s’applique pas aux envois recommandes qui, par suite de reexpedition, deviennent passibles (Tune taxe superieure. Ces derniers envois sont traites en conformity des dispositions du § 2 de Tarticle XXVII du present Reglement. 3. If postage stamps not available for prepayment have been employed, no ac count is taken of them. This circumstance is indicated by the figure naught (0) placed by the side of the postage stamps. XII. Stipulations respecting Registered Articles. 1. Correspondence addressed to initials or in pencil is not admitted to registration. 2. No special conditions as to form or fastening are prescribed for registered articles. Each Office has the right to apply to such articles the regulations in force in its inland service. 3. Registered articles should bear in the upper left-hand corner of the address labels in conformity with or analogous to the pattern B annexed to the present Regulations, indicating in Roman cha racters the name of the Office of origin and the number under which the article is entered in the records of that Office. Nevertheless, Administrations whose in land regulations do not at present admit the use of labels may postpone the intro duction of this arrangement, and continue the use of stamps to distinguish registered articles. It is, however, compulsory for Offices which have not adopted the label pattern B to designate each registered article by a number. This number must be written in the upper left-hand corner of the ad dress. It is obligatory for forwarding Offices to designate the article by the original number. 4. Unpaid or insufficiently paid regis tered articles are forwarded to the addressees without charge, but the Office which re ceives an article in these conditions is bound to report the case by verification note to the Administration to which the Office of origin is subordinate. The note must make precise mention of the origin, the date of posting, the weight, the nature, and the number of the article, as well as the value of the postage stamps affixed to the registered article in the case of insuf ficient prepayment. This rule does not apply to registered articles which, in consequence of redirec tion, become liable to higher postage. Such articles are treated in conformity with the provisions of § 2 of Article XXVII of the present Regulations.DETAILED REGULATIONS. 43 XIII Indemnite pour la perte d'un envoi recommande. Lorsque 1’indemnite due pour la perte d’un envoi recommande a ete payee par une Administration pour le compte d’une autre Administration, rendue responsable, ceile-ci est tenue d’en rembourser le montant dans le delai de trois mois apres avis du payement. Ge remboursement s’effectue, soit an moyen d’un mandat de poste on d’une traite, soit en especes ayant cours dans le pays crediteur. Lorsque le remboursement de 1’indemnite comporte des frais, ils sont toujours a la charge de 1’Office debiteur. XIV. Avis de reception des objets recommandes. 1. Les envois dont 1’expediteur de- mande un avis de reception doivent porter 1’annotation tres apparente “Avis de reception ” ou 1’empreinte d’un timbre portant: A. R. 2. Ils sont accompagnes d’une formule conforme ou analogue au modele C ci- annexe ; cette formule est etablie par le bureau d’origine ou par tout autre bureau a designer par 1’Office expediteur etreunie, au moyen d’un croise de ficelle, a I’objet auquel elle se rapporte. Si elle ne parvient pas au bureau de destination, celui-ci dresse d’office un nouvel avis de reception. Les avis de reception doivent etre formules en frangais ou porter une tra duction sublineaire en cette langue. 3. lie bureau de destination, .apres avoir dument rempli la formule C, la ren- voie sous enveloppe au bureau d’origine. 4. Lorsque 1’expediteur demande un avis de reception d’un objet recommande posterieurement au depot de cet objet, le bureau d’origine reproduit sur une formule 0, prealablement revetue d’un timbre- poste representant la taxe d’avis de recep tion, la description tres exacte de I’objet recommande (nature de 1’objet, bureau d’origine, date de depot, numero, adresse complete du destinataire). Cette formule est attachee a une recla mation modele H et traitee selon les prescriptions de 1’article XXX du present Reglement, a cette exception pres, que, en cas de distribution reguliere de 1’envoi auquel 1’avis de reception se rapporte, le bureau de destination retire la formule E et renvoie la formule 0, dument remplie, au bureau d’origine de la maniere prescrite au § 3 precedent. XIII. Indemnity for the Loss of a Registered Article. When the indemnity due for the loss of a registered article has been paid by one Administration, on behalf of another Administration which is responsible for the loss, the latter is bound to repay the amount within three months after receiving notice of the payment. This repayment is effected either by means of a postal money order or a draft, or in specie current in the country to which paymeni is due. When the repayment of the indemnity involves expenses, they are always borne by the indebted Office. XIV. Advices of Delivery of Registered Articles. 1. Articles for which the sender requires an advice of delivery must be marked very clearly with the inscription, “ Avis de reception,” or be stamped with the letters A.R. 2. They are accompanied by a form in accordance with or analogous to the pattern 0 annexed ; this form is made out by the Office of origin or by any other Office which the despatching Office may appoint, and is attached by string tied crosswise to the article to which it relates. If it does not reach the Office of destination, the latter makes one out for itself. Advices of delivery must be drawn up in French or must bear a sublineary translation in that language. 3. The Office of destination, after having duly filled up form G returns it under cover to the Office of origin. 4. When the sender applies for an advice of delivery of a registered article after the article has been posted, the Office of origin enters in a form G, after affixing to it a postage stamp representing the fee for an advice of delivery, an exact descrip tion of the registered article (its nature, Office of origin, date of posting, number, complete address of the addressee). This form is attached to a form pattern II and treated according to the provisions of Article XXX. of the present Regulations, with the exception that, in case of the regular delivery of the article to which the advice of delivery relates, the Office of destination withdraws the form H and returns form G duly completed, to the Office of origin in the manner prescribed by the preceding paragraph 3.44 UNIVERSAL POSTAL UNION. Ciiaque Administration a la faculte, le cas echeant, de reunir la formule C et la formule 71 en ime seule formule. 5. Si un avis de reception regulierement demande par I’expediteur an moment du depot, n’est pas parvenu dans les delais voulus an bureau d’origine, on procede, pour reclamer 1’avis manquant, conforme- ment aux regies tracees au § 4 precedent. Toutefois, dans ce dernier oas, au lieu de revetir la formule C d’un timbre-poste, le bureau d’origine inscrit en tete la mention “ Duplicata de 1’avis de reception, etc.” C. Les dispositions particulieres adop tees par les Administrations en vertu du ^ 5 de I’article XXX du present Reglement, pour la transmission des re clamations d’objets recommandes sont applicables aux demandes d’avis de re ception formulees posterieurement au depot des objets recommandes. XV. Envois recommandes greves de rem- boursement. 1. Les envois recommandes greves de remboursement doivent porter sur le i;ecto 1’entete “ Remboursement ” ecrit ou imprime d’une maniere tres apparente et suivi de I’indication du montant du rem boursement dans la monnaie du pays de destination, sauf arrangement contraire entre les Administrations interessees. Ce montant est exprime en caracteres latins, en toutes lettres et en chiffres, sans rature ni surcharge, meme approuvees.

Les envois recommandes greves de remboursement doivent etre revetus, au recto, d une etiquette de couleur orange, conforme au modele D annexe au present Reglement. 3. bi le destinataire ne paye pas le montant du remboursement dans un delai de 7 jours dans les relations entre pays d’Europe et dans un delai de 15 jours dans les relations des pays d’Europe avec les pays hors d’Europe et de ces derniers pays entre eux, a partir du jour qui suit celui de I’arrivee au bureau destinataire, 1 ’envoi est reexpedie au bureau d’origine. 4. Sauf autre arrangement, la somme recouvree, deduction faite du droit d’encaissement prevu a I’article 7, § 2, de la Convention et de la taxe ordinaire des mandats de poste, est convertie en un mandat de poste portant en tete du recto la mention “ Remb.” et etabli pour le Each Administration has the option, if it desires to combine form C and form H in one form. 5. If an advice of delivery duly applied for by the sender at the time of posting is not received back after a proper interval in the Ofhce of origin, enquiry for the missing advice is instituted in accordance with the procedure prescribed by the fore going § 4. In this case, however, instead of affixing a postage stamp to form G the Office of origin inscribes it with the heading “ Duplicata de 1’avis de recep tion, etc.” 6 . The special arrangements adopted by Administrations in pursuance of para graph 5 of Article XXX. of the present Regulations for the transmission of enquiries respecting registered articles are applicable to requests for advices of de livery made after the article has been posted. XV. Registered Articles marked with Trade Charges. 1 . Registered articles marked with trade charges must bear on the address side the heading “Remboursement,” written or printed in a prominent manner, and followed by the indication of the amount of the trade charge in the money of the country of destination, unless there are arrangements to the contrary between the Administrations interested. This amount is expressed in Roman characters, in words and in figures, without erasure or correction, even if certified. The sender must indicate on the front or on the back his name and address likewise in Roman characters. 2 . Registered articles marked with trade charges must bear on the address side an orange-coloured label similar to pattern D. annexed to the present Regulations. 3.

In the absence of any arrangement to the contrary articles marked with trade charges may be redirected from one of the countries participating in this service to another of those countries. In case of re direction, the sender’s marking of the trade charge is preserved intact. Upon the Office of final destination alone de volves the conversion into its currency of the amount of the trade charges, in ac cordance with the rate of exchange in force for money orders, in cases where its monetary system is not that in which the trade charges are expressed; it also devolves upon that Office to draw a money order for the amount of the trade charges on the country of origin.

Les paquets ou sacs d’objets recom mandes sont places au centre de la depeche et de maniere a attirer I’attention de I’agent qui procede a I’ouverture. 3. Le mode d’endiallage et de trans mission des objets recommandes, prescrit ci-dessus, s’applique seulement aux rela tions ordinaires. Pour les relations importantes, il appartient aux Administra tions interessees de prescrire, d’un commun accord, des dispositions particulieres, sous reserve, dans I’un comme dans 1’autre cas, des mesures exceptionnelles a prendre par les chefs des bureaux d’echange lorsqu’ils out a assurer la transmission d’objets recommandes qui, par leur nature, leur forme ou leur volume, ne seraient pas susceptibles d’etre inseres dans la depeche.

The packets or bags of registered articles are placed in the centre of the mail in such a manner as to attract the attention of the Officer who opens it. 3. The mode of packing and forward ing registered articles, prescribed above, applies only to ordinary exchanges. For important exchanges it is fqr the offices concerned to prescribe by common consent special arrangements, subject in the one case as in the other to exceptional measures to be taken by the heads of the Offices of exchange, when they have to ensure the transmission of registered articles which, from their nature, form, or size, would not be capable of being enclosed in the principal mail. XXIII. Transmission of correspondence intended for express delivery. 1 . Ordinary correspondence intended for express delivery is combined in a special bundle and inserted, by the Offices of exchange, in the envelope containing the letter bill which accompanies the mail. When the case arises, a label placed in this bundle indicates the presence in the mail of correspondence of this nature which by reason of its form or size cannot be placed with the letter bill. 2.

D 354 UNIVERSAL POSTAL UNION. XXIV. Confection des depeches. 1. En regie generale, les objets qui composent les depeches doivent etre classes et enliasses par nature de correspondances, en separant les objets affranchis des objets non on insuffisamment affranchis. Les lettres portant des traces d’ouver- ture on d’avarie doivent etre munies d’une mention du fait et frappees du timbre a date du bureau qui a constate ce fait. Les mandats de poste expedies a de- couvert sont reunis en un paquet distinct, apres subdivision, s’il y a lieu, en autant de basses qu’il y a de pays destinataires. Ce paquet est insere autant que faire se pent, par les bureaux d’echange, dans Penveloppe contenant la feuille d’avis qui accompagne la depeche. 2. Dans les echanges par voie de terre toute depeche, apres avoir ete ficelee, est enveloppee de papier fort en quantite sufhsante pour eviter toute deterioration du contenu, puis ficelee exterieurement et cachetee a la cire an moyen du cachet du bureau. Elle est munie d’une suscription imprimee portant, en petits caracteres, le nom du bureau expediteur et, en caracteres plus forts, le nom du bureau destinataire : “ de . . . . pour . . . .” Les depeches expedites par voie de mer sont renfermees dans des sacs convenable- ment fermes, cachetes on plombes et etiquetes. II en est de meme des depeches expediees par la voie de terre lorsque leur volume le comporte. 3. Pour les depeches renfermees dans des sacs, les etiquettes doivent etre en toile, cuir on parchemin ou en papier colle sur une planchette. L’etiquette doit indi- quer d’une fagon lisible le bureau d’ori- gine et celui de destination. 4. Lorsque le nombre ou le volume des envois exige I’emploi de plus d’un sac, des sacs distincts doivent, autant que possible, etre utilises: (а) pour les lettres et cartes postales ; (б) pour les autres objets. Chaque sac doit porter Findication de son contenu. Le paquet ou sac des objets recom- mandes est place dans un des sacs de lettres. Ce sac est designe par la lettre F tracee d’une maniere apparente sur 1’etiquette. 5. Le poids de chaque sac doit ne pas depasser 40 kilogrammes. 6. Les sacs doivent etre renvoyes vides au pays d’origine par le prochain courrier, sauf autre arrangement entre les Offices correspondants. XXIV. Making up the mails. 1. As a general rule, the articles of which the mails consist must be classified and tied up in bundles according to the nature of the correspondence, the prepaid y correspondence being separated from the unpaid and insufficiently prepaid. Letters bearing traces of violation or damage must have the fact noted on them and be marked with the date stamp of the Office making the note. Monev Orders sent d decouvert are «/ made up in a separate packet after sub division, if necessary, into as many bundles as there are countries of destination. This packet is inserted, whenever practicable, by the Offices of exchange in the envelope containing the Letter Bill which accom panies the Mail. 2. In territorial exchanges every mail, after having been tied with string, is wrapped in strong paper sufficient in quantity to prevent damage to the contents, then tied again with string on the outside, and sealed with wax by means of the official seal. The mail is furnished with a a printed address bearing, in small characters, the name of the Despatching Office, and in larger characters the name of the Office of destination : “From .... for . . . .” Mails sent by sea are enclosed in bags properly closed, sealed with wax or with lead and labelled. The same rule applies in the case of Mails sent by land when their size requires it. 3. The labels used for mails sent in bags must be of linen, leather or parchment, or of paper affixed to blocks. The label should indicate in a legible manner the Office of origin and that of destination. 4. When the number or bulk of the mails necessitates the use of more than one bag, separate bags must as far as possible be utilised : (а) For letters and post cards ; (б) For other articles. Each bag must bear the indication of its contents. The packet or bag of registered articles is placed in one of the bags of letters. This bag is distinguished by the letter F marked plainly on the label. 5. No bag must exceed 40 kilogrammes in weight. 6. The bags must be returned empty to the country of origin by the next mail, in the absence of other arrangements between the corresponding Offices..DETAILED REGULATIONS. 55 Le renvoi des sacs vides doit etre effectu6 entre les bureaux d’ecliange des pays correspondants, qui sont respective- ment designes a cet effet par les Admi nistrations interessees, apres entente prealable. Les sacs vides doivent etre enroules et attaches ensemble en paquets convenables ; les cas echeant, les planchettes a etiquettes doivent etre placees a I’interieur des sacs. Les paquets doivent etre revetus d’une etiquette indiquant le nom du bureau d echange d’ou les sacs ont ete reQus, chaque fois qu’ils sont renvoyes par I’intermediaire d’un autre bureau d’echange. Pi les sacs vides a renvoyer ne sont pas trop nombreux, ils peuvent etre places dans les sacs contenantla correspondance ; dans le cas contraire, ils doivent etre places a part dans des sacs cachetes, etiquetes au nom des bureaux d’echange respectifs. Les etiquettes doivent porter la mention “Sacs vides.” XXV. Verification des depeches. 1. Le bureau d’echange qui regoit une depeche constate si les inscriptions sur la feuille d’avis et, s’il y a lieu, sur la liste des objets recoimnandes, sont exactes. Les depeches doivent etre livrees en bon etat. Cependant, la reception d’une depeche ne pent pas etre refusee a cause de son mauvais etat. S’il s’agit d’une depeche pour un autre bureau que celui qui en a pris livraison, elle doit etre emballee de nouveau, tout en conservant, autant que possible, I’emballage original. Le remballage est precede de la verification du contenu s’il est a presumer que celui- ci n’est pas reste intact. 2. Lorsque le bureau d’echange re- connait des erreurs on des omissions, il opere immediatement les rectifications necessaires sur les feuilles ou listes, en ayant soin de biffer, d’un trait de plume, les indications erronees de mani&amp;re a laisser reconnaitre les inscriptions primitives. 3. Ces rectifications s’effectuent par le concours de deux agents. A moins d’une erreur evidente, elles prevalent sur la declaration originale. 4. Un bulletin de verification, con- forme au module F annexe au present Reglement, est dresse par le bureau destinataire et envoye sans delai, sous recommandation d’office, au bureau expediteur. The return of empty bags must be effected by such Offices of exchange of the corresponding countries as are respectively appointed for the purpose by the Admini strations interested, after previous under standing. The empty bags must be rolled up and tied together in suitable bundles ; the label blocks, if any, being placed in the inside of the bags. The bundles must be supplied with a label showing the name of the Office of exchange whence the bags have been received on every occasion when they are returned through another Office of ex change. If the bags to be returned are not too numerous they may be placed in the bags containing correspondence. In the con trary case, they must be placed separately in sealed bags, labelled with the name of the respective Offices of exchange. The labels must be marked “Sacs vides” (empty bags). XXV. Verification of the mails. ]. The Office of exchange which receives a mail ascertains whether the entries in the letter bill and in the regis tered letter list, if there be one, are correct. The mails must be delivered in good condition. Nevertheless, the receipt of a mail cannot be refused on account of its bad condition. In the case of a mail for an Office other than that which has received it, it must be packed up afresh, but the original packing should be pre served as far as possible. The repacking is preceded by a verification of the con tents, if there is reason to suppose that they are not intact. 2. When the Office of exchange detects errors or omissions, it immediately makes the necessary corrections on the letter bills or lists, taking care to erase by a stroke of the pen the erroneous entries in such a manner as to leave the original entries legible. 3. These corrections are made by two officers. Except in the case of an obvious error, they are accepted in preference to the original statement. 4. A verification note, in conformity with the pattern F annexed to the present Regulations, is prepared by the receiving Office, and sent without delay, officially registered, to the despatching Office.56 UNIVERSAL POSTAL UNION. Dans le cas prevu au § 1 du present article, une copie du bulletin de verification est inseree dans la depeche remball^e. 5. Le bureau expediteur, apres examen, renvoie le bulletin, avec ses observations, s’il y a lieu. 6 . En cas de manque d’une depeche, d’un ou de plusieurs objets recommandes de la feuille d’avis ou de la liste speciale, le fait est constate immediatement, dans la forme voulue, par deux agents du bureau d’echange destinataire et porte a la con- naissance du bureau d’echange expediteur, au moyen d’un bulletin de verification recommande d’office. Toutefois, lorsque 1 ’absence d’une depeche est le resultat d’un defaut de coincidence des courriers, le bulletin de verification n’est pas soumis a la formalite de la recommandation. Si le cas le comporte, le bureau d’echange expeditenr pent, en outre, etre avise par telegramme, aux frais de 1’Office expediteur du telegramme. En meme temps, un duplicata du bulletin de verification est envoye, par le bureau destinataire, dans les memes conditions que le primata, a 1 ’Administration dont releve le bureau expediteur et, lorsqu’il s’agit du manque d’un ou de plusieurs objets recommandes, de la feuille d’avis ou de la liste speciale des objets recommandes, ce duplicata doit etre accompagne du sac ou de 1’enveloppe et du cachet du paquet desdits objets ou du sac, de la ficelle, de I’etiquette et du cachet de la depeche, si ce paquet lui- meme n’a pas ete trouve. Des la rentree d’une depeche dont 1 ’absence avait ete signalee au bureau d origine ou a un bureau intermediaire, il y a lieu d’adresser au meme bureau un second bulletin de verification annon^ant la reception de cette depeche. Lorsque le manque d’une depeche est dument explique sur le bordereau de remise et si cette depeche parvient au bureau destinataire par le plus prochain courrier, Tetablissement d’un bulletin de verification n’est pas necessaire. 7. En cas de perte d’une depeche close, les offices intermediaires sont rendus responsables des objets recom mandes que renfermait la depeche, dans les limites de 1’art. 8 de la Convention, a condition que la non-reception de cette depeche leur ait ete signalee aussitot que possible. 8 . Lorsque le bureau destinataire n’a pas fait parvenir au bureau expediteur, par le premier courrier apres la verifica tion, un bulletin constatant des erreurs ou des irregularites quelconques, 1’absence In the case contemplated in para graph 1 of the present Article, a copy of the verification note is inserted in the repacked mail. 5. The despatching Office, after exami nation, returns the verification note with any observations to which it may give rise. 6 . In case of the failure of a mail, of one or more registered articles, of the letter bill, or of the special list, the fact is immediately verified in the prescribed manner by two officers of the Exchange Office of destination, and notified to the despatching Office by means of a verifica tion note officially registered. Neverthe less, when the absence of a mail is the result of a failure of connexions the verification note is not sent registered. If circumstances require, the depatching Office of exchange may also be advised by telegram, at the expense of the Office which sends the telegram. At the same time a duplicate of the verification note is sent by the Office of destination in the same conditions as the original to the Administration to which the despatching Office is subordinate, and when it is a case of the non-receipt of one or more registered articles, of the letter bill, or of the special list of registered articles, this duplicate must be accompanied by the bag or envelope, and by the seal of the packet of the articles in question, or of the sack and by the string, the label, and the seal of the mail, if the packet itself has not been found. As soon as a mail which had been reported to the Office of origin or an inter mediate Office as missing comes to hand, a second verification note is to be ad dressed to such Office announcing the receipt of the mail. When the failure of a mail is duly explained on the way bill, and if this mail reaches the Office of destination by the next opportunity, the preparation of a verification note is not necessary. 7. In the event of the loss of a closed mail, intermediate Offices become respon sible for the registered articles contained in the mail, within the limits of Article 8 of the Convention, provided that the non- receipt of such mail shall have been notified to them as soon as possible. 8 . Where the Office of destination has not forwarded to the despatching Office by the first mail after verification, a certificate reporting errors or irregularities of any kind, the absence of that document is toDETAILED REGULATIONS. 57 de ce document vaut comme accuse de reception de la depeche et de son contenu, jusqu’a preuve du contraire. be regarded as evidence of the due receipt of the mail and its contents, until the contrary be proved. XXVI. XXVI. Depeches echangees avec des bdtiments de guerre. 1. L’etablissement d’un echange, en depeches closes, entre un Office postal de I’Union et des divisions navales on bati- ments de guerre de meme nationalite, ou entre une division navale ou batiment de guerre et une autre de meme nationalite, doit etre notifie, autant que possible a 1’avance aux Offices intermediaires. 2. La suscription de ces depeches est redigee comnie suit: Du bureau de . . . . . fla division navale (nationalite) de (designation de la division) a le batiment (nationalite) le (nom du batiment) a . . . (Pays) ou De la division navale (nationalite) de (designation de la division) a . Du batiment (nationalite) le (nom du batiment) a .... . Pour le bureau de . . . .

Les depeches a destination ou provenant de divisions navales ou de ba- timents de guerre sont acheminees, sauf indication d’une voie speciale sur I’adresse, par les voies les plus rapides et dans les memes conditions que les depeches echangees entre bureaux de poste. Quand les depeches a destination d’une division navale ou d’un batiment de guerre sont expediees en dehors, le capitaine du paquebot postal qui les transporte les tient a la disposition du commandant de la division ou du batiment destinataire pour le cas ou celui-ci viendrait demander au paquebot en route la livraison de ces depeches. 4 . Si les batiments ne se trouvent pas au lieu de destination quand les depeches a leur adresse y arrivent, ces depeches sont conservees au bureau de poste, en attendant leur retrait par le destinataire Mails exchanged with Ships of War. 1. The establishment of an exchange of closed mails between a Post Office of the Union and naval divisions or ships of war of the same nationality or between one naval division or ship of war and another of the same nationality must be notified, as far as possible in advance, to the intermediate offices. 2. The address of such mails should be in the following form : From the Post Office of . . . the (nationality) naval division of (name of the division) at . 1 * or • i • • ] the (nationality) ship (name of the ship) at . (Country) or From the (nationality) naval division of (name of the division) at . From the (nationality) ship (name of the ship) at .... . For the Post Office of ...

' the (nationality) naval division (name of the division) at For ■&lt; i the (nationality) ship (name of the ship) at . t (Country) 3. Mails addressed to or sent from naval divisions or ships of war are for warded, unless specially addressed as to route, by the most rapid routes, and in the same conditions as mails exchanged between Post Offices. When mails for a naval division or ship of war are sent unenclosed, the captain of the Packet conveying them holds them at the disposal of the commanding officer of the naval division or ship addressed, in case the latter should require delivery of the mails while the Packet is on her way. 4. If the ships are not at the place of destination when mails addressed to them arrive there, the mails are kept at the Post Office until fetched away by the addressee or redirected to another place.58 UNIVERSAL POSTAL UNION. ou leur reexpedition sur un autre point. La reexpedition pent etre demandee, soit par TOffice postal d’origine, soit par le commandant de la division navale ou du batiment destinataire, soit enfin par un Consul de meme nationalite. 5. Celles des depeclies dont il s’agit qui portent la mention “ Aux soins du Consul de ” sont consignees au Consulat du pays d’origine. Elies peuvent etre ulterieurement, a la demande du Consul, reintegrees dans le service postal et reexpediees sur le lieu d’origine ou sur une autre destination. 6. Les depeches a destination d’un batiment de guerre sont considerees comme etant en transit jusqu’a leur remise au commandant de ce batiment de guerre, alors meme qu’elles auraient ete primitivement adressees aux soins d’un bureau de poste ou a un Consul charge de servir d’agent de transport intermediaire ; elles ne sont done pas considerees comme etant par- venues a leur adresse tant qu’elles n’auront pas ete delivrees au batiment de guerre respectif. XXVII. Correspondances reexpediees. 1. En execution de 1’article 14 de la Convention, et sauf les exceptions prevues au paragraphe 2 suivant, les correspon- dances de toute nature adressees, dans 1’Union, a des destinataires ayant change de residence, sont traitees par I’Office dis- tributeur comme si elles avaient ete adressees directement du lieu d’origine au lieu de la nouvelle destination. 2. A l’egard, soit des envois du service interne de 1’un des pays de 1’Union qui entrent par suite de reexpedition dans le service d’un autre pays de 1’Union, soit des envois echanges entre deux pays de 1’Union qui ont adopte dans leurs relations reciproques une taxe inferieure a la taxe ordinaire de 1’Union, mais entrant, par suite de reexpedition, dans le service d’un troisieme pays de 1’Union vis-a-vis duquel la taxe est la taxe ordinaire de 1’Union, soit, enfin, des envois echanges pour leur premier parcours entre localites de deux services limitrophes pour lesquels il existe une taxe reduite, mais reexpedi6s sur d’autres localites de ces pays de 1’Union ou sur un autre pays de 1’Union, on observe les regies suivantes : 1° Les envois non affranchis ou in- suffisamment aflranchis pour leur premier parcours sont frappes, par I’Office distributeur, de la taxe applicable aux envois de meme Redirection may be demanded, either by the Post Office of origin, or by the commanding officer of the naval division or the ship addressed, or, lastly, by a Consul of the same nationality. 5. Such of the mails in question as bear the inscription “ To the care of the Consul at .... ” are delivered at the Consulate of the country of origin. At the request of the Consul they may afterwards be received back into the postal service and redirected to the place of origin or to another address. 6. Mails addressed to a ship of war are regarded as being in transit up to the time of their delivery to the commanding officer of that ship of war, even when they shall have been originally addressed to the care of a Post Office or to a Consul entrusted with the duty of acting as for warding agent; they are not, therefore, regarded as having arrived at their address so long as they shall not have been delivered to the ship of war concerned. XXVII. liedirected correspondence. 1. In execution of Article 14 of the Convention, and subject to the exceptions specified in paragraph 2 following, cor respondence of every kind circulating in the Union, addressed to persons who have changed their residence, is treated by the delivering Office as if it had been addressed directly from the place of origin to the place of the new destination. 2. With regard to inland letters or packets of one country of the Union, which enter, in consequence of redirection, into the service of another country of the Union, or to letters or packets exchanged between two countries of the Union, which have adopted in their reciprocal relations a lower rate than the ordinary Union postage, but entering, in consequence of redirection, into the service of a third country of the Union as regards which the rate is the ordinary Union postage, or, lastly, to letters or packets exchanged, so far as their first transmission is con cerned, between places in two neighbouring countries of the Union within a radius for which there exists a reduced rate, but redirected to other places in these countries or to another country of the Union, the following rules are observed : 1° Articles unpaid or insufficiently paid for their first transmission are subjected by the delivering Office to the charge applicable to articles of the same natureDETAILED REGULATIONS. 59 nature directement adresses du point d’origine au lieu de la destination nouvelle. 2 ° Les envois regulierement affrancliis pour leur premier parcours et dont le complement de taxe afferent au X. / parcours ulterieur n’a pas ete acquitte avant leur reexpedition, sont frappes, suivant leur nature, par I’Office distributeur, d’une taxe egale a la difference entre le prix d’affranchissement deja ac- quitte et celui qui aurait ete pergu si les envois avaient ete expedies primitivement sur leur nouvelle destination. Le montant de cette difference doit etre exprime en francs et centimes, a cote des timbres-poste, par 1’Office reex- editeur. Dans Tun et 1’autre cas, les taxes prevues ci-dessus restent exigibles du destinataire alors meme que, par suite de reexpeditions successives, les envois re- viennent dans le pays d’origine. 3. Lorsque des objets primitivement adresses a I’interieur d’un pays de TUnion et affranchis en numeraire sont reexpedies a un autre pays, I’Office reexpediteur doit indiquer, sur 1’objet, le montant, en monnaie de franc, de la difference entre la taxe perdue et la taxe Internationale. 4 . Les objets de toute nature mal diriges sont, sans aucun delai, reexpedies par la voie la plus prompte sur leur destination. 5. Les correspondances de toute nature ordinaires on recommandees, qui, portant une adresse incomplete ou erronee, sont renvoyees aux expediteurs pour qu’ils la completent ou la rectifient, ne sont pas, quand elles sont remises dans le service avec une suscription completee ou rectifiee, considerees comme des correspondances reexpediees, mais bien comme de nouveaux envois, et deviennent, par suite, passibles d’une nouvelle taxe. xxvm. Correspondances tombees en rebut. 1 . Les correspondances de toute nature qui sont tombees en rebut pour quelque cause, que ce soit, doivent etre renvoyees, aussitot apres les delais de conservation voulus par les reglements du pays des tinataire, et au plus tard dans un delai de six mois dans les relations ayec les pays doutre-mer et de deux mois pour les autres relations, par I’intermediaire des bureaux d’echange respectifs et en une addressed directly from the place of origin to that of the new destination. 2° Articles regularly prepaid for their first transmission, on which the complementary postage pertaining to the further transmission has not been paid before their second despatch, are subjected, according to their nature, by the delivering Office to a charge equal to the difference between the amount of postage already prepaid and that which would have been chargeable if the articles had been despatched in the first instance to the new destination. The amount of this difference must be expressed in francs and centimes, by the side of the postage stamps, by the redirecting Office. In both cases the charges provided for above are leviable from the addressees, even if, owing to successive redirections, the articles should return to the country of origin. 3. When correspondence originally addressed from one part to another of a country of the Union, and prepaid in money, is redirected to another country, the redirecting Office must indicate on each article the amount, expressed in francs and centimes, of the difference between the amount paid and the inter national rate. 4. Mis-sent correspondence of all kinds is reforwarded without delay, by the quickest route, to destination. 5. Correspondence of all kinds, or dinary or registered, which, being wrongly or insufficiently addressed, is returned to the senders in order that they may rectify or complete the address, is not, when posted with the direction rectified or completed, regarded as redirected correspondence, but as being really fresh correspondence ; and it is consequently liable to fresh postage. XXVIII. Undelivered correspondence. 1. Correspondence of all kinds which is not delivered, from whatever cause, must be returned, as soon as possible after the period for keeping it required by the regulations of the country of destination, and at latest at the expiration of six months in relations with countries beyond sea, and of two months in other relations, through the medium of the respective Offices of exchange, and in a special60 UNIVERSAL POSTAL UNION. liasse speciale etiquetee : “ Rebuts ” et portant I’indication du pays d’origine des correspoudances. Les termes de deux mois et de six mois comptent a partir de la fin du mois dans lequel les correspon- dances sont parvenues an bureau de destination. 2. Toutefois, les correspondances re- commandees tombees en rebut sont ren- voyees au bureau d’ecliange du pays d’origine comme s’il s’agissait de corres pondances recommandees a destination de ce pays, sauf qu’en regard de Tinscription nominative au tableau n°. 1 de la feuille d avis ou sur la liste detachee, la mention “ Rebuts ” est consignee dans la colonne “ Observations ” par le bureau reexpedi- teur. 3. Par exception, deux Offices corres- pondants peuvent, d’un commun accord, adopter un autre mode de renvoi de rebuts. Us peuvent aussi s’entendre pour se dispenser de se renvoyer reciproquement certains imprimes consideres comme denues de valeur, ainsi que les “ chain- letters ” (lettres dites boules de neige) insuffisamment affrancliies qui ont ete refusees par le destinataire, lorsque FOffice de destination a constate, apres avoir consulte le destinataire, que les envois en cause sont en effet des “ chain-letters.” 4. Avant de renvoyer a 1’Office d’ori gine les correspondances non distribuees pour un motif quelconque, FOffice destina taire doit indiquer d’une maniere claire et concise, en langue frangaise, surces objets, la cause de la non remise sous la forme suivante : inconnu, refuse, en voyage, parti, non reclame, decede, etc. Cette indication est fournie par 1’application d’un timbre ou I’apposition d’une etiquette. Chaque Office a la faculte d’ajouter la traduction, dans sa propre langue, de la cause de non-remise et les autres indica tions qui lui conviennent. 5. Si les correspondances mises a la poste dans un pays de 1’Union et adressees a Pinterieur de ce meme pays ont pour expediteurs des personnes habitant un autre pays et doivent, par suite de non distribution et de mise en rebut, etre renvoyees a 1’etranger pour etre rendues aleurs auteurs, elles deviennent des envois de rechange international. En pared cas, 1’Office reexpediteur et 1’Office dis- tributeur font application auxdites corres pondances des dispositions des §§ 2 et 3 de 1’article XXVII precedent. 6 . Les correspondances pour les marins et autres personnes adressees aux soins d’un Consul et rendues par celui-ci au bureau de poste local comme non-red amees bundle labelled “ Rebuts ” and bearing indication of the country where the corres pondence originated. The periods of two months and six months are reckoned from the end of the month in which the correspondence has reached the Office of destination. 2 . Nevertheless, undelivered registered correspondence is returned to the Office of exchange of the country of origin, as if it were registered correspondence addressed to that country, except that opposite the detailed advice in Table No. 1 of the letter bill, or in the separate list, the word ‘ Rebuts ’ is entered in the column of observations by the returning Office. 3. As an exception, two corresponding Offices may, by mutual consent, adopt a different mode of returning undelivered correspondence. They may also come to an understanding to dispense with the reciprocal return of certain printed papers considered as destitute of value, as well as insufficiently prepaid “ chain letters ” (known as snowball letters) which have been refused by the addressee, when the Office of destination has ascertained after consultation with the addressee, that the letters in question are actually “ chain letters.” 4. Before returning to the Office of origin correspondence which for any reason has not been delivered, the Office of destination must indicate in a clear and concise manner in the French language, on each article, the cause of the non delivery in the following form: “ not known,” “refused,” “travelling,” “gone away,” “not claimed,” “deceased,” &amp;c. This indication is made by the application of a stamp or by affixing a label. Each Office has the option of adding a trans lation, in its own language, of the cause of non-delivery, and any other useful particulars. 5. If correspondence posted in one country of the Union to an address within that country is sent by persons resident in another country, and has, in consequence of non-delivery, to be returned to the senders abroad, it enters into the inter national system. In such a case, the re-directing Office and the delivering Office apply to the said correspondence the provisions of §§ 2 and 3 of the preceding Article XXVII. 6 .

XXIX. • Reclamation d'objets ordmaires non parvenus. 1. Toute reclamation relative a un objet de correspondance ordinaire non parvenu a destination donne lieu au precede suivant: P II est rends au reclamant une formule conform e au moclele G ei-annexe, avec priere d’en remplir, aussi exactement que possible, la partie qui le concerne. 2’ Le bureau oil la reclamation s’est produite transmet la formule directement au bureau corres- pondant. La transmission s’effec- tue d’office et sans aucun ecrit. 3° Le bureau correspondant fait pre senter la formule au destinataire ou a Pexpediteur, selon le cas, avec priere de fournir des ren- seignements ii ce sujet. 4'’ Munie de ces renseignements, la formule est renvoyee d’office au bureau qui l’a dressee. 5° Dans le cas oil la reclamation est reconnue fondee, elle est transmise a FAdministration centrale pour servir de base aux investigations ulteri cures. G° A moins d’entente contraire, la formule est redigee en fran(yds ou porte une traduction frangaise. 2. Toute Administration pent exiger, par une notification adressee au Bureau international, que les reclamations qui concernent son service soient transmises it son Administration centrale ou ii un bureau specialement designe par elle. XXIX. Applications for ordinary articles which have failed to reach their destination. 1. Every application respecting an ordinary article of correspondence which has failed to reach its destination gives rise to the following procedure : 1° A form in conformity with the pattern G. annexed hereto is handed to the applicant, who is requested to fill up as exactly as possible the portion which concerns him. 2° The Office at which the application originates transmits the form directly to the corresponding Office. It is transmitted officially without any written communica tion. 3° The cor responding Office causes the form to be handed to the addressee or sender, as the case may be, with the request that particulars on the subject may be furnished. 4° With these particulars added, the form is sent back officially to the Office which prepared it. 5° When the application proves to be well founded, it is transmitted to the central Administration in order to serve as a basis for further investigations. G° In the absence of any under standing to the contrary, the form is drawn up in French or bears a French translation. 2. Any Administration can demand, by notification addressed to the Inter national Bureau, that applications which concern its service shall be transmitted to its central Administration or to an Office specially designated by it.

Dans le cas prevu au § 1 ci-dessus, lorsque rOdice destinataire est en etat de fournir les renseignements sur le sort definitif de Fenvoi reclame, il renvoie cette formule, revetue des renseignements que le cas comporte, a FOffice d’origine. Lorsque le sort d’un envoi qui a passe a decouvert par plusieurs services ne pent etre immediatement constate dans le service du pays de destination, FOffice destinataire transmet la formule au premier Office intermediaire, qui, apres avoir etabli les donnees de la transmission de 1’objet au service suivant, transmet la reclama tion a FOffice suivant et ainsi de suite, jusqu’a ce que le sort definitif de Fobjet reclame soit etabli. L’Office qui a effectue la remise au destinataire, ou qui, le cas eclieant, ne peut etablir, ni la remise, ni la transmission reguliere a une autre Administration, constate le fait sur la formule et la renvoie a FOffice d’origine. 4. Dans le cas prevu au § 2 ci-dessus, les recherches se poursuivent depuis FOffice d’origine jusqu’a FOffice de desti nation. Chaque Office etablit sur la formule les donnees de la transmission a FOffice suivant et Fenvoie ensuite a celui- ci. L’Office qui a effectue la remise au destinataire, ou qui, le cas eclieant, ne peut etablir ni la remise ni la transmission reguliere a une autre Administration, constate le fait sur la formule et la renvoie a FOffice d’origine. 5. Les formules H sont redigees en frangais ou portent une traduction sub- lineaire en cette langue. Elies doivent indiquer Fadresse complete du destinataire et etre acconipagnees, autant que possible, d’un fac-simile de Fenveloppe ou de la suscription de Fenvoi. Elies sont trans- mises sans lettre d’envoi sous enveloppe fermee. Chaque Administration est libre de demander, par une notification adressee au Bureau international, que les reclama tions qui concernent son service soient transmises, soit a son Administration cen- trale, soit ii un bureau speci^lement designe, soit enfin directement au bureau de destination ou, si elle est seulement interessee ii titre d’intermediaire, au bureau d’ecliange auquel Fenvoi a ete expedie. 6. Les dispositions qui precedent ne s’appliquent pas aux cas de spoliation de depeche, manque de depeche, etc., qui comportent une correspondance plus eten- due entre les Administrations. between each other, the application is sent from Office to Office, following the same route as the article under inquiry. 3. In the case contemplated in § 1 above, when the Office of destination is in s a position to furnish information as to the ultimate fate of the article under inquiry, it returns the form, filled in with the proper information, to the Office of origin. When the fate of an article which has passed d decouvert through several services camiot be immediately ascertained in the service of the country of destination, the Office of destination sends the form to the first intermediate Office, which, after having entered the particulars of the trans mission of the article to the next service, forwards the application to the next Office, and so on, until the ultimate fate of the article under inquiry is ascertained. The Office which has effected delivery to the addressee, or which, should it so happen, is unable to furnish proof either of delivery or of regular transmission to another Administration, records the fact on the form and returns it to the Office of origin. 4. In the case contemplated in § 2 above, the inquiries are prosecuted from the Office of origin to the Office of destina tion. Each Office enters on the form the particulars of the transmission to the next Office, and sends it forward to that Office. The Office which has effected delivery to the addressee, or which, should it so happen, is unable to furnish proof either of the delivery or of regular transmission to another Administration, records the fact on the form and returns it to the Office of origin. 5. The forms H. are drawn up in French, or bear a sublineary translation in that language. They must indicate the full address of the addressee, and be accompanied, as far as possible, by a facsimile of the envelope or of the address of the article. They are transmitted without covering letter in a closed envelope. Each Administration is free to require, by notification addressed to the International Bureau, that applications concerning its service shall be transmitted either to its central Administration, or to an Office specially designated, or, lastly, directly to the Office of destination, or, if the Ad ministration in question is only concerned as an intermediary, to the Office of exchange to which the article was sent. 6. The foregoing provisions do not apply to cases of violation of mails, loss of mails, &amp;c., which require a fuller corres pondence between Administrations,DETAILED REGULATIONS. 63 XXXI. Betrait de correspondances et rectification d'adresses. 1. Pour les demandes de renvoi on de reexpedition de correspondances, ainsi que pour les demandes de rectification d’adresses, I’expediteur doit faire usage d’une formule conforme au modele I annexe au present Reglement. En re- mettant cette reclamation au bureau de poste, I’expediteur doit y justifier de son identite et produire s’il y a lieu, le bulletin du depot. Apres la justification, dont PAdministration du pays d’origine assume la responsabilite, il est precede de la maniere suivante : 1° Si la demande est destinee a etre transmise par voie post^le, la formule, accompagnee d’un fac simile parfait de I’enveloppe ou suscription de 1’envoi, est expediee directement, sous pli recommande, au bureau de poste destinataire. 2° Si la demande doit etre faite par voie telegraphique, la formule est de- posee au service telegraphique charge d’en transmettre les termes au bureau de poste destinataire. 2. A la reception de la formule J ou du telegramme en tenant lieu, le bureau de poste destinataire recherche la corres- pondance signalee et donne a la demande la suite necessaire. Toutefois, s’il s’agit d’un changement d’adresse demande par voie telegraphique, le bureau destinataire se borne a retenir la lettre et attend, pour faire droit a la demande, 1’arrivee du fac-simile neces saire. Si la recherche est infructueuse, si 1’objet a deja ete remis au destinataire, ou si la demande par voie telegraphique n’est pas assez explicite pour permettre de reconnaitre surement 1’objet de corres- pondance indique, le fait est signale immediatement au bureau d’origine, qui en previent le reclamant. 3. A moins d’entente contraire, la formule I est redigee en frangais ou porte une traduction sublineaire en cette langue, et, dans le cas d’emploi de la voie tele graphique, le telegramme est formule en langue frangaise. 4. Une simple correction d’adresse (sans modification du nom ou de la qualite du destinataire) pent aussi etre demandee directement au bureau destinataire, e’est- a-dire, sans I’accomplissement des forma- lites prescrites pour le changement d’adresse proprement dit. 5. Toute Administration pent exiger, par une notification adressee au Bureau international, que Fechange des reclama- XXXI. Withdrawal of correspondence and correction of addresses. 1. For requests to have correspondence returned or redirected, as well as for requests to have addresses corrected, the sender must use a form in accordance with the specimen I. annexed to the present regulations. In handing this application to the Post Office, the sender must establish his identity and produce the certificate of posting, if there be one. The Administra tion of the country of origin assumes the responsibility in regard to identity, and, after its establishment, the course is as follows :— 1° If the request is meant to be sent by post, the form, together with a perfect facsimile of the envelope or address of the missive, is despatched in a registered cover directly to the Office of desti nation. 2° If the request is to be made by telegraph, the form is handed over to the telegraph service, charged with the transmission of its terms to the Office of destination. 2. On receipt of the form 7. or of the telegram taking its place, the Office of destination searches for the correspon dence in question and takes such steps as may be necessary. If, however, the case be one of an alteration of address requested by tele graph, the Office of destination only retains the letter and awaits the arrival of the necessary fac-simile before comply ing with the request. If the search is fruitless, or if the article has already been delivered to the addressee, or if the request by telegraph is not sufficiently explicit to admit of the identification of the article in question with certainty, the fact is at once com municated to the Office of origin, which informs the applicant accordingly. 3. In the absence of any understanding to the contrary, form 1. is drawn up in French, or bears a sublineary transla tion in that language, and, in cases where the telegraph is resorted to, the telegram is sent in French. 4. A simple correction of address (without modification of the name or description of the addressee) can also be claimed directly from the delivering Office, that is to say, without fulfilling the for malities prescribed for the alteration of address properly so called. 5. Any Administration can require, by notification addressed to the International Bureau, that the exchange of applications,lions, en ce qui la concerne, soil effectue par i’entremise de son Administration centrale on d’nn bureau specialement d6signe. Dans le cas oil I’echange des reclama tions s’effectue par 1’entremise des Administrations centrales, il doit etre tenu compte des demandes expediees directe- ment par les bureaux d’origine aux bureaux de destination, dans ce sens que les correspondances y relatives sont exclues de la distribution jusqu’a I’arrivee de la reclamation de rAdministration centrale. Les Administrations qui usent de la faculte prevue par le premier alinea du present paragraphe prennent a leur charge les frais que peut entrainer la transmis sion, dans leur service interieur, par voie postale on telegraphique, des communica tions a echanger avec le bureau destina- taire. Le recours a la voie telegraphique est obligatoire lorsque l expediteur a lui-meme fait usage de cette voie et que le bureau destinataire ne peut pas etre prevenu en temps utile par la voie postale.

In cases where the exchange of applica tions is effected through the medium of the central Administrations, requests sent directly by the Offices of origin to the Offices of destination must be taken into account to the extent that the correspon dence concerned shall be withheld from delivery until the arrival of the application from the central Administration. Administrations which avail themselves of the option accorded by the first para graph of the present clause bear the charges involved by the transmission, in their inland service, by post or by tele graph, of the communications to be ex changed with the delivering Office. Recourse must be had to the telegraph when the sender has himself used it, and the Office of destination cannot be advised in time by post. XXXII. ' Use of postage stamps presumed to be fraudulent. 1 . Subject to the regulations laid down by the laws of each country, even in cases where the provisions of the present Article do not expressly stipulate for this reserva tion, the undermentioned procedure is followed for reporting the use of fraudu lent postage stamps for the prepayment of postage :— (а) When the presence of a fraudulent postage stamp (counterfeit or already used), on any article whatever, is; detected at the time of despatch by the Post Office of a country whose law does not require the immediate seizure of the article, the stamp is not altered in any way, and the article, enclosed in an envelope addressed to the delivering Office, is forwarded officially registered. (б) This formality is notified without delay to the Administrations of the countries of origin and destination, by means of an advice in conformity with specimen K. annexed to the present Regulations. A copy of that advice is, moreover, transmitted to the delivering Office in the envelope which encloses the article bearing the supposed fraudulent postage stamp.DETAILED REGULATIONS. 65 (c) Le destinataire est convoque pour constater la contravention. La remise de 1’envoi n’a lieu que dans le cas oil le destinataire on son fonde de pouvoirs paye le port du et consent a faire connaitre le nom et 1’adresse de I’expediteur, et a mettre a la disposition de la poste, apres avoir pris connaissance du contenu, Lob jet entier s’il est in separable du corps du debt ou bien la , parti e de bob jet (enveloppe, bande, portion de lettre, etc.) qui contient la suscription et le timbre signale comme frauduleux. (d) Le resultat de la convocation est constate par un proces-verbal con- forme an modele L annexe an pre sent Reglement et oil il est fait mention des incidents survenus tels que non-comparution, refus de rece- voir 1’envoi, de 1’ouvrir ou d’en faire connaitre I’expediteur, etc. Ce docu ment est signe par 1’agent des postes et par le destinataire de 1’envoi on son fonde de pouvoirs ; si ce dernier refuse de signer, le refus est constate aux lieu et place de la signature. Le proces-verbal est transmis, avec pieces a 1’appui, a 1’Administration des postes du pays d’origine, qui, a I’aide de ces documents, fait poursuivre, s’il y a lieu, la repression de 1’infraction d’apres sa legislation interieure. XXXIIL Statistiques dcs frais de transit. 1. Les statistiques a effectuer en exe cution des articles 4 et 17 de la Convention pour le decompte des frais de transit dans rUnion et en dehors des limites de F Union, sont etablies une fois tons les six ans d’apres les dispositions des articles sui- vants, pendant les vingt-huit premiers jours du mois de novembre ou de mai alternativement. La statistique de novembre 1907 s’appliquera aux annees 1908 a 1913 inclu- sivement; la‘ statistique de mai 1913 s’appliquera aux annees 1914 a 1919 inclusivement et ainsi de suite. 2. Dans le cas d’accession a FUnion d’un pays ayant des relations importantes, les pays de FUnion dont la situation pour- rait, par suite de cette circonstance, se trouver modifiee sous le rapport du paye- ment des frais de transit, out la faculte de reclamer une statistique speciale se rapportant exclusivement au pays nou- vellement entre. (c) In order to establish the contraven tion, recourse is had to the addressee. The delivery of the article takes place only if the addressee or his representative pays the charge due and consents to make known the name and address of the sender, and to place at the disposal of the Post Office, after having taken cognisance of the contents, the entire article, if it is inseparable from the offence itself, or else the part of the article (envelope, wrapper, portion of letter, etc.), which contains the address and the stamp stated to be fraudulent. (d) The result of the evidence is set forth in a formal report in conformity with the pattern L annexed to the present Regulations, in which report are recorded the incidents that have happened, such as failure to appear, refusal to receive the article or to open it, or to make known the sender, etc. This document is signed by the postal official and by the ad dressee of the article or his repre sentative ; if the latter refuses to sign, the refusal is recorded in place of the signature. The formal report is transmitted, with the relative vouchers, to the Postal Administration of the country of origin, which, with the aid of those documents, takes proceedings, if necessary, to repress the infringement according to its internal laws. XXXIIL Transit Statistics. 1. The statistics to be taken in execu tion of Articles 4 and 17 of the Convention for the settlement of transit charges within and outside the limits of the Union, are prepared once in every six years according to the stipulations of the following articles, during the first twenty-eight days of the month of November or of May alternately. The statistics of November 1907 will apply to the years 1908 to 1913 inclu sive ; the statistics of May 1913 will apply to the years 1914 to 1919 inclusive, and so on. 2. In the event of the adhesion to the Union of a country having important relations, countries of the Union who might, by reason of that circumstance, find their position modified as regards the payment of transit charges, have the right of demanding special statistics relating exclusively to the country which has lately entered. X 48592. E66 UNIVERSAL POSTAL UNION. 3. Lorsqu’il se produit une modifica tion importante dans ]e mouvement des correspondances et pour autant quo cette modification affecte une periode on des periodes s’elevant a un total d’au moins douzemois,les Offices interesses s’entendent pour regler entre eux, au besoin par la voie d’une nouvelle statistique, le partage des frais de transit proportionnellement a la part d’intervention desdits Offices dans le transport des correspondances auxquelles ces frais se rapportent. XXXIV. Depeches closes. 1. Les correspondances ecliangees en depeches closes, entre deux Offices de FUnion on entre un Office de I’Union et un Office etranger a 1’Union, a travers le territoire ou au moyen des services d’un on de plusieurs autres Offices, font I’objet d’un releve conforme au modele M annexe au present Reglement, qui est etabli d’apres les dispositions suivantes. Pendant chaque periode de statistique des sacs ou des paquets distincts doivent etre employes pour les “lettres et les cartes postales ” et pour les “ autres objets.” Ces sacs ou paquets doivent respectivement etre munis d’une etiquette “ L.C.” et “A.O.” Par derogation aux dispositions de Particle XXIV du present Reglement, chaque Administration a la faculte, pendant la periode de statistique, de comprendre les objets recommandes autres que les lettres et les cartes postales dans un des sacs ou paquets destines aux autres objets, en faisant mention de ce fait sur la feuille d’avis ; mais si, conformement audit article XXIV, ces objets recommandes sont com- pris dans un sac ou paquet a lettres, ils sont traites, en ce qui concerne la statis tique de poids, coniine faisant partie de 1’envoi de lettres. 2. En ce qui concerne les depeches d’un pays de P Union pour un autre pays de P Uni on, le bureau d’echange expediteur inscrit, a la feuille d’avis pour le bureau d’echange destinataire de la depeche, le poids brut des lettres et des cartes postales et celui des autres objets, sans distinction de Porigine ni de la destination des corres pondances. Le poids brut comprend le poids de Pemballage, mais non pas celui des sacs vides emballes dans des sacs distincts. Ces indications sont verifiees par le bureau destinataire, lequel signale immediatement au bureau expediteur, au moyen d’un bulletin de verification, toute erreur dans la declaration de ce bureau ayant pour objet une difference de poids superieure a 50 grammes. 3. When an important modification takes place in the flow of correspondence, and, provided that such modification affects a period or periods amounting to a total of twelve months at least, the Offices con cerned come to an understanding for settling among themselves—if necessary, by means of new statistics—the division of the transit charges in proportion to the part taken by the said Offices in the con veyance of the correspondence to which these charges relate. XXXIV. Closed mails. 1. Correspondence exchanged in closed mails between two Offices of the Union, or between an Office of the Union and one not a party to it, across the territory or by means of the services of one or several other Offices, forms the subject of a state ment in conformity with the pattern M. attached to the present Regulations, which is filled up in accordance with the following stipulations:— During each statistical period separate bags or packets must be made up of “letters and post-cards” and “other articles.” These bags or packets must be provided with a label “L.C.” and “ A.O.” respectively. By way of exception to the stipulations of Article XXIV. of the present Regula tions, each Administration has the option, during the statistical period, of enclosing registered articles other than letters or post cards in one of the bags or packets intended for other articles, mentioning this fact on the letter bill ; but if, in con formity with the said Article XXIV., these registered articles are enclosed in a bag or packet of letters, they are treated, so far as the weight statistics are concerned, .as forming part of the letter correspondence. 2. As regards mails from one Union country for another Union country, the despatching office of Exchange enters, on the letter bill for the Exchange office of destination the gross weight of the letters and post-cards and that of the other articles, without distinction of the origin or destination of the correspondence. The gross weight includes the weight of the packing, but not that of empty bags packed in separate sacks. These entries are checked by the office of destination, which immediately informs the office of origin, by means of a verification note, of any error in the statement of that office, amounting to a difference in weight of more than 50 grammes.DETAILED REGULATIONS. 67 3. Aussitot que possible apres la cloture des operations de statistique, les bureaux destinataires dressent les releves (modele M) en autant d’expeditions qu’il y a d’Offices interesses, y compris celui du lieu X de depart. Ces releves sont transmis par les bureaux d’echange qui les ont etabli aux bureaux dechange de TOffice debiteur pour etre revetus de leur acceptation. Ceux-ci, apres avoir accepte ces releves, les transmettent a FAdministration centrale dont ils relevent, chargee de les repartir entre les Offices interesses. 4. En ce qui concerne les depeches closes echangees entre un pays de FUnion et un pays etranger a FUnion, par Finter- mediaire d’un ou de plusieurs Offices de F Union, les bureaux d’echange du pays de FUnion dressent, pour les depeches ex pedites ou regues, un releve (modele M) qu’ils transmettent a FOffice de sortie ou d’entree, lequel etablit, a la fin de la periode de statistique, un releve general en autant d’expeditions qu’il y a d’Offices interesses, y compris lui-meme et FOffice de FUnion debiteur. Une expedition de ce releve est transmise a FOffice debiteur, ainsi qu’a chacun des Offices qui ont pris part au transport des depeches. 5. Apres chaque periode de statistique, les Administrations qui ont expedie des depeches en transit envoient la liste de ces depeches aux differentes Administrations dont elles ont emprunte Fintermediaire. 6 . Le simple entrepot, dans un port, de depeches closes apportees par un paquebot et destinees a etre reprises par un autre paquebot, ne donne pas lieu au payement de frais de transit territorial au profit de FOffice des postes du lieu d’entrepot. 7. II incombe aux Administrations des pays dont relevent les batiments de guerre de dresser les releves (modele M) relatifs aux depeches expediees ou regues par ces batiments. Ces depeches doivent, pendant la periode de statistique, porter sur des etiquettes, les indications suivantes : (a) la nature du contenu et le poids brut, d’apres les dispositions du § 1 du present article ; (b) la route suivie ou a suivre. Dans le cas ou une depeche a Fadresse d’un batiment de guerre est reexpediee pendant la periode de statistique, FOffice reexpediteur en informe FOffice du pays dont le batiment releve. 3. As soon as possible after the con clusion of the statistical operations, the offices of destination prepare the state ments (pattern M) making out as many copies as there are Offices concerned, in cluding that of the place of despatch. These statements are forwarded by the offices of Exchange which have prepared them to the offices of Exchange of the debtor Office for acceptance by signature. These offices, after having accepted the statements forward them to the central Administration to which they are subordi nate for distribution among the Offices concerned. 4. As regards closed mails exchanged between a Union country and a country outside the Union, through the medium of one or several Union Offices, the offices of exchange of the Union country prepare, in respect of the mails sent or received, a statement (pattern M) which they forward to the Office of exit or entry, and that Office prepares, at the end of the statistical period, a general statement in as many copies as there are Offices concerned, in cluding itself and the debtor Union Office. A copy of this statement is forwarded to the debtor Office, as well as to each of the Offices which have taken part in the conveyance of the mails. 5. After each statistical period, the Administrations which have despatched mails in transit send the list of such mails to the different Administrations whose services they have made use of. 6 . The mere warehousing at a port of closed mails brought by one packet and intended to go on by another does not give rise to the payment of territorial transit charges to the Post Office of the place where the mails are warehoused. 7. It is incumbent on the Administra tions of countries to which ships of war belong, to prepare statements (pattern il/), relative to the mails sent or received by such ships. These mails must, during the statistical period, bear on the labels the following indications:— (a) the nature of the contents, and the gross weight, according to the stipulations of § 1 of the present T . “ ' article ; (b) the route followed or to be followed. In the event of a mail addressed to a ship of war being re-forwarded during the statistical period, the re-directing Office notifies the fact to the Office of the country to which the ship belongs. E 268 UNIVERSAL POSTAL UNION. XXXV. Correspondanccs d decouvcrt. 1. Los correspondances ordinaires et recommaudees ainsi que les lettres de valeur declaree transmises a deconvert pendant une periode de statistique font 1’objet d’une inscription sur la feuille d’avis, par le bureau d’echange expediteur redigee coniine suit:— Correspondances a decouvert. Nombre. Lettres ....... Carles postales. ..... Autres objets ...... Les correspondances exemptes de tons frais de transit conformement aux dispo sitions du § 8 de I’article 4 de la Convention ne sont pas comprises dans ces cliiffres. 2. Le bureau d’echange correspondant, apres verification de I’inscription sur la feuille d’avis, prend livraison des corres pondances, pour les acheminer vers leurs destinations en les confondant avec les siennes propres. 3. Toute erreur dans la declaration du bureau d’echange expediteur est signalee immediatement a ce bureau au moyen d’un bulletin de verification. 4. A defaut de correspondances a decouvert, le bureau expediteur inscrit en tete de la feuille d’avis la mention : “ Pas de correspondances a decouvert.” XXXVI. Compte des frais de transit. 1. Les nombres des correspondances transmises a decouvert et les poids des depeches closes multiplies tons deux par 13 servent de base a des comptes particu- liers etablissant en francs et centimes les prix annuels de transit revenant a chaque Office. Dans le cas oil ce multiplicateur ne se rapporte pas a la periodicite du service, ou lorsqu’il s’agit d’expeditions extraordinaires faites pendant la periode de statistique, les Administrations inte- ressees s’entendent pour 1 adoption d un autre multiplicateur. Le soin d’etablir les comptes incombe a I’Office crediteur, qui les transmet a 1’Office debiteur. Le mul tiplicateur admis fait chaque fois regie pour les 6 annees d’une meme periode de statistique. 2. Afin de tenir compte du poids des sacs et de I’emballage et des categories de correspondances exemptes de to us frais de XXXV. Correspondence sent a decouvert. 1. Ordinary and registered correspon dence as well as insured letters forwarded d decouvert during a statistical period form the subject of an entry on the letter bill, by the despatching office of exchange in the following manner :— Correspondence d deaniKcrt. Number. Letters ....... Post-cards ..... Other articles ...... Correspondence exempt from all transit charges in accordance with the stipulations of § 8 of Article 4 of the Convention is not included in these figures. 2. The corresponding office of exchange, after verification of the entry on the letter bill, takes over the correspondence for despatch to destination among its own correspondence. 3. Every error in the statement of the despatching office of exchange is reported immediately to that office by means of a verification note. 4. When no correspondence is sent d decouvert, the despatching office enters at the head of the letter bill, the remark : “ Pas de correspondances a decouvert ” (No correspondence d decouvert). XXXVI. Accounting for transit charges. 1. The number of articles forwarded a decouvert and the weight of the closed mails, both multiplied by 13, serve as the basis of special accounts determining- in francs and centimes the yearly transit payments due to each Office. In cases where this multiplier does not correspond to the periodicity of the service, or when it is a question of extraordinary despatches made during the statistical period, the Admi nistrations concerned come to an agreement for the adoption of another multiplier. The duty of preparing the account devolves on the creditor Office, which forwards them to the debtor Office. The multiplier agreed on holds good in each case for the 6 years of the same statistical period. 2. In order to take into account the weight of the sacks and packing and of the classes of correspondence exempt fromDETAILED REGULATIONS. 69 transit en conformity des dispositions du § 8 de 1’article 4 de la Convention, le montant total du compte des depech.es closes est reduit de 10 pour cent. 3. Les cornptes particuliers sont d resses, en double expedition, autant que possible en conformite des modeles N, 0, et P annexes au present Reglement. 4. L’etablissement et I’envoi des comptes particuliers doivent etre effectues dans le plus href delai possible et, au plus tard, avant Fexpiration de I’annee qui suit I’annee de la statistique. En tons cas si 1’Office qui a envoye le compte n’a regu aucune observation recti- ficative dans un intervalle de 6 mois a compter de 1’envoi, ce compte est con- sidere comme admis de plein droit. 5. Sauf entente contraire entre les Administrations interessees, le decompte general comprenant les frais de transit territorial et maritime est etabli par le Bureau international. 6 . Dans ce but, aussitot que les comptes particuliers reciproques entre deux Administrations auront ete etablis, un releve (modele Q) indiquant les montants totaux de ces comptes est dresse par chacune des deux Administrations et transmis par celles-ci sans aucun retard, et au plus tard avant I’expiration de la deuxieme annee qui suit I’annee de la statistique, au Bureau international. Dans le cas ou Tune des Administrations n’aurait pas found dedications dans le delai fixe ci-dessus, les indications de 1’autre Administration font foi. Dans le cas oil deux Administrations se seraient mises d’accord pour faire un reglement special, le releve portera la mention “Compte regie a part — a titre d’information ” et ne sera pas compris dans le decompte general. En cas de difference entre les indications correspondantes de deux Administrations, le Bureau international les invite a se mettre d’accord et a lui communiquer les sommes definitivement fixees. Dans le cas du § 4, 2 e alinea du present article, les releves doivent porter la mention “ Aucune observation de 1’Office debiteur n’est parvenue dans le delai reglementaire.” 7. Le Bureau international effectue les suppressions prevues dans I’article 4, § 9, de la Convention principale et en donne avis aux Offices interesses. A 48592. all transit charges in conformity with the stipulations of § 8 of Article 4 of the Con vention, the total amount of the account for closed mails is reduced by 10 per cent. 3. The detailed accounts are prepared, in duplicate, as nearly as possible in con formity with patterns N, 0, and P attached to the present regulations. 4. The preparation and despatch of the detailed accounts should be effected with as little delay as possible, and, at the latest, before the expiration of the year following the statistical year. In any case, if the Office which has sent the account has received no notice of amendments within an interval of 6 months, reckoning from the date of despatch, the account is regarded as fully accepted. 5. In the absence of any understanding to the contrary between the Administra tions concerned, the general liquidation account, including the territorial and sea transit charges, is prepared by the Inter national Bureau. G. With this object, as soon as the reciprocal detailed accounts between two Administrations have been prepared, a statement (pattern Q), showing the total amounts of these accounts is prepared by each of the two Administrations and for- warded by them without delay, and at the latest before the expiration of the second year following the statistical year, to the International Bureau. In the event of one of the Administra tions not having furnished items in the time fixed above, the items of the other Administrations hold good. In the event of two Administrations having agreed between themselves to effect a special settlement the statement shall bear the inscription “ Compte regie a part —a titre d’information ” (Account settled separately—for purposes of information) and shall not be included in the general account. In case of difference between the corre sponding items of two Administrations, the International Bureau invites them to come to an agreement, and to communicate to it the sums definitely fixed. In the case provided for in § 4, section 2, of the present Article, the statements should bear the indication “Aucune observation de Toffice debiteur n’est parvenue dans le delai reglementaire ” (No comment has been received from the debtor Office within the prescribed period). 7. The International Bureau effects the suppressions provided for in Article 4, § 9, of the Principal Convention, and notifies the same to the Offices concerned. E 370 UNIVERSAL POSTAL UNION. 8. A la fin du premier trimestre de Fannee 1909 et de chaque annee suivante, le Bureau international reunit, dans un decompte annuel des frais de transit, les releves qui lui sont parvenus jusque-la. Ce decompte indique: (а) Le total du Doit et de FAvoir de cliaque Administration ; (б) Le solde debiteur ou le solde credi- teur decliaque Administration repre- sentant la difference entre le total du Doit et le total de FAvoir ; (c) Les sommes a payer par les Administrations debitrices ; (d) Les sommes a receyoir par les Administrations creditrices. Les totaux des deux categories des soldes sous les lettres (a) a (d) doivent necessairement etre egaux. Le Bureau international pourvoira a ce que le nombre des payements a effectuer par les Administrations debitrices soit restreint dans la mesure du possible. 9. Les decomptes annuels doivent etre transmis aux Administrations de F Union par le Bureau international, dans le plus bref delai possible. XXXVII. Liquidation des frais de transit. 1. Le solde annuel resultant du decompte du Bureau international est paye par FOffice debiteur a FOffice credi- teur an moyen de traites. Si F Office crediteur a le franc pour unite mone- taire, les traites sont tirees en francs effectifs sur une place du pays crediteur an gre de FOffice debiteur. Si FOffice crediteur n’a pas le franc pour unite monetaire, les traites sont tirees au gre de FOffice debiteur soit en francs effectifs sur Paris ou sur une place du pays crediteur, soit dans la monnaie du pays crediteur et sur une place de ce pays ; dans ce dernier cas, les Offices interesses s’entendent sur la maniere de proceder et, le cas echeant, sur le taux de conversion du solde du en monnaie mctallique du pays crediteur. Les frais de payement sont supportes par FOffice debiteur. 2. Le payement du solde annuel doit etre effectue dans le plus bref delai possible, et, an plus tard, avant Fexpiration d’un delai de 3 mois apres reception du decompte pour les pays d’Europe et de 4 mois pour les autres pays. Passe ce delai, les sommes dues par un Office a un autre Office sont productives d’interets, a raison de 5 pour cent Fan et a dater du jour d’expiration dudit delai. 8. At the end of the first quarter of the year 1909 and of each following year, the International Bureau combines in an annual liquidation account of transit charges the statements which have reached it up to that time. This account shows : (a) The total Debit and Credit of each Administration : (b) The debit balance or the credit balance of each Administration, representing the difference between the total of the Debit and the total of the Credit; (c) The sums to be paid by the Debtor Administrations ; (d) The smns to be received by the Creditor Administrations. The totals of the two classes of balances under the letters (a) to (d) must necessarily be equal. The International Bureau shall arrange for the number of payments to be made by the Debtor Administrations to be reduced so far as practicable. 9. The annual liquidation accounts are to be forwarded by the International Bureau to the Administrations of the Union as early as possible. XXXVII. Settlement of transit charges. 1. The annual balance resulting from the liquidation account of the International Bureau is paid by the Debtor Office to the Creditor Office by means of drafts. If the Creditor Office has the franc for its monetary unit, the drafts are drawn in effective francs on a place in the Creditor country at the option of the Debtor Office. If the Creditor Office has not the franc for its monetary unit, the drafts are drawn at the option of the Debtor Office either in hard cash (francs) on Paris or on a place in the Creditor country or else in the money of the Creditor country and on a place in that country; in the latter case the Offices interested agree upon the course to be followed and, if necessary, on the rate of conversion of the balance due into the metallic currency of the Creditor country. The costs of payment are borne by the Debtor Office. 2. The payment of the annual balance must be made with as little delay as possible and at latest before the expiration of a period of 3 months after the receipt of the liquidation account in the case of countries in Europe and of 4 months in the case of other countries. If this period is exceeded the sums due by one Office to another Office are chargeable with interest, at the rate of 5 per cent, per annum, from the date of the expiration of the period of grace mentioned.72 UNIVERSAL POSTAL UNION. 5 e classe: Argentine (R£publiqne), Bosnie-Herzegcvine, Bulgarie, Chili, Colombie, Grece, ^lexique, Perou, Serbie, Tunisie ; 6 C classe : Bolivie, Costa-Pica, Cuba, Republique Dominicaine, Equateur, Guatemala, Haiti, Republique de Honduras, Luxembourg, Republique de Nicaragua, Republique de Pana ma, Paraguay, Perse, Republique de Salvador, Royamne de Siam, Uruguay, Venezuela, protectorats allemands de 1’Afrique, protectorats allemands de I’Asie et de I’Austra- lasie, colonies danoises, colonie de Curasao (on Antilles neerlandaises), colonie de Surinam (on Guyane neerlandaise); V classe: Etat independant du Congo, Coree, Crete, - etablissements espagnols du golfe de_ Guinee, ensemble des colonies italiennes, Liberia, Montenegro. 5th class : Argentine Republic, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Chili, Colombia, Greece, Mexico, Peru, Servia, Tunis ; 6th class : Bolivia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Hayti, Republic of Hon duras, Luxemburg, Republic of Nicaragua, Republic of Panama, Paraguay, Persia, Republic of Sal vador, Kingdom of Siam, Uruguay, Venezuela, German Protectorates in Africa, German Protectorates in Asia and Australasia, Danish Colonies, Colony of Curasao (or Dutch West Indies), Colony of Surinam (or Dutch Guiana). 7th class : Congo Free State, Corea, Crete, Spanish Establishments in the Gulf of Guinea, the whole of the Italian Colonies, Liberia, Montenegro.

This list must show separately the articles in question according to the mode of conveyance, namely : (a) by “ letter post ” (letters, printed papers, samples) ; (b) by “parcel post” (in rela tions between participating or non - participating coun tries) ; and (c) optionally under another form (by the medium of postal administrations or of other carrying agencies). 3. Every modification subsequently introduced, in regard to one or other of the five points above mentioned, must be notified without delay in the same manner. 4. The International Bureau receives besides from all the Administrations of the Union two copies of all the documents which they publish, whether relating to the inland service or to the international service. XL. General Statistics. 1. Every Administration sends to the International Bureau, at the end of the month of July in each year, as complete a series as possible of statistical returns relating to the preceding year, arranged in tables in conformity with or analagous to the patterns R and S annexed. 2. Those cervices in which each trans action is recorded are dealt with in periodical statements based upon the entries made. 3. With regard to all other transactions, every year a count is made in bulk of correspondence of all kinds without dis tinction between letters, post cards, printed papers, commercial papers and samples of merchandise, and every three years, at latest, a count of the different classes of correspondence. The statistics are taken for daily ex changes during one week, from the second Thursday of October, and for exchanges74 UNIVERSAL POSTAL UNION. d’octobre et pour les echanges non quoti- diens pendant quatre semaines a partir du premier du meme mois. Dans I’intervalle qni s’ecoule entre les statistiques speciales, le denombrement des differentes categories est fait d’apres des chiffres proportionnels tires de la precedente statistique speciale. 4. Le Bureau international est charge de faire imprimer et de distribuer les formules de statistique a remplir par chaque Administration. II est charge, en outre, de fournir aux Administrations qui en feront la demande toutes les indications necessaires sur les regies a suivre pour assurer, autant que possible, Fimiformite des operations de statistique. XLI. Attributions du Bureau international. 1. Le Bureau international dresse une statistique generale pour chaque annee. 2. II redige, a 1’aide des documents qui sont mis a sa disposition, un journal special en langues allemande, anglaise et frangaise. 3. Le Bureau international public, d’apres les informations fournies en vertu des prescriptions de 1’article XXXIX pre cedent, un recueil officiel de tons les renseignements d’interet general concer- nant 1’execution de la Convention et du present Reglement dans chaque pays de i’Union. Les modifications ulterieures sont publiees par supplements semestriels. Toutefois, daus les cas d’urgence, lors- qu’une Administration demande expres- sement la publication immediate d’un changement qui s’est produit dans son service, le Bureau international en fait 1’objet d’une circulaire speciale. Des recueils analogues concernant 1’execution des Arrangements speciaux de 1’Union peuvent etre publics par le Bureau international sur la demande des Admini strations participant a ces Arrangements. 4. Tous les documents publics par le Bureau international sont distribues aux Administrations de 1’Union dans la pro portion du nombre d’unites contributives assignees a chacune d’elles par 1’article XXXVIII precedent. 5. Les exemplaires et documents sup- plementaires qui seraient reclames par ces Administrations sont payes a part, d’apres leur prix de revient. 6. Le Bureau international doit, d’ail- leurs, se tenir en tout temps a la dis position des membres de 1’Union, pour leur fournir, sur les questions relatives au service international des postes, les ren seignements speciaux dont ils pourraient avoir besoin. not daily during four weeks from the first of the same month. In the interval which elapses between the special statistics the estimate of the different classes is made on the basis of the proportionate figures derived from the preceding special statistics. 4. To the International Bureau is en trusted the duty of printing and distri buting the statistical forms to be filled up by each Administration, and of furnishing to any Administrations on application ail necessary information as to the rules to be followed, in order to ensure, as far as possible, uniformity of practice in taking the statistics. XLI. Duties of the International Bureau. 1. The International Bureau prepares general statistics for each year. 2. It publishes, by the aid of the docu ments which are put at its disposal, a special journal in the German, English and French languages. 3. The International Bureau publishes, in accordance with information furnished in virtue of the stipulations of the fore going article XXXIX. an official summary of all the notifications of general interest concerning the execution of the Convention and the present Regulations in each country of the Union. Subsequent modifications are made known by means of half-yearly supplements. In urgent cases, however, when an Administration expressly demands the immediate publication of a change brought about in its service, the Inter national Bureau makes it the subject of a special circular. Similar summaries concerning the execution of the special arrangements of the Union may be published by the Inter national Bureau at the request of the Administrations participating in those arrangements. 4. All the documents published by the International Bureau are distributed to the Administrations of the Union, in the pro portion of the number of contributing units assigned to each by the foregoing Article XXXVIII. 5. Any additional copies and docu ments which may be applied for by these Administrations are paid for separately at prime cost. G. The International Bureau must moreover hold itself always at the disposal of members of the Union for the purpose of furnishing them with any special in formation they may require upon questions relating to the international postal service.DETAILED REGULATIONS. 75 7.

Le Bureau international de F Union postale universelle est charge d’operer la balance et la liquidation des decomptes de toute nature relatifs au service ^ interna tional des postes entre les Administrations XLII. Central office of accounting and liquidation of accounts between the Administra tions of the Union. 1. It is the duty of the International Bureau of the Universal Postal Union to effect the balance and liquidation of accounts of every description relative to the international postal service between76 UNIVERSAL POSTAL UNION. des pays de 1'Union qui ont le franc pour unite monetaire on qni se sont mises d’accord sur le taux de conversion de leur monnaie en francs et centimes metalliques. Les Administrations qui ont Tinten- tion de reclamer, pour ce service de liquidation, le concours du Bureau inter national, se concertent, a cet elfet, entre elles et avec ce Bureau. Malgre son adhesion, chaque Admini stration conserve le droit d’etablir a son choix des decomp tes speciaux pour diverses branches du service et d’en operer a sa convenance le reglement avec ses correspondants, sans employer I’inter- mediaire du Bureau international, auquel, a teneur de I’alinea qui precede, elle se borne a indiquer pour quelles branches de service et pour quels pays elle reclame ses offices. Sur la demande des Administrations interessees, les decomptes telegraphiques peuvent aussi etre indiques au Bureau international pour entrer dans la compen sation des soldes. Les Administrations qui auront em- prunte I’intermediaire du Bureau inter national pour la balance et la liquidation des decomptes peuvent cesser d’user de cet intermediaire trois mois apres qu’elles en auront averti ledit Bureau. 2 . Apres que les comptes particuliers ont ete debattus et arretes d’un commun accord, les Administrations debitrices transmettent aux Administrations credi- trices, pour chaque nature d’operations, une reconnaissance, etablie en francs et centimes, du montant de la balance des deux comptes particidiers, avec 1’indica- tion de Fobjet de la creance et de la periode a laquelle elle se rapporte. Toutefois, en ce qui concerne Fechange des mandats, la reconnaissance doit etre transmise par FOffice debiteur des Fetablissement de son propre compte particulier et la reception du compte particulier de FOffice eorrespondant, sans attendre qu’il ait ete precede a la verifi cation de detail. Les differences ulterieu- rement constatees sont reprises dans le premier compte a intervenir. Sauf entente contraire, FAdministra- tion qui desirerait, pour sa comptabilite interieure, avoir des comptes generaux, aurait a les etablir elle-meme et a les soumettre a Facceptation de FAdmini- stration correspondante. Les Administrations peuvent s’entendro pour pratiquer un autre systeme dans leurs relations. Administrations of countries of the Union which have the franc for their monetary unit, or which are agreed on the rate of conversion of their money into francs and centimes (specie). The Administrations which intend to claim for this service of liquidation the assistance of the International Bureau, arrange accordingly with each other and with the Bureau. Notwithstanding its adhesion, each Administration retains the right of pre paring at will special accounts for different branches of the service, and of effecting the settlement of them at its own convenience with the corresponding Administrations, without employing the medium of the International Bureau, to which, according to the tenor of the preceding paragraph, it merely indicates for what branches of the service and in respect of what countries it applies for the help of the Bureau. At the request of the Administrations concerned, telegraph accounts can also be notified to the International Bureau to be included in the setting-off of balances. Administrations which have used the medium of the International Bureau for the balancing and liquidation of accounts may cease to use that medium three months after giving notice to the said Bureau to that effect. 2. After the detailed accounts have been checked and agreed upon, the Debtor Administrations transmit to the Creditor Administrations, for each class of opera tions, an acknowledgment made out in francs and centimes, of the amount of the balance] of the two detailed accounts, indicating the object of the credit and the period to which it relates. As regards money order business, however, the acknowledgment must be transmitted by the Debtor Office as soon as it has prepared its own detailed account, and has received the detailed account of the corresponding Office, without waiting for verification of details. The discrepancies subsequently brought to light are adjusted in the first account which offers. In the absence of any understanding to the contrary, an Administration desiring for its own accounting purposes, to have general accounts, has to prepare them itself and to submit them to the corresponding Administration for acceptance. Administrations may come to an understanding for the adoption of another system in their relations.DETAILED REGULATIONS. '77 3. Cliaque Administration adresse mensuellement ou trimestriellement, si des circonstances speciales le rendent desi rable, au Bureau international, un tableau indiquant son Avoir du chef des decomptes particuliers, ainsi que le total des sommes dont elle est creditrice envers chacune des Administrations contractantes ; chaque creance figurant dans ce tableau doit etre justifiee par une reconnaissance de 1’Office debiteur. Ce tableau doit parvenir au Bureau international le 19 de chaque mois ou du premier mois de chaque trimestre au plus tard, sous peine de n’etre compris que dans la liquidation du mois ou du tri mestre suivant. 4. Le Bureau international constate, en rapprochant les reconnaissances, si les tableaux sont exacts. Toute rectifica tion necessaire est notifiee aux Offices interesses. Le Doit de chaque Administration envers une autre est reporte dans un tableau r6capitulatif; afin d’etablir le total dont chaque Administration est debitrice, il suffit d’additionner les diverses colonnes de ce tableau recapitulatif. 5. Le Bureau international reunit les tableaux et les recapitulations en une balance generate indiquant: (a) le total du Doit et de 1’Avoir de chaque Administration ; (b) le solde debiteur ou le solde cre- diteur de chaque Administration, representant la difference entre le total du Doit et le total de 1’Avoir; (c) les sommes a payer par une partie des membres de T Union a une Ad ministration, ou reciproquement les sommes a payer par cette derniere a 1’autre partie. Les totaux des deux categories de soldes sous (a) et (b) doivent necessaire- ment etre egaux. On pourvoira autant que possible a ce que chaque Administration n’ait a effectuer, pour se liberer, qu’un ou deux payements distincts. Toutefois, FAdministration qui se trouve habituellerpent a decouvert vis-a-vis d’une autre Administration pour une somme superieure a 50,000 francs a le droit de reclamer des acomptes. Ces acomptes sont inscrits, tant par 1’Administration creditrice que par 1’Ad ministration debitrice, au bas des tableaux a adresser au Bureau International (voir §3). G. Les reconnaissances (voir § 3) trans- mises au Bureau international avec les tableaux sont classees par Administration. 3. Each Administration addresses monthly or quarterly, if special circum stances render it desirable, to the Inter national Bureau a table showing the total Credit due to it on the individual accounts, as well as the total of the sums which are due to it from each of the con tracting Administrations; each credit appearing in this table must be substan tiated by an acknowledgment from the indebted Office. This table should reach the Interna tional Bureau not later than the 19th of each month or of the first month of each quarter, otherwise its liquidation is liable to be deferred until the month or the quarter following. 4. The International Bureau ascertains, by comparing the acknowledgments, if the tables are correct. Every correction that is necessary is notified to the Offices concerned. The Debit of each Administration to another is carried forward into a summary ; and in order to arrive at the total amount owing by each Administration, it suffices to add up the different columns of this summary. 5. The International Bureau combines the tables and the summaries in one general balance sheet showing: (а) The total of the Debit and of the Credit of each Administration ; (б) The balance against or in favour of each Administration, representing the difference between the total of the Debit and the total of the Credit; (c) The sums to be paid by some of the members of the Union to a single Administration, or, recipro cally, the sums to be paid by the latter to the former. The totals of the two categories of balances under a and b must of necessity be equal. It shall be arranged, as far as possible, that each Administration, in order to liquidate its debts, shall have to make only one or two distinct payments. Nevertheless, an Administration which habitually finds a sum exceeding 50,000 francs due to it from another Administra tion has the right to claim remittances on account. These remittances on account are entered, both by the creditor Administra tion and by the debtor Administration, at the foot of the tables to be forwarded to the International Bureau (see § 3). 6. The acknowledgments (see § 3) transmitted to the International Bureau with the tables are classified according to the different Administrations.78 UNIVERSAL POSTAL UNION. Elies servent de base pour 1’etablisse- ment de la liquidation de chacune des Administrations interessees. Dans cette liquidation doivent figurer: (а) les sommes afferentes aux decomptes speciaux portant sur les divers echanges; (б) le total des sommes resultant de tons les decomptes speciaux par rapport a chacune des Administra tions interessees; (c) les totaux des sommes dues a toutes les Administrations creditrices pour chaque branche du service, ainsi que leur total general. Ce total doit etre egal au total du Doit qui figure dans la recapitulation. Au bas de la liquidation, la balance est etablie entre le total du Doit et le total de I’Avoir resultant des tableaux adresses par les Administrations au Bureau inter national (voir § 3). Le montant net du Doit on de TAvoir doit etre egal au solde debiteur ou au solde crediteur porte dans la balance generale. En outre, la liquida tion statue sur le mode de liquidation, c’est-a-dire qu’elle] indique les Admini strations en faveur desquelles le payement doit etre effectue par 1’Administration debi trice. Les liquidations doivent etre trans- mises aux Administrations interessees, par le Bureau international, au plus tard le 22 de chaque mois. 7. Le payement des sommes dues, en vertu d’une liquidation, par une Admini stration a une autre Administration, doit etre effectue aussitot que possible et au plus tard quinze jours apres reception de la liquidation par 1’Administration debitrice. Quant aux autres conditions de payement, les dispositions du § 1 de 1’article XXXVII precedent font loi. Les dispositions du § 2 dudit article sont, le cas echeant, applicables en cas de non- payement du solde dans le delai fixe. Les soldes debiteurs ou crediteurs n’excedant pas 500 francs pen vent etre reportes a la liquidation du mois suivant, a la condition toutefois que les Admini strations interessees soient en rapport mensuel avec le Bureau international. II est fait mention de ce report dans les recapitulations et dans les liquidations pour les Administrations creditrices et debitrices. L’Administration debitrice fait parvenir, le cas echeant, a 1’Admini- stration creditrice, une reconnaissance de la somme due, pour etre portee au prochain tableau. They serve as the basis for settling the accounts of each of the Administrations concerned. In this settlement there should appear: (a) The sums relating to the special accounts concerning the different 'S exchanges ; (b) The total of the sums resulting from all the special accounts with respect to each of the Administrations concerned. (c) The totals of the sums due to all the Creditor Administrations on account of each branch of the service, as well as their general total. This total should be equal to the total of the Debit which appears in the summary. At the foot of the liquidation account, the balance is prepared between the total of the Debit and the total of the Credit resulting from the tables forwarded by the Administrations to the International Bureau (see § 3). The net amount of the Debit or of the Credit should be equal to the debit balance or to the credit balance carried into the general balance sheet. Moreover, the liquidation account deter mines the manner of settlement, that is to say, it indicates the Administrations to which payment must be made by the Administration indebted. The liquidation accounts must be trans mitted to the Administrations interested by the International Bureau not later than the 22nd of each month. 7. Payment of the sums due, in virtue of a liquidation account, from one Ad ministration to another, must be effected as soon as possible and at the latest a fortnight after receipt of the liquidation account by the debtor Administration. As regards other conditions of payment the stipulations of § 1 *of the preceding Article XXXVII hold good. The stipula tions of § 2 of the said article are, if the case arise, applicable in case of non payment of the balance within the fixed period. Debit or credit balances not exceeding 500 francs can be carried forward to the settlement of the following month, pro vided, however, that the Administrations concerned are in monthly communication with the International Bureau. The amount brought forward is entered in the summaries and in the liquidation accounts for the Creditor and DebtorAdministrations. The Debtor Administration furnishes, in such case, to the Creditor Administration an acknowledgment of the sum due, to be carried into the next table.80 UNIVERSAL POSTAL UNION. 10° la Republique de Saint-Marin et le bureau italien de Tripoli de Bar baric, comme relevant de 1’Ad ministration des postes dTtalie; 11° les bureaux de poste que 1’Admini stration japonaise a etablis en Chine; 12° le Grand-Duche de Finlande, comme faisant partie integrante le FEm pire de Russie, les bureaux de poste russes etablis en Chine, comme relevant de FAdministra- tion des postes de Russie; 13° Basutoland, comme relevant de FAdministration des postes de la colonie du Cap de Bonne-Espe- rance ; 14° Walfisch-Bay, comme faisant partie de la colonie du Cap de Bonne- Esperance ; 15° le bureau de poste norvegien etabli dans FAdvent Bay, a F Guest du Spitzberg, comme relevant de FAdministration des postes de Norvege. 2.

XLV. Proposals made in the interval between meetings. 1. In the interval which elapses between the meetings the Postal Administration of every country of the Union has the right of addressing to the other participating Administrations, through the medium of the International Bureau, proposals con cerning the present Regulations. 2. Every proposal is subject to the following procedure :— A period of six months is allowed to Administrations to examine the proposals and communicate their observations, if any, to the International Bureau. Amend ments are not admitted. The answers are tabulated by the International Bureau and communicated to the Administrations with an invitation to express themselves for or against. The Administrations which have not declared their votes within a period of six months, counting from the date of the second circular of the International Bureau notifying to them the observations made, are regarded as abstaining.INDEX.

Pagination: an original printed pagination sequence is present between ff 160-224.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The volume comprises copies of printed correspondence, handwritten correspondence, notes and other papers. This relates to the operation of British Indian post offices in Persia, and in particular in the region known as Arabistan [Ahvāz] by British officials. The file is a direct chronological continuation of File 1912/897 Pt 1 ‘Persian Gulf. British post offices [also in Turkish Arabia]’ (IOR/L/PS/10/242). Principal correspondents in the volume include: HM Minister in Tehran (Sir Charles Murray Marling); India Office staff (John Evelyn Shuckburgh; Arthur Hirtzel); the Deputy Chief Political Officer at Basra (Captain Arnold Talbot Wilson); the Chief Political Officer at Basra (Sir Percy Zachariah Cox); and the Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Major Stuart George Knox).Subjects covered in the volume include:a printed copy of the Convention of Rome (dated 26 May 1906), created by the Universal Postal Union, incorporating detailed regulations for its execution, in French and English, printed in 1907 by HM Stationery Office (ff 160-224);office notes relating to protests from the Persian Government at the opening of Government of India post offices at Henjam [Jazīreh-ye Hengām] and Charbar [Chābahār], and the anticipated post office at Ahwaz [Ahvāz] (ff 153-159);a copy of a letter from Knox to Sir Walter Beaupré Townley, HM Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of Persia, dated 21 June 1914, countering complaints made by the Persian Government about British Indian postal service activities in southern Persia, by pointing out the perceived inadequacies in the Persian postal system (ff 130-133);complaints made by HM Consul at Kerman (Lieutenant-Colonel David Lockhart Robertson Lorimer), of deficiencies in the existing Persian postal service at Kerman. The Consul emphasises insecurities and delays on routes to Bandar Abbas [Bandar-e ʻAbbās] and Tehran, the inefficiency of staff, and the importance of the service to Kerman’s European community (ff 135-136, ff 77-78);a memorandum written by Wilson to Cox, dated 21 July 1917, giving a detailed account of the prevailing political situation (including Anglo-Persian relations) in Northern Arabistan (ff 41-44);the proposal, put forward by Cox in 1916, to open a British Indian post office at the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s (APOC) concession at Maidan-i-Naphtum [Meydān-e Naftūn]. It provokes much discussion between British officials in the Gulf, Government of India officials, and officials from the India Office and the Foreign Office, chiefly relating to the likely response of the Persian authorities to such a move, and whether the move could be justified. A useful précis of the differing opinions of officials involved in making the decision can be found at ff 14-18.Each part includes a divider which gives the subject and part numbers, the year the subject file was opened, the subject heading, and a list of correspondence references contained in that part by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Mesopotamia Expeditionary Force, Chief Political Officer</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Mesopotamia Expeditionary Force, Deputy Chief Political Officer</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Universal Postal Union</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Consul, Tehran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Consul, Kerman</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Ahwaz</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Maidan-i-Naphtum</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Kerman</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Postal services</topic></subject><subject><topic>First World War (1914-1918)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Imperialism</topic></subject><subject><topic>Oilfields</topic></subject><subject><topic>Petroleum industry</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000088#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
