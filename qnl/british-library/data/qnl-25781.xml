I notice, incidentally, that you simply address them M Forminka” which means that they issue as telegrams addressed by the Foreign Office to Kabul repeated to the Government of India. To turn them into telegrams from the India Office to the Government of India, repeated to Kabul, it is necessary to give them a suitable introduction such as ’’addressed by Secretary of State for India to Government of India, repeated to Kabul In view of Sir F. Vfyiie’s telegram I suggest that these Intels should in future go simply to the Government of India who can be left to send copies on to Kabul by mail. Sir F.
