Sir, I am directed by J r. secretary .ac^onald to acknowledge the receipt of your letter r.10^62/5666/260 of the 12th October regarding a proposal that consular officers should be Instructed to furnish periodical bank certificates in respect of any balances of funds obtained by theia direct from Dominion Governments, and to request you to inform Mr. secretary ivden that he sees no objection to the issue of the proposed instructions and that he is willing to infoim the Governments of the Dominions, in due course, of their issue. 2. It is presumed that the instructions will be embodied in a circular to consular officers, and :4r. a clonal d would be glad if he might be given an A * opportunity of seeing the circular in draft fora. 5. Mr. MacDonald would propose to cause copies of the circular, when issued, to be sent to the Dominion Governments, and he would at the same time furnish the latterDraft Paper. polit t cat.

Iko ^ V^utaa , ' ^0 oVyv^ • ' I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to enclose a copy of a letter from the Foreign Office regarding the production by H.M.Consular Officers of certificates in respect of balances of funds held by them on behalf of the Govt, of India. 2. It is understood that the proposal relates only to Consular posts the cost of which is met in the first instance by the Foreign Office and is borne wholly on Foreign Offi’ce and only to the funds, if any, held at I those posts on behalf of the Government of India. It is presumed, however, that if there are such cases the Government of India already have some system of accounting which provides for periodical certificates of balances held which might serve the purpose which the Comptroller and Auditor-General and H.M.Treasury have in mind. It is apparently not contemplated that the proposed quarterly certificates should be furnished other than to the Government of India. 3. I am accordingly to say that the Secretary of State for India would be glad to be furnished with the observations of the Government of India on the proposed instructions.

S.W.l. ! 1937 ; ' 7 12th October, 1937. I am directed by Mr. Secretary Eden to request you to inform the Secretary of State for India that he has had under consideration, at the request of the Comptroller and Auditor- General and His Majesty’s Treasury, the question of the production of bank certificates by consular officers in resnect of ^.ny balances of funds obtained by them direct from the Government of India in advance of expenditure to be incurred on behalf of that government. 2. It has been decided, if the Secretary of State for India concurs, to instruct consular officers who hold such balances on account of the Government of India to furnish to that government a bank certificate, together with the officer’s own certificate in respect of cash held in the office, showing the balance held on the last day of each quarter. 3. The bank certificate will be in the form of a statement by the consulate bankers showing all balances of consular funds in their custody on the prescribed date, under separate headings one of which will relate to the funds of the Government of India. 4. In view of the lapse of time which would occur if notification of such balances were to be made through the Foreign Office, it appears desirable that the relevant certificates The Under-Secretary of State, India Officecertificates should be sent by consular officers direct to the Government of India. 5. The arrangements now contemplated will not apply to cases in v/hich expenditure is met in the first instance from Foreign Office funds, against recovery by the consular officer or the Foreign Office from the Government of India or from your department. 6 . Mr. Eden would suggest that the Government of India should be informed of the proposed instructions, so that they may be in a position to call for any certificates inadvertently omitted from the statements of account rendered by consular officers in regard to the expenditure for which funds have been supplied by that government. 7. Similar letters have been addressed to the Dominions Office and Colonial Office, and copies have been sent to the Exchequer and Audit Department and to His Majesty* s Treasury* I am.
