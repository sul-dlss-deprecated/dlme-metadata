POLITICAL agency, KUWAIT, f Dated 29th December From The Political Agent, Kuv.-ai t. T To The secretary to the Hon*ble the political Resident in the Persian Gulf, ' — Residency, Bahrain. Subject : Pay of penial Establishment. Sir, I have the honour to refer to the correspondence resting with this office letter No.592 dated the 27/29th I.arch 1945 and ■ to bring to your notice the fact that the cost of the principal items of consumption of menials has risen from 50 to 100 ; since April 1945 when the last increase in their Dearness Allowance was made. This will be clearly seen from the Table 'if 1 attached. Particularly difficult for them is the increase in rents. A small house of which the pre-war rent was Rs.4/- to ..s.8/- per mensem now costs Rs.40/- to Rs.50/- and many of our menials are having to pay such sums. This is largely due to the construction programme of the Kuwait Oil Company who employ nearly all the available artisans and purchase all the available building mate rials, This has caused building costs - and with them rents - to rise disproportionately, it is the declared intention &lt;3f the oil company to continue their expansion at the maximum possible rate regardless of the cost in money. This means that there is little or no chance of a fall in prices for several years to come. 2. Since Ray 1945 no less than 13 menials have left their work here mostly because of the insufficiency of the pay, and these without exception have had no trouble in finding more remunerative wz work elsewhere. Contractors working for the Kuwait oil Company are now paying As.5/- a day to coolies whom they are prepared to engage for reasonably long periods at this rate. It Is thus possible for an able-bodied, unskilled man to earn from ns.130/- to As.150/- per month whereas the pay and dearness allowance of an Agency larrash is only As.57/8/-. Unuer these circumstances it is not surprising tnat we are fast being reduced to employing exclu sively juveniles, dotarus, and cripples and that efficiency is suffering in consequence. Further, frequent changes - bringing in each time a less reputable type of man - produce an element of danger to Government records and funds, for it is only too likely that sooner or later a thief will be employed. c, I annex as Table a statement showing the pay given to their menial staff by other concerns in Kuwait. I understand that the Imperial Bank of Iran intend to increase their pay to about 10 $ with effect from the 20th lurch 1947. The Kuwait Government Education Department have recently increased all dearness allowance by 10 k ^hd the Kuwait oil Company are increasing their 'Temporary Emergency Allowance' by 50 / with effect from 1st January 1947. when these facts become generally known it is more than likely that there will be an exodus ol menial staff from the Agency unless the Government of India promptly sanction an increase in pay for them. \ /±# It is particularly difficult to find and keen sweepers here as they do not form a separate caste as in India and all forms of employment are open to them. Possibly it was a misapprehension on this point that caused the Government of India to reject my predecessor’s recommendation of 100 / in the dearness alllowance for sv.eepeis with the result that this .agency has suffered endless troubles.EXT ' » 19 © ilar '-V pay of the Agency menials nearer to that of thcjs e doing sin work elsewhere , I recommend that Dearness Allowance be increased v/ith effect from 1st January 1947 to 150 % of basic pay for those menials drawing ts.50/- and less as basic pay and to 100 ) for the rest. In the case of the Truck driver whose basic pay is much higher than that of others I recommend a dearness allowance of 50 * only of his basic pay. The total .increased cost will be ';S.1476/- in the current financial year under the following heads : Office allowance -- Rs . 801-00-0 (I) Launch grant — Rs. 450-00-0 Maintenance of Truck — RS. 225-00-0 1476-00- In a whole year (1947-1948) it follows : will be RS . 5904/- - divided Office allowance mm Rs. 8204-00-0 (II) Launch grant — s. 1800-00-0 Maintenance of Truck T — Rs. 900-00-0 Total Rs. 5904-00-0 I* have the honour to re uest that the matter be brought to the notice of the Government of Inclia v/ith a request for an early decision. &gt; Gua.

These are at present three posts in the ordinary grade of the vernacular cadre, viz,, fc. 120-6-240, plus Rs, 50A rn allowances, and it is proposed that they should be raised to the specialgrade of Rs. 250-10-300. The allowances may, however, be left at the ordinary vernacular cadre rate, instead of raising them to correspond with those paid to the Head Munshis at Bushire (Ks. 90/-, olus Customs Compensation Allowance of Rs. 25/-) or Bahrain (Rs. 65/-). 3. The reason why it has become necessary to put forward this proposal is that the value of good interpreters has been forced up by the prices which Oil Companies and other concerns are prepared to pay for them, with the result that instead of getting the highest quality of men in point of intelligence, trustworthiness and personal character, the Residency is now only able to attract those who are unable to obtain employment elsewhere. 4. In the last half-year, no fewer than 3 out of a total of 7 ordinary grade interpreters have resigned from the cadre, even though it meant forfeiting their pensionable service, because other fields offered them more attractive opportunities. This is sufficiently serious, and it is still more serious that we should have been unable to recruit men of a sufficiently high standard to replace them. We have been compelled to engage (on a temporary basis) raw youths who are, admittedly, able to^ learn their way about routine office work; but who are entirely, unsuited ior the really important side of vernacular work in these countries. , ,As an example of the competition we have to face, it may.be stated tnat the Anglo*Persian Oil Company pay even their jmipr xHimqpnbm interpreters from 160 to 240 tonans (worth slightly more than the same number of rupees at the present rate of exchange): while a senior man would receive about 400 tomans with many valuable concessions. In Kuwait (where the Oil Company do not employ interpreters) ordinary Arab clerks on routine duties are paid from te. 166/- to Rs, 210/- and receive free accommodation, light, fuel and water when employed at the Company s headquarters, which are outside Kuwait town. The competition of the oil cornpanies, far from decreasi ng in peace time is likely to be greatly enhanced since the war has restricted their expansion and consequently their demand for this type of men, and it is doubly important that we should secure good men nov&lt; before they are all taken up by our Mnujn a feTfrira competitors. 6. Although Muscat is not at present exposed to the competition of an oil company, it is probable that it will be after thv war; and the interpreter there always has particularly responsible duties since there is a large British Indian mercantile community, with a considerable amount of court work and estates under administration. It is also, of course, important that this post shquld.be ma interchangeable with tne others, to preserve fluidity in p 9 stings and make it possible to relieve a man who is affected by the climate.7. To get the right type, we must bo able to offer the prospect that after some years• service in the ordinary vernacular grade, a man may obtain a special grade post giving him an income comparable to that which he could obtain elsewhere. At present eertain special grade posts have been created for the duration of the war; but no men worth having are acg attracted by the prospect of a few years temporary service, and then unemployment in the postwar world. 8. This war has shown even more clearly than peace-time events the continuing importance of the Persian Gulf to India, and the necessity of a liberal policy in the staffing of its cadres; and I therefore urge upon the Government of India the desirability of revising tne pay of these posts are ^ proposed above. A proposition statement is attached, and it is hoped that a telegraphic sanction may be given.ta^al Telegram No, 56-S/GaK5) Dated the 6th }4ay 1943. Prom:- Foreign* Simla, To: — Britconaul, Bushire.

This letter was written very shortly after I had assumed charge, and when I was unfamiliar with present day conditions in the Persian Gulf. Since it was sent we have had practical experience of this post, the nature of the work which is performed there, and also, what is equally important, the type of man who will be required to fill it. 2. I have now come to the conclusion that on security grounds it is impossible to entrust this work to anyone but an Upper Division clerk. The kind of man we require cannot be obtained at Lower Division rates, and out* attempts to fill it in this manner have already cost us two resignations and a great waste of public funds. Similar work is done in the Basra Consulate-General by a British Vice-Consul or Pro- Consul, and in the Baghdad Embassy by European Cypher Clerks on a very substantial rate of pay, and will, on the proposed reorganization of the Foreign Service be performed by clerks on the Foreign Office establishment. The Political Agent is placed at a great disadvantage if he is obliged to entrust secret and confidential work to men with inferior attainments, and at Bahrain, despite the presence of a second Political Officer, two Upper Division posts, namely that of Confidential clerk and Stenographer, exist for this work. 3. I see no prospect whatever of the amount of secret and confidential work in this Agency diminishing with the conclusion of hostilities. All oil matters, which require a high degree of security, are in abeyance at the moment, and are only awaiting the end of the war to open on a very large scale. I would be glad, therefore, if the Government of India would agree to my amending views expressed upon inadequate experience and accord their sanction to this post being changed from the Lower Division to the Upper Division, and to its being styled Confidential Clerk. It will be seen from the proposition statement attached that the extra average cost involved is only Fs.662 per annum, of which half will fall upon His Majesty's Government. Since a reference to the India Office will be necessary and since the natter is urgent I am sending a copy of this letter to them direct. I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant Sd.

In view of the urgent necessity of reducing the pressure of work at the Koweit Agency and freeing the Political Agent from routine work to enable him to fulfil his proper duties without hindrance, the Government of India have sanctioned the appointment of an additional clerk at the Agency. The Head Clerk will now attend to confidential work of a routine nature which has apparently been carried out hitherto by Col. Dickson himself assisted by his wife and, temporarily, by a clerk deputed from Bushire. It will be seen from the statistics given in the enclosures to the Government of India’s letter that even on paper the work of the Confidential Office at Koweit has more than doubled in the course of the last decade, but as explained in the Political Resident’s letter of 30th September, these statistics do not show the real measure of the increased burden of work falling upon the Agency. To offset some of the additional expenditure involved in the employment of an additional clerk at Koweit the Government of India have reduced the status of the Head Clerk at Mohammerah as proposed by the Political Resident in order to save money [the Resident does not pretend that the reduction is otherwise desirable), and they have not been able in view of the present financial stringency to accept the Resident’s proposal to raise the status of the Head Clerk at Koweit. The net average additional expenditure involved in these changes as a whole (viz. Rs.1260 per annum) is somewhat less than £100 per annum, but since theincreased expenditure at the Koweit Agency taken by itself, which averages Es. 2,680 per annum, exceeds £100, the prior sanction of the Secretary of State in Council and the prior concurrence of the Foreign Office should strictly have been obtained under the usual arrangements governing divisible expenditure. The Government of India now request the approval of the Secretary of State for the action which they have taken in anticipation of his sanction. A draft letter to the Foreign Office proposing to approve the Government of India T s action subject to their concurrence and Treasury acceptance of a moiety of the expenditure incurred, is submitted for appro valiv /w Secretary.

Dated New Delhi, the ^ * November 1953 Creation of the post of Second clerk for the Kuwait Agency and the reduction in the status of the post of Head clerk, Mohammerah. Sir I am directed to forward a copy of the correspondence Letter from the Hon'ble the Political } noted in the margin Resident in the Persian Gulf,No.2047 dated C the 30th September 1933. 0 and to say that Memorandum to the do No. 5 F.99(9 )-E/33, dated the November 1933. J in the circumstances explained by the Hon’ble the Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Government of India have sanctioned, in anticipation of the approval of His Majesty*s Secretary of State for India, the creation of a post of Second Clerk, Kuwait Agency, and the reduction of the status of the Head Clerk at Mohemmerah, with effect from the 1st December 1933. In view of the present financial stringency, it has not been possible to accept the Hon*ble the Resident's proposal to raise the status of the post of Head clerk at Kuwait. Although the net average additional expenditure amounts to less than £100 per annum, the extra expenditure involved in the Kuwait Agency taken by itself exceeds £100 per annum 'which is beyond the limit upto which the Government of India are empowered to sanction divisible expenditure in an^tme Consulate. Technically the sanction2 sanction of His Majesty’s Secretary of State is required 'but in view of the Political Resident* s request for urgent orders the sanction of Secretary of State has been anticipated. I am to request that this may he approved. I have the honour to he, Sir, Your most obedient servant, CA^- —- for Foreign Secretary to the Government of India.Copy of letter Eo.2047 of 1933 dated 30th September 1933 from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India,Few Delhi. Clerical -^stablishment of the Political Agent, Kuwait. I have the honour to recommend!- (i) that the Head Clerkship of the Kuwait Agency should, in future, be a Special Grade appointment, (ii) that a post of Second Clerk of the Kuwait Agency should be created, and (iii) that the Head Clerkship of the Vice- Consulate at Mohammerah reduced from the status of a Special Grade appointment and should in future be held by an Upper Divisio n Clerk. 2. A proposition statement showing the effect of these recosmmendations is enclosed, from which it will be seen that a net average annual increase of expenditure of Rs.2, 640/- is involved. 3. The Hon f ble Lieut-Colonel Fowle made a personal inspection of the Kuwait Office before he proceeded on leave and instructed me to explain that the proposals now made are submitted at his direction and with his full support. The proposed arrangements are, he is convinced, imperatively necessary to free the Political Agent from routine confidential work to enable him to fulfil hie own duties without hindrance and to prevent the English Office of the Kuwait Agency from breaking down. A breakdown has only been staved off by the fact that Mrs. Dickson has assisted in the more confidential work (a time-honoured but indefensible method of keeping Offices in the Persian Gulf from collapse) and recently by temporarily deputing an experienced clerk from the ResidencyResidency Office. Neither of these expedients can be continued. 4. A statement is enclosed showing the receipts and issues from the Kuwait Agency Office fnr the last decade, but statistics give little real information about the state of affairs, and I wish to place before the Govern ment of India certain more general considerations. The position in Kuwait has completely changed in the past few years. The activities of its neighbours Sa^di Arabia and ’Iraq, the opening up of communications with the outside world by motor and by sir, and the competition for oil both in t. and around Kuwait, have overthrown the former isolation and Bedouin character of the place. As specific questions, the date garden disputes, the Sa’udi Blockade and continual incidents over smuggling and shipping, may be mentioned as typical of the trouble some matters which arise. Moreover, Kuwait is a most valuable centre for obtaining desert information, but the Political Agent must be free to see visitors if he is properly to fulfil this role . I would only exphasize that the Arab regards haste as unseemly, and without time it is impossible either to do business with him, or to get information from him. 5. At present the clerical establishment of the Kuwait Agency consists of a Head Clerk from the Upper Division, a Munshi from the Upper Division and a non-pensionable Passport Clerk. The Head Clerk does all the non-confidential work of the office, keeps the accounts, supervises Launch and other establishments and stores. He has himself to keep inward and outward registers and to do his own despatching work. The Munshi is fully occupied and, though the Passport Clerk assists the lead ^lerk so far as is possible, he has little time available and it is unsuitable that much should be left to a clerk of his status. Unde r.Under the present proposals, the Head Clerk will act as the Political Agent’s confidential clerk and typist, will register all confidential letters, prepare secret returns and file confidential papers, thus freeing the Political Agent for his legitimate duties. He will also exercise general supervision over the office. The Second Clerk will be entrusted with the accounts (under the supervision of the Head Clerk) and non- confidential work of the office. The Munshi and Passport Clerk will continue to attend to the work which they are now doing. 6 . The average cost of these proposals amounts to Rs 11,808/- a year i.e. an average annual increase of Hs. J 5,960 over the present average cost. In view of the need for economy, it is proposed that the post of Head Clerk at ISohammerah shall cease to be a Special Grade Appointment and that the incumbent shall be a clerk of the Upper Division. This will effect an average saving of Rs 1,520 a year. I cannot pretend that this reduction in the grade of the Head Clerk at Mohammerah is desirable, but I am anxious at the present juncture to do all that is possible to avoid asking Government to face any extra expenditure that can be avoided. Taking this reduction into consideration the changes proposed involve a net average increase of Ss 2,640/- per annum. 7. In view of the overworked state of the Kuwait Agency Office and of the fact jc that it has been necessary to refuse permission to Lieut-Colonel Dickson, though his health is bad, to go on leave or even to enjoy recess, I beg that the proposals may be sanctioned with effect from the 1st Hovember 1953. I am prepared to find the sum required to meet the additional cost in the current year, 1955-54, by re-appropriation.8 , Finally, I would beg the Government of India, in considering these proposals, to bear in mind a new factor ^ which affects proposals of this nature, ^e are no longer dealing with the Bedouin Ruler, the adventurer type of foreign Consul, and the old fashioned pioneering firms oi the past. We are now compelled to deal with Rulers, who have adopted, to a greater or less extent, a civilised diplomacy, great oil companies, and international air and other interests, and it is essential, therefore„ to provide our Agencies in the Persian Gulf with competent and sufficient office establishments.Es+sblishni .

Second ulerk for Kuwait. sir, i have the honour to refer to foreign and Political Department telegram uo#F# 252-Ji-23 dated the 10th December 1928 to your address sanctioning the abolition of the post of Second Clerk at Kuwait. 2. une of the points that has struck me most forcibly since assuming my present appointment is the absolute necessity of the revival of the post of tne second clerk. 3. xhe total clerical establishment of this Agency consists at present of the uead Clerk and one ^Junshi. xhe latter is not a typist, and the translations of all vernacular letters more especially those to do with passports and certificates of identity work, comnunications from the Ruler, have to be typed by the nead Clerk. 4. i/y predecessor had been able to manage without a Second Clerk by himself doing much of the work performed in other offices by the clerical establishment. Colonel itfore typed all long correspondence himself, coded and decoded all telegrams, drafted and wrote all vernacular letters and in the majority of cases typed the translations himself, xhe above of course does not refer to the confidential side of the office such as cyphering and decyphering telegrams, typing confidential matters and maintaining registers, files, etc. etc., all of which work was done by colonel More assisted by mrs. More, who was, i believebelieve, an expert typist and stenographer 5. i, on the other hand, do not type or write Arabic, though i speak it fluently, nor do i get the time to code and decode telegrams, rhe result is that all this work which used to he done by my predecessor personally has now been transferred to the head Clerk, and i consider this is more * than one man should fairly be asked to do® 6. uwing to the long strained relations between Iraq and jwejd and the recent rebellion of ibn baud’s tribes,telegraphic correspondence has become very heavy and the head Clerk is often obliged to spend hours on end solely in coding and decoding telegrams, this to the detriment of his proper and legitimate duties such as attending to accounts, passports, filing, etc® 7. finally, i would observe that if the nead Clerk were to fall ill (a not unlikely contingency in the Climate of the Culf; there is no ah one in the office capable of typing^xauastx a letter, and all work would be seriously delayed, and were the Political Agent to be on recess at the time the conse quences might be serious. 8. i therefore strongly urge that u-overnment be moved,as soon as possible, to sanction the revival of the post of Second Clerk at Kuwait. 9. X might mention that not so very long ago there were two Political officers at Kuwait, with seven clerks to assist them. X refer to the period when colonel -Hamilton was in charge and Captain McCollum was his assistant. x nave,etc., ad/- h.H.P.Dickson, Lt.Co 1., Political Agent, Kuwait.j?‘ro:m - The Under Secretary to the G-overnraent of India in the Foreign and Political Department, To - The Hon'ble the Political resident in the Persian Gulf* Memorandum .wo •P* 20(15 )-E/29* Simla Dated/M3Lx3ta±hx,the 1st uctoher 1929* xemporary appointment of a second cleric, Kuwait. lour letter xmo.1796, dated the 4th August 1929* 2* i'JO powers regarding fresh expenditure on salaries in connection with Diplomatic and Gonsular Services in Persia having been delegated to the hon’ble the Political Kesident in the Persian Gulf it is not within your competence to sanction the creation of appointment of /even a temporary cleric in Persia.

Sir, I have the honour to invite a reference to my letter Bo. 1796, dated the 4th August 1929 in which I reported for the information and approval of the Government of India that I had sanctioned a temporary appointment of 2nd Clerk, Kuwait to meet the immediate need for clerical assistance which the Political Agent found himself faced with. The Political Agent has again addressed me on the subject pointing out by reference to facts and figures that the work in his office has increased sufficiently to justify the revival of the post of 2nd Clerk, permanently. I enclose « Bo. 1/2-1V/918 dated 27th August 1929 ) a copy of his letter for the with enclosures. ) information of the Government o f Ind ia • As an alternative to reviving the post of 2nd clerk, Colonel Dickson has suggested the appointment of a passport clerk as sanctioned in the cases of Bamtein a nd Ik) hammer ah, as a large portion of the routine work in Kuwait is connected with passports. I support this alternative suggestion and, therefore, request that the Government of India will be pleased tosanction the appointment of a non - pens ipiiaole passport cleric for the Kuwait i^gency on a fixed pay of Ks, 150 per mensem plus Rs. 30/- House rent and dollar excnange compensa tion when admissible on the understanding that the extra expenditure involved is covered by the passport and visa fees collected. That such fees are sufficient to cover the expenditure will be seen from the statement forwarded, herewith, showing the amounts credited to Government of India on this account during the years 1927-28 and 1928-29 and the first five months of the current year. I nave, etc., Sd. G. G. J. Barrett, Political Resident in tne Persian Gulf.Copy of a letter Ho. 1/2-IV/918, dated the 27tn August 1929 from Lt-Colonel H.R.P. Dickson, G.I.E., Political Agent, Kuwait to the :ion*hle Lieut-Golonel J• &lt;1 • -Barreto, C.S.l., C.I.2., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire• Second Clerk for Kuwait * With reference to paragraph k 1 of your letter ITo. * 1797, dated 4th August 19S9, to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, on the subject of the revival ox the Second Clerk*s post at Kuwait, I have the honour to state that after the despatch of my letter Ho. 791, dated the 28tn June 1929 to your address, I commenced collecting facts and figures in support of my original view| that the work of the Kuwait Agency had increased to such an extent as to justify the revival of the Second Clerk*s post. . , I had intended to furnish figures for the last ten years, hut I find that only from 1922 onwards have proper and continuous serial numbers been kept of Inward and Outward letters and telegrams, both in the Confidential and Hon-Con- fidential sections of my office. I have, therefore, confined myself to figures for the years 1922 to 1923, including 1929 up to the 31st July 1929. These I am taking the liberty of sending you in the form of a progressive statement. 2. Examining this statement, and taxing to tads only, it will be seen that under the main heading **C onf i iential Section ”, the number of letters and telegrams dealt with by the Political Agent alone, have risen from 341 in 1922 to 953 in 1923, wn.le for 1929 we may reasonably anticipate that the figures will reach the large total of 1600 . 3 # On closer examination of these figures, it will be seen that while the increase in receipts and issues of Confidential letters together, nas not been very marked, figures for receipts alone have risen from 79 in 1922 to 303 in 1928, which all means extra work for the Political Agent, such as registering, filing, etc. On the other hand there has been'been a remarkable 'jump up' in the figures for telegrams from 1926 to 1923 both under receipts and issues, which figures promise to reach the total of 600 under telegrams received and 500 under telegrams issued during 1929, whereas previous to 1925 they averaged only 30, and 100 respectively. The point I wish to emphasize here is that the aoove are all 'Cypher telegrams and have to be dealt with by the Political Agent in person, the Head Clerk in no way assisting. These telegrams whether received or sent out are often very long necessitat ing the Political Agent spending many hours on them, when he could be better employed keeping closer touch witn the local Ruler and his people, or moving about. In other words whereas in the days of Political Agents like bnakespear, Knox, Hamilton, etc., the Political Agent v/as able to get about a great deal, today he is, to the disadvantage of all concerned, slowly being forced to adopt an office existence. 4 # Turning now to the figures under the ' -Ton-Con fitien zis.l Section ', it will be seen, again taking to_tal_s alone, that correspondence dealt with has risen from 3037 leu^ers in 19^2 to 7252 in 1923, wnich figure promises to reach the truly alarming total of 10,000 for 1929* 5 . On examining the details we find that whereas letters received have risen from 1265 per annum in 1922 to 3071 in 1923, and to 2511 for the naif year Ox 1929, letters issued, and telegrams received and issued, have more or less remained the same. Tne Dig increase has been under the head of ' Passports issued '. 'These nave risen from 737 in 1922 to 2957 in 1923, with a probable rise to 3500 in 1929* 6. This remarkable rise in Passport work is in the main due to the advent of the motor car and the efficient new motor services which ply between Kuwait and Basrah and which has made everyone desirous of travelling. When, therefore, I sav thst this increased work has to be dealt with by my Head Clerk alone, the Arab Translator merely dealing with the translation of Arab letters into English, it will be seen that the Head Clerk's position (work) is not an enviable one today.7 The point ±kl I now come to is, how are we to meet this H problem of increased work* % solution originally was to get the Head Clerk to assist me in my Confidential typing, whilst the Second Clerk when he came would relieve tne Head Clerk of much of his routine work. The great assistance rendered by your so promptly sending me Hr. Lohani has enabled me to carry out my above plan very largely and work all round has become easier. But the fact that he has been sent for 3 months only, with a possible extension for another three months does not really solve the problem, while the very feeling that the man may be taken away at any time v/ill have an unsettling effect on both the Political Agent, the Head Clerk and the temporary Clerk himself. I would, therefore, suggest for your favourable consideration, as a more permanent solution of the difficulty, and provided always that yo i cannot see your way to reconsider your views with regard to the desirability of reviving the post of Second Clerk, that the Government of India be approached with the re commendation that a Passport and Registration Clerk on the same line, as the one employed at Bahrein be given to Kuwait. The pay of tnis xs clerk who will start in the III Grade to be rne t from the Passport collections now credited by me to Government. The Clerk to be English speaking and having a thorough knowledge of typing. Ke will be expected to do all the work that the present temporary Second Clerk is doing, as well as dealing with passports. I trust you will be able to see your way to approve and forward this suggestion to the Government of India for their consideration.v&gt;:i . 1 jr 3 7 Copy of a confiden terj ITo»463- &gt; S &gt; d^ced Bus lire, the 6th STovemher 1926, from the Hon*'ole the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to the Foreign Secretary to the Government •erf Indi&gt;'i Delhi» err—rr. a i 1 * 3 4 5 6 # ^CLOSURE IN Misconduct of Khan Suhih Ihtisham ud Dauleh. X have the honour to refer to correspondence ending with Foreign and Political Department memorandum IT 0 .II 6 -X, dated the 23th August 1924, on the subject of Kh^n Sahib Ihtisham ud Dauleh, who,nas then dragoman of the Muscat Political Agency• 2» This ministerial officer was transferred in the ordinary routine to Kuwait as Head Cleric in March 1925» 3. Generally the duties of this post are comparatively unimportant, but for three months of the year, when the Political Agent goes away on recess, the responsibility which devolves on the uead Clerk at Kuwait is considerable* 4 . I regret to report that Ihtisham ud Dauleh has again failed in a matter of trust and his action nearly resulted 5 in th^ execution of three oersons who h~d absconded from Kuwait to Persia. A brief description of the case is contained in the attached note* 5. It is true that Assistant Surgeon Cuzen, the Consular Agent at Lingah, was -Iso very much to blame, but the Khan Sahib has more experience of Political work and it is very significant that on the same day that he arranged with the Shaikh oi Kuwait for the extradition of the fugitives he received from the latter a present of a gold watch. 6. .Although the Khan Sahib reported to Major More, who w.s at Shiraz, the receipt cf the watch and -sked permission to keep it, he made no mention, either then or in any other communication of the absconders* case. Both the Head Clerk and the Consular Agent failed in their duty .Iso in not referring such a case to Bushire. The case came to my knowledge by the merest fortunate chance*7. If I had not got the prisoners landed at Bushire, the Persian authorities would have had good cause for attacking the Residency. On the 29th September the K^r.^uzar of the Gulf Ports sent me a protest to the effect that he had heard ci the case from the Deputy Governor of Lingah, that the Persian Government does not approve of slavery and has never conduced any extradition treaty with the Shaikh of Kuwait. 'If the Shaikh of Kuwait had any claim against the slaves he should have submitted it to the local court of law'. B. Khan Sahib Ihtisham ud Dauleh was suspended and ordered to proceed to Bushire while his case was under consideration. An explanation was also called for from Assistant Surgeon Cuzen. There has been some unavoidable delay in proceeding further with the case, as the return of Kajor Lore to Kuwait had to be awaited, after which I sent Captain Horner there to discuss the matter further» 9. 13ajor More has informed me that until this incident occurred he had no cause to complain against the Head Clerk. How however, he adds 'I could never again feel happy to go away on recess and leave him in charge at this Political Agency' 10* In these ci reams t.-nces I -recommend that Khan S...nib Ihti&amp;h&amp;a ud Db.uleh be dismissed from Government service. Do Political Officer in the Persian Gulf will readily accept him in his office, and the man cannot hoxje to be placed in a position of trust again. His prospects ^re therefore blocked and as a discontented man he will probably go from bad to worse. IToteImOTE regarding three absconders from Kuwait to Persia. On -the 24th August 1926 the Consular Agent, Lingah, wired to 'Politicad, Kuwait'; 'Two slaves and one fair woman have arrived here. They 'are Ali Kh lihih*:- slaves. Circumstances suspicious.' The Head Clerk, Kuv/ait, replied th t the slaves had eloped with the woman in her husband’s absence nd had gone off with their master’s boat, three carpets, Ps.j.025 and two rifles. 'Political, Lingah,' replied to 'Political, Kuwait*» 'Co.n the Shaikh supply necess. ry escort to yours ? 'ifone available here'. The Head Clerk replied: 'Escort being sent by next boat'. Prom the Lingah file it appears that the party landed in Persia at Dastur near Bushire. They proceeded along the coast till they reached Hugh . i • here the ' oc■1 Shaikh sent them to the Certificates and said that they had fled on account of ill- treatment. The Consular Agent, Lingah, thought th -t he recognized them as the Shaikh of Kuwait’s slaves and wired accordingly. On receipt of the reply he asked the Chief of Persian Police to take them into custody and to feed them at his expense/. Eventually Dr. Cuzen accompc».nied the Persian Police escort which took them on board and handed them over.to the Kuwait guard. Major Barrett was a passenger travelling from Muscat to Bahrein and thought the circumst nces peculiar. He mentioned them to the Politic *1 Resident at Bahrein. The latter telegraphed to Captain Horner, Bushire, to go on board the steamer, investigate and 'If the Shaikh had not been correspond ing direct with the Persian authorities to land the prisoners at Bushire pending further consideration'. This was duly * Consular Agency at Lingah. There they applied for Manumission done In view c f the f .ct that the woman would certainly have been■been put to death, as well as her ahductor i i. . ney hao. f*alien c jain into the hands o f the Shaikh an ~ th-^t . w - -i n would hare been most severely punished - probably mutilated for theft - the whole party with the concurrence of the k of Bushire was despatched as quickly as possible to Aden, the men claiming to be Zanzibaris by birth. In Major More r s opinion the Shaikh of Ku t knows perfectlv well th t he was not entitleo to expect their extradition. He has irm.de no representation or protest on the subject as yet.
