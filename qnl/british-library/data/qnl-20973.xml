At the present time the Com modore has only his own ship the ■■Juno' ani* the Lawrence up at this end of the Gulf, and the •• Lawrence has just been detailed for a special job by order of the Commander-in-Chief, so that there is no ship available. But even if there were I would hesitate to ask the Com modore to detail a ship for a job like this. Of course if a ship happened to be at Bahrain en route to Kuwait or the riv^r about the time of Shaikh Hamad*s proposed journey,or at Kuwait about the time of his return, it would be a differ ent matter. Eut otherwise unless Shaikh Hamad were going on a journej in our interests, or at our suggestion, it would hardly be feasible to get a man-of-war put at his disposition. 1 should think Shaikh Hamad*s best plan would be to get up to Kuwait by one of these extra steamers (which seem to be coming more often now) and get the Shaikh to send him baok in his yacht.
