PON Good-Friday, in the Year 1626. we took fhipping at Deal near Dover, having fix great and well manned jfhips in company, all which were bound for the Eafl-Jndies.

The wind blew fair, fo as the feven and twentieth day failing by Mho in Galletia (which if that called Terraconenfts was of old a Colony of the Perfmns) welanched into theSpa- nifti Ocean, which we no fooner entred but defcryed feven tall Ihips, whom reputing Enemies we boreuptofpeakwith, howbeit they proved Friends, Hollanders out of the Levant, who drunk our healths and faluted us as they paft with a roaring Gulverin, and we in return vomited out a like grateful eccho: Thus plowing the liquid Seas in merrinefs till the nine and twentieth day made us thefport of danger, ftrugling with fuch mighty waves and deep Seas as oft-times made usfeem to climb up Mountains of fait water, and were ftraightway precipitated headlong as it were 'twixt cloven Seas, a good while Hea ven and Sea feeming undivided.

The Inqui- fition affrights thofe of the reformed,perfwafion to cohabit with them. Grand Canary ( aim oft as broad as long, the Diameter being about fifty miles ) ufually, is the relldence of the Inquifitor^ whither all the other Ifles ordinarily repair for Juitice It abounds with many good things, as Goats, Beeves, AfTes, Hogs. Barly, Rye, Rice, variety of Flowers, Grapes, and other excellent Fruits as alfo with Ingenios, or Sugar-houfes wherein they grind their Canes, and boyl the juice to make it Sugar. This Ifle is from San^a Cmx m Teneriff 13 Leagues, from Forte Ventura 20. from Lancerota 18. at the South end is a large Bay, called Majpalomha, where frelh water is afforded. The Ifle as I took it thus feems at eight leagues diftance. fentrifa is 50 Englifh miles long, and for multitude of Inhabitants compares With great Canary her chief Towns be SanBa Cruz*y and jinagona^ or hagundy at the bottom of theHill called Garachiaa, which exceeds it in Grapes, yielding yearly^ as fome fay* eight and twenty thoufand Buts of Sack \ and outbraves not only the reft of the circunp jacent files, but all the Earth for fupereminence: Her high peak Teyda towring fo lofti ly into the Air, as feems not only to penetrate the middle Region but to peep into Hea ven, from whence Larim metaphorically calls it Atlas and. Olympm, and I may more fit ly apply that of Lucan in his lib. 2. Than which no Earthly part doth tower more high In any place, or nearer joins the Skie. For 'tis by moil accounted 15 miles in height, 6b fays Scaliger, 70 Tatricim , yea, one Nichols our Coi|ntryman who lived here fome time, affirms, that it is 47. which height I the mope admire, feeing that Geographers attribute a far lefs height to the higheft Mountain in the World v allowing but 3, Varennius 4, in a Perpendicular, others but 15 furlongs i and no doubt the 54 miles Theuetm 9 and 60 that Sanato afcribes, is meant- by the oblique, or circular afcent. So high nevertheleis it is, as in ferene wea ther it isfeen 120 Englifh miles, which fbme double^ ferving as an excellent Pharo, far exceeding thofe near Cayro : and whence, ( fome prefiime to lay ) there is at no time ei ther rain, or wind at the top of it *, fo fiippofed, by being elevated above thofe Regions 5 it beingan Opinion ampngft Philofophers, that no Vapors rife above 50 miles into the Air, from the Earths fuperficies. In afcending this Mountain they ufually ride circular- \ for about 7 leagues fpace, and are then forced to foot the reft. The lower part of the Hill has plenty of wood j the middle parts, byreafon of Snow, is cold*, buttowards B 2 the4- Tropicus the top, in regard of the Veins of Brimftone, it inflames fo as the Spaniard calls it the Devils Cauldron*, and from whence, not only the Canary Ifles but the Continent of frique ( if report fay true ) may be difcovered, this high Pico rifes from the middle part of the Ifle, and of either fide has aj ledge of Hills which divide the Ifland. The fcape it bare as we Sailed by, is'thus prefented. — Tenerifa is about 13 leagues Weft from Grand Caharia, from La Talma 20. from Go- wera 5. from Afrique 75. from Madera 70. In old times here, as in Grand Canaria* they ufed to embalm the dead, and in Caves very deep and dark, placed them in feveral pofturesv/ome ftanding, fome lying upon Planks*, in which Art they were fingular: Dormitories, fo venerably reputed, as they were very rarely feen by any, and that but by permiffion. Hiero or F err am, appeared very high Land as we pail by it, and bears S S. W. from Grand Canaria. Gomera is 6 leagues from Temriffa, and above 8 leagues long-, Falma is about 12 leagues fromGomeray and in circuit towards 20 leagues. Hiero is 10 leagues from La Palma, and not above 6 leagues in compafs. Famous is Hiero in one Tree ( for it has but one fuch ) which (like the miraculous Rock in the Defart) af fords frefh water to all the Inhabitants. The Natives call this Tree Garro\ Santo the Spaniard. Some part of the Day 'tis darkned with a cloudy Mift, which calls a Dew up- on the Leaves that diftills in clear fweet drops, Itreaming into two large Stone Cifterns capable for the neceffary ufe, not only of the People, but ofall the Cattelin thatlflan/- Syhefter gives it this true andvive defcription. In th? IJle of Iron ( one of thofe famefeven Whereto our Elders Happy name have given) The favage People never drinhjhe Streams Of Wells and Rivers, as in other Realms.

A Tree whofe tender bearded Root being (pread In dryefl Sand, his fweating Leaf doth Jhed A mofi fweet Liquor \ and (like as the Vine Vntimely ciit,weeps (at her wound) the Wine In pearled tears, ) incefantly diftills A royal Stream, which all their Gift ems fills Throughout the IJlandfor all hither hye. And all their Vvjfels cannot draw it dry ' Which is very rare *, Howbeitin Saint Thoma an Ifle under the Line, moftof the Trees there have the like property. La Talma is very high and woody, Vorteventura is jc leagues long and 8 broad, and near to Lancerota. Lancerota is lels than Teneriffa it was taken by that Englifli Leonidas the Earl of Cumberland, Anno 1506 and Teneriffa four years after by the Dutch -, the firft being pillaged, the other burnt * frnce when, both are better rortined. 'Twixt Lancerota and Worteventwra is another little Ifle called Lohos, alfo there are two fmall Ifles near Lancerota called Gratiofa m&amp; Alarrania in 28. d. 30. TotheEaft of thefe Ifles be F ez,z. and Moroccho, which are part of Mauritania Tyngvtana, fo called from Tangier, a ftrong and confiderable Town upon the African Coalt, oppoiite to Gibralter m Spain, which refemble Dover and Callais, and have like influence upon that nznow Strait.

Other unlucky accidents oft-times happen in thefe Seas, as when (efpecially in becalmings) men fwim in the bearing Ocean, the greedy Hayen called or armed with a double row of venemous teeth pur- fuethem, direded by a XittX &amp;Rhomhm or Mufculw, varioufly ftre^kt and coloured with blew and white, that feuds to and fro to bring the intelligence ^ which Pilot hih as one defcribes Mufculus eft parvus vifu, .fed corporc pukhro; Hi* body is right fair, though feeming final/, Hunc pifcem vero du&amp;orera nomine dicunt.

God be praifed, we mill the rage of rain, al beit the guft fomewhat endangered us*, but it contraried Seneca's Philofophy, Finis al- term mali gradm eft futuri: a pleafant breeze firft, increafmg into a profperous gale, cooled the air and pofted us out of thofe exuberances of Nature; fo that on May-day we. croft under the Equinodial ^ a Circle, which paifingEaft and Weft through the middle of the Earth, is imagined to divide the whole Globe into two equal parts or Hemifpaeres, from either Pole (in equidiftancy) 90 degrees, where we loft fight of the Sydm falutare, the Pole-ftar, a ftar of a third magnitude fixt in the tip of the little Bears tail; the Sun at thistime being in the 1.9. degree of Taurus, in Artick declination 17 degrees 31 minutes. And here we may obferve, that by reafonof folong a calm the heat became outrageous y neverthelefs experience alfured us, that the heat is notfo unfufferable under the fcqud- tor as where more remote, and with good reafon too, feeing that the breezes be more conftant towards Sun-fet, and greater where the motion of the air has greateft circles. The nights alfoare equal there in length to the day, and ordinarily dewy, which refri gerates and compenfates the heat of the day. Befides the heat is much abated by the two Winters there, and as a learned and noble Perfon conceives, the extreme heat within the Zodiaque attrads fuch ftreams of cold air or Atoms from each Pole into the torrid Zone, as exceedingly qualifies the burning heat, and may peradventure caufe the con ftant breezes which at 9 and 4 feldom fail, as do the rains which ordinarily fall at noon when the beams are hotteft. May 6. Wehad fome thunder and lightning or corpo fanUos, fuch as feem good Omens to the fuperftitiousat night we paft by SanBo-Croix the holy Crofs, every hour exped- ing the Monwon, an anniverfary wind that from one Rhomb conftantly blows one way fix Months, beginning exadly from the Suns entrance into a fign of the Zodiack *, and the other half year the contrary way, or till the Sun enter into the oppofite degree, and (as commonly obferved) from 27.to 37 degrees lat. 'tis for the moftpart Wefterly, which if Sea-men negled, they go near to lofe their paifage into India. Now how prepofterous the year and wind proved elfewhere I know not, doubtlefs it is the Emblem of inconftancy, experience taught it us but the weather fo long time proved our Antagonift that our paifage to the Cape oigood Hope became fix weeks longer than we looked for, fo as we were forc't to ran into much more longitude than we defired. May 8. We had 8 degrees 10 minutes Antartick latitude, the Monomotapan on the one fide, the Brafdian Coaft on the other, fiding us.

To return, this famous Cape elevates the Antartick Pole four and thirty degrees and three minutes latitude, lias longitude from the meridian of the Lizard 28 deg. 48 from the Azores *, albeit we found the variation Wefterly but 1 deg. and 40 min. (but at Cape de Aguillas little or no variation at all is of the Needle, the belt reafon being that the Ocean on both fides is alike, and the Land in equidiftancie.) From the Lands-end of Cornwall 'tis fix thoufand fix hundred miles Englilh, from the greater Java five thoufand five hundred and fifty, from Sarat five thoufand four hundred, and from Santta Helena (which is 5.

Albeit Ptol. after him gives no further extendure of land South, than 12 deg. affirming alfo that the two Oceans had no conjundure. But leaving this to better inquiry, more certain it is,that the Portuguife firft doubled this Cape in thefe iail Centuries divers years before Columbus made his ex pedition into the Weft Indies.

This Port of Euonghahor and the reft of Edom were formerly conquered by David 2 8. 14. where 'tis faid that he put a Garrifon in Edom, throughout all which Country put he Souldiers, fo as all they of Edom became David's Subjeds. Until Hadad one of the Princes of Edom flying tor luc- cour to Pharaoh King of t^Bgypt fo infinuated himfelf into the favour of the Egyptian King, that he not only gave the Edomite his Wifes Sifter in marriage, but hearing that Davidwd joab his General were dead, feemed little importunate for his ftay Solomon by his grofs Idolatry having fo provok'd the Almighty, that he not only permitted the revolt of divers and amongft others of Hadad but albeit Solomon had made a nearer alliance with the ^/Egyptian King, yet fo jealous was he of the Jevts extended Empire,, that probably he gavethe readier leave to depart', and fo envious at his wealth, that the ten tribes no fooner revolted under Jeroboam but the Egyptian King by that weakening, or rather as a further chaftifement from the Lord for the Apoftaiie of the Land overrun Rehoboams Kingdome, and defpoiled Jernfalem of all the treafure it had, and carried thence all Solomons {hiclds of Gold. Notwithftanding which it was reduced under Jehofaphat, in whofe reign there was no King in Edom a Deputy being King, 1 Reg. 22. 47. the Deputy or Prorex 'tis likely being fubftituted by the Judean King, whofe Navy prepared to go for Ophir was broken in pieces for aifociating with Ahaz^ia King of Jfrael. But in his Son Jehoram's time Edom rebelled and appointed themfelves a King ^ whom albeit he beat afterwards in the field, and that Ama^iah alfo gave them a notable defeat in the Valley of Salt, and that Vaziah (who is alfo called Azariah) fucceeding his Father Amaz.iah hm\t Eloth and reft or ed it to Judah 2 Reg. 14.22. It appears not in fto- ry either facred or prophane, that any of their fhips continued the Voyage to Ophir, or that any commerce was from this Sea in the fucceeding Ages. But it is evident that about 300. yeavs after Jehofaphat iy£gypt was by Cambyfes fubjeded under #ie Per fan Scepter, and fo continued till the time ot Darim Nothm, at which time the Egyptians broke the Per- fian Yoak, but were fubdued 50 years after by Ochm the 8.

Indeed I think there are not hotter places in the World than the Redfca and Per fan Galph about Or mm when the Sun dit plays his Beams, during the Summer Soiftice^, for then the Earth inflames equally with the Air: And Experience teaches us, that the heat not only under the Equinox, but the Tropiques when the Sun comes to the Vertex, is much more intenfe and violent (notwith- Handing the long Nights) than it isabout the Polar Circles ^ albeit for near fix months together the Sun fets not, but conftantly keeps his circuit above that Horizon.

Whether Gufurat take name from the Sura, whom Pliny places here or that it comply with the GV^Idiom rfo- or be denominate from Gez .Hr at, which in the ^r^Vifignifies an Ifle, Iqueftion not^ but this without doubt, that a Province itisfo ufeful to the Mogul as that his annual Tribute here amounts (as Merchants fav) to 150 Tun of Gold at this day. 'Tis a Town ofthe greateft note and trade 'Klndia % which it has acquired but of late-, for'tis fcarce 100 years ago when Antonio Sylverio a Tortugmje with. 200 Men entred and burnt it, fince which the Town is fo increaled, both with Building and Inhabitants, that afar greater force, would now find it a hard enter- pnze. After that Anno Dom. 1566. which is of the Hegira 946. by valour of who defeated the confederacy of Mir^a chan, Hujfan, Mir m Mahomet, Chan Go- ga and other confpirators, it was made fubjed to Ecbar the great Mogul. Now 'tis un der a quiet government: watered with a fweet River named T a$ee (or Tindy) (as broad as the Thames at Windfor ) which arifing out of the Decan Mountains glides through Bramfore (220 miles diftant thence) and in.Menders runs by.the' Walls of Snrrat, and after 20 little miles circumgyring or playing to and fro, a league from Swa/ley Road dif- cnarges it felf into the Ocean. 'Tis circled with a mud-wall, and hath a large Cattle of Stone .built at the SOuth-weft-fide, the River waihing it *, planted with great Ordnance, and awed by a Garrifon who make dainty to admit ftrangers to fee their fortifications: The Weft opens into the Bttzxar through a fait Gate of Stone, where Toll-gatherers are* every day ready to fearch and exad: a cuftomary Tribute for the Mogul their Mafter : The Medon is of no great beauty, nor do the Shops give more than common fplendor - the Bannyandefiring rather to be rich indeed, than fo accounted. The Houfes are indif- lerent beautiful} fome (as to the outfide) are of carved Wood, others of Bricks dryed in the Sun : the Englijh and Dutch Houfes at the North-end excell the other for Ipace and lurniture. The Suburbs have three Pofterns pointing out three feveral ways ^ one. to Fariaw and Camhaya, a fecond to Br amp ore, the third to Nanfary ten courfes thence , whence is the Road to Gundavee, Balfac, and Daman upon the Ocean.

When thefe four youths had confumed fome years in thofe contrary quarters of the' world whither Fate direded them •, all four became equally mindful of tneir firft home, defirous to vifit their Parents *, not only to propagate there and furnilh that Meditullium of the Earth, but to recount their memorable fortunes and adventures. After much toil they arrived at the place from whence they came, each of them attended by a troop of their own off-fpring. 'Tis too great a labour to defcribe the joy and mutual embraces paft 'twixt them and their aged Parents, revived by this good hap from the benumming froft of old age} as alfo the reciprocal kindnefs and love that was amongit tiie four Travellers'; a dull fenfe may eafily comprehend it was without the leaft mixture of dif- content or malady. Notwithftanding, to fhew no fummum honnm can be had in tliisiife, inprocefsoftime (the ilfue of thefe four multiplying) the world began to iole her vir- gin-purity *, difcord, pride and rapine mingling amongft them v fo as brotherly love was laid aiide *, no appearance being now but of violence and voluptuoufnefs. For Brmon grows idle and carelefs inhis devotion. Cattery becomes infolent and alpiring, regard ing neither the venerable admonition of his Parents, nor the dignity ot Bramon nis eider Brother. Shuddery alfo invents deceit, neither regarding juftice nor equity, but de lights in cheating nis other Brethren. Wyfe alfo grows unthrifty in a good confcience, baniihing his innate honefty to entertain riot; For which, his cruel Brother Catury do mineers, impoling fuch burthens upon the Countrey-man that Wyfe is now the oujed of calhiered not, and the abjed of his Lordly Brother*, who alfo picks a quarrel with Shuddery and admits not of any reconciliation till the Poor Merchant had latisfied his Avarice with half his itore fo that fuch hate and fear grew amongft ? em tnat all their Deligns were involved in dark confufion. Now though deceit, riot and tyranny fway a while, an all-feeing Majefty fits aboye, who in his own time retaliates in the extremity and obliquity of juftice. So it hapned: For upon a fudden, when they were moit ex- ercifed in villany and leaft dreamt of an account, God robes himfelf with clouds and fiaihes terrour *, whereat the Seas multiply their noife andfwell fo formidably that they threaten an univerfal deluge: In the interim, the people are amazed with horrible cracks of thunder and fuch thick flalhes of lightning, that the entrails of the earth feem to galp and quake with terrour : which done, in a moment the fea breaks o'reher bounds, and in filence fweeps away all creatures upon the earth, purging thereby the nafty Imell of their pollution. But God, who delights in Mercy his great attribute, repenting him of his feverity, refolves again to furniih the earth with a new generation repleat with more purity and perfedion. To which end he defcends and upon the high mountain called Meropurbatee commands to rife up, who (though till then uncreated) obeyed, and forthwith worlhipped his Maker. In like fort, at two other calls came up fiflney and Rudder^ who performed their obeyfance. Bremaw had power given him to create other creatures ^ had order to preferve them and Rnddery flrength to maifacreand be Gods exe cutioner, by infliding death, plague, famine, difeafes, war and the like mifchiefs. Accord ing to this appointment, thefe three new created Lords manage their particular ini- ployment, to each of them a fet period of time being allotted to live upon earth: For Bremaxv at the end of the fecond Age in a fiery Chariot was tranflated : Viftney conti nues double his time and then dies, leaving the lifue to Riiddcry (at the end of three times fo long commorance) to deftroy the world, and to tranflate the fouls of good men into a Garden of ravilhing delights, Elyfinm. But ere this was accomplifhed, it is fit to acquaint you how Bremaw came to furnilh the earth with more inhabitants. The Shafter tells us that as Bremaw was ruminating how to ad, fuddenly he fell into a deep fleep or trance, and upon recovery felt his body troubled beyond meafure, purporting fome immediate alteration: Nor did his apprehenfion deceive him 5 for lo, forthwith hisr amy am Religion.Eaft-lndia. body begun to fwdl, yea, fo great anguift to afflift him, that in all points it re fembled a womans travel , and indeed it had Analogy, in that his bowels began to ex' tend more and mpreandhisdolourto hcreafe, till (after great toil) thefecondfwelling found vent, broke, and delivered their burthen, being two Twins, of each whnm heneeded notgive fuck unto, in that by like miracle they immediately grew up toa pef fed ftature, and were miraculoufly furnilhed with language and education 7JnL the Parent named them Ma,i.-nv and Ceteroupa, whom after he had blelfed he fent Fall: rr&gt; the great mountain Momderpurvool, where ftraightway brought forth thr-e more fons and as many daughters: the Boys Ihe called and Soomermt-,U\tGit\tiCammah, Sounerettaw, and Sumhoo. Tile eldeft fon and dankt-pr went Welt to a mountain called the two feconds North to k^rrte t^ laft of each fex to Siifar •, where they fo generated that they quickly peopled each thei r nna r ter. Which done, God perceiving the' hearts of men enclined tTall for s of Sin to give them direchons how to live vertuouny and avoid temptation, he left Heaven a while, and alighting on the high Mount thither he call'd to whom he fpake many things out of a duskie darK cloud, now and then flafhing glimpfes of his Majefty; acquaintmg him why he deftroyedthe firft world, their finsprovoSng hl « 5 ^ W K aS rel0l T e . d ne , ve t r 10 do fo again : to that end he delivered a Book (the Shafierhy name) divided into three Trafts, dedicated to the three Caftsi the firit containing Moral Precepts; the fecond the ceremonies of Worlhipf the third a divihon of them into three, with peculiar inftrudions to each .Calt or Tribe Their Moral Law (read and taught them by out of the has eight Com- raandments i (moll: of which agree withthe feven which Rabbi fay^XauX the World in his time, called the Noahcady.) wjsxvwb [augni: tures Til0U n0t deftr0y ailSr livinS creal;ure i for Aon and it are both my crea- 2.

Notwithllanding, alloftiiem believe the Metempfychofis of Pythagoras, whofe onceits we will parallel by and by with thefe Bannyans. In this place drawing; vour judgment ta a remembrance of what is already related: wherein we may perceive the aeiuhon Satan charms them with, whofe cuilom it hath ever been to ered to himfelf ormipand Idolatry inibme things (to make 5 em more authentical) cohering withthe oiy or our Bible and in imitation of the Jews. Now that this Shafier of the Bannyans 15 a depraved Story of the Bible, either introduced by fome Jews liich time as Solomon iraaed to Ofhtr (near thefe parts*,) or from the Father of Lies, who ufually didates ms Servants, is plain.

And by Baekiel, chap.S. verfe 20. the Houfe of Judah for this kind of Idolatry was reproved. Above all, their Idolatry to Pagods (or Images oMeformed demons) is obfervable: Placed thefe Idols are in Ghappels commonly built under the Bannyan Trees, (or that which Linfchot calPd Arbor de Rays, or Tree of Roots', Sir Walter Raleigh Ficm Indicm; like that whichcalls Ceiba, growing in the Weft-Indies', or that the Spaniards cal) Gorda) a Tree of fuch repute amongft 'em, that they hold it impiety to abufe it, either in breaking a branch or otherwife defacing it, but contrarily they adorn it with Stream ers of Silk,and Ribbons of all forts of colours. The Pagods are s of fundry refemblances, in fuch lhape as Satan vifibly appears unto them- Sedulm, lib. 4. Carm. fays well. imagine falfa Vifibus humanis Magic as tribuerefigHras. Ugly-faced, with long black hair, goggled eyes, wide-mouth'd, with forked beard*, every way fo mif-fhapen and horrible as fomewhat refembles the old obfcene forms of Pan and Friapus. Under thefe Trees they aduate their Idolatrous devotion: there they pay their Tythes and Offerings, receive the undion and fprinklings of fundry colour'd Powders: there they perform Ceremonies, notice being given by the found of a little Bfell: there they re peat their Orifons, make Proceffions, fmg and perform many Myfteries *, yea, fo nu merous grew their Idol Temples, that (till the Mulfulmen mixt among them) each Vil lage had its feveral Pagod, many of which to this day are ftanding. One of the chief in Induftan was that at Variaw near Surrat ; another at Nigracut, where the Dewry is feel'd and paved with Gold, yearly vifited by many 1000 Bannyans, who in way ofdevotiorl have ufed to cut out part of their Tongues as a Sacrifice, and whereby to fpeak the Sib* boleth better ever after. In Jagannat a Town in Bengala is another of their Dewrys or Idolatrous Temples where for feven days a Feftival is annually obferved: during which the Pagod is by the Tokires expofed to publick view, and in triumph carried through the Streets', an Idol of a monftrous Ihape, placed upon a Chariot with eight wheels, drawn by above icq Indians, who in great fwarms repair thither in devotion, and fome out of Zeal call themfelves in th e way and are crulht to death, hereby exprelfmg a volun tary Sacrifice to the Devil. At Tamjferi alfo fometimes 100000 Indians go naked into Ganges, and bowing their Bodies, with their hands they throw the water aloft as an Offering to the Sun, which they worlhip; others of note are at Bannaras upon Ganges, at Bcbarpore, Jallamexa, Blab as. Sib ah and other places.. Part of their Religion confifts in. invocating holy Men famoufed for vertue. Howbeit the Cow is ofmoft efteem with them: They have the Cyrenian or (Egyptian Goddefs for an example, the Image of a Cow, which fignifiedthe Tillage that preferved them (by Serapis, i.e. pru dence)'Bannyans Religion.EaftAndia. 5i dence) from that memorable Famine mentioned in Genefis. In Wars the Cutteries or Radieas only call upon Bemohem ; the rich upon Mycajfer the poor upon Syer, the la bourers upon Gunner \ the married upon Hurmounts &amp;c 4 Moreover, they afFed Pilgri mages to Rivers, efpecially Gonga as they call Ganges which is more venerable than any other, in that (as they fay) Bremm frequented it, and that it has (at Siha, where it fprings out of a Rock) a Head in form of a Cow ( which they little lefs than worfhip, not only in refped of her fruitfulnefs but in imitation (it may be) of the ^£ayptian Apis a py'd Ox-,) Idolatry fo notorious, that it feems ftrange, what Eufehm in his 6. lib. of Evang .prap.cap. 9. affirms, That the by their Laws prohibit Murder, Adultery, and adoration of Idols *, That the Brachmans eat not any thing animate, drink no ftrong li quor, are fr^e from paffion, imploy their time in the whole fervice. of the great God^ avoiding the adoration of Idols: Albeit there are Indians in the fame Region, who de file themfelves with idolatry, and fuch vices as moft Nations puniih: Yda, the Perfians by a Law did allow of inceftuous Marriages •, which was fo loathfome to the neighbour Na tions as they branded them with the Name ofrMagnfees, than which a more odious Name could not be given any. But how much thefe places are now altered from thofe Cuftoms will appear by the obfervation we fhall make in travelling amongft thofe Nations. To return: Thefe Bannyans walh oft, and thereby fuppofe themfelves purified from fin (and dirt j) in requital enriching her Womb with Gold and Jewels, hoping to thrive the* better; efpecially, when they are fick, thirfting to have their mouths moiftned with a drop of that holy water *, which is no lefs valuable than if it immediately flowed out of Paradife. In Baptifm the Priefts Children and Merchants (that isto fay Bramins and Bannyans) anoint with Oyl, and cleanfe with Water: The prophaner fort as they call Men of War and Manufadures have only Water with the point of a Pen oppofed to their Forehead, as wifhing that God would write good things there *, to which the company fay Amen, Their Marriages are fometimes at feven years old, but cohabit not till ten; if any dye unmarried, they conclude him unhappy fo that oft-times they marry them when dead, afore they be buried. An opinion probably borrowed from the Hebrews of old, whofe Rabbins, from that Precept to Adam mentioned in 1. Gen. 28. Crefcite &amp; mdtiplicamim &amp; replete t err am, make this inference or comment upon the Text, Qni matrimonium non con- trah/mtj partem non habent in iecdofuturo \ the unmarried have no part or portion in the World to comeadding withal, Homoy qui non habet Uxorem, Homo non efi: a polition the Bramin makes ufe of, to juitifie their Marriage Cuftome. The Marriage-ceremonies are not many nor friv olous; the Boy rides about the Town attended with luch little ones as can ride, robed with Jewels, Scarfs, &amp;c. one day, the Bride the next with a like train of Virgins no lefs richly attired; The Bride and Bridegroom are known and di- ftinguifhed from the reft by their Coronets, the Ceremonies are celebrated by Kettle- arums, Trumpets, Pageants and the like. The Bride has no Money Portion, for they hold it contemptible ; only fome Jewels and Dinaes of Gold, fuch as they that day are attired with j (I dare not fay, thofe '£JV*V or Marriage-gifts mentioned by Homer. g. mad. Suidas and others.) The Wedding is thus: A Fire is interpofed, intimating the purity and heat of their affections, a lilken ftring circles both their bodies as the Hiero- glyphick of Wedlock; then a Linen Cloath is put betwixt them, in token that till then they were unknown to one another in nakednefs. This done, the Bramin -blelfes them, prays thatihe may prove as gentle and fruitful as a Cow , the Cloth is torn away^ the ftring untied, and then they are one anothers ever after. Thefe never marry out of their own Cafts *, Bramins marry the Daughters of Bramins ; Cuttery's the Daughters of Cut- ^fs j Shuddery's, Shudderfs and Wyfes not only fo, but alfo compere in their own Trades, as Taylors, the Daughters of Taylors •, Barbers, Barbers Daughtersi d'c. And, contrary to the cuftome of Mahometans y their Wives live not under much fubjedion. In ficknefs they call upon Marrawn (an Epithete of God) exprefling mercy: If they perceive he is going the way of all flelh, then they open his hand and moiften it with holy water, water of Ganges. When dead, they wafh the Carcafs and carry it lilently to the water-fide, where they utter two or three words to that Element, then burn his body in fweet Wood or Spices which as earth mixes with the Corps, and throwing the allies into the River think they have given every Element his peculiar due, andfo depart well fatisfied. The Prieft prefents his Son the Roll of hisdeceafed Fore-Fathers, and bids him fulfil the Ceremonial Law of deploring for ten days, neither uling his Wife, laughing, eating Opium nor Betele-, putting on no clean Cloaths nor Oyl on's head, but that day Month yearly ever after make a Feaft, and pay a complemental vifit to that River which drunk his Fathers Afhes.

The emeries atfume a greater liberty ^ for being men of War they fcruple not to flied blood, eat flefli, and to appear libidinous 5 they are for the moft part called Rajaes or great men^ have fix and thirty Cafts, from fome of which none of them but is de- fcended : Of thefe are the Tribes of Dodquchaes, fome being Chaw ah, fome Solenkees, fome Famlaes, fome FieUtters&amp;nd fome par amors : Of long times they have been Owners of Indofmh the lalt of which by Jladin a P.otan King of Delly, had wrefted from him G hzjjiym fince when, moft of the remainder is taken away' from them by the lifue of -Tamerlane : At this day they call themfelves Rafyootes (or Sons of Kings) and live law- lefs to the Moors j the chief of which, at this day, are Rana Radgee Mardout, Radga Surmul-gee-, Rata BermftaWy Mahohet-chan-, Radta Barmidgee, Radge a Rammgar, Radgea Jooh\Jefjinghy T^ettcrfmg, and Manfmgk And thefe being for the greateft part mountaineers are rude and of a more warlike dilpofition than thofe civilized Indians that live in Cities, and inhabit the Champain Countries*^ and thence it is that they va lue neither the Rotans nor the Bullochesy which be the fighting men among Mahometans. ^ The Shudderyes or Bannyans are Merchants, and (contrary to their name, which fignk fies harmlefs) are the moft crafty people throughout India. Full of phlegmatick fear they be and fuperftition: They are indeed merciful, grieving to fee other people fo hard-hearted as to feed uponFifh, Flelh, Raddifh, Onions, Garlick, and fuch things as either have life or refemblance of blood. They for their parts will not kill fo much as a Loufe, a Flea,' aKakaroch, or the like, Non ufm erat oarnium ante diluvium &gt; faith Co- mefior ; but contrariwife buy their liberty of fuch Sailors, and others, as of neceffity muft crulh them: yea, they have Hofpitals for old, lame, fick orftarved Creatures, Birds, Beafts, Cats, Rats, or the like*, and have no worfe men to overfee them than the Rnfielansy the belt refpeded forts of Bramins.

And in juftification of this.opinion they have the beft learned amongft the Heathens, no iefs than Plato himfelf for their mftrudor; who to perfwade men that the Soul was im mortal, and that there was poena and premium after this life, feigns the Metempfycho s of the fouls of men into Bees and Ants, if good; into Wolves and Dogs, if badj &amp;c. which neverthelefs he profeffes he neither believes for truth himfelf, nor takes for any other than a Fidion. ♦ ^ * Thq%eligton of the 'Perfees EattAndia. 5 ? The laft Sed or Caft of Gentiles are the Wifes, a name, albeit derived from Wife the youngeft fon of Pourous and Parcootee, yet in their tongue properly fignifies a labour ing man : Thefe be of two forts, the Wife arid the Cootee', the firft agrees with the nyan in abftinence f the other of late years not forbearing to eat any manducable Crea ture *, the purer fort are fubdivided into other 3 6 Cafts. The refult of all is, that thefe four Cafts in time grew fo impious that God required Riiddery to command ablaft of wind to fweep away that Generation y which accordingly he did : That tempeft raged fo violently that the Mountains and Rocks were hurled and tolfed to and fro like duft or tennis'-balls •, the Seas were turned out of their courfe, yea holy Ganges out of her Channel, wherein all (fave a very few honeft men and women which were fpared and left to replenilh) in that tempeft perifhed: this was the fecond confufion. Soon after, God gave them a King (propagated from the feed of the Bray* myns) called Ducerat who begat Ram, fo famous for piety and high attempts, that to this day his name is honoured v infomuch that when they fay Ram Rame, 'tis, as if they fhould lay, All good betide \on. Now to Ihew the imbecillity of mans nature, in procefs of time the world again grew abominable; fo that Ruddery commands the earth to open and fwallow down quick thofe ungodly wretches, a few excepted, who the third time people the Earth with humane Inha bitants; Then (as Bremavo had formerly) Fiftney the Mediator of mercy afcended flike another Aflrea) into Heaven, hming Rnddery to over-rule this Age of Iron-, at the end of which he alfo will be rapt into Paradife. Thefe four Ages they call Curtain^ Viu anper, Tetrajoo, and Kolee. Touching the laft Judgment they hold it fhall be more dreadful than the other •, the Moon will look red as blood, the Sun will fhed his light like purling Brimftone *, after which will follow an universal flalhing of fire with loud thunders •, then a flamy rednefs will orefpread the Heavens, and the four Elements (of which the world confifts) fhall maintain a dreadful fight, fo long and fo fiercely one againft another, that at laft all will be revolved into a dark confufion.

A Religion, if 1 may fo call it, deduced from the reign of Guftafy who was King of Perfia Anno Mmdi 3500, before our Saviours Incarnation 5Q0 years, written in their %mdavaftavp(Qi Law-book) tothispurpofo Such%eUgion of theTerf in Such time as Gnftafy (the 14 King of Perfm from Knyomarra^ by fome thought Noah) fwayed the Imperial Scepter, it chanced that Efpntaman and Dodoo two poor people, man and wife, by extradion, lived long together in good repute,. but without Fortunes bleffings, either as to Eftate or Children: Howbeit, upon fiodooes prayer a Son was given her ^ who in his conception promifed (by lome rare and tearful dreams the mother hatched) great matters, not only to the aftonifnment of his parents, but amazement of the C/wMKing, who (out of jealoulie and difpofition to credit any report) fought to prevent all danger by killing or poyfoning him ; but (to fliew a luperior pow er fways, and never miifes to accomplilh its deiigns though by man never lo mucn op pugned) nothing could do him harmyet fearing his parents ruine, and to eafe tne King of his fear, they content to give China a farewel, and feek a lecurer abode in a re gion more remote, where they might more freely live and meditate. Far they travelled, many rare things they faw, paft over many great Rivers on foot; for Zertoofi (fo was this young Prophet named) turned them into folid Ice, and after thawed them at his pleafure, and many rare adventures found, fall which are here omitted, in that Religion is the mark we fhoot at) not flaying long in any place till they arrived in Perfia, where they refted and intended to fettle. Zertoofl (as good men ufe) Ipent molt of his time in meditation : but obferving the diforder of mens living, forrow overcame him ^ and finding the place he was in not fit for Revelations, away he goes, without reftingtill he came into a dark Valley which was obfcured by two lofty Moun tains, afolitary and fit place for meditation. There he ingeminates his murmurs, with dejected eyes, erected hands, and knees bended ^ when lo, an Angel whofe face was more corufcant than the Sun, in this manner falutes hin. Hail Zertoofl ! man of God, what wouldeft thou ? Who ftraight replies, The prefence of God, and that I may receive his will and diredions how to inftrud my Nation. His prayer was readily granted, his body purged, his eyes fealed and wrapt up. Being paft the Element of Fire and the high er Orbs (as faith their Zmdavaftow) he was prefented before a Supreme who was arrayed with fuch refulgent glory that (till he had Angels eyes put into his. head) he could not gaze upon fiich a daz'ling Majefty. There he received his Laws (no place but Heaven will ferve to fetch Philofophy from, toconverfe with men writes to Socrates) uttered by the Almighty, (whofe words were encompafled with flames of Fire',) fuch Laws, fuch Secrets, as fome of them are not to be promulgated. Zertoofl hdotz his return makes this requeft, that he might live fo long as the World endured, in that protrad of time the eafier to make all the people of the earth imbrace his dodrine: but his fimplicity being pitied, and in a Mirrour the reflex of time, Lucifer's craft, mans mifery, and other myfteries reveal'd, foon altered his vain defire •, fo that having wor- fhipped, and taken the Zmdavaflaw in his left hand, with fome celeftial Fire in his right, by Bahaman Vrnfoaufpan his good Angel, (who cleft the air with his golden wings) he was (as in a trice) fet down in that fame valley where the fpirit formerly found him. Zertoofl having thus armed himfelf againft temptations, bidding his Hermitage farewel travels homeward to publilh his Law. Satan (who all the while looked afquint upon. Zertoofl) labours to feduce him, and after a fhort excufe for his rude intrulion. pro- felles himfelf his unfeigned friend, afluring him the other Angel had deluded him*, that God in no wife delighted mthZertoofls dzhgn fufRciently expreifed as much by fuffering him to withdraw fo quickly, the denying his requeft argued Gods negled of him *, his travel to reclaim the world was vain, mens minds fo doted upon pleafure*, his Book wasftuft with lies, and that in publilhing it ihame would be his reward *, his Fire was a mercilefs Element ufelefs in thofe hot Regions: Concluding, that if Zertoofl would de pend upon him he would furniih him with all delights, honours and pleafures imagina ble, give him power to do miracles, fo as he might be worfhipped as a God; which if he refufed he was but fimple and in no wife worthy his charity. Zertoofl perceiving the tempter was no better than Lucifer, bad him avoid; and to his addition of terrour call to mind how by his impiety he loll Heaven, and how malice made him defirous to draw others into like damnation ^ the Book he fo fcoft at fliould condemn him, that Fire torture him and all fuch black-mouth'd detradors as himfelf. Whereupon the Fiend vaniflied *, and Zertoofl at length arrived where he found his Pa rents who receivedhim with unexpreffible gladnefsto whom he imparted his paffed for tunes and intentions. Dodoo his Mother imagining it a crime unexpiable that fo excel lent a Prophet ihould longer be concealed, grew fo tranfported that without longer circumH ance fhe blazons abroad the fcory of her dreams and his conception, enthufl- afms, vifions, the excellency of his Book, and the authority he had to publifh it. The people admire what they, heard j fo as Gnflafp the Perfian King having notice thereof i and%eligion of the Terfee EaUAnclta. and defiring to fee the man, and enquire into the truth, fends for him-, and after fome difcourfe is lo well fatisfied, that forthwith wavering in his former Relhrion he iudsre, Zertoofls better. Which Hidden perfwafion fo dejected the Arch-flamen, that he forth with invents all ways poflible to reclaim the King. To effeft it, firft he bribes Servants to convey under his Bed the bones of dead Carcafes, things hateful to the Terfian ; and then polfelfes the King that this ftranger was a banifhed man of an im pure converfation, witnefs the Huffing the Bed he flept upon. The King hereuDon being brought to view that nafty deceit, and finding the report true, firft abominates him and then Ihuts him into a loathfome dungeon : but this mifery of his endured nof for the King having aHorfe of grear account deadly ill, propofes great rewards to any could recover him: none durft undertake it fearing the penalty, till ving him a drink recovers himan ad fo acceptable to that the Prophet was received into grace again, whereby he had the readier way to difcover the Flamens knavery, and having tlms vindicated his own integrity, had the opportunity to p ib- lifh his dodnne, which by fome^ miracles intermixt, was efpecially by the vulgar fort credited. j j &amp; It chanced that the King (either ftimulated by his Church-men or judging able to do any thingj calls for him, profeffing his propenfity to be of his Religion conditionally he would grant -him four things; Firft, that he might never dye v Second ly, that he might afcend Heaven and defcend as often as he lifted ; Thirdly, that he might know what God had done and intended; Fourthly, that his body might be in- vulnerable. v j o ~ Zemojt amazed at thefe unreafonable demands, and perceiving it otherwife impofli ble to have his Dogmata's received, tells the King, That for one man to have all thofe properties was to be God more than man; that the King fhould have the liberty to chufe any one for himfelf, and the other three fhould be diftributed to any other three he Ihould pleafe to nominate. Which being accepted, makes the fecond his choice, that he might afcend and defcend at pleafure; to know the fecrets of Heaven was granted to the Kings Church-man-, to live for ever was conferred upon (the Kings eldeft Sonj who (they fay) lives yet upon Vamoan's high Mountain, guar ded by thirty Spirits to forbid others the entrance, and left by fetting foot upon that holy ground they alfo Ihould live for ever: to be free from hurt was granted the Kings youngeft Son: After which the Zmdavaftaw was opened, the new-broach'd Doctrine read, and univerfally accepted of. The Zmdavaflaw then has a three-fold divifion •, the firft treats of Judicial Aftrology, called Afloodegery and committed to the care of thofe they call jefopps, i. e. w/• The fecond of Natural Philofophy is ftudied by theHackeams, i. e- Phyfitians : Thelaftis a compound of Religion named (from the Inventor) Zemofi, kept by the Daroos, i. e. Predicants: Each of which three contain feven Chapters. The Zcrtoofl alfo confifts of three parts, pointing at three feveral forts of Men, Lay men, Clergy, and Arch-bilhop: to every of them it enjoins an increafe of Command ments-, to the firft fort five', to the fecond eleven-, to the third thirteen. The Behedim or Lay-mens Precepts are five, i. To cherilh fliamefac'dnefs-, a vertue deterring all forts of ugly vices, as pride, revenge, theft, adultery, drunfcennefs, and perfidy. 2. Tocherifli fear. 3. To pre meditate what they are to do -, that if bad, they may rejed; if good, obferve it. 4. Each days firft objed to be a memento of Gods love to urge their gratitude. 5. To pray daily to the Sun, and nightly to the Moon, as the two great Lamps and WitnefTes which be moft oppollte to the Devil who delights in darknefs. The eleven given to the Herbaodsy Daroos or Priefts to pradifeare thele (the other alfo of the Behedin they obferve *,) 1. To be conftant to that form of worihip in the Zm- davafiaw mentioned. 2. Not to covet what belongs to another. 3. To abhor lies. 4* Not to be worldly minded. 5. To learn the Zmdavaftaw by rote. 6. Tokeepthem- felves free from pollution. 7. To forgive injuries. 8.

That whenfoever God communicates his goodnefs to him by nightly Villon he is to admire his mercy and to keep them fecret. 13. That Pyre e be ever kindled till Fire deftroy the llniverle, and that he pray over it. This is the fum and fubftance of the Zmdavafi which Zertooft brought from Heaven. A word of their Feafts, Falls, Wed dings, and Burials. They are tolerated molt forts of Meat*, neverthelefs (in obedience to the Mahome tan andBannyan, 'mongil whom they live) they refraiji Beef and Hogs-flefh *, howbeit the Rafhboots eat the laft. They feldom feed together, left they might participate ope anothers impurity *, Each has his own Cup, fb as if any of his own Caft chance to ufe it, the other wafhes it three times and forbears it a while after. Six folemn Feftivals they yearly obferve the firit called MedUferum is kept the 15. of Fov or 'February j 2. Petn- fahan on the 26. of Shernar or Jlprii 3. Tatrism on the 26. of Mahar or May) 4. Mede- anm on the 16. of Deh otAuguft 5. Homefpetamadnm on the 30. of Syindamud or Oclo- ber) 6. Median on the 11. of Jdehefe or December ; all of them in memory of the Cre ation and monthly benefits. After each of thefe Feafts they eat but one fmall meal a day for five days after •, and whenfoever that Lay-men eat any Flelh, they bring part to their Eggaree or Temple to pacifie the Lord, in that for their fuftenance the lives of thofe good Creatures are annihilated. Now concerning the Fire they adore, 'tis in me mory of that which Zertooft hronght from Heaven *, wherein they memorize the Veltals, or rather apilhly imitate the Jewtjh Law (the Devil as near as may be defiring to counter feit the belt) in Levlt.ch.o.v. 13. where'tis commanded that the Fire (that came from Heaven) fliould be ever burning upon the Altar, and never go out. And as to this Fire- worihip, we find in Story that it has been more anciently ufed in Perfia than what is here afcribed by the Zundavaft to Zertoofts time ^ being probable, that as the Grecians bor rowed that Idolatry from the Per/tans, fofrom the Greeks was it borrowed by the Veftal Romans. In Perfia they had many Pyree *, moltof which were deftroyed by Heraclim the Roman Emperor, during his Wars with Kozjrhoes (at which time Mahomet ferved in his Army.) Some to this day are remaining, having (as they report) the Idolatrous Fire from 1000 years unextinguilhed. In India alfo the banifht Perfee have their Eggarees one of Which is at Nancery^ whofeFire has continued this 200 years, if report fay true. Where note, that this their Godfire is not compofed of common combuftibles, as Wood, Straw, Coals, Slates, &amp;c. nor blown by any Bellows, Breath of Man, wafting or like prophane things •, but compounded of Sparks flying from a hot burning temper'd Steel, and kindled either by Lightning from Heaven, or by Beams from a Burning-glafs, and the like ; for, fuch only-is proper for that their Antisheheraun or Idol-fire. But if it chance the Fire have need of cherilhing, the Diftoore and other Lay-men (at twelve foot diftance) furround their Deity, and after fome mimickgeftures thePriefts add fome fort of Fuel, and returning to the other people fall to their worfhip, befeech- ing that they may not only give it due reverence, but honour folemnly all other things that refemble it •, as Sun, Moon, Stars*, yea, and common Fire, which alfo they fo di vinely efteem of, that they hold it an impious thing to fpit upon it, throw water into it, or put it to any vile or unneceffary ufe*, but give a more than common refped to Wood, and fuch things as it receives life and vigour from. Ignis yerennis 'tis call'd by Strabo lib. 15. Ignis Dem ante omnes Per'ps habetWy Fire was principally worfhipt by the Per fans. JSfec Ignem in nfits ordinarios deftinatum yolluere audebant Per fee. immunditiis, not daring to pollute with any unclean thing the Fire appointed for common ufes, faith the Hiftorian. Now albeit thefe people fay their Anceftors firft pradifed this form of Worlhip, we find in Story that the Fire was in divine efteem with the Caldeans fuch time as Abram dwelt at Vr^ and then in equal veneration with the Per fans. This holy Fire was carried by the Flamens in the Van of the Army when J^ir 'ms fought atArbela againft Alexander, and continued un-put out for many Generations*, Epheftions Funeral ex cepted. Baptifm. The Baptifm of thefe Heathen Idolaters is of this nature: So foon as one is born, the Varoo is called upon*, who delays not, but being - inftruded in the precife time of his Nativity,T* erfees Religion in Easl-India. 5 j Nativity, calculates his Fortune: the Daroo gives the Name, the Mother aflenting to it This done, they together hafte to the Eggaree, where the Pneft puts a little water into the bark of a Tree, the name of which Holme the place it grows in TW, a City in VerCia not far fromSpaham^ TreeZertoofi blefred(and in this very memorable,if we may believe thefe people, that it never admits of any ftiadow; ) the water out of this hallowed rind being poured upon the Infant, a Prayer is then made that it may be cleanfed from impu rity. At feven years of age the Child is confirmed by the Daroo and taught to fay his Prayers over the Fire (but with a cloath faftned about his head which covers his mouth and noftrils left his finful breath might offend their Deity v) after which he drinks a lit tle cold water, chaws a Pomgranat leaf, walhes in a Tanck, cloaths his body with a' fine Shuddero reaching,to his wafte, ties a zone of Cuihee about his loins woven with Inkle of the Herboods making, (which he wears ever after*,) andafter afhort Prayer that he may never prove an Apoftate, but continue a Fire-worihipper 5 that he may eat no mans meat, nor drink any mans drink but his own *, he is ever after reputed a true Believer. Their Marriages are diflinguifhed into five orders. 1. Shaulan, which is a marrying Mmiaget of two young Children, agreed upon by the Parents unknown to the Children *, the ver- tue being, that if either dye they go to Heaven. 2. Chockerfon, which is a fecond mar riage. 3. Codejherahafan, when the Woman is her own chufer. 4. Eeksan, when a dead body (not being married before) is to one alive married. 5. Ceterfon, when ha ving no Sons he adopts his Daughters Son, &amp;c. The Ceremony is this; At midnight the Daroo or Prieft enters the Houfe (for they wed not in Churches) and finds the Bride and Bridegroom placed upon a Bed together *, oppofite to each, two Church men ftand with Rice in their hands (the Emblem of fruitfulnefs0 when firft one lays his fore finger on the Brides fore-head, and asks if ihe be willing to take that man to be her Hus band who faying yea, the like rite and queftion is by the other Prieft made to the man *, who after the like anfwer makes a promife to enfeoff her in a certain number of Dyna's to which in a grateful manner the Bride replies, fhe and all fhe has are his: the Priefts thereupon throw Rice upon their heads, praying that they may multiply as Rice: the Womans Parents give the dowry, and eight days are ufually fpent in jovial merriment. Their Funerals thefe: They neither burn nor bury their dead ^ but having firft put the BuriaU. body into a winding-fheet, all the way as they pafs towards the Grave his kindred beat their breafts, but with little noife, till they come within 50, or 100 paces of the burial- place: where the Herbood meets them, ufually attired in a yellow Scarf, and on his head wearing a thin Turbant. The Neceffelars or Bearers carry the Corps upon an Iron Bier (for Wood is forbidden in that it is dedicated to the Fire) to a little Shed, where (fo foon asfome myftiques areaded) they hoife it up to the top of a round Building, fome of which are twelve foot high, and eighty in circuit: the entrance is molt part at the N.

This alfo is remarkable (theStory whereof we fee painted in ZoW Palace) that King Babur thirfting after the Conqueft oi India dilguifed himfelf with thirty Noblemen in his company in the Habit of Kalenders or Fryars as if they were upon a Rummery or Pilgrimage, the better by this craft to efpy their advantage: but being in Delly (die greateft City of the Pot an King) could not lo conceal themlelves but that T^ecander the King difcovered them, and pardoned them upon condition they would fwear never to attempt the Conqueft during either of their lives. But when both were dead, Homayon f Babur 7 s Sun J entred and dilpoilelled Abram and Shec-Sha-Selym ( T&amp;ecander s Sons.) of the Crown. Howbeit, T^erchan a brave Bengalan Prince fights againft this new come Tar tar and defeats his Army near Ganges, forcing him into Perfia\ where he married the Kings Sifter ^ and with her and Byram-chan, in the head of twenty thoufand Horfe re- turnsj and being re-'feated in iMj/, is acknowledged King. • r ^ • Homayon Son of Babur great-grand-fon of Teymir-Lan or Tamherlain being re-mveited with the Imperial Diadem of Induftan by the alliftance of Tamas trte Perjian King, and returned triumphant by the overthrow of Tuer-chawn the intruding King of Pot an, who Anno Bom, 1550, and of the Hegira or Mahometan account 960. dyed difconfolate Ho mayon, for the better education of his eldeft Son Abdul-Fetta-Gelaladin-Mahomet, after wards called Ecbar, committed him to the care and truft ot Byrangano-ohaun, a perlon of great parts and generous endowments ^ foon after it chanced that being in an ^ ) P er6 z Sudden death of the M Room in his Palace at Dtlly 0 and chawing To much Opium as intoxicated his brains, hearing the Tinging Boys give notice from a high Tower that it was the time of-Prayer, the King making more hafte than good fpeed to the Chappel rmft his Itep, fo as he fell down forty ftairs, by which fall he was bruifed very lore, and after three days torment dyed j fuch was Homayirfs unhappy end: Neverthelefs he was with due folem- nity put into his Grave, here called an eternal habitation ; leaving Achhar his Son In heritor to his greatnefs and mifery. t.-nn.j-r A M &lt;&lt;22 Echar by help of Btyrmgano-Kmn and Chawn-Channa his ion, having nrit aiiappointed J. p.'r &lt; 52 fome Plots defigned by Ahdd-chavon to difturb the publick peace of that Kingdom, was A.Heg.901 zW due Ceremony crowned King in Delly ^ after which, he bent his endeavour to enlarge his Territories, and make known that he was verily the great-grand-fon of vidorious Teymirlan. In the firft place he takes revenge of Hemovo 'who had formerly chafed T nrdichan-, whofe head three months after by mifchance of war coming under command -of Bader-cham was cut off, and fet up in Delly &gt; which Province thereby was for fome time quieted. Then by Ally Coolichan he fubdues Boab (by fome called Sanbd) a Province furrounded by Jeminy and Ganges, the nobleft River in India. At that time Beyramgano-chan (otherwife called Byram-chan the Ferfian) aging faft, and tyred with the fopperies of this World, having well difcharged the truft repofed in him by his old Ma te, and not a little to his comfort obferving in his Pupil a Spirit fitted for the Govern ment of that Monarchy, obtains leave to fpend the refidue of his time at Mahomets Se pulchre, in contemplation : But (in his Roomery in the way to Medina) at Pat hang in Camhaya he was wounded to death by an obfcure flave of his, whofe father he had for merly ilain fo that by Ahdal Radgee his Son (then not fourteen years old) and a great and much afflided company this great Captain was brought back to Agray and there ho nourably buried. JLchar laments his death, though by Tome (how truly I know not) thought an Agent, but nothing can recover him: And the .better to forget his death he fpends fome time in building the Caille at Agra which was formerly of mud, but by him pulled down and fo altered for the better that now it fcarce admits a comparifon through all Afia •, 'tis of durable ftone, well polifhed; and fo fpacious, that it compre hends three miles circuit of ground; built upon the pleafant banks of Jeminy, compalfed • with a ftone wall, moated, and to be entrft by many Draw-bridges, having four ftrong Gates, fome Bulwarks and Counterfcarps without to make it more defenfive. Agra. Jlgray (Eaft from Surrat feven hundred and feventy miles Englijh) the Navel of the Moguls territories, and Emprefsof Cities in Induftan, haszS deg. 38 min. North lati tude, and is watered by Jeminy (Jomanes in Vliny, Hynamanes in Poly anus his 8. lib. Se- miramidis) which from Delly glides hither, and commixing with Ganges flows into the Bengalan Sea. Agra was of old (fay fome, but without good Authority) called Nagra, and ere that Dionyfia ; whence they imagine 'tvyas founded by Bacchus, Dionyfia being a compound word taken from Dios Jupiter his liippofed Father and Ny[a his Nurle ^ others call him Janus, (which caufes fome to imagine he was Noah, looking into the old and new World, and fo called by reafon of his Vine-planting, in Hebr. Jain fignifying Wine;) but when this Bacchus lived will be difficult to know, feeing Mdtos fuiffe Liheros, faid Diod. Sic. Howbeit, Fettiopore till of late (no longer than fifty years ago) bore away the fame. But otherfome there be imagine it took its name from the Conquering Agra- darus, as Cyrus was fir ft called, who from his own Name gave feveral places their deno mination. Others derive it from the River which from hence ftreamspleafant- ly into Ganges, as Arrian lib' de Indie is called it. Pliny mentions Agra founded by Agar the Mother of lfmael in Arabia, or India as others *, and fome derive the name from Agramenes a puiffant Prince who commanded that part of India when Alexander fought with Porus, as we read in Q. Curt, and others. Neverthelefs, in refped it's built, or rather increaft fince the Race of Tamerlane came thither, it may probably take its name from Agora which in the Tartar Tongue lignifies a Town of Carts new built, or Town of Wood, as Hacluyt,fol. 489. obferves concerning if, and agreeable to the Scy~ thique Towns, who feeing the Tartars have no fixt ftation want not a decorum in rank ing their .Carts fo as they refemble ftreets orderly difpofed. What ever the name was, the fhape is femilunary like London: the ftreets are many and long and narrow,but nafty; the City is leven^miles in circuity in part, walled about, and the Ditch fences the re mainder . From Agray to Lahore (moft of the way being through a fhade of Trees) are five hundred miles*, to are reckoned one thoufand; to Afmeer two hundred ; to Surat feven hundred and feventy, or thereabouts.

Echar glad of theoccafion, haftens with fifty thoufand Horfe againft him. Some months he Ipent in befieging this place*, but fo fruitlefly, that he rather attempts the conqueft an unufual way, undermining the Fort, and to the terrour ofthe befieged, blows the trains up with Powder ^ caufing fuch a breach, as himfelf and twenty thoufand men immedi ately entred pel-mel, with fuch hafte that the Rebel perceiving treaty of no value gathering in one his Family confumed himfelf and them in flames, to prevent the tor tures provided for him by Ecbar and Mardont his enraged Mafter. In this fort this fa mous Fort was taken, which Aladin by twelve years fiege could not do; A vidory fo great, that Ecbar caufes it to be expreft in fculpture at Agra. He had no time to forfeit of this vidory, receiving Letters from Rajea Bagwander Viceroy of Lahore-, that Mirz.a Mamet Hapee his brother with thirty thoufand Horfe out of Kabul, had attempted to prey upon Lahore: Echar delays no time, but with his Army prefents himfelf fo fudden- ly to the Enemy, that without any refiftance Mahomet flies away leaving his Camp to the mercy of Ecbar s Army. This occafion drew the King to view other places of defence, which he both bettered by his eye, and gave in charge to fuch as he could truft. He alfo takes a furvcy of Pang- Ob j out of which he is foon called by Letters from his mother then in Agra acquaint ing him with the Rebellion of Badnr-kam, Ally-Kooli-kawn and Zemaen wiio were lent that fpring againft the Patanians, whom in Doab they put to flight; atSambel alio, and at Lachnom got a greater vidory *, and three weeks after, at Joonpore utterly defeated them, fubduing to the Mogul all liich Provinces as lie ingirt 'twixt Ganges and Tfatfa *, conqueits of lb great note, that they grew efflated beyond meafure, conceiting all Induflan under like poffibility, and which they refolvedto make trial of. Butthe re ward and deltiny due toTraytors overtakes them : for Ecbar by fwift marches, long before the Rebels expeded him pitches his Tents on the Eaft or Jeminy (the River at Agra :) which ftruck the adverfe part with liich amazement, that as men ftruck with guilt, forfeiting the memory of their pafled vidories, they betook themfelves to a Ipeedy and fhameful flight', after whom Ecbar eagerly purfues, and after long purfuit, the heads are taken: Allyculi-cawn alfo was trodden under foot by the Horle, and Badnr^ cum (by Ecbars command and in his light) was itrangled. This done, Ganganna is lent to Joonpore againft MirutSulyman, and the King retreats to Agra : where he fancies a pilgrimage to Afineer albeit a hundred and thirty courfe or two hundred Englijh miles jfmeer . diftant thence*, fancying, that by invocation of Mandee a reverent Hodges or Dilciple of Mahomet y he ftiould obtain fome ilfue mafculine. Accordingly, after much foot-toil, (at every miles end a fair ftone being pitcht to reft upon, which as yet remain,) he gets thither where bare-foot very devoutly entreats dead Mandee for Children. This is a Prophet of great fame in thofe parts, and through the liberality of fome devoted Prin ces there intombed in a ftately monument, graced with three fair Courts, each of which is paved with ftone, the outfide Fabrick (after the Per pan mode) being parget- ted or plaiftered, and poliihed in Mofaick order.

North Latitude, the Caftle feated upon a high Mount, the greater part of the City be ing below, much after the fimilitude of Dover-, the houfes well built but of fmail ftrength albeit moated with a dry 'gi afF, and walled about with folid ftone. Not far from which place is Godah, once the feat of the valiant Kajhboot Princes: the Countrey is cham- paigne and fruitful, in many places affording the ruines of antique magnificence, which by time and war are exceedingly obfcured: Thele Ecbar coupled to the reft of his Em pire ; and by this having made an end of his oblations, in his return he vifits a holy Derxvis-, Siet Selym by name, of great repute amongft the People; who took it for fo great a favour, that (by what skill I know not) he foretold the Mogul, how that e're long he ihould be Father of three Men-children; which proved fo, and upon which ac- compt his firft-born was called Selym, (he who afterwards was Shaw Selym the great Mogul, when Sir Thomas Roe had Audience at Agra in the quality of Ambailador ;) the other two were named Chan Morad or Amurath, and D'haen-jha or Daniel : ^A Prophecy fo grateful to Ecbar, that in gratitude there he ereded a very magnificent Mofque, walled the old Town Tiickerin, or Sycary as fome pronounce it, and from this occafion new- names it Fetmore, which fignifies a place of pleafure ^ yea, grewfo affeded to it, that Fettqore he adorned it with a Palace for himfelf, and a Buzzer for Trade fcarce out-vied by any other in the Orient *, yea had made it the Metropolis and ufual refidence of the Court, had the River affeded him, by whole unwholibmnefs he foribok it^, from whence i6^.

Ptol. calls it Co jamb a and makes it part ot Ge- drofia, and daily threatens this fair City. The ftreets in Amaduvad are many, pretty large and comely ; moil Ihops redundant with Aromatick gums, perfumes and ipices, filks, cotten, calicoes, and choice of Indian and China rarities, owned and Ibid by the abftemious Bannyans , who here furpafs for number the other Inhabitants. Of molt note is the Buzzar, which is rich and uniform the Caftle ftrong, large, moated, and the receiving place of the Cambayan Governour : the houfes in general are of Sun-burnt bricks, low, but large and tarralTed. Adjoyning is feen the Monument of a certain Pedagogue, fo dearly beloved by Sha Reer the King, that by a ftately Maufoleum he ft rove to make him feem immortal; the building (which is arch'd) and pavement are of well, polilhed marble: It hath three fair Courts, one of them faftidious in four hundred Porphyrian pillars framed in Corinthiack architecture 5 joyning to it is a tank of Water compalfed with Cloifters, adorned with fpacious Windows, moft of which give the obferver a delicate horizon.

Rajhhpots, the ancient Nobility of this Country before the Tartars (from whom the prefent Moguls defcend) were con- querers, lodged in a Princely Temple, much reforted to by the Vannians, who branch Irom the fame root with the Rajhboots. Two miles nearer the City we behold the curi ous Gardens and Palace of Cham-Channa, who was Son to the great Byranchan the Per ft an, an Umbrae, by whofe valour of late years the laft of the Cambayan Kings in that very place, by lofs of his life, gave conqueft to that Warrior and dominion to Ecbar his Ma tter ^ in memory whereof he built that ftately Houfe, and madethofe fpacious Gardens, the view whereof worthily attrads a Traveller.

Decan is the name botlfof a City and Kingdom: the City is diftant about 10 miles from the Diamond-mine. The Kingdom is large included be twixt the Mogul, Narfmgan wASamo^een, comprehending Canara or Cancan in which are Onor, Batticala, Mangalir, and other Towns of note upon the Indian Coaft, and by frequent refort of Merchants and others not a little celebrated.

StiMen This fudden farewel ftruck the Army with fuch amazement, that many Umbraes(to death of avoid the fufpicion of his Father) fled, ^ not caring to inhume the carcafs. Ecbar j&gt; r i nce having quick intelligence of this iad accident, though he was pretty well acquaint- Morad* ed with his Sons debauchery, yet will not be perfwaded but they had poifoned him: and for better information, his Chancellor (the Princes School-mailer) Ahdnl Faz.el is difpatched ^ who (finding the dead Prince his own confumer) prudently aflemblies Gangama, Jttftoff~chan 7 T^adokcMamet-chan, Mima Tzarof^, and luch other Umbraes as were at hand: he calls back fuch as had fled for fear, and then fatisfies Ecbar where the fault was, and being commilTioned by the King, undertakes the Princes charge, having firft fent the dead body to Delly to be buried. In fmalltime he liibdues the Provinces of Chandys ex Sanda, Berar, and many other wealthy places ; and by Letters acquaints the King with his luccefs, defiring him to forfake Lahore a while, (having fpent twelve Winters and Summers there, ) and remove his Court to the City of Agray? which fo long languifhed by his abfence*, further putting him in good hopes in fmall time to fubjed and add Decan, Gulgunda (by the Perfians called Hy drab an, ) fifiapore, and other parts of India to his Empire.

Lahore (a City both great and famous) is competitor for the Title of Metropolis with Lahore* Agray: The Pole Artick there advanced 32 degrees 15 minutesj the air for eight months is very pure and reilorative •, the ftreets graceful and well paved •, moft of them being cleanfed and ferved by the Riv^r Ravee, a branch of Indw, which from Penjab and the Cajfmyrian mountains ftreams pleafantly near this City, and after a flux of three thoufand Englijh miles, the Channel all the way being deep enough for Junks of three- fcoreTun, at Tmta in one broad ftream near Dinl at 23 degrees 15 minutes empties it felf into the Ocean. In Lahore are many things obfervable i as the Caftle, Palaces, Mofques, Hummums, Tanks, Gardens,^. The Caftle is large, uniform, and nobly feated*, the material itone, white and polilhed *, entred by twelve Pofterns, three of which relped the Town, the reft the Country : Within is a Palace entred by two Gates, giving paflage into two Courts ^ the laft of which points out two ways *-&gt; one to the Kings Durbar and Jarneo where according to cuftom he daily (hews himfelf unto his people, the other to the JDevon-Kawn where every evening from eight to eleven he difcourfes with his Umbraes. On the wail are pidured fundry ftories and paftimes, viz, Jangheer (otherwife call Sha Selym) crofs-legg'd upon a Carpet under a State, his Son Perwees being on the right hand with Curroon and Tymoret his brothers, Dhan Shaw and Sha Morad *, about him are Emir^a Sheriff, Can Afoms elder Brother, of flich wealth and pride, that having above an hundred Concubines, he new clad them every day, and every night tearing their apparel off, buried them in the ground MirzJn Rufian (once King of Candah&amp;r) Can Channa, Rajea Manifengh, Can Afam, AJfaph Can and Radgee Jngonath or Gaginet (the Craffks of India, for at his death he left Jangheer as a Legacy fixty Mawnds of pure Gold, each Mawnd being five and twenty pound weight, which in ours amounts to near fixty thoufand pound Sterling, and three hundred Elephants richly covered, with other things *, at whofe death his Wives, Sifter, Nephew, and feven other friends burnt themfelves (for complement) alive in his funeral fire :) And on the left hand are Bouftng Fly-fcarer, Rajea Randas Sword-bearer, Mocrib-Chah Jefter, Rajea Rodorow, as alio the Radgees Ranftngh, Manfmgh, Berfmgh, and Bojfcii, See.

In a word, no Province of India out-vies it for pleafure and trade, nor any part of the Ealt for a continued lhade of Afh, Elm,. and Mulberry trees, which reach from hence to Atra more than three hundred miles, whofe Ipreading and ver dure lenifie the Suns heat, and for whofe further accommodation each eight miles there is a convenient Saray built for Travellers to repofe mgratis.

BRAMPORE (or Barumyur) Baramatis in Ptolomy-j or Brachman-pore as my notion Bramport prompts me, of old and at this day a Seminary of Bramans, Jomes, Culms or Gymnofophs, (whole Academy (about this place) is recorded by Porphyria PtoUmf) is in Artick elevation twenty eight degrees, three minutes', from Surat Eaft two hundred and twen ty miles i from Afmeer four hundred and twenty, and from Agray not much lefs than one thoufand. The Province is called ChanSJh or Sanda •, where being watered by Tap- pee ( the River at Surat) it becomes fruitful and pleafant but elfewhere is barren and fandy. The City is built upon low ground, in an unhealthy but fpacious Vale, and by Bmnyans molt inhabited: the Streets are many but narrow, the Houfes not high, and but meanly beautiful: At the North-Eaft end it has a Caftle (at the River fide) which is large i and in the River we fee an artificial Elephant fo skilfully fliaped, that by the BmnyAmy\% of fome veneration, and by others admired. In times paft here refided the Deem Kings, who by the Mogul are now beaten from it: and near this is Chan-Chanm's Houfe and Gardens at adorned with a delightful profped of feveral Trees ? which for fruit and fliade and for variety of Flowers and Herbs of all forts, exprefs the inge nuity as well as greatnefs of that Noble Perfonj asalfo the Water-works two couxfes thence are well worthy the view. But to return. Ecbar no fooner underftood how fortunately his Son Daniel had proceeded South ward, C the news whereof 'tis likely came to Shaw-Selms ear) but Godgee Jehan prefents him with a penitential Letter fromShm-Selym his rebellious Son in the contrary quarter. After a little ftay, Jehan returns with the Moguls promifed pardon, provided he would difmifs his Army and make fpeedy fubmiffion. His ungracious Son repeating his for mer impiety, returns this for anfwer •, That having an Army of feventy thoufand Horfe, and many brave men, uponmoft of which he had conferred fome Command, it was evi dent he needed not to liibmit: neverthelefs he would fubmit, provided an Amnefty were forthwith given him and thofe that were in this conlpiracy, their lives and well-being being equally valuable with his own; which if his Father would not grant, he was re- folved to defend himfelf, and to continue his Army in their former courfes. Ecbar ha ving ruminated a while, returns him a tart anfwer, fuch as incenfed the Prince *, who having advifed with his Council of War, forthwith dif-lodged, and in good order marched fpeedily to Elabajfe, where he commands all forts of Coin, of Gold, Silver, and Brafs to be ftamped with his own Name and Motto; yea, to vex his Father the more he dilhoneftly courts Anarkala his Fathers Wife, (which name fignifies Pomegranad-, ) and withal fent him fome of his new-ftampt money *, a crime of fo high a ftain, that the en raged Father firft curfes him, and then acquaints his Chancellour Ahdd Panel with his condition: who having laboured all he could to moderate his Matters paflion, with all convenient haite (accompanied with three thoufand Horfe) follows the Poft to do his Mailer fome Service. But Sha Selym, (having intelligence how all palfed) to anticipate fo fure an Enemy,writes to Radgee Bertfmgh (Lord of Soor) thorow whofe Country he muft go, to lie in wait for Abduls palfage, and promifing him a gratuity with command of five thoufand Horfe,fo he would fend him Abduls Head.The Radgee promifes his beft^and with a thoufand Horfe and three thoufand Foot ambulhes near Gvoaler) and fuch time as poor Abdul Panel (fufpedlefs of any Enemy) paifed by, Radgee fell upon him *, and notwith ftanding the advantage he had, for three hours the fight continued *, but o're-preffing them with men and troops, in the end Abduls company were moft part flain, and him felf (after twelve wounds which he received in fight) was at length taken and beheaded. receives the prefent joyfully ^ but (who loved him dearly) becomes fo palfio- nate, that for three days he withdrew from all manner of company, and for fome time refufed to be comforted. But (like waves) fee another horror affliding him: news was brought him of his other Son Sha Darnel's death, killed in the fame City and by the fameDifeafe Morad was formerly, by intemperance: hereat the old man afflids his de caying body unmeafurably, cries and fighs and vows revenge upon Chanchama for no better regarding him: whofo foon as the Prince was dead, made what hafte he could toy x Ecbar the great Mogulpoif to the Court to puree himfelf; butwcis not Hdmitted Echdrs fightj till by mediation of others he was brought into his Majefties prefence, and gave lb good an account as the Mosul was pacified,and with new inftrudions haften'd back to the Army in Decan. Ne- verthelefs the vexation he endures by the continued Rebellion of his Son Selym takes from him all comfort; and feeing him hardned in his exorbitancies, is at his wits end how to reduce him. Therefore firft (as a King) he marches agamft him with thirty thoufand Horfe, but by his Mothers fudden death was recalled *, whofe Body when he had fumptuoufly interred in Belly in King Homayon her Husbands Sepulchre, then (as a Father) he tries once more what fair perlwafion could operate: To which end he di- dates a pathetique Letter-mixt with love and anger, reproving, perfwading, diffwa- ding promifing, and putting him in mind, he was or fhould be at leaft his joy and com fort • and that he had no more Sons living. Myrad Zedda (once the Prince's Tutor) was thought the fitteft perfon to carry it *, who fo forcibly penetrates the yielding or ra ther convinced nature of Sha Selym, that forthwith taking Perwees his little Son along with him, he leaves Halabafs, palTes Jeminy, and after two days (the Wizard allowing the day fortunate) with all his Umbraes arrives at Jgray, and by Mortoza-kawn was brought to Ecbar then in the Guzel-chanj whoblulliing to eye him, leads him into the Mahael, or private Lodging, where forgetting his promife remembring the dances Selym had led him, into fuch a rage that rapt him, that after he had flafht terror into his heart by the fury of his eyes, and thunder-ftruck him with a ftorm of words, with his The Prince fill ftruck him fo hard upon the mouth, that throwing himfelf,down, requefts his juhmhs, father at once to deftroy him, to which end he Ihews him his breaft, the fword and hand ready to it. But Ecbar by this abating his choler intends no fuch facrifice, but commanding him to arife, dilfembles his affedion and terms him Afs and Fool, that commanding feventy thoufand men, would forfake them to truft the lugred promifes of any. That faid, he brings him forth again, and fends him back to Prifon, giving all the principal Umbraes his alfociates like welcome, Radgee Batfo excepted, who (wifer than the xeft) efcaped. By this imprifonment, Sha Selym contrary to his cuftome ab- ftains four and twenty hours from Opium, which next day Ecbar (fearing that in a paifi- on he would make himfelf away) comes in Perfon and perfwades him to take: The third day, by the interceffion of his Ladies and Concubines Selym was freed and fent to his ownHoufe*, where he behaved himfelf orderly, in a dutiful manner each day vifiting his Father, till upon fome old mens malicious furmifes or his Fathers newjealoufie he was reftrain'd again, and the Mogul de novo exafperated againft him. But this ill-grounded rancour had little effed, for Ecbar taking diftafte againft Mirzjt Gajhaw (the Viceroy o£Turn's Son, and one formerly high in his favour) for fpeakingone word with Ecbar ill interpreted, no fubmiffion will ferve his turn, no lefs,than his life mult pay for it: To which end the Kings Phyfician was direded to prepare two Pills of like lhape but con trary operation-, Gafhaw muft be trufted with them, and bring them to Ecbar' 0 who (imagining by a private mark he knew the right) bids Gajhaw fwallow the other. Ga jhaw ignorant of the deceit, by chance light upon the belt, fo as Ecbar by miftake was ^S feat poifoned. Toofoonthe miferable Mogul perceives his error, and too late repents his toifons choler, but (for fhame concealing the caufe) after fourteen days torment and fiiccefs- him jtif, lefs trial to expell the poifon yields up the Ghoft, in the feventy third year of his Age, and fifty fecond of his Reign; and with all imaginable folemnity inT^ekander, three courfe from Jgra, in a Monument which he had prepared, that great Monarch was bu ried : And Sha Selym (though a while refilled by Radgee Manfngh andChan Afem, who in Sha Selym vain endeavoured to make his Son Cufhroo Mogul, fo nominated by Ecbar as they alledged) crowned vvithfuch ceremony as was requifite was Crowned at jigra, by name of Jangheer, King. great Mo- ^ the year of our Lord God, 1604. and of Mahomet 984. gul ' Give me leave now to prefent you various Scenes, compofed of a mifcellany of fubjeds&gt; hapning in InduBant during Jangheers Reign. Jangheer (fo now we call him) by the mediation of Morteza Chan, Cooly Mametchan, anc | others of his Council, receives his Son Sultan Ojhroe (or Gujhrow) his late competi- es ' 9 4 ' tor into favour •, and to lay the foundation of his greatnefs in the good will of his peo pie freely receives Chan Afem and Radgee into grace again. But Cujhrooe, ftruck by his own guilt, fufpeding his pardon counterfeit, by Letter defires Hujfanheg, Viceroy of Cahd-, his old Friend, to meet him near Fettipore with fome Horfe, that he might fly away, being alfured that if he ftay'd long at Court he Ihould be put to death. By his Zantel the Letter isfpeedily delivered, who as readily obeys the difconfolate Prince, and with three thoufand 'Horfe haftes to Achhar-pre, which is from Agra four and twenty courfes, whither the Prince (efcaping about twi-light from Court) comes, followedTrince^ Gufhr oe beaten.Fettipore defcribcd. tec Attyhea C a ptainof the Guard, with fuchforce ashethenhad topui4eS» and^o furely, himfelf (perfwaded to it by Mir^Umbrave) with fifty Ekpham and eight thouiand Men: fo that the poor Prince (every way purlued) feared tn h» Pnloner again; yet fuch was the halte HafTenbe? made afore them tha^nnl three came near him by fifteen courfes, (yea, though all the way they plundered Villa! ges, and made havock of what they could) fo as on the ninth day the Prince attained La t l T d i: &amp; n enter the C ? ftlc ' the y were ( contrar y to expeaation) keptOM hYEbralnm-chantht Governour, (premonifhed of the Princes flight-,) and whfch was worfe, by Sayet-chan (three courfe from the City, and inhis wayto to/AhTplace of his Government) making as if he would join with him, uponthe River the poor Pdnce isimprifoned , but byvertue of a bribe efcaping, he returns tomtfan, where he was endangered by another bait. fotZalaladeaHafen prefents himfelfnnto the Prince affiened hh true Friend ^ 0 ir\ rh ab '° &lt; ? antl ° ve had Paled by his offences, and had' p' his true Friend Huffenheg the additional Command of the Provinces of and to/wi: with which leemmg not contented, hedefiresthe addition of a this being but to dally, and allure his ftay till came to catch him.

The miferable Prince after this defeat, accompanied with tiajjenbejr, Abdul Radgee, and Chan Baderjhaw, fcarce looks behind him till they had attain ed Lahore, where Radgee ftays i but 5 ultan Gujhroo with Badajha crofs the Ravee, and labour to arrive with fafety at Ramos, a Caftle by fome reputed impregnable.

The King overjoyed with this good hap, returns to Lahore, and by the way put to death many Umbraes who were the Princes followers j and the Prince was committed to the cuftody of Zemanaeheg, (called after Mahohet-chan, ' i.e. beloved Lord*, of which Mahohet-cam I may fay as Livie fpeaks oiCato, In this man were fuch abilities of mind, and fuch heroickvertues, that into what Climate foever his ^Nativity caft him he feemed able to command a fortune O Hafenbeg Bedajha, and ^ MhI Raagee,heing firft publickly difgraced,were then made clofe Prifoners.Such was the eonclufion of the Princes firft out-breaking.

After which the King returns (from Cabnl) unto Lahore- and by the way remembring the danger he had elcaped, and deeply grounding his jea- loulie that Guforoo his Son was partly caufer of it, he commands his Sons Eyes by juice of Aeck to be made blind: but the Poifon was more merciful, leaving one Eye a little fight. Chan Jfem alio {Gvjhroo's Father in Lr.w) was clad in loathfome rags and brought into the Guulchm, where every Umbrae was commanded to Ip.it upon his Beard *, after which he was manacled and led to Prifon, where two full years he remained clofej till by the prevalent importunity of his Wives he was fet at liberty. This year Anno 1609. Cwrrown (another of Jarigheer\ Sons) and other of his friends (to make his way the ealler to the Crown) prevailed with fangheer that his Kinfmen Shave Selym\ Brothers Sons might be Chriftned; which accordingly was done in Agra: The Jefuits that baptized the young Princes named them PbiUffOj Carlo and Henrico; that year alfo they baptized another Grandfon of Ecbars by the name of Don Edoard. Soon after Mirzjt Ombrave being Apopledique, thereby became incapable of the further execution of his Office. T'zalamchan alfo in Coto-pdy's place was made Viceroy of Ben- gala, and commanded to fend up as Prifoners Aft'en-charfs Family; which he did ac cordingly. In the way, the young Widdow Meher-metzja Ethaman Doulets Daughter, and Sifter to Ajfaph-chan, was met by a Wizard or Fortune-teller, who told her many ftorics of her enfuing Greatnefs, which foon after hapned. For they were no fooner ar rived at Agra (whither Jangheer was by that time come) but were kindly welcomed by Rockia S nit anna the Mother Queen. It hapned, that one day being led into the Mahai with her little Girl, Jangheer was there accidentally, and in merriment lifting up her Vale, difcovers fo rare and forcible a beauty that thenceforward he became her Prifo- ner, and Ihe the fum of all he contemplates: He is now no longer Ethaman Doulets foe, but to ingratiate himfelf into the free affedion of his Goddefs, rather ftudies how to advance Doulet her dejeded Father v in this paffionate dotage he forgets his ftate and the power he had to command, and privately each day pafles by Boat to Ethaman Don- lets Home, and all night confumes himfelf and his precious time in amorous dalliance: Beauty is a beam of Divine refulgency, no wonder then if an Enamorado negled all other things to accomplifh his delight, without whom there feems nothing but darknefs and difcontent. To enjoy her the more and better, at length he commands Godz.ee Ab dul Hoffen to ask Doulet s good will for his Daughter*, which Hofren admiresand lay ing before him the indignity he offers fo great a Majefty, Jangheer (now Cupids flave) being both deaf and blind, in choler bids him go, or ftay eternally. Hoffen replies no more, but fpeeds away, and ufesfmallperfwafions: for Ethaman Doulet (by this Mira cle wrapt from his difcontented Orb) after fome profeffion of his bafenefs,returns Jang- hcer his humble and thankful condefcenfion: fo that Meher Met^ia is forthwith efpou- fed with all folemnity to the King, and her name changed into Nourjha-begem, or Nor- mxhal, i. c.

During which, Mahohet-chm (hy that time in Provinces) goes on viftonoufly, foxcmg many Holds and Caftles from thofe indomitable but rbv envy of fome at Court; in this his profperous proceeding was recalled back to Court and Ahdd-chan made General in his place. This alteration did not much alter the eltate of the Army, as fome thought; for Abdul profecutes Ram with no lefs vi- gour and fuccefs, urging him to a fet Battel at Sijf-meer &gt; where Abdul ^ot the better chafing Radgee to Oudepore and Pormandd, killing many of his men, enriching themfelveq with abundance of Spoil and Captives*, and after much toil and fome lofs he fackt Sxa 'vend rWs.ftrongeftCaftle; till then judged impregnable-, wherein they had ftore of warlike Provifion, and many Pagods, which for above 1000 years had ftood there fuperltitioufly adored ^ thefe the Mahometans burnt, and in place of them reared a ftu- pendious Mofque for Mahometan Devotion. Abdul-cam lo fortunately managed this VI ar againft Rava, that Jangheer the great Mogul fends him thanks, and orders him to live a while m Gufurat, not only to curb but to extirpate that rafcal-race of Coolyes and Bielfgrates which (o thievifhly robb'd the Caffilaes and lived upon the fpoil of peaceful paflengers. Abdul fails not in that: For with fifteen thoufand Horfe fent out in ieveral parties, he ferrets and purfues them in all places where he knew they lurked and after many petty encounters took Bder their retreating place (feventy courfe from Amadavad \ ) yea, happily fell upon them one time when they were together, and hav ing with eafe put them to flight, in the chafe flew half their rabble, together with Lael-Cooly their Ring-leader, whofehead he fent to Amadabat, and (as a memorial of his Vidory and terrour to all fuch Rebels) commanded that it fhould be fet upon a Pinacle. * But Cam-Jehan (during thefe broils) waiting all cccafions of conqueft in Decan through difcord and envy of fome Llmbraes in the Army, finds his fuccefs grow worfe and worfe againlt Melee Amber, and knows no remedy without acquainting the Mogul therewith and as an expedient he intreats that one of his Sons might come thither to command, by whofe greatnefs the Army might be better ordered. After confideration, the King fends Sultan Perwees his Son, and with him Radjea Ramdas } who from Brawl pore fends Chan J eh an and Manfingh with an Army to Bellaguatej where they fend defiance to Melee : But jangheer better knowing the prudence of Melee Amber and his power, fpeeds Chan Afem after them with four thoufand men more to re-inforce his Army \ which done^ he removes his Lefear to Afmeer, a place convenient for hunting. Chan Afem was no fooner come to Br amy ore but he intreats Ganganna (^Lieutenant of Khoor) to join with him, and fo haftens towards Bellaguate with an Army of 100000 men, 600 Elephants fof which huge Creature this Empire is thought to have 40000/and 12000 Camels', yea, of fuch fame grew this Expedition, that ere they departed Cuneam they were of Horfe and Foot no lefs than 600000. With this great Body Abdul chan pene trates into the very heart of Deean, no reliftance being made either in Field, Town, or Garrifon, fo that through all Beder, Aurdenagar, Gent fro, and as far as Kerehy ( the Seat Royal) they marched without refiftance, burning and plundring as they iifted^ fparing neither Villages, Temples, nor Inhabitants not to be counted. The Deean King aftonifhed at their numbers, and unable to refift this torrent, flies to and fro, nor reft- ing any where till he came to Daultabaty ten miles from Kerkie, a Caftle of great ftrength: For having made fome fmall skirmiilies and ambufcadoes, they appeared to fo little pur- pofe, that Melee Amber (albeit Mamet Lary and Waekhyl AdeLehan were new come to his aid with above twenty thoufand Horfe, and fome Infantry ) devifes rather to quit his Kingdom of them by ftratagem, than hazard it by chance of War. No adions are more fubjed to fudden and unexpeded Events than thofe of War. Melee cunningly writes counterfeit Letters direded from fome Radgees about Jangheers Court', containing a private advertifement of the Moguls death and Curroons advancement to the Crown: Thefe he gives in charge to a crafty Bannyan •, who circling about as if he came from T -• A L 2 Agray,gpWPJWiuimi 6 Submiffion and death o/'Rana Radgee Mardout, Array,was taken as afpye; his counterfeit Letters being read, their lying contents fo aitonilhed the General, that without more confultation they prefently divide the Army quit fuch places as they had placed Garrifons in, with confufed hafte march ing back into their own Country, and each Captain to his former Quarter. Sultan Vervtees marches to Bramyore-) jibdnl-chan to Snratj and Chan jlfem towards gi ving Amber eafie re-admittance to his Towns and Caftles $ which otherwife in all pro- babflity would hardly, at lealt not fpeedily have been recovered. But fo foon as jamheer had intelligence of that deceit, he becomes inraged at their fimple credulity, threatning their puniihment, and then intreating Mahobet-chan to go Governour to Bramtore. Who having received his Commiffion repairs thither ^ where he was with joyful acclamations received: Such was Mahohefs difcretion that from thence he em ploys what force he had, in fhort fpace fubduing Berar •, after which he enters Decan without any confiderable lofs as far as Kerchy, where JbduUhan's Army had been the year before •, by that fecond inroad making Decan a molt miferable Country ^ and loaden with'abundant fpoils returns to Brampore with Vidory. Which good luccefs, when it came to Jan^hecrs ears, made amends for his laft years failings^ And further, when (by Cmroons mediation, having firft by many battels and purfuits tired him) Rana Radjea prefents himfelf, his Son, and many gifts unto the King, amongft which an Ele phant valued at 100000 Roopees, fubmitting ail he had to Jangheer to be difpofed of ^ who heartily forgiving, embraces him with affedion, offers to nis Son his Daughter in marriage, and returns him the Government of Tormandel (Form his Country,) Oodcpore, and other places: But foon after (whether for grief he had fubmitted, for whien he fufFered reproach fufficient, or fome other caufe) died, and with much ceremony and hymns in a doleful manner fung to his memory, in a Sepulchre amongft his Noble Pro genitors this great Prince was at Chytor buried. Jangheer the mean time having confumed eighteen months in pleafure at Mando (fixty courfes from Brampore, and above twice as much from Amadavad,) departs, and in progrefs comes to Amadavad ; where he difcharged AbduLchan from that Command, but ordains him Viceroy of Calpi and Khoor : and after twelve months paftime mere re turns to Agray, Anno 994. and of our account 1614. That year Chabeeg Governour of Candahor was dilplaced (by reafon of his age) and Badar-chan made Commander there. fTkgdiat -chan alfo was fent to fucceed Tz.alam~chawn in Bengala: But at that time Oxjnan- cmn a Tuttanian with a numerous Army befieging Daec (the Metropolis) he and Etha- man-chawn with fifteen thouland men gave O^man battel, which was bravely fought on both fides; but by reafon of a mad Elephant on which fate, T&amp;ediat-chan was unhorfed and maimed, yea the Moguls Forces difcomfited: but by ftrange chance a wounded man feeing Ounan. pafs by transfixes him with his Lance, and by that mif- chance the Puttans retreat, and at length flye, the Moguls not only recovering Daeck, but piercing into the very heart of the Gentiles Country they captivate his Wife and Children, forraging at pleafure, and making all his Wealth (which was very great, and fent to Agray) a teftimony of their Valour as well as Vidory. That year the Mogul journied to Lahore with his Lefcar. AbduLchawn after feven weeks march arrives at Calpi-, where, and of Koor he was to receive the Government. He ftraightway executed his Commiffion, in finall time quieting and deftroying thofe fwarms of rebellious Rajhboots, which till then there abounded-, he levelled alfo the molt defenfive places with the ground, and made fale of fo many of the Inhabitants as paid the Charges of the War, amounting to 200000 Roopees and upwards. Chan Afem alfo about this time went Ambaflador from Jang- Afem^ heer to Abbas the Perfian. Not any Ambaflador in mans memory went more richly ml ' r ' difpatcht with Prefents or more bravely attendedj He prefented the King (then at Spahawn) with twelve Chefts of choice Linen, two other Chefts filled with Shalhes woven with Gold and Silk and Silver, many Daggers whofe Hafts were fet with Stones of value, eftimated at 70000 Roopees; and for difcharge of his own port and tra vel had an allowance out of the Moguls Exchequer of fixty thoufand Roopees, the better to reprefent the Majeity of fo great an Emperour.

Jangheer over-joyed with fuch good fortune, torelilh it the better, fo laces himfelf in his Son Pervoees Gardens beyond the River. Ethaman Dowlet (Queen Normals Father) dyed at that time, and his great Eftate was by the King divided 'twixt his Daughter and AJfaph-cawn) but his Office of Treafurer was conferr'd upon Godgee Abdul Hoffen. Cur- roonzlfo (who fate as Emperor in his own opinion) with a greedy eye reipeds the Di adem : but perceiving his imprifoned Brother interpofing, fuch is the magick of Am bition that it runs on not caring how, though mafqued with never fo much deformity •, fo that feigning himfelf fick, (his Difeafe was horrible) nothing can recover him but his eldeft Brothers death.

The wretch replies, he came from the Mogul his Fa ther about his delivery. The miferable Prince (affrighted, and fufpeding treafon) de- fires him to ftay till the morning: but that execrable Villain perceiving no entrance by intreaty, breaks in, grapples with the amazed Prince, and having g^ot him down, ftran- gles him ; that done, lays him in his Bed, locks the Door, and fneaks away as if the Prince had died of fome Impofthume. By which we fee, Nullo fata loco yojfis excludere, cum mors venerit. This damnable villany being bruited, Curroon you may believe has quick news of his Brothers death, and albeit he outwardly expreffes forrow, inwardly rejoices. But e're Sun-rife, Gujhroo^ afflided Wife (Carvn Afem's Daughter) went to vifithim, whom finding Ipeechlefs, and (by his contufed Face) perceiving that he was murdered, never did poor wretch pour out greater abundance of tears, or exprefs more paffion; firft tearing her Hair, fhe then deforms her beautiful Face mixt with fuch loud cries and fymptoms of diftradion, that her Father and all his Family both hear and fee it to their grief and admiration.

Yet ere long he was revoked thence^ for at that time Abbas King of Ferfia with thirty thoufand men had laid clofe fiege to Kandakor, pretending it was a member of his Empire. The City was defended by Juef-chan, a Captain of valour and honefty, who for fixteen days kept it in de- Ipight of the Perfian : but perceiving his Garrifon too weak if they intended to ftorm, he acquaints Jangheer with his condition, and the time he probably could maintain the placey by whichif hehad not relief, he Ihould be forced to liirrender. hav ing notice thereof, fends word back. That within that fpace he would not failtofuccor him, either by relieving the Garrifon, or raifing the fiege. So that pofting to Lahorey and having advifed with his Council of War, firft he commands Chan Jehan (then Lieu tenant ot Multhan which adjoyns Kandahar) with fuch force as he had in readinefs to hafte thither ^ whiles the Enemy in the interim attempt day and night the entrance, and Jangheer ruminates whom to appoint for General; at lall fixes upon Ahdul-chan* who by that time and by Curroons leave was again returned. This famous Captain readily ac cepts the charge, fpeeds to Lahore, and is imbrac^ed with fiich joy by the Mogul, that heprefently contrads his fair Grand-daughter (D'haen Shaws Child) to Mirza -chawn, Ahdul-chams eldeft Son ; And fo with a hundred Elephants and fifteen thoufand Horfe (five,thoufand of which he brought along with him) he makes hafte to give the Perfian battle. But ere he could attain thither, Jangheer (having notice that the Terfians were exeeding ftrong and no lefs refolute) by Letters commands Auef-chan to furrender the place unto the Enemy: But the valiant Governour doubting they were counterfeit, holds out, till by a Mine a great part of the Wall was blown up ; and as Abbas was entringthe breach, he founds a parley, and after a (hort Treaty agrees upon Articles for the yielding it up, upon condition they might depart fafely with their lives and baggage. Abbas (who only aimed at the conqueft of the City) condefcends, and has it given up •, wherein he places A /ly -Kool /'cam, and returns toSpaham; whiles Affuph and Abdd-chan by eafie marches retire back to Lahore where notwithftanding the lofs by Jangheer they are welcomed. CANDAHOR has Artick elevation four and thirty degrees, and longitude from canddor the firft Meridian ninety eight.

The Countrey efpecially towards the South is reafonable fruitful and redundant in nloft neceffary things v yet by reafon of the many Carravans paffing and repafllng from Lahore to Verpa, all lort ofProvifion is dear, and the paifage (in regard of many rafcal troops of Puttans, Agwans and Coolyes, which like the inhofpi- table Arabs prey upon Caffilaes) found both chargeable and dangerous. The City is not fo fpacious as'tis ftrong-, madedefenfive as well by help of nature as induftry^, to the South and Eaft it is furrounded with a thick wall, to the Weft and North with hills. The Suburbs alfo (though not well defended) are large, adding to the City beau ty and wealth nothing wanting lave good water, which there and all the way to Spa^ hawn is brackifh, through the diftemperature of the earth which is for the moft part barren and uncomfortable. Jangheer infatuated by the crafty perfwafion of Ajfaph-chawn, fends him with a pe remptory Order to the Treafurer and Caftle-keeper of Agra, that without delay he ihould remove the publick Treafure thence to Lahore, where the Court then was and for fome time he intended to fettle. This was a meifage of fo much aftonilhment to Ethamat otherwife called Ethabar-chan, both from the confideration of the length and danger of the way, trouble of carriage, and his own integrity which that King had no reafon to diftruft j80 Curroon purpofd to rob riiftruft * as alfo the extraordinary ftrength of the Exchequed where the Treafure was then hoorded i thatatfirft he could hardly credit his Mailers Letter: But at length he fell to diifwade Jffavh-kam, though in vain, had his arguments been trebled So that on the one fide, haite and the Moguls command is urged-, on the other, delay and di verting Janzheers meaning to another fence', on either part with that eagernefs, that from words, blows became their uncivil moderators: But in that exercife Ajfayh-chm /for all his greatnefs) found himfelf too weak, the Eunuchs Guard was fo ftrong, and Ethahar-chan Provoft of Agra fo near at hand to fecond him.

From Barockjtis dillant an hundred and fifty English miles. Curroon after two days reft in advances with fuch hafte, that his Army (ignorant of his intent) thought he had been half frantick, every day marching above forty miles *, fo that in thirteen days he attained Fettipore, which is from Brampore near five hundred miles *, yea, ere Ethahar-chan knew of his being in that Country. But as it fell out, he made more hafte than good fpeed •, for long he could not lurk with fuch a numerous company, without the knowledg of Ethaher-cawn the careful Treafurer; who (as if all the Enemies in the world were approaching) unloads the Camels of their precious burthens, conveys it in again, fortifies the Caftle, and fends quick notice to Jangheer of his Sons trai- terous intention: who at this report was aftonifhed above meafure, fothatprefentlyhe fends every way for Affiftancefor Sultan Perwees out of Pat han, Chan J eh an out of AMthan, and for Mahohet-chan out of Kabul: Whiles Cnrroon (perceiving he was dis covered) with his whole Army divided amongft feveral great Officers, by name 6^#- ganna, Ruflan-chan, Radgee Bickermanfe, MirzA-Daraby Sayet-chan, Mahomet TackjecXr Tfojfally and others, appear and ihew themfelves in the very face of Agray, making a bravado as if the conqueft were eafie and no way to be doubted of. But the two Eunuchs keep clofe to their charge in the Caftle-, while Radge e Bickermanfe at Cmroons appoint ment begins the churlifh play, followed by Byramheg, Rufian-chan, Waur chan, and Bar ah ^ whofe alfault though it was full of bravery, yet Ethahar-chan defirous to facrifice his beft endeavours to exprefs his loyalty to the King, affords him fuch an entertain ment, that after three hours difpute having loft five hundred men, and being without hopes of attaching the place they were forced to retreat, well beaten and no lefs aihamed: So that Curroon now forgetting that the beft Armour of proof for a Prince are his Ver- tues, letting loofe the reins of Difcipline, falls upon a more pleafing but lefs honoura ble defign *, for after a retreat they fall to plundering the houfes of luch Umbraes as were- likely to have booty in them. Byramheg begins with the houfe of Mirzjt Abdul Chart Afems Son, which was of fome ftrength, but where contrary to expectation he finds hot welcome: Howbeit Radgee Bickermanfe entred with better fortune AJfaph-chans (which in this confufion found no exception) out of which they drew twenty leek of Roo- pees *, Ruftan-chan out of Lafcar-cham lixteen leek, and Bar ah from Nonradyn-Coolf s ten', in all, above threefcore leek of Roopees: After which (as if they had effected wonders) they returned triumphantly to Fettipore.

To this end after double allowance given each Souldier with proteftations of fome extraordinarv reward, he retreats towards Delly, in five days attaining Pherrybmd ten courfe from Delly, fuchtime as Jangheer (having made all poffible fpeed) with his Armv pitched three courle from the Town, and not above feven from Curroons quarters Early the next morn, feeing it was now no time to dally, commands Bickermanfe with eight thoufand Horfe to engage. Againft whom, Jamhecr (thoifgh in perfon there) conlhtutes Mahobet-chm his Lieutenant General', and under him char,, Ethabar-chan,Affufh-cawn , Godgee Abde Kadgee Bertjmghj Tzeer-chan, Seber-deeft-chan y and other Principal Umbraes had com mand : by Mahobet-cham advice the whole was divided into three Brigades; one part himfelf and Radgee Benfmgh command', the fecond Sheryer his youngeft Son. and Mahohet-chan •, the third Ahdul-chan and Zadocchawn : of whole loyalty and experience he fo little doubted, that he needed not to ufe more argument than Curroom late cruelty to his elder Brother, and that his further aim was through his Fathers blood to itep into the Empire: Neverthelefs, to each Commander (as they were entring the Field) he lent iome token of his refped to wear that day for their better incouragement But Zaher-deefl-chan in the firft place (carrying AbduUhmhh Mafters Prefent) for want of good Scouts falls into a forlorn offive hundred Horfe otCwroons and periflies. Bichermanfe purfuant to Curroons orders, with a fmart body of Horfe charges BertM and the Moguls Wmg runoully, fo that many parted with their Lives to exprefs their Loyalty : Whiles Ganganna and Curroon with the main body enter pel-mel upon that part of the Moguls whicii was commanded by Mahobet-chan •-&gt; Rufiav-cam with Tfoffally doing the like upon JbduUmn : fo that for three hours the battel was continued with equal hopes, each part fighting fo reiolutely, that no advantage could for fome hours be difcovcred, till Victory at lalt inclines to Curroon. For Rajea Bickermanfe after a terrible flauehter of that party the Mogul commanded, indefpight of his guard entring llernly (dy'din blood) Jangheers royal Tent, arrefted him as his Prifoner ^ which he had fcarcely done, when the battel-axe of a Mancebdar then in prefence gave himfucha blow that down the Kadgee tell, with a curfe breathing out his unwilling Soul, and fuch terrour into the hearts ot his followers, that without confidering how much they had the better of the fight, r vif they fled, and gave the Mogul the opportunity to rally his fcattered men, and after a Jo r little more difpute to have the chafe of the Enemy. mzniQ Curroon in fome amazement at this unexpected change, yet like a coufagious Captain ^ a? 68 all he can to imbody his Army i heperfwades, threats, oppofes, and cries aloud, that aiDQit Btckermanfe was flain yet He was living s yea that many as good Officers as Bickermanfe were in the Army: But in vain ; for fuch was their diforder and pannick tear, that impoffible it was to revoke them: So (vollying out a thoufand imprecations, expreljmg all fymptoms of frenzie) he rides to and fro, not knowing whether he had better here put apenod (by his death) to future misfortune, orto flie and hope for better arterwards. At laft, by Qangmnah advice fecretly fent, he haftes away, leaving his trealure and^ baggage to the will of his Enemies: and with fome few of his Friends at- tarns the defolate Mountains of Mewat*, in whofe folitary rocks he ruminates his mifery and the Jultice of God upon his unnatural pradice and rebellion. Sultan Fermes with a glad heart meets his vidorious Father at Ballot j after which, the Seraglios are freed, and the Caftle gates opened, fearlefs of any further oppofal. Wow the old Mogul again begins to cheer up his drooping fpirits, and to folace himfelf with Normal, the light of his Eyes, if not the belt objed of his devotion. His delights and carefles gave a fair occafion to Affffh-cawn to mediate a reconciliation for Curroon, which the old man (defirous of eafe) inclined to : fo that from Letters of love and forgivenefs are once more difpatched to the Prince ; who reads them with nofmall leemmgjoy, and prepares for fubmiffion. With Ganganna, AhduLcawn, Ddrah-cawn, rnrrr . n Beyram-beg and other Llmbraes he defcends the Mountains of Mewat, and through Bajfa- ; ww, Hambyer , and LaeLfod (unable to forbear pilfering by the way) he came to Afmetr, j wherehe throws himfelf at's Fathers Feet, and upon his repentance and vows nevermore ij r l h to fly out, is pardoned. But his fubmiffion appeared counterfeit-, for, afre(h ^ Sofoonas Rajea Bickermanfe, was flain, Curroon in his place conftituted Abdul-cawn ' viovernour of Gufurat, Am adavad, Soret, and Cambaya, I mean the City, for the Pro- M vine© I s .—— — m—m Sz Conflict 'mixt Abdul Saffi-cawn. vince of Cambaya including Gufurat, reaches from Bate a River near Choul South to Cr Teaw under the Tcrjitin 300 of our miles ^ and fb well peopled^ as tis thought there be no lefs than threefcore tlioafand Villages in this Province, the moft being inhabited by Bannyans, Bulloches, Rajhboots, and others the old Indians; albeit of late brought un der the Moguls fubjedion. AhdnUam, though glad of fb confiderable a command, delays his repair thither, both in regard of his defire to fee Curroon freed from trouble, and to enjoy the gain he every day got by Curroons depredations: fo that obtaining leave to ftay a while, he feuds his Eunuch Bajfadur-cawi as his deputy to prepare bullnefs the better againit his coming. The Eunuch in good equipage travels thitherward, and by the Inhabitants of Amadabat was received with due ceremony: but not able to bear with modefty the greatnefs of that Command, wasfo puffed up with fimple apprehenfions of his high ftation, that he looks upon all others within the circle ot his Government as abjed perfons ^ which Pride in the end rendred him ridiculous, and made him die contempt of divers. Amongft which was Nadab Tfaffichan, an eminent OScer, being no lefs than Chancellour to the Mogul in thofe Provinces ^ who in an amicable way hav ing in vain laboured to make him underftand himfelf, in plain expreiTions told him, The people were fo dilfatisfied with his behaviour they would no longer endure his command over them. Which fober advice the Eunuch took in fuch ill part, that inftead of thanks he* threatned puniihmentNot content with which, he fodiigufts the Chancellor, that unable to bear more he flies away for fafety. He therefore with what force he had takes his way to Nai~or-cavtn Viceroy of Pat an, and Bahan-cawn of Chapperbemitz. j whom by his complaint (and the affront offered) hefo inflames, that hearing the Eunuch had not above five hundred Horfe under command, they prefently advance to Amadavad with athoufand Horfe and five Elephants, enter the City, and forcing the Caftle, imprifon Baffador-cawn the Eunuch with his affociates Mir^a Madary, Motzjib-cawrty and Mamet- Hajfen the Cambayan Podeftate; whom after they had difgraced, they left the City fatis- fied, but the Countrey full of' aftoniihment. Curroon having quick notice of this pailage, (feeing it a plot meeriy to difhonour him) after he had given vent to his pafRon, ftraight- way breaks out into frefh Rebellion ; albeit Abdul-cawn made fportwithit, as unwor thy Curroons impatience, their Antagonifts being but three, one of them a Law yer, and the other two were -Merchants; none of them of any influence in the Army. Neverthelefs, knowing fatisfadion would not be had without blows, and thatS^Jt cawn might not infult longer, Ahdd convocates his Umbraes AmeUcmn (Governour of Broderaj) Tzalibeg, Rufian Bador, Mamet Hojfen, Mercon-begy Zerdz.ie-cawn, Mat&amp;ael- camand others i to whom he relates the Princes difhonour and his own vexation; not that he either feared or valued fuch Enemies, but that he faw the fire of difcord a kind ling, which by the conftancy of his Friends he doubted not to extinguifh. They hear him, and unanimoufly with feven thoufand Horfe hafte to chaftife Saffi-chan and his Affociates. Fourteen hundred thoufandRbopees were disburfed by Abdul-cam upon this preparati on, and to increafe his Army with ten thoufand Infantry : fo that now he makes fure to punilh, yea, to extirpate the memory of his Enemies.

But to our Story.

Curroon Perwees (prevailing with Mahobet-chan to affbciate him) with fifty thoufand Horfe rebels , moves againlt Cwrroon '-y by the way impriibning Mirz.a~chan Abdul cham Son, (who but and is lately was married to Jangheers Grandchild) and by his order he is fent manacled to beaten. Ethabar-chan, in Agra Jaltle to be confined, whiles Abdul Auef-chan (who by Abdul- chans pei fwafions was brought to Curroons party) efcapes and upon fubmiifion to the Mogul is pardoned. Curroon \\^ early notice both of the levies that were made to reduce him and of the approach of his Enemies, fo as from Awneer he hafts to Mando to recruit his Army, with a full determination to bid them battle. Fenvees follows his motion, and after a long and fpeedy march pitches ten Englijh Miles from his Brothers Camp with a refolutionto engage him fpeedily: accordingly the next morning drawing oat his men he affails him s who at the firft ftiock (bymif-hap of Ruftan-chan and Berken- dafchan) gave ground and let the Enemy poilefs his trenches. In a word, afteralliort dilpute Perwees has the day, and Carroon flies to Brampore his old receptacle. Gangama lathe interim noting Curroans fadnefs, takes advantage of it, and perfwades the Prince to fend him to treat with Ferwees for an accommodation, intending indeed to betray and deliver him into Ferwees his hands (having precontracted with Beyramheg and Darab-chamto fecure him, who to that end had ambulhed near the River Nardebah twenty tiioufand Horfe :) But AbduUhan diffwades Cnrroon^ diftruflmg ^^Ws viL lanyv which could not be fo fecretly apprehended, but that by fome means or other * Cmgamn Had notice given him, which gave him a feafonable opportunity to efcape the Princes fury: So thatfo foon as his intended treachery was made pubiick, Beyramheg with his aflbciate were loaden with Irons and placed on an Elephant^ and with lomefe- led troops Curroon leaves Brampore and flies into Btcan where by Melee Amber (glad of fuch confufion) he was welcomed, and feated in Najfier-Throm^ where he dictates patience: his Elephants and men in the mean time are lent to Daultabat, to be there quartered till he had further ufe of them. Sultan Perwees and Mahobet-chan after this rout, enter Brampore-, where they had in telligence whither Curroon was retreated. They prefently give Jangheer notice of their goodfuccefs, which he entertains with no lefs joy than as if he had triumphed over a dangerous Enemy. But behold r this fair Sun-ihine of content was inveloped with an unexpected cloud of danger : For J'hen Thouz. an Ouzbeg Tartar (of long time watching a fit occallon to for rage the Moguls Territories, and taking the opportunity of Curroons out-breaking) with thirty thoufand Horfe over-runs C^/, (Araehofia of old) plunder ing the Country and doing all the fpoil and mifchief he was able. Which known to Jangheer, fo foon as he had given vent to his paffion, he fends poft to Zaed~cmn {Son to Mahobet-cawn) at that time Viceroy olBange to advance with what force he could againft that invading Tartar. This young Gallant delays not, but with twenty thoufand Horfe haftens to find the Enemy r, and fooner than the Tmar expeded entred his quarters and gave him fb furious a charge, that J^hen Thouz. after fhort trial found his men better at plundering than fighting: For after a fhort engagement they betook themfelves to flight ^ which by reafon ot the fpoil they were loaden and loth to part with, gave the Indians the better opportunity of overtaking them &gt;, by which mif-hap, the Tartar loft half his men, befides fuch rich bagg and booty as gave Zaed-cavon the occafion of encouraging ms men beyond their expectation. And to requite the Tartar, they delayed not topro- iecute their Victory by following the difmayed Tartar into his own Country, and as far as Gajjany burn, fpoil and make havock of what they could meet with, marching back withS6 Gangannax Family fenTrifone rs to Agray.

Howbeit, began the play with four thoufand Hone, andtorra- eed the Country towards tlahafs but by Mamet ShawmavfZs met upon banks, where his men were difcomfited, Beyrdmbeg Qain, and his head fevered. Mahobet-cban interpreting this as a good Omen, draws out his Forlorn*, but knows not how (witn- out peril) to pafs his men Ganges, till by a Native he is direded to a Ford, where with a party of Horfe he got over luckily: and then having fecured the pafs, he qmcMy marches his Army through the River. Having now nothing to interpofe, Mahobeu chawn faces Curroons Army. Curroon being of too high a fpirit to be thus brav a, (elpe- cially by Mahobet, whom though for his gallantry he needs muft honour, ^yetcontemnea as being his adverfary,) ftraightway prepares for fight: And having difpofed his bat tel into the belt pofture he could, firft orders Radgee Rhiem with his Elephants to charge Mahobet. This couragious Officer very gladly undertakes it; and gives Mahobet fo hot a charge, yea, with his warlike Elephants fo difordered his party, that had AbduUhan or Derra-chan feconded hkn (as was appointed) Curroon had ('tis thought) obtain a the vidory: But Ahdnl-chan fwelling with envy againft Radgee Rhiem ever fince their at tempt of not only delayed to fecond him, but rather feemed pleafed when *- hobeuchans company recovered, and Radgees Elephants (wounded and madded wim rage) execute tlieir wrath upon their own party. In the end, Radgee (after as mucn proof of courage and skill as could be in man) was flain, and his whole body diioraer- ed. In this miferable fort periihed one of the belt Souldiers in all India, and AbduUm bafely accelfory to his death. But revenge, or rather juftice purfues him: for hndmg it high time to give over looking on, he fees Termes entring with Radgee Ziffing, Kadgee Ziand, Radgee Berthing, and their whole Army. Curroon alfo falls on, doing what lay in the power of man, the battel now pel-mel enduring for five hours, wherein was e - preffed a great deal of bravery on both fides: Curroon was hurt in the iVrnr-, (though upon his Elephant) by Derra-chan was wounded in the fide, and but for the ex cellency of his mayl had there breathed his laft. In the end, the Kings Army (by excellent condud and ufual valour which Mahobet.abefh affords them) have thevict or y* the Rebels pufillanimoufly oppofing that new torrent of deftrudion gaze a while, a then remembring the injuftice of their fide make a flow retreat, and in the end &gt; revolving not in hafte to re-undertake fuch a bufinefs.

Dhmoni- This famous Diamond-mine is diftant from Mefulifatan about fourfcore and ten Miles i the neareft Village is called Mercanda. The Mine it felf is a large Rock under partof that Mountain which extends towards Bellagmte (the Alps of thofe parts) at the foot whereof runs a quick ftream our European Merchants name Chrifiem, which af ter forty miles flux increafes another River, and in the latitude of about eighteen de grees North, in one Channel empty themfelves into the Gulph of Bengala. The foil for many miles round (by realbn of the extream heat) is barren and fandy. but near the Mine the Earth appears to be of a ruddy colour, albeit the Vein it felf is of a pale yel low. No part of the World for fuch a fcope of ground affords greater plenty of Dia monds than this, or of a better water, thofe of Socodania m Borneo not excepted, al though many be yellow- The Quarry alfo has feveral other tranflucent ftones which want neither beauty nor efteem j namely. Topazes, Amethyfts, Spinels, Heliotropes and other forts of Agats, Garnats, Cryftals, and the like. The diftribution of the ground when the Mine is expofed refembles a Lottery : fome for their adventure hapning to find ftones much to their advantage, others to lofs. In digging, if a Diamond exceed tvVenty Carafts (a Carad is four Grains,) fuch by the Law of that place are referved for the King *, but under that weight, for the Adventurer. When the Mine is open, as the number is great of thole that from moft parts refort thither, lb the Guard increa fes anfwerably, thereby to give the better fecurity: Howbeit, the danger is greateft in travelling, the Mountaineers fuppofmg that few come or go empty, and therefore for the moft part Merchants confort in Carravans, and for their Money are fufficiently guarded. Afelec jlmher withlefs lulpicionbut more fiibtilty (heartily glad ot this frefh Rebellion, the Moguls troubles bringing peace to his Empire) fends an Ambaflador to Carroon, well attended, with Letters of affedion, and a large fum of Money, and other neceilaries; with an invitation into Decan (if need were) where at all allays he fhould command his utmoft. Hope oft fancies that to be facile in the attainment, which rea- fon in the event Ihews difficile: fo as prudence we fee is of force, where force prevails not: For perceiving his defign about the Diamond-mine fruftrate, very hearti ly accepts the invitation v but after three months ftay in that Country, weary of idle- nefs, projeds the recovery of his old Eparchy of Brampore: and fo without long ad vice bids Amber farewel; and with ten thouland Horfe divided amongft AhduLchan^ Mahomet Tackhieck^ and Jacnf-chan, fliews himfelf again before Br amy ore, but was for bad entrance by Radgee Rufian (appointed Governour there by Sultan Pervoces ;) Which fo enrages Curroon, that after he had breathed out a thoufand fruitlefs threats, he affaults the walls with violence - , but by Ruftan as churlilhly anfwered, and with great lofs com pelled to retreat to Chanchanna's curious Gardens, there to ruminate. Howbeit, Abdul- chan is fo tranfported, that he mounts again and advances his Standard *, yet was alfo forced to march away, being well beaten by Rpiftang\ who filled the Ditch with the Car- caffes of Abduls followers. Mahomet Tackieckjat twi-light tries his deftiny, charging fo furioully, that in defpight he mounts the wall, and wasfo bravely followed, that in fmall time he enters the Citadel, and on many parts of the battlement fiourifhed his Colours in fign of Vidory, and as a call to Abdul-chan to fecond him: but Abdul (poi- Ibned with envy to fee a Merchants Son poffeffpr of fo much glory,) forbears to fuccour him ; fo that this heroick Captain (too far engaged) was affailed by Ruftan and At fit- chan with fuch eagernefs that hfs Company were cut in pieces, and Mahomet ftruckdan- geroufly in his eye, yea, (after as much proof of valour as was poffible) was taken and rifoned.

Jangheer further rejoycing at the vidories his Son Vermes and Mahohet-chan had ob tained, to exprefs how well he took it, takes fpecial notice of the fprightly valour and loyalty of Gannated-cavan-, (lately made Viceroy of Kabul) and calls him to Court, and exprefles his good aflfedion to him j and more than fo, adds five thoufand Horfe to his command, and under his Seal by Commiffion makes him Governour of Bengala, of all the Provinces of Indnftan the moll rich and honourable, 6f late years, reduced under the Moguls Diadem: of old named Barkura and Gandarida into whofe Gulph the great and noble River Ganges in two Oflmms falls under 23 deg. by Ptolomy called Swm AgarU cm: A Province for number of Inhabitants and Towns, and plenty of all things requi- fit€,not inferiour to any other throughout the Orient.

Mirz,a*-Arebdeftoa~cawn (one of Normals Creatures) is fent with this melfage, and Mahobet f loth to ihew any example of difobedience, though he knew Jangheer abufed, and that this was a meer plot to work his confufion) lets him go : who forthwith begins to chatter and fpit his utmoit malice againd Mahobet, exhibi ting many unjuft complaints, and incenfing as much as poiTibly he could the old Mogul a- gainft his Champion *, and principally, that he had put to death his Son, with others of his Kindred, yea, after he had voluntarily left Cnrroon to ferve in the Kings Army. It is a good obfervation that Reges mukoshahent oculos-, mult as aures : their hands arelong, and their knowledge is. inlightned by many, and their power exercifed afar off. Accord ingly, thefeaccufations wrought fomewhat with the credulous Mogul*, but more, when from the feeds of diftruft fown by Ganganna in the heart of Terwees, in his Letter to Jang heer he gives Mahobet theCharader of a vain-glorious man, one that delighted to ecliple hisfplendor, and that it was probable his ambition might have a dangerous influence in the Army *, with other fuch glances as quickly took imprellion in the Moguls weak fan cy : that without further confideration or memory of Mahobets former ^ iyicq ^ G anganna\ reports are efleemed no longer malicious *, fo as without advifing.with his own Reafon or Mahobets Friends at Court, he unadvifedly condemns him unheard, difpofes of his command in the Army to Cawn Jehan-, '(forgetful of his loytering at Fettipore,) and having null'd Mahobets CbmmilTion, revokes him home, where he fhould be better ac quainted with the reafon of this proceeding. Thus fraude feYit virm. Mahobet ad mires the Viliany of Ganganna, and Normals envy , and thinks (by the candor of his own innocence) it is impoilible his Mafter fhould really believe fuch imputations •, till remem- bring his dotage upon Normal and her .inveterate fpleen, he grants it: refoiving never- thelefs to take another courfe, till time might better evince his innocency. Therefore as love and duty bound him, he fir it goes to Prince Pmm/to bid him farewel: whom when he found fo ftrangely altered, fo coy and ftately, it ftruck him with amazement, (an excellent fympathy and union, till Ganganna diflblved it, having been betwixt them:) .fathat with a fad look he leaves the Camp, but carries along with him the hearts of all the Army. From Brampore he goes i many guefs, but none (no not him- felf) knows whither Fortune led him: at length by the advice of fome Friends (who airured tiimif he went to Court he-fhould at lealt be branded with the name of Traitor) hefecured himfelf in his Caftle oi Rant amy ore , refoiving firft to vindicate his honour by Letter to Jangheer, or otherwiie to fafeguard himfelf from imperious Normals fpight, and other his Court Enemies. This difcord 'twixt Perm.es&gt;Mahobety and Normal, founds fweetly v&amp;Gwrrbons Ears, hop ing by their divifions to advance his own ambition : And perceiving his old Father fenle- lefly nuzzled in apparitions of love, refolves to exercife his craft, and in the Moguls weaknefs to fix the ftrength of his confpiracy. So that firft he prefents him by Godgee Jehan (Tutor to his two Sons) a Letter neatly penn'd, but didating nothing faveHy- pocrifie: He knew alfo the Appetite of his Father after'Gold and Rarities, and there fore adds a pilhcalh of rare Coins, a hundred choice Elephants, and fome Pourtraits N whichpo Tvpojoung 'Princes I il l JljV'f ll ii mm II il l I ill i : mm 11 ill imm which he borrowed or rather bought from the Portugals. The old King defirous of eafe, and as an indulgent Father glad even of his feeming fubmiffion, accepts his prefent and invites him home, alluring his pardon. Accordingly, Ajfayh-oam by the Moguls di- redions gives him notice: and adds his fecret advice to return to Cou^t whiles his Fa ther was in this good humour. In the mean time, Madofer-cawn at Lahore receives the Government or Provoftihip of Agrayy Cajfem-cawn being difplaced : He attained that . command upon his marriage with Moviffan-begem Sifter to the Queen 5 and this difgrace was fo impatiently digefted by that ambitious woman, that fhe ceafed not till (he got him re-eftablilhed. « Six years paft, viz.. 1618. and of the9198.

At that fame time were committed to that Fra tricide, Sha Hoffen and Ethymore (Sons to Dhaen Shaw his Brother, who died through diftempered drinking at Brampore) whom becaufe he law towardly young Princes and apt to revenge their Fathers death, he was the more free to fend them through that bloody bath to deftrudion butdurft not perpetrate fuch apparent butchery perceiv ing all mens eyes and expedations upon them, and the dekth of their Father and Un cle yet recent and not a little murmured at', v fo that he had no other way to anticipate their claim unto the Empire, but by having them inftrudted in the Faith of our bleiled Saviour Chrift, and to be baptized •, by which profelfion he well knew they would be made incapable of that great earthly Monarchy, albeit heirs of a better for, Firtus locum hahet inter aflra. After this, he ever led them with him to keep them the ftrid- lier, till fuch time as being vanquiihed at Elabas by Ruftan-cawn, JEthymore efcapedto Terwees and thence to Lahore where his Uncle entertains and marries him to B^har Bannoo- begem his Daughter : At Curroons next flight from Brampore, Huffen alfo efcaped and fled to Radgee Rufiang, and thence to his Brother, where he lived with more fafety.

The meilage was tart *, but being lent to one impatient of affronts, and albeit divided in himfelf'twixt the ne- ceflity of felf-prefervation and offending his Mafter, at length refolves upon this an- fwer : That he was very ready to manifeft himfelf a dutiful fubjeft, and therein to fpend life and goods to do him fervice *, but to ftoop to the lure of his malicious adverfary could not condefcend: He was ready in perfon to give him the reafbn, provided he might repair to Court, and return to Rantampore in fafety. With this ill-digefted meC fage the Poll: returns, with news alfo that Abdul-cam (either weary of his vagaries, or that he faw the wind of Curroons good fortune ftill averfe, or doubting his formeFclafhes with Radgee Rhiem .a&amp;d T^^Vc^might undo him) for fome or ail ofthefe hedeferts Cur roon, and flies to Chan Jehan at Brampore, where Prince Terwees then alfo was ^ by both whom Abdul was at leaft feemingly welcomed. Jangheer having received Mahobet-cawns Letter, as it is true Nemo amat quern metuit, he throws offhis wonted love, and not a little wonders at his prefumption •, but Maho- bet no lefs admires his mifapprehenfion: So that after the earneft perfwafion of his kindred and friends about him, he affumes frefh courage*, and attended by five thoufand voluntary Rafhboots Mahobet iflues from his Gaftle, and through Raffanwer journeys to Lahore, at that time refolving to make his defence in perfon to Jangheer, (who was then removing to Kabul) or was refolved to die in doing it. The Queen and Ajfaph-cawn hav ing notice of his intent, but fearing his force, and that (if he were admitted any private dilcourfe with Jangheer) probably he would reingratiate himfelf, they prevail with the Mogul to fet his feal to their didate, the fubftance being. That Mahobet fhould come in perfon attended only with a few of his confidents, to anfwer what fhould be objeded againfl: him. But Mahobet (contrary to his former refolution) being not untx- perienced in Normals deceits, rather than adventure his perfon chofe byhis Son-in-Law to prefent his excufet which with a willing heart this Gallant undertakes. Who being arrived at the Court, at his entrance into theLefcar found it true, that Non eft irafuper iram mulieris : And that injuftice armed with power is moft outragious.

This done, he acquaints his friends and fellow-fouldiers both what he had publiihed, and what he refolved to enterprize : Having their faithful affurance to live and dye with him, he forthwith furveys his Army, gives llrid command to offer no violence to Javgheer or his Tent *, and with twenty thoufand valiant Rafhboots (his Countrymen) advances to find out Normals Army arid the Lelcar at that time con- lifting of above fifty thoufand men.

The Queens Army were frelh and excellently armed, but by the overthrow of . Eradet not a little difheartned ; Mahobets men, though come from far, yet of a more warlike conftitution, were hopeful of booty : fo that in the end Normals party gave back, well beaten and unable any longer to abide the ftrokes of their adverfaries. Af- faph-cawn in the mean time rides up and down like a diftraded perfon, now upbraid ing, then intreating, and ufing all means poilible to rally but fear and the Raihboots Swords had flaihed too much terrour amongft them to fight again : So as with a fad heart upon an Arabian Courfer Ajfaph flies away with Mir^a Abontila his Son to a Ca- ftle of good defence not far diftant thence •, but by accident efpied, are chafed by Mir fa Byr ewer {Mahobets third Son) and being taken are ihackled in Silver Fetters, and in that pofture brought to Attack^, were there fafely guarded : Whiles Mahobet-eavon and his Army (galloping in the air of good fortune) beat down the Queens forces, at that time more willing to dye than fight ^ fo that without more lettthey proclaim themfelves Lords of India, and prey upon infinite riches of all forts which they found in the Lefcar. The aged Mogul was found fleeping lull'd in Morpheus golden bed^ till by Mahobet-cawn he was gently awaked and affured of his welfare. Upon a ftately Elephant they conveyed him to Attacks (a ftrong Caftle to the Eaft of Indus) leaving flain behind him twelve thou- fand men and many llmbraes of note, as Mirz.a, Cajftm?

So that, exafperated with a thoufand fancies, he gives Melee Amber many thanks, and with Radgee Rhiems Son and twelve thoufand Horfe paffes (under leave) through Rana's Ter ritories, and atlaft comes to Jfmeer, intending fuddenly to furprize Agra and pro claim himfelf King. But his defign by Radgees fudden death was prevented, half his company upon that occafion forfaking him i whereat, doubting fome treachery in the Afmeerians (into fuch hate his robbing and other diforders had brought him) and that Mahdhet-chan had fentfome force againft him, and Sultan Perwees alio had ambufht for him, he haftens to Tatta, hoping by conqueft thereof to command Indus and Camhaya : So as at his encamping before it he fends the Governour afummons to deliver it •, but the Captain Xerijf-Melee fends him word he had particular order to keep him out, and that if he attempted it he fhould receive the entertainment of an Enemy.

DELLY is the name of a City and Province which of late belonged to the Potan Kings, the originary Inhabitants *, but at this day is reduced under the Crown of Indn- flam. The City is ancient, large, and pretty beautiful •, fuch appearing in the variety of antick Monuments and Tombs of above twenty Kings and other great perfons who lye there intombed: fo as it is a place not a little vifited by Travellers, and by infinite num bers of Bannyans (who for fome fuperftitious end refort thither) little lefs than adored.

Jangheer alfo removing his Court from Cha- hul to Lahore (by Normals rafh perfwafion) condelcends to the (laughter of fuch Ralh- boots as Mahobet had mixed with his own Guard; and after that openly declared that flie could not be fatisfied without the deftrudion of Mahobet e're he received any fupply from his Kinfmen Chan-Mem, and Radgee Rufiang who were then advancing up towards him. And for her part, to leave nothing unattempted that might conduce to the execu tion thereof, Ihe empties all her Husbands Coffers, and hires men from all places to ferve her^ fo that Ouripargan Viceroy of Bajfowere brings her 5000 Horfe, Godgee Tzera 3000, Madofer-chan 12000, and of her own fhe had 19000 more v hoping alio that Ftdi-chan (hed from the battel at Atteck^ into the Defarts of Thombel to Radvee Ghoma^ mo) would alfociate her : but he was fo afraid of Mahobets good fortune, thai; he would not appear againfthim, but went to Prince Vermes (then at Brampore) to whom (by a commendatory Letter from Ra]ea Bertzingh) he was very welcome. Mahobet-chan has notice of the Qaeens projed and new preparation ^ but not any whit difcouraged, draws all his Horfe and Foot into a body, and prefently advances towards the Qaeens Army. In the Way (at his Mafters requeft) he ufes Afaph-chan and his Son with more refped than formerly* Normal alfo haftens towards him, having fent her Son Sheryar to Lahore with 8000 Horfe to fecure that Imperial City againft Mahobet. In his paflage, by good hap he chances upon Sultan Bullochy and the two chriftned Princes, whom he refcued ^ with whom he gotfo privately and with fuch hafte into Lahore that without refiftance moft of the Rafliboots were cut off, and the Caftle mann'd with the Queens Army. Jan?* Walfo rouzedout of his long deep now plays his part; for being come to Rheed with in eight miles of Normal and her Army, (and having at all times the freedome of hunt ing, hawking, and fuch like paftime, he makes it his advantage) efcapes, and is joyfully welcomed by the Queen, who (crying out MombarackJ impales him in her arms, and cries for joy, then (as one alfured ofthevidory) gives prefent order to march onto alTail the Traitors. Mahobet-chan (like all other motions, when at higheft, defcend) quickly knows of Jangheers flight •, and is not fo grieved at his being gone, as at the manner, intending ne ver to have with-held him longer than he fancied: yet the revolt of 5000 of his men did trouble him. Howbeit, perceiving his enemies were approaching, and that it was no fit time to difcover his difcontent, he apparels himfelf in a rich and tried Coat of mayl, and with his Shield and Spear fpursup in the front of the Moguls Lefcar; where, by all figns he perceives the Moguls affedipn eftranged: He fighs at it, and'returns and after a fhort Oration to encourage his Men, orders his Forces. But e're the battel be gun, Balant-chan brings him a peremptory Meflage from the King, to this effed ^ That if he defiredto be accounted loyal, he Ihould exprefs it by releafing Ajfaph-chan and other Umbraes whom he kept imprifoned; by whofe mediation probably he might obtain par don. Mahobeuchan knows it was Normals device yet loth in any thing to difobey the King, fends him a proteft of his loyalty, and that fofoon as he came to the River Behed his commands fhould be accomplifhed. So he arifes, and at the place prefigned calls for Affaph-chan and his Son, fhews him he had power to deftroy him, but his vertue fwayed him to another end. Which faid, he not only pulls away his marks of fervitude, but veils him with Princely robes, mounts him upon his belt Courfer, girds him with a preciousDeath of Trince Per wees. precious Blade, and with a convoy of eight hundred Horfe fends him to Court, his farewel only appointing to remember him. Jangheer receives him with tears of love bitf Normal with words ofdifdairr, upbraiding him with cowardice, thatdurft not attend hertimeor depend upon her power to force him from a Rebel he both fcorned and hated. Ajfa$h~chan laments her lunacy, but is afraid to vex her-, yet both in good will publickly and in private difcourfe at any time with the Kuig, he fpeaks well ofMahohet, and as an honourable perfon labours his reconciliation .Where^ by wee fee, that valour gains praife even in an Enemy. vu a -n. The affairs of Jndnflant by this variety poflefs all mens minds with aitonilhment: Whiles Janvheer and his beloved Amazon with the Lefcar pafs on to Lahore to advife with Sultan Sheryar her Son how to reduce the Kings power to his proper channel. But what pleafure can the contemplation ofher reviving glory afford her, lo long as Mahobet lives unpuniihed ? She knows not why flie is intituled fole Emprels of the belt parts of Jfa Commandrefs of fo much men and treafure, fo long as Mahobet an obfcure Raihboot (asihe called him) dares eclipfeher fplendour, and travel to and fro tmre- iilted, guarded with liich applaule and popularity .* fhe ruminates a thoufand leveral forts of revenge, but by too much choice knows not which to faften on : the furefland molt honourable is by War*, and thereupon calls Amet-chan (Brahim-chans coufinj Zejfer-chan, Nouradon-Cooly, Anna Rha Kadia, Bmyr-chan, Meraomyry Immir^a Muflan, and other Nobles, defiring them to ha&amp;mMahobets deftrudion.

In the firft place (hearing offome treafure his Son Zaed-chan had fent him out of Benaala) they ambulh near Cheban-Chehaed (a Caftle of ftrength) and brake out upon the Kalhboots that then were no more but eight hundred valiant men, who fold their money at a dear rate, two thoufand of Normals men giving their lives for it and her ambition^ but by their multitude were at laft defeated, and moft ofthemflaughtered, leaving twenty fix leek or 2600000 Roopees to their avarice ; which was brought to Lahore, and there fome part diftributed for pay, the reft was coffered. Ganganna (Chanchanna fome pronounce his name) by this time recovered, was not- withftanding his dotage made General of Normals Forces. Mahoheuchan was not trou bled at it; but the revolt of his wild Son Byrevcer afflids him fadly. This young Gal lant had no fooner triumphed over AJfaph chan whom he delivered to his Father, (as is fpoken) but with a Brigade of three thoufand Horfe (his Father had made him Com mander of) being ordered to aflail Radjea Tzetterjingh at Nornon, not regarding his Fathers Initrudions, wheels by Bengor (the contrary way) to force his Fathers Caftle of Rantipore, albeit in vain for Motz^aih-chan the Captain fufpeding him, fools him with fair words, and by like Art divides his Forces ^ fo that Beymver making an efcape, flying thence by Ray Rmtang, at Bondy or Bando (as fome pronounce it) a place to the Weft of Agra was unexpededly taken and imprifoned. Jangheer finding his thoughts free and refrelhed by the new delights his youthful Qd_een each day invented for his recreation, labours only to forget the Rebellion of Cnrroonaiid his late adverfity; yea, gives his lafcivious mind full fcope, covertnghim- felf with the effeminate robes of floth and wantonnefs: But in the plenitude of thofehis joys, the glory of his eftate grows cloudy, and his motion whirls into a malignant Orb, by the difconfolate News he receives from Bramfore of his beloved Sons unexpeded death *, at which report his Eyes grow dim, his heart fails, and all apprehenfions of pleafure relifli unfavory when the fad departure of P^nv^prefents it felf', and thofe hopes and comforts he had, now feem fanftatical: So that he recounts his lofs, fadly crying out, Gnjhroe and Sha Daniel are dead *, Perwees is now no more Sha Bthimore and Hnjfen my Grandchildren turn'd Chriftians h Bullochy, is not he a Child ?

Can I deny that i am old ? and at my death (which can not be avoided) how Ihbjed will my Empire be to innovation ? In thefe and fiich like dolorous exclamations Jangheer fighs out the few remaining minutes of his life. Death (ultima pcena as fome call it) fummoning him in few monthes after to the refignation both of Life and Empire. Humanarum rerum circuius eodem rotate, non Jinit magnates femper ejfe fortunatos : the circle of humane affairs turns lb conftantly round, as iuffers not great men to be always happy, was Crcsfus faying unto Cyrus.

Radgee Ranna at firft contemns her bravadoes ; but upon better con- fideration aifures her, he is not willing to give the Mogul or her any.juft caufe of offence. Which anfwer being returned, he forthwith firft affures Mahobet that his heart was true towards him *, and that if he would have it fo, was ready to engage in his defence againft all the power of India : yet in prudence he thought it more advifeable for him to with draw to exiled Currovony who (as he was Normals antagonift) would without doubt entertain him gladly.

Accordingly they conveyed the old Mo guls dead body to Lahore^ where they prepared for his Funeral, and after with all due fo- lemnity carry it to Tzecander (three courfe from Agray) where they intombed him in King Ecbars Monument; and at Delly they Grown Sultan Bullochy (aged thirteen years) King with all Royal accuftomed State, and unanimoufly cry out aloud, Padjhaw Salamant, i.e. God fave the King. Normal in Jangheers end fears the beginning of her miferies ; and now fees that as in Nature fo in Government, nothing is permanent that is violent: but being of an adive Ipirit, fhe inftantly conceives and fwells with the ambition of that Empire. Her preg nancy was bettered by having ths. whole Treafiire in her hands *, alfo animated in that Bulloch was too young to nourilh oppofition, his Council carelefs, and Curroon a great wayabfentthence: fothat taking occafion by the forehead, flie arms her felf with con fidence and a pretended Title, and refolves to mount her Son Sheriar, to the fupreme afcent ofMajefty, or in the attempt to fet all India on Fire, and to confume her felfas a facrifice in that great adion. In this refolve (he lets her Treafure fly^ hires fifteen thoufand Horfe, and fends in poft-hafte to her Son in Jengapore (a pretty *Town in Tenjabj watered by Cahul) tolevy as many more : Which done, fhe intends toftrangle her Brother AJfafh-cawn, and Bullochy the King, who at that time were advancing to wards her. But fo foon as they had underftanding of her meaning, they .leave Chotelen, and with thirty thoufand Horfe hafteto Lahore to apprehend Sheryar, whom they heard was lately baffled by Godgee Abdul Huff an (once his ftipendiary) and then encamped only with four thoufand Horfe: But in the way (to prevent Normals purfuit after them) they block up the narrow palfage that is upon the Mountains through which her Army needs muft pafs *, fo as ere the Qgeen could come to joynwith Sheryar, AJfaph-chan, Era- det~chan and other Umbraes with the young Mogul in company arrive at Lahore, where they find Sheriar's Army (by the expence of ninety thoufand leek of Roopees) trebled. They delay not, but with extremity of rage afiailhim*, and in two hours (bythevilla- ny of Amir-chan and Sheirgodgee two of his chief Captains who moft bafely betrayed him) get the vidory, forcing him into the Caftle, which for two days was defended againft Saltan Sultan Bullochy and all his Army, but in the third was treacheroufly yielded, many of Sheryar his men flain, much treafure taken, as alfo Sheryar himfelf, who (to make him inCa- made pabie of future Government) has his Eyes put out.

That done they again proclaim Bulloch Emperour, and fend Eradet- cam with twenty thotifand Horfe againft the Virago Queen • Who (hearing how ill her Son had fped, and doubting Treafon in her Army,) lets fall the Majefty of her Spirit, fighs at the perfidy of her Brother, grieving that Ihe flew him not when flie had him in her powers complains of her ownweaknefs in continuing fo long fo needlcfly enraged ngzitift: Mahobet, deplores her abufing his valiant Son, and with a dejeded eye behold ing the ftdden eclipfe of her glory and the inconftancy of her friends, wraps all up in difiriiffing her Guard, and thus difrobed of bravery ftie fubmits to Bulloch's mer cy, who like a noble Prince forgives and comforts her, gives her his Oath for fafety, and during his Reign affords her all refped and freedome becoming her qua lity. This Noble Prince Ihews himfelf in the Durbar and Jarneo to the people not fo oft as was expeded,nor long enjoys his Sovereignty: for feeing all as he defired,fpeedsa- way a Poft with Letters to Curroon *, which Zantel or Foot-poft made fiich haftc,that in 14 days(as they report) he ran two thouland five hundred of our miles,asfar as Bait a in Xte. can, eight courfe from Necanpore, and from Brodera or Radjepore in Jejual 120 to the Eaft ) which being receiv'd and opened, Cwrroon was over-joyed with the intelli gence : And fending his excufe to Melee Amber the Dec an King for not taking leave in a more ceremonious manner he fets forward with Mahobet-chan, Zulpheckar-chany and feven thoufand Radiboots and Mancebdars, paffmg through Guz.Hrat to Amadavad, where by he was welcomed. There he flept not longf, for making Agrayxhs objed of his race he bids farewel to and with a great recruit (feeding them with greater promiies when he had the Crown) after three weeks march he comes to Agra-, where he claims the Imperial Title, and by the Kutwal and his Favourites was proclaimed King by name of Pot-Shaw-Jehan. Then giving notice from the Guzal-chan to Affaph-chan how far and with what fuccefs he had travelled, as alfo that fo long as Sultan Bulloch was living his Greatnefs was but counterfeit; AJfaph-chan fleiht in former homicides, and not caring how, fo he could fix the Diadem upon Ckmw/z at that time tottering&gt; makes Bandor of his Counfel v who forthwith without examination of right or wrong Pofts to Lahore, and with Ajfaph chans Keys enters the Hummum where the Innocent Princes were (fufpedlefs of danger,) and that execrable wretch with horrid fpeed and infernal cruelty ftrangles them all, to lead Carroon through a bloody path unto the Throne. Such is ty infacred famine of a Crown, That it to fat isfie before men fail, What in their my doth ft and all mufl go down, S eeing bonds of Blood or Friendship nought avail. m . h $ s In fiich lamentable manner died young Bulloch, after he had been but three AidzS months Emperour. Others were forced to tafte of that bitter cup *, for in that maifa- H.iooS. ere there accompanied him Sultan Sheryar, Sha-Ethimore and Sha-Hojfen (the baptized Sons of Prince Daniel,) the two Sons alfo of Sultan Perwees and the two Sons of Sultan Morad or Amurath y all whofe Garcalfes were without ceremony buried in a Garden in Lahore near to the entrap of Jangheer *, but their heads (as an undoubted Teftimony of their death) were fentto Cmw therewith to glut his infernal ambition. The murther of the Royal Blood of Induftan quickly fpreading it felf, affrights the whole Realm: and being known to Chan Jehan, Ziedchan, and other Umbraes, they were over-charged with fearful apprehenfions; for albeit they fee AJfaph-chanwasgml- ty, neverthelefs they want power to queftion him, efpecially for that they knew very well it was aded by Curroons approbation (if not procuration:) So as all the remedy that was left was only to heap a thoufand maledidions upon their heads, and to crave vengeance from above to jrecompence thisvillany. Curroon fees the Empire ftorming at him, but his incantations quickly quiet them: fo as after long turmoil (having through the Ocean of inconftancy arrived at the Port of greatnefs and eafe as he thought) with great Pomp he made his Intrado into Agra, and forthwith gave order for his Co ronation *, which accordingly by a general aflembly of the Umbraes and Nobles of his Empire was performed. Then by a Proclamation he affumes the Name ot Sultan~Sha~ Bedyn-Mahurnet : For albeit we give him the name of Mogul, they call him Sha or Pad- Shaugh, 1. e. Rex magnrn. Concerning which word I have formerly given my apprehen- lion . and may add. That as Maghid in Arabick ^ftguifiQS unknown or a flranger the fame probably was firit impofed by the Arab Stipendiaries, upon the Tartar? firft invafionCurroon proclaimed great 99 or when T amerlanes Race made it the Principal Seat of their Empire : Upon the like occafionthe word Welch was here impofed bythe5^A7W. After which {A. D, 1628. J.H. 1008.) he orders the affairs of his Monarchy, placing and difplacing at hisplea- -fnre. His Fathers Seraglio was by his appointment ihut up i Q^Normahal and her three Daughters confined ; Ajfa^h-chan neverthelefs made fecond in the Empire •, next him 0ahobet~chan was advanced, Ahdul-chan releafed, and Channa-x.ied-chan re-eftabliftied in the Viceroyfliip of Bengala. Ambafladors from Perfia, Arabia, Tar tar ia, and Decern repair with Prefents to the Court, and congratulate his accefs to the Crown. Divers Radgees, as Radgee Keffing from Nagor, Chan-A^em from Aumeer, the puiffant Radgees Mdnfigh, T zettefingh, and Gheffingh from Fettipore with fifty thoufand Horfe move in fo- lemn itate to Agra whither (after fix weeks) repaired alfo Affaph-chan, Zadoch- chan, Eradet-ckan, Ruftan-chan , Saffin-chan, Mirgomley and other Principal Umbraes, whom he afFedionately received : remitting and putting in perpetual oblivion all offen ces whatfoever committed during his rebellion. After which he proclaims a Jubile, which was celebrated with all manner offports and pleafures imaginable. Curroon in this manner attained the higheft Dignity of the Eaftern World, guarded by a power (in his opinion) irrefiftable. Howbeit, thefe fins have apparently (even inthefeour times) drawn down the heavy Judgment of God Almighty y both, in taking his beloved Wife away, fince when he made his Daughter (by that dead Lady) his Wife, iricefbof fo high a nature, as that year his Empire was fo wounded with Gods Arr6ws of Plague, Peftilence and Famine as this thoufand years before was never fo ter rible. The Sword alio feems to threaten him, the having fnatched from him Kermaen and Candahar *, the Tartar-, KabulShe up h Almuck endangers Tutta and Loure d.H.ioiq Bander ; Radgee Joogh with his Coolyes trouble Brampore, and two counterfeit Bullochyes have lately fown the feeds of an Univerfal Rebellion. The event is in the hand of God, who even in an Infidel hates the Sins of Blood, inceft, and dilfimulation. We will clofe therefore with a caveat to Cwrroon from a Heathen, of more reafon and tem perance. What ? that great Jupiter the World that (hakes. When ^Etna's thunder-bolts in hands he takes ?

The particular ads and paflages in taking this famous City is thus in brief. By command of Shaw Ahbasy Emangoly-chawn (Governour of thofe Territories that ex tend from Shyraz. unto the gulph of Perfia) advances towards Gombrom with 9 thoufand Horfe and Foot, fuch a time as he expeded to meet the Enalijh Fleet there. Being met^ the Conditions betwixt them under hand and feal were thefe: 1. That the Caftle of O- in cafe it were won) with all the Ordnance and Ammunition fliould belong unto the English' 2. That the Perfians might build another Caftle in the Ifle at their own coft, when and where they pleafed. 3. That the fpoil fhould be equally divided. 4. That the Chriftian prifoners be difpofed by the Englift, the Pagans by thz Perfians. 5. That the fhould allow for half charge of viduals, wages, ihot, powder, d-c. 6. That the English fhould be Cuftom-free in Bander-gum-hroon for ever. Thefe Articles being figned, each party prepare for fight. Captains of note in the Pagan Army under the Duke of Shyraz. were Atticdybeg, Pollotbeg, Shaculibeg^ Shareearee, Mahomet Sultan, and Alyheg Kmg(ShaW'bander they call him) of the Port: The Army encamped before Bander- gom-hroon *, and two days after, viz- the twentieth of January 1622. with fmall difficulty became mafters of the Port ^ for at that time it had in it but a fmall garrifon of Pormgah in an inconfiderable Fort. After which fuccefs the Duke and Englifr Captains play'd up on the Caftle with a dozen pieces of Cannon for five hours, but to little purpofe. The ninth of February the English tranfported three thoufand Perfians in two Frigats which they had lately taken, and two hundred Perfian boats which were good for little other fervice: Thefe, fo foon as they landed, having formerly made Sconces for their Men, and raifed Bulwarks to plant great Ordnance upon, made towards Ormm •, but the Por tugal though they let them land, ftopped the current of their fury, at firft encounter from their barricadoes defended with fhot and pike flaying above three hundred, and with their Ordnance beat them back with more hafte and amazednefs than their ap proach had courage. In this diforder a Flanker by mifchance was blown up, but the fiege continued. Little hurt was done on either fide, till the 24 of February ; when the Englijh advanced towards the Caltle,(under which was riding the Portugal Armado)and in delpight of the Caftle and Fleet (being then five Gallions and twenty Frigats) fet fire on their Admiral the Saint Pedro a fhip of one thoufand five hundred Tuns: Which mif chance obferved, the reft of the Spanifh Fleet to prevent danger cut her cables, and in that flaming pofture let her drive whither wind and tide would. The Englijh were well pleafed with that fad fight; and though a Prize rich enough, neverthelefs thought itnotfefe to adventure boarding: fo down fhe drove towards Larac, in the way a rabble of Arabians and Per fans boarding her, and like Jackalls with hunger-ftarved fury and avarice tearing her afunder. The feventeenth of March the Perfians (to fhew they were not idle) gave fire to a Mine ftuffed with forty barrels of powder, which blew up a great part of the wall, doing fome harm to the Enemy through which breach the Portugals immediately fallied, and maintained a fight above an hour againft the Perfians-, who had drawn out all their Body ^ and when the Trumpets founded, the befieged went on fo couragioufly, that the hindmoft difcovered plainly a contempt of death. After nine hours the defendants were forced to retreat,and the heated Perfians begun to mount and enter the City in many quartersat which the Portugals were glad', for they en tertained them with fo many hand-granadoes, fire-balls, powder-pots, and fcalding- lead, that the affailantswere forced to fall back, a thoufand of their men perifhing: Which when Shaculybeg had viewed, with a party of two hundred men he paft through thofe affrighting fires, and after a fhort ftorm fcaled one of their Flankers; which he held not above half an hour, they were fo tormented with fmall fhot, and flames of lead and fulphur*, and in defcending were beaten off by fifty who for three hours maintained their ground, and retreated gallantly. This entertainment fo cooled the Perfians courage, that for five days they did nothing but ruminate upon the valour of their adverfaries. The three and twentieth day our Cannon from the fhore played fo hotly, and battered their Fortifications fo to purpofe, that at length making the fhips their objed &gt; they funk the Vice and Rear-Admiral of Ru~Fryero 7 s Fleet.

Carmania. bv fome Coozelbaflies of Shaculybegs Regiment into his Tent, and after a Ihort comple ment moved for a ceflation of Arms, which if the Duke would agree to, they were ready to prefent him with two hundred thoufand Tomains in hand, and an annual tri bute of an hundred and forty thoufand Ryals. Shaculyheg having difmifled the Fidalgo, not till next day acquaints the General •, who (wanting money) agrees both to a ceifation and lafting peace, fo they would depofite five hundred thoufand Tomains, (amounting with us almoft to two millions of pounds,) and pay as a tribute yearly to the King of Terfia two hundred thoufand more. The Portugah returned him this anfwer, They were in no fuch diftrefs as to purchafe peace at fo diihonourable a rate. After which a fmall celfation followed, for they began a Treaty with the Englijh, putting them in mind both where and what they were, and of the amity that had been betwixt thofe two Nations of old; if they had injured them, they were ready to make fatisfadion; their Kings were atthatinftant good friends,and how could hoftility 'twixt fuch Allies be defended either by the Law of Nations or Religion ? Thefe and the like were fent: but whe ther the behaviour of the Fidalgo difpleafed our men, or that they underftood them- felves fo far engaged that with reputation they could not forfake the Per fan, I know not, but the meilenger departed not well fatisfied. Two days after a hideous noife of thunder amazed them, the JEnglift giving fire to tyo feveral Mines, fo as the breach gave an open profped into the City •, but the hearts of the alfailants durft not travel with their fight, their fenfes the laft time were fo confounded^ fo that they onely became fpedators, and gave new courage to the Tortugals , moft of which were half dead with fluxes and thirft (the three great Cifterns of the City being exhaufted) famine and pefti- lence. The fourteenth day a fhip full of Mulettoes from Kijhmyi arrived at Ormm to help the Portngals\ but perceiving it impoffible to approach with lafety, they turned back, thinking to land at fome better quarter: But the Perfian General alluring them they ftiould receive no detriment from his Army, they foolifhly gave creditto it, till four- fcore of their heads being ftruck off, and the reft in chains made the furvivers fee their folly. The Ormnzjans languilhing thus under many afflidions, every hour hoped for Rn- Fryero to raife the fiege, but he failed their expedation. The feventeenth day another breach was made by giving fire to fixty Barrels of powder, which took fuch effed that the Moors entred in fwarms, who yet were beaten back by eighteen Gentlemen with out the Bulwark •, howbeit, next day the Infidels re-entred and poflelFed it. The 18th of jAyril two famifhed Renegadoes ftole into the Perfian Camp, and difcovered to the Duke the fickly condition of the City, and the little defence the befieged were able to make: that gave the Perfian frefh encouragement upon the next opportunity to make a general ftorm. Which the Portugals wilely forefeeing, and well knowing the trea cherous and faithlefs difpofition of the Infidels, efpecially towards Chriftians, they without farther procraftination fent unto the Englifh Captains who were aboard, letting them know their willingnefs to render the Caftle unto them, and to fubmit themfelves and what they had to their mercy •, which upon the three and twentieth day they per formed *, only craving that they might have their lives, and a fafe Convoy to Mnskat in Arabia. The English according to promife tranlported three thoufand of them as they defired, intending like favour to the reft: but the Perfians intercepted above three hun dred Arabs (amongft which were many Portugals) whom contrary to Oath they barba- roufly flew, and fent their heads to Gombroon as a Trophy. Which done, the Magazines of Arms, Viduals, and Treafure were fealed up with the Signets of both Nations: the interim contrary to agreement was imployed by the Perjian in maffacring of more than half-dead men, violating women , polluting Temples and defacing houfes. During which an Englijhman ( contrary to order) breaks into a Monaftery, but in his return is defcried by the ratling of his burthenfome facriledge *, at which the judging the agreement broken) fall to plunder every thing that was valuable. The Englijh dream ing of no fuch accident, charge the Infidels with breach of Articles, but got no other anfwer than that the English made the firft breach i fo that for all this fervice our men got no more than twenty thoufand pounds. The brafs Ordnance in the Caftle and Ram- pires were divided betwixt them. Some fay they were three hundred, others as many more: Howbeit, our men acknowledge but fifty three great brafs pieces which were mounted, four brafs Cannon, fix brafs Demi-cannon, fixteen Cannon-pedroes of brafs, three of iron, ten brafs Bafes, feven brafs Baftels, fome Bafilisks of two and twenty foot long, and ninety two brafs pieces that were unmounted*, which I the rather name, in that the Portnguez. alledge they had fmall defence.

Now albeit Gombrom be but newly advanced, neverthelefs 1 meet with an ancient Author that feems to point at it by this expreifion j Baraomati funt populi qui Jndum verfm accolunt, Gumbroto proximi. Which how applicable to this place, 1 leave to better judgment than my own contenting my felf with fuch other obfervations as I made during our fourteen days ftay there. And firft, concerning the buildingsthey are for the moft part 6f Brick not burnt with Fire but hardned by the Sun, which makes them fo hard that they appear no lefs folid and ufeful than thofe the Fire obdures: They are low built, and molt with fmall Courts and Balconies, tarralfed or flat at top, pargetted with plaifter in hardnefs not inferiour tothat of Paris *, for indeed fuch is the diftemperature of heat fometimes that to live there is fcarce tolerable: but when the air becomes more moderate (which is when the Sun is furtheit) to have more breath they ufe to fleep upon their tarrafles, to which end they fpread Carpets aloft for their better accommodation. This kind of build ing is common in all thefe hot places: That the Jews had their building fuch, appears by what we frequently read in Scripture, as in Deut. 22. 8. Jojh. 2. 6. 1 Sam. 9. 16. Jerem- 19. 13. Att. 10. 9. The Windows are not glafed, but wooden trellized, made to iliut and open as they fee caufe, to welcome the breez when it murmurs. The mountain (which they fay is fix leagues thence, but by its height feems not half fo much) by an ticipating the cool North-winds makes this place much the hotter •, fo hot, as in the Summer feafon enforces the inhabitants to remove to Larr and other neighbouring Vil lages, where cool ftreams, rocks and trees givelhade and cool the air that at GombroonCtirmania. (jombroibn. is infufFerable, fo as fome (according to what was pradifed in Ormm) ufe to lie naked in troughs filled with water, which nevertheiefs fo perboils their flefh as makes it both exceeding fmooth and apt to take the leaft cold when any winterly weather lucceedsthe heat, which by that becomes little lefs ofFenfive. Now their Summer being no lefs than nine months, during ^11 that time it is rare if one cloud be vifible in the Skie, whereby the air (in the daytime efpecially) is not to be endured •, for by a reverberated heat which the Sun-beams ftrike forcibly from the ground, both earth and air became into lerable to man and beaft by reafon of the inflammation. Howbeit of late they have raifedaBu^zar, which in fome places by reafon of its narrownefs, and molt by being arched and clofe at top, checks the Suns heat when the beams dart perpendicular, in the fides attrading what air there is to refrelh fuch as either fit in Ihbps for fale of wares or thofe other that keep Taverns: Here being plenty of Shyraz. Wines brought in long- necked glaifes and jarrs that contain fome gallons, the belt wine indeed in all Per pa Here be CofFe-houfes which alfo are much reforted to, efpecially in the evening: The GofFe or Coho is a black drink or rather broth, feeing they Hp it as hot as their mouth can well fuffer out of fmall China cups ^ 'tis made of the flower of Bunny 6r Choava-berry, fteeped and well boiled in water; much drunk, though it pleafe neither the eye nor tafte' being black and fome what bitter, (or rather relilhed like burnt crufts) more wholefome thantoothfome, yet (if it be true as they fay) comforts raw flomachs, helps digeftion, expels wind, and difpels drowfinefs^ but of the greater repute from a tradition they have, that it was prepared by Gabriel as a cordial for Mulfelmen. Alfo Sherbet-houfes, a drink that quenches thirft, and tafts delicioufly : The compofition is cool water, into which they infufe firrop of Lemons and Rofe-water, in thefe torrid Countreys the molt refrelhing fort of liquor that can be invented ; albeit the Wine there was fo' good that we refufed not to drink it with moderation. Arack alfo or ftrong-water here is plen ty of, which qualified with Sugar is cordial, and much drunk at Sea and Land in the hqtteft feafons, efpecially where the diet is courfe, and ftomachs crude and weak through thirtUfFufion of heat which in cold feafons is contraded. Howbeit, for our better en- te&amp;kinment we had variety of fruits, fome growing here , but molt imported from pi$ies more remote i fome of which were Orenges, Lemons, Pomgranates, Pomci- tr'Qis, Figgs, Dates, Currans, Myrobalans, Apricocks, Almonds, Piftacho's, Apples, Pears, Quinces, Sugar, alfo Flowers and Nuts in great quantity as well as variety, which, with that plenty we had ofCabarito's and Mutton, Hens, Eggs, and Rice bought very cheap, made the place much more deledable, and for Oylters and many forts of fifh the fea being fo near furniihes them abundantly, and would do more, were the people more induftrious. The belt houfes in the Town are the Sultans, the Shaw-banders, the Englilh and Dutch Agents houfes: ours in memory of the goodfervice they did the Per pan at the taking Ormm are priviledged to wear their Flags dilplayed at the top of their publick houfe; and for fome time the Engliih had half the imported cultomes according to'Articles. At the North and South ends of the City are two Caftles in which are planted four- fcore pieces of Brafs Ordnance, part of the Ipoils or trophies of raniacked Ormus •, two hundred others great and fmall were fent to Larr- Shyraz,, Spaham, and other places. The Gunners here were not very expert •, for, when they had occafion to give fire, I could perceive them to ftand on one fide of the piece, and in a fearful manner (though with a lin-ftock as long as a half-pike which had a lighted match) to touch the powder ^ which was a bad way to take aim by. The Mofques for the Mahometans and Synagogues for the Jews here, are few and inconfiderable in their Itrudure i but the Hummums or Stoves are more confpicuous, no lefs reforted to, and with fmall expence: the floors of which Hot-houfes are plaiftered, and ufually fprinkled with water, which contrads the vapours, condenfes the air, andpreferves the heat with moderationv The Streets are narrow, the Town badly ferved with frelh water, and without wall or graff to make it defenfive. Now albeit here we have abundance of Camels, Horles from Arabia and Perfia of the beftfort, and Mules and Allnegoes in great numbers, which were worthy the view; yet were we not more pleafed with them, than offended by thofe troops of Jackalls which here, more than elfewhere, nightly invaded the Town, and for prey violated the Graves by tearing out the dead, all the while ululating in ofFenfive noifes, and ecchoing out their facriledge. They are the Lions informers, and for reward have always fomething of the prey left them to pick, as at the Cape of good Hope we obferved: Some Iport we had in hunting them with Swords, Lances and Dogs *, but we found them too many to be con quered, too unruly to be banifhed, too daring to be affrighted. Thefe animals the Greeks call jilofecid*, an unnatural mixture of Fox and Bitch, Lugi awreiy others, but La~ Q_ conicln/j. (jumhrmn, conici Canes ( Greg.

Thefe wild dogs, either by diverfity of air or foil vary their fpecies as examplarily we fee in the Indian Ounce which is the produdt of an European Cat*, Wolves in new Syain from Caftilian dogs' and the^like*, or from what other mixture, Iftiall not examine: But with thefe 'tis no great injury to couple thofe filthy proftitutes ancient times properly termed Wolves, that infed this Town when feafonable weather (which is in November, December and January) makes it the rendezvouz for Merchants and Travellers from moft places*, Women I mean who as to their bodies are comely, but as to their drefs and difpofition loathfome and abominable. For albeit their hair be neatly plaited and perfumed, and about their cheeks are hung ropes of orient pearl, about their necks carcanets offtones, in their ears many rings (fome of which are headed with ragged pearl) one by another, in their nofes a broach or piece of Gold three Inches or more in length and half an Inch in breadth imbellifhed with Torquoifes, Rubies, Spinel?, Saphires and like ftones of value-, which, for all their luftre thwarting the face, makes that which is an ornament to them to us fen very deformed *, And as a fupplement to all the reft, want no fucm for complexion j which, favefor the defire they have to pleafe white people, agrees not with colours 61i- yafter, and that their arms and legs are chained with manilio's and armolets Sf filver, brafs, ivory, andthelike*, the reft be vailed with a thin Shudder oof lawn j and upon their feet fome wear fandals, though others go bare-foot: Persian Man 'XJ' Woman nrrr thr. fjjjljik. 5 1 •' lew ellj B annyans.

That fuch as be defperately naught do not fo corrupt good manners, or be fo great ene mies to good life, as thole hypocrites who are but half evil or corrupted in part, per-» fwading others that they have fome feeming goodnefs in them by a dilfembled fandity: No lefs well obferved by John de Lery, That the naked American Women do not io much incite to wantonnefs, or appear ib libidinous as Europaan Women do by the ma- gick of their eyes, mimickdrefs, painting, patching and geftures of feveral immodelt faftiions and loofe inventions. Howbeit the better ibrt of that fex here wear linnen Drawers or Calzoons ofpantado, and want not Jewels and Bracelets for further ornament •, but, when they go abroad they are covered with a white Iheet from top to toe, fo as they are not eafily known to any.

Mela alfo has this defcription, Carmani fnnt fine vefie, fnige &amp; pecore *, fedihm pfcum fe cute velant, vefcmtur came-, &amp;c. Which laft exprellion puts me in mind of another fort of people that mn vefcmtur came, who being the aborigines of thefe parts, fwarm throughout the Orient*, the Bannyans I mean, who are here purfuing trade in infinite numbers: Concerning whom I have but little more to fay, feeing they were fo unfociable that with us they would neither eat fleih, eggs, raddifli, or other root that had a red colour, nor drink wine, for that itre- fenibled \vhat it is called, the blood of the grape. No, not Wine-vinegar, in that agreeing with the Na^arites 6 Numb. 3. They believe the tranfanimation of fouls into beafts and vegetables; and as the Lord notes, have this objedion. That mans body amongft all natural bodies is found to be moft variouily compounded *, feeing herbs and plants are nourillied by ^ater, beafts by herbs and fruits *, but Man, by beafts, birds, filh? herbs, fruits, grains, juice, and other things, which (fay they) both alters and weakens his primitive nature. For before the Flood, when men were longeft liv'd and had molt experience, 'tis thought they lived upon the fame abftemi- ous diet thefe Bannyansmw do, without deftroying for food the life of any creature. But on the contrary we find, that mediocrity in diet ufually enervates nature •, for albeit a temperate diet (in hot Countreys efpecially) preferves health, 1 obferved that the Bamyans though healthy through their abftemioufnefs are but of weak bodies and fmall courage , yet well enough agreeing with their condition. And indeed, how univerfally foever the contrary is pradiled, yet befides Pythagoras, Empedoclesy Lu~ cretins and others who were earneft advocates for prefervation of the lives of innocent creatures, give me leave to prefent you with what Tthnllm elegantly did unto his Miftrefs, hinting therein fomewhat of this perfwafion.

About three miles from Gombroon I rode to fee a Tree we commonly call the Bannyan The Tree : 'Tis not far from that Fort called the great Moftango, oppofite to Or mm. A Tree Bannyan well worth the view: for fpreading its boughs, which by their weight fall, root, and Tree, rife again, they fo circle the bole or trunk that it refembles an arch'd circumference affording umbrage and refrefhment to fome hundred men that without crowding may well fit under it: I meafur ed and found it to be two hundred and nine paces.

Alfo Gildas -our Countrey-man, the better to engage us to the Lord for his diftinguifhing mercy, fpares not to acquaint us with the ignorance of our fore-fathers the Britainsy who attributed divine honour to Groves, Rivers and Fountains: For indeed, fuch was the miferable blindnefs of thofe an cient times, that as every Tree had its peculiar jjmW (Groves being commonly confecrat- ed to fome Deity,) fofcarce was there any Tree that by one or other was not dedicated to fome Afa^ or other, and little lefs than adored. Virgil 7 Eccl. ■ Populus Alcid^e gratiffima, Yitis laccho, Herc'les the Pfflarr, Bacchus the Vine embraces, Formofe Myrtus Veneri, fua Laurea phoebq- Venus the Myrtle, Phoebus the Laurel graces. Yea fo great was the fuperftitious cuftome of devoting Trees, that as Claudian obferves there was fcarce any Tree that had not its veneration, Lucofque vetufta Religione truces &amp; robora Numinis inftar. Alex ab Alex, alfo writes that in his time Trees were adored, and in opinion, little , was the difference, 'twixt the Druida, the Magi, and the Brach- manni j all defending the immortality of the Soul, and the tranllocation from one into ano ther after death was accounted good Philofophy,until it was difcountenanced by Auguflus Cafar, fuch time as true light coming into the World difpelled errour and darknefs; and under Claudm was fo perfecuted, that it then feemed extingui(hed,as we find by Suetonius. Fourteen days we tarried in Bander^Gumbrown •, which albeit the view and other ac commodations the Sea and proximity to the happy Arabia contribute, fuch time efpecially as the temperate months make it habitable, might have allured our longer ftay had plea- fur e been our objed *, our Ambafladors (thinking the time long) ufed the belt perfwa- fionsthey could with the Sultan to haften their provifions for the journey. And albeit Horfes for our own riding and Camels for the Caravan were ready, neverthelefs fuch was his fuperftition, that go we muft not until upon his calling the Dice the chance proved to his fatisfadion. The four and twentieth day (the Die it feems hapning right) the Kettle-drums gave us warning to prepare to Horfe (for thofe there ferve inftead of Trumpets j) and little time ferved to make us ready. The Ambalfadors Caravan confifted oftwelveHorfeand twenty nine Camels: the Horfe were fuch as were not liable to ex- Camels. ception the Camels of thofe better fort they call coozel-baih Camels*, a beaft abound ing in Perfia, and of great ufc efteem and value in thofe oriental parts: Long-liv'd they are, oft-times exceeding threefcore years*, of difpofition very gentle, patient in travel, and of great ftrength, well enduring a burthen of towards a thoufand pound weight*, content with little food and that of the meaneft fort, as tops of trees, thiftles, Weeds, and the like *, * and lefs drink, in thofe dry Countreys ufually ^abftaining little lefs than four days ^ which is of extraordinary advantage, feeing that oft-times they are necellitated to pafs through defart places. The firftday Mr. Burtths Englifh Agent,a civil and ingenious Merchant and of high report at the Perfian Court, with feveral other Englifh and Dutch Fadorsthen in Town accompanied our Lord Ambalfador three miles upon his way: Until the Sultan, the Shaw-Bander and other of the Natives having fetcht a compafs about; met us *, and (well pleafed with the piihcalh or prefent the AmbafladorCar mania ^Band-zJi 11 j. had gratified him with) returned his Lordihip an hundred and ele vating his eyes to Heaven, his hands to his breaft, and declining his head well-nigh as low as the Ambafladors ftirrup, bad alfo the reft of his train farewel ; and havin' orderedus a convoy and received from us the complements of a re turned with his troop o. Coozel-bafhes; all the way difporting themielves with the Giocht de tow,darting at one another fo dexteroufly as fufficiently exprelled their skill and well deferved our commendation. Here our Ambaflador met with intelligence that Ahbas was at that time in Ajbarafh a City upon the Cafpian Sea-fhore, where he Drelhm«l the King intended Audience. Therefore fetting forwards, our firlt days journev was to Bandally, moft part of the way being near the Sea-fliore: that Village was fix'teen miles from Gumhrmn or five pharfangs and a half. The word Pbarfrn* is ancient and to this day continued over all the Perftan Dominions; It is derived from and an propnatedto the Dialed yet ufed in Perfia, or (which is more likely) from the ii brew and. Jtrahic^, where the word lignifies three miles, three of which the Tews might travel without breach of the Sabbath. calls it and makes it to be four Italian miles; which if fo, it equals the German. pfrafes it and computes it thirty furlongs oxftadia, every furlong being 4 o pole in length or twenty five paces; fo that accounting eight furlongs to an Englilh mile, a pharfang is three miles and a half Englilh and two furlongs over. At Band-Ally our Tents (which the Ambaflador bought at Swat, and was advifed to carry along) afforded us our belt accommodation. Howbeit, to give that place its - due, we found there a very neat Carrayans-raw, (a building refembling an empty Coliedge .) The (jyceks call them Pandochid, ^ the Tht I^ s JmdTetts 5 the lyidl^is ScTTtiys \ build ings ereded by well-minded Mahometans as works of charity, and in which they exprefs their magnificence more than in any other fort of building: Of great ufe, feeing thefe parts have no Inns for the reception of Travellers y but here en~pajfam they may reft 1 weedy and fecurely^nzm for they are fet apart for publick ufe, and preferved from violence of Thieves, wild beads, and intemperate weather: At the gate is fometimes aBuzzar or Tent, that (like Sutlers in Armies) for money furnilh paflengers with provifi- on ^ yet feldome is it but that Travellers (not daring to depend upon uncertainties) rather choofe to provide and carry their necelfaries along with them. The people inhabiting hereabout fetch their water ufually from a great large Ciftern which they call a Tank,rather refembling a vault or celler under ground more than a fpear deepfometimes made round,but for the moll part oval: The arch that covers it is welL nigh equal to the depth; and fo well plaiftered, that when filled by the beneficial rains, it preferves it fweetto the lafb bucket •, which is ftrau'ge, confidering how long 'tis kept and without motion, fave what it has when the water is drawn out by Hulfmees or Bags of Leather, and other VefTels that are not more cleanly than needs. The plaifter is white and hard, comparable to that of Park *, and (as I could guefs) was a compo- fition of fand and lime, with fome unduous matter that made the pargett fmooth and durable. Thefe Tanks are frequent in moft parts of Afia, where fprings are rare, and the rain feldom falls-, fo as were not this provifion made for Travellers and Carravans, it would neceffitate them to provide in great leather bags for common ufe, as they are forced to do in travelling over defarts, efpecially thofe of Arabia. Now thefe tanks or confervatories are fo ordered, that when any rains fail (which is but feldom, perhaps one month in twelve at moft, and when it comes diftils not as with us, but falls or pours down in great drops, if I may properly fo call them) the ground is fo dill pofed that it quicklylills their fpacious cifterns. Nor are rain waters to be defpisM ; for by Phyficians they are held the moft wholefome if kept fweet and in cool places, fuch as thefe tanks or caverns be we meet with in moft parts of Afta. For 9therwife they corrupt quickly, and by weakning the retentive faculty excoriate the bowels and breed many bodily diftempers. Thefe I fay, have the preferency, by being the moft etherial and beft pur ified by the Sun. For firft, the matter by vertue thereof and other the ce- leftial planets is exhaled principally out of the Sea and moift places of the Earth, and by its levity rifes upwards towards the higher regions, where by the Moons influence and other watery conftellations it becomes more grofs^ and defcending into the middle region is condenftthrough cold*, and as we read in fob 36. 27. God mahethfmallthe drop of water i fo thefe pour down rain according to the vapour thereof, which the Clouds drop and diftill upon man abundantly. Neverthelefs 'tis obferyal)le, that the rain which drops out of thick black clouds is not fo wholefome, nor unapt to putrifie, as whclt ifiues from white thin clouds. Yea by common experience we find that ipring-waters and what we have out of clear Rivers is beft for ordinary ufe and more agreeing with feveral con^- ftitutions, and iikewife with the fuflrage of moft Philofopher s. TheuS Tanghe-Dolon. The fecond night we came to a fmall Village called Gacheen , five pharfangs from the lait next night to Conrefian, feven pharfangs from Cache en and next to Tavghy-Dolon, i. e. a ftrait or narrow way *, as indeed it was, being pent in betwixt two hills ^ where the Carravans-raw was very neatly built, adorned with coupolo's at top i The water alfo was fweet and plentiful-, not fpringing there, but flowing from a high mountain that was three miles diltant thence, and by pipes conveyed thither through the bottom of an in terfered hill near the Lodge, and lb itreaming into the Tank gave both delight to the eye and refreihment to weary and thirfty Travellers. From the hill top we beheld the valley below, which was very level, large and marvelloas pleafant, byreafon the fpring water Fom premis runs in meanders, and mellows it in all places, fo that it brings forth grafs and fruit in abundance , and being compalfed with hills of equal height gave it a more elegant fence than Art could have done for the greater fecurity and fatisfadion of the Villagers, who have but one common way for entrance; fo as it refembled that which the Poet fpeaks of Temp for delight, and no lefs fortified by its fcituation. But what fet this Vale the better off, was the circumjacent Countrey, which for the moll part was barren and fandy, producing neverthelefs plenty of Dates, a Tree more valuable for its fruit than fhade. That days journey was four Pharfangs, Our next was eleven to Whormoot, which in the Perfian Tongue fignifies Dates. Llpon the way near the Town we paffed by a fmall black Pavilion, in which upon the ground we could perceive fate crofs-legg'd three ancient gray-bearded Arabians, who out of the Alcoran ingeminated a.doleful requiem to their brothers carcafs, intending (accordingto the Jewilh cuftome of fextern ad luBam, mentioned in Ecclefiafticm c. 22. v. 12. where 'tis faid LuUiu mortm[extern dies pradifed as Vv^e find iij Gen. 50. 10. 2 Sam. 12. 18. and accuftomed by many other) full feven days to perform that ceremonial farewel, finging, fighing, weeping and not in vain, feeing tears are the Limbeck of the Heart, and that Eft qimJam flere voluptas&gt; —— -In tears we find content Exp 'etur Lacrymisj egeriturque dolor.

Next night we got to Our mangel, five pharfangs *, and next to Larr', two miles fliort of Which City the Cawzy, the Calantar with other of the prime Citizens welcomed us with wine and other adjuncts of complement.

Anno Domini 1400 it ftiook terribly whenfive hundred houfes tumbled down. Amo Koi of their account 973- ^boafted of five thonfand houfes; but that very year the earth fwelled withfuch a tympany, that in venting it felf all ^ was forced to quake, and would not be fupprelfed but by the weight of three thoufand houfes turned topfie-turvy with the death of three thoufand of the Inhabitants: The old Caitle on the Eaft fide of the Town(which owes its foundation to Gorgem built upon the top of a folid rock, groaned in a like affrighting downfall. And to me it feemed ftranae a City fo ftrongly, fo furely founded fliould be fubjeft to fuch commotions. Now whether it be (as Democrms dreamt) from the gaping Sun-torn Earth quaffing in too much water and (like a glutted drunkard) over-charging her caverns vomits it up in a forcible and difcontented motion', or whether (as^r^^ teaches)it be from vapours ensendred in the bowels of the Earth which(loth to be imprifoned m a wrong orb)rends its patfaee by a viperous motion*, or whether from fubterranean fire the air being in flamed upon fulphur, or other like exuberances of Nature, I leave the fcrutiny thereof to thofe that ftudy the Caufes of Meteors: Howbeit, this being in ^puts me in mind, That no part of the World is fo fubjed to earth-quakes as Jfta is', for m nherm Ctfars. time twelve Cities in one night were over-turned by &amp;irth-quakes •, and in Trajan's time the like in and near Antioch : And indeed this Couiitrey hath had many fad tryals of that kind, as in our travel we could both fee and hear n. ac - i Larr the Metropolis of this Province, is now an unwalled Town, as molt AJiaHch^ Towns be. Art being needlefs, feeing the lofty rocks which are to the Eaft and North fo naturally defend her; For a brave and ftatelyOftleat the North quarter(mounted upon an overiooking hill)not only threatens an enemy,but aws theTown in a frowning pofture; theafcent thereto is narrow and fteep-, the Gaible it felf of good ftone; the walls well furniflied and beautified with battlements and plat-forms, whereon are mounted twelve brafs Cannon-pedroes and two Bafilisks (the fpoils of Ormus:) Within the Fort are many fmall houfes or huts which lodge the Souldiers, who have fometimes'there an Armory fufficient to furnifh with Lance, Bow and Gun three thoufand Men. Howbeit, the walls are weak, not flanked, nor fo regularly built but that the fcituation and Art rather feems to make it defenfive though large in compafs*, ufually well vidualled, armed and man ned as ferves not only to command the City but Countrey alfo, and to fecure them asainft forreign invafion. The Bn^ar is alfo a very elegant and noble fabnek *, the material of good chalky ftone: The building is long and beautiful *, aquadraat 'tis like, though I cannot call it liich, the fides are fb unequal, 'tis covered at top, arched and coupled after the mode of thofe oriental Countreys*, and within (Burfe-like) is furmih- ed with fhops and trades of feveral forts; The Alley or Ille which extends from North to South, is one hundred and feventy of my paces •, from Eaft to Weft it is an hundred and fixty, the circumference of the oval in center is about one hundred and ninety: A building in fome hundreds of miles not to be parallel'd. Near this the are coyned ■, a famous fort of Money, being pure filver but ihaped like a Date-ftone, the King's name or fome fentence out of the Alcoran being ftamp'd upon itin our Mo- ney it values ten pence. , , f , n • t ,. , • The Mofques here are not many ^ one more remarkable than the reft it has, wJncli is round,(either Ihadowing out Eternity or from that pattern of the Alcaba in. Mecca, whole fhape they fay Abraham had from Heaven, imitated by the Jews :), In fome part this is varnifhed with letters, and upon the parget painted knots, beautified in other places with counterfeit Mofaickj, but low and without glafs, wooden trellizes ( artifi cially cut after their invention) fupplying them. The entrance is through a brazen gate, near which is hung a Mirrour or fteel-Glafs*, divers lamps it alfo has for ufe and ornament. Some of their Prophets reft their bones there: Emeer~Ally-z.edday ~ameer , a long-nam'd, long-bon'd (if his grave be of right dimenfion) lohg-fince-rotten Prophet is there enterred*, the older Prophet the frelher profit*, zeal and charity oft-timescn^ riftiing antiquity. But how can I credit what they report that he was a Mahometan, fince they fay that he died a thoufand five hundred years ago, which is fix hundred yearsLarr. izi before Mahowet, and yet a Mujfdman. But leaving that tradition^ more certain'tis that this place affords variety of Fruits, as Dates from the finger-like ftiape, the^o- wans called themv) a Tree diftinguiffied into Male and Female^ fo that unlefs the Female have yearly a flowred bough of the Male ingraffed or placed near, fhe pines away,and beeomes lean and fruitlefs. Here alfo were Oranges, Lemons, Melons, Pomgranates and pomcitrons moft excellent i and of Flowers, Jeflamins, Rofes, Tulips, July-flowers, &amp;c. Here alfo at eafie rates we bought Goats, Hens, Rice, Barley, Rack and Aqua^iu. How- beit the Mmhittcfs or Gnats peftered us extreamly : but of more vexation was the Wa ter we drank and in thefe torrid places thirft after, nay, were neceffitated to drefs our meat withal, and is the belt the People have to drink out of the large Tancks they keep it in: they call it Oh-haroon, which in the language of Perfia fignifies rain-water but with far more reafon I may call it Aqua-mortis, death feeming to bubble in it. A bale qualified Water, whether in regard their Tancks here are ill made or naftily kept, where by the Water corrupts, or whether the rain of it felf is infalubrious, or other hidden caufe in nature there be, I cannot tellbut this 1 can, that it is unfavory, fo ill to the guft as worfe Water for tafte, and efpecially for property c^ fcarce be relifhed. As little of it came in my belly as could be borrowed from extremity of thirll: and with good reafon *, for as experience teaches, it caufes catarrhs, breeds fore-eyesi ulcerates the guts, and ( which is more terrible than the reft) engenders Imall long worms in the legs ', a fort of nafty vermine not more loathfom to look upon than dangerous to the itch ing dileafe in them that breed them, by no potion, no unguent to be remedied: Nor is there any other way known to deftroy them, faveby rowling them about a pin, which if in fcrewing the worm chance to break, it gives them very doleful mufick ^ for it makes the leg apt to gangren, and but by lancing hardly curable. The water doubtlefs being the natural caufe of that malady, feems to me to bring its venome from the Region where it is generated v either for that the Springs are vitiate, or that the rain-water is corrupt: For albeit clouds are feldom feenthere,yet fometimes they are,but undigefted and unagitated by the wind j nor do they at all times diftill their rain moderately in drops as is ufual in colder climates^ but in violent eruptions, dangerous both in the fall, and no lefs noxious in the drinking. Now the reafon (as I apprehend ) that they have but few clouds is becaufe the Countrey is defert and famjy, and wants Rivers and other moift places to occafion exhalations, which beget rain. Howbeit&gt; at our being here it rained a great fhower, which made our Company the more acceptable. And we could obferve that the foil (not only here, but in moft of this Province as we travelled) is either ftony or a Height fort of mould, yielding little grafs or grain of any fort, or fruit, fave what was forced in gardens; unlefs it be Dates, which here are exceeding good and plentiful: But in Valleys and where Springs meliorate the earth, it produces Rice, Barley and like grain*, as alfo fruits in great variety. The Inhabitants are a mixture of Jem and Mahometans : Moft of thofe I law were blear- ey'd^otten-tooth'd^nd mangie-legg'd-, the violent heat and unwholfome waters doubtlefs caufing it. The habit of the greater part of them is only a wreath of Callico tied about their heads, their mid parts circled with a Zone of vari-coloured plad, with fandals up on their feet, elfewhere naked. Some neverthelefs (though but few) have Shafhesof iilk and gold tulipanted about their heads, and robe themfelves in Cabbays of fatten, their fingers being adorned with rings of fdver fet with Turqueifes (that being the ftone they moft afted in Verfm) in which they have engraven their Name,or fome feleded Polie out of the Talmud or Alcoran. The Mahometans delight much in Archery, and on their thumb commonly wear a ring of horn, which makes the Arrow go off both ftrongly and eafily: their fwords afford them no fmall delight, the blades being exceeding good, and the hilts no lefs valuable ^ for with the better fort ufiially they are of Gold. Here are fome ne verthelefs that are proficients in Philofophy and the Mathematicks, the principal delight they take being in Afirology ; For 'tis granted that Major eft utilitas in Afironomia qmm in alicjua[cientia.

In this City fhould be a River, and that not a fmall one if our Geographick Maps were true; But therein they err •, for here could I fee no River, nor any in near an hun dred miles travel further Northward y for both by enquiring of fome Perftans and our ^ own further travel, I could neither hear nor fee any nearer than T^, a River fa mous in feparating Sufiana from Carmania, and from Larr Weftward about five fmall dayes journey, or that other of Chur, over which we rode 'twixt Shyraz. and Perfepolis: R fomefaarovm. Terjia. fome Brooks indeed we paft over, fo fmall-that they had no Name; but Rivers no Man calls them, fince none of them in breadth or depth exceed three foof, Rivolets worth little more than the noting. Weft of Larr is a Town called Jaarom (Gaarom fome write it) about twenty farfangs (which is fixty English miles ) from Lar. ' Moft of the Inhabitans are Jews , by fome re puted little lefs than a thoufand: much lefs than what Ben Jonas numbred in the Year 1 106. for at his being in Jaaria (which is prefumed to be this place) it had then twenty five thoufand Jem inhabitants. Some make this their road from Larr to Shyraz. v but the way we took was more to the Eaft, and more frequented, being neither fo hilly as the other, nor fo ftony. Concerning the Name whence it is derived, I fuppofe it is ei ther for that thefe are the / defcendants of that Kiriath-jearim we find mentioned in the 1 Chro'n. 2. 50. or from that in Judea called Kiriath-jaarim, i. e. plenty of wood which grew there, as we find mentioned in 1 Sam. 7. 1. which probably the tranfplanted Jem might commemorate. And this conjedure is further ftrengthened, by the analogy of the name Gaaron with the Hebrew words Geron and Garimy which fignifies Strangers, or fuch as are tranfplanted i|*o a ftrange Countrey : fo as the Name fitly agrees with'the condition of the inhabitants. Alfo when out of thefe Captives Cyrm gave leave for the re-edifying tlie Temple, we findin£^r. 2. 7. and Nehem. 7. 12. that from Elam and Kiriath-jaarim feveral of the Jews returned, where in the 24 verfe, the other Elam is recorded: or elfe from Jare or Jaarah, Joktans fourth fon Gen. 10. 26. whofe Brethren Ophir and Havilah travelling from Babel to plant about Ganges-, 'tis likely left him by the way to increafe their Coufin Elams plantation. But feeing thefe are the off-fpring of thofe the Affyrian Prince Salmanaffar (called Enemejfar in Tobit 1. 2.) forced out of Sa maria as we find recorded in 2 Kings 17. 6. A, M. 3220. the Name from them has the more probability: for in Scripture we read that he placed them in Halah and Ghabor, (Mons Chaboras inter Mediam &amp; Ajfyriam, Ptol. 6.1. uj Median Cities near unto the Ri ver GGz.an: The finding of this River hath been not a little controverted, and the queft continues yet obfeure; For fome would have it to be a River in Baftria not far from Oxns, and to have the like vent into the Cajpian which being fo remote from Media, cannot be approved of. Others place it near Araxis, which has the greater femblance of truthj Araxis teaming through that part of the Medes Countrey which about Alexan der's time was new-named Atropatia, other fome 'twixt the Mountain Chabor and the Cajpian Sea,, emptying it felf into the River Cyrm, which difcharges it felf into the G?- fpian. Notwithftanding which Ben Jonas in his Itinerary finds Go^an hereabouts, and reports that it empties its frefh ftreams into the Perfian Gulph. Yet to clofe with the Jew in this hvS'Cabala is not fafe i feeing he finds not onely infinite numbers of Jews all along from hence to Nifibor ( or rather Nifyore, i. e. Bacchi CivitasJ in Sogdiana, (which Ftolomy places in Aria under 35 degrees 20 minutes) but feveral Gorans alfo ; which brings it under fuch confufion as none indeed can well tell where to find it. And con cerning that Gozania, I find it in Ptolomy's Tables to be in 40 degrees 40 minutes, and by being in Media it hath affinity with the Name, but in the Map not being taken notice of cannot tell where properly to place it. Moreover, albeit the way thefe banifhed Tribes took from their own into the Median Territories was in probability the ufual or neareft way,which was to pafs betwixt Babylon and Nineveh yet their progrefs is fo myfterioufly deferibed in the Apocrypha 1 Ejdr. 13.40. that fome think they went through Baimerina in Syria and the South part of Armenia the Great into the Berfian Dominions: For fpeak- ing of the Tranfmigration of thofe Tribes from Ijrael; Thefe are the ten Tribes (faith he) which were carried captives by Salmanafler in the time of King Hofea beyond the River Eu phrates i who refolving amongfl themfelves to leave the multitude of the Heathen and to fe- quefler themfelves into a Countrey where never mankind dwelt, they entred in at the narrow paf- j'ages of Arfareth, the Springs being by miracle dryed up untill they had paffed over, and after a year and a halfs journey from Arfareth they fat down, where they inhabited untill the later times. By which relation (notwithftanding Paulus Venem and others find this Arfaret in the moft Eafterly part of Scythia extra Imaum) albeit fome think they palfed through the Arabian deferts to Babylon ; others rieverthelefs fuppofe that their way was through that' part of Syria called Paimerina regio into Armenia, 'twixt thofe parts where Euphrates and Tigris have their Springs, and fo through the Iberian ftraits called Port* Caucafia ftrook into Mowndram, and thence into BaUria. But that BaBria was the Countrey they refted in cannot be imagined, feeing that was not remote enough for eighteen months travel hom Ararat, if we ihould grant that they were in motion, and Ararat ftridly to be in Armenia, being indeed not above 2 months journey thence*, but more efpecially feeing that IMtria was fo far from being uninhabited as the place fiiould be they defigned to with-Terjta. Tranfmigration withdraw themfelves unto, Baftria at that time flourilhing fo exceedingly that it had no lefs than a thoufand Cities. So as it may be rationally concluded, albeit in that de» jeded and deplorable condition thefe exiled Jem were defirous to find out fuch a defert Gountrey as Bfdras fpeaks of, it was doubtlefs an enterprize very difficult, in cafe they had the liberty to be their own choofers, which too rarely happens unto captives. For in thofe days through Noah's originary and after by Serrfs pofterity fucceifively the' oriental Countreys were better planted than faphets was, (for in Alexander's time, af ter fubverting the Perfian Monarchy, invading India and part of ScythU intra Jmaum, he reported that there he found more People and confequently more oppofition, and greater and wealthier Cities than he had done in his conqueft of all other that were under the Urokeof the Per/ian Scepter,even from Indus beyond thvHelkjpont ) therefore into what part of the World thefe poor Jem were pent is not fo eafily to be difcerned ; though I imagine they were not permitted to cohabit together; for then their increafing ge nerations would here as formerly in have rendred them formidable; but rather were feparated and made to plant in feveral Colonies, as were the other Tribes, in like manner tranfplanted. Howbeit, the caufe of their Baniihment appears in the Pro phecy of Jeremiah chap. 24. v. 9. where 'tis recorded, that by reafon of their proper^ fity to Idolatry they (hould be removed into all the Kingdoms of the Earth, and be come a reproach and a curfe in all places whither the Lord would drive them: Which was fulfilled ^ for tranfplanted we fee they were into the Eaft *, and feeing the Scripture declares not the placej 'tis of no avail more than to their feparation afterwards to make a more curious enquiry concerning it. Albeit Joyim Leunclavim in his Pandefts to Gt- mbrardy and fome others from the word Tattar in the Hebrew and Syriack^ importing a remnant, Giog-chan^ Gioc-Elf , and other proper Names,there ufed, Circumcifion long befordffhe publifhing of the Alcoran and other Jemjh Rites there pradifed, fancy to themfelves that into thofe then uninhabited parts the Jews withdrew: Which if fo, was in all likelihood to the N.E. of the Mare Cafprnm^ beyond Oxm and J ax arte s Rivers now called Nycaphtac and Chef el albeit Abulfeda and Rabbi Mofes-bar-Nachma in his Para- phrafe upon the Pentateuch conjedure that Gog and Magog (Mejhecs pofterity ) is not fo much a general as a particular name of Princes and Peribns of command in thofe Scy- thickJ?iovmcts, howbeit frequently mentioned in the Prophets and Ipecially in Bz,el^ 38, &amp;c. fo as that fuppofition is but weakly founded, atleaft in my apprehenfion. For of equal force is that tradition the Jews here inhabiting as yet retain. That die OfF- fpring of Dan, Z eh don, AJher and JVephthall being planted near Damoan under mount Taurus, but themfelves the Iflue of Reuben, Gad, and half Manaffes by Tiglath-pla^ar removed to this Jaaroon, and parts about Larr, the fame time the Inhabitants of Da- mafcus were by that Prince removed unto Kyr in Media)! Reg. 16.9. But that they Ihould fequefter themfelves from the reft of the World, was not without reafon for though the meaning thereof no doubt was to exprefs their forrow and defire to avoid the tem ptation of the Heathen ; yet feeing in thofe times of all forts of Men they were the leaft fociable as Ovid fays, having as Tacitus I. 5. Hojlile odium contra omnes alios, and in re quital thereof ftiled by the Heathen Men-haters, of all Nations the worft, and other like Epithetes 0 yet doubtlefs have inherited that voluntary execration they intailed unto their Pofterity at the condemnation.of our Saviour, living ever lince to our forrow we fee in an obdurate and wretched condition all the World over, and is thought will fo continue^ untill by miracle they be converted, as the Almighty fhall think fit ^ or at the perfonal return of CHRIST to judgment^ or of whichisthoughtwiUbealittle before the World's confummation: albeit as that great Scholar Mr. FW^obferves from Matth. 11.13. in John the Baptifl, Blias is already come. The tranflation of the Septua- gint which to Bliah adds the Thishite, being what doubtlefs in that Text milled St. Chry- fofiome. Moreover thefe Jews, notwithftanding their itch after Idol-worlhip is over, and that in the Synagogues they have a formal way of finging Service exprelfing very- little reverence, and differing from that which Ezra appointed *, yet have they no fa- crificing Prieft,holding no place proper fave Jerufalem, where the Chrifiians wonid op- pofe it as well as Turks. The five Books of Mofes they have agreable to ours: And al though they have no Tirfhatha or Civil Magiftrate of their own, or dare not break the peace where they live under Chrifiian, Mahometan or Gentile Government*, yet are not without feparation amongft themfeives, the five great Points controverted (in Auguftus Cafar's time) betwixt the two great Families of Shammai and Hillel ftill fpreading like a gangrene fo irreconcileably that till the TiJhbite comes (as one fays) none elfe will be able to agree them 5 not Rabbi Bias who from the firft verfe of the firft chapter of '6^- nefis where the letter Alevh is fix times found, cabaliftically concludes that the World R 2 ^ Iballc Balfam. Vloches* fhall endure juft fix thoufand years, Jlefh in computation ftanding for a thoufand, albeit he Ihould enter the lifts to vanquifh either party. But to return. in or near this place is a precious liquor or Mummy growing, Mnmnaly-koobos they call it, which none prefumes to take,it being carefully preferved for the King's foleufe, In June onely it diftils from the top of thofe ftupendious Mountains, every year about five ounces. A moift redolent gum it is,foveraign againft poyfon •, and (if we may be lieve them ) a Catholicon for all forts of wounds whatfoever; So as when other Princes fend Shaw-Ahhas Gold, Pearl, or like coftly prefents, he returns them a little of this Balfame as a fuitable requital. After Alexander had prey'd and facrificed in Snfa ( be trayed by Ahulites a time-ferving Satrapa) he led his wanton Army towards Perfepolis: his neareft paflage was over thefe Hills of Jaarown (in thofe days by Authors called PiU Perfidis and Sufaida) where to his amazement he was fo well beaten by Arioharzanes a valiant Perfiaa and his little Army, that (contrary to the accuftomed pace of the Worlds Monarch) he was conftrained to retreat, and find another way to avoid the llorm of ftones and arrows which that noble Perfian freely fent him. The eleventh of February we left Larr, Codgea-Ohdruzy the Governour having furnifli- ed us with Mules, emblemes of fobriety : Our Harbinger ( or Mammandore as called in Perfa) was an old Coaelbajh who would be fure (hopeful of foirie reward) at every place where we made our Manz,eel to provide us good quarters, and fuch meat as the places could affordby vertue neverthelefs or force rather of his authority domineering over the wretched Rufticks more than pleafed us; for he would profer them a little money for what he liked, which if they refufed, then nolens volens liQ would have it, and AlU , Soldado paid them with big words and hafiinadoes : So as we faw that in miferable flavery thefe Peafants live, contented to fubmit to the arbitrary will of the Souldier. Thefirft night we pitched our Tents not far fromZ^rr, but were flopped next day by aftmmo- derate flood of rain; which though it was very welcome, yet made the earth fo flippery as our Camels glib hoofs could not foot it. The rain falls feldom here *, but when it comes, they both feel and hear it: Sometimes it raifes fuch a deluge as fweeps Men and Houfes away 5 for (as we were told) fix Years before (in this very place ) a Caravan of two thoufand Camels in part periled by the fury of it. The fourteenth day we rode to JDe~achow (or Techoo) which fignifies a Town under a Hillwhere we faw many pretty Tombs, few without a Grave-ftone and an memorial. The Alcoran commands that none be buried in Cities) for fear the Dead infed the Living. This Jm fepiMri was according to the Ancients, quo cavebatur, Vt nemo fepalturam haberet in eodem loco quern dim Jepulchrdfrm occupaffet^SiLl 1.

He is of an extraordinary defcent for Nobility ( as Honour goes in thefe parts)his Fa ther and Grand-father having been Dukes afore him, but (which is no lefs ltrange)pri- viledged from degradation by Abbas his Oath upon a good occafion ; Aliculican his Fa ther having been vicflorious in fome engagements againit both T^r^and Tartar it added no Imall luftre to Mahomet Codobandaes Diadem : molt memorably when ( by command of Amurath ) the fawcy Bafca of Rhyvan with fifteen hundred Mufquets breathed defi ance againil Morad the Chielfal Governour for prefuming to take part with Ifmael in that famous overthrow they gave the Turks on the Calderan Plain in the year 1514. as they arrogate to themfelvesalbeit the Turks acknowledg it not. Morad being thus unex- pededly aifaulted, fends a timerous excule; which rather enraged the Bafha, who was not to be pacified till Morad had glutted his appetite with a Prefent of two thoafand pound in gold, commanding him thence to Najfivan ( old Artaxata) and by that time hungry again. Alicolichan (Shaw-Mahomet''s Lieutenant in Georgia J expr effing his difplea- fure againft Morad undertakes to make the TurJ^cat cold Iron, meat the Bajha cared not for, but by Ally-culicanh fierce charge with fix thoufand Horfe made him return his bribe back*, fo as after a fmall difpute the Turk^was forced to a fpeedy retreat over Anti~Tanrm ( now Mez.is~Tmr) and gave the valiant Georgian the liberty to extrad a treble Contribution from Morad for his compliance with the Turk,: and then return ing vidor to the Court, Abbas knowing that reward is as powerful a fupportof State as punifhment, for that good fervice recompenced him with the Shyraz. Dukedom, and his Son after him no lefs fortunate in Sha-Abbas his field-fervice,having quieted Georgia, fub - dued Zarr and Ormm, and made tributary part of Arabia and Diarbec. Some days after our being here the Great Duke abfented himfelf meerly to pleale his humour •, for albeit Sir Robert S her ley took the pains to, ride unto him, and to tell how acceptable his being in Town would be at the Ambafladour's Entrance, he an- fwer'd • It was no dilhonour for any Man (his Matter excepted) toftay his leifure: Not knowing or not confidering That the Perfons of Ambalfadours are facred, and challenge high refped in all places, according to the cuftofn.and confent of all Nations, both from S2 theip The lAmbaffadour feafled the reprefentation they make and the nature of their Implbyment: So that this would not have been endured had our Ambaffadour been provided with a Convoy and ne. ceflary accommodations for travel; which wanting, conftrained him to praftife pa, tience. After fix days attendance, his Eminency made his Entrance into Sheraz, attend ed with 2000 Horfe, where he took his eafe two d&amp;ys without the leaft notice of our Ambafladour. At length, finding that our Ambafladour would not make application to him, he fent a Gentleman to invite him to his Palace*, who returned with this an- fwer ; That he was weary, having come a great journey, and that his journey was to fee his Mafter. The Duke not pleafed with that meflage thought it beft neverthelefs to diflemble it, (knowing the King had given exprefs command that in his palFage he fliould every where receive honour and hearty welcome*,) fo after fome paufe, the Duke fent word he purpofed next day to vifit him: yet failed in his pnomife*, but his Son the BegUrheg ( eighteen years old) came in perfon to excufe him. Next day our Am- bailadour lent word by Shoe-Ally-beg to the Duke's Son, That his Vifit fhould be retalia ted ; Emangoly-cawn the Father feems to be difpleafed that he had not the honour of the firft Vilit, and marvelled what kind of People we were, fince his own little lefs than adored him ^ neverthelefs made ufe of it to his own fatisfadion •, for he was no fooner alighted near the Duke's Palace, when by Shoe-Ally-beg he was ufhered into a long gallery, rich in commun beauties, Plate, Carpets, and other furniture, where (contrary to expedition ) the Duke himfelf (like a flataa) at the end of the room fat crofs-legg'd, not moving one jot till the Ambalfadour was almoft at him; and then (as one affrighted ) skipt up, imbraced and bad him welcome*, vouchfafing alfo (upon knowledg that his attendants were Gentlemen) to give us the Hofljomdy foffhwardy, and to entertain us with a Banquet. So after two hours merriment we departed, invited to return next day to a more folemn welcome. The entertainment our Ambaifadour had was Wine and Sweet-meats, which were of variety, and then inter -pocuU but according to the common mode of thefeEafternpartsthedancingWencheswent to work, agree able to what Plntarch Symp. i. relates in his time.

Next day the Duke fenfible of his civil Treatment returned his thanks in a Prefent of twelve good Horfes, with bridles and rich faddles fuitine them; by which it appeared that all were pleafed, and the Ambalfadour ( who without fuch an entertainment had never fatisfied them)acqmrcd the Epithete of age- nerous and well-bred Perfon. After other Ceremonies of welcome (in which pifcalhes and gifts were not left out) we had leave to profecute onr travel towards the Court: 1 call it leave, the Duke now feemed fo unwilling to part with us: The Ambafladours Attendants alfo (purfuant to the Duke's direftions) were very well mounted and fur- nifhed withfrefli Camels and Afinegoes for ourSumpters; able Beafts, capable to en- dure the brunt of travel. Great is the difference betwixt the Turks and Per fans : For the Turks being by Law prohibited, abftain from Wine, yet drink it covertly *, but the Terfian now (as of old) drink with freedom openly and with excefs. It was fo of old *, tor Plutarch in the Life of Artaxerxes reports the Perfians were liberal Wine-bibbers and lovers of Magick^ Cyras craftily endeavouring to fupplant his Brother Artaxerxes in the Crown before the Battel of Coonexa being his Lieutenant in the lefTer Afia, the bet ter to ingratiate himfelf with the Lacedemonians writ unto them, and among other vertues boafted that he was fitter to rule than Artaxerxes: And the reafon he gave was this', He could drink more Wine and better underftood Natural Magick^ than his Bro ther did. Peradventure the fame genim was in this great Duke we are now fpeaking of.

Now, albeit the City was fuch, yet it cannot be deny'd but that her greatell luftre was borrowed from the lofty Palace of the Perfian Emperours, which both for Situation profped, richnefs in material, and curiofity of Art, rendred it incomparable. Pint arch in vita Alexandri calls it The proud and ftately Palace of the great King. Of that maieftv as put XhsMacedonianV idor into amazement at his entrance thereinto: For,in the prefence was a Stat&amp; of pure gold thick powdered with fparkling ftones, in which Alexander was mthroned ^ in the Bed-chamber (amongft other curiofities) an artificial Vine (prefented by Pythem) the ftalk of which was burnifhed gold, the clufters Orient Pearl mixt with Rubies of great price ^ and no lefs rich the Bed: the bedftead alfo was gold, and thick fet with gems; the Bolfter was eftimated worth five thoufand Talents, and the Foot ftool at three thoufand Talents of gold, (the Hebrew Talent is four thoufand five hun dred pounds;) fo that you may well wonder at the fum. Give me leave now to defcribe a part of this ftrudure, by which the whole may be imagined. It was built at the Eaft-end of a fpacious Vale, upon a Rock or rifing ground four hundred paces from the City, the plat containing fifty acres of ground or there abouts. The Walls on either fide were elaborately carved with 'figures of Men and Beafts. The fecond ftory was of Porphyre mixed with Marble of other feveral colours, imbelliflied with coftly ftones in Mofaick fort but the architrave, Freez^ and moft part of the Arches were ftudded with gold, being flat and tarraffed at the top. Towards the Eaft it had a high and ftately Tower or Keep, circled with a triple wall each higher than other, and at fuch a diftance as gave pleafant walks between: The firft was 16 cubits high *, the fecond was double as much *, the laft threefcore: all three of Marble well po- lifted battlemented above and below to be entred by feven gates of burnilhed brafs. From the ^nmit of that Tower the Kings had not onely a delightful profped over all the City that fpread it felf below, but (notwithftanding the Hills that furround the Plain) as it were an unlimited Horizon uncircumfcribed fave by Heaven it felf. Ad- joyning this was a Mounfwhich contained about four acres of ground, and built after the nobleft manner. It was the Maufoleum, in which and in the contiguous Hills were T in- 11! mm liJ * 1Chil'w (tffntiequities of loi rn1niir&lt;s Adiovning that ^as the Temple dedicated to Anaia, (^lo niana is there V nJd Siculns, Nanea in the 2 Aiacchrt. 1. 13.) equal to that at Echatan diofe timesCas Jofohus and others write) was fo exquifitely built and with fuch ^traordinary coft 5 that it excelled any other then extant in the World.

A fort of work thofe of old much gloried in. For the Temple at Delphosy Jrternifia's'Xomh, and that ereded by Alexander for his dear Epheftion were fuch /yea many reliques and broken pieces of fuch we find as yet remaining in old Monuments through feveral parts of Jfia, and in Europe alfo •, as at Conftanm^le the roof of Sanfta Sophia, at Rome the Temple of Bacchus now dedicated to St. Agnes ^ in Siena the Domo or Cathedral hath in the pavement large and very rare figures of this work in Venice that to St. Mario in Florence that to Cofmo the firft of the Medtces j and - towards the Eaft end of the Abbey in Wefiminfter the imitation of Mofaick.may be ob- ferved in the pavement, and in Edward the Confeifor's Tomb.

Of this work much is feen in the Quire of St. DomimckChmch in Bologne in Italy, where the ftalls are all of this kind, expreffing the ftory of fome part of the Old and New Tefta- ments. An Art much admired by Travellers. But alas! this rich and lovely City, yea the Palace it felf, albeit they forced admira tion and deferved commendation from the Greeks-, neverthelefs at a drunken feaft, in a debauched humour by the inftigation of Thais an infamous ftrumpet then following the Camp, to retaliate what Xerxes had in a hoftile way perpetrated whiles he was at Athens her native place, Alexander commanded nay helped to fet all on fire; an ad fo unbe coming that great Prince as when he more confiderately viewed the flame made him re pent v yea fo repent, that if poifible he would have quenched it with his tears: For as Sir Walter Raleigh notes. Wine often ingenders fury, and fury matter for repentance: But preceeding milchiefs are not amended by fucceeding lhame or lamentations. Never thelefs, this fad execution rendred that famous City as one fays of another places fo that nothing now remains fave what the mercilefs Fire could not devour, I mean the Walls and Pavements; which being of Marble and by expert Mafons hewn out of the main Rock, and by rare Artificers carved into ftory and grotefco work, have hitherto refilled air and weather; fo as if not defaced by babarous hammers and hands, it probably will remain a monument to exprefs the old Perfian magnificence unto all fuc ceeding Generations i for without an hyperbole, Mole faa ftuporem incutit fpeBantihus. At this day 'tis called ChHmanor, or CheheLminar as the Ferfians pronounce, which in their Tongue fignifies Forty Towers. The Palace (whofe mines I (hall now defcribe) was- (as I lately mentioned) built upon part of a Mountain of dark coloured Marble,which the great Achited of Nature has placed at the North-eaft end of that large Plain where the City of Perfepolis once ftood the middle of which was watered by the River Araxis (or rather Cho~Araxis) which Q. Cmtim lib. 5. and Straho lib, 15. fay, ftreamed about twenty furloAgs from Perfepolis, although others of equal authority name it Cyrm, which I ra ther approve, feeing the modern name it bears is Knr and Al-Chyr, as fome Perfians call it, albeit others call it Foully Gourck, or Kurkjis fome pronounce, a derivative from Kur or Cyr, i. e. Cyrm, over which is that notable ftone-Bridge built above two hundred years ago by Emyr~Hamz.e-Delamita a Perfian Prince of the Salgucim Race, in whofe memory 'tis called Bind-Emyr, i. e. the Princes Bridge. The circumference of the Plain (fur- rounded with rifing Hills) is near forty Englifh miles. About threefcore acres of this Mount which Diodorns Siculm /. 17. calls the Royal Hill, (but by the modern Perfians, Shttw- achoo and Choo-Rahmet, i, e. the Mountain of Mercy ) by extraordinary toil and Art was difleded and dellgned for the foundation and other accommodations of this marvellous ftrudure, which both for perpetuity and elegancy in fculpture was in feveral places funk and polilhed for lafting Walls and Pavements. The afcent into this Palace is at the Weft fide of the Hill by ninety five fteps, every ftep being twenty inches broad and three inches high one above another; the Stair-cafe (that is to fay from one fide of tns ^ J StairTerfepolis, Stair unto the other) is in breadth fix and thirty foot: but fo contrived that it gives a double paflage leading two feveral ways, one towards the North, the other South? each ftair alfo in the half way having a paufe or half-pace which is very large and fquare flagg'd with Porphyre and lined at the fides with a brighter coloured Marble than the Rock which divides the double ftair, and above the half-pace winds the contrary way to what it is below both being fo eafie that I very well remember we faw a dozen Per- fans ride up a breaft without crowding. The other Part of the Hill adjoyning this ftair is precipitious, in height being two and twenty foot as I gueffed (for I had no certain meafure,) feeming of old to have been fleightly damasked or wrought into croteique; and runs due North and South above five hundred paces, as did the Palace •, which thereby gave it felf a full profpedt to the City below, not unlike the view we have of Wtndfor Caftle from Eaton. At the ft air-head there is fome remain of the Gate or place of entrance into the Court, being about twenty foot wide, fo well as my uncertain way of meafuringby paces would afcertain: but the height of the Gate and what fuperftrudure it had is not now demon- ftrable. The profped we have from thence towards the, left hand is a large empty piece of ground, by gentle Hills bounded both to North and Eaft, feeming to have been fome Garden-plat or like place of recreation. But Eaftwards more near the ftair are the figures of four ftrange Beafts carved in ftone, not fuch Beafts as are in Nature, but rather as iflue from the Poets or Fiftors brains: At firft view I thought they had fome refemblance with thofe four monfters the Prophet Daniel in his nodurnal Vifion faw rifing out of the Sea, alluding to the four fupreme Monarchies; but by comparifon found my felf miftaken. Thefe qnadr^edes ftand two and two •, the firft two being about 20 foot from each other look towards the ftair-, the other two have the fame diftance from one another in breadth, but are thrice that fpace in length from the two former, and have their faces turned towards the Hill, which is the contrary way : So as it is pro bable, thefe four beafts together with the four interpofing pillars^ of which two are fallen and two remain ferved (as one may imagine ) to fupport fome Gallery or Tar- rafs that had its profped North towards the Garden, under which a piazza was where attendants might walk&gt; and South towards the Palace. The main ftrudure ranges all along towards the South from the top of the ftair, the profped being moft part to the Weft, the Hill towards the Eaft interpofing. One of the four beafts (to give it the neareft refemblance 1 can) is like an Elephant •, and the fecond (being neareft to it) is fomewhat like his oppofite, a Rhinoceros •, the third is like unto a Pegafus, or rather that volant Gryffin Jrioflo defcribes in his Orlando furiofo } but the fourth is fo disfigured that it cannot be defcribed: Howbeit, herein thefe beafts differ, for two of them have vifages with beards and long hair like Men, agreeable to that fourth beaft which Daniel chap. 7. verf. 7. looked upon as the moft dreadful, prefiguring the Roman Empiretheir heads are armed with helmets or caps of defence, upon the necks of which are great round globes of like material: And the Pegafus is trapped with warlike mail, fo ftud- ded that it feems a fort of Mofaic^o^ and in fuch lively and permanent colours as if it had been imboffed or wrought but very lately. A few paces thence is a large fquare ftone Ciftern or Laver, twelve foot in diameter and twelve inches thick, fupported by ftpnes of a large fize: Near which (ftill towards the South) are the fradures of fome pillars *, but of what ufe, feeing they are demoli- ihed, cannot well be afcertained. Flanking this is a Wall that runs from Eaft to Weftj which I fuppofe is part of the Mountain, and terminates that room to the Southward ^ it is Marble, about nine foot thick and thirty foot high. Near the middle there is an other double ftair of thirty or forty fteps *, as alfo a half-pace in the half way, flagg'd with large fquare Marbles and faced at the fides with figures imbelhlhed and carved by no rude hand. This brought us to a large fquare room which I fhall anon fpeak of. In the firft place therefore I return to. the foot of this ftair, to take a view of the Wall or Frontifpiece ; which on either fide the ftair has engraven tn relievo feveral figures and in feveral fows over each other, refembling fome memorable proceffion: The Images on either fide have their faces towards the ftair, as if they were to march that way. Thole that be figured in the loweft rank, by their habit and pofture feem to be of inferiour quality •, for the At job a or garment moft of them wear reaches fcarce to the knee,and is fomewhat ftrait near the wafte where 'tis girt about, but towards the skirt more large and circular, according to that form we fee the Moors wear at this day in Indnftan : Some are naked downward, others have Calzoons reaching to the calf of the legs ^ fome be bare-foot, and others wear Sandals. Howbeit, thefe feem to be of the Military pro- fefiion •, for in one hand they hold a Spear upright in the fame pofture a pike is ordered, T 2 buti/^o ChiUmynar,or ^Antiquities of but in the other hand there is variety ; for one carries fomewhat that is of a circular form, others baskets with fruit, others fome chefts with boxes not unlike the Sitndonghs now ufed in Ferfta wherein they carry Preferves and Dates, pots for perfume, and the like: Some alfo lead a Horfe, others an Elephant, and fome a Camel other fome a Mule, and fome lead Oxen and Sheep with long ears, high nofes and horns very odly diftorted. This folemnity induces fome to think it is the reprefentation of fome remar kable Sacrifice and the rather, for that not far from thence and in like fculpture feveral figures of their Priefts or Magi are carved, amongft which is an Arch-flamen. Now whereas there is a Horfe led with the reft, and peradventure for Sacrifice, JDi^d. Skulasy Xenoyhon in the Life of Cyrus, Herodotus lib. 7. and other Hiftorians acquaint us] that in old time it was commonly pradifed by the Per fans. And concerning the de dicating a Horfe to the Son their Deity represented by the Mythra, refieding upon the Sun's fwift motion, as Vierim obferves in his Hieroglyphic^ ; we have fomething typified in that famous eledion of Darius Hyfiafpis) as alio in that memorable march of the laft Darius againft Alexander before their engagement at where Quinm Curtim re lates, how that the Horfe dedicated to the Sun followed the white Chariot of Jhpiter, af ter which went the Arch-flamen that carried the holy Fire as the Perfians efteem'd it. The Romans after like manner in Pomya Circenfis led Horfes in honour of the Sun, a cuftome derived from the Perfians, whofe King in his greateft magnificence caufed his beft Horfe richly trapt to be led in ftatesand the Chariot alfo dedicated to the Sun, CoeURhod. Antiq, /. 8- chap. 2. Horfes ufually oftheNyfean breed, faith Philoftratm 1. 14. c. 17. This grofs Idolatry fpred it felf alfo amongft the Kings of Judah, who in 2 Reg. 23.11. are re proved, in that after the manner of the Gentiles they likewife had devoted Horfes to the Sun. Sundry other figures are engraven here in garb little differing from the former, but in their Weapons they do *, for fome are armed with Lance and Shield, and fome have fhort clubs with thick round bunches at the end like that I have feen ufed by the favage Floridans in war others have them headed with fpikes, fuch as I cannot reprefent by comparifon j and other fome carry Borneo's. Amongft the reft there is a Chariot which has two wheels, drawn by a fingle Horfe, the Charioter going by it; which fort of Cha riot is, not unlike that the Roman Dittators andother Generals fat in in triumph,as repre- fented by Laurus •, fo that this without doubt was either appropriate to the Kings own life, according to the relation and others give concerning Darius his March*, or (which is more probable) was facred to the Sun. In the upper rank, the Images are more large and majeftical, by their habit and man ner of Seffion feeming to reprefent fome fovereign Princes, as may be prefumed by the Tiara or high fharp-pointed Caps that are upon their heads,which none in thofe days durft cover with but Princes of the Blood, and they onely by permiffion: They have .alfo chains of gold about their necks, as fome prime Satrap had the priviledg to wear. Thofe of the upper rank wear long Robes or Garments, the Perfians thereby appearing to be G ens togatahzfotQ the Romans: And indeed we may obferve that from Poland that garb continues in ufe amongffc all the Oriental Nations, But the greateft variety is in the attire or drefs of their heads; for belides the Tiara which was worn by Sereni(fmo''sy the Cidaris was worn by feveral fort, as King, Prieft and People. Now as I find cc- cafion, give me leave to make a few curfory obfervations. And firft concerning long hair. Albeit in thefe modern times I find it is the common mode of the Eaftern People to fhave the head all fave a long lock which fuperftitioufly they leave at the very top, fuch efpecialty as wear Turbans, Mandils, Duftars, and Puggarees: In ancient times neverthelefs it is apparent (witnefs thefe Images) That the nobler fort of Men wore their hair very long. Herodotus lib. 6. and Athenaus lib.4. afford Us lome examples. Perfa a prolixa &amp; jpeciofa coma qua capillati fanty Comatos dicuntur, Cwhence alfo part of Gaule had its denomination,) fhort hair in thofe days being ac- counted a mark of fervitude. Likewife in that fharp and memorable conteft betwixt tv !? Broth ers Q to an d Artaxerxes for the Crown, Cyrus being flain and ftripped a- mongft many other dead corps, could not ( fave by his long hair ) be difcovered. And as to uiams 01 gold, they were accuftomed to be worn by Favourites and Perfons in principal truft amongft thofe Nations, as recorded in facred Writ concerning Jofefh, r an ' ^ ■^ r1 ^ P ro phane Stories many examples, as of Aftyages the tan ing( contemporary with Nabuchadneazar) whofe exteriour Veft or Garment • embroidered, his hair alfo was of great length and crifped, his tfe Womin an§UI ^ ed Wltl ?

Which neverthelefs was foon after converted fnto as we have authority m bh. Heft. 5.2. where Ahafmrm the Perftan King held out the golden Scepter in his hand for the Queen to touch in %n of favour and probably it was in- nched with precious ftones, with which this great Prince was fo delighted that the Jewels he ufuajly wore were eftimated at ioooo Talents. In the other he holds a Mound or round Ball figmfymg Sovereignty Some others feem to be of principal note ; for they have round folded Caps a fpan long and flat at the top, not unlike to Caps of State or Maintenance ; with long Vefts in large plats and folds, and ample fleeves like unto the ancient Maunch or Surplice, and armed with fliort crooked Scemiters ftuck thwart their breafl: into a girdle: And other fome (according to the mode now ufed there) wear high peaked Caps, fuch as I found worn in and in the right hand they hold a fliort Staffor Batoonfuch as in pidturesare given.Generals or thofe that have eminent Command in Armies. Others referable Souldiers, and are armed with Sword and Dagger, Half-pike and Bow with very large Arrows i but their quivers are of an antick fliape different from thofe which are at this day ufed. There are alfo the figures of Lions contending for prey, Tygres, Goats and other Beafts. And in vacant places be twixt the Images the Wall is damasked a lagrotefco or adorned with Trees and Land- skips; which though not drawn by Lyfippm, neverthelefs for the great Antiquity thev bear may worthily receive acceptation from any Traveller. Adjoyning thefe towards the Weft is a Jafper or Marble Table about twenty foot from the pavement, wherein are infcribed about twenty lines of Charaders, every line being a yard and half broad or thereabouts*, all of them very perfed to the eye, and the ftone fo well polilhed that it referves its luftre. The Characters are of a ftrange and unufual fhape*, neither like Letters nor Hieroglyphicks yea, fo far from our deciphering that we could not fo much as make any politive judgement whether they were words or Charaders; albeit I rather incline to the firft, and that they compre hended words or fyllables, as in Brachyography or Short-writing we familiarly pradife: Nor indeed could we judge whether the Writing were from the right hand to the left, according to the Chaldee and uliial manner of thefe Oriental Countreys} or from the left hand to the rigljt, as the Greeks, Romans and other Nations imitating their Alphabets have accuftomed : Neverthelefs, by the pofture and tendency of fome of the Chara- ders ( which confift of feveral magnitudes) it may be fuppofedthat this writing was rather from the left hand to the right, as the Armenian and Indian do at this day. And concerning the Charaders, albeit I have fince compared them with the twelve leveral Alphabets in Poftellm, and after that with thofe eight and fifty different Alphabets I find in Purchaj, molt of which are borrowed from that learned Scholar Gromay which indeed comprehend all or moft of the various forms of Letters that either now are or at any time have been in ufe through the greateft part of the Univerfe, I could not perceive that thefe had the leaft refemblance or coherence with any of them : which is very ftrange, and certainly renders it the greater curiofity *, and therefore well worthy the Scrutiny of fome ingenious Perfons that delight themfelves in this dark and difficult Art or Exercife of deciphering. For, how obfcure fbever thefe leemed to us, without doubt they were at fome time underftood, and peradventure by Daniel, who probably might be thefurveyour and inftrud the Architedor of this Palace, as he was of thofe memorable Buildings at Shujhan and JEchatan) for it is very likely that this ftrudure was raifed by Aflyages or his Grandfon Cyrus, and is acknowledged that this great Prophet (who like- wife was a Civil Officer in highelt truft and repute during thofe great revolutions of State under the mighty Monarchs Nehmhodonofor, Beljhazzar, Aftyages, Darius and Cy- rus ) had his myfterious Charaders: So as how incommunicable foever thefe Charaders be to us, (for they bear the refemblance of pyramids inverted or with bafes upwards, Triangles or Delta's, or (if I may fo compare them) with the Lamed in the Samaritan Alphabet, which is writ the contrary way to the fame Letter in the Chaldee and Hebrew:) yet doubtlefs in the Age thefe were engraven they were both legible and intelligible i and not to be imagined that they were there placed either to amufe or to delude the fpedators : for it cannot be denied but that the Terfians in thofe primitive times had Letters peculiar to themfelves, which differed from all thofe of other Nations, according toH ChiUmynar, or 1 ill 1 ti:| : ffl Mllli . , ^ n.- vv1 ^ r , T , of a 1 par tied Author, Perfa proprios hah eb ant CharaBeresy qmhodie S3a?2SS l--~ •' 11 »« •-* *» infert a few of thefe for better demonftration. Which neverthelefs whiles they cannot ba read, will in all probability like the without the help of a Darnel hardly be interpreted. . Adjoyning thefe is a fpacious room, belt refemblmg a Halli albeit fome think it was a fervmaMechit or Temple: the dimenfion by the ruinous walls that compafs it may very well be difcerned. In it there are nineteen columns or Pillars, moft ot which are per- fed, albeit fome have their Capitals either broken or defacedand upon thofe the Storks build their nefts, whom Winter weather offends more than do the People who have them in little lefs than veneration. Thofe that remain entire are (contrary to ufual form) lharp towards the fummit or top: fo that it is not eafie to guefs what manner of arch or fuperftrudure it fupported fave what I have defcribed concerning Perfepolis or of what kind of ftrudure the whole was, whether agreeing with the Ionic, Doric or Corinthiac. In height thefe Pillars are about twenty cubits,which at theleaft make 30 foot ^ and in com pafs near three yards and a half,allowing for the intervals betwixt every flute *, for they are all round and fluted, every Pillar having forty flutes, and every flute three full inches as I meafured and diftant from each other about nine yards. The capitals have their mouldings enriched *, the pedeftals alfo wrought into Grotefque with figures, and both Pillars, Capitals and Pedeftals all of the belt fort of white Marble 5 and ranked in per- fed order or rows, fuch as we fee in Cathedrals, or in the Halls of Uluftrious Princes. Now albeit there be but nineteen Pillars at this day extant, yet the fradures and bafes of other one and twenty more are perfpicable: from whence and from the refemblance they bear with the Alcoranesy u e. high (lender Turrets which the Mahometans ulually ered for ufe and ornament near their Mefquits, they term thefe Minars, i. e. Towers: So as 'tis probable, that forty of thefe Pillars were ftanding fuch time as the Perfians gave this place that new denomination*, but how long it has been impofed, thole I asked the queltion of could not fatisfie,the precedent Name being utterly forgotten. Notwith- ■ Itanding this limitation, it is evident there were in all an hundred Pillars when the place was inperfedion-, as appearsby the vacant fpaces and alfo by the bafes or founda tions of feveral rows of Columns which are yet vifible j in the whole amounting to that number. Hence afcending a few Marble fteps we entred into another large fquare Chamber, which might be a room of Prefence: 1 paced every fide ( an uncertain but the belt way of ineafuring I could then make,)and found them fourfcore and ten paces the 4 fides making three hundred and threefcore paces. Into this large room are eight feveral doors, but unequal places of entrance: For, I found four of them have fix, the other two four paces. Each door ftead is compofed of feven well-poliihed black Marble ftones clofe laid one upon another; every ftone about twelve foot in length, and four foot in height^ which, as alfo the walls and broken arches were wrought or pourtray'd with figures re- fembling fome great Perfons on horfeback, after whom proceed feveral others in fa- cerdotal habits bearing branches in their hands, followed by fundry others that lead along with them Beaits of feveral fpecies •, but whether by way of Triumph or for Sa crifice, I know not. Out of this we palfed into another room contiguous to the former; which fome Per fans in company perfwaded us had been a Nurfery •, other fome that it was part of a Seraglio. The room is large though unequal in the fides; for I found two were threefcore, and the other two threefcore and ten of my largeft paces: It had feven doors for en trance; _ fT'erfepolk. trance •&gt; probably typifying their Alyihra or the Sun with leven gates which the Terfians had irl divine adoration, myfterioully reprefenting the feven Planets. Adioynin? this was another which in pacing I found how two fides thereof were twenty, the other two thirty of my largeft paces: The walls here (as of the reft) were of black Marble' but fo incomparably polifhed and glazed, that we beheld it with admiration: For fe- veral parts of-it were as bright and fplendent as Tuch or Steel-mirrour, fo as we could very perfedly fee the reflex of our faces and bodies when we ftood before it In other fome places the gold alfo that was laid upon the Freez and Cornilh, as alfo upon the trim of Veils, was alfo in as perfed luftre as if it had been but newly done * which is to be wondred at, the violence of weather to which 'tis expofed and length of time (being upwards of two thoufand years ) difly confidered : An Art of great value with the Ancients and longeft preierved amongft the Monafticks as we find upon figures and capital Letters in old VellamManufcripts and Bibles-, but fince, well-nigh loft, or by our Painters now a days but meanly imitated. The fculpture on both fides the wall has for ornament variety of figures fomewhat larger than the life, (unlefs thatMeninthofe times were greater than now they are',) fome of which Images reprefent Sovereign Princes, as by their fitting, habit and ornaments may be imagined^ for they are feated in antique Chairs of State, the hair upon their heads being very long and crifb, and about it fome wear high-peaked Tiara's, which Venetian Ducal Cap moft refembles j and in little, the Tag or Iharp point the Moz.endram CooWs have that are lined with cu- nous wool; or that you fee worn by the old Inhabitants of Ferpa in my following De- fcription of Spaham. Others have Caps that be flat and round, and other fome more high and folding like Caps of State, which together with the long Robes or upper Vefts they wear is refembled by thofe our Knights of the Garter ufe at St. George's Feaft, or Inftallation of the Knights of that moft honourable Order; differing onely in the fleeve which is more large and purflmg,like thofe we fee worn by Bilhops, fave that thefe be * wider and loofer at the hand. In their hand one holds a half-pike, another aPaftoral ilafF, others ihort thick Truncheons or Staffs of Command^ a General's weapon is his Truncheon, a Souldiers his Sword', the one ferving for Command, the other for Exe cution and in the other hand they hold round Balls or Mounds, lignifying ( as I fup- pole) Sovereign Dominion. Amongft other attendants, two Officers of State are re markable : for one of them holds a Sumbriero over his head, which probably was not fo much for fhade as State, and gave rife to the Royal Canopies which in thofe primitive times and after were ufed: the other ereds a Mace or like Enfign of Honour crooking towards the end, in thofe days doubtlefs reckoned amongft the Regalia. Upon the Freez and Architrave over the heads of the Images are fome Charaders in- fcribed which differ from thofe I lately mentioned,bearing(fo well as the diftance would fuifer me to judge) a little refemblance with the Letters anciently of ufe amongft the Georgians which were corrupted from the Greekj And if fo, it cannot be withftood. That as to moft Nations the Syrians have given Language, fo unto the Greeks Arts and Sciences of moft forts owe their original; and concerning whom in Travel (to Ipeak: the truth) we meet with more memorials of Antiquity than we find extant of fucceed- ing Romans, or indeed of any other Nation. In lefler figures are reprefented the Sa trap or Per fan Nobility; who with their Arms ftand on the one fide of thofe Maje- ftick figures, and on the other the Magi or Arch-flamens, fome of which hold Lamps, others Cenfers or perfuming-pots in their hands. I queftioned fome of the beft fort of Per fans then in company, whom they thought thofe Princes did reprefent ? One faid. He fuppofed Keyomarras , another Jamjheat or Shem-jheat Noejhano, i. e. Shemflim Noe, quarm Rex Per far mn *, as Saddi in his Rofarmm wittily fancies: a third y4aron or Sampfony a fourth Afl~char, i. e. Ard-fnr the laft of the Per fan Kings in the hundredth defcent from Adam, though I think it means Ahafmerm (whom fome make the founder of this Palace •, which I cannot think was a Temple, both from the variety of Rooms and afcents, as alfo from the nature of the Story pourtray'd in fculpture-,) and another Zul- niman as they call Solomon: whereas I expeded that in thefe various conjedures their famous Champion would have had mention, concerning whom I have formerly given my appsehenfion. Now for as much as the remaining figures or Images are many and different, yea lb many, as in the two days ftay I was there it was impoffible I could take the full of what I am aifured an expert Limner may very well fpend twice two months in e're he can make a perfed draught-, for to fay truth, this is a work much fitter for the Pencil than the Pen: the rather, for that I obferve, how that Travellers taking a view of fome rare piece together from the variety of their fancy they ufually differ in their obfervations •, .'4?ChiUmynar, or fo that when they think their notes are exadt, they lhall pretermit fomething that a third will light upon; a defeft the Painter can belt fupply. And feeing I did not take them in order as I went from place to place, I lhall neverthelefs frbm the Idea and mixt notes I then took, enumerate the particulars =, fo as upon the whole I lhall leave little nnfpoken that is remarkable. ^ . r . ,, Thefe walls in their perfedion doubtlefs exprelled an unfpeakable majefty : Howbeif through length of time and barbaroufnefs of People they are in fome parts broken and' demolifhed, although the arches and fquare fragments yet remain ^ fo as the Story that is engraven upon the Marble (which is high and thick) continues to this day in many places unblemifhed. Upon the wall in fculpture is figured a Perfon of quality ( as his habit declares) con tending with a Lion, whom with his right hand he grafps by the leg to prevent his out rage and thereby feems to have the vidory, ( the conteft with Lions being no unufual pradice with the Perfians.) Near them are two inferiour or fervile Perfons; one of which holds as it were a flaming torch in his hand (than which Lions fear nothing more) the other a basket full of provifion j but the basket for fhape differs from any I have feen in other Stories. Near this is a fquare of five broken pieces refembling arches and windows, 'twixt which upon both lides are the figures of fome great Princes, molt of which as to their habits are little differing from thofe I lately defcribed, albeit their pollures vary •, for fome of them are wraftling with Lions* Betwixt the arches are flat pieces of walls lower than the arches; imbroidered with feveral forts of antick work with figures in- termixt; and Characters writ upon the top difficult to our underftanding. Adjoynin? that is the figure of a Monarch, whofe right hand grafps a Scepter of unufual length for part of it feems to be under ground : and behind him ( but in lefs proportion) at tend divers of his fervants: one of which advances fomething towards his head which I took for fome kind of Mace, though much differing from thofe great Maces we ufe in England'^ others bear lighted torches or flambeauxes, for they are large. Nigh whom is an Image Of monftrous fhape •, for albeit the body be like a Man, he has Dragon's claws inftead of hands, and in other parts is deformed; fo that doubtlefs it was an Idol and not unlike fome Pamha's 1 have feen amongft the Brachmam in -the Momh Countrey, all which are of as ugly a fhape as can be imagined: There are alfo feveral armed Men which hold Pikes in their hands; ereded. Thence afcending four eafie Heps upon the walls, we fee cut the effigies of feveral Perfons in Pontifical habits,' moll of them following as in a file each other: In their hands they carry feveral things, fome of which refemble Difhes and Cenfers. Near forty ^aces thence in another large fquare room is the pourtrait of fome great Perfon-, for he has the Regal Robe upon his fhoulders and the Tiara upon his head, and is followed by fundry Petitioners but m feveral habits, as Men of feveral Nations ^ and may be pre- fumed fuch both by their different habits and for that they have fcriots in their hands which they feem to prefent the King, in the nature of fuppliants. In the rear march the Guard, fome armed with Spears and Swords and fome with Bows, who alfo hv the long enfped hair they wear feem to be of more than ordinary quality; for even in thofe times that gave fome diftinaion.

The front is artificially engraven into the fimi litude of Men and Beafts in various poftures v as Men combating with Lions and other wild Beafts of iundry Ihapes, and Bea.fts one againft another. Among the reft is the figure of a Horfe preparing to defend himfelf againft a Lion ; but fo rarely fancied as gains the Sculptor praife fuffic.ent, the pofture is fo natural fuch as when that A?t was moie inperfedion, would hardly have been bettered. Over and on each fide the door through which we entred, are carved in the Marble feme Men armed with Sword and Pike and forae with Targets i over whofe heads upon the Architrave are Chara ders engraven which like the reft prov'd adverfe to our intellea. Near that is a fecond fubterranean pailage into another fquare Chappel, ftronglv ar died and fupported with four white well-wrought Marble pillars,each about feven yards high', (for ns prefumd that the greateft part of this pile was vaulted underground) Near which is a fair Arch of like ftone, whereupon is engraven a Man of an extraor dinaryfize wearing his hair extraordinary long and curl'd both upon head and beard the laft or which is cut fquare alter the mode of the aged devout • his head is covered with a flat round Cap, and at his feet (in lign of Eminency or Conqueft) a Lion couchant is placed. Another Man a few fteps thence holds a Crooking ftalF, Mace or other enfign of Magiftracy in one hand, and a Lamp in the other. Several Pike-men alio feem to guard the place, who appear onely trom the wafte upwards Ni^h thpfp is another Sovereign Prince (in thefe particulars 1 repeat not, feeing they'are ftveral gures) royally feated in a Chair of State. In his right hand he holds a lone Scepter fuch as I have formerly mentioned. On the one fide an Officer of State advances his Mace or fuch like Enfign towards the Prince's head. A little higher a Man is placed upon one knee, and by his bowing pofture ( albeit his face be turned towards theNorth-weft) feems to fupplicate fome Deity. On either fide the Prince in two feveral ranks ftand many Flamens whofe heads are filletted ( for 'tis that gave them their Names) and in their facerdotai gaiments holding up their hands and joyning them together, dancins andre joycing as m old times was ufed in to the Sun, their Not far thence is the like Story; in phis onely differing, here the Prifoner being upon his feet makes his profpeft towards the Eaft, with his finger either faluting the riling Sun, or feeming to Contemplate Heaven. 0 , A fewpace 8 thence are figured two Giants who by pure force fubjed two Lions whom they hold down by their hands faftned within their hair. Nigh them are placed another Guard of Foot armed with Spear and Sword, as it were fafeguarding fome notable Pnfoner. Adjoymng that is the image of another Sovereign Prince, in habit and po- Iture little differing from the former •, only the Scepter here rather refembles a Bifhops or FaftoraUlafi; which he holds ered in his right hand. At firfl: view I imagined it was the Image of an Arch-flamenbut more deliberately, That it rather reprefents fome Sovereign Prince. Now, albeit of late times Kings amongft the Infidels in fome parts imitate our Europaan Monarchs, not onely in ftatc but alio in their Regal Ornaments of Grown and Scepter ^ neverthelefs of old the variety was far more in thofe diftin- dions For (that I may not exceed my bounds) in Per/ia, the Diadem, the Mythr^the TL ara and the Cydaru, .with the Wreath or Chaplet were the Regalia of old, as now the Mandtln with which the Shaugh, and with the JPn^aree the Moml^ head is adorned. Amongft thefe the Mythra, ( which fome make one with the Cydaris, as in Zcch. 3. where after the vulgar Latine, Cydaris is tranflated Myter) was not leaft in efteem with Kings, feeing it gave the agnomen to the Ferfian King Chedor-Laomer ; albeit the Priefts of Jupiter and the Sun were in folemnities and noted Sacrifices alfo permitted to wear it. Ihe Diadem was a Royal Band, faith Pint. Vita Demetrii ; and properly flgnifies a Roll or wreathed Head-band: or a filk Ribbond wreathed about the forehead, laith pmfm, which were firft attributed to the Heathen gods, as were Crowns of gold. Bnt in after Ages Diadems were worn by Kings and Sovereign Princes, who inftead of Crowns had Maces, which were in no.lefs veneration. Maces by fome being worfhip- ped as godswhence it is that the Images of the Heathen Deities ufually had Scepters or Maces in their hand, Juflin /. 5.

The Mythra in like fort was.an ornament for the head; made of pure fine linnen^ as we find recorded Exod. 28 .39. and of like ufe as furr'd-'Caps be with Kings and Princes, when they wear their Crowns. The Myter being put upon Aaron's head, the holy Crown was put upon the Myter Exod. 29. 6. and being an ornament for the head, was with little variation worn by Women as well as Men: Mythrx cram capitis ormmenta, mdieribm ^ fropri^6 ChiUmynar,or aAntiquities of propria, faith Serviw in his Comment upon the 9. lib.

The Kings refembled a Cap of feveral pieces of filk of various-colours fow'd together, riling Itraight up with a (harp top, not bending, as thofe which were worn by inferior Princes in token of fubjedion.

So that as that attire became diftinguifliable, in like fort was the Paftoral-ftaff, which albeit properly attributed to the Flamen or principal Magus, Kings neverthelefs fometimes ufed to hold. Now, albeit they never were convertible terms, the Pontifex ufually deriving his Civil power from the Regal; yet in regard Kings (whofe charge it is both in Spirituals and Temporals to take care of the People) even amongft the tiles have oft-times exercifed the Sacerdotal fundion (which amongit the Jews after the Law was in fome cafes fliarply reproved i as 1 Sam. 13. 13.^-2 Chron. 26. 19.) Give me leave therefore to quote Virgil, lib. 3. zALneid. concerning tALneas who facrificed a white Bull unto Jupiter, upon which the Commentator obferves, Tunc erat hie mos ut Reges ejfent Sacerdotes uel Pontifces : And La Cerda likewife, That Princes in old times have fundry times executed the Prieftly Office : and concerning which I might inftance ieveral examples befides that in lacred Writ of Melchifedeck^ who was both King and Plielt. But in prophane take that of Annim, who (Virgil, lib. 3.) was Rex idem Homi- mm Phoebif Sacerdos. Whence probably it is that out of Cicero and others, our Rider m his Diaioxary notes that Epifcopi aliquando Monarch# appellantur which the Babylonian Cahph and Roman Pontifces by reafon ot their mixt power and ufurpation over the juft eights of Sovereign Kings and other Potentates according to my apprehenfion moft re- lembJe.

And yet feeing fome ima- S i ne »5 ftrudture was raifed by the diredion of Cyrw the Magnificent, (who ruled circa A. M. 3400. and whofe fupreme Officer the Prophet Daniel for fometime was) it may without offence be prefumed Darnel ■, who when Ae was the Prefident or Chief of the hundr'ed and twenty Princes mentioned in by the envy or rather confbi- racy of thole Ethnique Princes or Governours he was accufed for worfhipping God contrary to that impious Decree of Darim ■, for which he was arraigned, condemned and call; into the Den of Lions. Otherwife it may reprefent Cmfm that unfortunate dian King ; who being deluded by the Oracles-amphibology engaging againft the TVto, became Cyrus his prifoner; and had fuffered, but by calling upon S.te in that his lament able condition: For feeing B^Jha^r the laft ^Jfyriav Mornarch (to whofe fubverfion Cyrus principally contributed) was flain, it cannot properly reprelent that sreat Con quell and Revolution. ° About a large ftones calt thence over continued heaps of rubbilh, wherein doubtlefs are buried many rare pieces of Art, is a void fpace, in which as my thoughts prom pted that famous Temple ftood which was dedicated to Diana there called Amya ! in its time reputed next to that at Ephefm the molt curious piece throughout the World. At the Eaft-end there rifes a Hill or Rock*, upon part of which,about fifty foot from the ground , in like Sculpture is the figure of a King, who with ereded hands feems to adore the nfing Sun. Near which, fo well as my fight would ferve at fuch a diftance, I fan cied that I law the Fire and a Serpent engraven: which being molt obvious to wind and weather, is molt worn and lealt perfpicable. The lifting up of the hands in worfhip has of long time been a pofture alfo ^amongft Heathens, Omnes homines preces faftwi manm ad Ceelum tollant y faith Ariftotle libra de Mando : Duplices ad fydera palmas, Chidim: And Siiptnas ad Coslum cum 'voce manmy Virgil. Moreover, that the Perftans of old were Polytheifts may be proved by thefe three Idols. For albeit the grand Parotha by bein^ the tutelary Nttmen of the place was in moft repute 5 the Fire neverthelefs was their principal Deity, for with them it reprefented Omnipotency ^ as the Sun the Hierody- phick of Eternity j and the Serpent, Time's revolution and fagacity: Which laft was worlhipped by the Ophita 5 and both that and Trees were had in Divine eftimation by the Indians in honour of Liber Pater and c/Efculapim, as we are informed by Alex ah Alexandria. The Serpent and Fire in like fort were adored by the Lithuanians of old, and Trees alfo: Lithuani ah origine colehant Numina, Ignem, Syhas, &amp; Serpentes, mos ve~ mrabantury Mmfier 4. lib. Cofmogr. Befides thefe, they had feveral Elementary gods * for as Herodotus m his firft Book relates, Soli, Luna, Igni, TelUri, Aqu*, &amp; rentis&gt;Perfl Jacrificant, They worlhipped the Sun, Moon, Fire, Earth, Water and Winds ^ yet had neither Temples,lmages nor Altars,fo writes Herodotus in his firft Book; albeit Strabo and others fay the contrary and by their Reliques it appears they had^ yea, Plutarch Vna Artax. mentioned their invocating Juno, Pluto and other Grecian Deities for the health of his wife Atojfa, i. Eft her. Scarce ten yards diftant from thefe, but upon the fame declivity or front of the Mountain, in like fculpture is figured the Image of their grand Pagotha, a Damon of as uncouth and ugly aihape as well could be imagined; and if reverenced by thofe wretches, Jure it was not in love, but rather with a Ne noceat, bafe fear too often drawing da- ftardly fpirits into vile fubjedion. It is of a gigantick fize or magnitude, ftanding as upright as his deformed pofture will permit, difcovering a moft dreadful vifage 'twixt Man and Beaft: Under his chin is a large maw or other thing like unto a fatchel; but for what ufe, 'tis a queftion whether the Sculptor underftood it. This monfter has feven feveral arms on either fide ( as if defcended from Briarem, ) and inftead of hands he ftretches forth his vultures claws, his body being fomewhat diftorted. What the mean ing of thefe feven arms fliould be, is hard to guefs: But according to my fancy, they U 2 maymay fi CT nifie on the one fide the terrene power and dominion thofe Kings had over fo many Kingdoms or Provinces', and the other, a myfterious type ot the feven great Planets which the Per fans had in adoration, Deos enim illos ejfe feptem P lamas quos Anu mam credidit Jmiquitas, faith Poflellw. And albeit this Pagodzs to form be moft ter rible to behold, yet in old times it feems they gave it reverence •, and to qualifie the dreadfulnefs of the figure, thofe more recent tell us that it reprefents the greateft Prince Tcrfia ever had, both in reference to extent of Empire and to the power he had over In fernal Spirits whom by magick fpells he ufed to bind and loofe as he liftedfo great a Ne cromancer do s they feign Jamjheat to have been. According to the courfe of their Stories he lived about an hundred years after Keyomarraz. whom fome imagine to be that Kidor* Laomer( IGfter in the Hebrew, fo called from the Kidaris or Royal Cap he wore ) van- quifhed by the Patriarch Abraham. But having occafion in fev^ral places to remember this Jamjheat, here I lhall fay no more. Upon the King's left fide are placed a ftand of pikes :• oppofite to which in a little lower ftation is placed a Man who by his pofture and garb appears to be in a diftreffed condition v for albeit he be in the prefence of the King, he feems neverthelefs to expo- ftulate with fome principal Officers ^ and either from guilt or elfe upon view of that deformed monfter to be in fome kind of aftoniihment fo well as the Sculptor's genius and hand could humour it. Below the guard are twenty Flamens placed •, fome of which with their hands point upwards towards the King, others towards the Sun, and the reft downwards towards the Temple of Anaya. Two ranks of other Flamens, fifteen in each rank are placed on each fide the Altar-, who by their mimmick geftures and elevation and conjundion of hands exprefs their Epnicia by this mode and manner of rejoycing-, unlefs it were an antique form of worfiiip which probably they then ufed unto their Pa- gods. Some of thefe have their faces towards the King, who alfo had his fhare of ad oration *, but others turn their backs glancing fide-ways upon the Pagod, whom in this dance they half environ. Lower are figured eighteen or twenty Lions in a row, every couple looking towards one another. In the lowermoft place oppofite under the Altar is a door, or rather mouth of a Cave, which gives entrance into the Chappel that is fupported by pillars. Mr. Skinner ( who travelled thofe parts more lately)allures me it is yet open and remaining in the fame condition I have defcribed. Near thefe are the remains of a large Sepulchre or Coffin of ftone, prefumed to be the dormitory of fome remarkable though unknown Perfon : for both the Villagers there abouts are filent in if, and 'tis the lefs inquirable, feeing that it was the cuftom of the Monarchs of Perfia to have their Corps let down into deep holes or pits purpofely bored within the fides of Mountains; as this day appear abundantly by the lignals upon the Hills about Perfepofay where the Bodies of the greateft number of thofe that preceded Alexander the Great were interred, as I fhall hereafter note. About a bow-fhoot hence to the Southward upon the Plain or lower ground is a high Column inperfedion; but of what ufe at fuch a diftance I apprehend not. To concludefor Jn magnis voluijfe fat eft, This is the fum of what I have to fay re lating to this unparallel'd Antiquity and (when in perfedion) incomparable Strudure, which has fo far the precedency, that Don Garcias de Sylva Figuroa ( Ambaflador A. D* 1619. to Shaw Abbas from Philip the Third of Spain) upon his view, not onely prefers it before all he faw at Rome, but concludes That it is undoubtedly the only Monument in the World at this day extant without impofture; yea, far exceeding (faith he) all other Miracles of the Earth we can either fee or hear of at this day. Give me leave there fore to add. That here ( where I may fay Materiam fuperabat Opus,the Materials are rich but much more eftimable the Workmanfhip ) Nature and Art feem to confpire towards the creating amazement and pleafure both in Senfe and Intelled •, the prefent ruines re taining fuch a majefty as not only exprefs the Founder's magnificence, but in the behold ing ftrike a fenfible impreffion (if not of veneration yet) of admiration *, in fuch efpe- cially as have a due efteem of Silver-hair'd Antiquity. Is it not therefore great pity that fome llluftrious Prince or other Noble Perfon valuing rarities^ has not e're this fent fome Painter or other like Artift to take a full and perfed draught of this fo an cient Monument? the rather, feeing that the Inhabitants of Shyraz, but principally the Villagers at Mardajh and other People thereabouts put no value upon it; but contrarily (finding that albeit fometimes they gain, yet moft times they lofe by free-quarter of Soldats and others who out of meer curiofity repair thither,) in barbarous manner fpare not to deface and tear afiinder what they can in fpight, and under pretence of ferving their common occafions *, albeit by the Dukes of -SW^they have at fundry times been puniihed for it j in fb much as thefe rude Rufticks have barbarian-like done it moreTerfepolis.

Neverthelefs, I may here with thankfulnefs acknowledge,how that upon my propo- fing it fome years fmce unto that great Mecanas of antiquity the late noble Lord Thomas Earl of Arundel, He was fo fenfible thereof, as to that end he dilpached a Youth thither whom Mr. Nor gate recommended to his Lordihip for one he knew could both defign and copy well; But I hear he died by the way at or near Surat, before he could reach ferfia \ fo as that worthy endeavour became fruftrate. To proceed. Little more than a mile hence is Mardajh, which in a Spanish reporter I find writ Mar gate an, and in an Italian Mehrchoafcon, very much differing from the right pronun ciation. 'Tis a Village confiding of near two hundred Houfes, fuch as they be •, the People of which place were fo tranfcendently fuperftitious, that (uponnotice we were Chriftians and not Mujftdmen according to their Alcoran) what ground we trod or what places we entred, at our departure they fifted alhes and duft, apprehending we had pol luted the earth by reafon of our profeffion*, which being done in our fight made ug fome paftime. This and the Neighbouring Villages for that they are watered by Aquaduds forced from the River Kur or El-Chyr(ovQr which upon the Bindemyr, a Bridge fo called, we rode in the way from Shyraz. to PerfepolisJ feem very delightful places, the Gardens and Fields by that refreihment appearing at moft feafons extraordinary pleafant and fruitful in variety of Flowers and Fruits and Corn. Neverthelefs by thofe fluces (the mode of thofe parts) the main Channel is fo ftraitned, that in feveral places 'tis very hardly difcernable. Northwards about three JEngiiftj miles from Chyl-manor at the foot of that Mountain which verges towards Perfepolis, in like fculpture is carved the figure of a Giant which the Perfians fay is the reprefentation of Ruftan: which may the better be credited feeing that in his memory the place is called Nogdi, or as fome pronounce Nufci-Rnftan, i. e. Ruflans Monument. This Kuftan was a Heroe celebrated in the old Annals of Perfta which thefe modern times preferve but by tradition: fo that uncertain it is what age he lived ini but as I gathered afterwards at when I went to fee his Tomb, was in or about the reign of that great Artaxerxes or Ahaftiuerm who took to Wife Hefter the Jew, in whole Wars 'tis likely he was fome Eminent Commander ; concerning whofe ftrength and ads, Romance-like they report wonders. Nigh this upon the fame Hill the Images of feveral Women and Maidens are carved , one of which they fay is the , figure of Ruftarfs Earthly goddefsof whofe Amours and adventures which like a Knight Errant he performed for her fake, the Perfians tell many pleafant ftories: As alfo, how by the corrivallhip of Sha~gad his falfe friend, Ruftan was deftroy'd by falling into a pit covered with boughs and Earth ^ whence neverthelefs with a dart he flew his adverfary, fuch time as he look'd down into the pit to infult over Ruftan by way of triumph. Nor far thence (where the Mountain in like manner is made fmooth and even) are two other large figures of Giants on horfeback. The one has the. Royal Tiara upon his head with long crifped hair dangling under it *, and upon his ihoulders that royal Veft which the Sovereign Princes wear, as elfewhere defcribed: In his left hand is a Club with Iron fpikes at the end, non unlike that which Painters ufually give to Hercules. Op- pofiteto this is the other Chevalier, who wears a like Veil upon his Body, with hair upon his head of equal length, but bare-headed. The horfes in theirpoftures face each other, as do the Riders; who with their right hands ftretched on high lay hold upon a round ring, feeming to contend about if, and either to force it from each other, or break it afunder. This probably is a fymbol or embleme of that great Empire *, and re- prefents to all Generations that great conteft for the Monarchy of the World, which happened betwixt Darim and Alexander, or other wife that 'twixt Cyrm and Artaxerxes. in another place upon the precipice of the Hill is the effigies of another Gigantine perfon, little different in habit*, and mounted upon a like Bucephalus. Within his right hand he holds a Sword not fo hooked as the Damafcoy nor fo clofe-guarded as ours*, and with his left out-ftretched he grafps a Foot-man that feems to oppofe him ; back by another Camerade bare-headed, who by this conqupft over his Fellow, in fubmifs manner by the bowing of his body feems to beg the Horfe-man's mercy. There are fe- veral other Images carved in that Mountain, which are lafting Monuments, and very well worth a Travellers notice: but thefe I lately named are the principal.

At Hamadan alfo the like* and in fome other parts of Perfia, which being engraven upon the folid ftone, at fo great height, and not upon the declivity, but hollow'd within the precipice of thofe Mountains, endures the violence of wind and weather, and 'tis likely to continue as it is, while the Rock it felf lafteth. But to return. Upon either fide of this Mountain near Chilmanor, efpecially that which refpeds the South, the Rock is cut fmooth ; and upwards above a hundred foot high in it are cut or pierced feveral holes, fome being of larger lize than other: the leaft is three foot fquare : Alfo in the fide of the Hill fome perfpedives are engraven,or at leall defigned. Now feeing that Diod. Siculm and other Writers of thofe times acquaint us, That when the Perfian Kings had the Sovereign command of the World, their Sepulchers or Burial- places were not in Cemeteries where Graves were ufually made; but in deep holes pur- pofely digged within the Rock or Marble Mountains about Perfepolis', whereinto the Corps ( after they were embalmed ) were let down by long cords or other engines fitted for that purpofe: So as for the performing that laft office, there was no afcending with out a ladder, which was onely reared upon fuch folemn occafions. For proof whereof, that Story of Darius Hyftafris mentioned by Ctefias in his Hiftory of Perfia is pertinent and remarkable •, which King having in his life time prepared in the Hill joyning Per. fepolts his own Sepulchre, was very defirous to be let down to fee the place where his Body fhould be laid i but the Magi dilfwaded him, as being ominous: neverthelefs the King's Parents ( no lefs curious of the fight) were by the Priefts let down with ropes, but in the defcent fo terrified with hideous apparitions, that letting go their hold they were killed by the fall, for which difafter 40 of the Priefts by the King's fevere decree were put to death. The (^Egyptians of old had the like Sepulchres in deep Caves or Vaults thirty foot under ground, curioufly cut into the folid Rock, and at the bottom parted into feveral Chambers, where the embalmed Corps were laid *, as by the Mummies fre quently found there is apparent. In Thebes alfo ( which Strabo calls Diofbolis) i. e. Jew ctvttas (not that near Joppa) are like Graves, wherein are interred above 40 of the gyptian Dynafts and Kings, which there have their Sepulchres; for to bury the Dead was accounted impious, but being imbalmed they laid them in fome private room within then houfe, faith Pomponius. Albeit it is not to be doubted how 7 that this cuitom conti nued not many Ages, nor was pradifed amongft all forts of People: but during the ^ ni ? Ces g^ped the Scepter of the Univerfe, and with thofe onely that were or higheit Quality: For, whenthe Greeks fubverted this Monarchy, this mode was left, andand other Antiquities. and that Pecy le conformed to the Greeks cuftoms; as appears by that ftately Funeral Eyhe- Jiion had,ana alfo that other o£ Alexander himfelf *, where the Corps were neither interred in thefe deep holes,nor burnt with fire ■, but embalmed,coffined,and kept after the manner of the Egyptians. Nor doth it appear what manner of Funeral 5^^ the Wife of xander and Daughter of the laft Barms had whether according to the manner of the Macedonians or Per fans : For albeit Juflin, Diodorus Siculus, Quint us Curtius, and v£lian make mention of her Burial, and of the Burial of Darius, yet in what manner, or in what place they were interred, (albeit neither pomp nor coft was fpared, nor the pre- fence of the Conquer our himfelf wanting for the greater honour of the Obfequy) thole Hiftorians are altogether filent. Befides thefe upon the fame Mountains fome pieces of Perfpedive are elaborately and regularly cut, refembling the nobleft fort of ancient ftrudure. The loweft door or place of entrance is open, and as if it were to be afcended by fteps: on either fide the door are placed flat pilafters which fuftain the Architrave and other fuperftrudure. Towards the fummit are other doors fhut and the whole imbelliftied with a few pour- traits of Men, which ferve for ornament, fomething conform to that Templum Solis which long after by Aurelian the Emperour was ereded upon Mount Quirinal in Rome y as expreiled by Laurus. Upon the culmen has been a which the Inhabitans there abouts fay was Jamjheat or Shem-yhid he that fucceeded Ouchang, and he Syamec the Son' of Keyomarraz. who ruled Ferfia circa A.

About three hundred paces Southward from Chilmamr there is a fingle Column, entire from bafe to capital-, but being fo low and without company, it is not eafie to conje- dure of what ufe it was. The pedeftals of two other Columns fquare in form are feen at no great diftance thence, but uncertain what fort of Column they bore, feeing there is an empty hole in one of them, which fome think ferved as an Urn to keep the allies of fome dead Bodies that were burned. Some Ipace from the Mountain towards the Valley, are feveral Coffins or troughs of ftone ■, fome whole, but molt broken: in which one may prefume dead Corpfes have been laid. There are moreo ver the reliques of fome Tanks or Confervatories of water, towards which one may difcern the Aquedud or water-paffage was cut through from the top of the Mountain: fo as by a pipe what rain-water fell at any time from the clouds was convey'd down into the^Cifterns. And with good reafon ^ for albeit the City Per- fyolis had the benefit of the River lately mentioned, yet the Building expatiated molt towards the North-eaft, which was towards the Palace. Certain it is, fo great a di ftance needed thefe helps ( wanting Springs) the better to feed their places of pleafure, as Orchards, Gardens, Grots,^.which the City had plenty of,andthofe very large ones. The onely ruin that remains of building in that part the City ftood, is a Ipacious fquare, which had but one door for entrance. The walls are high and lafting •, for they aj;e of extraordinary large pieces of Marble- And albeit the cement of theft that joyns the ftones is vifible •, yet of what fubftance the lingle column is, 1 lately mentioned, I fomewhat doubt, feeing 'tis fo high and differing from the colour of that quarry, and by the Curiofity of the cement feeming as if it were one piece of ftone: fo that the little time I ft aid there would not fuffer me to fatisfie my felf whether it was natural or arti ficial. Howbeit fince upon fecond thoughts I fuppofe it may be fuch plaifter as in old time was made of flower with whites of eggs and the beft fort of ftone beaten into pow der, with which the outfides of fome fofter materials was ufually finiihed or pargetted: And of fuch a compofition was that Pifcina mirabilis near Cuma-, which for colour and durablenefs even in thofe times gained admiration. To proceed now in our Travel. The eight and twentieth day of March we put foot in ftirrop, and that night rode four and twenty miles to a Town called Moy-own. In the mid-way 'twixt thofe 2 Towns I obferved a Hill, upon whofe top (as the ruins fhewed) hath ftood a Caftle fo advantagi- oufly fcituated by Nature, as we judged was impregnable. A late rebellious man ned it againft Abbas his Sovereign, who (to terrifie others) came in perfon to reduce it. But fuch was the Sultan's refolution, fuch the height where the Caftle ftood, fo narrow the entrance, and fo defperately defended,that in fix months fiege he had but little hopes of taking it. Loth he was to draw off -, and what ftratagem to ufe could not fuddenly devife : At length he goes.this way to work v a reward was promifed to any would effed it.

Abhas acknowledges the Enchanter merited his price: But while the Wizard dotes upon his gold, he fees not that danger was at, hand *, for the Kin* grudging the lofs, and knowing no better way to recover it but for being a Witch feuds him to Satan without his head; making that the oCcafion of his juftice, which but a little before he held ufeful, though then difliked it. To return. Moyown ( a Town of note upon the road betwixt Shyraz, and Spahawn) is very delight fully ieated •, enriched alfo with fweet Water, excellent Wine, plenty of Wood, Itore of Grafs, and diaper'd with Nature's Carpets. - It belongs to their highly honoured Prophet Rmaely whofe Tomb in a well-built Machit called Emoom I^mad is herefeenj conliderably endow'd through the liberality of many Princes and Great Men: For to wards its maintenance yearly twelve thoufand mawnd-jhaw of Rice, and four thoufaud of Barley is allowed. Next night we lodged ( flept 1 cannot fay, we were fo vexed with Mefjiuto's) in O-jone, a Village coniifting of thirty Familiesmoil of them Prophets or Prophets Children. We ftill found leaft profit, where fuch Prophets dwelt, feeing they drunk no Wine, nor were Grapes allow'd to grow amongft them: Not that Wine there is held bad, but from fome Tradition, and probably that it is the Blood of thofe Giants who warred againft the Heathen Deities. Nor was the Water in their Tancks fo wholefom as might merit commendation*, albeit the Confervatory was as good as any we faw till then:, being large, and plaiftered with a compolition of lime,and fand with fome glutinous matter (as 1 apprehended) which made it both large and fmooth j fo that it feemed to be no other than natural ftone, and 'better than what we call Plaifier of Paris, Such were the Gifterns. or Tancks in old Rome as Pliny tells us: and of like Art were thofe flender Marble Columns our fore-fathers have feen call or made for Cathe : drals llrudures*, reckon'd inter res pertHtas hj Pancirollm. Next day we rode over fome craggy and fteep Hills, and at night made Tartang our Marine el: A fmall Town molt remarkable in a Mefchit, wherein we beheld a Monument or Tomb which was raifed a pretty heigh: from the ground, and cover'd with violet coloured Velvet - , under wliichlies buried a Great-Uncle of the Kings. Next night we came to JJfe* pfl/f, a place obfervable onely in an old Callle, which was fometimes a Garrifon: in and about which inhabit ( as we were told ) no fewer, than forty thoufand Georgians and Sarcafhes, who by profeflion are Chriftians'-, albeit little better than captives^ being for cibly tranfplanted hither. They are a People have Saint George the Cappadocian Bifhop in veneration, being their Patron. From Mahometans they difrer(not in habit nor mode, but) in their gray eyes, a great argument of heat, fayes •jirifiotle, as black is of the contrary, the colour of moft Perfians, and have long white hair which after the mode * of thofe antick Gallants recorded by Pliny and Lucian they wear tiffued with fillets of iilk and gold or fdver. if any of thefe (which, is too too often) turn Mahometan-, they are itfofatto preferred beyond vulgar merit. Poor Souls! hearing that we were Chrifliam, they not onely flocked about us, but wept to fee us: Nor wanted we bowels of com panion to behold Chriflian in fuch a miferable thraldom and condition, and under fuch temptations. Nor far diftant hence is Thymar *, memorable (if By^ar err not) in an an cient monument,by fome Hebrew Charaders fuppofed to be the Burial-place of Bathjhek the Mother of King Solomon: which probably may be miftaken for Bethfhemejh,whicn lig- nifies a Houfe dedicated to the Sun: Howbeit 'tis calkd Mechit-Zukimen, i. e. Solomon\ Chappel, a place (if truly fo) well worthy feeing. Next night we lay in Whomgejh *, next in Ci4z.cuz.ar, next we came to Ba^eba-chowiZnd next to Degardow: Eight leagues from which place (and near Tez.dycawjwe rode over a moun tain of black Marble, (where doubtlefs are quarries of Serpentine and Porphyre,if the earth were examined: ) the defcent was precipitious; fo that lave by ragged Iteps, and thofe not a little dangerous, was no riding down. Out of this part of the moun tains the River Rhogomana fprings-, which having watered runs into the Perfian Gulph. Howbeit, down we got, and that night rode to Gmihawllello ; a Village fa mous for a Cdrravans-raW) and for the belt Wheat-bread in Perfia. Next night we came to Tezdecawz., a Town which ftands pleafantly in a narrow Vally, the ground on each lide declining gently, fo as no Hill appears near it, the countrey round about for fotne miles being even and Champain: It is hardly to be feen or found till very near the place, did not a Caftle point it out which was built by Tezdgyrd a Per (tan King above the Town long fince, as this Name partly intimates.

At this place Perfia is bound' ed towards the North*, for here Ayrac or Parthia takes beginning. Chiraef, Gordon achowy Nowhtngan, Kawrony Phtrujhabad, Eflache, Nahandioen-, are Towns in Farfift#' which in this courfe I can but name: Yet that you may the better go along, and for thar the lateft Maps of Perfia are erroneous, both in Rivers, fcituation of places, and tru names of Towns (for to fpeak truth, none that 1 have feen, either thofe fet forth l/ Hondm Ortelm or Mercator who writ by one Copy, have five right names,) i therefore inferred this of the Perfian Empire : in which, I prefume, neither the pofition of places are much miitaken, nor the names of Towns in the leait fiditious. The next day we got to Moyeor •, a. confiderable Town, for it confifted of about a thoufand Houfes: And albeit their Houfes were neat, yet were they in no wife comm rable to their Dove-houfes for curious outfides. This reafon they give, fonie of them (as Tradition perfuades at leail) are defcended (not a Colmiha Noe, but) from thofe who being taught to feed at Mahomet's^, not a little advanced his reputation ner- fwadingthereby the fimple People they communicated to him intelligence from fome An gel. Yet I rather think 'tis in memory of Semiramisy who (as Berofits relates) was in her infancy nourilhed, and at her death transformed into a Dove^ for which caufc the Syrians and-other Oriental Nations (the Jews excepted ) to this day have that bird in more than ordinary eiteem amongft them. The Heathens alfo (believing that their gbd defs Venus was hatcht, by a Dove which fat on an Egg that fell from Heaven intoW yhratesy and by IFiihes rblled on Land,as Jul. Higinus hath it in his Fables) have it in equal eflimacibn. Next night we were brought to Spahawnet by a Servant of Meloyember the King's Fifcal j who intreated the AmbaiTadour to repofe' a day or two there tiU su hawn could fit it felf for their more folemn Reception. Where in this interim we mav remember, That moil of thofe Manzeels we have pait from Chehelmimr to this place are 'twixt twenty and thirty miles afunder. The whole diftance is fomewhat above 200' Engltjh miles, as I computed. The tenth of April we left Spahawnet a Village fix miles South from Spahawn' when we had gone afarfang further, we were invited to a Collation prepared in one of the King s Gardens that was by the high-way, whither the Englifh Agent and fuch other Enro-paan Merchants as were Refidentiaties in Spahawn came to exprefs their civilities unto the Amballadour.

Yea, Seneca a Heathen hath this excellent faying, Si fcirem homines ignoraturos &amp; deos ignofcitw res, non yeccarem tamen propter peccati vilitatem: If I knew that Men could not lee, nor the' gods punifh, yet would I forbear finning for the loathfomenefs of Sin. Plato hath the like, That he would do nothing in fecret whereof he fhouid be aihamed in publick.

But to return: Amongft other our cates, I took moft notice of a rolled Pig ^ iii regard it was the firft we faw in Perfia) and is meat eqna\\y offkntive to Jew and Mahometan. The flagons and bowls in his Houfe were all of gold: Vials of fweet Water for perfume, and slaffes of Shyraz. Wine were emptied for our better entertainment. Thefe Georgians and Armenians are by fome called Jelphelyns, from a Suburb adjoyning this City *, but rather in memory of their Metropolis which bears that name near Ararat, called Ariamnes by Tortelim. The Georgians are the ancient Inhabitants of that Coun- trey, and have a little intermixture with other Nations. The foil is molt part moun tainous, much refembling Helvetia where the Switters live. From the tops ot fome Hills they can difcover (at leaft as they fuppofe) the Buxine and Cafpian Seas. They derive their name either from St. their Patron, or from the Gordiaan Hills on which they inhabited albeit the derive them from the word yww'* for that they are Husbandmen, but called Jberia formerly. And indeed the goodnefs of God is herein to be acknowledged, inasmuch as thefe Georgians with their Neighbours tbe Carcafr and other Armenians continue their Ghrijiian profeflion, albeit they are liifficiently threatned in that refped by T%rk, Tartar and Per [van who environ them, and tell them that all Natolia and thofe other Countreys that lie betwixt the Euxine and Mediterranean, albeit they were once altogether inhabited by Chrifiians, are now oVeripread with thofe that embrace the Alcoran.

The threefirft general Councils they have in great honour^ they ftudy the Latine Tongue very little (for it is rare in : ) Twelve titular Bifhops they name, three hundred fome fay •, very poor, which ought not to render them defpicable. The Old and New Te~ ftaments they have in their Mother-tongue; a Litany alfo, part of which is ever v y Lord's day read and expounded in the Church: They allow but of two Sacraments} ad- minifter the Lord's Supper in both kinds Bread and Wine; deny a real prefence: Ba- ptifm they celebrate after the Entychian fort, as Jacobm ( Father of the Jacobites ) and Joannes Philoponw, An.

Since Cozroes time, moft of thefe Eaftern Chrifiians follow the con demned opinion of Nefiorius ; a Herefie encouraged by Cozjroez. the Perjian-Apoflate in hatred to Heraclius the Emperour: For, by forcing it upon the Chrifiians who were his Subjeds, it fpread it felf like a leprofie or ill air wdl nigh over all the Orient.

Five Sabbaths every year they abftain from Mi fifli, cheefe and butter *, in memory of thofe five Ages wherein their Gentile fore fathers ufed to immolate their Children to the old red Dragon: Wednefdays and Fri days (except 'twixt Eafter and Afrenfion) they faftV and by what I have obferved, { fuppofe that no other Chrifiians are ftrider Lent-obfervers: For, they not onely refraia their Wives during that time, but abitain from flefli, fifh, milk, eggs and butter-, thofe forty days tceding upon oyl, bread, hony, dates, cucumbers, melons, herbs, and the like, and drink onely but at other times eat.fleih of all kinds; yea, can dif. penfe with Hogs flelh and acK)unt it a dainty. Flowbeit, before the three great FeftL vals they fall: twelve days. They marry oft-times at nine or twelve years of age; the Laity twice, Ecdefiafticks but once*, Trigamy to all v is hateful. The Presbytery are ho noured. Images in Churches they approve not of, condemning the therein *, but in their Houfes can endure the pidures of Fenw and Priapm. The Crols they regard, but worlhip not v nor do the / believe there is a Purgatory. Their Temples are but mean. Obedience and relped to the better and elder fort they pradife: theft and adultery they punilh. In fome things they are but refined Idolaters ; For, in Burials they have a cu- ftom to lead about the Church an unlpotted Lamb, which they divide and diftribute to each a bit; as a fymbol obliging one another to love and charity: Peradventure this cu- ftom is derived from that of the Hebrews, who ufed to divide a calf, as Mofes records in Gen. 15 .9. and as Jeremiah-, chap. 34. v. 18, 19. On Good-Friday they reprefent the Paffion and Burial of our Saviour, during which they exprefs forrow in their faces. On Eafter day they joyfully celebrate the kefiirredion by a reprefentative body, ufmg that morning ( as do the Greeks) the old Saho, He is rifen indeed: an Angelical note they call it. That day they celebrate as a great Feftival, the Mahometans nor Jews not daring (as not being permitted)to mingle among them: the King allows them that priviledge. They faft upon the Nativity.

Two thoufand three hundred yearsago itwas called Dura: But whether that which Polomy calls Dera, (not probable, feemg he pla ces it in Sufiana^rOt that Dara which was built by Arfaces the firit Parthian Emperour after his vidory over Seleuchm, as juflin records in his 41 Book, I know not: But pro bably this old name has mifled thofe that judge it to be Dura in that Province where the haughty Affyrim ereded his golden Colof Hecatompylos is the next name 1 find it had ; recorded by Apollodom, Polybim, Ptolomy and Pliny lib. 6. c. 8. fo denominated from her hundred Gates*, albeit the name be alfo given to Thebes, qu&lt;&amp; centum jacetobrutator^ tis: In Hyrcania alfo there was another of that name •, and one in Libya which was bunt by Hercules as Diod. Skulus mentions*, whereby we may imagine her in thole days a great City. And though in Alexanders conquefts Curtim name her not, it leems ine was then varied into that Greektjh denomination : For of this name goes a tradition, That Demetrius Nycamr ( Sotor's Son) thirfting after Syria and Jerufalem (upon mstrea cherous killing Antiochus Alexander's Son, to make the conqueft eafier) he was attronte by Tryphon Lieutenant of Syria and forced to fly to Arbaces the Perfian King for iuccour, who being acquainted with his unnatural defign, not onely deny'd him the Law or lio- fpitality but fent him prifoner to Hecatompylon, where he was held in fetters, till upon fubmiifion he was releafed, and by Arbaces re-feated in his own Dominion. After that this City was called which fignifiisth Half the world: hyperbole being given to Rome which fome call Epitomen Vniverfu) By Ben Jonas (here An. Heg. 540. of our Lord 1160.)

But 1 can y no means clofe with thofe who are confident that this Spawhawn was that old City w was called Hecatompylon. For albeit I deny not that fuch a place there was, (as . ^ our Gr^Hiftorians) and that placed in this Countrey •, neverthelefs by con:1 P ann ^ Yera iSpahantm, i i feveral latitudes, it may be concluded that Cazhyn or Coom was that Becatompylon which ftolomy places in the latitude of 37 degrees 50 minutes. And both Ptolomy, Pliny and Straho all agree, That Afpa (as without peradventure Spaham was then called) had no more Northern elevation than 36 degrees, and withal is placed in Parthia.

She is in compafs at this day about nine Englijh miles, including towards feventy thouiand Houfes, and of Souls (as may be conjedured) contains about two hundred thoufand : for, befides Natives there are Merchants of fun- dry Nations, as Emlifh, Dutch, Portuguez., Pole, Mufcovite, Indian, Arabian, Arme nian, Georgian, Turk., Jew, and others drawn thither by the magnetick power of gain. Y *tIt hath feveral good Buildings; but the moft obfervable are the My dm, Mefqms, Ham- mums and ?aUces- r as be the Gardens, Monuments and J elf hey z Suburb adjoyning. Spaham is moft pleafant in its fcituation, elegant as to Building, populous for Inha bitants rich in Trade, and noble by being the ufual refidence of the Court emi nent for all forts of Exercife, fufficiently watered by theSmdery, fruitful in its foil ;, and for air fo pure and quick, that I very well remember we found it much warmer in more Northern Cities which had greater latitude.

Howbeit,the Town is of no great ftrength, yet has a mud-wall about it; and towards the outfide of the City, alarge Caftle unflan- ker'd but moated about', and feveral Houfes within,which guard the Treafure,Arms and Ice there ftored. .

The Mydan is without doubt as fpacious,as pleafant and aromatick a Market as any k the llniverfe : It is a thoufand paces from North to South, and from Eaft to Weft above two hundred', refembling our Exchange, or the Place-Royal m Paris, but fix times lar ger : the Building is of Sun-dried brick •, and an uninterrupted Building ^ the inlide full of Shops, each Shop filled with wares of fundry forts ^ arched above (in Cupolo's) Tarras-wife framed at top, and with blew plaifter pargetted.

Within, the rooms (according to the common form there) are arched, enlightened by trellizes: the rooms imboffed above and painted with red, white, blew and gold *, the fides painted with fports and landskip ; the ground or floor fpread with carpets of filk and gold, without other furniture*, tarrafled above, garniflied with a Pharoe over-topping many Mofoms, and the Garden or Wildernefs behind the Houfe made fragrant with Flowers, filled with airy Citizens priviledged from hurt or affrights, and for which they return their thankful notes in a more melodious confort and variety than if they were in the exadeft Vollyere in the Univerfe. Within the Hippodrome many of the Ca valry ufe to ride, (according to the ancient cuftom, as Xenophon in the life of Cyrus in- ftances;) do Perftans at this day, daily repairing to the Court-gate, mounted, with lances in their hands, Shamlheers or Swords and Quivers by their fide *, where af ter they have praunced a while they depart,unlefs the King prepare to go abroad i for then they give their due attendance. The North Ifle of the Mydanhzxh eight or nine arched rooms, ufually hung with Lamps and Latten Candlefticks, which being lighted (as 'tis ufual, efpecially L at the Feftival of Lights which they call Cerajrhan) give a curious fplendor.

Gower~abaut{ another Suburb) takes its Name from the Govers that inhabit if 7 nick named from their Idolatry, being reliques of the ancient Perfians, fuch as at this day the Perfians be in India. The Perfians have them in fmall account ■, partly for that they are the o^iginary People of that Countrey partly for that by their induftry they fhame the perfians in their idlenefs. Thefe (if we may credit Tradition) differ from all other Gehtiles, in that they never built any Temple to the Sun, as moft Idolaters have done,i6S Spahawn. Their Marriages are fuch as I have related amongft the banifhed Terfees that live in India ^ but their Burials differ: For, in reverence to the Fire thefe not onely forbear to burn the Dead, fearing to offer it an unclean things but even hold it a crime to Ipit into the Fire, which yet they repute facred. Howbeit, in the Oriental parts of amongft the Erachmam, the Dead are expofed to the Fire*, albeit in the Occident it came firft in requeft by Sylla the Didator; who having abufed the dead Corps of Cam Mariw, fearing like fauce ordered that his dead Body fhould be burned; which was done, and after pradifed by the fucceeding Roman Princes. But whereas the Egyptians powder the Dead with Salt and Spices to preferve them from putrefadion, the Perfa in India expofe the Dead to the Sun's rage till he have eaten them. And thefe Cowers oft-tiines put them in the hollow of a Tree ftanding upright liipportcd by the bole, tillobferva- tion releafe them: For if the Vultur pick out his right eye firft, then they conclude that he is inParadife *, if the left, then a vexes him *, and they feaft or fait by that obfervation, as joy or forrow is occafioned. Contrary to the Perfan Satrap* who had their but give a pretty good reafon •, For (lay they) no place on Earth could be fufficiently capacious, feeing that Mmdm miverfus eft Templum Soils. Zertooft was their Law-giver, and no other than Zoroaftery whofe alhes (if the Greeks may be believed) were confumed by lightning, invocating Orion. Neverthelefs, fome think that he was Nimrod-. But more certain it is. He was that Zoroafter who firft taught the Terfians Magick and Judi cial Aflrology. Howbeit, fome there be that imagine Zertooffl was that the Gre cian Heroe who firft gave Per ft a the Name, and upon his Pegafits is faid to fetch that Fire from Heaven which they after idolized. Albeit the Mahometans apply tiie Name Gomr to Chriftiansf feeing it iignifieth an unbeliever. Thefe Cowers adore the Sun called Mythra, believing it to be a globe of fire, a reprefentator of a more powerful Deity: Their Flamens were a fort of Platonifts', for albeit they acknowledged many Creatures to be excellent, yet are they no way comparable to the Creator, who is (even as they ac count) the center of all perfedion. Pulcmm Caelum, fulcra Terra, fed pulcrior qui fecit ifia, &amp;c. Neverthelefs they have declined that, and at this day deifie an elemental Fire, which (like that of the Veftalsif Q oil Inhahitant (Persia-.Tawgebaut.

We entred Spahawn the tenth of April, and on May day departed thence towards the Court which was then at Ajharaffin Monendram^hout four hundred miles diftant North wards from Spahawn. Our firft nights journey was to Reegue ( or Keig) an hours riding from Spahawn. Thence-forward (by reafon of the incomparable heat) we were forced to travel in the night, all day refreihing our felves in the Carravans-raws *, good refting places when gnats forbad it not. From Reegue we travelled to Sardahan (called Sarraca by Ptolomy lib. 6. cap. 2-) fixteen Englijh miles thence *, and next night we made Whomg our Manzeil, being feven and twenty miles from Sardahan. Next we came to Tawgebaut, a Houfe and Garden of the Kings, which for beauty and fweetnefs is comparable to any other in Parthia •, and the more obfervable for that it is feated in a barren fandy foil. The hinging Rofe grows here ! the Violet And Parthian Myrtle in choice order fet! Hie Rofa purpureo crefcit rubicunda colore, 1 Et Viola: omne genus hie eft, &amp; Parthiea Myttus, And for five hundred paces every way gives a pleafant prolped of molt forts of Trees familiar to that climate as alfo of P erf an fruits and flowers,^. Pomgranates,Peaches, Apricocks, Plums, Apples, Pears, Cherries, Chefnuts, Damask, red and white Rofes, Tulips and others flowers in great variety 5 watered with ftreams&gt; beautified with arti ficial Grots, having alfo Hummums of ftone paved with white Marble: The Mohul or Summer-lodge brags alfo of a dozen Chambers which were delightful to the view, rich in imbofments of gold and paint of various colours, and proud in the Archited: fo as it will eafily be granted. That Architedure, Sculpture and Painting are in moft parts of the World now, and have been, and ever will be in efteem with Princes and People beft bred and mod ingenious. And all this coft is fafeguarded from fand and ftealth by a defenfive wall, fo high as hinders (fave in one rifing artificial hillock which is raifed in midft of the fix defcents ) the affrighting fight of a circumvolving Wildernefs. A Tra veller is not to imagine pleafure his objed for pain and mifery will entertain him oftneft: otherwife 1 could have lull'd my felf in this Paradife *, and, ( as Mioca the Ara bian vidor after a ferious view leaving CW/^Jfigh out this Farewel, Eheu Tawgebaugh! qua &amp; manta tm funt delicU ? But on we muft to try the difference. From Tawrebagh next night we came to Bawt, which was fix farfangs or eighteen Eng- lijh miles diftant •, nothing memorable, fave an old Caftle in the way, which by reaion of the darknefs of the night we could hardly difcover. From Bawt we got by break of day to Obigarmy: both thefe are the King's Houfes *, who ufing this road, has at every twelve miles end a Lodge betwixt Spahawn and the Cajpian Sea, wherein our Ambafla- dour had the honour to repofe and found reafonable good accommodation. And now the danger is paft, let me tell you, moft part of the laft night we croft over an inho- Z fpitable170 Sdh Defar fpitable landy Defart which was ten miles broad, and in length ( as they told us) little lefs than a hundred: where here and there we beheld the ground covered with a loof and flying fand, which by the fury of the Winter-weather is accumulated into fuch heam as upon any great wind the trad is loft, and paffengers (too oft) overwhelmed and It' fled by that impetuous Tyrant*, yea Camels, Horfes, Mules and other Beafts, thoueh ftrong, fwift and fteady in their going, yet fometimes are not able to fhift for them 1 felves but perifli without recovery: thofe rowling fands when agitated by the wind mov' and remove more like Sea than Land, and render the way very dreadful to paiTenser 6 Howbeit, which was fome amends, the drinefs of thefe parts caufed through the in' fluence of fome Conftellations, give lefs advantage to the Sun by exhalation to occaiio' winds, than in hotter places and near the Sea is obferved* Indeed, in this place ^ thought that curfe fulfilled which is mentioned in Deut. 28. 24. where the Lord by m fes threatens in ftead of rain to give them Ihowers of duft: For, albeit the King ( to do as much as may be for prevention of harm and prefervation of paffengers) has raifed ar every three miles end a wall or Caftle} yet by the unliable foundation, in March and September in defpight of their belt props it is piece-meal torn afunder, that little or no remains appear of their late ftanding. This our laft nights travel was thirty miles. Next night we rode one and twenty miles to Suffedaw, an old weather-beaten Carra vans-raw j well agreeing with the fcituation, being placed in an unfociable defart Our next nights lodging was at Syacow, ten farfangs or thirty Englifo miles ^ a place that- made amends for the lail ^ tnis being notable in her Carravans-raw which is built from the ground of good free-ftone, white and well-polilhed •, yea to the bell of my remem brance, unlefs at Tanghe-Dolon y this was the firlt building of that material I faw in eiehi- hundred miles riding •, moft of the building as we paft being of brick well hardned in the Sun, as is common in thefe hotter parts of Afia. A word of our laft nights iour ney. The moft part of the night we rode upon a paved cawfey broad enough for ten Horfes to go a breaft, built by extraordinary labour and expence over a part of a sreJt defart *, which is fo even as that it affords a large Horifon: Howbeit, being of bo^v loofe ground, upon the furface it is covered with white Salt in fome places a yard deen • a miferable pallage! for if either the wind drive; the loofe Salt abroad which is like S' or that by accident Horfe or Camel forfake the cawfey,the bogg is not ftrong enough tn uphold them, but fuffers them to fink paft ail recovery. This caufey has lome refem blance with thofe ancient Fu militares whofe foundations were laid with huge niles or ftakes pitched into a bogg, and faftned together with branches or withes of wood nn on which rubbi/h was |read, and gravel or ftones afterwards laid,to make the ground more firm andfolid That of Trajans was notable^ but a dreadful paflage this was- and the more to be feared becauft fome forlorn hopes of highway-men many times pTl' lage paifengers: God be blefled, we efcaped this,but not another which was little kfs formidablefor we had no fooner paffed the Salt defart but of neceffitv we wire con ftrained to climb over and about the Hills called Cartand* of old, fo high werp fh™ Sa^' nS '' ^ ^ the e:,fier afCentf0rmed 38 if 0lymfm had been From Syacw we rode next night two and twenty miles: moft part of the wav w.-k over another fait Defart, wherem (as we were told) thoufands have unhappily perrflied • and would yet run like hazard did not a like large and well-made cawfey torfthS' u xt e [ e r 6 P 11 , ,: old Ttrmmm in this place limiting from reaching fur' ther North: From whofe high tops look we back and memorize her that was one? for' midable to the Komm Emperors, and Miftrefsofthegreateft part of Ma.

Little is the difference at this day from what Strabo lib. 11 of old reports concerning them, Errant femper fine Lare vel Pemte (fie diBa quia penes no's nati funt) fine fixis fedihm, fine legihm, &amp;c. A People albeit now of no accompt amon^it the Ferfims, yet time was when called Varni, by their courage as well as numbers they obtained for Jrbaces their Countrey-man the Parthian Empire. But having elfewhere Ipokenof this fort of People, I fhall give you a brief account of our laft nights tra vel, which for the greateft part of the way was through the bottom of part of Taurus, level with the ground, though the top ordinarily moiitens it felf in the middle region. This is that ftrait ( and not Itraits in the plural, though the name be fuch) or narrow paflage which is fo much famouzed in Authors; by Pliny called Caffiia porta,who alfo terms it Ingens Nat'ura mvckculum a great miracle of Nature ^ Bertim^ Cajpiarum clauftra Strabo and Ptolomyy PyU Cajpia • and others Media, Zagria, Zarz.e&amp; \ JDiod. Siculm, Cajpu por ta ; Vrifcian, Cajpiadas tangmt porta* } &amp;c. and fome, and not improperly PyU Semiramida j albeit different from thofe we call Caucafia porta &amp; Iberia (which are near Derbent) and wherein doubtlefs Maginm is miftaken, in faying that the Cajpia porta are in Turqueflan which he places in Zagathay or Altai as now called. This narrow ftrait is not more than forty yards broad and eight miles long ^ but the Mountain on either fide is precipi- tious*, and fo high as it is much above what an arrow could reach at twice the fhooting, were it poffible to begin the fecond where the firft: ihot reachf, and is one of three no ted paffages through that great Mountain * which from Perfia and the South and Weitern parts lead to Armenia,Hyrcania and the Ca(pian Sea,and which doubtlefs gave this the denomination. Through this it was the fair Amazonian qwrq to Alexander \ for that mentioned in Pliny which Nero threatned the Parthians to pierce through was in Arme~ niay and formerly fpoken of. Now albeit fome have attributed this pafs to the Spirit of Semiramis, who to ex- prefs her power and to eternize her memory to pofterity, effeded wonders ^ For, In Jarceio Monte juxta Ecbathan, immortale fui mommentum reliqmt, pracipitia Montis &amp; con- valles anfiaHm &amp; loca concava ad planum deducens, magno fumptu iter reddidit, Diod. I. 5 . This certainly is rather the work of Nature, God's handmaid^ the height and hard- nefs of the Mountain rendring it an endeavour vainly to be attempted, if not impoC fible to be effeded by Man. Albeit the Perfians (merrily I thought till 1 perceived them difpleafed with my incredulity) affured me that it was done by Mortis Ally's Arm with the help of his Sulfikar, which fay the Perfian Chronicles was eighteen cubits long •, but by equal faith you are bound to believe Ally's Arm was proportionate: And not unlike that Fabl£ mentioned by Nub.Geogr. 1. parte c. 1.4. concerning the Mediterranean Sea,which at firfl being furrounded with Hills like the Ca/pian, the famous Hercules cut that Moun tain afunder with his fword, and made that Itrait we now call Gibralter, which gives the Water a large and free pafTage into the Atlantick^Ocezn, Now to confirm this for a truth they tell us, That being in purfuit of the Gowers, (fo then they called the Chriftians) uniheathing his Sulfichar, for the quicker execution it parted in two, (at leaft was double edg'd ) with which he fo hew'd his enemies on the right hand and on the left, that at fome blows he beheaded hundreds; which made the reft fly to pur- pofe: In the purfuit, the better to overtake his Enemies, he clove Rocks and Moun tains in twain, and then (as they fuppofe ) made this fmooth paifage: To which I have but this for anfwer, Hanc fabulam longi temp or is' mendacia finxit: For would they give that credit unto Pliny he deferves, they might know how that long before Ally's birth, Ipeaking of this paflage, he fays, Ruptura eft Montis longitudine otto mill, pajf anguftiffi- ma, &amp;c. A defcription rightly agreeing with what we found it; and Strabo faith. This ftrait was made by a terrible Earth-quake that rent afunder feveral great Mountains, and this amongft the reft Terra-motibw (fays he) rupta fuerat Terra apud Cafpias port as, com- plurefq', Vrbes &amp; pagi, &amp; varia mutationes fluvionm. See. But of more certainty is what a Perfian then in our company toldhow that a dozen years fince, a valiant Thief with five hundred Horfe and three hundred Mufquets defended this narrow road againft all paffengers •, none pafling nor re-paffing without fome acknow- ledgement,albeit the King of (whofe Dominion lay amongft the Mountains) frowned at his fawcinefs, and threatned him : but fuch ftorms rather made good mu- fick to the Thiefs ears. Howbeit, Abbas alfo upon affront grows cholerick to be fo Z 2 beardedHahary. Terifcow. bearded yet fcorns to honour his overthrow by an Army&gt; well knowing he had many Chevaliers about him, by whole courage he little doubted to reduce him: but fuch was thefamethat went of this Thiefs fortitude, that by their demur Jhhas apprehends their fear and for anger grows pale at it. Keverthelels, e're he could give his rage a vent, an Armenian undertakes the work', whom the King embraces: and having breathed frefh courage into the hardy Chriftian, being excellently mounted as a Paflenger he fingles ' out the Thief who doubted not to mailer fo fair a beaft with fmall oppofal. Such con fidence had he in his valour, that it was his cuftome to give fair play b ufually commands ins his Company to look on at a diftance, albeit more than one entred the ilrait: So that in fhort fpaee this pair met, and engaged each other with Sword and Buckler*, the Armenian followed his blows with fuch dexterity, that after fome bloodfhed, upon a clofe he gave Death a free paflage: A Vidory nobly attained ; yet fo irkfome to his men (whofe lives depended upon his fafety) that like robbed Bears they fell upon the Vidor •, who doubtlefs had then and there expired, had not fome Coofel-bafhaws that were fpedators relieved him by whofe fudden falling on, the Thieves were quickly &amp;- crificed unto their Mailer. The Chriftian thus returning to Court Crowned with Law- rel. Abbas adds to his luftre and gives him a Command, fo unfupportable to the weak foul of this Champion, that further to cajole the King he denies his Faith, and turns In fidel, though abundance of tears were fhed by his Countrymen as diffwafives from it. But fee the end of his Apoftafie: The King albeit he had caufe to favour him by reafon of his good fuccefs againil the Tartars ', yet Jealoufie (or rather Divine Vengeance) fo Hung old Abbai) that without any known occaiion, or acquainting any man with his rea fon, he commands Lollabeg to cut off his Head fuch time as he was linging a Lullaby to his good fortune. Our next nights Manzeil was at Halvary, (eighteen miles from Ghezz,,) a Village pretty well built, and delightfully feated, and where the Earth was mellowed by a fweet Rivolet that purls from the tops of Taurus ; alfo the ground was moll part of the year ap parelled in green, requiting the painful Husbandman with a due acknowledgement of Olives, Walnuts, Wheat, Wood, and other things,. Bidding an unwilling farewel to that pleafant place, the next night we rode twenty miles, to Perifcow, i. e. a broken or divided Mountain; and by the pofition thereof may probably be the iffue of that which Ttolomy calls Arfitis. The Town is fometimes honoured with the King's refidence: not that the beauty of this Houfe (which is but ordinary) allures him, but for that there is choice hawking, Phefants and other game more abounding there than in moll other parts ofParthia. The Pole is here elevated fix and thirty degrees. The Town isrefrelhed with very fweet water: thefcituation is uponthe brow of a high well wooded but (a- greeable to its name) divided hill, having on each fide a Ileep accefs j whofe top has been crowned with a l^yrge Caftle, which now by age or war (the canker-worms of all temporaries) is moth-eaten 5 her ribs only appearyexpreffing defolation. One Mahu- med then commanded the Town •, and albeit trulled with the Sword and Scale, I fe&amp;r. he was Aftrea's corrupted Servant: No marvel then if in a difcontented humour fhe left the Earth *, for we can witnefs, that in Perfia (efpecially in Perifcow) Jullice was corruptly ballanced. At our entrance into the Town, (to extort a bribe from our Embafladour) he hanged one Per fan, (at leall we were fo made to believe,) cut off another s Nofe, and mutilated a third, to (hew that his Laws (like Draco's) were writ in blood : Viftera im- pornm fant crudelia, their delinquency was for the felonious Healing a trifle of two Ihil- lings value from a Footman ferving the Englijh Agent. Another was ready to be truifed up-, but fecret notice was given our Ambafladour, thatif hepleafed tobeg his Life, up on prefenting the Governour with fomething, it Ihould be granted him : This was the main defign *, and though well enough feen, our Ambafladour very gladly ranfomed him. Complaint was alfo then made againll a Farmer for thraihing a Whore againil her will: The Perfian Rhadamanth 'twixt jeail and earneil bids geld him and hang his Stones at her Ears as two Pendants, fuch as to him the Gulph of Perfia afforded none fo precious- The poor wretch humbly befought him to fpare his ufeful parts, the like did his aftonilhed Wife; fo as after mediation of Friends, and thirty pound Fine, upon promife to grind in his own Mill ever after the execution of the fentence was remitted. But each Man cried out, A fevere Cenfor is this Daragmd* Who never read, as 1 fuppoie, how that Nemo ]nre Natura cum detrimento all mm locupletior fieri debet, or (which might be his - own Lelfon) that Avarus omnihm eji malm, fed jibimet pejfimm.

I if tie more than a hundred miles diftant from us. Our firft nights iournev fmm p r to Cheer was four and twenty long miles, and tedious in the pfiTagi; forfomeparTwTs over rugged hills other part through whiltling dales i in both which we were fo wea ther-beaten with a ftorm of Wind and Hail bred and forced oveT the cIS Sea, (which from hence, if the feafon had permitted, we mighthave feen,) asfor fome time not only took away our fight and hearing, but threatned our brains; for in de- fpigk of our belt skill to keep together, we loft one another ; infomuchas we had hard ly recovered our company, had not the unmelodious noife of the braying Mules, and jinghngof the Camels Bells (being to wind-wafd) brought us together, and helped us SMrfrfHenH? rr 0r Z'%''&gt;»Straits-, through which, when neither Sun, Moon, nor Star befriends,.whofoever hereafter travel, let them be fure to borrow Thefew his thread or be content to wander rnfome kind of Labyrinth. From we rode next night four and twenty miles, to a Imall Village whofe name I have forgot •, but remember verv well thatthe Frogs (the Bu 1-bulls or philomels of this marifh place) aflembled in fuch num bers, and chirped fuch loathfome tunes, that we wilhed Homer would have given them a- nother King: For as one writes, 5 UIcm The prat ling Frog (thinking his Language good) Croaks fruitfully in his beloved Mud/ Gaitula liraofis Rana coaxat aquis Thefe mthe Sprmgmgender of theflimethatfroaths from their own bodies, and in lhallow plafhes croak and ride one another outragioufly; but towards Winter refolve Svl !- u mat , t , er ' ' T !. s ? r r nge what lbme re I )0rt ' that if their Heart and Liver be pull d out, they will neverthelefs skip up and down: and no lefs certain it is that Frogs are of great vertue, if phyfically ufed i for there is no part of them but what is medici- naoie, it Aldrovandm in his report be rightly informed. To Aliavarr, one and twenty miles from the Town of Frogs, we rode next night: a ve- ryplealant place for earth, water, and wood: and where we found flore of Phefants; a Bird abounding in thefe Hyrcanian Towns, but near the River ?hafis in Memrellia Cemptying it felf into the Fuxin near Trepizond) originally breeding. And it is note-wor my, I hat this River Phafis in fome part of the Hiftory writ by Quints Curtim is miftaken lor 7 tgrts)tromPhaft,or Pafi-Tigris.No wonder then if Alexander at the firft fight of the Ca~ Jpian thought that Sea was the Fens of Meottis \ and that he was perfwaded from the River Indus he might fail into the without interruption, Strabo 1 15 geogr.

Jafon and his Argonauts firft made thefe known to Greece, when thence he forced their Sheep bearing Fleeces of Gold, or Gold-meriting Fleeces. Next night we got to Necaw, five and twenty miles from Alliavar 5 obfervable only in the Kings Houfe, and for that their common Manfionsand Churches differ not from ours of ordinary fort in England. Here (as in fome other parts of Hyrcania, it being Sum- mer tme) we were exceedingly peftered with Flies and Gnats whofe vexatious Stings made fome of us, when wearofe, look' as if we had the Meazles. And when we came near the Sea we were no lefs troubled with Snakes^ for if fo be we left the Road, and nd through the green paftures, then they would wind about our horfes legs with out other harm than affrighting, and ferving to -perfwade us into the common path a- g^in. This is not ft range, feeing that Pompey (after he had lubdued Tigranes the Ar~ meman) marching into this Countrey was conftrained to retreat, by reafon of the infi nite number of Snakes and Serpents that offended the Army, as Pint. Vita Pomp, writeth. AndJJharaff And Lilian lib. 5. Animalmm reports, That Alexander marching hence into India law a Serpent 70 cubits long, none fuch now in this Countrey ^ but that there are Serpents of like prodigious bignefs, Petrm Crinitm relates, That one of 50 cubits length was nou- riflit by Ottavm-C^ar at Rome. Strdo exceeds thefe, Dracones centum cubit or um mag. nitudinls in Ethiopia funt: In Ethiopia are Serpents a hundred cubits long *, Sed an vo- lantes vel reptantes, qmritur. Next night we got into JJharaff, a City upon the Mare Cajpmm, The Emperour of Perfia was here at this time, expeding the Ambafladour ^ unwilling to remove till he came; and (as we thought) reiting there fo long both that we might fee the extent of his Empire, and likewife have a profped of the better parts of Perfia. The Sultan of the Town attended with fifty Coofelbajhaes, met the Ambafladour three miles from the Court*, and having civilly brought us into Aftaraff, ufhered us to our lodging: I may fay Us, for the Ceremony was very much below the Quality of fo eminent a Perfon a? an AmbalTadour, ASH AR AFF (or Ahajhuraff^nd yet I dare not fay fo named from Ahafnerm) is di- ftant about two miles from the Cajpian Sea: feated in a low ground, many laltMariflies circumvolving her, and but meanly watered:, no other but a fmall Spring (Maxera in Ptolemy) ftreaming from the T aurtftan Mountains drills in two branches through it, the broader of which is not five yards over •, yet in former times a River of good breadth. But no wonder we croffed over fo few that we could call Rivers, feeing the People cut them into many fmall fluces, and divert the ftream to ferve their occafions *, fo that oft times the true Channel is not to be difcerned. This pradice is no new thing, no lefs ancient than Cyrm the Great •, who to retaliate the lofs of his Men which were drowned in palfing the River Gyndes (a branch of Euphrates in AJfyria, J divided it into above three hundred little Streams, fo as the main Channel became loft. This was principally in revenge for the lofs of his white Palfrey, a Beafl: which was of the Nijkan breed, the beft Media ( nay the World ) brought forth, as Sen. de ira lib. 3. c. 2 3. Howbeit, the ground here is reafonable fat, but incultivated ^ the greater part of her Inhabitants ploughing in Campo Martio, I judge two thoufand Families live in this Town •, and no doubt increafe daily, the King having but of late alFeded this place. His Palace is pretty large, and but newly finilhed^ albeit Farrahaut the Hyrcan Metropolis but five miles Weft thence is the place where the Seat Royal in that Countrey has been-kept for fome Generations. Abajfebaut alfo not above two mil^ thence furpaifes for a cu rious Summer^houfe, excelling all his other for profped. Painting, Hummum, Water works, and a Foreft which is ftored with game of feveral forts: fo as it attrads the King, who where ever he ftays long makes Cities of fmall Villages. The Buvj^ar here is but ordinary •, and the Machits not to be admired. The Palace is large ; and looks into very pleafant Gardens •, albeit the Building it felf be not very regular, but rather confufedly divides it felf into four Mohols or Banqueting-houfes, which be gorgeoufly painted. Were thefe united, they might better delight the eye, and caufe the Archited to be commended : But more of it at the Ambaifadour's Audi ence. Abajfebam fignifies Abbas his Garden: and though I find a Town mentioned in Ptolomy called Abafena in his time, I may not conclude it to be this, feeing he places that in Media. The Pole Artick is here elevated eight and thirty degrees feventeen minutes it is due North from Spaham, as we obferved in our ftar-light travel, (for in the Summer feafon the days are raging hot and not to be travelled in,) Arftwrns was ever right before us. From the Gulph as we travelled from Ormns to this place are a thoufand Englijh miles: from Spaham three hundred and fifty or thereabout, as we reckoned. Before I give you a brief furvey of Hyrcania, let me prefent a fhort narration of our The Am- Ambalfadour's Audience and Entertainment. After four days repofe, the King alligned baffadour hi m his day of audience. It was the five and twentieth of May, our Sabbath, and the has Ah- fag-endof their Ramadan or Lent; advantageous to the though I will not dience. fay it Ipared him the charge of an entertainment. Sir Dodmore Cotton our Ambaffadour had Sir Robert Sherley in his company, with my felf and feven or eight other En^lijh Gentlemen his- followers: Good reafon it was fome Sultan or other fhould convoy and fliew him the way, (the Court being a quarter of a mile diftant from our Houfe; ) but what ill office was done at Court, I am not able to divine i for a fmall Cavalcade it was, yet fo it happened that notice was given by a Courrier from Mahomet Ally-beg the Favou rite : So as to the Court his Lordftup got, very few of the Town having notice of his time of Audience; as appeared by thofe few that came out either to fee him pafs, or to view the manner of his reception', which without doubt was the produd of the Fa vourites 174.Jmbajfadorns Audience,Hjrcania. TneAmbafradour by ntckWtlliams his Interpreter^ the call him:ac- nna nted the King, That by his Matter's command he had undertaken a very great jour- ney to congratulate his fuccefs againft their common Enemy the 7&gt;b as alio to pro- mote Trade, and fee Sir Robert Shcrlcy v.nd.cate himfelf from ^-^//y-% h.s m. Durations and withal, to defire that a perpetual League of fnendlh.p might be conti. nued 'twixt the two powerful Monarchs of Great Britain and . The Tot-fhaHj'h raifing his Body,returned this anfwer; To thehdt, theTurkj were a ' mean People, compared with the generous Perfiom-, as appeared by feyeral Battels he had S ven them ample proof oft and that than the no People in the World were more m. confiderable. Nevefthelefs he wiihed unity amongftC^ytoPrinces,theO(f«»^ ground- ins his conqueft upon their difcord. Concerning Trade, the Kmg of Great Br,mm Ihould if he pleafed receive ten thoufand bales of filk at and for pay. ment would by way of exchange accept of fo many thoufand Engltp Clothes as Ihould be adequate in value; For, as he well knewthe filk was a greater quantity than he could . ufe in his own Dominions, fo were the Clothes to him', but he would hazard the vent ing them by his Merchants to ferve his Neighbours, fo as neither we nor he Ihould need to traffiaue or hold correipondency with furky. It would infinitely be to his fatisfa. dion to difappoint the Grand Seignior of that yearly Cuftom he was forced to when his Carravans go by the way of Jlejfo or Trefiund to the Geman, other European Merchants, fo as the Janifaries were maintained by thole Cultoms: What was this, but to fharpen his Enemies Sword to his deftrudion ? Concerning Sir Robert S her lev he had been long of his acquaintance, and expreffed as many confiderable fa vours towards him (though a ftranger and a Chriflian) as to any of his born Subjefts. That if NordiM had afperfed him unjuftly, he fhould have fatisfadion: It argued in deed, Nom-heg ^as guilty, in that he rather chofe to deftroy himfelf by the way^han adventure a purgation. In fome fort he prefaged my rigour ; for had he come, and been found faulty. By my head, ( an Oath of no fmall force ) he Ihould have been cut in as manv pieces as there are days in the Year, and burnt in the open Market with dogs- turds. Now touching a League of Frienfhip with the King your Mafter, I chearfully embrace it: and concerning your felf, you are truly welcome. And feeing you have done me that Honour none of my Predeceffors ever had before v for you are the firft AmbalTadour that ever came from Great Britain in that quality into my Countrey, you may deferfedly challenge the more refped. Yea, as I account your Mafter Chief of the worfliippers of Jefa fo do I of your felf in a fuperiour degree to any other Ambaf- fadour now prefent. „' . r j it This faid, the King fat down again. And whereas all Mahometans fizeda or KnocJc their heads againft the ground and kifs his garment ; in a friendly manner he pulled our Ambafladour near him, and feated him by his fide, fmiling that he could not fit crols- legg'd: and after Audience, in another Apartment calling for a bowl of Wine, there drunk his Mailer's health *, at which the AmbalFadour ftood up,and uncovered his headj which being noted by the PoufraHgh, the more to oblige he lifted up his Turbant: and after an hours entertainment, diimiffed him with much fatisfadion- It is a real truth, that Aures atq\ Oculi Regum fmt multi, lb we found (though not the occafion) that the King's good will became foon diverted: For, from that day till we arrived at CazJbyn (albeit no offence was given,) neither was the AmbafFadour cajola at Court, nor faw he the King, neither did any Sultan invite or vifit him: all which was imputed to the envy of Mahomet Ally-beg-, who by bribery was made our enemy *, one that for his faculty in diving into other Mens adions, and informing the Tot-jhaitgh witn his obfervations, made a Ihift to engrofs the Royal favour, infomuch as moft bufineis ot State palfed through this impure conveyance: fo that it came to this at length, whom he loves the King honours, fuch as he hates the King crulhes all to pieces. To have nis good opinion each great Man out-vies others *, infomuch that his annual comings in ^ &amp; modis was bruited to be fevenfeore thoufand pounds fterling. And well might be, lince Myter heg (the Overfeer of the King's Harams} has a hundred thoufand pounds year y) if it be true that fome there aifured me. . , Sors noftra humilior! Tamer-beg's Houfe at the North end of the Town entertaine twelve long dayes and nights, ( fo long the Court ftay'd after we got thither; ) w ers the Sun darted his outragious beams fo oblique upon us, as made us believe we relt n more heat when we were within the burning Zone, than we did in Ajharajf at ^t P fent: Nor did the Sun we thought more torment us in the day, than did thoie in - merable fwarms of Gnats, Musqueto's and like vermine in the night feafon. How e , comfort was, that if it were fo for any continuance, our ihort ftay there was 10^ ourHjrcania. Sha-Abbas fort of prevention And yet, though our fufferings were great in one fenfe, the extre- inity of the Pot-Jhagh s juftice, or rigour I may better call it, was more in another, as his miferable Subjeds felt it in a higher degree. 1 ftail give but a few inftances*, too many of fo brave a Prince, whofe Vertues ballance his infirmities And feeing they are the reports of fome I met there who had been long in Per fa I will withQCmiw lay, Plura fcribo qmm credo, nee emm ajfirmare atifits fam, &amp;c. A poor diftrelled wretch bellowing a long and tedious pilgrimage from to this place upon lome little bufinefs, e're he knew what the fuccefs would be, unhappily re- Ited his weary limbs upon a field-carpet; choofing to refrefhhimfelf rather upon the cool grafs than be tormented within the Town by the mercilefs vermine ^ poor Man! he fell a malo in pejus: for fnorting in a climaderick hour, at fuch time as the King fet forth to hunt, his pamper'd jade ftartling, the King examines not the caufe, but fent an eter nal arrow of fleep into the poor Man's heart ^ jeafting (as hhicrates did when he flew his fleepy Centinel) I did the Man no wrong •, I found him fleeping, and afieep 1 left him. Poor wretch! happy only in this, tsEnetf magni dextra cecidit! The Courtiers alfo (as the Negroes in Mmicongo, who when their Captain receives a hurt by war or acci dent fympathize by voluntary maiming themfelves in the like part)to applaud the fad, parafitically made him their common mark ^ killing him a hundred times over if fo many lives could have been forfeited. ThtLatin Poet juftly reproving fuch tragick ads could fay, Regia (crede mihi) res eft fnccurrere UJis. Mercy is the trueft Conqueror. This is not unlike the pradice of j4rtaxerxes\{\$2X£&lt;{t Anceftorwho riding to hunt the Lion, caufed/I&lt;/(?^^^ a noble Youth to be beheaded, for no other fault than darting a rowzed Lion that made at him before the King begun to throw, as Ctefia* relates. A punifhment far exceeding the offence undoubtedly. Nor like that other Artaxerxes who is no lefs famous for his mercy, by ordering the cutting off the Tiaras or Tar bams of feveral Men condemned to lofe their heads •, the Law by this his ingenious and Prince-iike conftrudion being fatisfied, Mercell. L 3 o. But hovv highly foever they extol their King, 1 prefer that noble Pagan before him, who had this excellent Maxim of Juvenal, Nulla unquam de morte hominis cunftatio longa eft ; Delay cannot be long where life's concern'd. A Soldat's Wife having fed too high, in a luftful bravado petitioned the King for na tural help, her Good-man proving impotent. A dangerous impudence! The King finds it to relied upon himfelf, ( old at that time and Mafter of four thoufand Concubines ) fo as he promifes her fpeedy juftice: calls his Phyficiam, and when was held too mean a remedy for her diftemper, they gave an Aflinego an Ofiat potion, which fo enraged the Beaft, as by force he bafely became her executioner. There are Mollijfma fandi tempra, which are not alwayes light upon: as appeared in a needy Souldier, who drawing up a catalogue of his good fervices, clofing it in want, and humbly entreating fome ftipend from bis god of War for fuch and fuch good Ser vices: Non bis peccamr , for, for hisfawcinefs he was drubb'd (with many baftinadoes on the foles of his feet) well-nigh to death; and (imitating Pyfo the judge in Seneca, lib. 1. cap. 16.) examines who it was that writ it? The Clerk makes his apologie : but the King fuffering Paffion to predominate over Reafon, that he ihould never write worfe, makes his hand to be cut off:, giving the poor wretch juft caufe to ingeminate Oh! quam vellem nefcirem liter as. Thus we fee the worft Tyranny is Law upon the Rack; Summum Jm fumma eft injuria. Two needy Knaves were arraigned in the Divan, and condemned for ftealing : ma ny grievous taunts the Pot-fliaw levelled^ faying. They deferved death for daring only to come fo near his Court fo ragged. They confefs they therefore ftole, that they might wrap themfelves in better cloathing. Abbas not fatisfied with their excufe, com mands two new Veils to be brought: but Winding-iheets had been more proper^ for the Executioner forthwith dragged them away, and upon two fticksftak'd them up on their Fundaments. An Execution pradifed of old in Perfia, as appears by that Decree of Cyrm mentioned in the 6. of Ezra, v, 11. Elevatum Corpus inftgatur fuper lignum, as the 70 render it. Such, and fuch other was his inhumame paftime during our ftay at the Cajpian Sea. But enough, or rather too much, upon fuch a Subjed *, efpecially relating to fo great and generous a Prince, as notwithftanding thefe miftakes is beloved as well as feared at home, and abroad rio lefs highly honoured: Therefore to record the variety of tortures here too much ufed by men-eating Hags of Hell, Canibal-hounds, Capigi and their death- A a twanging,Sha^ Abbas his Hjrcania, twanging Bow -ftrings, ripping up Mens Guts, and the likej what c6uld be the efferfb, but an odious and unnecellary remembrance ? Whofe Image do fuch as are cruel bear buthis,whofe true Title is, the Deftroyer? To take away Life is an eafie thing, notlb to reftore it. But, Soveraign Princes, by the duty of their place ufually protect their Subjeds from wrong, reprefs fadions, reward the good, puniihthe bad, preferve the publick peace, conferve the Law, and encourage Sciences and Arts, by which they gain immortal honour to themfelves *, yea, make their Dominions famous and wealthy: Thence it is the Poet fays, and that truly, Fallitur egregio qaifquis fttb principe credit Servitmm: nunquam libertas gratior extat Qukm fuh Rege pto. For by thefe few fad Inftances we fee that ftrait is the fingle Path that leads to Life, but to Death many Road-wayes appear. And Life, albeit Calarm the Brachman ar guing with Alexander-, maintained that nothing is more defpicable than Life, and made it good upon himfelf, therein being Felo de fe, believing the immortality of the Soul, which he fancied was Spirit mixt of Fire and Air, and that this fpiritual Eifence was but clogg'd with Clay, fo as he could with confidence aver, that Anguflm eft animm quern terrena delettant ; yet St. Augufiine has a contrary opinion ^ for he put that value up on Life as induced him to maintain that Mufca Soli praferenda eft, quia Sol caret vita, fed Mufca vitam hahet, A Fly is to be preferred before the Sun which hath no Life, as the Fly hath. And albeit nothing be more commendable in Princes than Juftice, for it is that which makes them Gods yet Clemency is of greateft exaltation by being moft honourable. Tally (though a Heathen) affirms as much in his Oration to Cafar for the Life of Ligarim , 'Thy Clemency (OCafar) is moft excellent, yea ' more honourable than thy other Vertues: Fortune hath made thee great, but Na- ' ture hath advanced thee higher, in thy inclination unto mercy. Nor can they well be feparated, feeing that .a Prince, exalted above others in dignity, is tied to an im partial way, neither hating nor fearing any, but rewarding and punilhing as caufe required! *, without which, contempt or confufion followeth. But to thefe irregu larities of Abbas I may not give the Attribute of Juftice i lince, if the punifhment exceed the fault, Juftice then degenerates into Cruelty; a Vice odious to God, who is the Father and Fountain of Mercyand unto Men, who are too apt to imitate bad Ex amples conceiting any Ad, though never fo unnatural, if moulded after fuch a pattern, commendable. Yea, we fee, that Heathen Potentates fwervingfrom the Divine Rule of Juftice, pamper the corrupt habit of their minds, out of a monftrous opinion that they may every way inebriate their luft without controul; as appears by thofe inhumane Games exercifed in the Roman Amphitheaters ; by that barbarifm Xerxes (as Xenophon notes) pradifed on Mafiftes his Brother, and other Satrapa's ^ fuch in Dejoces (Father to Phraartes) who laboured utterly to exterminate the Perftan generofity; and may add the miferable Tragedy of his Son, the memory whereof is recent through part of the grea ter A/ia. Abbas, by divers Wives, had feveral Children *, for whofe education neither coft, nor care, wasfpared: Of moft hope were Ifmael, Sophy-mir^a, Codobanda-Sultan, and £- mangoly ; four brave young Princes*, thetwofirft were begot on Gordina, Daughter of Simon-cawn\ the latter two of Martha^ Daughter of Scander-mirta'-, both Georgians, both Chriftians: the fir ft Lady was brought thence by Kurchiki-cavw the other by Shaw-Ta- mas 'Coolibeg both being Perfians, both Favourites: all of them fo dear to Abbas, that it feemed he then had got the Elixir of Earthly happinefs: His Wives were fo incompa rably beautiful, his Favourites fo exadly faithful; and his Sons fo lively the Charaders of his Perfon, policy and courage 4 , reciprocally joying the aged King, and over-joying the warlike Perfians. But it is commonly obferved, that as the moft excellent things al ter fooneft, and that no day is foferene that is notihadowed with fome Cloud; fo this candor and perfedion in thefe youthful Princes quickly vanilhed. For Jfmad (when by reaibn of his delight in Arms and quick figns of magnanimity, the Afiatick world gaz'd and admired him) in an infernal cloud of poyfon went down to an untimely grave at nineteen, in the meridian of his fplendour. Sofy-myrza, dogg'd by a like adverfe de- ftiny, though elevated at firft for revealing a confpiracy, was in the end at equal years thrown down and crufht to death, after the dumb Capigi had got a hateful vidory, meer jealoufie in the King commanding it. And Emangoly, e're his popular applaufe could hatch his ruine, upon conference with a Witch that underftood the Almuten of his na tivity,Hyrcania. Sha-Abbas his I7P tivity, perceiving that Ihort life attended him, grows fearful of his Sires inconftancv and in a deep and diiconfolate melancholy evaporates his fad Spirits; leavine the ex' pedation of hazard and Sovereignty to Codobanda Sultan, firnamed Soffee ; who ( made wife by his Brother's mifenes) fo prudently behaved himfeif in duty to the Kin? and in a pleafing and fafe dillance to tiie People •, that Abbas dotes, the People cek brate, and an uncontroulable good Fortune leems to dandle him. Affability bountv' loyalty, courage, and experience in Arms, at home and abroad 5 the Ferftm Monar chy, inrkj Arab, Mogul and Tartar, admiring, fearing, and commending him in feveral Eulogies : fo as his own left nothing unfaid or un-invented that might honour him * and his enemies without giving their thoughts the lye, could not but idolize him. Who for all that, (not like our common Spirits, efflated by every vulgar breath upon everVaft deifie themfelves, and conceit all great additions of honour below their merits,) ftood immovable ; forry he grew fo popular *, modeftly chiding them for flattery and con demned himfeif of hypocnfie by fuffering his vidories to be fo gilded; fince what he had or did was but a reflex of his Father's vertue, which he doubted might fuffer an e- clipfe by his accumulation. Oh! how execrable is this marrow-fretting fcab of iea- louiie and envy ! it converts that reafon which only makes us Men, without any regard of juftice, into brutifhnefs •, yea, to exceed in cruelty the molt unreafonable and molt violent Creatures! Is Abbas a King, a Father? does clemency belong to any attribute more properly ? Is Sojfee-Sultan-mirzjt a Prince^ his Son? On whom can he more juftly confer his love? in whom fhould Vertue rather dwell ? where can there be a better cen ter? Poor Prince! the path he treads to add luftre to his Father's Diadem and to ob lige his Countrey, betrays his fteps, and intices him to an affrighting precipice : For the more he indulges his Father, it ferves as fuel to an unjuft jealouiie ; the more he dignifies his Countrey by his good fuccefs againft the Turk, the more applaufe the People crown him with ;, but Abbas fears the more his popularity: Yea, fo far fears, fo much degenerates from paternal piety, that without pity or regard of juftice (which makes Kings more beautiful than when circled with Diadems) he contrives his mine. During thefe his Cabinet-machinations, the Prince brandiihes his fteel in proud Ara bia •, where after feveral conquefts the Vidor himfeif became captivated. For an Ara bian Princefs, of great beauty ( and in fuch Bodies ufually are impaled the faireft Souls) fettered him i but fUch was his bravery and worth as he quickly redeemed himfeif, and made her his prifoner; fuch magick and interchanges are in love,fuch magnetick power hath Princely vertue. By this Lady he had two Children,5^ and Fatyma a name given her (as I fuppofe) in memory of Fatyma the Wife of Mortis vf%,though not unlike both in Name and perfedion to that lovely Phcedima who was the Daughter of Otho a noble Verfan, mentioned in the 4. lib. of Herodotus. This young Princefs Fatyma was no lefs loved by Sojfee-MyrzA the Sire, than doted on by the Grandfire Abbas. A ftrange affe- dion, to diftinguifh fo unnaturally ! to feparate where Nature had foilrongly united! to hate the graft, and to endear the fruit! But that his hate might flow more currant- ly and lefs fufpeded, he looks one way and aims another ^ feeks to enrage by abufing him whom he loved molt dearly, Magar an Arab, the Prince's Tutors, a faithful and pru dent Servant. And indeed Fir bonus folm eft prudens, Ariflotle tells us in his JEthicks. Such was Magar, whom Abbas calls for, and in lieu of rewarding him for his Sons generous Education, darts him a Item frown, accufmg him of pride, and charging him that he had bewitched the Prince with a difloyal ambition. Magar for all his prudence fees not the venome prepared *, and therefore in an humble but confident innocence, excufes and endeavours to quiet him: But the more he vindicates himfeif, and the clearer he made the Mima's loyalty appear, the more he exafperates the King,, fo as the higher was his rage inflamed. At firft: the King amazes him with a volley of defamations,and in that maze gives thefign: a dreadful fign! for forthwith the Blood-thirlty break in and ftrangle him. A barbarifm! an ad fo unbecoming that famous King, that with the vulgar fort to this very day it will not be credited: Neverthelefs, Fames fhrill-mouth'd Trump founds it abroad, fo that the Prince (then in adion againft the Tmar) has no tice of it. -Whereupon, as a Man void of fenfe, immediately he leaves the Camp i and being come to Court, after many fignals of forrow, befeeches the King that he may know the reafon of Magar\ death: who flalhes him this thundring retort. For thy am bition. The Prince calls-Heaven to witnefs his loyalty : hut Abbas provokes him further^ to have more colour to fatisfie the world in his defigned deftrudion. The Prince in flamed with paiTion, inthat diftradion imagines he faw Magar a ftrangling^ and in that ecftafie unfheaths his Sword, vowing to refcue him. In the greateft, nay I may fay the wifeft of Men, Reafon hath not at all times the predominancy over Paffion as we find Aa 2 exem- iiff il Hexemplified in Shaw-Abbas an illuftrious Prince, and at fometimes reputed an indulgent Father: but now fo far from that, that he forrows not the leaft at his diftradion i but upon this miferable advantage (by fome fair terms firft difarming him) invites him into another room, and (pretending he was not very well) withdrawing himfelf, commanded feven big-bon'd villains, deaf and dumb, through a trap-door to ilfue into the room armed with bloody minds and deadly bow-ftrings ^ whofe very looks as well as habits and weapons quickly bewray their office and intention, which needed no other interpreters. The Prince innocently admires the caufe *, and if Oratory or other way of intreaty could have wrought remorfe in thefe hell-hounds5onely till he knew the ground of this cruel com mand, he had afforded it: But well knowing they were without reafon and inexorable, with an incomparable rage and vivacity he flew upon thofe moniters now one, then an other receiving fuch teftimonies of his courage, that (e're they could faften upon him their ghaftly twanging bow-ftrings) he fent three of them to the Deviland for fome time defended himfelf, offending thofe blood-hounds with admirable courage and dexterity; infomuch that had he maftered but any weapon, he had doubtlefs faved himfelf, and fent them packing; but wanting it, his breath failed, and longer his valour could not nourifhhim, for Facile efi vine ere non repugnant em : fo at laft they faitned their noozes on him, who now for want of breath was as a dead Man ^ and the villains had trium phed in his further tortures, had not the King (who it feems was not far off) prevented it, commanding them onely to pinion him, and (before he could recover fenfe and ftrength) by drawing a flaming fteei before his eyes made him ftark blind \ forbidding him the fight of what he moft loved. Wife, Bab^s, Friends and Magar\ Carcafs : By which impiety Afta loft her faireft Jewel, Ferfia her Crown of Honour, and Mars his Darling. The lofs of this brave Prince was quickly rumoured; All mourns, and in many Threnodies figh his Farewel: the Army alfo fwells with paifion, but feeing no remedy, by a forced fdence murmur their imprecations. The Prince, when he perceived his own undoing, (the eye of Reafon lent him fuch a fight, ) having curfed^his birth, his fame, his loyalty, and (which is moft fad) his parent ^ by many frantick threats vows his de- ftrudion: But Fana fine viribmira^ finds his revenge impoffible *, yet at that conceit roars hideoufly, and not to be comforted, till Suliman-miraay Curchiki-cawn and other his Kinf- men and quondam Favourites flocked about him, and by their miferable examples didate patience : none of which but in fome meafure had fwoln big with the King's infufion in their times, and through like jealoufies were made blind, or cruiht and damned to per petual Imprifonment. In thofe difcontented times Abbas kept his Orb, moving like another Saturn: for now he imagines his Grown fixt clofe to his head, nothing appearing that might difturb his quiet: and amongft his delights, nothing fo much pleafed him as young Fatyma \ no 5^- ren was melodious in fong, no Creature delicate in feature, fave pretty Fatyma: If any ftood in fear, who could compofe his paffion but Fatyma ? Court and Kingdom admired his love to this pretty Favourite, and no lefs rejoyced at if, for by this innocent Lady they oft-times found the way to expel his rage, and how to pleafure him: The Prifoners alfo by Fatyma got lively hood, for want of which they were oft-times well-nigh famifhed, none but fhe daring to mediate*, and thus by this good Infant gained they what former ly they pined for,food and comfort. But what joy has the blinded Prince, fince he cannot participate ? Revenge delights him more *, that word as Mufick beft pleafes the infernal fancy of this melancholy Mirzjt \ not caring how deteftable, fo Abbas fuffered. The Devil infpires new rage and blows the coals of ( more than cruel) afTaffination: For al beit he paflionately loved Fatyma) yet hearing how his Father doted on her, thatafrefh begets his hate, yea hatches the Innocents confufion. Oh! in him behold the favage and tranfeendent cruelty of curled Man: Revenge had plunged him headlong into a whirl pool of unnatural barbarifm; inlbmuch, as when the pious Child came (iu an unlucky hour ) to bring Jiim comfort, and by all fymptoms of duty to exprefs a lovely obedience ; the wretch grafps and in a lymphatick fury whirls her neck about, unable to untwift her felf from his wrathful hands, miferable Fatyma expiring by % her Hellifh Father ^ and in her, the joy of Parents, delight of Abbas, candor of Perfia, and com fort of the diftreffed, vaniihing. Theaftonifhed Princefs his Wife cries out, His light deceived him, that it was Fatyma! little dreaming, that he therefore martyred her be- caufe Fatyma. And, as if that had not been enough, (to prevent the King of a Sue- ceffor ) hearing young Sofee's voice, doloroufly crying out for Fatyma, winged with rage he gropes for him^ but by the Princelles interpofing the Child efcaped, or elfc had loft (what he now enjoys) the Perfian Diadem. AhhtMHyrcania. Ahhas when he had notice of this Tragedy, grows fo outragioufly paffionatp tlnr many feared he would become his own executioner: But when he had drenched hfs for row in a Sea of fait tears, he moderates his fpleen, and revives upon hopes of add Wo' nal pummraenn vowing to retaliate his diftradted aft in the height of cruelty Whkli being toW the Prince, had fo terrible a reply, with a million of difmal curfe addS that the King was as one aftomlbed. To conclude, after he had tyred out a few more minutes with impatience, and confidered that Death onely fets Man free from th n , fery of this World ,by breaking afunder the chains of bondage, the third day he dm ffh'lS A 0 ft b &amp; qUaffi ^ 'P a , CU P 0f P o y f0n - faith St. ChrMome .• Neverthelefs, the King ihewed needlefs Ceremony in his Obfequfes The difcontolate Pnncefs fequeftred her felf from the fight of Man: but fince Kn's coming to the Crown, whether he hath by his benign afpeft banilhed her difcontent fa uT u k a , W , a8 f h P er f0rra J w ' 1 could learn; but for himfelf he bad the World tarewel a little after our departure.

But in old times it fo fuperabounded with Wood, as that the whole was called Sylva Hyrcana •, and whence in probability it was that the cythians termed it Hercoorty i.e. A Solitary place in their Language : which neverthelefs nounlhed offenfive Creatures of feveral Kinds, as Snakes, which we faw abundance of But more efpecially Lions, Wolves, Foxes, Wild-Cats, Boars and Tygres ^ which lalt' a Poet mentions with an Emphafis, laying, Them with their duffs Hyrcanian Tygres fed.

Many fuch ftrange Springs have been found: Anftotle mentions one in Carthage *, at Occhm in Theffaly another fuch was as Pliny reports; near Oxm as Curtim • and the like near Babylon: tor that at Cardavas in Saxony near Brmfwickjis rather a fort of Bitumen^ not unlike that is evaporated in the Mare mortmm. This ftrange Spring puts me in mind of another memorable Water we faw and tafted of at Chacoporo a Town about twelve miles Weft from Farrahaut, both of them upon the brink of the Mare Cajpmm: For 11. Months it is fweet and potable*, but one Month every Year fo brackiih, as renders it unfit to drink or to drefs meat with. Tlutarch Vita Antonii relates, how that Mar\^ Anthony having marched through Media into Hyrcania, befieged Phraata the principal Town of that Province j but his battering-Engines being furprized in the way by Phra~ artes the Parthian King, and wanting Visual,was forced to retire, (hafte to en joy his Cleopatra adding to his fpeed v) fo as after feven and twenty days he palled the A- raxis, over which he had built a Bridge which was broken by the Enemy: In that march he loft 4000 Horfe and 20000 Foot, moft of which died of fluxes and thirft. The reafon I make mention of this, is in regard the ftory fays he paft a River that to view appear'd very clears but the Souldiers thinking to ajfuage their thirft found it increafed by the brackifhWater: for it gnawed their guts,andput them into other diftempers. Now feeing fome take Ph^rahaut for the reliques of Phraata above-named, it is very likely that this fait Stream at Chacoporo* was the fame which Plutarch takes notice of in that expedition. And that there are Springs and Rivers of feveral taftes as well as colours, is in no wife to be queftioned •, for thente it is that fome conclude a Spirim Mmdi: Now concern ing colours I have already inftanced ; and as to tafte, the Sea (experience teaches) is fair, not by Nature but by agitation partly, and partly through the power and efficacy of the Sun, which by his heat and beams attrads the fmall parts that be in the fuperfi- cies of the fait Water. PhMofophy alfo as well as Experience acquaints us, that in Sum mer the Sea is falter than it is in Winter; and that the Eaft and South Seas are moil fait: yea, by common tryal it is fo obferved. Moreover, the Sea-Water is much thicker and ftronger to bear ( as we find by common experience ) than frefh ; whereby it comes to pafs, that Ships leak and fink oftner in frefh Waters than they do in the Ocean. Beiides, feeing, lalt has heat, we may perceive how that fait Water inflames rather than extin- guiihes Fire: and for proof thereof have fundry examples •, as particularly in lib. 7. Macrobii) and 10 Symp. Phtarchi: the reafbn being evident, feeing drynefs is a quality that makes it a friend unto the Fire: For as Ariftotle ( Nature's principal Secretary ) ob- ferves, fait Water has a fort of fatnefs and oylinefs incorporated. 'And albeit Water in it felf(like the pureft oyl) naturally is without either fmell or tafte; neverthelefs per accidens it may have both, according as it doth participate with the quality of the Earth through whofe veins it floweth ^ and from thence ariies both colour, tafte and fmell', as w r e ufually obferve in fuch things as derive heat and tindure from Sulphur, Steel, Vitriol, Juniper, and the like. Now that the fat or oylinefs of the Sea Water inflames, I could give many inftances •, but fhall onely what was proved in that memo' rable Sea-fight 'twixt Mark^Anthony and Augufim C&lt;efar at ABiiim in the Gulph of Lepanto* as recorded by Plutarch and other Hiftorians.

The firft night after we left Ajharaff , we lodged in Ferrabdut-, which is five miles from Ajharajf. FERRABAUT is a Town upon the South-eaft fide of the Cajpian Sea, probably taking name from Ferrag-hant or Eerrag-z.ed, (Bant fignifies a Garden, Zed a Son,) who fucceeded Shezyr or Shaw-zyr Son to Jazjin-Zeddah, that was predeceltbr to Te-Jgird the Hyrcanian King flain by the Romans about the Year of our Lord 595. five and twenty Years before the zy £ra of the Mahometans took beginning.

The air rievertluelefs is not fo pure here as we could find it was in moft other places higher up: But whether caufcd from fome in- falubrious Marifhes that are there, or from the vapours that ufually arife from the Sea ( a little mile thence) I am not able to determine.

So that in all probability, it hath fome fecret vent or in-let into the Euxin or fome other Sea: For confidering how. that thefe mighty Rivers are inceffantly vomiting their full gorg'd watery ftomachs into it,* in reafon it may be granted that it would over-flow its banks, did it not as well empty as receive. For that is but a weak aifertion. That the Sun attrads equally by vapours to that excefs of water which is poured in. The Ihape or figure of this Sea is oval. From North to South the diameter is about 600 miles: towards the ftiore 'tis fhoal wa ter and full of Syrtes *, fo as Ships that ufually pafs over, draw not above eight foot wa ter when they are loaden; but being a few leagues off at Sea, 'tis very deep and hard ly fathomed. Bb M\amarcaaruJ urcomam a. cor QIotiXK^ 'urcdnid ^Sv J 'Perifcotv The Cafpian Sea, Hyrca nia. It has feveral Names attributed, differing as the Nations differ. The Arabians call it ( as they do all other great Lakes) Bohar Corfm ; the Rnjfe, Chualensca-more the Geor gians and Sarcafi name it Cm^ar^ Bachu and Sala, noted ports upon that Sea. The Ro mans termed it Mare Hyrcamm, the Terfians Ghylon, and Derioh Mozendram: by which Name moft of Hyrcama is called', albeit Magmm in his Adjunds toP^/ow/sMaps, pla ces it (erronioully as I apprehend) upon the South-eaft fide, where Mergiana ought to be : Upon the North it has that part we call Nagay ; on the Eaft Zagathai, Hyr- cania South ^ and part of Media and Armenia on the Weft, lurrounded with lofty Hills, furnilht with Fifh, and upon the fhore hath many Towns well peopled and traded to by fundry Nations. There is not any Author I know but confents that it-is Land-lockt, and hath no commerce or intercourle with the Sea by any vilible paflage through the fuperficies of the Earth; atteded by Travellers, who in feveral progrelfes by Land and Water, have found it fuch: Its vaft body (as I faid formerly) gains it the Name of Sea. • j £o L ^ kes ^ ar as m the holy Land and other places^ might be rnftanced. This, as other Seas, is a gathering together of perpetual Waters nouriihed with Springs ^ which being in nature fo rare, and by Learned Mens conjedures lo obicure, lutter me to ftay a while in the difquifition. This ( as fome great Lakes and noted Rivers I fhall hereafter mention) hath in all pro- Dabiuty, as I lately laid, fome fecret courie, which gives it an intercourle with fome Sea, and molt likely with the Euxine, both becaufe of its Voiiinage, no other Sea being lo near it as the Euxine, and for that the Euxine hath a current or flux, which „ 0 , iI1 fj eaitern fliore towards the Mare Cajpmm runs along the zAifluarmm of the PalM Meottps ; which (as Comarenusthz Venetian obferved) hath a ftronff current towards the Thracian BoJphorw, and flows hence into the ^gean md Mediterranean prin cipally occafioned, as fuppofed, by the Water which by fome invifible paifage ftreams from the Cajpun.

For, as ^LS? a S CtrpemrUh i chap. 9. Geogr. obferves, we may demand, Whether thofe no^ f /'too,and others fancy ) were ever fill'd with Water, yea or , ow are they capable of more ? But that they were never f.ird ,is not withoutan abfurdity to imagin; As if any Cavern fhould be fo vaft and comprehenfible a&lt; in upwards of 5000 Years continual pouring in fo much Water as thofe many sreat Ri vers abundantly furmfh, could be capable of holding more Water. How can it then rationally be otherwife imagined but that this hath fome fecret meam or inter courfe with lome Sea; either by forae unknown channel under ground, or River that ciandeftinety iffiies thereout. But that it hath a mixture with the rather than with the Perpm Gulph or Scythtque Seas, may be gathered from its nearer voifinage to the Eiixine by many hundred miles than any other Sea. It is nevertelefsobfervable what an ancient Author writes, Plmarchm, Dionyfrnfr erumtere traduntunde Strabo, Patrocltim nohilem Script or em in ea fuijfe fententia fcrihit, ut ex India ad Hyrcmos mvigari pofe crediderit: meaning ( as 1 apprehend ) that either by the River Oxm or Jaxartes there^s a paflage into the Caftian Sea from that part of India which is about Lahore. But thofe great Rivers emptying themfelves into the Mare Cafbium, sive it an mcreafe or charge, but no difcharge, which is our fcrutiny. And albeit the paf fage or Vent be but conjedural, yet will it the fooner be believed by paralleling it with the like fubterranean palfages obferved infeveral famous Rivers, of which I fhall in- ftance a few particulars, viz.. Such is Eridanm or Fo in Italy y Erafinm in Araolica the Rhine in Germany, Tigris through Arethnfa, Hyyanis in Scythia, Ana in Spain, which run ning fifteen miles under ground is a Bridge whereon icooolheep grafe daily as the Spa- niard boafteth; Zyoberis in Hyrcania, which after 40 miles courfe under the Earth, re appears in the River Rhodago, Alexander at Arifiotle's requeft by putting in 2 Oxen, made good the report Liens in Natalia, our Mole in Surrey*, but more remarkably the River Atyhem that waters the City Llk in Morea, which after a large race through Achaia, is fwaliowed up, and in fome profound channel makes way through the Mediterranean Sea into the River ArethUfa that waters the City Syracttfe in Sicily, - 1 Alpheutn, fama eft hue Elidis amnem Occultas egifle vias fub Maria, qui nunc Ore Arethufa tuo Siculis confunditur undis. as Virgil lib. 3. *y£neid.

Scaliger likewife in his 37 Exercit. fuppofes the Cafpian to have a recourfe under ground into the JEuxine. Moreover, that the Cafpian hath fbme paflage under ground and intercourfe with the Ocean, may be prefumed by its producing thofe kinds of Fifh whofe ordinary abode is in fait waters, namely Porpice, Conger, Gudgeon,Thornback,Turbut, Cacfcrel, Skate, Soles, Oyfters, Lobfters, Crabs, Sturgeons, the roe of which makes Caveare Cabirot tht French call it, and Mullet, the roe of which makes Potargo( with other Sea fifli I might mention) not delighting in frelh waters. Nor is this a new opinion, feeing that great Geographer Strabo in his Difcourfe thereof, SinumOceani adBoream ejfe tra- dunt, &amp;c. and Bafil. that great Scholiaft in his 4. Homil Hex am. faith. Mare mum eft, ut illi dicunt qui orb em perluftraverant, etiamfi enim Hyrcanum &amp; Cafpium mare per fe perforata funt, hac tamen duo maria' in Pontum Euxinum fefe infinuant: poflible to him with whom nothing is impoffible; but in making the Hyrcanian or Cafpian Sea duo maria I know not his authority, feeing thofe two names make one Sea: Yet probably in that miftake ta king Arifiotle for his guide, who indeed fo diftinguifhes them: An error obferved and excufed by Vicomercatw in his Comment, upon Arift. Meteors, In hoc (faithhe) Ari- floteles eft condonandus, cujm temporibus nec Terra nec Mare plane perluftrata fuerant. And for the better entercourfe of the Cajpian and Euxine fome Monarchs of old, notwith- ftanding that vaft diftance of place and furging grounds which interpofe, have attem pted to cut fuch a fluce or channel as fhould be navigable for Veflels to pafs from each other. For example Seleuchm Nicamr with incredible labour and expence endeavoured what Art could effed to make them communicable: but before his work was half done, he was unhappily flain by Ptolomy Ceramm the ^Egyptian King, as Erafmm relates, where by his great defign mifcarried. Some of the Perfian Kings alfo, whofe immenfe power made them think nothing impoflible, attempted the like, untill by fruitlefs endeavours they were made to underftand their vanity. Now, to know whether this Cafpian have that property other lalt Seas have, as to,ebb and flood ^ to fatisfie my curiofity, one day I ftood fome hours upon the ftrand pur- pofely to obferve its motion; and albeit there was little or no wind ftirring at that time, yet the water was fomewhat turbulent and rolling elpecially towards the fhore, and not unlike what we obferve in calm weather in our narrow Seas, and in its waves Bh 2 refem-188 Cafpian Sea. refembled a flux and reflux of the water; and though not in fuch a meafure as with us upon the Bnglijh Ihore, yet more than is Within the Baltique Seas, and the water more fait *, that in the Baltique being frefli by reafon of the ft ore of melted fnows which with the frefh water floods is incefTantly poured in; as in fome meafure 'tis in the Cajpian, which is the caufe that it abounds fo much with Eels, Lampreys, Trouts and fuch other Fifli as love to be in the frelh waters and withal to manifeft its faltnefs is proved by the plenty of Mullet, Sturgedn, Lobfters,X)yft€rs, and thofe other Filh I lately mentioned. So as to Ipeak pofitively, I fhall with Scaliger in his Exercitat. againft fay, i n ceani limn del Zur Boreali r nullm eft aftm, &amp;c, which may be the condition of the Man Cajptum* But to affign a reafon for the ebbing and flowing of the Sea is a task too haM for me feeing it hath puzzl'd great Scholars not a little: That of Euripm amazed Jylfidtk] though Secretary of Nature v being indeed to be ranked inter occulta Nature For albeit none may circumfcribe the powerful ads of the Almighty within the compafs of natural caufes, neverthelefs fome afcribe the proper caufe unto that vaft flux of frefh Water, which in places infinite is perpetually poured in by Rivers ^ as alfo from the clouds in a vaft: proportion. Some likewife alcribe it to the equilibration of the Earth and Sea-, but the molt platifible opinion, efpecially of the Platonifls, is from the powerful influ ence of the Sun and Moon ( the nobleft if not the greateft of all the Planets) as the prin cipal caufers*, efpecially .the Moon, which undoubtedly hath a great influence over all moift Bodies, of which the Seals chief. So as at the full Moon, when the Sun gives her the greateft light and power, the Sea then flows foigheft, and ebbs loweft, as her light decreafes; and agreeable to her courfe we fee the tides are higher and lower: For as Agcllus in his 14. Ub. notes. The Sea is the Moon's afTociate, ebbing and flowing as the Moon grows old and young v altering as the Moon alters, and pafles the Cadi Cardi- nes •, fuch and fo powerful are the influence and operation of her beams. Others never thelefs afcribe this ebb and flood to the falthefsof the Sea*, which faltnefs {AriftotU fays) is caufed by the Sun's exhaling the thinner and frefher parts thereout, leaving behind what is thick and brinifh: or (as ShMger) by fome participation with fome fulphu- reous minerals which vapour amongft it: upon which account it is Ariflotle in his ProbUms afferts, that the Sea is hot. Now that faltnefs is the efficient caufe may the ra ther be granted, in that tis demonftrative that fait waters have much more heat than frefh waters have. For, albeit fpirits are concealed in all forts of humids bodyes, yet do they appear moil in what is fait: whence fome obferve. That thofe vigorous fpirits which exift in the fait humour, is, or at ieaft caufes that tumour which we ordinarily in fair weather fee moving the furface 6f the Sea which ebbs and flows in various mo tion v which moves Carpenter in his Gedgr. to fay, That the Sea as a Terreftrial Heaven, therein imitates the celeftial Orbs,from whence proceeds this turbulent motion. Howbeit, We may not imagine that this flux and re-flux of the Sea is fo difcernable in the Ocean far from Land as tis in the narrow Seas near the fhore, where we behold the Sea vio lent and ragmg if difturb'd by wind, and fretting by having bounds, but rather liable and to the eye without any perfpicable motion. Upon which confideration it is that Homer terns the Ocean A great ftandiftg Pool, and Semca refembles it to a dull mafs or heap of matter, which Nature could not bring to perfedion. Albeit, it cannot be deny'd that in calm weather (whenthe Sky and Sea are alike ferene) the water is pact fique and without the leaft vifible curl Or wrinkle; and yet near the fhore a fpirit dif- covers its fpontaneous motion. For motion it doubtlefs hath from wind within, which as I have often obierved, makes it heave and rowl when there is not the leaft breath of air above by which and by the appearmg of fome Birds,and Fifh playing and frisk ing above the water, Mariners have an infallible prelage of the weather, and prepare by that fair Warning accordingly agaifrft an approaching ftorm,happily fore-told thefti by thefe watery Inhabitants from a fenfe and inftind they have of the enluing altera- tl0n * ^ 0 T as not to be deny'd, That winds are generated in the womb of the Sea, aswellasbowels of the Earth, and give an equal difturbance for their better making way to their proper place or element. TjJ* n ufually crofs this Cafpian Sea from Aftracanto Derhent or Ferrahaut- Inis paflage is when the winds are favourable^ for through adverfe winds Sir Anthony erley was eighty days in his paffage.

But at Ferrahaut and other : Sea Towns we faw great Vetfels with mails and fails, flat-bottom'd, unlefs they were fuch as traded from port to port, keeping in light of Land, having little knowledge of the Compafs, or other help for Navigation lave what the Pole-ftar and other Ardick Conftellations adminiftred. The greateft of thofe VeiTels I faw exceeded not 30 Tun •, in which they neverthelefs adventure to crofs to Aftracan or Citra-Kann^ as they call it, a noted Town and Ifle in 47 degrees North la titude : the Ifle is 12 miles long and 3 broad. The Town is feated upon a rifing ground, about which is a Line for defence, and upon the works fome pieces of Cannon mounted; the Houfes are not many nor well built, but fufficiently peopled. And albeit the foil be barren and the air bad, yet fuch is the attrad of gain, that it is much reforted to by Merchants of feveral Countreys who trade hither for Furs of Foxes,Sables,Woolverin Ermyn, Lufern, Miniver, Beaver, Otter, Squirrel and the like, which Kitflia and the Dominions under the Mufcovite and Tartar abound with, as alfoforFilh, and more efpe- cially for Caveare,which being fauc't with fallet-oyl, vinegar and pepper is held a dainty, and Potargo, and principally for fait which they extrad from fait water, and vend in great quantity, to the increafe of the Duke's Cuftoms', whofmcehe wrefted it from the Negay Tartar in the Year of our Lord 1494. hath ereded a Caftle of good defence there, as appeared when Johanms Bafilm the Emperour ( about fix years after ) gave Selymus'the Grand Seignior two memorable defeats, at fiich time as he brought his Armies hither in behalf of the injur'd Tartar: And the like foon after by his Son Bafiliades\ which good fuccefs gave the Kuffe a peaceful polFeffion and fubjedion. Six leagues from Afiracan runs the great River Folga* or Wolga as here pronounce^ which fprings out of a Mountain about 100 miles from Teroflave in Rujfm in the latitude of 60 degr. where after a little fpace the channel is well-nigh expatiated fo broad as the Thames at London ; and after 2000 miles courfe inlarges more, and near this He in feve ral great Oftiums difgorges its watery ftomach into the Cajpim Sea. Were the dep?h of this great River anfwerable to its breadth and length, it would compare with any other River, and better incourage Navigation*, yea be much more frequented by Euro- paans than it isin regard it affords a much nearer and eafier paffage into Perfiaandthz Indies, than we have by the way of Aleyp and Trefizjond, and much more expeditious than by furrounding Afriqua. For Experience teaches us, that Ihips which fet out from London which is ufually in Afril, do with a fair gale of wind arrive in two months Ipace at Saint Nicholas in where the North Pole is elevated 66 degrees 30 minutes *, from which place we pafs upon the Dvoina by boat to Vologda in 7 days more, and from thence in 2 days by Sled to upon the River Volga, whence by boat Hkewife we pafs down to Afiracan in lefs than 30 days , fo as the whole from Saint Nicholas to Aftracan ( moll of the way being by water ) is computed 2600 English miles at the utmoft •, and from Aftracan to E err ah ant (under the Verfian) or Derbent, the paflage may with a fair wind in three days or little more be accomplilhed taking great heed as they fail, the water (by reafon of fhoalds) being very dangerous in fundry places. D ERBE N T is a Port Town upon the Cafpian ftiore, of great ftrength and no lefs antiquity: being fuppofed that the foundation thereof was laid by Alexander the Great, who alfo ereded that great and ftrong Caftle tailed Kaftow adjoyning it; from whence he drew a running trench as far as Tefys, the greateft part whereof was countermur'd with a thick wall of ftone, the ruins whereof are yet apparent ^ through which was the onely way or palfage from Mengrellia and thofe parts, into Media and Hyrcama, called by Geographers of old, Cancafia vel Iberia porta ; and though helpt by Art, is never thelefs by Pliny termed Ingens opus Nattpra. So as thence is may be gathered, it was no lefs defenfive in its natural fcituation. That Hiftorian alfo gives us the dimenfion, 1 Ihi tranfitm patet duntaxat 300 paffm, and worthily reckoned amongft the Wonders of AJia. Befides that, from the Town unto the Sea (more than a mile) two Walls are raifed, which be eight foot thick and thirty foot high *, the diftance betwixt the Walls being about eight hundred foot or eightfeore paces. Moreover the Town it felf for Trade is not inferiour to any other upon that fea; moft of the noted places thereabouts as alfo from Trepizond and other Ports upon the Euxine frequently repairing thither for commerce, which enriches the Town and makes it the more populous. Moreover, as it is a Garri- fon 'tis made more defenfive byj regular Fortifications, which have been occafionally ad ded to the old Wall that of it felf is both large and ftrong; altogether of that account as by a good reporter it is called Vrbs mius Orientis mmitijjima. The circuit of the Wall is three miles, and affords a profped into the Mare Cafpium.

'Twixt this City and Derhent is that noted Emporium fome call Arajh ( and not impro perly,feeing it is watered by a ftream flowing from the fwift River Araxity) but accord ing to others fm^andby other fome Seres: from which and from that abundance of raw Silk which is here vended, the Countrey thereabout is by fome miftaken for the Serica regio •, albeit the truth is, Silk is extraordinarily plentiful here, and upon Camels in large quantities carried to Caftan^ where the Manufadures of Carpetting and feveral forts of Silk-ftufFs are in perfedion, not a little to the Town's advantage. At this place alfo there is ftore of Cotten-wooll and Galls, which Merchants value: but of Piftachoes, Pomgranads, Grapes, Melons, Orenges, and like fruit which Travellers efteem of^ here is abundance. From hence to Bachn ( upon the Cafpian fhore ) are about eighteen Enalifh miles v a fmall Town, yet of fuch note with Geographers as they call the Sea ad- joyning it Mare de Bachn-, that which by moft is named Caspian: near Bachn is (as I have heard) a Spring whereout the Inhabitants have a kind of oyl of a dark colour, which ferves for Lamps and other houlhold ufes, and without any favour that is offenfive. Thence to Bildith is fourteen more *, the Countrey for the moft part level and fruitful^ by being thorowly watered both by Araxis and Cyrm. Returning to Ferrahaut, We travelled along the Sea fide and came the rirft night to Chacoporo, which is about twelve Englijh miles Weft from Ferrahaut: the way we rode was clofe by the ftiore. This Town lies open to the Sea, which beats oft fo outragioufly againft her banks that the Inhabitants are oft put to charge in maintaining them. Here we crofled over afrefli Water that was about a ftones caft over ^ one month in the Year 'tis fait (as the Inha bitants told us, but not the reafon of it:) This is that fait ft ream I lately mentioned in the march Marcus Antonm made from Phraata. Next night we rode to Barfrnjhdea, a large Town pretty well built, and no lefs well peopled: but the Sea doth not fo much advantage them as the Land, by reafon of that plenty of Silk-Worms they nourifli: and indeed the place appeared to us the pleafanter by reafon of that plenty of Wood and Water it had, which was as good as plentiful. Here they would drink no Wine, the Law prohibits it; but the ground of that Law we could not learn, though we did fuppofe it was from that ridiculous Tradition of the mifcarriage of Arott and Marot the two debaucht Angels. From Chacoporo to this place was twelve long miles: The Inha bitants we could perceive delighted much in Archery; an exercifethefeCountreyshave even from the infancy of time been not a little famous for *, and which gave the belt of the Latine Poets the occafion to celebrate their Neighbours of Jthyra in the fecond of his Georgicks.

Howbeit, built it is under the North fide of the imperious Mountain T aurm: and of fuch grandeur, that no lefs than three thoufand Families there inhabit: They were then a mixture of feveral Nations, Armenians^ Scythiansy Perfians, Jem, Curds, Bannyans, Indians and Mufcovians, whO albeit they make a Babel of feveral Languages, yet live harmonioufly •, and whicb is no lefs remarkable being tolerated their own forms (for in matter of Confcience they queftion none %Hyrcania.

But in this,what is belt worthy our obfervation is,That in the diftnbution of Days, the feventh Day (upon which God relted in contem- plation or ms fix days labour)hath delervedly the preeminence over all the reft of the Week-days, in which, the ftrufturc of the Univerfe was created; for the excellencv of that Day we may perceive by this, is morally acknowledged by molt Nations, whether Civil or Barbarous. To proceed. * The Town is built in a large level, but withal a very pleafant and fruitful foil; happv in her prefent profpenty and former greatnefs •, her vifible ruins making good the re port that once it was this Countrey's Metropolis: nor are her Buildings of the meaner fort, or the Caftle unworthy notice, feeing it gives place to none I faw in all that Pro vince for beauty or ftrength being fortified by a deep Moat or Trench it has that is fall of water and compafles the Caitle, fo as the onely entrance is by a Bridge which they draw and let down at pleafure ; ferving as a place of good defence to fecure them- felves againft the rodomontado's of the neighbouring Tamfiamznd other Montaineers* and few Houfes but have their Gardens. Yet of beft note is the Cathedral or fewma Ma- chit,m which(as we were told)are intombed four hundred forty four Princes andProphets* whofe Sepulchres though they be not fo magnificent as that which with xooo Talents jHexdndcv railed for his Friend Ephejiiow near this place, yet fuch they are as raife ve neration amongft the People, if not admiration with pafiengers •, efpecially that of Jgowmadeenjto which they chiefly offer the myfteries of their Religion. When I entred, I found about a fcore of ancient grave Arabians or Zophilars Tittingcrofs-legg'd in a circle near the Prince's dormitory, with each an Arabic^ Book laid before, out of which both modeftly and mufically they performed their Exercifes. This as I fuppofed was the JPa~ remalia vel [acra funefla in honorem mortuorum. After the Eaftern mode they wagg'd their Bodies, bowing their heads and battologizing the names Allongh whoddaw and Mohumet very often: wherein they were fo ferioufly compofed, that albeit I entred unexpededly amongft them and in my Countrey habit ( which gave moft fafety in travel, and elfe- where was fufficiently admired,) neverthelefs they continued their Service without di- fturbance or deviation •, yet was no fooner ended but they arofe, very civilly bad me welcome, andlhewed me withal what antiquities the place afforded, and as they thought might be acceptable to a Stranger. Thence paifing to the River fide (over which upon a Bridge of ftone we rode the night before ) to refrefh my felf under fome Poplars *, for, as fays a Poet of another like place, this had 'Beds of grafi, and Walks in Jhady Woods, And Meadows ever green with Cryfial floods. feven or eight more beautiful than bafhful Damozels (like fo many Nymphs) fprangout of the Water, as I fuppofe to admire my habit: But I no lefs admiring their confi dence, quickly left them*, having this in thought, Quod non vetat Lex, hoc vet at fieri pu- dor: For the truth is I took them for Amorofa's and violators of the bounds of Mode- fty *, until from better fatisfadtion I was made to believe it was fimplicity and the op-^ portunity they took to fee a Stranger : for when the Sun- mounts to his Meridian the Men commonly go to fleep, and the Women then have the benefit of the River where they ufe to fwim, and probably cool their heat, in both kinds 'tis to be feared too much there abounding. The habit of thefe Water-Nymphs was a fine Shuddero or Lawn embroidered at the neck, wrift and skirt with a border of feveral coloured filks and threads of gold •, but in publick they go veiled according to the common mode with a long fheet which from top to toe covers them. From Omoal we travelled to Larry-John or Joon as Ibme pronounce it; being proba bly that 1 find mentioned in Ptolomy. This place is from Omoal thirty miles: And here the Kingdom of Hyrcania is terminated by Mount Haurm \ a Mountain reputed the greateft through all the World, both for length and height: For in one continued ledge of hills it makes way from the lelfer Afia unto the furtheft part of Eaft-India, not lefs than 3000 miles. And for proof of its greatnefs, I vouch Ariftotk who affirms thatIpl Mount Taurus, that TaHrm tnons omnium eft maximxs- And that ^ Taurm ell And Dion.

So that upon the whole I may fitly apply what hath done to one much inferiour, the Adenine ; Nu l] 0 quocjj vcrtice Tellus than which no earthly fart more high doth rife, Aldus intuitur, propi6rve accedit Olyrapo. Or whofe approach comes nearer to the Skies. So hi2h as the labour we endured was very great in the afcending. For albeit our travel in and over this Mountain was fometimes through narrow inhofpitable ftraits, other-whiles it was over extraordinary Hills; fuch Hills, as after two days winding and gainful climbing (for 1 may fo call it, feeing that oft-times we durft not ride,) we got fo high that we could clearly fee the clouds hanging a great way below us, and obfcu- rine the Earth, the higheft vapours feldom rifing above 50 miles from the Earth, if we credit the learned Eratoflhenes and by the fenfible alteration of the air might well per ceive we were mounted a good way up into the middle Region: fo different was it from the weather we found below; and to our fad remembrance no lefs different in operation, than rationally could not otherwife be expeded, afcending from a hot and defcending into a hotter Countrey: For a Gentleman of our Company and of our Country died foon after •, and my felf not minding to alter my thin habit, by the like cold I took upon the Mountain and in our defcent into a very hot foil, fell into fb violent a dyfen- tery, as in eleven days gave me a thoufand ftools, molt of blood. But whether it had any influence upon thofe honoured Perfons Sir Dodmore Gotten and Sir Robert Sherley, I cannot judge *, albeit they both were in good health when we palfed thofe Hills, and left this World for a better within a month after. Tint arch writes concerning Lucullm, that purfuing Tigranes the Armenian King he had the like experience of the air here •, differ ing fo much froin the air of the Countrey more remote, as put the Annie into a di- Itemper. But more efpecially this gives me occafion to call to mind what Acopa the Spaniard reports concerning thofe high Peruvian Mountains called Peria~Cac&lt;e ; which in palling over put him into a diftemper he could not better refemble than to a Sea-iicknefs, vomiting fo much that he thought he fhould have died; caufed through the fubtilty of the air and the fublimity of thofe Hills, which he fays furpafs the Alps and Pyrene Mountains no lefs than lofty Towers do ordinary Cottages. Now the afcending this Mountain Taurm was not more troublefom I thought than the defcending: for in fome places we had the path fo uneven and fo unskilfully cut, that we were in danger of tumbling down a deep and dreadful precipice^ at the bottom of which we could hear what we could not fee, a hollow murmuring Water. But one part of that Mountain was a more frightful palfage than the reft ^ agreeable to thatin Ovid, Per compendia Montis pracipita via ; this for the fpace of three miles being cut or forced through the fide of a perpendicular Hill, the top and bottom of which was undifcernable, the wideft part not being much above a yard*, infomuchasif twoHorfe-men fhould chance to meet, 1 faw not how they could fafely pafs by one another unlefs they madelikeihift the two Goats mentioned in Pliny did *, who accidentally meeting in fuch a place, had no way to preferve themfelves, but by the couching of the one whiles the other paft over. That paffage at Pen-mm-maur 'twixt Aber-Conway and Bew marris in little refembles this*, but for danger is not comparable. A very wretched pafs, and good caufe have I to remember it: For, whiles I was fometimes through a needlefs curiofity looking up, wondring at the great height above, and anon darting my fight down, no lefs marvel ling at the depth below, unawares a Rock that jetted ill-favouredly out of order, unex pectedly ftruck me fuch a blow that 1 was fowewhat aitonied,and happily delivered from a fall into that abyfs. A Rock I may fay that demands an uncivil tribute of heedlefs Paf- fengers. Howbeit, out of that formidable path of death we got at length to the top of that imperious Mountain which by its evennefs for full fifty miles (fiich was its breadth from Omoal to Damoan) and incomparable profped it afforded, made Ibme amends for the danger we had lately paifed: For from thence we raifed our proiped fo well as the interpofing mifts -would fuffer, not onely over the breadth of Hyrcania, but far into the Cajpian Sea as we apprehended, (certain we could not be, feeing it was above a 100 miles diftanf,) f or the reflex of the Sun's rays which are better combined in a plain fuperficies than where the profped is over Hills and Dales, and the air near the Sea, byMount T by being intermixt with thick and watery vapours, the Sea alfo by a refraded fiaht prefenting it felf in a thicker medinm y rendred the objed lefs diftinguifhable: and fave that it was a delight to have an uninterrupted objed, little other ufe could we make of What we faw at that diftance our fight was fo Imperfed. But without doubt, from hence (for Taurm and Cancafm differ not) that ancient Aftronomer Tromethem Brother to Adas firft obferved and inftruded the Ajfyrians in the motion of the Firmament, the A- cronical riling and fetting of the Stars and Bodies Celeftial •, and found out the caufes of Meteors, Eclipfes and other occult caufes and curiofities in Nature: and whence it was that the fabulous Greeks report that by Mercury he was chained to a Rock and his heart continually gnaw'd by a Vulture at the command of fupter, the penalty being in- Aided for his feloniousfoaling celeftial Fire from folio's Chariot-wheels to enliven his inanimate Statua *, albeit ?alias was accelfory, by whofe perfwafion Hercules fhot the Vulture at the Marriage of Thetis. Howbeit, Geraldm finds out a contrary Mythology*, defining him only for a melancholy perfon, overcharged with anxiety, griping care gnaw'd his heart as it were a Vulture. 0 Now from this higheft Tarrafs of the World look we towards the North-eaft, and fix our eyes upon that part of Tartary which this Mountain vifits where it falutes Jmaus. fartaria is fo large a Countrey as it contains not onely a third part of the continent of the greater Jfia, but extends it felf a great way into the moil Eaftern part of Europe *, comprehended in thefe three, Sarmaria Afiatica, Scythia and Cathaia : which fome di vide into five, i. viz.. Tart aria antiqua, 2. Zacathai intra Jmaum, ^.Cathai extra Imaumy 4. Deferta or Sarmatia Afiatica, 5 and Mimr Tartarian which includes the Pracopenfe with thofe that live 'twixt Tanais and Borifthenes. The Name as fome apprehend is from the Hebrewy andfignifies a remnant or icattered Generation. Others derive it from the River Tartar which runs through thofe Provinces they call Mongaly We Gog and Magog •, altogether peopled by vagrants or fuch as are without certain Habitations their wealth wholly confifting in their Cattel.

A fierce perfidious and crafty People they are, by continual pradice made expert in riding, darting, and no lefs exercifed in footmanlhip ■, have little or no civility fave in Zagathaiy where they alfociate in Town- fhip, and are taught it by the Commerce they have with their civilized Neighbours. Bread they eat very feldom for Mares milk, flelh half boiled, fowr milk and herbs are their greateft dainties. About the Year of our Lord 1200 they firft embraced Ma homet : Neverthelefs many Jews are commorant amongft them, fo as both Seds now ufe Circumcifion.

The firft that fovereignized over them that we read of was Cingis-chawn ; who by help of fome affociated Hoords firft fubjeded Vn-chan, by fome ftiled Trefier-John ( diftind from him in Ethiopia ; ) after that Argon, and at length died in Ketoa-kotan A. D. 1228. In this more memorable, that he was the immediate Anceftor of Tamberlang, from whom the prefent Mogul is in a dired Line defcended. But feeing Mergiana is neareft us, for Zagathai ( which is but a new Name impofed by Zoa or rather Sha~hatai father of Ogg Father of Tamber lane *, though I rather apprehend the derivation from Saca, it being part of that the Perfians call Scythia and adjoyning Cathay a takes the Name of Sacathay) comprehends Mergiana y Battria and Sogdiana ( in which laft was the Majfagetes Countrey, ) to the North being terminated by the River Chefely by the Mare Cafpium to the Weft, by Imam or rather Paropanifa* to the South, and to the Eaft by the Wildernefs called Lopp. Which Mergiana by Pynetm is termed Tremighen ; by Caflaldus Jefelbajh, by reafon of the green Turbants which they wear, as he was.mif-informed j for 'tis true, that in the Turkijh Tongue Bajh fignifies Head, yet Jefel is not Green : fo as it rather feems to take the denomination from the River Chefely a noted River called Jaxartes of old which waters that Countrey and flows into C c the^ Sogdiana.'BaUria. Hen, the Cafhian* A Country fo fruitful in Corn and Wine, as gave Straho the occafion to report how that one bunch of Grapes prefented Alexander filled a basket two cubits about *, which incouraged him to found that City which after his own he named Alexan- dria, it was after called Antiochia and Selencia, but fince Indian. Fifty miles hence is Mar an, at which Town Shaw-I^mael the Perfian King gave a notable defeat to one of the great Chans of Tartary. But moll remarkable is this Region, for that (as is be lieved) the Patriarch Noah foon after he forfook the Ark here planted; and either he or fome other to his memory built the City of Nijfa^ fo called by Ptolomy in his feventieth Table of Afia cap. 10. a Derivative queftionlefs from Noyjfa, rather than Nifem, as thofe write it who pretend Bacchus to be the founder of it, unlefs they were one. Hence alfo Nimrod and the reft departing into the Vale Shynaar, through the confufion of fpeech occafioned by the impious defign they had in raifing Babel, difperfed themfelves, fo as from them in few years after the greateft part of the earth became more or lefs inhabited. Sogdiana adjoyns this Province, watered by the River Oxus or Nycapkac: a fatal place to the Perfian and Alfyrian Monarclis, by being a boundure to their boundlefs ambition: But contrarily, from thence have iflued fuch fwarms of people as at feveral times N have well-nigh over-fpread the Univ^rfe. This Province was fubjeded to the Per ft am : for here Cyrus built another Cyrofolis to keep out the invading Tartar j Alexander another Alexandria Oxiana in44deg. as alfo Alexandria Vltima in 41. And at this which was built by Cyrm it was where the vidorious Greek received fiich a blow upon the head from thebefieged, that for fome time he was reputed dead: but being taken, for that churlifli entertainment it was levelled with the ground. Battria has Mergiana to the Weft, to the Eaft and North Sogdiana and the River Oxm, and to the South Aria and part of Paropamifa, now known by the name of Corazan) which too is part of Sagathai and under the Perfian : but I rather take the Southern part to be fo called. In former Ages Samarchand which has 38 deg. (called Maracanda in Ptolomy and Quint. Cur tins y Samracana in Chalcondyles, and Paracanda in Strabo) was the moft noted Emporium or Oppidum nmdinarium not only of Baftria but of any thereabouts} yea, for fome Ages the Mart 'twixt India and the Roman fubjeds. Famous alfo for that it was the place which gave both birth and burial (though fome fay at Anz.ar) unto Tam- berlane that great Vidor (who in eight years fubjeded more Countreys than the Ro man could in eight hundred:) Where alfo the Traitor Bejfus furprized by Spitamenes was delivered to Alexander, who rewarded him anfwerable to his demerit: But his rafli putting to death at this place Clytus that faved his life at the battel of Granvicus puts fuch a ftain upon Alexander then in drink, as all the tears he ihed when fober could not wipe off the blemilh. It is now become a poor place, and gives precedency to Bochar, which elevates the Pole Artick forty degrees called of old Baftra, and before that Zoroajles and Zoroafpa, probably from Zoroafter their firft King who was (lain by Ninus. This Zoroafler was the greateft Aftronomer in his time, and Praditioner in Art Magick, in which and theFire-worfliip he firft inftruded the Perfians : thofe Books he writ concern ing Liberal Arts, and the Cataclifm in fourteen pillars half brafs, half brick (like thofe attributed to EmchhdoiQ the Flood) Ninus defaced.

Which Town alfo at this day fubmits to Chorazan that gives name to the whole Province, (called Coraxia in Pliny, Coruana in Procopim, Corafphy in Ptolomy, and Korafmia in Athemus,) fubdi- vided into Heri, Farghan and Tochariflan. Heri in former times was called Aria, which fome miftake for Sab left an that we now czWCandahor *, included betwixt Hyrcania and Paropamifa albeit Herodou I. 7. places it m the North of Media by the Greeks fo called, but by the Arabs Ahebal.

Tochariflan takes Name from Tochara, (Seres atq'f Tochares gentts pfope Indiam-, IT mentions:) the originary Seat it is of the Tore j the pofterity of Togarmah Sonof Gomr: a People confined or fhut up by Alexander, and not adventuring into the World till rou ted by Heraclius in his long and fierce War with Cozjrhoe the Ferfmn.

Many conliderable Towns were there but of belt note are T/*^, which is under 38 degrees, and the more famous by being the birth-place of Na^arradyn that great Mathematician Tranflator and Commentator upon Buclide, whofe Works were lately printed at Rome in Arabiekj Sarchas^Gelackjind others, terminated by Nycaphtac, which fprings out of the Sariphxan Hill, that is part of Imaus.

More North and North-eaft the Scythians beyond Imaus inhabite v by fomefaid to be under the great Champs Dominions: hut Chams or Kawns rather, there are many. Of old it was called Regio Serica, by realbn of the abundance of Silk and the excellent Manufacture in Tapiftry and Carpetting there found, which fpread their fame into the moft remote parts of the llniverfe. This Silk and delicate Wool gave Sydo* nius Apollinaris occafion for that Monoftick, AJJyrius gemmas, Ser seller a, &amp;c. and to Ter- tidlian of Sera nerent, Bahylonii intexeirint, and Tzetza of Seres texuras pulcherrimas Una operiantur, &amp;c.

A Name neverthelefs mentioned by Strabo,whofe Oriental limit is the Ocean.

For my part, I conceive we are in a deep ignorance as to the truth of thofe places, as I have already hinted •, thofe nearer Regions which interpofe 'twixt Zagathai and Loyy and the North part of China being to us, nay to the civilized Inhabitants about Kabul and Candahor little known j other than that the Tartars neighbour the Chinese to the North and North- eall, as the Sea does to the South, and to the Weft the Barman or Bracman: So as I may truly fay with Mercatbr in his Geogr. Table of Tartary, Qui* enim vafium Hind &amp; incognu mm Regnum, v ere deferih it ? For that of Ahnlfeda the great Arabian Ofmographer it no new difcovery, but what we eafdy believe, How that the Ocean runs far beyond China from the Eaft towards the North •, but that it circles Weil about the North coaft of Ruffians he fays,) and takes its courfe about Lapland, and that the Sea fetches a com- pafs about the Eaft and North-eaft parts of Afia and Europe, I know he has it onely by fpeculation : Which neverthelefs may ferve as a fpur to encourage the further difco very of a North-eaft or North-weft paifage towards China and the Eaft Indies.

But fearing this fubjed has made me wander too far, I fliall prefent the Reader only with the habit of fome of them as I took it: And conclude with that of an ancient Writer, Hocfcito certe m Ah Sacx acq, romau, &amp; qm propne Scytht, &amp; qmcm r ,fimma gem beytha, Seytharum nomine, &amp;c.Alhors. Now concemmg Tanrm 9 if we were to give that Mountain the feveral Names it bears in the different Countries it runs through, varying indeed according to their fundry Idioms, it would be endlefs ; I fhali therefore content my feif in taking notice of that part thereof which carpe in our way, and by the Natives is called Albors\ a Mountain of great fame, if not infamous rather by reafon of that Pyree of Idol-fire, which (if Tradition may be credited ) has continued un-extinguiflied for full fifty generations. Of which place Straho fpeaks in his lib. 15. Procopm alfo lib. 2. and Benjamin hen-Jmas m his Journal. The Fane was round, typing out Eternity. In the midft an Altar was raifed five fteps from the ground, under which within a trench the Fire was placed. The fmall round top of this Pyree was open, the better to let in the Air which is the Soul of Fire. But this Fire (if they may be believed ) was not like our focalis imis fed with Wood, Coal, Turf or like common combultibles; but ( as they gave out) a flame fo pure and rarified as came neareft to thofe Celeftial Bodies which the Stoicks fay be real Fires. And as the Element of Fire is fuppofed to refemble thofe Ignes aterni or Veftal Fires which Virgil mentions in his 2 lib. ^£n. fo thefe have a Cabala that Zertoofi was their firft inftruder in that Idolatry: But 'tis probable that Zoroafler is the fame, the name not varying much *, for his opinion it -was,That Fire was molt worthy Divine efteem feeing that Omnia ex mo Igne funt genita. The Sun and Moon are heavenly Fires, whence their Idol-Fire was by them term'd Mythra. And this their God has fingular proper ties .• for.

From whence we may conclude, That as the Devil is reftlefs in his labours to form his Worlhip afterthe bell pattern*, fo the original of this was probably either in allufion to theTypesof the Ceremonial Law of the Jews as recorded in Levit. chap. 9. verf. 24. or elfe in imitati on of that fire which for a Divine end Mo[es in Levit. chap. 6. verf. 13 • commanded ihould neither be extinguiflied nor profaned: and for prefervation whereof, when the Jews, were led captives into Tcrfia, the Priefts took fire from the Altar and hid it privily in a dry and hollow pit which many years after was by Nehemah's diredion at his return from Pcrfia to the holy Land drawn out ^ and though at firlfc fight it appeared like thick water, yet therewith fprinkling the Wood that was upon the Altar, and the Sun at that time refleding his beams, it became a great fire quickly and confumed the facrifice. 2 Mace. 1. 19. So as by this word Fire , whereout Zoroafter would have all things produced, God was queftionlefs intended according to Dent. 3. 24. and Heb. 12. 29. where God is called a cwfitmng fire. So as of Fire we may fay what Plato (the Divine Philofopher) doth of Light, Eft Vmbra Dei: Dens vero eft Lumen In- minis. To which I may add this truth, that Totins rerum Natwra Caufa &amp; Origo eft Dens. In thefe Pyrese fometimes they not only immolated their Children,'but men of more years than difcretion.

From which Gymnofophifts the Cowers and Perfees differ but littleat this day concerning that Tenet. Furthermore, upon this high Mountain it is (fay the inhabitants) that Ptfchyton eldeft Son to Guftafp (who in Jacobs days ruled Perfta) is (in potentianon moriendi ex Hypotheft) endowed with power of not dying, with thirty other immortal Chyrons who by Zertoofts doom are to continue there till Doomf-day *, fo as if any could find the place,they may(m another fence)if thieves meet them be likewife made immortal. Here alfo upon Qyeqmts high hill are fome reliquesof the furious Gyantefs Lamafaque and of Arneofl her husband a Gyant of monftrous ihape and proportion: How many cubits he was high is incredible; but armed (as the Perjians fabuloufly report) with two horns as big as the tusks of an Elephant *, his eyes alfo were proportionably big, and his tail was like to a Cows: but in fight he was as powerful as Hercules. This great Thief and his Wife were neverthelels both flain by Ham-jha-Honcoir, fuch another Souldier as was Szmt Roman at Rohan. But leaving thefe, let me draw your eyes to our enfuing journey. After many laborious fteps we got to a Village called Ryna, twelve miles fhort otDamoan, where we beheld a Caftle, fo built upon the beib advantagesof Art and Na ture that to us it feemed impregnable : For above, it wanted no ground either for peace or War i It had fweet gardens adorned with fruits aud flowers, made happy in a Rlvolet of pure water which fprings there, and thence delightfully ftreams in many meanders into the bottome *, but both by its fcituation and defcription may be that of which Procopius writes, Coeli &amp; aquarum falubritate praftat. In this place (zszPerftan of quality travelling in our company told us) not above five and twenty years ago lived Meleck^ Bahaman, who commanded many hills and dales in Gelac!^ and Taurus, a Prince albeit confined to the middle region, neverthelefs forced with coft and care to uphold his dignity both againft Tmar and Perftan his great and quarrelfome neighbours: wherein fuch was his good fortune, and fuch the mutual love 'twixthim and his fubjeds, that though often invaded he Itood fecure , yea, lived to obferve the ruine of many his emulous neighbours, his aim only tending to preferve what his predeceifors had made him heir unto, and that his gray hairs might go in peace unto an eternal dormitory. Thus thought Bahaman-, who alfo added his endeavours to compleathis thoughts. But Abbas returning from the conqueft of Moz^endxam (having forced Son of Abdalla-cawn to become his penfioner) unhappily looking up towards this part of Taurus which feemed to threaten him, refolves to be no longer bearded'3 Melee Bahaman. Ttyna. ip 9 bearded by that mountainous King-, but according to that Motto of Tacitm, Id *qmm quoJvalidiM, pretends that from his lofty dwelling he ufually pried into his two Kins- domes of Media and Moz.endram, by that having the advantage to ranfack his Towns rob his Carravans, illure his Worms, anticipate his progrefs to the Cafpan Sea, and to divert many Rivers into other fources, winch fpringing from Tanrm Itreamed into Hyrcania and Shervan-, and without whofe fource thofe Provinces would become barren if not ufelefs. Melecl^ Bahaman readily finds his drifts and comparing him with that fable of the Wolf, who drinking at the fpring-head, quarrelled with the Lamb for troubling his draught when he was quenching his .thirft at theftream below, premedi tates what anfwer to return : Whiles Abbas in an impatient delay refolves to try the chance of War, appointing Methiculibeg to profecute his defign, and not return with out vidory. This could not be fo fecretly intended but aged Bahaman had intelligence. Atfirft it troubled him, in that his gray hairs were morepropenfe to eafe than War : Yet, left his fubjeds from his example might be difcouraged he throws away all dull thoughts and as a common father provides for fafety with Arms and Viduals furnilhing his Cittadel for many years fiege-, yea, omitting nothing that might intitJehim a careful and expert Souldier. In each defenfive place he plants a Garrifon, and other parts lays naked where the enemy might comethat in nothing the Countrey might relieve the Per pan. That done, he mews himfelf, his Queen, his two Sons, and ten thoufnad feled men iii his Caftle *, in that pofture not fearing any thing they could attempt. The Perfian General in the mean time with thirty thoufand men march againft him • and at their firft afcent find the way dangerous by thofe many fhowers of Darts and ftones he thundred on them: they fir ft grumbled, and then would have tumbled down, had not Methkiilibeg by promifes and threats encouraged, expofing his own head in the front of danger *, fo as after fome skirmiihes he laid clofe fiege to the Caftle, where he was told the King and vidory was included. Having well viewed this inacceffible Fortrefs, he defpaired of taking it *, fuch was the height thereof, and fuchthe perpendicular af' cent, two excellent defences Art and Nature had enriched it with. Neverthelefs, fome attempts he made, but invalidable : to Ihoot their Arrows at it, was one with aiming at the iMoon ; Small (hot they had, and Lances good ftore ^ but of fmall force to bat ter Rocks. So that after many tedious aflaults and bravadoes (wherein the Perfian had ftones in requital,) the General well knowing. That what ftrength was not able to do Ingenuity as the moft forcible Engine oft effeds, he beat a parley, and with many pro- teftations affiired them of friendfhip: Yea that he might the better lhadow pretended truth, prefents the aged King with Tulipants, Shamfheers, Pearls, and other gilded baits mean enough to angle for a Kingdom *, intreating him withal to defcend and tafte a ban quet *, folemnly fwearing by Mortis-Ally, the head of Shaw-Abbas, Paradife, the eight Orbs, and other ufual proteftations, that he fhould come and go with fafety ^ no other reafon inducing this invitation but a hearty good will he bore him, and from the hopes he had of coming to fome agreement. The peaceful King, un ufed to deceit and wars rotten ftratagems, fwallows the tempting hook, and believes all for truth ^ albeit his Wife and Sons diffwade, giving him inftances of like diffimulation: Credulity is rather a fault than an offence, feeing it-hurts none but it felf; yet here is proved other- wife. Neither thofe, nor the tears his men fhed to beg his ftay vowing their conftancy to the laft, could avert his deftiny: Neceflity being governed neither by Law nor power .• So down he goes without hoftages, where he finds the Crocodile ready to embrace him with tears of joy : but after a fhort banquet, gives him an iron bed , regarding neither vow, honour, nor ingagement; fo as Bahaman now too late repents his dotage. The Perfian General alfo thinks all his own, and therefore fends his Sons a meffage of in- treaty but upon a Ipears point, the lubftance being, That if they wifhed their Fathers lafety,they fhould come down and have his word engaged for thek fafe return *, otherwife, he would fhew the old man no mercy. .Nature inriches man with reafon, but Time with knowledge and experience. Hence, the two gallant youths, regardlefs of the rodomontadoes of that treacherous Enemy, make this anfwerThey would believe he was a man of honour and honefty, when ac cording to promife he gave the King their Father his liberty; otherwife he might ac count them Ideots, breach of faith to their Father being fo notorious ; and that from equal reafon he might demand the Caftle and Crown, as them by whom thofe were pre- ferved. Adding withal. That the King of Perfia's ill-grounded ambition would never prolper : For, though he had craftily avoided the Epithete of a Tyrant, this would rub afrefli his former injuftice, yea, anatomize him fo as all Afia would efteem him ignoble iMelee Bahaman and mo murthered, — T it , „ ll( i fax himofdifhonourable avarice, who commanding over many yea, the « ta x mm o contented w . thout the fubj ing a Natio ^ large and fru ! tf ''^''n^uing a King whofe predeceflbrs had in a larger feries airs *.

For when thefe three were fmiling in a mutual confent of love, the General gives the figrr- fo as at one inftant three Codfclhajhes with their Hi eing Scemiters whipt off their heads, all three at one inftant being made immortal: And e're this villany was divulged they made themfelves mafters of the Caftle, fome recei ving quarter, otherfome deftrudion. By that wretched policy this late thought indo mitable place and Nation was fubjeded. Such was the miferable end of Melee Bahamn and his two hopeful Sons forgetful of Wars fubtiltiesand how Aladeule their neighbour King of the Black Mountain, for playing faft and loofe with Selim firft Emperour of the Tarqs by equal credulity gave a like iifue to his Life and Kingdom. Oppofite to this Gaftle is ereded the Sepulcher of Bahamarfs beloved Queen, in the high-way as we pafled : 'tis of four equilaterals raifed above eight yards high, the material ftone well fquared, and very apparent and comely. The land here was well wooded *, for in old times hereabouts grew many lofty Trees, which are rare now in thefe high places ^ fuch as induced the noble Poet Luc an in his 3- to remember them. Deferitur Tamiq-, nemus. Then Taitrus lofty Woodforfaken was. A long mile from this Sepulcher and higher up into the air is the high peak of Da- moan j by Strabo in his 11. lib. called Jafonia, whofe top (ftiaped like a Pyramid ) fur- mounts as fome think all other parts of Taurm: up which defatigating Hill neverthelefs we crambled but with difficulty, and from whence we had an unlimited Horizon: For weThe Highpea^ Damoan. zoi w e could difcover thence the Cajpian Sea, albeit eightfcore miles diftant,and not fo mif- takenly as Jkxandeir, who upon the profped judged it to be fome out-breaking of Pa- y Meotis. Above it is compofed of fulphur, which caufes it to fparkle each night like ^£tna *, a pleafant objed to the eye, but fo offenfive to the fmell that it requires a nofegay of Garlick in the afcending. Hence moft parts of Terfia and Chaldaa has their Brim- ftone. The re^fon why we rode up, was out of curiofity to fee the Baths fo generally reforted to; tlie Springs in this Bath are fome hot fome cold, yet riling out of the fame Mountain: Three of them are more private than the reft, being compaifed with Walls of ftone; the other two are open ^ the firft be for thofe of Quality, the other more common; And hither in Angufi difeafed People flock apace in very great multitudes, who receive notable cures from thofe Waters, which by their great Vertue and medi cinal heatdefervedly draw thither that concourfe of People, not from feveral parts of ferfm onely,but more remote Gountreys. The Earth is by Philofophers called JElementum. fimdijfirntimy cold and moift •, albeit in fome places by reafon of Minerals it be ficcijfu mm and of a combuftible quality. For, Napka and others of a bituminous fubftance ar e without doubt the efficient caufe of hot Springs (fuch as thefe here be) and alfo of fubterranean fires, as Experience teaches. Thefe hot Baths queftionlefs receive their vertue from the Mineral veins through which they pafs: but what fort of Minerals the Water has either its heat or tindure from&gt; (whether from Sulphur, Vitriol, Steel, or the like ? ) our fhort ftay would not difcover *, and I could learn little of the People/or they were ignorant. The Earth (faith Arifiotle lib. de Mundo) hath within it not onely Fountains of Water, but alfo of Spirit and of Fire, fome of which flow like Water: whence it comes, that the Water it ejeds is fometimes fcalding hot, and at other times lukewarm and temperate.

Whence it is that the Jews who in great numbers inhabit hereabouts ( ha ving as they report been feated there ever fince that memorable tranlplantation from Canaan by Salmanaffer A. 3/.'3220. mentioned 2 Reg. 17.6.) Ipare not to averr (but from a Gabala or received Tradition from their Anceftors,) that upon this Mountain of Damoan NoaWs Ark refted. About the place where the Ark relted hath been no fmallcontefl among Waiters: fo as to my apprehenfion that high place has been fo clouded or deprelfed through variety of conjedures, that it will be a labour of fome difficulty to difcover it. Ben-Jonas places it near the River Tigris, where it Iprings not far from the Gordian Mountains: Inter Armenios &amp; G ordiaos in monte Lubaro c onfedit Area Noha, fays Epiphanius. And in regard there is a Mountain called Ariarathis in the lefler Armenia, fome would fix it in that Region : Neverthelefs the moft received opinion is, That the Ark after that univerfal Deluge refted in Armenia the greater v for in Gen. 8.4. we read that the Ark ftay ? d upon the Mountains of Ararat ; which word fonie in terpret Armenia: and running currant with moft,probably gave occafion to the Poet Ara- tiu in his fourth Book to fay, Armenia, celfis inflabat montibus Area. Bocatim and Haythori the Armenian are no lefs pofitive J that In toto Orbe Terr arum 'mn eft mons altior quam Arath, Dd cupU lit ■ till m. Noah'x Ar\. cum in cacumine Area Not poft diluvium fletit. But where this Ararat was has not a little been controverted by Divines and Geographers of the greateft rank. For by Ararat moft agree is underftood Caucafa and Taurus, which for length and height is reputed the greateft Mountain in the World *, ftretching from the moft Northerly part of Ar. menia as far as India, until it be affronted by Imam, which in a contrary courfe divides Scythia: all which trad or ledge of Hills is ufually comprehended under thefe three names Ararat, Tdverm and Camafa, which for the greater half feem to environ the ^Mare Calhmm. Neverthelefs, the names of thefe three imperious Hills are loft in many places through length of time and the feveral Idioms of fpeech, which vary according to the different Dialed of thefundry Kingdoms and Provinces they pierce through. As fo? example, wherev4r^f rifes in^m^,there the moft culminating pyco or top is common ly called Baris and Suharis', which in the Copique fignifies a Ship: Ingens mom Bar is eft f H . per Mmiadem, fays Damajcen. And is either a Province in Armenia neighbouring Ara rat, as we find mentioned in the 51 of Jeremy 27. or is Armenia by leaving out the Ar, ter Afhtrefin, as Htfpania for Syania, and as we might obferve in feveral other pla. ces, for example. This is part of that we properly call the Gordiaan Hills which fome name Kardn. In Media At r of at i a it multiplies into the Coraxi, out of which Araxis fprings, Mofchici, Pariedri and Baronta. Where it crolfes the moft Northerly part of Parthia neareft Media, Cajpii, Jafonii, ZagrU, Gada. Paifing through HyrcanU it bears the names of Sariphi, Coatri famous for trees of marvellous height, v£thera tangentes fylvas liquere Choatra, Plm. lih. 6. c. 7. Orontes, Coronii, Acrocerami, by which lait the Greeks fometimes comprehend the whole Province. Through Aria and Paropamifa 'tis called Heniochi, Pharphariada, Bomarai, Mandradani, Gajfarii, Oxiatri, vicinating the Ri ver O^and then Caucafus,where the Scytho-Saca live in view of Imam ; all which multipli cations are comprized in the firft three: whence it is that the queft is fo obfeure ■, Tau rus, Cane a fits and Ararat being indeed one and the fame Hill; For Caucasus eft parsTam] &amp; mm Tanrm Caucafi nomine intelligi debet, faith Philofiratm in his i.hb. With goodcon- fideration therefore that glory of our Nation for Learning Sir Walter Raleigh in his Map placed fol. 108 gives thofe names of Ararat, Tanrm and Caucafm promifcuoufly to the whole Hill in its full extent from Armenia to Mergiana. So that albeit we read in Ben- fm lib. 2. That In vertice GordUi montis Noe quievit pofl diluvium: Noem tamen Seytha omnium deorum ma jorum &amp; minor um Patrem appellaverunt, &amp; humana Gent is author em &amp; Chaos &amp; femen mundi agmfcant. Tyteam vero Vxorem e]m Antiam vocant, in quam femen Chaos pofuit, &amp; ex qua tanquam ex Terra cunBi homines prodierant, &amp;c. Yet Annim, G oto- pm and others fix the Ark in that part of Mergiana that joyns to Hyrcania where it views Scythia: And not without reafon, feeing fome of the moft learned in this fort of curio- fity judge that the firft feminary after Noah's defcent from the Ark was in Mergiana, a luxuriant foil fitted for Grapes and what clfe might encourage his Plantation: where as we find in Ptol.feptima Tabula Afa is the City Nyfea or JSfoyfea in 41 degrees either built by Noah or to his memory: and for the Clime, none fitter for Grapes Amoenita- tisadeo inclytay ut in ea Vitem invenire (inquit Strabo) cu\mflip it em duorum hominum vix Vina compleHantur: racemum vero duorum cubit or um orb em implere. Which being Ihewed Alexander the Great he admired, and thereupon there built Alexandria *, and fo the Scythians branching from the firft feminary are properly called Gens femper Antiquifma, and pre^ ferred before the Phrygian and Egyptian in their claim concerning Antiquity. Befides, from the concihmty of Name and tradition that Bacchm here lived it had the name of Nyfca, which fbme Keverthelefs fuppofe to be Agra, a City built upon a branch of Ganges, and otherfome fay took its denomination from Nyja Bacchm his Nurfe which with Jupiters gave the name of Dionyfisus, to whofe memory a City alfo was built in Media of great efteem for breed of Horfe; and another in Mergiana near the River Hydajpes a branch of Indus remembred by Lucan in his 6. lib. Et qua Nyfaus Hydafies, &amp;c. From that analogy or refemblance of Nyfea and Noyfya, of Noacchus and Boacchus, and the delight both took in Vine-planting, it has induced Goropius with others to fancy that they were one, and in India both of fame at this day : the rather in regard Noah made not his peregrination with Nimrod and his party who fetled in the Vale of Shi- naar at the confufion of Tongues: For ILlam ( Sem\ Son ) returned the way he came from Noah, and feated himfelf 'mPerJia', but Oper and Havilah ( Sons of travelled further Eaft, firft to Lahore, and after into Bengala, where^ and at and about Malacca 'tis found they fixed their Plantation, the Places retaining their Names to many defend ing generations, as I fhall have oecafion in due place to fpeak of more at large ; by which and much more I might obferve, 'tis apparent that Opinions differ concern ing the place where the Ark refted •, give me leave therefore to offer my own uponupon this ^report of the Jem inhabiting at and about Damoan, that this was the place. fidlyGoropim and others are fo far from agreeing with Haythotiy That Ararat is in Arme* ma rather than any other place where the Mountain uninterruptedly runs as .far as'^^j- anay (Eafterly to the CafpanSzz. as Strabo and moft Geographers place it, albeit miltaken in making it part ofTartaryy and yet Ptoiomy in his fifth Table of ^4fia places it between Media and Armenia^ which I marvel at J )and may properly bear that name, That he inclines rather to fix it in the molt Southerly part of Scythia ^ which I think too far ftretcht; and rather agree with St. HieromeyThat Ararat is not only a hill ftridly fo called,but in a larger iignification a champaign Country near which Araxis runs, (over which, albeit lib. 8. ALneid. fayes Araxit fcorns a Bridge, Alexander and Cafar built two) not far diftant from the foot otTaurm ; which defcription brings it very near Damoan. Elmacin alfo in his firit Book relates how that the Emperour Heradim purfuing Chozjrhoe the Parthian King into Hyrcania was by fome then in the Army fhewed a high hill which they called Geudi, upon which they perfwaded him the Ark relted •, which Geudi fays the Author was near unto a Villa at that time called Themain : a name differing not much from Damoan, the (D) and (Th) being fometimes alike pronounced. Geography Nubienfts hath alio fome concordance with it, faying Mons Jemanin in qua requievit Navis Nohx, legi debet The- manin: which name upon this occafion fundry 6*^^ Writers commemorate faith Agaihias. Furthermore, Vulcanm in his 4 lib. gives us this further teftimony. That upon the high Mountain Taman Noahs Ark relied: ft name little difcrepant from what Damoan is now called, the various Dialeds of Speech in many places occafioning a greater difference •, and for proof may note the different pronunciation of London^ Tredaghy and Antwerp by our tranimarine neighbours. Nor does that of Procopim upon Gene/is weaken but rather fortifiethismy conjedure infaying that Ararat excurrit in medium inter Armenian &amp; Parthiam verfus Adiabenam ad aquilonemy nonad orientem Babylon ; feeing that Damoans fcituation is 'twixt Armenia and Parthia. Being alfo more ftrengthened from that of the Commentator upon Berofm, who perfwades his Reader that the Ark refted upon thofe Cafpian hills that feparate Armenia from Media : Which defcription as with a finger to my apprehenfion direds unto this Mountain of Damoan. But having peradventure prefumed too far upon this fuppofition, I leave the difquifition to a more accurate obferver: and onely take leave to acquaint you with what the Jews here-about inhabiting report; How that part of the idolatrous Tribes of Dan, Zebulony After, and Naphthali were by Salmanajfer commanded to abide intheie parts •, Tiglathpille^ar the Aflyrian Monarch having tranfplanted the half Tribe of Managesy Rheubenznd Gad to Jaaroon and other places within this Kingdom of Larry as I have already obferved. The Inhabitants of Damafcm alfo were removed by that great Prince to Kyr in Media, 2 Reg. 16. 9. about the River Cyrm, which is fo pro nounced •, but the Chuthites were removed to Samaria in the place of thofe Jews, 4 Reg. 17. which Chuthites (as 1 gather from fofephw in his 9 lib.) were inhabitants of this Region, at that time called by the name of Chutha y by which word fome miftakenly have, under- ftood whole Perfia albeit more likely to be Chuthifian as Sufiana is oft-times called a Countrey extending from Larr Weftward as far as the Altars of Hercules, the utmofl Cities of which were Apamaa and Ctefiphon. And albeit Gihon be a general name for great Rivers, nothing indeed has more puzzled Scholars than to find where Gozan run : For although Ptoiomy make it (if it be that Gonana he mentiones in his 6 lib. 16 cap.) a branch of Oxus *, yet forafmuch as at Hara which fome erronioufly take for Chara or Cha- ran in Mesopotamia where the Patriarch Abraham fometimes dwelt, and HaU and Ghahor are Cities in Media as recorded in the 2 Reg. cap. 18. verf. 1 1. near the River Goaan^ it is not probable to be that Gonan which mixes with Oxm, iince no part of Media is within three hundred miles of it. Go^an then either mufl be in Media, which maybe feeing that Araxis waters Armenia and runs into the Weft fide of the Cafpian Sea ^ or elfe this River here which is of a great breadth, ftreaming from Taurm both into Media and Hyrcaniay and cut in many fmall Rivoletsby the People to draw her many ways to ferve their occafions. And the Jews inhabiting here confirm this conjedure, faying alfo, That when they were brought hither captives they were difperfed into many feveral places, and here have refted unremoved during many overtures and changes of the Perfian Mo narchy. Moreover, albeit the Jfraelites had for the extent of their Dominion what was from the Red-Sea or Wildernefs of Syn to the River of Euphrates and the great Sea, as the Mediterranean is called Exod. 16. 1. and fojh. 1. 4. which was accomplifhed in Davids Reisn: vet the Territory they inhabited ftridly called Judah and the portion of the Dd 2 twelve—— Tranfplanted fem twelve Tribes, was but fiiiall in comparifon, fcarce amounting to the third part ot France. So as wonderful.it is to confider what increafe they had, both by what we read upon num- bring the People by foah, and the force they brought when Afa out of the two Tribes of Judah^nd Benjamin drew into the field againft Zerah the Ethiopian 580000 men. As alfo by what Jofephm writes were aflembled in Jernfakm when befieged by Fefpafian and his Son. Yet fince they were baniflied their own Country they have not fince either had King, High-Prieft, Countrey or Town they could call theirs : but like Vagabonds live fcattered over the Face of the whole Earth: So as they who once were the chofen People of God, and in confideration of whom all others were of no efteem for fandity, whole dread was to be upon all the Inhabitants under Heaven, whofe fame fhould make the Univerfe to tremble whiles they obeyed the Lordfor their Apoftafie and Idolatry are now rejeded, and that dreadful Prophecy of Jer. 24. 9. purfuant to that curfe of Mofts pronounced Dent. chap. 23. verf. 37. and of Ezek^ chap. 5. verf. 15. where God threatens to deliver them to be removed into all the Kingdoms of the Earth to their hurt, to be a reproach and a proverb, a by-word and a curfe in all places whither he would drive them, to the full extent we fee accompli/hed. For indeed, not only what the Chriftians retort them for their hatred to Chriil, the Prophets and Apoilles ^ the very Heathen accufed them as MWydpaww or enemies of Mankind, towards whom they bore an irreconcileable hatred fay Diod. Siculm and Tacitm I. 5. being of all Nations the worft, Amian. de Marco Imp. and as people that of old time moved Tedition, Jizr. 4. 15. info- much as they were termed Foetentes , &amp; vel fortmtworum occtrrfam oculis horrehant, animo perfequebanmr, men avoiding the very fight of them if by chance they met them. And though 1 am perfwaded (by what I have feen) they are at this day the moft numerous of any one People in the world were they drawn together into a body yet being difperft, they appear asifthey were but few. Further, albeit when they were in the promifed Land, of all others they were the moft prone to Idolatry, even when they had light and all the whole World befides fat clouded in darknefs yet being now under captivity and fevere fubjedion where-ever they inhabit, they keep ftridlyto the Tradition of their Anceftors, reading the Pentateuch, and abhorring Idols^ So that though by reafon of the curleafore-mentionedand their unbounded avarice they be the moft contemned people upon the earth yet by us are to be pitied, being the off-fpring of Abraham the Friend of God - , and forafinuch as that in Ij'aiah 14. 3. 'tis promifed the Lord will in the end give them reft from their forrow,and from their fear, and from their hard bondage. For as Dent. 30.4. albeit they fhould be caft out even to the ends of the earth, yet from thence wili the Lord gather them, and bring them into their own Land, the Land which their fore-fathers poflelled. With which agrees 32.37. That he will gather them out ofall the Countreys wherein he hath fcattered them in his indignation, and return them to their own land, where he will caufe them to dwell in fafety. Which fome think will be accomplifhed at their converfion and not before : according to that of Zeoha- mchap. 12. verf. 10. They fhalllook upon him whom they have pierced, and fliall exprefs their repentance by lamenting for him as one mourneth for his onely fon; for m that day the Lord will oppofe himfelf againft all Nations that lhall come againft mjakm. In the mean time (^with grief be it fpoken) we find tkem every where, in a moft obdurate condition. But to return. Eaft of Damoans high peak is a Town callediVoi;^, in which were about a hundred ramines. A young man Son to Hodge Snare or Ajhuerm (the Perfian Merchant that died m London Anno Dom. 1625. and Brother to Mahomet whom we buried at Sea) hearing o our palling by, came out accompanied with feveral of his friends and kindred to invite us to his houfe which was about a mile thence: He was apparelled in a robe of Cloth of Gold, had upon his head a Tulipant of Silk, and was gallantly mounted. His Mem was good, fo was his Civility: prevailing with the Ambalfadour to go a little out 01 his way to accept a Collation, luch as the Countrey and fmall warning could a ? 7 / 11 was ^ lth chearfulnefs as gave his Lordfhip and reft of the Company good is action. Thence we halted towards Damoan : where as we deftended down a fteep 7a Af k Tent I)itched ina Pleafant place near the Road,filled with above irty Women a ^Men, who at firft I thought were folemnizing their Boalia and Parana- u a ^dmg. Staying there a while we faw the Bride, about ten years o age, ut the Groom was thirty. Many Bride-maids came out to admire us, whom a . s wondered at: for their faces, hands and feet were upon that folemn occafion rW % ^ J 31710 ?? wlt ^ beafts, caftles and flowers*, their arms and legs ^^with mamho s or voluntary bracelets, or rather fetters of Brafs and Silver, which eir Monfco made them appear not unlike the Arcadian Shepherdeffes as defcribed in Roman-'Damoan. M zo Romances. Having prefented them with a fmall offering we left them, that night making Damoan our manzeil. Damoariy v/hether it be the relidt ofGhabor or Halah is uncertain: but by the Jews, in thefe parts called Jehudsy their long captivity and abode here, feems to be one of them. And that the ^45 and the Cuthai were tranfplanted by order of the Affyrian Monarch into Samaria hom thefe parts is imagined : It is a Town of good repute amongit the Terfians : fome write it Damawan, but I took it according to their pronunciation. Xne North Pole is there elevated fix and thirty degrees, twenty minutes; and longitude is eighty eight. It is included by a skirt of Taurm^ in the Kahoncharion Province (part oiGhelack^) and this was the limit of Mediato the North. In old times here Uvea the Tarafitacena, mountaineers mentioned by Straho in his n. and Herodotm in his i lib. A Town pretty well watered it is, for a branch of Go^rn refrellies her. Ben-Jonas (whofe Travels Arias Montanm had a good opinion of) draws this GownzW over the Per fan Do minion, where-ever any Jews were planted: but erronioufly, for it is reftridive. Da- is peopled molt part with Jwj, who in this place are two hundred Families. The Buzzar is built aloft, and fcarce worth the climbing to, except it be to buy wine and fruit which is had here in plenty and at eafie prices. Two days we ftayed in Damoan to re create our wearied bodies ^ but on the thirteenth of June we departed, and that day rode to Bomaheem five and twenty miles from Damoan' And now we are in Media, a word of her. Media (faith Polybiw) is fcituated in the center of the greater Afia? accounted a rich and noble Countrey. The fiditious Greeks perfwade that it takes its name from Medw Son of Jaf&amp;n and Medea-, (^^un fortunate Daughter. More certain it is that the name is derived from Madai Japhets third Son, Son of Noah) for the Medes and Perfians before Cyrm his time in Scripture as well as profane Stories are ever called Madai or Medi and Elamita. By the Greeks fometimes you find them called Har&lt;s from a City and River there *, by the Arabs Aigehal, by reafon it was hilly. And note-worthy it is Yi\s2X. Mela lib. 4. c. 1. oblerves concerning the defcent of the Medes from the Sarmatian , (from whence the Saxons alfo j) Madai (faith he) a Sarmatis. Sarmata Medomm fmt foboles. Sermo enim his inter Scythicwn &amp; Medum ex mroq\ miftm, &amp;c. And from thence as Trojms Pomp. lib. 41. 'ine Sarmati are called Sarmadai : a pretty conjedure. It was anciently divided into two, viz.. major &amp; minor : the minor was Atropatia, ( Trap at an a in Ptolemy, Atropatma in Pliny, from A- tropatm one of Alexanders Captains ) and Media major or Az,arka x at this day Sheervan i. e. milky plain where Ecbatan the Metropolis once ftood. ? Tis divided into Gheylan (GheyU in Ptolomy, Caditfia in Pliny,) Deylan, Vaa^-pra- can and Theucan, thole are Atropatia ; in which we might include part of Armenia, Jelphy or Chidfd being there feated, and Nafllvan (Art ax at a of old J Sheirvan has Aderbayon, Harran, Sultania, and Tabrizjan?. whichi are in Media minor. To the North it has Mount Tawrm, Part hi a to the South, Battria confines it Eaft, and on the Weil it has the greater Armenia and part of Aftyria. Panamas errs in calling this Aria. A rich and puiirant Countrey it was in the worlds infancy: but whether by the confuming hand of War, or Gods Juftice in revenge of fo many holy Chriftians that Chozroe malfacred, 1 cannot lay ■, but now it is a barren and milerable foil, compared with the Phoenix of Hies great Britain', who all things confidered equals the bell compaded pleafuresof thefe Afiatic Provinces: Neyerthelefs, it has been fruitful you may fay, if Pope Pirn the fecond took his information right out of Sfrabo, as that an Hippobotos or Horfe- pafturehere fhouldnourilh fifty thoufand breeders : of which the Nyfasan race was molt of price ^ fo called from the City Nifa, one ofBacchm his Towns which Hydajpes water ed*, and concerning which Luc an lib. 6. has this remembrance. Qua rapidus Ganges &amp; qua Nyfem Hydafpes Accedunt pelago. The Courfe of which River is much controverted, fome placing it in AJfyria, others in Media, but Plutarch rightly in India, apud omnes fat is conflat Hydafien, fitmum India non Media, &amp;c. being indeed a Branch of the River Indm. Here alio Alexandropolis was founded by Alexander, of which at this day nothing re mains. And albeit by the report of Writers this Country was then verdant and paftu- rable; yet little grafs is to be found at this day, not only here, but over moft part of the Perjian Monarchy, fave in Valleys and where Rivers are: But in Head thereof Camels abound, who make a Ihift to live even in Sandy Defarts, and crop the boughs of trees or fhrubs which rarely they meet with. The Dromedary and it are of one defcent, but vary according to the Countrey they breed in: In Baftria and Perfia they have but one gib or bunch, the being oft-times double. InGefner's Hiftory of Quadrupedes the Gyraff is alfo mentioned.

The air is temperate in the morning and towards Sun-fetj but in the Sun s meridian we found it very hot. The Houfes are of white bricks hardned by the Sun. The City has about three thoufand Honfes; of which the Duke's and the are the faireft ■, yet neither to be admired. The Market is divided into two i fome part thereof is open, and other part arched: A Rivolet in two branches itreams through the Town, ferving withal both Groves and Gardens,who for fuch a favour return a thankful tribute to the Gardiner. Adioyning the City, the King has a very large Garden fenced with a high Wall of mud, no lefs in circuit than the City. The Houfe where we lodged over- topped all the reftfrom whofe L high Tarrafs (early one morning) I took a profpeft both of City and Countrey : 1 could perceive thence that moft of the Mafters of Fami- lies flept nightly with their Seraglio's upon the tops of their Houies^ which were Ipread with Carpets • fome (1 eafily perceived) had three,fome fix Women about them wrapp'd in Cambolines or fine linnen: but this curiofity ( or ralhnefs rather) had like to have cofu me dearly, the penalty being an Arrow into his brains that dares to do it*, which.but for the priviledge of the place and that I was in my own Countrey habit, had been exe cuted. The Carravans-lodge here for elegancy far exceeds the Mefchit: the Inhabi tants are pretty ftately, the Women lovely, and both curious in novelties *, but the jefl- loufie of the Men confines the temper of the weaker Sex*, yet by that little they adven tured at, we might fee Vetitis rehiu glifcit voluntas- Zenal-chan was Sultan of this City, a Man of little worth in our apprehenfion* For albeit he had been Ambafladour from Shaw-Abba* to Rodnlph the fecond the German Emperour, which no doubt intruded him in fome pundilio's of good breeding and expreffing of civilities to Strangers; never- thelefs, whether his late Employment, or his Favour with Jbbas, or his Wealth or ra ther his vexation for Nogdi-beg his Coufin; all or fome of thefe made him fo very dif- courteous, that albeit our Ambalfadour in civility fent to vifit him, he returned a fleight thanks without a re-vifit, which we thought barbarous. The Pole Ardtic is elevated in Tyroan thirty five degrees forty minutes ^ fourfcore in longitude. From Tyroan we tra velled to a Village called Charah, an inhofpitable place •, for it afforded us inftead of fuftenance, torment; fuch as the fcalding fand and frying Sun could operate: Never- thelefs in old times this has been of that repute as gave Name to the Cou;itrey round about it, fuch time it was called Kyr or C^but not that mentioned Amos 1. 5.

( miftaken in the Tan, a Gamma being printed erroneoufly for it) to be in Ajfyria, of Cedrenm and Haithon in Armenia-, of Chalcondyles in Perfia, of Niver in Per}-Armenia, and of Paulas Fenetm in Parthia ; what were thefe conjedures but taking rife from the Monarchique Titles of Ajfyrian, Armenian, or Parthian as they fwayed then, and the reft made Provinces butcniefly from the miftake how Armtnia was divided ; part of Armenia extending South from Araxis into Atropatia, Art ax at a being' the Metropolis, and from whence the Name P erf Armenia was compounded: which is not above 36 degrees though Ptolomy makes it 40. for by Ahulfeda, Vkghbeg and other Geographers of thofe parts, the latitude ofTaurys beft agrees with the Icituation of Ecbatan. Tabriz, then is a City both great and populous, famous for an in-land Trade , and fo well governed, that it is no terrour to fuch as repair to buy and fell there, for all it is a Garrifon. The fcituation is near the Mountain Orontes or rather Baronta, which is a part of Taurus. It is compaffed with a mud-wall five miles about: the Houfes after the common mode are flat at top *, their material Sun-dried bricks. The Buz.z.ar large, the Gardens lovely: That to the South-eaft was planted by King Tamas and much Ipoken of-, but the Turks Horfes have lately, grazed there. It hath but a fmall fupply of frefli Water ^ yet what it lacks in that, fire and flame fupply the Sun, Wars rage, and ci vil broils having more than fufficiently parched her. To .pafs by the revolutions of the Empire, the Turks firft paffagefix hundred Years lince, Tamberlanes rage and the like^ remember we onely thofe irreconcileable Fadions, the Envicaydarlai and Namidlai that for three hundred Years fo perfecuted one another with implacable wrath, as they en gaged in their quarrel nine other Provinces, who at length grew fo engaged amongil themfelves, that not onely this City but Media and Armenia became well-nigh depopu lated : the Gibelyns nor Rofes parties or fadions out-matching them: fo as in fine they. made an eafie entrance to any invader. Selym the Grand Seignior was the firit efpied it ^ and to become an eye-fore to Tamas Son of fomael their inveterate adverfary, fends a Bajhaw thither with an Army who ranfaked it An. Dom.15 14.

And An. 1530. feconded it with fo much fury that it flamed many dayes; the infatiate Turks pillaging without mercy, turning topiie-turvie all they met with, and into a Chaos thofe elaborate Walks and Gardens which Shaw-Tamas fo much delighted in. Reviving again, it again was made proftrate to Ebrahim Baffa's luxury, fent by Solyman at. the inftigation of Vlemm a Perfian Tray tor, albeit Brother-in-law to the King*: at which time An. 1534.

But An.i^S$.Heg. 965. it groaned under the greateft fuftering, when Ozman the wrathful Bajfa flave to A- murat the third fubduing it, perpetrated all manner of hoftile cruelty: till thirty Years after by that incomparable Prince Emyr-hamze-myrta ( elder Brother to Shaw-Abb as) it was re-gained, re-built, and fortified againft the future infolence of thofe Barbarians. For 'twixt this City and Ardaveil he gave the Turks a notable defeat: and after that, Abbas himfelf An. 1619. near the fame place did the like', which for the future has quieted it under the Perfian Government.

Th^ ground is good in which 'tis feated, and watered by a pretty River, foas it bears both Corn and Grapes in plenty: and though the place be level, it ifeverthelefs has a laree and delightful profped towards the North-weft; but of moil remark is a Fountain or Spring near the Town, which inftead of fweet Water fends forth a Stygian liquor, thick and clammy, both in colour and tafte refembling Tar and not unlike that bituminous liquid fubftance at Halt upon Euphrates, in the High-way as Travellers pafs from Bagdat to Aleppo : This onely is in much lefs quantity, and not put to like ufes. Taurls was the Royal Seat of feveral Kings, the laft of which wasObdolo~chawn&gt; who died and was here buried Art. Dom. 1^66. Heg. 946. leaving behind him a Son caWed Syrvan-Sha who finding liimfelf unable to fway a Scepter fo near to Abbas the Per/ian King, pru- dentially fubmitted his Royalty, and enrolled himfelf a Tributary Prince under his Em pire. Now albeit the City is commonly reputed of good defence, yet it was unable to keep out the Turkijh Army at fuch time as that old fretful wretch Maftapha with fire and Sword invaded thofe parts and turned moft of the Towns and Villages into aihes*, this place efpecially parching by the heat of his wrath, and the Inhabitants Mering under the edge of his mercilefs Sword, the heads of fo many of the befieged being up on the furrender whipt off as raifed a Monumental-pillar, which ferved as a Trophy to exprefs his lavage fancy. Next night we made our Manzeil at Sangurrabaut, a Town confiiling of an hundred Cottages. In this place we buried a civil Gentleman Mr. Welflit our Camarade and Countrey-man under a broad-fpreading Chenoar-tree, and fixed a brazen fcrole over him which fpake his Name and Nation. This was the utmofb we could do in that po- fture we were : Neverthelefs, Vt Te poftremo donarem mmere mortis, give me leave to add this Diftich to his memory. We have deplored thy death : ttfenfuirtg Tears Mors tua non careat fletu j linquamus Amicis Thy Kin will pay thee Tribute with their tears. Moerorem ut celebrent funcra cum lacbrymis. From Tabriz, we travel through Sultany to Cazhyn, the Hills Zagri and Coatri inter- poling. And, Next night flept in th? open Fields under a befpangled Canopy, the Firmament; the next in the King's Town, his Purgatory rather; if a confpiracy of loole and fcalding land, burning Sun, and mean Cottages could make one ^ for the Houfes there differ little in ihape or clofenefs from Ovens •, fo as the People all day bake them- felves in them in ftead of Caves and Grots, which ferve well to abate the extreme ar dour of the Sun: a People fo diicourteous, that our mifery nothing afflided them. Now, in regard that the heat derived from the Sun arifes from the reflexion of his beams darted upon the furface of the Earth, where the Sun cafts his beams perpendicular, (which is onely within the torrid Zone) the heat where the reflex is molt, mult bycon- fequente be greateft. But that the heat ihould fo exceed here at fuch a diftance from the Tropick, was doubtlefs from the quality of the Earth and inflanfd air that render it fo intemperate to us,though better endured by the Natives,who from their cradles are in ured to it. Cuftgm is a fecond Nature. In probability this was the Land of Nod, i.e. banifh- ment, into whicnC^ wandered after he departed from the prefence of the Lord^ for this Countrey is Eaft from JLden. And whereas he built Enoch the City, albeit it has loft the Name, the Mountains neverthelefs are not far diftant hence being part of Taurus and neighbouring the Badrians; albeit that name is found alfo near Vontm and Albania, as fome have placed them. From that hateful Town we halted, and next night got into CazJbyn. C A Z B Y N (or Kazwin after the lilp of Ferfm) is that fame City which was known to ancient Topographers by the name of Arfacia or Arfifaca which Strabo mentions, fo named from Arfaces that Yallant Per/ian who ruled here An.M, 3720. and from whom the enfuing Kings honoris gratia wqxq ftiled Arfacida. This was two hundred and fifty Years before the Incarnation of our Saviour CHRIST ; and is accounted the firft that made Media an Empire in defpight of that Seleuchus who was Son to the great Monarch of Syria Antiochus firnamed Theos. By command of Nycanor it was afterwards called Eu~ ropus; but loft that Name when it bended under the next conqueft. It is likely this was that ^^ (a City in as appears in Tobit J whither the Angel went from E q pcbatan10 Ca^byn. JEchatan to receive the ten Talents (of our money about three thoufand pounds) Tobias was to receive from Gabael fon to Gabrias his kinfinan. Their Talent of Silver contained 3000 Shekels, i.e. 375 pounds *, the Greek Talent being but 175 pounds fterlin?- but a Talent of Gold was twelve times as much. I am not ignorant that fome make Edijfa in Mesopotamia, to be Rages : but that is unlikely, for then what bufinefs had thev from Niniveh to go to Ecbatan ? (in the way no doubt or not far deviate to Raves) \ contrary way leading to which was fcituated'twixtT^w and : bcfides it is faidinthe Apocrypha that Rages was in Media^ which Edijfa is noti and whereas no part ot Media is nearer than a thoufand miles from the holy City, Edifa is not above five hundred. In one Author I find it called Hijpian meaning Hijpahan *, and if fo^ he is much miftaken, that City being two hundred and feventy miles from Cashyn, Whence the Word Cazhyn is fetcht I could not learn: but I fuppofe from Cowman i. e. a Vale of Barley ^ as Sheir-van is a Vale of Milk, &amp;c. or elfe from King Cazjvan as they call Acem keg the Armenian : or may it not be the relid of Catbira an old City which Strabo placed here ? for if I fhould deduce it from Cha^H as the feventy interpreters tranflate it in Gen. 38. 5. or from Cafifhia whence feveral of the Levites and Jews tranfplanted by Sal- manajfar and by order ot Artaxerxes were led back to build the Temple at Jerufalem, as mE^ra 8. 17. or other wife from Cafapain Hyrcania, as fome have fancied, it would relifh ot too much affectation. The lignification of Exile is unknown by interpretation or occali- on to the Inhabitants, except the broacher of that conceit had recourfe to the Idiom of the old Parthians. Heylm in his Geography makes this City and Spaham one, in which con jecture he is miftaken. The North Pole is here elevated 36 degrees and 15 minutes, longitude 85 degrees 30 minutes. By King Tamos (Son of//W/) it was made the Metropolis of this Mo narchy the better to affront the Ottomans. The Kingdom it ftands in is Media y the Pro vince Sheirvan, that part which is called Deylan : removed from Tabryz. a hundred and eighty miles Englifh: from Hamadan (the Sepulture of Queen Efler and Mordecai) a hundred and ten.

By which it appears, that this excellent Art of .Carpet-making w&lt;ls ancientlvDr i- difed in Perfia. / ^ ' Near the Palace Gate is a great Tank or Magazin of water made at the common charge, and almoft finiihed at our being here. The Hummums (or fweating-places) are many, and refplendent in the azure pargetting and tiling wherewith they are cerulea- ted . the vulgar buildings alio content the Inhabitants, but to a difcerning eye yield lit tle admiration. The Gardens are many and larger but with thole uiSfahawncixvdi Shyraz* not to be compared. The Mefchits are not two thirds fo many as John of Ferfia comput ed long ago to be above 600^ nbrthofefofaftidiousinpyramidical afpirings,nor curious in architecture, nor in-llde glory, as in many lefier Towns* So as I cannot enlarge her praiie, lave that in Spring and Autumn I believe it may be a temperate andinticing climate : but in Summer and Winter extreme in contraries v the Sun frying them with his oblique flaming glances, and Hyems a while no lefs benumming them with his icicles. Here we met the Pot-fhaw again' who got into Cashyn two dayes before us: And at his entrance into the Seat-royal inftead of diftributing the accuftomed Royal Benevo lence of giving a crown piece to ail the women at his return after a long progrefs, (which the Ancient Kings of Perfta ever ufed and. Alexander doubled to thofe that were with Child, and for omitting which Oohm is taxed,) Abhas exercifed his ieverity. For it feems that forty Camels entring loaden with Tobacco out of India, (the drivers being ig norant of a late prohibition, theKingfometimes commanding and reftraining asreafon of State invited,) Mamet Ally-i)egth.Q Favourite (wanting his pifcafh) commanded the pe nalty be executed^ which was to crop their ears and fnip their nofes^ offering withal to his angry Juftice a difinal facrifice of forty load of Tobacco which was put into a deep hole that ferved as a pipe, and being inflamed, in a black vapour gave the Citizens for two whole days and nights an unpleafing incenfe. After fome ftay, Sir Dodmore Cotton to quicken his difpatch vifited Mahomet Ally- heg\ who according to his education entertained the EmbalTador with a fupercilious look, advifmg him to truft his fecrets to his Cabinet, wherein as he would have him to underftand the Myfteries of the whole State were locked ^ the King by reafon of other great affairs expreffing a willingnefs that it fhould be fo. The AmbafTador in any other place than Verfia might have fleighted his propofition: but perceiving no other remedy, and defiring to hafte home, imparted fo much as he law neceflary. In anfwer to which, he foon perceived that touching Sir he was to exped; no further latisfadli- on, his adverfary being dead and at the Cajpian Sea the King having fufficiently honoured him; but to fpeak truly, the Pot-fhaugh had then no afFedion for him, when probably by reafon of his old-age he was difabled to do him further fervice; adding (but out of an enemies mouth) that his Ambaflies to the Princes of Chriftendom were but complements of ordinary moment. But when our Ambaflador objedled, he was in perfon there tojuftifie his Commiffion *, that he had the Kings Letter of credence, fign'd and ftamp'd by the Shaugh himfelf; and that it had been a dangerous prefumption for Sir Robert Sherley to look Shaw-Abbas in the face had he been an Impoftor •, the Favourite was convin ced we thought, for he had no further objedion, fave That fo our AmbaflMour plea fed to lend him that Phirman Sir brought for his juftification, he would return it him next day, with his Mafters fence concerning it. It was no imall vexation to our Ambaffadour to treat in this fort by proxy : but iV&gt;- cejfitas cogit adturpa is an old faying: and three dayes palled e're Mahomet Ally-beg would either vou'chfafe to return the Letter or give that fatisfadion he promifed. Howbeir, E e 2 atT- ' ii 'Jli Hi ZIZ Mahomet Ally-begx undue at length he came in perfon and told the Ambaffador, That the King had look'd upon it, denied it to be his, andin paflionburntit *, and thatSir Robert Sherley had liberty tode- ,part. Now albeit our Ambafladour very well knew this undue practice, yet it was in vain to challenge the Pragmatick Pagan; nor knew he any recourfe by Juftice to eafe himfelf, fuch wastheconftitutionof that time and place : and by the enquiry then made, it was very well underftood, how that he never fhewed it the King, nor had made further fcrutiny concerning it. The truth is, he was brib'd, but by whom is not necef- fary to be mentioned: for Abbas by this got the worft, feeing in this tranfadion he was difhonoured 9 otherwiie his juftice and prudence would have appeal ed more to Sir Robert's Vindication: Befides, the difcontent he expreiled againft Nogdibreg (as noted) and Ebrahim-chan his Son, who durft not appear at Court whiles Sir Robert Sherley was there, nor many months after till SynaUhan had mediated his peace (albeit not he but his Fa ther had offended) made it as apparent as the Sun, that there was jugling. The truth is, the wicked pradice of thefe parts is fuck x that when any are fuper-annuated, ac cording to the Proverb, feeing they can do no more Work they are to exped no more Wages; and accordingly Sir Robert Sherley through old-age being difabled to fervethe Perfians, that made them both fleight his perfon, and retrench hispenfion, even then when he moft expeded fubfiftence and merited their beft acknowledgments. But this bad requital ofgoodfervice is no new thing in' Perfia : witnefs that which Plutarch in vita Artaxerx. relates concerning Antalcidas a noble Spartan ; who whiles that State was paramount, no man in the Per pan Court was more regarded : but fuffering an eclipfe at the battel of Leuttra (attributed to the good condud of Bpamimndai) the Spartans di- fpatched Antalcidas to the PerfianKing for fupplies, whofe reception was then as fleight as formerly it was honourable. And hence came thofe difcontents, nay that Arrow of Death that arrefted him: for upon the thirteenth ot July (in lefs than a fortnight after ourentring Cashyn) He gave this tranfitory world an ultimum vale in his great cli- maderick. AFamily of fo good antiquity, that the naming ferves to illuftrate it with out any Hyperbole. This Gentleman made good the old Proverb, That'tis better to die honourably than to live with obloquy. And ( wanting a fitter place for burial) we laid him under the threihold of his door without much noifeor other ceremony. He was Brother to two gallant Gentlemen Sir Anthony and Sir Thomas Sherley ^ defervedly ranked amongft the greateft Travellers of their times, and (by their great experience) qualified for moft eminent fervicesboth Civil and Martial. So as in the due Encomium of fuch, give me leave to apply what learned Cafaubon has obferved upon Strabo, Etenim Poetfriidentiffimos Hcroiim pronmciant eoSy qui multis peregrinationibm up funt &amp; varialoca pervagati, Multorumvidijfe Homimm cummoribm Vrbes. Together with that of Ecclefi- afiicui 34. 9. where (in the old Tranflation) 'tis faid, A man that hath travelled under- ftandeth muchand he that hath good experience talketh efwifdom : but he that hath no experi ence knoweth little. When J travelled to and fro. If aw many things, and my under Banding was greater than I was able to exprefs; oft-times was I in danger of death, but by thofe things I had deliverance. In fome meafure verified in thefe Brethren *, who in palling through ftrange Countreys efcaped many dangers, wherein neverthelefs they reaped much ho nour, and in which variety this Gentleman had his lhare •, and no lefs tafted of fiindry Princes favours: For, by Rodolyh the fecond he was created a Palatine of the Empire, by Pope Paul. 3. an Earl of the Sacred Palace of Later an from whence he was impowred to legitimate the Indian Baftards •, and from the Perpan Monarch he received feve- ral honourable Commands, and for whom he performed fome memorable fervi- ces: but when he moft expeded thanks, found leaft, in his old-age, even when he beft deferved. Yet in that not unlike Bellifarias. Which I fpeak not by report- And therefore feeing he wants gilded Trophies to adorn his Sepulchre (albeit his Ver- tuecan out-brave thofe bubbles of vanity) till fome will do it better, accept this Vltim Moris exprejfio from him whofo long travelled in his company, and fo much honour ed him.

She was of CW fiian Parentage, and honourable defcent. Her firft relation to the Court was by beins fent up to attend the Sultana, and by that means became fequeftred to the Bar am - where are many hundred Virgins admitted whom the King feidom or never fees • and for ought I could hear, to the King fhe was no otherwife related: He neverthelefs'has power to difpofe of fuch of them as he pleafes to his Officers, who efteem it no fmall honour to receive a Wife from his Royal Hands. According to which cuftom the Emperour of Perfia prefented her to Sir Robert S her ley as a teftimony of his refped : which Lady was a conftant Companion to him in all his fortunes until death. Such time as her beloved Lord lay dead, and Ihe half dead through a long dyfentery to add to her afflidion one John a Dutchman (rather a Jew) a Painter, regarding neither her Sex, Profeffion nor difconfolate condition, complots with Mamet-Ally-hev her Huf- bands enemy to mine her pretending an engagement her Husband was in to one Crole a Flemming and knowing he was dead, referred himfelf t8 the teilimony of the defund to Witn^s it,having no other evidence it feems to prove the debt.

Howbeit, a faithful honeft Gentleman of our Campany Mr. Robert Hedges by name, hap pily having notice, haftens to her Houfe and advifes her to make quick conveyance of her goods, which the poor Lady readily hearkens to, and forthwith tears the Satten- quilt fhe .lay upon, fhewing that vertue a ftronger could not have bettered •, and taking thence a Cabinet which contained lome Jewels of value, being indeed the all was left her intreats that worthy Gentleman to fafeguard them till the danger was over.

Yet; Anthony attempts revenge, but adverfe Fortune fuffered him not to thrive *, fuch was the reliftance he found by the Satrapeni (inhabiting Adedid) and the Armenian forces led by Ttgranes a Captain that formerly worfted Lucullm. Howbeit, Auguffim (in whofe Reign our bleffed Saviour became flefh, and Temple was opened) by Treaty eafily efFeded what his predeceffors could not do by force ^ prevailing with Phraartes to vail bonnet to the Roman Diadem. But two hundred and thirty years after, one Artaxerxes a native Perfian and royally defcended, fhakes off* that fervitude ^ not Onely out braving the Roman, but by a three dayes fight and vidtory over Artabanm revived the Ver[ian name, which for full five hundred years had been fubjedl to Parthia. Alexander Severm (from Julius Cafar the four and twentieth Emperour) fucceeding Heliogahalws theluftful receives a pragmatick Letter from the new King to rejftore what anciently adorned the Crown of Perfia. This repugn'd the Roman Majefty, and there upon marches to give him an account: but in carelefs pairing ovev Euphrates, the Army was fo fuddenly charged by Artaxerxes that the Roman Emperour was routed totally : his bad luck not ending there; for Maximmm the Thracian foon after bereaved him of his Empire and the German afTaflinates ofhislife; his vertuous Mother Mamm&amp;a {Origens Profelyte) affociating the Emperour in his death as fhe had formerly in his glory. Licinim Valerianm firnamed Colohm undertook then to rule the Empire, and took upon him to ov'er-rule the rifing Perfian : but neither his eloquence which was notable, nor Army which was great, could do what a Supreme Judge had decreed otherwife •, for Sapores with an undaunted party denied him entrance, and in the trial the Romans were defeated ^ but which wzsworfe,Valerian himfelf being taken prifoner was to his dying-day (and to the aftonifhment of all Tyrants)made a foot-ftool for Sapores to tread upon when- foever he mounted: the Jultice of God herein being fingularly manifefted, b^com- penfating the Emperour in this fingular abafement and odious fervitude for his cruelty and extreme rigour extended to the Orthodox Chriftians, many thoufands of which he had martyr'd, and amongll the reft Saint that noble witnefs, who upon a grid-iron was in a moft horrid and inhumane manner broiled to Death. But have I not wandred too far in reviving the memory of Parthia? For by this we are entred CWw: where having refreflied our fcorched and wearied bodies three dayes, of fo noble a plaice I could not chufe but make this following obfervation. C O O M (in the latitude of '3 4 degrees 40 minutes) is a City at this day of Ipecial note in Parthia ; placed in the mid-way betwixt thofe two royal Cities Cazhyn and Spahawn: A City which (if fame fay true) for Antiquity and quondanfgreatnefs gives place to no other in Perjia *, whether confidered in the Name Gama (a name it once bore and by affimilation thought by fome to be that Guriana which in old times was a Town of fingular note; but erronioully as I conceive, feeing that was under five degrees further latitude • Ff 2 andio The greateft C and by Ptolomy placed in Or in the name Arhaolay fo called from Arhaces the Mede who in the year from the Creation 3,14^* foundation or rather nevv-im- pofed the name foon after the deftrudion of Nineveh, to whofe overthrow he moft contri buted : Or in Coama, which is aname l find recorded in Ptolomy and Diodore and being then of that eminency as gave the adjacent part of that province the name Coama, &amp; Re?ioComivf&lt;ena, as I find in [Strabo lib. 11. andalfoin Ptolomy. Notwithftanding, fo me there be and that of approved authority, who take this City rather than 5^?^^ ^ - that which by reafonoflts hundred gates the Grecians termed Hecatompulos) and may be granted feeing the latitude is the fame which Ptolomy gives it. Nor was this place lefs confiderable for magnitude than antiquity : for m? Ifau by Arabian Geographers it is one of the four beft Cities that Empire had ^ and the Inha bitants have a tradition. That for bulk it was once comparable unto Babylon. Friar odoricm de Friuli alfo reports it to have been full fifty miles in circumference, and that for greatnefs it gave not place to any other City in Afa. Howbeit, the circuit it then had cannot by any marks now extant be difcovered: but that it was a lar§e Town is di- fcernable both by the rubbifh appearing in feveral places, the foundation of Temples, and other publick Strudures- Now feeing fome Travellers have vouchfafed this City fo immenfe a body, it gives me the invitation to take a retrofped of other great and famous Cities*, which if it be a vanity, I have no better excufe than by remembring that S. Aftguftin made it one of his three wiflies. To have feen Rome in its glory. The greateft Cities that ever were, without all peradventure were Babylon and Rome, (with which I might rank Nineveh: ) Emperial during fuch times as thofe Monarchs fwayed their Scepters over the Univerf^. That hyperbole mentioned at which derifively term Cairo and Villages, I willingly pretermit*, for fmce their fall, new Babylon and new Rome, that is to fay El-Cairo and Confiaminople, are by molt ranked amongft the greateft Cities of the World. Concerning being now fo near the place, lihall here onely note her circuit: (who gives the largelt meafure) re ports it to be four hundred and eighty furlongs, which according to our admeafurement is about threefcore English miles. And Rome (in Nero\ time at full growth) had fifty: of which laft, the extent maybeft be imagined by the number of thofe free Denizons enrolled into Cenfe that were able to bear Arms, which as Lip/tits and others relate were 463000. and could not exceed one third of the whole. Women, Children and Servants comprehended. And if we fhould allow old Rome in its flourilhing ftate to have been fifty Italian or Englijh miles about, which is a vaft circuit j yet cannot we grant that it was fo thick built, nor with Houfes lb large for habitation or fo high as are now in Paris and London, theirs feldom exceeding 2 ftories, I mean the common fort of Build ings j but granting that the Houfes in old Rome might exceed for number, yet were they not fb fill'd with inhabitants. Roftnm in his Antiquit. Roma divides old Rome into 13 Provinces, each Province contained a hundred Houfes, called Regions by at the foundation: But the greatnefs Rome was principally increaft by the many publick Stru- (ftures and Temples it had. Quod magnitudinem Roma adanxit fuerant Tempi a &amp; multifma facromm locorum^ubi figna &amp; flatua deomm, hominum &amp; animalium, ponuntur.

Now whereas I named Cairo and Conflantinople as the greateft Cities of recent times, it was partly for their being adopted into the names or thofe two former •, and fome Travellers as yet continue that repute concerning them, although I am of another opinion : For, Cairo is well known to be a long and narrow Mattering piece, or rather pieces of Towns patcht together, and falls much fhort of that grandeur lome report it ; AjfeBus fnm admiratione (faith Ludovicus Rom.

And concerning ConflantinopUy it is a great and populous City v yet has notCoom. • . &gt; not above twelve tnghfr miles compafs, theHoufes very mean and low built, and within the Walls are many Gardens and waft places: but were their circumvallations trel e to what they are, they would fall fliort of what old ^ and are reported ThoS alfo, when I confider the many and great Gardens and Orchards thev ihen piroteb v had, ( for without doubt that high raifed Garden which i^WWw^ereaed uoon ar ched pillars was for admiration and profpeft over the City which was founded upon a le vel ground, rather than that there wanted Garden-room in Bahylon \ ) as at this dav Jlantimfle and Cairo have, and according to the recent mode of and other the greateft and noblelt Cities of the Orient, (for as to the greatnefsof thole of r give little credit •,) I am perfwaded that thofe vacant and pleafurable places took up well- nigh half the ground within thofe Cities. So as by what I have confidered and obfer ved, I am not afraid to fay. That it is probable fome of our Cities are not lefs numerous in Houfes and fixed Inhabitants, than thofe I named. For albeit in Germany, and Xhs Netherlands there are very many large and beautiful Citiesvet there find 1 none that for greatnefs and populoufnefs are comparable to zaiLondon- which two, like the reflex of the two great Luminaries, appear the greateft: and of thofe, to which the precedency Ihould be given, is work for a more accurate obferver Neverthelefs, though by the vogue of moft Travellers I well know that has the firft place attributed j I grant it is fo increafed Cnce I was there, being upwards of 20 Years, that I am not qualified to give a judgemnt: But on the other fide, London is alfo increafed fince then, even to admiration: fo that were the length of London drawn into a circle (the lhapethat Paris bears) taking in all that Building which is contiguous it is believed the diameter would equal if not exceed Paris. And as to number of In' habitants, the addition it has from the Sea by People from exotique places gives it a capacity above Paris, and as by the Weekly-BiHs of Mortality is prefumed. Moreover the number of Gardens, Cemeteries and like places adjoyning Religious Houfes and Churches, Colledges in the Univerfity, befides thofe belonging to the King Princes and other of the Nobility there, with the great number of Tennis-Courts in take up much more fpare place than London doth, which efpecially within the Walls is moft compact and thronged with Houfes, with few Gardens or like vacant places interjecting But iuppoling that the narrow Lanes where Coaches, and Alleys where Men can hard ly pafs (which alfo are good Buildings) were expatiated and extended to an equal breadth with the broadeft Street, doubtlefs either of thofe Cities would then fwell beyond the compals either of Bahylon or Rome, or any other •, which neverthelefs is fubmitted. This digreflion I have the rather adventured, obferving how that forreign Writers either out of ignorance or envy fpeak fparingly of our Metropolis; and in rank, place it amonglt Cities that be but of a fecond or third magnitude. Therefore to return. The Name this City now bears has been varioufly pronounced, according to the dif ferent Dialeft of Nations: Some call it Ceim others Kom, and calls it Cmo i but the Arabian Geographers Comm. The fcituation neverthelefs is unanimoufly agreed to be in a large aud delightful Plain; the Countrey for Ibme miles about very fruitful in its foil, and the air exceeding fweet, feldom clouded with fogs or parched with heat, fave when the Sun pafles from the Vernal to the Northern Tropick - the breezes alfo feldom fail them which allays the heat, likewife abated by thofe fruit ful Gardens they have, whofe Trees are their beft umbrella's for refrelhment as well as lhade, bearing ftore of delicious fruits, namely Grapes, Pomgranates, Melons of all forts, Pomcitrqns, Apricocks, Plums, Pears, Piftachio's, Almonds, Apples, Quinces, Cherries, Figgs, Wall-nuts, Small-nuts, Berries, and the beft Wheat in Perfia (Gumha- uHello excepted:) the Peach or MalaPerfica is alfo here abounding •, a fruit and fo much refembling man's heart and tongue, that the e^jpriciPriefts dedicated it to their Goddefs //is as the hieroglyphick of affedion; probably that which in his Georq. refers to, 4 Media yields fieafant dpyle of harjh juice \ 0 Gain ft flef-dames poyfm nothing more in fife. The City has about two thoufand Houfes, moft of them of more than common ftru- dure*, well built, well formed, well furniftied: the Streets are Ipacious •, the beautiful; but the City is now unwalled, according to the ufual mode of Cities in ji/ta. The Mofque is famous and Venerable, having been richly and beautifully adorned by enfhrining the Body of once amiable Fatymay Mortis-AUfs Wife, Daughter and Heir to their Prophet Mahomet, The Mefquit is of epirotiquc form the Tomb raifed three yardsvards high covered with Velvet, and the afcent by three or four fteps of refined Sil ver.

From Coom we rode to Zenzen^of old Zoara and thence to Cajhan, Caff aim Cluverm mif-fpellsit: a City from removed fix and thirty miles ^ the way eafie and plain, albeit fandy. CASH AN, where the Artick elevation is 34 7 minute S) longitude 86 degr. may worthily be reputed the fecondTown in Tarthia for grandeur, wealth and beauty: diftant North from Spaham fixty long Englijh miles :and from Ca^byn South two hundred and ten or thereabouts. Whence the Name derives it felf, the illiterate Cajhaniam could not tell*, but my conjedure is that 'tis borrow'd either from Cufhan, which in the 5yr^c^fignifieth heat or blacfcnefs; or from Caffan-Mir^a Son to Hoc en Son of Ally • or elfe from Shaw-Cajhan (Son to Jxan, begot by Tangrolipix An. Heg. 582. of our account 1202.) fubjeded by the Great Cham ; or (which belt pleafes me, if ancient enough) from Vjhan-Caftan the Armeniariy (Acen or Caffan-heg fome call him) who in the Year of our Lord 1470. of Mahomet's flight from Mecca 850. vanquiihed Malaoncres (whom fome call Abdnlla-cham) the laft of Tamertang's progeny that ruled Perfia. At this day it is a City both great and lovely, and ancient too ^ for Oderic intitles it. a noble and renowned City in his time: and as now it is well feated, comely built^ and abundantly peopled i over-topt by no Hill, unfeafoned by no Marifhes, nor watered by any great Stream *, which chiefly augments the heat when Sol approaches Cancer : But which rages there in no lefs violence is Scorpio ; not that in the Zodiac^ but real Scor pions which in numbers engender here. A little Serpent of a finger long, (which makes me marvel at Cedrenm who fayes there are Scorpions 2 cubits long in the Brachmans Coun- trey, i.e. India,) like but lefs than our Cray-fifli v and is the onely creature that ftings with his tail, fome flyes excepted: Of great terrour in the fting ^ and fo inflaming, as with their invenomed arrow fome die, few avoid madnefs, at leaft for a whole day; the fting proving moft dangerous when the feafon is hotteft, which is when the Dog-- Sta^rages. And as it was laid of aMther, Vna eademq, mams fert minus opimque: lb in this malady is no fuch remedy as by applying the oyl of Scorpions. The Poet fo advifes, Quae nocmt ferpens, fertur caput illius apte Vulneribus jungi, fanat quae lauciat ipfa. Ut Lariflsea curatus Telaphus hafta. The Serpent's head joyn'd to the wounded part Fitly is [aid to heal th' infetted [mart. Like Telaphus cur'd by Achilles Dart. The execration is. May a Scorpion of Cafhan fting thee. But which is more remarkable, and agreeable to what Pliny in his Natural Hiftory reports of the Scorpions in Mefopota- mia\ they fay, and we found it true*, fome of them creeping into our our Rugs as we flept, they feldom or never hurt a Stranger. Holler affirms how that one who exceed ingly loved the fmell of Bafd, being dead had a Scorpion found in his brains: howbeit, the tAEthiops fay, That to eat Bafil is an Antidote. But Maimonides the learned Jew in his Conn. Ethici-, fayes. Contra iBurn Scorpii urina filii eft propinanda quadraginta dierum, ad menfuram quatuor ovorum: the quantity of 4 egg-fhells full of a Child's urine drunk forty dayes cures the fting of a Scorpion*. But what Pliny reports, That Crabs having their clawsCajhan, claws broke ofFand buried in the Earth, will become Scorpions, The Africans report. That 'tis a prcfent cure to anoint with writes, how that one ftung with a Scorpion was helped by drinking Frankincenle S the fculpture of a Scorpion refolved into powder. Howbeit, the ufualremed5 is to Weed and bathe the affeded part with Scorpions oyl; or otherwife to hold it over the head of the Scorpion, firft being foundly bruifed. This noblo City is in compafs not lefsthanT^or Norwich, about four thoufand Fa milies being accounted in her. TheHoufes are fairly built, many of which are parm- ted without and painted :, the Mofques and Hummums are in their cupoloes curionflv ceruleated with a feigned Turquoife: the Buzj^ar is fpacious and uniform: furnifhed with r k 9 x a 7 ma 1 S ! C t an ? c J r P ets ^s, filk and gold, and of courfe thrumd-woolno part of the World having better or better coloured. Here are alfo ftore of Spices and odier Merchandize. Befides, the People here (the fruit of Induftry ) be more civil, no? fs adive, and as trim and rich in their attire as I could obferve in any other part- and by reafon they allow few to be idle, here are full Manufadures of Silks, Sattens and cloth of gold cunofly wrought and coloured, no better in the World •, and in fuch plentv that one Cartwright an EnjrliJh Merchant who was there about the Year 1600. fpares Vor to averr, That there was then more Silk brought in one Year into Cafhan, than broad C oaths are into LorJov. Here alfothey have a lingular Art in dying or colouring of Silks, and ftaining of Linnen-cloth like the Indian-]?antadoes. They alfb make verv en nous lively flowers and knots, and in beautiful colours upon Leather which are verv foftmg and for feveral ufes. In a word, a more induftrious and civil People or i Town better governed Perfia elfewhere has not. Here is no want of pleafure neither abounding m Gardens, Fruits, and Corn, by the elaborate Tymars made to frudifie! which being cultivated, retribute a gainful acknowledgment. The in this City is very noble, nay I may fay an unparallel'd Fabrick of that kind, by manvdesrees preceding ail other Carravans-raws we law in Perfia , this being both large enoueh' and ht enough to lodge the Court of the greateft Potentate in Afia. A Royal foundation it is, being built by Abbas for Travellers to repofe in^r^, and to exprefs his magnifi cence as well as charity. The whole Building is grounded with Marble, rifin^ from the ground fix foot ^ therelidue is brick arified in the Sun, pargetted and adorned with knots and fancies of Arabic Charaders, m azure, red, and white colours laid inOvl after the mode of Perfia. It is a perfed quadrant; for each angle from one another are two hundred paces, the whole eight hundred. In the umbilic of this Court is a fauare Tank filled (by an Aqme-dud) with cryftallin water. This royal Inne has alfo adiovn mg it fuch Gardens as rather exceed than want to difplay the founders munificence' Here is not any other memorable Antiquity that I could hear of, fave that Nycador oj lan theUfurper who died frantick was buried here Anno Heg. 655. and he fcarce worth the Memory. More than which I have not to fay concerning this City, other than that feveral conjedures by learned men have pafled, Whence the Wife-men came that pre- fented our blelTed Saviour with their offerings, who were without doubt the firil-fruits and called of the Gentiles •, waiting the accompliihment of Balaams Prophecie mentioned in Numb, 24.. 17. There Jhall oome a Star out of Jacob, and a Scepter Jhal/ rife out of Ifrael md jhallfmtte the corners of Mozh, and deflroy the Children o/Seth: which was gathered more from this of their Prophet than any other Aftrologic computation. Now that they were Gentiles is evident ^ that they came from the Eaft, undeniable : But from what City or Province nolefs difputablethan theplace of their burial. ThewordMam is proper to Perfia, Perfia is Eaft from Bethlehem ^ fo as fbme are of opinion they came from hence ^ others fay from Shujhan where then flourifhed an Academy. Neverthe- lefs, the people here have a Tradition, That thofe three Wife-men or Kings went hence • which fome fay were intombed in Cullen- Howbeit, Melchior perfwades us they came from Sheba in Sabea : and Ex orientali Arabia regione, Reges ad colendum Chriflum vemrmt jaith Pofiellm, The Kings came from the Eaft part of Arabia to worlhip Chrift. Others labour no lefs to bring them from the Omerits in Ethiopia South. From Babylon other- lome think they came ; from Ormus fome would have them a conjedureas likely as it was Faradife. Ceyloon and Taproban have been thought their Countrey: But if you pleafe to truft Friar Oderic of Friuli, Cajhan was it. And his conjedure is not amifs, leeing that TheophylaB and other ancient writers, as alfo Saint Chryfofiom in his &lt;5. Horn. upon Saint Matthew affirms, that the Magi who came to worlhip Chrift, were Perfian Princes But feeing this is a work of fuch difficulty, let me rather bufie my brains in queit of what a Magm was&gt; fince Simon Magus through his black Art has in common acceptation rendred the name odious 5 and under which Ti tle, Witches, Sorcerers, En chanters,Terfian Magi. dnnters Fortune-tellers, or pretending Calculators of Nativities, Hydromantiques, Pvromantiques, and other Diaboliques have cloaked their trumperies; altogether un. worthy the name of the Perfian Magi which was an honourable Epithete, and peculiar to Vcrfia Such as excell'd in Philofophy and Piety, Suidas terms them Phllofofhi &amp; Philothei. Which neverthelefs has been attributed though under other names to liich as amongft other Nations were ftudious in Philofophy and the Liberal Sciences; fuch as after the Dialed of their Countreys were called Gymmfophifti, Brachmanni, Tallapoy,ChaU&lt;ei y Br Hi des Bardhi, &amp;c. who in their times were contemplative and 'ftudious in the fecrets of Nature, which in the worft fence and vulgarly as commonly accepted is called Ma- eique • but Judicial and Natural Aftrology in a more favourable, and by the moft learn- ed* And in which, our moft ancient Philofophers the Druides (long before the Saxons entrance) were excellent, as I might prove by many inftances i but that one out of Pliny\ Natural Hiftory Tlin.lib. 30. c. 1. may ferve. That the Britains were fo addided unto ' Masick as in that Art they were the firft that inftruded the Perftam ; an Authority that - ferves well to reprove Tully-, who ralhly intitles the Britains barbarous, albeit I fiippofe he did it upon the general account as they ufually ftiled all thofe Nations, Quihrn mc linmam nec legem Romani dederint, who derived neither their Laws nor Language from the Romans. ^ And in that the Greeks were even with them, when they comprehended the Romans under that attribute. Now the difference 'twixt the Magi and Pfendo-Magi are thefe. Common cuftom (faith S. Hierom) apprehends that Magicians are no better than Enchanters ; fuch as impoftors now a days are rightly termed, who ufually delude their cuftomers with fallacious words and fpecies, or other wife pradife an unlawful correlpondence with Satan in his black Arts, like thofe Jannes and Jamhres who refifted Mofes^ and either by a deceptio vifm or diabolical enchantments imitated Mofes, until by a fupreme vindictive hand upon themfelves by that plague of Lice they were conftrained to acknowledge the Omnipotency of God, and thatdigito thofe wonders were per formed by his Servant Mofes, which they were not able to counterfeit, Exod. 8.19. In which rank were Ely mas, i. e, the Perfian Sorcerer mentioned AB. 13 .8. and Simon fir- damed Magus his Con-difciple, both which ufed infernal Arts, and were accordingly difcovered and puniflied by the Apoftles. Whereas contrarily, it may be prefumed by the charader given the right (fuch as thofe were who come with their offerings to Chrift,) that theirs was lawful: For, faith Peter Martyr, By the word Magi we underftand Wife and Honeft Men*, and is the more credible, feeing that the definition of Magia, is no other than an elevated Wifdom and Science of the Harmony and concents of Uni- verfals in Nature, in which the Magi took an unexprelfible delight. Now it will not be denied that the pleafures of the Intelled do far exceed thofe of the Affedions; for iq pleafure there is fatiety, which is not attained to in knowledge*, Satisfadion and Ap petite (faith the Lord VeruUm) being perpetually interchangeable. And Apuleius with- all in his Apol. tell us. That P erf arum lingua Magm eft, qui noftra, Sacerdos: Which is probable, feeing that the Jews themfelves had it in fuch eftimation as it was a rule, how that in Gemara-lege non adfcifci in Sanhedrim MagU non ignaros, &amp; 70 linguarum peritos. With which agrees that of another ; Is Magm eft qui Divinorum erat cultor &amp; interpret And Teucerm lib, de Divinit. Pra-erant Magi religioni Perfica ut in populo Dei Levita, ftu~ Miff, 'vena Philofophia erant dediti ; nec ufquam Rex Per far urn pot erat ejfe, qui non ante a M(t~ goram difciplinam fcientUmq^ percepiffet. Which we may the better credit, feeing Cyrus in that memorable confpiracy he made againft his Brother Artaxerxes, perfwading the Greeks to confederate with him, amongft other praifes vainly arrogated to himfelf, one was, That he was more capable of Rule than his Brother for that he was the greater Magician*, intending thereby Bonas Artes &amp; Munera Lingua, Stellarumq-, vias &amp; magni Sydera Coeli, his proficiency in the Liberal Arts, Languages and Aftrology. Plutarch alfo in the Life of Themiftocles acquaints us, that of fo high efteem were the Magi with the Perfian Kings, as they frequently and delightfully heard their Ledures touching Philofophy and Art Magick. Mantuan alfo very rightly thus defines them. Ille penes Perfas Magus eft, qui Sydera novit^ Qui fciat Herbarum vires, cultu% Deorum. Perfepolis facit ifta Magos, prudentia triplex. A Perfian Magus caWd he is. Who knows Herbs, Stars, and Deities, All three learn'd in Perfepolis. So as upon the whole it appears that the Magi were fo called from their laborious fcru- tiny into hidden caufes ; by their pradice and experience in Aftronomy improving the theory as well as pradique part. For by their careful obferving the celeftial motions, they comprehend their probable influences*, and from thence divined manyftrange and notable'Babylon. 225 notable events in Nature, as Earthquakes, Inundations, Eclipfes, diftemnerature in Weather, Revolutions of State and the like : but which was moft confiderable bv theircontemplatmg the wonderful order, harmony and providence by which theCrea tureis made and governed, they duly magnified and admired the Creator; and from their cuftomary diving into occult caufes of Nature, were thence called Magicah albe- jt no other than a connexion of Agents and Patients in Nature, refpefting each other 5 and by learned men, difcovered to produce fuch effeds, as to fuch as are ignorant of their cairfes appear ftrange and wonderful. But after this digreffion, I proceed upon our Travel. The 2 3 oM we ca nie to a Village called BiMode, which was about eighteen miles from Cajhan: There we refted but one day. The next night we got to Natane, which fome call and in probability takes name from Nanea •, for Diana was there fo called and worfhipped. There goes a Tradition likewife, that the laft unfortunate Barim there breathed his laft, through the treachery of that perfiduOus Badtrian-gf/Tk, A.M. 363 5. Whicluffo, then I may make this obfervation. The Village and Lodge afhamed of fuch a barbarilm, feems to hide it felf betwixt two lofty hills, fo as until near the Pk\ ce t: ] s hardly to be difcerned. Neverthelefs from the top of either of thofe hills we had a delightiul prolped •, for from thence we could fee feveral Countrev Villages, watered by fmall Rivolets. That Nights Travel was full thirty Miles. The next night we got to Reig : but more than that it was one and twenty miles from Natane, not worth remembrmg-, and that from Spahawn it is diftant three farfangs ^ but from Cazbyntwo hundred and fixty or thereabouts. Whence to Eagkat, the firlt day is to Corranda, and then lucceilively to Deacow-t Mifcarroon, Corryn y Laccary, Corbet, Naz,areiL Sahher- cawn, (near which is Pully-jhaw and Caromon-Jhahoon formerly called Coon-fha, where was decided that famous conteft for the Per fan Crown 'twixt Artaxerxes and C\rm re corded byXenophon, and in memory whereof in the concave of the adjacent Mountain is engraven Pourtraits refembling thofe I mentioned of Ruftan near the ruinesof Ter(epolis\ onely here are added the figures of Elephants and other Beafts, fuch as are well worth a Travellers obferying.) Bagdat is next to Sahhercawn-y whence is but one davs journey to Bagdat upon Tigris, the total being a hundred and thirty farfangs. How- beit, trom Spahawn there is another road; firft travelling to Golf khan which is forty lariangSj thence to Toffarchan forty more*, to Mando fifty, to Hemoometz.ar icYzn, and then by Baroe to Bagdat leven more; in alia hundred forty four farfangs, the paffage more eafie, though of greater diftand^ and therefore more travelled, efpecially by Carravan: Of which City old and new, fuffer me to give a brief defcription. And firlt of Babylon. BABYLON was of old a City in that Countrey which in Gen. 11. 2. is named Shinaar, a Vale watered by the River Euphrates, one of thole that ftreamed throueh Paradife: The Countrey afterwards was called Catdea (Keldan and Arc alder by Berojks but the Laod of Nimrod in Mic. 5. 6.) and after that Babylonia. To the Eaft it had Sufi- ana , to the Weft Mesopotamia ; and to the South part of the Verfian Gulph. The name was inipofed upon that memorable confufion of fpeech happening there about a hundred and twenty years after the Flood, which defeated that defign the race of Cham (for He- hers Family would not joyn with Nimrod in that attempt) had hatcht to fecure themfelves from a fecond Deluge. The promoting which impious work is attributed principally to mt Nimrod whom Gen. 10.9. is ftiled Themighty Hunter j fuch, as his Tyranny became aProverb: BerofuscalkdNimbroth who with his confederates'intended.fuch a pvle the top whereoflhould reach into Heaven, *y£dijicemm nobis Vrbem &amp; Turrim, cuius ca put fit in Coelis, Gen. n. 4. Berofm adds, ad altitudinem &amp; magnitudinem Montium. And accordingly multorum manibm (there being as good Authors report no lefs than five hundred thouland men) by full thirty years inceflant labour that llupendious work whofebaliswasnine miles about, had its fuperftrudure advanced to a proportionable heightfive thoufand paces fay fome, which make 25730 foot: a height hardly to be believed, when we confider how that wonder of the world the greateft of the Egyptian Pyramids exceeds not a thoufand foot fayes Heylin ; five hundred foot fave one fayes Greaves*, whofereport is moft to be credited feeing he meafured if, which Pyramid if but five hundred foot, equals the height of Pauls when the Pyramidal Spire ftood upon the Steeple. Yet Herodotus reports this Tower was in height four thoufand paces , S. Hierorne exceeds him making it fixteen thoufand : but feeing the Stair or pafiage to afcend by was circular, aild of that breadth alfo (if we may credit Verftegan) as afforded fcope fufficient for Horfe and Carts to turn 'tis probable the paces mentioned by St. Hierom and Herodotus rather relate to the compafs than to the perpendicular. Which confideration can bell qualifie that Jewilh hyperbole we meet with in the Jalcut, averring that it was feven and twenty miles high: An edifice (lettheheight be ^hatit will) fo wonderful as ■ G § gave &gt;to a HeathenPoettcTfygn his G f^on^ utjovem de [ad fede detruderent.

This Grand idol had for many Ages been had in divine venerationib as the Reformation had been commendable had it proceeded from a better principle. From the top of the higheft Tower, and by reafon of the continual lerenity of the Sky, the Caldean Aftrologers (whofe skill in that Art they fay was pradifed 3600 years before Alexanders conquefts, which if true, reaches to Enochs time) precifely obferved the Planetary motions, and though they could not hear their rowling harmony, yet thence they had the exad light and magnitude of the Stars, their heliacal acronical matutine and vefpertine motions, rife and fall i the progrefs of the Sun ^ the conftellations, afpeds and influence of the Planets, &amp;c. for in that Art during thofe times they had the greateft Knowledge of any Aftrolo- S ers - Now though the heart of S emir amis was put into an orb of Gold above, yet her body was interred below.

The Parthian s afterwards did the like to Selemia when they built Oefiphon about a league further upon the River and that new City in the like fort was made defolate upon the building of Fologocerta by logefesthe Parthian King about a hundred Years after the firft Cafar ; the rutnes of which great Cities oft amufe and probably mifguide Travellers, when they view their mines for the finding out old Babylon or Nimrod\ Tower: notwithftanding all the light held forth by ancient Writers, or the traditional reports of the prefent Inhabitants whofpeak. onely by hear-fay and pure ignorance: And by reafon of Voifinage Seleucia alfo is (but erroneoufly) by fome taken for Babylon rather than Bagdath, That Babylon which is in v£gypt was built by Cambyfes the Per fan King Son to Cyrus, but fince named El-Cairo by Gehoar Lieutenant to El-Cair the Babylonian Chalyph, Caire in Syriack^znd Brittifh fignify- ing a City.

The Name Bagdat (I fuppofe) is either from Bag-Deb, i.e. a Lordly Cityor from Bawt-dat, i. e. a Princely Garden*, for Bagdaden, t. e. Horms Eden, others fancy it. Hbwbeit, fome fay from Bagiafer the Babylonian Kalyph, who dif- burfed two millions of gold to re-edifie it after that devaftation which was made there by Almerick^ King of Jewry.

Let us now into the Town. Bagdat at this day fcarce equals Brifiol either for bulk or beauty *, albeit the circuit may be three miles, including about fifteen thoufand Families. Watered it is by Tigris^ which there is fomewhat broader than the Thames at London, but not fo navigable nor gentle. Scaliger fuppofes this to ht Seleucia, but is miftaken*, for Seleucia was 50 miles lower upon Tigris. The greateft part of the Building was by MuBafer the 52th Chalyph An. Heg. 520. removed to the Eaftern fide of theRiver. In the City is little more worthy of obfervation than the Bridge, the Mofque, the Sul tan's Palace, the Coho-Houfe, the Bu^zar and the Gardens. The Bridge refembles that at Rohan in Normandy, having paffage over thirty long Boats which are boarded and chained one to another and made to feparate at pleafure. The Mofque builded in the Weft fide of the City is large, round, and pleafantly raifed of white Free-ltone, brought down Tigris from M o[h I . The Sultan's Houfe that adjoyns the Buz.z.ar or great Market is large,' but low; and near it are fome brafs Pieces which the Turks brought thither or from Ormus when it was taken by the Perfians. A little Chappel alfo Panch-Ally by name is memorable by reafon of that imprelfion of five fingers which Mortis-Ally (quis hoc ere- datJ made in the folid ftone there. Coho-Houfes are Houfesof good-fellowfhip, where towards evening moft commonly many Mujfulmen ordinarily aflemble to fip Coffee: a Stygian liquor, black, thick, and bitter •, brew'd out of Bunchie or Bunnu-berries ^ more reputed of, if they hold to the old cuftom recorded by Herodotus, how that not a Woman here but once in her life time fat in Venus Temple : but moft efteem'd from a tradition they have that Mahomet fipt no other broth fave this which was invented by Gabriel-. Inthz Coho-houfe they alfo inebriate themfelves with Arac and Tobacco. The Buz&amp;ar is pretty large and fquare, the Houfes comely, and the Gardens fweet: yet all put together, are no way comparable to many late upftart Towns about her. Never- thelefs by having the ftamp of great Babylon impreft upon her, is by Travellers very much honoured-, and the memory of the old City gains this new one a due obfervance from all places of the Univerfe. Twelve miles lower towards Euphrates a confufed Mount is feen, which fome ima gine the rubbifli of Nimrod's Tower •, the rather becaufe flimy bricks and mortar may be digged out of it. I rather imagine this to be the mine of that great and memorable Temple lately mentioned ereded by S emir amis in honour of Bel or Jmiter Belus. At a diftance it is better perceived than when nearer hand *, the infenfible rifing all the way may occafion it. What more or more properly can I apply than that of Adonins in one of his Epig.

And notwith- Itanding the many mutations and miferies it fulfered, yet was it able to fmile upon Alexander when he extraded thence to pay his Soldats and fill his Bags with fifty thou- fand Talents in Bullion and nine millions ofcoined Gold.

The name Shuftan is much controverted. Athentus defines it from plently of Lilies^ but whence fetcht I cannot apprehend, the Arabic or.

The moft probable is, That Nile nor Ganges had no being there : the Septuagints mif- take arifing from their fuppofition that Vifon was Ganges and Gihon Nile, MefopotamU no doubt was Eaft from Arabia where Mofes (the firft that ever wrote Hiftory) about the year from the Creation 2430. compleated his Pentateuch.

Can I choofe a better place to feat your patience than here ? After the Death of fome The Gentlemen, my courfe came next, though not to die, yet to put my feet into the Grave. Authors Whether through cold I got on Mount Taurm (where I wantonly fuck'd in too much foknefs* cool air 0 or that I played the Epicure too largely upon fruit, or that diverfity ofMeri- dians, or fo long quaffing variety of water s might be the caufe, Icannotfay: butfomeor all of thefe (by Gods Appointment) upon our defcent into Media put me into a violent dyfentery ; fo as by continuance in that difeafe I waslike a Skeleton,and reduced to fuch weaknefs that I may be bold to fay fcarce could any man be more infeebled. I wanted not the advice and help of the Archi-ater,the Kings Dodor •, who albeit he was doubtlefs a ve ry skilful Phyfician, yet did me little good, fo malignant was my diftemper albeit I took what he prefcribed, (part of which I well remember were Pomgranad pills,Barberries,Sloes in broth, rice and fundry other things) and returned what he expeded: fo that it was hard to judge whether my fpirits or Gold decayed falter. In this fad condition and mifery I was forced to travel three hundred miles hanging upon the fide of a Camel in a cage r efem- bling a cradle. Morod the tAEfcdapm ofFerfia feeing I would rather dye than part with more fees, (for when it was gone 1 knew not where to borrow. Merchants were grangers to me, and I had above thirteen thoufand miles home by the South-weft of Afric,) limited my life to five days exiftence : But he that fits on high, in comparifon of whofe wifdom all humane knowledge is meer folly, in four and twenty hours after (as it were by miracle) prov'd this Oraculizer miftaken in his crifis. For I had then attending me an Armenian called MagarTixA a Tartarian woman who (fore againit my will) would for my recovery be of ten invocating her heathenifh Deities *, but finding they had no power, whether to ac celerate Morods fentence or to poifefs my linnen and apparel (of which I had good ftore) I know not but no doubt well knowing that Wine was by the Dodor forbidden me, Ihe neverthelefs in an agony of thirft prefents me with a Viol full of intoxicating Wine, which both looked and relilhedcurioufly, and I poured down no lefs infenfibly without' wit or meafure: but (as if Opium had been fteeped in it) it quickly banilhed my fenfes and put me for four and twenty hours into a trance •, fo as in that time (had not a- friend andfervant refitted) I had been buried alive, they thinking I was dead, Nam nec calor, mc fanguhy nec fenfus, nec -vox fuperejfet, as was faid of another in like condition. But through Gods mercy, this defperate Potion recovered me: For after I had dilgorged abundantly I fell into a dead fleep, (Natures nurfe, and as one aptly terms it the paren- thefis of ail our cares) not having done fo for a month before, the people admiring the operation*, fo that by the benefit of that little reft, and binding quality of the Wine, but chiefly through Gods mercy towards me, that body which was reduced to fuch weaknefs 1 and like a crazy rotten veffel leaky on all fides, was through mercy as it were new careened, launched out into the World again, and in few months become ftrong and perfedly re covered. Howbeit, my defperate Dodrefs (whiles my other fervants wept) when fhe thought me dead, opened my trunks and robbed me of my Linen and Moneys: For all which I would not purfue her, the Law is fo Itrid there againft Felony, elpe- cially in behalf of ftrangers.

Pfal.56. 13. Hh NowNoah's Flood, Th o/Babel. Ow concerning the Kings and other Princes ruling over this Empire in the firlt and fecond Monarchies of the World, it would require a volume to proceed in the method of an Hiftorian : but feeing the Chorography of thofe parts is what I chiefly aim at, I will onely prefent the Reader with a Summa ry of their Succeffions, inter-woven withfuch publick matters as 1 conceive mayfpeci- ally relate unto the places obferved in our Travel j and in that I fhall trace it to the firft 0r God perceiving that the wickednefs of Man was great in the Earth, and that all the imaginations of the thoughts of his heart were continually evil, repented that he had mademan, Gen. 6. 5. fo as by the flood of waters he deftroyed every thing in whofe Noftrils the Spirit of life did breath, whatfoever were in the dry Land: Noah bnely find- ing grace in the Eyes of the Lord efcaped in the Ark, together with his Wife, their three Sons and their Wives, being in all, eight perfgns. The face of the Earth was covered with water one hundred and fifty days, fifteen cubits above the higheft Mountains. la the feventh month the Ark refted upon the Mountain of Ararat. In the tenth month the tops of the Mountains were difcovered. Forty days after, Noah opened the Win dow of the Ark ; after which, in the end of the fecond month, Noah and all that were there (preferved as feed to replenifhthe earth) ifliied out*, and in thankfulnefs to the Lord and as an evidence of his faith he built an Altar, and of every clean Beaftand Fowl offered a burnt-offering thereon unto the Lord. God blefled Noah and his Sons, bad them bring forth fruit, multiply and replenilh the earth : the Sons of Noah were Semj Hamj and Jayhet ; jof whom the whole earth was over-fpread. Noah began to be an Husbandman, planted a Vineyard, and lived after the Flood 350. years , the whole courfe of his life was 950. years and then dyed, A. M. 2006. m Concerning Aram, and the place of Noahs Plantation after he forfook the Ark, I have elfe-where fpoken. In the fpace of a hundred and thirty Years after the Flood Noah, who is called Nodcchus, and Shifuthrm in Ahidenm-, having peopled the Orient, to the end the middle and more Weftern parts might be likewife planted and the World diflributed amongft his Chil dren, he gave feveral of them their million-, who accordingly travelling from the Ealfc came into the Vale of Shynaar (as far as the great River Euphrates,J where they refted: for they found that place fit for plantation. After which, as well to get themfelves a Name as for their better aflbciation, (or as fome imagine, for the better fecuring them felves from a fecond Cataclifm,) Nimrod by thirty Years inceflant labour of that great Company built a City and Tower whofe top they intended fhould reach Heaven, Gen. 11.4. But the Higheft perceiving their impious defign, defcended, and by confound ing their Language (for till then they were Pop aim unim lahii) made them delift, and from thence fcattered them abroad upon the face of the whole Earth : By which multi plication of that original Idiom of fpeech the place was called Bahel, in Hebrew and moft other Tongues, fignifying Confuiion. Now albeit this was miraculous, it might be well worth our labour to confider, whether Speech proceed from Art or Nature. The moft Learned agree that Arte humana &amp; non Nat my a loquela &amp; nomina rerum futit im* fofita, but I do not think that fubjed fit for this place. Soon after the Creation, Adam and his Children planted the World from Eden, reputed the Navel or Center of the Earthalbeit Strabo by his ftory of the two Eagles which begun their flight from Eaft to Weft and met at Tytho in Phocis, would have that the Mcditullmm \ fo Noatts Children near the fame place commenced theirs, thence diiperfing themfelves into the moft remote places. Sems pofterity chofe Afia the great*, Chams Africkj, and Japhets Europe : Al beit the Juchofm or Liber de generatione put^ifhed fcarce two hundred Years fince hy Abra ham Zacm a Jewifr Cabalift tells us ( but not his authority,) That the five Sons of Noah firft planted all that part of the greater Afia which is betwixt Euphrates and the Indian Sea, as far as Ganges. But of more certainty 'tis, that in Phaleg's time about three hundred Years after the Flood the World was fet out into partition: andastheir num ber increafed, fo were Colonies difperfed for better and more univerfal plantation. whether by reafon of his more than ordinary ftature and ftrength or (for Bero- fa reports him to be ten common cubits high, which make 15. foot) from the eminency of his birth, or elfe by confent of his brethren, ufurpt a Soveraignty over, is diverfely conjectured, but as an Eminent Writer obferves, Is primus eratqui cepit regnare fuper homines, ignem quoque adorare, the firft noted Idolater, and that prefumed to Lord it oyer his Brethren. Cyril contra Julian. 1. 4. afcribes it to Belm or Arbeit# . is Son, Arbelus vir arrogans, primus dicitur a fabditis accepijfe nomen Deitatis ; Howbeit m lacked and prophane ftory he is acknowledged the firft Monarch of the earth. For asNimrod, Belus, Ninus, Jjfyrian Monarchs. ; as the firifc Foundation of Bah el is attributed to him, fo is the firft Kingdome •, as ap pears by Gen. 10. 10. where 'tis faid, The beginning of his Kingdom was Babylon^ Erech, Accad and Calneh in the Land of Shinaar. And out of that Land A\hur (or as fome Tranfla- tions, Nimrod) went forth and builded Nineveh and Calah, which is a great City. This is he whofe name derived from the Hebrew Marad, renders him Rebellis contra Deum &amp; JSfaturam : He, who by reafon of his Tyranny became a Proverb, Qu'afi Nimrod robuflm Senator coram Domino. By Berofm called Nymbroth , by others Saturnm Babylonicm , whole Father was Chufo or Jupiter Belm ; and his Father Cham called Jupiter Chamon ^ agreeable to that of Tz.etz.a-, Reges omnes olim vocavermt Joves, &amp;c. And after five and twenty years rule as King, died about the year of the World 1844. his body be ing buried at Babylon fay mofl;, albeit one Author I meet with finds fome part of him at Perfepol /. To Nimrod fiicceeded Belm his Son, ftiled Jupiter Babylonicm-, Baal, and Bel, which in Caldee fignifie the Son, or Soveraign Lord. This Prince at the age of threefcore years gave place to Ninus who imitating his great Anceftors, added to his Empire Arabia, Armenia^ and thofe Countreys that verge upon Baclria : and to deifie his Fa ther Belus ereded his Statua in Gold, which he commanded to be worfhipped. This is the firft Idolatry any Storie mentions. After fifty years, S emir amis (the Daughter of Becreta an Afoalonite, her Father not known in Hiftory) being made his Wife, fo cap tivated his reafon, then in dotage, as prevailing that fhe might command the Empire five days, made fuch ufe of her power as within that time the King wasfent to his long home; fo as then fhe fwayed the Scepter without control: and being ofa mafculine fpirit fo greatly enlarged the AITyrian Empire that fhe not only added Ethiopia and Battria, but alfo the Eaft-lndies, Quo prater illam &amp; Alexandrnm nemo intravit, faith an old Hiftorian : but of that laft had little reafon to boail,feeing that fhe was (though unwilling ly) forced to a retreat over Indus by Staurobates'y in paifing which, all but twenty of that great body of thirty hundred thoufand Foot, and ten hundred thoufand Horfe, with near a hundred thoufand Chariots of War (as Ctejias writes) miferably perifhed. Never- thelefs, to recount the wonderful things together with the memorable conquelts fhe ef fected both at Babylon and other places, would be to repeat what is fpoken concerning this Virago in the late defcription otBabylon and other parts. Her Death (after forty two years rule) is varioufly reported ; fome affirming that flie was flain by her Son Ninus in his Fa thers vindication •, others, that fhe died a natural death •, or was metamorphofed into a Dove, which in her memory the Babylonian Princes bore afterwards in their-royal Banner or Enfign. Ninus her Succeflbr, by fome Writers called Ninias, and by otherfbme Zaneis^Mars and Amraphely is fuppofed to be that Prince whom Abraham overthrew with Chedorlaomer the Perfian King near Damafcmmthz refcue of his Nephew Lot, as recorded in Gen. 14.1. Chedorlaomer King of JLlam, i. e. Terfia, whether that was his proper name or given him from the Regal Tire or Garment he wore upon his head which was termed Ghedar orCydaris, or that he was calledfrom his duskie complexion, is doubtful: But more certain, he is that fame whom the Tznch. za\\s Cheyomarraz, Father to Siamech v to whom in order fucceeded Owchang, Jamjheat, Zoac, freydhun, Mamcher, Nawder, Afraciab, (whom fbme fuppofe Achemenesy) Baz.ab, Kay cob ad, Shelomo, Chozxao, Loraz*- pes, &amp;c. But being as yet inqueft of the Aflyrian line, return we to Ninus, who begun. his Reign A. M. 2000. andfinifhed it after thirty eight years Rule, being fucceeded by Arius, by fome called Thuras after whom followed feven and thirty Emperours, the laft of whom was Sardanapalus who begun his Reign over that gregt Monarchy A. M. 3124. but by all Hiitorians faid to be a Prince fo degenerating from the warlike Spirit of his great Anceftors, that he is ftiled Vir, muliere corruptior •, and not without reafbn, feeing he was fo effeminate, that he not onely wholly fequeftred himfelf from men, but gave himfelf up to the fociety of his Wives and Concubines, both in habit and exercife imita ting tjhem : A Prince that wanted Plato for his Tutor, who was fofar from Sardanapalus his opinion that Cratios egit quod mas fuit nonfcemina, thanked God that he was a-man and not a woman. So as it was not without difficulty that ArbaBus his Median Lieutenant ob tained admiffion into his Palace at Nineveh i where he found the Emperour moft delicate ly attired not with an Ornamentum Virile but in a Ladies drefs befpangled with rich Jewels and fpinningof Silk amongft the females. Neverthelefs, after due reverence fainting him with a Salve Domine Imperator, the Emperour returned him this puling anfwer, Ne me die Dominum prccor, ego emm fum Domina : At which, aftonifhed, the General withdrew % but fo diffatisfied, that fo valt a Monarchy and fo many Sons of Mars fhould be fubjeded under fopufillanimous a Prince, as he immediately founded the Trumpet of Rebellion, H h 2 and6 Miferable end of Sardanapalus. and drew Bdochm the Babylonian.

The Rebels quickened their march thinking to furprize the City, which (notwith- ftanding the Kings negled) was fo well fore-feen, victualled and man'd, but which was moft, commanded by fo faithful a Governour, that it not only bad defiance to the befieg- ers, but ilfuing out at convenient times, forced them fundry times to retreat to a fur ther diftance ; The City by this means held out upwards of two years •, infomuch as the confpirators defpaired of taking it; had not a luperiour Power who fets periods to all Dominions fodilpofed, that by the over-flowing of Tigris' (as foretold by the Prophet Nahum 1.8. and 2. 6.)' near twenty furlongs of the Wall fell (a Wall that was a hundred foot high, and withal fo broad, that upon the Rampire three Chariots might pafs on breaft, adorned with 1500 Turrets,) that great and unexpeded breach giving the Enemy defired entrance. The miferable Emperour then in defpair, retired to his Palace, and inviting his Women into the place where his Jewels and Treafure lay fets fire to it, where by all was quickly confumed, himfelf for company. Such was the woful Exit of that great Prince, who zsjuftm obferves. Hoc folo imitatm eft firum, in this onely Ad exprelt his manhood. The Coin then melted in that Flame is by confent of Writers computed One hundred millions of Talents in Gold, and one thoufand millions of Talents in Sliver ^ which in ours amounts unto Twenty thoufand and five hundred millions of pounds: a fum not parallel'd in any ftory, and incredible, did not the greatnefs of that Empire, and the long time his frugal predecelfors had been amalfiiig itp convince towards it. Thus this great Monarchy which had continued glorioufly commanding the World about 1350 years, had its firft though not ultimate period in a fuccelfion fromiVzw- rod: And being divided between the two great Captains, agreeable to their former Go vernments arrogated to himfelf and with the adjacent Provinces; (albeit fome give Ferjia to Achemenes Son of Perfes-, who contributed a confiderable alfiftance tothetwo other confpirators in this great enterprize, and from whofe loins Cyrm the great defcended, who afterwards fubjeded the Ailyrian and Median Empires under that of Terfta :) but Belochus took for his (hare Babylon and the Eaft of Ajfyria, Ni neveh included. ArhaBus (who in fome Authors is alfo called Arbaces) by this fall of Sardanapalus raifed to himfelf the Sovereignty of Media, and dying, was fucceeded by Mmdanes: but fome omitting him fay Sofarmus, who after thirty year's gave place to Medidus ; and he alter five and twenty fays Heylin, forty fays Raleigh, did the like to Car die as *, who after thirteen years rule bequeathed the Royal Scepter to Diodes, as Sir Walter Raleigh calls him, Dejoces Heylin : the difference concerning the time of whofe Reign is nolefs, the one giving him feventeen, the other fifty three years in Government. This Dejoces firft founded Echatan, fayes Heylin', by Dodor Vfter the reverend Primate reputed Arfhaxad whom Nabuchodonofor Hew in the Mountains of Ragan, lib. Judith c. 1. v. 15. Neverthelefs, I find that the diftance of time between Dejoces and Nabuchodonofor to be upwards of eight years : So that how to make Dejoces and Arphaxad one, is more diiH^ cult than to agree the Foundation of the Town, feeing Arphaxad is not faid to build the Town, but the Walls and Towers thereof, verf, 14. Now albeit the City was fadly plundered and defaced or demolifhed by the Alfyrian Emperour •, neverthelefs it was r ^ 1 !i e t&gt; in t ^ me ^ tmQ good Authors report that Daniel the Prophet re- edmed a Royal Palace for the King, which for elegancy of ftrudure and value of mate- rials was comparable to any other then extant. Dejoces dying A- M. 3291. was fuc- ceeded by PW^aaPrinceof great courage and fuccefs, who died before the Walls of tnevehy leaving the Median Crown unto Cyaxares his Son. Who during his forty years rule profecuted the Aifyrian War, and laid clofe fiege to Nineveh •, but was forced o witnaraw, having notice that a great body of Scythian Horfe had invaded his Coun- ey, and there relied: This was an un-expeded chance of War, and as Herodotus lib. 1. reports, aad no other way to recover his right, than by inviting the moft confiderable Field-The &lt;tAjfyrian z Field-Officers of the Scythians to a banquet, and picking a quarrel with fomc in their cups&gt; upon a lignal given by Cyaxares ail their throats were cut ? which was of that dread to the other Scythians, that they willingly found the way back again into their ownCountry, with this charader from Jufiin lib. i. Scyth* magis ebnetate quam hello-uin- cmtur. Aftyaves his Son upon his Fathers death was proclaimed, and with all due cere mony crowned King. Afiyages is mentioned in that Apocryphal Itory of Bel and the Dragon'-^ and by Ibme luppofed to be that great Prince Ahajhuerus who married Hejler the Jew, but the ground of that conjedure I neither find nor credit v feeing that by the .belt Authors either Barim Hyftapis, or Artaxerxes by the Greeks called Macrochyr, one of them was undoubtedly that Prince : Befides, the diftance of time betwixt thofetwo Kings is not lefs than an hundred twenty nine years. Of this Aflyages little is recorded, fave that for the richnefs of his Apparel none ever excelled him. His Daughter Manda- ne whom he had by Ariana his Wife, he gave in marriage to Cambyfis the Perjtan, Father otCyrus the great. AByages firft dreamed. That his Daughter made fo much Water as drowned ail Afia *, and another time, that the Sun being under his feet, thrice he pro- fered to embrace it, but ftiil it avoided him: Which upon the Aftrologers acquainting him that it related to his Grandfon Cyrus which fignified the Sun, he endeavoured (but in vain) the Childs deftrudion. To him fucceeded Cyaxares by fome called Darms the Mede : } whom Cyrus fucceeded A- M. 3406. To Be loch hs (now fettled in the Aflyrian Empire about the year of the World 3 146.) fucceeded Put Affur, called Tiglath Pilefar •, who in 2 Reg. 15. 29. is recorded to have ruined Galilee, one of the three principal Provinces of Canaan ; of which Province Samaria was the capital City; and carried all the inhabitants of Nephthali and Damafcus Captives into Affyria. After three and twenty years rule he gave place to Salmanaffer by fome called Nahonaffer, whoprofecutmg his Fathers defign plundered Samaria : and in the Reign of Ho fa a King of Jfrae I (who negleded the payment of his Tribute) after three years fiege took Samaria *, and the Almighty (being provoked by his people through their Idolatry and conforming themfelves to the Heathen that were round about them ) fo ordered that the ten Tribes were alfo removed out of his light, none being left but the Tribe of Jadah onely, 2 Keg- 17.18. thofe of the captivity were placed inand &amp;- hor by the River Go^an, and in the Cities of the Medes. This Aifyrian Prince after ten years rule was fucceeded by Sennacherib ^ who going to fight againll Tirhakah the &lt;^£thiopianKmg, in the way lent a blafphemous fummons to /Cmg Hezekiah by his Servant Rabjhekeh', for which, upon the Prayer of good He^ehiah and purfuant to the Prophecy of tfaiah, one hundred fourfcore and five thoufand of the Ajfyrians were in one night ilain by an Angel of the Lord; which made Sennacherib haften back to Nineveh, where worfnipping in Nifroch's Temple he wasflain by his Sons Adra-Me- lec and Sha-rezer who efcaped into Armenia, and (after feven years rule) Efar~Haddon his Son reigned in his ftead, 2^.19. 35. Efar-Haddon having taken revenge upon the parricides, by that confufion then happening between the two Brethren gave occafion to Merodachthc Governour of Babylon to rebel,and fucceeding therein depofed the King, and thereupon retransferred the Seat-Royal from Nineveh to Babylon, Merodach or Bcrodac Balladan as called 2 Reg. 20.12. fwayed the Scepter,of whom little mention is made, albeit' he raigned 4oyears,andleft the Imperial Crown to Ben-Merodach his Son •, who after 20 years gave \Az.QQ toNabop!loz,ar the Triumpher over Pharaoh-Necho the&lt;^£gyptian King,and at the end of 25 years was fucceeded by Nabtichodonofor,who byreafon of his many Vidories and triumphant Reign was called the Hercules of the Eait.This great Prince was the Gold en Head of that terrible Image mentioned in Dan. 2.32. To whom the Higheft gave a Kingdom, power, ftrength and glory, commanding not onely wherefoever the Chil dren of Men dwelt, but alfo the Beafts of the Field and the Fowls of the Pleaven were given into his hand as Ruler over them all, Dan. 2. 38. fo as it will be too great a labour in thisimall circle to enumerate his conquelts,- his vidorious arm fubduing where-ever it was extended ; ^Egypt he made a Province of his Empire-, Jerufalem hedeftroyedy and fired the Temple carrying Zedechias and his people prifonersto Babylon, thelaft of the four Kings of Judah, (viz. Manajfes, Jehojakim, Jeconias and Zedechias) who by the Affyrian Kings were led captive to Babylon. Syria and Arabia were likewife fubjed- ed under the ftroke of his Scepter*, and part of (^Ethiopia. The pride of he abafed, agreeable to the prophecie of Nahum 3.9. and Tob. 14. ult. flew Arphaxadznd fpoikdEcbatan. In a word, the extent of his Dominion was not ftraitn'ed within lefs bounds than the confines of the then inhabited World. But to particularize his many fumptuous and magnificent ftrudures, elpecially that at Babylon, would be no lefs tedious: For he not onely beautified old ^7/wz but* added to it a new City upon the oppofite fideTheJjfyrian Empire terminates. of the River which he inclofed with a triple Wall of Brick;' and for the delight of his Q ieen (whom fome name AmyrtU, fuppofed to be the Daughter ofthe Rms; ) andfor the recreation of his Daughter Nytocris (who in fpmt and noble bmld- in^s ftle afterwards made leemed another Semiramis) by. extraordinary coft and incredL bl? number of hands raifed fuch ftately Arches of ftone as for height and breadth feemed a Mountain, which gave a curious profped not onely over that mighty City and River but into the Country round about which was leve], and the horizon uninterrupted by any hill; fo that befides the delightful walks it had, he planted it with all manner of fruit and flowers, infomuch as it feemed a Paradife. Which, with the rich and ftately Palace he ered- . ed for his Royal Seat (reputed one of the Wonders of Afia^ and continuing perfed to Alexanderstlmz) begot fuch admiration in the King himfelf as occafioned that exprelfion, Is not thvgreat Babel which I have built, &amp;c. which boaft drew upon him the molt memo rable Judgment any ftory mentions, for feven years Ipending his time amongft favage beafts: yet through divine mercy reftored to fenfe and dignity, all the remainder of his life acknowledging Gods power moll Sovereign and Everlafting. This mighty Monarch after four and forty years rule paid Nature her laft debt and was buried in Babylon-, having Ml bequeathed his Crown and Scepter to Evil-Merodach a Friend unto the captived and in particular to King Jehojachiriy as we find in 52. 31. nevefthelefs, a Sun very unlike the Father; much of what the one by prudence and valour got, the other loft by want of judgment and too much pufillanimity : For, under Amafis revolted from him; Media by the good condud ot Afiyages^nd Pcr/ia by the lively fpirit of Cyrm withdrew from under his fubjedion', and marching with refolute Armies againft him, in the end deprived Evil Merodach both of life and reign j whom neverthelefs Balthazar called Beljhazzar in Daniel fucceeded, a Prince of that ty rannical and disobliging nature as rendred him no lefs contemptible abroad than hate ful at home: foas the period of that great Affyrian Empire which from Nimrod to this Prince had flourilhed upwards of 1600. years under a feries of fifty Monarchs, had its ultimate period. For Beljha^ar too fecurely and impioufly feafting a thoufand of his Lords, (thofeGold and Silver VefTels confecrated to the Lord, and by his Grandfather Nebnchadnezzar brought from the Temple at Jerufalem to Babylon being profanely uM by the King, the Princes, their Wives and Concubines) digito Dei, Judgment by interpretation was pronounced againft that miferable Prince, and execution immediate ly followed; for, the Medes and Terfians who then befieged the City entred forthwith and maftered Babylon, yea that night was Beljhanzar King of the Caldeans flain, and Darm the Mede (then about iixty two years old) fainted King, Dan. 5.31. Where we are to note, that this Darim the Mede as the Per fans call him, by the Greeks is called Cyaxares as we find by Xenophon : He was Uncle to Cyrw the Perjian, and obtaining the Diadem when he was old held it but two years, and dying ifTuelels, gave an uninterrupted admifFion unto the whole : For as we read in Ez.r. 1. 2. the Lord God of Heaven gave un to him all the Kingdoms of the Earth. And Heft. 1. 1. had his Empire extended from India to Ethiopia , which comprehended 127 Provinces. The fiege of Babylon theMe- 4 tropolis of the World may not be pretermitted without a little, notice.

But the pre parations that Cyrm made, made it appear he was in earneft, and that he refolved either to win the Crown or find a Grave: Accordingly with a confiderable Army of Horfeand Foot he paifed through Syria into Ajfyria, and without oppoiltion poifeiled himfelf of the two principal Seats of the Empire Babylon and 5/^, which made him believe the relt his own, and was no lefs the opinion of moit. Hovvbeit, at length, intelligence being brought that Artaxerxes was advancing with nine hundred thoufand men, it fomewhat altered his former apprehenfion. Cyrm neverthelefs prepared for fight ^ what he want ed of number was lupplied by skill. Both Armies being on their march, at or near Coonaxa (or as the Per fans pronounce it Koom-jhaw, about 4000 furlongs from Babylon^ came firlt in view of each other. The Generals having difpofed their men into fuch or der as they thought bell, quickly engaged: for many hours Vidory feemed doubtful. Cyrm for his part expreifed as much refolution as man could do : for fkft With his own hand he killed Artagerz.es a Cadduftan Prince, foon after made way into the thickeft of his Enemies, and perfonally charging Artaxerxes gave him fuch a teftimonyof his valour, that by the Enemy (who with a Ihout applauded the Fact) it was thought he had been flain: But the King being rather enfiamed thereby requited himfo with his Sword, that Cyrus had no further defire to engage the King. In fine, perceiving the Emperial Enfign (which was an Eagle of Gold) advance, Cyrm reiblved to put it to an iffue^ fo as too eagerly expofing his own perfon it happened that his Tiara or Regal Cap (which he wore as pretending right to the Crown) fell from his head •, which being obferved by Mithridates z Per pan Youth, with a boldthruft he wounded the Prince in the Face, fo that he was forced for fome time to withdraw out of the fight and towards night was accidentally and miferably flain by fome Pioneers Inhabitants of Coon-fha who by miftake fell into his naked quarter. In this expedition Xenophon the Hiflorian had command : but fo foon a$the whole Army fell into a rout, in defpight of the Ferfians he,made a fafe and memorable retreat through the Caddufians Country into Georgia and crolFed the River Pha/is to Trepiz^ond where he embarqued for Byzantium and thence with honour brought his Countrey-men into Greece. In this great fight many thoulands were on both fides flain ^ neverthelefs, Artaxerxes becoming matter of the field taking a view of thofe that were flain, amongft others Cyrm was difcovered by the long hair he wore: His head was quickly fevered from his body and prefented the King; and Mithridates to whom his death was imputed (albeit the King would have had the honour of it himfelf ) was high ly rewarded-, but foon after by the craft and cruelty of Farifatis the Queen-mother in a moft horrid manner put to death, as we find by Xenophon and Flutarch in the life of Ar- taxerxes *, who not fatisfied therewith alfo made Statira the Queen away by poifon, only for expreffing her deteftation of the fad. Amidftthe fpoiles it happened that Darim the young Prince light upon Afpafia a Lady of fuch extraordinary beauty that Cyrm upon the firft fight became amorous, and after fome difcourfe fo paflionately affeded that without her.he could not live. The aged King upon the report ot her beauty would needs fee whether Fame fpake truth ^ and upon view became equally captivated: fo as this unhappy competition occafioned a difference not to be reconciled 'twixt Father and Son. The King neverthelefs perceiving how extream- ly the Princes foul was endeared to her, and confidering that indecora fmt inma gave way to his Son,endeavouring all he could to abate his own defire •, which though fmother- ed a while broke out at lafb into fiich a flame that he violently feized her from his company, and pretending that it was in zeal, fequeftred her within the Veftal Temple of Anaya as they call Diana at Echatan. Which enraged the Prince ^ and being further heightned in his jealoufie by Terebates an Eunuch in near relation to the King, without the leaft con- fideration (finding no other way how to recover Ajpajid) he pradifes how he might • aflaflinate the King his Father in his Clofet; A Treafon of an ugly dye, and according to its demerit no fooner known but that the Confpirators were flain in the attempt, and the Prince himfelf (though Heir apparent) fecured, tried by a Council of War, moft ofwhich v^re Princes, condemned, and the fentence put in execution. Now ^Ibeit the King for his own prefervation approved thereof at firfl:, yet afterwards the lofs or fo hopeful a Prince fo overcharged his thoughts that in a languifliing condition it atiength broke his heart. Such was the end of this great Monarch after fix and thirty years Reign*, being likewife buried at Perfepolis in or about the year of the World 3 6o o.

In this unhappy Prince the Royal Race otCyrus the great took end, having ruled the Empire about two hundred and thirty years. 1 Bajroaszlheit of great power Wcis neverthelefs fo hateful to the fubjed by reafon of his trealonable pradifes that he faw it was in vain in his own behalf to attempt the Crown • lo that not knowing how to fecure himfelf better than by obliging his Friend he pitched upon Cctdomanm who at that time was Lieutenant of Armenia by Commiffion from the late King. Codomanus neverthelefs was of the Blood of Kings, and of fuch noted va lour and courtefie that it was no fooner propofed than generally approved of. Having the Royal Scepter in his hand,according to cuftome he aifumed the name the better to ingratiate himfelf with the people who had that name in veneration. This is he whom the Greeks call Vltimm Dariw, the Perfians Farvm or Covecheck^ from his mif-fortune rather than want of prowefs, in which and other Princely Vertues he was equal to any of the greateft Monarchs preceeded him. But the Supream who from his higheft Thrones dif- pofes of Monarchies and States as to his Divine Wifdom feems beft, fet a period unto this; as fore-told by the Prophet Daniel chap. 11. verf. 2. And in order thereto, albeit Philip the Father of Alexander fo foon as he could prevail with the Grecian States to be their Captain General had invaded part of thelefler Afia by Parmenio his Lieutenant Ge neral and Attains his Field-Marfhal, and laid a Foundation for Alexanders Profecution of the Per ft an War; neverthelefs, wasfooppofed by Memnon a Khodian Officer under Darius that Philip made but little progrefs in that Work: for the defign was laid afide upon that unhappy death of Philip who was flain by Paufanias a Macedonian Youth whom Attalus againft nature hadabufed, and being complained on to Philip receiving but a fleight return provoked the young man in a treafonable way to vent his paffion upon the King. So that it appeared, the overthrow of the Perfian Monarchy was clearly defign- ed for Alexander, Who no fooner had compofed his domeftick broils at home which gained the Son the fame reputation with the Grecian Princes and States the Father had, to retaliate the Perfian for the many invaiions and vexations they had given Greece, but principally to quench his, ambitious thirft and to give the reins to his boundlefs fpirit, he firft difpofed of his own Kingdom to Antipaters truft, and then diftributed moll of that he had amongft his Friends, giving this reafon to Parmenio, Spes fola &amp; Afia mihl [efficient. Inconfiderable was the number he raifed for fo great a task, not exceeding thirty thoufand Foot, five thoufand Horfe, and one hundred and eighty Ships ^ which never thelefs exprelfed thegreatnefs of his mind : yet notwithftanding in this is hot to be too much cenfured, feeing what his Army fell ihortfor number and bravery wasfupplied by courage and skill, moft of them being Veterane Souldiers who had received many ho nourable fears in the Wars under Philip his Vidorious Father, Vt milites &amp; militia Magiflri fiiermt : Whereas on the contrary, albeit Darius infinitely exceeded Alexander in num bers and wealth, and that through long peace and plenty moll of them were richly clad and delicately fed; yet withal were given over to luxury and grown effeminate. Alexander (whom the Perfians call Scander and Alcander) then croifrng the Hellespont 9 gave defiance to the Perfians by throwing a Dart. He landed without much oppofition, and had leilure to offer a folemn facrifice upon Achilles his Anceftors Tomb. The firft encounter he received was near the River Graniens which divides the Trojan Territories from the Propnotis in the Adrafflian Field: the more noted place this is,not onely from this fi rft battel witn the Perfians, but-for that Pompey the great at Stella near this place defeated Mithri- datesthe great King of Pontus^nd Tamberlane the like to Bajaz.et with his five hundred thou fand men, of which,two hundred thoufand loft their lives that day in the field. In this firft fight Spithridates the Perfian General performed the part of a gallant Commander •, never- thelefs,being flain the reft fled i Qmos terror e Nominis magis quam Armis vicit, faith Pint arch concerning Alexander. The Vidory was Alexanders^-, who in that fight expreffed fo much skill as well as valour, that the glory of the day was wholly his.

Faffing through Phry^u towards the Euxin, at Cordis, with his Sword he diflblved that Knot upon which the conqneft of ACm by Oracle was faid to depend. Darius by this time round the Maxim true That the meanefl enemy is not to be contemned,much more fo great a Souldier as the Macedonian : fo that at length he refolved in perfon to engage Alexander, ^ like him- feif advanced with an Army of three hundred thoufand Foot and a hundred thoufand Horfe according to Juftin, doubles their number. Concerning the method of his march Curtms and others give us this memorable relation. Inthe Van of the Army the Arch-flamen carried the holy Fire, attended by the Pneftsand three hundred fixty five Youths who were their relators all cloathed in red. Next followed the Chariot of Jupiter drawn by white Horfes, the Riders being apparelled in Scarlet and holding Rods of Gold in their Hands. After them came the Chariot dedicated to the Sun, which was attended by ten other fumptuous Chariots richly wrought with Silver and Gold. The Van-guard of Horfe was forty thoufand, confifting of feveral Nations and Habits. The Kings own Regiment of Foot which the Terfians termed Immortal were adorned with*Chains of Gold, their Coats imbroidered with Gold and Sleeves powdered with oriental Pearl. After which marched fifteen thoufand more fplendid than the former, apparelled like Women*, thefe were called the Kindred of the great King. Next whom rode his Life-guard excellently mounted and clad like the Servants of fo great a Monarch: and after them Darim himfelf, fitting in a triumphant Chariot which was of burnilhed Gold embellilhed with glittering Stones and fupported by feveral Gods of his great Empireupon his own head was the Royal Tiara, and the head of the Chariot refembled a Sumhrero de Sol, two Eagles fpreading their Wings over him ; on either fide were too little Pagotha's or Pillars, all being Gold fet with precious gems. Two hun dred Satrapa's or rather Princes of the Blood with rich Partizans went neareft his per fon. In the la ft place came Sifygamhis the Queen-mother, and the Wife of Darius, whofe attire was fo rich that it was not to be valued : they alfo were drawn in Chariots of Gold, with fifteen Cajua's ill which fat the Kings Children and Nieces, a large train ' of Perfian Ladies, with an infinite number of Concubines, and their guard of Eunuchs as richly apparelled as the reft attended them. Near thefe marched the Treafurer at War with his charge, which was fo great as that it burthened two thoufand Camels and Mules. After which followed two hundred thoufand Foot and fifty thoufand Horfe, but Seneca well obferves, that multitudo non hahet vim f ?d pndm. An Army fo nice in diet, fo rich in habit, fo different in language, and generally fo effeminate, as without doubt it was their very numbers they thought would amate that little force Alexander was in the head of, who though few, were little frighted with their enemies great body, and upon the defcriptionmadeof their wealth their courages were fo inflamed they thought it longe're they engaged. The fight was foon begun, and continued not long : for the Per fans more minded to preferve what they had, than to run the uncertain hazard of War uponfuch unequal terms, or to adventure their Golden Robes and Jewels againft thofe cou rfe defpicable fellows that with Iron and Steel advanced againft them.

The Treafure alfo was all taken ; but which was of moft note, his Mother, Wife, Children and Kin were prifoners, who ufed fhem like a noble Prince, for albeit they were of incomparable beauty, yet commanded he his affedion fo as they had not the leaft violation or difrelped given by any \ the Vidor alfo ordering that what Jewels they loft Ihould be forthwith reftor'd : yet the fpoils were many and rich, even to admiration. Amongft which I onely mention a Cabinet of Gold, thick fet with Diamonds and other precious Stones, which for mate rials and Art was reputed the beft Jewel in the World. Alexander taking that in his hand and Chewing it to Per die cos, pleafantly demanded what was fitteft to put therein ?

Which Words of the Hiftorian were true - jor the reputation of this battel quite broke the heart of the Per pan Nobility and fet the Imperial Crown upon Alexanders head: Who purfued the Vidory,forcing the remains of tMPerfian Army to dii^erfetbemfelves into divided quarters and fuch places where thev could find beft ihelter. Invitations alfocame from Provinces and Cities in moft places thereabouts to Alexander, to take what he had vidorioufly acquired by right of War. Jrbela was the firft that rendred, nigh which place the Battel was. Arhela built by • a City under 3 7'degrees, by Ttolomy called Arbelitu\ h^ Mercelling Canaahela\ is about fifteen, (fome fay five) leagues North from Nineveh, in that part of Jfyria Winch was then called Arrapachita fevered from Armenia by the Nyphates hills.

Alexander rapt with admiration beheld the Itatelinefs of the place, the height and ftrength of the Walls, the beauty of-the Towers, the many no- ble ftrudtiireS and places of pleafure all along the River Euphrates-, efpeciaily that incom parable Garden which was lupported by Arches, the greatnefs and cunofity of the Royal Palace, than which the World had not its fuperiour, that excepted of Terjepoh •, and no lefs magnifying the Temple of Belpts which Xerxes had defaced. Alexander gave immediate order for repair thereof: but having a little before fpoken more particularly of this place, I may not repeat. Neverthelefs,fuch contentment Alexander found here, that he Ipent more than a months time in banquetting and other excefs which had well-nigh vitiated the fpirits of his Countrey-men who had been educated after another manner of diet iuaftrid but wholfome difcipline of War. . T ,, . r At length, leaving the fuperintendency of the place with Ma^em the former Gover nour, the Conquerour marched diredly towards Shujhan i his way into Sufiana was through SittaceneandSatrapene, clofe by the Altars of Hercules which he viewed for the honour he bore that Heroe his emulated Anceftor. Into Shujhan he was received by Ahditesy according to his principle ftill adoring the rifing Sun •, who exprelfed little lefs ceremony in his entertainment thanhad formerly at HeretheTreafiirer prefented the Conquerour with an invoyce of his charge which was Nine millions of Gold and fifty thoufand Talents of Silver not put unto the mint as fay moft Writers; albeit flu- tarch mentions onely four thoufand Talents, and in Purple-filk from Tyre to an equal value. The pleafure of this noted place detained him longer than he intended at his firft com ing : for indeed, the curiofity of the Gardens and magnificence of the Palace were not to be parallel'd. Alexander at a Princely Banquet which he made his Favourite Ephefiion and Other prime Officers of the Army with feveral of the Per fan Lords, fitting in Danm his State which was of pure Gold molt richly fet with precious Stones, could not forbear exulting, that what he had long defired was now accomplifhed, viz.. to be Mafter of Xerxes his magnificent Palace.' And having here as at placed a confiderable Guard, he halted towards Ferfepolis, invited thither by Teredates the fearful Gover nour. By the way (as I noted in our paifage near Jaaroori) he was to march through theftrait called Vyle Perjidis, where Arioharcanes (a noble Perfian) gallantly defended thepafs with afmall party of well-refolved Per fans fo that Alexander after the lofs of more Captains than in the two firft Battels againft Darius, and many companies of Foot, was forced to find another way : At which the noble P erf an halting to Perjepolls in de fence of his Mafters right, was bafely refufed entrance by Teredates-■) fo that wheeling about, he immediately fought the Macedonian Vidor, in which attempt he found an ho nourable Grave. Perfepolisy albeit the gates were opened to give Alexander free leave to enter in a friendly and fubmiffive fort, neverthelefs, fuch was the fpight they bore this gallant place for the mifchief Xerxes had done in Greece, that the Souldiers were inconfiderately licenfed to kill and fpoil as they lifted. This was the Metropolis, the Principal Seat andI — ■ i»- . , ■— (jreatnefs of the Verjian H9 and Burial-place of the Terfian Monarchs. -No place in the world being put into the balance with this City would have weighed it down ; for after the Souldiers had loaded themfelves with three dayes plunder of Money, Plate Jewels 3 Images of Gold, and Bullion in abundance, the Conquerour for his fhare had a hundred and twenty thoufand Talents in coin: But not content therewith, he fet the City and Palace on fire, at the inftigati- on of an infambus ilrumpetnot worth a naming the fecond time •, Vrbem illam Regiam, tot Monarch arum altricem, totim Orientis mperatricem, Gracia et cater arum gentikm terrorem flammis miferrime incendit, fayes Munfler Cofmojr. - And not finding any fitter place to take a furvey of the Perfian Exchequer, which clearly appears by the feveral vaft fums ^ArWffrfeized in this itinerant War to be pro digious, fuffer me a little view, that it may evidence how properly the Perfian Kings arrogated to themfelves the Title of Rex Regftm, Dominofq^ omnium hominum^&amp;c. their annual Revenue being anfwerable to the amplitude of their Empire, which extended one way from the North fide of the Hellefpont to the River Ganges ; and the other way to the Jrx-PhHenorum and Countrey of the Garamants : lb as if onely from India they extraded yearlythree hundred and threefcore Talents Of Gold*, out of the reft of the 127 Provin ces how great mult be the receipt? for no kfs was yearly brought into the Exchequer fay good Authors than 40500 Talents of Gold, every Talent according to the Hebrew amounting unto 4500 pounds*, fo as the feveral vaft fums which Alexander diljpofed out of thefe feveral Treafuries may well be credited equalling ('tis thought) the publick reve nue of the Roman Exchequer, which in Augufim C&lt;efar's Raign,was 15 o Millions of Crowns as by fome is reported. Let it not then be loft labour to enumerate thofe fums as I find regiftred^ and probably agreed with the Accompt then given Alexander. At the battel otljfm Alexander took from the Treafurer at War 6100 Talents of coin deiigned for the pay of Darim his Army, and 500 Talents more in Bullion, unminted. What the Silver Talent was, is doubtful; For if it were the Babylonian Talent, that was 218 pounds*, if the Alexandrian, 375 pounds *, if the nALgyytian, 250 pounds*, (fori obferve th^t the Attique andEuboique with the Talents in different Kingdoms were not the fame, no more than was the Weight which had its equal variation, andfuchas hath occafioned fundry miftakes amongft Hiftorians.) At Memphis he found 800 Talents^ at Damafcus 2600. at Babylon 5.0000, at Ecbatan 26000. atShujhan 50000 un_minted and nine millions of Gold •, at Parfagard 60000. and in Perfejtolis 120000 Talents ^ or as Strabo reports (if he mean not rather the Total) thirty two millions feven hundred and fifty thou fand pounds: So that the 3 0000 Talents or eighteen millions of Crowns which Dariw prof fered Alexander with his Daughter Smira in portion, and the 10000 Talents for ranfom- ing of prifoners, would eafily have been paid, feeing that prodigious mafs of treafure Alex ander fent thence into his native Kingdom was fo great as loaded five thoufand Camels, and ten thoufand Mules. Moreover, feeing I am upon this fubjed, fufFer me to balance thefe .with other ftu- pendious fums I meet with in authenic ftories. Andfirft, concerning that which 5^2- napalm facrificed with himfelf in flames when Nineveh was taken by Belochus : It is report ed to be nolefsthanOne hundred millions of Talents in Gold and a thoufand millions of Talents in Silver, which in our money amounts unto twenty, thoufand and five hundred millions of pounds 5 fcarce credible, if the vaft extent of that Empire and arbitrary authority of thofe Rings were not confidered, and that it was foon after the golden age; and compared with what King David amaiFed together out of a far lefs Dominion: tor David (as appears 1 Chron. 22. 14.) bequeathed Solomon towards the building of the Temple One hundred thoufand Talents of Gold and ten hundred thoufand Talents of Silver, which in our money amounts to eight hundred fixty feven millions, three hundred eighty two thoufand and five hundred pounds fterling, or thereabouts. Marvellous it|is likewifs to confider where and in what manner Cyrw fcraped fo faft a fum together out of his Lieute nancy in the lelfer Afia fuch time as he marched againft his Brother Artaxerxes, being as Xenophon reports One hundred and five and twenty millions of pounds!. Now as in the firft I gave but one inftance out of the Tax that was yearly raifed from India', foin the laft I fhall onely mention ^gypt, which in Cleopatra's time brought every year into the publiqueTreafury Twelve thoufand and five hundred Talents of Gold, which according to our computation makes 7500000 Crowns; fums fo very great, as puts to filence that mafs of plate which was offered Pyzdrro a Spamfh Commander in America by Attahalipa the Peruvian King for his ranfome.

This done, the Conquerour gave order for thelnterrment ofthe enbalmed royal Corps*, which was done in military form and with as much ceremony and expreffions offorrow as was poffible : but Alexander being the principal mourner, by the fadnefs of his coun tenance fufficiently difcovered the anguifh of his Spirit: a generous compalfion h and fo well refented, yea having fo forcible animprelRon upon the Souls ofthe PerftaP Princes then attending the obfequies, as albeit the Countrey was formerly fubdu- ed, not till by thofe tears he fhed could he make an entire conqueft over their af fections.

Hereabouts it was,where they ihewed Alexander a moft ancient Monument, the Tomb of Cainan the fourth in defcent from Adam, who (as in the Jmhafmfol- 6.) reigned oyer the Indians of thefe parts before the Deluge. Here he conftituted his Argyrafttdes who had their Armour damasked and filletted with Silver. PomAlexander ovecomes Poms, &amp;c. 251 Form a valiant and powerful Indian Prince having notice that Alexander advanced towards hisCountrey (which comprehended a great part of what the Mogul now holds ' in Jndnftan?) waited for him on the banks of Hydaffes with a great body of Horfe and Foot and many Elephants of War where they fought, and gave the Greeks fuch tefti- mony of their valour that albeit Alexander got the better of the day it gave the Greeks ne- verthelefs frefh caufe to reft fatisfied with fuch Vidories as they had got, without fur ther hazard into the Orient. To put which out of thought and for their refrelhment after fo hard labour, Alexander let loofe the reins to all manner of debauchery •, for at the Mountain Maros he celebrated the Bacchanalia, and for fifteen dayes glutted the Army with thofe myftic fopperies. After which he forced his way through Deddala and Acadera, took by alfauit a Fort fcituate upon an inacceffible hill which could not be fubjeded by Hercules. After that Malaga and Nora-, principal places of ftrength in thofe parts ^ and with fome difficulty palfed his Army over Acefmes another branch of Indus, and then fet Foot in India 7 for faith the Hiitorian, Ad amnem Acefinem per^ensper hmc in Oceamm devehitur : which,I note onely tofliew that Indus and this River are'one in that ftory^ albeit indeed but a branch of; all which he apprehended his own by that little poifeffion. The confideration whereof made him acquaint his great Officers with his delign to penetrate as far as Ganges, which they feemed to approve of *, but being known unto the Army, the length of the way, theincreafe of heat, waited quarters, infinite numbers of Indians affembled ill their own defence, the difficulty of palling over Ganges (which was reported to be thirty furlongs broad and an hundred fathoms deep,) thefe and the like had fo vive an impreffion in their fancies, that as one and all by a general murmur they expreffed their difcontent: fo as finding that neither by threats nor promifes he could allay the mutinous humour of the Camp, at prefenthediflembled his thoughts and feemed to reft fatisfied, albeit foon after he made feveral Of them feel the weight of his difpleafure. The Horfe he marched through Patalena upon the Eaftern banks of the River Indus, the Foot in boats paft merrily down theftream until they came to that we now call Diu formerly Patala near the Tropic and in view of the Ocean: where drawing his Horle 'and Foot into a body heftraightway invaded the Countrey of the Oxidracans, ftormed the principal place of defence the Mallians had, and temerarioufly mounting the parapet and violently leaping into the Town to the amazement of the Barbarians, followed but by two officers, for a while fuftained the Darts and other Weapons the Enemy lent j and by that inconfiderate ad (if the Hiftorian fay true) had periihed, had not the Army as men defperate in his refcue enforced their fpeedy entrance. After which he fubjeded the Brachmans Countrey: and preparing for his march againft the more remote Indians affembled near the banks of Ganges the Camp broke out into a frefh murmur fo that albeit he ufed all^poffibie means to perfwade their further march, vehemently declaring, That unlefs they oppofed their fortune againft the nu merous but naked preparations about Ganges which gave them a bold defiance, they would retreat with fhame and (faith Vlut. vita Alexa?id.) all they had thitherto done was neither memorable nor thanks-worthy. Kotwithftanding which, the Army having the old Idea before their imagination, glutted with vidory, overcharged with rich fpoils; and tired with travel, and unable to endure the eixtream heat of thofe parts, firft they Ihewed him their white hairs and the many maims received in battels, and then with tears befought him to put a period to his conquefts and ambition: By which, they gave him caufe fufficient to underftand their unwillingnefs to fcorch their bodies which already looked like Mummy, any longer in thofe fiery Regions; fo that in fine, forced he was tocondefcend. Nor was it ill refolved , duly confideilig the great way they ffiould have marched ere they had arrived at Ganges, the intolerable heat they muft endure, the uncertainty of provifions, and lofs probably they might have undergone in an Enemies Countrey, who having no dependance upon the Terfian were not at ail ffiook by the fall of that Empire but rather as one man embodied upon the banks of Ganges ^ part of which , namely the Gangarida and the Prafians were reputed two hundred thoufand Foot and fourfcore thou- fand Horfe, befides eight thoufand warlike Elephants, all bent in his oppofal; withal, finding upon a mufter, that albeit in the fight againft Form and the Mallians his Army con- fifted of an hundred and twenty thoufand Foot and fifteen thoufand Horfe ? full three parts of that number were fince dead, part being flain in fight, but moft dying of flux and fevers occafioned through excefs of grapes at Nyfa and their other intemperance at the celebration of thefrantique Orgyes. Alexander therefore feemingly fubmitted to a return into a more moderate clime y and the rather, that he might be recruited with Kk 2 thofe t'jjl 11 HiAlexander admires thofe fifteen thoufand men he had notice were advanced as far as He there, nnon nublifiied his refolution to retreat, which was received with general acclamations ofioy i and after a months reft upon the sftuarium of the River /^ prepared for a march towards Ormus ; whiles the Conqueror himfelf, heedfully obferviug the flux of t ie River the fcituation of the Maritime coaft, and that large horizon the place afford ed, was infinitely delighted with the novelty, but efpecially with the profpeftof the c n Now give me leave to paufe a while, andconfider why Wo-had the Ocean in fuch admiration. The Ocean was defer vedly the fubjeft of his wonder: for the place of his birth, being fcituatenear the Theifalomc gulph which neighbours the Archi pelago without doubt gave him not only the profped of that but in the courfe of his cofiqueft had the view of other Seas, as the Mare de U Tana now Z ah ache y the Euxtne, the Mediterranean, and the Mare Cafrmm *, all which may well be termed Seas, although much inferiour to the Mare magnum or Main Sea, which is properly called the Ocean. The Mediterranean we find called Mare magnum the great Sea in Exodus, and in Jo ft. i. 4.^ Ton- . m Euxinm alfo has the name of Mare maggiore, and well deferves that attribute feeing it is well-nigh three thoufand miles in compafs*, fo great, as warranted Ovid and other Roman Poets to denominate all other Seas by that, as Omnia yonm, Nil nift pontm, And for the Cajpian, though by reafon it is every where encompafled with Land it indeed rather refembies a great Lough or Pond than Sea, neverthelefs from its greatnefs and other properties is worthily ranked inter Dei magnalia, and by Cofmographers in the Catalogue of other Seas: For Pliny terms it ingens *, and Maginm, Vafflum mare, a large and vaft Sea; albeit the circuit be ufually taken for little above a thoufand miles. And for the mare Tanais, or Pains Meotis, 'tis alfo great i feeing that from the middle part, Land can hardly be difcerned. So that upon the whole, I may conclude the Sea is great 5 for it is Congregatio mult arum Aquarum &amp; Oceano conjunttum, a collection of many Waters, andjoinedunto the Ocean: but comparatively, the difproportion is great betwixt the Ocean and the Sea: for, if I may fo refemble, fuch as Loughs are to the Sea, fo may the Sea be compared with the Ocean •, which is fo great, that in Gen. 1.-2. 'tis ftikd fades Abyjfi, for then it was an over-fpreading, Element, in extent and depth exceeding all other Seas; of which, four have moft properly the attribute, viz.. the Atlantick, the iEthiopick, the Indian and South Ocean. Albeit the Hebrews of old immenfam vim '&amp; congregationem aquarum Oceanum vacant: But as inVerf. 10. when the Waters were ga thered together unto one place, that colledion was then called maria. Alfo the circum fluent Ocean Vniverfam circum-amhiens Terr am on every fide furrounds the Earth, giving life both to all Springs and receiving into its Womb all Rivers, renders it inexhau- ftiblefrom whence it is aptly termed Fluviorum fontiumq-. Pater ;. by Virgil, Patrem rerum and by Homer and Orpheus, Patrem Deorum, Hominum, &amp; aliorum, the Father of Gods and Men, and all other things t ; for that in the conftitution of all fublunary bodies moifture is neceflarily required. Mela alfo calls it Immenfum, yaftiffimum, ac infinitum Pe~ lagus ; and Seneca that Nihil eft infinitum nec imperfcrutabile ntfi Oceanus. Nothing is endlefs, or bottomlefs, iave the Ocean. Moreover, as it exceeds the Sea for magnitude, fo doth it in depth for the Sea in moft places may be fathomed : yea, it is well known, that the deepnefs of the Sea ufually anfwers to the height of Mountains, which feldome exceed three miles perpendicular; but in our narrow Seas is fcarce found half fo much. So that albeit the Earth, as molt ponderous, be ordinarily alfigned the loweft ftation neverthelefs Solynus authoritative ly maintains, that the Ocean is deeper than the Earth : fo profound, that in a vulgar a£- ception, albeit erroneoufly, it is ftiled bottomlefs. For though in founding the nar row Seas they feldome fail of ground, 'tis otheftvife in the Ocean: and I very well re member, that in the great Ocean (inthemid-way betwixt the two great Continents of Afrk&amp;vA America) when we were for feveral dayes becalmed, the Captain of our Ship, to fatisfie hiscuriofity, one time let fall his Lead which had all the Log-line he could pof- fibly make or borrow, probably upwards of three thoufand fathom, and having veer'd it out to the very end could find no ground, fo as he would have perfwaded us it was abyfs; albeit that tryal gave no fuch confequence. I may obferve this further diiFerence: Albeit in our narrow Seas there is commonly a fiuxus &amp; refiuxus maris an ebb and flood, the Euxin and the Mediterranean have but their flux in moft places difcernable: for the one ftreams through the Thracian Bojphorm and Pro-yontis into the Archipelago, but both through the ftreight of Gibrafter into the great Atlantic Ocean, fic diclm oh velocitatem &amp; per interior a maria difcurrensfooui its bellowing near the Ihore by Poets ufually ftiled Tauriceps, and by Painters reprefented in that fimi- litude:The Earth and O litude: Neverchelefs, the Ocean where far from Land and when undiflurbed bv wind is flactdm m loco, m its own place ftill and pacifique ^ and yet it may not be de ny'd, That for the prefervation of its purity and the Life of its Inhabitants from corru ption it has both motion and internal aeftivation. So having fpoken this little concern ing the greatnefs of the Sea, forafmuch as Sea and Land make but one Sphere, give me leave to contemplate the Earth with like admiration Alexander did the Ocean. That the Almighty created the firft Chaos out of nothing is evident, Gen. i. i. and Wifd. 11« 14. which fufficiently convinces Arijlotle^^ fuppofcd widteria for out of th^t mafs both the heavenly and other elementary Bodies were conftituted and formed By the Fiat of the Almighty the fubter-celeftial Waters were feparated from the fuper- celeftial, fo that the third day the Earth was viiible, and appeared firm and diftinguiflied from the Waters v yea, in fuch a beautiful and harmonious manner, that both Earth and Water had their bounds: fo as the Water which at firft over-fpread the Earth was ga thered into one place, limited, and not fuffered to invade the Earth's proportion 5 Oc- cluftt Mare valvar He fhut up the Seas with doors dicens.

T err am fiifpendit fuper nihilum, the Earth he hung upon nothings with which that of the Pfalmift differs not, Terram fandavit fitper Maria, He founded the Earth upon the Waters; the Waters compaffing the Earth and mixing with it in the moft intrinfique places : whence probably it is Thales Milefim was of opinion that the Earth'floated and was aptly refemblable to a fhip fwimming in the Water. Now whereas Solynm maintains That the Ocean is larger and deeper than the Earth as I lately mentioned with an experiment, we are to underftand that the terreftrial Sphere is a globe or round body comprehended within the fuperficies of the Earth and Water; which though by fome fuppofed to be equally difpofed, nay by the Ancients who comprifed the Earth within an hundred and eighty degrees of longitude, had attributed fcarce one half of the Sphere, that dimenfion is increaled very much fince Land has been difcover'd within the Polar circles, and by the addition of that vaft Terr a firma in America. And albeit Scaliger in his 38 Exercit. is of opinion. That were it polfible to level the Earth by fpreading the lofty Mountains and rfiaking them even with the plain ground, the Water would be over-fpread and have no place *. Yet he acknowledges That the Earth and Sea by their various windings mutually imbrace each other j the one orderly and indifferently fetting bounds unto the other. Which Rec. Cof. lib. 4. exceeds in averring that the Earth is ten thoufand times greater than the Sea •, an hypothefis very much dif fering from moft Cofmographers *, and what authority he has I cannot apprehend, un~ lefs he take that for his guide we find in the 4. lib. Efdras chap. 6. verf.47. where it is faid, That the Waters were gathered (at the Creation as I fuppofe) into a feuenth part, fo that fix parts of the Earth were kept dry. Which for that it is apocryphal how far it may be fide dignm credited for truth, 1 leave to better judgments than my own, and in reve- % rence to the Author forbear further to queftion. But how difputable foever the dilproportion be betwixt the Earth and Water as to magnitude, the profundity or depth is more fatisfadorily deminftrated. For notwith- Handing the Ocean be ufually ftiled bottomlefs, and in the deepeft parts(which may be prefumed where it is broadeft) albeit there are riling grounds and Mountains in the O- cean where the plummet or lead may touch, yet in other places I believe it is not, or at leaft never hitherto has been fathomed. Howbeit the jiadgment of moft is, the deepeft exceeds not thirty miles; an uncertain conjedure, but commonly taken from that fimile of anfwering to the height of Tenerijf or other the higheft Mountains: yea, grants ing that the depth were an hundred nay a thoufand miles, yet will it not adequate the craifitude or thicknefs of the Earth, whofe diameter is acknowledged to be feven thoufand and two hundred miles, allowing the circumference to be one and twenty thoufand and fix hundred: nay, it will fail fhort of the femi-diameter, feeing that from the center to the fuperficies of the Earth are reckon'd three thoufand and fix hundred miles which as to depth clearly gives the Earth the fuperiorityand in comparifon of which, depth in the narrow Seas is very inconfiderable; being evident, that the log-line in moft fhips when veered out, ufually finds ground as 1 have fometimes obferved, and find likewife reported by Prifcian concerning Julm Cxfar, who for his private fatisfadion fathoming the Seas, found it not exceeding thirty fiadia which make about three miles and a half ZngUfij ^ although Solynm allows 54 ftades, which almoft doubles the former. - NowZ54- Alexander'/ Now in this parallel though I have noted a feeming difference in thofe two, they ne- vprchelefs a^ree in one center, for Earth and Water are concentncal, the center be ing an imaginary infenfible fmall point fixed in the mid-part of the Earth, from whence heieht is to be meafured rather than from the fnperficies of the towring Earth or fphe- ricitv of the fwelling Water, though both are pradifed But the more to admire this wonderfal Fabrick, and thereby to glorifie the Creator, fuch as the center is to the Sphere of the Earth, the great Terreftrial globe is no other when it is made the center of that vaft immenfurabie circle of the celeftial motions, comprehenfive onely by him who is infinite and incomprehenfible: Ciijm antrum efl A circle w-hofe center is every where, and ilo where his circumference.

The boundure of Alexander's march into Indiahdng in the tradobfeure, I take leave alfo to offer my own apprehenfion in Ihort concerning it. Hiftorians fome fix his Ne plus at the River Indus •, others at the River Ganges : there is not any leads it further that I meet with. Now for his penetrating India as far as Ganges, if he went fo far (as no doubt he did in his deVire,) oft-times faying. ThatCaucafm and the zy£modian Moun- tains(named fo from Elmodad Son of Jotojihould be the limits of his Dominion *, having likewife fundry times exprelfed his emulation of Bacchus and Hercules whofe Pillars rai- fed near Gihralter and Babylon, he had heard were ereded further upon the Eaftern banks of Ganges ; and for Bacchus, that he pierced both intra &amp; extra as far as China , where he ereded two Pillars upon the Emodian Mountains as a Trophy in memory of his Eaftern Conquefts: Thus taken notice of by Dionyfm, Hxc Sc Thebani CionyG terra colunuus This onftrat, ad Oceanum atq^ extrerni littora Ponti The Columns of the Theban Bacchus (hows, Montibus Indorum, qua vafto gurgite Ganges On ttf Indian Mountains fet, where Ganges fweeps In mare fe volvit Nylfeamq; impuiit undam.

If Ganges was the boundure, then probably is march was foon after the Battel with Vorm, and his neareft way as Men now travel was twixt and Agray where the River Jeminy at Fraije ftreams into Ganges: hut 11 ne palt dowa Indus as Arrian puts us out of doubt, then his way was W Cmhaya by Am ad avad,Extent of Alexanders /.madayad, which made it near a thoufand miles e're he could attain the which is not improbable, that thereby he might have a view of his Navy,whichasmoft imagine failed little beyond Swattey roadorCWi near which place is a valt Cave cut by great labour out of a Rock, which after Ages held facred: Under it is a Spring of frefti Water very deep. Some name this place A which as relates is beau- tified with many Statuas, and fuppofed the work of JLlexandery who ( as Arrian in his feri^lm obferves) made many great intrenchments, and ereded fundry Temples, Altars and other matters of admiration, meerly to preferve the memory of his Conquefts in thofe remote parts for future Generations: albeit the diredion Alexander gave his Ad miral feems to inferr that fome of the Fleet adventured as far as the Gulph of BemaU • for he commanded him to feta compafs about and to leave India upon the right hand which he could not do without doubling the Promontory called Ca^e Comrhyn, as we read in Tint. Jfita Alexandria And by the relation which Onefecritm gave may be thought that he difcovered Taprobane. So that if the Fleet onely coafted as far as Chanl, or Goa, or Cocheevy or Galliciit y in returning they muft confequently leave the Indian coaft upon the right*, but the diredions he gave to compafs about has a greater latitude, andfeem- ingly a contrary fignification. Befides, when Nearchus failed to the bottom of the Per- pan Gulph (leaving his Fleet near Balfora J he found Alexander difporting himfelf a little before his death upon the Euphrates, and amongft other ftrange things which he then related, mention is made of an Hand that had plenty of gold which probably was Tapro- hane. But this inqueft being to difcover the extent of Alexander's march, I jfhall onelv follow that. THny writes that Hypafis India fluvim Alex, fmt terminus. Now to find that River is no lefs difficult. I fuppofe it is the fame which Fhilojlratm vita Apoll. Thian. mentions in that memorable expedition Bacchus and Hercules made into thofe Oriental Countreys when they Were oppofed by the Oxidracans, people inhabiting between the Rivers Hy- phafis (the fame no doubt with Hypafis, though it want the afpiration) and Ganges, being by ( artificial) thunder and lightning forced to retreat. This mofl underftand to be Ord nance, which the Eaftern world pretend to have had the knowledge of many hundred years before Swart the German Franciscan Fryar in his Chymick Experiments invented about the Year 1330. Hypafis in my opinion is no other than Hydajpis now called Hy~ rot is, and Bodafpi the fame which Straho calls Hypanis, Vltra quam Alex, progredi non an- fm eft, beyond which Alexander marched not: but Vtolomy in his 10 T ah. Afia calls it Bi- bafis, and from Imaus makes it flow into Indus fuh 35 degr. And the ignorance we are in concerning the Oxidracans Countrey makes the queft ft ill more dark-, for that they were of India is evident: Albeit fome there be that place them amongft the Oxiani in Mergiana, the Oxiatri in Scythia, and the Oxidranca whom Ptolomy finds inhabiting near the 5^'^ Mountains in the latitude of 46 degr. Therefore feeing in the Life of Ale xander, that fighting againft the Oxidracans, from the Parapet Alexander gave a thun- dring leap (asPlutarch calls it) into the Town, and amongft the thickeft of the Enemy expofed his fingle Perfon for a little time, and notwithftanding the admiration the Bar barians were in of his attempt had perifhed, had not his Men (fearlefs in that exigent of the greateft danger) to refcue their General taken it by ftorm: though the Name dif fer, the ftory does not from that already mentioned againft the Mallians. Now that the Mallians or Mailt are thofe we now call Malua ( not much varying in the Name ) 'twixt Indm and Goujurat, 4s apparent: which granted, then it will follow that Alexander was not fo far Eaft as Ganges, albeit Craterus his Favourite and of great.Command in the Army, in a Letter which he writ unto his Mother Ariftopatra then in Gracia concern- ing their march, reports that Alexander was advanced into India as far as Ganges : with which Lncan feems to agree*, for having fpoken of Ganges in lib. 3. he fubjoyns. Here Alexander flopped, being taught to find, Hie, ubi Pelkus poft Tytheos xquora Dudof T'he World was larger than his boimdlef mind* Coaftitit, &amp; magno vinci fe laffus ab orbe And in the 10. lib* by like Poetical authority fpeaking of Alexander, 7 Mongfl thofe ftrange floods that bloody did appear j ignotos mifcuit amnes The Perfian 'Phrat, and Indian Ganges were.

I anfwer, 5 Tis true at this day that ' place is fo named ^ but of old fo was all that about Gallicut and Narfinga ) where the cu- Itoms of the old Indians are as yet retained •, yea, in Alexander's time the Countrey about Cambaya, Diu, Brampore, and all the Indian coaft from Indus to Cape Comrhyn were Brachmans Ql Gentiles. So that Alexander in fubjeding the Countrey about Choul and Baroch may properly be faid to fubjugate the Brachmans Countrey. Befides, upon the difcontent the Army exprefTed when given out that Alexander intended for Ganges we find that returning he was quickly in Gedrofia which Indm wafhes. Sir Walter Ra'leigh alfo obferves, That the Indian Kings he had fubdued informing him that Agramanes was a molt puiffant Prince and commanded many Nations beyond Ganges, Alexander was in flamed more than ever to undertake the conqueft of that great King; but for all the art he could ufe was not able to perfwade his Army to march further Eaft or to adventure over thofe yaft deferts 'twixt Indm and Ganges: onely prevailing with his Men to follow him Southward, the River Indm guiding them to the Ocean: and thence by Gedrofia re turned towards Perfia in the way to Babylon. So that upon the whole, to me it is moft likely, his furtheft progrefs was not much beyond the River Indm the me/im inqd* rendum I leave to others, and return to Alexander. 1 Alexander having given his Admiral inltrudtions to furround not onely Arabia but Afiickj it feems that rodomontade was more to exprefs the greatnefs of his mind than to exped the poflibility of fo great an adventure •, and by the courfe Nearchm fteered which was up the Per pan Gulph appears no lefs: For Alexander in the mean time conti nuing his march came before a City which Amhiger had mann'd againft himand after an atfault took without quarter to the defendants, for (to the great terror of the Greeh) they had their weapons envenomed fo as fuch as were wounded hardly efcaped, and a- mongft others Vtolomy (after Alexander** death King of vEgypt) miraculoufly cured by vertue of an herb Alexander dreamed he faw in the mouth of a Serpent. There he laid the foundation of Karcey the laft of feventy he built in that his nine years Government: there alfo he paid his vows, and fupplicated his gods that no mortal Man might exceed the bounds of his conqueft: alfo as an everlafting monument of his fame, andtoamufe fucceeding Generations, or rather to fhew he was a Greekgti whom 'tis faid. Ex mnfca foire faciunt Elephantem, he caufed Armour, Bits and Mangers^to be made of an extraordi nary lize and height; by this artifice of reprefenting things greater than indeed they were albeit of admiration to limple fpedators in after Ages,to the Ingenious neverthelefs they gave juft caufe to have the truth and reality of his great atchievements fufpeded ^ a fit requital for fuch a delufion. He alfo ereded twelve great Altars as high as Towers which he dedicated unto Hercules^ fuch as not onely attraded thofe in after Ages to admire but to adore; and amongft others the Per pan Kings, who for fome Generations thereprefented their accuftomed Oblations: which had they been upon the banks of Ganges would have been too far a progrefs, Indm being the terminm of their following Empire.

Howbeit, up on further examination the fraud being difcovered the Eunuch had the like reward, and his rich Houfe and furniture were given Perdicas, eftimated at fix hundred thoufand Crowns. There Calanm the Brachmati, in contempt of death, and to fhew that life is but jomnium umbra brevijfmum built his funeral pile, predided Alexander's death in Babylon 5 and taking a folemn farewel of his acquaintance in the Camp, according to the Indian mode, burnt himfelf to aihes. Alexander after that returned to Sajhan, and married Statira the Per fan Princefs, whofe Sifter he then gave to his dear Epheftion *, and other Perfian Ladies to as many great Offi cers of his Army. For the greater magnificence of which marriages he prepared a mofl; ample and royal Feaft for nine thoufand Guefts, to each of which he gave a Cup of Gold toufe in their Sacrifices ; and as a more abundant teftimony of hislove to the Army, as well as to exprefs his own greatnefs, he difcharged out of his own Treafury the debt his Souldiers had contracted, which amounted to nine thoufand andfeventy Ta lents, being in ours five hundred Millions and feven hundred thoufand Crowns: eafie for ^ArWer to fpare athis death, (which foon after happened) having found coffered up at Babylon an hundred thoufand Talents, as Juflm reports, in ready coin, which lome others double, and his Revenue at that time being three hundred thoufand Talents fer annum. Neverthelefs, having feme apprehenfions of fear in going to Babylon, (for fun- dry Prophecies were rumoured that he fhould dye there) he turned with his Army to wards the North, and came to Ecbatan j where his Favourite £p^//w;,notwithftanding * his Phyficians utmoft care, dyed of a Feaver *, whofe death Alexander fo paffionately be wailed, as Juftin taxes him that contra deem Regtum din luxit. But for the greater folem- nity, for feveii dayes a general howling (in which the Prafic* expreffed their Art fuffici- ently) was made ; all the Horfes in the Army alfo were fhorn, the battlements and walls of Houfes thrown down, Inftruments of Mufick put under filence, as not theleaft noife appeared: yea, to complement the Conquerour, the facred Fires in each Pyrese were by the Surena extinguifhed: a Monument laftly was ereded, upon which was ex pended twelve thoufand Talents, which is feven millions of Crowns : and having offered up his afflidedDodor as a Sacrifice (for which is worthily reproved) the Al tars were made to fmoak with Incenfe and the dead Corps worfhipped as a Deity, the higheft Honour he could afcend unto. Now whiles thefe Obfequies were in hand, Alexander had notice that Ambafladours at tended him at Babylon, not only from Carthage and other African parts, but alfo fromfe- veral Kings and States in Europe * namely^ Spain, Sicily, Prance, Sardinia, and moft parts of Italy, Rome excepted *, which though but growing to what it afpired of Caput Mundi, yet being four hundred years old from the foundation laid by Romulus, was then fo great that, as Plutarch reports, it could fet out an hundred and thirty thoufand warlike Citi zens. Thefe came to congratulate his fuccefs in the Eaftj to divert his journey Weft, and to crave his Alliance: yea, Adeo Vniverfum Terr arum Orb em Nominis ejus terror invaferat, ut omnes Gentes 'veluti deflinato Jibi Regi adularentur, being become fb terrible to the W or Id, as all Nations courted and feemed to acknowledge him their Soveraigii.

The accefs of thofe extraordinary Ambaffadours from the furtheft occidental parts, (Imay fo fay, feeing the Morini in Picardy are by Lucan called Extremi Hominum) thefe, or rather his inevitable fate accelerated Alexander's remove to Babylon *, which being near, ; the Caldean Magicians interpofed and prevailed with him to turn afide for fome time to Birfa beyond Euphrates, whence, by Anaxarchus the Philofopher, who derided their Arts, 1 he was induced to return to Babylon, though not without iome bad Omens at his entrance, 1 which neverthelefs was as fplendid and great as Art and coft could invent. After Audience given 3 Summons iffued for the holding a Parliament of no lefs than the whole World; and entertainments as fumptuous as luxury in the higheft degree could fet forth, took place: during which, this great Conquerour having delivered to D^Ws Ring, with which he fealed all his Commiffions and Difpatches, he dyed: Qui (zs Juftin cum nul la hoftium unquam congrejfus eft, quern 'non uicerif, nullam ZJrbem, quam non expugnaverit *,■ nulUm gent em adiitf quam non c ale aver it', Deniq^ ft ore lAEtatis fua ac Viftoriarum, non vir- tute hoftili fed frauds &amp; fmrum infidiis ereptm eft.

But this judgment fome impute to his feverity againft the Chriftians whom he cruelly perfe- cuted, and for his inhumane broiling that blelled Martyr S. to death, which him in his Ecclefiaftical ftory at large mentions.

Howbeit Trehellim in GqUicano affirms that Sapores was flain by Odenatm the Palmyrian King, Divine Juftice fo direding, in the felf-fame place where Gordienus was murdered. Hormifda reigned after Sapores : the Perfians call him Kirman-jhaw, who ruled thirteen months *, and after him Kararanes three years. Narfes (ICend-gird fay the Perfians) fol lowed him, who after fixteen years left the Crown to his Son Vararanes 2. firnamed Segmenfe : the Perfians call him Bafar an. He after a few months gave iV^r/w (albeit an alien) leave to fucceed. This Narfes with allpolfible rage profecuted the War againft the Armenians and Mefopotamians in whofe aid Galerius the Roman General fought with bad fuccefs at firft, yet trying the fecond bout, was Vidor which fo difanimated Narfes, that in the height ofdefpair and impatience he burnt himfelf, after eight years Government. Misdates reigned feven years after him: after whom came Shapores or King PorHSj by Teixera called Shahur , by Schicardus XahulXahnlketaph (in Spaiiijfib the Li 2 iTisz6o Julian the Apofiate's X is founded as our Sfc.)

Ju the Apoftate raged not more againft the rhriftians in the lefler Afia than Savons did at the fame time againlt them in the great; the Jews aggravating the King by perfwading him that the Chriftians were unalterable in their loyalty tothe&amp;w»&lt;»a: foas inten years, viz.. from the year 337- t0 347- hemaf. facred above thirty thoufand Chriftians as reports ; it being the pra- ftice of thofe primitive Chriftians in all the time of their perfecution, to oppofe the Sword of thofe under whofe jurifdidion they lived with Evangelical tortitu4eand vanquilhing patience: the Churches Arms then being no other than Prayers and Tears, and of fufficient advantage againit the Enemy, reaching no lefs way than into Heaven: yea gracioufly fubmitting their caufe to the good pleafure of God, albeit in his difpenfation and as a Symptom of hisdifpleafure his ftrokes are as to hu mane apprehenfion towards all forts of men undiftinguilhable, as with an equal hand affliding the innocent with the nocent, but with feveral operations. And albeit this Apoltate Julian-) Sapores and other Tyrants by the horrid Malfacres they made, thought to have deftroyed the very memory of Chrift, and to obliterate every fentence of holy writ, they found that the Martyrs Blood was verily the Seed of the Church*, according to that old Verfe, Sanguine fmdata eft Eccle/ia, Sanguine crevit, &amp;c. In thofe dayes the Oriental, parts for the greater part embraced Chrill *, in Socmen you have the particulars.

Anno Domini 380, leaving Artaxerxeshis Brother to rule after him ^ who in the eleventh year of his Reign gave this world a farewel. Sapores after five years followed him in that inevitable path ; Varmes firnamed Cermi^at him after ten, Tez.dgird a conftant Friend unto the Romans fucceeding him; who (as Socrates Scholaft, reports) was converted by Maruthas Bilhop of Mesopotamia^ fent into Verfta to that end by Pope Innocent and Theo- dofim the Emperour, by whofe perfwafion he deltroyed the Pyree or Idol-Temple, and extinguifhed that Fire which for many preceeding generations had by thofe Gentiles been heathenifhly worlhipped. The Perlian ftories give out that he apoftatized j who can tell the truth? However, this is certain, that in the twentieth year of his Reign Anno Dom. 426 he died i and Varanes 4.

By fome this Prince is taxed for perfidie and cruelty, efpecially againft the Chrifti ans : in whofe defence Theodoras junior fends Artaburus with a gallant Army. Vararms diffidinginhis own, requefts aid from Alamandurus an Arabian Saracen : whofe Armies when they met were fo numerous that they covered the Earth for many miles.

This Prince made truce with Martianus the Empe rour, and died in the feventeenth year of his Reign. P erodes fncceeded him, called Pheruz. by the Per flans ; a Prince more ralh than valiant: in the twentieth year of his Reign the Wars of Scythia made an end of him.

In Fhosmcia alfo he ads more mifchief: there he violently forced Euphemia a Chriftian Lady, and of her begot Hormifda who fucceeded him. He alfo compelled the chaft Nymphs of Daphne to offer incenfeto him as a Deity, which they did, but with this excufe fearing he would have raviflied them. He then confumed the ftately Temple dedicated to Saint Michael the Archangel, accountings no facriledge to rob Churches. After this hebefieged Sergiropolis , but being forced thence with dilhonour he attempts the fpoil of Jemfalem : yet hearing that BeMzarim (in his time the moft rich, and after the pooreft of men) was approaching, to avoid that ftorm he renews his League with the Romans never purpofing to keep it ^ for next year with a great force ofHorfe he fomges Armenia, and then Phoenicia, where he killed Narfes, Anno Dom, 556.

At this time the Armenians received the Chriftian Faith 5 the Romans about the fame time received complaints from the Chriftians of Cozshoes cruelty. Jnftin the Emperour fends Tiberius (eleded C&lt;&amp;far) to relieve them: His Army was great, and confifted of many feveral Nations, as French, Italians, Feonians, Illyrians, Myfians, Ifaurians, tkc.

At Antioch alio was over-joy'd with a Vidory he obtained againft the Chnflians: which encouraged him to over-run Pale fine, and in hoftile manner to enter Jerufalem', where he derided Zacharias the ve nerable Patriarch, the more to vex the poor Chriftians inhabiting that once holy City * then he raviflied the Crofs from thence, and brought it unto Shyraz., where for fome years it was forcibly detained. After that he fubjeded uEgypt and part of Libya ; yea, made the black-fac'd Ethiopians admire his frenzie. The Roman Empire not without caufe were troubled, when they felt his wrath in Ana tolia, chiefly in Ancyra the Galatian Metropolis. 'Tis reported how that in this frantick out-breaking he maflacred not lefs than three hundred thoufand Chriftians ^ partly oc- cafioned by the Jews who followed the Camp and paid ready money for many, whom (as ftory fays) without mercy they flaughtered, Heraclim having his hands full elfe- where, fent feventy Roman Gentlemen to treat of peace: Saes the Perfian General - puft up with fuccefs, accounting them no better than Spies, in favage fort made them return again, which Heraclms relented as fo high an indignity that with a choice number of Men he fought with Saes and had the Vidory: Saes for his ill fuccefs was by Cofrhoes command flayed alive, and Sarharas made General in his place. Heraclius in the interim wintered in the Pontique Regions, whilft Sarbaras with a great Army of Horfe pafles through Cilicia and one Moon-ihine night aflailed the Romans whom he thought to have found unprepared in their Quartersbut by that hafte loft 50000 of his Men, which gave as it were new life to the drooping Chriftians. Cofrhoe not content with this, next Year fent Sarnabajfa againft the Roman Army, but the Romans having other work nearer home, Heraclim defired a Ceilation : Cofrhoe not confidering that War is the effed of God's offended Providence^ but rather fuffering his Reafon to be inflaved by a revengeful paffion vows never to give himfelf reft until he had exercifed the utmoft of his power'to exterminate the Chriftians, notwithftanding he had many that lived inoffenfively under his Empire and Government: to that end he fends Sathyn into Trepizjnd, but at Azotus Heraolim fought with him, and gained a feafonable Vidory. At Gazacot Cofrhoe dares the Roman Emperour again with an Army of 50000 Perftam, moil of which were Horfe: never was Battle better fought, nor more doubtfully ^ hut at length the Perfians flee, and Cofrhoe himfelf upon a fwift Arabian Courier difdained flot to poll; to Theobatman, hoping there if any where to find fafety. But fuch was the general hate he had plunged himfelf into, he durft not truft that Sanduary. Heraclim therefore refolving to ferret him purfues the Tyrant^, but Cofrhoe hearing of his approach^ thinks it more fafe to flee into Media than look for help from that helplefs Deity.

Cofrhoe not yet quite out of breath,, by this had gathered a frefh Army out of Hyrcania. and gave order for Sha-Rablecca to forragc Alhama - but having intelligence that they were in a good pofture of defence, K^te«eturned, till with new for ces forc't him back again; and much hurt in all probability would they have done, had not Heraclim fpeedily interpofed and happily defeated boththofe Armies m one day, neither knowing of the others lofs.

And accordingly after a ihort,buthot,difpute the Romans had the vidory. Many loft their lives that day, neverthelefs the Verfian General with fome Horfe made a fair retreat. That Winter the Emperour marched to Sehaftia, and crofling the River Halys made PaMagonia his Rendezvous. Cofrhoe yet fwells with paflion, and by diaboli cal Witchcraft invents how he might vex the Chriftians againftwhom he raged with all forts of cruelty v and e'rehemade his laft exit once more adventures a Battel with the incenfed Romans : 150000 men he mufters, marches, and divides in three: to Sayn he diftributes one part, to Serbaras another, to himfelf the third *, imagining by fome, or all, of thefe to attain his end. Sayn with his 50000 haftens againft the Emperour. Sar- haras with his 50000 marcht to Conflantinople *, and Cofrhoe ftayes upon the Frontiers with the reft. Heraclim having intelligence of his force and drift, divides his alfo into three *. the one to haften into 'Thrace? the other to beftow a Camifado upon Sayn s Quar ter, and the laft he led himfelf into the La&amp;ic Territories to which place the Gazjtrs (a fort of Turk) came to ferve in the Army: Tfcm/wr Lieutenant General to Heraclim haftned to meet the Enemy *, and notwithftanding the Perfian bravery and cou rage of a Regiment of the Chryfoloca, whom Sayn had moft confidence in; the Perfian Army was. routed', and no wonder, feeing the Chriftians (moft of the Roman Army being then fad) had Heaven to Friend*, fo terrible a Ihower of Hail fo dreadfully thun dering againft the Terfian Horfe, that it was vifible how that God appeared in their de fence : in fine, the Perfians fled, and Sayn loft his life in the Field: the Perfians never thelefs redeemed Sayns Body with a conliderable fum, which being brought into their Quarters, inftead of a decent Burial, the Perfian Tyrant commanded his Carcafs fhould firft be arrayed in rags, perfumed him then with Dogs-turds, and iaftly ilallit his f^ e - lefs trunk into many pieces.

That year the Ga^ars {to&amp;ztife Heraclim) under the condud of Ziebit broke through the Cajpian ftraits and did the Terfiansvmtix mifchieff, but to the Roman Army expreft no fmall fervice by that adion: This was the firft appearance, or time the Turks were taken notice of, who from fo obfcure a beginning, in few years after made a conqUeft of moft of Afia, with a great part of Europe and Afrique. Anno Vom. 626. Sarbaras with a ve- ry great force entred Thrace, pillaged Cdlcedon a Town built by fafon and Arvidi) much traded to, being in view of Byaanth and the Bofphorm. After that they laid liege to Conflan- tinopky and for ten days, more or lefs,ftormed it: but fuch was the noble refolution of the Chriitians,andfuch her natural defence, that the Terfians could not enter, fo as upon no tice that Heracltus^ was approaching they raifed their fiege and made a fafe, though diflio- nourable, retreat into their own Quarters. Anno 628. the Emperour having refolved to retaliate the Per/tans for their former violence againfl the Romans and their Friends, with a confiderable Army entred Armenia, and in along fought Battel obtained a great vidory over the Per fan. After which he pur filed Cofrhoe and made a forcible entry into Ctefiphon, which after he had foundly plundered, he totally demolilht and fired: Ctefiphon was a Ci ty in Snfiana, not far from Apamia and Babylon, but upon Tygris ' 7 not a little famoufed in Writers-, built it was hyBelochus, who by the death of Sardanapalm began the Ajfyrian Empire, albeit Amianus lib. 2 3. writes Vwdanes inftimt Ctefiphon &amp; rex Tacorns amplifica- vit: the P erf an Kings ufed to keep their Court, during the Winter feafon, there: Bafl % Cyril, NazSanaen, and other grave Authors are of opinion that at this City the To wet of Babel wasereded. Hovvbeit moft are of another opinion, for other Writers place it in the Vale of Shynaar, where Babylon upon Euphrates was built, being about two days journey from Ctefiphon: nor are there any remains of Nimrods Tower at Ctefiphon. To return, Cofrhoe when he heard that Sarbaras had fped but ill in Thrace, and had : e-delivered Calcedon to the Chriftians, inflamed with paffion fends an alTafTinate to murther him: by ftrange hap the Emperour's Son having notice thereof, in honour acquaints the Geneial therewith •, who, by this ingratitude of Cofrhoe, raifed a very dangerous Rebellion. Cof rhoe when he faw things fucceed thus infortunately, fell into aFeavef firft, and then a Flux infeebledhim.fo, that upon his death-bed he nominated for his Succeflbr his Son Mardefes begot of Syr a his beloved Wife: but e're he could fet the Crown upon his head, Mar die- fa was flain by Syroes his Brother, before his Father's face: an ad lb horrid that Cofrhoe bitterly curfes the fratricide •, but Syroes (as bloody a Viper as ever lived) heaps greater fins upon his Head&gt; by commanding fome Villains to fhoot Cofrhoe : at that inftant, his loathed Soul calling to mind his like cruelty to Hormifda his Father, could not but acknowledge that God was juft in that retaliation, infomuch that in anguilh of Soul, he breathed out his wretched Spirit, having reigned, or rather troubled the World, full fifty years. Sofoonas Heraclim heard of Cofrhoes death he hoped the old quarrel was at an end ; that year therefore he travelled to the Holy City and prefented Zachariat then Patriarch with the Crofs of Chrift found by Helena (a Britiih Lady) Anno Dom. 326. May 3. raviflit thence by Cofrhoe, and refcued by Heraclm, as I lately remembred. His trium phant entring there was the i^th. of September 628 : the fame year that Boniface publiihed to the World his Catholick Supremacy ^ and in or near which time Mahomet divulged his Alcoran. Syroes (by Teixera called Chobad-Xirvihe, in the Tarich or Annal of time' Scyrviah) in the fixth year of his reign had the reward of a parricide, for he was cruelly murdered by Barbaras. Sarbaras by the Perfians called Shawryr by Shicard Sharibar, the third month of his reign alfo flew Ardchyrben Xirviah right Heir to the Crown : but eight months after that, himfelfwas flain by Joon-flja or Shyn-fiaw, Lord of that part of Taurm now called Larry-foon. The SuCcerfbrs to this Prince are incertainly delivered. The Roman Authors from him to the Conqueft of Mahomet, reckon three Kings of Perfia, the Arabs fix, the Perfians five, the Tarich four, Teijhera feven, the Armenians eleven, which will be difficult to reconcile *, Joon-ftia at the end of three months was baniiht by Tman or Tnran DoB natural Daughter to Cofrhoe, She had as bad a fate,' for at the end of fixteeii months fhe was made away by poyfon, but died much lamented: to her followed Zeddahs, by the Tarich cdWedfan-ku-kar-connah y by Elmacyn, Gafcan-Zedda who ruled nine months and then dyed: to him fucceeded Auvrmy DoB {Cofrhoes young , ft Daughter) who after fixteen months Government dyed i and left ShezJr (or Kenir) to fucceed her: He alio at the end of fix weeks was flain by Phorog~Zeddah (Shyrtar fbme call him) who af ter a like way died of poyfon Tefdgyrd followed,who was forthwith made away by Borna- rym\ hzhy Hormifdas, Captivated, and the Kingdom conquered by Mahomet and his Arabians, being the laft of thofe twelve vanilhing Turrets which Cofrhoe in a perplexed Vifionfaw one night after he had been reading and admiring -Ariftotle, as he himielf re Mm latedez66 Antiquities in Damafcus lated. Now as in all mafly Bodies there appear certain trepidations and waverings be fore they are able to fix or fettle, fo by thefe various revolutions of State in this perplex ed the Almighty feemed to decree the period ofthofe that claimed a right by fucceffion, and to bring it under the ftroke of a forraign Authority. Such time as Hormijda after five years rule (tenfomefay, others fix) was flain by Omar the fecond s ' Caliph after Mahomet: this great change happened in the year of our Lord 640. of the world 4610. and from the year of the20. by whofefall, Perfia after long glory •_ fets in an Eclipitick Cloud, and becomes fettered and forced for a time under the Iron Ybak of Saracenick bondage. For after an uninterrupted fucceffion of 28 Kings from Artaxerxes who ruled Perjia, Anno Dom. 232. Anno Mun. 4184. after Alexander the great 540. years and after 400. years obedience to thofe Perfian Kings, Mahomet then under the Roman Army,firfi; putting his Arabian Brigade into a mutiny for want of pay, revolted and being made their General quickly reduced Arabia-^ cx£^f,and Syria i of which Pro phet Mahomet I have formerly Ipokenfo much as was pertinent. To Mahomet fucceeded Ehubochar, Ahdalla Eubochar fomename him. By Elmacin in his Saracenic Hiftory called Ababecr-jiifttis, and faid to have warred againll the Abajfmes Dybanes and Bernagajfoes. In the great Climaderick year he dyed •, having fat as Caliph and King ofPerfia two years. Omar fucceeded him. He is called Hojhmarand Homer Son to Kattah-Farnqnesi a wealthy Merchant. Ally Son-in-law to Mahomet for pre tending to the Caliphfhip was by this reftlefs Caliph ever y where purfiied. And havin? advanced a great Army, he fackt Baflira an Arabian City, walled by Mnjlyn ; yea as an over-flowing torrent, rufhed as far as Gabata, tyrannizing over Syria and tAZgypt , after that he forrages Pakftine and Iberia, and as an unlucky comet blazes with fire and Sword into Ajjyria. At Bajrdat (which he made his Head-quarter) herefolves torepofe, and dedicates the fmall remainder of his time to exercifes of devotion: neverthelefs, ftudying how to difturb the World, and to enlarge his Empire by an irrefragable vow obliged himfelf per fas per nefas to endeavour to the utmoft the extirpation of Chriftianity, which he judged the fureft way to propagate the So as giving a Commiflion to he fends him with a numerous Army of Arabs firft againft the Syrians \ and with finall oppofition took Damafcw, a City at that time wealthy, andfo full of delights as Mahomet acknow ledges he durll not trutt: himfelf there for fear of temptation. For of all the Cities in the World Damafcus may worthily be placed in the firft rank both for antiquity, com merce, and beauty. The Hebrews call it Damafec \ Julian inhisEpiftles, Veram Jovis Vr- bem •, all agree that it is totius Orient is Oculum •, the Turks Shani: and not a little famous from what Tradition commonly reports. That Adam and Eve are buried there i there Cain flew Abel \ the Tomb of Zachary, Father of John Baptifl, is there fhewed, with other antique rarities of that kind; but that Adam and Eve were rather buried at Hebron is agreed by moft. In Hebron (Olim Kiriath Arba) David regnavit Annos 7.

In like fort he fends fundry other Officers with confiderable Forces to reduce other Countrys with the Sword, the beft way he could devife for fpreading the Alcoran. Ruftan-heg accordingly, with fifteen thoufand none, enters Chufifian, but at the fiege of Efcair-Mecron was (lainand in the Army Mo- M hrnamed A^ar. t commanded after him. This Arab forcibly entred the City, and made AhawoL, Sabar, Arckan, Com eft an, Jaarownand Larr acknowledge Mahomet, and enrol themfelves Omars Tributaries.

They dare not difobey their Prophet but return again to Eljheyr, where that fiege was renew'd under the con- duft of Siet hen-Abi-Fake^ who had fuch lack through OWs skill that was taken and forced to feel his tortures. At JLlcadifia ( a frontier Town ) in that angry mood he flew five and twenty thoufand Perfians', and at Galda, Spa-ham and TVz^at feveral times made Tez^dgird the Perfian General fly who had no heat left him when he beheld how fortunately Omar fubjeded Cufifian-, Pare-, Carman, and Iraachj, and In Maqmroon, Ja~ roon, &lt;jS£dgany Deacow-, Larr, Shyraz., and Moyoon-y had made all Men there fubmit and fwear themfelves Muffulmen. I ez.dgird dies, Hormifda heads his party and labours to repel the Saracens^ but in vain-, an uncontrolable decree haftening Perfia's bondage: For fifteen thoufand Men with himfelf he lacrificed as a farewel to the Liberty of his Countrey. Omar fix months after this Battel was flain treacheroufly by a Varlet, and in the Jlcaha in Mecca near to Ehn~ hocar his predecefTor, buried. Ozjnan ( in defpight of Ally) fucceeded him. Omar fat twelve years*, this Man ten, and four months in the Poiitificacy. By his Field- Marflial, to whofe condud he committed a great body of Horfe, he fubjeded divers parts of North Africkj viz..

Ofman having by this time finifhed his Paraphrale upon the Alcoran, digefled it into feven fmall Trads, which he fubdivided into an hundred and fourteen Chapters. It lb happened that by accident he loft a Ring of gold which Mahomet as a Legacy bequeathed him, but was to defcend unto the fucceeding Chaliphs: The vertue of it was fuppofed great, and probably not unlike that magick Ring mentioned by Philoflram Vita Apollmii, faid to be effeded by a conftellation of Planets: fo as no means was unattempted to reco ver it.

About this time there were terrible Earth-quakes in AJiay which in one night overturn'd fix hundred Ci ties and Villages.

His riot and venery lb exafperated Mutar-Mavia- ben-Abdella as at the-age of forty he made him away, having ruled but three years. Mh - tar was as quickly dethroned by Abdal-ben-Jezad a Ben-Humian : Some are of opinion that Ocen and his eleven Sons were flain by this Caliph,md not by Mavi. Marvan (after he had fat nine months) difpoifelfes him, as he was by Abdalla again ^ but both by Ah en or Abdal- melee were both of Life and Kingdom bereaved.

The two Caliphs died mad when they heard of thefe mif-fortunes.

Marvan in revenge, with three hundred thoufand Saracens enters Ferfia, where Salyn encounters him, and near to Spaham vanquifhed the Arabian, an hundred thoufand of his Men being flain and fcattered, Marvan affrighted at this lofs flies from Babylon to Mecca, and tnence into &lt;^£gypt ^ -bat thither alfo Salyn purfues him j and by his Ba- nifliment or death put an end to the Race of his inveterate Enemies the Ben-Humians, begun by Mavi, by Mar van ended.

For albeit Abuballa a while oppofed Saint Azjmulli, Afmulli at Cufe was crown'd King and fat as Caliph alfo. Authors here a little vary •, for fome fay it was Aunulli who brought fo great a force out of Chorafan that made Marvan fly from Ferfia to ^£gypt, and thence into Barbary, where he feated in Fe&amp;z. and Morocco, and peopled divers parts of North Africk, the being from them defcended, diftinguifhed from the Brebers or Mountaineers the old Inhabitants of thofe Countreys. And about this time it was that the Turks living then in the moil Nor therly parts of Zagathai made an irruption through the Cajpian Straits, and for fome time feated^hemfelves .in Turcomania a Province in Armenia the greater. This Azmulli is he that revived Mutar\ Tenents to the honour of Ally and difgrace of the three Suc- ceffors of Mahomet, publifhed afterwards by Siet Gunet of Ardaveil. Saint Azjmulli being dead, his Son Sdyn was faluted King who after three years dy ing, Abu-becr, called Bugiafer and Almanjor, fucceeded him An. Dom. 758. of the Heg. 138.

In Perfia I endeavoured to inform my lelf concerning the genuine fignification of the word Sophy, a Name ufuaiiy attributed to the Kings of Perfia •, but the Natives could give me little fatisfadion: Some fay it fignifies eled. Mnadoi derives it from SophitL i. a conquered People. Scaliger fromTl^/i, an Arab' word, fignif/ing Orthodox. Others make it a Mendicant, or Beggar *, butl imagine it a derivative from Sha, i. Kins;, or Sho • and thence Shoff, or Soph,as now pronounced ^ albeit 1 find it not more ancient than J[- mael at his Coronation either as a iiippof) in memory of his Anceftor who bore that name, and indeed laid the firlt foundation of 7/J»^/'sgreatnefs, and whence honoris or a Ha it might be attributed according to that ancient cuftome of the Oriental, and other Nations *, for, in iy £ffypt the Pharaoh and Ptolomy^s ^ in Syria-, the Antlochi •, in Perfia, the Jchemenesy and Arfacida •, and the Crfars amongit the Romans were in ufe, as now the Sophy with the Per fans. Neverthelefs,it feems to me, that,either the Agnomen might be given by the Greeks upon Jydar his Fathers Marriage with Martha the Daughter of Defbina, Daugh ter to Calo Johannes Emperour of Trep^ond as lately mentioned, and by reafon of his prudence probably might merit that name, as did Mw, i.e. good, and according to the ancient ufual cuftome of the Kings of England, France and other places- but if the Greek, derivation will not ferve, if I may criticize without offence, I do obferve' that in the Armenian idiom Sophy lignifies Woo . , of which the Salhes were made the Perfian Kings ufed to wear, in elteem with them^ as may be obferved by their diftinguifhing their race by the black and white Sheep •, or othcrwiie may relate to the word ShofF ; as 1 find the Shafh in ancient times was termed, which differed from the Turbant now worn • for it was a high narrow peakt Cap lined with the rich Wool of Chorazan refembling the Cyda- risj which fome iay Gyrw firlt invented: but in the Sclavonian it fignifieth ftudious, and by reafon hereof Bajazet was firnamed Sophy, he that was Son toSolyman by Roxellana , as ap pears in the Turkiih Hiftory F'Ita Solymanni: but though to me the word Shoff feems derived from Shaugh, I e. King, yet feeing that in the Scythic tongue Sofey is famous, and that much of the Per pan language,as well as their extrad, flows thence, the greater is the pro bability that thence the name may be deduced ^ and the rather for that the word Mo vol is impofed by the Tartars upon the race of Tamherlane ruling Induflan, which word in their fpeech imports great or illuftrious, though in the firft Original, laborious •, but a^ain, when I confider that feveral of the intervening Kings fince Jfmael have intermittedthat word, namely Mahomet firnamed Codohanda, Tahamas, and Abbas, it may be granted that the word Sophy h a proper Name, and that the former is datum &amp; non acceptum, gi ven by the Europeans, but not taken by the Per/tans: for the Prince that fucceeded Ab~ has having his name Sophy or Sofee as they pronounce, the prefent King fucceeding him is called Abbas', Co as it appears to be a proper and alternate Name without any further relation.

This glorious rife continued fo to the Meridian : for to give the T/^fome better aiTurance of his fitnefs to mhthe Perfians, and animofity to the Ottomans race, he forth with entred Diarhec with a confiderable Army, moft Horfe, with which he reduced that, as foon after Armenia, Albania, Iberia, and Sarcajhta, which he challenged as his right by defcending from Vfan-Cajfan, and quieted the poUeffion with his Sword, to the unex- preffible joy of the Perfians, but amazement of the Turks, and dread too, perceiving they fhould now have work enough with the Perfians, About this time, 'viz.. 1506. it was that Techellis Aydars Difcipleout of zeal to propagate thefe new broacht opinions, and to force the erroneous Turk to a conformity, with a confiderable party of Horfe which Ifmael gave liberty to raife and to be equally divided betwixt him and Cajfan his con-difciple by fome ironically called Kaliph, for fomatime gave a notable difturfomce to the Turl^ and not a little advantage to the European Chriftians, had they made right ufe of it. Strange it is to confider with what confidence thefe reputed Saints, with a fmall party, advanced againft a numerous, and the moft formidable Enemy at that time in the Univerfe *, which neverthelefs zeal, in their apprehenfions, rendred eafie to be ef- feded: having therefore in the firft place adjudged the Turks Hereticks, and proclaim ed them Enemies to the Muffelmanifli faith, worthy to be profecuted with Fire and Sword, in hbftile manner they entred Natolia with 20000 Horfe and Foot, at Iconium near Lyca- N n onia^onia in a pitchtBattel gave Ore an who commanded thofe parts in chief under his Unckle a notable defeat, and foon after the like to Caragoz.cs the Balhaof Natoha, fo as without lett they entred and fackt the rich City of Cuthes, after which,hearing that Ally Baffa was advanced againft them with a great body of Horfe and Foot, Souldier-like they drew out and met the T urk* in the Plains of Ancyra and worfted them by pure force, the General Ally Baffa in that conflid being found dead in the Field *, a fuccefs that got Tekelles fo higha reputation that even Bajazet himfelf was ftartled as if Tamberlains Ghoft were revived, infomuch as if Jfmael had but furnifht his Captain with recruits, and given him that due countenance he deferved, 'tis thought he would have fucceeded better in that military progrefs*, which failing, he was forced to maintain his Men upon free quarter ; foas the pillage the Souldiers got made many ileal away to fecUre their booty, which alfo alienated the affedions of the Provinces where ever he came, who for merly gave him arfuninterrupted entrance amongft them, and good quarter, as the Perfi- ans well perceived when they drove away their Cattel and withdrew themfelves into the Mountains without giving him either help by Men, Vidual, or intelligence: an advantage the crafty T^quickly efpyed; fothathemarcht towards him with a great Army which the Verfians by reafon of their unequal numbers feared^ fo as they made what hafte they could to fecure themfelves in the high Mountains of Anti-Taurus i whither the Turks pur- filing the Per fans made a hafty retreat into Media, and by the way fome of them unadvi- fedly plundring a Carravan of raw Silk belonging to the Merchants of Tabris and configned for T repzond, Teke lies as foon as he came into Tanris was fecured and by Jfmael's appoint ment feemingly to gratifie theTwfcburnt or otherwife miferably put to death,with feveral of his Officers. This ftorm over-blown,2?^^ obferving neverthelefs Jfmaefs prudence and good condud apprehended that he would not only difappoint his aims of extending his Empire Eaft as far as Indus, but by his courage and reftlefs motion prevent his Weftern Progrefs againft the Chriftians •, fo that he thought it wifdom to firm a truce for fome time with the Perfian, that he might with more liberty profecute his other defign*, for to under take both at once would be too great an enterprize, and it was not without caufe he dread ed Ifmael, whofe vertue and martial fuccefs was fuch as he not only ftood his ground againit the Twk^ but made the Tartar andMogol fenlible of his difcipline, which fo elevated his fame that Ambafladours from fundry Kings and Princes had been with him to congratu late j and amongfl other admirers the Jw were fo taken with him that they miftook him for their Meifias, but (by the juft hand of God) had fo unexpeded a return as quickly made them feel their errour, finding him rather a fecond Fefrafian : during this fliort peace, as Bajazet was one way adive, fo was Ifmael another; for well knowing the ancient boun-^ dure of his territories he forthwith reduced all Shefrvan, and after that Ghylan towards the North, as alfo what other Princes were not feudatory in Hyerac, Chuff an, Kermoan-, and Macron but made Coom his ufual head quarter: and by Elias-beg he infefted the 0/^- heg-Tartar, having by the way forced part of Monendram to fubmit: howbeit near Boghar his fuccefs was otherwife by an ambufcade laid by Ocen-heg-Gheloley Lord of Chalat-Phe- ruzXy -^ who albeit he had news that Ifmael was perfonally advancing thitherward and found himfeif unable to keep the Field, neverthelefs fortified fome places of defence, in one of which he immured himfelf, having a great opinion of his Men and that the Ca- ftle was tenable •, fo that at fome diftance being fummoned he refufed to yield: but a Roy al Army drawing before it, 'twas expeded he would then refign ^ yet fuch was his great heart that he kept the place until Flux and Famine conftrained him, whereupon fubmit- ting, his former confidence in defying his Army fo inflamed Ifmaely that Ocen and fifty others fufFered under his difpleafure, but the reft were pardoned. During this, hearing of fome refolution the Prince of Mozendram had to prevent his recruits, he fell fpeedily into their Country and did them no fmall mifchiefj and having taken Hoftages for their future good behaviour returned to profecute his intended war againft the Zagathay. With twenty thoufand Horfe he entred that Country in hoftile manner •, and albeit he under- ftood. by good intelligence that the Tartars had got together near three hundred thoufand Horfe and Foot led by Viae hc-c awn, he declined not the fight, which the Tw- tar notwithftanding their odds did for fome time, fo that Ifmael took up his Winter er Quarters in and about Tar on, but with the firft opportunity of weather eritred Tuzz and enlarged his Quarters as far as Samarchand, which was formerly fpoiled. That Summer he engaged Sha-beg~chan who commanded thirty thoufand Horfe and root feleded from thofe under Viae hc-c awn: For Sha-beg-cawn upon the death ofOcen- beg had it feems ufurped the Crown of Corazan •, and Ocerfs Sons not being in a condition to defend their right took the advantage of Ifmaefs prefence*, fo as aaving declared the W rong they luffered and voluntarily proffered lubjedionto his Im perialiiHli'li.Min iff ii IfmacI invades Tartary. 175 perial Crown he undertook their defence : and accordingly entred Rhumefian, where af ter a fharp but fhort difpute at Mar an Sha-heg~cawn was flain, and Ac en-Ally Son to Ocen- Cheholy upon doing homage was placed in his Fathers ftead. Jfmael having thus enlarged his Dominion, with all the force he could make direds his march towards Oxia •, and having palled the River, in a pitcht field flew Cham- SUba the Mmremhar King *, yea without much oppofition, harrafed far and wide thofe Scythic Provinces: By ftorm he alfo took the Itrong Caftle ^£lcam ; and after that Dargan-, FargJwan, Azfaker with feveral other confiderable Forts in Tfogd, Ken- mughj Gawehen, Afaurenahary Rhumeftm and Turqueftan, and far beyond Bal^ the O hzl - heg Metro-polis moft of which Garrifons he fleighted. So that Ifmael crowned with Victory, and his Army loaden with fpoils of war, upon notice fent him that Ba- jaziet at the importunity of the Tartars was drawing towards the confines of Per- fia with a great body of Horfe and Foot, retreated, but by the way fackt revolting T 'am, Sakalcand, Sykgmefl and fome other offenfive Towns that interpofecL Thus ha ving fufficiently retaliated the Tartar for the in-roads and difturbances they had feveral times given the 'Perpan to oblige the Turl^ and for the depredations he had fuffered from thofe vagrant Tribes which take their name from the Caracdu or black-iheep, he marched through Moz^endram to Verfia in triumph, the Countrey all the way he paft fending in provifion and expreffing their rejoycings by all the merriments and modes they could, very much to Jfmaels fatisfadio'n : and in magnificent manner ma king his intrada into Coom, his reception was with all poflible demonftrations of love and joyful acclamations* In few dayes, intelligence was brought him how the Turks were drawing towards Ry- van : fo that by way of diverfion, Ifmael with fifty thoufand Horfe fell into Dyarhecy which he harrafled to purpofe upon this occafion. The Mefopotamians under the Tnrkj fo foon as they had certain notice that the Perfiam were invading Tartary, through trea chery got into Bagdat which they plundered, and ufed the Per ft am who were fouldiers of that Garrifon, very barbaroufly : for not content to call them Raffadins which figni- fies Hereticks, they cut off the nofes and thumbs of feveral of them^ and in that favage manner expulfed them the Town; to revenge-which^ Ifmael made that fpoil in the Turks quarters; and engaging the Enemy near Car amity had the better of them, inafmuch as he had the chafe to the very banks of Tigris, Which efFeded he returned to Coom \ where for the greater provocation of the Turk, he caufed a fwine to be nourilhed in the Court, and named it Bajazet. But what immediately followed more perplexed the Turk: for Anno Dom. 1511. Heg, 891. Ifmael recovered Bagdaty into which, he was permitted to enter at a poftern, which Barriec-heg for a fum of money opened, fo unexpededly to Mahomet-Baffa the Governour thereof, that without the leaft refiftance, he made what halt he could to leave the Fort and fave himfelf, believing that the fouldiers were all likwife corrupted. This year Lemim a Portugal Agent was civilly treated by Ifmael at Cajhan, and by Mir^a-Abucaca the Field-Marfhal ihewed the Army, as encamped j who at his return to Goa, told Albuquerq ( at that time Vice-roy ) that he verily thought Ifmael had not fewer than fifty thoufand Tents, in Which were lodged a hundred and thirty thoufand men. Bajaz^et was that year (as 'tis reported ) poyfoned by a Jew, and his Son Selym fuccee- ded. About which time it was that Morad or Amurath Son to Sultan Achmat, Bajazets eldeft Son whom Selym had put to death for felf-prefervation, fled to Ifmael f his Brother Akdin doing the like to Camp fan Ganrns the ^Egyptian Sultan, where both were welcom ed, though foon after it coft them dear ; for it was the occafion of the utter ruine of the one, and of a quick and fharp war with the other. Ifmael neverthelefs feemed glad of any good occafion to engage his adverfary ; and to obviate the invafion threatned by Se/yw#..hearing that Ebrahim-Bajfa was halting towards Armenia^ he put Morad in the head of ten thoufand Horfe, promifing that Vfireff-Oglan with twenty thoufand more ftiould fecond him. In confidence whereof Morad advanced as far as Emirum : but there having intelligence that Selym was halting that way, bethought it moit advifeable (with leave of Aladules the Prince of Anti-Taurus} to retreat, well knowing that his Uncle would hunt sfter him- Ifmael upon the firft intelligence of Setyms approach in good order marched againfl him with thirty thoufand Horfe and threefcore thoufand Foot fay the Turk,'albeit the Perftans allow not above half that number. The Turkifh Army upwards of three hundred thou fand Horfe and Foot without oppofition palt as fair as the River Araxis, and with help of their great guns, being over, both Armies refolved to engage. The Emperours were both there in |)erfon and drew up in a large even place called the Galderan plain not far from , Coy i J n 1 (J is't; Memorable Fight in the Calderan Tlains. Coy and nearer unto Naffivan, where for full fixteen hours a moft memorable field was fought with fuch fiercenefs and equal refolution that the Turkifh Annals call that battel the day of Doom : in which fight fuch was the fingular perfonal valour Jfmael exprelfed, as the Turks themfelves fpare not to give their Enemy high commendations: alfo fo gal lantly and in fo good order' his Cavalry appeared, that had not the noife of the Turks Artillery affrighted their Horfe more than their numbers did their Riders 'tis thought the Terpans had obtained a clearer Vidory,for every fingle Verfian ten Turks being found dead in the place. Now inafmuch as there was no chafe, hut rather that part of either Army kept in a body all night until next day they drew off on either fide leaving the Countrey people to bury the dead, the mattery of the field is not decided by indifferent Writers; who yet agree in this, That fifteen thoufand men lay dead upon the ground. The Turkiih Hiftory neverthelefs fpeaks partially in their own behalf ^ but this is equally acknowled ged, That Selym immediately after the fight ( probably diOiking his churiifla entertainment and fatisfied with the fight of Ferfm ) retreated with his whole body by the skirts of Arme nia into Caramania-i by the way caufing Aladedes the Anti-Tauran King to be ftrangled for his correfpondency with Ifmael and his Nephew Morad. Soon after, with all the force he could make invading by the treachery of Caer-beg the Sultan of Aleppo he van- quifhed Campfon Gam and reduced that Kmgdome into a Province, which from Sultan Saladin Anno Heg. 680. had continued in that race to the year Heg. 896. and albeit the recovery was in vain endeavoured by Toman-beg, the Turk holds the polfellion unto this day. While Jfmael retiring to Caahyn took care of his wounded fouldiers, and having- recruited his Army profecuted the fubjedion of Moz^endram : and that he wight extend his Empire North and South unto both Seas and withal, for the better prefervation of his Perfon and Honour 3 and in imitation of the Mamalukes who then guarded the perfon of the Egyptian King, inftituted a Life-guard called Couzel-bafha's, which at firit con- fifted of an hundred Horfe, moft of them Georgians ; but fince, the number is increafed to a thoufand: into which order none are admitted until they are experienced in Arms and are of more than ordinary repute ; in the execution of which trull they according ly have extraordinary pay, which they well deferve ; for I have been in the company of many of them, and at all times found them exceeding civil as well as fociable, and efpe- cially to ftrangers. P- Jovim and fome others report That in memory of the twelve Sons of Hoc en Son of Mortis-Ally ( from whofe youngeft Son Mir^a-Mahadin Jfmael drew his defcent) this order had its beginning, and that their Mandilsor Turbants were folded in twelve plaits and the tag or point like the end of a Sugar-loaf piercing the Turbantwas red, and from that colour takes the name of Coozel-bafhes, i. e. Red-heads. Howbeit, for feveral moneths I was converfant with thefe Coozel-bafhaws inPerfia, and to the heft of my remembrance never obferved that the fafhionof their Mandil or Turbant was fuch, or to differ from that form you fee reprefented in this Narrative/^Z. 157. and 216. and if any difference be it is in the elevation ; but for the tag or point I am fure 1 never: faw any ^ nor any of that fhape worn, unlefs it be in the Coola or cap that is ufually by the more inferiour fort worn in Moz,endram and other parts of Perfia, being cloth on the out-fide and fhag or fine and fhort curling iheeps-fleece on the in-fide, large towards the Head, fharp like the top of a fugar-loaf at the point, and riling a fpan from the head, as you may fee refembled/o/. 183. But concerning the name I have the lefs fcruple,feeing that in Turkiih the word fignifies Red-head: albeit the truth is, when I demanded the fig- nification of the name from fome of them they pleaded ignorance as we underftand it, as alfo the ground .of their inftitution. In that interval, Tabriz, by a party from Dyarbec fuffered by Ebrahim chawn (after wards a Favourite to Solyman the magnificent) upon the invitation of Vlem-beg a difcon- tended Perfian , who notwithftanding he had the honour to marry Jfmaels Sifter, yet upon fome fpecial favour expreffed to Zinal-cham held a treafbnable correfpondence with the Turk i and not content therewith, fo corrupted Mahomet-Ally-beg then Governour of Bagdat that the place was treafonably delivered up to Solyman, to the extreme vexation of the Perfian King and little comfort of Ally-beg-, who fooh after received the reward due unto fuch treachery. This year Sha-Tamas was born at Ardaveil *, and in the five fuc- ceeding years after (but by feveral Wives ) Jfmael had JJelcawn, Sormiz^a, and Bacram- cawn otherwife named Elias-beg, Som-mirz.a^ and Barhon-cawn. Anno Dom. 1520. Selym the great Turk died, fucceeded by Solyman : Five years after which Shaw-Jfmael died in the twentieth year of his Reign and fortieth of his age, and was buried near unto his Ance- ftors at Ardaveil in his place, Tgmas (or Tahamat-Shaw as fome call him) being crow ned King. ^ Babylon thus taken, it gave the Turk the eafier redudion of Diarbec and part of Chufi- fian.The T urk beaten by the Portugal, W Delementlies. jhn, with all thofe adjacent Countreys that confine the North of Arabia: inafmuch as with very little refiftance they became Matters alfo of the Ifle and Town of Balfora, and con fequently of the Rivers and Euphrates, which gave them a defirable pi ofped into' the gulph of Perfia, with fome further hopes of all thofe Regions that extend as far as Mm , and that they might have tke opportunity of requiting Tamerlanes Ifliie for that memorable lois they luitered at Mount Stella under Bajaz,et. In order thereunto the Grand Signior forthwith appointed a great quantity of timber to be cut in Cilkia now called Caraman, and {hipped it thence for Pekfam and Cairo, whence by Camels it was drawn to Suez., where a Navy confining of an hundred Veffels great and linall was mlhort fpace built and fitted for Sea. Which was no fooner made ready, but he appoints Solv- mm BaiFa to put ten thoufand fouldiers aboard at the Port of Mocha, and coafting the South of Arabia to endeavour the furprize of Bin : thofe were his Inftruaiions. Which great deiign how fecretly foever it was managed was feafonably communicated to the Portugal in whofe hands the Caftle was, albeit they pretend they had no notice until the Fleet was difcovered near the place: fo that albeit they could not fo well provide againit their landing as they would, yet the Turks being alhore and marching immediately towards the Fort which without a fummons they rudely ftormed, were fo gallantly repulfed bv the Portugal that many Turks there breathed their laft: and finding that the Gallle was neither fo weakly mann'd nor flanker^ as they were made believe, and that l^Ponmah were in a gallant pofture of defence but which moft amated them the Mahometans there abouts gave them little encouragement to ftay, the Frigats from feveral parts alfo im bodying threatned to intercept them in their return, thofe and other confiderations not onely haftened them aboard out made them hoife fail: for all which they were fo well bea ten by tl^e Portugal, that a great part of the Fleet was funk and difperfed, fo as few of them came fafe back to Aden ; thofe that got afliore near Muscat and other parts of Ara~ hia being alfo ( according to the uiual cuftom of War after ill fuccefs,) fo courfelv enter tainedby the Natives, that not above one third of the number got back to Aden. A fuc' cefs fo grateful to the Per fan that he congratulated the Chriftians •, and the Mo^ul expref- fed the like fence, altogether difliking fuch a neighbourhood as the Turks Solyman heartily vext, neverthelefs thought fit to dilfemble this lofs thebeft he could and therefore draws all the Horfe he had out of Dyarhec and Car mania, with which he fell fo unexpededly into Media that he entred Tabriz before Tamas-fiaw could be in a poiture to refift. Molt miferably was that poor City ufed by the enraged Turk, albeit no oppofition was made ^ for not content with plunder, they cut down their fruit-trees and trees for fhade, fpoil'd all their delightful Gardens, yea levelled with the ground* the Kings Palace and fuch other Houfes of the Nobility as might beft exprefs their malice * and then laden with fpoil marched back to Caramit in Dyarhec, where for Ibme time thev relied, and ruminating further mifchiefs, the Turkilh trade. Tamas and the Perfian Nobility Miciently incenfed, were not idle in the mean time to find means to retaliate; For having ordered Delementhes ( one that had many times enga- • ged the Turks) with fix thoufand Horfe to follow clofe in the rear, he fo galled them with continual alarms that Ebrahim-Bajfa not well enduring becaufe not formerly ac quainted with fuch a bravado made a ftand, and near to Bethlis (then a Perfian Garrifon) drew up with a refolution to fights and well might, being upwards of two hundred thoufand Horfe and Foot; notwithftanding which inequality the Perfian Horfe taking the opportunity of the darknefs of night fell into their Enemies quarters with a mighty noife as if they had been treble the number, feconding that with fuch courage and good or der as the Turks by this unexpeded alarm after a little refiftance fell into great confu- fion, inafmuch as at length they fled whither they apprehended they could bell fecurc themfelves: In the purfuit five Sanziacks, eight hundred Janizaries, and twenty thou fand private fouldiers were flain, forty pieces of Cannon taken, Vlm-heg the Perfian Re bel and the two Baffa's narrowly efcaping, but what moft madded old Solyman,t\iQy took his Seraglio which was then mounted upon Camels backs and were Beauties he not a little doated on. A Vidory not more joyous to the Perfian, ( for 'tis annually celebraced upon the third and tenth of OMun^than vexatious to the Turkj and of that influence, as Ehrahim the great Bafla from thence-forward declined iii his Mailers favour : for unwilling that the BafTa fhould in hello hisycccare he firil remanded him to Court, and then fo ordered, that without feeing his face, he was immediately ftrangled by a Mute, who furprized him deeping. By that delinquency the vaft wealth he had heaped together whiles he was a Favorite and in great command, was. then alfo feized by Solyman, who prefented a great part of it to his chief delight th^fair Roxellana, who (the truth is) for his fiding with Muflapha againft her Son, had principally contrived and after this manner efFeded this late great Baffa's - deltrudion. AboutAbout this time, Baianet (Solymans Sqii hj Koxellana) was worlled by his Brother .S^- hm fo that he fled for fafety to T amas whom he found at Caz.bin y where he was really welcomed • but Soiyman imagining he would provoke the Perfim to an unwilhed inva- fion havins then bent his whole defign againft the Chnftians, peremptorily fent to de mand his Son • which being denied, he feconds it with a commmatory Letter, yet withal alfurins Tamls that he came defignedly to aflaffinate him: fo that contrary to his Faith and Honour he unadvifedly delivered up the poor Prince to Huffan-aga the Turks Am- baflador, who thereby had the opportunity not only to murder the Prince but aifo four of his children, namely Omar, Morad, Selym, and Mahomet', to the everlalbng fhame and re proach of them that fo counfelled the King, and to the immoderate anguifh of RoxelUna\ fpirit, though to the feeming fatisfadion of an enraged Father whom Tamas thought would have been pacified with fuch a Vidim, and that by this compliance he had put a lafbing obligation upon the Turk*, which he quickly found otherwife : for Soiyman upon a pretence of righting Brcas-mirz.a one of tfmads Sons and at that time Governour of Shervan but retired to Derbent, with a confiderable party moft Horfe enters Armenia, furprized the City Fan, and perfuading the Mirza to go to Bagdat, the Turks drew back: where- ^ upon the Governour of Bagdat having received a large bribe delivered the poor Prince up to Shaw-Tarnasi who after a moneths imprifonment caufed him likewife to be ftrangled. Notwithftanding which, Soiyman next year in the head of an hundred and fifty thou- fand men re-enters Terfta. To oppofe whom Shaw-Tamos (having by fad experience found the advantage the Turks had by their great Ordnance ) prevailed with the Vice roy of to furnilh him with five thoufand Portugals good fire-men from Or mm. Bin, and other their Garrifons, who were the more willing for the late invafion the Turk made againft Dm near Indus. The For tubals were all Foot, and brought along with them a Train of twenty pieces of Cannon^ which in the fight was fo unexpeded that it both amazed and mifchieved the Turks, inafmuch as the Perfians had the better of that dayes conteft the fuccefs whereof they attributed and accordingly gave the Chriftians a due acknowledgment of their good fervice : and from that day forward the Perfians were acquainted with the ufe of Guns, and of fmall fhot they have attained the maftery. Soiyman by this mifchance was conftrained to draw back into Natolia: during which Mnflapha ( another of Roxellana's Sons ) incurred his Fathers high difpleafure ^ and for getful of his Brother's tragick end fimply commits himfelf to the favour of the Perfian King^ who having firft exclaimed upon the villanous Bajfa Huffan, then gave the Prince affurance of his Life during his abode. Notwithftanding which, Soiyman (who was prety •• well pradifed in the road-way to P^y^marches thitherward with eighty thoufand Men, doing all the mifchief he could ^ albeit to .prevent further Ipoil, advanced with all the force he had as far as where coming to an engagement^the Horfe not yet enduring the noife of Guns would not be ordered, fo that many of the Perjiansmvt kill'd by ftiot, and the reft forfook the Field, leaving poor Mufiayha to Ihift for him felf-, who by fome finifter advice, flying to his Father's Tent and proftrate at his feet in a lamentable manner humbly befeeching pardon even for his Mother Roxellana\ fake, the cruel and inexorable (unworthy the name of Father ) wanting bowels of com- palfion TWjyike forthwith commands him to be ftrangled •, albeit he was the onely Son by that venter then living. But long he lived not after this favage cruelty, for that year 1566, he fighed out his affrighted Ghoft at the Siege of Zigeth in Hungary. Am- baifadours from moft parts (according to cuftom) congratulating his Succeflbrs accefs to the Crown. Sha-Tamas alfo difpatched Shaculy-chan to Stambul : A Souldier both well known and feared amongft the Turks and Indians: and in his paflage to that Court gal lantly attended, one time he gave a vifit according to form to the Vifier Bajfa, and was (hot* at by a defperate Giomoglan, upon no other provocation than for that he was a Heretick: he narrowly efcaped ^ but the Jemoglan being apprehended, his blind zeal could not prevent his immediate and vifible torture. The Turkm. the interim took Nicojla and Cyprus from the Venetians, which occafioned a perpetual League with Spain and all the Princes of Italle ; yea, Fine. Alex and. a Secre tary to that Republique was difpatched into Perfia to awaken that King. This Gentle man had the Sclav onion Tongue infomuch as he palled through Poland down the Dam- him into the Euxin, and fo incognito and in difguife to Trepizond, whence by Erz.irum{ a Cappadocian Town upon the skirts of Armenia) hecamefafe to Cozhyn: There having produced his Credentials he was civilly entertained •, and albeit no rhetorick wanted nor arguments to enforce the Perfians to fall fpeedily into the Turkjjh quarters feeing he had drawn all his Force againft the EuroptanVrinces', yet luch was Sha-Tamas his prqpen- fity to eafe, or elfe the dread he had of the Turkijh puilfance, that no perfwafions would atThe tragic fiends of fevera Perfian Trinces. at that time ferve to-make a fatisfadory return unto the Venetians, t ill imagining that the Tnrk would gratifie. Now the thanks he gave was this. Amurath no fooner put an end to the Cyprian War (Anno 1575.) and recruited himfeif after that great and memo rable defeat given him at Lepanto, but he fell afrefli to quarrel with the Ferfian, upon no other pretence than the death of Ercat-mir^a his late friend. Accordingly he prepares to renew the War: whiles the Perfian King ignorant of thofe preparations with what Force he could invades the £W*/s Gountrey, and happily took Kabul: h\xt hearing that the TWl intended to profecute the Perfian War, he forthwith retreated to Ca^hyn ; where amidlt his Martial confultations and provifions Death gave him his fuperfedeas and fum- moned him to another World (the 1 ith. of May 1576.) after fifty years Rule and 14. dayes ficknefs, at the age of fixty eight giving up the Ghoft: A great age, the Pro verb confidered, Kara in Nob Hit ate fenetius 5 and at Ardaveil with all due Ceremony was interred amongfl: his Royal Anceftors. d Sha-Tama* left behind him twelve Sons and three Daughters: the Sons were Mahomet, Ifmael, AyJar, Sulyman, Emangoly, Morad, Mnfiapha, Ally, Harned, Ebrahim, Ham^e, and Jfma^chan.

Thefe inteftine broyles fo weakned the common intereft that the Twho wants no forefight efpying his advantage prepared with all the force he could draw out of Afia the lefs, Diarhec and parts about Bagdat to make an entire conqueft, or at leaft to over run the Perfian, which Countrey alone had fpent him more Men,Treafure and time than all Natalia and Morea had done by reafon of the inteftine divifions that happened in moft of thofe Provinces: and having the like hopes of Perfia by thefe diftradions Mufiapha the cruel and perfidious Bajfa was ordered to undertake that task: which agreeable to his na ture was readily accepted: fo that albeit the hafte the T/^made was great, yet the prepa rations being fuch alfo, Mahomet in that interval got himleif quietly poffeft of the Crown infomuch as uponfirft noife of the Turks approach, (who was at that time Governour of Keivan and famous for an expert Souldier, fo as he was both known and feared b^ the Tark^) with a very gallant Body of Horfe encountred the Enemy upon the Frontiers of Armenia, and in a quick engagement expreft fo much refolution that day as albeit Maftapha had treble his number, the Van led by Beyram-heg was routed, and pro- fecuting that charge broke through the whole party, moft of which was cut off without giving the leaft quarter: which bravery fo inraged the wrathful Baffa that immediately ordering his whole Body to advance, by their numbers they over-powered the Perfia, who albeit they fought moft defperately and in that charge flew above ten thoufand Turks were neverthelefs in fine forced to retreat and leave four thoufand of their com pany dead in the place V with whofe heads and thofe of his own whom the Perfians had flain the favage faced a great Bulkwark, inafmuch as nothing could be feen but ghaftly Faces and Heads, which made it a terrible objed ^ and this he ereded as a Trophy of his Vidory or rather barbarifm: But reprefented to his Mailer in the befb fence, as if the flaughter had been much more than really it was: for all which Mu- ftapha diiliking his late entertainment, and hearing that Salmas-mirz.a was advancing with a frelh party of Horfe, withal finding upon a Mufter he took that 40000 of his Men were loft by Fluxes^isEnemies-Sword^and the bad weather they indured palfing the Moun tains in the way to Teflis , thofe confiderations fwayed with him to retreat: but by the way being encouraged with a large recruit of Men conduded by Memchar &amp; Georgian Prince, AUx, his Brother and Son to Leventheheg taking like care for his fupply of vidual, r hef-l if; ■ 280 Emir-Hamze-M irza'x T urk. he now refolved to re-enter Shervan. For more expedition and better fafety part of his Army marched through unfrequented paths fnewed them by the Appftate Georgian, and other part through Armenia which the Ferjians had made defolate to prevent the TurJ^ of relief, and having notice that towards Derbent a great part of the Cattel of the Countrey was driven awayj in the firft place he ordered a paity of Horfe that way for forrage ^ which Tocomac the Ferfian General no fooner had notice of, but that -with the like fprightful party he beat up the Tarks quarters as they lay difperfed in a Valley which was well-nigh compafled witn the River Conac, a River that of it felf is fufficiently rapid but by fome late rains fo increaft that the Turk^ in flying from the Enemy loft by the Sword and Torrent 10000 of his Men, the Ferfian by their precipitate purfuit lofmg alfo a confiderable number in the Stream, which was fo fierce that the Turkijh General himfelf upon the alarm making all the halte he could to fuccour his Men is laid to lofe eight thoufand more in that River and in Araxis, into which Conac and Cyrw run. Notwithftanding thefe abatements,continued his march as far as the City Erez. where he expeded fome oppofition ^ but the People were all fled, and had removed much of their Goods into the mountainous parts, fo that the Town was left defolate and once ordered to be burnt, but upon fecond thoughts fpared and garifoned with 5000 Men molt of which were Georgians, forced thither by the Sons of Leventhi-beg : this done they took Sumachy without reiiftance, which they might well do the Governour being withdrawn. Mufiafha overjoy'd with this fuccefs, firft conftituted Ozman-heg Comman der in chief in thole parts, and then with the greater part of his Army fell back to^ wards.£rzyrum his uiual head-quarter, while Ozwav in the mean time was pincht in Sher- van with want and not a little dilheartned by the running away of many of his Men,whereby and by the Janizaries advice he fell back to fefflis, yet not fo fecretly but that in paifing through Georgia he was fo hotly alarm'd by the Country People who had abundantly fmarted by the infolence of the Turk, as with fufficient lofs he continued his march till he attained Erxyrnm. Th sre he took up his Winter-quarters, but difperft his Army into feveral Villages thereabouts,M*/^^ being removed : during this the Precopence, the Turks left-hand, under the command of Abdd-Chery marched through the Circajhan Ter ritories with 30000 horfe and foot, in all their palfage along the Cafpian Ihore as far as Derbent not meeting with the leaft interruption, which gave them the greater confidence to enter Shervan. At and at&amp;ut Genge were quartered all the Ferfian horfe under com mand of Emangoly-Chan. Ere^-Chari having notice drew all his horfe together, and refol ved with the firlt advantage he could Ipy to welcome the uninvited Tartar: but Abdul by the good intelligence he had, prevented that defign, and contrarily began with the Ferfian, and with that courage as moft of the Ferfian Hoick was routed, many Officers and Souldiers flain, and Erez-chan himlelf doing what he could to rally, was taken Pri- /oner and fent to Ozman, who without any confulting with a Council of War caufed him to be hanged up in that Garrifon. Such was .Em: his fad exit: but in this alarm Bmangoly cam, albeit he narrowly efcap't a furprizal, yet could not he prevent the ta king of his Haram, which extreamly troubled him, there being fome beauties which were prefented the Turkhh 'General. Mthomet firnamed Odobanda by the Turk for that he was purblind (though as I ap prehend it may be rather from Cognabanda as the place was called where he had both birth and education) by his firft wife had feveral Sons j namely Ifimael, Mufiapha, Myr- c s mn, Gmet, and Sofee-mirza. Ifmael by the malice and power of Afajfom-beg the Kings Favourite at that time, was firft confined, and at length famiiht to death in the Caftle of Caykahe near Tabriz, and the reft came to untimely ends. By Jooncanna Princefs of Heri he had likewife four Sons, viz. Emerhamzt, Aydar, Abbas ana Tahamas of which, //- mael was reputed molt valiant and popular, but Abbas moft politique and ambitious. Emyr-hamze, Mahomet-Codobandas eideft Son during thefe broiles was pradifing the rules of Mars ; and having got fome experience in the Indian War, fo ill indured thefe continual bravadoes of the Turks, that he never gave over foliciting the King until he Commilfioned him to raife what horfe he could to oppofe the Turk. In the head of twenty thoufand Horfe this valiant Prince profecuted the enemy with fuch refolution and fpeed, and attended with fo good fuccefs, that through all Afia his fame quickly fpread^ infomuch as the Turks gave out that Caflriot was ^revived: for firft with twelve thouiani Horfe this hopeful Prince (the Begum his Mother in company) fet out otCasbyn, follow ed by Mirza Salmas with eight thoufand more: In the firft place he defeated Caym Bafla and his party that were forraging thole ^arts *, he then took Erez by ftorme and caufed all the Cannon which Mnftapha had planted for defence of that Garrifon, to be dravyn out and fent to Cosbyn as a Royal prefent to the King his Father, the firft-fruits of his conteft with his inveterate adverfary the Turk. ThisTheTrince of Tartary mlferahly abufed. This dorte, without the leaft: unheceflary delay, having intelligence where and in what manner the Tartars were quartered, he gave them fuch a thundring alarm that the Preco- pence being amazed and in diiorder 3 gave the Prince the opportunity with eafe to deftrov molt of his Men, the rell flying every way they could, confounded with fhame and fear the Terftam following the purfuit as far as the Cajpian Sea,where not being able to fly further they begged quarter, which was given them; but Ahdul-Cheray the General could not efcape, the Prince taking him Prifoner and ufing him with good refped: this profperous fuccefs gave him freih courage to profecute the rurk. Accordingly approaching with his vidorious Army before Sumachy he fummoned the Garrifon to yield •, but Ozman de manding time to return an anfwer, being in the interim certainly informed of the Tartars defeat, and finding no fence againft fear, that night ftole fecretly out of the Town/pur- ring all the way till he got into Derbent. The Garrifon next morning underftanding their condition offered to yield the place upon condition of mercy, but being exafperated by their late eafie fubmiffion to the Turk^, the Prince bad them Hand to their Arms, which they refufing to do, the Army entred without oppofition; and the Prince feleded fome to make examples of his rigour, the reft he pardoned upon fine ^ but the Turks were madePrifonersofWar: thus the Turks Army of feventy thoufand Men by the valour of this gallant Prince was broken in pieces, fo as for fpme years after the Country had reft. The Turks in this fort being happily ejcpulft, £mir^hamz,e loaden with fpoils as well as vidory in triumphant manner returned into Casbyn, where he was imbraced by the King, his Mother, and the Tartarian youthful Prince in company: the Tartar giving his parol to be a true Prifoner had what liberty he pleafed, and more than did him good: for being of a comely afped and for courage of good report, his charader took lb deep impreffion in the Queen, that albeit fhe had purpofed a marriage 'twixt him and Emir-hamz.e-mirz.a's Sifter, the better to make an allyance with the Crim to whom Jhdul was Son, (he neverthelefs became amorous her felf and could not be fatisfied till fhe en joyed him. To effed it, ftie found opportunity agreeable to her wifh *, but in the dalli ance fpent fo much time and took fo little care for fecrecy, that albeit Mahomet either could or would not fee, the Sultans neverthelefs took notice, and envying the repute a ftranger had got they contrived his death. One evening obferving his palfage to the Queens ufual place of retirement in the Gardens they fo fecured their way. that before the Queen or Abdul had any warning the Sultans rufht in and finding them too familiar firft removed the Qaeen, then caftrated the Prince, and in a very barbarous manner dif- played them to the People without; who imaged therewith quickly took away his life^ which in fome relped was a mercy: howbeit that ad fo difobliged the King and Prince, that the Confpirators received other rewards than probably they expeded: for this dilho- nour, and for the murder of that Prince, the Crim alio was fo provok't that he fooir after joined with the Turk to be the more revenged. Amurath alfo upon the fad account he received from Ozman then in Derbent and how formidable the Perfian Prince was like to appear the enfuing Spring, gave Muftapha frefli orders to levy a greater Army than he had before, and to profecute the War with Fire and Sword: but the Perfians by their emmiflaries having timely intelligence of thofe preparations, accordingly provide for their defence. Emangoly-chan late Governour of Genge was conftituted General for the Perfian, whiles Mufiayha glad of the occaiion to vindicate himfelf, drew together all the Cavalry the Turh^ had cither in Syria, AJfyria, or Armenia y the great andlefsand of Foot a numerous body: and Hajfan-aga (one of the Villers Sons) in the Van marched towards TefflU, where he incampt ^ whither Ozr mn alfo repaired with all the Horfeand Foot he could make. In the Perfian Army commanded by Emangoly-chan) amongft other Noble perfonages was Synon or Zenal-chawn an exiled Prince of Georgia-, but feudatory to the Perfian: of known courage in fight he was, and of approved affedion to the Perfian and conftant to his Chriftian profeflion: but the contrary was his Brother Baut or David, who did what in him lay to oblige the Twl^and offend the Perfian. Hajfan again riling with his party with an intent to fall into Shervan the Perfian General had fo good notice of his defign that taking the advantage of a pafs he fell upon the Turkey and fo feafonably divided their party, that after a notable execution the reft fled towards the Hills, HaJJanhy thefpeed of his Horfe very narrowly efcaping. This fuccefs perfwaded them to hunt the Enemy in the Woods •, where whilft they were too careleily ranging fufpeding little danger, the fubtil Turk^ having ambuihed a thoufand Horfe in thofe uncouth paflages charged the Per- pans with fo great haft and out-cries that the unexpedednefs ftriking more terrour than needed into their Adverfaries hearts, they fled after little oppofition, but much lofs v O o albeitiSz Muftapha-Baffa albeit ^Georgian Prince with his party made a better retreat: but which was of moft import, the General himfelf was taken Prifoner and under a Guard fent. to Eru- mm, and the T^rkrefufrng both ranfome and exchange fo continued for three years, un- tiil at length he made an efcape, fuch time as Ferrat-Baffa invaded Perfia. Hajfan-aga being now Matter of the Field advanced to Tefhlis for the feafonable re lief of many half ftarved Men: whence, continuing his march towards Derhem, the Georgian Prince with a fmart party of Horfe gave the Enemy fo unexpeded a charge in their Rear and with fuch admirable courage, as the Tw^was firft difordered and then put to plain flight. Haffan and Ofman again making life of their Spurs, left their Men to the mercy of the Perftan Swords ^ but their Train and Treafureas a due unto their valour, and a teftimony of that memorable defeat. At Tefhlis old Myflapha had taken up his quarter, intending to follow Hajfan with the reft of his farce : but when Hajfan himfelf brought the Balfa the firft tidings of this lofs, fo great was the old Mans paffion that he had forthwith caufed him to be ftrangled had not his taking the Perftan General Prifoner, and no lefs, his relation to the grand Vifier, been good arguments in his behalf. This difafter, and the approaching Winter,put Mnflapha upon new refolutions: fo that inftead of profecuting his Inllrudions which were to fall upon Shervan with Fire and Sword, he difpofedhis whole Army into Winter-quarters •, fo divided that it would re quire fome time to rendezvous *, the Perfians by that gaining a breathing time and fpace to prepare againft the Spring. But Amurath the great TV^had no fooner notice of the little effectual progrefs his old Favourite had made (his Enemies at Court alfo repre- fenting every thing in the worft drefs) that albeit Hajfan-aga by his Fathers intereft had a favour exprefled from Amurath, who as an acknowledgment of the fignal fervice he had done in taking Prifoner the Perfia-a General had a Silver Battel-axe double gilded and fet with Precious Stones fent unto him, with a Shield of pure Gold embelliflied with Pearl, and a Veft of Cloath of Gold ; Mnfiapha contrarily was not only difcharged from his command, but fummoned to Stamhul to anfwer his mifcarriage : fo as notwithftanding his late fpecial favour with Amurath with whom he was educated from a Child, and the many confiderable field-fervices he had done againft the poor Chriftians, fo induftri- ous were his Enemies at Court, and fo powerful his old back-friend Sinan-Bajfay that both his Life andEftatehad gone, had not the Sultana by the mediation of fbme Ladies about her interceded in the old Mans behalf. Notwithftanding,he had a Superfedeas,and (which vexed him molt) his Antagonift Sinm-Bajfa for the profecuting the Perfian War was appointed General in Mnftapha's place. During this, jealoufies and fears fo increafed in the Perfian Court through the different Interefts of the two Brothers Emir-hamz^e and Abbasy the latter of which was then Go- vernour of Heri or Aria and intrufted with the management of the War againft the Mo gul, that the neceflary preparations to oppofe the more than threatned invafion of the Turks was wholly laid afide *, the Per fan King forgetting the late fuccefs he had, by the advice of Sdmas-mir^a (whofe Daughter Prince Emir~hamz,e had married) choofing ra ther to diipatch Maxat-chan Ambaffadour to Amurath with a rich Prefent, to ufher in his propofitions for peace. The Ambaffadour took his way through the skirts of Armenia to Trepiz.ondy where finding a fit Veffel he imbarqued, and by the benefit of a fair gale made a ihort and eafie.paffage to Stamhul \ into which Port he was with due cere mony received •, and after four days repofe had audience and acceptance of his Prefent, which indeed was fuch as well deferved the Grand Seigniors thanks. At this time Mu- ftapha-Bajfa died, of age and grief, fay fome •, but otherfome rather think he was poy- foned: and the Emperour by his death made himfelfHeir to his great perfonal Eftate. Maxut-.chan preffing the Vifier for a difpatch brought it to this iffue, That peace would be granted for what timejie would propofe, conditionally the Per fans would de liver Tabriz.-, CazJbyn-, and all S heir van unto the Turkey to be for ever enrolled in the Lift of Provinces under that Crown. But the Ambaffadour wifely defiring further Inftrudi- ons from his Mafter e're he could give anfwer, by his Courrier acquainted his Mafter with the unreafonablenefs of the demands, grounded upon the divifion of the two Per fan Princes and the expedations he had of Sinan-Bafa's fuccefs in profecuting that War. which being taken into confideration hy Shaw-Mahomet (who to that end had convened moft of the confiderable Officers he had unto Casbyn) the refult was, That not one inch of Earth fhould be given their infolent Adverfary more than he could mafter with his Sword : To prevent which a great force fhould forthwith be drawn unto the Frontiers of Armenia, which the vidorious Prince Emir~hamz.e fhould command^ and that Ahhas-mirz^a with another Army fhould profecute the War'againft the Mogul towardsEr?yrum* towards Cahul. This being agreed in Council was put in Ipeedy execution- and it being thought fit to re-call Maxm chan, he made his return through the Enemies quarters pur- pofely to difcover their order and force : and being come to CashyH fo well fatisfied the King with his difcreet carriage in that truft as induced him to make him his Treafurer 5 an Office not onely honourable but of great profit; which neverthelefs acquired him great envy at Court, and amongfl others Emir-chan ( who never loved him 0 fo as making nfe of his favour with the King, he fo infinuated and fuggefted falfe apprehenfions into his weak brain, that the Treafurer perceiving the Kings kindnefs lelfened and his coun tenance xhahged, and that the craft of his adverfary w T as likely to take place, rather than fufFer further under their power he chofeto withdraw himielf and his Family with fome portable goods into the Enemies quarters, where being friendly received by Sman-Bajfa^ he had the liberty to live peaceably at fan. Emir-Hamz-e-mir&amp;a during this drew towards the Turk; and having intrufted Swwz- chawn the Georgian and Tocomac the Perfian with fix thoufand Horfe they difpofed part of that body into an ambufcade, and with the reft fell into Sinam quarterswhence being repulfed and counterfeiting fonie fear drew the Enemy to a loofe purfuit^ till being paft the place where their men were hid, breaking out upon their rear Tocomac faced about, fo that the Enemy was charged both wayes i who finding themfelves intrapped, rather fought how to efcape than adventure the fight: howbeit, above fix thoufand of the Turks were loft, the reft efcaping to ErzJmm which the old Baffa had made his head-quarter at that feafbn. Erurum is a Town of great ftrength, both by fcituation and Art, and by reafon of its voicinage to the Perfian Dominions ufually made the place of rendez vous when the Turks have any defign againft that Empire : a place of great import to them, in that befides the advantage it gives of recruits it affords portage of neceffaries both from the Mid-land Euxin and Cafpian Seas : The Countrey it ftands in is Cappado- cia, Leucofyria of old j divided by the River Euphrates from Armenia^ and on the other hand hath Caramama, which comprehends thofe Provinces in former times called Lyciay Cilicia, Pamphylia and Carta, places now totally under the Mahometan, who have extin- guiihed the Chriftian light and intereft as if it never had been, and in all their conquefts give Kingdoms, Provinces and great Towns new Names, beft pleating their fancies; but thereby rendring the queft obfcure nay, in barbarifm burying in oblivion as much as in them lyes the very memory of thofe and other famous places. Amnrath refolving to fall into Hungary and thofe parts thought fit to call home Sinan- Bajfa to advife concerning that War. To which end he conftituted Mahomet-Bajfa (Ne phew to Mnftapha ) General againft the Perfians. At Er^irum he took the mufter of all his Army, which was fo numerous and the feafbn fo good that he forthwith took the field and marched unrelifted as far as the River Araxis ( now called Arafa ) burning and doing all the fpoil be could. Emir-Hamzje by his Scouts having notice of their num bers and approach, ordered Tocomac with Symon the Georgian ( the Perfians approved friend ) to hinder the further entrance of the Turk fo well as they could, the General following with the reft of his Horfe and Dragoons, The Turks animated by the fuccefs they had, and by the running away of the people ftill where they came, fuppofing no force near, continued their march towards Tauris, till upon a Hidden the Perfian Horfe difcovered themfelves and engaged with lb great hafte and valour, that notwithftanding the inequality of numbers, the Perfian Horfe made good the ground until they were over-powered by fome referve of Horfe Mahomet orde red to renew the charge: but by fome prifbners he took, underftanding that the Periian Prince ( whofe Name was terrible to the Turk ) was at hand, he thought it the beft way to retreat, and accordingly marched back with double the hafte he came on which the Perfian Prince no fooner knew, but that with unufual fpeed he followed the Enemy in the rear,and with fuch advantage that in their over-hafty pafling the Rivers many of the Turks were drowned and no lefs number killed in the field: a lofs fb difcouraging the youthfull BafTa, that after he had reproached the Apoftate Georgian Prince as if he had occafioned that milchance, he ceafed not marching till he arrived at Tephlis, not daring to look his Enemy in the face until he had recruited. About this time Ebrahhn-chawn Ambaffa- dour from the Perfian King received an unufual affront at Conftantinople at the Circumci- fion of Mahomet eldeft Son to AmUrath, without any provocation given by the Ambaf^ fador the AmbafTadour being contra jus Gentium made clofe prifbner for fome time, and his Attendants likewife confined in houfes infeded with the Plague. The defign was principally to let the other Ambaffadours fee how little the Grand Signior valued the Perfian King, ^ Sha-Mahometj albeit the mif-ufage of his fervantwas ground fufficient to dene the Tur^ o 0 2 y et184- The City Tauris taken by the Turl^ yet feeraed to take little notice of that affront: fo unhappy was he in the difference 'twixt his two Sons j which gre w to that height as made it feem paft reconciliation, and at length threatned a civil War: VotJbbasy albeit the younger Brother, having courage enough, and much more craft than Emir-Ham^ was not afraid to proceed in-his difloyal pradi- ces to fupplant his Brother and vex his Father, whofe age inclined him rather to purfue peace than war. Notwithftanding which, perceiving reftlefs in his defigns, he was, by the advice of his great Officers, perfwaded to proclaim him Rebel ^ and with a confi' derable power to march towards Heri to reduce him if he could. Ahhas fb loon as he un- derftood his Fathers intent, prepared for fight*, but through the advice of fome friends he had about the King, was at length prevailed with to lubmit, and by the King (upon promife of future obedience) embraced and pardoned ^ to the great diflike of Emir- Hamper, and alio of his Father-in-law Salmas Mirzji ; the laft of which, through the fubtil and faife fuggeftions of Abb a* to the King, was foon after made fhorter by the head*, and but introductory to Emir-Hamneh approaching mine: for Abbas perceiving that his Bro ther was not to be overcome by force, by fraud attempted it. In the mean time Ferrat- chan was made Commander in chief over the Turks againft Perfia: and having prepared all things neceflary for an Invafion, a Mutiny unexpededly hapned in the Camp which grew to that height as loft him that Summers opportunity, and made him continue about Erzinm : but gave the greater advantage unto the Ferfian. Emir-chan, at that time Governour of Tmris, falling (how juftly is not known) into the King's difpleafure had his Eyes thruft out^ and being under clofe reftraint, in few months dyed, thereby having eafe: but his command was given to Alliculi-chan-, who be ing taken Prifoner by the Turks in their march through Georgia, made his efcape from Eerrat-chan: who having done as little as thofe before him, was called home, and Ofman- Bajfa fucceeded in his place. This Bafla was quick of refolution, and by nature fierce: from all thofe parts of Afta as far as Babylon he had power to draw together what force he pleafed: and refolving with himfelf to harrafsthe Ferfian Territories with Fire and Sword, heimbodiedattheufual place of Rendezvous two hundred tiioufand Horfeand Foot,and with a fuitable train of great Guns he drew from Trcp^ond through the Georgian Countrey pafs'd uninterruptedly into Adediazlmoft, in view of Tmris, deftroying the Ene mies Quarters all the way. Emir-ham^e the Perjian General,formerly acquainted with the Turks manner of march, advanced againft them with ten thoufand good Horfe, the King following the Prince his Son with eighty thoufand Horfe and Foot more; fo that a more gallant Army was not feen, nor better commanded in Perfia in the memory of Man. Five leagues to the Southwards of Tauris the Perfian Prince encamped, expeding the coming of Ofman ; who continued his march: and having the advantage both in numbers and a large train of Artillery which he heard the Perfian Horfe would not endure, refol- ved to try the fortune (as they call it) of the Field. The Perfian Prince deliring his Fa ther to quicken his march, refolved the like: So as the City Tauris interpofing and garri- fon'd by the Perfian^JllicHlUhan being Governour, Ofman thought it not fafe to havefo confiderable an enemy in his rear, and therefore drawing before the place, e're he could fummon it the Governour made fo bravea fally that above a thoufand Turks were flain, and the Perfians made a fafe retreat with little lofs.

That part of the Army which efcaped made fo unpleafant a relation unto Ofman that it increafed his diftemper info- much as within few dayes after he gave up the Ghoft •, leaving the condud of his Mat tered Army to the Bajfa Synan Cicala^ a good Souldier and a wary r and who in a re treat he made towards Fan gave the Per fan a notable blow, yet when he came to Erayrum and took the mufters of his remaining Force, found that in this unhappy Expe dition Ozman one way or other had loft a hundred thoufand of his Men. The Perfian Prince not thinking it advifable to follow the Enemy too far returned back to cJhn where he was imbraced by ftis aged Father, honoured by all the Officers, and little Ids than adored by the vulgar fort; but after a little refrefhment, remembring that Tauris continued under the power of the Turk , he was reftlefs in his defires to reduce that con- fiderable place i notwithftanding that by his fcouts he was truly informed of their ftrength and good accommodation, moft of the Soul^ers having Huts in a large Fort or Barbican Ofman with great labour and expence had raifed and fortified notably with great Ordnance, fo that Giaffen with his 15000 Foot having vidualled the Forts fuppo- led that he was able to defend the Place againft all the Force Perfia could bring. In this interim Mahomet-chan had the command of the Armenian Auxiliaries who were upwards of 10000 Men, with whom he marcht towards Tanris which he fummoned, but in vain *, and being without order from the Perfian General knew it would be ill refented - therefore as one in defpair and to increafe his account he proclaimed Mirz^a Thomas Ma homet's youngeft Son, King and with joyful acclamations direded their way towards hyn. The old King marvailed at his infolence, and forthwith fent Emir-hamz.e againft this Gonfpirator *, who for fome time ftood his ground againft die Prince, but being worfted took him to his heels •, and being clofe purfued was apprehended near Cajhan, and his head being cut off prefented to the King then at Casbyn: but the poor abufed Prince up on the acknowledgment of his fault which he neither deiigned nor well could help, was forgiven; albeit for fome time confined to his Houfe. Thefe alternate oilt-breakings of the King's Sons not onely difturbed the old King's reft, but retarded the neceffary preparations to oppofe the Turks frelh Forces that were ready to march for reducing the City of Tauris ; and withal perplext the Spirit of Emyr~hamz.e, whofe whole defign was the publique welfare of his Countrey and an ho nourable defence againft the Turi^: whereas his Brother Abbas had other devices in his head, which were by what means he might make his quickeft accefs to the Crown ^ and his unnatural wifh as wicked as it was wanted not inftruments to effed his defires,amongft whom was Alichiily-Chan, who in meer envy bore a conftant ill will unto Prince Emyr- hamz.eyzS6 Mbas-mir^a's envy to Emir-ham^e. hamz.e 7 znd as occafion ferved was ftill ready to eclipfe his Iplendor and to leflen him in his Father's repute, which was the eafier to be done, the Bmyr's Victories and popular applaufe drawing mofb Mens eyes and expectations upon that rifing Sun, which made him jealous of his own eftate and of the others fetting before his time. Perrat Bap in the imrm with a great Army, moft of which were drawn out of the Garrifons in Provinces round about, quickens his march for the feafonable relief of Tan- ris which though not befieged was diftreft for Vidual and by Fluxes and other Dilleni- pers had loft many of its Men. The Verfian King routed by this advance of the Ene- my, by the perfwafions of his Son Ahhas commiffioned Alicnly-chanhis friend to go Com mander in chief 'of an Army diftind from that his Brother Emyr-hamae commanded: for which end he drew what Horfe he could from his Government in Hery and Moz,en m dram^ having order alfo to joyn with Emangoli-chanwho from his Government about Larr and Shyraz. brought about 15000 Horfe, the Prince intending to follow with the main ^ Body of Horfe and Foot which was about 40000 more. Emangoly-chan by the Princes diredions haftened to difcover the Enemy, and in beating up the Quarters of Zeyml-ehm near Salmas made fome execution *, and with like good hap the Baffa of Revian ; which accelerated Ferrat\ march: But fo foon as Aliculy-chan faw the Turkijh Army, without the lealtrefiftance , he drew back, incouraging the Enemy to profecute their way, har- raifing the Countrey where ever they came, fuffering him to relieve Taufis and to waft the greateft part of Shervan. This treacherous ad of Alicdi-can was well worth punilh- ment •, but the Enemy over-fpreading the Country with his Horfe hindred the Prince to . give that oppofition he intended and would have been enabled to do, had his Brother Abbas his Men been at his command: fo that inftead of looking towards the Enemy he marcht after Aliculi-chany who fearing to encounter the Prince, 'kept onhis way towards Kabul and marcht after fuch a rate that the Prince thought it not beft to profecute that wretch at that time&gt; but rather to return and joyn with Emangoli-chan: which being done, and many Volunteers coming in beyond imagination to lerve the Prince againft the common adverfary, he was fo over-joy'd therewith that he was fully refolved fpee- dily to encounter Fen at in the open Field. But alas! when he was in the meridian of fair hopes and in a place thought moft free from any treafonable attempt, he was by a corrupted Eunuch murthered whilft he took fome reft upon a pallat in his Tent: fuppofed by the procuration of Aliculi-chan, and not without the fufpicion of Abbas his know ledge, who by his Brothers death was undoubted Heir unto the Crown. An ad fo villa- nous, and at fuch a time, as gave the Turks caufe to rejoyce; but Terfia became over whelmed with amazement and grief. The King by the breaking of his ftaff found himfelf weakly fupported and ready to drop into the Earth, never having one joyful day more, hut fpending the-little remnant of his Life in continual forrow. The Army like wife had fuch fad apprehenfions, as if in the Prince's death they had all gone with him to the grave, feeming carelefs and heartlefs to give any further refiftance to the Turks fo large a fhare had this generous Prince in the hearts of the People: yea^ the whole Nation by the fet ting of this bright Star feem'd clouded and vail'd with everlafting night, their light be ing thus miferably extinguifh'd by the bafenefs of a treacherous Varlet, imploy'd by bafe and cowardly Men: but the Eunuch after ftrid examination was exquifitely tortured; whiles the Body of this great Prince was with all polTible demonftrations of love in Se~ ftember 1586. convey'd to Ardaveil, where he was interred near the Dormitories of his Royal Anceftors. Ferrat-chan the Turhijh General though as a noble Enemy, he could not refrain fome fhew of fbrrow for this Hero's death, yet let not flip his advantage •, but in fhort time made tributary the whole Territory about Genjre, and forced contribution from Sumachy and all the Countrey 'twixt that and the Cajpian Sea : Notwithftanding which good fer- vice, being called home and fucceeding worfe in the Tranfilvanian War, the next year he was fummoned by the Vizier of Stambul, and by a fecret order put to death. Cicala Bajfa Govemour of Bagdat by order from the Royal port fucceeded Ferrat in his Charge for the Perfian War. He wafted the Median Territories which lie upon the Frontiers of Mefopotarnia called DUrbec, which were Quarters that had not been fpoiled of long time: but whiles Mahomet was ordering Emangoly-chan to attend Cicala's motion, Amurath the better to profecute his intended War m Europe, by his Ambaffador defired a Ceffation of Arms with the which the Perfian the better to inlarge his Domi nion towards Candahor and Chabul willingly condefcended unto; fo as Articles were agreed and figned^ and Hoftages on each fide given according to form: and peace pro claimed at Conflantimfle and Casbyn. Howbeit in lefs than three years the Perfian Ho- ita^e dying at Conftantinople, inafmuch as he was the King's Nephew, his Body was im- balmcd,igg 'Bagdat Sha Jhhas now moving prince-like in his own Orb, for the better fpreading of his fame and engaging againft his inveterate adverfary the Turfo difpatched Ambafladouts to feveral parts of the world : Zenal-chan was fent to Rodolph the Emperour^ Methiculi- he? to the Kin^ of Poland, Jusbaffa-Hujfan to Henry the Fourth of France, Philip the Fourth of Svatn and the Venetian Republique •, with Initrudions to treat with them about com merce with Perjia, arid a joint League againft their common Enemy the Turk 5 and Ma. hornet Rofarbe* to ShawSelym the great Mogul, ^chmat having intelligence how aftive the Perfian was todifturb his progrefs abroad aganift the Chnltians, to find him work at home commands Najfuph-Baffa to draw all the force of Horfe and Foot he could to the ufual place of rendezvous in order to the profecuting the Perfian : but thofe levies came to little effed by reafon of the peace that upon the Perfian Ambafladours repair to Co^ (lantinoplewM foon after agreed betwixt thofe two great Mahometans, contrary to the Perfiam late propofition, and unhappily to the difappomting the Ghriftian Princes defign.

The Turks foon after this, viz.. Anno Dom. 1618. by the way of BmirHm entred Me dia, the Army being commanded by Ally-baffa ; who taking the opportunity of the Kings abfence in Candahor paifed unoppofed as far as Ardaveil which he plundred, and harraffed the Countrey about, Cardagy-chanxht ^Governour of Tabriz, and at that time Prelident of thofe parts not doing any thing confiderable for prevention : upon the ad vance of Emir~Hamz.e-mirz,a the Turks retreated to Van, and a Truce was prelently con cluded. But the Turk ere long infilling upon the reftitution of the City T auris, the War was frelhly profecuted. The command of the Perfian Army was given Emir-Hamze the Prince, who in the expreffion of his courage, quick'nefs of execution, and happy fuc- cefs, appeared to the Turk no other than as if his Uncle had revived ^ and withal fo pru dent in managing the War, that though he well knew it was attended with jealoufie and accidents of feveral kinds which rendred the event uncertain •, neverthelefs fuch was the excellency of his fpirit,and fo juil and honourable the work he was upon, that to engage againft that infoient Enemy was his choiceft recreation: infomuch as the Turks albeit they could not but commend his courage, yet failed they not by fecret artifices at Court to deftroy this gallant perfon by an invifible hand ^ amongft other engines fecretly infi- nuating into the heart of Abbas the danger he was in through the popular efteem of his adive Son : fo as what the Enemy could not effed by dint of fword, was compafled by bale deceit, the Prince being firft made blind, and foon after away by the treachery of his Barber, as was commonly reported. However, his death was fudden, and without queflion by foul pradice of fome who whiles the King was engaged .in the wars of r^an thought to have feized the Crown : but more certain it is, that albeit the King was at firft worfted in Moz.endram, neverthelefs by the'feafonable recruit brought him by Ferrat-chan he quickly recovered that lofs, quieted thofe parts about Larry-Joon, and returning beat the Rebels near Casbyn 5 where having made terrible flaughter, amidft his paifion Hemir-Hamz^e by the Kings command was made blind by. a hot polilhed fteel drawn afore his eyes: which having formerly related needs no repetition. Abbas not ftaying for the Turk as the cuftome of his Anceftors had been, thought fit to begin with them; and taking the opportunity of their being engaged in Hungary (with tne entire conqueft whereof the Turk is reftlefs in defign) in the head of a royal Army he quickly cleared Shervan, ahen expelled the Enemy out of Fan and T eyhlis, and foon alter maftered Balfora and Bagdat •, the laft of which through treachery was fbon after retaken by the Turk. The Perfian King in this interval had good intelligence from Stam- hid concerning the diftradions of that place, which was welcome news to the Court of Perfia.Infolency of the Janizaries* of Ferfm. For indeed, fo infolent appeared the Janizaries there at that time, as upon fome Height difguft given by Delavir the Grand-Vifier^ they broke in upon the Bajfa, and by violent hands put him to death an outrage fo intolerablejthat Ofman the Grand Seignior could not choofe but reprove them for fo rafh a fad : but to fueh a height of preemption were they foared, as they firft fecured the Emperour under a Guard, and foon after murdered him^ not without the fecret infinuations (as fome imagine) of his Uncle Muftapha, whom thereupon the mutinous Janizaries firft mounted into the Tiirone and as quickly dethroned, having a better opinion of Mmat the Brother of Ozman, whom in that confufion they proclaimed King. This uproar at the Imperial Port gave the Ghriftian Princes hopes that great Body would burft through its own weight and inteftine diftemper: the rather for that the Baila of Natolia Jbafi-Bajfa (or Afaphy as they pronounce) taking the advantage of that diforder thought fit to try what he could do to let up for himfelf: Abbas alfo equally va luing that opportunity, with a confiderable Body of Horfe and Dragoons invaded Diar- hec i and having with a round fum corrupted one of the principal Officers in Bagdatj he not onely appeared but got entrance into the City before Achmat the Governour had any timely notice for prevention: fo that having maftered the Town, the Governour durft not truft unto the Gittadel and Barbican within&gt; fo as he fecretly withdrew with a a fmall party of Horfe into Karamania ; which flight fo difcouraged thofe he left behind, as upon firft fummons the Forts were delivered up: Yea, fuch was the reputation of ma- Itering that important place, that not onely Mifdin and Merdin two other notable Forts yielded to Abbas-, but the whole Province difpatched Perfons to acknowledge their fub- mifhon; infomuch as all thofe People who inhabited thofe Gountreys through which Ti gris and Euphrates run, even from Armenia to Balforac upon the Perjian Gulph (terrified with this fudden and fuccefsful in-road) as one Man fubmitted to the Perfian Crownthe redudion Of thofe warm Countreys encouraging feveral Perfian Subjedsto repair thither to plant*, whiles the T urhs (fuch as would not lift themfelves under the Perfian ) utterly deferted thofe parts, and in feveral Bodies retired fome into Syria, others into sAEgyft't whereby the Perfian had the fole Dominion over thofe Provinces, both to the heightnmg the Per fan reputation abroad and confternation of the Turks that by this time were com- pofed at home, and AIly-BaJfa (who had the command of thofe revolting Countreys,) for his negligence in that affair was made fhorter by the head. Natolia alfo was in a trembling motion at that time: for Abaffi-Baffa ftood upon his guard. It fo happened that the Perfian judging he was really revolted doubted not but he would contribute what he could to efpoufe the Perfian in his defence ^ and for tryall they tempted him to deliver Erzymm into their hands: the crafty Baffa counterfeiting a willingnefs fo difpofed of his own Men that a thoufand (moft of them Georgians) of the five thoufand that; were fent f to take poffeffion, were cut off. An ad lb welcome to the 7&gt;ias ingratiated him at Court •, inafmuch as rich prefents were fent him from Stambdy with folemn proteftations of oblivion for his Revolt, and an encreafe of force and continuance of Command ^ all which fo well fatisfied the young Baffa, that after a return of thanks he immediately fell into with all the force he could make, and near Mofid happily gave a notable defeat to a confiderable party of Horfe and Foot which the Perfian had ordered for the better fecurity of that Garrifon and Countrey thereabouts. This lofs ftartled Abbas fomewhat, but more when he received news how about that time the Georgians who were in Alliance with the Turk^ had killed many of his Men near Van, and as a further evidence of their hatred, fent their heads to the Impe rial Port as a teftimony of their fervice: which complement was requited with thanks from thencebut otherwife foon after by Abbas, who paid them in their own coyn for their future inftrudion. Abaffi-Baffa in this interim improved his time ; for being ma- fter of the Field he both ranged and harrafled that miferable Countrey without any mercy. Abbas by thofe that fled had notice of the Turks ftrength, and of his drawing before Bag-- dat, which refolutely refufed his fummons: and for the better prefervation thereof in the head of thirty thoufand Horfe marched towards the Enemy notwithftanding they were double his number. The Turks neverthelefs refolved to continue the Siege. Ab bas by an Herald challenged the Turks •, but by the advice of a Council of War it was held advifeable rather to intrench themfelves and to ftreighten the Siege, than to; draw off and fight. Howbeit, the Per fan Horfe gave them continual alarms, ana fo cut off provifions from abroad that in lefs than thirty dayes they were reduced to more want than they within the Town. Which fo perplexed the Turk, that to the amazement even of their own Camp taking the advantage of the night Abdffi drew oft, and having P pI 'Death of Shaw-Abbas Sophy. got the Tigris 'twixt him and his adverfary made the beft retreat he could with ba^ and baggage: but having a Train of Artillery withal to draw, could not make fuch hafte but- that the Perfians got over Tigris at length, and had a nimble purfuit of the Turks for ten dayes, and with fuch effed as very few of them efcaped. A Vidory fo remarkable and obtained'with fo little lofs as m twenty years time a greater was not recorded •, fo as thp memory of it at this day lives frefh all over Perfia *, as appeared by feveral Sonnets amon?ff them at my being in that Countrey about five years after. Jbhas having fufficjently fcoured thofe Weftern parts,was no lefs adive and fuccefsfnl elfewhere: For the next year viz.. 1627. by the good condud of Cvrchiki-cawn he totally ex pulled the TurKowt of Shrvanznd Ghey Ian, and reduced the Natives to their allegiance' and by Tamas-Cooli-heg likewife annexed Mozendram to his Empire^ having done the like a little before by Lolla-beg and Zmangoly-cavon in the conqueft of Larr, Karmaen Or mwy Chufiftan, Macron, and part of Ajaman and Jaurey: fo as he extended his ferri' tories one way from Indus to EaphrateSy and the other from the Caspian Sea to Babylon and the Gulph of Perfta-, which to this day they keep, to the elevation of the honour of that Crown, and confternation of the neighbouring Pontentates. In this fort, Jhhas,after he had attained to a higher exaltation of glory than any of hi? Race, the whole courfe of his command being full of fplendor, died in the year 162R of the Heg. 1008. after he had lived full fourfcore years, and ruled the Empire fort v three. His Body was from Coshyn tranflated to Ardaveiiy and buried near the Corps of his great Anceftors, and in his place So fee his Grand-fon was proclaimed Kins- who after he had fwayed the Scepter about fifteen years being likewife fummoned by impar tial Death was buried at Coomy and fucceeded by his Son Abbas, a Prince of great courage and prudence at this day, and likely to preferve what his Royal Progenitors committed to his infpedion and Government. &amp; 1X111X6(1 Thus having run over the Series of the Kings-, in the next place I fliall offer my mixt Obfervations concerning that Kingdom: together with a little fupplement relating to their Religion*, after which I fhall proceed in our Travels.

But how fmall fo- . ever it feem now to others, the p^«neverthelefs makes many forts of Harvefts* filling every year his Coffers with above three hundred and fifty feven thoufand Tomans' (a To man is five Marks Sterling,) in our Money about 1 190000 Pound Sterling; a Revenue themoreto be admired, fincehe extrafts it principally from raw Silk, Cuftoms and Cot ton ; albeit he thinks not any way dilhonourable that brings in Money. ^unfradet Amor] So thought and thence derived that cnftome ot fending into the Market his daily Prefents of Fruits and Flowers: a kind of thrift ordinarily pradi- b y fe greateft Potentates in Jfm, and of which he not only boafted (not as ^/&lt;- Umdid of his polt-foot) but feeraed to complain of the nicety of other Princes in that particular.

Nor do the Perfian Kings now refemble thofe their great Anceftors who were governed by the Statute Laws: for in Dart. 6. 7. it is recorded That the Prefidents of the Kingdome, the Governours, Princes, Councellours and Captains confulted together to ordain a roy al Statute, eftablifhed by Dariw his figning, which expreffed the Royal alfent: but ra ther what the fame Prophet told Beljhaz.zar that Nebuchadnez.z,ar alfumed, Dan. 5. 19. Whom he would he flew? and whom he would he kept alive *, he fet up and pulled down as he lifted: and according to that pattern the Eaftern Princes whether Mahometans or Gen tiles demean themfelves, ufurping an abfolute Dominion: againft which, the Civilians in defence of the Law of Nature complain Quod Vrincipi placuit, Levis UUc habet viao- rem, &amp;c. Law, made adequate to the will of the Ruler. A memorable prefident we have in that fearfull ihift or expofition the Magi gave one of the Perfian Kings when he defired to marry his Daughter, telling him There was no Law to warrant fuch a fad *, but a Law they found that the King might do what he lift : but ad libitum mutare Leges, quia Regnum datur propter Regem was no good Comment: for it is a maxim that Omnis Regni poteftas referri debet ad bonum Regni, whereas a Panbafilay levels Princes with Peafants, And indeed in this glafs I wifii we that live under Chriftian Kings and States could fee our own freedome and happinefs: efpecially above thofe that live in unnatural bon dage under fuch as acknowledge Mahomet ; For not without due acknowledgment be it ^ remembred, that in Europe the Sub}eds under molt Chriftian Kings and States are gover ned by wholibme Laws, have lives and properties preferved, yea, befides municipals have the^ Jura naturalia which are held immutable, preferved •, agreeable to that great Aphorifm of Nature?

How oft are their children ra- vifhed from them and forcibly circumcifed ? with other cruelties, too many to be here 12 That*therefore which the.Perfian Kings of old fo much gloried in, Se ejfe Vonijnos om* mum Homimm, &amp;c. is now their dodrine : for they have power of life and death j con- demn without hearing ^ difpofe of mens perfons and eftates when and as they pleafe with out any refped of right elpecially at mens deaths,where there is any confiderable Eftate j the heir not prefuming further than to inventory, feeing the King hath the fole power of difpofure and fo, as in the dividend 'tis well if a tenth come to the right iiiheritor,as v/e under ft and right. Such alas is the cuftome and conftitution of thole Eaftern Coun treys ! where the beft reafon they have is That in all Ages they have been nuzzled under that fort of Government, and through long cuftome ufed to adore their King ; fo that as of old they are not content to reverence him as the Image of God who (as Plutarch in the life of Themiftocles albeit a Gentile doth confefs) by his infinite wifdome governs and preserves all things, with Orpheus account him Animata Dei imago in terris, and with Ho mer thel)eft beloved Son of Jove but have a more tranfcendent efteem and opinion con cerning him : For they retain the fame repute as in former times their Anceltors did of their elemental Deities: Per fas loco Deorum habere Keges, faith v£fchilus, a Worihip aifu- med firft by Cyrus upon his conqueft of Babylon^ after which time proftrations were ordinarily made by thefubjeds. So as one in their excufe faith, non pie folum fed etiam prudenter Reges fuos inter Deos colebant, profirato corpore Regem venerantur.y Plutarch in vita Themifloclts : with which kind of adoration, Heliogabalm was ferved, more Perfarum, faith the Hiftorian. But we may fuppofe this was a civil not a divine honour. Neverthelefs from that reverential awe, they prefumed not either to fpitor cough in prefence of the King, a cuftome anciently pradifed (as Xenophon obferves)or in publique affemblies appear other than inanimate Statua's *, and as of old, pull their hands within their fleeves in lign of fer- vitude, forbearing for thofe times in his prefence .to fpeak to one another, or probably to think amifs, vlor fome of the fimpler fort liippofe he knows their very thoughts: So as at the receipt of any Letter from him they firft give it a mombarroc or folemn refped by the bowing their bodies and kifling the paper before they read; and fwear ufually by his head, as Shaw-ambajhy and Serry-jhaw, than which they have not a more lolemn atte- ftation. But herein they imitate others of old**, for in Gen. 42. 16. we find Jofephfazw- ing by the life of Pharaoh. The Greeks alfo as Juvenal obferves jurare paratis per Caput alterius were ufed to fwear by one anothers head ; which the Romans themfelves likewife imitated as appears by Ovid in his Epiftles, Per que tuum mflrumq. Caput quod junximus una juro and by Sil. lib. 10. Adjuro teque tuumque Caput : but the Perfians l)efides the head l\vore by the Kings right handfor that was the Oath Darim gave T erem the Eunuch when chofen to attend the Princefs Statira, afterwards married to Alexander: yea, they apprehend that the King fees in all places, as may be prefumed by pointing tjieir finger to the eye and faying Chafh i. e. the King fees •, and his words efteemed Apophthegms are many times regiftred as well as deeds in Cedar Tablets gumm'd with Cinnaber, his Name ufually writ with gold upon paper of a curious glofs and finenefs varied into fe- veral fancies, elfeded by taking oyl'd colours and dropping them feverally upon water, whereby the paper becomes fleek and chamletted or vein'd in fuch fort as it refembles A- gat or Porphyry. In a word, they fpare not to parallel their King with Mahomet and Allyj and as accuftonied of old, ingeminate De noftris Annis tibi J upiter augeat Aunos, i 0 f s 0 f oHrs fa G ^ s p re f crve fty life. Yea,Oriental mode concerning Hair.

So that upon the whole, under moit miferable fervitude thefe wretched Mahometans do live; happy onely in not being fenfible^ which they the better endure, not knowing what a free Subjed: means, and for that tl^y are indulged to the height of corrupted appetite And yet, although the King himfelf be incircumfcriptible and have his Sic volo, Cic m beo allowed him^ neverthekfs (well knowing that maxim true Sceptrorum vis tot J perk cum verdere jufla Incept-, for 'tis Juftice that fupports the Crown*, and that fine Le?e qmdfunt Regno, nifi latrocinia ? without law, what do Kingdoms differ from places of Rob bery ? ) for the avoiding confufion and prefervation of the peace. Laws or rather Cu- ftoms they have which are ftridly executed ; for the Souldiery they are fubjeded under Ordinances of War ^ the reft under a kind of Imperial Law, which ferves to diitineuifh meum and mum betwixt the Subjed: For which end in moft Cities and great Towns Caw- fees and other Magiftrates are appointed, who have power from the King to call per- fbns, examine witnelfes, and to hear and determine bulinefs 'twixt party and party, yea to award judgment in caufes civil and criminal, with little charge and ftort attendance' and in criminals, no place affords more fevere proceedings: which is the reafbn that the Countrey isfofecure, and Travellers can fcarce find a more quiet place than Perfia. But feeing the Cawfees have a latitude allowed them in Adjudications and accept of gifts' I fear they may be corrupted and biaffed •, which too oft blinds the eyes and makes Inno cence the Delinquent. Now concerning the Natives they are generally well-limb'd, and ftraight-, the Zone they live in makes them tawny •, the Wine cheerful, Opium falacious. The Women paint- the Men love Arms^ all affed Poetry: what the Grape inflames, the Law allays, and example bridles. The Verfians allow no part of their Body hair except the upper lip 7 which they wear long and thick and turning downwards i as alfo a lock upon the crown of the head, by which they are made to believe their Prophet will at the Refurredion lift them into Paradife. A figment, whether proceeding from Mahomet's own brain or the Apo- ftate Monk his Affociate, uncertain : but probable it is he had read the Scripture, and there in Ezech. 8. 3. and in the Apocryphal ftory of Bel and the Dragon finds Ah acne io tranfported from Jadea to Babylon, for elfewhere their head is fhaven, or made inca pable of hair by the oyl Dowae, being but thrice anointed. This has been the mode of the Oriental People fince the promulgation of the Alcoran, introduced and firft im- pofed by the Arabians. But that the wearing hair and covering the head was other- wife of old, appears in Hiftory very plainly. Hair was worn according to the humour of feveral Nations, agreeable to the tempe rature of the place and Natures didate: for in Countreys more inclining to the Poles than the nAEqaimtiial ufually Men fence their Heads from cold with long hair; but in more temperare climes hair is curt, and commonly expofed to the air for refreshment: but within the torrid Zone their head was kept warm to ward off the penetrating beams of the Sun^whofe ardour could not be endured- The Romans living in the mid-way 'twixt .the Tropic and Polar Circle fhaved not their heads, yet wore their hair fhort according to the modern fafliion of the Spaniard, as may appear by Medals and Other Antiquities, in which the Cafars for the firft two Centuries are fo reprefentedalbeit the firft was fo called for having a bufh of hair upon his head at the Birth. Amongft the Jews alfo of old it was the cuftom to wear it Ihort, as may be gathered from 1 Cor. 11.14. where by way of interrogation the Apoftle faith. Both not Nature it felf teach you, that if a Man have long hair, it is a jhameunto him? with confideration had unto the Climate. Never- thelefs in fome cafes long hair was aliow'd i as to the frfazjtritesy who feparating from the World dedicated themfelves to the Lord, and by that Vow fiiffered no rafbur to come upon their heads, but permitted their locks to grow to full length, Num. 6,5. as exem plified in Samuel, the Baftift and others: For albeit our Saviour in 3/^/^.2.2 3. is called a Nazarite, that was rather from the City Nazareth, feeing he refrained not Wine, as may be fuppofed by the Marriage at Cana in Galilee and the Inftitution of the Eucharift-, and by that the Jews detradingly imputed Luke 7. 34. But that Princes and Perfons of Quality in thofe times wore long hair is evident by feveral prefidents: Ifhall inilance Ahfalom, who wore his hair fo long and fo large that cutting it once every year it is faid to weigh two hundred fhekels by the King's weight,which made fix pound ^nd four ounces allowing the fhekel half an ounce: notmentionedby way of reproach, (albeit what he made his pride became his judgement, for it is faid. That none in Ifrael ^ fo praifedfor beauty, as Abfalom,) but rather an ornament. Nor can it be deny'd.The Perfian mode conce but fhort hair at fome time and in fome places was a fymbol of fervitude. Befides, it ap pears by the effigies at Chil-mymr (where I touched a little upon this fubject) that melt of the Monarchs of old wore their hair very long and crifped, and as particularly inftari- ced by Plutarch in the defcription of Jfiyages. A comet with a bulh appearing in rejp^ fians reign, and by fome Aftronomers judged to portend his death, he wittily made this reply, That bulhy ftar points not at me who am bald, but rather at the comet-like locks of my brother the King of Tarrhia. The Gauls alfo of old were denominated from their hair, Comati y Neque enim fa erat Vrancor urn regihm com am tender e, fed a yueritia intonfi manebantj adeo tit a tergo crines defiuant 5 nam a fronte difcriminati utrinqyfernntur^ Car an- ciennement tousles INoblcsportoient de longs chcveux , O*c» lays a French hiltorian* In a word, Cxfaries fignum crat nohilitatis* And the JBritainSy our Anceftors, of old, as now, imitated their tranfmarine neighbours, as appears by antique Coins and otherwife. So that albeit the Monks from a Tradition lhave the upper part of their head by way of diftindion from the Laity and for dedication, yet therein they differ from the Levitical Priefthood, who (except in lamentations, as in Jfa. 15. 2.) were not luffered to make bald parts upon their head, ihave their beards, or make incifions in their fleih, Levit.u, 5. which laft is now pradtifed amongft Mahometans^ But not to run into extreams: as amongft the primitive Chriitians it was a reproach to wear long hair, fo was it to be bald ; therefore to avoid that contempt, fuch as had Ihort hair wore raifed caps, fuch as lhaved wreathed their heads with rolls of linnen not onely for ornament but to expel the Suns piercing rayes, and for defence againft an Enemy *, for undoubtedly thofe large Turbants the Turks wear over a flat-crown'd quil ted cap is a very ferviceable head-piece. Thofe in Perfia are exceffive large and valuable, albeit commonly of Callico; for the fuperiour fort of people have them woven with Silk and Gold with a rich fringe or talfel of Gold and Silver at the end : but at feafts, entertainments and gaudy-dayes 1 have feen them wreath their Shafhes with ropes of orient Pearl and chains of Gold fet with precious ftones, of great value. That which the King himfelf has on differs not in lhape from others, unlels it exceed for magnitude : all the difierenee I could obferve was that he wore it the contrary way and more ered than others. Which put me in mind of that which Plutarch mentions concerning Jrta- xerxes, who in his old age caufing his Son Cyrus to be proclaimed King, gave him the royal prerogative of wearing the pico or top of his Cydaris upright^ not permitted any fubjed- Some glimple of that head-tire or Tiara we have in Plut. vita Antonii ; which noble Roman gave order for a high and rich Tribunal to be ereded in the molt publick place of Alexandria, where he and Cleopatra feated themielves in Chairs of burnifhed Gold: two of a leffer fize were fet for their two Sons *, the eldeft was called Alexander, to whom for his fhare of the world he affigned Media-, and Armenia, who that day wore upon his head a rich Tiara which refembled a high-crown'd Hat, and upon his ihoulder a long Veil: according to the royal Robe of Perfia : but Ptolomy the younger (to whom he bequeathed Macedon and other parts of Greece) upon his head had a broad- brimm'd Hat, about which was a fillet or band richly fet with ftones, upon his ftioulder a long Cloak after the Macedonian cut, and upon his feet were embroidered fandals. With thefe Shalhes the Per fians go covered all day long, not excepting the prefence* of the King, nor their fet times of devotion : for to bare or uncover the head is held irreverent. Now as the Enropaans in their falutes ufually take off their Hats in prefence of their betters to bare their heads, the Mahometans fignifie the fame onely by a mode rate deflexion of the head and direding their head towards their heart, by which they ufually exprefs their complement, as noted hyQCurt. But this cuftomecame in with the Alcoranbefore which, the Oriental people. Per pans and others wore a fort of Hat and Bonnet, as yet continued in Chinay where unlefs by the late invafion of the Tartars, Mahomet is not acknowledged : yea, both at falutations and in prefence of fuperiours they were uncovered. So fay Euftathim and Dionyfm two credible witneffes : and Plutarch attefts the like, for faith he. Contra Hofes Caput tegimus, Amicis nudamm 9 \n fight we cover the head againft our Enemies, but fainting our Friends are uncovered. A pradice not onely commended but commanded by S. Paul, 1 Cor. 11. 4. where it is faid That at the exercife of Religious Duties to be covered the head thereby is diihonoured for, that a man ought not to cover his head at thofe times, appears by the feventh Verfe: but as to the other fex, it is otherwife. Now how rigid foever the Turk may feem in abhorring the moving his Turbant, efpecially towards a Chriftian in falutationsthe Perfians ne- verthelefs have more generofity: for with them it is a Maxim, and might be fo with others, That fingularity is difcommendable, as being an humour either fleighting order and de grees of men (allowed Angels,) or otherwife the civil cuftomes and good manners of CountreysCountreys in things indifferent and meerly ceremonial, ferving onely to Cement affedion. And albeit to one another they are flrid enough to that mode or euftom of being coverl ed^ neverthelefs, at Alhamjf after Sir Dodmore Cotton had his Audience, at which Shz- Ahbas was prefent with the Ambafladour, the King his Mafter's health being by Sir Robert Sherley remembred, the Ambalfadour Handing up uncovered, the King (frolick at that time, or rather in civility) took off his Tulipant. Another time, as I heedlefiy eroded the Court where the King was fitting in an open Tent hearing Petitions, 1, according to the pmcppaan mode, made my duerefpefts, by uncovering my head and bowing reverently to wards the King, who obferved it, and was fo well pieafed therewith that he raifed his Tar- bant a little from his brows, both to honour me the more and to exprefs his fatisfadion^ efpecially, as 1 was afterwards told, for that I appeared in my own Countrey Habit: other- wife it had been a prefumption puniihable-, but as it proved, a grace that procured me the more refped, efpecially with the better fort, where-ever 1 paifed. The King indeed took great delight and efteem'd it an addition of luftre to his Court to behold exotiques in their own Countrey Habit: fo that the greater the variety appeared, he would fay the more was his Court and Countrey honoured at home &gt; and in eftimation abroad: infomucJi,as up on any affront done a Stranger, if in his own Habit, he fhould be fure of reparation •, but in cafe he went in the Habit of the Country where he travelled, undillingui/hable when the injury was offer'd, it would be otherwife upon addrefs for vindication: the emphafis it feems wanting that inclined it. Such was then the rule of Court and populous places: albeit in travel Forreigners have their liberty to pleafe themfelves as to their Garb, and without caufeof exception to any. The Afiaticks wear no bands •, their Jljoha or out-fide Veil is ufually of Callico ftitcht with filk, or quilted with Cotten: but the better fort have Veftes polymita Garments of party-co loured filks fome being fatten, fome gold and filver Chamlets, and fome of Bodkin and rich cloth of gold figured •, for variety belt pleafes them: no colour difpleafes but tylack, which is not worn, becaufe they hold it difmal and unlucky. Their fleeves are ftrait and long (varying from the Turk, who have them wide and fhort^ ) their clofe coat ufually reaches to their calves, and bears round. Their waites are girt with fine towels of filk and gold about eight yards long; thofe and the Shafhes diftinguifh the quality of thofe that wear them: Dukes and other of the Noble fort have them woven with gold j Merchants and Coofel-bajhes with filver; of fdk and wool thofe of inferiour rank. Nexttheir skin they wear fmocks or demi-fhirts of cotten, in colour refembling Scotch plad: their breeches like the Irijh trooze have hofe and ftockings fowed together i the Itocking falls not always into their fliooes, but from the ancle down gives to the eye two inches of the leg naked. Their fhooes are of leather well fow'd, but without latchets, and of what colour you can fancy, fharp at the toe and turning upwards, the heels high and fmall fhod with iron or nails ingrailed. This alfo 1 noted,they do not wed themfelves to thefe iron hemi-cycles for thrift or eafe*(they feldom journey far, orgo fwiftly, exercife and fpare diet never agreeing)but to tread in a venerable path of antiquity.

Gloves are of no efteem amongft them,nor Rings of gold i for filver Rings are moft worn: not that gold is lefs valuable (for in other utenfils they have it,)but becaufe Mahomet accord ing to Tradition had one of filver which was left Ozjnan for a Legacy, and charmed with fin- gular properties: None have their Rings of iron, except thofe of bafer fort •, a metal fome account a fymbol of flavery. They paint their nails and hands with Alcanna or Chaa-powder into a red or tawny colour, which befides the ornament it gives cools the liver, and in War makes them (they fay) valiant. Their nails are difcoloured with white and vermilion-, but whyfo, I cannot tell,unlefs it be in imitation of Cj'mf- who as an augmentation of honour commanded his great Officers to tindure their nails and faces with vermilion;, ferving both' to diftinguiffi them from the vulgar, and (as did our warlike Britam) in fight to appear the more terrible. Qji fr* zmTheir Qmalry In their Rings they wearAgats orTurquoifes, which ft ones moft delight them; fpme have their Names or fome word out of the Alcoran engraven in it, with which they fometimes ftamp their Letter: for not one Sword-man amongft a thoufand knows the ufe of letters, the Mnllayes and Clergy that Science v who When they write, frequently do it kneeling either becaufe that pofture is eafier, or that what they didate in that tbrm is reputed holy. Goofe-quills they write not with,but reeds or canes, in which they imitate the Ancients. Their paper is very gloffie, and by dropping oyl'd-colours chamletted and veined like marble: the materials are not rags or skins but Bombafine or Cotton-woblj courfe and requiring much toil to perfed. In wajhing they are not lefs ceremonious than the Jews, whom they feem to imitate, by joyning the tops of the fingers of both hands together with the thumb, which is parabo lical ; this they do, not onely afore and after meals but when they ufe nature v and to that end have Boys who carry an Ewer filled with Water, which in the open Streets they are not afhamed to make ufe of. Their Swords (Shamfheers they call them) are not ftraight as ours be^ but more hooked and bending than our Faulchions-, of ^pure, metal, broad and iharp as any rafour ; nor do they value them, unlefs, if the arm be good, at one blow they can cut in twoan Afinego.

Mifcell. c. 1. and pro bably may take their model from that Machina Sdmonei noted by Virgil^ Homer&gt; Talerim and others- The Women here as of old in other parts of Afia veil their faces in publique. This veiling the face is very ancient both amongft the Jews and Romans. Rebecca when Ihe ap proached Ifaac covered her face Gen. 24. 56. Yea, amongft Men it was a note of re verence, as we find by and by the Apoftle intimated 1 Cor. 11.10. yea, by the Romans ufed ♦, for the Bride was commonly prefented to her Husband with a yellow fcarf thrown over her face. Sulptim Galius (the firft that found out the Eclipfe) repudiated his Wife for fhewing her face when Ihe went abroad. But to defcribe them: I obferved that generally they are low of ftature, yet ftreight and comelymore corpulent than lean. Wine and Mufick fattens them •, the fpleen is curable, where pafTion rules not: and as to complexion it is ufually pale, but made fanguine by adulterate fucus'g. Their hair is black and curled•, their fore-heads high, skin foft, eyes black*, have high nofes, pretty large mouths, thick lips, and round cheeks. Honeft Women, when they take the liberty to go abroad, feldom fpeak to any in the way or unvail their faces. W r hen they travel or follow the Camp, the vulgar fort ride aftride upon Horfes *, but thofe of better rank are mounted two and two upon Camels in Cages (or Cajuaes as they call them) of wood, covered over with cloth, to forbid any Man the light of them.500 Terjianomens Nor is this a new cultome, for P//^rcHn the life of jirtaxerxes mentions the like faying, That the Per pans were fo jealous, that to fpeak to or touch any of the King's Wo! men was ho kfs than death; nay, to approach near their Coaches when they travelled: and inftances fome particulars, as in the Story of Darius when he begged Che fair jijh^ fia for his Concubine, whofe perfedions had Captivated the King alfo. And in that Story of Themftocles the exiled Athenian he relates how that the Perfians jealous of their Wives and Concubines, keep them ftridly mewed up at home*, but abroad carry them in clofe Cajuaes, which were fo covered that no Paifenger could fee them: nor were they drawn with Horfes, but travelled hanging upon Camels. In one of thefe, Thcmiflocles dilguifed in a Womans habit was fecretly conveyed out of Grxcia to the Court of Artax- erxes, where he found more fafety and better welcome than amonft his ungrateful Countrey-men. In one of thefe the laft Darius was conveyed into Mergiana by Btffm that had fhackled him with golden Fetters, JhJI . lib. 11. Agreeable to this, we oft-times had a prolped of the travelling Seraglio'sj and could well perceive that their Guards were pale lean-faced Eunuchs, fo jealous of their charge, that as we travelled 'twas the hazard of our lives if we neglected to haften out of the way fo foon as we faw them- or elfe by throwing our felves upon the ground to cover us with fome veil or other, that the Eunuchs might be fatisfied we durft not, at leaft, were not willing to view them. In one of thefe, for eafe and warmth I my felf was forced to travel upon a Camel above three hundred miles, being fo infeqbled by a Flux as I was not able to ride on Horfe-back, and to keep company with the Carravan was neceffitated to this kind of accommodation. Ho w- beit, that the cuftome was otherwife, appears by that fumptuous entertainment fcrfrmade a thoufand of his Lords, (then coopt up in Babylon) where the King and his Prin ces, his Wives and Concubines drank Wine in thofe golden Veflels Nehuchadne^ar brought thither from the Houfe of God which was at Jerufalem, Dan^, 3. andlikewifeat that magnifick Feaft which Ahafuerus made for an hundred and eighty dayes to the Nobles and Princes of his Empire, Heft. 1. 11. where it is faid, The King fitting on his Throne at Shu ft an the Palace, commanded the Eunuchs to bring Qoeen Faftti with the Crown royal to fhew the People and the Princes her beauty; which was excellent. Plutarch alfo in the life of Artaxerxes notes how that Statira the Queen ufually fate with the King at Meat in publick, and was placed near the King in an open Chariot when he took the air abroad •, the beholding of which (fays the Author) gave great content unto the people.

Howbeit, that manner of lalute is now very olfenfive to the Perfian. Concerning the Arms of Perjia, Zonarat in his firft Book and nineteenth Chapter out of an ancient Monument obferveth, that in old times they bore Luna an Eagle crowned'' of the Sun, dilplayed Saturn $ which continued for many defcents their Royal Enfign, till Cyrus (as in the Empire,in Efcutcheon alfo) made an alteration. Xenophon gives us the view thereof ^ Erat Cyro ftgnum aurea Aquila in longa haft a fufpenfa , &amp; nunc etiam id infigne Perfarum Regibus manet, &amp;c. Born till Craffus perifhed by them, at which time a Sa- gittary was blazoned in their Royal Standard: A fit Emblem of that people, who for skillinHorfemanlhipandfrequent riding might properly be refembkd to a Sagittary: from whence alfo that Coin of Dariques came, a round piece of Gold (fifteen ihillings in our Money,) being ftamped on the one ilde, and a Sagittary (his Coat-armour) on the other •, memorized by Plutarch in the life of Jgefilaus, who complained that liis defign of conquering Jfia was prevented by thirty thoufand Sagittaries meaning a Bribe of fo many pieces of Gold bearing thatftamp, given to betray his Enterprize. But Mahomet when he had yoked their Necks under a two-fold bondage, the other were rejeded, and a Symbol of greater myftery in their Banner diiplayed, viz.. Mercury, a Crefcent Luna, with this impreza, Totum dum impleat Orhem *, alluding to an univerlal command: which fince was borrowed by the French, how properly I know not, but may appear to luchasgo to Fountain-hleau, where that device I faw iterated. But Mahomet's. predidion failed when that Santoon of Ardaveil invented a new Enfign, viz.. Venus, a Lion couchant Sol\ the Sun orient in his Face, of the fame : minted alfo in their Brafs medals, and (as a tie of amity) accepted of by the great Mogul and other neighbouring Princes in India. But the Cawns, Beglerbegs, Sultans (the fame the Greek* called Homotimi, i. e. Perfian Nobles, Satraps the Romans,) Agaes, Soldagars, and Coofel-balhes bear no Coat-Armour ^ not that they are intituled flaves, but from their ignorance in Heral dry: for no honour there is hereditary. Neverthelefs, this I can fay in praife of the Perfian, They are very humane and noble in their natures * 7 differing in their ingenuity and civility to one another, but much more to ftrangers, very much from the Turks, who are rugged and barbarous. For the Perfians allow degrees amongft: themfelves, and of other people have a due efteem according to their birth and quality, yea, give refped agreeable to merit. In old times (commonly though corruptedly fo called, feeing as one fays well our Times are the ancient Times, in that the World is now ancient, and not thofe we count fo by a retrograde computation) they were Idolaters, fuch as the Gowers be now, the Cur- di in Syria, the Perfees in India, the Pegouans, &amp;c. but by converfe with Greeks and Romans, abolilhed their Celeftial worfhip, and (as .relates) received Demonomie, conti nued till The Firmament they called Jupiter the primum mobile of other God?, him they feared: but Jpollo (the 1 Sun, or Mithra as they termed him) they molt affeded, and to whom they dedicated many Temples, attiring him with epithetes of honour, healthy and gentlenefs 5 as yet memorifing his Image in the ftamp and Coat-Armour of their Em- perours. The Moon alfo had adoration amongft them, fuppofing her efpoufed to Apollo j and for her benevolent influences towards produdion, Crefcente Luna frumenta grander femt, PUn. 18. as yet continued: for upon the fir ft view, they give it a Mombarrock. They alfo had Reward and Punifhment- ranked in the Catalogue of their Deitiesf.' Venm had equal reverence: the Earth alfo, Water, Air, and Fire, wanted not the names of Deities, Fire and Water efpecially. Zertooft charged them to keep a con tinualThe Coozel'bafli. tinual Fire, not fed with common Fuel, nor to be kindled with profane Air only fuch as fhould come from the Beams of that glorious Eye of Heaven the Sun, Lightning, Flints or the like. The Water alfo was by no means to be corrupted with dead Carcafles, Dirt, Urine, Rags, or what exprefled fordidity or naftinefs. Images they efteemed but in differently-, ufually actuating their rites in Groves, Mounts and other places. Their Mamages were commonly celebrated in the Spring, fuch time as the Sun makes the vEqmnottium'y the Bridegroom thefirft day junketting on nothing fave Apples and Camels marrow, a diet they thought proper for that dayes Feftival. Polygamy they hked of, the King giving the example, honouring them with moft applaufe who proved Fathers of moft Children. They feldome faw their Infants till paft four years of age from which to twenty, they learned to ride and Ihoot ^ alfo to fare meanly, lodge hard, watch, till the Earth, and be content with ftnall things. In the Inllitution of lib. 3. mention is made of a Souldier that fneezing at a Court of War the whole company bowed and bleifed the Gods *, that fign lerving as a good Omen to the bufinefs they were about: a cuftome continued amongft the Peffians. The Old Men went plain v but the young Mens habit was rich, their arms and legs fettered with voluntary chains of burnifhed Gold or Brafs, whofe fulgor they delighted in from its conformity to the Sun. In War their attire was either Steel or Mailed work curi- oufly linked, and their Breaft-plates fcaled: their Targets were of Ox-hides, large and roundjtheir Cap was Linen multiplicated: Bowes, Swords, and Axes their Arms; all which in excellent good order, and through long practice they managed dextroufly» ParallelParallel to thefe is what Xemyhon fays,. In Cyrm life time their common Arms were -bow and arrows in quivers, ihort crooked fcemiters*batte^axes, light fliields, and two lances apiece.. Their Arrowes greater than now they: arc, lor the bow they drew was not lefs than three cubits. Children from the fifth year., of; their age to the twentieth ufed little other exercife ( faith Herodotus ) than thefe, viz. to ride th,c horfe, ihoot, andip.ak truth.

Neverthelefs, their complements were hearty •, to equals affording embraces', to fuperiours the head and knee ^ which mode is to this hour continued without alteration. Superftitious they are, as may l^e noted from our adverfe fortune as we travelled: for in fome places when we ftood at their mercy to provide us Mules, Camels, or Horfes, how hafty foever we appeared, they cared not to fet us forward except by throwing the Dice fuch a chance happened they thought fortunate: a ceremony deduced from the Ro mans ■, who had thpir albi &amp; atri or fafli &amp; nefafii dies. In mifchances alfo or in iicknefs fome ufe forcery, prefcribing charms, crofs characters, letters, antiques, or the like, ta ken commonly out of the Alcoran. Necromantick ftudies they applaud becaufe profound, and tranfeending vulgar capacities-, fo as many in thofe parts make a living of it: few Siets there but can exorcize. Friday is their Sabbatlu licentioufly kept ^ and may there fore be fuppofed fucj) a Sabbath as Plutarch fpeaks of, which is derived from ZzUiw or Bacchanals *• for, Sabafeos is Bacchus.

In peace they are not alwayes idle, folacing their adive bodies- in fundry forts of warlike exercifes. They dance not, except as taught the -.but love to hunt and chafe the Stag, the Antilope, Gazal, Tyger, Bore, Goat, Hare, Fox, Jackal, Wolf, and the like ; in which paftimes they exprefs fingular courage and dexterity- They alfo know well how to ufe the Bow, Dart, Scemiter, Gun and Javelin : iheir Harque- buz is longer than ours, but thinner they ufe that very well, but deteft the trouble ot Cannon and fuch pieces as require carriage. They have Greyhounds large and not un like the Irifh, of courage to encounter a Lion : have Spaniels alfo, but not fo as their Hawks may challenge. Eyeries they have of Eagles, Lannars, Gofhawks, and504. Thyficians. bies •, but their beft Falcons are out of Ruffia and the Scythic Provinces : they fly com monly at Hares, Jackals, Partridge, Pheaiant, Hern, Pelican, Poot, Eftrich, &amp;c.

They have degrees tranfeending one another' in Title as their skill and femonty merits. So well as I could apprehend, thefe are learned in the Sciences and few but are Philofophers: Neverthelefs, their-Libraries are fmall, their Books ufu' ally Arabic, but choice and ufeful', wherein they agree with that rule in Seneca. Nonre- fert yum mulmjed qiUm bonas habent, commonly fuch as advance their pradic- and Dro feffion ^ andin their proper Art I perceived that they prefer Plants and other vesetiblr.' before Minerals.

By which frequent bathing their skins become very fo.c and fine, and by a continued adlivity and tendernefs of their mufcles are muchTheir JErd,Toe try. more agile and flexible in their body than we in£m^ be, where bathing is not fo much~ ufed. In antique paths of ignorance theychufe rather to tread, than by any new invention to call in queftion the reverend judgment of their Anceftors. Hence it is, that they continue their maimed Calculations, out of a blind conceit that Antiquity commanded them* for they have ufed to Compute their years rather by the Moon, than by the motion of the Sun • affirming, That the Firmament or eighth Heaven finifhes its revolution in two and thirty years: which is falfe; his diurnal motion from Eaft to Weft compleating it felf in four and twenty hours v his other from Weft to Eaft, but one degree in an hundred years • fuch is the violence of the firft mover. Notwithftanding, k is probable they mean the Heaven of Saturn which adjoineth it, (whofe revolution comes near their time) finiihing its jour ney from Weft to Eaft in thirty years. Hence their Lunary account is become fubjed to errour, reckoning from the Autumnal iEquinox twelve Moons, the number of days in a whole year three hundred fifty three: fo that our Solar Computation exceeds theirs twelve days at leaft every year ^ whereby it comes to pafs, that thirty of our years make one and thirty of theirs whence the difference arifes 'twixt us and them in their Hegy- rath, which by protrad will doubtlefs occafion more confufion. Thefe differences in Accompt were obferved of old: For, the Caldean Aftrologers who kept the Regifters of Time, perfwaded Cdifthems (Ariflotleh Nephew, and an Attendant upon Alexander at Babylon) that their Records afcended forty three thoufand years: which Diod. Sicdm lib. 8. i. by reducing to Months, found to reach precifely unto the Creation, and no further. The Egyptians ufed the like accompt ^ for they (as Scion re ported ; pretended Annals of nine thoufand years: which Plutarch by the like computati on found to intend Months or Moons rather than years. But the Iberians who boafted of the Antiquity of their knowledge in Letters, and of having prefidents of fix thoufand years, their year was found to confift of four months; which being likewife calculated was found to fall fhort of the time that Mofes lived. But whereas the Jews ever computed their times by Jubilees, the Chriftians by Indiftions, the Romans by Lufira's, and the Greeks by Olympiads thefe that follow Mahomet have a different Epoche to accompt by; as the C£ra Gelalina from Geladin, zAEra Jez^dgirdina from Je^dgird beiides the Hegyra they kave from Mahomet, which is their Epocha or accompt of Time. Such as pradife manufadures have an inferiour repute to theSouldiers: neverthelefs they live plentifully, and more fecure from the jealous eye of the King than do the great ones, who oft deceive their thoughts that they are happier.

And how lame foever the Verfes are, their graceful fhaki-ng their notes in chanting and quavering (after the French air) giv^s it to the ear harmonious. So that in my opinion it was rigidly faid by a Father, when he called Poefie Vinum D^monum: for (fays the Lord feruiam) Poelie not on ly refrelhes the Soul by chanting things rare and various, but alfo exalts the fpirits with high rapturesand being joined with Mulick fweetly inilnuates it felf, fo as it has been R r efteemedjod 'Painting.

And albeit the Men affed not to dance themfelves, (though anciently dan cing was in requeil with men, as Stories tell us,) neverthelefs, dancing is much efteemed there: forthe Ganymedsand Layefians (wanton Boys and Girls) foot it even to admi ration. Mymallonian dances I may properly call them, feeing the Bells, Brafs Armolets Silver Fetters, Timbrels, Cymbals, and the like fo revive Bacchus : in this kind of dance being fo elaborate, that each limb feems to emulate, yea, to contend which can exprefs the molt motion ^ their hands,eyes,and bums gefticulating leverally and after each other fwimming round, and now and then conforming themfelves to a Doric ftillnefs ^ the Gantf- meds with incanting voices and distorted bodies fympathizing, andpoefie, mirth, and wine railing the fport commonly to admiration.

Mufick is not wanting, for it goes firft, the Father next, and according as they are in bloud the reft, others follow promifcuoully : the Hodgee attending at the entrance into the Mofque, helps him to alight, and hallows him. To work they ftraightway go : one holds his, knee, a fecond difrobes, a third holds his hands, and others by fome trivial conceit ftrive to win his thoughts to extenuate his enfuing torment. The Prieft (having muttered his orifons) dilates the prspuce, in a trice with his Silver SciiTers circumcifes him, and then applies a healing Powder of Salt, Date-ftones and Coton-wool, thettandersby to joy his in itiation into Mahometry throwing down their Mmiera Nat alma falute him by the name of Muffdman. But if the ceremony be at home, they then provide a Banquet: before which, the Boy enters well attended, uncloathed before them all and circumcifed; and in commemoration of fuch a benefit (imitating therein when was wean ed) continue a Feaft for three dayes together: at the end whereof, the Child is led about inftate, bath'dand purg'd, aTurbantofwhiteSilk putupon his Head, and all the way as he returns, faluted with acclamations.

But (praiiedbe God) I have not heard of any European Chriftian, who in this Countrey of late times hath denied his Faith, which is caufe of rejoicing. Their Weddings have not much variety. Firft, obferve that Polygamy is tolerable y for Mahomet to excufe his own infirmity (but borrowing it from the Romans) honours fuch moft as have feveral Wives and beget moft Children: wherein they agree with Sca- Uger, That the pleafure of Generation is a fixth fenfe: but their common excufe is, To fur- nifh the Emperour with Souldiers for defence, Paradife with Saints ', and to refoundthe meritorious praifesof their Mahomet: the DervilTe an order of begging Friar excepted, who from a tranfcendant conceit of their own purity forbear Matrimony, but fuppofe Naturesblackeftvillany no fin, producing Mahomet for theix: prototype, who both by precept and example defended it. I have peradventure tied your chafte ears too long to fo impure a fubjed. Such therefore as dare wed provide a fum of money and buy her good-will, her Parents being no further charged than to bath and purifie her. They chufe their Wives more from report of others than particular acquaintance, the friends of ei ther party commonly recommending and concluding. The day being come, the Bride is veiled with a lawn and bravely mounted, a troop of friends accompany her to Church, in the mid-way fhe is met with an equal number of friends, all together aggrandize the ce remony. Entring the Mofque, the Mulay takes the proteft of their good liking, ihe demands three things (fiich as the Jewilh Women did of old;) bed-right, food, and cloathing; Their Fathers having declared themfelves content, the Prieft circles them with a cord, conjoins their hands, takes a reciprocal oath, and calls Mahomet to wit: Rr 2 nefs.^08 Weddings and nefs. After which, the Caddi enrolls their names, the hour, day, month, and year of Nuptial^ and with an Enge difmifles them. The firft day vapours away in Tabaco Feafts, and other jovialty, Men and Women being fevered: at night, the Bride en ters a Stove, where flie is waftied and perfumed, that her degree may the better appear and her Perfon be the better accepted of. Next night they bathe together, and feven dayes after : during which, the feafting holds in fome meafure, according to the old cuftome of fepem ad Convivimn ; in which time if he difcover her to be no Virgin flie is returned to her Parents with difhonour ^ otherwife kept till Death make the divorce. The Alcoran agreeable to the ancient pradice of thofe Eaftern Countries allows ince* ftuous marriages, pretending that thereby love is better contraded and conferved. In cafe the Man be weary, or thatfhe be barren, he acquaints the Mulay therewith, who' (Jew-like) gives a Bill of Divorce upon his allowing her a Dowry: after which,' if he require her again and fhe agree, they are fecondly married •, yea, five, fix, feven times rejeding and returning, as hate or love ftimulate : by that diforder, love vanifhin? jealouiie budding, rage advancing, clamours roaring; and by which confufion manv times the Fathers neither know their own Children, nor they their Parents.

Their Burials revive fome ceremonies that of old were ufed amongffc the Jem and Gen tiles : at his farewel to the World the next of Kin clofe the Eyes, as did Jofeph in the 46. of Genffis'-, and Telemachm in Ovid, Ille meos oculos cornerimat, illetms. The nobler fort of People had their Sepulchres in the fides of Mountains or Hills about Perfepolis: Howbeit, fome ufed to embalm, the Brains being exhaufted by a Silver Engine, the Belly (fo loon as dilfeded and the Bowels extraded) cleanfed with Wine, farced with Caffia, Myrrhe and other Spices, was then clofed and buried in extraordinary deep Pits or Vaults *, or in places bored in the fides of Mountains. But the poorer fort ufed onely Bitumen, or elfe the juice of Cedars, which refills putrefadion. Howbeit the moft ufual way of burial is this: Firft, they waih the Corps with clean Water, (as we find pradi- fed to Tahitha in AB. 9.) they carry it orderly and with filence to the Grave» then lodge the Carcafs not in the Machits or Churches but Church-yards, and where none lay for merly j fuppofing it a vile part to difturb the dead, whom in the Grave they think fenfi- ble of torment: they place his Head towards Medyna, and (according to the old Cep- tem ad luthm} for feven dayes the next of Kin watch, to keep if poffible the evil An- gel trom his Grave, mceifantly warbling out Elegiac Threnodies, as the lad expreffion or love they can mew.

Upon the Grave they fix two ftones, at his head and feet, which in Arahick^ characters engraved and coloured, note his Name, Quality and time of Burial. There they leave him, but give not over twice every day to fing his Reqniemy befeeching to fuccour him againft his bad Angels: of whom, as part of their Creed, they nourilh this Opinion: So foon as any Mujfulman is buried, forthwith Muengar and Qharequar two ugly Devils at ail him •, the one armed with an iron club, the other with a hook of flaming brafs: in which frightful pofture they view the Carcafs, and in an imperious or rather infolent manner command him to lift up his head, to fall proftrate upon his knees, and beg his Soul, which it is fuppofed was till then departed: The dead Body re-entertains his SouL and together give an account of their palfed Life: Now upon confeffion if it appear that his Life was good, the Devils as Spirits flee away, and give way to two good An gels ( apparell'd in white filk ) to comfort him •, to the day of doom not budging from him, nor feeming unwilling to proted him. But in cafe his Life upon examination or confeflion appear bad, then the black-fac'd Caco-dasmon with the iron club hits him fd pat on the head as thumps him ten yards deep into the ground j where he fleeps not long tor immediately the other fpiteful HeUiound with the flaming hook pulls him' up again • in that horrid fort tormenting him till Mahomet calls a Parliament and gives deliverance! In one place of his Alcoran he promifes to fave them all ^ but in another ( forgetting his promife) appoints them to pafs over a narrow Bridge (he calls it the Bridge of Judge ment ) each Man carrying his fins in a bag behind him ^ but in paffing over, with fuch as have heavy loads the Bridge breaks, and they fall into Hell*, fuch as have lefs weight, into Purgatory, &amp;c. In former times they uled to burn the Bodies, as did the Romans and moft Ethnimes. The Carcafs was folded in linnen called Linum Vivum made of the ftone Asheflos, which was both fpun and woven into linnen; and being put into the fire would not confume, but preferved the aflies from mixture with other things, and fo was committed to the Sepul chre. This precious fort of incombuftible-linnen at the firft was fold at a high rate,but after wards became more common: for fuch time as Sylla befieged Athens, it was obferved that what was anointed with that oyl became free from burning. Pliny alfo reports That he faw Napkins frequently ufed, which when dirty or foul, were cleanfed by Fire and not by Water. A rare kind of walhing!

Thefe were Abuboker?

MA HO ME T (Son of Abdar a Pagan and Emma a Jew) was born at Jathreb (or Jtrarip, Jezrab PoflelluiXalh it) in Arabia, the year from the Creation 4544. and of Chrift our blelfed Lord and Saviour $7^.Juftinian at that time governing the Roman Empire, and Cozjrhoes (Father to Hormifda) the Per fan. His Parents were poor, therefore as an Apprentice with much patience he ferved Zayed-ben-Hartah a rich Merchant*, who dying, left his Servant a confiderable Legacy: but by reafon of thofe broils 'twixt Cozrhoes and the Romans, Traffick decayed, and molt men were compelled to dance after JSellona's Mufick ^ fo as Mahomet amongfl: others en- lifted himfelf and ferved under Heraclim, and after that the P^r/z^r, not caring who w^as vanquifhed, fo he gained. Nor did he erre in his imagination: for by the great Eftate left hini by Ben-Hart ah and acquired in the Wars, he had the credit to command fo many Tartars and Arabians, as at length he adventured to fet up for himfelf', and had the hap firft to beat the Chriftian Forces, and foon after the Perfian, which got him more reputation: infomuch as having acquainted his Army with the difcord at that time hap- ning in the Roman State, (for fo it was that Phocas having flain his Mafter Mauritius the Emperour,and allowed Boniface the Title ofUniverfal Bi{hop,fo much to the diflatisfadi- on of the Chriftians, that agreeable to the Charader Gregory the Great gave John the Conftantinopolitan'Patriarch they called them Antichrift; and not without fome fiiew of reafon, feeing that fixty fix good Bilhop^ of Rome from Linus (feven years after the PaQion) to that Pope, more minded to feed Chrifts flock, than to arrogate to them- lelves Lordlhip over men *, and much lefs an univerfal Supremacy) conceived himfelf that He was ordained from the beginning of the Creation, not only to eclipfe the pride of that Pope, but withall to inftrud the world in a better way than either Mofes did the Jews, or Chrift the Chriftians ^ moft blafphemoufly withal giving out That he was the Comforter promifed (and yet lays he came to give his Law by the Sword and not by Miracle) and to advance the Arabian name and dignity above all other in the Univerfe. The Jews alfo feeing his glorious rife, cryed him up for the Meifiah, till they perceived him to eat Camels fiefh, and then they abhorred him: but the illiterate Savages admire, and (though fome thought meanly of him) moft part hoped he could effed his promi- fes, and accordingly credit his pretended Revelations. ButMahomet x ^oddjuiofs Alcoran. But e re he could fimfh this new^model by him called an Alcoran, or Laws more refem blmgOrdmancesofWar than Inftrudions to conquer Luft,-as onehasnotedi the P^' fan luddenly broke in among them, and in memory of their late hoftility and plunder retaliates them lb to purpofe,that Mahomet (to fave his life) made nf? of his Dromedary leaving the reft of his company to the fury ofthePo-y?^. romeaary, W ' th ^ fad heart Momet haftens back to of old, and then the ftony Arabian Metropolis:) but when he calls to mind his miferable eftate, bv this laft defeat being abndg d bothofmoney and men, yea fuch men whofe impulfe was prepared to propagate his Alcoran, confnmes in the meditation, and by his fretfulnefs and inceflant vexing had at that time like to have made death his Executioner Some fafer way he therefore ruminates. And in the firft place, to his unquiet fpirit and enrich himfelfj layes clofe fiegeto a Woman of great wealth and by fome thought Qupen ofCorafan-, whom after an amorous alfault he won, and of her begot three Sons and three Daughters, namely and T&lt;«W, which three died young, Fatymaand Zaynah (both married to Om-Kakhom and \Vives to oldAhnboker. But his ftomach growing weak, one fort of Meat began to loath him, for Chodam was ftale, and others better fancied him: In his Alcoran he therefore thought fit to allow carnalhberty, the better to excufe himfelf who was fo infatiatelv li bidinous that he is not alharaed to become a prefident, and countenance his incontinencv by a Law. Accordingly, and with folemnity (as &amp;«-£&gt;/&lt;■« a Writer of his belief reports) he efpoufed j1yf ce the beloved Child of his Son-in-La w Ahuhoker. A Child (though hometsWife) Iwellmay call her, for atthat timelhe exceeded notfix years: vetfoonaf- ter fo acceptable to her Husband, that he calls her his beft beloved, didlates a whole Chapter in her commendations •, and for her love to him, and civility to others • for her witty conceits andskill in Story and Languages, flie is made fuperlative, and intituled Mother of the Faithful^and (contraryto a tenet in his Alcoran) defired to be buried in her Grave, as by old Ahnboker his Survivor afterwards was performed. His third Wife WMMmam (or Mamrya which is Mary) of whom he begat Ebrahim-Caffen who at the ace of fix months by the arrow of death was directed the inevitable way. Zay nab (the repu diate of Ben-Hartah) was his fourth and laft Wife, (for of Concubines he had above an hun dred, .but in no Author any of their names recorded.) This was a Lady credulous of Vifi ons, (and magnes mendacii credulity is the magnet of lies •,) for fhe verily believ ed that his Epilepfie was occafionedby an Angels conferring with him, fothat amonslt Mahometans fhe alfo is firnamed a Mother of Muifulmen or true Believers. But that his Dodrine might not want a confirmatiou by Miracles, fome ofthofehis bofome friends and other familiars, taught Doves to feed out of his ear, and Camels to exped their food from him, which blazoned his holinefs: (albeit ever llnce Semiramis her time, whowasfed and educated amongft Doves, in the Oriental parts Doves have a more than common eftimation.) However, by this pradife he not only eluded his fa miliars, but alfo put all Arabia into an expedation of fome extraordinary confequence So as having by the help of Sergm an Italian, a neft of uncleannefs,a Monk, a Sabellian, a ducontented wretch for miffing the Bifhoprick of Byz.anth y and otjohn ot Antmh anun- lound and heretical Neftorian, two fubtil fpirits, (who as Latlmim faith, by mixing truth with falfhood and fowing the feeds of errour difturbed the tranquillity of all thinesO by fuch help, or rather by the help of fuch, he finiihed his Alcoran in the year of our blef- fed Lord God 620. at that time being aged forty fix. Itfo tranfported him, that from Methat to Mecca he goes to have it credited •, but therein his predidion failed him ^ for fo foonas the Arabs perceived his defign (being formerly acquainted with his birth and breeding) they banifli him, and (but for his Wives relations) there had crulhed him and his Cockatrice Egg, which was but then hatching. So that involved with more per plexity now than ever, he was at his wits end, and once refolved to burn his Book and return to trading: but Sergttu whofe Intereft was involved pacified him, telling him, fo great a Work could not but be attended with oppofition. The difanimated Prophet revives upon this, and apprehends this afflidion propitious to his memory : fo that to Jathreb he goes, where for two years he fecludes himfelf from company^ therein imi tating other Law-givers *, as Pythagoras, who concealed himfelf ten years, Zoroafier twen ty, and Socrates for fome certain time: fo Mahomet having finifhed his plot, and com manding the accompt or iEra fince obferved by his Sedaries to commence from his late perfecution, he again adventures, and by gifts and other perfwafions attraded fo many followers that within feven years his Alcoran was received in Mecca : from this root branching put fo many feds as in fhort time infeded all the Orient. Mahomet (whofe name Arabically .fignifies Deceit, and many times Convenmt rebus Tt nomina jiiAlcoran, nominate faisj affording alfo the number 666, the mark of Antichrift,) having ac- compliihed his defrgn, was fummoned to appear before the Lord of all flefh, the God Omnipotent, and Judge of all mens adions at whofe Tribunal (no doubt) he hath re ceived a juft judgment for his impiety. He died in the year of his climaderic fixty three of theHegyra 17. and of our Saviour (fay fome) 637. others 666. ordaining t J fucceedhim, and his carcafs to be intombed in Jyfces grave i^i Jathrip, which per Anto- nomajiam he new-named Medina Talmbi, it or Meccha, from which it is diltant one hundred and feventy miles, being that Mmychiates mentioned in ftolomy \ albeit I rather think it Meccha, becaufe I read that Medina (orjathrip) was built j4mo Domini 364. by jiadhuddadade then King of Babylon: by Ofrian allegorically called El-haramain, and by others De~A'falemy i.e. a holy place or Town of mercy, none daring in the garb of a Souldier tread Eaft, Weft-, North, on South, nigher than fix one way, twelve, eighteen and twenty four miles the other, upon pain of death. His Alcoran or Simna, i. e. the Book of Truth or a Legend for the Fakhful, is fluffed with Philofophy moral and natural, and mixed with fo many fantafies and inventions as renders the whole full of abfurdities and contradidions j and farced with fuch trafh as may powerfully provoke any lober Student to a height of laughter. The Preface is, That the Book was. fent from God by Gabriel to Mortis-Ally, (fo fay the Terfians ; ) but he, miftaking the right man, gave it Mahomet ^ whom when God faw replenifhed with equal vertue, the Angel was not blamed, but the gift confirmed. They report withal, That fo foon as he was born, an Angel brought him three Keys made of three great Ori ent Pearls which he fnatched from the Angel, and thereby got a triplicite Dominion over Law, Vidory, and Prophecy. _ To begin then : The Alcoran or Bible by them called Karram, from Kara which fig- nifies Scripture as Scaliger and Drufm note, and Alefalem, i. e. the Law of Peace, or Alcacan, i. e. Judgment, as it was digefted by Oz.man fifteen years after the death of Mahomet, is a Volume twice fo big as the Pfalms of David ; divided into a hundred and fourteen Azoaraes or Chapters, put by Ozman into a kind of rythme, and writ original ly in Arabic, a Language fo magnified by Mahometans as they believe the Angels in Hea ven Ipeak it: albeit, 'tis well known that till Adahomet's time the Arabian tongue was little different from the Chaldee ; I might objed, That the Hebrew has the preference, it being the opinion of a great Dodor, That in Coelo Hehraa lingua ufuri fimus. NamNa- tura ibi re dibit, qua primitm hanc linguam tenuity confufio enim liftguarum male diftior fnit, &amp;c. This Alcoran then is not fo much a continued Trad of Devotion or diredion to good life, as a Chaos or Mafs of his own ads, having intermixed the Art of War and Peace, Syfcems of Rhetoric, Mathematicks and Ethicks borrowed out of Aflis (as they call ArL ftotle) and other Philofophers, but grofly and confufedly handled. His Mother inftru- ded him in the Jewifh Rites, and Sergim in the Gofpel: whence it is, that in the feventy one Azoara of Nohha, and in the tenth of Junys he records the Hiftory of Noah and Jo nas ; and in other Chapters fpeaks of Enoeh,Abraham,Jofeph,Mofes,EliasjZnd David ^ whole Songs called Zebur-Dahood or the Pfalms of David, and the Teurat Moijfah or Pentateuch of Mofes he extols highly. The Jngil or Golpel of §. Luke he quotes at large in the fourth Azoara of Anne^a, and in the fifth of Almeyda names Ghrift Rooth-noor Alloh and Hazret, t. e. Meffias the Spirit or word and light of God, holy Jefus: not omitting his bodily af cenfion into Heaven in the fight of his twelve Apoftles/eventy Difciples, and five hundred others- Neyerthelefs,does not confefshim tobe the Son of God,but that the Virgin conceiv ed by finelling to a Rofe prefented her by Gabriel •, and that he was born out of her breafts. . Alfo,it was not he that was crucified, but Judas or fome other wicked thief 5 Chrift being withdrawn from them by a cloud from Heaven that covered hinu Thence it is, the Crofs is fo ridiculous amongft them. They lay alfo,That he was the molt holy,challe,and powerful Saint that ever converfed upon Earth. And (in the fecond Azoara of Albacara in the Alco ran) it is declared. That Mofes and Chrifl fhall fave the Jews and Chriftians at the day of Uoom.; yet in the next Chapter ot Amram (forgetting it feems what he had faid) avers, That no foul fhall be faved but by his Aleoran,he being lent into the World to moderate the itndnefs of the Gofpel as Chrift the ieverity of the Law ceremonial; varying alfo from what in the twelfth ^ Affuratto he commands, that they ihould be held in equal repute with the Alcoran; running thus: The holy and merciful God firft fent the ceremonial Law, and tjien the Gofpel to dired all men in the right path, and laftly the Alcoran, a faithful r? v, 5, in ft r udion. Ho man therefore amongft them dares undervalue the old Law and the Gofpel, but pradife it no lels than what is commanded in the Alco ran. trom whence it is, they reverence the holy Sepulchre, vifit Saints Tombs, nonour the memory of our Saviour •, and abhor the Jews. Saint John Baptifi alioalfo he fpeaks modeftly of, and of the blelfed Virgin with lingular reverence-, faying in the nineteenth Azoara to this purpofe, 'Hail 3^7thou art blelfed5 yea, in purity and &lt;£ holinefs exxeliing all other women: the meditation of Gods Laws was ever in thy heart, ' therefore he hath feleded thee, refined thee, and made thee his happieft dwelling •, thou a art full of knowledge and mercy, free from pollution, hatred or ambition; yea, thou* ' the Virgin Mother of the great Prophet Jefm, art only of woman-kind moil lovely 'and perfed in the fight of the Almighty,^ Which I name, hot-that his Book is any way more valuable, (the end cOnfidered* which was his plot for Apoftafie) but that the Devil and Sergitu his Coadjutors could not derogate from their Majefty •, and to whom we may fay in the words of our Saviour to the Demoniack, hold thy peace-, for as ano ther fays. Ex ore tm Lam fordet. Now albeit the Alcoran for its greater repute feigns. That three Angels flying with Ada- homet intoahighMountain, oneriptuphisbreaft andwaihed his Guts with Snow* the fe- cond opened his heart, thereout picking a black kernel that was Satan's part, which the laft Angel clofed up and madeperfed: Then weighing him in a fcale, many men not be ing heavy enough to counterpoize him, the Angel fet him upon the lower earth, faying. No number (hall ^e able to weigh againll him. Now what thefe Angels were, appears by the Book it felf, which confifts of Herefiarchies againft our blefled Saviour : for, with Ar- rim it denies the Divinity *, with Sahellicus the Trinity, with Macedonia the Holy Gholl: proceeding i with Mankhem the death of Chrift *, and fuch like Errours as thofe wretches broached. In the 32. Azoara, he politickly commands That no man be fo impious to queftion any particle of his Law&gt; nor to difpute about it; yet in another Chapter coiv felles that 'tis ftuft with Untruths. Their Commandments are eight. 1. Commandment. There is one-&gt; and hut one great Cody and Mahomet is his Prophet* TheMuyezinsandTalifmanni every fourth hour fing aloud from the fteeple tops of eve ry Molque, or Alcoranes as fome allufiveiy call them, Quia e cacumine Turrmm fragment a jilcoranni pueri plernmq\ voctferant. The ufual words are Llalay-lala, Mohummed refiillula 5 but the Perfians ( by Syet Gmets direction) to the honour of their Prophet LlaU y-lala Mortys-Ally vel hilkla *, iterated as a word of praife borrowed from the Hebrew Hallelu- ja, or as by the old Per fans ufed in their Paean or warlike Songs, which commonly began with Alala, as Xenophon c. 2. obferveth^ or HtlluU Vrania and Elnlem a Song to Bacchus. The acknowledging one only God they borrow either from the Decalogue or fourth of Ezeklel. Upon which alfo our ancient Bards and Druides beat, in thofe dark times ma king it an Article of their Faith. 2. Command. 'Tis neither good nar jnft that any Muffdman live unmarried-) lefl the Profef fors of the Alcoran be diminished. Polygamy is from this Commandment tolerated ^ yea, fuch are thought moll honoura ble who fuper-abound in Wives and Concubines *. Mahomet in the Azoara o^Bacara boafts of his fingularity therein; and that he had ftrength at molt times to fatiate forty Wo men. In that Chapter of Attahrim he confefles that he had violated his faith and troth *, but, that he had received pardon from God and had to witnefs it, Rachel and Gabriel two Angels. .. . But who fees not, that in this precept he had refped to the natural dilpolltion of the Arabians ? better pleafed with freedom and voluptuoufnefs than vertue: not caring how, fo by any Magic he could yoke them under obedience. 3 . Command. It behoves Mnffulmen to be charitable *, and to hate contention. Travellers find fpecial advantage by this Commandment: for whereas Inns are not to be had in Heathen Countries, there are Buildings of purpofe for the accommodation of Travellers always open for entertainment, and clean kept •, and near them is a large and convenient Stable, In one of thefe Inns, fifteen thoufand pound fterling hath been dif- burfed upon a charitable account: yea, fo remarkable is their charity, that they not on ly ered Hoipitals for lame men and difeafed, but fometimes for aged, ftarved, or hurt birds, beafts, and fuch Creatures. 4. Command. It behoves Mntfulmen to invocate their Prophet every day five times at leaf} ^ and to attend his coming patiently. . , T t 2-2 2 7j. They accomplifh this with fuch regard as when the Mnyetin is heard to cry aloud from the fteeple of the Mofque they fall to prayer, though bulled in prophane talk, drink- ing, drabbing.or the like. Before they enter the Mofyue they waih their feet, lay afide their Ihooes, and being affembled turn their faces all one way *, and in their prayers fliut their eyes, fometimes their ears, drop their beads, and with a fubmifs voice or murmur ingeminate their devotion, bending, proftrating, and kilfing the ground or fome Re- lique of confecrated earth brought from the Haram or the Alcaba two Chappels in ereded (fayes the Alcpran) by Abraham from the Idea or pattern of that which Mam built in that little time he ftay'd in Paradife, holding neverthelefs that he ftay'd there not above one day, and that it was tranflated by Angels into Heaven at the Deluge. i n every Bl-fata or prayer they faeda or kifs the Earth at every epithete or name of GW and Mahomet *, and after they have battologized Llay-lala, or Hilnla, /.f.Praifesj they iterate another to this effedt In the name of the good and holy God.

Now though this be moft ufual, yet are they not without other fet forms of prayer, compiledby Of man in his Parody-, and more largely by that famous Almotannabhy, who in his high-flown conceits endeavoured to exalt his Name and reputation above that of Mahomet. Their Elfatae's are either for the fafety of their Kings, a happy iffue, welfare of their Countrey, Thanks that they are Mujfulmen, Bofarmen, true Believers or the like: five times in four and twenty hours exercifing prayer. The hours obferved canonically are about day-break, noon, three in the after-noon, fun-fet, and mid-night: called by them AJhara, Magreb, Adeleper, Kalamath and j Arabically Dahour, Lajhour, Mo- grub, Sallie and Sabaha Vhair. The firft hour is ajfced by four Teffajems and two prayers* the fecond by ten times kilfingthe earth with five Elfatae's, the third hour requires eight grovelings and four ejaculations the fourth hath five paedaes and three orations; and the laft hour hath fifteen Teffalems and eight repetitions: after that hour to day-break 'tis held unnecefTary to invocate. Howbeit the Per fan fince their reformation think it enough to pray thrice in four and twenty hours', at Sob, Dor and Magareb, Arabickyvoids which fignifie morning, noon and night.

For, firft, they frame a deformed Image, whofeface is black, his nofe pierced thorow W^h a Dart, and clad in Straw: which done, they hurry it through the ftreets in a hurly- burly of thoufands of credulous people-, who when they have dragged it lufficiently through the City, draw it to fome riling Hill where to all mens view they elevate this Cai- A,, '' u f j awls 0ut a Poetic Oration to this purpofe.

A In token of joy, they unanimoufly fing their Efmicid, and cry aloud Youah Ally, yea, itnve to rend the Clouds with clamours. At a fet time they ceafe, when Fire is given toa tram of Gunpowder which fetting divers fquibs on fire,blow up the detefted Syrian^ and by a hideous noife make the Air echo at his Funeral. Hnjfan^ Ghoit they think now fleeps quietly ftichPerfim commends one anothers zeal, and fpends that night in merriment. b The Jedt-Ouf mt was obferved when we were in Spaharvn. They have a Tradition that vKf- ( M y sSon ). was loft in a Wildernefs, where thirft or rather Mavl the Kalyph Killed him. Nine dayes they wander up and down, all that while (having neither head nor beard nor feeming joyful, but inceflantly beating their breafts, fome tear their garments, and crying out Hnffav, Huffan^ in a melancholy note, fo long, fo fiercely, that many can neither— : — V- Fejlivah. neither howl longer, nor for a months fpace recover their voices. The Dervis and other Santoons or Enthufiafticks being in the croud exprefs their zeal by turning rounds fo long together, and with fuch fwiftnefs as will hardly be credited, which by cuftome is made inoffenfive: and others I have leen in this vertiginous exercife at the Cavalcades when Ambafladors were met upon the way, a circumgyration we beheld with admirati on. The tenth day they find an imaginary Hnjfan, the Mahometan Tetragrammaton, that Nirnqnamq^ fat is qmptus Adonis-, whom they echo forth in Stentorian clamours, till they bring him to his Grave ^ where they let him fleep quietly till the next years zeal fetch him out (Semper enim yerdmt femper &amp; inveniunt) and force him again to accompany their devotion. Parallel to which is that in Ovid, 10. Metamorph. Ludus monnmenta manebunt Our forrom Monument Jhatl ever lafi : Semper Adoni mei, repetitaq*, mortis Imago Adonis ! thy Deaths Image every year Annua plangoris peraget fimularaina noftri.

And may be in imitation of that annual cuffcome which was obferved by the Egypti ans, howling in like manner for their lofb Ofyris, as the idolatrous Jews did for Tarn- whz . mentioned by the Prophet Ezekiel chap. 8. &amp; 14. and fir ft celebrated by the Phoenicians. The Nowronz. is in imitation of our New-years-day •, but they begin (after the old man ner) in March, fuch time as the Sun in his equal fliine to either Pole makes the /Equinodi- um. A Feftival of jovialty this is for one prayer, preying upon variety of pleafures the Talifmanni pipe now to Bacchus, Ceres, and Venm. 1 have obferved, that in many parts for eleven months in the year we could fee very few Women of any extraordinary- quality, 'and thole we faw wdre veiled being offenfive in the ftreets, or gardens to con- verfe with any; yet thefe twelve dayes of the Nomouz, they have liberty ^ fo as all places were full of them, yea, their naked faces difcovered ; frisking in amorous poftures, and drawing the eye by a forced magic. Gifts alfo and reciprocal prefents are retorted up and down from one to another, with Garments of filk and gold, hodes&gt; fruits, and pilcaihes of other Ibrts: nothing but riding the horfe, drinking, cock-fighting, fortune- telling, finging, fwinging in the air, courting, and the like being obferved to the lalt minute of that Feftival. The Imamy has fome dependance on the JBuckaree : This takes its rife from a Camel, that from a Ram ^ that for JfmaeJ, this for Mahomet. In November, the Meccan Proto- mift fends a Camel by an adopted Son (fometime natural) who is welcomed to Spahawn by many thoufand Muifulmen, who fhew the extreme of joy for fo holy a Prelent. After they have tried and tired their voices, the Hodgee from an exalted place acquaints them with the caufe of his long journey, perfwades them to a thankful remembrance, and bleffes them. The multitude, without any reiped of men or danger, throng about the Beaft ^ who is no fooner in the field where Death arrefts him, but that they fall upon him, and pluck off his fliort hairs with an admirable dexterity, keeping them as fandimonious re- liques, prevalent againft fudden death, (though many dye in the affault, and thoufands return maimed) hunger, thirft, poverty, and what not ? After which, the tormented Camel is by the Hodgee again figned for facrifice. The Darraguod firft transfixes his Javelin. The Vifier beheads him, and gives it the King. The carcafs then is torn piece meal by the fool-hardy multitude 5 fo greedy to obtain this charm of long lUg and plen ty, that immortality and the place where meat and drink is needlefs, oft in the eflay en tertains them. The Caddyer Ally is a Feaft in memory of Ally's vidory over, the three old Caitiffs of Mjeccha, by Death (not. Ally) conquered: After fome threnodies many prayers are mut tered, fongs chanted, and Alms bellowed : the King is at moft charge in thisfolemnity, thegreateft honour refleding on him, in regard of his anceftry. The Amptpatfion ( or Ovodt-haptfton ) is in memory of Mahomeis baptifm by Sergim, Many of the ordinary fort of Mahometans alfemble, and (after the Darraguod has put a period to his Oration) promifcuouily befprinkle with water one anothers faces, then foil their ilefh with dirt and filth, and the great ones many times to pleafe the King ad the like among them*, laftly, they cleanfe themfelves with water, fuppoiing all deformi ty waftied off, and their bodies cleanlier ever after. The Sophian is a Solemnity of fafting, feafting, and praying for the profperity of • their King, and continuation of the Sophian pedigree. The Feait of Rofes and Daffad'illies is begun by a Proceifion of Santoons at the firft bud ding of thofe Flowers, and for thirty dayes celebrated witlt all mauner of fports and re creations 7,16creations to be imagined. This annual Feaft feems to be continued from the cuftom of thofe memorable ones which in old times were celebrated in Perfia, fuch time as the Kings thereof had the Supreme Monarchy of the World *, as we read in the Book ofHefter and elfewhere: for, at the keeping of this Feaft we beheld an infinite number of Tents pit ched, with fuch a flux of Men, Women, Boyes and Girls; with Arms, Mufick, Songs, and Dances, as would make one think that either the Games of Olym^m were revived) or Bacchus his Orgyes. 6.

And in the 72 Azoara, That Elgehenny or the infernal Ghofts fhall after I know not how many Years be freed. How far Sergim in this made ufe of Origen, I know not. The 85 Awara treats of the Zodiac^ the 91, 92, 93, of the Moon, Night, Morn^ the 113, of the Firmament-, but is Philofophy of fuch courfenefs, that I may well fay Difcptm potius qmm Philofophum.- for how can it well be otherwife, fince in his feventeenth Azoara he confefles he could nei ther read nor write, but hath this/^/w, that all his learning was fupernatural? In one Chapter he is bold to fay. That Solomon was a great Magician, and that he learned it from Marat and Am two bad Angels: With more reafon we may fay, That Mahomet was skilled in that infernal wifdom, if half of thofe miracles be true he records of himfelf: One is this: Being one time compalfed with a great aflembly of Arabians he pointed at the Moon, (he oft courted) with his thumb and long finger; it feems it knew his mind ^ for the Moon in obeifance immediately clove afunder, and in two pieces fell upon the Hill of Mecca upoii which Mahomet at that time ftood with a piece of his linley-wolfey coat he patched and made it whole again *, which after it had alfo (lay the Per fans) embraced Mortis-Ally in way of complement, it re-afcended, and from that day became the Badge or Coat-armour of Bofarmen. In another. He allures his profelytes, That Mecca, Me dina and Jemfalem be holy Cities, built by Adam in Paradife,' but framed in Heaven: and thence it is that Jerttfalem is honoured by Turks as well as Chriflians. Four Cities fprung out of Hell at the Birth of Mahomet (at which time all Idols fell, Lucifer was thrown into Hell, fo deep into that abyfs, as he was fome years e're he could get up&gt; again*,) the names of thole Towns are (aspleafes Mahomet to fay') time din in Caldea, Antioch in Syria, V4flat in cdZgypt, and Eh-beram in Armenia: places that have this black vizard put upon them, probably for that they reiifted the progrels of his Alcoran* In the 47 Awara, he records his pilgrimage or afcent into Heaven; where he had a rare objed, and thence brought a defeription of the feveral Spheres, Heavens, Hells, and Paradife: as alfo of Angels and Saints ? Judgement, the Reiurredion, joy and pain, &amp;c. of which I Ihall afford you a compendium out of their ov^n Authors. One eve ( as Ma homet was fporting privately in his Chamber at Mecca with Ayfce his young Wife) Gabriel (Seraphiel the Per fans call him, the fame fay they that foftered Mahomet and Ally three years, fuch a Genius peradventure as haunted Brum j in a flafh of fire entring their Cham ber, thus^fainted Mahomet: Hail thou, beloved Man 1 I come to fetch thee*, the God whom thou fo zealoufly woxftiippeft delires to fee thee at his own habitation. Mahomet going to mount upon the Angel's wings ( of which he had feventy pair) being hindred, demands what ,way he fhould take to afcend ? Thereupon the Angel Ihews him an Afs, Albarack by name, and bids him mount. Mahomet elfaying to get up, could not, till he had pray'd for him. From Meccate polled as fwift as thought, for Albarac^t four fteps broughtHeaven defcribed. brought him to Jerufalem: there difmounting the Angei took 4 him into his proteftion. In few minutes Mahomet paft the feven Seas, and afcended Heaven, into which he was let by Gabriel the Porter, who keeps feventy thoufand Keys that open feveral divilions of Paradife. From one Heaven to another ( according to his computation ): it is fi ve hundred years .travel •, howbert, Mahomet paft through the feven in a moment. In thofe Orbs he faw many ftrange things; but firlt take notice what mettle the Orbs are of. Et r if urn te neat is ' The firft is of refined filver, wherein all the glittering Stars are fixed with chains of burniflied brafs: In this Heaven he faw a Cock fo great, that ftanding upon the Moon his comb reached into the Imperial Heaven: every time this Cockcrow'd, all other Chan ticleers upon the Earth re-echoed him. The fecond Heaven is of gold, fuch as has been feven times tried in the fire. The third of Pearl: In this Heaven he fa^v innumerable troops of Saints and Angels, each of which faluting him by his Name, he pray'd fo them. Amongft the reft, he took notice of Adam,Emch,Abraham, Samuel, David Solomon &amp;c. all whom he knew by revelation •, and of which, fome he taxed, others he commended' as occafion ferved. The fourth was of Smaragd ^ where he faw -infinite companies of other Angels, who made a mighty noife and inceffantly praifed God: every Angel there was a thoufand times bigger than the globe of the Earth; each had ten thoufand heads • everv head threefcore and ten thoufand tongues ^ and every tongue praifed G od in feven hundred tho fand Languages. Amongft them, he noted one efpecially, or the Angel of Mercv- a Creature of that vaft frame, that every ftep he trod was twelve times more tha the diftance is 'twixt both the Poles: Mahomet enquired of him why he went icr the Angel reply'd. It was in compaffion to fee the deplorable ftate of Man This is that Angel has the holy Pen in keeping; a Pen of Orient Pearl foJong,thatan^^ Courfer in five hundred years galloping can hardly reach to the further end of it With this Pen, God regifters all things paft, prefent, and to come: the Ink he writes with £ pure Light *, the Charader fo myfterious, that none but he and Seraphael can read V All the hundred and four Holy Books are .written by this Quill, ^ thofe ten which Mam received, 5#«had fifty, Edris ( or Enoch) thirty, and Abraham had the reft • Tf alfo writ Mafes his Law, David's Pfalms, Chrifs Gofpel, and Mahcmet's Alcoran. The fifth Heaven was of Diamonds-, where he faw a mighty Angel, of all other the wifeft • he had as many heads and tongues and voices as any two in the inferiour Orb • and hnri the keeping of that Book wherein all Men in the World have their Names written • he did nothing but turn over leaves, and blot out one Name or another*, for by that rash* the arrow of death) they die fuddenly. The fixth was of Turquoife: The feventh of A/a. hal , fome interpret it Fire \ others pure Light or Breath congealed. All thefe circum- volve one another like Pearls or Onions: they be tranflucent, and yet of metals \ Above all is the Heaven of Heavens, full of Light and filence •, immenfe, and within which all other Bodies are compnfed, but it incomprehended. There Mahomet faw or rather dreamt he faw the higheft Throne, rich beyond expreffion ; very great alfo; for it was fupported by feven Angels, each of them being fo great, that a Falcon if he were to flv a thoufand years could not go fo far as is the diftance of one eye from another About the Throne hung 14 Candles everlaftingly burning: the length of every one of thofe Candles fas Mahomet conjedured) was from one end to another as much fpace as a Horfe can ride in five hundred years. There this blafphemer fears not to fay he faw the Almighty who Cif it be lawful to mention) in fign of welcome, laid his hand upon Mahdmef'sface • his hands (fayes this Anthropomorphite) were a thoufand times colder than Ice. For all Which, Mahomet in acknowledgment of his own bafenefs blufht for fhame, and fweat for fear ; and with his long finger fweeping the fweat from his brow, threw it into Para- aife: Rare Sweat! for each drop ( he notes them to be fix ) turned into fome rare thing: one drop became a Rofe^ another turned into a grain of Rice; the other four into n aine ^ ^chmet-Sembelimy Ahuhamefa Mdec-ned, and Seh-Baffin.

HeTaradife* fuddenly fuch time as all the Worid is wrapt in a carelefs fecurity: the Angels know not the time till Mahomet point it out by a great and fearful duel 'twixt Mrieland Death .whom in the end he vanquiflies ; thereby becoming fo enraged,that in this manner he deftroys all living Creatures in the World: new arming himfelf with flaming brafs, in each quarter of the World he founds his dreadful Trumpet, whofe affrighting clangor makes not only Men 5 Beafts, Fifties, Birds and other Creatures die, but the Angels alfo give over living: laftiy, Mrtel himfelf whom God commanded to follow the reft in the inevitable path, by wrap- ing his iron wings about ftrangles himfelf, with fuch a dreadful noife as is unexpreffible. After this enfues an univerfal Earth-quake, attended by a ihowr of purling brimftone which devours allgrafs, trees and vegetable Creatures; yea, the Palaces of the proudeft. Tyrants.: and turning topfie-turvie the Earth, Water, and other Elements reduces them into their original, a confufed lump. Forty dayes it refts in this new Chaos: during which God graips it in his lift, and (beholding it) fpeaks to this effed: Where are mw the han -hty Princes y cruel Tyrants, lafciviom wantons-, and greedy Earth-worms ? Which faid, for forty dayes and nights fpace he inceffimtly rains down a fhowr of mercy, and by a gracious and gentle breath reduces the World into a frefli and glorious eftate. Which done, he calls up Seraphiel, and bids him take his Trutopet in his hand: the Trumpet is of gold, and (fpeaking to common Underftanding ) above five hundred years travel from one end to another. At the firft found, enfues a re-vivification of Angels and Men: at the fecond. Angels re-affume their glorious Robes, and Men their naked flelh again. Mi chael the Arch-angel ( perceiving the Tribunal raifed upon a high Mount in Jehofaphath Vale) approaches with his Ballance, and poifes every Man's deeds in either fcaie: Such whofe good out-ballance their evil are put upon the right hand, the other on the left. After that, fuch as are loaden with their fin's ( packt up in a fatchel and hung about their necks) pafs upon a narrow and weak Bridge towards Hell: fuch as have few fins, get over fefely ^ but thofe that be heavy laden break the Bridge, and fall into an abyfs. Upon the other fide ftands Mahomet transformed into a Ram, and in his deep fleece lodges his Sedaries,whom after long travel he brings to fome gap which he finds in Paradife •, where skipping in, he dif-burthens himfelf and {hakes them out: at that inftant alfuming new forms, more lovely, more ftrong, and every way more excellent ^ with eyes as big as the Earth, with eye-brows bigger and more beautiful than the Rain-bow. The Alcoran further tells you what and where Hell is, and what is Paradife. Hell is the Umbilick of the World} circled with a thick wall of*Adamant^ entred by feven gates of flaming brafs divided into many cells, lome of which are more loathfom and fuller of torment than others. In it are divers holes or Caves*, fome fo deep, that in a thoufand years a mil-ftone cannot find the bottom, in the defcent are fharp Swords and Pikes placed purpofely to torture Souls in their fallings: Some places be abyfs, full of oyl and brimftone ever-flaming 5 and fo terrible, that the Devils forbear not to howl and fcriech, and rage there without meafure. Other Prifons there be that are full of Toads, Serpents, and all other forts of noifom creatures imaginable: The damned eat nothing there 'lave the forbidden Fruit; which being in their guts, inflames like ful- phur, and makes them roar continually. Some Rivers be full of Crocodiles •, others fo cold as make^ them gnafh and chatter. Howbeit, Thele pains of Hell muft not abide for ever, fay their Dodors *, for after each Soul hath fuffered fo many thoufand years as the fins amount unto they have committed, Mahomet will deliver them (and the Devils alfo •,) firft changing their affrighting (hapes into fliapes more tolerable, and then bring ing themto Alcanzjir, a Stream flowing out of Paradife ^ there they are to cool their heat,' and wafli away their black-fcorched mummy, and then they vary into a moift flefh whiter than the driven fnow, and thence-forth fing Lala-hilldaes, which is, Praife he to God and Mahomet, Paradife is a place of as much delight as Mahomet''s carnal apprehenfion was able to imagine or his fancy contrive. Uncertain of the local place, he fuppofes it will be upon the Earth after the day of Doom, when all deformity fhall be removed: for till then, the Souls and Bodies of Men (though they fleep in their Graves) be fenfible of joy and torment. Paradife (layes the is fo many miles about as there be motes or atoms in the Sun: it is inclofed with a wall of gold ninety times refined, ten thoufand miles high, and in thicknefs about three thoufand ; has feven gates to enter at, (feven is a myftery v) of Carbuncle or pureft Rubie is the firft gate-, the other fix be of Pearl, Emerald ,Turqu6ife,' Hyacinth, Smaragd, and Amethyft •, reflefting upon the Spheres: Divided into 7 ipa- cious Gardens, fub-divided into feventy times feven places of delight-, each filled with Inhabitants, Mufick, Wine, and all fenfual pleafures imaginable: all have cool refreftiing Rivolets of Cryilal,drilling over pibbles of Amber. Summer-houfes it alfo has lhaded with 13 u freeso %eligious trees ever-fruitful and verdant: In center of that Elyiium is a Tree higher than all the Mountains of the World were they heaped one upon another •, fo broad, that Paradife becomes delightfully fhaded by' it. The trunk of this Tree is of Diamond, the leaves of Gold, and the boughs of Jet; each leaf is wrought into an antique lhapc •, in this moll; admirable, for that on one fide in letters of light are the Name of God, on the rever^ the Name of Mahomet. From feveral quarters 4 Streams gufti out of pureft Water,Milk, Coho and Honey *, thefe empty themfelves into Mchanzar^ whence this mixture of Ne penthe flows into other parts of Paradife. Aromatic flowers are there in abundance, fuch as ravifh both eye and fmell: Aieiry Chorifters, the meaneft of which as fer excel our Nightingales as they do Ravens. The air is a compound of fenfe-ravifhing odours. Maho metans there(for Chrifliansjem^ov Gentiles have not fuch glory)are ever young and fpright- full, a hundred times bigger and more frolick than ever was Mahomet. The Women are fe vered from the Men ; not that they are kept from them (for Gabriel is never abfent or averfe to let them in) but that by fuch a fcreen they may become more ardently amorous and afFeded to their Damozella's, who have fuch vifages as fair Ayfcehzd (Mahomet's belt beloved O their hairs being threads of gold, their eyes Diamonds as big as the Moon: their lips refemble Cherries, their teeth Pearrl, their tongues Rubies, their cheeks Corral, their nofes Jafper, their fore-heads Saphire: round-fae'd, courteous and merciful. In this Paradife is (fay they) a Table of Diamond, feven hundred thoufand dayes journey long*, about which are Chairs of gold and Pearl, for ufe and ornament. The Males are to be of Mahomet's favour and complexion fuch as their Prophet had when Gabriel mounted him towards Heaven: none but will be much brighter than the Sun, with fuch eyes, eye-brows and ears as are fcarce credible. To conclude, Gabriel the Porter of Paradife has feventy thoufand Keyes which pertain to his Office, every Key being feven thoufand miles long •, by which you may imagine the Doors are no Pygmie ones. In a word, 'tis no lefs ingenious than the reft that Mahomet confefled he writ three parts of four. Untruths in this his Legend or Romance rather: To confute them would then be a labour needlefs, though Melanfthon hath done it *, fo that I may well fay as Se~ neca did to Lucilim, Non njaco fltifquam ad tant as inertias.

Now fince this blafphemous Anthropomorphite perfwadeshisSedariesThatathis Afcent into Heaven the Almighty touched him with his hand, it feems he was ignorant That God is infinite as well as Eternal, and without any compofition: fo as that Tenet of his is an Errour againft the very ElFence of God. Maledittus eft ( fayes Auguftin) qui Deitatem ad Homlnis line amenta refert. Deus enim non eft humana forma particeps, neq, corpus humanum Divina. Yea, Trifmegiftm could fay, Anima eft imago Mentis, Mens imago Dei, Deus enim menti praeft, mens anima, corpori anima: The Soul is the image of the Underftanding, Un- derftanding is the image of God; God rules over the Underftanding, Underftanding. over the Soul, as the Soul doth over the Body. Their Rules are various. The Mufti is chief in hearing and deciding cafes of errour: which if he fail in, the Meccan Protomift determines. The Caddi- Cadalejhi and Muftaedeni are next m Ecclefiaftick Dignity. The Hodgei, Emeri and Mulai the firft are Exp oil- tors, the'other Mendicants, eating their bread in idlenels. The Fylalli converfe moft. The Deruiffi are wandring Wolves in Sheeps-cloathing: '(Deruftei Oratores Petifici are men tioned by Herodom lib, 9.)

So as I lhall conclude with that of Saint Hierome-, Sinon placet mn legos, &amp;c. and take leave with another to fay, Quid ul tra die am in re tarn ex ulcer at a ubi a capite ad pedem non efi fanitas. This ( more crafty than learned) Law-giver, perceiving his Divinity and Philofophy infufficient to abide the trial, has this Salvo, by commanding, That none upon pain of damnation prefume to queftion a fyliable of it. And with good reafon ^ for, Sujpetta efi Lex (fayes Tertulhan) qua fe probari non audet. From whence,few except they be Eccleli- afticks, trouble themfelves to read or ftudy h;; hoping by a reverend ignorance, and the Colliers faith, to be faved. But by your favour I will anfwer you out of Martial. Decipies alios verbis, vultuqj benigno j Sedmihi tarn notus, Diflimulator eris. Others with words and pleafing looks thou may''ft deceive *, but me Thou jhaltnot, for I know thee a rank^Hypocrite to be. Howbeit, the Terfans (fince Gmefs reformation) have contracted the Alcoran into a lelfer Volume. Onmans labours they Height: the fouf great Dodors who had their ori ginal from the fweat of Mahomet*$ brow, Gunet alfo execrates. Thefe are the moft ma terial difference 'twixt Turk and Ferpan. And yet let none think that Syets was the firft fchifm: for Onman was no fooner dead, but according to the Adage Pofthumi Harefii filii, Ihnul to infeeble Ozmans labours commented upon the Alcoran, and differed from his opinion. After him, Jbnu-Abel-hafen of Balfora, An. Heg. 88. by his auftere life and elo quence not only oppofed the Melchian, but in comparifon of whom Ibnul himfelf was counted erroneous. At his death they Sainted him: but trufting to Tradition (for they could never prevail with Haften to commit any thing to-writing) his difciples differed fo far amongft themfelves, that it came to blows,. which jvas but courfe Logic, not agreeing in any point, Vno tertio, till Elharu-Ibnu-ef id of Babylon did his belt in an elaborate Para- phrafe not only to reconcile but withal to make Canonical Elhefins expofitions. It feem- ed calm weather a while: but e're long a thunderclap was heard from Mecca's Territo ries anathematizing Elharu-Efed, perfecuting him and all his fautors. Purfuant to which, by Melee-jha's command they not only burn his papers, but excommunicate him from the converfe and fociety of Muffulmen. Neverthelefs, King Cazel afterwards was induced to have a good opinion of Elffaru and his Tenets: and at that time being a Favourite to his Unkle the great Melec-jha (a Turk and late Vidor over Babylon) makes ufe of his power, defiring fome favour for the late excommunicated men. Melee could not eafily be perfwaded : but Nydam Emul ano ther Courtier of note and favourer of Elharu's Dodrine, fecondsCazel, and prevails to have the Anefian Sedaries called home again. Elgaz.-z.Hli a nimble-witted man under takes it, and by little lels than miracle doles the late made breach : fo as now Mahomet ftiines without interpofition •, but an alteration quickly followed. For Saint Azmulli from the Cafpian fliore defies all fuchas thought well of Mahomet's three intruding Succeffors. This feemed a terrible Apoftafie at firft: but while all Afia were in admiration what the event would be, a crack of no lefs amazement comes from the Weft, where Almotamab- hi exalts his own piety and learning above Mahomet's. This feemed intolerable ^ fo that being apprehended, as a reward of his Apoftafie and to prevent further Schifm that up- ftart Dodor was put to a miferable death. After this, both the Clergy and Laity grew exceeding voluptuous: afoolifh thing it was then to affed learning, or to appear honeft. Lafcivious Poems was the only Vu 2 , opinion, ill i I tfi-ir : 4 'ii 1|; 5 v# l! i' I'hi 1 III 111 ill! iilil - illL mT&gt;abul. opinion, and Mahomet's Paradife feemed then in being. This corruption in good man ners was neverthelefs inveighed againfl: by EJfehraver Differaverd a Badtrian ♦, whofe fe- vere Satyres fo ftung thofe ranting Epicures that many began to examine their lives and converfation *, of which being convinced, made them afhamed ^ and being perceived by Jbml-Pharyd, one well learned in his time, he (as one well acquanted with the humour of the Per ft an) fweetned all by his amorous Poefie: which, was feconded by Elfargmy, whofe Lines were applauded by fome, but by otherfome exploded as a bufie Cabaliit A Chaos feemed then to cover that face of Perfiay till Eli farm a fober Hiftorian took upon himtofet right what was amifs: Seventy two Seds he reduced to two, the Lejhari and Imam : the firft of which Eulogically extols Mahomet^ and is received through all More a, Natolia^^gyyty Palefiinej and Syria, the other Jliy, which is received all over the Perfian Monarchy, and beyond In dm. In the laft place, Syet Gmet difplays his En- lign, to fuch efFed as keeps its credit to this day in oppofition to the Turk^ It would here be tedious to rehearfe their brawls, wherein! have gone, I fear, too far already: I will therefore Ihut up with that of the Paftoral, Non nofinm inter nos t ant as commoner e lites* \ Fter this repofe let's abroad again, and fee what obfervation we can make in other jl \ parts of India: than which^ the World, for pleafure and wealth, has none more con- fiderable.

Dahul (Dunga of old) excepted, which yielded to the mercy of Andradim Governour of Chonly from whom 'twas foon rapt by the Decanees *, but by that made a Bafis of grea ter mifery. For, Fr. Almeyda a few ygars after recovered it by ftratagem, and after great flaughter of the Inhabitants and rich fpoil, burnt the City and demolifht the Fort, lurren- dred by Sha-heg, who but a little before was put into that command by Melec-Jlja then Prince of thofe Countries: Howbeit, by command of the Goan Vice-roy 'twas again re paired, andftoodin good condition till Captain(if I ipiflake not his name) about the year 1620. took the Town, and made the daring Portugal know their bravadoes to the Englijh were not terrible.

The Road gives reafonable good Anchorage,# and the Town it felf (efpecially towards the Sea) ap pears beautiful to fuch as view it: albeit the Houfes be but low, and tarrafled at the top; a mode that belt ferves to qualifie the extremes of heat and cold. An old Caftle and a few Temples at this day are all fhe boafts of-, for the Buzzar is but ordinary, and the Streets narrow: nor is her Mart now fb confiderable as at firft, feeing that Surat and Camhaya to the North, Goa and Calicut to the South have eclipfed her •, fo as now fhe con^ doles with other her difconfolate Neighbours, and is to acknowledge there is a deftiny ana decay in Towns as well as other temporaries. CHOUL (in Ptolomyh dayes called Comane, if Caflaldm guefs right) is removed from the /Equinodial 18 degrees 30 minutes North : ravifhed from the Diadem of Dec an by in the year of our redemption 1507. and in which (to perpetuate his Conqueft) heereded a Fort which he fortified with Cannon. Howbeit, Anno Dom. 1573. it was for fome months befieged by Mifamoluc the Decan Prince with a numerous Army of Horfe and Foot, befides Elephants: but by the gallant defence made by the Portugal were forced to rife with lofs and fhame. The Inhabitants are a mixture of Portugals and Bannyans : it affords little elfe worth noting. Here the Expedition bearing up to fpeak with us, both fell foul one anothers houlfes# through which mifchance her boltfprit gave our mizen fhrouds a churlifh falute*, but by a happv gale were parted without further damage. After five dayes fail we were again Nadyr to the Sun, his declination being fifteen degrees North : we were then clofe by the Ifle in which Goa is fcituated. E're long we were becalmed, whereby the air fuddenly became inflamed, fo as we were forced to fweat and live like Salamanders. During which, we' were like wife annoyed not a little by the biting of an Indian FlyMangalore. %are they call Cacaroch, a name agreeable to its bad condition: for, living it vext our flelli • and being kill'd, fmelt as loathfomely as the French Punaife, whole fmell is odious'. This extremity continued not above a week: for then we had a frelhgale, by help where of the three and twentieth day we came to an Anchor at Mangalore, a City that obeys the Mallahar. In the road we found towards forty Mallabar Men of War riding, who not- withftanding their numbers and appetite to do us mifchief hoifed fail towards^ j one onely mifcarrying, that fufFeredthe Jonas's Barge to come up with her: but after vari able ftrife by rowing and making more fail got away, yet not without fome fhot in her fide which ihe unwillingly received. That night we came to an Anchor in,Mount E/ly or Delyns Bay, a Port under the valfalage of the Mallabar ,: we rode in nine fathom not above three being near the Ihore, and gladly would have landed, but durll not be too prodigal of our belief-, for albeit the Natives feerned willing to have us come a(hore,we knew them to be treacherous: feeing we would not truft them, they came aboard our Ships, daring to truft us *, anfl in their Canoos brought us Cocoes, Mangoes, Jacks, green Pepper, Cara- vance, BufTols, Hens, Eggs, and other things which we were glad to buy though not at ve ry eafie prices: but for every tun of Water lefs than a Ryal would not content them^ al beit they had plenty, bythat barbarifm infringing the very Law of Nature and Nations. Accordingly the Poet brings in his Goddefs blaming the Ruilicks for their immanity.

Neverthelefs, what was wanting in Water was fupplied in Fruit and other rarities; for here we had the Wood called Calambuco, a Tree much valued and ufed at Funerals:' the richer fort have gums and odours of Arabia put in flames, wherein the dead body being laid isconfumed ^ but firit involved in Linen which is pure, white, fweet and fine *, or in Taffataes of tranfparent finenefs- Of all forts of Wood they molt affed that called Ami- U\ and next that, or Calambuca, which fomztlimk Lignum Aloes much burnt in thefe parts at Funerals, Trees very rare^ growing but in few Regions. It is very fweet and delightful to the fmell jgrows high and even, and is found commonly in theiofty Moun tain of Chamoys in Cochin-chyna •, and being rare and hardly got, the people fell at exceffive rates; both in regard the Bannyans delight to have this wood in their Obfequies,and that the Japonians lb much value it for ornament in their Houfes. They imagine no Pillow wholfomer, nothing more conducing to health than that to fleepupon-, extremely hating what isfoft, for they find that fuch both heats the blood and perturbs the fancy, eipeci- ally where the Countreys are torrid. Of old they ufed to wrap thofe dead bodies that were to be burnt or purified in the fire in that kind of Linen called Linumvimm or Asbe- ftos, of w T h ich I have formerly fpoken: 1 fhall but add the defcription out of Hi erodes treat ing de vefte Bracman.

The tree has not only bloffoms, but green and ripe Fruit all at once , the root where the fap lies conftantly conveying vegetation to the tree in thofe warm Regions. The Bananaes were no lefs delightful; the tree is but low, yet Ipreads gracefully; the fruit is not unlike a Soffage for ihape, but in tafte is moft pleafant: they ripen though you crop them immaturely h and from a dark green,turn into a bright yellow: the rind peels ofFeafily, and the fruit being put into the mouth,diffolves and yields an incomparable relifh. The Jack grows upon a tree which is very low, yet not eafie to be afcended: for fhape it refembles a Pompion: without, 'tis of a yellow colour mixed with veins *, but within fiilkof golden coloured cloves, each of them being full of kernels, not unlike the largeft fort of French Bean, but fomewhat more globous: the fruit hath in it a ftone, which be ing boiled the Buffols eat. the fruit is fomewhat unpleafant at the firft guft, which as.

The Jnanas is not inferiour to the in bulk, albeit the plant it Ipring from be no way equal: for it arifes not from feed, but a Root like that of an Artichock: at ma turity they rife not above two foot, whereby with lefs labour they enrich the gatherer: without, 'tis armed with a moiftlefs rind which is hard but pleafant within: and though a little feem ,to fatiate, yet experience teaches that the ftomach covets it and admits an eafie digeftion. The Duroyen refembles the Jackj the fhape is round,and the out-fide beau tiful, yet that beauty exceeds not the inward vcrtue for albeit at firft opening it give a fmell not unlike a rotten Onion which to many feems ofFenfive, the meat nevertheiefs is of a whitilh colour and divided into a dozen cells or partitions which are filled with Hones as big as Cheftnuts, white and cordial. In Malacca and Java they abound moffc and are worth the enquiring after •, for it is a fruit both nutritive and dainty, yea, with out an hyperbole an Epitome of the belt and rareft fruits throughout the Orient. Arec and Betde alfo are here much in ufe. The Arecca tree grows very high and refembles the Palmeto: the wood is fuzzie and foft and hangs like fhaded grapes in clufters; the fruit is ihaped like a Wall-nut, and of like bignefs; white within, and not eafily pene- trated ^ but like good oyl hath neither tafte nor fmell; for they eat it not alone, but wrap it in a leaf of Betele or Betree which hath neither flower nor moifture, and chew it in morfels. Some ( as I have noted ) mix with it a kind of Lime like that of Oyfters-lhells which together (if they fay true) cures the cholick, removes melancholy, kills worms, purges the maw, preferves the teeth, prevents hunger, and ftupifies the fenfe: which laft vertue occafions the Indians Women to chew it when they go to burning with their dead Husbands. • Mount Elly is in 12 degrees latitude,in 55 degrees 30 minutes longitude; variation 13 degrees; A place as eminent in Hills as any other part we faw upon the coaft of India, and limits the two rich and populous Kingdoms Decan and Mallabar, It gave^his re- femblance as we rode before it. An unhappy accident happened us here, before we weighed anchor: For, on the five and twentieth day defcrying at the point of the Bay a Junk of feventy Tuns fraught with merchandize and bound for Acheen j we could likewife perceive a Mallabar Pirat fculk near this Junk, which he doubted not to board being off at Sea and paft our help. As accordingly fell out: for being under fail, the Man of War gave her chafe: the Junk perceiving danger, chofe rather to put her felf under our protedion than hazard the rapine of that Frigat. But her condition (with grief I fpeak it) was little better ; for the Jonas boarding her with her Barge, tow'd her to our Admiral, where (after fbort confultation ) fhe was adjudged prize.

The Sea-men it appeared were to make what advantage they could unto themfelves: for, they firft gave the Indians that were aboard a churlifh welcome, by which they perceived they intended to make them flaves and fell them to the Javans, who ufiially give fifty Ryals for every Slave •, which rather than fuffer, threefcore of thofe poor wretches threw themfelves defperately into the Sea *, choofing rather to ex- pofe their CarcafFes to the waves than the mercy of our Men, if I may fo call it: which fcem'd fport to fome there, but not fo to me who had compaflion: nor could 1 be in formed what provocation had been given our Men to make fuch a proceeding.

That night we had terrible weather, much rain mixed with thunder and lightning. This ftormy weather is ufual here when the Sun is neareft and makes their - Summer; Mount ■ anamtc ■Coajl of Mallabai 4 . Summer-, for then upon thiscoaft they have the greateflfigiTof Winter front the Summer Solltice to the Autumnal iEcjuihox continuing wind and rain, which makes it exceeding boifterous and unfafe to travel. Thefe extraordinary rains are without doubt the caufes ot the yearly over-flowing of the Mam in and in = as alfo of the two great African Rivers Nyger and Ntim ; feeing that like weather at the fame Seafon is in thtv£chtopia» Mountains. Howbeit, thofe months and Am/?, albeit they be ftormy in IndU are the fairelt months of the Year, and calraeft weather in the Mediterranean and thofe Countreys that are about that Climat. But 1 looked upon it then as a fign of God's dilpleafure. And it is well worth our obfervation. That whereas all May, June, July and jingufi our Summer, and the like with all or molt parts of Ett- rofefrom the Pole Ardick to 50 degr. and more towards the iEquator where it begins the Sky is for the molt part ferene and the Seafon warm and mild i it is Winter in the Oriental Regions(in fome parts ftretching from the Tropick of Cancer to the /Equinodtial Line) during thofe four months. Inafmuch as their Summer begins in fuch time as die Sun enters into Libra. For, from the mouth of the River in 23 degr. to Cape Comryn in 7 degr. North latitude, all along the Indian Coalt of Decan and Mallabar, the Weather during thole four months is exceeding ftormy and outragious through continued rain, wind, thunder and lightning; but is fair Sun-ihine weather all the other 8 months : Albeit it is not fo in the other Neighbouring parts of India. For whereas the mighty Mountain Bellaiate (which ! formerly refembled to the Jiyennym) runs in a continued ledge of Hills crofs from Imam to Cape Cowry#, the utmoft Cape or Pro montory of India towards the Line, through the middle of the Continent: and, as it were, in an asquidiftance between the Indian Ocean and Bengalan Gulph: It is obferved by feveral Travellers, and by Linfcotin amongft the reft. That in croffing the Countrev betwixt thofe Seas at the fame time,on the one fide that Hill they findUt Summer, and fxnd it Winter on the other. So as when it rains and blows, with dreadful thunder and flalhes intermixt, all along the Coaft of Mallabar as far as Din near Indm y ( and all thofe four months I lately named) no Sun appears: Contrarily on the Coaft otChormandel, in which are the Kingdoms of Gnlcmda % Narjingaand Fifiapore, all along from the River Games to Cape Comryn, thofe Countreys on that fide Bellagm have then clear Sun-lhine weather without mixture of rain, wind or ftormy weather^ and yet from the Hill to either Sea is not above icq miles: And vice verfa, the feafon varies, which is very rare, the little diftance duely confidered.

M ALL AB A'R is at this day a great and famous part of India ftretching along from Batticala a Port under 14 degr. to Cape Comryn* which is about 7 degrees North from the iEquinodial: about four hundred miles in length, but in breadth no where above a hundred, which fome reduce to fifty, that is, from that ridge of Hills we call Bellagate to the Weftern Ocean: fo populous, that the Samoryn of Calicut is able upon occafion to take the Field with 200000 Men to oppofe the Narfingan, the Decan, or GulcundanKings, his powerful Neighbours. His Countrey is moft of the Year verdant and abounding with Cattel, Corn, Cotton, Silk-worms, Pepper, Ginger, Tamarind, Caffia, Cardajnome, Rice,ti Deutroa.J\(a}roes ; Art and Diet they invent towards provocation. Amongft others, they have the Demroa in fpecial requeft; both for that it contributes towards the accomplifhing their corrupt ends, and with that fecurity and mode as heightens their recreation. An Herb or Drug it is which being infufed or otherwife prepared and taken, has a marvellous force; For it is not fo much of a foporiferous quality to procure fleep, as to ftupifie and kifatuate the Intelled •, fince the patient or rather abufed party fometimes appears merry as if a T aran- tufa had infeded him, and hath his eyes open, but fees no otherwife than if &amp;gutta ferena or heated Steel had deprived the optique*^ fo as during the operation the Nayro many times makes that his opportunity to vifit and ad his Amours, whiles the good man by that delufive fpell is rendred a ridiculous ipedator, and feeminglyanalfentortotheir mefchan- teries.

JMajfatii in his belief That thefe Nayroes are ofthecaftof tfa'Cmteries one of thede- fcendants of Vourom and Parcouty in the foregoing difcourfe more fully mentioned, is not amifs^ or in the report That they are generally proud andlazie, ufually go armed, and will not abate one jot of the common ornament of thofe Oriental parts, which is to beau- tifie or rather load their arms and necks with Silver bracelets, ropes of Pearl and other effeminate pieces of bravery: and fo ftately, that they exped more than ordinary refped ^ as appears in palfing through a Crowd, only by ftriking his Sword upon his Target iriakes that voice ferve both to exprefs his Dignity and to obtain a fpeedy and clear paf- fage.« Thevet Vertoman and Vaulm Venem go further, faying That an inferiour perfon dare not look them in the fact or appear within fifty paces. But this is more certain^ That as the Sword awes the indefenfive Villager, fo cuftom has enflaved them in fuch fort, that in Peace the common people feem daftardly, but in War are found fpirited. Nor would one think otherwife, when he takes the profped of their vifage and limbs, which exprefs both ingenuity and ftrength fufficient. Of colour, they are rather black than olivafter: their hair crifps, but grows longer than the Africans. And albeit they wear their hair^ yet conform they to the mode of Shalhes: for, about their Temples they wreath a curious fort of linnen fometimes wrought with Silk aiidGold. Their wafte is circled with a piece of Callico , but fromthe thigh downward, and from the middle upwards are naked. The vulgar wear about their wafte a party-coloured Plad, and pink their skin. The V^omen vail themlelves like other Indi ans. Their greatefl: pride is exprefTed in the adorning their ears and nofes; fuppoiing them molt courtly who dilacerate their ears wideft (which they effed by many ponderous baubles they hang there,) and ring their fnouts with Jewels of Silver, Brafs, or ivory •, their arms and legs alfo are richly chained. Concerning their Marriages, formerly it was the cuftom That the Bracman had the firft nights company with the Bride, fuppofing the ground of better vklue by that holy feed, as they call it: a pradife*now wholly abrogated. And which was no lefs rare, theSamo- reen to make fure work ufed to confer his Command upon his Sifters ilfue *, allured it feems that fhe was of his blood and they of his by confequence. The men are more addided to Arms than Arts. The PortHgals at their firft intrenching on their ihore thought them a very fimple fort of people becaufe unlearned •, and eafie to be overcome becaufe moft were naked; but both deceived them*, for Nature inftruded them in their o wn defence, and long eonteft with the Tortugals taught them experience, fo as in ihort time they learned how to ufe their bow and arrow, darts and targets •, and of late years have attained the Art of making Hand-granadoes and other Fi re-works •, where in they are pregnant, and of which they have fuch ftore that they proffered us as much and of what fofts we would for money. Their Country abounds with Minerals and Stones of price, and no part is without plenty of fruit and other provifion: Howbeit, the Land (efpe- cially near the Sea-fhore) we could perceive was woody and mountainous. And in thofe which divide Mdllahar from the Kingdom of Narjinga are many wild Beafts that make the way perillou^ •, efpecially Serpents which have wings and feet, if report fpeak truth.

Faffing from thence, we came afore C A L LIC U T (ten leagues from that place where our men took the prize foremen- tioned) thought by fome to be that Town Ptolomy calls CamhapisfiCity in 23 degrees, an errour broached by Niger and Berlins. Above a thoufand years ago it was called then of fome note^but not fo well known as now j and had increafed her fame by more trade had Ihe profpered better againft the continued differences it had with the Portugal : who when they could not conquer by force (zsSeleuchm did with Babylon) ruined her by policy ► for they transferred their Mart and Staple to other Towns v by which removal in fmall time this City became poor and defolate. It declines from the TEquator towards the North-pole eleven degrees*, and from its Handing in the burning Zone muft needs be at fome time of the year fulphureous. The earth is but meanly fruitful in grafsneverthelci%her Gardens by induftry and help of lome Brooks are moll part of the year verdant ana redundant in variety of fruits and flowers. The City of it felf is large, but of fmall elegancy in building: for the houfes are low, thick and dark, and the ftreets narrow: The Harbour is a pretty way diftant from the Town, and but indifferent to anchor in: yet (hews the remains of two ftrong Forts which were raifed about the year 1515. by the Portuguez,-, in a fort demo- lilhed fince by the Mallabar. The Samoreen in this place has his ufual abiding : a Prince of great power and awe; andnotmore black of colour than treacherous in difpofition. Many deformed Pagotha's are here worfhipped *, having this ordinary evafion, That they adore not Idols, but the Deumo's they reprefent: moft of which at one time or other have been defaced and deftroyed by the Portugal. The Chappel where the grand Caco-Demno ufed to fit, was uncovered, and about three yards high: the wooden entrance was engraven with hideous fhapes: within, their beloved Priapm was enthroned upon a mount 't Ocnlis mirabile Monflrum ; for upon his head he wore a Diadem, whence iffued four great Rams horns fuch as Jupiter Ammon in memory of the Ram that conduced chm and his female Army through thofe Deferts was reprefented, and being diftreffed for want of water had it given (upon his prayer to Jupiter] by a ftroke of the Rams Foot up on a Rock: and if not that, typing out fome other myftery. His eyes were linall and fquint *, his mouth large and opening like a Port-cullice, from whence branched four great tusks v but his nofe was flat; his beard Ipread like the rayes of the Sun •, his hands reiem- bled the claws of a Vulture •, his thighs and legs were ftrong and hairy •, feet and tail moft like that of a Monkey : which put together, rendered the Devil hot unlike himielf, wick edly deformed, and the Men beyond meafure grofs Idolaters. Other Temples they had, ftuffed with other Pagods of like prodigious deformity •, ugly all, yet all differing as to in vention .• for fome of them were painted black, others red •, forfie devouring fouls *, and ufually fuch as were in Hell were white ones. Thefe are of the old ftamp •, for they fecm to threaten or otherwise to exprefs fatisfadion in mens offerings: but what they could not do, their Chemarims effeded ^ for, each morn the Prieft (ajogue) perfumes and wafhes them : It feems the Devil ever leaves a filthy fmell behind, being his manner of benedidion. Every new Moon their cuftom was to facrifice a live Cock, the fymbol of lull and courage which they found in themfelves predominating. At this ceremony the Prieft was p'ontifkally attired in Lawn, armed with a fharp lilver Knife, his arms and legs garnifhed after the Morifco mode with Bells or round filver plates which made a jingling: and after he had facrificed the yielding Cock, and filled his hands with Rice, goes retrograde, not daring to look up&amp;n any other objed fave his Idoltill being come near an Acherontic lake, fuddenly he turns about and embowels his offering: after which, he advances his hands fome times above his head, and fo returns, fuppofing that his Holocauft was accepted. The Samoryn ufed not to eat till it were firft offered, and fo acknowledged as food fent him from hisDeumo : what he leaves, is not given the Poor i for it is the Crows pittance: good reafontoo, They think them his ferviteurs. The people to this day (as they fuppofe) retain fone incbmmendable cuftomes: for they exchange their Wives: nor feem the Women dilpleafed at it, Polygamy is fo tolerable orCmlam, or rather acceptable: but in this they differ from other libidinous Law-givers V as the men have many Wives, fo one woman here is allowed many husbands^ and the iffue bequeathed as Ihe nominates. The old cuftom of the World is here retained, in the Sedge and Palmeto leaves they ufe for paper j the pen being then a ftile of Iron, but now a har dened piece of wood cut (harp. Thence we palled by C O W L A M a Town and Province called Sopatpa in Arrhyan, and Colay in Ptolomy who places it in 13 degrees, but we found it in 9 degrees North, included in the Travan- Zorian Kingdom. Once it obeyed the Narfingan Monarch, and once the Mallabar, but at this day neither. About two hundred years ago. the Town was rich, and great and populous •, traded to by many Indians, enlarged by the Samoryn, and able to number a hun dred thoufand Inhabitants ^ of fuch repute it then was for fcituation, trade, and fidelity of the Cowlamites. But now&gt; the period of her excellency is outrun; for Callicm firft, and then Goa have not only monopolized but attracted the trade of this as well as other parts thereabouts. Now albeit I have mentioned the Bannyans in lundry places as I meet with them here alfo all along this coaft I find theyfwarm in multitudes, fucking in the fweetnefs of gain by an immeafurable thirft and induftry, but Sic vos non vobis, for it is raviihed from them by Drones, the Moors and Gentiles lording it over them. Alas! the Bannyan is no fwaggcrer, no royfter: he abhors domineering and fighting» yea, fuffers himfelf to be fleeced by any man, rather than refill or Ihed blood by breach of peace or making the lealt oppofition *, they love no tumult, no innovation ^ are content to fubmit rather than go vern, and wilh all were of their mind*, that is to fay, morally honeft, courteous in beha viour, temperate inpaffion, decent in apparel, abftemious in dyet, induftrious in their callings, charitable to the needy, humble, merciful, and fo innocent as not to take away the life of the fillieft vermin, and no marvel, feeing that if they fhould deftroy any living; thing, thereby they might diao^ge their friends of a peaceful Manfion, or devour the fouls of fuch as weredeareft to them: for as I have elfewhere noted, they verily credit the tranfanimation or paflage of fouls into beafts. A perfwafion how ftrange foever it be to us, was not fo of old to our Countreymen the Druida; who not only believed the im mortality of the fouls of men, but after leparation from the body that they paifed from one man unto another. Ovid feems to allude unto it, Leis home, and in bruit beafts our bodies hide, Where happily our Parents may abide.

Thomas Chriftians. More certain it j| their Anceftors were converted byS. Thomas the Apoftle *, for both here and moft other parts of the habitable World the Apoftles without all doubt divulged the dad tidings of falvation,as fore-told by the Prophet David, Pfal. 19. There is no Speech nor Lan guage where their voice is not heard: their found is gone into all Lands, and their words unto the ends of the World. Mantuan alfo gives this atteftation.

Notwithftanding which,Chrift has his flock; which though fcattered, in due time will be gathered. For in Perfia are many thoufand; and in India a no lefs multitude: neverthelefs, compared with other Idola ters, but a handful : Which mult not difcourage, feeing 'tis better go to Heaven alone, Xx 2 thanthan to Hell with a multitude. Arnobim of old could fay, Natiomhm cmftis nosfumrn Chrifliam: Some Chriftiam are found in every Nation. And we find in many chiefly Maritime Towns of India, that Name of late years has been honoured v and that in Me- liapore, Narfinga, Coolam, Cucnrran, Cwrigan, Biyur, Tanor, Battacala, Onor^ Cramanor Goa and other Places, Chriftianity is own'd ; yea, in many of tht Indian Ifles fome are found. And one reafon js, for that among Mahometans liberty of Confcience is allow 'd • agreeable to an Awara in the Alcoran, which declares That none are to be diffwaded from the Religion they fuckt from their cradle : which gains Chrifliam peaceful Habita tions., and inclines them to live without difturbing the publick. Now thefe Indian Chriftians have fundry Ceremonies and Forms of long time pradifed araongft themfelves, differing from thofe the Tapacy ufe, or the Reformed Churches of Europe. Their Churches are low and poorly furnilhed ^ yet neat they are and fweetly kept •, matted, and without painted Images, which the Greeks Churches abound with. They affemble cheerfully, and at their entring ihut their eyes, the better to contemplate the Exercife they come about, with their own unworthinefs: kneeling they look towards the Altar, near which the Prieft is feated: Him they falute with humble reverence • who returns his Bleffing by the up-lifting of his hands and eyes: and at a fet hour begins Prayers feldom exceeding two hours in the whole Exercife. Firft, a brief confeffion is made, not unlike that in our Liturgie, and aflent too in an unanim Amen. After that, follows an Ex- pofition of fome part pf Scripture': during which their attention, looks, and filence is commendable. They fmg a Hymn, and at parting out of the Church re-falute the Mi- nifter •, who ceafes not to elevate his hands till all the People be departed. At home they ufually read a Chapter in either Teftament, both which they fuppofe they have in corrupt after the Originals, tranflated for them by Saint Thomas the Patron of the Orient: The Chaldee alfo is not unknown, but few fave the Clergy underftand what is writ in any other than their Mother-tongue: for their Schools are few, and onely teaches them to ready being without Academies or Inftruders in Philofophy or other like learning Every firft Sunday in the month the Prieft reads a Homily, writ ( as they fay ) by the A' poftle or fome of his Difciples. They baptize commonly at the fortieth day, if the Pa rent defire it not fooner : they fign the fore-head with the Crofs, ^and then wafh all over with Water. The Lord's Supper they adminifter in both kinds, and Communicants receive it kneeling: they obferve two dayes preparation, during which they eat no nem, revel not, nor accompany with Women 5 and in the Church, if need be, make their Confeffion. The Clergy marry but once, the Laity twice, Widdows if they marry before the year be expired are ill reported of. None lave in cafe of adultery have li cence to divorce. In ficknefs the Prieft is ufually fentfor, both to pray and give the Eucharifl, if defired: Which done, they take a long farewel of Wife, Children and 0- thersand fo rid themfelves of worldly diftradlions, which too oft hinder that laft great work *, fo as by a contemplation of the joyes of Heaven they ftrive to mitigate the grim afped of approaching death. Being dead the furvivors rather joy than mourn •, and having iirit warned the Corps they afterwards wrap it in clean linnen.

The foil is good and abounds with fundry forts of Spi ces*, as Pepper, Ginger, and the like*, but in moil plenty with Cinamon, which gave the occafion to Ptolomy and Strabo to call it Cinamomifera regio. Cinamon is a precious bark ^ the Tree is ftraight, and the branches are no way ruinous but grow in comely order. It refembles the Olive Tree in height, but the leaves are more like the Bay or Orenge. The bloffoms are exadly white; the fruit globous, hard, and dark coloured. It is apparelled with a thick rind, which in Summer (when it may beft difebver its Virgin nakednefs) 'tis difrobed of, and by the churlilh Peafant cut in many pieces •, and being hardned in the Sun, fo gathered.

Garcia* ah HomPhyfician to the Goan Vice-Roy reports, That the King ufed to b^ fer- ved in dilhes of Loadftone; not onely for the rarity, but medicinable vertue thereof, as having a power to difcover poyfon and continue Youth.

Now concerning Ganges, (which one ( how truly I know not) fayes was called Chliaros j probably fome River running into Ganges', or as it may be named in thofe or fome other obfeure places) amongft Rivers is iecond to none : For, after a flux of three thoufand miles, having increafed her Channel by fifty other Rivers that run into her, which for above an hundred miles double the brea'dth that Euphrates bears at old Babylon, and thrice its depth, divides India in two, branches it felf into le- veral ftreams^ and has many noted Towns built upon her banks, affording them Earth and Water as good as any, and by thzBamyans held facred, as Luc an /. 3. albeit miftaken in its courfe, takes notice.

Here any Religion is tolerable^ and Omnigmum^ Deum Monfira feems tranflated hither. But the manner of their Marriages is extraordi nary; For many times the Prieft with a Cow, and the Man and Woman go together to the Water fide*, where the Bramyn firft mutters a fhort prayer, and then links their hands about the Cows tail, pours upon them all his hallowed Oyl 5 and laftly forces the beaft in to the River, whereinto fhe goes willingly fo far as till they be to the middle in Water • neither returns fhe nor do they dif-unite till the waves advife them: when being onfhore they untie, and hold that myfterious tie forcible and facred ever after. Mr. Fitch the Mer chant in his travels through thefe parts makes the like obfervation. The Heathen are a- verfe to Law, and alfo to Morality ^ as if in a malignant fort they refilled the very liberty of Nature for their prefervation, as Pint, in Me x and. —-—- Et quod Nat my a remit tit In- vida jura negant; as alfo may be obferved by Dendamys the Indian expoftulating with Alexander againft Pythagoras. Suitable to which the People upon this allow the Ban- nyans Wives the liberty to burn with their dead Husbands: So that Death having cut in two their Union, the relid conceits her felf a loathed Carcafs; and refolving to make her felf an Holocauft, robes her Body with a tranfparent Lawn *, her arms, legs and thighs alfo are fettered with chains cxpreffing love ; but her ears, nofe and fingers are ad orned with Pearl and precious Stones: with one hand fhe holds a Nofe-gay of flowers, in the other a ball both which are emblemes of Paradife. She is attended with a great nura- ber 5 fome accompanying her for love, others for civility, but moft for her encouragement and honour of the Ceremony: the Prieft all the way fhe goes defcribes the joys fhe is to poflefs, and theaffurance the has to enjoy her Husband fpeedily m Elyuum: fhe returns a modeft fmile,trips on,chawing fomething in her mouth that intoxicates her brain,and upon fight of the flame feems tranfported with fatisfadcion. So foon as fhe fees the Cafcais of her Husband laid upon a pile and the fire burn, like a mad Lover fhe whirls about the pit, and having bid Farewel to Parents, Children, and Friends, Iwjlingly incorporates with the fire; which quickly makes them one in allies: Mufick of fundry forts, and acclama tions of Spedators yell aloud at the fame inftant, both for the greater honour of the Ob- fequy, and that the fcrieches of the poor Wretch may not be heard,whereby others may be dilcouraged. it feems the Roman Poets, though at a great diftance, had fome profpedl of it, by this funeral Song they have warbled out in their memorial: They flrive to die, and who heft freed fiiall make \ They blujhj grim Death fo Jlowly to o 7 retake.

Howbeit, this cuftom of burning is much more ancient with Men amonglt the Braemans of thofe parts than with the other Sex: for with the later it catrte notinpraftice until ftveral of their Husbands were made away by poyfon, which their laicivious Wives would frequently adminifter upon giving them diftafte, or other fleight r a V0 A at i 01 ! *' prevention whereof, this Draco's Law was devifed and enjoin'd the Re- i though in its inflitution it feem'd fevere, it was to deter them from that wicked pracuce, which long cuftom hath made familiar and reputable.

Such is the miferable vaflalage with which this wretch ed Generation are enflaved, and fo far from any fenfe of their mifery, that they have de- vifed fundry tragic fcenes to heighten the reputation of their Pagod, though with their owndeftrudion. And amongft other ABusTnamf hales a malTie idol of auri-calk is pla ced upon a Chariot with eight wheels richly gilded *, the afcent is by leveral eafie fteps, upon which efpecially upon gawdy dayes the Jogues and many proftituting Girls were placed. Oh ignis infernalis luxwria!

Thus mounted, they go on in proceflion: a procelTion not unlike the Thenfa ufed by the fuperftitious Romans, or that Idolatry of the Danes recorded by Ditmarm and Do do : for, happy is that man, be he rich or poor, great or bafe, that can lend a hand to draw the Chariot yea, they account them happieft who out of a frantick zeal temera- rioufly throw their naked bodies in the way, to the end that by the ponderoufnefs of the Chariot they maybe cruihed, that thereby they may become the Devils Martyrs. Thus remembred by a Poet, Which bad objeds removed, we come to MELIAPORE, a well known T own upon the coafl: of Chormandel, and in the King dom of Bifnagar. The Artie f ole there has 13 degrees 20 minutes: It was firit called Sa- lamina, then Melange, but Meliapore after that, and now S.

At this day it is but fmall and poor, and under a MoOrilh command: it yields little for Trade fave Cotton-ware and fuch common commodities', howbeit,is exalted in her memory, in regard that (according to Tradition) this was the place where that ho ly Apoftle finilhed his labours after he had publiflied the glad tidings of Salvation through Perjia, tiytcania, Batlria, Sogdiana and many parts of India, and by Divine Grace ob tained many Profelytes, and thofe converts not of the meaner fort ^ for Sygamm theEm- perourhimfelf was baptized, and by his good example feveral other of the Nobles*, who in teftimony of their change, converted the Heathen Temples (by fomefaidtobe three hundred) into Houfes of Prayer and Preaching of the Gofpel. Howbeit, the Devil fo wrought, that fome Apoftates enraged the multitude, fo as in a blind zeal the Apoitle and the King both fuffered, the one being fhot to death, the other brained, but both crowned with glorious Martyrdom: This hapned about thirty years after our Saviours paffion *, and in memory thereof a commemorative Feaft is yearly celebrated the fir 11 of July by the Native Chriftians through India, And, however Abdias Babylonicm (who writ.

A Miracle not a little joying the mournful Chriftians, as the Tradition of that place reports for verity. Near this are other noted Towns, viz..

More Northward upon this coaft is MESULIPATAN, by contradion commorily pronounced Meflqatan: a Town removed from the iEquinodial 16 degrees and a half, North ^ now under the Gulcundan King, and in the skirt of the BengalanGulph. The Province admits a mixture of Idola ters ; the Gentiles are moft in number, but leaft in power, fince the Mogul fubjeded them. Mahomet was firft blazoned amongft them by a Colony of Perjiam who were conduded thither in the 28. year of the Hegyra, of our account 648. by Ahdal-ben-Hemyr a man of no fmall command under Ozjman then Calyph of Babylon fince which Invafion their ofF- ipring have here continued. The Town it feif neither for bulk nor beauty is confidera- ble: one reafon may be, for that fifty years ago by a raging mortality and famine it was almolt unpeopled and made defolate. The ftreets are but few, and thofe narrow; the houfes low, and the fields parched by the extremity of heat which here rages from March to July from whence to November wind and rain as inceiTantly diilurbs them: fo as of twelve months they have but four, that is to fay, from November to falubrious and moderate. Thefe rains neverthelefs prepare the Earth for feed, and requite the Labourer fo weil,asof Rice^CaravanceSjand other Grain they ufually annually reap two Harvefts. Howbeit, the Town byreafon the English refide there, and of late traffique for Caliicoes, Rice, and the like, begins to revive ; and will increafe, unlefs the deceitful dif- pofition of the people occafion their remove thence unto Armagun and Poly cat, Towns up on the fame coaft neighbouring M^atan-, where they may fit down with more eafe, lefs charge, and have as choice variety of Merchandize.

The Mofques Ihew Art in Sculpture, but are hateful in the Itink of their devotion: for here the lhapes the Pagods bear have fome refemblance with Priapus and Panfis defcribed by Servim in the 2 Eclog. of Virgil, having great eyes, flat nofe, wide mouth, four great horns, a long beard fhaped like the radiance of the Sun, claws for hands, and crooked-legg'd •, fo, as it is all over deformed. Among other their folemn Feftivals, the myftic fopperies dedicated to inthele parts are not utterly extinguilhed: as may appear by the drefs, mimique frisks, and night ly paftimes the women pradife.

And firft concerning the Name: It is agreed by moft That it is derived from Ophar Son of Joktan, Son of Eher, the third in defcent from Shew the Son of Noah, mentioned in Genefis) chap. 10. verC 26. upon the fixing his plantation: which albeit the Scripture clears, neverthelefs from analogy of the Name and from the abundance of Gold and Ivory found in feveral oppofite parts of the Earth, the place is tolTed to and fro, whereby the difcovery of the true place is obfcured and becomes more difficult*, yea, not any Hifto- ncal part of Scripture more controverted that 1 can meet with,than this Ophyr. Amongft many others I fhall inftance Kabanns Mawrus-y and from his light Chv. Columbus', whole Au thority Stefhanm inclines to, and whofe joint opinion it is, That a great IQe that verges towards the Gulph of Mexico was Oyhyr ; to which conjefture they are led by no other reafon I can find than that the Spaniard has thence extraded a mafs of Silver, Gold and precious Stones-, but no Ivory: albeit what they have (tawn thence is little, compared with what other parts of the Terra firma in South America efpecially about 2otofi have af forded *, which Mines neverthelefs are far more uberous in Silver than Gold, the laft be ing the emphafis of Ophyr: a metal we fee by daily experience much more plentiful in Afiick^and Afta than the new-found World that hath hitherto been difcovered. Howbeit, tis probable that removal of Ophyr into the Occident, but elpeciallv the fimilitudeof the Name in like manner perfwaded Goropim to infer (and not without Ibme vehemency)that it was rather in Tern. Now the reafon he gives is, Becaufe Vemyam and Veru are har monious in found; and indeed it is not deny'd that Ophyr and are terms conver tible-, as may appear by comparing the 1 Kings 9.29. with theiChron. 3. 6. Where for the better fortifying that conjedure, they with like reafon perfwade their Readers that Sepher is that mighty Mountain or rather chain of Hills now called the Andes which furge to a marvellous height and penetrate the heart of Peru, not ceafing their courfe until they come in fight of the Streights called Magellane. Notwithftanding which Ortelim rejeding that of the Teutonic perfwades that he has made a more real difcovery of the place in v£- gtfymha or Sou^th Africk^: for in his Thefaurm he mentions a Town and Province called Phura a part of Sojfala which was attainable by Solomons fhips from Euon-geher without the help of any Gompafs, and where there is fuch ftore of Gold, precious Stones, Ivory and Ebony ( v/hich fome take for the Algummin wood) as no other part of the World attords more plenty. Yea, to ftrengthen that imagination others fuppofe that by the wordOphyr word Sophyra (which is Ophyr anagrammatized) mentioned in the L XX11 Interpreters is intended or meant Soffala or Sophura, as to attain their ends, they wreft it ^ albeit St. romehy that name intends Sepher. But which is more ftrange Pynada a learned Man for the mater honour of his Countrey from the like Analogie of Name fancies That the Ille of Cadiz, was Ophyr: which Montanm diflikes, and therefore removes it into Afrkk^ as far as Carthage: and fome others dif-approving his, into Guinea and the River Gam- hra, which for plenty of Gold gives not place to any part of the Univerfe. But Danem no lefs taken with his conceit pretends that he has found it at Ormus \ upon no other ac count I can find, than the golden Trade it had in his time. So that we fee, meerly to pleafe the imagination ; feveral otherwife learned Men have laboured to difcover Ophyr in feveral Quarters of the World oppofite to the opinions of Saint Jerome) Saint sfugHjlin and other reverend and judicious Authors, who have more accurately Mered their reafon to be direded bytheun-erring Rule which plainly inftrudts. That Ophyr and Havilah with the reft of Johtans Sons had their dwelling from Mefta as thou goeft unto a Moun tain of the Eaft, Gen. 10. 30^ Eaft muft be underftood from Babel where the firft divi- fion was of the Sons of Noah, and Eaft alfo from Arabia, where 'tis prefumed was writ the Pentateuch: and that being infallible, convinces^ and puts to filence thofe opinions I lately mentionednone of the places they affign being Eaft from thence, but in diametro oppofite and repugnant to that of Mofes his manududion. But for the better manifeftation of the true place we are therefore to confider, That Ophyr eft verhum profluens-, OhrizMm and Opheriznm being the fame: Quia ex infdjt Ophyr Aurtm eft fraftantifjimim, faithS. Jerom\ albeit the word Ohnzum or Ohruwri fignifies Au- rum fincerum vel igne purgattm. Gold well refined, as P% obferveth. It is alfo called Ophyr in 1' Kings 22. 48. but Vphm and Ophaz. in Jcrem. 10. 9, Dan. 10.5. Auphar by the Arabians^ in whole Countrey the Name is likewiie placed and in the Targum or Babylonian para- phrafe Ophy : Yea,' in fome other ancient Authors Mophaz? and Vrphee by Eupolemm. Moreover, fometimes Ophyr is glanced at under the name of Tharfis. But that Ophyr s Colony planted in Eaft-India, where Mejha and Sepher in their Feftigia may yet be found I fhall in brief demon Urates not only from the current of Authentick Writers, but alfo from the Names and memory of the Originary Planters: albeit rationally it cannot be imagined but that through length of time, revolutions of State and diverfity of Idioms, they as well as other things have been fubjed to variations. In the firft of Kings chap. 9. verf. 26. alfo in 2 Chron. ch. 8- verf. 18. it is recorded That King Solomon made a Navy of jhips in Ezion-geber which is befides Eloth and the brinks of' the Red fea in the Land of Edom: and Hyramfent with the Navy his Servants who had knowledge of the Sea with Solomons Ser~ vants j and they came O P H Y R, and from thence brought four hundred and fifty Talents of Gold j in our money about three million and fix hundred thoufand Crowns. In the 2 Chr. 9. 10. Hyram and Solomons Servants who brought Gold from Ophyr j brought alio Algum- min wood. And in 1 Kings 10'. 22. Solomon had upon the Sea the Navy of Tharfis with Ha- rams Navy) and once in three years came 'the Navy of Tharfis, which brought Gold, Silver, Ivory, Apes and Peacocks, &amp;c. By which it appears the Port from whence that Fleet fet fail vMs Ezion-geber. Therefore to evince Ortelius, If the Navy failed from Bzion-geber to Soffala, the'courfe they were then to fteer would have been Weft from Guardafu a Cape-land that gives the firft in4et into the Red-fea from the Ocean*, which is the con trary way or point of the Compafs to that part of the World the Scripture tells us Ophyr made his plantation. Befides, the Port that Fleet fet fail towards was certainly a much greater diftance than Soffala, which from Edon-geber with a fair wind might well be attained in a months time*, whereas the voyage to Ophyr was triennial, or in lefs than 3 years not to be accomplifhed: not that they fpent that time in providing the Cargo, which probably by Merchants and others was fell in preparation 5 but rather through diftance of place, and the long way they made e're they could attain their port *, for in regard they had no Compafs to dired their way, 'tis likely they feared to put to Sea without ken of Land, but crept along the Arabian and Indian fhores,as at this day the Mogul's great Shahee or Junk ufes to do when it fets fail from Swalley road to Mocha in the Red-fea, once in two or three years moft richly loaden. And albeit it cannot be deny'd. That King Solo mon was the richeft Prince in his time, feeing that in Ecdw 47. 'tis faid, Collegit Aurum quaft Auricalcum^ &amp; Argentum ut Plumbum, He gathered Gold as Tyn, and Silver as Lead, lb was he the wifeft; tor he was filled with Underftanding as with a flood, he furnifhed the Earth with grave and wife Sentences by reafon of his Songs, Proverbs, Similitudes and Interpretations he difcourfed of Trees from the Cedar in Lebanon to the HyfTop up on the Wall, and People from all the Kings of the Earth came to hear and to admire his Wifdome, 1 IGngs 4. 5 2. whence it may be inferred,That his knowledge was admirablein Nature's Secrets: Neverthelefs that he exprefled his knowledge concerning the won derful nature and ufe of the Magnet is not mentioned in any of thofe of his that are ex tant. For the ufe of the Magnet was found of late years by Fla-Matyhi a Calahreez.: Of fuch vertue and ufe faith Bodin cap, 7. that Tot a rertm Namra nihil admirabilm-, nfm 'enim ejtis eft plane Dhinm, &amp;€. So as had the ufe of the Magnet been then known and pradi- led, the Voyage in all probability might have been overcome in fix months fpace, asfhips at this day give frequent proof of. Navigation was then but in its infancy ^ neither the ufe of Sea Chart nor Compafs being in thofe dayes known, nor in probability the Cele- ftial obfervations, which by Sea-men now are commonly pradifed: fo as then to ad venture into the Ocean out of fight of Land, would have been an ad very daring if not delperate. But we do not read that the vertue of the Magnet was known or made ufe of in that Age or long after by the Phoenicians^ who neverthelefs were the firft that perfeded Navigation. For that the Polary Diredion was altogether unknown unto the Ancients, is agreed by mofl; notwithftanding that noted fpeech Tlamus writ two thoufand years fince, Vzntm jam fectinduseft, cape mo do Verforiam, The wind being fair fteer your courle, feems applicable ^ for the molt judicious rather think the Tackling or Sail by which the Veffel was to be turned is meant by that diredion. Neverthelefs, that thofe parts abound with Loadftones is well known, feeing the King of Zeyloon ufed them as others do For- cellane: being in fuch plenty, that fome have from their attradive property marvelled how Ihips could pafs with large Anchors and iron Sakers j and no lefs, that there is no greater increafe of variation, as Pliny and Serapion have imagined. For confutation of which we need no other example than that of Elba an Ifle in the Thufcan Sea where ftore of Magnets, and but little variation are found or obferved. But to return. Forafmuch as facred Writ inftrud us That Ophyr and the reft of Joktan's Sons ( upon that memorable divifion of the Earth which happened in the dayes of Peleg Brother of Joktan Sons of EberJ had their partition or lot alfigned them in the Orient, viz.. from Mejha unto Sepher, without further argument that ferves to confute thofe fpeculations of Colnmbm, Manrm and Stephanas as to the pretended difcoveries of place in contrary quar ters of the World. And in anfwer to Goropms alfo concerning Peru, by reafon of the affinity it has with the word Peruaym, that criticifm will not avail, feeing'there are Towns in Syam and the neighbourhood of Malacca now called Pern and Perna which better pre^ ferve the memory of old Peruaym ; albeit, if I may be allow'd the like liberty, the Ifle Ta- probane feems moft to Ihaddow it, being according to the Tranflation of Junius zn&amp;Tre- mellius from the Original writ Taprouaym and T* aperuaym-, words that have very little dif- cordance with Peruaym by which is underftood Ophyr. But that Taprobane is an Ifland under or near the iEquinodial is agreed by all, although fome difference there be Whe ther Sumatra or Zeyloon be it, Mercator's judgement being for Sumatra, and Ortelius for Zeyloon : howbeit, moft incline to Sumatra, both for that it is neareft the Continent and confequently the more eafily difcovered by Onefecritus Alexanders Vice-Admiral (who wanting the ufe of a Compafs doubtlefs crept as near the Ihore as well he might) and for that ftore of Gold has both of old and yet is obtained at Sumatra more than in ZeyU whence it was called Infula by the Ancients. That great and learned Expofitor St, Hierom likewife in his Paraphrafe upon 1 Kings 22. 48. where it is writ That Jehofhaphat made fliips of Tarjhijh to fail to Ophyr for Gold but broken in pieces at Buon-geber, the Lord difapproving his defign •, from the word Tarjhijh infers That Ophyr eft locus India, in quo Aurum optimum nafcitur, Ophyr is a place in India where is the pureft Gold. And in another place, Regio necejjario pofita eft in Orientalllndia, Ophyr is without all doubt in the Baft-Indies. Of the fame judgement is Tz.etz.a, The Golden Indian Ifle by Poets fung, A Pen-infule fome call it and no Ifte • The Hebrews name it Ophyr in their Tongue: All forts of Stones and Mines of Gold e're-while Are found there, [with the choiceft Prafine-S^wfr A Stone of price, abounding in the Prafians Countrey faith Pliny lib. 6. cap. 18. from the name refembled to a Leek though probably the Emerald, for it was of a greenilh co lour. But the Countrey it felf is moft famoufed for that refiftance the Citizens of Pa- libotra made againft Bacchus. And albeit by fome it be more ftridly confined to BengaU and that part, yet Strabo gives it a greater extent Totum maritimum traftum ab Indo ad Gangem Prafiam appellant, calling all that Coaft Praft a which lies betwixt Indus and Can- Zes. So as albeit the Infula Aurea be by Ptolomy and others placed here, yet the Aared Terra InfuET eft Indica quam Peetae Aurcam vocan^ Alii vero peninfulam, &amp; non InfuJam.

Terra and the Aurea Cherfonefas is not fo well agreed upon: For Jofephns by Aurea Terra intends Ophyr, and by that general confequently comprehends all thole Regions that verge Eafterly from the River Indus) feeing all that Oriental part of the World even from Indus to Polifanga (if fuch a River be not feigned) and molt Iflands from the Maldim Inftila to Japan more or lefs have Gold: India abmdat Auro, Plin. lib. 6. Which if fo, I do not know by what Authority Varrerim confines that metal to Vegu and Sumatra^ main taining That no other place in the Eafi-Indies produces Gold on either fide the River Ganges: His words are thele, Citra &amp; ultra Gangem nulla pars IndU fit qua Aurumgignat prxter Veguam &amp; Sumatram. An Hypothefis found miftaken by fuch as drive a Trade for Gold in thofe maritime parts that verge towards Cochin-china: Upon which confideration it is (as I fuppofe) that Mercator ftretches Aurea Cherfonefm from Sumatra to Japan^ both in reference to the Ifles and Coaft Maritimate; too great a fpace donbtlefs and diiagree- ing with a Pen-infule: therefore upon better grounds it may be reduced to a lefs, as of late fome have confined it to Mallabary albeit Ptolomy and Niger place it about Malacca, Joor and parts thereabouts. But Solinus converting the fpecies calls it Argyra, which Pompon. Mela lib. 3. cap. 8- feems to reconcile. Ad Tamum enim India promontorium eji In sula Chryfa ad Gangem Argyra, &amp;c. by that Promontory meaning either Gape Comryn or that other which ihoots into the Sea and becomes an equal boundary to the two Straits of Sunda and Malacca. And by Pliny lib.6. c. 21. Extra Ojiium Indi Chryfa &amp; Argyra fer- tilis met alii s *, fed quod aliqui tradunt Aurum &amp; Argentum cum eis folum effe, baud facile credide- rim. By which that Author places it nearer Indus than Ganges. But that Ophyr was at and a- bout Malacca-, at leaft in fome contiguous maritime part of Baft-India , and that Joktan with all, or moft of his Sons planted in the Eafl-Indies rather than in Arabia,and that their Colonies though difperfed for better accommodation were in the voicinage of one ano ther, will appear by the continuation of the Names of the principal Planters as may be imagined, yea proved by what is this day extant notwithftanding the alteration of Names and change of Language that unavoidably hath hapned. And firlt concerning Mejha and Mount Sepher: That their ftation was thereabout, has been the conftant opinion of moll ^ until of late a modern Writer finding Mejha the Son of Aram Son of Shem in Mefopotamia, thence imagines thofe places are to be underllood to be in that Countrey: but that Gountrey being neither Eaft from Shinaar nor the Ara bian Defert, that conjecture is not forcible. Another finds it in Arabia Felix upon that old miftake in not diftinguilhing the Plantation of Havilah the defcendant of Cham from that other of Havilah who defcended from Shem: which errour alfo mif-led the Septua- gint, by the River Gihon (a branch of Euphrates) underftanding Ganges. But Ptolomy with better confideration finds it in Eaft-India, calls it Mons Mauus, and places it under 36 degr. Nefas mons eft India, Plin. /. 20. notwithftanding all that large trad the fame Geo grapher extends from the Promontory Manancomum to Sabanna being above 100 leagues is by Strabo termed Terra Muficani or Mefhicani as fome write it. Nor is Sepher that noted Mountain in the Eaft at this day utterly forgotten*, feeing fome there be who find Sopha there-, as alfo Syba and Sypha, which differ but little from the ancient Name it bore, or from the latitude allowed Mons Mateus or Nifaus, where India begins and gives Paropa-Nyfa its Name as fome call it, but more truly Paropa-Mifa, from Mount and out of which (it is fuppofed) Ganges fprings: albeit in the Eafterly part of Aria another Sypha is known of late to the Eaft of Maz.eus v whole di* ftance may be lalved by that of Caucafus which keeps its Name a vaft diftance and through leveral Pvegions: but helps that fuppofition^, for he takes the great Mountain Bellagate (which in that Dialed fignifies a high Mountain) to be Sepher, albeit Bellagau branches from Imaus, and in a continued ledge of fpiring Hills pierces through the heart of Induftan, Decan and the Narfingan Countreys in the middle betwixt the Gulph of Ben- gala and the Indian Ocean uninterruptedly as far as Cape Comryn, not unlike the Appen- nine, which in a chain of Hills cuts quite through Italy. And concerning it Saint Jerome vouches That Saphyra^ ( as he calls Sepher J Mons eft Orientis in India, juxta quem, fllii JoBan habitaverunt, Sepher is a Mountain in the Eaft-Indies, near which, the Sons of Joktan in habited. Quos a Cophene ftuyio &amp; Regione India ufq', ad ipfam Seriam occupaffent, (faith Jo- fephus) By which the Seres is underftood, and in which was Mons Sepher: Arrhian calls itPyrrhm, Ptolomy Bepirrhm, and Mercator Sepirrhut. But this Cophene or Sophene muft be chitinguirned from that Sophena which is in Cilicia upon the Armenian Confines that Eu phrates waters. Sub Bafilifewa, inter Antitaurum &amp; Mafium montes, jacetSophena, inquadam convalle, cujus Metropolis eft Carcathiocerta: an error that has mifguided fome Writers-, for, Cophen Regie &amp; fluvius eft India, faith Mela i.lib.q. &amp;c. and Pliny l. 6. r. 23 .So that tis very ftrange, any would have Sepher to be the Andes in America, as I lately mentioned. &gt; Concerniiig *4 Concerning their feveral Plantations, it may warrantably be fuppofed That the Father of thofe thirteen Sons mentioned in Gen. 10. 26. feated himfelf fomewhere near the River Ganges: the rather, for that it is granted % fome and thofe not the leaft learn ed, that Noab heforeNmrod and his alTociates removed Welt ward towards fixed his Quarters fomewhere in Mergiam or upon the banks of Indus, that being the richeft foil i and the firft choice was doubtlefs aliow'd him, both in the relation he ftood,as upon the account of Seniority. Thence it is, in fome Authors we find that River called Joktan, and alternately, Joktan called by the name of Ganges. Now the Father having made his Eledion, the Sons in all probability difperfed themlelves about in contiguous places*, foas to continue a neighbourhood, both for their better alfociation and prefervation ; and accordingly by an eafie inquifition we find the feveral Plantations of Oyhyr, Havilah, Hadoramy Ahimael-, Obal, Elmo dad ^ Jerah and Sheba, eight of the Sons of Joktan origi nally feated on either fide Ganges: for thofe Nations the Ancients called the Orites per a* pharejin the Ophyrites and the Tapiri, which fome who take a little liberty to pleafe their fancy without much torture of the word write Tophiri, were Inhabitants intra Gangem, and in good meafure preferve the memory of Ophyr their originary Planter, who either removed or extended his dwelling towards Malacca and that maritime Coalt which is ex tra Gangem, may be acknowledged ^ feeing it is the belief of fome, both in regard lacca is a Cherfonefi, and that it has its fcituation upon the Sea ^ but principally for that in all Ages there and in the neighbouring Ides plenty of Gold, Ivory and Ebony (which was moil likely to be the Almuggim wood, feeing it was ufed for the garnifliing and trimming the Stairs and Pillar? of the Temple, and there was none fuch feen before in the Land of Jndah, which excludes Cyprefs and Cedar wood of which there was plenty, but of Ebony no where but in India if we credit rirgilJ and in regard that Apes,Peacocks and precious Stones, &amp;c. have at all times been had there, it is the more credible that Ophyr was in that part of the World placed. For the Name Malacca is but new fay fome, being called Beitan when the Siamites firft made their Plantation; and yet was called Malacca in Strabo's dayes, zndStrabo li^ed in the reign of Tiberius Cafar, for he reports in his Geogr. That Malacca falfamentis abmdatj&amp;c. and varied from Tacola as I find mentioned in fome Authors •, and more particularly by Plutarch vita Alex, where the People of that place are called Tax Hi or Tajhili, they, who with the Sabai were adive for the defence of their liberties upon the Greeks threatned invafion. After which it was named Malaga, where Geographers of old placed the Aurea Cherfonefus \ and after that Maleicola, which with little alteration was contraded to Malacca, in which Name it now refteth^ and is the better demonftrated, for that the River which ferves that Town was called Gaza, a proper Name where Gold is hoarded, and holds the Name in part as yet; and upon thofe banks it was, that noted City Bariga^a in feventeen degrees was built, whofe foundation was laid by the A- ratrii by fome thought the Oriti lately mentioned who firft inhabited the Gedrofan Ter ritory near Cambaya upon the Eaftern banks of the River Indus, So that upon the whole matter, Malacca and the adjacent parts and Ifles may warrantably be conclu ded the place which in old times was called Ophyr: the Gold had at that particular place, and from the Neighbouring Iflands, came likewife under that ^general deno mination. Moreover, to trace the foot-fteps of the other Sons of Joktan : In Tegu we find the memory of Havilah ; feeing part of that Countrey now called Barma and Brama but of old Bracmanorum Regio, is at this day called Chava and Chavilah, the People EviUi and ChainUi, and a contiguous Principality late a feudatory to the Crown of Pegu and fince to Tangu is called Ava , which apparently continue the memory of Havilah Bro ther Ophyr. Of Hadoram the Aramei or Aramiu in the Gumrat Province are de- fcended. Of Abimael, i. e. Pater Mallorum, thofe that planted the Coaft of Malla- bar', thole alio inhabiting Malua a Province in InduHan and the Malli noted by Plu tarch to live thereabouts*, for fo were thofe called of old: and at this day his Name is continued by fome confiderable Towns upon that Coaft,as Maliba and Maleta all or fome of which in all likelihood from Abimael deduce their Original. Of Obal are the Obalites and the Ah elites: mentioned by Hiftorians and placed about Ganges. From Elmodamthe Emo- dian Mountain takes Name,may be fuppofed without much ftraining. But concerning Jerah, albeit they df jearoon near Larr pretended fome intereft in that Name, as I mentioned at that place;, upon better view I may difcover his V'eftigia near Malacca amongft his other Bre thren, feeing the Town and Province of Jor or Jehor zndjoor (as fome pronounce) preferves his Name in that part of Siam which confines Malacca and affronts the Itte Sumatra to the Eaft: for I likewife find that Countrey called Jeria of old, part of which was watered by the River Cophen-, not that of the fame name which runs into the River Indus ; yea^y the names Ophyr.names of Seria and Stria (doubtlefs miftaken by the Amanuenfis or in the tranfcript) danced at by fofephus. And as to the laft of the Sons of Jektan named Sheba, here are fufficient remains both from the Syha and the Sabxi, who in confederacy with the TacoU lately mentioned gave fome ftop to the Macedonian torrent: Sahai in India accoU Dion. Verica, alfo from that River which ftreams not far from Joor through the Malaccan Territories ihtb the Ocean; and from that Promontory likewife which thrufts its head in to the fait water ne^Smapm-a, Ptolomy and others of old called Magnum. The Kingdom of Syam withal was heretofore termed Sab anna Kegio, as attefted by Strabo in his defini tion of the Terra Muficani: and not many leagues from Malacca there is at this day a Town fo named. Dionyfuu alfo in his Vcriegefis makes Sabalajfa one of the Oftia of the Ri ver Ganges. , Now albeit thjs eilay may ferve to point out Ophyr, yet feeing Tharjijh is an adjund with Ophyr, and a word admitting a various fignification, it will not be loft labour to difcufs it a little, being a term that by curious pens has been no lefs argued than Ophyr. But by a parenthefis firft accept the defcription of what has been the fubjed of this dill qnifition, Gold', difcovered very rarely, for that the Akraria run not in Mines and Veins lb apparently and fo plentifully as Silver, and feldom (as Silver) wrought in the Myne, but for the moll part hid and undifcovered till found in (hallow Brooks and Rivo- lets near unto Mountains, ufually after ftorms and rains, fometimes in duft and powder, but at other times in grains, which for bignefs and fhape referable Melon-feeds^ which fort is molt pure and needs leaft refining. For the quality or nature of it is fuch, as ex ceeds Silver twelve times in value : fo pure, as it is not fubjed to ruft-, and fofolid, as .endures Age and Fire above other Metals: yea, moit improveable in its produd', for Pliny lib. z 7 )-cap- 3. obferv'es, That one ounce may well be beaten with the Hammer into feven hundred leaves, every leaf being four fingers broad and the length proportionable. In Africa and Afia is ftore of this precious Earth: fo much being imported by David and Solomon (as provifion for the Temple) that 'tis mentioned in 2 Chron. 9. 22. Solomon 'excelled all the Kings of the Earth in riches and wifdom : for Silver was there as plente ous as Stones, and Cedars as the Fig-trees that grow abundantly in the plains. And from thofetwo parts of the world much more Gold is brought into Europe (where the leail quantity is concoded) than from America '•&gt; albeit of Silver-ore America yields more thanAfiktl, and put together. And yet I have not heard of any lump of Gold thence fo great as OwWd reports he faw in America ■, one of which was an entire grain or piece of Gold of feven pound weight, valuing feven hundred Pezo's ^ a Pezo is thir teen Ryals: the other was five pound weight. Peter alfo faw an Ingot there that weighed 3 3,19 Pezoes entire of it feif without any artificial addition. A rarity fit to be prefented the Portugal King v to whom it was accordingly carried in the Boadilla, but mif- carried by tempeft. Now cOneerning the word Tharjijh, fomuch criticiz'd, it is Verbum ambigmm and ad mits a various fence : For, fometimes it iignifies a City other-fome a Region: as alfo the Chryfoliteor Sea-Beryl a precious ftone of the colour of the Sea : but at fome time the Sea it felf,as may be gathered. That there was a City fo called in Cilicia appears by that of the Prophet J&lt;w^,who being fent by theAlmighty to admonifh Ninive took a contrary way, and at Joypa fhipped himfelf for Tarjhijh ; of which City Sp. Paul the Apoftle was a Native, A$s 22. 3. The Name is probably deduced from Tharjis the Son of Javan, Gen. 10.4. who in the dayesof Peleg planted in that part of the lelfer ^2 which the TW*%atthis day call Ham^a. But whereas Tarjhijh is mentioned in iReg. 10,22. and in 2 Chron.9.2 1. that Solomons fhips went to with/^r^w's Servants*, every year once came the fhipsof Tarjhijh bringing Gold,and Silver,and Ivory,feeing Gold in the 10. verfe of that Chap, is called Gold of Ophyr^mth. lubmilfion, the word Tharfijh there may fignifie the Sea. For it appears by the 1 Reg.y. 26. that King Solomon built his Navy at Eziongeber which failed to Ophyr. So as albeit 'tis ftiled the Navy of Tharfijh and Hyrams Navy, 'tis probable thole two neighbour Princes were concerned in the returns of that Voyage', the Phoenicians at that time being more expert Sea-menthan the Jews- Notwithftanding which, that thofe Ihips were either riding in the Mediterranean or upon the Nile^ unlefs brought over by fledge from Coptos or Pelufmrn as Cleopatra's was,is very impr obable: For othdrwife it will be faid thofe Navies went to Ca~ dity which place at that time being called Tartejhm^ Pineda fancies were Veflels belonging thereunto : otherwife, ^paiTmg that Streight they failed through the Atlantic, and doubl ing Cape Bona Sferanta made that their way into the Red fea, as fome have con ceited.But a vain conception it is,feeing the Scripture in exprefs terms acquaints us,That the Navies were built at Ez.iongeber near upon the fliore of the Red fea: foas had Ophyr been in any part in or near the Mid-land Sea,or come from Tarfijh in Cilicia, then the voyage might Cjold of Ophyr.Tharjhijh* might have been accomplilhed in far lefs time than three years, feeing that Tarfifr was not above a weeks fail from J of pa a Port twenty miles Weft from Jerufalem, and not above three dayes fail from Scandroon ( Alexandretta of old) the moft noted Syro-Pnoenician port at the bottom of the Streights. But thofe that think by Tharfijh is meant Ophyr, or elfe that there was fome Countrey in India of that name, are more to ]3e credited. Farther, from 2 Chron. 20. 36. where it is written That Jeholhaphat (hips in Euon~ geher-f which being broken were not able toga to Tharjhijh, fome judge that Tharjhijh there fig- nifies the Sea*, and the rather, for that the word carries it in feveral other places, as noted by feveral learned Expofitors. Saint Hierom is one, who in his Paraphrafe lately mentioned fpeaking otOphyry Locm eft India (fay eshe) in quo Awrum optimum mfcitnr : adds, Tharjhijh vel eft Regie IndU ut mlt Jofephus, vel certe\omne PeUgm Tharjhijh appellatur: JLtenim-i Hebrai Tharfis Mare did generatiter antumant, fecmdpim illnd, in Spiritu vchementi confringat Naves Tharfijh, i. e. Maris. And in his Comment upon the fecond chap. of £%, he al fo faith that Tarjhijh in Hebrew fignifies the Sea. In Efay alfo chap. 2 3. verf. 1. Vlulate naves Tharfijh, is interpreted, Howl ye jhips of the Sea. And in the 6 verfe. Go] over to Tarjhijh in the Vulgar Latine it is Tranfite maria. In like fort the daughter of Tarjhijh is in the 10 verfe tranflated//^ maris. And in Ezekz 27. 12,25. The jhips of Tarjhijh is rendred Naves Maris in that Edition.But by being thus varioufly conftrued,thence it is that by Thar- jhijh fometimes is underftood a Chryfolite, for the colour of that ftonehath a refemblance with the Sea. Howbeit, to find it in an Indian Region, as that great Author I lately named imagines, is paft my undertakingnor am I willing to prefs thefe conjedures any further. Return we therefore to Malacca it felf, where the Pole Artie is elevated five degrees: a City within the Kingdom of Syam^to whofe Scepter it was fubjed until about the year of our Lord 15 08 • when by the Portugal it was forced from Abdal at that time King *, whofe life they alfo very inconfiderately took away, as appeared by a dangerous mutiny foon after hapning in the Town,'which Albuquerq quieted and by Sequyr^s advice was convert ed into a Garrifon: Ithadafufficientnumber of Ordnance planted tofortifie the place, feeing it is reported there was no lefs than three thoufand. Alfo feiiing the Kings Exche quer into his hands, by Inventory then taken fo much minted Coin came to the King of Tortugals particular fhare, albeit but a fifth, as amounted unto two hundred and fifty thoufand Ryals of eight/ But the unexpeded and undeferved death of the King was fo ill refented by the Syam King and the neighbouring Potentates, that by a general combi nation taking the advantage of Albuquerqs abfence they fuddenly appeared in a very great body before the Town and by a defperate ftorm maftered both City and Cittadel j the King very generoufly giving the Portugals leave to fhip themfelves away, but withal commanding the Works they had made to be forthwith flighted. Howbeit,fome few years after it was reduced under the Crown of Portugal, and fo continued until lately it hath been wrefted from them by the Hollander ; whofe Plantations are fcattered through thofe parts and Naval power fo increaft by the incouragment of that rich Indian commerce as hath ren dred that induftrious Nation very formidable, and which indeed hath given them wel- nighthe dominion of thofe Seas, and the opportunity ofingroffingto themielvesnot on- ly the Molucca-Ifles but in a fort the fole Traffick of the Orient , to their exceeding great advantage, but prejudice of many others •, yea more efpecially to the damage and dimi nution of the Englifh trade and reputation in thofe parts*, for which we are juftly to be reprehended; and imputable to our want of equal induitry, or negled of appropriating to our felves fome convenient places for Plantation and increafe of Men as well as Mer chandize, according to that example the Portugal and Dutch have both given ; who by that means have made themfelves Lords of all or moft of the maritim parts of the Weit and South coaft of Afric and Afta the great, and in a manner now give Law to the great- eft part of thofe indefenfive people, who though they want no will, want power to ob viate thofe intrufions. Whereas the Englijh by a joint ftock and feled Company content themfelves in managing their Fadories under the fuperintendence and inlpedion ofPre- fidens and Agents, who it cannot be denied live both in India and Perfia with fplendor and reputation, and make frequent and confiderable returns unto their Matters : Neverthe- lefs, by living wholly amongft Mahometans and Gentiles, they are doubtlefs under ftrong temptations to wantonnefs with thofe black beauties *, and having their conftcait refidence in places where men exercife Authority and HeatheniihSuperftition and Idola try ^our men are under a conftant offence to leeGod di{honoured,and have not that protecti on and indulgence they exped and merit, feeing that many times they are fubjeded to the caufelefs bravadoes of the Military,as alfo to the craft of the Civil fort ot Indians ^and upon Height caule and falfe information have too often been expofedto the rapine and arbi- Zz 2 trarytt ary difpofition of thofe Infidels •, who of late times ( if report fay true ) havcbeen known to caft our Merchants into prifon, where they have been fettered inchains, and not fet at liberty without confiderable fums extorted from them^ and all this without any juft caufe or provocation: which affronts would have been avoided had our Eaft- India Company fixed Plantations in fome fecure places either upon Ifles or Sea Coaft there, where Men might exercife their Religion with more freedom and purity, and with more fecurity to their Perfons and Eftates than poffibly can be expected in the moving Eadories they onely for fome tiipe are Prefident. The Partial found it fo when they had Ormus, Goa and Gallicut j and the Dutch no lefs by their commanding in Gocheen, Ma lacca and facatra, they now call JBatavia, a moft confiderable Port and kept all along in defpight of the numerous and refolute Javans. Upon which confiderations I have fome- . times thought That if but one half of thofe EngUft which have removed into the Caribt Ifles and planted Colonies in Virginia* New-England and other parts of Norumhega in the Weft-Indiesyhzd. (if the Royal Authority held fit) been imploy'd upon Plantations in Eafl- India, Madagascary Mauritius or other fit places, that defign in all probability would in far lefs time have made another kind of produd, both as to command by Land, and power by Sea, enlargement of Trade, and propagation of the Gofpel: the' Oriental Countreys being fuperlative to the Occident in reference to all forts of mechanick Arts, and alio to a more valuable Commerce in Jewels, Gold, Silks, Spices and Drugs than America: In Orient e omnia fnaviora funt &amp; major a quam in Occident e : Orient ales enim par tes calidiores funt OccidentalibuSy qmniam Aromata jinguli generis &amp; odores &amp; delicias veluti o- mneSj in illis nafci videamm: in Occidente qui firigidior eft minime nafeuntur: Vicomercat. in Meteor. Ariftot. &amp; Olympiodorm Uh' i- And the Eaft being over-fpread with grofs Gen- tilifm gives no lefs invitation for the preaching of the Gofpel and refcuing thofe poor Wretches out of Satans tyranny than any part of the New-found-World j which is and ought to be the chief end of all fuch generous and publick undertakings. And this in all likelihood might have been compafled by fuch a number (for as 1 apprehend, there are in our Weftern Plantations double the number of Portugal and Dutch now extant in the Eafl Indies) and by Perfons of fuch ingenuity and fo good a purfeas might advance the honour of our Nation, Growth of Trade and feveral other publique advantages. But to return, Malacca is a Port of good account, whether we confider her ftrength or Trade; albeit by reafon the Land is low where'tis fcituate, it is not reputed healthy. The Town in fhape is rather long than round ; extending almoft two Engli/h miles in length, but not half fo much in breadth: The Buildings are low and ordinary, and the Streets nar row, the Buzzar being the onely place that has^any thing either beautiful or pleafurable* It is watered by the Gaza (upon whofe banks Bangaz.a ftood of old) formerly called Ma- notas: fufficiently deep and broad three leagues near the Sea *, yet admitting a Bridge here, which makes the Inhabitants on either fide able without' Boats to communicate with each other. For its better defence it has a Caftle well ftored with Cannon, and a wall about reafonably Hankered and better by a late Graff and Counterfcarp. The Sia- mites who were banifht from their own homes feated themfelves here, and being civil and induftrious, Merchants from moll parts of the Eaft reforted to them for Trade ; fo as in fhort'time they became wealthy and confiderable; after which they built the Town more large and beautiful than was intended at their firft Plantation. .The Gardens and Fields abound with fruits amongft which the Duroy en is principal and the Pine-apple *, albeit they want not Corn or grain of feveral forts*, for the Land being low and the foil fat, gives the Labourer fufficient encouragement. Neverthelefs, being fo near the ^Equinox the air is ufually warm, and at fome time above meafure, fo that the Solis Oftia are here placed. Here is frequent thunder, but qualified by the long nights, and frequent fhowrs . and breezes. They obferve here that the Monzoones blow Weft and North-weft from Auguft to Oftoher •, about which month the wind veers North, and continues fo, and to the Eailward of the North until March be ended: at which time the wind turns South, and holds there until the beginning of Auguft. The Indians are numerous hereabouts i the better fort wear rich Apparel, but the commoners go moft part naked: They are generally witty and hofpitable*, love Mufick and novelties: civil in peace, fierce in war^ deceitful if too much credited. Their Language is of great extent ^ no lefs there than in the W orld elfewhere are the Latine and Arahick^ Sincapura divides this Continent from Sumatra, being fcarce half a degr. to the North of the TEquinodial, and the moft Southerly Cape of the Aftan Continent: it was a Town of confiderableTrade with the Chinefesy la- vans, Sumatrans and People of other Ifles thereabouts, until Malacca fozwthe Commerce irom thence 5 by whofe growth Sincapura became impoverifhed: The fretum fo narrow asTatania. Syam, as a mufquet will reach over, and by reafon of Rocks very dangerous for pairenger^^W my calls it Similta, but Sinticora Caflaldm. Hence to Vatania is not above twelve hours travel. Ttolomy calls^that place Potmra Caftaldm Balanga, others Ferimula : but all agree it is in the Gulph of Bengala which of old was named 5^ Argaricm extra Gangem. There the Artie Pole is elevated feven de grees : A Town it is fcituated betwixt A/Ulacca and 5/^-, of good trade by reafon of the commodities it affords, which attrads Merchants: Under Regal Government: for the Princes derive themfelves from one Gingu Son and Pro-rex to the King of Belly y here fubftituted when VatmU was fubjeded. The Mogul his great neighbour has oft threat- ned to dethrone him, yet he keeps hisown being fafe-guarded by interpofing GanvesTuA fome fmall but ufeful Wets where he advantageoufly fortifies. The Town is by fcituation ftrong, and by twelve pieces of great Brafs Ordnance better ilrengthened; one of which our men call a Bafilifco being twenty fix foot long and well proportioned both in bore and fquaring. Some Temples of Idolatry here as in Joor its neighbour are feen : but of better note are thofe ancient Monuments of fome of their Kings who are there buried. The people are black, and by reafon of the heat ftiew moll part of their body naked* Great delight they take in chawing Betele and Opium, Arae (or ftrong liquor) they alfo drink exceedingly : The better fort ufually eat in thin plates of Gold, others in Porcel- lane. The people ufually fpeak three Languages, the MaUi^xs Syam and that of China: but their writing differs , for the Malai write from the right hand to the left as the He brews ufe the Syam from the left unto the right as we 5 but the China down-right or per pendicular : all three ufual, and no lefs ufeful to thofe that traffique there. They are a mixture of Mahometans and Gentiles: the one fo worlhip God, as the other do their Pa God j both erroneoufly. Hofpitable they are to fuch as from defire of no velty or gain refide amongft them, and enquire not much of their Country, bufinefs or Religion : but fo addid to Vice that Strangers who thither come as Travellers or Mer chants, have extraordinary need to pray for grace to refift Female temptations •, and to remember that truth the Poet mentions^ Tarva voluntatis quanquam fmt gandia, tonga Vosna tamen fequitur, mifero per mixta dolor e. The French alfo, who are as amorous as others, have experimentally given us this cau tionary leilbn: From Women light and liqiiorousj' De Femme volage &amp; friande. Jit all times God deliver us, - En tout' temps Dieu nous defende. For afluredly, the cuftom as well as the heat, in moil places of thefe etherique Regions, incline and allure men, efpecially Strangers, to lubricity and debauched courles •, Oh I mi- [emm cui peccare liceat ; fuch as if grace does not reftrain have reafon to take heed of punilhment, feeing Adultery they neverthelefs punifh. Howbeit^ the young Women arc carelefly frolick and fearlefly merry •, the married melancholy, becaufe ftridly ob- ferved. Idlenefs and heat provokes them, fo as they wallow in all manner of turpitude: The Grape moves them they fay to wickednefs; for they delight their guft and pallat with choiceft Wines, Waters, Arac, Rice and fruits: but by this their interrlperance abbreviate their dayes, fo as fixty years is accounted an old age, which if you contem plate their excefs ( Deaths Harbinger ) and the Zone they fweat in, may well be granted. Adjoining this is S Y A M ( Sab anna and Cortatha of old, a City and Kingdom fo named,declining North from the ./Equinodial 14 degrees) a great and famous part of India, having Patania to the South, to the Weft Pegu and part of the Bengalan Gulph *, Joor, Malacca, a great part of Pegiiy Brama and Camhogia were tributary to him *, Patania alfo, famohay, Odjea and other Territories watered by Ganges acknowledge him: fo as his power is large, and well known that within the memory of Man he was able to bring into the Field five hundred Elephants and two hundred thoufand fighting Men armed with good Swords, Bows and Arrows, Shield and Lance. The King pretends to a large Race of Kingly progenitors. The Zone is hot, which makes the Men black, and in ftich places dittle cloathing is re- quifite*, ib that they content themlelves with a Cambolin of Lawn of a lad colour which is trebled about their fhoulders: Howbeit, fome tie a leather skin about their neckv and as a badge of devotion gird their middles with a thong, and hold a Sumbrero in their hands to abate the heat, but wear no fandals both that the fcorehing fands may mortifie^ 58 Siam.

Now albeit liberty- be allow'd Chriftisyis, Moors and other fuperftitions, neverthelefs the Natives are tran- fcendent Idolaters? carving their Deities after the ftiapes of Van and Priapm with other goatilh fancies; yea in poftures not fit to be remembred. They have Groves and Altars alio whereon they offer flefh,fruits,flowers v and many times when the Tallapoi tell them their Demo is melancholy, they warble out harmonious mufick, and do what they canto make him chearful. Others by break of day run to their Pagods with a basket of Rice,hoping that day will be happier. The Kings of Arrachan, Tamjfery, Syam, Pegu, Ahva and Tangu are all Gentiles,' and have their Temples ftuffed with Pagods. The T'allafoi preach ufually every Monday (their Sabbath)in the Market, andaifemble their Auditory by the found of a copper Bafon. Thefe feem Mendicants by profeffion: yet what by awe, for as fome fay the very infernal Spirits obey their incantations ^ and what by policy, for they contemplate humility externally very much, the People have them in high eftimation: By their predidion of future events, and marvellous knowledge in things paft and prefent *, by magick and moral obfervation^refolving, diffwading, applaud ing, direding and delighting fuch as credit them * 7 and credit them molt of thofe Bthnicb do, they are in great efteem, as believing them Interpres Divum, Qui Numina Phosbi, Of gods Interpreters and Phoebus lays.

And for the People, as report goes,, they have been deteftable Sodomites a lin fo hateful to Nature as not to be named *, for as an unnatural uncleannefs it abhors it: now to deter thele Catamites, a late Queen Redrix prudently commanded that all the male-Children fhould have a Bell of gold in which .was an Adders-tongue dried put through their prepuce^ which by cultom took away*the contempt, and be came their ornament j fo that at this day fome will exceed, and not unlike the Chori* hantes of old, have three or four of thofe Bells, pendent. But when they have a mind to marry, the Mid-wife prefents a fbporiferous potion, during whole operation the Bell is loofed^om the fielh and faftened to the fore-skin, and the unguent being ap plied the cur?is quickly perfeded. This pradice and other the uncomely habit and lafcivious pradices of the Women there, Cafar Frederic obferves in his Travels % as alfo Mr. Fitch a London Merchant, Antonio Gahano and others: and how incredible foever it feems to fome, I fuppofe there are both in London and other-parts of Merchants and Sea-men who have been in thofe parts, and feen what I have here related. Here Sedge and Palmeto-leaves are ufed for paper. The ufual place of refidence for the King is at Indy, a Town Icituated within an Ifle compaifed well-nigh with the Menan: His Palace is large, pretty well built, and held te nable. Howbeit moil other Houfes are low and mean, the Streets narrow *, but avail able to keep out the extreme heat which at fome times rages. Thofe of the Coaft of Chormandel the one way, and the Chynefes the other traffique hither with Sattens, Pored- lanes and other rich Commodities, which makes the place the more noted. The Boyes oft-times paint themfelves with a celeftial colour from top to toe, and as an augmenta tion of beauty cut, gafh and pink their skins, which they apprehend to be a noble and in genious ornament: but to us rather bred horrour than affedation. The Men affed per fumes and pradife complement. The foil, notwithHanding the River Menam, is but indifferent for Grafs ^ but uberous in rich Stones, as Diamonds, Chryfolites, Onyx, Magnets and Bezoars: it hath plenty of Lignum Aloes-, Benjamin and Cotton : it hath alfo Mines of Iron and Copper ^ there is Gold and Silver alfq, which caufes Ptol. to call it aurea regio, and anrea continens, Orteliut. Silver is plentifully brought thither from Japan, but Viduals and like commodities they have abundantly from other parts •, which is the realbn that they are bought here cheaper than in many other places. Amongft Stones, moft memorable is the Cabriz or Blood- Itone here generated ; the marvellous vertue whereof is fuch as Oforim tells us,That when the Portuguez. had War with the Sumatrans, onetime they defcried a Junk at Sea, which alter fome refiilance was boarded by Nahodabeg the Captain : but after a long and fmart nght, the armed Pormguez, entring among the naked Indians, put to the Sword all that begg d not quarter. Amongft others Nahodabeg himfelf, who bled not albeit they had ilalnt and wounded him in fundry places. They were amazed at the fight and thought it magical ; till having taken from his arm a Bracelet of Gold wherein was fet the Cabriz- itone, the reafon then appeared; for that was no fooner removed, but blood ilfued abun dantlyT^- dantly from every wound he had. Doubtiefs this is the beft Blood-ftone in the World • and could it prevent wounding as well as ftaunch blood,might worthily bp ranked amon^fb Stones moft precious. The Beaft out of which this Cabriz-ftone is taken is called Gaball. The Chinefes refiding at Bantam are beft acquainted with him : albeit fome fay that in Syam and the Java he is feen the oftneft. Adjoining this is PEGU, Left arum Kegio in Ptolomy * ? confined by Syam, Ganges, and the Ocean •, a Mo narchy of greater extent fifty years ago, and till the Syamite plucked forceably from that ' Crown feveral great and wealthy Seigniories: Howbeit, fhe is yet Commandrefs of many large Territories and Iflands, as Monym, Baron'go, Nogomallo, BHradura, Cocos, and others. By Caflaldm it is fuppofed. to be that old Trigliyton or Trigliyhon which is mentioned in ptolomy, and by him placed under 18 degrees : the Braman Metropolis, and has Artie elevation 16 degrees 40 minutes. The City is walled with Stone, beautified with Tur rets, and to iffiie out and in fhews four fair Gates, and thrice that number of Pofterns: but made molt defenfiveby a deep Graff that compaffes her: fo large and deep, and has fuch entercourfe with the Sea that Crocodiles are many times feen to fwim there. The llreets are not many; but thofe that be are large and broad (which is rare in hot Coun try s) and feldome crooking. Afore moft Doors grow Trees, whofe fruit and fhade make them ufeful and acceptable. It is divided into the new and old : the old is greateft, and beft inhabited. The Country is now very bare in Wood, albeit in old times it abounded with Timber of great height, of which, Virgil in his 2 lib.Georg, feems to have fome knowledge: Of thofe great Woods in th? utmofl Ind ia bred.

For near the River Hyrotis (faith an Hiftorian) grew Trees fo exceeding high, as their meridional fhadows extend five furlongs, which exprefs a due temperament of heat and moifture: But that thefe are is evident by their Varella's, which are obfervable ; for moft of their Varella's are ftuffed with ugly Idols. That at Dogomee, the moft remarkable for ftrudUre without and ornament within , outbraving any other in the Orient: the Wildernefs or Garden about it and fuperftition there ufed are fo ft range as might very well challenge a large defcription. This Kingdom abounds with moft forts of Natures bleffings; for here is ftore of Gold;, Silver, Lead, andiron^ alfo Smaragds, Topazes, Rubies, Saphyres, Garnats, Eme ralds, Efpinels, and Cats-eyes: as alfo plenty of Rice, Caravances, long Pepper, Sugar, Benoyn, Musk, Lac, a Gum prepared in like fort as Bees do Wax, and of which our beft fealing Wax is made •, Bamboo, Cotton, and Callicoes; But all thefe if they were centupled are not able to make them happy, wanting the true Pearl, that which the god ly Merchant bought, though to obtain it he fold all his frail pofTelfions : For albeit the holy Apoftle Saint Thomas brought them tidings of falvation •, yet they love Darknefs more than Light, delighting at this day in obfeure and loathed fins, and the Kyacks are filled with filthy Idols: infomuch that Bomferrmzn oldFrancifcan after four tedious years labour to reduce them to fbme conformity with the Church of Rome, came home, profef. fing thathehad rather with Saint Anthony preach among Figs than fuch a fwinilh Generati on. The truth is, like thofe mentioned in the 4^ of S. John 22. they believe they know not what *, and Quanam eft ifla fimplicitas nefcire quod credos ? layes Hierom to the Lucife- rians: yet fomewhat, if all be true he tells, is worthy your notice.

They reckon that the iaft de- ftfudion of the World and the death of their laft God was thirty thoufand years ago (in VUto\ great year perhaps •,) and that all fhall once more fuffer a Chaos.

But which was worfe than that, through thefe continued brawls of War his Treafure im paired, hisCities were impoverifhed by want of Trade, and his Kingdom in a lort depo pulated through lofs of fo many men: Which proved not motives of pity with the other lubjeded Provinces, but provocatives rather to unfetter; themfelves as Siam had done; Accordingly the Vice-Roys of Bramaw, Tangu and Rachan confederate: and whiles the King of was contriving new defignsat Martavm enter Vegnmith a deiperate and numerous Army, forraging and deftroying fuch as the late famine had fpared ^ where though they found few people and left food, yet got they riches ineftimable: For, out of the Citf of Pegu they took no lefs treafure than loaded two thoufand Camels; and as a pe riod, not only made the wretched King crownlefs, but crowned their conqueft with the lols of his life, his Wife and three Sons Ibrrowfully accompanying him. This luccefSf was attended with mif-fbrtune of another kind; for the Sovereign of ^Ar- rakarK and the other two dif-agreeing about the dividing that great fpoil, were beaten home by the Bramaan King *, who alio enjoyed it but a while, the Siamite entring fb furi ouflythat the Bremaan was content with a fafe retreat leaving the Siamite vidorious- who iince, upon a marriage 'twixt one of the Royal Family of Pegu and his Daughter has' quit his claim and gives the right Heir leave to re-polfefs both City and Kingdom, which a fliort peace has recovered to little lefs trade and beauty than it had formerly. But to fa cilitate our travel, accept thepreceding Map to that in fol. 336. This defcribing India on the other, fide Ganges.

Medon is upon that River from whence we go to Dela, to Cirion, to Macao, and then come to Pegu. At Coplan are found Hones of price, as Merchants told us.

The Elephant (for growth and underftanding reputed the chiefeft of unreafonable Animals) has been the fubjed of fundry learned Pens *, as of Anftotle, Plutarch, Pliny-, Strabo, Annian and others. Theygo two, fometimes three years with young, and have extreme torment in their labour *, the teat is 'twixt their fore-legs, which the young eafily find and fuck with eagernefs. At three years of age they wean themfelves and fall to other provant, as herbs, boughs of trees, ihrubs, and like vegetables: but when in fervice have more dainty fare, as corn, fruits, roots, fugar-canes, milk, whey, and fuch as may increafe both ftrength and courage. They grow until they be fifteen years old, and are ufually eighteen foot high, butfome of the higheft mount to four and twenty.- Notwithftanding which marvellous greatnefs they are not dull and unweildy but quick and fpirited. They can and ufually do lie down and rife as other Beafts contrary to the report of fome old Writers: foadive notwithftanding their cylindrical form of leg as at Rome in Nero and Galba's time they were taught to dance upon a cable or great rope as we find reported by Suetonius -, and fo full of courage as no ftory gives more commendation to, any beaft than to the Elephant that King Porm fought upon againft; Alexander. And albeit his Tusks and his Probofcis are his beft Weapons,yet can he frame his mighty body as occaiion ferves into offenfive and defenfivepoftures. In rutting time (which is commonly when the feafbn is hotteft)the males are mad, and hardly to be ruled without the femalesxompany. Some confidently report That their tefticles are in or near their fore-head^ which beingaten^ der part is the reafon the Condudor fits upon his head, and with his Iron rod or hook there correds him : Howbeit, Arifiotle places his ftones near his reins.

Sumatra is divided from Java by the Straits of Sunda fo called from the Ides Synda as Magmm imagines ^ but5W^ is better known than the Ifles fo called. J A VA^ Major is an Ifle declining 7 degrees 40 minutes towards the Antartic from the /Equinodial^ and placed in the 120 degree of longitude. A very great and noble Ifle • for, from Eaft to Weft it ftretches one hundred and fifty leagues, or of miles four hun dred and fifty 5 and from North to South ninety leagues, or two hundred and feventy miles Englifli. The mid-land is for the moft part mountainous, and meanly peopled- but the maritim low, and vety populous: the firft is very fubjed to wind, but healthy' the latter marifli, and infalubrious. J. Scaliper calls it a Compendium of the World; for it abounds with all things that be either ufeful or excellent. The coaft (by reafon of Trade for Pepper) has Towns beft built, and moft wealthy: upon the North fide, and to the North-eaft, are Bantam, Palamban, Jackatra (new-named Batavm by the Dutch but formerly Sunda-Calaya by the Inhabitants; and not unlikely to be that City Synda where the people ufed with a dead body to bury fo many live Fifti as in his life time he had flain Enemies,) Japarra, Tub an, Jortan, Grecy, Chyringin, Serehaya, &amp;c. Bantam is under Antartic declination or latitude 6 degrees 20 minutes, and of Wefter- ly variation 3 degrees. Is is the biggeft City in the Ifland, owned by the Natives, and Itretched well-nigh two miles in length: the moft remarkable places being the Penpans Palace, the Buzzar, a few irregular ftreets-, and at the furtheft end the Chynefes there ailociate as do the Jem at Amfterdam, but nothing fo Iplendid. The Town of its own growth affords little fave Rice, Pepper, and Cotton-wool •, albeit Pepper for the great- eit part is brought thither by the infinitely induftrious Chynefes, who each January come to an Anchor in multitudes at this Port, and unload their Junks or Praws from J^vin Sumatra, Borneo, Malacca, and other places*, making their Magazine ^ out of or by exchange for other Commodities they fupply the Enjrlijh, Dutch, ana other Nations. The Chynefes are no quarrellers, albeit voluptuous, venereous, coft- ly in tneir fports, great Gamefters, and in trading too fubtil for young Merchants: oft- times lo wedded to dicing, that after they have loft their whole Eftate, Wife and Chil dren are ftaked*, yet in little time, Jew like, by gleaning here and there are able to re- aeem their lofs •, if not at the day, they are fold in the Market for moft advantage. 1 heme has but one Supreme or Soveraign Prince *, they intitle him the Mattaran: He has tour Tetrarchs or Deputies his Subordinates.

Not unlike what was pradifed by Lewis the eleventh to the Crucifix in his Hat. But withal, thefe Javans are drunk in Demonomy i and the more earneftly embrace it by how much their corrupt natures abhor honefty: whence it happens, that they trade in murder, adultery, theft, ra pine, deceit, and all other wickednefs. Magick alfo and Aftrology delight them •, a ftudy their Priefts are excellent in, and in which Satan 'tis thought inftruds them, the better to oblige their gratitude, and to worlhip him as the Apollo of knowledge: which we may in culcate with that of the Prophet Jfaiah chap.44. Is there any God be fides the Lord (Jehovah ? ) yea, there is no God, we know not any. He maketh the Diviners mad, he tnrneth the wife-men backward, and maketh their knowledge foolijh. And in Jerem, 10.

But in the Lord jhall all true Believers bejuftified, and jhall glory. And to convince thefe, 1 may likewife oppole them with a Heathen informing them, that Etfi Dei populares funt multi, Vnum tamen ejfe naturalem: albeit national Gods there are many, there is but one natural the God of Na ture, Cic.l. 1. de Natura Deorum y and much more with that of the Apoftle Idolum ni hil eft in Mundo.

An Idol is nothing in the World and there is none other God but one: For, though there be that are called Gods, whether in Heaven or Earth (as there be Gods many and Lords many) yet to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him j and one Lord Jefus Chrift, by whom are all things, and we by him, 1 Cor. 8.4. To return. The Natives, till of late, were not acquainted with Navigation: but in the Art of fwira- ming (as moft Negroes) are very excellent. And feeing they are not (for want of Ships and marine knowledge) capable of affairs abroad, thofe that live fome diltance from the Sea make hunting their chief recreation: and fuch fport as tries their courage as well as agility; the Ifle having ftore of Tygres, Ounces, and fuch Beafts as give chaie and re- fiftance. The Alcoran is known of late years in moft parts of the Ifle, and as an infedi- ous air fpread into the moft remote Iflands. Friendly they are towards the Englijh, efpe- cially fince the Dutch forced Jacatra from them, betwixt whom is fuch variance, that fif teen Ryals have been given by either as a reward for a Prifoner dead or alive: nor is there ever hope of true amity with Barbarians. The Oran-kays are the prime fort of people * who are lazie and fociable, but deceitful. They repute themfelyes defcended from Chy~ na \ and have a Tradition that they landed there out of a Junk which was feven hundred years ago forced upon that Ifle by tempeft. They are a very proud race, wear their hair pretty long, and about their heads fometimes wreath a valuable Shafh which none but themfelves dare touch but go elfewhere naked to the. wafte,where they gird themlelves with a patty-coloured Mantle which falls no deeper than the knees. Their ordinary food (and not at eafie rates) is Rice, Wheat, Finange, Betele, Opium, Goats, Hens, Eggs, Co coes, Plantains and Jacks •, for drink they have excellent good Water *, and for Wine, Rac- a-pee, which like the Irifr Ufquebaugh drunk immoderately accelerates death; but tem perately exhilarates the heart, cures fluxes, kills worms, and helps digeftion. Thefe parts are for the greater part of the year fubjed to fuch loud thunders and flafhes of lightnings, as are very dreadful to ftrangers. Whence this noble Ifle is called Java, I confefs my ignorance. From J-avan (faphets Son) would be ridiculous to fuppofe, in that moft agree his Plantation was in the lefler jifia: but in regard his Brother Tharfis peopled thefe parts, might he not from his Bro thers name, and to his memory, borrow the denomination ? Niger apprehends that it is the fame was called InfuUfabadU, which founds like Java: fome call it famboli. There is another in Moraa of that name: fome alfo take it for Taprobane. Nothing fave Pepper and Cotton prefent themfelves in this Ifle worthy our noting. Pepper is a feed firft ibwn, and in the growth like Hops or Vines lupported by poles, till by maturity it gets the ftrength of abufhy,round, and pleafant Tree: the Pepper hangs four inches inlength and one about in many clufters *, each yielding fifty or fixty corns which be full, and round and fragrant: the fmoothis beft accounted of. Cotton is no lefs obfervable. The Tree is flender but ftreight, a yard high and like a Briar. Virgil in his lib. 2.

The Women have adulterated their firft ftamp, not onely by deforming their Face and Body with paint, but by that vile lubricity their Souls are Ipotted with. Impudence goes here unmasked: for contrary to the pradice of molt places, in the night thefe drink Rack which is their Wine, and then feem amorous: but it were well Travellers would remember that ancient Verfe very applicable to'this place, Nbx &amp; Amor Vimmq', nihil moderabile fuadent. for fuch is their damned Art, that thefe Syrens can fing fafety to themfelves, wlfen by the fame pipe and weed they fmoak another to death: a trick they will be perfed in though they die for it. - Tytha-Who have no fear nor fliame for their offence 5 Quae vero nec crubcfcunt But hardned are with brazen impudence- Ncc metuunt. refembling thofe mentioned by Pliny lib. 7. cap. 2. named BythU, qua yupllas Unas hah em in fingnlvs oculisj in quels erat vis it a Natural is at vifn ejfafcinant &amp; inter imant quos diutim intu- antur, oculis prafertim iratis, tkc. No lels lewd and cunning in this hellifh Art was Far if at is the Queen-mother who poifoned Statyra Wife to Artaxerxes by carving her half a Bird with a Knife that was invenomed but upon one fide, as you read in Plutarch. And which is no lefs mifchievous, the men ufe long canes or trunks called Sempitans out of which they blow a little pricking quill, which if it draw the leaft drop of blood, it deftroys im mediately : Some venoms operate in an hour; others in a moment^ the veins and body (by the virulency of thatpoifon) corrupting and rotting prefently, even to terrour and amazement. You cannot chufe but think this a Hell upon Earth, though at our firft ap proach upon fight of fo goodly an Ifland, we thought it an EUfinm : but remembring That Jmpia fuh dalci me He venena latentj we haftened away for better places*, the MoUccoes I mean, which Ttolomy calls Synda: than which, no part of the Univerfe gives more delight or greater varietie of refrefliment. Bbb By Pythagoras made the Wantbns of Crotond modeft and the men moderate. To thefe let me add with the Poet, Jam qui corrigat^ alter erit. This Artifice of thefe lewd ones may run parrallel with that Maid who by cuftomary eating of Napellw (the moll' dangerous Poifon, fome fay, of all Vegetables) hurt not her felf, but poifoned fuch as had carnal knowledge of her. So as verily, that which Menander applied to the lewd Cypriots or Propatid* very properly alludes unto thefe Courtezans,Molucca IJlands By the way we call our eyes upon many Ides, and (as we fail due Eaft) upon Baly in 8 degrees 30 minutes^ and Tymore in 10 degrees South 20 minutes Ealterly from the laft : both, more rich inftones andfpicesand white fandejrs much prized by t\\z Barmy an than fome greater Ifles about them. Leave we alfo Conio and Serran unfpokenof^ not tliat they are unworthy, but becaufe we hafte to the Molucca, in view now, and where we mean to reft a while. ; ' r r .. , . . ThtMolncco Ifles called SellsInfuU in former Ages, confine India^ and are five in'num- ber, Molucca, Gillolo, Ternate-, Tidore and Machan or Mat an : in which Jaft, Magellan after his long voyage 1520. ended his life through the treachery of thofe^WW^, to whofe Prince he had but a little before given affiftance.. The Bnglijh were the firfl that ever traded to thefe Ifles of any Chriftians: fo as moft of them have ever fince acknowledg ed our King their Soveraign : but by the Dutch it feems our men are now thruft out, as if all India were theirs by title from the Creation. Of thefe, Gi/lolo is greateft and Ternate the higheft: all of them afford Cloves, Mace, Nutmegs, Ginger, Pepper, Oyl, Aloes and Honey. Moft of them have the /Equinoaial for their Zenith, and by thofe diurnal fhowrs and breezes which fail them not with the Suns voicinage the fruits ripen fooner, the earth fmells more aromatical, and the air feems more nutritive there than obferved in moft other places. The Clove-tree differs in proportion according to the place whence it receives its vi gour ; fome are comparable to the Bay which it refembles, the leaves only fomewhat nar rower others to Box or fuch liketrees of humble ftature: 'tis moft part of the year green, having leaves long and fmall,diftending into many branches. It bloflbmes early but becomes exceeding inconftant in complexion^, from a virgin white varying into other colours: for, in the morn it {hews a pale green, in the meridian a diftempered red, andfetsin blacknefs. The Cloves manifeft themfelves at the utmoft end of the branches; and in their growing evaporate fuch fenfe-ravilhirig odours as if a Compendium of Natures fweeteft gums were there extraded and united. They are pruned thrice every year, and gratefully retort a treble vintage: yea, though but perfeded in three years, yet counted an advan tage : feeing Phyficians fay They are hot and dry in the third degree, corroborate the fto- mach, benefit concodion, and fuck up moifture fo exceedingly that no other plant will prolperin its neighbourhood. The Nutmeg like trees moft excellent is not very lofty in height, fcarce riling fohigh as the cherry: by fome it is refembled to the Peach *, but varies in form of leaf and grain and affeds more 'compafs. The Nut is cloathed with a defenfive husk like thofe of a bafer quality, and refembles the thick rind of a Walnut; but at full ripenefs difcovers her na ked purity, and the Mace chaftly entwines (with a vermillion blufh) her endeared fruit and lifter, which hath a third coat, and both of them breath out moftpleaiing fmells. The Mace in few days (like choice beauties) by the Suns flames becomes tawny i yet in that complexion beft pleafes the ruftick gatherer. In thefe Ifles only are found thofe rare and beautiful Birds of the Sun which are commonly called Mamcaudiau or Birds of Paradife. He is of the bignefs of a Parrot-, the feathers upon his head fofraall as rather refemble hair than feathershis Train thick and very long but curioufly coloured, in fom? parts of his body green,in others yellow, feet he has none: yet his Wings be large and of a bright colour *, in flying he mounts exceeding high and continues long in motion: a bird for its rarity much efteemed by Travellers, and not without fuperftitionby the Natives- Several other Ifles of note there are, fome of which, mmdy ^mboyna was in the quiet pofleflion of the Enrlijh until diffeifed by the treachery and cruelty of fome Dutch, who un- ' derafhew of friendlhip invited our Fadorsto a Feaft where moft perfidioufly and to the perpetual reproach of their Chriftian Profeflion amongft Infidels, not content with the poifeffion of the place they entertained thofe innocent perfons with moft cruel and exqui- lite Tortures. Thefe Ifles are commonly called the Molucca Iflesor Ifles of Bunda ; thofe two being accounted the principal. B A N D A in 4 degrees 30 minutes, and from Ambayna twenty leagues: and Am- hoyna almoft in the mid-way betwixt Banda and Molucca. P do way is from Bandathtcz leagues. From TulowayVJ. N. W. are Lantore, the greateft of the Ifles of Banda, Batan, Labatacka, Nero, Tycobajfa, Qmher, Salanw and others - all which, efpecially Puloway and Puloreen appear as if they were continued Wilderneffes of Nutmegs and Clove-trees, Pep per, Vines and Olives. Until fome late violence was offered by our emulous neighbours, the two laft commerced firft with our Englijh Merchants and contraded a perpetual Amity with our King; but in affront to them and us they have forcibly expelled our Merchants thence and now intitle themfelves Lords of Banda *, caring neither for our Intereft nor • what'Borneo. what right the Tarnatenfian nor Banda Kings have over them: albeit 'tis well known the Dutch traded thither after the Englijh, and that till the year 1598^ they had no Trade in any part of the Indies ^ in which year three Ships and a Pinace fet forth from Amfterdam r being their firft adventure into the Eaft-tndies \ whiclj how they have improved is under- ftood to the terrour and admiration of the Natives. Near thefeis BORNEO, (by Ibme luppofed that Jnfnlabona Fort may and Borne we find mention ed in Ptolemy) is an Ifle Nadyr to the ^Equator, in fhape it refembles an oval Shield : the major part inclines towards the North •, for her Antartic elevation is not above 3 degrees, whereas the Artie extends to 7 degrees odd minutes. The firft difcovery of any Chriftian European is attributed to de Breu-, who in the year of our Lord 1523. accidentally came to an Anchor at this Ifland. At this day it groans for the moll part under Spanilh fervi- tude, who where treafure is to be had become ingenious and indefatigable: but what Artifices they ufe is well known, and that under pretence of facred an infatiate thirft af ter Gold is too oft difcovered: albeit, they cannot'well be ignorant that Caelum nnlla efi reparabile ga&amp;a. It has many Villages, and confequently much people *, but the one, as to outward thi ngs, are poor, and the other wretched in their Idolatry: So as did not that plenty ot Gold, Diamonds, and other Merchandife, as Bezar, Lignum Aloes, Musk, Civet, Benjamin, Amber, Sanguis Draconum, Wax, Rice , and Rattans or Canes make her magnetical, the place would not be fo attraftive as it is to Merchants and Travellers. Her belt maritim Towns and Ports are which is in 1 degree 35 minutes South, and from Bantam N. E. a hundred and fixty leagues or thereabouts j and Bemermajfm: the reft be fcarce worth th^ regarding. Be^ar, or as the Perflans call it Penar and Pa-aahar is of two forts *, found both in Jffia and America : Of Afia the belt is had in Perfia, Pegu and this Borneo \ and is of more va lue than what is had in the new-found World. It is oft found in the ftomach or maw of a Goat in Pegn, and upon the Indian Mountains. Some neverthelefs, (how truly I know \ not) affirm it is no other than the congealed tears of a Stag:, and that fuch as are taken from Beafts feeding upon Theriacal Herbs are mofl; foveraign and of greateft vertue to expel poifon, and other noxious difttampers. The fhape alfo is various 5 for fome re- femble a Plum, fome a Date-ftone, others Doves-egs; and fome are like Chefnuts and Goats Kidnies 5 but all blunt-ended. No lels different are they in colour \ for fbme are red, pale green fome, other-fome dark yellow, and fome skye-coloured: the laft are beft, con- fifting of many fcales which like Onyons circumvolve one another, and in which Nature has expreft far more curiofity than Arts beft imitation: for, each inferiour fcale (not un like the Orbs) yields more fplendor than the others and as it diminiflies its quantity in- creafes its vertue according as it is in tenuity or thicknefs- Many are counterfeit: but to difcover the fraud, they ufe to pierce them with hot Bodkins; or after they have weigh 'd them fteeping them in cold water four hours, if they crack not they are held good •, and to know them for fuch,they firft wipe and ballance them •, obferving, that if they weigh never fo little above the firft weight 'tis a iure fign they are bale and of fmall value. It is alfo obfer- ved,that the Bezars of Borneo are not above half the value of thole which are had in Ptffia. Lignum Aloes according to the Countrey where it grows has diverfity of names. The Javans and Malayans name it Garroo , the Indians and. Portugueses^ D'Aquillha ; but the Chynefes and CochinchynefesyCalamha. It is framed of large round fticks of a clouded grain, tnixed with veins of an afti-colour: pleafantto the eye, and ponderous in the hand i but of a bitter relifh, and fitter for the fire than tafte: for, hot coals no fooner touch it, but to the honour of its own Funeral it expires and vapours out an odour fo aromatick and comfortable as no other is ufedby the Indians y Malayans^ Siamites, Peguansy Cambogians or Borneansy whQn they burn the Corps of their deceafed Parents, which with them is the nobleft manner of burial. Musk is bred in the navel of the Cat, and is either yellow, brown^ or black: the firlt is held the beft, the laft the bafeft: the choiceft fhews a deep Amber colour not unlike Spikenard, and is cloathed with a moift skin which fweats out fome briftly hairs, with out ft ones, lead or like adulterate mixture *, but withal of fo ftrong a fmell that to many it feems offenilve ^ and tafted, penet r ates a ftrong brain by its fragor: fweet fpices takes away the fcent *, and put into the mouth if it luddenly diiTolve, or in the hand if it be long a melting, thofe are the ufual wayes to difcover the quality. Civet (a fort of Musk bred in a little bladder within the teftieles of a certain Crea ture not unlike a Cat) is of different colours: deep yellow (as I have been told) is ufu- ally the beft, and the worft is white, for that is greafie and fophifticate; neverthelefs when it' is new it's obferved to be pale, and gradually turns yellowifh; Bbb 2 Benjamin'Borneo. Benjamin by the Malayans called Meryan and by other Indians Benyan, is either white or yellow, but both are itreaked: the gum ifliies from a tree which is high and fmall and furnifhed with fruitlefs branches the leaves are not unlike the Olive. Arabia has good but fegu and Siam better \ whereas that from Sumatra, Vriaman and ifomw/eiscourfe and bad, and more approved of at Java than in England. Amber is of many forms, grey, brown, white and black: grey is reputed bell, the black ' is worft, the other two be indifferent. The beft fort of grey is pure and interlac'd with afliy veins and not fubjed to fink ^ for the moft part got in Soffala.Magadoxa, Mombajfa, Mofanl bi^He, Madagafcar, Mohelia, Melinde and other parts of South Africk-, found there at incer- tain hazards. Now concerning Gems, I will but name their proper places, for in thefe I borrow the report from Merchants i Emrald, Chalcedon, Onyx, Sardonyx, Sardis, Bezar Amber, Hematift and Turquoife for the moft part are had in Arabia^ Indoftan and Perfia- Pearls, Berylls,Saphyres and Adamants at Jafper, Cornelion, Chrylblije, A CT at Heliotrope, Jacinth in Mallabar-, Narfmga and Cochin-chyna (which Cochin-ehyna extends from 11 to 17 degrees North lat. and is confined by Chyampa, Tmchin, Lays and the Ocean: a Countrey richandpleafant, the People Idolaters, yet civil to Strangers,) Diamonds come from Borneo and Gulkunda-, Bifnajrar, Delly and the Ifles near the greater Java: Gold, Silver Rubies and Porcellan from PegHySiam, Bengda-, Sumatra,Japan and Cbyna ^ enough to make poor Men rich, and rich Men miferable. Now albeit the beft and moft Orient Pearl in the World have for fome years been got near Bahrim in the Gulph of Perfia, where in fome Oyfters have been found no fewer than 100 Pearls great and Imall, generated (fome fay) of the morning dew of Heaven, which in ferenes falls into the gaping Shell-fifh, and there breeds no otherwife than as kernels do in Hogs and ftones in bladders or the kidneys:Never- thelefs ftore of fmall Pearl is had in Oyfters, Mufcles and other ShelWilh all along the Coaft of India, as I could partly obferve in our paffage: for the Natives in feveral places would adventure to the fides of our Ships though under fail with their fmall Canoos tp chaffer with us and I well remember, that amongft other things ftore of Seed-pearl was pro- fered. Howbeit, fometimes great Pearls are found, as may appear by the report of a Sea Captain, who not far from Borneo law a Pearl was round and Orient and of the bignefs of a Doves egg, of great price and probably Xuperior to that which Cleopatra dilfolved valued at 250000 Crowns, and drunk to aggranaize^/. Antony''s Welcome. P.

To return. By a N, N. E. courfe in few hours we view Mindanao lile (as big as Sicily) branching from 6 to above 9 degrees North. North of which and neighbour ing are the Philippine, fo named in honour of Philip II, by Lopez.de Legafpi who firft difco- vered thofe IQes and planted there An.Dom. 1565. near them are the Manilia, by PtoL called Satyr or mi InfuU, Ifles for the moft part namelefs becaufe numberlefs; of which, the beft and greateft is Lmonia under 14 deg. North lat. whence in a dired azumoth Weft is Cambogia a rich part of the Aftatick Continent ^ but North from Luconia are Shyma and Shycoca, beft known to the Inhabitant of Chyna and J^^,as is Formofa which has 22 degr. an Ifle 150 miles in length and 5o inbreadth, lirft inhabited by the Spaniards and Mulattos, who grew very numerous and rich v but of late the Dutch have thruft in by force amongft them, and there planted a Colony. The Scituation is very advantagious for Trade, fo near neighbouring Chyna and Japan, with innumerable other Iflands, as is Corea •, a long narrow Penin- fule, famous in the fcite, but infamous in her Inhabitants, who are a People that live by Ipoil and doing mifchief to their Neighbours, more fubtile than the Chynefes or the Japonefes. JAPAN, unlefs Mercator's fancy be true that it was Aurea Cherfonefm, was unknown to old Geographers; albeit the Name Chryfe be given it by Niger and Zipangri by M' P' Vmem: who rather than fo great an Ifle fhould be without a Name, makes bold with his Invention: but certain it is we owe the firft difcovery to Mom, Pejhom and Zeymorm, hzmfotPortugds, who in the Year 1542. wandring abroad to feek their fortunes were by ftorm ihipwrackt upon this Ifle, from which time it was well known to them, but the EngUJh begun to trade here not till the Year 1613. the Dutch more lately: but whe ther it be an Ifle or no is difputable: albeit ibme pretend to know its dimenfions, and ac cordingly limit it 'twixt the degrees 35 and 48, and by like lup^ofition the length to be 230 leagues and breadth 109. or thereabout *, moft 'of which is barren and courfe, but fruitful in Minerals. Towns of beft note and Traffick are Meacco, Oz.acca, Tenz.e, Fyrando, Fuccatc or Falcate, Sacay, Cratez., Tenkeday, Oringaw, Amamgueyo, Vofuquis, Mach- ma, &amp;c. of which Meacco, a Mediterranean City is reputed the Metropolis, Surunga the next beft,and next that O^acca honoured with the Court till about the year 1615. a great partpart of the City was fired •, and not onely this, but many other Towns in that Province. Meacco is as big as Florence-, but not fo beautiful and watered by a River of fweet wa ter, the Buildings are but ordinary: of belt note are the Fotiquees which are filled with Manadas, to which the Japnians are exceedingly addided: The Jefnites induftrie though great, produces little advantage, the ^People are fo miferably drawn away by the exam ple of their idolatrous Neighbours the Chynefes, whom in nothing, elfe they feem to agree with, and albeit at firft there was a feeming converfion to Chrifliamty both in Xavicrh time and frnce, yet have they oft apoftatized, and the greateft number of Inhabitants being GVw- tiles have made many maiTacres and deftroy'd fuch as were real Profefibrs; infomuch as at this day there is little of Chrtfi there own'd *, thefe Wretches rather inclining to the Alcoran which has of late years crept very near them, and beft agrees with their fenfual appetite for it gives a large toleration to carnal Men,and has nothing of aufterity mixt with it,which beft pleafes. The Government is Monarchical; above threefcore petty Princes do homage and pro- ftrate their Coronets afore the Supreme Diadem. The Countrey is moil part mountai nous but full of Pavolets, which makes it abound with Corn, Grafs and Minerals: the North and Eaft parts are lefs peopled than the South and Weft. The old Roman execra tion Ahi in malam Crucem and manner of execution is here in uie; a punilhment not more full of torture than ignominy: The People are valiant and reafonable civil, .affedlors of novelties, and beyond meafure jealous if occafioned, revengeful if injur'd, and devilifh if exafperated: They pretend much to Learning and,efpecially ttf skill in Geography, how- beit are ignorant of the European and African in the greateft part, and totally concerning the American ; neverthelefs have no fmall opinion of their Art in the divifion'of the World, wherein they think themlelves fuperlative iaiid. all others miftaken ^ for they divide the World into three parts, that is to fay into Chyna^ Jayan and Syam, which fufficiently ex- prefles their ability in that Science: ]3Ut in Entertainments they are better skilled, for they fit long and fare well, and in eating ufe fticks,or forks, and Ihift the Table as new Courfes are ferved: In riding they mount upon the right fide-, their Alphabet ex ceeds not twenty Letters, whereas the Malayan has 26. they as the Chynefes have alfo many Characters, of which every one ftand§/pr an entire word as we ufe in fhort Writ ing. At Funerals they wear white. They would but cannot deny themfejves to be de- fcended from ; for certain it is they were taniiht about fix hundred years ago up on fome infurredion*, in confideration whereof they continue an implacable animofity to each other; the Iflanders rob and prey upon the Chynefes abroad on all advantages ^ yea, at home in their prayers abominate, and in all Complements and Ceremonies are oppo- fite to one another as much as may be-, no lefs than the and Spaniard. 'Upon any trivial accufation the Children are fo fenfible of their Reputation that without any paufe to evince the truth, they will whip off a joint Ififom their finger with this imprecation. If true, I wilh my hand may never heal again: Murder, theft j treafon, and adultery are pu- nifht feverely, either by crucifying or beheading with a Cuttan. Ozacca is 80 leagues from .* a Port of good note, and in nothing more obfervable than the Caftle, which heretofore as reported was varnifhed, tyled and burnifht in fome places with thin plates of gold a regular fortification and of excellent ftone; the walls whereof were every where twenty foot thick, and the whole work circled with a large deep trench full of water : the Caftle was entred by a doz-en iron Gates and fome draw-Bridges: Of late years it was made the prifon of Coja-zamwaVniice of Tanzey eldeft Son of Tiqua^amma the late Emperour *, whole Father Faxiba-z.amma' fubjeded all the other Princes of Japan and made them by oath and pledge acknowledge him their Sovereign : Coja-zamma upon his Father's fudden death was upexpededly feized by Ogojho-z,amma who compelled him to marry his Daughter; aft^er which, he was requited by confinement to that hateful Prifon.

In Ptolomy it is called Sinarurh Regio, Seres by other Geographers: the Moores in Indiu flam call it Cathay a, the Arabians T'fynin, the Syamites Cyn, the Malayans Tabenzo, the Japomtesfhan and X^fyv, the Tartars Ham (from the Metropolis which they call Ham-ceu) Alhacen Tagit, Paulm Venetus Mangi •, the Inhabitants (lay Per era, Riccim and Trigamim) Tamen ? and themfelves Tamegines, But how various fo e're that be, this is not fo uncertain that it is a fpacious Monarchy, and extends from 17 degrees to 47 of North Latitude, which to the South Cantam, and to the North Fequiny two Roal Cities feem to terminate: on the Eaft and South it has the Ocean ^ on the Weft the Defarts of /«- dufiant: on the North the Tartars, and on the South-weft Cochyn-chyna and Pegu: Square, and from every oppofite fide not much lefs than 1500 Englijh miles as fome have ima- gin'd', which granted, the whole compafs will be 4000 and upwards. The Countrey is fullof fweet and navigable Rivers, fome of which are no]efs inhabited than Cities, which are reported to be 600, befides the Jefmtes report it has 2000 wall'd Towns, 4000 unwallM, 1000 Caftles, and Villages fcarce to be numbred: and many they had need to be, lince they lodge (as fome Fryars that inhabited there have undertaken to eftimate) above threefcore millions of Men, Women being uncounted : which if fo, it has four times more than all is fuppofed to have*, and well conhdered excufes that conjedure Brearwood makes in his Enquiries, faying, That if the whole World were divi ded into 30 equal parts, the Chriftians will appear to be but 5 of the 30, the Mahome tans 6, and the Gentiles ip of that diftribution. The whole Empire is divided into fifteen Provinces, governed by fo many Quon-fu and Laiifia who have their Tutons and Chyans, as their Deputies are intituled. Each of thofe Provinces has a Metropolis; but every way more excellent than the reft are Paqmn by fome called Pafjuin, Nanquin, or Nant on. Can- tam or Canton^ and QuinzJty by them called Ham-cm : of which four, Paqmn hath now the precedency, albeit Qnin^ay had'formerly. P aQU IN elevates the North Pole 41 degr. 15 minutes*, and by late Geographers is accounted the fame City fome call Cambdn watered by Polifanga, differing from the lat. of Camhulu which is placed in 45 degrees, and Countrey in which 'tis placed: but if Pan- toja and Dicanti fay right the Chyna Monarch is that fame great Cam with M. P. Venetus and Mandeville-, who doubtlefs were no further Eaft than Induftant and Baftria, and from the reports there met of the more eafterly parts, by them made famous. The City Paqmn, as defcribed by fome (which are without good authority) is not onely the greateft and beft peopled City in all Afia but ail the World: if as fome report it hath 30 Patch leagues circumference, in which are many ftately Buildings, and 24000 Mandarin Sepulchers, the meaneft of which are not without fome beauty •, and a no lefs number of little gilded Chap- pels, befide 3800 Temples devoted to Idolatry: it has fo many Gates and Pofterns as days in a Year; fixfcore Buzzars and above a^thoufand Bridges. This City is diftant about a hundred miles from that marvellous wall fome fay Chrifnagot others Zaintzon the 117 King built 1000 years fince to keep out the Tartar, a wall 1200 miles long, twelve yards thick, 'and fix fathoms in height, fuch as was feven and twenty years ereding, by a continued labour of 750000 Men', which neverthelefs could not hinder the Tartar of late who not only forc't his palfage but with little oppofition hath over-run and fubje* ded this great Empire, as reported. t * . N AN QJ.11N (the fecond City for grandeur ) was once the Metropolis. It elevates the Ardic Pole 3 5 degr. and is diftant from the Sea 8 leagues or thereabouts. The City is 12 leagues about; circled with three ftrong walls and ditches: The King's Palace is vaft-, the other Buildings many (for 200000 are reckoned) but meanly beautiful; The Temples fuch as they be,are above a thpufand ♦, the ftreets fair,and the People induftrious. From, — Qhyna. From Paquin it is removed Eaft fix hundred miles -Englijb: moft part of the way, na vigable. CANT AM is at the moft Southerly end in 17 fome obferve 25 degr. lat. a Town rich and fpacious: our Ships ride commonly in view of it *, from which to Paqnin is little lefs than two months travel. Here Merchants are permitted to come afhore ^ but when they enter the City gate ufuaily inroll their Names in a Book, to the end that upon a pe nalty they return aboard at night: but of late have a little more liberty: In this place Merchants trade for Gold, Musk, Silks of all forts, Cabinets, Porcellane and fundrv other rich Commodities. y QJJIN Z A Y or Ham-cen borders Cochin-chym ; of old this City was the greateft • at this day the moft remarkable for variety of antick rarities of any City in the Orient! Thefearethe moft noted: and what is moft notable in them are their Meani or Idol- Temples. The Country is champaign and exceeding fruitful: the Rivers abound with Filh, which the Chynefes not only banquet upon, but alfo upon Frogs, Snakes, Rats, Hogs Dogs, and fuch food as many other Nations abominate: and for their better dilpatch they fifh with Cormorants. The People are Olive-coloured: more black or white as they live in diftance from the /Equinodial: they wear their hair long and filleted, but their beards very thin even to deformity: their eyes are commonly black and fmall, nofes little^ nails well-nigh as long as their finger but ferving to diftinguilh their generofity. The better fort are ha bited infilk and a fleight fort of fatten-, the meaner in black cloth made of cotton : both wear their coats long and quilted, made to tye under the left arm after the ufual garb of Afia : their fleeves are long and at the wrift very ftrait: their fhoes of fuch ftufFe as their coats *, but fome have them richly imbroidered, the fbalc is cloth or calico. The greateft variety is in their head attire : for fome knit their hair in cawls of filk, of horfe-hair fome but fome with fillets of Gold or Silver : others wear high round caps made of fine twigs ftitcht with filk of divers colours •, but others fancy an antick fort of hat which is high crown'd and round, but one half without any brim, and no colour fo muchpleales them astawney. The women aremodeft*, and amongft themfelves differ not in apparrel ^ in that a cambolin or vail of white linnen covers them •, ihewing nothing but their polt-feet, which from their infancy areftraitned ^ foas to make them a la mode, many of them vo luntarily become lame and cripled. They tolerate Polygamy and that odious fin of Sodomy *, yea, what elfe their idle de praved natures can imagine to pleafe their effeminacies, and are not alhamed to expofe them topublick viewin prints and painting. They are a proud, lazie, jealous and vo luptuous fort of People. Mufick, Poetry, Painting, and Stage-playes delight them ex ceedingly, and care not what they fpend in luxury and fire works: they eat in porcel lane *, which as Gonzalo de Mendona (a Gentleman fent thither by Phillip 2 with aPrefent) reports, is not earth of a hundred years preparation as commonly fpoken, but a chalky fubftance, which digg'd or foakt in water yields*a kind of cream above*, but below, the earth andfediment is courfe : out of that fine upper earth like cream, the pureft fort of Chyna-ware is made *, and the ordinary fort out of the other Earth,which is lefs fat or oylie: fo foon as they be formed or bak'd in the Sun they paint and guild them very curioully, and fo put them into the Furnace. Howbeit, JPancirollm faith that procellane is a compound of Egge-fhells, Lobfter-lhells and Gypfum, which is treafur'd 80 years in the bowels of the earth ere it be prepared. They have their dy et in many fmall dilhes ^ love their meat minc't, which they take up with two fticks of bone or ivory •, but fome have their nails fo long as ferves for that exercife-, for to touch either their mouths or meat with their fingers is abfurd. Their drink is commonly hot, and by its tafte and colour appears to be Coffee •, they drink oft and little. The Louthaya's will be ferved on the knee ^ fit on Stools and eat on Tables as the Europeans. And-albeit, no Nation in the World be more idle and voraginous than they, yet are few or no beggers found amongft them: for if he be a young beggerhehas the whip ^ if old,or lame,or blind, he is provided for in the Hof- pital. Murder they punifh with death,as alfb Theft v the leaft punilhment is the ftrappado: yet what Laws they have moft reiemble the Emperial, which they vigoroufly execute. Their Laws it feems are confiftent with the condition of the Country and difpofition of the People, but the extream rigour and execution thereof, may be refembled to the grape, which being gently preft yields wholefome Wine, but too much fqueezing ren ders it bad and unpleafant: 7 Tis a difficult matter for man to eftablifh any one Law that will quadrate with the humour of all places. Their juftice is fevere, their prifons ftrong ^ t /- r - eXeCUt ^ ons The Mandarins are honoured*, the Chyam's reverenced*, the King little lefs than adored : no Subject has recoude lave by Petition *, his Wives, ChildrenChildren and Eunuchs only have accefs to him: AmbaMdors enter not without Prefects of value: They are curious in Novelties and love to fee llrange Arts-, which thev d- lightfully pradife: few but has skill either in tillage, making China-dilhes, or can mint' fing, play or do fbraethmg that is ufeful and modeft ^ the Mathematicks t hey affed : ufe' not Lettei s but Characftersof which they have above 40600 : they write neither to the right hand nor to the left but down-right; not with pens but with pencils of horfe hair fuch as are in ufe with Painters: their language is molt part monofyilables •, few but have a vein in Poetry and Mufick, and are ftudious in all the liberal Sciences: Scholars and Merchants aremore honoured than men of War : no people in the World more honour their King than they? for they luppole him too glorious to look upon .• they obey his will in every thing, fill his Exchequer yearly with above a hundred miiiions of Crowns- call him the undaunted Emperour, Lord of the whole World j Son of the Sun ^ and beau ty of the whole Earth. Nor do any people in the World exprefs more filial reiped to Parents than they *, for they obey them at all times, and in all placesmar ry not without their confent ^ leave their Childrens names to them; honour them be they never fo mean ; relieve them be they never fo poor v at their death exprefs all fymptoms poffible of duty; and in white Linen, as did the Jews of old, ieldom mourn lels than two or three years, the longer they mourn, they think the better they exprefs a filial obfervance and afFeftion. An obedience that hath ablefling with if,-for as Homer well obferves, Farentes non horn- rames hrevis avi fimt, diihonourers of Parents are of ftort life, as in the Decalogue is inferred. They arrogate to themfelves the invention of all Arts and knowledge in the liberal Sciences ^ and it cannot be denied but that fome of them they have, as Logick, Rhetorick, Mufick, Arithmetick and Aftronomy: they are, fay they, the moft ancient and immixt people in the Univerfe-, have all from their Minerva, and borrow nothing from others: they boaft how that they firfl invented Charafters, Guns, Painting, Tillage, and Navigation. Now give me leave to fay a word in our defence againft the Rodomon- tado's of thefe Ghyneftansy who as I fuppofe, in none of thefe parallel Europe. For their antiquity, I deny not but they have continued without much mixture (yet admirable if Jo, fince both the Tartars and Siamites have over-run their Country) fince the firft femina- ry, begun by Sem in thofe parts ^ but if granted, others in that may compare with them j •namely, the Brittainsy Bifcayms and others: for I regard not their Legend of Kings or fuch Conquefts as they obtained long before the birth of Time, a hundred thoufand years ago ^ unlefs we qualifie it by the Ephemeris of the Arcadians whofe year hadbut ninety daies 5 the Spaniards but four months; the Maffagets fifteen ^ or of the Egyptians who had twelve years in one of ours ^ following the courfe of the Moon and not the revolution of the Sun, nor regarding the Dies int ere alar es : an error, molt of the Oriental Ethnicks are plunged in. Very likely they imitate the Chaldee, who as Dio. Skul lib. 3. affirm the ori gin of their Charaders or Aftrologie, was three and forty thoufand years before the overthrow of the laft Darius ^ which did not JLnnins of ffiterbo help in his Paraphrafe upon Berofus would be laughed at: but Xentphon and others fay, That the years they ac- counted by wereLunarie*, upon which redudion it will appear that 43000 of their Lunar years make but 3634ofour Solar: their Hieroglyphicks, though more antient than Let ters, comelhort of the Egyptians. Their Guns(the ufe of^hich Bacchus taught them) are not above a fpanlong; fothat they rather refemble Piftols than Guns, their bore and fquaring being lefs than ours : and for their painting it Cannot be denied but it is of good colours; buttheir defigns are fhort of our invention : they draw the poftures filthy and fliadow meanly *, which doubtlefs in painting makes the perfedion. Horologic knowledge they want^ as may be fuppoled by that ftory of the King who upon firft view of a Watch prefented by an European was fo furprized that he verily believed it a living creature, till by winding it up he perceived the ipring the prmum mobile. Their Husbandrie is without much Art: for albeit the grain be good, the loyle rich, and the Zone moderate, yet their corn is neither fo various, nor fo good, nor fo certain as in our Harvefts. Their Navigati on is lame: they build many fhips, yet without beauty or defence; nor have they much skill in failing, having no good Logarithms nor Mathematick inftruments to take the height of the Sun by: their Compafs alfo is defedive ; for it hath but eight or twelve points to di- ftinguifh by, nor is the Magnet (till of late) known amongft them ^ having the Cynofure and Vrfa minor for their bell: diredors: notwithftanding they fay they fee with twoeyes&gt; thofe oLEurope but with one, and all other people are blindjor atl^aft purblind likethem- felves in their cenfures. They delight exxeffively in all forts of game v and when they have loll, care not though they'flake Wives and Children, whom they willingly part with till they can redeem them. They are hofpitable one to another, and believe a Refurredion: for fomefimes Gee ; . theyFunerals of tQhinefet. they will lend money to be repayed them in the other World: Inter-ludes, Malques, Fire works and fuch devices wonderfully take them: nor value they what money they expend in fuch difport, fo their expedation be not fruftrate. Their Houfes are meanly built and as badly furnifhed: Howbeit, their Meani have no fuch grandeur nor external beauty a&lt;? in a Country fo peaceful, fo rich, and amongft a people fo ftudious and fuperftitious might be expeded : yet though their outfides be but or dinary, they many times are lined with excellent good Porphyre, Serpentine and like Marble. Their Coiledges and Tem pies exprefs by fome invention or other their infernal Art and familiarity with the old Magician; to whom they devote enthufiaftick Boyes who with their long fpread Hair pro- ftrate themfelves afore the Mannada *, and fuddenly as if fome Hag had terrified them ftart up and vibrate a Spear or other weapon, whiles the Spedators with dejeded look^ warble out a foft Doriq' fort of Mufick, departing not till the vaticinating Youths pro nounce fomewhat that points at his Worihip and their Obedience. They celebrate their Natalitia very folemnly, a fortnights time fpending the dayes in paftime, and the night with feafts: amongft the reft they have choice fruits and wines in which they take a full liberty. The new Year they begin in March, and is no lefs obfer ved there: at that time every Manftnves to exceed others in the fancy of their pageants and adorning their doors refpedively with paper Arches and Images,' and all the niehf long make them vifible by lights and lanthorns. 5 Their Weddings have more or lefs Ceremony according to the quality of the Perfom. Their Funerals are after this fort *, when any dyes they firft wafli,then perfume, and laft- iy apparel the Corps and put his beft cloaths on then cover his head •, and having fet him in a Chair, his Wife entring the room firft gives him a refped and then kilfes him ^ after that fhe takes her farewel with as much forrow as can be imagined : fhe is no fooner gone but his Children enter in order according to their feniorities-, they firft kneel and then kifs the dead Mans hand, yea ftrive to out-vie each other in their ejaculations, expref- fing their love by forrowful countenances andgeftures, as beating their breafts and pou ring out tears in abundance: being withdrawn, next his Kindred ad their parts, and laftly his friends and other more remote acquaintance: the third day they lay him in a Coffin of precious wood which they cover with a filk cloath, and over it place his pidure: for fif teen days in that fort the Corps reft,and each day a Table is fpread with Meat, which nieht- ly the Priefts have liberty to eat ^ for 'tis they that burn the Incenfe and offerSacrifice: when they carry it to the Grave,Women are hired to howl,the better to move others to compafR- on: fometimes upon his Coffin they place the Image of a dead Man whom they exped fhould fhew him the liireft and readieft way to Elyzium: that done, the Widow and Chil dren for fome days feclude themfelves*, and when abroad, go doloroufly habited*, for they put courfe Sack-cloath next their skin *, have their cloaths made long and plain • and for three years fpace are not feen to laugh or joy in any thing •, but to the utmoft of their power exercife their love by their continued lamentation, abftinence from feafts and pa- ftimes^ and in all their Letters fubfcribethertifelves. Such a ones difobedient and unwor thy Widow, Child, or what may beft fet forth obfervance. Having launchttoofar, 'tis high time to look homewards: yet not till we have bid fare wel to lovely Afia •, into which when fome have adventured,this Motto may be remembred.

This Bigarroys was nrit aiicovered by the Portugmfe: but except fome Welchman gave it the name,I know not whence called Bigarroys, feeing that Bigarrad in the britifh dialed fitly complys with it, the condition being a defolate Ifland: defolate in human inhabitants, for with other things tis replenilht, as with Wood, Tortoifes, Dodo's and like Fowl. To Our view it \x7 V fl- lt j no tv er y high at a league diftance: but this! alfo remember, that at the South- e i: en(: * are ^oalds, which are long and dangerous. By benefit of a conftant wind we foon arrived at the Manritm* MAURI- 378Mauritius Hands MAURITIUS is an Ifle fcituate within the burning Zone under twenty degrees five minutes Antartic latitude *, longitude from the Meridian of Cape Comryn twenty degrees and as many minutes, and variation four and twenty degrees and nineteen minutes. To what part of the World it belongs is queftionable, feeing that it participates both with America in refped of the vaft South Ocean, and inclineth towards the Afiatic Sea, waflv ing Indiay Java-, and other Ifles and with Afrique alfo, to which molt properly fhe ap pertains i if you think fit to make her fubordinate to that Emprefs of Ifles Madagascar which feems to ihadow her, and from whofe Eaftern banks ftie is removed an hundred leagues or thereabouts: But however doubtful to which three it appertains, of this there is no doubt that for variety of temporal bleffings fhe may compare with moft pla ces in the Univerfe. it was firft difcovered by the Portugal, - whofe induftrious arm and ingenious fancy (e're America was difcovered by Colnmbm) gave us the firft full know ledge of theEaft, and names to many places formerly innominate.

In fome old Authors we read, there was Tree-honev as well as Bee-honey •, or as they call it Tears or blood dropping from Trees. By that defcription it fhould be the Palmeto Wine: which Wine and Amber coloured Nuts, beinz poliftied,were by the Perfians ufualiy fet upon Tables or Cabinets amongft other curiofitiesi as Xenofhon takes notice in his Travels: Seamen ufualiy have a cane or quill which they fuck with, fo as two or three Trees being pierced, in an hours fpace re- pletiate thegreedieft appetite though he bouze his belly fullto drink with moderation it comforts the fpirit, albeit cold in the digeftion: it alfo purges and helps obftrudions* and kills worms; but immoderately taken intoxicates the brain and difpofes to fluxes-, howbeit, expofed two dayes in the Sun turns acid, in which quality it is binding.

Parratsand other Birds alfo would be tafters, which made it of more repute with Paffengers. Several other forts of Trees there are which differ no lefs in quality than form. One I took fpecial notice of was above five yards about and of a reafbnable height, but umbriferous it was not 5 for albeit it had many branches, yet was it without leaf or fl ower : the bole fo foft, as with a knife I could almoft as eafily write my name in it as with a Hick one may in land: in curiofity I put fome of the wood into my mouth and chewed if, what the vertuemay be I know not •, but for half an hour my mouth was inflamed as if I had takenTo much Vitriol. Near that was another which was low of growth, yet large fpread in its branches*, upon it hung fruit or feed like alh-keyes, only thefe were larger and thicker,refembling the Gynny Beans or Carravances, but fafe-guarded with fharp prickles 5 by fiich a defence one might have thought what wasuwithin fliould have been conllderable, the fhell or codd was very hard, but being broke, found in it fix or eight Nutseach of which was lels than a Doves-egg *, but in colour and fhape not unlike the Beazer •, the kernell tafted like an Acorn-, what the quality was I could not tell, fave that by fome experiment the Chi- » rurgionmade, it was found in operation to be little better than Poyfon. The Africans at Sierra have fuch a Tree as this they call Ogou with which they invenom their Darts: this peradventure may be of that kind. Many other we faw here, fome of which were like Pines, others like Lymes and Sycamores •, and do not remember that we faw any Oak, Cedar, Fig or Cyprefs: nor was the fruit or feed they bore fuch as we knew, though we could refemble them to Pine apples, Artichoaks, Plums, Nuts, Cherries, and the like •, but asto their names or properties utterly ignorant', for the truth is, all or moft of the Trees, Birds and Beafts I faw in the oriental and fouthern parts of the World far remote vary or differ in fome part of their fhape from the Trees, Beafts and Birdswithus in Europe', neverthelefs in their feveral fpecies and kinds may be known by that their refemblance. Obferve we could alfo that nothing was loft •, for what was food for Birds, the Tortoifes would eat •, and what the Tortoifes refufed, the Hog^did devour: fo as by one or other all was tafted of. Again, this noble Ifle as it is prodigal in her water and wood, fofhe correfponds in what elfe a fruitful Parent labours in: not only boafting in that variety, but in feathered creatures alfo yea, in the rarenefsof that variety ; I will name but fome, and firft the Dodo •, a Bird the Dutch call Walgh- vogelor Dod Eerfen : her body is round and fat which occafions the flow pace or that her corpulencie *, and fo great as few of them weigh lefs than fifty pound : meat it is with fome, but better to the eye than ftomach •, fuch as only a ftrong appetite can vanquilh: but other wife, through its oylinefs it cannot chufe but quickly cloy and naufeate the fto- mach, being indeed more pleafurable to look than feed upon.

I have dwelt fomewhat long in the defcription of this Ifle, but may be excufed by the delight I took there after long being at Sea and fome ficknefs at Land *, lb that I could have been content we might have refted there fome longer time: neverthelels fo foon as the wind came fair aboard away we went, and in three hours fail loft fight of the Mauri* tim. Now forafmuch as this delightful place is within the torrid Zone, I cannot but here as I did in another place take notice of that opinion Aquinas and feveral others both Fathers and Philofophers held •, How all that vaft Ipace of Earth comprehended with in the burning Zone was not only uninhabited, but even the Ocean it felf efpecially under the /Equator not navigable; A tenet which took rife from a vulgar error and obfervation, That forafmuch as Heat within the temperate Zone was more or lefs according as the place is in diftance from the Tropick, the like reafon over-ruled that betwixt the Tropicks it con- fequently increaft, by how much it had its nearer approach towards the iEquinodial, whereThe Sun's Excellencies ^Properties. wbere the heat as they imagined was intolerable. For anfwer: It is very true the Sun kT ing limited h^ courfe withntthe burning Zone, by reafonofthatconftant refidence emits his beams and fhines with utmoft ardour upon thofe parts and People, whether his slan- ees be oblique or perpendicular; and from thence it is the Continent is more efpeciaUv parcht through he extremity of heat and the inflammation of the Air. Neverthelefs! S b the wonderful wifdome and gopdnefs of God, thatinfome parts upon the Terra ma, but principally in Iflands and places well-nigh compafled with water, the Earth is commonly fruitfu and the Sun delightful and advantagious: In which confideration give me leave eulogically to enumerate a few of thofe many attributes have defervedlv Ircn given that glorious Pianet '• in Gra. r. ^.'it is cafled the great Luminary which the Almighty placed m the Firmament of Heaven to illuminate the Earth, and rule the day as the Moon whofe light is borrow d from the Sun, doththenight: Andinthe 19.

Ever m motion, never refting, and with his Light dilcovering all things. Nor is its Light lefs extenfive than its Heat: for Light is the Chariot by which Heat is convey'd about the inferior Orbs i and though in its own body limited to Heaven, by its influence it goes'to and fro and vifits all the corners of the Earth: at once, irradiates every Pro vince; views all Cities and other parts within the Hemifphere •, imbraces both Sea and * Land-, with equal refpedt falutes the Cottages of Peafants and Courts of Princes^ mer rily frisks up and down without differencing Prifons from Palaces-, gilds the Mountains, caufes the Valleys to glifter -, cheerfully dances upon Rivers, makes the Meadows fragrant and the Fields fruitful-, folaces Youth as well as Age;.revives,yea provokes decay'd Nature- and though inanimate of it felf gives life to Vegetables, Infedls^c. It renders all things fair, faith Firgil-, and Orpheus in his Lyriques fings, Ter Te virefcunt omnia, All things are made fruitful and flourifhing by the Sun. Now from thefe and other properties, the Gen tiles have this excellent Creature in adoration, which Job wifely reproves, faying, If I be held the Sun when it jhined, &amp;c. and my heart hath been fecretly enticed fo as my mouth kijfed my hand-, jhould I not thereby deny God who is above ? imitated by the Jews, reproved in the 8 of Ezekiel 16 verfe, where the 25 Idolatrous Elders fet their backs towards the Temple and turning their faces to the Eaft wodhipped the Sun-, this was by an erroneous attri buting to the fecond what was due to the firft: for it is the power of God that gives vertue to the Sun to exhale vapours, which vapours are formed into clouds containing rain; and it is rain that both qualifies the air and makes the Earth in due feafon to bring forth her increafe^ yet fo, as thofe and all other fubordinatecaufes,'together with the Sun and Nature it felf would be altogether ineffeftual, were it not for that operative faculty wherewith the Almighty hath endowed thofe Creatures: for it is by his direction the Sun not only helps the generation of all fenfible bodies, but as St. Auguftin obferves,that nourifhes and brings its Work unto perfection; therefore we maft acknowledge with Saint Amhrofe-, Bonus quidem Sol eft in Minifterio non in Imperio, The Sun certainly is good where it aduates as a Servant, not a Sovereign- Moreover, albeit by its benign influ ence ordained for the comfort of Man this Ifle and many other places within this Zone are obferved conftantly verdant and admirably fruitful^, neverthelefs it has its fhaddow, for it cannot be deny'd but in the Mediterranean parts of Africkhy the Sun's force and effi cacy the Countrey is gene rally aduft, and the earth for want of moifture converted into fand, as Alex, obferved in his travel from v£gypt to Libya upon a villt of the Temple dedi cated to J up. Hammon ; for five dayes neither Bird nor Beaft, Tree nor grafs appearing, faith the Hiftorian: A fit place for Cham's Poflerity, and agreeable to that of the Pfalmift where 'tis faid, A fruitful Land is made barren for the wickednef of thofe that dwell therein* D d d 2 In^ 88 The Suns Exce In thofe Troglodit Regions the Earth for the moft part being faplefs and without iprin^s which makes^both earth and air fcorching and infufferable: For 'tis rain and fprings that by moiftning the luperficies of the Earth produces Grafs and all other forts of Vegetables. And it is a truth alfo that, fer motnm [oils fit generalio &amp; corruptio in rebus inferionbm ^ &amp; opus ejus plw apparet in hoc Aimdo quam opm aliarmn planet arum. The Sun in his operations excells all the other Planetsand by his influence upon inferiors, both generates and cor rupts, as common experience teaches. Albeit it is faid of the Sun and Rain, that neither of them pierces the Earth above ten foot for faith Seneca, when the Earth hath imbib'd what is fufficient, it fhuts its pores, thereby oppofmg an unneceifary furplus. Howbeit Cardanus and fome others, allow the Rain to link ten paces deep, yea deeper fay fome' thereby furnifhing fprings with Water, which have three original caufes: tranfmutatiou of the air within the earth, percolation of the Sea, and Rain, Snow, Mills, &amp;c. This confiderationgavefubjed to a Poet for that Romance concerning the Pfilli their challeng ing the South wind, and to another, how That barren Land during all feafons doth unalteredfland Through Natures difreJfieB : for that burnt earth ZJnto a few Jmall herbs only gives breath ^ Which to the cy£thiops is great carfe of mirth. Withal let us obferve here as 1 have upon occafion fpoken in other places. That the heat is more intenfe and violent under the Tropicks by realbn of the Solftice in June and Decem ber than under the TEquinodial in March or September^ at which times the Sun only cuts their Zenith : for under the iEquinodial I have been four feveral times and the like under both the Tropicks, and foit was, whether per accidens or other wife I know not, but I could perceive the heat was more extream under and near the Tropicks where the Sun for fome ihort fpace of time feems to have its ftation: fo that both by what I then felt and fince heard from others of experience, the heat is greater at Ormus in thegulph of Perfta, Mocha in the red Sea,and at Berenice and near sy£gypt during the Summer Sollticp, than • we find it in moft Afiatic regions under or near the Equinox, as thofe Merchants that are converfant in Zeyloon, Sumatra, Borneo } t\ie Celebes and Molucca Ides, which are nadyr to the iEquinodial, have related and by experience can belt witnefs. Now the Reafons may be thefe : Firft, that through the like goodnefs of God the heat near the Trbpick is very much allayed by thofe tempeftuous ftorms of wind and rain which during that feafon ufu- ally rage in that Climat; not only for fix weeks obfcuring and confequently affwagingthe beams of the Sun, but occafioning the overflowing of Nile and Niger with feveral other Rivers inas zlfoot Ganges and Mehan or and others in India* infomuch as they feem to have moft Winter during the Summer feafon,! mean when and where the Sun is nigheft: for otherwife the heat under the Tropick both by reafon of the commorance of the Sun for fome time, and that the dayes there are longer than under the Equator, in reafon ftiould be greateft. Whence we may likewife note, That the Sun when it returns to the vernal iEquinox, and for thofe following fix months comes into our Hemisphere af ter he has made the Artie Pole his Horizon •, thofe Regions within the Polar circle (which have the fame diftance the Tropicks have from the ^Equator) albeit more refem- bliug night than day when the Sun is depreft and difappearing , yea by reafon of a con tinued darknefs and extremity of cold are places by us not to be indured *, Neverthelefs by this re-appearing of the Sun and its conftant refidence for half the year above the horizon, the Earth receives plenary amends and becomes habitable, albeit the heat be moderate', yea, produces fruits proper for warm Countries, and fuch as will not maturate with us in England. Secondly, feveral other accidents I may note which contribute to the tem perature of thofe torrid parts; forbefides the Monzoones or Anniverfary winds which for fix months blow conftantly one way and fix the other, thefe hot Countries have fre quent breezes which like the breath gently every morning and evening from the Eaftand South, which qualifies the Earth and Air exceedingly: fo as during that breez, the extremity of heat is very little perceived. Moreover, by the. interpofition of the Earth, the Nights, efpecially near the Sun, are equal or longer than the Day, during which the Moon that has power to govern the Night as the Sun the Day,abundantly compenfates, and being commonly attended by mifts, dews, fogs, and vapours lenifies the air and moderates the ardour of the Sun, as that Diftick of the Poet fpeaks very properly, QuodqueEngland's Forejl Quodque Dies Solis violento excanduit ajftu, Humida Nox refieit paribufque refrigerat ho-ris. What the out-ragiom Sm inflames by day. The Night*s cod dews do equally allay. For together with the frequent Ihowers of rain that fall through the rich mercy of the Creator, and under him attributed to the influence either of the Prafepe and Afelli or fome other unknown Conftellation, as alfo the Springs and Rivers that abound there more and more, confequently difpofe to a better temperature: yea, the like is from the delight as weh as (hade the Trees afford, who by reafon their fap retires feldom or never to the Root •are all the year long attired in their gayeft livery, and the Fruits in great variety fo juicy and cooling as refrefli very delightfully, agreeing with the defcription given by one of another like place, Tota h&lt;£ infnU frugibm &amp; arhorihus abundant manfuetis^temqHe femper yi- rentibus, &amp;c. All which conli4ered, it will appear that thofe parts are not onely habi table, but feeing Nature is no where more prodigal, no place is more luxuriant for pleafure in any other part of the Univerfe: and Ovid's Quortim qua media eft non eft hahu tabilis aftu, a pofition not to be credited. Neverthelefs, not to the Natives but to fuch as repair thither out of colder Climats let me give this advice, That they ftudy their prefervation both in the careful ordering their habit and diet, efpecially till they be fea- foned: for the air is very fubtle and pure,and enters the pores infenfibly; the fruits alfo are exceeding lufcious and tempt the appetite beyond meafure^ fo as without due care and moderation, the ftrongeft and healthieft bodies, By Flux orFeaver, will probably become quickly indifpofed and indangered. x 1 y Being under fail, the fifth day we defcried Land which bore South-weft; by its height and pofition we imagined it was that we call England's Forefl, which next day we afcer- tained. This name was impofed Anno 1613. by'Captain Caftleton Commander of the Pearl, but who made the firft difcovery is doubtful, feeing fome of late have given it Seignior Ma^carenas his Name, purporting he was the firft; yet other-fome there be that call it pHlo-puar, an Indian Name •, but by whom or when, fo darkly writ, as is not legi ble. This pleafant lile has above fifty Englijh miles circuit: the South Pole is there ele- vated twenty degrees 55 minutes from the Equator ^ its longitude fromMamtm is not more than 1 degr. and a half, and diftant thence about feven and thirty leagues^ but the variation of the Compafs 23 degrees: the ground is very high and raifeth it felf a good way into the middle Region: the earth every where green, erpetially in Trees which mount more than ordinarily to a fublimity. It had no creatures in it lave Birds till our Captain fent his long Boat with fome Hogs and Goats of both kinds alhore, that by a happy multiplication the future Palfenger might be relieved. Here is alfo plenty of Fifh, of which the Eeles are notable, fome of them weighing thirty pounds, whereby we may judge them to be Congers j not odious in their corpulency, for to the tafte they render themfelves fweet and moift. Birds here are many and rare, but moft of them being fuch as are fpoken of in Manritm, need no repetition. in few dayes by the benefit of propitious winds we launcht far into the ^r* del Zur, where Magellanes cloud StelU nebdofa fcarce vifible without a glafs, and more refem- bling part of the GalaBea than Stars they are of fo fmall a magnitude, with feveral other Antardick Conftellations more and more difcovered themfelves unto us and approach ed our Zenith. But long thofe happy Favonii continued not: for the wind v eering into a contrary quarter the Skie over-fpread with clouds, fo as the Sea laboured with a dread ful tumor. Seven whole dayes and nights this tempeft lafted, and forced us all that while to lie by the Lee without more fail than the mizzen.

It has no neighbouring Hies great or fmalU but feems equidiftant from thofe two noted Ports called Rio Grandi and Cape Negro, in Bra- the one, the other in Congo ; both in one elevation, and parallel with Saint Helena: from that in America diftant 400 leagues i from the other in Afric not much lefs, if any, from that number. It had its name given by John de nova, in, or about, the year after the incarnation of our Saviour 1502. fo called for that in his return from India to Lisbon it was difcovered the 3. of May, a day confecrated to the memory of Helena the Emprefs who firlt found the Crofs, the moft religious of Ladies in her time, Mother to the firlt Chrilliari Em- rour, Conjiamine both of them glorious in their age, Brittans both *, both bright Gems of this our Nation. This Ifle is removed South from the Equator fixteen degrees: from the utmoft Pro montory of South Afric hath two and. twenty degrees of longitude, and where the Needle varies five degrees and thirteen minutes, but from the lands end of England diftant 45 00 Bnglifh miles', from the Cape of Good hope 1740*, Madagascar 3000•, Surat 6600, and from Bantam 6900 or thereabouts. In that Bay, which takes name from the Chappel, the Ifle has this refemblance. But to what part of the inhabited World it appertains may be queried, feeing the vaft /Ethiopic Ocean fo largely circles it. To Afer I may imagine (becaufe it is neareft that Continent) rather than Kefputim. It is but fmall, not exceeding thirty JEnglijh miles _ cir cumference, yet exceffive high •, for it vails its head often in the clouds, where opening a wide mouth it gulps down fufficient moifture to cool its ardor, which by realbn of the Clime 'tis in, cannot but be fometimes intemperate; and but for that affinity it has with the middle Region which invelops it as with a chil-cold Tulipant, and long nights it has, that extreme heat which the Sun darts conftantly twice every year perpendicular upon this Ifle, would doubtlefs make the entrails enfiame (had it Sulphur) like another Fefet- viui, Neverthelefs the Land is not more eminent in its height than the ambient Sea pro found in the depth*, fo deep that it admits ill anchoring faveattheN.

Ne- verthelefs it is lo very deep here that the founding Line or Plummet will fcarce find ground', which is the caufe thatMarriners dofbmetimes carry their Anchorsafhore that they may moor or ride the more fecurely. By reafon of the depth I could hardly difcern ♦ eitherSaint Helena. either flux or reflux near the ftiore; feeming as if we were in the mid Ocean where nei ther ebb nor flood is to be difcerned. Ho wbeit, the fait water plaihes and froaths to fee it felf fo fuddenly refifted: but the moift breath ufually vaporing in or upon the Seas makes it fometimes turbulent. This Ifle is hard to be afcended; not that the palfage is craggy, but that it is fo Preci- pitious. The Sailers have an Ironick Proverb, The way is fuch, as a man may chufe whether he will break his heart going up, or his neck coming down : but being once up fcarce any place can yield a more large or more delightful profpedt. The Land is very even and plain at the top, and fwells no where to a deformed rifing; fome Springs above be fweet which below are brackiih: the reafon may be, for that in their drilling de- fcent they may relilh of the fait hills through which it cuts an ufual pafTage, fo as thev become fait both by their own compofition and the fait breath which the Sea eva^ porates. Neverthelefs, there are but two noted Rivolets ^ one which bubbles down towards the Ghappel, the other into the Lemmon Valley/ fo called from a Lemmon Tree and Chappel built at the bottom of the Ifle by the Spaniard Anno 1571. and by the Dutch of late pull'd down^ a place once intended for God's worlhip*, but now dilpofed of to common ufes. There are alio fome ruines of a little Town lately demolilht by the Spaniard, in that it became a Magazine of private trade in turning and returning out of both the Indies; no other Monuments nor Antiquities are there found. You fee all if you look upon the ribs of a weather-beaten Carrique and fome broken pieces of great Ordnance which albeit left there againft the owners liking ferve fome inftead of Anchors.

Anno 1588. Candijh, our Coun tryman, landed here in his circum-navigating the Globe-, and found ftore of Lemons Orenges, Pomgranads, Pomcitrons, Figs and Dates, but how the alteration comes who knows: for none of thofe grow there now that I could either fee or hear of, one Lemon- tree excepted. To conclude : In the old Chappel here we buried our Captain, Andrew Evans, whofe deaths wound (as formerly told) was unhappily given him by a Mannatee at the Mauritm. He was an expert Seaman, and no lefs vigilant than expert: fo as doubtlefs the Company had a great lofs of him. Cretenfis nefcit Pelagm? was an old Adage fettirig forth the excellency of thofe Iflanders in Marine affairst for it is with out controverfie. That in thofe times they inftruded other Nations in the Art of Na vigation v but upon the fubverfion of the Terfian Monarchy by the Greeks, and of theirs by the Romans, the perfedion of that Art was transferred nearer our Quarters ; que* ftionlefs the Portugals by their ingenious and induftrious difcovery of the Sea-panage into the Eafl Indies (fomewhat lefs than two hundred years fince) gave that Art its greatefb perfedion : but who is now the moft excellent ? let Reckerman decide the Queftion 5 which learned obfervator in his Treatife of the Spanifh and Portugal di- fcoveries makes this Refult, 'Hoc tamen cmnm eft, ommbus hodie Gentibus Navigandi indu- # ftriaThe (jorgades. ftria &amp; feritia Anglos efe fuperiores, Of all Nations the Englijh for Sea affairs are reputed the moft excellent; Fofl Anglosy Belgas j &amp; inter hos FlandroSy Hollandosy Zelandos^ Sec. and next the Englifli the Dutch, amongft which, the chiefeft in that Art are the FJemings^ Hollanders, Zelanders, &amp;c. So as by the judgment of that indifferent and learned Writer it appears the Englifh have thefirft place for Sea knowledge and Navigation attri buted them. And amongft the beft Sea Commanders this late Captain of ours very well deferved with the reft to be ranked. But to refeurn. That this is a very delight- fuilfle cannot be denyed&gt; and its admirable profped and other pleafures were M- ficient to induce our longer ftay but ftay we might not: So as after a Weeks re- frelhment we difcharged our reckoning in a hearty farewel, and by the invitation of a profperous gale upon a N. W. courfe fwiftly cut our paflage through the yielding Ocean ^ inibmuch as on the fixteenth of Ottober we were once more Nadyr to the Sun, which at that time was in its Antardic progrefs. Our latitude by obfervation was 13 degrees 13 minutes. The third day after, we had fight of Afcenfion Ifle, fo named by John de Nova in the year 1502. becaufe upon that Feaft day it was he firft difcovered it. The Ifle is South from the iEquinodial about 7 degrees, little more than thirty miles in circuit: not well wooded nor watered, little elfe obfervable: from Santa Hekna feven hundred and twenty miles Englifh or thereabouts. &gt; The feven and twentieth day we crofTed the iEquinodial line the fourth time: the wea ther was hot, but qualified by the Monzoon that continued blowing one way fave when the Tornado's interpofed, which was more or lefs until we came into nine degrees North. Wewere miferably peftered with that variable weather, till then being frequently enter tained with loud blafts of Wind, nafty ihowers of rain, v/ith terrible thunder and light ning: but Dem his quoque finem. The eleventh of November we were parallel to Cape de Verd and thofe liles Poets call the who feign that thofe threfe Iflands were the habitations of the three Gorgons Mednfa, Stenia and Vriale whom they make Furies rather than beauties-, ill requiting Perjewhis report, that they were the muchfamoufed Daugh ters of P/ww the Sun of Neptune, their yellow hairs curling like fnakes and dilhevelling about their naked fhoulders fo much fet forth their beauty and gained fuch admiration in the beholders as if they were transformed into Statua^s. But leaving thefe upon a more Wefterly courfe we coafted part of the American Continent, -viz,. Guiana, Florida, Virginia, New-England, and other parts of Norumhega, which with the feveral adjacent Ifles we paft by, fhall in this place have no other obfervation than that the Sea in many places as we failed was fo covered with green weeds and fmall berryes even where the water was not to be fadomed, that it rather feemed a field of Grafs than the Ocean. But what was moft to be noted, thofe Weeds or Branches like Nets were intogled and drawn along by the Barnacles which in thofe long Voyages ufually breed upon the fides of Ships and exceedingly pefter and retard their way in failing : defiring rather in this place to vindicate the Truth which of long time hath been either defamed or fo eclipft, as the reality of the firft difcovery is not well known, being neverthelefs attributed to Colam- bus. I fhall therefore in the firft place fee what either by Prophetic pens or Reafon otherwife is upon Record that may point towards that great, nay greateft part of the World, which for upwards of 5000 years and during thofe mighty contefts for an Uni- verfal Supremacy by the Monarchs of the Earth was concealed ^ foas until the only wife God thought fit to give more perfedion to Navigation,* it feemed totally unknown and un- difcovered. Tlato who was contemporary with Alex, the Great, and flourifhed about the 3580. year of the World* is one of the firft. He in his Dialogue betwixt Tim&lt;tm and Critlas difcourfes (but obfeurely) of a large Occidental iQand ^ which being without a Name, from the view he feems to make into the Atlanic Seas gives it the name of Atlas •, land in greatriefs compa rable to Afia and Africa, united- Ariftotle his condifciple approves of his conjedure ; al beit he takes it only as a fuppofition. Theophrafitts alfo in his Book of Rarities publifhed two thoufand years ago amongft other things relates how that fbme Merchants failing throughtheStraitsof were by ftorm driven further Weft than they defired, by which accident they defcryed land, but found it unpeopled. It is the opinion of moft that land was the Azores j for the Ifles Columbus firft found out when he made his firft difcovery were fully planted. Hanno the Carthaginian is the next. His Sea voyage is very uncertainly related: fome fuppofe(and 'tis but an Hypothefis) that he doubled bona Speranza, and amongft other places pretend the difcovery of feveral Weftern Ifles, but he courfe he fteered is queried : fome fay South, others Weft. Pomponius Mela and Lampridms fay the Land he difcovered E e e was^ 94. was South: if South then not the Weft-Indiesfor it may be prefumed that feeing the ufe of the Compafs was then unknown, his way was not without ken of Land, but rather crept near the fhore: for had he been in the mid Ocean he had been loft, and in humane reafon irrecoverable.

The fir ft wee meet with is MadocSon of Prince Owen Gwynedd, who for thirty years ruled Wales after his Father Gryffith ap Conan had at Saint Davids done homage to William the Conquerour for Lands he held on the other fide Severn.

That Owen was no fooner dead but that the cuftom of Gavel-kind (which fome think has ruined moft families in Wales') occafioned great divifion amongft his Sons, of which Jorwerth or Edward firnamed Dwryndwn by reafon of his broken nofe was eldeft, but withftood by Howel^nd David the younger Sons by reafon of that and other his imper! fedions, Howel alfo was objeded againft for that his Mother was of Ireland, 'twixt which Countries War was proclaimed: fo David was beft approved of though youngeft, both in reaped of his corndy perfonage^and ingenuity, but principally for that he had gained the artedion of the Lady Emma Plantaginet Sifter to King H. 2.

Madoc then ranging the Coaft fo foon as he found a convenient place, fate down to plant ^ after he had fortified he left a hundred and twenty Men*, and by Providence (the belt Compafs) and benefit of the Pole Star returned fafely to his own Countrey : where having recounted his Voy age, the fruitfulnefs of the Soil, the fimplicity of the Savages, the wealth abounding there, and facility of inlargement, after fome months refrefhment in ten Barques loaden with neceflary provifions they put to Sea again, and happily recovered their Plantation They found few of thofe they left there, livings caufed either by too much eating, no velty of that Climat, ( which though never fo good, yet caufes alteration in new Inha bitants ) or treachery of the Natives •, fo as Madoc (having the affiftance of Eneon and Edwatt vhis Brethren) quickly put it into good order ^ where they ftay'd fome time in expedation ot a trefh.liipply of Men, but their expectations proved vain t for in the overturn of that State by the indifcretion of that unhappy Prince Lluellyn ap Gryffith married to Ele~ oner Daughter ot Simon Monteford Earl of Leicefter and Eleoner Daughter of King John) Gmffyth being flain u4nno 1282 at Buelht, Madoc and his Company returned no more- nor is there any record that the Welfh attempted to profecute their former adventure! Neverthelefs, albeit Madoc and his Cambrian crew be dead and their memory moth-eaten, yet their foot-fteps are plainly traced; which the Language they left, the Religion they taught,the Reliques there found do clearly evidence: otherwife how come thofe Britijh words (not much altered from the Dialed: ufed at this day) amongft the Mexicans ? whence had they the ufe of Beads, Crucifixes, &amp;c ? all which the Spaniards as we read in Lopez, de Gomera and others found amongfl: thofe of jicufano and OdhHacanZt their firft landing in America: Yea,.whence comes that tradition amongft the Mexicans that a ftrange People came thither in Corraughs who taught them the knowledge of God, and by whofe inftru- ftion they became civilized# as related by Columhw, Pofielkfs, Francifcm Lopez, Cortex and other Cafiilians. That of Fernando Cone*, who Anno Dom. 1519. was AmbafTadour and General for Ferdinand and Ifabel, is moft remarkable *, infbme difcourfe'twixthim and Mateuma the fecond Son of Antzol and Father of Quahiitimcc the laft King of Me xico the Ambaffador obferving the Indians to have many Ceremonies which the Spaniards ufed, demanded who firft inftruded them: The anfwer was. That many years before a ftrange Nation landed there who were fuch a People as induced his Anceftors to Eee 2 affordafford them civii reception *, but how they were called or whence tfty came, could not fatisfie. Another time in a Panegyrick which Mutemuz.a returned them, he had this ex- preffion: One chief caufe of my affedtion to your Nation is, I have many times heard my Father fay how that he heard his Grandfire affirm. That fome Generations before, his Progenitors came thither as ftrangers, in company of a Nobleman who abode there a while and then departed, but left many of his People behind: that upon his return moft of thofe he left there, died: and that from him or fome of them they fuppofed them- felves to be defcended. By which narrative it may be prefumed, the People he meant were Weljh rather than Spaniards, and the Records of that Voyage writ by many Bardhs and Genealogifts confirm as much, as may appear by the learned Poems of Cymric ap Gronoy Gut en Owen (who lived in Edward the fourth's time,) and Sir Meredith ap Reefe, ( which laft lived in the Year 1477.) of Madoc has this Eulogie.

Nor then had his Holinefs nor his Catholick Majefty had that plea which they now ground upon the Genoans difcovery, as the Jefuits and others have fo vehemently difputed. Far be it from me in the leaft to detrad from Columbus, albeit 'tis iiippofed that his confidence arofe from anothers diredion who by ftrefs of weather was driven upon thofe parts, and to him com municated j or elfe from Columbus his apprehenfion of the improbability that fo much of the 360 degrees fhould be Sea, as ordinarily Charts do make; and that he might as well difcover Weft ward as the Portugals had done Eaft wards to the other Indies: be it therefore remembred, that this his Voyage was after the other of our tountrey-man three hundred and two and twenty years: So as poffeffion is the Spaniard's beft plea*, fee ing juftly he cannot arrogate to himfelf a right upon pretence of the firft difcovery. Columbus was born at Cugureo or Nervi not far from Genoa,: a Man of a modeft na ture, ftudious and well read in the Mathematicks, chiefly in Navigation : His firft encou ragement was (fay the Spaniards) from perufing an Ephemeris writ by a Spanijh Mariner, who had been forced into the Weft Indies by tempeft and died at Columbus his houfe after his arrival: this fome think was invented, to the end an Italian fhould not mafter fo much glory. Whether Columbus had any light from Poets, or heard of Madoc*s Voy age who knows ? for what Nation formerly knew not the ads of Englijh mcn better than themfelves ? otherwife Polydore Virgil had not undertook to our fhame and prejudice, the English Chronologic -, nor Verftegan ( alias Rowly) the confidence to render well-nigh all the 0 confiderable Gentry of thisLandfromtheEtymology of their Names,Teutoniques. Columbus well affured of this difcovery fent his Brother to King Henry the VIL to propofe the bufinefs fo he would accept the undertaking: but the improbability of the deiign to gether with the obfcure Quality of the Stranger, together with his too great frugality made the King give little credit to the propofition: for in 1|^ paflage he had beenimpri- foned by Pirates who ftript him before they fet him at liberty. 'Upon the Kings refufal he apply'd himfelf to the French King, who in like manner hearing that King Henry had refufed, gave him the likedifmifs: fo as he had refted under a final difcouragement, had not Ferdinand the Spanish King accepted the motion, and given him the Command of two hundred Men in two fmall Ships at the requeft of John Perez, de Marchena at that time Redor of the Monaftery of Rabida, a great Mecoenas of Learning and Induftry: withTercxra with which, after threefcore dayes fail, (in that~thne havino- nn fmall ^ ' T ZmTsImSd^d Columbus McntA Land, an Ifland by X neW named.

Howbeit, coming foOn'after alhore in Anddu-iauAtz poi t ing his adventure, the i&gt;ort«^/x by his Compafs eafily found the way,and quicklv plan- ted them with Men and what elle was ncceffary: at which tmic they gave them he Names oft Samt George, Saint Michael, Saint Mary, F Tyco, and the cornprehM ded at firft under the Name Terceras, but afterwards the Azores-, fo called from the many Aynes of Hawks they found there: albeit rather fuppofes the S de rived from the Spamjh word Eforer which fignifies to dry or wither: for the dd Name given it by Geographers (if rightly apprehended and granted to be that which TW fhraftus mentions m his Book of Rarities) was Vxiana and ■, but the new D= nominations impofed by the Lufitaman arenot improper: for fo called for that it refembles three Ides, meaning the principal: F^//hasits Name from theBeech-treeq with which it then abounded; Pyco from the Pyramidal fhape it bears; flora for that it was over-fpread with flowers the reft from Saints to whofe Patronage the Captain thoughtfitto recommend them.

But of more certainty it is, the circuit ofthelfle is difproportionate to its height •, for it exceeds not ten miles compals. The higher Earth is for the moft part Sulphur, and fhews many concave places whereout evaporates fmoak and flame which now and then belch forth Brimftone. Notvvithftanding, in the Valleys below there are delightful fliades and chil-cold Rivoletsdnto which when the Fire is vomited, thofe contrary Elements echo their difcontent, not a little to the terror and amazement offuchas are unacquainted with thofe rancounters; from this contrariety it is Ifuppofe, the,e Ifles are more fubjeft to dreadful Earth-quakes than other places. Moft memorable was that about the year 155,1. in Saint Michael'sIfland Xw/tfof mentions, which endured fhaking from the 26 day unto the 12 day oCJumft to the extream affrightment of the Inhabitants, efpecially when bv force thereof they perceived the Earth remove from place to place and the belt Town it had turn topfie turvy; the Ships alfo that then rode at anchor in the Bay trembled and quak't •, infomnch as the People verily thought Dooms-day was at hand, and that the Fabrick of the Univerfe was disjointing. Earthquakes, fays c 7 Meteor. proceed from watry vapors included within the bowels of the Earth, which in feekina a pafl'age to its proper element by making a tomultary motion (hakes the Earth; and 'tis oblerved that thefe concuflions happen oftneft in places within the temperate Zone, in regard that in cold places exhalations are not fo much increafl: as they be in hot, where the Vapors are fpent through excefs ofheat; chiefly where the Land is fandy, out of which exhalations evaporate with eafe: contranly, as here, where the loyl is rocky and mountainous,many hollow Caves are found ^ which being nil d with Vapors troubles the fuperficies; and gives not over until it make an irruption. Another Miracle the Spa- niards report for truth. How that the Ifle Com rofe out of the Sea, till then being far un der water. That and Flares were difcovered by the Spaniard. But more certain it is that in the year 88- they had them in fubjedion-, fuch time as the Earl of commanding her late Maiefties Sea-force, to retaliate the landed in delpight of the Inhabi tants and exercifed what hoftile Ads he thought needful; So as Flora and were lackt to purpole ^ S« Adichdcl alio was given the Souldier as free plunde^after the Admiral had for publick ufe firft fent thence aboard his Ship four hundred thoufand Ducates and upwards in Plate, befides Merchandize of great value : fo well recruited was that place, notwithftandingthe Noble Earl of Cumberland had examined it eight years before when moft of the Weftern Hies fubmitted themjelveslikewife to his mercy. Fay all the year following felt the EngUjh no lefs fmart upon the Spanifi account, which made the Inhabi tants execrate the Catholick ambition. In the year 1597* was in like fort fharer in that quarrel, when Sir Walter Raleigh made the Ille a prey unto the incenfed Englijh, the Spaniard then not fo able as afterwards to requite what provocation was added further at Orenoque in the Weft-Indies. I {hall but give this further remembrance, that at S. Michaels the true Meridian is only found', for there the Needle (hews no variation either Eafterly or Wefterly, contrary to what is obferved in other places: the reafon is inter Occulta Natura, gueft at by many, but by none certainly difcovered: albeit, fome conjedure it is occafioned by the magnetick vertue of the Earth which makes the variation more or lefs according to the different fcituation of place or diftance from either Continent: for where there is an equidiftancy, as in the mid-way 'twixt Afric and America, the Needle is oft-times found to vary leaft, the two Continents equally attrading all along that Meridian: but undoubtedly it is a fallacious conclufion, feeing the variation is fo fmall at the Cape of Good Hope and other places contiguous to the African Continent. Howbeit, the ancient Accounts of the firft Meridian,from whence Cofmographers aflume their longitude in former Ages, by JPtolomy and others, were placed at the Fortunate Illands, thole now called Canaria, and Cape Verde-, where is very little variation .• the reft of the meridional lines are 180; and albeit drawn from N. to S. yet by the lame Poles are terminated. ^ • 11 j 1 Leaving the the wind being fair and moderate we quickly entredthe Canta- brian Seas, where- after a little time we were churlilhly entertained by loud winds that fbon converted to a Storm of thrice four and twenty hours continuance *, during which we took in our fail and lay a hull, toft fufficiently: but fo good were our Ships that the great-&amp; I Return to England. greateft fear we had was of being driven nearer the Frracfc Coaft than we defired; for in fpight of Helm and Mizen the Tide or Current, if not both, drew us fo nigh to frnt (or as we pronounce it Vjhen) a fmall Ifle upon the molt Weftern Point or Pro. inontory or Britain { Armortea of old, but now Britain-Britanant as we were not a little endangered. In that diftrefs we likewife fought the Lord: who as he is the hope of all the Ends of the Earth, was pleafedto appeafe the noife of the Sea and the waves there- ot, Pfal. 6$. and in few hours more gave us the comfortable fight of our own Country; not unlike that long lookt for Ithaca.
