The place names on the map are unclear. “Coromanis” is shown on many older maps as located in present-day Kuwait, but here is shown as lying beyond “Catiffa,” or Al Qatif. “Luna,” on the coastal belt of the Arabian Gulf, could be Ras Tanurah, located near “Carmonis.” (Some historians believe that “Carmon” or “Carmonis” is derived from the Arabic name, Khor Omani, which various maps show at different points on the coast of the Arabian Gulf.) This place also could be “Cor Bobian,” or the Arabic Khor Bobian. A town with the strange name of “Baba” is shown adjacent to a river placed on the territory of the present-day United Arab Emirates. Beyond Julfar is “Cassape,” a name that is not understood by modern scholars. Qatar and Bahrain are ambiguously represented on this map, and difficult to identify.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Arabian Peninsula</topic></subject><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>United Arab Emirates</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Arabian Gulf</topic></subject><subject><geographic>Iraq</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Oman</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Qatar</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Kuwait</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Saudi Arabia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Persian Gulf</topic></subject><subject><geographic>Yemen</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/qnlhc/2920#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
