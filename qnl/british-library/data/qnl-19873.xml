Dated Bahrein, the j7th J maary 101 -3 s )&lt;y lo Sir, I have the honour to inform you that on the 23rd in stant the Sheikh 1 s Secretary 3 a gar bin '■ una ami. called and showed mo a notice which Sheikh Tsa proposed to issue for bidding all Bahrein Nakhudas to land cargo in Hasa at any other point than 0jair^ From enquiries it appeared that Sheikh. Isa had received a letter from the Mutasarrif of Hasa on the subject. Accordingly on Friday when visiting the^Sheikh on the sub ject of the landing arrangements, I askedi him about the mat ter, and he produced a letter from the Hutasarrif, a coP'.' of which T annex, in which the ^utasarrif asked the Sheikh to assist in preventing cargoes being landed elsewhere than at 0jair. Tt appears that the Mutasarrif wrote to Sheikh Isa con- gratulating him on Sheikh Muhammad 1 s safe return from the Haj, and that Sheikh Isa acknowledged this. In reply to that communication, the Mutasarrif sent the present communication. No doubt the incident reported in the diary for the week ending 6th January 1913, para 29S, brought the question of smuggling to a head and led the ^utasarrif to write on the subject. 4 I am suggesting to Sheikh Isa that he should issue a notice stating that the local authorities of Hasa have prohibited theW r the landing of cargo at any places on the coast except Ojair, and warning Makhudas and owners of Bahrein dhows that if they land cargo elsewhere they render themselves liable to punishxaent if caught, and to have the cargo confiscated. As the Turks appear to have very little authority on the greater part of the coast of the Hasa province, it would seem hardlv necessary for the Sheikh to take any active steps to make Bahrein Nathudas land all cargo at Ojair. Had the Turkish Authorities any real power alon^ the coast, it l, 'ould be, in my opinion, a distinct hardship for a merchant or nakhuda desiring to send goods to (say) Jubail or Kasr-as- Subaih to have to send them to OJair; as things are, however, the present prohibition will not, I imagine, affect any one very much* I have the honour to be.

It is said that the Customs Mudir at Ojair havinr come to know that some consignments for Hasa and ^Tejd were being passed through Husaini Port instead of through Ojair, reported the matter to the Mutasarrif at Haea. The latter sent round soldiers to Husaini to seize the goods and to threaten the people with a bombardment if the true facts were not forthcoming from them.

Sir, I have the honour to forward herewith a copy of a letter with a copy of the enclosure therein, a letter dated 9th Shaban 1531 from Sheikh Abdul Aziz bin Abdur Rahman Bin Saud, in which the Amir of Nejd states that all natives of Nejd and Hasa should be treated by Sheikh Isa as if they were his own subjects. I have not had time to look up the previous correspondence on the subject, but you will, I think, remember that the Sheikh has on several occasions raised the question of the status of subjects of neighbouring petty chiefs, and that you had a conversation with him on the subject when you were here in June 1912. The question of the treatment of the Nejdis, Hasawis etc., however, is complicated by the fact that they are - or at all events the Hasawis are - Turkish subjects, and until some arrangement has been arrived at between the Turkish Government and Bin Saud, I presume the latter has no authority to hand over the jurisdiction over them to Sheikh Isa.

Trevor, C.I.E., Political Agent, Bahrain, To— Major s. G. Knox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Shaikh ' Isa bin ' AB A1 Khalifah recently received a letter from the Acting Vali of Basrah asking him to apprehend and send to Basrah a Jew named Rafael bin Ezra Hayem who is alleged to be a deserter from the Turkish Redif, Amara circle. This individual is in Bahrain, unless he has been given a hint to clear out by any one, and is known to me. I understand that Shaikh ' Isa is going to send an evasive reply. He seems to have some rooted objection to ignoring communications from the Vali of Basrah, a course which I and my predecessors here have constantly advised him to adopt. I now have the honour to enquire what is the correct course to pursue regarding deserters. I am under the impression that simple desertion from the Turkish Army or reserve is not an extraditable offence, and that should the Shaikh desire to send back to Basrah any deserter, I ought to resist such a proposal, all such deserters being of course under the protection of the Agency as foreigners. No extradition treaty exists of course between Bahrain and Tur- kev nor could there be one until Turkey has formally renounced her claim to the Islands, but I presume the Political Agent could act on the analogy of the general Extradition rules in the case of any criminal charged with a serious offence, whose apprehension was demanded by the Turkish authorities in a regu lar manner.

I concur in your view that Rafael bin Ezra Hayem is a ' foreigner ' and as such while in Bahrain under the protection of the Bahrain Agency and that you should resist any attempt on the part of Shaikh ' Isa to send him back to Basrah as a deserter. 3.

Shaikh Hamad,Muhaimnad and Abdullah and three grandsons,arrived on board R.I.M.S.'Lawrence' about 9.50 a.m. He was met by me at the gangway. Major Trevor and Captain Keyes were present at the interview. Only Shaikh 'Isa,his sons and grandsons were allowed up on the quarter deck. I then said that a question had arisen about jurisdiction over Hasawis and that I .'ajor Trevor had reported to me about Hasawi the letter of Bin Sa f ud and a recent instai^b in which a/had been imprisoned by the Shaikh. Major Trevor had taken my advice in the matter and I had in my turn not cared to make any definite pronouncement in the matter without consulting the Government,although both the Shaikh and Major Trevor knew well that in the past Hasawis had been treated as foreigners and the Political Agent had had jurisdiction over them. The orders that Major Trevor had conveyed th® other day were the orders of Government and they were that the status v quo was not to be disturbed while the matter was under the consideration of Government. Shaikh 'Isa said that he was not particularly concerned about the matter of the 'Amir's subjects and,if Government's orders could be conveyed to him in writing,he would let the 'Amir know that these were his orders and that,for the present at least,there could be no change from old custom, in Bahrain. I assured Shaikh 'Isa him that the question was a very complicated one and might land/ ■ in difficulties^that he could not appreciate^with the Turks for instance and then with other Powers and that the present path was the safe one. Shaikh 'Isa said that he had nothing to do with the Turks or other Powers. £-■ I said that I was glad to hear that for in the question of a Jew deserter,I had heard it suggested that he was replying to a communication of .the Wali of Basrah. I was glad to hear from Major Trevor that he had not done so,for the Government had drawn my attention to the frequent orders from them that ■-■hey did not dooire shaikh j.sa to be drsrwn into correspond ence with the Turkish officials,a course of action which would- - ' would orCLy land, him in difficulties. The Shaikh attempted to draw^ a distinction between correspondence on the affairs connected with administration and on other matters. I assured him that the line was very difficult to draw and all corres pondence was, dangerous. Shaikh 'isa's visit was returned by me at his Kuharraq . residence the same afternoon. Captain Keyes accompanied me. No controversial topics were introduced and the interview was a very pleasant and cordial one. / I 22-5-14, S. G-.

I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of instructions contained tn your telegram No. 305-S.,t dated 16th May, in regard to the Jew deserter at Bahrain. On the 21st May, I visited Bahrain and the Shaikh paid the usual -complimentary visit on board the R. I. M. S. Lawrence. I had previously been informed by Major Trevor that, as a matter of fact, either in consequence of Shaikh 'Isa realising that the case of this deserter was being referred to Government, or on account of the conversation between him and Major Trevor on the subject of correspondence with the Turkish authorities or perhaps, and this is Major Trevor's theory, because the Shaikh's writer forgot, no reply had been sent to the Wali of Basrah. I, however, took advantage of a chance remark of Shaikh 'Isa's in the course of our interview to the effect that he had nothing to do with the Turkish or any Foreign Government to reply that I was glad to hear that he had realised this, as, in the recent case of a Jew deserter, I had received the instructions of my Government to remind the Shaikh of his obligations not to correspond direct with Foreign Governments or their authorities. Shaikh 'Isa endeayoured to draw a distinction between correspondence regarding matters of administration and other correspondence, to which I replied that the case in question was undoubtedly an administrative matter, that the line was very difficult to draw and that all such correspondence was dangerous and better avoided.K ' n- / 'i No^of 1914 British.

It is said that he had no cash (or for some unknown object) he borrowed this amount from Shaikh Khalif and arranged to pay him Rs.300 per month as interest, and mortgaged the Title Deeds to him. Now I hear from a reliable source that Shaikh Khalif is entirely under his control and he is directing him privately in any legal case in which he (Haji Abdul Nabi) is interested. Haji Abdul Nabi is secretly nego tiating with the German firm to try and use his influence through Shaikh Khalif to nullify the will of the late Haji Hassain Kasab by some legal excuse and allow a right for the daughter of Haji Hussain provided that her share should be mortgaged to German firm for a certain amount. If Abdul Nabi gains his object and the share of Haji Hussain^ daughter will be mortgaged to the German firm for a long period it will be a sort of sale and the son of the late Haji Hussain will never be able to turn the German firm out.

While technically no doubt, he should t)e possessed of a British exequatur for the purpose of dealing with matters In the territories of the trucial chiefs over whom His Majesty's Government exercise the rights of a . protecting Power, any infomtality under this head does not appear to Sir E s Grey to harm British interests, Moreover, M3 as His Majesty^ Government do not wish to see German power and influence enhanced and extended in the Persian Gulf, it would- appear to b«e in th^ir interest to be cent en' Jwith -bile de facto recognition of. their position which is tov all practical purposes implied in the German Consul's addressing himself to His Majesty's Resident and Consul General at Bushlre. 4. Captain Birdwood's statement in paragraph 6 of his letter to the effect that by the Bahrein Order in Council H all foreigners are specifically placed under the protection of our Political Agent' seems to show that Captain Birdwood has confused the words 'jurisdiction w and 'protection', 5.

At the time of our pleasant meeting and friendly con versation when your honour had come here in 'Lawrence' on 25th Jamadi al Akher 1332, you had informed me that the letter which was sent to me by the Amir had been submitted to the High Govern ment, that those instructions were only temporary, that the final orders in this respect shall be sent afterwards and that the orders will be conveyed to me as soon as they come. In all and good intentions circumstances I have confidence in the justice^of the Government and now again I repeat to your honour and hope from your kindness and good disposition to submit it from me to the High Government that I am not at all aiming at any other object in this matter and have no Secret purpose. I request that neither you should entertain such an idea nor should the High Government that there is a deep meaning in this matter. Alt that there is, is that as the Imir deputed unto me the jurisdiction over his subjects I am naturally responsible for them to him and it is not proper and agreeable for my Govern ment to be deprived of their rights in it. Besides, your honour might understand on account of your high wisdom that that course would do harm to my Government politically as it will be counted ■ as my descending from the Ruling capacity, I am certain that the Government would not like it and never entertain it. I always think that it is the High Government that upholds my Government and that they wish welfare and progress for my Government. And what harm does it do if the Amir be under the High Turkish Government and I do not enter with him into importantj political' V political affairs that I do not approve of. It is nothing ex cept the question of jurisdiotion over subjects and that is one of the friendly matters that always take place between the Government. If the Amir rules over my subjects in his country, will he become under ray Government? No! not so. Every one is country and in the rule of ones own independent in ^pnes own territory- I have genuine hope that the High Government will approve (of my request) when they know the real fact which no doubt you will submit to them from me.

Please see your demi-official letter of December 18tn,1916, regarding Saiyid Sadiq Hassan, If the Order in Council is to 'be 'brought into force on August 3nd ,1917, I should like to hav e him here as soon N as possible , There are obvious reasons, but I have another to urge ~ I want to get the vernacular office into orcEer before launching out on such a venture. For some months I have been 'Vorlcing with Mtrza 'Abdul Husain helped by the daftri , as up to the present I have not been able to get a second vernacular clerk, though I hope to soon. The former is, I think, doing his best as he had a fright, but as head of an office is futile. Keeping the place straight is a job like the Augean stable of old ! A second point is about Hasav/is and other Arabs with whose rulers ^p^/.Snaikh ! Isa claias to have agreements. In the recent rudder case I thought it unlikely that G-overnment v/ould have considered the question , and ^s I had to write at once to get the rudder returned , I sent the Shaikh a letter telling him that G-overnment were busy with war work etc,etc, which pacified him for the moment. The matter touches his dignity (in which I certainly sympathise with him) and I have no doubt that as soon as we broach the Order in Council he will re-open the question. Though I have not been able to study the matter sufficiently to put forward an official opinion, it seems to me the moment would be propitious for a graceful surrender of our jurisdiction , keeping only a right of intervention in an extremity of injustice, thereby ridding ourselves of an ever present cause of friction and , incid entally, of a good deal of petty litigation. It would al &amp;0 help wonderfully in smoothing over the khidmah question. Of course there are other sides to the question , but as I said above it is sure to be raised and giving then will be giving twice.

Campbell, acting political officer, xne rio.^di stated that there were certain matters of hnaineas which at his father's request he wished to put forward. These proved to 'be three in rmmb r:- (l) The Shei&amp;h of Bahrein wished to he placed on an equality with other neighbouring Sheikhs. Asked xor an example of inociuality he referred to British Jurisdiction over Arabs other than subjects of Bahrein, and to occasional intervention of the Pol» Agent to protect even Bahreinis. (2) He wished to be allowed to nominate the Bahreini members of the Meglis without any interference on the part of the Pol. Agent. He allowed the foreign members to be nominated by the Pol.Agent, which was in itself a derogation from his rights, but he thought that he ought to be left alone in the choice of his own subjects* (3) Bin Saud is going to deTelop the port of OJair (where he levies Customs duties at , and Sheikh Ssa wishes to develop the port of Zsbarah on the ftatr peninsula, which he claim3--einr- belonged to Bahrein (p.s .^azettae'vol«- ; -I p.l3S2)| _ Sheifch Abdul la was careful not to mention an;/ Political Agents by name, but he represented that his neighbours compared the position of Bahrein in respect of independence and freedom from intervention in its internal affairs unfavourably with that of say. Bin Saud and the Sheifch of Koweit. The Sheilch did not mind what people said and^sacfci: was confident of the good intentions of the British Government but at the same time he would like these things altered. He was always willing to consult the Pol.Agent^ in important matters, but thought he might be left to himself in small ones® I told him that the British Govt, was, for his purpose, thethe Govt, of India, to whom I wouia send privately a 'memorandum of what he had said, and who 9 I was sure, would consider the Sheikh's wishes sympathetically, in view of the friendly relations subsisting between taem. I hoped that the Sheikh would always speak quite frankly to the Political Agent and tell him all that was in his rnind (h© saict he id, hut was not always listened to), and I assured him that the British Grovt# had no desire to interfere with his independence for the sake of interfering or for any other purpose than was provided for by the treaties* I asked him to send in a memorandum of his points which I would send to the Government Of India privately with my own. He undertook to do so, Snd expressed himself satisfied# It would seem desirable that the Government of India should send some kind of answer to the Sheikh, for though Abdulla expressed himself with entire propriety, it was evident that he and his companions were very much in earnest. f III TLB) A.

These details have been extracted from old Residency 1, files, ^ t- 1 *' it- Oaptain, First Assistant Resident.HOTS on history of Zubarah and Claims of Shaikh of Bahrain on Zubarah, mM. From the old. Residency files I have extracted and /Tfr / precised the following: , , trrXSe- -e^f' °r in 1766/a 1 Khalifa Section of the ulab emigrants from /V Nejd, migrated from Ko.¥eit and settled in Zubarah, By 1^82 the A1 Khalifa has succeeded in establishing their supremacy ■ - . | over the whole of the Qatar peninsula, and in this year attacked the Persian Gover ;or of Bahrain and captured the i slands. From this year to 1342 there was continued fighting and confusion. in 1B42 Shaikh lbdullah of Bahrain quarrelled with his grand nephew one Moh amed bin Khalifa and drove him out of Bahrain,, Mohamed bin Khalifa went to Qatar and rebuilt the town of Zubarah which had been deserved since 1811. * In 1847 Shaikh Abdullah at the.invitation of Shaikh Esa bin Tarif of it the A1 bin Ali made an abortive attempt to o reduce Shaikh I'^hamed bin Khalifa and died the following year. ' , Apparently one Shaikh Mohamed bin Thani succeeded Shaikh Esa bin Tarif as head of the A1 bin Ali tribe during the next decade, and rose to power in the Qatar peninsula, in 1067 and 63 a series of raids and counter raids ^ between Bahrain and El Qatar ensued in which the Resident interfered and deposed the Shaikh of Bahrain Shaikh Mohamed and fined others heavily and Shaikh Ali };ii3 brother who had commanded the-forces of the Shaikh of Bahrain-was installed. Shaikh Mohamed bin Thani in 1369 signed an agreement with the Resident promising to pay Shaikh of Bahrain 9000 Krans w Zakat w a year,'to refer all disputes to the Resident and to maintain with Shaikh Ali bin Khalifa the same relations which had existed between himself and the former Shaikh of Bahrain, Thi s7 This money -vas paid for the next two or three years j /&gt; and then discontinued when the turks established fc&amp;sma&amp;Exiss themselves in El. Bida. Colonel peily decided on the occasion of this settlement that while the Bahrain chief was acknowledg ed to possess certain rights of pasturage etc on the Qatar coast, he should not be empowered to put to sea to coerce any Qatar port. # In 1839 Shaikh Ali was killed and after a short inter regnum Shaikh Esa his eldest son was made Chief of Bahrain by the British Government. From this date on r the Turks attempted to extend their influence in this part of the Arab Coast, In 1872 Shaikh Esa expressed a wish to re-establish a garrison in Zubarah and check the intrigues of his relative Nasir bin Mubarak. Colonel Ross reported to Government that in his opinion the Chief had not the power to protect the tribes residing in Qatar and had advised him to remain neutral In 1875 the Government of India definitely warned the Shaikh of Bahrain that the consequences would be upon himself if he became involved in the mainland. To this the Shaikh replied that he submitted to the orders of Government but did not consider his rights to Qatar invalid or extinct in consequence. In 1879 Shaikh Mohamed bin Thani died and Shaikh Jasim bin Thani succeeded. In 1890 Shaikh Jasim intrigued to get a Turkish garrison p in Zubarah and El Qatar and from then onward for several years negotiations passed between His Majesty's Government and the Porte to evacuate these Turkish ports. In 1895 a division of the A1 bin Ali under Shaikh Sultan bin Salama fled from Shaikh Esa to Zubarah where they were encouraged to settle by Shaikh Jasim under the Turkish flag. A naval expedition went to Zubarah and a p^^tion of the A1 bin Ali were persuaded to return to Bahrain, the others went to Mxia.Bida, In 1905 Shaikh Ahmed bin Thani who had succeeded Shaikh Jasim wished to come under the protection of the idritish GovernmentGovernment, but owing to pressure from the Foreign Office and the Ambassador at the porte, the-project of making tfa. arrangement fell through.

I fear I am not In a very good position to offer oritioiams on the three points raised 'by Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa Al Khalifah, as I have only recently taken over charge of political affatra at Bahrain. What views I do, therefore, put forward must of necessity 'be those of one lacking experience in the affairs of theselslands and I trust due allowance will 'be made for discrepencies, and possibly false conclusions. Before making any remarks on the three points raised - I should like to make some general observations on the attitude in general of Shaikh Sir Xsa bin Ali Al Khalifan and his sons as they have struck me^newly arrived as X have in Bahrain. Prom conversations 1 have had witn both bhaikh Isa and his Sons on different occasions, I gather that they are rather unnecessarily filled with ideas of their own importance The recent world talk of the ' Rights of small nations, and president Wilsons utterences regarding the policy of self determination etc, would seem to have had its etfect on the mentality of the ruling house in Bahrain. I have since my arrival been frequently reminded by Shaikh isa that 'Great Britain never interferes in our affairs' - Such pointed phrases as the 'Hakumat al Bahrain' - the 'Malika of Bahrain (the Shaikhs wife) 'Kul Dowlah fi huriatiha' etc, have become rather f/ rather common of lata. There would appear to be an idea abroad that the hand of His Majesty^ Government in future ia going to be much more ilghlly felt, and that a much larger measure of independence than heretofore ia to be granted to the Ruler of Bahrain and other Arab Rulers. This feeling has been fostered than otherwise I thinfe by the recent amendments to the Order-in-Gouncil regarding the Shaikh*a control over Subjects of neighbouring Arab States. The above being the state of mind of the Shaikh of Bahrair and his advisers I do not think one may be surprised at the three requests made by Shaikh Abdullah in London. To turn to the three points in question. ^oint 1 * The Civil Commissioner states in his Uo.1*^88 dated 30th October 1919 to Zinneremo^ London, that the matter was for all practical purposes settled when the Order—in—Council was brought into force. There are still points however over which a ruling is required. As I understand it the term 'neighbouring Arab Rulers' refers to the inhabitants of Qatar peninsula and Kejd. Is it intended to refer to the inhabitants of Oman, Kuwait, Zanzibar, Hadramant, Yemen etc the inhabitants of all which places are to be found here trading at all times? In other words are local resident subjects of tae Rulers of Oman, Kuwait, Zanzibar, Hajea,and inhabitants of Hadramant and Yemen to be considered under the jurisdiction of the shaikh of Bahrain or under that of the political Agent ? A ruling is required on this poin^ as Shaikh Isa certainly thinks he should control them. Point 2. I have nothing to say except that up to the day of his departure my predecessor was carrying on a correspon dence with the Shaikh of Bahrain over this very subject. The Shaikh had dismissed a member of the 'Majlis al Urfi M and had appointed another member ¥fithout the knowledge or approval of the Political Agent - The circumstances suggested an attempt to make a test case to see how far the political Agent would be supported. The political Agent - contended that under the Order-in- Counoil he had every right to be consulted in the matter and refusedto reoogniae 'Majlia al Urfi w until ShaiKh laa withdraw his nomination# My predaoQaaor want away at this ataga of the oriass and it haa 'bean laft for ise to aattla the tangle* 1 certainly oonaider the Order-in-Oouncil is clear on the subject and should be inaiatad on. In the meantime the Majlia al Urfia sittings have been suspended pending aettleraant of thia vexed question. Th e Question of Zub ara» Point 5 .L I have been'through a great many files on the subject and have consulted confidentially various local people } of prominence, without of courae divulging the reasons for my questions. The concluaiona I have arrived at are that it would be distinctly unwise to allow ShaiKh laa to occupy Zubara. On the following grounds: (a) Shaikh Abdullah bin Jasaim of Qatar would atrongly resent the Shaikh of Bahrain again getting a footing on the Qatar peninsula. He ia a weaker man and Zubara in the hands of Shaikh isa would be a pistol at his head always. (b) Shaikh Abdullah bin Jassim would certainly object to tha development of a new port on the peninsula of Qatar since it would at once divert all trade from Dohah (Bida) to Zuoara^ and ha would not only lose a large amount of revenue at pre sent accruing from the Customs house Al Dohah^but would atand every chance of seeing Dohah entirely disappear as the sea port of Qatar. (c) Ibn Saud similarly would take offence at a revival of the port of Zubara under Shaikh Isa r 8 jurisdiction for tHAfe like reasons to (b) above^as auch a port would mean the kill ing of his new trade cantra of O'Jair. It should be noted that tha harbour of Zubara is naturally much batter than that of either Dohah or C^Jaitr^lind with the Shaikh of Bahrain actually compelling all Bahrain trade to go to the mainland through his port of Zubara^tha end of both Abdullah bin Jasaim* a and Ibn Saud ! s porta would be certain and quick. As matters stand a good deal of coolness already exists between Ibn Saud and Shaikh laa owing to the latter having recently instituted a 5^ tax on goods paaaing through Bahrain forfor C^Jair even though such gooda never leave the Bahrain Ouatoms house. Ibn Saud contends that Shaikh Isa should only talie demurrage charges (or Arthiyah ) In my opinion the suggestion of Shaikh Isa*3 that he be allowed to revive a ten year old controversy should be nipped in the bud* The new move is obviouily an attempt to extend his power territorially and financially at the expense of Ibn Saud and Abdullah bin Jassim and will only end in trouble. Further I consider it is the thin edge of the wedge to Shaikh Isa laying afresh his claim to be ruler of the whole peninsu la of Qatar, which claim was definitely I gather quashed some fifteen years ago.

MSMORAMDUll. Reference your Memorandum Ho .32761/6/l5 dated .^lat October 1,919. My views regarding the three points raised by the Shaikh through Shaikh Abdullah are as follows» (1). In asking for equal rights with other Arab rulers the Shaikh forgets the following points;~ (a) that both he and his father were made Shaikhs by the British Government and I think it more than doubtful whether they would have retained their positions but for the support of the British Government. It results that tfce British Government is responsible for the good government of Bahrain to a greats-extent than in the case of other Arab Rulers. iC^': — (b) Thaf^ the Persian and Turkish Governments both claimed the Island as part of their respective Smpires. but for the British support doubtless one or other would have taken;Island, A (c) That the immediate cause of the British assuming charge of foreign subjects in Bahrain was the tyrannical behaviour of the Shaikh and his relatives to Persian subjects aMi culminating an attack on them in 1904: this was followed almost immediately by an assault on the German representative of Wonckhaus and Go,, .but for our intervention the Shaikh would have been involved with Persia and Germany. (d)/ss- (d) That his Groverament is singularly inefficient and weAk and is not nearly as good as tiaa most of the other Shaikhs, its tendency is to exploit the Islands/ind their inhabitants for the benefit of the A1 Khalifa and In the circumstances it is hardly to be expected that the Shaikh of Bahrain should be on exactly the sane footing as tther Arab Chiefs. As regards the question of subjects of Arab states, the file about the Bahrain Order in Council is not here at present, so I cannot refresh my memory. My recollection fesnrnz?** however is that the whole difficulty was about Hassawis and Kataris from the mainland i.e. Arabs of immediately neighbouring States, I do not think it was intended that Muscatis, Handrama&amp;tis, Yemanis etc should be handed over to the Shaikhs jurisdiction. HSJ ■ think the Sultan of .;!u^^a contemplates such a thing as this. Muscatis coming with claims to Bahrain generally get a letter from the Political Agent Muscat at the request of the Sultan. Bin Baud in many of his letters to the Political Agent asks the latter to look after his subjects. and apparently does not contemplate their being dealt with by ' the shaikh. In the circumstances I think that before handing our jurisdiction over Kuwaitis, Muscatis, Handraraanti8,Yemanis eteethe Shaifeh^should be asked to produce his agreements with the j-ttan of these places. (2). it has hitherto always been recognized that the Arab representatives in the Majlis are appointed by the Shaikh,subject to the approval of the Political Agent as representative of the Protecting power. I think this practice should be continued. The Political Agent would never disapprove ^ fiiPl:/ suitable man &gt; and the Shaikh has only to refrain from appointing thorough ly objectionable persons^ to enjoy practical freedom from interference in the matter of his nominees to the Majlis, The procedure is recognized in the Order-in-Council .and should, I think, be maintained. (3). Zubarah — a note has already been submitted by the First one or two leading Arab fami 1 ies . ^ Assi stantAssistant Resident during ray absenoe on tour, which feals with the historical aspect of the question. As far back as 1371 the Government of India instructed the Resident to^^w^^Shaikh of Bahrain from interfering with mainland of Katr on account of the doubtful character of his ■ alleged rights and influence, - and this was repeated in 1875 Gulf (p,905 Gazetteer of Persian/ and foot note). In 1895 the Al bin Ali occupied Zubarah and would actually invaded havaBahrain, if their fleet had not been destroyed. by British Gun-boats (see pages 983-925 Gazetteer of Persian - i :■ \ \ Gulf) ' In the circumstances/we should continue to refuse to pay attention to shaikh Isa^ pretensions to Zubarah, I doubt if Zubarah is much good as a port, being very anallow, l7V &lt;2-7 but it is probably as good (4-t« . rather bad) as Uohab and Ojair, and I think the P 0 litical Agent Bahrain is quite right in his view -en to the probable effect of the creation of a poli't there on Bin Saud and shaikh Abdullah bin |asira # In conclusion I may add that I agree with the political Agont in thinking that recent utterances by President Wilson •' ,;v\ have had a bad effect on Shaikh Isa and Shaikh Abdullah as on so many other people all over the world. Shaikh Abdullah's recent visit to Europe has doubtless increased Shaikh IsaVs idea of his own importance.

Note on Sistory of Zuhara and Claims of Shaikh of JBahrein to Zubctva. From the old Residency files I have extracted and precised the follow ing : In 1766 A1 Khalifa Section of the tribe of Utah emigrants from Nejd migrated from Koweit and settled in Zubara. By 1782 the A1 Khalifa has succeeded in establishing their supremacy over the whole of the Qatar peninsula and in this year attacked the Persian Governor of Bahrein and captured the island. From this year to 1842 there was continued fighting and confusion. In 1812 Shaikh Abdullah of Bahrein quarrelled with his grand nephew, one Mohammad bin Khalifa, and drove him out of Bahrein. Mohammed bin Khalifa went to Qatar and rebuilt the town of Zubara which had been deserted since 1811. In 1847 Shaikh Abdullah, at the invitation of Shaikh 'Isa bin Tarif of the A1 bin Ali, made an abortive attempt to reduce Shaikh Mohamed bin Khalifa and died the following year. Apparently one Shaikh Mohamed bin Thani succeeded Shaikh 'Isa bin Tarif as head of the A1 bin Ali tribe during the next decade, and rose to power in the Qatar peninsula. In 1867 and 1868 a series of raids and counter-raids between Bahrein and El Qatar ensued in which the Resident interfered and deposed the- Shaikh of Bah rein Shaikh Mohamed and fined others heavily and Shaikh Ali, his brother, who had commanded the forces of the Shaikh of Bahrein, was installed. Shaikh Mohamed bin Thani in 18ti9 signed an agreement with the Resident promising to pay Shaikh of Bahrein 9,000 Krans 'Zakat ' a year, to refer all disputes to the Resident and to maintain with Shaikh Ali bin Khalifa the same relations which had existed between himself and the former Shaikh of Bahrain. This money was paid for the next two or three years and then discontinued when the Turks established themselves in El Bida. Colonel Pelly decided on the occasion of this settlement that while the Bahrein Chief was acknowledged to possess certain rights of pasturage, etc., on the Qatar coast, he should not be empowered to put to sea to coerce any Qatar port. In 1869 Shaikh Ali was killed and after a short interregnum Shaikh 'Isa his eldest son, was made Chief of Bahrein by the British Government. From this date on, the Turks attempted to extend their influence in this part of the Arab Coast. *Serial No. 3. Note on Claim of Shaikh of Bahrein to Zubara.

Colonel Ross re ported to C-rovemment that in his opinion the Chief had not the power to pro tect the tribes residing in Qatar and ha &lt;i advised him 10 remain neutral. In 1875 the Government of India definitely warned the Shaikh of Bahrein that the consequences would be upon himself if he became involved in the mainland. To this the Shaikh replied that he submitted to the orders of Government, frut did not consider his l ights to Qatar invalid or extinct'in consequence. In 1879 Shaikh Mohamed bin Thani died and Shaikh Jasim bin Thani succeeded. In 1890 Shaikh Jasim intrigued to get a Turkish garrison in Zubiira and El Qatar and from then onward for several years negotiations passed between Bis Majesty's Government and the Porte to evacuate these Turkish ports. In 1895 a division of thd A1 bin Ali under Shaikh Sultan bin Salama tied from Shaikh 'Isa to Zubara where they were encouraged to settle by Shaikh Jasim under the Turkish flag. A naval expedition went to Zubaia and a por tion of the AI bin Ali were persuaded to return to Bahrein, the others went to Bida. In 190' Shaikh Ahmad bin Thani, who had succeeded Shaikh Jasirn, wished to come under the protection of the British Government, but, owing to pressure from the Foreign Office and the Ambassador at the Porte, the project of making the arrangement fell through. Metnorandum No. 176 ; dated Bahrein, the 6th December 1919, (Confidential.) From— Major H. R. P. Dickson , C.I.E., Political Agent, Bahrein, To—The Deputy Political Resident, Bushire. Beference the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad's No. dated 31st October 19J9, copy to me. I fear I am not,in a very good position to offer criticisms on the three points raised by Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa al Khalifah, as I have only recently taken over charge of political affairs at Bahrein. What views I do, therefore, put forward must of necessity be those of one lacking experience in the affairs of the Islands and I trust due allowance will be made for discrepan cies, and possibly false conclusions. Before making any remarks on the three points raised, I should like to make some general observations on the attitude in general of Shaikh Sir Isa bin Ali al Khalifah and his sons as they have struck me newly arrived as I have in Bahrein. Prom conversations I have had with both Shaikh 'Isa and his sons on different occasions, I gather that ihey are rather unnecessarily filled with ideas of their own importance. The recent world talk of the ' Bights of small nations' and President Wilson's utterances regarding the policy of self-determination, etc., would seem to have had its effect on the mentality of the ruling house in Bahrein. I have since my arrival been frequently reminded by Shaikh Isa that ' Great Britain never interferes in our affairs'*—such pointed phrases as the ' Hakumat al Bahrein''—the u Malika of Bahrein ' (the Shaikh's wife) ** Kul Dowlah fi huriatiha,' etc., have become rather common of late. There would appear to be an idea abroad that the hand of His Majesty's Government in future is going to be much more lightly felt, and that a much larger measure of in dependence than heretofore is to be granted to the Euler of Bahrein and other Arab Bulers. This feeling has been fostered than otherwise I think by the recent amendments to the Order-in-Council regarding the Shaikh's control over subjects of neighbouring Arab States. D. M. PHASER, Ist Assistant Resident.20 The above being the state of mind of the Shaikh of Bahrein and his advisers, I do not think one may be surprised at the three requests made by Shaikh Abdullah in London. To turn to the three points in question. Point 1 —The Civil Commissioner states in his No. 1^988, dated 30th October 1919. to ' Zinneremo,' London, that the matter was for all practical purposes settled when the Order-in-Council was brought into force. There are still points, however, over which a ruling is required. As I understand it, the term 'neighbouring Arab Eulers ' refers to the inhabitants of Qatar Peninsula and Nejd. is it intended to refer to the inhabitants of Oman, Kuwait, Zanzibar, Hadramant, Yemen, etc.. thf inhabitants of all w r hich places are to be found here trading at all times ? In other words are local resident subjects of the Rulers of Oman, Kuwaif, Zanzibar, Hejaz and inhabitants of Hadramant and Yemen to be considered under the jurisdiction of the Shaikh of Bahrein or under that of the Political Agent? A ruling is required on this point as Shaikh 'Isa certainly thinks he should control them. Point 2. —I have nothing to say except that up to the day of his depar ture, my predecessor was carrying on a correspondence with the Shaikh of Bahrein over this very subject. The Shaikh had dismissed a member of the ' Majlis-alTJrfi ' and had appointed another member without the knowledge or approv al of ihe Political Agent. The circumstances suggested an attempt to make a tesb case to see how far the Political Agent would be supported. The Political Agent contended that under the Order-in-Couneil he had every right to be consulted in the matter and refused to recognise ' Majlis- al-Urfi' until Shaikh 'Isa withdrew his nomination. My predecessor went away at this stage of the crises and it has been left for me to settle the tangle. I certainly consider the Order-in-Council is clear on the subjec' and should be insisted on. In the meantime the Majlis-al-TJrfi's sittings have been sus pended pending settlement of this vexed question. Point 3. The qupsfion of Zuhara. —I have been through a great tnany files on the subject and have consulted contiflentially various local people of prominence, without, of course, divulging the reasons for my questions. The conclusions I have arrived at are that it would be distinctly unwise to allow Shikh Isa to occupy Zubara. On the following grounds :— {a) Shaikh Abdullah bin Jassim of Qatar would strongly resent the Shaikh of Bahrein again getting a footing on the Qatar peninsula. He is a weaker man and Zubara in the hands of Shaikh Isa would be a pistol at his head always. (&amp;) Shaikh Abdullah bin Jassim would certainly object to the develop ment of a new port on the peninsula of Qatar since it would at once divert all trade from Dohad (Bida) to Zubara and he would not only lose a large amount of revenue at present accruing from the Customs House A1 Dohah, but would stand every chance of seeing Dohah entirely disappear as the seaport of Qatar. {c) Ibn Saud similarly would take offence at a revival of the port of Zubara under Shaikh Isa's jurisdiction for like reasons to (6) above, as such a port would mean the killing of his new trade centre of O'Jair. It should be noted that the harbour of Zubara is naturally much better than that of either Pohah or O'Jair, and with the Shaikh of Bahrein actually compelling all Bahrein trade to go to the mainland through his port of Zubara, the end of both Abdullah bin Jassim's and Ibn Saud's ports would be certain and quick. As matters stand a good deal of coolness already exists between Ibn Saud and Shaikh Isa owing to tjie latter having recently instituted a 5 per cent, tax on goods passing through Bahrain for O'Jair even though such goods never leave the Bahrein Customs House. Ibn Saud contends that~ Shaikh Isa should only take demurrage charges (or Arthiyeh). In my opinion the suggestion of Shaikh Isa's that he be allowed to revive a ten-year-old controversy should be nipped in the bud. The new move is21 obviously an attempt to extend his power territorially and financially at the expense of Ihn Saud and Abdullah bin Jassim and will only end in trouble. Further I consider it is the thin edge of the wedge to Shaikh Isa laying^ airesh his claim to be ruler of the whole peninsula of Qatar, which claim was definitely I gather quashed some fifteen years ago. '• j I attach a small sketch map to illustrate my remarks regarding Zubara. Kegarding point 4. I have no remarks to make.

As to the second request I am to point out that the pro cedure for the selection of members of the llajlis al Urfi is laid down in the Bahrain Order-in-Council which was promulgated by order of Iiis Majesty the King Emperor and it is not within the competence of the Government of India to alter this procedure. • j- ' * But it is understood that the Arab representatives in the T a.ilis . are m practice always appointed by your father and though this appointment is subject to the approval of the Political Agent as . representative - o?: t e protecting Power, you may be rest assumed that the* Political Agent will never disapprove of any proper selection and will not interfere without just cause.With regard to the openwig of a port at Zubarah, you are , aware that this question is an old one and has in the rast received rauoh consideration. It has again been carefully examined, and I ar^ to express regret that in view of the many difficulties which exist ? the Government of India do not see their way to permit and assist your father to carry out this project. Your fouth reque,st is to be given the privilege of direct reference to Hi's ^a.jesty^ government in London. It is known to you that the political relations of Bahrain are conducted with the Government of-India and it is therefore, appropriate that the Govennment of India and not His Majesty f s Government should be addressed by your father.

MEMORANDUM: - I have, to acknowledge your No. 174 dated 8th June 19P.0 an original letter from the Secretary fo the Government of India to Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa, also copy of a covering letter from Mr. Cater. As regards the wording of the actual letter. I have only one suggestion to make. In para 2, eighth line, reply to first question of Shaikh Abdullah, before the word'agreements' I should like to see the word'formal' inserted. Do you think the Government of India would object to my inserting this word in the original letter. Perhaps you on your own authority could authorise the correction. If not, in order :■ .to save time, I suggest the question might be put telegraphically to India. My reasons for asking that the word ^formal' be inserted will, I think, be understood by you, as you have yourself had much experience of Shaikh Isa and his ways. I am anxious to have the question of jurisdiction put on a defiiEite footing once and for all. Government of India's letter in question is, I can see, going to be of great importance to future Political Agents, for reference purposes. I am anxiohs that there should be no room for any future misunderstanding; left as it is the word ' agreements' will give Shaikh Isa an opportunity for 'trotting' out any and every small friendly M letter from some Foreign ruler or other and claiming it as an agreement. I want to avo|d such a contingency and rant to/fx to get him to produce formal treaties and agreements only. o Hence I ask that the word formal roey be mcertea. Pending an answer from you, which I should like telegraphically, if possible, I sh9.ll not present the letter to Shaikh Abdullah.

Shaikh Isa 'bin All al-Ehalifah, the Ruler of Bahrain has 'been very persistent of late in ignoring para 2 of ... Government of India's letter No. 1145-E.A. dated 5th May 1920, which finally lays down that all subjects of Foreign Arab Rulers residing in Bahrain should come under the Jurisdiction of this Agency, unless such Rulers possess a definite and foimal treaty to the opposite effect. 2. Shaikh. Isa, I fear, also has not been too open in his methods, ^e has been seceretly informing foreigners etc: that they should always take their cases to him or his sons for settlement. This, of course, is hard to prove, but is done by means of 'Pidawis' etc: • These methods of the Ruler have led to one of two awakward, not to say unpleasant, incidents recently. Poreign Arabs for instance have taken their case to one of Shaikh Isa f s courts and not having received justice, they have come running to the Agency, and have claimed Government's protection and retrial of their case by myself. Much correspondence and unpleasantness has resulted for invariably Shaikh Isa knowing he has been wrong in the first instance has endeavoured to justify his conduct by trying to prove the person or persons involved to be subjects of his. 3. The whole question of jursidiction is, apart from ♦ the letter mentioned in para(l) very clearly put in His Majesty 1 s Government's order in Council, para 8. 4. „ order to remove all chances of misunderstanding in future both in the minds of the public and in tirat of the Ruler,I have today written 2 letters 'A' &amp; 'B' to Shaikh Isa and have published a notice to the people' of Hanamah,sending copy of the same to Shaikh Isa. Por your information I am sending you English trans lation of letters 'A' &amp; f, E ,f and 'notice'.5.

I also have to inform your honour that at | my interview with Ool.Trevor on his last visit to Bahrain, His honour made it quite clear to me that the Political Agent, would not hear any complaints whatsoever from any of the subjects of the Ruler of Bahrain. I have a hope in your honour that you will preserve the rights of your friend and that in future you will enquire into the nationality of ever^ complainant who comes to you f before taking up a case ,.,. ),for such are always the cause of misunderstanding. I May you be preserved. ''''''''''' ; .(W 166 Copy of a letter No.387 /y .O. dated 2^th November 1920 from the Political Agent,Bahrain to H.E.Shaikh Sir Isa,Ruler of Bahrain, | J| After compliments, Reference your letter dated 7th Rabi-al-awal complain ing that I had taken up the caee of ( l) The woman Latifah, 'i (2^ The case of the crew of Nakhuda Abdullah bin Saif, i if in their complaint against their Nakhuda above mentioned, both of which cases you complained ought to have been sent before you,on the grounds that ( 1) the woman Latifah was a subject of your Excellency (2) that the man Abdullah bin Saif was also a subject V •• of your Excellency. I was greatly surprised and pained to receive such a letter from your Excellency,as it shows once more that your Excellency is only too ready to listen to the advise and 'i talk of people who for ever are endeavouring to spoil the good relations that exist and have existed for so long betwwen your Excellency and this Agency. I had occasion to report to His Honour the Resident in the Persian Gulf some time back that it was a matter of the greatest regret,that your Excellency was so prone to listen to men whose only ' object was to create unfriendly feeling between myself and your Excellency. It is with feeling cf sorrow that I see your Excellency has not seen fit to take to heart the advise of the Resident on the subject as written to you in his letter No.4^9 dated 29th August 1920. In order to show that I am not speaking idle words, I propose now to point out to you the real facts of the two cases complained of. FIRST CASE . The woman Latifah came to my court and complained against a servant of Shaikh Hamad and others the nature of herirflw ^•~-l£aSUSSSSL A r&gt; zm I i I 4 | M\ i )!&gt; j i her complaint being that she^ a white woman and free was 'being sold i ro^ one man to another. The woman stated she was the subject of Bin Saud,the Ruler of Nejd. It was obvious to your friend that the case ought to go Eharia. I therefore passed orders according to the usual custom that she and the parties complained against should be sent to Shaikh Jasira bin Mehza the Qazi. According to usual custom also I asked the Amir of Muharraq. to send the accused round to the Agency in order that they and the woman should be taken to the Qazi's court. The Amir however sent me a perfwctly correct letter,in which he pointed out the woman Latifah was a proved subject of your Excellency. Having read the Amir's letter and satisfied myself that the Amir's statement was correct, I immediately sent the woman off to him with the request that he would settle the case before your Excellency's courts. SECOND CASE . This matter came up before me about two months ago It was a complaint on the part of 10 sailors agaiiist thai] ^ | their Nakhuda Ahdulla hin Saif. The charge was one of cruelty and beating. The complainants were all men from Hassa and were subjects of Bin Saud and so came directly ' .] under the protection of this Agency,see Government of India's letter No. 1145 E.A. dated 5th May 1920 para-2. ! The accused hearing that a complaint was lodged against him of his own free will and without my sending i for him in any way,come with the men,I was about to send the case to the Salifah court according to custom, when the acoueed voluntarily asked if the matter could be postponed till after the 'Guffal'. The petitioners agreed to do this.provided the Nakhuda gave them a sanad that he would no longer beat them. The Nakhuda at once did so,out-of court I believe,and all parties were satisfied. The men have now come up again ( the Guffal being finished ) to have their case settled. The Nakhuda I have not yet seen. The case as usual will be sent to the Salifah court.In both oases,therefore,I fail• f / ^3 •f J I fail to i-nder^tand where thie Agency has acted contrary to the orders or spirit of His Majesty's Order in Council. , I much regret having to write such a long letter. But it has been necessary to do so,to prove once more to your Excellency,that the Agency has made no mistake,and that the mistake lies with those who have falsely reported the cases to your Excellency. It does prove to me,however,that your Excellency can rot entertain very friendly fee]ings for myself,the Representative of His Majesty's Government in Bahrain, if you listen to the false talk of every mischief maker that comes along. It would have been more fitting and Signified if your Excellency hafl either asked this Agency for a report on the case,or better still if you had sent Shaikh Abdullah,your son,to see me privately. In the latter case I could have cleared up the matter at once. Finally with reference to your Excellency s statement that Col.Trevor promised that the Political Agent,Bahrain should not receive any complaint at all from your Excellency^e subjects. As explained above this has no connection with the present case,bt;t as your Excellency does not appear to be quite clear as to the provisions of 'His Majesty's Bahrain Order in Council' on this very subject, I would point out that normally speaking the Political*Agent has instructions not to interfere in complaints brought to him by your Excellency's subjects.

Shaikh Isa,I fear,also has not been too open in his Methods. He has been secretly informing foreigners etc that * they should always take their cases to him or his sons for settlement. This,of course,is hard to prove,but tktM is done by means of ** Fidawis * etc. These methods of the Ruler have led to one or two awkward / not to say unpleasant^, incidents recently# Foreign Arabs for instance have taken their case to one of Shaikh Isa's counts and not having received justice, they have come running to the Agency, and have claimed Govern- y of their case ' ment's protection,and retria}/by myself. Wuch correspondence and unpleasantness has resulted^for invariably Shaikh Isa knowing he has been wrong in the first instance hat^endavoured to justify his conduct by trying to prove the person or per-, sons involved to be subjects of his. 3. , The whole question of jurisdiction is apart from the letter mentioned in para ( l) very clearly put in His Majesty f s Governments order in Council para 8o 4.

After compliments* eference your letter dated 7th Rabi-al-Awwal, complain ing tnat I had taken up the case of (1) The woman Latifa, (2) The case of the crew of tks Nakhuda Abdullah bin Saif, in their complaint against their Naihuda ahove mentioned, hoth of which oases you complained ought to have heen sent before you, on the grounds that (1) the woman Latifa was a subject of your Excellency (2) tnat the man Abdullah bin Saif was also a subject of [ your Excellency. I was greatly surprised and pained to receiye such a setter ... rom your Excellency, as it shows once more that your Excellency is only too ready to is listen to the advise and talk of people who for ever are endeavouring to spoil the good relations that exist and have existed for so long between your Excellency and this Agency. I had occasion to report to His Honour the Resident in the Persian Gulf some time back that it was a matter of the greatest regret, that your was Excellency/so prone to listen to men whose only object was to i create unfriendly feeling between myself and your Excellency. 1 It is with feeling of sorrow that I see your Excellency has 3 not seen fit to take to heart the adifte of the Resident on the subject as written to you in his letter Ho. 439 dated 29th August 1920. In order to show that I am not speaking idle words, I propose now to point out to you the real facts of the two cases complained of. FIRST CARTi!. The woman Latifa came to my court and complained against a servant of Shaikh Hamad and others the nature oJ^er complaint'being ' v.' ' complaint/that she a white woman and free was heing sold from one man to another. The woman stated she was the subject of Bin Saud, the Ruler of Nejd. It was obvious to your friend that the case ought to go tfb Sharia. I therefore passed orders according to the usual custom that she and the parties complained against should be sent to Shaikh Jasim bin Mehza viie Qa^i • According to usual custom also I asked the Amir of Muharraq to send the acc^used round to the Agency in order that they and the woman should be taken to the Qazi^s court. The Amir however sent me a perfectly correct letter, in which he pointed out the woman Latifa was a proved subject of your Excellency* Having read the Amir f s letter and satisfied myself that the Amir^s statement was correct, T immediately sent the woman off to him with the request that he would settle the case before your Excellency's courts. SECOND CASE. This matter came up before me about two months ago. It was a complaint on the part of 12 sailors against their Hakhuda Abdullah bin Saif. The charge was. one of cruelty and beating. The complainants were all men from Hassa and were subjects of -i-dn Saud and so came directly under the protection of this Agency, see Government of India's letter -No. 1145 E.A. dated : 5th May 1920 para 2. The accused nearing that a complaint was lodged against him of his own free will and without my sending for^him in any way, came with the men, I was about to send the case to the Salifah Court according to custom, when the accused voluntarily asked if the matter could be postponed till after the 'Guffal'. The petitioners agreed to do this , provided the Kakhuda gave them a sanad that he would no longer beat them. The Nkhuda h at once did so,out ot court I believe, and all parties were satisfied. The jnen have now come up again ( the Guffal being fin/ished ) to have their case settled. The Nakhuda I have not yet seen. The case as usual will be sent to the Salifah Court. Invc (T?^) ^ 1 /. In 'both cases, therefore, I fail to sss understand where this Agency Has acted contrary to the orders or spirit of His Majesty's Order in Council. I much regret having to write such a long letter. But it has 'been necessary to do so, to prove once more to your Excellency, that the Agency has made no mistake, and that the mistake lies ■ r with those who have falsely reported the cases to your Excellency. It does prove to me,however, that your Excellency can ve not entertain very friendly feelings for myself, the Representati^ of His Majesty's Government in Bahrain, if you listen to the false talk of every mischief maker that comes along. It would have been more fitting and Signified if your Excellency had either asked this Agency for a report on the case, or better ^till if you had sent Shaikh Abdullah, youfson, to see me privately. In the latter case I could have cleared up the matter at once. Finally with reference to your Excellency's statement that Col. Trevor promised that the Political Agent, Bahrain should not receive any complaints at all from your Excellency's subjects. As explained above this has no connection with the present case, but as your Excellency does not appear to be quite clear as to the provisions of'His Majesty's ''ahrain Order in Council' on this very subject, I would point out that normally speaking the Political Agent has instructions not to interfere in complaints brought to him by your Excelleny's subjects. Should, however, he consider that any Bahrain subject is being treated with gross injustice or is being persecuted, he has the right to step in i at all times and take whatever action he considers necessary 5 under Section Ho. 74 'Order in Council'. I am sending a copy of this letter together with a copy of your Excellency's letter to the Political Resident for information. .

I would again refer your Excellency to the letter of His Majesty^ Government No. 1145-5.A,dated 5th May 1920 para 2 which deals with this very subject. The paragraph reads as follows:- I am directed to ini orm you that the Government of India have given thess re^sta thsir most careful consideration and I am to make the following reply;- 'I am to sxprass rsgrst that it is impoasibla for the Govern- msnt of India to aoosds to the request that your father snould exoeroiss Jurisdiction oyer the subjects of other Arab Rulers residing in -pahrain unless the Rulers concerned themselves maice i ormal agreements to this effect.' From the above it must now be quite clear to your Excellency that apart from Persian Subjects and others and all subjects of foreign Arab States namely subjects of Nejd, Has sa, .Tuba il, Qatif, Qa tar ,Kuwa i t, Dubs, i,Abu nhabi, Shargafc, Muscat and dependencies,Hadramaut,Yemen, Hejaz .Zanzibar, Soootra etc, now come under the jurisdiction of this Agency whilst resident in Bahrain^ seeing that the rulers of the above mentioned states have no formal treatries to a contrary effect with your Excellency. 1 4 In order also that there may be no doubt whatsoever in the minds of the people of Bahrain as to who ar-5 and who are not under the jurisdiction and control of this Agency whilst resident in Bahrain, I propose publishing a notice to the above effect. i / I am sending a copy of this letter ,and copy of notice to be issued t® the Resident for information.19/109 . 1 - IS Telegram•Code• Prom - political, B ahrain.

In this connection I would x&gt;oint out th?--t Pfif isd- wfl £ tfyr' the practice is continued by the Persian Pa soort authorltl of i 'suing passports for Bahrain as for an inland port of Persia and the passport holder has to lodge a deposit .This deposit is not refundable be 'ore he sends his 'Pass* back, with an endorsement to shew that he has duly arrived in Bahrain. oome years ?igo such passes were endorsed by one Ha,ji •Abdur Habi t but he was warned to oease doing so,^. orders were ultimately passed by H.M.G. for his r:.imoval from Bahrain. It is not loiown why these orders were not carried out at the time The individual,although he no longer endorses passports, continues to cause every troublr he c«n and has had to be severely cautioned by nearly every Political Agent who h- s been here. The position as regards these pa ses now is that tnay are endorsed by the Political .gent to the effect that t'Tie holder arrived in Bahrain. It would seem that we ' re in so doing placing ourselves in a somewhat invidious position, and ? cting as part of the Persian ?a -sport system.Fe endorse passes,plainly marked 'From one iManwi±?acxtintemal port to another 1 and charge no fee ¥/hatsoever.There is a very conside )able amount of clerical Irbour involved,since the number of such Tezkereh pat ses issued is great. yAlthough wo ara raaponsibla in Bahrain for Persians,who while hare life i ere under British protection,yet we have no control whatsoever over Persians entering Bahrain.As a result it has become a happy hunting ground for undesirables who find a temporary absence from Persia desirable for their own interests. Such persona are the cause of a good deal of pe^ty crime and can be used at all times by unscrupul ous persona for crime and intrigue. It would seem desirable that inasmuch as Persians while in Bahrain sre under British protection, that they should be required to take out a passport to come to Bahrain,in the same way that British Indian subjects and others take out passports .An Identity certificate would probacy suffice, and could be issued by H.M^s consuls in Persia,who could collect the usual fees,which would seem a Justified source of Revenue to H.M. Government. 3uch a procedure would place beyond doutrtbt the position of Great Britain in Bahrain vis-a- vis Persia. At present the Persian Grovernment issuespasses and takesHevenue thereon permitting their subjects to visit Bahrain,where we are responsible for them,without our concurrence and moreover we serve them by sndorsing such passes without fee # thereby allowing a peocedure to become customary which might in the future give Persia an excuse for claiming a special position in regard to Bahrain.

Memorandum.# I have mentioned to you that the behaviour of the Sultan* of Uajd *3 agent here has A somewhat unsatisfactory .An incident has re cently occurrxed from which it id fairly obvious the he places his personal considerations before those of Bin aaud,and is inclined to abuse his influence and the use of Bin Saud's name. Shortly after I first arrived here,nearly all the merchants of Bahrain came and protested against a customs regulation,by which all except Qosaibi^and about one other Uajd merchant,were prohibited from benixitting tfcpom the reduced customs charges on goods for transhipment to Qatif and Ojair* This in fact conferred on him the monopoly of the trade since noone else / paying full customs, rates could compete with him. On going into the matter I discovered that it was due to the customs officials having misunderstood instructions issued by you, when the new scheme was introduced,and was obviously an error# The matter was therefore put right and the reduiced charges brought into force on all genuine transhipped consignments. This naturally affected Khan Bahadur Qosaibi,who came to me in a state of excitement and adopted a threatening tone and was altogether extremely rude. He said Bin Saud should hear about it &amp; he was sure he would not put up with it etc. I explained that the matter in no way affected Bin Saud except to stimulate trade and competition as regards imports into %jd which was^ highly to his benifit,and that under no circumstances could I ateit Qosaibi to drag Bin 3aud into Bahrain affairs purely because he personally did not lilce a customs regulation which was fair to all, and did not give him personally an unfair advantage over others. He took the hint and since then has always been more polite,although ~ as in the matter of the Pallnurus' visit to Qatif f he seldom tries to help,^ on that occasion would undoubtedly have put obstacles in the way,had I not personally gone to see the Amir of Qatif,a visit of Which Cjoaaibi aid not approve.He is not deairoas of a port being opened/ / / / I (A on the mainland because he has practically the monopoly of the &gt;• ^ carrying trade between here at O^air and owns a number of boats© The brothers Qosalbi f one of whom lives in Hiassa f one here^nd one in Bombay,have come into prominence only since the sobsidy has been paid to Bin Sand. They draw his subsidy and mange his money affairs, and in the last few years have acquired great influence in Na^d and considerable wealth»Qosaibi now ranks only after Yusuf ICanoo in wealth,and is rapidly gaining on him. There is little doubt that Z,B # Abdul Aziz QoBaibi aspires to become recognised as Bin Sand's Consul here.It is reported to me that lately the common Najdis here openly refer to him as their Consul. Fahad A1 Bassam,a well known Ka^di.said to me recently 'Qosaibi'is above the law,he considers he is a consul 1 • About a fortnight ago,the servant of a ITajd merchant called Abdulla ^was^n away from his master and is said to have stolen some things.He went and slept in the GrO -Bown of Qosaibio Abdulla Hawaa followed him there &amp; had an altercation. Qosaibi has long been on bad terms with A.H. and seized the opportunity to.up- raid him.The following day they met in Yusuf ICanoo^ house and Qosaibi behaved badly and. tried several times to strike A.H. but ' as prevented ♦Meanwhile he had despatched his brother Hassan to collect ajl the Naj'di roughd to come and beat A.H. Mohomad Sharif and others intervened and stopped a fracas. Both parties then wanted to come to me to settle their dispute.but Y.K. persuaded them not to &amp; in a half hearted way tried to patch up a peace which neither party agreed to# Qosaibi then wrote off to Bin Jiluwi,and caused the latter to send some Fidawis and a letter to me asking me to order A. Hawas at once to proceed to Hassa. This put me in an invidious position.lt was believed here that when he got there he might be 4 unjustly treated owing toi the influence of the QosaibiSf jand moreove: to arrest a person,who in Bahrain is under the protection of the Agency,on a matter which occurred in Bahrain,at the order ox ^iJ&gt; Jiluwi,would have been tantamount to admitting that Bin Jiluwi was a sort of Appellate Court and could at any time interfere in Bahrain affairs. I tried to get over the difficulty by patching up theI m t il 77 r A V quarrel bat Qosaibi was most unreasonable and insfted on such humiliating terms that itnwas impossible for A. H. to agree.He further insisted that in any case A.H. must proceed to Hassa to / propitiate Bin Jiluwi who was very angry with him # as he had insulted] the Saltan's representative. I pointed oat fc&amp;fct the quarrel vas a personal one, and took place he re,and that it was scarcely conceivable that Bin Jiluwi should have a personal bias against either party un- mis- less the affair had been represented to him,and in any case would surely be satisfied if both parties wrote that they had made peace. Qosaibi would in no way agree^and as it was throughout obvious that his one desire was to get AoH. to Hassa where he could ill treat him I thought it better to be clear ofttthe matter, and ^dropped it« I /wrote to Bin Jiluwi,that inasmuch as the affftrrto&amp;k place here,and the parties had not officially approached me,but had of their own accord referred to him,I did not care to interfere in any way.In all other matters I was always pleased to assist as he had had ample proof in the past. It was further difficult for me to take part against one party only when I knew both to be at fault. . After this Qosaibi got frightened,and ran about accusing everybody including myself of not having striven whole heartedly for peace. The only obstacle to peace was himself. By this time nobody would SB assist him and he was too proud to climb down by himself. Meanwhile A.Hawas wentia off of his own accord to Hassa to place his case before Bin Jiluwi ♦Qosaibi heMd of this and sent a boat after him.They caught him at Ojair ,publicly beat him and started him off to Hassa with a rope around his neck.This before any inquiry, and obviously at Qosaibls instigation. Everybody is very annoyed with Qosaibi,but as is customary no-one has the mor* 1 courage to say so, to his face^ so that he will probably assume that public opinion is with him and be the more difficult to deal with in future. During conversation with him,he told me that I was BinSaud's T Naib T in Bahrain where Hajdi's were concemed^I disabused him of this &amp; said I was under the orders of yourself only,and afforded British protectionto Najdis in Bahrain ,since iiin Baud had requested this assistance of ffovemment,which was ranjtaered quite f r aev anaf' Jt ' i» . 7 rj / I9;uj t : : 0 &amp; I OTWN •DOB at some inconvenience,purely out of friendship for Bin 3aud, He then admitted that ^ajdis here would be in a sorry plight if not under British protection. I have reported this somwwk^t domestic matter lengthily,because it is not impossible that Qosaibi will try to make Bin Jiluwi believe he has been lightly dealt with,and in any case I rather anticipate that sooner or later the Political gent here will have to have Qosaibi*s position clearly defined and it might be well to have this on record* h .Jor.

The Director of Customs at Lingah has sent the Karguzar a copy of. a telegram received by him from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs to the effect that all Bahrain people are Persian subjects and are to be given Persian passports. Just before my departure from Lingah I understand that the Karguzar himself received a letter from Bushire to the same Irfff effect with the addition that no Bahrain! should be allowed to enter or leave Lingah except if in possession of, a Persian passport. The Karguzar also stated that he was informed that Yamin-ul-Mamalefe had discussed the matter with you, and it was inferred that you had agreed to this. I did my utmost to persuade both the Director of Customs and the Karguzar to allow a Bahrain subject to proceed without a Persian pass but each department is afraid of the other reporting its departure from these instructions, and the Karguzar is not really willing to help. The impending visit of Yamin-ul-Mama 1 elc makes them more than usually nervous of infringing any rule. If only one department was concerned, I think I might have been able to arrange'it, but in the present circumstances I have found.it quite impossible to do so. The prospect of retaliatory measures being taken on the other coast does not appear to interest the officials cone cerned, as they would not suffer from them personally, and do not seem to be actuated by any patriotic motives. between There is a steady flow of Bahrain subjects ^Bahrain and Lingah, and if the present situation continues, these will all be subjected to great inconvenience, and in some cases,.■r^~ (ivs oases, actual hardship, while the Residency Agent will be inundated with complaints, and will he constrained to ask favour of Persian officials, which they are neither willing nor able to grant. If the present occasion is not considered a favourable one for fighting the case, the only solution that occurs to me is that the Bahrain subjects might be instructed to tako Persian passports under protest and record their protest at the time to the Residency Agent, as they do not so much object to the extra payment, but are afraid that the I passports in question will be used against them in future as evidence that they are Persian subjects# If the Persian Government push their contention to its logical conclusion, I presume they will also object to the ^ settlement of the cases of Bahrain subjects by British authorities• • in conclusion I would respectfully beg to urge that in view of the existence of written instructions to the Persian officials concerned, the matter can no longer be arranged by the exercise of personal influence in each case, and it occurs, and the cases are more comparatively frequent, aa d I would therefore venture to request that I may be given definite instructions for communication to the Residency Agent at Lingah.

I need hardly say that we do not admit this contention, of course even from the Persian point of view it is entirely illogical, as the Customs Departnent charge duty on goods coming from Bahrein and prosecute and punish people caught smuggling. Incidentally I may mention that- for some time past we have co-operated (and rather effectively^ with the Customs. Department in preventing smuggling from Bahrein by sending duplicate Uanifeoto from Bahrein. This has of course been stopped as smuggling from one part of Persia to another is impossible. The Customs Department cannot have it both ways. I shall represent matter to Teheran; whether anything can be settled or not in the absence of a Gove~^me^t I dor T t l:n^w, but jwoanwhile there is no objection to Bahreinis taking out passport, if local Authorities insist, under protest. oh/ a m /- A.P.Trovor, Lieut-Colonel Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.i/ Town &amp; 19/109 .

This atti |tud© of Ministry of Foreign Affairs is km curiously at variance with that of Customs Department which considers Bahrain foreign port, charges duty etc. and prosecutes persons caught smuggling. Last year Customs asked for aad obtained my cooperation in trying to prevent smuggling from Bahrain and Direc(bd&gt;r told me it was of considerable assistance to them.

The Secretary has since ■^nom for a report in his No 1976 which I am replying that the file h ' s already been sent to you. The object of this letter is not to discuss the particular case in point .bat the general question of Persian* in R - : hra in appealing to the Persian authorities in Persia / egainst the the decisions of the Political .gent in Bahrain. As laid down everyone ha. the right to appeal to you^ this right is veil loiown &amp; is fairly frequem made use of. It has however struck: me that, having regard to the peculiar status of Bahrain &amp; the Persian pretentions,coupled with a good dial of anti-British feeling among Persians &amp; the activities of the local »' T atani f party who wish to interest the Persian authorities as farm as possible in Bahrain affairs, we re rather playing into their hands if we permit ^he Persian authoribties to take up such cases cfs give the impression to their compatriots that they are in a position to get the Political Igent 1 hauled over the coals', also the Persian Official although not in hrain is to all practical effect acting as a Persian Consul in Bahrain affairs.

Ee m-y -ir^steu to apply to the j gency It appears to me that something of this sort would soon put ' stop to what to be a growing habit Of appealing to tho Persian authorities, &amp; dragging thfm Into Bahrain2, affairs. It may create a wrong- impression if they receive replies to petitions via the Persian Authorities. Although the reply given would ' appeal doubtless be exactly the si me as if the ssoos had been submitted in the ordinary way, the Petitioner would probably be led to thin.£ that he had secured b better hearing than would have been the e se were he not supported by feliQ D ersian Authorities,^ the latter will encourage appeals to be made through them,both from a natural love of meddlingfor the sr.ce of pecuniary benifits which probably accrue in the process.

The selection of these particular cases for the News paper article is,I think, strong evidence that the article is either written or inspired by Ha ji Abdun ITabi . ^ f JI enclose another article from another paper. Haji Abdun h - lin *Habi was suspected some years ago of being the author of similar articles which appeared in the Teheran Press. It ' s of course very easy for him in the present state of Persian Politics to get papers to t&amp;ize the matter up. Than Bahadur Muhammad Sharif informed me some time ago that he had information fkiom Lingeh that Abdun JTabi was constantly sending messages to Bast ale urging them to agitate in the Bastaki case. Abdun Habi besides being naturally anti-British is a bitter enemy of abdun ITabi Bushiri who 91 : * defeated him in a land case in Major I}ickson T s time .He has tried hard to cause dissension among the Persians &lt;5: to get Huhammad Sharif to help him to T down T A.U. Bushirdo Muho Sharif has* always declined Bamadhan a fracas nearly occurred between the Tazieh processions of th^ Tazerunis ^ the Bushiris which was only averted by strong action by the police. After this I aslced Shaiic llhalaf to use his influence to patch up a peace between the twoo To make things easier I persuaded A»H. Bushiri to taice the first step &amp;-pay a conciliatory visit to A.II. Zazeruni.

Every attempt at reconcilaition since has completely failed.1 have not personally been involved as there is too little liklihood of success. There is little doubt that Haji A.rU Kazerani having been warned so often before firmly believes that he is immune from more serious action. I Viave heard that the Shaiks are much annoyed by the articles now being published &amp; are likely to apply to me for restraint of \ Haji Abdun ITabi, who is commonly recognised as the cause of the trouble. and -a. if ^azeruni is consequently out against them botlu During last Maj. I.'. Pol. AgentExtract fron^Shafaq-e-Sorkh** dated lat Safar 1341(23/9/2?'), Wh©r© is Bahrain and whose property Is It? i Bahrain is in the Persian Gulf ard is the most important and the richest Island of the Persian Hulf. Bahrain is a place in which arrives 60 to 70 million rupees for the purchase of pearls every year. Bahrain is a place which has become proverbia in all the Southern Persia for its abundant ^ running waters, springs and innumerous pleasant gardens. Bahrain is a place in which 400 to 500 sailing vessels arrive from the Arab Coast and Persia to obtain their requirements and to dispose of their cargoes—a place whose importance the Indians have realized and in which they have established several hundred* firms ard derive wealth from it by millions. Whose property is Bahrain? Bahrain is the property and the inseparable part of Persia whether before or after Islam. Even during the time of the Atabeks of Pars, when Persia was almost in a feudal state it was under them. Bahrain was never separate^ from Persia and it is not. History does not show that at any time that Persia was ruled over by an independent King Bahrain was not a part and parcel of the Persian Coast. Nay^ I was mistaken; even during the periods of feudalism again Bahrain wasja part of the Persian Coast such as Reshire, Bushire, Qais Island, etc* what is the reason, therefore, that the British Government wishes to prevent us from the occupation of a natural part of our country* On what legal grounds does the British Government want to appropriate the most important and productive Island of the Persian Islands? ? ? hat is the British Governments authority and argument T If the British Government tries to adduce the rebellion of the Beni Ataneh Arabs of several years a fro as the reason for the seizing of one of our Islands, she can as well, for the same reasons, taVe possession of all Persia, because such incidents of rebellion by Khans and Shaikhs in Persia have taken place at all times. Whenever there has been any trouble in this country, the influential persons of the neighbourhood, taking advantage of the Central Governments i ri I wee ,knessweakness and preoccupation with it, have raised the standard of rebellion. During the recent revolution and chancre of Government most of the Khans in the South, North and ^06t refused to pay taxes and to obey the Central Government. But such rebellions did not give cause to another Government to seize a part of our ^country or for that rea'son prevent her from occupying a part of her country. There is no room for doubt or hesitation that Bahrain has always been a part of Persia and is one of its Islands. This cannot be denied either by the British Government or by the Shaikh of Bahrain. What is the reason then that if the Government decide to send a Governor to that place or establish Customs office there, the British Government stops it* Was an agreement concluded between the British and Persian Governments by which the Persian Government has ceded her rights as the proprietor to the British Government or granted independence to the- Shaikh of Bahrain? No, this has not happened and we can never remember such an agreement. And until a clear agreement is concluded about Bahrain, Persian Sovereignty over Bahrain continues and cannot be denied by any Power. After the revolt of the Bahrain Shaikhs and the murder of of the garrison of soldiers, again they always showed obedience and submissiveness to the Government because during the chief tainship of Abdollah ben Ahmad, when prince Hesam-os-Saltaneh was the Governor General of Fars he sent Eskandar Khan to that place and invited them to obey the Government. In their letter they have written in reply to the Governor General of Fars, which is published in one of the Bahrain poets 1 books, they * have manifested their complete obedience to the Persian Government. At the time of Shaikh Muhammad ben Khalifah, when the British Government was going to intervene in that place, he sent a certain Khalil Merrikhi with letters to Bushire and bo / communicated with the Persian Government through Haji Ahmad Khan Kababi and requested the despatch of a number of soldiers for the occupation of that place. The Government sent a number of soldiers and some Tangestani Tofangchis in a sailing vessel to%0f $ '/%&amp;€&gt;) V to occupy the Island. The British ships kept them on the sea several days and finally stopped them from going and occupying Bahrain. On account of this offence, the British incited All ben Khalifah against him for the purpose'of occupying Bahrain with their help, and this did take place. In consideration of the foregoing explanation, Bahrain has been and will be an inseparable part of Persia. What is the reason, therefore, for the silence of the Government in demanding their rights* Has not the day and time arrived as yl)t that the Ministers shake aside timidity which is the source of all misfortunes and proceed to demand their ;]ust . rights with a resolute determination? In the 'opinion of the ■persons who are conversant with the trend of political affairs of the wo^ld to some extent the present is the best moment for the Government to abandon their timorous policy and courageously press for the j^o^utfen^of their rights, because on the one hand,the Bolshevik Government in Russia^ according to the late Agreement, has ceded us all rights in the Caspian Sea and this is the greatest reason for us to compel the British Government to return our rights in the Persian Gulf. On the other hand, the said Government's preoccupations with, the questions of Asia Minor, Constantinople, Palestine, the troubles in Mesopotamia and th'S riots in India and finally with the obscure situation in Europe will not allow that Government to break with us. If she tries to insist upon trie usurpation of our rights, we can unite with our Eastern and Fuhammadan brethren and recover our rights by force of bayonets, because,although we need the good will and friendship of the British Government the latter requires ours a thousand times more since our country is the key to India and we are the barrir between the British Government and the enemies of India. Admitting for the / sake of argument j that the British Government play foul and loose with our interests in the Gulf, we can, if we are united with the enemies of India and the Eastern countries, threaten the latter country at any moment and even subdue it altogether. If the British Government wishes for our friendship, she shouldshould fulfil the conditions of friendship, hand to us all the 'T Islands in the Persian Gulf and the places in which she unlustly interferes, and should not intervene or intrigue in our internal affairs. The British Government does not observe the conditions of friendship with us, Intrigues apon^: our tribesmen openly, invites therm to riots and crime, protects traitorous persons, does not fail to have resort to any intrigue to render the proceedings of our brave soldiers futile and tries to seize our productive Islands like Bahrain which s i tua tio has the best pearl fishery in the world and tfes .an important/ in the Gulf, She has also taken from us the Abu Jfusa Island which has the red oxide mine? made Henjam the place for the ■imprisonment of the Indian and-Mesopotamian lovers 6f freedom. Still she expects us to observe the conditions of friendship gompletely, and even objects to the nublic feelings being roused against them. This is curious. In our opinion, the policy which the Ministers of the Court of London have assumed towards us and the Muhammadan countries is a wrong policy which will not lead to the acquisition of their object. Their diplomacy has become old: they should not compare the present nations of the East with the peoples and time of Gladystone, and until the British Government changes her old policy of fraud and intrigu^-into a true and clear one, it will be impossible for her to secure the confidence of the Eastern nations. To be brief, as we have already said, if the British Government desires our friendship, she should obtain the good i will of the people of ^ersia by the evacuation of Bahrain and the other Islands of the Persian Gulf and by handing them over to the officials of the ^e^siah Government, and cease to interfere with our affairs and have no relations with all the Khans and Chiefs of tribesmen, so that she may be able to recover her old friendly feelings of the Persian's; otherwise the present policy of the diplomatists of the banks of the Thames will constantly increase the Persians ? feelings of disgust against England.

Memorandum « 'Your memorandum H0.122/C dated 29th October 1922. Tne file of Ghulam *11'a case has only recently arrived and there haa not been time to deal with it yet. I will, however, reply to the general queation raiaed . it very often happens that, when the man comes over here to appeal to me , he goes and petitions the Governor afterwards. So far, however, no ofticial repreaentations have ever been made by the Governoiy, or at all events not at ■ • ■ - all recently. What they do ia to bring tne matter up in con- veraation when paying a call , and say that the man has been worrying them and can^not be got rid of- In moat caoea 1 vaguely remember aome petition about the cade having been made to me and aay so. Laat time. in. the case of Ghulam ^li 1 remembered something and after asking xinson on the telephone I told Governor that 1 nad received a similar petition and had instituted inquiries and would let him know the result. At that time o jp memories — had played ua false and we thougKt a report had been called for. It afterwards appeared that the petition had been sent to you lor disposal, so, aa the Governox^ now and then aaked about the matter it became necessary to call for a report which was done, as the questions *iave al ways been mentioned in a ftiendly way by the GovernoiVi it is difficult to adopt any formula lor abutting them up as you suggest. Actually the mere fact of their asking me about 1the various oasesi is a tacit recognition of ojx right to jurisdiction over Per^iana in Bahrein which id alwaya something. It would be rather a nuisance if the Governors intead at iniormally asking me were to wrive to tne Shaikh about any case which a Persian »abject brings to their notice . In this connection Foreign Oiiioe letter Jo.14193/14 dated 27th April 1914, though it wao written a propos ot Germans is interesting and has some bearing On the case. If a Governor mentions any case about which 1 nave no recollection, and about which,as far as 1 know^l have received no petition 1 will try and put him off with the request to tell the petitioner to come r.and to the Residency or something of that sort, or if they m ntion a letter from Bahrein I will suggest that he should tell the writer that he should make his petition to the Political ^.gent , Bahrein, or cometning of that sort. It is doubtful , however , if such an answer will finally shut the Governor up, as it is practically certain that if the petitioner does not get what he wants at the Residency he will go and bother the Governor again, in which case the latter will raise the question ag^in at his next meeting with me , and *iay that the fellow La continually worrying him again about the matter and what do I propose to do about , as in all probability he will soon come across some agitator or mischief maker who will suggest to him the advantage 01 teiegrapning to Tehran about his case. If he does this of course Tehran wire to the Governor and direct him to enquire into the matter. This has nap^ened in one or two cases .

He and six other Persians residing in Bahrain came over to Bushire- this week and presented a memorial to Eis Imperial Majesty the shah setting forth their alleged grievance^ praying His Majesty to appoint a Karguzar at Bahrain after their interests# As far as is known no action 1 has been taken on this memorial# With regard to the actual cases mentioned in these articles, I would observe that three of these are mentioned in nearly all the articles about Bahrain and are three in which Haji Abdul Nabi has specially interested himself* The case of Mul la Bastakl referred to in the first retractextract has already been reported; it is true that the man '■ died £iit of Dneuinonla sorne days after ho left the Agency look- up during which he had worked as usual as a coolie• # Kerb St lai Asad was accused of Di shonest misappropriation of property possessed by deceased person at the time of his death*• He pleaded not guilty but admitted having itxa: disposed of the whole of the property of deceas9d f though he was un- Ininv a.n. able to produce any will appointing/executor oreorder fjom any ••^©urtj and nothing to what he hrd done with the property, found guilty by the Shara COrrt, and sentenced to 3 mon ths infr 1 sonm ent • :ujQa Kazenmi was accused of •fargery f and pleaded guilty * ae was sentenced to a fine of B! 30/- and was released after having been detained in prison for days in all# His forgery was a very palpable and senseless one and he probably got off so lightly in this account* The case ©f shei di Bafiz Mi sri is well known to the Government of inlia ^nci has formed subject of correspondencej he is an Egyptian journalist of extreme views ^ho was knockin®; abouw the Gulf a^nd was not allowed to land a second time at B?^irain at the request of the Sheikh. Jasim Cherawi was one of the Secretaries of the Sheikh feo was always interferring and on one occasion having gone too far he was made, with the approval of the sheikh to five an undert -.king to behave and refrain from intrigue or be liable to deportation. Having broken this he was deported. This case was also reported to the aovernment of India. It is a curious thing that Haji Abdul Nabi continues to reside and carry on business in Bahrain, as he anparently the conditions of life so trying there. I beg to suggest that he nii s ht be repatriated to his own country, m 1910 His Majesty 's Minister, Tehran informed t&gt;is office (in his telegram Ho. 163 dated 17th July 1910) that His Majeaty*a Government had agreed to the deportation of Haji Abdul Habi for carrying on exactly the same intriguea as he 'A '*19 is doing now* It is unfortunate that he was ven time to wind up his affairs before 'being deported and in the end Jo# ikas not sent away* Durinr. the war he very low, as he doubtless knew that if he had riven troxable then, he ^ould hive been deported or otherwise punished at once* Since the i&amp;mt ratification of the 'rmlo-vPersian Agreement and thegui^- sequent wave of anti-British feeling in has re sumed his intrif^uoe Until recently he confined the A ^ ency? 1but ^^contly started attacM^ ^ tae Sheikhs and his family, who ^re much annoyed* If the Sbei&gt;h Dresses for the deportation ,-f Abdul Sabi, I beg to -enquire whether I can authorize the political Agent to carr&gt; it out tf at the request of the Huler 1 * or, as Haji Abdul Nabi is a foreigner imier British protection, to inform the sh^ilshi that on account of his misbehaviour our nroteotion is withdrawn from Faji Abdul Nabi and allow^ him to deoort the man himself* Of the above two courses I should prefer the first, as the latter might be mis interpreted as a relaxation of our orotection of foreigners* It is of course possible that Haji Abdul Nabi would continue his agitation in Persia, but in this case he would not be in such a good position to carry it on as he is now* A copy of this letter is beln^ sent to His MaJesty ^s Minister, Tehran, His Ma^esty^ Consul, Shiraz and the Political Agent, Bahrain* I ii' ^ 1 iV Nk« SVt -h of 1928.

This practice of itself is open to objection as it might be construed into a tacit admission that the Persian Pass port authorities are justified in giving passes for another Persian p 0rt tc p9rsons ^ ^• - 1 r&gt; &lt;2- -J (is 3. His Majesty's Minister has now suggested that persons «roinf: to Bahrain should obtain British passes or visas, and be turned back if they have not got them. The Political Agent expressed the view that this is perfectly feasible, and recommends that the procedure should be adopted# As far as I can see it would be perfectly easy to adopt it for all arrivals by steamer, but to enforce the procedure on Persians arriving from the Dashti and Shibkuh ports would inflict a certain amount of hardship because it would entail a , c. -ish -Journey either to Bu^hire or Line;ah to obtain pass or visa* This would not matter of itself very much as the Persian authorities do not show much consideration to Bahrain subjects, wore it not that it might result in deterring these boatmen from coming to Bahrain. When I was at Bahrain (and I fancy it is still the case) nearly all the fresh meat in Bahrain and a large proportion of the fresh fruit and vegetables used to come by dhow from the smaller Persian Ports; if this traffic were to be reduced by the new passport rules, it would cause considerable inconvenience in Bahrain. This could perhaps be obviated if the boatowners obtained P^sian Passports and secured a visa lastlmg for (say) one year, and the prospect of a chance of smuggling goods back from Bahrain to the Persian Coast would doubtless offer strong inducement to the boatmen to continue their trips to Babrein* in the circumstances I beg to recommend that the system of British passports and visas suggested by the minister may be given a trial, and to request that if the aovernment of India concur, they will be pleased to authorize its introduc- I have the honour to be.
