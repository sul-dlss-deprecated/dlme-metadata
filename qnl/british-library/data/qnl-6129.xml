S.4036/4036/91, S • u •1 • 8th September 1932, Sir, Vith reference to your letter IIo• o8123/32 of the 9th August, I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to request you to lay before Secretary Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister the following observations on the late Sir Hugh Biscoe’s proposal that the question of jurisdiction over foreigners in Kuwait should be reconsidered in view of the possible arrival there in the near future of a large number of non-Eusleiji foreigners, 2. The Secretary of State shares the late Sir Hugh Bis coe’s view that it is undesirable to leave this question in its present indeterminate state, the more so as, although at present of little practical importance, it may become acute if United States interests should acquire the oil concession which they are now seeking to obtain from the Shaikh of Kuwait. 3. As Sir Philip Gunliffe-Lister is aware, the chief difficulty which has hitherto stood in the way of the definite settlement of this question of jurisdiction in Kuwait is the obscurity of the Shaikh's international status, it is uncertain whether all the foreign governments concerned would be prepared to recognise the Shaikh as a sovereign and independent ruler. It is equally doubtful what attitude foreign governments would adopt towards the question whether Kuwait ever became part of the Ottoman Empire and, if she did so become part of that Empire, exactly what her present status is. 4 . The Unuer-Secretary of State, Colonial Office.o 4, Sir John Simon is advised that it would be difficult for His Majesty’s Government conclusively to establish that Kuwait never formed part of the Ottoman Empire. It may therefore be theoretically possible for foreign Powers such as the United States to maintain that, having acquired by treaty with the Sublime Ports capitulatory rights throughout the Ottoman dominions, they had acquired such rights in Kuwait while it was still part of Turkey, and that they still possess them since they have not been formally abrogated by any new arrangement• 5. It is therefore possible that some foreign government would question the Shaikh’s right, as a sovereign and indepen dent ruler, to delegate to British authorities rights of jurisdiction over its nationals. In spite of this difficulty, however, the Secretary of State considers that it may still be practicable to adopt the proposal made in the memorandum enclosed in your letter under reply, and so conform to the precedent not in the case of Bahrain, by amending Article 3 (l] (2) of the Kuwait Order in Council 1925, and obtaining from the Shaikh of Kuwait a formal written request that The King should exercise jurisdiction on his behalf in respect of all foreigners in his territory. In the event of the adop tion of this course His Majesty would have validly acquired jurisdiction over all foreigners over whom the Shaikh possesses jurisdiction. Since, however, it would clearly be impossible for the Shaikh to transfer jurisdiction which he does not posses-, it would follow that TT io Majesty would not in this way acquire jurisdiction over foreigners in Kuwait entitled to capitulatory privileges provided that the State whose nationals they were took the trouble to raise the question - o contingency which at the moment appears remote - and that. havi i.g • • • •-3- ( 3 &gt; hfcVi.,~ raised it, that State was able to establish a strong case* | jurisdiction sc granted by the Shaikh, and sanctioned by the revised Order in Council as proposed, in the case of all foreigners unless and until objection is taken. Should objection be taken, each case fcan be dealt with when it arises. if necessary, that the United States Government have in fact tacitly recognised the Shaikh by their support of an American group in an attempt to obtain an oil concession from him; indeed all the correspondence with the United States Government on that question has been based on the assumption that the Shaikh is an independent ruler, - an assumption which the United States Government never appear to have questioned. Any other Powers likely to be interested in the question are signatories of the Treaty of Lausanne and have therefore formally recognised the detachment of Kuwait from the Ottoman Umpire. Such an argument might, it is true, lead the other signatory Powers to maintain that, since Article 16 of the Treaty of Lausanne provides for the fate of the territories detached from Turkey to be decided by the 'parties concerned', they should have been consi Ited before the introduction of any new arrangements. 8* It is true thc*t the arguments set ou^ in the pre ceding paragraph would meet a claim for capitulatory rights based on the grounds set out in paragraph 4 above but apart 6« In these circumstances the Secretary of State inclines to the opinion that it ib desirable to take the action I suggested in the preceding paragraph and to exercise the 7 n the case of the United States it could be ergued, from the possibility of challenging the theoretical existence-4- of former capitulatory rights, His Haje^ty’s Goveruaent could justify their action on more practical grounds, as for instance on the absence of any arrangements whereby the State in question could provide for the exercise by its own representatives of jurisdiction ever its own nation; Is in Kuwait territory. If such an attitude were adopted it seems unlikely that it would L ive rise to any very serious difficulties such as would be likely to arise from a formal request to the former capitula tory Powers in advance to abandon such rights as they might possess, 9, In order to avoid such difficulties sc far as possible, Sir John Simon considers that it would be undesirable merely to pass a short amending Order in Council to the Kuwait Order in Council,1925, since such a step would show clearly that the only modification to be made in the Order was one bearing on the question of 'jurisdiction over foreigners, anu would there fore be likely to call attention to the matter, &lt;/e would prefer that the amendment of the Order should be effected in such a manner that it would escape undue notice abroad, and accordingly suggests that this might best be done by the issue of an entirely new Kuwait Order in Council, even if the only point of difference between this order anu the one which it supersedes concerns the matter of jurisdiction over foreigners alone. In the event, however, of the preparation of a new Order, it may well in practice bn fo~nd convenient to effect a number of minor amendments in the existing Order. On sene points the new draft Ethiopia Order in Council, copies of v/hich have been sent to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, may' afford assistance in the drafting of a new Kuwait Order in Council, 1C« Y/hile it would be premature, pending further consideration • • • •consideration of the matter by the interested departments, to enter into details of drafting of the proposed new Order in Council. I am to request you to invite Sir Philip Cunliffe- Lister’s attention to the provisions of Article S (7) of the Bahrain Order in Counci1,1913. This states that 'if any question arises whether the subjects or citizens of any country, State, or tribe have or have not been placed under the juris diction of His Hajesty by agreement with, or the consent of, the Shaikh of Bahrain, it shall be referred by the Court to the Political Resident, and a certificate under his hand and seal si all be conclusive on the question, and judiciol notice shall be taken thereof”. The introduction of similar pi cv r isions into the proposed new Kuwait Order would, m Sir ohn oimon e opinion, have much to recommend it, since it would enable His Majesty’s Government tc deal on thexr merits with objections to the jurisdiction based upon capitulatory rights, and to prevent the Court deaiin^ with a case ii objections were raised or if His Majesty’s Government for any other reason considered it necessary to do so* H. * copy of this letter is being sent to the India Off ice* I am, Sir, Your obedien t s ervant, (Signed) C../.Baxter.•‘■elegram R 27 Rrom Gkjvemmont of India, Foreign &amp; Political department, Hew Delhi.

In these circumstances the Secretary of State inclines to the opinion that it is desirable to take the action suggested in the preceding paragraph and to exercise the jurisdiction so granted by the Sh&amp;ikh, and sanctioned by the revised Order in Council as proposed, in the case of all foreigners unless and until objection is taken. Should objection be taken, each case can be dealt with when it arises. 7. In the case of the United States it could be argued, if necessary, that the United States Government have in fact tacitly recognised the Shaikh by their support of an American group in an attempt to obtain an oil concession from him; indeed all the correspondence with the United States Government on that question has been based on the assumption that the Shaikh is an independ ent ruler, - an assumption which the United States Government never appear to have questioned. Any other Powers likely to be interested in the question are signatories of the Treaty of Lausanne and have therefore formally recognised the detachment of Kuwait from the Ottoman Empire. Such an argument might, it is true, lead the other signatory Powers to maintain that, since Article 16 of the Treaty of Lausanne provides for the fate of the territories detached from Turkey to 1 be decided by the ’’parties concerned', they should have^consulted before the introduction of any new arrangements. 8.

The introduction of similar provisions into the proposed new Kuwait Order would, in Sir John Simon's opinion, have much to recorrmend it, since it would enable Kis Majesty's Government to deal on their merits with objections to the jurisdiction based upon capitulatory rights, and to prevent the Court dealing with a case if objections were raised or if His Majesty's Government for any other reason considered it necessary to do so. 11.

Protection of Iraqi subjects and in terests abroad. Sir, I have the honour to refer you to Secretary’s 1 No.2648 dated the 17th December forwarding copy of Foreign and Political Department’s letter No.D.4350 - N/32 of 16th November 1932 and enclosures for information and guidance. 2 As I understand if the implied intention of the Iraq Government as far as Kuwait is concerned, is that its nationals and interests generally should be looked after by His Majesty’s Government, l.e. the Political Agent. 5 The Kuwait 'Order in Council of 1925' para 8 (2) says that His Majesty’s Government ( i.e. the Political Agent) will have Jurisdiction over 'Foreigner., with respect to whom the Shaikh of Kuwait, and any State, King, Chief or Government whose subjects^ or under whose protection they are, have agreed with His Majesty, or consented to, the exercise of Jurisdiction by His Majesty'. 4 On the other hand un a letter dated the 17th Rabi II 1344 (4th November 1925) from the Shaikh of^Kuwait to the f Political Agent, the former conveyed his consent to/exercise by the Political Agent of his Jurisdiction over the subjects and protected persons in Kuwait, of non-Moslem Foreign Powers only .This was further amplified in the exchange of letters between the Political Agent and the Shaikh, forwarded under cover of Political Agent 1 s memorandum No.424/32/11 dated 12th December 1925 to the Hon f ble the Political Resident, Persiai Gulf. 5. I presume therefore, that as Iraq is a Moslem State, and as the Shaikh has not ceded to His Majesty’s Government the right of jurisdiction over the subjects of Moslem States, no action is intended on my part, and Iraq subjects in Kuwait will remain under the Shaikh’s Jurisdiction as heretofore. 6 . As the matter is rather a complicated one, and a false step might have undesirable repercussions, I should be glad to be informed if my presumption (paragraph 5) is the correct one. 7 . In the meantime I propose taking no action in the matt er• I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant.

Jurisdiction over Foreigners and amendment of the . uwait Order-in-Council of 1925. With reference to your confidential K0.522-S, dated the 51st March 1955 and enclosure, I have the honour to submit below the one amendment which, in my opinion is necessary and should be introduced in the Revised Kuwait Order-in-Council, tinder preparation. 2. Sub-para (2) of Section 8 on page 4 of the Kuwait Order-in-Council 1925 should be cancelled, and substituted by another sub-para, which should read as follows:- 6.(2). Foreigners, (a) Subjects and protected persons of all Moslem Powers with respect to whom the Shaikh of Kuwait and any Moslem State, King, Chief or Government, whose subjects or under whose protection they are, have agreed with His Majesty for, or consented to, the exercise of jurisdic tion by His ?Iajesty. (b) Subjects and protected persons of all Non-Moslem Foreign Powers, with respect to whom the Shaikh has con sented and agreed to theJ to the exercise of jurisdiction by His Majesty. 3. TTie reason ??hy I have introduced amendment (a) above is firstly in order to camouflage our intention as given in (b) and secondly in order to give confidence to the Shaikh. It is not in the least likely that the Shaikh of Kuwait will ever voluntarily surrender the existing jurisdiction that he possesses over Moslems in his State, however much a Moslem Forei&amp;i Power might request him to do so. The paragraph indeed strengthens his hand, for it will successfully prevent His Majesty King Bin vSaud, the Persian Government ,^and to a lesser extent IRAQ,) who each claim several thousands of subjects in Kuwait, from trying to 'get at' the Shaikh of Kuwait by asking His Majesty’s Government to look after their 'nationals' residing in Kuwait, as they might very easily do. 4.

Jurisdiction over foreigners in Kuwait. 2. Draft Ord^r in Council has now been examined here in consultation with foreign Office who have suggested several amendment's which are mostly of timely legal or drafting character. 3. Suggestions ofmore substantial importance are;- (1) re-definitionof ’’Kuwait subject” in Article 4 (see paragraph 5 below) and (2) proposal to delete all words after foreigners in Article 8 (1) (2) of draft Order, on the ground that, ’’Kuwait subject” and ’’British subject” are defined as proposed in pragraphs 5 and 8 below, the expression 'FoBdgner” as defined in -rt.4 will adequately cover all those foreigners in respect of whom we wish BhaiPh to consent to our exercise o^ jurisdiction, ic.e \l) (2) would then read ’’Foreigners”, sss as hereindefined, within the limits of t v is Crde” 4. /ith re .card to (2) since proposed method of obtaining shaikh's consent is simply to obtain hir written concurrence in the new Order (see my Express Letter o' 10th February 1935, No. P...296/33), I am inclined to see advantage in this amendment v/hich night reduce -c ., o which Foreign Office/ were ]8$&gt;preher.t:je ,consent without his accusation of having obtained Jhaihh’s being aware that he was giving it. 5. /ith regard to (l), foreign C r ~ice point out that the expression ’'Muslim Power” used in present definition of 'Kuwait subject” is an expression of somewhat vague and doubtful meaning. for example Great Britain th^ ’ lands are sometimes so described owinr to the numbers o r their Muslim subjects. The following definition, which is thought to be preferable from this point of view, is therefore proposed for 'Kuwait subject' * 'Kuwait subject” means a subject of the Ghaikh of' Kuwait or any person, not being a British subject, who is the national of anyother 1 usli Gtate*. This definition may not be entirely satisfactory 1 ut it has not been possible to find a better one which expresses the meaning required. 6. fe have considered as an alternative a definition of 'Kuwait subject' as 'any person, not being a British subject, who is a Kuslim' ,but this is open to objection in that it would remove from the Political agent's jurisdiction Muslim subjects of non-Muslim foreign Governments. In this connection please see enclosures to ^usbire letter Ko.2517-Qf 19th December 1925 forwarded with your letter ITo.210-N of 21st January 1926. Je think it unnecessary to retain in the definition of 'Kuwait subject' the expressions 'resident at Kuwait' and 'not represented by a Consul at Kuwait' the former of w&amp;dsbh serves no very useful purpose and might he unduly restrictive, while the latter is objectionable since we have no intention of allowing appointment of ^oreign consuls at Kuwait. 7. I should he grateful to receive as soon as possible by telegraph your views and those of the Political resident on/-3- on the questions raised in paragraphs S to 6 above. The matter is of some urgency owing to rumours of renev^ed American interest in Kuwait (vide Political Resident's telegram No, 106G , of 28th November 193?-). 8. It is also proposed to revise the definition o'’ 'British sir : ect ,f in article 4 in accordance with modern practice (vide India Office letter of 13th November 1933 to Poreign Office, copy of which was sent to you by .xir Mail of 24th November and to Bush ire by xxir Mail of 1st December under Ho.x.^.5406/33) but no difficulty arises over thi s. 9.

Note of a oonvoroation between Colonel Fowle and His l^coellenoy halkh i)lr .4ua&amp;d p luler of Kuwait, on 18 th of July, 1934 at which La jar Watte, Political .agent, Kuwait, waa preeent; on th© aubjeot of the hftikh f a attitude towarda Jurisdiction over foreigners. Vhil© paaaing through ]ru«/ait on leave on ray way to catch th© Westbound Airwaye* machine et Baara, I took the opportunity to do a ’’holiday task',(I had already handed over to Colonel Loch) by having a conversation with Shaikh Ahmad on va lone subjects • the above among at others* I found the Shaikh looking rather puffy and I)r*GT©enway infoxta© me that he has given up the unequal atrugwl© against corpulence: some years ago he was 16 f tone but by sever© dieting reduced himself to IS* 3« The Shaikh wae amiable as usual* I touched on t;h8 liylree Case. This case is now more or leas closed, and was reported by Major atts to Colonel Loch and myself verbally in Bus hire, Major Watts is following this up with a written report. Uy object therefore was not -ta to exhume the case but (a) to impress on His Ihcoellenoy that matters connected with British subjects should be referred to the Political Agent before action is taken by him; (b) to ascertain indirectly, in connection with the new Ordei^ln-Council, what the Shaikh*s attitude would be towards handing over Jurisdiction of non-Moslem foreigners to us* 3* }ji I pointed out that since Dr*!4ylrea was a British subject, though employed by the American Mission, it would have been more correct for His Sroellency/No.718-3 of 1934. British Residency &amp; Consulate-General, Bushire, the 26th July 1934. To The Political Agent, Kuwait. r Sir, I have the honour to refer to the Secretary of State for India’s telegram No.1009, dated the 30th April 1934, regarding the Kuwait Order in Council, and to request you to take the matter up with His Excellency Shaikh Sir Ahmad al- f Jabir as-Sabah as soon as possible. / 2 . I would suggest that, if you see no local objection and subject to anything which may have been arranged with Colonel Fowle, you should first broach the matter verbally with His Excellency Shaikh Ahmad and explain to him that the new Order in Council is substantially the same as the old one, but has a few verbal amendments and has been brought up to date in the matter of, for example, aircraft. The changes might, if you think fit, be shown to him by a comparison of the old and new Order in Council appropriately marked. You might also refer to the correspondence of 1925 (ending with his letter dated the 3rd November 1925) and explain the changes in the definitions of Kuwait subject and British subj ect. 3. In view of the terms of the 1925 correspondence and of his attitude in the matter of jurisdiction over foreigners in his conversation with Colonel Fowle on the 18th July (at which you were present), it seems improbable that His Excellency will raise any objection to the changes in the definitions/- 2 ~ definitions of Kuwait subject and British subject, but should he appear doubtful you should impress upon him the danger of the present position when it might be possible for a non-Moslem Foreign Government to claim that neither he (the Shaikh) nor His Majesty’s Government had jurisdiction over their nationals. 4 . if His Excellency accepts the revised Order in Council, you should arrange for a formal exchange of letters between you and him. A draft letter from you to the Shaikh is enclosed to be used unless, after your conversations with the Shaikh, you consider that a modification of the terms is desirable.

This Tnachinery is supplementary, and in case of conflict subordinate to the Principal Order in Oouncil in force in all the countries to .vhich it an )lies. The Principal defect in the 1908 Order /'hich wqs revealed in the Judicial decision in %ypt, which has been referred to above, *as that under Article 13 of the present Order, it seems to he imposs ible to collect additional Probate fees where the estate has been undervalued In the original affidavit of the personal representative unless such per?, oral representative mskes a corrective affidavit. But it h«o been thought necessary, t' addition to correcting this olvicts drafting error, to confer utpon the Court uipx Oi ly tne p overs cl out in Article 11,12,13 and 14 of the rev/ draft Order. In addition to this, one or two further amendments have been aiaae rhict seem desirable and Articles 6 and 7 of the 1908 Order have been redrafted, and it is hoped that in their present form thoy are clearer. The period with regard to d onatio m ortis cau sa has been raised from twelve months to throe yeers and a proviso excepting certaii gifts from the operation of the clause has been added in accordance-13- £ 20 f it .9. ; that thn amount due at 3 on the sum so realised 7 /as £ 506 5 and that there v/as’j. consequani ly f duo and owing to the estate £ 1.149 representing tha arouot overpaid to the Bepintrar on the 24th June 1920. On the i:.'th Jure, 1927, on the ex-parte application of Counsel of 01 nent Brek and G ? .hriol ^hema, Ilott J. made an order that tha exeectoih Co - ecv;r from the Consular Authori ties at Alexandria, £ 1,149 the ac.oir t over paid hy them as estate duty in reo.nect of the late Farag Bvek’s personal estate Or the 17th August, 1927 - as appears from the corres pondence - £ 1,149 was paid from K.-.i .Consulate General at Alexandria to tlir oxecrtors ♦ On the 6 th June, 1931, cn the ox-parte applicetioh of the respondent, an order vas made appcirting Mr.Bohort Bainie Brewls, f- of artcred accountant, to hold an enquiry as to the personal estate of the deceased anu to report as to the value of such estate within the juri. diction of the hurt. On the idth June, 1931, the v/rit in the present action was issued!£ claiming, inter alia, to sot aside the order of tJL. the 13th June 1927 , directing the^^ysitint . £ 1,149 to the executors• On the 23rd hay, 1932, Ur, Brewis hy his certificate certified thu value of the estate of the late r arag ek at £ 60,122.4,8. ‘o application to vary this certificate was made and it was duly con. s inr-sd hy the Court. On the 4 th hovsno rr, 1932, the present action was tried an, juJyaent given tcr ;he plaintiff-respondent setting aside the Order of the 13th June 1927. From that Judgment the defendant Gabriel &gt;hsfua appeals* In. arriving at a decision in this case it is necessary in the first place to consider in detail the relevant provisions of the Foreign Jurisdiction (Probates) Order in Council 1906. Article 5 (l) provides fox the affidavit with which y the person applying for probate or administration must accompan his- 14 his appllcation. Article 5(2) provides for corrections in the original affidavit being made by a further affidavit, to be sworn by the person who applied for the grant of probate or administration. Article 9 provides that the Court may obtain further information, by affidavit or otherwise, regarding the estate from any person, or may direct enquiries concerning it, and then goes on ,l the information or report so received shall be •deemed to be a portion of the affidavit of the applicant 'for probate or letters of administration**. Finally, Article 13 lays it down that where a further affidavit is sworn under Article 5(2), and the Court is satisfied either that a larger fee or a smaller fee should have been paid on the grant of probate or administration,the Court may direct a further fee to be paid as may be due, or may direct such sum to be repaid to the applicant as may seem Just. That is to say, it is only when a further affidavit correcting an error in the first affidavit is made by the person who applied for probate or administration, and to whom a grant of probate or administration has issued, that Article 13 comes into operation. To give any other meaning to Article 1 3 is to reduce the first line of that article to anullity, and as was said by Jessell M.B. in Yorkshire Insurance Company v. Clayton (iBSl), 8 at p.424. •Although it may not always be possible to give •a meaning to every word used in an Act of •Parliament, it is a general rule that it is •right not to treat word surplusage if a meaning •can be fairly given to them*. The same canon of interpretation of course applies also to legis lative enactments by His Majesty in Council. By treating the words in Article 13 “where a further •affidavit is sworn under Article 5(2)* as prescribing a condition precedent upon the fulfilment of which alone the remainder&gt;g) - 15 - remainder of the article can he held to operate, we can fairly give a meaning to the article, which, it must not he forgotten, is concerned with the revenues of the Crown and is therefore a legislative instrument which calls for a strict interpretation. This being so, 1 am hound to hold that Article 13 is not applicable in the circumstances of the present case and that the appeal on behalf of Gabriel Shama must succeed. As the Crown i'rosecutor in this case was suing as an officer of the Crown in performance of a public duty, we make no order as to costs. As to the appeal on behalf of Clement J^wek in which we have already held that Counsel should not be heard, we order that e$ch party bear its own costs both here and in the Court below • 20th January, 1933. A« tn Coats i Mr. S. Alexander quotes Halsbury, Vol.24 p.743, par. 1600. In suits by or against Crown, costs are given for or against Crown. Mr.Perrott says this is statuory. Court points out that case in Halsbury is for revenue penalties. Halsbury, Vol, 10, p.12, par. 26, costs may be given against Crown 22 and 23 Victoria 26 Section 21. Re Carbon!te 1923 2 Oh. 504, 1924 2 Oh. 53 Mr. Rerrott cites Halsbury, Vol.23, p. 207. As to costs on the argument before us, we give costs to Gabriel Shama, below and in this Court, and order Clement Dwek to bear his own costs here and below. No payment of costs pending appeal. Mr.Mazwell asks for leave to appeal to Rrivy Council in forma pauperis. Says he has an appeal as of right *1 have sCjul* not/(heard and have a right to be heard*•. Cites Benwich p. 170 p, 169, 1926 edition. Mr.Perrott gives notice of appeal. Leave to appeal granted to both applicants. P.T.Q.® m - 16 Security in &amp; 500. Necessary steps to Tae taken within 3 months. 20th January, 1933. SIR HERBERT 0. STRIHGEs the Resident* I concur in the Judgment of 20.1.36. SIR WAS8T ST EERY: I have not much to add hut I should like to say a few words. have had some discussion as to whether the order of the Court in 1917 was a ministerial of a Judicial act, and I should like to deal with that point first. The duties put on the Court under the Foreign Jurisdiction (£rohate«) Order in Council in Article 9 seem to resemble duties put on the Commissioners of Inland Revenue under the Finance Act, 1894, and as there is no provision for the Crown being represented and no suggestion that the Court’s determination under Article 13 is inter partie s , I still remain of my former opinion that the act of the Court was a ministerial an« not a Judicial one. The next point on which considerable emphasis has been laid by the appellants is that the money sought by th&lt; Crown is afee and not a duty. I quite agree, though the point comes oddly from the parties who asked the Judge for a return of estate duty and obtained an order for the return of estate duty. The Crown, however, does not press that point, otherwise I should have been inclined to say that the Order and appli cation for repayment we re both bad a h initio . !e are then to assume that the case is to be considered on the footing that the application for repay ment was for repayment of fees and that the order for repayment related to fees. Now the importance of this is it is said that noaction for return of fees can lie unless there has 'been some ^ promise to pay and therefore that the Crown here cannot recover fees when once they have 'been approved hy the Judge* this In my view f however true/may or may not he as an exposition of the law of fees in general # the form of proce dure laid down in the Foreign Jurisdiction (Prohates) Order in Council necessarily implies a promise to pay an hoth sidest on the part of the Crown and of the subject. It is assumed in Section 13 that the case will arise where too great or too small fees have been paid, and provides for the necessary adjustment, and that though the act of probate for which the fees are paid has been issued* But granted that probate fee s are not irrecoverable, is that sufficient in the present case ? I leave out the question of fraud which has not been alleged, for it has not been put higher than a mistake on the part of the Judge in accepting the then present value of the estate instead of the value at the time of Farag Dwek f s death* The other members of the Court have discovered a point which was not made to me in the Court below and has escaped the ingenuity of counsel on the appeal, but which appears to me to be irrefutable* It is this that it is by Article 13 alone that fees are made re payable, and that that article in terms limits the case to one where a further affidavit has been filed, which seems necessarily to imply that it is by this further affidavit that the Court is to be satisfied* There is no power in this Court to correct the wording of Article 13, though it may be that there is a draftman f s mistake* There was apparently an attempt to adopt the procedure of the Customs a!)d Inland Revenue Act, 1382, in these matters, but under that procedure, if the Commissioners are satisfied the value of an estate is insufficient, they can compel the applicant for probate to file a corrective affidavit under severe penalties*This is not the case here* lhat is sontemplated, so far as the Order in Council lays it down, is , first, the filing of an affidavit; second, under Article 9 enquiry, if need 'be, 'before prolate is iss ued; third, a corrective affidavit; 'but if once prolate has Deen issued, then the enquiry under Article 9 is useless, unless the applicant files a further affidavit, or presumably in case of fraud. It might be argued that the report should be considered part of the further affidavit, but Article 9 says distinctly it is to be part of ilia affidavit, which can only mean the affidavit referred to in Article 5. The result is that I concur with the Judgment pronounced by the other members of the Court. 20.1.1933.V - _ w It is requested that in any further communi cation on this subject the under-mentioned letter and number may be quoted, and the reply addressed to — The Under Secretary of State for India, Political Department, India Office, London, S.

The primary British concern being the removal of the requirement that Britain must obtain permission from foreign governments before assuming jurisdiction over their nationals. The file therefore includes discussion between British officials over the changes they desire to make to the
                           Kuwait Order in Council(1925). There is also some debate over how best to hide the nature of the amendments from other powers, and to what (if any) extent a request from the Iraq Government — asking the British Government to represent Iraqi subjects aboard — affects the situation at Kuwait.The main correspondents are as follows: the Kuwait Political Agent (Harold Richard Patrick Dickson and Ralph Watts); the Persian Gulf Political Resident (Trenchard Craven William Fowle and Percy Gordon Loch); the Foreign Department of the Government of India; the Secretary of State for India; and officials of the India Office and the Foreign Office.The Arabic language content consists of an exchange (see folios 164-187) between the Kuwait Political Agent and the Shaikh of Kuwait, Shaikh Ahmad al-Jabir as-Sabah [Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ]. The subject matter is the Shaikh's formal acceptance of the new Order in Council. The correspondence is dated between 10 August to 3 October 1934, it includes English translations, and a copy of the proposed amendments in Arabic (see folios 167-173). A copy of the Shaikh's acceptance of the original Order in Council dated 3 November 1925 is also included.Draft (and annotated) copies of the proposed replacement Order in Council can be found on folios 63-77 and 124-139. A comprehensive table of proposed alterations as of 15 December 1933 (folios 89-100), along with extracts from the
                           Ethiopian Order in Council(1931) – folios 101-8 – can also be found within. As can notes on a meeting between the Shaikh of Kuwait and Trenchard Fowle on 18 July 1934 (see folios 155-57).The file also includes a draft copy of
                           The Foreign Jurisdiction (Probate) Order in Council, 1934designed to replace the 1908 Order in Council on folios 200-08. The reasons for the introduction of a new Order in Council is explained, and notes outlining the court judgement which prompted it can be found on folios 211-17. The case in question is Case Number 62 of 1931 between ‘Crown Prosecutor Vs Clement Dwek &amp; Other [Gabriel Shama]’ heard by the full Egyptian Court.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Kuwait Order in Council</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000149#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
