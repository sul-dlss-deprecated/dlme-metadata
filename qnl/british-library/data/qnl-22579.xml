On the 7th March 1935 I enquired from tne Chief i Local Representative, The Bahrain Petroleum Company, whether it was now possible to give an estimate of the number of tankshlps which were likely to call at Bahrain annually In connection with their operations. On the 11th March I received the following reply:- n I would refer you to our letter of November 15th, 1934, and beg to advise that the situation as regards the information you desire has not altered since that time. The Company still regret that they are unable to give any such estimate as you request.' 3. Local gossip has It that at least five tankships are expected this year. 4. I see no objection to light dues being levied at Bahrain from vessels of The Bahrain Petroleum Company provided Political Agency, Bahrain, the 18th Mfrch 1935.provided that the Bahrain Ciovernment are informed of what is being done and acquiesce in the collection of the dues by their Director of Customs and Port Officer. 5. It is just possible, hovever, that the Bahrain Petroleum Company may say that if they had been told of this proposal before, they would have preferred to have their own lighted buoy off -Bahrain, but I do not think that they would press this point. No figure of the amount to be levied has been Quoted, but I think that the Company is likely to object to paying the same dues as are levied at Basrah as, so far as I am aware (though I do not know on what course their ships steer), their tankships will only make use of the lighthouse at Quoin Island and the lightship (not yet in place) at Bahrain.

Subjecti- question of levying lightdues at Bahrein from the vessels of the Bahrein Petroleum Company. Sir, I am directed to say that in view of the establish ment of the Bahrein petroleum Company at Bahrein the Government oi India have had under consideration the question of the levy of Persian Gulf lightdues on vessels which call at Bahrein but do not proceed to or arrive from the ports of Aba dan and Basrah# According lo the existing procedure lightdues in the Persian Gulf are levied and collected only in respect of vessels arriving at and departing from the ports of Aba dan and Basrah. This procedure was adopted in 1925 because the number of ships using the lights in the Persian Gulf but not calling at either Aba dan or Basrah was estimated to be negligible and also because of the difficulty likely to be experienced in collecting the dues at ports other than Abadan and Basrah. The position has, however, now altered materially in view of operations of the Bahrein petroleum Company and it is estimated that51 a numbeijof ships will in future be calling at Bahrein which will not proceed to or arrive from the ports of Aba dan and Basrah. I t ha s accordingly been suggested that lightdues should be levied and collected from such vessels at Bahrein and this suggestion is supported by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. 3. The Government of India have endeavoured to ascer tain the tonnage of vessels likely to be calling at Bahrein in connection with the operations of the Bahrein Petroleum Company § but have been unable to obtain any accurate forecast. It is, however, anticipated that st least five tanic-ships will call at that port during the current year and that as the Company are expecting to produce about 5000 barrels of oil per day the number of tank-ships likely to call at the port in subsequent years will be even grea ter. 4* The Government of India have also considered the procedure to oe adopted for the levy and collection of trie x i^ght due s au Bahrein in the event of the dues becoming leviable at that place and after consultation with the Political Resident in tne Persian Gulf and the Flag officer Commanding, Royal Indian Navy, are of opinion that the responsibility for the levy and collection of the lightdues should devolve on the Port officer, Bahrein, if the Govern rent of Bahrein have no objection to his undertaking the duty. They have also considered the question of the rate at which tne lightdaee should be levied and are of opinion that even though it may be urged that vessels calling at Bahrein and not proceeding to Aba dan or Basrah use no lights west of Bahrein, the flat rate now pres ort bed for all vessels liable to lightdues in the Persian Gulf should be prescribed also for vessels calling only at Bahrein. They, however, realise that the final decision on all these points must rest with His ^jesty^s Govern ment and I am to request that, if the Secretary of State fur India sees no objection, the matter may be placedbefore His ^jeety ^s Government at an early date.

Prima facie the suggestion seems a reasonable one, but it is no doubt desirable, before taking any decision, to secure Colonel Ward's views upon it. It is possible he may be averse from modifying the present system of levying dues, at any rate for the maintenance of route lights, in the 3hatt-el-Arab only, 3- If it is eventually decided to adopt the Government of India's suggestion. It v/ill clearly be necessary, before introducing the new arrangements, to secure the consent of the party chiefly affected, namely the Bahrein Petroleum Company, since the present system rests primarily on the consent of the interested parties H.L.

Y 5 :■ i ■5/ 34 - 2 - (as represented originally by the Chamber of Shipping and subsequently by the Bombay Advisory Committee) and a new departure of this kind, affecting an interest not hitherto concerned, should presumably be based on the same principle» The Company will no doubt agree that they should contribute a fair share to the upkeep of the lights which they use - though they may, I suppose, claim representation on the Committee and they may not agree that the full Basra rate should be charged at Bahrein. 4. Apart from general considerations it vould, in any case, be desirable to obtain the prior consent of the Company in view of the fact that the light dues could only be collected under the authority of the Bahrein Government, who, however, have recently promised (in connection with the setting up of a refinery in Bahrein and in return for certain concessions from the Company' to exempt the Company from payment of all taxes and dues in Bahrein except certain specified state and municipal taxeso It is possible, therefore, that there might be technical difficulty in enforcing the payment of light dues by ships which are the property of the Company if the Company were to refuse to pay,- 3 - 5. If you agree with paragraph 2 above, and subject to any observations by Grimshaw or by Seal, to whom I am sending copies of this letter, you will no doubt ask the Embassy at Bagdad to obtain Colonel Ward's views on the Government of India's letter.

J(y dear Clauson, I am sorry to have been ao long in replying to your letter No.P.2.8400/35 of the 2nd December about the proposal to levy light dues at Bahrain. 2. In principle we see no objection to the (rovernment of India* s proposal, vhicli is in itself, of course, quite reasonable. 1 fe also agree that Ward ought eventually to be consulted about it. But before we ask our Embassy at Bagdad to take it up with him, we think the following considerations ought to be taken into account, and it may be that they will lead us to the conclusion that it will be better to postpone approaching Ward until the general situation is rather clearer• 3. In the first place there is the question of the Bahrain Petroleum Company's general and special rights with which you deal in paragraphs 3 and 4 of your letter. If the Company voluntarily agreed to the levy of light dues by the Persian Gulf Lighting Service all would of course be well. It would only be if the Company demurred to this that the question of a compulsory levy by, or by the authority of, the Shaikh might arise. We think that in that case the exemption from taxation which it is proposed to give the Company in their agreement with the Shaikh about the establishment of their refinery tsee draft deed enclosed in India Office letter P.Z. 8659/1930 of December 5th 1935) would have to be considered. The text of Article III is worded / M.J.Clauson Esq. p«V I'_o_ kv worded very comprehensively. It is possible to argue tiaat it does not cover dues levied by an officer of the Shaikh for a third party. But this argument might not prevail. It jrasaii would still be possible to amend the draft agreement before it is signed; but we do not think any attempt should be made to do this except after very careful deliberation, especially in view of the considerations set forth in para graphs 4 and 5 below. In any case it would probably be desirable to make a King's Regulation under the Bahrain Order in Council to justify the levy of a due by an officer of the Shaikh on British ships. 4. In the second place the question will require careful watching in view of the fact that suggestions for a closer co-ordination of the arrangements for collecting light dues in the GrUlf may possibly emerge as a result of the impending Shatt-al-Arab Conservancy Convention negotiations. It might be premature to fix on any scheme for Bahrain in advance of those negotiations; and it might, for that • * matter, be even more premature to do so in advance of the final transfer to Persia of the lights and buoys in Persian waters and of a final decision regarding the placing of a light vessel, oossibly borrowed from Bahrain, at Farur shoal. It seems to us that it would be wise to settle these matters, if possible, before introducing a fresh complica tion into the Persian Gulf Lighting problem. As you know, the Admiralty and Board of Trade are rathei 1 anxious as to 4 the possibility of the Persian Government charging excessive dues in respect of the Gulf lights which they will be taking over, and the imposition of a new due by us» or by Bahrain, at this moment might conceivably make it easier for /43 -3- for the Persians to put on new and higher dues themselves. 5. Thirdly, as you know, shipping developments at Bahrain are always liable to be affected by developments on the Hasa coast. For example if the Standard Oil Company of California, which holds the Hasa Concession, is thinking of developing a port at Ras Tanura - as we believe it is - any ill-timed imposition of light dues at Bahrain might conceivably tip the scale and end in a considerable volume of shipping, which would otherwise use Bahrain, going only to Has Tanura instead. 6. I am sending copies of this letter to Seal at the Admiralty and Grimshaw at the Board of Trade. Yours ever, (sd.)

Reference; Foreign Office letter(E 7048/33/34} of 30th December 193b to the rndie Office. Personally I agree with Foreign Office that it would be better to postpone the question, though the difficulties mentioned in paragraph 3 of the Foreign Office letter re: Bahrain Petroleum Company*s and their rights under the Agreement could be got over by the Buoying and Lighting Committee collecting their dues direct from the Bahrain Petroleum Company instead of through the Shaikh.

Please see demi-official letter dated 30th December from Foreign Office of which a copy was sent to you by air mail on January 6th, After considering points raised by Foreign Office I am inclined to opinion that it would be unwise to tajge-^ny steps at present towards the institution of a levy at Bahrain. Apart from any other considerations Government of India will no doubt agree that risk of encourag ing development of port on Hasa coast is a real one. The most satisfactory solution of the problem might be to request the Bahrain Petroleum Company to make an annual lump sum contribution towards the upkeep of the lights based on the tonnage of their ships entering the Persian Gulf and not » proceeding to the Ghatt-al-Arab, on the ground that theirs are the only ships that use the route lights without contributing to the fund. I presume it is still definitely the case that apart from the Bahrain Company*8 vessels the number of ships entering the Gulf without touching at Abadan or Basra is negligible. Such an arrangement would of course include ships going to and from a Saudi port as well as Bahrain, and so would avoid risk referred to above. ^ ^ should be glad of Government of Indians views on /on this suggestion with a view to its consideration in due course by His Majesty's Government. l n the circumstances I do not propose to attempt to make any alteration in the draft deed to amend the Bahrain Petroleum Company's lease, which would in any case be undesirable at this stage of the negotiations.

It would clearly be impossible to ask the Company to contribute in respect of tankers not controlled by theTT? and therefore we would sugg st that, before goin any further, the Government of In ia should ascertain what proportion of the tankers which use the light and do not touch Abadan or Bushire are, in fact, controlled by the Company.

So far it appears that there has only been one tank ship coming here which is actually under the control of the parent Company, and the rest have been chartered from Tank ship Companies of no less than seven different nationalities# While I am not yet in a position to guarantee the following infonnation, I believe it is correct to say that these tankships are chart- net by the Bahrain Petroleum Company or by the parent Company but by the firms which purchase the oil. Whether this be strictly correct or not, it is certainly true that these tankship# are not controlled by the Bahrain Company, taking control to involve ownership or at least a long term charter. 3. As for the suggestion that there might be other ships coming to Bahrain and not going on to Basrah, this does not as yet appear to be correct.

In view of the fact that so few of the tankshlps taking oil from Bahrein are actually controlled by the Bahrein Petroleum Company (and Ballantyne, the London representative of the Company confirms that this is so) it looks as though we shall have to drop the proposal to ask the Company to make an annual lump sum contribution and we are thus' back at the point at which we started, i.e. the Government of India's letter of the J.-bo 17th October 1935.

Dear Mr. Gibson, In connection with the buoying and lighting of the Sitrah Channel, The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited dealt with the matter generally through the India Office although it was the Royal Indian Navy at Bombay who did the work and who subsequently rendered appropriate accounts of moneys due to them in relation thereto. Somewhat the same kind of situation arises now in connection with the buoying and lighting of the Channel leading to Dhulaiiain on the Mainland, the Company concerned there being the California Arabian Standard Oil Company, As you know. Representatives of the Company have ceBn discussing with the Kydrographer's Department of the Admiralty (Rear-Admiral Edgell), the work done by the Company's Officials on the spot and in San Francisco. The present position is this;- A certain amount of revised data has been prepared by tne Company and which they expect to deliver to the Admiralty at the end of this month. There is every reason to believe that this data will be found by the Admiralty to be in order. Upon that assumption the Admiralty believe the Charts will be ready and some copies will be published about August next. As an aid to navigation it is desirable to buoy the Channel and if the buoying could be done without delay, the Admiralty would be enabled to mark on the published Charts the relative positions of the buoys. It is desirable, of course, that these positions should be marked on/2, on the Charts rather than that their positions should be left to supplemental information issued by the Admiralty. The question is whether the Company might now communicate with Bombay direct, or whether you would prefer they should communicate through the India Office, would you oe good enough to let me know what you would lil-ze the Company to do ? and I ■.•/ill pass the information on for immediate ac'cion to be taken.

Dear Mr. GilDSon, In further reference to your letter P.Z.3673/ 3 8 of the 28th May 1938, I have to send you herewith two copies of a published Admiralty Chart described as 'Persian Gulf Western SheetNod. 2837B. Marked upon the Chart in red crayon are channels to Dhulaifain and Ras Tanura respectively on the east coast of Arabia. The California Arabian Standard Oil Company, which is a Delaware Company, Subsidiary of the Standard Oil Company of California and of The Texas Corporation (both American Petroleum Companies) has been conducting surveys for some time past with the object of opening up these channels and of charting and buoying them, and in this it has been aided by many kindly suggestions from the Admiralty - Hydrographer f s Department. The aim of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company has been to open up either Dhulaifain or Ras Tanura - as a port or anchorage on the east coast of Arabia to facilitate the operations of the Company in relation to the exploration of Arabia for petroleum resources and the development of those resources when found. As you are aware, the Company has recently discovered what promises to be an oilfield on the Damman dome and this has rendered the need of the Company for a port or anchorage on the Arabian coast sooner than had been anticipated; the Company's plans for development of that area have had to be accelerated by virtue of the discovery end it would be of the greatest possible convenience to the Company to have port or anchorage facilities by next September. The Company appears to be satisfied that the channels to/2 . \t ■ / to looth Dhulaifain and Has Tanura are clear. All of the maps and field notes resulting from the Company's surveys have heen handed to the Admiralty and the Admiralty expect to he in a position to publish charts embodying these data some time during August. It is, of course 9 desirable to buoy the channels as soon as the necessary arrangements can be made. As I understand it 9 no question arises as to v/ho should mark the channels; that, I believe, is the task always under- toien by the Royal Indian Navy. There does, however, arise the question of how the assistance of the Royal Indian Navy is to be invoked, and to what extent. In the early part of 1936 the Royal Indian Navy kindly --rt assisted The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited, another ' ■ . ouosidiary 01 the Standard Oil Company of California and Thej^^ T Texas Corporation, in buoying the channel to Sit rah, and it , l t CCi P* is hoped by my Principals that through the medium of your '^U^l good offices the Royal Indian Navy vail once again come to - , i' - f v ** their assistance by buoying the channels to the anchorage off the Mainland. I might say here that it has not yet been determined whether Dhulaifain or Ras Tanura will be used as the Company's port or anchorage but this will make little difference, I understand, in practice, for the reason that there is one main channel to both anchorages down to a certain point. It is proposed that that portion of the channel common to both anchorages, should be lighted by four buoys. If the Ras Tanura anchorage is to be adopted, then an additional light buoy will be required. You will observe it is intended to use light buoys; it is not/\( t ^ 3. r not proposed, so far as I am aware at present, that there should Idc additional dumb 'buoys or spars. It is understood, of course, that the work hy the Royal Indian Navy should he at the cost in all things of the Californie Arabian Standard Oil Company. May I ask you, on 'behalf of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company, to take up the matter of these anchorages with the Royal Indian Navy and to supply them with the information contained in this letter, and to enquiret- (a) whether the Royal Indian Navy would 'be ahle to supply one or more of the requisite 'buoys, and if so, whether hy way of loan or sale? (h) the approximate cost to the Company of the supply 'by the Royal Indian Navy of light 'buoys upon loan and upon sale? (c) how soon the Royal Indian Navy would 'be ahle to lay the 'buoys? and (d) whether the Royal Indian Navy would 'be prepared to maintain the 'buoys at an agreed cost, in somewhat the same way as they are maintaining the 'buoys marking the Sitrah Channel? As I have indicated above, the channel ultimately selected 'by the Company for use on the east coast of Arabia, should be open for general traffic during the month of September next. Imi^Tt add that if the Company had to provide the buoys, the type and specifications would meet any requirements of the Royal Indian Navy to suit their servicing equipment and to conform with buoying rules prevailing in the Persian Gulf.

I am in receipt of your letter ^io.lG/3652 of 23rd instant forwarding a copy of a letter dated 19th instant from the Deputy Secretary to the 3overnment of India to you, regarding the question of levying light dues at Bahrain. I note that Government consider that there are certain object ions to instituting a general levy of light dues at Bahrain, the main objection being that it would encourage the develop ment of a rival port on the Kasa Coast. I cannot agree that this is a sufficient reason for holding this matter in abeyance until a decision has been reached in regard to the future administration of the lersiaii iulf Light ing Service, as 1 consider that light dues should be levied on all vessels using the lersian iulf lights, irrespective of the port in the Persian Gulf to v/hich they are proceeding. J also see no reason why the Bahrain Letroleum Jompany should not be asked to contribute a lump sum towards the upkeep of the lights based on the tonnage of their ships entering the Persian Gulf and ob^ining the full benefits of those lights, or why the tankers not controlled by them should not be charged separately, as they also benefit by the lights. I consider that Government should again be advised of the advisory committee's dissatisfaction with their decision in this matter.

My dear Baggallay, Would you please refer to the letter of the 1st December from the Commerce Department of the Government o- India, a copy of which was sent to you under cover of India Office letter LTo. P. Z. 8109/38 , dated the 13th December, regarding the proposal to institute a levy of light dues at Bahrein. ^ * 2. At the outset I should say that we are not quite clear why the Advisory Committee are pressing this proposal, unless it be from a desire to secure a reduction of the existing rates by increasing the sources o_ revenue. In view of the suggestions made last year for reducing the Surplus Fund (see the enclosures to the Government of India's letter of the 15th July, No.F.122- l'T/38, copy sent-to you with India Office letter of the 3rd August, ITo. P. Z. 5252/38) there /is apparently no need lor a net increase in the revenues of the Service. •Baggallay, Esq. , /I' /v*'— Foreign Office.n 2. 3. certain xacts came to light in th.8 consideration of the original proposal, viz:- (a) The volume of shipping, other than oil tankers, calling at Bahrein and not proceeding to the Shatt-al-Arab is negligible. (b) Most of the tankers are chartered by the firms taking the oil and are therefore not controlled by the Bahrein Petroleum Company. 4. One of the principal arguments previously advanced against the proposal was the risk of encouraging the development of a port on the Hasa Coast. 17ow that a port is being energetically developed at Ras Tanurah by the California Arabian Standard Oil Company (for their own immediate purposes) the question remaining is whether the levy of light dues at Bahrein (on ships not arriving from or proceeding to Basra or Abadan) would encourage the diversion of traffic from Bahrein to Ras Tanurah. Point (a) above suggests that it would not. In substance, only oil tankers are affected, and other considerations will govern their movements. They will no doubt collect at Bahrein the refined Hasa oil dealt with by the refinery at Bahrein, while/while on the other hand, light dues or not, thqywill presumably go direct to Ras Tanurah for the Hasa crude oil. 5. The consequences of point (b) are that, even if the Bahrein Petroleum Company successfully contested the levy of light dues at Bahrein on their tankers, only a small proportion of the tonnage of oil tankers visiting Bahrein would be affected. On the other hand the same position would probably obtain at Ras Tanurah, namely, that most 01 the tankers calling there would not be controlled by the California Arabian Standard Oil Company. Such vessels, unless they call at Bahrein or visit the Shatt-al-Arab, will presumably escape from contributing to the lighting service under any arrangement that is likely to be practicable. 6. It may be possible to overcome objection on the part of the American Company, if they raise any, to the charging of light dues at Bahrein on ships controlled by them. They cou^d also no doubt be invited to make a contribution to the Lighting and Buoying Fund in respect of tankers controlled by them and visiting only Ras Tanurah. But they might very well point out in reply that, in so far as shipping generally makes use, now or in/4. in future, of the Sit rah Channel at Bahrein or the approaches to Ras Tanurah, they are already contributing to navigational facilities in the Gulf 'by paying for the installation and maintenance of the lights and buoys at those places. 7. As regards ways and means, there should be no difficulty in arranging with the Bahrein Government for the collection of light dues on behalf of the Lighting Service, a King's Regulation being issued to legalise the imposition of dues on British and foreign shipping. Dues would probably be levied at two-thirds of the rate charged in the Shatt, and only shipping not proceeding to or from the Shatt would be liable; or alternatively it might be arranged that only shipping which had paid the full dues at Basra etc. during the current visit to the Gulf should be exempt, and that vessels proceeding from Bahrein to the Shatt, and having paid the two-thirds rate at Bahrein, should pay only the balance of the full dues on arrival there. Presumably none of the owners or charterers of the vessels calling only at Bahrein would be represented on the Persian Gulf Lighting Service Advisory Committee; but that need not perhaps be regarded in advance as an insuperable/insuperable objection to inaugurating the collection of dues at Bahrein. your letter of the 30th December, 1935, lTo.E.7 /33/34, namely, reasons arising from the impending Shatt-al-Arab Conservancy Convention negotiations and from the talcing over by Persia of lights and buoys in Persian waters. In the light of subsequent developnents do you think that those reasons still hold good ? It may not be too easy to convince the Bombay Co -.ir .ittee that further delay is justified; so long as the present lighting system, or anything like it, continues the claim that shipping calling only at Bahrein should share the coat remains equitable, while, as for the Persians, they will presumably follow their own devices in the levying of light dues irrespective of what is done at Bahrein. 9. Thus it may be that reconsideration may show that there is no longer any serious reason for declining to proceed with the proposal to levy light dues at Bahrein. To should be glad to have your views. We 8. There remain the reasons for holding up t proposal which were suggested over three years o in should/should also be glad to have those of the Admiralty and the Board of Trade, and I am accordingly sending a copy of this letter to Jarrett and to Guttery. Yours sincerely,INDIA OFPIGS will j JK.AT.-Lj 3J. 1 :.Z. 3718/39 Isw ^ebiuary, 1940 r Levy of light dues at Bahrei n Sir With reference to your letter of the 1st December,1938, No. 306-M*Il(13)/38, regarding the suggested levy of light dues at Bahrein on 'behalf of the Persian Gulf Lighting and Buoying Service, I am directed 'by the Secretary of State to state that, after further consideration of the matter and in modification of the views expressed in this Office letter of the 9th March, 1938, No. P.Z.1337/38, he sees no objection to giving effect to the proposal, except in so far as the degree of exemption from Bahrein taxation enjoyed 'by the Bahrein Petroleum Co. may entitle them to claim the exemption of oil tankers controlled 'by them from light dues nominally levied 'by the Bahrein Government. In the alDsence of the fuller information regarding the ownership of tankers which the Political Agent hoped to procure (vide Mr. weightman's letter of the 10th November 1937, D.O. No. C/849-lO/lf) the Secretary of State is unable to estimate whether such exemption would detract substantially from the total of light dues collected at Bahrein. It is possible, indeed, that the Company might not wish to exercise or might bo persuaded to waive, any } right to exemption from light dues which they might legitimately be in a position to claim under their agreements with the Sheikh of Bahrein. I am accordingly to suggest that if it is still desired to give effect to the suggestion, the question of the machinery for doing so and of the position of the Bahrein Petroleum Company might be further examined in consultation with the r -e Secretary to the Political/ Gove ran. en t of India* Department of Commerce. f/1) S C;2.

The main questions which occur to me are theses- \ (a) How does the Shaikh of Bahrain come into this questioni and hom does the complementer:' question srise of the Bahrain Petroleum Company's possible claim to exemption from Bahrain taxation ? The lights for the u keep of which they might be asked to contribute are presumably the Route Lights, none of which lie in Bahrain territorial waters. Why, then, drag in the Shaikh ? (b) hat is the meaning of the word w control ,, in the phrase :t tanker3 controlled by the Bahrain Petroleum Company ' ? \re they held to control all tankers carry ing crude oil or refined products from Bahr- in, and If so how do they obtain control over a tanker chartered, say, by a firm in the Canary Islands to carry crude oil from Bahrain to the Canary Refinery 7 Or does control mean that the Company Itself owns the tankship or that a sub sidiary or an affiliated company owns it ? In point of fact the Bahrain Petroleum Company owns no tankshipc, ^ Hon'ble Lieutenant Colonel and C.G.Prior, C.I.S., Political Heildent in the Persian Gulf, Camp, riuscQt.and only one comes here which is owned by California- :exas. r do not of course know whether tankship com panies such as the Balboa Transport Corporation are off shoots of the ^oint California-Texas parent companies# (c) Most important of all.

T have sent in various reports indicating that the California Standard Oil Company ex pect to be in a position to export up to 46,000 barrels daily in the next two years or so; and even if as much as 10 to 15 thousand barrels a day of the Arabian crude is purchased by the Bahrain Petroleum Company and refined here in Bahrain before export, it will not be Ion- before tankships clearing fron Has Tunara for ports outside the ersian *ulf exceed in nunber tankships clearing from iahrain» Are, then, slnilar arrangements going to be made with the California Arabian Standard Oil Company and if not how can we defend action which must be preju dicial to Bahrain interests ?

Presumably they must be Sitra Channel beacons and if so it is worth remembering that these are of great value to the Navy Sloops 9 and also to a certain number of cargo boats (including Strlcks) which discharge cargo at Sitra partly because a great deal of cargo is for the Oil Company but also because it is a more protected anchorage than Manama (Manama cargo is brought round by lighter). Consequently I doubt if the powers that be would be willing to use the th»eat to reduce the Bahrain lights or indeed to remove the light vessel| which I think is used also by passenger and cargo ships bound for Manama anchorage to fix their position, 3* Nevertheless I do agree that the Bahrain Petroleum Company and California Arabian Company should be invited to pay, and personally I believe that they will agree readily enough, though they may argue about the 66^ % rate* This rate appears to have been proposed by Ganstin and we do not seem to have any figures on which to go in order to convince the Oil Companies that they are getting a square deal« Yours sincerely, (W t ton 1 bin Lieutenant Colonel C.G.Prior, C.I.E., Political Sesident in the Persian Gulf, BUSHIRE.CONFIDENTIAL.

This Service, which maintains a number of lights and buoys necessary for navigation in the Gulf, is controlled by the Government of India in consultation with an Advisory Committee at Bombay and depends for its revenue on dues collected at Basra from shipping entering the Shatt-al-Arab. There is however no arrangement for the collection of dues from shipping which does not proceed beyond intermediate ports to the head of the Gulf. Shipping in this category is stated to be confined almost entirely to the tankers which visit only Bahrein or Ras Tanura, and thus these ships contribute nothing towards the upkeep of the navigational aids maintained by the Persian Gulf Lighting Service from which they benefit as they enter and leave the Gulf. 2* For some time past, as I think you are aware, the authorities have felt this position to be inequitable and unsatisfactory and have been seeking a remedy for it. It has been found that political and administrative reasons make it impracticable to adopt what would appear to be the obvious solution, the collection of light dues on the spot at Bahrein and Ras Tanura. The Government of India, having examinedthe possible courses open to them, consider that the only feasible rolution lies in the direct co-operation of the Bahrein Petroleum Co. and the California Arabian Standard Oil Co. Their proposal is that a periodic contribution should be made by/ H.R.

Since this shipping enjoys the greater part of the facilities provided by the Lighting Service the Government of India propose that the contribution should be calculated at two-thirds the rate of the dues levied at Basra. (Our latest information, which is not however quite up-to-date, indicated that the dues at Basra were 1 anna in and 1 anna out, i#e» 2 annas in all, per net registered ton) I am to request that you v/ill be good enough to submit this proposal to the Companies for their approval. 3» The Government of India are aware that the Companies may claim that they already make a substantial contribution to navigational facilities in the Gulf by paying for the maintenance of lights and buoys in the neighbourhood of Sitrah and Ras Tanura. In fact, however, these lights and buoys were installed, and are for the most part made use of, in connexion v/ith the Companies 1 operations; those in the approaches to Ras Tanura may occasionally be used by cargo vessels but those in the Sitrah channel are understood to benefit only the Bahrein Petroleum Co.

Persian Gulf. November 29, 1941. His Britannic Majesty's Political Agent, B a h r a i n&gt; Dear Sir, We sire in receipt of a communication from our Principals in New York stating that considerable corres pondence has been carried on between the India Office in London, through our Company representative, Mr. Ballantyne, in London, and themselves, regarding the maintenance of certain navigational aids in the Persian Gulf; and more particularly those owned by the Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited, which are of special assistance to vessels visit ing Sitra Basin. In order to refresh your memory on this matter, it might be recalled that when the oil loading terminal at Sitra was first placed in service, no vessels of deep draft ever visited Sitra Basin; but the Bahrein Light Vessel, the w North Sitra Buoy 11 , and other navigational aids leading in to Manama were already in place. In order to facilitate the passage of vessels to the new port of Sitra, the Bahrein Petroleum Company, at considerable expense, negotiated with H.B.M.'s Government and through them, purchased and installed the buoys officially known as 'Middle Sitra Buoy' and 'South Sitra Buoy 1 *. We are enclosing herewith a plan showing the location of these buoys (navigational aids) involved in the matter. It was agreed at that time that the expense involved in maintaining these buoys should be borne by the Company, but the labour and material in connection with this maintenance was to be furnished by the Basrah Port Trust^using the Light House Tender W NSARCHITS ,, for this purpose. In addition to the buoys mentioned in the foregoing paragraph, the Bahrein Petroleum Company have also installed certain buoys of various types within the immediate area of Sitra Basin, which are used for various purposes and are maintained by Bapco. These markers and buoys are not to be considered in any way in the present discussion. Our communication from New York outlines a plan for contributing to the Indian Government's Persian Gulf Lighting service annually, rather than paying the varying amountsiUm the Qonpaniea in the of these ^nd all other relevant consideraLion^ will appreciate the reaBonableneas of the Gk)YerniDent of India's proposal and be willing to accept it. Yours sincerely, Sd/- R. TWL.\ -2- PA-822 November 29, 1941 charged by the Basreih Port Trust, However, before we may formulate a reply to our Principals in this matter, it is most desirable that we have specific information from you on the following questions: 1. Is there any objection by the local G-overnment should the Persian Gulf Lighting Service main tain the lights now owned by the Bahrein Petroleum Company in the territorial waters of Bahrein and/or adjacent thereto? 2. Is there any local objection if the responsibility for the maintenance of the buoys (now owned and operated by the Bahrein Petroleum Company)should be transferred to the Persian Gulf Lighting Service? Is there any objection, in case such a step should be found advisable, to also transfer the ownership of these navigational aids to the Persian Gulf Lighting Service, by sale or otherwise? We are asked by our Principals to hasten our reply on this subject, and for this reason would deeply appreciate your early answer.

The Company wish to know whether there is likely to be any objection on the part of the vState to such transference and maintenance. 3. With the exception of the Company's lights, buoys and other navigational aids, T think I am right in saying that all other navigational aids affecting Bahrain are owned and maintained by the Persian Gulf Lighting Service. The nearest of these is the red flashing light on Has Zarwan, which is only about 2 miles from the Manama Cus toms pier. 4. I cannot find any references either to or from the Slate on the subject of these lights, but understand that the Port Officer was aware of the arrangements.

Yusuf Yasin recently informed me that California Arabian Standard Oil Company were negotiating with Persian Gulf Lighting Service an agreement for servicing Company 1 s lights in Persian Gulf. 2. Yusuf Yasin thought that agreement should be made between Saudi Arabian Government and Government of India and asked my advice as to proper method of approach. I gave it as my personal opinion that as Company were to pay annual cost and not the Saudi Arabian Government it was more appropriate for Company to make the agreement and for Saudi Arabian Government to signify their approval by letter to Company and if they wished, and if you saw no objection, they could exchange letters with Government of India. I gave this advice subject of course to your viev/s as I feared that Yusuf Yasin 1 s insistence on an agreement between Governments might be due to a hope that 3audi Arabian Government would then be establishing a claim to property in lights some of which are erected within Company's concession area and others at points to which Bahrain may have a claim. v usuf Yasin is how ever still insistent on an agreement between Governments. 3.

It is a little difficult to comment as it is not known what communication California Arabian Standard Oil Company have made to Saudi Arabian Government or what exactly their proposals are but it is presumed that they include the transfer of naviga tional aids installed by them to Persian Gulf Lighting Service on the lines of Bahrain Petroleum Company's proposal. Attention is invited to paragraoh No.7 and paragraph No.10 of Prior's -Mi* demi-official letter No.l58-,:&gt; of April 12th 1940 to Caroe. It would appear from paragraph No.7 that only one beacon is actually situated * Wa ^ tted askedbut if proposals referred to in paragraph No.2 of Prior's tele- gram No.181 mut. 1941 are adopted other navigational aids will presumably come v/ithin Saudi Arabian area. 4. It might perhaps be pointed out to Saudi Arabian Govern ment that payment to be made to Persian Gulf Lighting Committee by California Arabian standard Oil Company is not primarily for use of local lights but for main Gulf route lights and that whole Question is really one of a business arrangement between Company and Lighting Committee. If however the Saudi Arabian Government insist on coming to a formal agreement with Govern ment of India regarding the transfer of ownership of any lights in the former Government's territorial waters it will be diffi cult to refuse. If it is found that Saudi Arabian Government are expecting some financial benefit it should be made clear to them that Lighting Committee make no profits. n(i Britconsul.lb Jltf &gt; | INDIA CiPFIOE, V/HITEHALL, pit^hn/h2. s.w.i # r BY l ?

On the receipt of that telegram the matter was discussed -v/ith Mr. Ballantyne, who roprosents both the Companies in London. It was suggested to him, as cv possible solution of the difficulties which had arisen with the Saudi Arabian Government, that the C. A.S.0.C, should make no specific contribution to the Lighting Service, but that instead the contribution ^ to be paid by the Bahrein Petroleum Company, who are in very close ' relations with the Company operating on the mainland, should bo oorrespondingly increased. A letter, a copy of which is enclosed, hajg now been received from Mr. Ballrjityno, which states that the Bahrein Petroleum Ooi -ipany cannot see their way to give effect to this suggestion. This letter also shows that the C,A, 3.0.0. have not yet reached agreement v/ith the Saudi Arabian Gcvemment regarding the proposed arrangement relating to the payment of a contribution by the Oompany to the Lighting Service j and that a further communication cp this aspect of the matter may be expected.

Position is that dues covering lights throughout Persian Gulf are collected on arrival of ships at Basra, but as ships serving B.P.C. and G.A.S.O.G. do not go to Basra these Companies have hitherto made no contribution towards lighting services. agreement providing for lump sum contribu tion by B.P.G. to P.G.L.S. is at present under negotiation, and proposals have been put forv/ard for similar agreemeiit with G.A.3.O.G. This would provide that I.G.L.S. should undertake to service G.A.S.O.G.'s lights in approaches to Ras Tanura in return for annual payment by the Company v /hich would covsi cost of this service, as well as Company's share of cost oi ^ upkeep of Gulf lights generally. It is not clear why Saudi Arabian Government think it necessary that such an agreement should be negotiated by them, ar^y more than any other commercial contract into which the Company may enter, since the Government are not presumably prepared to bear the cost of the contribution. 2. The servicing of the Company^ lights at Ras Tanura by P.G.L.S. is only one part of the services v^iich the proposed contribution is intended to coverj but if the ^audi Araoian Government consider that their peiroission is necessary before the P.G.L.S. can work in Saudi territorial waters, 1 suggest that this permission be given by a letter tormally authorising the Company to make arrangements for this purpose with the P. G. L. o . You should explain matter to Saudi Arabian Government on these lines and say that I trust that in the circumstances the Saudi Arabian Government will now authorise Company to proceed with negotiations for the agreement. If you think it desirable, you may add an assurance that these arrangements (which do not involve any change in the ownership of the lights concerned) would in no way prejudice any decision regarding sovereignty over certain reefs about v/hich tnere has been dis pute in the past (see correspondence ending ith your telegram TIo.352 of 1941). 4. For your own information, the Gcmpany have in the past employed the P.G.X.S. to maintain the Has Tanura lights, but ceased doing so in October 1941 for fear of incurring the displeasure of the Saudi Arabian Gove rnment. They would prefer that no mention of this should be made to Saudi author it ie s . British Residency &amp; Consulate-General, Bush ire, the 3rd Novemuer 194 3.

Ballantyne»e letter of the 30th December 1942, except that made in item (6). It is considered that Lit^itship should remain at Stifle Bank in which position it nay usefully serve all vesbele using the Gulf, whereas at Shah Allum Shoal, it will serve only the vessels to and from Bahrain. Further, if moored in the latter position it would oblige all vessels to or from the Shatt-al-Arab to unnecessarily approach a known danger such as the Shoal presents.
