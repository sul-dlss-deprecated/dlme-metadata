It would seem best to fix a definite period within which the discussion of the constitution is to be undertaken by the Leg slative Assembly, entering, at the same time, a proviso that should ™lftical conditions at the time when the discussion is due to take place be such as to make such discussion inadvisable, the period within which the discussion must take place may be extended at the discretion of the mandatory Power. 2. Para. 15. Council of State. Clause (2). It would enhance the position of the President if his appointment were made by the British Secretary of State responsible to Parliament for the mandatoiy administration. It hardly seems advisable to make either the President oi tin Aii mbeit? of the Council removable at the pleasure of the High Commissioner, foi that would make the Council too obviously the High Commissioner's passive instrument. If they are to be removable the} 7- should be removable bv the British Secretary of State. In any case a period should be fixed for the holding of the post of President and Members of the Council. It is proposed in clause (3) that the first President should hold office until the constitutional question has been submitted to the Assembly, but, as has been shown above, this may be a very indefinite period. Clauses (4) and (9).—It is proposed that the Members of Council shall be either Members for a particular department of State or Secretaries of a department of State. It is not clear to whom the persons designated as Secretaries are to be Secretaries. They cannot be Secretaries to the High Commissioner, as he is not to be the principal executive authority of the State. They must therefore be Secretaries to the Council of State or to the President in Council. The meaning of clause (9) apparently is that every -department shall have a Member and a Secretary; that in some cases the Members shall be Arabs enjoying merely consultative powers, the British Secretary being the chief executive official, and that in other cases the Members shall be British, perhaps with no Secretaries all, but only with Arab advisers or assistants. There seems to be a good deal of confusion of thought in this clause. If a British Secretary has technically all the executive power and the Arab Member is a mere adviser, the position of the Arab Member will be so weak as to deceive no one. It would seem greatly preferable to make the Arab Members technically responsible, and to give the British Secretaries the right to refer to the High Commissioner any important differences of opinion between themselves and their Members. Clause (5).—The word ' British ' should be substituted for the word ' English ' wherever it occurs. It is not clear what is the meaning of the word 'Arab.' If it is intended to include all indigenous residents of Mesopotamia—Arabs, Jews, Chaldeans, &amp;c.—there is no reason to quarrel with it. If, however, the meaning is that no one but a person of British race or a person of true Arab race is to be a 10 1854 60 7.202 Member of the first Council o£ State, grave exception will probably be taken to ti e 'siic ied arrangement. The Jews and Christians, as is shown m paia. 4, clause (()), arflhe most progressive of the inhabitants of the country. Although they number onlv about 7 per cent, of the population, the proportion of wealth, in their lan s must be very much greater. They are much more interested in the development of the countrv and there will be very important questions, regarding the trans ei o land especially, in which their interests are bound to be gravely affected. It seems essential that there should be, if not one Jevvish and one t-hristian Member of the Council of State from the beginning, at least a provision that there shall be alternately a Jewish and a Christian Member. Again, in view of the very large part which Indian officials and personnel must for a long time to come play in Mesopotamia it would 'advisable to have one Indian Member of Council, or at least one Indian Secretary Possibly the term ' British Secretary ' may be intended to provide for the appointment of Indian Secretaries, but it would seem best, to make this quite clear. Clause (7).—The High Commissioner is to have the power of overruling a decision of the maiority of the Council. There should be a distinct provision for the reporting to the High Commissioner of all decisions of the Council of State and a limitation of time within which the High Commissioner's veto is to be exercised, and within which, failing the exercise of the veto, the decisions of the Council are to come into lorce. General. —The most important point of all in the matter of executive authority has not been touched on in this paragraph, viz., the rignt oi appointment and dismissal of officers. Are all officers of the State to be nominally appointed by the principal executive authority, that is to say, the Council, and to be subject to promotion and dismissal by the Council, or are they technically to receive and hold their appointments from the mandatory Power, the British Government, through the High Commissioner ? If they hold them from the British Government they will not be technically servants of the State. If, on the other hand, they hoM them from the State, and the constitution is to be for the present a temporary one, subject to revision, these' officers will feel that they have no security of tenure, and it may be difficult to recruit them. It would seem best to make all officers technically servants of the State, and for the British 'Government to give a guarantee that they shall either be entitled to serve for such period as may be necessary for the earning of their pensions (which also would be guaranteed by the British Government), or that, if the constitution is so altered before the close of their period of service as to make it difficult for them to continue in the service of the State, they shall enjoy a reasonable pension. • _ Another point left vague in para. 15 is as to who shall have the po^ver to order the reference of matters to the Council of State. Clause (9) lays down that Arab Members of Council shall have the right to refer to the Council of State any difference of opinion between themselves and the Secretaries. It would seem best to give all Members and Secretaries the right to refer questions to the Council and to require them, in the event of a difference of opinion between them as to whether a question should be referred or not, to consult the High Commissioner. 2. Functions of the High Commissioner. These are nowhere laid down except generally in para. II under the head of Reservations in favour of the mandatory Power.' There is no definite link between the High Commissioner and the Council of State, except his power of overruling the decision of the Council proposed in para. 15, clause (7). Supposing that a Member of Council and his Secretary jointly decide on some question tliat they will not refer it to the Council of State, there is no provision for its being brought to the cognizance of the High Commissioner. There should be some provision for a periodical report of the proceedings of each department which could be submitted to the High Commissioner and the Council of State for their examination. Another important point is the exclusion of the Council of State from the consideration of external affairs, including treaties and war. In view of the close connection of parts of Mesopotamia with Syria, and with the strip of desert' inter vening between Mesopotamia and Syria, which is inhabited by nomad tribes, there, will be many external affairs on which it is essential to consult the Council of State.. Treaties for communication between the French and British mandatory spheres, customs regulations, extradition, the right of pursuit of offenders beyond the boundary (this is a very important question on a desert frontier), will all undoubtedly4.

Some period of residence should be fixed for the purpose of qualifvin^ an Indian to vote. F 4 ' y &amp; C ommercial representation. Fhere is no specific provision for the representation ot commercial interests. Under heading {h) it is proposed that there shall be elected members representing the Jewish and Christian communities, but these communities are probably intended to be the indigenous Jewish and Christian communities. There should be at least one or two members to represent the interests of the big commercial firms, whether British or foreign. It might be best to provide that these members shall be nominated by the High Commissioner. 5. Para. 18. Functions of the Legislative Assembly. Clause (2) (6).—It would seem advisable to provide that, where the Council of State and the Legislative Assembly disagree about the issue of a law or the imposition of a tax, the matter should be specifically referred to the High Commissioner with a joint report by the Presidents of the two Councils. General. (1) There should be a definite period laid down for the duration of the Legislative Assembly.
