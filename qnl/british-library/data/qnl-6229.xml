I am sorry to hear Murray is not fit to come as His Highness seomei so keen on getting him. Unfotunately the Commissioner in Bin! is away Just now anl so I cannot consult him personally but will write to him iemi- offieially though I ioubt his being In a position to suggest a like ly man. With regarl to Monk who is so highly recommeniei by the High Coaunlssloner I really think we ought to try ani got somebody before November 1st. The telegram , unfortunately, does not make it clear if he is intimate with Arabs or Arabic ani as his work will have to be conducted practically entirely in Arabic it is very necessary that this point be elucidated. It will tend to make his task so difficult unless he is able to speak Arabic fluently. Might I suggest that enquiry be made from Iraq on this point and if the answer is satisfactory perhaps you would consider getting Monk down to Bushire for an interview ? In the event of your agreeing tnat November 1st is too long to wait I suggest that application be made to the High Commissioner of Egypt. I understand tnat in the course of the past year or two the European services in tha ocountry have been very greatly reduced and there may easily be men trained in financial revenue ani customs work who have had their careers cut in half by the new regime who would be willing to sojourn in Muscay for a few years I put f orwardthis suggestion earlier on to Colonel Trevor (as H.H* Is a great almirer of things Egyptian) but he, while agreeing, sals he thought we ought first to get an answer about Murray as H.H. hai specifically askei for his services. An enquiry by air or motor mall wouli not take long ani if unproductive Monk's name might thenbe reconsidered. May I Just run rapidly over the main points again the candidate should be physically fit, I think not over 40, energetic,tactful (and of course incorruptible), Arabic speaking and trained in finance ani revenue work at least; salary RsXSOO with free house ani furniture and the appointment* would be for three years certain, the first six months of which would be on probation ani a minimum of one month's leave a year.

The latter considers it most undesirable that correspondence on polit- -ical matters should be sent direct by State officials to private persons or other outside officials, and considers that on such subjects the Political Agent should invariably be addressed by the competent State official. The former will if necessary transmit such information as he deems suitable to the person concerned, consulting the Political Resident if it is considered necess- -ary. Colonel Captain R. G. Alban, I.A., Political Agent, Muscat.Colonel Crosthwaite is certain that xhomas had no idea of short-circuiting you in any way, and hopes that you will make this quit clear to Thomas, when you return him his letter and ask him to address you on the subject. CA-KSlL-■MlD . 0 . ITo • 283 —S. The Residency, Bushire, 12th August 1925. Kany thanks for your letter of the 5th August. I have already addressed Foreign about your posting and the answer should come in early September, if not before. I can scarcely believe that Ibn Baud intends to attack Oman, but I am writing to Mallam to find out whether case, you should try to keep Muscat State out of any intrigues, as I imagine that the Government of India would not allow Ibn Baud to encroach upon any port on the littoral east of Cape Masandam. As regards the Wall of Sur it would be best to await the return of His Highness before replacing him. However, if matters are even worse than usual, you may find it necessary to countenance another man being appointed. Horner is writing to you about some letters Thomas addressed to Sir A. T. Wilson under flying seal through me. I am astounded at Thomas entering into this correspondence, ♦ in great part about political matters, direct with outsiders, and thus short-circuiting the Political Agent. The truth probably is that Thomas has been in Government service in positions analogous to Political Agent and is now apt to forget his own place in the scheme of things. Thomas writes that the dining room floor is being re-laid, and I hope the dining room walls and drawing room walls are receiving attention. It is bad luck on you having the house topsy turvy during your time/ there is any talk in Hasa about any such movement. In any R. G.

Subject:- Recognition of Mr.Thomas as a member of the Muscat State Council of Ministers. Sir, In reply to your letter No.235-N, dated the 28th May 1926, I have the honour to say that, as I interpret Colonel Trevor 1 s remarks, he meant to suggest that there was a possibility of objection arising to the appointment of an officer seconded from British Government service, such as Captain Alban, the Financial Adviser of that time, as member of the Muscat Council, but not as regards an Englishman holding no official position. 2. In my opinion no objection exists at the present time to the Sultan’s request about Mr.Thomas. This officer under - stands his position thoroughly and,so far, has executed his duties to the entire satisfaction of all parties in Muscat. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, * mtmNo . 163-S of i926. British Residency and Consulate-General, Bushire, 24th April 1926. mm The Hon’ble Lt-Col .F.B.Prideaux, C.S. I. , C.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to correspondence ending with telegram No.l466-S., dated the 23rd September 1924, from the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, and to report that the Political Agent, Muscat, has been inform ed by His Highness the Sultan of Muscat that he wishes Mr. B. S. Thomas, at present Financial Adviser to the Sate, to be re cognized as a member of his Council of Ministers,and to be re ferred to in official correspondence as 'Wazir' (not Mr.) Thomas. In particular this officer will function as Finance Minister, but he will also have a full share in the govern - ment of the State. His Highness’ brother, Saiyid Nadir, will continue to be President of the Council . 2. As, from Muscat Diary Bntries, I have noticed that the State indulges a good deal in the according of salutes to members of the State Council, Walls and relatives of the Sultan I asked the Political Agent to inform me what the Rules of the Sate are in this connection. D e has replied that salutes from Pi . - T 'rJHHKSHIHEZSHBnHEBBMnBKSthe Sultan’s battery are given to Ministers whenever they re nt turn to Headquarters from Sate duty and to &gt;/alis visiting Muscat if they are brothers of His' Highness. It may be added that the heir-apparent also gets a salute. 3. As regards salutes from a British Government vessel, if Hu Highness is in residence, no salute is given to the St^e Coun cil or to individual ministers. In the Sultan’s absence, the President of the Council, or two or more Ministers collective ly, would, at the conclusion of an official visit on board, receive a salute. The possibility of a single Wazir represent ing the State on official business is very remote. That Mr. definitely Thomas should not be the minister in question can be asrixaigK safeguarded against. 4. In these circumstances I recommend that the Sultan’s request may be agreed to.
