Most of the notes are written on various kinds of headed paper, with the most abundant being those of the India Office, the Foreign Office, the House of Commons and the Carlton Club, Whitehall. Some of the notes are marked secret or confidential, while others make reference to received correspondence.In addition to these notes, the file includes a small amount of received correspondence, including letters from Henry George Gerald Cadogan and E C Ringler Thomson, British Consul General at Meshed.Also included in the file are the following: a photograph of Sultan Massoud Mirza Qajar Zelle Soltan [Mass'oud Mirza Zell-e Soltan], a Persian prince of the Qajar Dynasty and Governor of Esfahan [Isfahan]; brief historical notes in Persian on the relation between Uzbek leader Muhammad Shaybani Khan and Shah Ismail I of Persia; a map of the north-eastern tip of the Arabian Peninsula.Much of the material is undated, but those items that are dated suggest an approximate date range of 1892-1898.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000001452.0x0002b1#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
