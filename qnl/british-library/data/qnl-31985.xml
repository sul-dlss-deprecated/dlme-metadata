Jfl.. bir:- s M R in explanation of my telegrams to tb* Geniisjioner of comaliiand (December 8th and 17th) and ny telegram to tne oirdar (December lath), of all of whlcli I sent you copies, i have the honour to state that there is at present an unfavourable change in the general attitude towards us in Adis Ababa. HU. la OUJ, on. Of three or four chansea of eehtlment elnce the he e lnnln E of the „ar, ano „„ aoutt , Mn be others in our favour nn+ n our xavour. But tills last change has this importance, that it has produced the nomination of AMUnah 6ndik ae sub ‘£ovemor of the Ogaden, a few small acts of unfriendliness and a large crop of rumours. As an instance of these rumours, one of my agents (a not very reliable one) writes from Harar that it is believed there that Germany has accepted Islam, m this --faith 8116 burns lurches in Belgium and Prance, and for this the Sultan consents to fight for her. That the oultan and the German Emperor have advised Lij Yasu to send 5U,000 men to invade the Sudan, and have promised him Jibuti. 'illere are other stories of messengers sent to the oudan with Turkish letters to preach -Jihad-. These stories come from some Arab friends of mine, and if they ,,ere true » 11 ls possible that the Abyssinian Government knows nothing about them, l do not think that it is probable.In these countries such stories, absurd as they may De, have come importance, and usually for one that might reach my ears there are dozens which do not. ihe direct cause of this last change of sympathy on the part of the Abyssinians may be the Turkish war, the outcome of which according to the German Legation is w e fall ol Cairo, Khartoum, and Berbera, and a rebellion in India. Lij Yasu himself by birth and tradition, as well as by certain personal friendships, has many links with Islam. I have considered also the influence of money, but after enquiries I have not up to the present found that the Germans have any ready money in this country. How ever it may well be that Lij Yasu and his young bloods listen to promises of glory and loot and a road to the sea. The Prince is young and wishes to make his name as a warrior fit to rule Abyssinia. The appointment of Abdullah Hadik is very regrettable and gives rise to a natural anxiety in Somaliland. This man’s history shows him to be suspected reasonably of being a preacher of Tan Islam, to have been a messenger between the Sultan Abdul Hamid and the Somali Mullah, and between the latter and the Amir of Afghanistan (unsuccess ful) and a visitor to England, Germany, America and Japan. The Indian Government shepherded him out of India find refused him leave to go to Cabul. He was chained by Ivenelik on his return on the damning Abyssinian suspicion of being too friendly towards foreigners. I have no doubt that the Commissioner in Somaliland has better information about him than I have been able to collect, but it would be to the same trend. Abdullah Sadik seems to have been appointed to his newnew post by Lij Yasu himself, who as I have said above 1 b now very susceptible to Moslem influence. Lij Yasu also appears to have given him a present of several thousand pounds. The danger of this appointment to us might lie in fresh fanatical intrigues with the Qomll tribes, and in the sale of arms to the Mullah. This is also the view jI Wie Italian Minister, who as regards the Ugaden is equally interested with us for the sake of Italian Somaliland and the money invested in Brava and Mogadishu. I imagine that Abdullah and his friends in persuad ing Lij Yasu to appoint him, would have urged that Abdullah could prevail on the Mullah, an old acquaintance, to cease raiding Abyssinian taxpayers, and in return lor protection to cede to Lij Yasu some piece of coast line, such as Aeila or iierbera, taken or to be taken from the conquered Englisix. The possession of the coast to be.guaranteed by Germany, it would of course be also said that Abdullah an old enemy of ours would be a check on our designs, and perhaps that he as a leading Moslem could prevent the Turkish consul from subtracting influ ence and subjects from Abyssinia. The Commissioner of Lomaliland suggested that I should make a formal protest against this appointment, and I should like to explain why for the moment I do not quite agree with him. I have not made any such formal protest, but I can enter one at any time should you so direct me. A formal protest creates an issue eagerly watched. To fail in it, would be to lose prestige doubly valuable at present. To carry it through, it would be necessary to threaten Abyssinia, and be ready to find some means to renderrender the threat effective. Thle would appear to me to create new responsibilities, at a moment when they would be more than usually unwelcome. To put the tiling from the Abyssinian point of view, Abdullah is a iiarari and an Abyssinian subject. He is to rule in an Abyssinian province. He had already held for several years the same appointment to which he is now re appointed. He is favourite of and nominated by the rrince himself. Without finding any other arguments, it will be plain, that this appointment has behind it a body of opinion already strong, to which would be added the natural opposition bom fully amed in the Abyssinian head to any European interference in domestic affairs. I do not say that it might not be necessary to crush it by a threat, but at present I would prefer another way. I rivately from the Prime Minister Betwadet Haiii Glorgls 1 have received assurances that we shall have no | cause of complaint from this appointment, and that Abdullah is not to go to the south Ogaden where he could do most harm, but to deal with Harar and Jlgjigga only. Without putting much faith in Abyssinian assurances, I doubt whether a formal protest would have secured so much as this, while it would have created much talk and a greater importance for Abdullah aadik. Abdullah's depar ture is delayed and I will see if it is possible to con- s tinue the delay, when victory is plain even to an African mind, Abdullah and his kind will accept the will of God. He may be even utilised as a sort of Intelligence Bureau. I have invited him to come and see tie before he leaves, | mucl1 t ' Q his surprise and pleasure. This will further delay | klm as he will have to obtain leave to do so, and in the end I will give him a present and an introduction to Major Lawrence. It should be remembered I think that even if by someiiorue threat or other means I succeeded In getting his appointment cancelled, in the present state of the Abyssinian mind Abdullah's mantle and a double portion of ils spirit would pass to some younger and more carefully hidden man, who in the Ogaden would be bitterly directed by Abdullah from Adis Ababa. Major Lawrence I am very glad to say arrived at Harar on the 18th December. I have ualked over the appointment oX Abdullah with &gt; ^ French colleague, who volunteered a statement that if we found that Abdullah sold arras to the Mullah, he would be ready to close Jibuti. I confess I do not put very much reliance on this amiable offer, because Jibuti is full of smugglers, who are said to be the principal merchants of the town; also because Abdullah's arms could come from the Abyssinian Government and be never detected; also because it seems to our interest to keep on as good terms with Abyssinia for the time, and nothing would excite them more than even a perfectly ineffective closing of Jibuti at our request. There is aiso the use of Dejaz Taffari if Major Lawrence can make friends with him. Taffar^s father Has kakonnen disliked and mistrusted Abdullah badik. Taffari's private interest as opposed to Lij Yasu’s, whose heir he is, is Christian Jhoa as against Moslem Wollo. As Governor of Harar he will dislike a powerful and intriguing subordinate. He will not I hope be anxious to am the I ullah, nor to quarrel with England and France whose support he may some day want. Thinking on these line, I have not made the formal protest which was suggested. But I hope that the Commis sioner of Somaliland will on consideration agree, and will at least accept my real desire to help him all I can inhis very difficult work. Un the whole I do hot think that this appointment and the present distinctly uncertain attitude of Abyssinia are likely to cause us irmediate trouble. Lij Yasu is only a boy and very changeable. His I oslem friends may be dropped, or may never be able to persuade him to a move which might for internal reasons easily cost him his crown. Even if he did move, Abyssinia moves very slowly and is always divided in counsel. I any of his chiefs have grievances against him, and would avoid fighting for him if and as long as they could. Before he could do anything the war will be over. It is true that a reverse to us, more particularly in the neighbouring countries, might be dangerous here. But the cunning of the older men would be against any irreparable move until it was certain that we were beaten. Our victory would have a corresponding power for calm. A few intrigues and flirtations with Germany and Turkey are not of much danger if all goes well. I saw Li j Yasu this morning and was well received. (Signed) I have the honour, :.c., C. H. |K.

My dear Fraper, 7e have received a letter from Sir Arthur Hirtzel to the effect that quantities of old arms are being purchased in Turkey for Loslems in India, and he mentions that it is also rumoured that the Nizam is involved. This information regarding the Nizam is incredible, but as it is believed that the Hyderabad State has a considerable internal commerce in arms we should be glad to know whether there has been any recent impetus in the demand for arms from abroad which could account for placing a large order in Turkey. Yours sincerely, Sd/- J. B. Wood, To The Hon f ble Mr. S.U.Fraser, G.S.I., C.I.E., Resident at Hyderabad.Confidential D/O. The Residency Hyderabad, Bolamm 5th September 1914. My dear Wood, Please refer to your Confidential D/O of 25th Aug: about the rumour that the Nizam is involved in the supposed purchase of old arms in Turkey for Moslems in India. As you rightly suppose, this information is incredible regarding the Nizam, and I can only imagine that H.H's name has been loose- ly put forward by Sir Arthur Hirtzel’s informant as being one of the few Indian Mahomedan rulers popularly known outside India. Nor is it probable that there is anything more in the rumour so far as any of H.H'S subjects are concerned. As the Government of India are aware, the people of Hyderabad are thoroughly well affected to the British Government and there is no section arf of the population which would seek to acquire arms from abroad for the unlawful purposes that illicit importation implies. Equally little reason can be imagined for such im portation in connection with the internal commerce in arms. The Hyderabadi is able to manufacture every kind of arms he wants, except rifles, and nobody imports anything from abroad save an occasional nobleman buying a sporting rifle under a pass from thethe Resident. The fashion for carrying arms in Hyderabad city has noticeably waned of recent years and sale registers have to &lt;» be kept nowadays by all vendors. Thus an increased dealing in weapons could not take place without the knowledge of the City Kotwal, and in view of the character of the present incumbent of that office, I have not thought it necessary to initiate inquiries through the Durbar « into the matter, but have relied on Hankin’s Jong and intimate knowledge of Hyderabad, as regards both areas outside and inside y | his immediate charge. He is satisfied that there has been no recent impetus in the demand for arms, and finally, it is im possible to suppose that any local dealer could hope to import weapons from abroad in evasion of the p^^cedure prescribed by the Arms Act.

Under the circumstances, I think it best to take no action until we see that war with Turkey is inevitable, and it is particularly desirable to do nothing here that could be interpreted as indicating anxiety of nervousness.

[2189 u—6] CnDV tO ! «* 28 AUG 1914 !2 % It is particularly noticeablG, too, to what a large extent the spint of lawlessness that this unchecked violence has produced has spread among soldieis, and there is not the smallest room left for doubt that until such time as several offenders have received capital punishment the insecurity of life in which Greeks now exist cannot be generally improved. &gt; # . In the course of an interview with him to-day I urged on the V all m the most categoric manner the pressing necessity of restoring confidence to the. thousands of Greeks who have been intimidated into a, state of paralysis and whose inactivity and losses are exposing the province to a grave economic crisis. He fully agreed that it was his first duty to make some public examples, and emphasised his wish that, should any authenticated cases of murder that had been witnessed come to the con sulate’s ears, he should be informed. The Greek Metropolitan of Smyrna stated to me that he has a long list of such murderers, and holds witnesses in abundance, so that it is probable that the Mali’s sincerity in this all-important matter can shortly be put to the test, as he declared himself ready to accept Greek witnesses. The Mali actually went so far as to confess that he considered the Greeks’ mistrust in the Government’s unwillingness to put an end to the reign of violence by inflicting the death penalty on the foremost culprits was scarcely unjustified ; he himself com plained of the utterly inadequate sentences inflicted by the court-martial, and he said that it would be a point of honour for him to have the murderers hanged in all cases where conclusive proof is adduced. As regards the cessation of the general boycott itself, as distinct from isolated cases of intimidation since the 5th July, his Excellency Rahmy Bey has visited Magnesia, Akhissar, and Soma on the French, and Tireh, Baindir, and Eudemish on the English, line, and tells me he has “ stopped the boycott outright ” in these places, and that by the 15th July it will have ceased throughout the province. A franker confession of the Government’s role in stirring up and controlling the anti-Greek movement could hardly be desired. Indeed, his Excellency Rahmy Bey said textually to me : “ It was I whose policy it was to rid Turkey of the Greeks who have emigrated, and had the movement taken place as planned the coast would now be clear.” r I he Mali stated that at Arik Bashi, near Tourbali, on the 6th July he had some i urks bastinadoed, without trial, for having continued the boycott despite his orders. At this point he admitted, however, that he realised he was impotent to put a final end to the attacks on, and murders of, Greeks until he had hanged some of their assassins. Ihus, the cessation of the boycott means that at best the Greeks may now be free to buy and sell., but insecurity for the present will remain much as it was. In any case, this ‘ cessation of the boycott,” unless followed up by punishments, may only last a few days. I he Mali then told me that all the Greeks remaining on the coast, Vourla, Scala Xuova, and Aivali, Ac., must eventually go, and that should a war break out the matter of their removal would be simple ; he added, however, that they might leave be foie any such war, as during the coming months these coast Greeks would have a much more unpleasant time than those in the interior. .He somewhat contradicted himself a few minutes later when speaking of those in t le intei icr. At first he said that now the boycott was to be at an end they would be ice to emigrate should they desire to, but later, correcting himself, he implied that if t ie ; \ e t i urkey it would be in the same destitute state as the coast town emigrants ana that none of them would be allowed from now on to sell their property to others, am ie gave me to undeistand that even thus no general permissions to emigrate would be given.

Constantinople, July 21 , 1914. I 11A rj the honour to forward herewith a despatch from the acting British consul-general at bmsina, disclosing the programme of the anti-Greek campaign recently carried out in the Broussa, Smyrna, and Aidin vilayets. I have, &amp;c. ' H. D. BEAUMONT. Enclosure in No. 1. Acting Consul-General Heathcote-Smilh fo Sir L. Mallet. (No. 90. Confidential.) Sir, ^ ^ Smyrna, July 17, 1914. I HA\ E the honour to report that I have had confidential information from trustworthy sources as to the manner in which the expulsion of the Greek Ottomans from Turkish soil was planned; and therefore as to the methods most likely to be adopted should any further expulsions take place. The first stage was the appeal to Turks to get into their own hands the trade of which the Greeks had robbed them, and thereby to effect an economic renascence of the Moslems. The second stage was the commercial boycott of the Greeks, whereby the Turks’ economic renascence should be satisfactorily hastened. The third stage was the arousing of hatred among the Mahommedans against the Greeks, for which purpose the chief weapon was found in spreading stories as to ill-treatment received by the Turks’ co-religionists, wdio were forced to emigrate from Macedonia. These three stages prepared the way for the plan of expulsion, which, properly speaking, belongs to the fourth stage. The Government and the Committee of Union and Progress, or that part of it which may best be called the “ Boycott Organisation ” had agreed together upon the principle of expulsion. The programme too appears to have been drawn up conjointly ; and while the Government was to remain as the advisory body, and provide gendarmes to further the work, wherever necessary, the boycott organisation had the main charge of the executive department; it collected together all the undesirables and lawless elements from Macedonia and elsewhere who have been the tools in the campaign of intimidation w'hich was set on foot. Despite this, the line of demarcation between the Government’s men and the boycotter’s organisation was left sufficiently vague anc elastic, for the Government’s myrmidons (gendarmes, &amp;c.), at one time to be found working hand in glove with the boycotters, at others to be ostensibly restraining the latter in their excesses. . u . . This fourth and final stage in anti-Greek persecution that is, the expulsion stage,” where successfully engineered according to the established programme too place as follows : the instance of Pergamos may be taken as an example. _ Turks at Pergamos gave dark hints to Greeks that trouble was m the air ; others, in the way of friendly advice, told Greeks they ought to leave before a given day, it they valued their lives. The boycotters became more insolent, more threatening and more terrifying ; messages full of menace were sent, stiange new scou mg appeared in the town; doors .ere knocked at during the mght anonymo^ e s were received, one or two men were beaten, and an atmosphere ot impending-trouble was created and fostered. . , } rionrrpr it is however, hard to convince even an unarmed population that real clanger hangs ovmTwhen it has seen no blood spilt, and the Governments plan was to expel without undue bloodshed, if possible. i i i iii piiotvooted Suddenly, one evening, when the Pergamos Greeks were already half-distracted [2189 dd—Q] ljf^g||||)!||^^ Cor^ to fndfa 28 AUG 1914o by the nervous condition this atmosphere of terrorisation had produced, four leading Greeks there received wires signed by well-known Greeks of Oikili, the nearest coast town, “ General massacre of Greeks has started here ; fly for your lives at once.” The kai'makam, a former chief of police at Smyrna, a certain Arif Kikinet Bey, who was sent to Pergamos purposely by the Vali of Smyrna, Rahmy Be} 7 , being primed ^ as to how to act, and knowing the telegrams to be forged, is soon surrounded by a- band of panic-stricken Greeks clamouring for protection. His answer is : “ Frankly, T am fast loosing control of the situation ; I w ii] t however, be personally responsible for your safety to-night, but from daybreak on I can guarantee nothing.” Faced with the hideous possibility of a massacre the Pergamos Greeks, falling easy victims to the machiavellian cunning of the Turkish stratagem, put into bundles what little they can during the night; by sunrise the trek begins, and in a few hours the town is cleared of the hated Greeks. Such, it appears, is an example of the Turkish Government’s policy at its humane best. On the other hand, the Phokia incidents have been explained on very reliable authority, as follows :— The riff-raff whom the “ Boycott Organisation ” collected from Macedonia, and amon» whom are some of the most notorious bandits of Turkey in Europe, got out of hand in the Dardanelles district (Eshref and Sami Beys, the Circassian brigands and friends of Enver Pasha mentioned in my despatch No. 82, Confidential, of the 7th July, are connected with these bandits). Having tasted blood, and glutted with plunder in the north, they made their way southwards, seeking for fresh prey. Now the Government (qua Government) was sincerely upset at their presence, and did not want them • indeed, it feared the consequences of their excesses. On the other hand, these bands were largely composed of men who had the support of the “ Boycott Organisation,” that is, of the extremist members of the Committee of Union and Progress. To adopt too drastic methods against them might well mean a dangerous split in the Government itself, or, in any case, with a group of influential leaders, whose support was essential. Thus the Government’s only immediate course was to sacrifice Phokia, before which these bandits had arrived somewhat unexpectedly, and concert with the Committee as to the measures to be taken after. Consequently, Phokia was left with but ten or fourteen gendarmes in the presence of several hundred brigands, although his Excellency, Rahmy Bey. had more than ample time to send a proper force to protect the town. Finally, Talaat Bey was called for, and arrived at Menemen on the Cassaba Railway line, just as the raiders, having sacked Phokia, and perpetrated further atrocities at Serekeuy and Ouloudjak, arrived there on Sunday afternoon the Ri . une; these freebooters were fully determined to sack the town with its 5,500 Greeks that evening, and were convinced that the Government would tolerate or even approve their action. p a ^ Y 1 ’ Bey, u ’as at last really alarmed, and realised that after Menemem, Cordello, the suburb of Smyrna, and finally Smyrna, would be the towns to which the raiders would then turn their immediate attention. . He aiso arnve d at Menemen Station on the Sunday afternoon, and while walking renlv thev were to t] ?® town &gt;, ask e d '’here the looters were hidden.
