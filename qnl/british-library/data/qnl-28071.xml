March, 1937. vVith reference to your letters of the 7th of December and 4th of February on the subject of Wireless Stations in the Persian Gulf, I am directed by the Postmaster General to enclose f for the information of the Secretary of State, a cojjy of a letter from the Director General of Posts and Telegraphs, New Delhi and a copy of this Department's reply. No doubt the Secretary of State will be so good as to deal with the points raised in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Director General's letter.rs The Director of Telecorrmunications, General Post Office, London. No. yy-4371 , dated New Delhi , the 25th January 1937 . Sir, I am directed to acknowledge with thanks the receipt of information regarding wireless stations of the Koweit Oil Company Limited at Koweit and Bahrah forwarded with your letter No. 44250/36 dated the 30th December 1936, and to say that this Department has no definite information as regards the terms on which the Company has been permitted to erect and operate these stations. I am therefore to refer to the correspondence ending- with the India Office letter No. E.&amp; 0. 8026/36 dated the 8th December 1936 and to request that, if His Majesty's Postmaster- General has no objection, full details together with a copy of any specific authority which may have been issued may kindly be forwarded for the information of this Department. 2. In this connection I am to refer also to the wireless stations at Gwadar, Sharjah, Bahrein and Bushire. It is understood that the stations at Gwadar and Sharjah are operated by Messrs. Imperial Airways Limited while those at Bahrein and Bushiremmmmm &gt; Bushire are operated by Messrs. Cable and Wireless Limited, the latter stations having been taken over by the Company with the assets of the late Indo European Telegraph Department. Definite information of the terms on which these Corrpanies have been permitted to operate these stations is also not available in this Department and, before addressing the Companies, I am to enquire whether the British lost Office have issued any formal authority or could supply any information on this subject. 3. I am also to say that similar information is also required in respect of the station recently proposed by Messrs. Cable and Wireless Ltd. at Aden for which callsign AZY was allotted by this Department. Although, as explained by the India Office, the position in respect of this station will change from 1st April 1937, it appears that the station should be regarded as authorised by this Department for such period as it continues to use callsigns allotted from the Indian series. In this connection I should refer you to this office endorsement ]\ T o. W-4371 dated the 20th January 1937 forwarding a notification to the International Bureau that the callsign will be changed from AZY to VT^ from 1st April 1937 and to enquire whether it is proposed to allot a callsign to this station from the British series on the transfer of Aden from Indian control. I have the honour to be, Sir. Your most obedient servant, (Sgd.) p.J. Edmunds. Deputy Director-General, Wireless.■■■■■■■■■■■■ I Your reference »V.4371. P.0, reference 44250/36 COPY. Telecommunications Departiiont/ General Post Office, LONDON, E.C.l. March, 1937. Sir, With reference to your letter of the 25th of January, I am directed by the Postmaster General to say that the British Post Office has not licensed or authorised the erection or establishment of any wireless stations in the Persian Gulf or at Aden. The conditions under which such stations are established and operated are laid down by the Foreign and Political Department of the Government of India. A copy of your letter has therefore been sent to the Secretary of State for India. A wireless call sign from the British Colonial series is now being allotted to Aden. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, The Director General of Posts and Telegraphs, NEW DELHI&gt; ' v Telephone: NATIONAL 6321 ixtn.868 Telegrams: Gentel Cent London Your K'*''''rence PZ 8126/36 P.O. Reference 44250/36 Dear Cl&amp;nson, With reference to your letters of the 19th of October and 23rd of November, I enclose a copy (in duplicate) of the notifications we are sending to Berne regarding the two wireless stations of the Kuwait Oil Company. A copy of these notifications is also being sent direct to the Director General of Posts &amp; Telegraphs, New Delhi. We have to notify the precise frequencies which the stations will use and the details supplied by Kuwait simply stated ”40 to 120 metres'. Our engineers have considered the matter, however, and they think that the two frequencies 3750 kc/s (80 metres) and 3000 kc/s (100 metres) which are within the band quoted by Kuwait, should be suitable for the purposes in view. We are therefore notifying these precise frequencies and it, in practice, they are found to be unsuitable and some other frequency within the band is required, we can amend the notification later. We are assuming that only Kuwait will, on occasion, work to the Kuwait Oil Company’s ships. If both stations are to work to ships, a further three-letter call sign will be required for the Bahrah ^tation r Yours sincerely.6&gt; Draft Paper. p.z. 3531/36 J. Louden, Esq., General Post Office, E. C. 1. ^ iii 4599 5000 2.36 POLITICAL Department. 17 JUN 1956 Many thanks for your letter of 22nd May, ho.44250/6 about the use of wireless by the Kuwait Oil Company. As regards the third paragraph of your letter, I am afraid that our legal position is not as strong as it might be. Whilst, in our opinion, the effect of Article 5 of the Company’s Agreement with the Sheikh (a copy of which was enclosed in my letter of 11th May) and »J Clause 9 of the Government Agreement, to which you refer in your letter, is to limit the right of the Oil Company to wireless communication within Koweit territory, it would appear to be possible for the Company to argue that their rights are not so restricted and that they are entitled to 1 .rjrrjrnal communic ation^ with their Head Office cr with iU sc tKiSC their tankers, so—long etj &gt;thoy were- for the purpose of tte operations under the Agreement. However, the Kuwai-t—GiHr Company have not advanced this argument, nor do they appear likely to do so^so far as we can see from the papers which were forwarded to you in my letter of 11th May),swa4 we think therefore that it is better to leave things as they are and not to instil any doubts in their minds as to the correctness of their present/present interpretation of the Agreement by ashing for the specific assurances you suggest. As regards the second paragraph of your letter, we think that the Kuwait Oil Company must be aware of the general considerations in regard to wave-lengths and avoidance of interference, which you mention, and we think it is hardly worth while taking up this point with them. We are accordingly proposing, if Resident as in the draft attached. Tours sin (Sgd.) M. J. CLAUSONTelephone: NATIONAL 6321 Telegrams: Gentel Cent London TELECOMMUNICATIONS DEPARTMENT, GENERAL POST OFFICE, Your^T^^nce PZ. 2718/36. P.O. Reference 44250/36. LONDON, E.C.I. 22 May, 1936. Dear Clauson, With reference to your letter of the 11th of May, there is nothing in either the International TelecommunicatiQn Convention or the Regulations annexed to it to prevent a Government authorising a private company to establish a wireless station in its territory for communication with ships. It would not infringe this Convention if the Koweit Oil Company were allowed to communicate direct between their private coast station at Koweit and their tankers on matters relating to their operations. There are somewhat analogous cases in this country and elsewhere. I do not know what is the position of Koweit in relation to the Convention, but it seems desirable that the Koweit Oil Company should be required to work the station in conformity with the Radiocommunication Regulations attached to the Convention, particularly in regard to wave-lengths and the avoidance of interference with other stations in general and not merely those mentioned in No. 9 of the list of points enclosed with the India Office letter of the 7th of February 1934 to the Committee of Imperial Defence. It seems desirable also to have it understood, if it is not already explicitly stated in the concession, that if a public coast station is erected at Koweit, the permission for direct communication between the Oil Company’s private coast station and their tankers may be withdrawn.I am sending a copy of this letter to Brenan at the Foreign Office.
