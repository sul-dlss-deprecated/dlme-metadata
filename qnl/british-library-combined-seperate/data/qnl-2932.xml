The telegram provided a justification for the British Government's recent recognition of the Emir of Cyrenaica (eastern Libya), in the event that the Resident would have to publicly defend British foreign policy in respect of the former Italian colony and quash any speculation that similar action would also be taken in the former Italian colony of Tripolitania (western Libya).According to notes at the end of the file, the telegram was circulated to the Resident and Agent, Bahrain for information.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Adviser to the Government of Bahrain</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Political Agency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">creator</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Emirate of Cyrenaica</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Foreign policy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Propaganda</topic></subject><subject><topic>Public information</topic></subject><subject><topic>Intelligence operations</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0001a0#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
