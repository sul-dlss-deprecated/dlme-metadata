Object of Note.— The object of this Note is to afford information of ^ generaj character to the Secretary of State on the subject of the claims of Persia on Herat and Seistan. With this object in view, a summary is herewith submitted of the status and condition of the kingdom cf Persia, embody ing the principal erents in the modern history of that power, bearing on her aspirations and aggres sions eastwards, and the differences which have arisen on this subject between the British and Persian Governments. Area of Persia.— The kingdom of Persia has an area of about 648,000 square miles, with a length from east to west of about 1,400 miles, and a breadth from north to south of 900 miles or thereabouts. It is divided into 18 principal divi sions,* of which the general features are ranges of irregular mountains, interspersed with vast desert s, f and many oases here and there partaking more of the nature of valleys than of plains. So far as means of transport and roads are concerned 'the present condition of Persia is hut little removed from barbarism. Wheeled vehicles are practically unknown. Caravan routes are but tracks worn, century after century, over steep and stony moun tain ridges, by the feet of mules and camels. Bridges are rare, and where most wanted are represented by ruined piers of a bygone age. Caravans are delayed in winter by snowdrifts, in spring by torrents, and in summer by the great heat of the sun, necessitating short night marches. In this sense there are few countries in the world where the opening out of easy means of transport is more necessary. Rivers. —The principal rivers are the Karun, Kirkhat, Kizl Oran, Zaindarad, Jarabi, and Hindian, of which the Karun is the only really navigable stream. The principal sources of this river are at a place called Korreng, in the mountains of Zardah Koh. A few miles below Shuster the Karun becomes a noble river, exceeding in size the Tigris or the Euphrates; its banks are well wooded, its depth is considerable, and its current equal and moderate. This river discharges itself into the sea chiefly by the Khur Bahamashir, hut part of its waters are diverted westwards into the river Shat-ill-Arab by an artificial canal called the ilafar. These are at present the only outlets of the river. The Bahamishir is about 40 miles in length, and has a good navigable channel to its junction with the sea of not less than nine, feet at low water. The canal connecting the Baham^shirfC with the Shat-ul-Arab, now generally called the Ilafar, is about 3^ miles in length, with a good width and a depth of 30 to 40 feet. On it is situated the town of Mohammerah. The Karim is perfectly easy of navigation at all seasons for vessels drawing four feet of water, and admirably adapted for steam navigation from the sea to within six miles of Shuster. Both banks of the river are abundantly wooded, thus supplying plenty of fuel. If arrangements were once per fected, river steamers could easily ascend from Mohammerah to Shuster in two days. Boundaries. —Persia is bounded on the north by the trans-Caucasian provinces of Russia, the Caspian Sea, and the Turkoman desert; on the east by Afghanistan and Biluchistan; on the south by the Persian Gulf, and on the west by Turkey. North .—The Russo-Persian boundary west of the Caspian is now as it was left by Article 4 of the Treaty of Turkomanchai (21st February 1828), which deprived Persia of the provinces of Erivan and Nakshivan. Starting from the top of Little Ararat, it strikes the river Aras, and is con tinued along its south bank as far as the line of E. long. 48°; it is then deflected south for about 100 miles, when it resumes an easterly direction until the Caspian coast is reached at the mouth of the Astara river. From that point to the mouth of the river Attrek on the opposite shore the coast line is admittedly Persian. The Russians have, however, a naval station at the island of Ashumda, close to the mainland, at the extreme south-eastern corner of the Caspian, which, moreover, is closed by the Treaty of T'urkomanchai to all vessels of war except those of Russia. The northern Persian boundary eastwards of the Caspian is less easy of definition, the territorial rights of the Shah in the direction of the Turco man country being a matter of controversy. By an agreement, dated the 31st Xlecember 1869,* between the Russian and Persian Govern ments, the Attrek was recognized as the Persian boundary, which the Russians, who had in that year established themselves at Krasnovodsk, were not to cross. This agreement is understood by Persia as ap plying merely to the lower course of the river for about*30 miles from the Caspian coast inland, and not as recognizing Russian claims along the whole course of the Attrek to its source, which would imply abandonment of a large extent of indis putably Persian tenifcory.t That this was the understanding of the Persian Government at the time may lie regarded ys certain. YVhat may havt, been the Russian view is less so. Lord A. Loftus, Note .—Mohammerah is a town in Persian Khuristan, on the north bank of the Hafar canal, 26 miles below Bnssorah, ' r he British forces occupied it in 1856. Opinions as to its climate vary. General Williams and Sir Henry Rawliuson believe the climate to be deadly to Europeans between June and October, although w 11 adapted to the opera tions of war during the rest of the year. Lieutenant. Selby, on the other hand, formed a very high opinion of the salubrity of the place all the year round. The country around Mohammerah lies very low; the soil is an alluvial deposit, and consists chiefly of clay. The camp of the second division of the British Persian Expeditionary Force of 1857 was pitched on the open ground at a distance of about 1,300 yards south of the great nullah which connects the Shat-ul- Arab and Bahamishir, the main branch of the Karim river. * Sir E. Henslet’s Memorandum, 16tb August 1877, p. 4 | Ilertslet, pr&gt;. 10, 13.* Hertslet, p. 14. f Captain Napier’s Reports, p. 260. J Macgregor, p. ^65. § Colonel Bume’a Memorandom, 19th No vember 1872. j). Aitchiaon, VoL vi., p. 356. in 1873, stated that Russia claimed the whole course of the Attrek,* but the claim never seems to have been set forth in terms, or seriously at tempted to be enforced in practice. The Persian view as to her frontier in this quarter was stilted by Sir H. Rawlinson in 1873 (Memorandum in Letter to Foreign Office, 23rd May) to be as fol lows :—“ 1st, the line of the Attrek to the junction “ of the Simbar; 2nd, the course of that river (i. c., “ the Simbar) to its source in the Klmrcn Dagh, or “ Kopet Dagh, range; and, 3rd, the watershed di- “ vidinsr the streams which flow into the Attrek “ from those which run north-west towards the “ Turkoman desert, and water the lauds of the “ Tekkehs at the base of the hills.” From the 5Gth to the 58th parallel of W. long., and a little fur ther to a point south of Askabad, the line of the Khuren Dagh range is, no doubt, a good natural boundary between Persia and the settlements of the Akhal Tekkes. Further east the line is drawn by Napier to the north of Deregez and Kelat-i-Nadir, along the foot of the hills to Sarakhs on the Tajand or Hari river. According to him.f—“ South “ of the line thus drawn every foot of the country “ is in undisputed possession of Persia, and is, for “ the most part, now little liable to Turkoman in- “ vasiou; certainly no claim to any portion of it “ could be made ” (i. e., by Russia) “ on the ground “ of Turkoman tenure/’ East .—On this side Persia is limitrophe with Afghanistan and Biluchistan. From Sarakhs the boundary follows the Hari-Rud as far as a post called Kahsan.J about 7Q miles north-west of Herat, and from that point southwards to the Seistan lake is represented approximately by the 61st parallel of east longitude. Seistan was in ancient times, and especially under the Suffavean dynasty (1600—1722), a depen dency of Persia, 'it was a part of Nadir Shah’s empire (1723—1747), which, it must be remem bered, also included Balkh, Bokhara, Candahar, Herat, Cabul, and all the Mogul provinces west of the Indus.§ On the death of Nadir Shah (1747), Seistan became a portion of the Durani empire founded by Ahmed Shah Abdali. After the dis memberment of that empire (1773—1798), the status of the district alternated between one of dependence on Herat or Candahar, as the case might be, and independence. In 1855, the then ruler of south-western Seistan, All Khan Sar- bundee, who had received the country from the Afghan Sirdar, Kohendil Khan of Candahar, made overtures to Persia, || which resulted in engage ments which were renewed by his successor, Taj Mahomed, in 1858. Between 1865 and 1867 Persia took military possession of Seistan, south-west of the Helmund, and in the latter year removed Taj Mahomed, his brother, and uncle, to Teheran, and the Persian Governor of Kain subsequently occupied the whole of Seistan proper, t.*., “the country lying“ between the Hamun on the north and west, “ and the Helmund, below the Kuhak dam, on the “ east.” * In 1870-71, in order to avoid an armed conflict between Persia and Afghanistan, the arbitration of the British Government, in reference to their re spective rights in Seistan, was pressed upon both Powers, and ultimately accepted. Sir Frederic Goldsmid was appointed arbitrator, Persia claimed, not only the territory in her actual possession, hut a large additional tract enclosed between a line drawn east to a point a few miles south of Girishk, and thence south to Jalk.t This extravagant claim was rejected by Sir F. Goldsmid, whose arbitral opinion, however, given in October 1372, assigned to Persia “ Seistan proper,” as defined above, which constituted the most coveted and populous, as well as richer, part of the province, t The Persians were required to evacuate Nad Ali, below the ]\.uhak Bund, and both banks of the Helmund above the latter point were given to Afghanistan. The boundary, therefore, as thus adjudicated, stretched from Ivoh Siah, a point north-west of the Helmund, in a line south of Lash Jovvain, to that river, thence along its bed to the Kuhak Bund, and thence in a south-westerly direction to Koh Malik Siah, on the chain of hills between Seistan and Kerman ;§ from thence it turns south wards to a point a little south of Jalk, in about N. lat. 27°, where it touches Biluchistan. The boundary between that country and Persia has similarly been determined by British arbitra tion. By a series of encroachments, Persia, sub sequent 'to the year 1841, acquired the western portion of the province of Mekran, comprising the districts of Bumpore, Dizzak, Serbaz, Geh, and Kusserkund, and, in 1870, it was considered neces sary to arrest further aggression on the territory of 'the Khan of Kkelat. The result of much dis cussion at Teheran was that the Shah himself, in an autograph letter,|| proposed that Commissioners should be sent to the Mekran frontier by England, Persia, and Khelat, who should settle the boundary line. In this matter, as well as that of Seistan, Sir F. Goldsmid was the British Commissioner, and he, after examination of the localities, recorded his decision in a note, dated 13th September 1871, to which a map was appended.^ Phis decision was based upon actual possession, and defined the districts belonging to either party on either side of a line which touched the sea at Gwatar, a little west of the 62nd parallel of east longitude. The Note in which the British Minister at Teheran embodied Sir F. Goldsmid’s decision was formally ac cepted by the Persian Government on the 4th Septem ber 1871; but, in a separate Note of the same date, the Persian Minister requested that the line might be so far modified as to assign to Persia, instead of to Khelat, a small tract of country comprising Kohuk, • Aitcbiscn, Vol. vi., p. 366. t See map in Aitchison, Vol. vi., p. 343. t General Goldsmid to Secretary of State, 3l8t October 1872. § Memorandum, 10th November 1872. jj In Despatch from Mr. Thompson, No. 39, dated 15th April 1870.

Kunabasta, and Isfctnda, which lie between the Persian district of Dizzuk and the Khelat district of Pimjgur. The result of much correspondence* was that a ‘ c revised Note,” excluding the tract in question from Khelat, but not recognizing it as Persian, was sent to Her Majesty’s Minister at Teheran in April 1873, to be substituted for that of September 187l.f This revised Note has never been accepted by the Persian Government, which, therefore, in strictness, stands bound by the original document by which Kohuk was given to Khelat. It is, nevertheless, understood to have been in actual Persian occupation since 1874, and is considered by Sir H. Rawlinson to “ most decidedly belong to “ Persia, both geographically and historically.” { The question has been allowed to remain in suspense since November 1875. South.—The southern boundary of Persia is formed by the Gulfs of Persia and Oman, the Persian littoral extending from the mouth of the Shat-{&amp;- Arab, below Mohammerah, in E. long. 49°, to Gwatar, a little west of E. long. 62°. Upon this head it is only necessary to remark that, in spite of the great extent of coast line, and of the fact that along it are Bushire and several other ports of more or less consequence, Persia has no ships of war in the Gulf, any more than in the Caspian. The peace of the seas has for a long series of years been kept by a British naval force, and until the late encroachments of the Turks on the Arab coast no other flag was seen in those parts. In the year 1868 the Shah was anxious to establish a fleet of his own, but the project was discouraged by the British Government, and was not persisted in.§ FFest .—Concerning the Persian boundary on the west, where the territories of the Shah march with those of the Sultan, there is little on record in this Office. Nor, without the assistance of a map, is any intelligible description, even of its general features, possible. The exact details are still un settled. By Article 3 of the Treaty of Erzeroum (31st May 1847) between Persia and Turkey, it was provided that the two Powers should appoint Commissioners and Engineers to determine the frontier. Commissioners were also appointed on the part of England and Russia to assist in the work, and a map of the border districts was pre pared ; but the actual demarcation was not effected, and the question remained in abeyance. || In 1871 a renewal of border disputes led eventually to an arrangement that a Perso-Turkish Commission should assemble at Constantinople for the pur pose of carrying into effect the provisions of the Treaty of 1847. To this Commission the British and Russian Governments, at the beginning of 1875, agreed to appoint delegates.^ Sir A. Kemball was nominated by the British Government,** and proceeded to Constantinople in due course. The proceedings had reached their final stage when they were suspended by the outbreak of 3338. Bc war between Turkey and Servia in the summer of 1S7G, and by subsequent events.* The principal difficulty in the way of an understanding had been, and continued to be, the reluctance of the Porte to the retrocession of Kotur, a district of vital im portance to Persia as a defensive position, of which Turkey had, by a breach of faith, possessed herself in 1818-19. This point has, however, it may be presumed, been finally settled by Article 60 of the Treaty of Berlin. Inhabitants.— The inhabitants of Persia are for the most part Shiahs,f and number about 4,500,000 souls. The populations are largely composed of tributaries, who reluctantly acknowledge the authority of the Shah, and mountain tribes, who subsist by plundering their less warlike neighbours. The merchants of Persia are, however, a numerous and wealthy class, having enjoyed, amidst the dis tractions with which the kingdom has been afflicted, and under its worst Princes, more security than any other portion of the community. The attachment of the Persian nation to the Shiah faith has proved of paramount importance in re suscitating and maintaining its individual existence. The revolution which established the Suffavean dynasty in 1500 on the throne of Persia may be regarded as a religious movement which imparted new life to the nation, and enabled it to throw off the yoke of ages. The Persian citizens and culti vators are not warlike, but from time immemorial there have been three conflicting elements in the population of Persia which have been occasionally restrained by a strong sovereign, but which have always taken advantage of a time of disorder; these are the Persian, the Arab, and the Turkoman. The Persian nomads are the native wandering tribes who inhabit the ranges of highlands which stretch from the Persian Gulf in a north-westerly direction along the left bank of the Tigris as far as Ar menia, a region including Kirman, Pars, Irak, and Kurdistan. The Arabs chiefly occupy the level country along the shore of the Persian Gulf, and, whilst yielding more or less obedience to the Persian Government, have often maintained a rude inde pendence. The Turkomans are of foreign extraction, having accompanied at different periods conquerors from beyond the Oxus into Persian territory. A bitter autagonism exists between the Turkoman and Persian nomads. Prom the advent of Islam to the death of Nadir Shah the sovereign of Persia had always been either Turkish or Arab, and no member of the Persian nomad tribe had ever ascended the throne. It is this fact which probably originated that bloody rivalry between the two classes of nomads which is known in Persian history asAhe struggle between the Zend and the Ka^ar. Dimng the time that the former dynasty flourished Ispahan and Shiraz were the capitals of Persia, but on the accession to power of Agha Mahomed Khan, the founder of the new dynasty of the Ka^ars, the capital was transferred to Teheran (about 1795), * Sir A. Kemball’s Report, 14th March 1878. Letter from Foreign Office, 5th April 1878. f Note .—The total population of Persia is thus not much more than that of London ! The Shiahs recognize Ali (Mahomed’s son- in-law), and his sons Hassan and Hussein, as the only lawful successors of the Prophet, whereas the Sunis of Afghanistan, Turkey, and Central Asia believe the succession to have descended through the first four Caliphs or Chief Priests. The difference between the two sects on this point is bitter and irrecon- cileable. The Sunis venerate Mecca in Arabia, whilst the Shiahs esteem Kerbela in Asiatic Turkey, and in a lesser degree, Meshed, as the special head-quarters of their respective religions. In addition to the Shiah inhabi tants of Persia, there exist 26,000 Ar menians, 25,000 Nestorians, 16,000 Jews, and 7,000 Guebres in that country. i i5 7 which has been adopted as such by all the sovereigns j of the Ka^ar dynasty. Revenue.— The revenue of Persia is chiefly derived from the produce of Crown and Government lands, from taxes and imports upon the landed property of individuals, as well as upon every species of goods and merchandise. The following is a state- * Macgregor’s Gazetteer of Persia, 1876. mcnt given* of the net money revenue of the principal provinces of Persia, after deducting pro vincial expenses, and omitting the amount of revenue collected in grain :— Tomans. Khorassan 227,000 Azarbijan 020,000 Asterabad 23,000 Mazanderan - 102,000 Ghilan - 238,000 Kirivan 101,000 Ispahan - 332,000 Hamadan 65,000 Kirmanshah 79,000 Pars - - 403,000 Luristan and Arabistan 130,000 Ardelan (Kurdistan) - 32,000 Yerd - 73,000 Teheran and districts - 122,000 Kasrin, Khemsch,&amp;c. - 132,000 Central Irak, contain ing Kusbun, &amp;c. 312,000 2,991,000'thereabout or about £ 1,500,000 sterling. As the value of the revenue paid in kind is estimated at about 500,000 tomans, or about 220,000/., the total revenue of Persia may be estimated at about 1,700,000/. Army. —The army of Persia comprises a con siderable body of irregular horse, furnished by the military tribes of the country, and commanded by their own Chiefs, an irregular militia, raised and supported by the provinces and principal cities of the empire, and a force of infantry and artillery clothed and disciplined in the European manner. The cavalry of Persia is said by some to amount to 200,000 men; but as it is raised almost entirely among the tribes its numbers are de pendent very much on the means of payment, and as a rule it cannot be said to amount to more than 30,000 men. The Persian cavalry has of late years lost the reputation it formerly held. Eutteh * Ali Shah (1797) broke down the tribal system as much as lay in his power to secure in ternal tranquillity; the breed of horses has been thereby deteriorated, the great khans of the Iliats have disappeared, and with them the numerous studs which they maintained. The Shah’s body guard, consisting of about 3,000 men, is well mounted and armed. The regular infantry is nominally rated at more than 100,000 men, but what with false returns, in-complete regiments, and men on leave who never return, the number does not exceed 70,000. Of the above number no less than 25.000 are taken from the martial province of Azarbijan. The troops are armed with flint muskets and bayonets, although it is believed that the Shah has recently imported large quantities of breechloaders from Austria and elsewhere. There is a regiment of Nestorian 'Christians in the Shah’s service. The artillery amounts to about 5,000 men, of whom nearly half are from Azarbijan. This arm is the most efficient one in the Persian arrnv.* Tiie pay of a private soldier is seven tomans, or about 3/. 10s., a year, besides a ration of 3£ lbs. of bread daily. A battalion of 850 privates may be estimated to cost about 15,000 tomans, or 7,500£. annually. The Persian soldier is active, energetic, and robust, with immense power of endurance. Half clothed, half fed, and not even half paid, he will yet march his 24 miles day after day, and endure «very sort of privation. As the soldier is good, so are the officers the reverse ; they are for the most part worthless, more especially as favour and bribery are the groundwork of promotion. A person who has passed half his life in pursuits wholly unmilitary is suddenly metamorphosed into a full Colonel or General, or even into a Commander-in-Chief. The other ranks are filled in much the same manner. Employment of British Officers in Persia.— It is to the English nation that the Persian Go- Ternment is indebted for all the material of war which it possessed up to a recent period. Under the instruction of English artificers, in 1833 a foundry was established at Tabriz, where guns and shot of every description were cast, gun carriages were built, musket ammunition prepared, harness worked; and an efficient powder mill established. These warlike appurtenances were transferred to Teheran, where they are still in operation. The French were the first in the modern history of Persia to introduce a regular military system into her army. When Napoleon the First resolved in 1808 to take Persia under his auspices, he de spatched several officers of superior intelligence to that country with the mission of General Gardanne, and the scheme met with considerable success. It was not long, however, before English influence at Teheran became supreme, and when the French mission was compelled in 1809 to quit Teheran the same military organization as established by the French was continued by English officers. As this subject is one of interest and may become one of importance, the following brief abstract of the part which the British Government has played up to the present moment in this matter will be of interest. When Sir John Malcolm in 1810 visited the Persian Court he was accompanied by several British Officers,! who subsequently were employed in the task of disciplining the Persian soldiery. They withdrew, however, with the exception of three, in 1812. * Note .—The flower of the Persian army is drawn from Azarbijan. The Iliats of Kirmanshah have also a high reputation, and above all the regiments from the two famous Tek tribes of Kelhar and Guran, which were at one time commanded by Sir Henry Raw- linson. The Persian soldiers are enlisted for life, generally under compulsion. | Note .—Major Christie and Lieutenant Lindsay were the most noted of these officers. Major Christie was a man of considerable military endowments; he undertook charge of the infantry, and was killed at his post at the battle of Aslandu* in 1£S£: His succes sor, Major Hart, brought the infantry of Azarbijan to a wonderful state of perfection. The artillery was placed under Lieutenant (afterwards Sir A.) Lindsay, who acquired extraordinary influence in the Persian army, and introduced so complete a system of esprit de corps that his name is venerated in Persia to this day.• Page 517, No. 53 A., Secret, Home Cor respondence, 1859 (Persia). f Sir H.

H Letter to Foreign Office, 21st July 1868. ** Letter from Foreign Office, 23rd July 1868. ft Letter from Foreign Office, 7th October 1868. In 1833 a regular British detachment, consisting of one Commandant, a second in command, an Adjutant, an officer of artillery, an officer of engineers, a medical officer, an officer of cavalry, four other officers, and two Sergeants from each branch of the army ( Board’s Collection, Vol. 1355, of 1832-33, page 35), was sent to Persia, where it remained till 1838, since which date no British Officers in the service of Government have been similarly employed. In the instructions given to Sir H. Rawlinson* on his appointment as British Minister at Teheran in 1859, his attention was directed to the influence of the French officers, then established in Persia, and the advantage which would be derived if English oflicers could be substituted for them. In 1860 the Shah submitted through Sir H. Rawlinsonf a proposal that 10 British Officers should be employed in organizing a force of 10,000 men, and that the British Government should furnish a sum of about 100,000/. a year for the maintenance of the contingent. The project was supported by Sir H. Rawlinson as, amongst other things, thoroughly committing Persia to an English al liance. Her Majesty’s Government, J however, did not concur in the views of their Ambassador, but preferred sending a subsidiary force from India when necessary to support Persia. In 1863 the subject was revived by Mr. East- wick, § the acting Chargd d’Affaires at Teheran, who stated that the Shah was anxious that the Indian Government should lend him a certain number of military officers to drill and discipline his troops. Mr. Eastwick suggested tllfet four officers should be despatched for the purpose. Lord John Russell, then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, was inclined to support the pro posal, which was favourably received both at the India Office and by the Government of India. The allowances proposed for these officers were not enough, however, to induce qualified officers to accept service in Persia, and the matter fell through till 1868, when the Persian Charge d’Affaires at the Court of St. James again expressed to the Secre tary of State for Foreign Affairs a wish on behalf of his Government that British Officers should be sent to drill the Shah’s army.!| Sir S. Northcote to whom the matter was referred by the Foreign Office, renewed the offer of his predecessor^ to grant from the Indian revenues the ordinary pay and allowances of a certain number of officers whilst employed with the Persian army, leaving it to the Govern ment of the Shah to fix such an additional scale of allowances as would secure the services of men in every way qualified for the duties which would de volve upon them. This decision was communicated by the Foreign Office** to Her Majesty’s Minister at Teheran on 23rd of the same month. On the 6th October that officer telegraphed to the Foreign Officeff that the Persian Government required a Colonel and about 15 commissioned and non-com missioned officers. Mr. Alison at the same time 3338. Cinquired what scale of allowances would be deemed sufficient for them. The matter was referred to the India Office. While it was under consideration, Mr. Alison again telegraphed to the Foreign Office to the effect that it would greatly enhance their position were they paid entirely by the British Government. Sir II. Rawlinson and Sir R. Montgomery* re corded Minutes urging the expediency of meeting the wishes of the Shah as far as possible. Sir S. Northcotef, however, did not feel disposed to lay such a charge on Indian revenues, but consented to so far modify his former decisionj as to sanction the employment of a certain number of Indian Officers in the manner suggested, and to pay them from the Indian Treasury a reasonable consolidated allowance, it being left to the Shah’s Government to assign in addition some further moderate allowances. Lord Stanley, § the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, was clearly of opinion that a portion of these Officers’ pay should be defrayed by the Persian Government; he therefore suggested that Sir S. Northcote should determine what should be the sum to be assigned by the Persian Go vernment to each officer and instructor according to his rank. Lord Stanley then promised, when informed of this decision, to instruct Mr. Alison to state to the Persian Government that, on their signifying the Shah’s concurrence, and en gaging that the Persian pay should be regularly placed at the disposal of Her Majesty’s mission at stated periods, so as to admit of its being punctually issued when due, arrangements w r ould forthwith be made for sending the party from India to Teheran. Meanwhile there was a change of Ministry in this country, and Sir S. Northcote desired to leave the matter to be settled by bis successor, consequently no reply was sent to the above letter till 5th March 1869, when the Duke of Argyll fixed the strength of the establishment of British Officers, required to give effect to the wishes of the Shah, as follows, and added that the local pay to be received from the Persian Government, in addition to certain con tingent allowances, should not be less than that named :— Tomauns|j Commandant, a Field Officer w r ith the P er annuni - local rank of Colonel - - 1,208 Second in command, or Captain, with local rank of Lieutenant-Colon el - 600 Six officers, Captains or Lieutenants, with local rank of Major, each 500 - 3,000 [These should consist ot' two artillery and four infantry officers.] One Assistant Surgeon - - - 500 Ten Sergeants (tw o artillery and eight infantry), at 60 each - - COO One apothecary - - - 60 * See Letter from Foreign Office, 9th October 1869. f See page 524, Home Correspondence, Yol. 62.

The Shah was anxious, however,* thai the British Government should send the officers required to Persia, without stipulating that they should be paid from Persian revenues, although His Majesty would, on his part, not fail to make such a return for this friendly act (in the manner iu which they would be received and treated whilst thus employed) as would he gratifying to them. The Duke of Argyll,f in expressing his views on the subject, observed that the payment in full by the British Government of the officers so employed, — i.e., of their special local allowances, as well as of their ordinary Indian pay,— might appear to indicate a forwardness upon our part to promote an arrangement which had been acceded to only in accordance with the strongly expressed desire of the Shah. Indeed, it might be represented as, pro tantOy a subsidising of the Persian Govern ment for purposes of our own, and, as such, the arrangement might give umbrage to other Powers. Should Lord Clarendon see no objection on this score, the required number of Indian Officers should be furnished, who should receive their ordinary pay and allowances from the Indian Treasury, leaving it to Lord Clarendon to decide, with respect to their local allowances, w hether these additional payments should be made from the Shah’s Treasury or be disbursed by the British Government, either from Imperial or Indian funds. Lord Clarendon,^ while seeing no objection to the payment in full by the British Government of any British Officer who might be sent to Persia (as it would be, in fact, only reverting to the course pursued in 1833), was not disposed to recommend that any expense should be borne by the Imperial Government, and left it to the In^iia Office to decide what they were prepared to do in the matter. The Duke of Argyll after consultation with his Council, came to the determination only to furnish the officers, and give them from the Indian Treasury the ordinary Staff Corps pay and allowances, on the understanding that satisfactory arrangements were made for the payment by the Persian Government of their local allowances, on the scale laid down in the Indian Office letter § of 5th March 1869. The letter, however, em bodying this decision was never sent, as the papers were mislaid whilst in circulation. When they ultimately came to light, it was considered too late to take any steps in the matter. The question was again raised in 1871, || in a memorandum drawn up by Mr. Eastwick on the policy of Great Britain towards Persia. Amongst other suggestions contained therein it was proposed that British Officers should be sent to Teheran to drill and discipline the Persian Army. Copy of this memorandum^ was forwarded to the Government of India (Lord Mayo’s Government), which expressed so adverse an opinion to the scheme that no action was taken in regard to it.After an interval of two years the matter was again brought to the notice ot Her Majesty s Government by Mr. Taylour Thomson,* who ex pressed an opinion that the only means of averting the occupation ot Mervand other 1 urcoman districts by Russia, and the formation by that State of Turcoman Cossack colonies, was the furnishing ef a considerable detachment of British Officers to Persiaf as early as possible,—a plan which, in his opinion, would eventually lead to the necessity of a subsidy being granted to Persia.^ During the dis cussion on this question, the Marquis ol Salisbury expressed his opinion that, “ Rut foi In lia, “ England would have no interest whatever m “making Persia strong; and if^the step were resolved upon, India should pay.” Sir H. Rawlinson, at the request of the Secretary of State, drew' up a memorandum* in regard to the policy of employing a detachment of British Officers m Persia. It will suffice to say that he approved of such a course, and suggested that at least two thirds of the pay should be borne by the British Government. , The Government of India (Rord Northbrook s Government) did not, on the whole, view the pro posal with favour, and in forwarding their opinions to the Foreign Office,§ Lord Salisbury stated that he was “not disposed to dissent from the views “ expressed on this question by Lord Northbiook, “ although at the same time he entirely concurred “ in the opinion of the Government of India that “ an officer of the Indian Service should be attached « to the British Legation at Teheran, and that any “ substantial proposals for opening up communi- “ cations between the Persian Gult and the interior “ 0 f Persia should be encouraged.” The question of the employment of British Officers with the Persian army then dropped till 1879, when the British Minister at Teheran inquired whether Her Majesty’s Government were disposed to furnish officers to Persia to undertake the control of and organize all her artillery. j| The matter having been referred to Lord Cranbrook,^[ His Lordship, after consulting the Government of India, expressed his views as follows :— . . «« The importance of losing no legitimate oppor tunity of strengthening British influence in Persia at the present juncture is obvious. Whilst Lord Cranbrook would have preferred, with a view of attaining this desirable object, some substantial pro posal for the opening up communication between the Persian Gulf and the interior of Persia, as suggested in Sir L. Mallet s letter of the 17th August 1875, yet it is evident, from the continuous failure of the well timed representations of Her Majesty’s Minister at Teheran, to induce the Shah’s Government to come to any agreement on ^ this point, that but little hope can be entertained of the realization of the wishes of Her Majesty s Govern ment.” * Foreign Office Letter, 22nd July 1874. t Foreign Office Letter, 22nd July 4874.

His Lordship is not disposed, however, to anticipate any very important result from the presence of English officers with the Persian army, as he can hardly believe that any real and lasting improvement of British relations with the Government of the Shah can result from a measure of so partial a nature. But as a stepping stone towards regaining in Persia some of the influence which has so mani festly declined during the past quarter of a century, his Lordship is quite prepared, from an Indian point of view, to acquiesce in the proposed measure, it being always understood that no expense is thereby entailed on Indian revenues.” Note. —The general facts in this chapter The iVlODERN HISTORY OP PERSIA.— The ancient are taken from Macgregor’s “ Gazetteer of history of Persia occupies an important place Persia,’ and Wheeler^ Memorandum on j n anna l s 0 f Asia, but her modern history I ersia, o It n .uj. cannot be said to commence until the establish ment of the Suffavean, or Sophi, dynasty, about the commencement of the sixteenth century. A broad chasm of nearly nine centuries separates the modern from the ancient empire. The Arab conquest of Persia in the seventh century con verted the people of Persia from the religion of the Magians to that of the Koran, but at the same time it established a foreign yoke, and from that period till the sixteenth century Persia seems to have had no national existence. In the first instance * Persia under the Arabian Caliphs, formed a province only of the Arab empire of AD. 642—1258. the Caliphs of Damascus and Bagdad, and sub sequently she became a mere province of the , f Persia under the Moguls, A.D. 1258— Tartarf empire of Chengiz Khan and Timur. 15 ^ a The yoke of the Arabs, as well as that of Timur and his successors, was foreign, and consequently there was no bond of union between the people and their rulers, except the common profession of Islam. Even in the matter of religion there was a grave sectarian difference between the Persians and their conquerors, which had arisen almost immediately after the subjection of the country by the Arabs, and the conversion of the nation to the Mussulman creed. The Caliphs of Bagdad and the Turki dynasty of Timur and his successors were alike Sunnees, but the people of Persia had exhibited from the first a deep sympathy with the cause of Ali, and consequently belonged to the sect of Shiahs. The independent empire of Persia under the Shiah dynasty of Suffaveeans existed from 1500 to 1722. Shah Ismail, the founder of this dynasty, was a prophet of the Shiahs who successfully appealed to the popular enthusiam for the Shiah faith as a weapon to overthrow the Usbeg dynasty. The new Suffavecan sovereigns reached the zenith 2338. Dof their power under Shah Abbas the Great,* about the commencement of the seventeenth century. His empire extended to the Oxus, and incduded Herat, Kandahar, and the Persian Gulf, but under his successors the empire rapidly degenerated and the national life ebbed away. In fact, during the reign of four weak princes of his house who succeeded him, the Turks severed from the Persian empire some of the best of the western provinces, in the shape of Georgia, Azarbijan, and Kurdistan, the Iman of Muscat established his sovereignty over the Persian Gulf, the Afghans of the Abdali tribe made themselves independent in Herat, and the Ghilzaies in Kandahar, and in 1722, within a cen tury after the death of Shah Abbas, Ispahan was besieged by Mahmoud Shah of Kandahar, to whom the Shah of Persia (Shah Hussein) formally resigned his crown. The history of Persia under the Suffaveean dynasty thus ended in an anarchy which may be said to have lasted for nearly 40 years, viz., from 1722 to 1760, since the only intermission during the whole period was that caused by the usurpation of Nadir Shah; this period was followed by the establishment of the Zend dvnasty from 1760 to 1794, and lastly by the Kayar dynasty, which is still reigning, and of which four sovereigns have occupied in succession the throne of Persia. The modern history of the country is thus divided into six periods :— 1. The revolutionary period, 1722 to 1760. 2. The Zend dynasty, 1760 to 1794. 3. The reign of Aga Mahomed Khan, the first KaV, 1794 to 1797. 4. The reign of Putteh Ali Shah, the second Ka^r, 1797 to 1834. 5. The reign of Mahommed Shah, the third Kajar, 1831 to 1848. 6. The reign of Nasir-ud-deen Shah, the present ruler, 1848 to present date. In this first period Nadir Shah rose to power. In 1730, he drove the Afghans, who had for eight years exercised supreme rule in Persia, out of the country, extended his empire over all the territories which had been conquered by Shah Abbas, became master of the whole country from the Caspian to the Oxus and Indus, and connected himself by matrimonial alliances with the States beyond these boundaries. The Mogul f Emperor of Delhi gave his daughter in marriage to a son of Nadir Shah, with all the provinces west of the Indus as her dowry, whilst the Amir of Bokhara gave his daughter to one of his nephews, and paid homage to the Persian ruler. By this accession of power on Nadir Shah’s part he saved Persia from partitionment between Russia J and Turkey, which Powers by a secret treaty, framed in 1725, agreed upon that course. The dynasty of Nadir Shah was, however, evan- * The English first established commer cial settlements in Persia in the beginning of the seventeenth century, during the reign of Shah Abbas, when Sir Anthony Shirley and his brother, with a few followers, made their way to the Court of Persia, and met with a distinguished reception. Note .—The Afghans were impelled towards Ispahan, in 1722, partly by hopes of plunder, partly by religious hatred against the Shiahs. During the eight years which followed the abdication of Shah Hussein, the Afghans exercised a brief but bloody rule. The horrors of Afghan rule in Persia are inde scribable. Wholesale massacre, pillage, and outrage were practised by a brutal soldiery under the direction of no less savage mas ters. (Malcolm’s History of Persia, Vol. I., page 596, Ac.) » f Nadir Shah carried his arms in 1739 as far as Delhi, which he gave up to massacre and plunder. J During this period of anarchy, Peter the Great possessed himself of parts of Georgia, and other portions of Persian territory.* Note .—The accession to power respec tively in Persia and Afghanistan of Nadir Shah in 1730-47 and Ahmed Shah in 1747-73 are worthy of note as forming the bases of Persian claims eastwards, on the one hand, and of Afghan independence and aspirations westwards on the other. Whilst in 1730 Nadir Shah became master of all the Afghan and Sikh countries, during which time he transplanted to the Bala Hissar at Cabul the twelve thousand Persian families now known by the name of the Kuzzilbashes, or red caps, and took into Persia a splendid Afghan contingent of 16,000 men, Ahmed Shah in 1747 established his rule over the whole of Afghanistan, including Herat and Seistan, up to the Oxus, the Punjab, Beluchistan, and part of Persia. f Note .—Ispahan was the old capital under the Suffaveeau kings. Kurreem Khan, the Zend, transferred the capital (1760) to Shiraz. Ali Murad again made Ispahan his capital (1781) in order to overcome the Kafars in the Caspian provinces. Finally, Agha Mahomed transferred it to Teheran (1794), where it has since remained. X Note .—Agha Mahomed only assumed a small diadem ornamented with pearls, and refused to wear the four plumes by which Nadir Shah denoted his paramount power over Persia, Afghanistan, India, and Tartary. This is a significant circumstance of some political importance as regards the extra ordinary pretensions which have been put forward of late years by Persia to territories conquered by Nadir Shah.—(Malcolm’s Persia, Vol. ii., p. 287.) § Malcolm’s Persia, Yol. ii., p. 295. Watson’s Persia, pp. 48-49. cscent; he espoused the Suni religion, much to the horror of his subjects, with the view of maintaining his dominion over Turkestan and Afghanistan; he abandoned the ancient capital of Ispahan in favour of Meshed, and was finally assassinated at the latter place in 1747. Within a few years of his death, the mighty empire which he had recreated became again dis membered. Khorassan became the chief theatre of the wars and intrigues affecting the succession. Meanwhile* Ahmed Shah Abdali, an Afghan soldier of fortune in the army of the deceased Nadir Shah, established himself as an independent sovereign over the whole of Afghanistan, inclusive of Herat and Seistan, and seeing the atlvantage of a buffer between his new possessions and Persia proper, he induced the people of Khorassan to form that province into a separate principality, subservient to Afghan interests, under the blind Shah Rukh. The death of Nadir Shah was followed by a deadly struggle between the Zend faction of Ispahan on the one hand, and the Ka^r faction of Elburz on the other. The establishment of the Zend dynasty restored tranquillity to Persia for a while, although each succession was accompanied by civil wars which filled the country with bloodshed, and finally weakened the dynasty to a degree which eventually enabled the K^fars to acquire the as cendancy. In short, in 1794, after a series of desperate struggles between the two factions, Agha Mahomed Khan, the founder of the present Ka^r dynasty in Persia, established himself firmly on the throne, and transferred the capital from Ispahan! to Teheran, at which place the seat of Government has ever since remained. Reign oe Agha Mahomed Khan, first KaVir Sovereign. —The chief events which marked the reign of this kingj were the conquest, in 1796, of Georgia (which had, in 1783, transferred its alle giance to Russia), and the tacit relinquishment on his part of all right to Afghan territory. The Empress Catherine, in her wrath at the reconquest of Georgia and the excesses committed by the Per sians at its capital (Tiflis) declared war against Persia, and recovered temporary possession of the province, but in the meantime she died (9th No vember 1796), and the first act of her son, Paul, was to recall § the Russian army. Agha Mahomed was at length murdered in 1797. Reign of Futteh Mahomed Shah, second Ka/ar Sovereign. —Agha Mahomed was succeeded by his nephew, Futteh Ali Shah, whose reign is note- worthy as the commencement of that closer con nection between England and Persia which had its origin in the fear of an Afghan invasion of India, the designs of the French in the East, and the com- j)etition of other European Powers for ascendancy j* at Teheran. Captain (afterwards Sir John) Mai- Ij colm was sent by the Marquis of Wellesley (1800) j 116 on a special mission to Teheran, and succeeded in concluding both a commercial and political treaty with the Shah. Futteh Ali Shah’s reign is noteworthy also toi tlie commencement of that extension of the ussian frontier to the Caspian which is now likely to play so important a part in the future ol Central Asia. The retirement of the Russian forces from coi„ia m 1796 has already been mentioned. 1 he local dissensions which thereupon prevailed in that pro vince enabled the Emperor Paul, m 1800, to publish an ukase, by which he incorporated it with the Russian empire “ for the purpose of preventing “ further disturbances in that territory. On the Emperor’s assassination in 1801 the ukase was confirmed by his son, Alexander, who further ap pointed General Zizianoff to the post of Governor General of the “ provinces beyond the Caucasus. This officer, inspired with that zeal and disregard ot orders which so distinguishes the model Russian Governor of a distant Russian province, at once occupied Mingrelia (1801), captured the fort of Elizabethpool (1802), marched against Em an (1804), reduced all the provinces between Georgia and the Caspian (1805), and was only prevented from subjugating Baku (1805), a port on that sea, by his own unexpected assassination by the Governor of that place. . „ • j 1 Unable to cope with this new and formidable ao.rreesor, the Shah turned to England for help, aSd was refused. He thereupon made overtures to France. The imagination of Napoleon, who re garded Persia as part of the great highway leading to India, was fired at the prospect of a successful invasion of that country. General Gardaune was despatched at once on an embassy to Teheran, and laid the foundation of that military system in the Persian army to which reference has already been made. In' the meantime, England, becoming thoroughly alarmed, made great efforts to recover her ascendancy at the Shah s court, efforts which led to the withdrawal from the capital of General Gardanne, and to the conclusion first (1S0») pt a preliminary, and secondly (1812) of a definitive treaty of peace with Persia,* under which British replaced French Officers in the array of the Shah. It was not until 1814, however, that this treaty, with certain modifications, was ratified by the British Government. _ ,, 3 Whilst Great Britain and Persia were thus drawn together as allies in Asia, Great Britain and Russia were beginning to co-operate in Europe for de- livering the Continent from the terror of Napoleon. The new Russian ally was, however, unfortunately eno-a^ed in active hostilities with the new I ersian allv ° As earlv as 1812, when the Erench army was harassed by the Russians in the retreat from Moscow, the Persian army was cut to pieces by the Russians on the bank of the Araxcs, and the diplomatic complications which followed these events induced the British Government to reconcile the differences between Russia and Persia, ending Note.—By the terms of these treaties Per sian ports were to be opened to English and Indian traders. The Shah engaged to make no alliance with the Afghans, and to lay waste their country if ever they should invade India, and to exclude all Frenchmen from his dominions. On the other hand, the English were to assist him with military stores in the event of war between 1 ersia and the French or Afghans. (For fuller details s€€ Aitchison’s Treaties, Vol. p. 375.) Captain Malcolm's proceedings in Persia are unsparingly criticised and con demned by Sir Henry Rawlinson in his ad mirable review of 1848, pp. 9-10, on our relations with Persia, published in “ Englam and Russia in the East.” * Bv this treaty Persia bound herself to declare null and void all alliances with Euro pean Powers in a state of hostility with England, and to prevent any invasion of India through Persia. It was stipulated that the “ limits of the territories of the two States of “ Russia and Persia shall be determined “ according to the admission of Great Britain, “ Persia, and Russia that, in case of any unprovoked European invasion of 1 ersia, the British Government was to furnish the Shah with Officers and material of war, or, in lieu thereof, to pay an annual subsidy of 80,000Z.; that, in case of a war between England and Afghanistan, Persia should co-operate with the British Government; and that, should His Persian Majesty require assistance from the English in the Persian Gulf, they should, if convenient and practicable, assist him with ships of war and troops, &amp;c.-—(For fuller details, see Aitchison’s Treaties, Yol. vi.,. p. 391.)* Note .—For full text of Treaty, see Aitchison, Vol. vi., Appendix II. The ceded territory included Georgia, Immeretia, Mingrelia, Derbend, Baku, and all Persian Daghestan, Sherwan, Sheki, Ganga, Karabagh, and points of Moghan and Talisk. This treaty stipulated that “ Russian “ merchants, having entered Persia with mer- “ chandize, will have permission to convey it “ to any country in alliance with that State, “ and the Persian Government will readily “ furnish them a passport to enable them to “ do so.” t Note .—By this treaty, the Czar reserved to Russia, as formerly, “ the right of appoint- u ing Consuls or Commercial Agents wherever u the good of commerce may require,” and stipulated that “ Russian subjects, provided “ with passports in due form, shall be allowed “ to trade throughout the whole extent of 44 the kingdom of Persia, and also to proceed “ to the States adjoining the said kingdom.” (See Aitchison’s Treaties, Vol. vi., Appendix II.) In writing in 1836 on the effect of existing engagements on the interests and security of the British Empire in India, and the possible extension of the Persian monarchy in the direction of Afghanistan, Mr. Ellis, British Minister at Teheran, wrote to Lord Palmers ton (7th January 1836), “The success of “ the Shah in the undertaking (conquest of “ Herat) is anxiously wished for by Russia. “ The motive cannot be mistaken. Herat, “ once annexed to Persia, may become, ac- “ cording to the Commercial Treaty, the “ residence of a Russian Consular Agent, “ who would from thence push his researches “ and communications, avowed and secret, “ throughout Afghanistan.” — (Correspon dence, Persia and Afghanistan, 1836, p. 8.) The conclusion of the treaty was fol lowed by the deputation of M. Grebaidoff from St. Petersburg to Teheran as special Envoy. Following certain local disputes, the Persian mob attacked the Russian Mis sion (1829). A fatal shot was fired, and a citizen of Teheran killed. The Cossack guard fired upon the rabble ; the populace then swarmed to the top of the house, broke down the roof, drove the Russians into the courtyard, and soon despatched them with daggers. The Governor of Teheran endeavoured to quell the disturbance, but was set at defiance by the mob, and compelled to seek refuge in the citadel. Thirty-five Russians were massacred, the only person who escaped being M. Malzoff, Secretary to the Mission. It is remarkable that, although the mob carried away the horses belonging to the Russians .which happened to be in the stables of the British Mission, all British property was rigidlv respected.—(Wheelers Memo., 1876, p. 60.) As the Persian Government was not concerned in this affray, the Emperor Nicholas was satisfied that the persons mainly concerned in the murder should be punished, and a new Ambassador was deputed to Teheran. ^ Aitchison, Vol. vi., p. 361. in the Treaty of Gulistan* (1813), by which Persia placed herself for the first time at the mercy of Ilussia, by ceding to that power all the provinces which the Czar had up to that time acquired, and by engaging at the same time to maintain no navy on the Caspian. The progress of diplomatic relations between Persia, Russia, and Great Britain, from the con clusion of the Treaty of Gulistan to the renewal of the war between Persia and Russia in 1825, were of little practical importance. Both an English and Russian Minister resided at Teheran, and one of the main objects of their presence was to settle the Russo-Persian boundary, as laid down by the Treaty of Gulistan. Russia kept this question designedly open, and at length, in 1825, framed an excuse to take possession of the little territory of Gokcheh. This, added to a religious frenzy against Russia which suddenly seized the Persian populations, obliged Eutteh Ali Shah to launch into a war with his formidable rival, in which the Persians dis covered that they were utterly unable to contend against her. Disaster followed disaster, ending in the Treaty of Turkomanchai (23rd February 1828),f by which the existing frontier of Persia was laid down. The Shah, in fact, had not only to cede the provinces of Erivan and Nukshivan, in addition to all his other cessions, but to pay an indemnity of five millions of tomans, or more than 2,000,000?. sterlins:. On the conclusion of the negotiations, opportu nity was taken by the British Envoy, much to the chagrin of the Shah, to purchase the abrogation of the 3rd and 4th Articles of the Treaty of 1814, by which England was bound (l) to take part m the delimitation of the boundaries between Russia and Persia, and (2) to furnish Persia, in case of the in vasion of that country by a European Power, with officers, ammunition, and warlike stores, or in lieu thereof, to pay her an annual subsidy of 200,000 tomans, or about 80,000/. These stipula tions were deemed to he onerous and inconvenient, and the abrogation was effected by a payment of one year’s subsidy. Alter the pacification of Europe in 1815, and the removal of those dangers which had given such exaggerated importance in English counsels to the Persian alliance, no steps were taken to maintain that influence in Persian counsels which had been secured to England by the Treaty of 1814. On the contrary, much was donej to dishearten the Shah, and to impress him with the belief that the integrity of his empire was a matter of indifference to England. The transfer of the relations of Persia from the Imperial Govern ment to that of India, with which Futteh Ali Shah was not on erood terms, in addition to the non success of his efforts to induce the British Govern ment to substitute for the abrogated Articles of the Treaty of 1814 a general stipulation of protection which would at least evidence the wish of that 3338. EGovern men t that the independence of Persia should be preserved, gave a deep-rooted impression on his mind that the British Crown desired to hold him aloof. It is not a matter of surprise, therefore, that British influence rapidly gave way at Teheran to that of Bussia, and that the Shah, reckless of con sequences and encouraged by Bussia, endeavoured to recoup himself for his loss of territory on the west by expeditions towards the east, against Herat and elsewhere. They all, however, ended in comparative failure, and he himself died on 23rd October 1834, after an eventful reign of 37 years. Beign of Mahomed Shah, 3rd Kajar Sove reign of Persia. —Mahomed Shah’s reign was marked by a renewal of Persian designs, under Bussian influence, eastwards; the Shah not only aimed at Herat and Seistan, but put forward an arbitrary claim on Afghan territory as far as Ghuznee. To enforce these claims, he commenced in 1838, under Bussian instigation, that memorable siege of Herat, which lasted nine months. It is unnecessary for the objects of this note to re- count^ the story of its defence by Yar Mahomed Khan, assisted by Lieutenant Eldred Pottinger. It is sufficient to say that, in the spring of 1838, Mr. McNeill, the British Minister at the Court of Persia, arrived in the camp of the besiegers, and unsuccessfully endeavoured to persuade the Shah to abandon the siege, whilst Count Simonich, the Bussian Envoy Extraordinary, prompted His Majesty to renew his efforts for the capture of the city. At length, however, the Shah, realizing that the Persian occupation of any portion of Afghanistan would be regarded by Her Majesty’s Government as a hostile demonstration against England, and that five ships of war had already arrived in the Persian Gulf to take possession of the Island of Karrack; failing, moreover, on the 23rd of June 1838, in a final and desperate assault on Herat, he raised the siege, and restored the fortress of Ghorian, which had been in Persian hands since 1837, to the ruler of Herat. Two years afterwards, the diplomatic relations which had been temporarily broken off between the British* and Persian Governments were renewed, and Persia was compelled to abandon, for the moment, any further operations eastwards. No further events of any moment affecting England occurred during the reign of Mahomed Shah, who died on the 4th of September 1848, after a reign of 14 years. He was succeeded by his son and heir, Nassir-ud-deen, the present Shah, at the age of 16 years. Beign of Nassir-ud-deen, 4th Kajar Sove reign of Persia.— The young Nassir-ud-deen, after being separately and conjointly recognized as the lawful successor to the throne by the British and Bussian Governments, made his public entry into Teheran on the 20th October 1848, and was * Note .—Failing in their intrigues at Herat, the Russians turned their attention to Khiva, against which, in I8S9, they launched, under General Perovski, an expedition which ended in complete failure. It was at this period that Baron Brunnow, anticipating Perovski’s success, and deprecating the ex pected advance of the British beyond the Hindu Khush into Khulm, made the pro phetic remark, “ If we go on at this rate, “ Sir John, the Cossack and the sepoy will “ soon meet on the banks of the Oxus,” to which the President replied, with more spirit than self-conviction, “ Very probably, Baron, “ but, however much I should regret the “ collision, I should have no fear of the re- u suit.”—(Rawlinson’s England and Russia in the East, p. 63.)19 Note .—Mirza Taku Khan was reported to the Shah by a Court faction as aiming at sovereignty. The Shah gave heed to the warning, and put him under surveillance. The Russian Minister interfered authorita tively in his behalf. This irritated the Shah, who ordered him to be bled to death. His young wife, the Shah’s sister, was distracted, and the Shah, seized with remorse, betrothed the two infant daughters of the murdered man to two of his own sons.

One of his first acts was the cruel execution of a favourite Minister, to whom he had previously married his sister. The secret archives of the Teheran Court would, no doubt, disclose many other similar acts on his part between that and the present period. His disposition is believed to be headstrong and cruel, and he has, in recent years, become less temperate than the preservation of his health demands; he is said to be (at the age of 57) irritable and capri cious.* The autocratic character of the Kussian Government is believed to have some attractions for him in contradistinction to the monarchial character of the British constitution. He under stands and admires the one, he misunderstands and mistrusts the other. Whatever other faults modem Persia may have, one of them is not that of revolution, for since the establishment of the Kajar dynasty in 1794 the country has faithfully obeyed its Sovereign, and afforded a striking contrast in this respect to Afghanistan. On the one side has been exhibited, at any rate, a settled Government and safety for European agents and travellers; while the other presents a mournful record of murder, division, and treachery, which has compelled the British Govern ment twice to invade the country at a considerable sacrifice of money and men. It is perhaps intel ligible that Afghanistan has been allowed in recent years to assume a more important n&gt;7&lt;? in questions affecting the Indian frontier than the more distant Persia, and yet it seems regrettable that England should have relied so much on the one power, which has always been factious, treacherous, and unsafe, and should have done so little for the other, which, to say the least of it, has been united, peaceful, and safe. India is comparatively as near to Persia from her position in the Persian Gulf as Russia is from her position on the Caspian; our interests at Teheran are weighty ; and, as long as Persia holds the high road from the Caspian into Afghanistan and India, so long is her friendship and alliance of importance to England. Our attitude towards her, however, has been chiefly remarkable for extremes of heat and cold, till at last Persia mistrusts us, and we ourselves are doubtful as to whether she is not too much a creature of Russia to make any prospect of a closer alliance with her agreeable or satisfactory. On this point Sir Henry Rawlinsonf remarks truly enough: — “There is probably no pobtical question con nected with our Indian Empire which has been treated more frequently, or with greater discrepancy of result, than that which pretends to fix the nature, the limits, and the value, of the true interests that we possess in Persia. “ Party-writers and economists, historians and pamphleteers, statesmen and journalists, have, at different periods and under different phases of the subject, examined it with more or less of20 competency and care; and, if the acts of Govern ment may be taken as an index of the pressure of the times, the effect of these varied agencies upon the public mind must have been to invest our relations with Persia, in popular opinion, with every possible degree of consideration, from that of absolute vitality to one of comparative worthlessness. We commenced with a magnificent embassy, which was followed by complete isola tion. We descended in our next essay like Jupiter in an avalanche of gold, but ere long we took advantage of poor Danae’s distress to drive a bar gain with her of extraordinary rigour, and even of doubtful honesty. A third time we beheld our Syren transformed into a Hydra, and we plunged into a contest on her account, as momentous as any that figures in the page of Indian history; and yet, although the issue of that war must have in creased tenfold our danger, if such danger ever had existed, we have since its conclusion held on our way with an inert complacency that would hardly have been justified in our palmiest days of security and strength. “ £ Nil fuit unquam f Sic impar sibi.’ “ The most remarkable circumstance, however, is, that while we have exhibited this strange incon sistency, while we have belied, in respect to Persia, the otherwise traditional character of our Eastern policy, if there has been one branch of our Indian interests which, from its nature, has been not only less than any other altered, but has been less susceptible of alteration, it is that which relates to the value (be it for good or ill) of our connection with the Court of Teheran.” Before Nassir-ud-deen had been many years on the throne, he threw himself more vigorously than any of his predecessors into the traditional policy which actuates every true Persian as to extension of sovereignty eastwards. The main object of the Shah’s ambition w r as the possession of Herat. This feeling on his part, although unacceptable to the English Government of that day, can hardly be wondered at, considering the influence exercised over every Persian heart by the mythical glories of the ancient empire of Darius Hystaspis, the splen did conquests of Shah Abbass the Great, and the vast though evanescent empire of Nadir Shah. Major St. John, H.E., who has an intimate know ledge of Persian thought and feeling, writes* on this subject as follows :— “ Now that we are on the subject of Herat, it may be well to explain the motives which may be supposed to actuate Persia in her repeated attempts to possess herself of it; for it appears to me that English writers have been too much in the habit of taking it for granted that they were uncalled-for aggressions, prompted only by reckless ambition, and the insidious wiles of the Russian wire puller, intent on his own evil designs against India. In * Lecture to U. S. Institution, London, 1878. vthe first place, Herat is far more Irani than Pathan It formed as much a part of Persia up to the death of Nadir as did Mashad or Karman. It is geogra phically in Persia, from which its recent seyerance, recent, that is to say, in comparison with the antiquity of its history, has been equally disastrous to its own interests and those of its ancient mother country, without doing any particular service to its Afghan masters. This is due to its strategical position with reference to Mashad and Marv. All three are strong positions, and form a triangle with sides from 150 to 200 miles in length. That be tween Mashad and Marv is the shortest, and is broken by a track of desert 50 miles wide. The other two sides pass through a country uniformly fertile and well watered. Prom the Black Sea to China stretches a vast chain of mountains, shutting off the rich countries of southern Asia from the arid deserts of the north. At one point they sink into comparative insignificance, and this gap is guarded by the trilateral, Herat, Mashad, Marv. Prom the earliest times these three cities have formed the bulwark of Iran against Turan, of civilization against barbarism. Only great conquerors such as Jangis and Taimur were able to pass then, and not, it will be admitted, for the benefit of mankind. As long as the fortresses at the base, Mashad and Herat, remained in the same hands, they were able to hold Marv as a common outwork; and it con tinued to be a flourishing commercial centre, to keep the Turkman savages of the Kbarismian desert in check, and to protect the fertile lands within and beyond the triangle. After Nadir’s death Mashad and Herat were divided, the former remaining to Persia, the latter forming part of the Durani Empire founded by Ahmad Shah. The consequence was that Marv was soon abandoned by its peaceful inhabitants, and fell into decay, while in the country between it and Herat, and the latter and Mashad, little more than ruins remain to attest its former prosperity. By the gate thus opened the Turkmans carried their raids far into the heart of Persia, and the ruler of Herat, for many years before and after its first siege, was a bloodthirsty tyrant whose cruelties disgusted Pottinger, and who carried on a lucrative traffic by abetting the Turk mans in manstealing, even selling his own bhiah subjects into slavery. “ Now, though I have no w T ish to contest the right and justice of England preventing the Persians from retaining Herat, I think you will agree with me that there is something to be said from their side of the question, and that they are not unreasonable in considering their motives for wanting Herat more powerful than ours for keeping them out ot it. Recent events have, indeed, somewhat strengthened their view of the matter, for it must be admitted that, were Herat at the present time a Persian instead of an Afghan town, we should not now be contemptuously excluded from entering it.As the subject of Herat occupies a considerable portion in the history of Nassir-ud-deen’s reign, it is desirable, for convenience sake, to treat that question, as well as those relating to Seistan, Kohuk, the navigation of the Karun river, the integrity of Persia, and Persian relations with Merv, in separate chapters. Persia and Herat. —The province of Herat contains the districts of :— 1. Ghorian. —A district in Western Afghanistan, professedly dependent on Herat, from which city the capital, Ghor, is distant 120 miles south-east. It is inhabited by the tribe of Taimunis, and is practically independent of Herat, whose Chief is unable to levy taxes on the people. Though now insignificant, Ghor was at one time the capital of sovereigns whose power extended (1150) over Khorassan, Afghanistan, Sind, and Lahore. In 1845 Ghor was brought under subjection by Yar Mahomed of Herat. In 1861 a quarrel occurred between Abdul Ghafur, the Taimuni Chief, and the Governor of Parah, and the latter made a sudden attack on the former. In retaliation for this, Sultan Ahmed, at that time ruler of Herat, seized on Parah, and this furnished Host Mahomed with an excuse for the capture of Herat, which he accomplished in 1863. 2. Sabzawar. —A town, 93 miles from Herat, 71 from Parah, and 286 from Candahar. The district is a congerie of forts, with surrounding pasturage and cultivation, inhabited by Nuzzai Huranies. It is one of the richest districts in Herat, and has a position of some strategic im portance. The district supplies a horse contingent of 300 sowars, but in an emergency some 3,000 horse and foot could be available for war if required. 3. Parah. —A town, 164 miles south of Herat, on the Candahar road, and 160 from Girishk. The modern town of Parah is about a mile in diameter, surrounded by an enormous embankment of earth, from 35 to 40 feet in height. The citadel occupies the northern angle of the town, which has only two gates, that of Herat on the north side and Candahar on the south. Parah is a military position of extreme importance, as it commands the Herat and Candahar road and the northern entrance to Seistan. The water in the fort is bad, and fever very prevalent. 4. Bakwa —A large deserted plain, 100 miles from Girishk and 33 miles from Farah. Anciently it contained many villages, but, during the last last century, it has been the theatre of the almost constant wars between Candahar and Herat, and the result has been that the inhabitants have fled from the perpetual miseries entailed upon them by their frontier position between the two provinces. Macgregor’s Gazetteer of Afghanistan, 1871. Burne’s Sketch of Herat, 7th Febrnary 1838. Napier’s Journals, 1876, p. 226.

It has always been treated by Dost Mahomed and Shere AH as a sort of separate dependency.23 * Napier’s Volume of Journals and Reports, p. 226. | This district consists of the three divisions of Lash, Jowain, and Kala Kah. It can furnish some 500 horsemen and 5,000 in fantry. It is inhabited by the Ishak/ai class of Afghans, and under the semi-independent Chief of Lash. Lash is a strong fort, 60 miles west of Farah. Its position, with reference to Herat, Persia, and Candahar, is of great strategical importance, as it enables an army advancing from Persia to Candahar to avoid Herat altogether. For this reason, the Chief is always possessed of much political importance. X Taylor says that the several tribes subor dinate to, or in the neighbourhood of, Herat could also collectively assemble 47,000 horse and 23,000 foot. § Macgregor’s Gazetteer of Afghanistan, p. 340. Vambery. 5. Kurak. —A small unimportant district. 6. Obeh. —A town, 87 miles from Kelat-i-Ghilzai, on an open waste plain. Supplies are scarce, but water and grass plentiful. The whole plain in the vicinity is covered wdth flocks of sheep and goats, &amp;c. The district is a small one, inhabited by Taraki Ghilzais and a few Durams. The boundaries of the province of Herat are somewhat obscure. The northern boundaries * are completely unde fined. There is a broad undulating tract of de batable land, waste, but not deficient in grass and water, lying between the frontier villages of Herat and the settlements of the Sark and Salor Turco mans on the river Murghab, across which there is no defined boundary line. The Eimaks of Herat and the Turcomans of the Murghab traverse it, and graze their flocks on it, but never in security. Certain portions of territory north and north-east of Herat, once in possession of Yar Mahomed Khan (1838), are now unapproachable to travellers and caravans. On the south the province extends to the limits of Sabzawar and Farah, and is bounded by Lash Jowainf and Seistan. The mountainous tract of the Hazaras and the district of Candahar surround the province eastwards, and Persia and the Hari Rud westwards. The male population of Herat capable of bearing arms is stated by Perrier J to be 70,000. The town of Herat lies 2,650 feet above the sea, in lat. 34° 22' and long. 62° 9'. It is situated on the right bank of the Hari Rud, in a fertile and well watered valley, 30 miles long from east to west, and 15 miles broad, surrounded by lofty mountains, and capable of affording supplies to 150,000 men. It is of a nearly square form, sur rounded by very high walls, erected on the top of a largo rampart of earth, and a deep wet ditch. The town is well supplied with the best water, not only from numerous wells but from reservoirs of water brought in from the Hari Rud. The Ark- i-nao, or New Citadel, is a weak structure of sun- dried bricks and earth erected in the north-east angle of the city. To render the fortifications at all defensible would take, according to an estimate framed by Major Saunders in 1838, 6.^ lacs of rupees. The population of the town has been subject to very great fluctuations, but may be estimated at about 40,000. The inhabitants are mostly § Shiahs, intermixed with Afghans, Hazaras, Tai- munis, settled by Yar Mahomed, and a few families of Hindoos and Jews. The original in habitants of Herat appear to have been Persians, and to have belonged to the race that spread itself from Seistan towards the north-east, and formed the ancient province of Khorassan, of which, until recent days, it remained the capital. In later times, the immigration, of which Jangiz and Timur were the cause, led to the infusion of Turko-Tartary24 Wood into the veins of the ancient population. The citadel is inhabited, for the most part, by Asians who settled there in the last century to maintain and spread the influence of country, and are now mostly merchan s.

In 1868 he accompanied the latter, with 2,000 horsemen of his tribe, to Girishk, Candahar, and Cabul, and was present at all the battles fought during that campaign. A section of the tribe, under one of the minor Chiefs, Alla ^ar Khan, migrated to Meshed after the siege in 1857. They number 500 families, and have fixed location. The tribe is of' Persian descent, and their language is Persian. They formerly held the course of the Murghab as far as Punjdeh. The Pirozkohi, also by tradition of Persian origin, are now the most powerful, wealthy, and numerous tribe of the Eimak. They number 15,000 tents, and can mount 5,000 men. They hold the whole tract of mountains, stretching from about two days’ journey, i.e., 40 to 50 miles north east of Herat to the borders of Maimena. Their principal locutions are the pastures of Kadis, Singar, Shahr-i-Armiyan, and Koocha Karma. Their most prominent Chief is Futhoolla Beg of Chukcheran, son of Sirdar Mahomed Azim Khan, Attalik, said to be devoted to the cause of Yakoob Khan, and also on good terms with the Jamshidi Chief. He accompanied Yakoob Khan on his campaign in Afghanistan with 1,000 horse. The second in importance is Behram Khan, head of a section of 5,000 tents. A few hundred only of the Firozkohi are enter tained permanently at Herat. The language of the tribe is Persian. The Taimuni, said to be of pure Tartar race, hold the mountains of Ghor, south of Herat; they are a large and powerful tribe, but, being scattered, they appear to have less direct influence on its affairs than the tribes above mentioned. A large proportion of the tribe live in fixed villages in the mountains. They number 30,000 houses and tents, and are able to furnish 5,000 horse and 15,000 to 20,000 footmen. Their prin cipal locations are,—Persi, 20 fursakhs south-east of Herat; Tigar Aslan, near Persi; Jewajah, 10 fursakhs beyond Persi; Sokhar, 40 fursakhs south from Herat ; and Tiwara, south-east of Herat. Their principal Chiefs are Ghaffar Khan, who ac companied Yakoob Khan in 1868 with 1,000 horse,- and Atta Khan, son of Azad Khan of Persi, who is entertained at Herat and has under him 5,000 tents. The Hazara, reckoned among the Char Eimaks, are a section of the great tribe, holding the line of the Hindoo Koosh, from the valley of the Oxus to that of the Helmund. They have, however, been long separated from the main body and subject to Afghan influence through their location at Kala Now, to the north-east of Herat, and have accepted the Sunni creed. They were entirely dispersed byYar Mahomed Khan, and are now to be found principally in Persian territory. Two thousand families were brought to Mashad, and granted lands in Isferayeen, after the last siege of Herat, their Chief Yusuf Khan, of the Baj-Boghar tribe, being given the rank and pay of a colonel in the Persian service. There are also some families in the town of Mashad, and in Jam and Bakharz. They may be put down at 3,000 families in all. In Herat the tribe is much scattered; some are to be found in the-.frontier villages, others in the town, and a few nomadising in the Bakharz tract. They are said to number 4,000 families. In regard to the general attitude and feeling of the Herat people. Captain Napier, in a report, written in 1875, makes the following remarks :— “ The changes that a period of comparative tranquillity has effected in the condition and in clinations of the Heratees have, as might be ex pected, diminished the influence that Persia has always more or less persistently and successfully maintained in the province. Even the Shiahs, I am assured, who form a consderable proportion of the population, have no desire for a change of rule that might bring with it a disturbance of present conditions. The Heratees, whether Shiahs or Sunnis, have no love for the Afghans, but they also have none for the Persians, and they have good reason to fear the effects of Persian attempts at encroachment. There is room for doubt that the Kajars would, under any circumstances, have the suffrages of the j&gt;eople, and at present it appears certain that their pretensions would meet with little sympathy even within the walls of the town which they look upon as the stronghold of their influence. “ The Eimak tribes arc, so far as I could learn, thoroughly opposed to Persian intrusion, and would no doubt end in resisting it. The sections of the tribes living in Persia, and for the most part Sunnis at heart if not by profession, appear to be dis contented, and only awaiting a fair opportunity to return to their former seats ; their influence would, no doubt, in the event of hostilities with Afghan istan, be prejudicial to Persia. “ The peasantry of the Herat and of the Subzwar border, the Hazara, the Taimuri, and Taimuni villages, the people of Ghorian and Kohsin, and the nomadic Alizai and Nurzai, have presumably no very strong feeling of dislike to, or affection for, any particular dynasty, but they know that Persian aggression means pillage and devastation, and they have the usual border antipathies. A summons to arms for a march into Persia would be responded to with alacrity,—the more so that the Afghan borderers have acquired a moral superiority over those of Persia that is very marked. In their border forays and fights they will defend themselves against superior numbers, and attack where the Persians would not dare to do so; and their raids27 are made openly, while those of the Persians, usually in retaliation, are made by stealth. This difference is not the result of difference of race, for the border communities on both sides are composed usually of the same elements, nor of superior armament or numbers on the Afghan side; but apparently to difference of orgamzation and govern ment. The Afghans have some advantage in shorter lines, and are united and fairly organized, while the Persian posts are scattered, the local Chiefs are deprived of authority, and the officers employed on the border are commonly strangers and mercenaries. “ The chances of successful aggression by Persia may therefore be reckoned to depend in the first instance certainly on her own resources; for she could not count on any sympathy in the enemies* ranks. “ Of the influence of the only two European powers of which the Heratees know anything I was able to gain some general ideas. “ The political agitation consequent on the recent movements of Russia and England of course spreads thither, and Herat is regarded as an objective point of all attempts at extension of influence by moral or physical forces, secondary only to Merv. &lt;c The people and Chiefs have had direct contact with both England and Russia through the Herat Mission in 1837-38 and through Khanikoff’s Mission in 1858. The Russian party wintered at Herat, travelling further under Persian auspices. Its chief, M. Khanikoff, cannot have failed to add to the vivid impressions of Russian power that prevail in Khorassan and Herat, and his presence was at least a proof to the people of the extensive influence and the wide scope of the designs of the Russian Government. “ Regarding the political effects of the residence of the English Mission in Herat, judging from what I have observed and heard, it is, I think, scarcely too much to say that it has left the country fairly open to any efforts that it may be desirable to make towards a fresh extension of influence or to actual occupation,—and this in spite of subse quent events. The triumph of Yar Mahomed Khan, the retirement of the Mission, and consequent injury to those who had shown themselves in any way friendly to British interests, has of course left a perceptible and indelible impression, the adverse force of which has been much increased by subse quent events in Afghanistan, and by a long period of unaccountable (to Orientals) inaction, during which our prestige diminished and the power of Russia became a tangible fact to the people. But our influence is a reality, and we should, I believe, find the people and their Chiefs in the main ready to receive us, on the faith of past good will and of benefits conferred.'’ Such is Herat. It can hardly be a matter of surprise that the possession of this city and districtby Afghans has acted as a never healing sore on the Persian mind. As said before, no sooner had the present Shah ascended the throne than his Govern ment devoted all their energy to the extension of Persian influence over Herat. A favourable oppor tunity for interference in the affairs of that city soon occurred from the fact of the son of Yar Ma homed proffering, in 1851, his allegiance to the Shah. A considerable Persian force was organized at Teheran and sent towards Khorassan, with the object of according to this offer a very practical reply. Sir Henry TLawlinson, then British Envoy at Teheran, judging the position to be an embar rassing one, wrote upon it as follows. He said : * “ As I think it likely that your Lordship’s atten tion may be drawn to the present somewhat em barrassing state of affairs at Herat, I take the liberty of recording a few brief observations on the subject, the result of my long experience in the politics of Persia and of the Afghan Principalities. “ I shall not enter on the question of the abstract value of Herat. It is sufficient for my purpose to remind your Lordship that we sacrificed an army and spent above 15,000,000^. sterling in order to prevent this city from falling into the hands of Persia, and thus serving as a possible outwork for Russian demonstration against India. The cata strophe which we took so much pains to avert in 1838 is now brought, by an almost natural course of events, to the eve of accomplishment, and the consideration which arises to every one who takes an interest in Eastern politics is, in such an emer gency, how are we to act ? “ There is no question at present of Russian hostility or intrigue. There is no imminent danger. The changes now in operation in the countries inter mediate between India and Persia have been brought about by that tide of events which is independent of human control. The existence of Herat as a distinct principality was maintained by the energy and ability of a single individual, Yar Mahomed Khan. Under the rule of his son, the continuance of such independence seems to me almost impos sible. Syud Mahomed Khan is thoroughly inca pable ; he has no ambition to imitate his father; the clan feeling of jealousy which is strong among all Afghans (and particularly between the Ale- kozyes and Barukzyes) arouses him to resist aggres- sioii from Candahar, but he would sink without reluctance into the obscure condition of a vassal of the Persian Crown. As far as my knowledge extends, there is no other member of his family, nor any member even of the family of Shah Kamran, which his father supplanted, from whom a nobler course of action could be looked for. “ The Heratees, as a body, undoubtedly dislike the Persians, but they would prefer the rule of the Shah to that of the Chief of Candahar, and for this simple reason, that under the Baruckzyes they would be shorn of all their tribal honours, all theirprivileges, all their wealth; they would become, in fact, real slaves, whereas under the Persian dominion their subjection would be but nominal. “ But if Herat cannot exist alone, and if she prefer the rule of the Shah to that of the Chief of Can- dahar, is it worth our while to interfere in her behalf? There is little doubt but that the re-occu pation of the island of Karrack, or a threat of with drawing our Mission from the Court of Teheran, would compel Persia to an absolute abnegation of her pretensions on Herat,—hut this would merely be to bring back the Candahar forces upon the city, and thus to swell the power of a Chief who, it must be remembered, actually signed a treaty with Russia most inimical to our interests, in 1838; who, driven from his country by our arms, has always since regarded us with the bitterest hostility, and who, if Russia should ever wish to resume her intrigues upon the North-West frontier of India, would thus be a far readier and more dangerous instrument in her hands than would be the boy King at Teheran. There is, it is true, another course that might be followed. At the same time that Persia were warned off from interference with Herat, Kohandil Khan might be threatened with invasion from Sind, if he persisted in aggression to the westward; and a British Agent might be sent from the Governor General through Persia to reside at Herat, with authority to support Syud Mohamed Khan in the exercise of independent rule; but so great is the jealousy of our presence now generally prevalent among the Afghans, that I doubt if this compulsory independence under a British protectorate would be agreeable to the Heratees themselves; and I further see that we might be led by a renewed political interference into ulterior military measures that would throw us back into our former false position among the Afghan mountains. “ Another consideration which, I think, especially distinguishes the situation of 1838 from that of 1852, is that at the former period we had elements of real danger at our very threshold, in the formid able power of the Seikhs and in the intriguing Court of the Ameers of Sinde; whereas at present an impression can hardly be made upon our North- West frontier, except by actual invasion. Had Persia taken Herat in 1838, our Indian Empire would really, I think, have trembled in the balance. If Syud Mahomed Khan acknowledge himself a vassal of the Persian Crown in 1852, and even admit a Persian garrison into Herat, the effect on India will be absolutely imperceptible. “ It is only in fact in reference to future con tingencies, that any active interference at present can, I presume, be advocated. It may be argued that the lapse of Herat to the Persian Crown will be severely felt, when Russian influence, and perhaps Russian arms, are paramount in Khorassan and in the Caspian Provinces, but that day, it may be hoped, will be a remote one; and an immunity from such a danger would, I think, be dearly pur-30 chased by accepting any present responsibilities; at any rate, I take the liberty of pointing out to your Lordship that the Shah of Persia must be always a more tractable enemy than the Chief of Candabar. If we wished to obviate evils arising from the junction of Herat and Candahar, we should be engaged in another Afghan war. If Persia, on the other hand, abused her occupation of Herat, we have always a simple and inexpensive remedy at hand. The forfeiture of the Shah’s promise to abstain from sending troops to Herat would warrant at any moment our re-occupation of the island of Karrack ; and the appearance of a single Bombay regiment at that point would suffice, as it did in 1838, to dissipate all danger to the eastward.” Writing on the same subject more recently,* Sir Henry Raw!in son again restates the opinion thus officially expressed, in the following words :— “ My own opinion, which I put on record at the time, and w r hich I still believe to have been sound, was to the following effect,—that, as there was now no question of Russian instigation or intrigue, nor of hostility to British India, it could not pos sibly be to our interest to irritate Persia by opposing Said Mahomed’s overtures, and insisting on the continued independence of Herat in spite of itself. The ground, indeed, which I took up was even broader, and involved a question of principle that is hardly yet obsolete, for I argued that, looking to the future of Herat, and the alternative of its being either in friendly or unfriendly hands, it would be better for us under both contingencies to have to deal with a Persian than with an Afghan power. The friendship of united Persia, I sug gested, would more avail us in resisting the advance of Russia than the divided councils of Cabul, Can dahar, and Herat, while, on the other hand, if coercive measures were ever requisite to prevent Herat from becoming dangerous to India, it would be a less arduous undertaking to send an expedition to the Persian Gulf, as in 1838, than to march another army above the passes. Had we remained passive at the period in question, there can be no doubt but that the fertile valley of the Heri-rud, with its formidable fortress, would have been re annexed to Khorassan without a struggle; for Herat itself was already Persianized to a great extent, and neither Cabul nor Candahar, estranged by half a century of independent rule, would have moved a man to support the family of Yar Mahomed Khan; and regarding the question by the light of subsequent events, and without impugning our present policy, to which we are now irrevocably committed, I am not at all sure that this would* not have been the proper solution of the Herat difficulty of 1852. But the respon sible officers decided Otherwise. Conformably to Poreign Office tradition, as shaped by the Afghan war, the integrity of Herat was to be maintained at all hazards, and a Convention was accordingly # England and Raasia in the East.imposed upon the Shah in 1853, by which Persia undertook not to send troops to Herat unless the city was menaced from the east, nor, indeed, to interfere in the internal affairs of the place in any manner whatever, the views of the British Govern ment, as succinctly stated by Colonel Shiel to Said Mahomed Khan, being f a determination that Herat 4 should remain in Afghan hands and in indepen- ‘ dence ’ “ Although the Sadr Azem, who was now in office, submitted to this restriction without any serious resistance, there can be no doubt but that it was most unpalatable to the Shah, and that it pre disposed him to be influenced generally by counsels hostile to England.” Notwithstanding this opinion from one of its most prominent advisers, the Government of that day felt itself committed in principle to the main tenance of the integrity of Herat, and forced the Shah, amidst indications of considerable irritation * Agreement, dated 25th January 1853. at his Court, to sign an agreement* pledging the Aitchison’s Treaties,” Vol. VI., p. 408. Persian Government neither to send troops to that place (unless the city happened to be menaced from the eastwards) nor to interfere ordinarily in its affairs. The stipulation of 1853 was seriously imperilled two years afterwards by the action of Host Mahomed, who had acquired supreme power in Afghanistan. In 1855 that Chief subdued Candahar (which had up to that time enjoyed practical independence), and contemplated further operations against Herat. His overtures to the British Government for assist ance in men and money to effect this purpose drew t Court of Directors, to Lord Canning, forth the following opinionf from the Court of 22nd March 1856. . Directors i x “ 5 . With respect to Herat, the avowed policy of the British Government is that that State shall be independent. We do not observe any ground for supposing that the last revolution in Herat was produced by Persian intrigue, and therefore, so far as Persia is concerned, we should expect that Prince Yusuf would be as good a Chief for our interest as his predecessor was. But if he be pressed by the hostility of Host Mahomed, the consequence may be that he will apply to the Shah for assistartee ; and we have no right, either in equity or under agreement, to object to the Shah’s giving such assistance, provided he retire after it has produced its effect. Moreover, as we bind Persia to respect the independence of Herat, so we are bound by Persia, if desired by her, to interpose our good offices in order to preserve the independence of Herat from attack on the side of Cabul. « 6 . In these circumstances, it is impossible for your Government, if Host Mahomed communicate with you upon the subject, to do otherwise than discourage any hostile attempt upon Herat. . . . ' 8 . If the Persians should take advantage of Prince Yusuf’s dethronement of Said Mahomed,32 and his fear of the Ameer Dost Mahomed, to establish themselves at Herat as his protectors, it will immediately become the duty of the Govern ment in this country to decide and direct what measures shall be taken for the maintenance of the independence of Herat, as an important element in the defence of British India against the possible machinations of Russia.” The aggressive tendencies of Dost Mahomed succeeded in rousing Persia in 1856 to a reassertion of her old claims on Herat. The opportunity of this was a favourable one, inasmuch’ as the British Government was occupied with the Crimean War, and Mr. Murray, British Minister at Teheran, after repeated insults, which it is not necessary to enlarge upon in this Note, had hauled down his flag and left the capital. So anxious was the Shah to possess Herat, that he braved all consequences and sent a force openly against the city. It fell to the Persian forces in October 1856. * So seriously was this step viewed the British Government that the Governor General of India was authorized to declare war against Persia.* This step was followed by the despatch of an expedition under Sir James Out ram into the Persian Gulf. The operations were suc cessful ; the British troops occupied the island of Karrack, defeated the Persian army at Khushab (8th Pebruary 1857), and captured Mohammera (26th March 1857). In the meantime, however, a treaty had been concluded at Paris,f under which the British forces were to withdraw from Persia, and the Shah was compelled to relinquish once more all claim to suzerainty in Herat and the countries of Afghanistan, and to abstain from all interference in their internal affairs. Before leaving Herat, on the 27th July 1857, the Persians installed as rnler Sultan Ahmed Khan, a refugee nephew of the Ameer Dost Mahomed. The question then arose as to the course which Her Majesty’s Government should pursue in regard to him. Her Majesty’s Minister at Teheran proposed to recognize Sulta'n Ahmed as the de facto ruler, and to^apprize him fully of the Persian engage ment with regard to the independence of Herat; but Mr. Murray was alarmed lest Sultan Ahmed, while nominally acknowledged to be independent, should be bribed by the Persian Government into some degree of subserviency to that State. The President of the Board of Control J did not see in that circumstance any cause for alarm. The Secretary of the Board, in answer to a reference from the Foreign Office,§ wrote :— “ We uphold the independence of Herat, not because we should dread the strength of Persia, even if Herat were added to her dominions, but because we fear the claim which a mightier Power might put forth as to the location of agents, if Herat were considered as part of the Persian terri tory, and because we believe that the machinations * let November 1856. t Treaty of Paris, Ath March 1857. “ Article 6. “ His Majesty the Shah of Persia agrees to relinquish all claims to sovereignty over the territory and city of Herat and the countries of Afghanistan, and never to demand from the 'Chiefs of Herat, or of the countries of Afghanistan, any marks of obedience, such as the coinage, or ‘ khootbeh/ or tribute. “His Majesty further engages to abstain hereafter from all interference with the internal affairs of Afghanistan. His Majesty promises to recognize the independence of Herat and of the whole of Afghanistan, and never to attempt to interfere with the inde pendence of those States. “ In case of differences arising between the Government of Persia and the countries of Herat and Afghanistan, the Persian Govern ment engages to refer them for adjustment to the friendly offices of the British Govern ment, and not to take up arms unless those friendly offices fail of effect. “ The British Government, on their part, engage at all times to exert their influence with the States of Afghanistan to prevent any cause of umbrage being given by them, or by any of them, to the Persian Govern ment ; and the British Government, when appealed to by the Persian Government, in the event of difficulties arising, will use their best endeavours to compose such differences in a manner just and honourable to Persia. “ Article 7. “In case of any violation of the Persian frontier by any of the States referred to above, the Persian Government shall have the right, if due satisfaction is not given, to undertake military operations for the re pression and punishment of the aggressors ; but it is distinctly understood and agreed to that any military force of the Shah which may cross the frontier for the above-men tioned purpose shall retire within its own territory as soon as its object is accomplished, and that the exercise of the above-mentioned right is not to be made a pretext for the permanent occupation by Persia, or for the annexation to the Persian dominions, of any town or portion of the said States.” J Mr. Vernon Smith. § 15th October 1857.

Those claims, however, cannot he advanced as long as the Shah acknowledges in words the indepen dence of Herat.” Note .—For further details, see Mr. Moore’s able Note on Afghanistan, 31st August 1878, from which much of the information here recorded on this stage of Herat policy is taken. * Mr. Murray to Lord Malmesbury, 11th September 1858. Persian Correspondence, Vol. 80, p. 655. This view seems to have been substantially accepted by the Foreign Office. Mr. Murray, the British Minister in Persia, would gladly have seen Sultan Ahmed ejected from Herat, and succeeded by a ruler,* “ prepared to “ repudiate all connection with Persia or Russia, “ and look to the British or Indian Governments as “ the protectors ” of Herat independence, and the guided of its future policy. Using Mons. Khani- koff’s mission as a text, Mr. Murray urged upon Her Majesty’s Government the serious considera tion of the question of future British policy in Herat and Afghanistan. He wrote :— “ Were Russia idle and inactive in this matter, and were she to instruct or permit her subservient neighbour here to be so likewise, we might perhaps witli safety continue the ‘ do nothing ’ policy which we have of late years observed in respect to the ‘ Gate of India.’ But your Lordship is aware that she has not been, and is not, so inactive, but that, on the contrary, she has been steadily advancing foot by foot, and station by station, her forts, her surveys, her roads, her walls, and other preliminaries necessary for the march and the maintenance {sic) to the south-east of the Caspian; and when your Lordship reflects on these preparations as connected with the present visit of one of her ablest diploma tists to Herat and Afghanistan, I think that you will agree that the subject is worthy of the serious ^attention of Her Majesty’s Government, and that it is neither prudent nor safe to dismiss with a scoff or a sneer the idea of danger to our north-west Indian frontier from the movements of Russia in Afghanistan, as being impracticable and visionary. .... Of one thing your Lordship may rest as sured, that whatever may be the difficulties and facilities for the march of a Russian force on our north-west frontier, via Herat, they are far better appreciated in their minutest detail, far better known, at St. Petersburg than they are either in London or Calcutta.” Persian affairs were at this time (January 1859} under the control of the lately appointed Secretary of State for India (Lord Stanley, now Earl of Derby), and the correspondence was submitted to a Secret Committee, composed of Sir G. Clerk, Sir E. Currie, and Sir II. Rawlinson, with Mr. (afterwards Sir) J. Kaye, as Secretary. That Com- t Secret Homo Correspondence, Vol. 53, mittee, on the 12th January 1859, f having consi- dered certain extracts “ relating to the continuance of Russo-Persian influence at Herat,” recommended that a British Agent should be appointed to reside at that place. Accordingly, on the 3rd February 1859, Lord - Stanley addressed a Despatch to the Governor General, in which, after premising that “ the object“ of all our diplomacy, during nearly a quarter of a “ century, in Persia and Central Asia, and of the &lt;&lt; expeditionary wars undertaken against the de “facto rulers of Cahul and Candahar in 1838, and “ against the Shah of Persia in 1856,” had yet to he attained, and that “ Russo-Persian influence must “ not he suffered to be dominant at Herat,” his Lordship announced the decision of the British Government to establish a British Agent at Herat, vvho should he in subordination to and receive instructions from, the Minister at Teheran. The Governor General was instructed to select a com petent officer for the post, who should he accom panied by two Assistants (of whom one might probably remain at Candahar) and a Medical Officer. The policy to be observed by the Agent at Herat was to he that explained by Lord Clarendon to Mr. Murray after the Persian war, when Major North was deputed to the city. Lord Clarendon at that time wrote :—* * Despatch, 2! “ You will point out to Major North that, while Corres Po»dence, ascertaining that the Persian Government acts in good faith in its renunciation of interference, it will be no part of his duty to advocate, or to set up, the claims of any Afghan party to the sovereignty in Herat. That question must be left for the people of Herat to determine. Her Majesty’s Government have no other wish but that Herat and Afghanistan should be wholly independent of foreign influence, and that the Afghans should administer for them selves their own affairs without interfering with, or being interfered with, by any neighbouring tribes or States.” A In a further Despatch, dated the 10th February 1859, Lord Stanley left to the Governor General the time of departure, the route, and the ostensible object of the mission, with the remark that it was the desire of Her Majesty’s Government that His Excellency should consider the best means of associating the interest of the Ameer Dost Mahomed with those of the British, and of securinghis cordial support and co-operation in the prosecution of the measures which policy might prescribe. Before the Government of India had acted on these instructions a change of Government in England brought about a change of policy. Lord Stanley was succeeded as Secretary of State for India by Sir C. Wood (Lord Halifax), with Mr. Baring (now Earl of Northbrook) as Under Secre tary, and on the 26th August 1859, a Despatch (Secret, No. 8) in the following terms was addressed to the Government of India:— “ On the 3rd and 10th of February last, de spatches were addressed to your Excellency from this Department of Her Majesty’s Government respecting ‘ the expediency of appointing a British ‘ Agent to reside at Herat, and to watch the pro- * gress of events on the Perso-Afghan frontier and &lt; in other parts of Central Asia.’In the second of these letters, your Excellency was requested to await a fitting opportunity for the despatch of the contemplated mission to Herat. It is probable that you may not have found such an opportunity before this letter reaches you. Should this be the case, Her Majesty’s Government desire that you will suspend any proceedings in connec tion with the proposed mission. If the mission should have started, but not yet crossed the frontier, you should countermand it, and, if it has proceeded so far that it cannot be recalled, you will take the first opportunity to send instructions corresponding with the policy indicated in those furnished to Sir H. Hawlinson, a copy of wdiich is herewith for warded for your information.” The instructions referred to, so far as they relate to the present subject,* ran as follows :— “ I need not inform you that there are circum stances which, at the present time, mnfeg the office which lias been entrusted to you, one of peculiar responsibility and importance, or that many circum stances may render your position at the Court of Persia one of no ordinary difficulty and delicacy. But it was with especial reference to such contin gencies, and the means of surmounting them, that the Queen has selected an officer of your knowledge and experience to proceed to the Court of Teheran; and Her Majesty’s Government have the fullest confidence that your long and familiar acquaintance with the country to which you are about to proceed, and with the language and the customs and the feelings of the people, will materially assist you in overcoming the obstacles which may be in your way. “ It will be your duty to do all that lies in your power to strengthen the confidence of the Shah in Her Majesty’s friendly feelings towards him. You will assure His Majesty that the British Govern ment is sincerely desirous to promote the inde pendence and the prosperity of his empire; and you may counsel him that those objects are to be attained by consolidating and improving his present dominions, rather than by seeking to extend them. “ Upon this point, however, the views of Persia, especially as regards the possession of Herat, have been, unfortunately, so opposed to those of England that they have furnished a constant source of difficulty between the two Governments. “ The independence of Herat has long occupied the serious attention of Her Majesty’s Government. It has been the object both of frequent negotia tions and of frequent hostilities. The recent war with Persia was undertaken for the purpose of checking the encroachments of the Shah in this quarter. “ Hecents events, however, seem to render it doubtful, not only how far our policy in this respect has succeeded, but how far it is susceptible of being carried out successfully. It is true that, under the operation of the Treaty of Paris, Herat36 has been relieved from the presence of a Persian garrison, but the Governor, Sultan Ahmed Khan, still observes all the forms of dependence on the Shah, and as far as outward ceremonial is concerned differs in no respect from the Governors ot the provinces of the Persian empire. . « It i s of still more importance that he is under stood to be personally unfriendly to the British Government, and to have received with cordiality the advances which the Russian Government lias lately been making to him by sending a number of Russian officers to Herat ostensibly for scientific purposes, and, if credit is to be attached to the reports from thence, by a system of such lavish expenditure as almost to amount to subsidizing the whole province. , ,, . - r « There is no reason to suppose that this feeling on the part of Sultan Ahmed Khan may have arisen in some measure from an injudicious management of our relations with him, which has caused our motives and our policy to be misconstrued. or Maiesty’s Government are anxious that an enort should* be made to efface this unfavourable im pression, and to restore our relations with Herat to their natural condition of friendliness and mutual re spect The Governor General of India was authorized some months back to send a mission from India for this purpose. If this has been done, I entertain no doubt but that the Governor General will have communicated to the Mission at Teheran his views, and the general tenor of his instructions to the Mission, and if it shall have proceeded to Herat it will be your duty to afford it such cordial co-opera- tion from the Persian side as may best conduce to its successful issue. It is, however probable that the Mission will not have left Calcutta before a communication announcing the modified views of Her Maiestv’s Government in reference to Herat will have reached the Governor General, and m that case the idea of a separate Mission from India to Herat would be finally abandoned. In this event any communication to the ruler of Herat would be made most advantageously by some officer selected bv you, and sent under your authority. Her Maiesty’s Government would accordingly instruct you to avail yourself of any opportunity which may occur after reaching your post to send an o(ll ^ r111 whom you have confidence to visit, but not to le- main at Herat. He might, perhaps proceed on some complimentary mission; for instance, as the bearer of a letter announcing your ^ arrival at Teheran. He should be directed to state in the most explicit manner that the British Government has no other views as to Herat or its neighbourhood than to see the Chief of that province m a position of strength and independence, cultivating fnen y relations with all his neighbours, and devoting um- self to the extension of commerce, the improvement of agriculture, and the general well-being of his e, ‘ The officer employed on this mission would37 Id make it hii business to ascertain the real effect which has been produced by the visit of Russian officers to Herat, the state of feeling in Herat as regards Persia, and the feeling of the Heratees with respect to the power and views of Dost Muhammad. Khan and the alliance between that Chief and ourselves. “You will be very cautious, however, iu your proceedings as to Herat, so as not to give rise to any of those irritating discussions on this subject with the Court of Teheran which have led so much to the want of good understanding which has pre vailed between Persia and this country. “ With regard to Afghanistan generally, our only wish is to see it independent of foreign influence, whether the country be divided among several Chiefs, or united under one ruler; but it does not appear to Her Majesty’s Government that the accomplishment of this object would be promoted by any arrangement to be undertaken at present. It is so uncertain what events may arise in that country within a very few years, and so certain that, whatever those events may be, each man of influence will act according to the view he may take of his own interest at the moment of action, without reference to previous engagements, that it seems to be the most prudent course to keep our selves free from the trammels of treaty engagements so as to be at perfect liberty to take, on any emer gency, that course which may then seem best, while, in the meantime, we avoid exciting jealousy or ill- will by scrupulously refraining from any measure which may be construed into a desire to interfere with the internal arrangements of the country. “As soon as you have acquired sufficient general information in regard to the position of Herat and Afghanistan, of the feelings and temper of the Persian Court, which your knowledge of the country and your own personal observations will enable you to attain, Her Majesty’s Government will be glad to receive from you a full report on the operation and probable results of the Treaty of Paris, together with any suggestions which may occur to you for the purpose of placing the security of our Indian frontier from hostile action from the westward upon a more satisfactory footing. “ Prom the general tenor of these instructions, you will gather that it is the earnest desire of Her Majesty’s Government to maintain, on the most amicable footing, British relations with the Court of the Shah. But they are not unmindful that, in the present temper of the Persian Court, this object is with difficulty to be obtained, without either such concessions on the one hand, or menaces on the other, as Her Majesty’s Government are not pre pared to sanction. The first of these can only aggravate our difficulties, by heightening the pre sumption of the Persian Government. The last should never be resorted to, except when we are prepared to support our menaces by an appeal to arms; and it is no light cause that would induce 3338. KHer Majesty’s Government to contemplate that last resort; for it is the peculiarity of our position with respect to Persia that we can hardly engage in war with that State without injury to ourselves, not only in the enormous expenditure, but by weaken ing that Power, which it is a great object of our policy in the East to maintain in an independent position. “ On the whole, Her Majesty’s Government con ceive that they must rely mainly on your adherence to a steady and consistent course of policy, at once dignified and forbearing, calculated at the same time to moderate the pretensions of the Persian Couid, and to conciliate its confidence. “ I have the satisfaction to add, that Her Ma jesty’s Government recognize in your own personal character and qualifications the best guarantee for the attainment of these results.” Shortly after his arrival at his post, Sir H. Raw- linson addressed to the Home Government an im portant despatch on Herat affairs. (No. 1, dated 2nd January I860),* in which he discussed the course to be adopted in the contingency, which seemed probable, of Sultan Ahmed Khan, of Herat, coming to Teheran and openly assuming the posi tion of a vassal of the Shah. After explaining the situation in detail, Sir Henry went on : — “ I entirely agree then with Sir John Lgtwrence and Colonel Edwardes that the preservation of the independence of Herat in its present footing, and under the unassisted operation of the Treaty of Paris, is a pure chimera. Herat never has been for a single day independent since the signing of the Treaty of Paris .... I venture then re spectfully to submit that we can only adopt one of three courses for our future Perso-Afghan policy, either in honour or in prudence. “ First. We may allow events to take their own course, preserving a strict neutrality in the pending Afghan complications, and remaining intrenched in our own treaty rights. In that case Herat will be annexed to Cabul almost certainly before the summer “ Second. We may adhere closely and honestly to the Treaty of Paris, and insist on the continued independence of Herat under its present ruler, but to accomplish this we must hold Dost Mahomed Khan in check as well as the Shah “ Third. We may demand the immediate abroga tion of the 6th and 7th Articles of the Treaty of Paris, on the ground that these Articles were designed in the interest of the Afghans to provide for the independence of Herat, and have signally failed in their effect owing to the spontaneous de pendence of Sultan Ahmed Khan upon Persia. It would merely be necessary in this case to hold Dost Mahomed Khan in check until the release was fairly carried out, so that there could be no imputation of perfidy or mala fides in our pro ceedings. I cannot pretend to say what would bethe ultimate result of this new political arrange ment. Persia could hardly fail to be pleased with it, and would, beyond doubt, as a matter of national honour, make an effort, and in all probability a successful effort in the first instance, to reoccupy Herat; but I doubt exceedingly if she could per manently retain possession of the place, or incor porate it in her dominions, owing to the distance at which it is situated from her resources, the dis ordered state of Khorassan, the risk of interruption to the communications with the capital from incur sions of the Turkomans, the hostility of the moun tain tribes, the intense jealousy of the Persians entertained by the Afghans generally, and, above all, the formidable proximity of the strong and organized Government of Host Mahomed Khan. . . . . The result of most importance which I foresee from thus restoring a certain liberty of action to Persia would be that we should be com pelled to take a greater interest in her than we have displayed of late years. With the key of India in her possession, or liable to come into her possession, we could not, of course, suffer Persia, through neglect, to become the vassal of Russia. We should be obliged to take active measures, which are strictly within our competence, to pre serve her integrity and to bind her in friendly alli ance with ourselves, and those measures would, no doubt, entail on us a certain amount both of ex pense and responsibility. “ I do not think it my duty at present to pursue these various plans in all their details. I merely wish to point out their general bearings for the con sideration of Her Majesty’s Government, and thus to pave the way for some definite action as soon as it shall have become - apparent that the present political status can no longer be maintained.” This Despatch does not appear to have elicited any specific reply from Her Majesty’s Govern ment, but the inclination of the then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Lord John Russell) seems to have been to leave the matters discussed in it “ to take their own course.”* At length in 18G1, disputes arose between Sultan Ahmed Khan, of Herat, and the Dost, which resulted in hostilities, and the march of the Ameer upon Herat, before which city he encamped on the July 1862. These proceedings gave rise to vigorous remon strance on the part of the Shah of Persia, who claimed the intervention of Her Majesty’s Govern ment under Article VI. of the Treaty of Paris. The authorities in England do not seem to have at first been very clear as to whether that treaty was, or was not, applicable to the case. In a Despatch, dated the 26th September 1861, Sir C. Wood, after adverting to the terms of the treaty, directed the Governor General, whenever fitting occasion might arise for the exercise of his friendly offices, to endeavour to dissuade the Ameer and the other Sirdars of Afghanistan from “ under-I 40 “ taking or encouraging any hostile demonstration “ against the territory of the Heratee ruler adding, however, that it was the desire of Her Majesty’s Government to abstain from all inter ference in the affairs of Afghanistan, and that they did not contemplate any step being taken beyond friendly advice if an opportunity should occur when it might be given without the risk of giving offence to the rulers of the country. But, on the 3rd June 1862, more positive in structions were sent, and the Governor General was requested, u with advertence to the terms of the Treaty of Paris,” to take any steps to dissuade « the Cabul Sirdars ” from hostile demonstrations against Herat that might be called tor by the cir- cum stances of the case, and the position of affairs upon receipt of the Despatch. Nevertheless, on the 18th August 1862, the Foreign Office were informed* that Sir C. IVbod saw no reason for believing that Dost Mahomed contemplated any aggressive operations against Persia; that the strife, so far, was between two Afghan principalities, and that neither the British nor the Persian Government was justified in inter fering so long as the war was confined to Afghan, territorv; and again, on the 24th Septemb&lt;* 1862,f that Sir C. Wood did not see, in the apprehensions of the Shah that Herat might fall to the beseiging force of the Ameer, any reason for modifying his opinion as to the inexpediency of interference in the internal affairs of the Afghan States. The view finally taken by the Foreign Office, then presided over by Earl Russell, was in accord ance with the above, and was explained in a De spatch;!; to Mr. Alison, Minister at Teheran, dated the 14th August 1862, which, as the question of P 1 the obligations of the British Government under the Treaty of 1857 has been not unfrequently raised, is worth quoting at length. Lord Russell wrote :— “ I have anxiously examined the Treaty of Paris of 1857, in order to ascertain the precise engage ments of Her Majesty in regard to the affairs of Afghanistan. “ I find those engagements contained in Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty of 1857. “ By the 6th Article, His Majesty the Shah of Persia* relinquishes all claims to sovereignty over Herat, promises to recognize the independence of Herat and of the whole of Afghanistan, and never to attempt any interference with the independence of Afghanistan or in the internal affairs of those States. The Shah promises further, in case of dif ferences arising between the Government of Persia and the countries of Herat and Afghanistan, « to refer them for adjustment to the friendly « offices of the British Government, and not to 4 take up arms unless those friendly offices fail of 4 effect.’ 44 The British Government, on their side, engage at all times to exert their influence with the States • Secret Home Correspondence, Vol. 56* p. 745. f Secret Correspondence, Voi. 56, p. 771. t Secret Home Correspondence, Vol. 56, 401.41 of Afghanistan, to prevent any cause of umbrage being given by them or any of them to the Persian Government, and, in case of being appealed to by the Persian Government upon difficulties arising, the British Government promise to use their best endeavours to compose such difficulties in a manner just and honourable to Persia. “ In the 7th Article it is provided that, in case of a violation of the Persian frontier by any of the States of Afghanistan, the Persian Government shall have the right to cross the frontier to repel the invaders, but the Shah promises, when that object is effected, to retire within his own frontier. “ Let us now apply these mutual obligations of treaty to the events which have recently occurred. “ The ruler of Herat chose to send an expedi tion against Eurrah, his claim to which place was, to say the least, doubtful. He was therefore the first to disturb the status quo of Afghanistan. Host Mahomed, resenting the occupation of Eurrah,. sent troops not only to retake that place, but also, it is said, to advance to Herat. “ There is nothing in these occurrences which is in violation of the Treaty of 1857. The Shah, by that treaty, recognizes the independence of the whole of Afghanistan. “ Whether Herat or Eurrah belong to one Afghan ruler or another is not a matter of which the treaty takes any cognizance. If, indeed, Host Mahomed should proceed to invade the frontier provinces of Persia, the British Government, from regard for the welfare of Persia and the main tenance of peace, will send a trustworthy person to advise the Host to abstain from such aggression. “ But the Shah pretends that the union of the whole of Afghanistan under one ruler will be dan gerous to the independence of Persia. With this general consideration, however, the treaty has nothing to do. If the Shah was apprehensive of such a result, he should have warned the ruler of Herat not to attack Eurrah. The first disturbance came from Herat and not from Candahar. “ Neither is it by any means certain that the temporary union of Afghanistan under one ruler will permanently affect the welfare of Persia. It is not probable that Host Mahomed will leave an undivided territory to his sons; or, if he should do so, that that territory should remain united; or, if it should remain united, that the possessor will find himself sufficiently secure at home to under take foreign aggression. Eor these reasons Her Majesty will confine her interference to the case of aggression by one or more of the Afghan Princes upon Persia. In such a case Her Majesty will give advice to the Afghan Princes to abstain from all aggression upon Persia. But Her Majesty has no intention of going beyond the Treaty of 1857, and will therefore not sanction any interference in Afghanistan by force of arms.” The same idea was expressed more curtly in a 3338. L42 * subsequent Despatch to Mr. Alison, dated 4th De cember 1862, in which it was observed :— “ Her Majesty’s Government can well imagine that the union of Afghanistan under one ruler may be a source of apprehension to Persia, but the case is not contemplated in the Treaty of 1857 between Great Britain and Persia.” In order that the British Government might not appear to countenance the Ameer’s proceedings, the vakeel of the Government of India was, in August 1862. directed to withdraw from the Dost’s camp.* But neither the Lieutenant Governor of the Punjab (Sir K. Montgomery) nor the Governor General (Lord Elgin), so far as British interests were concerned, saw anything “ untoward in the “ extension of the Ameer’s dominions to the Persian “ frontier.” On the 27th May 1863, after a ten months’ siege, Herat was stormed and taken by the Dost. Thirteen days later, on the 9th June 1863, the Ameer died. He was succeeded by his appointed heir, Shere Ali Khan, to the exclusion of the two elder sons, Mahomed Afzul and Mahomed Azim Khan. The events which followed the accession to power of Shere Ali Khan may be summarized in a few words, so far as they relate to Herat or Persia. Shere Ali at once placed his youngest, Yakoob Khan, as Governor over Herat. This was followed by events which showed a great deal of discontent at Herat against Yakoob Khan’s rule, and evidenced the desire of the Shah of Persia to turn that dis content to his own advantage. A Persian Envoyf reached Cabul in July 1864, and was received with marked distinction by Shere Ali. The object of his mission was believed to be the conclusion of a treaty between the two States, the reciprocal esta blishment of representatives at either Court, the recognition of Herat as a Persian dependency, and the co-operation of the ruler with Persia in over awing the Turkomans. But nothing came of the negotiation; the Envoy was finally dismissed by Shere Ali without any definitive communication to the Shah, and Herat remained true to Shere Ali’s cause. Yakoob’s position at Herat was for a long time a weak one, more especially from the intrigues with Persia of Shah{ Newaz Khan, son of the late Buler of Herat, Sultan Ahmed Khan, who had died suddenly after his defeat in 1863 by Dost Mahomed. In June 1867, the Shah went to Meshed, ostensibly to pay his devotions at the shrine of Eman Beza, but really in the hope of interfering with advantage in the affairs of Herat. Yakoob Khan left that city for Meshed to have an audience of the Shah, but nothing resulted from the visit except an interchange of presents. During the period of civil war which raged in Afghanistan in the first part of Shere Ali’s reign, the Shah of Persia lost no opportunity of fomenting the designs he had so much at heart, having •* Secret Letter, No. 1, dated 2nd Septem ber 1862. f Wynne’s Precis of Erents in Afghanistan^ p. 9. f Note .—In 1867, Shah Newaz Khan’s intrigues under Persian protection attained some prominence. He was, at length, how ever, compelled to fly from Herat, when ho retreated to Seistan, and allied himself, by his marriage, with Ahmed Khan, Governor of Lash Jowain. He remained at Teheran on a pension of 1,900 tomans a year till his death, which took place in the autumn of 1879.for their object the extension of his influence eastwards. At length, in 1867, well founded rumours readied the Government of India of a probable alliance between Shere Ali and the Shah, which drew forth the following opinion from Lord Law rence, which it may be interesting, under present circumstances, to quote. It was said,—* “ Should the rumour prove untrue, of course the necessity for any present action will no longer exist. But if it should turn out to be founded on fact, that is, if it should be ascertained that Ameer Shere Ali has made overtures to Persia, and that in consequence terms of mutual aid and concession have been concluded between the two Powers, then in that event we think that it might be highly for the interests of British India to declare the treaty at present existing between us and Ameer Shere Ali at an end, and to openly assist the party in power at Cabul, if at the time being that party should appear to be in a condition likely, with such assistance, to hold its position against Ameer Shere Ali. Our aid would be confined to a moderate subsidy of money, and a supply of arms and ac coutrements. The moral and material help thus rendered would go a great way to give the party at Cabul, in such active alliance with ourselves, a clear and unassailable supremacy. “ Ameer Shere Ali has been already warned what the consequences of an alliance with Persia would be, and could not justly complain if we, under the supposed circumstances, adopted the course above sketched out. “ Although the Afghans are proverbially fickle and venal to the last degree, yet we apprehend that there would be motives rendering such action on our part not displeasing to them. The inhabi tants of Herat are allied more to the Afghan race than to that of Persia. Any predominance of Persian interests would be unpalatable to the Chiefs of Afghanistan. The Persians are disliked in con sequence of both national and religious antipathies. An alliance of the Afghan Chiefs with ourselves (so as it did not rouse suspicion and bigotry by the presence of European officers) would be far from unpopular, especially if it were known to be the only alternative to the Persian proclivities of Ameer Shere Ali. “ In considering the possibilities of the future, it might turn out that Ameer Shere Ali, having entered into negotiations with Persia, should regain the throne of Cabul. In that event, we think that the value he is known to attach to the countenance of the British Government would enable us to detach him from any such engagements. But if otherwise, and it were ascertained that he continued bound to Persia in a manner inconsistent with his relations to us, it would only remain for us to call the attention of Persia to her engagements in re ference to Herat, and to insist upon their faithful observance.”44 From the year 1867 up to the present time the question of Persian claims to Herat has practically remained dormant. The delimitations of the Seistan boundary, the determination of the British Government to discourage any renewal of I ersian encroachment eastwards, and the strong position held, under British auspices, by Shere Ah, crushed any hope on the Persian side of successfully revivi fying the claims of tbe Shah to any part of Afghan territory. The recent course of events in Afghanistan, however, has given the question new life at the Persian Court. In an interview in November 1878 between the Shah and Mr. Thomson,* His Majesty evinced great curiosity on the subject of the existing Afghan complications, and hoped that when England had reduced Afghanistan, she would revert to the old arrangement, which was equally advantageous to Persia and to England, of establishing separate small States at Cabul, Candahar, and Herat. In a conversationf also with the Secretary of State for Eoreign Affairs, Malcom Khan averred that Persia was too weak to remain without a friend, and that the Shah was anxious to place the whole of his foreign policy under the guidance of TWland if Her Majesty’s Government were willing wte h^ a pledge' of their good will. The policy pursued by England was, he said, bringing about the annexation of Merv, a measure which Persia could prevent with the assistance of England ; the most obvious mode of rendering such assistance was by Placing Herat in her hands; there were other means at hand, notably the provision of monev to enable Persia to obtain more effective armaments. In short, said Malcom Khan, this was the critical moment, the point from which t ic policy of Persia must definitely turn towards Russia or England. Whilst Lord Salisbury promised con- ^deration to Malcom Khan’s representations he reminded the Minister that Herat was regarded by Indian authorities as a point of great importance and that they would look with misgiving at the occupation of it by a power which might not be able to throw off the control of Russia. The Persian Eoreign Minister, at the same time earnestlyt brought the same subject to the notice of Mr. Ronald Thomson. England had, he said by the treaty of 1857, obliged Persia to renounce her rights in Afghanistan and to tem- torial claim to Herat ; she had aiways felt exas perated at thus being deprived of Herat by En D land, and her recent want of cordiality was only to be attributed to that feeling; if England wanted to secure Persia in her interests she would do so by 'he cession of Herat; if this were done, Persia would solemnly bind herself to place her foreign relations in the hands of England, and to grant her internal privileges; she would further undei- take not to allow any Russian agent, or traveller, * Mr. Thomson, No. 210, of 14th Novem ber 1878. f Foreign Office to India Office, No. 1£4, 28th February 1879. X Mr. R. Thomson, No. 36, of 17th Feb ruary 1879.2* 45 or foreigner other than English, to reside in, or to visit, Herat. Mr. Ronald Thomson was not personally in favour of any concession to Persia on this score. He wrote,— * Mr. Ronald Thomson to Marquis of ‘‘While a cession of Afghan territory* in the Salisbury, No. 38, of 21st February 1879. direction of Seistan to Persia might not be without its disadvantages, the objections to the cession of Herat were overwhelming, inasmuch as Persia’s occupation of that territory would eventually result in opening a door to Russia.” • In another conversation with Her Majesty’s Charge d’Alfaires at Teheran, the Persian Foreign , t Mr. Ronald Thompson, No. 80, of 25th Minister, f in referring to Herat, said that all Persia March 1879. wanted was a release from the engagement she had contracted with England under the 6th Article of the Treaty of 1857, by which she agreed to relin quish all claim of sovereignty over the territory and city of Herat. Persia could thus, at any moment, with the permission of England, take possession of it, inasmuch as the inhabitants were quite disposed to transfer their allegiance from Cabul. • The changed aspect of affairs in Afghanistan which shortly followed these conversations, ending with the establishment of friendly relations between the British Government and Yakoob Khan, caused X Telegram from Mr. Taylour Thomson, the Shah and his Ministers'^ to renounce, for the 15th May 1879. time being, any hope they may have once enter- W ,25i ce t0 ludu * No * 36 * tained of being allowed to occupy Herat, or other 16t ay * portions of Afghan territory. Mr.Thomson believed, however, that, if he were able to announce to the Shah any prospect of territorial concession, he might possibly arrange that His Majesty should personally undertake to place British influence at Teheran on a more satisfactory footing, to follow our advice in matters connected with the admime of Russia, to ixd*** &lt; - dismiss the Russian officers now in Persian service, and to open the Karim river to general commerce. Persia and Seistan. —Seistan is a district claimed both by Persia and Afghanistan, situated, roughly speaking, between lat. 30° to 32° and long. 60° to 64°. Ancient Seistan was of much greater extent than the modern province. It was the country of Jum- sheed and Rustoom, the heroes of the Persian Nama, as also of Jacob bin Seth, the conqueror of the Caliph of Bagdad, and, although now reduced to an almost deplorable condition, it once rivalled the most flourishing provinces of Persia. The River Helmund, the ancient Etymander, rising in the mountains of Afghanistan, flows through the centre of Seistan into the so-called lake, the ancient Aria Palus. The general aspect of Seistan is that of a dead level plain, with the exception of the Koh-i-Khofa hill, and in its whole extent not a stone is to be met with, except a few rounded pebbles in the beds of the rivers. The soil is either the light and soluble earth of the desert, or a still lighter alluvial deposit, and there is hardly a tree in the whole 3338. M46 country. From the north and north-east it receives the waters of numerous rivers, which, partaking of the nature of mountain torrents, rush dov n at one time of the year with great violence, and at other times are quite dry, or flow in a clear, languid, and shallow stream. The administrative divisions of Seistan are, (1) Lash, (2) Shekh Nasir, (3) Sekoha, (4) Canda- hari, all under different chiefs, and all acknow ledging, up to a recent date, sometimes Candahar, sometimes Herat, sometimes Persia, as it has suited their convenience. In Lash the inhabitants are Durani Afghans ; in Shekh Nasir they are Sarbandi Beluchis; in Sekoha the are Kayanis and Towke Beluchis; and in the Garmsel they,are Beluchis and Afghans mixed.* The chief rivers of Seistan are the Helmund, Farah Bud, Harut Bud, and Khash Rud. The banks of the Helmund are well cultivated, to the extent of half a mile on either side, from Giriskh as far as Mula Khan, but from thence to the Tower of Alexander the banks consist principally of grass land, and are more wooded than cultivated. The lake of Seistan is more a marsh than a lake. Into it one small river, the Bundar, with a course of 50 miles, flq^vs. The climate of Seistan is said to be unfavourable to human life ; the cold weather is pleasant, and snow has on rare occasions been known to fall in the district. The heat is excessive; the hot wind blows with violence, raising whirl winds of impalpable dust, which obscures every thing, and is very injurious to the sight. The soil of Seistan is celebrated for its richness ; a very fair breadth of land is sown with wheat, which is generally exported to Herat, Candahar, and Kir- man. Beyond this the trade of Seistan is nil. Though the communications of the country are not in any way attended to, the whole country is prac ticable for wheeled carriages. It is open on all sides. From the north it can be approached from Herat, by Farah, by a practicable road. From the north-east it can be reached from Candahar by two roads, onebyGirisk to Jehanabad, 250 miles long; one by Hazar Tuft to Sekoha, 308 miles long. Except for 50 miles, these roads are well supplied with water. From Meshed is a road which, avoid ing Herat and Farah, comes by Turbat and Birjan to the Hari Bud. From Semnun in Persia there is also a road to Farah, with water all the way, 430 miles in length. From the north-west there is a road from Nishapur, 400 miles long, with villages all the way. There are also said to be practical routes from Mekran, Quetta, and elsewhere on the south. A careful study of the map, and the detailed in formation contained in General Goldsmid’s* Arbi tration Beport of 1872, will be sufficient to show the extreme importance of any decision affecting Seistan not only to Persia and Afghanistan but to India. A few recent opinions on this subject may not therefore be uninteresting or out of place. * The population is said to amount to about 127,000 souls. The original inhabit ants of the district were Tajaks ; the Sar- bundis emigrated from Irak, in Persia, to Seistan, and in much later times the Beluchis settled in the southern part of the province.47 Colonel Taylor to Lord Canning, 2nd February 1858. Mr. Murray to Lord Malmsbury, April 1858. Colonel Phayre to Bombay Government, 14th January 1869, written on receiving a letter from Ibraham Khan, saying, that the Persians had driven him from left to right bank of the Helmund, had even taken Jehanabad and Nad Ali on the right bank, and were gradually pressing on to Rudbar, &amp;c. ; In 1858 oar Commissioner at Herat, Colonel Taylor wrote,— “ Should Persia be permitted to continue the exercise of her influence in Seistan, she may have it in her power to propagate falsehoods to the pre judice of India, and being so near the frontiers of India they will be freely circulated.” Our Minister at Teheran wrote in the same year,—- “ Seistan, hitherto considered, mapped, and de scribed as an integral part of Afghanistan, occasionally independent, at other times a depen dency of Candahar, is nearer to Candahar than Herat by 200 miles, and is also very considerably nearer the British frontier of Scinde. In fact, if Persia be allowed a permanent footing there, our respective frontiers will be separated from each other by only a distance of 400 miles/’ The Political Superintendent of the Scinde Fron tier, Colonel Phayre, wrote in 1869 that the position acquired by the Persians in Seistan was— “ Well selected, both for defence against the Seistan Beluchees on the opposite bank, and for commanding the several lines of route that radiate from Seistan eastward, viz., that by Shorawuk and the valley of the Lora to the Pisheen Valley and Quetta, and the kafila route to Nooshky. The former of these routes is well watered and supplied; the latter is desert although traversed by caravans, and a route whereby a force can reach Kutchee and turn the Bolan Pass.” “ In a strategical sense,” adds Colonel Phayre, “ and with reference to the well-known ambition of “ Persia towards Afghanistan, her occupation of “ Hosseinabad (Nasirabad) is a flank movement “ of incalculable importance. By it she completely “ turns Herat, Furrah, and Lash Jowain, neutra- “ lizes them in fact without endangering her rear “communications. Politically speakirg, she lays “ the axe at the root of Afghan independence and “ neutrality; because in Seistan she holds a more “ dominating position than the possession of Herat “ or Furrah would have afforded her. “ The present information dispels at once the “ idea so long prevalent that impassable deserts “ interpose an inseparable barrier between Persia and “ Khelat. On the contrary, the facts under report “ show that from a base in Persian Korassan which “ is a highly productive country, a large army can “ advance by water for nearly 200 miles to Kheira- “ bad, whence to Candahar is only 150 miles, or to “ the Bolan Pass 230 miles, both routes being well “ supplied and watered.” The Afghan Vakeel who brought the letter con taining the above information with an appeal for help from the Beluch Chief, Ibraham Khan, ex claimed, “ Sahib the Persians are seizing the gates “ of Candahar.”48 The present Ameer of Afghanistan has spoken constantly in the same sense,— “ Certainly, if Seistan remains in full possession of Persia, it will one day tend to great disturbances in Afghanistan. Troops from Seistan by the Hel- mund can come to Candahar without any hill or other impediment.” Another high Indian authority, acquainted with Seistan, wrote in 1872,— “ The capabilities of the Seistan district are of very great importance in a military sense, and the possession of the district by Persia is not only a direct, menace to the very existence of the Afghan kingdom, but to the security of the western pro vinces of India. The country on this side of the boundary range between Persia and Seistan is a vast level plain extremely fertile and capable of enormous development. It is abundantly watered by the rivers flowing to the Helmund, and possesses every facility for the maintenance and supply of a large army.” Although reference to Seistan has already been made in the first part of this Note, the following extract from a memorandum of 1872 may not be out of place :— At the beginning of the eighteenth century, Seistan, Herat, and Candahar were more or less subject to the Suifaveean dynasty of Persia. Shortly afterwards Candahar and Herat threw off the Persian yoke, and the Afghans under Meer Mahmoud of Candahar overran and conquered Persia. Persia became totally dismembered; she was un able to resist the encroachments of Russia, Turkey, and Afghanistan; and, distracted by internal strife, she was compelled to resign to them some of her best provinces. It was 'not long, however, before a celebrated robber chief, Nadir Shah, sprang up on the ruins of his country. Seizing the crown of Persia, he quickly reacquired the majority of the districts which had been detached from the Persian Empire. He brought into subjection not only Candahar, Herat, Seistan, and Cabul, but even Balkh, Bokhara, and, in a lesser degree, the Punjaub. The Mogul Emperor of Delhi, terrified by his victorious entry into his capital and the slaughter of 1,000,000 of its inhabitants gave his daugher in marriage to one of the conqueror’s sons, assigning as her dowry all the provinces west of the Indus. The Ameer of Bokhara at the same time paid homage to the new Persian ruler. It is important to bear in mind the limits of the Persian Empire under Nadir Shah from 1732 to 1747 ; for Persia’s claims to Seistan, so far as ancient • rights are concerned, are based very much upon that period, whilst Afghanistan argues that on this Cabul Diary, 18th March 1870, and sundry other reports. Colonel Burne’s Memorandum, 19th No vember 1872.49 basis she can no more claim Seistan than CabuU Bokhara, or the Punjab. On the assassination of Nadir Shah at Meshed in 1747, a short period of anarchy ensued, followed by the establishment of the Afghan Empire by Ahmed Shah, an Afghan adventurer in Nadir Shah’s army. Ahmed Shah was crowned at Candahar as the “ chosen of God.” His first act was to wrest Cabul from the Persians^ to conquer Seistau and Herat, to make Khorassan feudatory, and acquire the Punjaub. The limits of his empire from 1747 to 1773 were as follows:— N. The Oxus. S. Sea of Oman. E. Sutlej and Indus rivers. TF. Khorassan and Kerman. After Ahmed Shah’s death in 1773, the Afghan Empire began rapidly to decay. Balkh asserted her independence; Scinde and Beloochistan withdrew from their allegiance; the Sikhs, under the in fluence of Bunjeet Sing, threw off their yoke; and Persia began to assert her claims to Herat and its neighbouring provinces. As regards Seistan itself a long blank ensued in her history, for she had not played any prominent part in the dissensions of the period and became practically independent from being ignored by both Persia and Afghanistan. Although Dost Mahomed on his accession to the Afghan throne in 1826 was most anxious to bring Seistan more directly under his rule, he was toe fully employed elsewhere in re-conquering Balkh and Badakshan, and extending the boundaries cf his kingdom once more to the Oxus, to be able to move against the province. The comparative rest which Persia was at this period enjoying after a recent and disastrous war with Russia, encouraged the Shah to fill his ima gination with the old dreams of extending the Persian Empire to its ancient limits. Much stress was laid on the brief empire of Nadir Shah, and Herat was made for the moment the chief object of intrigue. After repeated failures before Herat, Persia began, in 1851, to turn her attention more to Seistan, and loud were her claims to that province. Intrigue was made the prelude to possession, and Ali Khan, the Chief Ruler in Seistan, was not only induced to go to Teheran, but to marry a Persian Princess and acknowledge allegiance to the Shah. Unfortunately for himself, this allegiance was unpopular with his brother Chiefs and his own people, and on his return shortly afterwards to his capital, he was cruellv murdered. Minister for Foreign Affaire to Teheran Seeing the aggressive spirit by which Persia was Mission, 27th October 1852. actuated, in regard to Seistan, Lord Malmsbury wrote in the following decided language,— “ Her Majesty’s Government most distinctly 333H. Ndeclare that they will not allow any systematic attempt on the part of Persia to effect a change in the state of possession in the countries lying between the Persian frontier and the British territories in India.” Matters at last came to an open rupture between Great Britain and Persia, followed by the war of 1856, the siege of Herat by the Persians, and the Treaty of 1857. Lord Cowley, in his conversations with the Persian Ambassador during the negotia tions, held the same decided language as before, that Her Majesty’s Government were “ determined that Persia should not disturb the existing state &lt;« of the tribes on her eastern frontiers.” The general sense of this language was embodied in Articles V., VI., and VII. of the Treaty of 4th March 1857, and was practically tested shortly, afterwards by an attempt of the Persians to send a small body of troops into Seistan, and the protest of the British Minister at Teheran in the following language, which caused the abandonment of their design,— “ The occupation of Seistan, which is a part of Afghanistan, by Persian troops, would be a direct violation of the Treaty of Paris.” Although the Persian Ministers gave up sending troops to ° Seistan in deference to British remon strances, they did not relinquish in writing their claim to the province, for they said,— “ The Persian Ministers have always considered, and do now consider, that Seistan ab antiqua has formed an integral part of the Persian territory; and it is at the present time in the possession ’of the Persian Government, on whose part, therefore, it is not necessary that troops and soldiers should be sent, or a new occupation of the place effected. * ^'o further question as to Seistan arose until 1862, when Lord Russell informed the Persian Chargd d’Affaires that,— “ As Her Majesty’s Government did not recognize the sovereignty of Persia over Seistan, they cannot admit that'the demand said to have been made by Dost Mahomed for the submission of Seistan con stituted a case in which, under the seventh Article of the Treaty, they can he called upon to acquiesce in any military operations against Afghanistan.” Our Minister at Teheran was however shortly afterwards told that,— “ There was reason to regret, with reference to The asserted claims of Persia to sovereignty over Seistan, that so much had already been advanced in opposition to those claims, and Lord Stanley was of opinion therefore that if the discussion of the subject should be forced upon the mission pending further instructions from England, it would be equally just and politic to adopt a less decided tone than that used by Mr. Murray in his ^ recent con troversy with the Persian Government. Mr. Murray to the Sadr Azim, 5th May 1858. The Sadr Azim to Mr. Murray, 13th May 1858. * Mr. Murray (to Sadr Azim, 15th May 1858) replied that,— “The British Cabinet cannot admit the correctness of this view, which is indeed contradicted not only by the political history of Seistan, but also by its geographical ^ posi tion, which is represented in every existing map possessing any claim to authority as forming part of Afghanistan.” Lord Russell to Mr. Alison, 30th October 1862. Mr. Eastwick to Minister at Teheran, 18th December 1862.Lord Russell to Minister at Teheran, 5th Then followed a Despatch from Lord Russell November 1863. which ran thus,— “ I have the honour to inform your Excellency that Her Majesty’s Government being informed that the title to the sovereignty of Seistan is dis puted between Persia and Afghanistan, must decline to interfere in the matter, and must leave it to both parties to make good their possession by force of arms.” Mr. Alison to] Lord Russell, dated 20th August 1865, enclosing Shah’s Memorandum. Mohsin Khan to Lord Clarendon, 19th March 1870. 4 U Mohsin Khan to Lord Clarendon, 5th April 1870. Despatch of Secretary of State and Mr. Alison’s Telegram to Viceroy, 9th August 1870 and 23rd October 1871. The Persian Government were not long in taking advantage of the permission apparently implied in this Despatch. The Shah not only renewed his claims to Seistan under his own seal but took the opportunity of occupying the province with Persian troops during the most distracted period of anarchy in Afghanistan, when the Ruler of that country was utterly powerless to resist encroachment. One of the first acts of the present Ameer of Afghanistan after the reconstruction of his kingdom in 1868-69 was to protest against this Persian oc cupation of Seistan. 'Although after his visit to TJmballa in 1869, Shere Ali brought Afghan- Turkistan, Candahar, and Herat under a consolidated rule, he refrained from moving on Seistan, partly in the hope that the British Government would arbi trate in the matter, and partly on account of the advice he received from the Viceroy of India not to enter into warlike operations beyond his frontier. The Persian Government, becoming alarmed at the turn matters were taking, began loudly to re assert their counter claims to Seistan. They now argued on entirely new grounds that,— “ After Lord Russell’s Despatch of 1863, Persia had retaken possession of Seistan, that she had not ceased from that moment to consider it as forming part of the interior of Khorassau, and that the Shah was determined to oppose Afghan attempts on that province by forced arms.” And again, “Les arm^s ont decide en notre « favour, et depuis cinq ans le Seistan a fait partie “ de Notre Province de Khorassan ; par consequent “ il ne saurait relever de Particle six de notre Traite “ de Paris.” Such being the position of affairs in 1870-71, Persia and AfFghanistan, after it must be said some delay and prevarication on the part of the former State, consented to British arbitration on the question of possession or division of the pro vince. The arbitration of the British Government in regard to Seistan having been accepted by Persia and Afghanistan, Major-General Sir P. Goldsmid was appointed arbitrator, and left England on the 10th November 1871, accompanied by Colonel Pollock, Major Evan Smith, and other Officers. His instructions were to ascertain the status quo of Seistan ; to meet the Persian and Afghan Com missioners at some pre-arranged point; to acquire all the local information in his power; and after52 bearing the respective claims of the Commissioners bo proceed to Teheran with a view to the discussion of the question and the delivery of an arbitral ^The mission arrived at Bombay on the 3rd De cember 1871, when it was decided that General Groldsmid should proceed to Seistan by Bunder Abbass, whilst Colonel Pollock was to go by Can- dahar in company with the Afghan Commissioner. General Goldsmid reached Bam on the 7th January 1872, at which place he was met by the Persian Commissioner Mirza Maasum Khan. Sekoha was reached on the 1st Pebruary, and Nasirabad on the 5th. This latter place, which appears to be a fortified post, is described as the Perso-Seistan capital. General Goldsmid soon found himself in a posi tion of great difficulty. The Afghan Commissioner had not yet joined him, whilst the Persian Comiius- sioner stifled all local inquiry and assumed a tone which is described as defiant and unfriendly. Ihe whole effort of the Persian Commissioner was to throw discredit on the Mission; for, whilst en- deavourin^ to persuade General Goldsmid that under the terms of Lord Bussell’s letter no inquiry was necessary, he forbad the Mission flying the British flag, prevented its officers Irom entering towns or villages, gave them inferior quarters cut off their supplies when wishing to march to Budbar or other places, used insulting expressions m his correspondence,—in fact, did everything in his power to make all inquiry a failure. . General Goldsmid displayed great^ judgment throughout this disagreeable part of his journey ; he dwells strongly in all his letters on the bad con duct of the Mirza; and he had the poor satisfaction afterwards of seeing him punished by a years suspension from office in consequence of his (General Goldsmid’s) strong representations to the Persian Government. . „ Colonel Pollock joined General Goldsmid with the Afghan Commissioner on the 8th ol March 1872 near Nasirabad. But all attempts to bring the rival Commissioners together in friendly inter- course were failures, and from this and the other circumstances above narrated both General Gold smid and Colonel Pollock were forced to _ agree that “ all hopes of a fair inquiry were vain; that « t h e palpable and shameless attempts to stifle “ plain speech, to reject honest evidence, and to “ bet rid of obnoxious witnesses, had culminated ••into uninistakeable offensive expressions in “ letters ” and made it evident therefore that the « S ooner they moved away from Seistan the The Alission accordingly left Nasirabad on the 11th of' March for Meshed, where they arrived on the 25th of April, and were given a most honourable eception by the Prince Governor, bultan Murad il irza, who is described as a man of considerable abilitv and power.

A delay of more than a month was here caused by the non-receipt of the statement of the Persian claims. General Goldsmid naively describes the little attentions he received during this interval, and the continued efforts of the Persian Ministers to get him to commit himself to an acknowledg ment of their claims before delivering his arbitral opinion. The Persian statement was at length submitted, on the 10th of July 1872, four months after that of the Afghan Commissioner. Both statements may be summarized as fol lows :— Persian Statement. That according to the principles of every civilized State, ancient and newly acquired rights such as Persia holds in Seistan, dispense with the necessity of adducing proof. That Articles 6, 7, and 8 of the Treaty of 1857 prove that Seistan belongs to Persia. That no Afghan has at any time been named Governor of Seistan. That there is no similarity between Afghans and Seistanees. That Lord Russell’s letter of 1863 obviates any discussion as to the present possessions of Persia in Seistan, and excuses the Persian Government from entering into such discussion. That Seistan has, ab antiqud, belonged to Persia; that she now has firm possession of it, and that in addition to Persia’s natural rights, Seistan belongs to her by conquest in accordance with the decision of the British Government, from Tagut in Jowain to Khash Pud above Khash, thence to Kaleh-i-Bist and the desert called Jaya to Jalk, in Beloochistan. Afghan Statement. That it is as clear as daylight that Seistan belongs to Afghanistan. That it belonged to the empire of Ahmed Shah 3338. oand his successors and remained ever since under Herat and Candabar. That Seistanees have often assisted the Afghan Government, as can he seen from their graves in Afghan Turkistan. That there are numerous instances of Afghan Rulers in Seistan, especially under Yar Mahomed of Herat and others. That the newly acquired sovereignty of Persia in Seistan is only attributable to the internal dissen sions of Afghanistan, and in no way founded on right or might. That, as regards Seistanees not speaking the Afghan language, the argument no more holds good than in the case of Badakshanees, Uzbegs, Hazarah tribes, and others subject to Afghanistan. General Goldsmid brought the Commissioners together with varied success on three different occa sions, on the last of which, 19th August 1872, he delivered the following arbitral opinion. As a prelude to4iis arbitral opinion, Sir P. Gold smid gives his views of ancient rights and present possession. As to “ ancient rights,” he says :— “ The Persian claims to Seistan on the score of of ancient rights are not such as to warrant revival after the lapse of 100 years during which they have virtually been in abeyance; and I do not think that the English ministerial letter quoted (Lord Russell’s letter) alters the position in this respect. It left the litigants to settle their quarrel together, but gave no right to Persia which she did not possess irrespectively. Therefore an unjust con quest in an arbitration is a right that cannot be considered just by virtue of this letter. If Seistan were in to way subject to Afghanistan when under the Eegis of Persia, and subsequently garrisoned by Persian troops, then has her independence been assailed, and I cannot say that the acts of Ali Khan or his successor have satisfied me that their alle giance to Persia was the general desire of the inhabitants.” General Goldsmid to Political Secretary, India Office, 21st August 1872. Ditto to Secretary of State, 31st October 1872. Ditto to Foreign Secretary, Calcutta, No. 46, 21st August 1872. General Goldsmid to Secretary of State, 31st October 1872, Enclosure I. As to “ present possession,” General Goldsmid says:— “ It is not easy to define what, in the present « day, is meant by Seistan. I see no better way than to illustrate the case by supposing two “ territories, one compact and concentrated, which €&lt; I will call ‘ Seistan Proper,’ the other detached &lt;* and irregular, which may be designated outer ' Seistan.” Seistan Proper is composed of the country on the left bank of the Helmund, and extends to a distance of about 120 English miles in length, or from the vicinity of the Charboli and “ Khaspar rivers north to Rudbar south, and its breadth variable. Seistan Proper is now, under “ certain reservations to be noted hereafter, in “ possession of Persia, whose Governor is Meer Alum Khan of Kayn.General Goldsmid to Secretary of State, 31st October 1872, Enclosure No. II. 55 u Outer Seistau, on the other hand, irrespective “ of the desert Shila and uninhabited tracts, is in “ possession of Belooch Chiefs who profess to cc acknowledge Persian sovereignty or do not admit “ allegiance to any power but Afghanistan.” General Goldsmid adds,— “ Briefly, being unable to justify the recent action of Persia in Seistan on the score of ancient rights to that province, as regards her present possession of ‘ Seistan Proper ’ the fact is esta blished, although the action of the authorities before described has unquestionably caused me to entertain misgivings on the attitude or sentiments of the population in certain instances.” The arbitral opinion is then summed up under seven heads,— That Seistan was undoubtedly part of Persia in ancient times, but that under Ahmed Shah it formed part of the Afghan Empire and had not been recovered to Persia. II. That ancient associations, language, and habits render its transfer to Persia by no means unnatural or strange, although a century of disconnection cannot fail to be a bar to validity. III. That facts of possession are all in favour of Afghan istan, and that circumstances show that Persia has exercised no interference in the internal adminis tration of Seistan from the days of Nadir Shah till a very recent date. IV. That geographically Seistan clearly forms part of Afghanistan. y. That, whilst Afghanistan has the advantage in claim, it cannot be denied that from year to year she has been relaxing her hold of Seistan; and although the manner of the occupation of the province by Persia cannot be admitted to correspond with the appeal to arms contemplated by Lord BusselTs letter, yet that Afghanistan failed to take any measure to counteract Persian influence in treating with the Seistan Chiefs. VI. That the rich tract of country which the Hamun river, on three of its sides, and the Helmund on the fourth, causes to resemble an island, is “ Seistan Proper,” and in absolute possession of Persia; whilst the district of “ Chaklnmser ” and lands of the Helmund above the Kohat Bund and Seistan Desert are known as “Outer Seistan,” inhabitedGeneral Goldsmid to Secretary of State, 31st October 1872, Enclosure II., and map. chiefly byBelooch Chiefs practically acknowledging Afghan sovereignty. VII. That the land designated “ Seistan Proper ” should be hereafter included by a special boundary^ line within the limits of Persia, to be restored to inde pendence under Persian protection or governed by duly appointed Governors; and that Persia should not possess lands on the right bank of the Hul- mund. . , General Goldsmid adds, that “ having given the “ most coveted, populous, and richer part of the “ Seistan province to Persia, it is manifestly fair « that some compensating benefit should accrue to “ the losing side. It is indispensable, therefore, “ that Nad Ali be evacuated by Persian garrisons, “ and both banks of the Helmund above the Kohat “ Bund be given to Afghanistan.” _ . The new line of boundary, as adjudicated by feir F. Goldsmid, stretches from Koh Siah on the north west in a line south of Lash Jowain, to the Hel mund, the main bed of which river, before Kohat, is to be the eastern boundary of Persian Septan The line then runs in a circular direction to Maleh Siah on the chain of hills between Seistan and Kerman. The Persians are not to cross the llamun river into Lash Jowain, nor are any works on either side to be carried out calculated to intcriere with the requisite supply of water for irrigation on the banks of the Helmund. _ . In delivering his arbitral opinion m the presence Ca ^ ttaj ‘ N ~ 31s t August 1°872. of the Persian and Afghan Commissioners, Genera Goldsmid states that he explained his decision m Persian, besides giving each Commissioner a map. The Persian Commissioner protested lormaliy against it. He said that Persia must have the whole province or none at all. “ Let it be decide , he said, “ to whom Seistan actually belongs, and tt 0 f what it consists, and then let ^ a decision e “ given affecting the whole province.” The Afghan Commissioner said he fl ul ^ e agreed in this view. “It is quite impossible s5 * d » « that a Persian and an Afghan can live m the “ same house together.” He then said m a less decided manner that he could not accept the The two Commissioners then made claims and counterclaims for compensation for raids, borne \ conversation ensued in which the Afghan Commis sioner said that one village in Seistan Proper was worth the whole portion given to Afghanistan. The Persian Commissioner, before leavin 0 , re peated his formal protest, adding ^ at ^ £ served her rights over the whole of Seistan.. General Goldsmid understood that the word pro test” meant an appeal to the Lnglish Foreign Office. . ... • p r n Tlp General Goldsmid to Foreign Secretary, At a subsequent interview with the I 'ersifm i! ime Calcutt No&gt; 46f 31st August 1872. Minister on the 23rd August, Genera Goldsrmd found him “ vraiment tormentt” at the decision General Goldsmid to Foreign Secretary, i -vr- a r- A 1 OTO57 given. He remarked, that it was in accordance with the ancient lamentable policy of England which would not trust Persia, but preferred making a friend of Afghanistan, and he much regretted this new proof of this policy. The Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, who joined them at that moment, remarked that he knew perfectly well the political reasons that had led to the Helmund being adopted as the eastern line of Persia’s boundary. General Goldsmid then entered into friendly explanations and arguments with the two Ministers, which appeared to have weight with them. They said that their greatest difficulty would be to evacuate Nad Ali and Kaleh-i-fath, and to induce the Shah to accept the decision. The drift of their remarks were such, General Goldsmid thought, as to justify a belief that they were really inclined to accept thfi arbitration. This turned out to be the case, and the final decision on the subject, in the terms of General Goldsmid’s arbitral opinion, was given by Earl Granville, as Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, on 28th February 1873. On visiting England in 1873, the Shah endea voured to induce Her Majesty’s Government to modify the decision above alluded to, but without success as will be seen from the following com- * L&lt; * d Granville to the Sadr Azim, Foreign munication* from Lord Granville to the Persian Office, 3rd July 1873. Foreign Minister: - “ From the language held by the Shah in the audience which I had the honour to have with His Majesty, and from my subsequent conversation with your Highness, I have been led to suppose that, although His Majesty is prepared to accept the principle of the award made by General Sir F. Goldsmid in regard to the Seistan boundary, yet His Majesty is anxious that the line of frontier therein laid down should be somewhat modified in that part of it which lies to the south-west of the Kohuk Bund. “ I understood from what passed on those occasions that the objection felt by His Majesty to the proposed line of frontier in that quarter turned not upon any desire on His Majesty’s part to obtain a more extensive territory, but upon the knowledge that the people of the country which, by the adoption of that line, would be annexed to Afghanistan, were lawless in their habits and ad dicted to plundering whenever an opportunity presented itself for doing so, and that the ruler of Afghanistan would be powerless to restrain them, and to prevent them from carrying on marauding expeditions against the neighbouring Persian terri tory ; and that so strongly was His Majesty im pressed with this conviction, and so anxious was he to secure Persian territory from such predatory inroads, that he was even prepared, in return for the concession to Persia of the district in question, which was wholly barren and unproductive, to cede to Afghanistan fertile and productive territory of more than equal value in another quarter. 3338. F58 “ I pointed out to His Majesty and to yourself on tliese occasions that it was impossible at the stage at which the question had arrived to put forward such a proposition as that which had been stated.” Although Persia has lost no convenient oppor tunity since the date of this communication ot dis playing her desire to possess a greater portion ot the so-called Seistan province than that awarded to her, she has in no way attempted to contravene the arbitral decision of the British Government. The views of the Persian Government on the subject have been tersely put in a Memorandum* recently written by Sir H. liawlinson on the subject. He says:— « There were three provisions in the Seistan settle ment of 1872 to which Persia objected at the time, and from the operation of which she has ever since sought to be released. These provisions were, (1) that the southern limit of the Naizar or reedy tract at the mouth of the Helmund should be the frontier of Persia towards Tash-Jowain, although the Naizar itself belonged mainly to villages within the Persian hounds ; (2) that the Persian garrisons should he withdrawn from the right hank of the Helmund, that river forming the Afghan boundary as far as the lake; and (3) that Persian jurisdiction should not extend higher up the left hank of the river than Bend-i-Kohuk, notwithstanding that the Beluch Chiefs dwelling above that point openly professed allegiance to the Shah. “ It mav he assumed that this decision to limit the power of Persia w r as not merely a strict inter pretation of ‘ancient rights, tempered by actual possession,’ which was the desired basis of the settlement, hut also aimed at the protection of our own interests by preventing the too close approxi mation of Persia to our Indian frontier, and was further influenced by a consideration for the feelings of our immediate neighbour and ally the Amir of Cabul. “ At present these two extraneous factors have disappeared or are in abeyance, and we may con sider the Shah’s so-called grievances on their merits. And, firstly, as regards the Naizar, General Goldsmid has himself admitted the general fairness of the Persian claim, his previous ruling having been given under imperfect information for which his Persian colleague was mainly responsible. There can therefore be no impropriety in deciding that, the Naizar being regarded as a sort of neutral zone Between the two countries, the Persian villages to the south and the Afghan villages to the north shall participate in its benefits according to the recognized proprietary rights which they may re spectively enjoy. The second question is of a some what greater, though by no means of a paramount importance. General Goldsmid avowedly awarded the settlements on the right hank of the Helmund to the Afghans as a ‘ compensating benefit ’ for their loss under the arbitral decree of the ‘ more * Memorandum by Sir H. Rawlinson, November 1879. Note .—The Naizar is a reed swamp, the outskirts of which are sparsely populated by Persian and Afghan people. It is situated in the northern portion of Seistan proper, between the Persian and Afghan border.59 * coveted, more populous, aud richer ’ district of Seistan proper to the west of the river. It was no question of right, but simply of favour. The population on the right hank was not Persian nor Afghan, hut Beluch, and the Chiefs professed allegiance to one power or the other, as their interests at the time dictated. The Persians, more over, in the course of their encroachments had established military posts at the two most important posts east of the river, namely, at Nad-Ali and Kileh Puth ; and these garrisons have, as I believe, never yet been withdrawn, notwithstanding the award given seven years ago. Taking into con sideration, then, the extreme inconvenience of employing a river like the Ilelmund, frequently fordable, and always passable by boat or raft, as a boundary between two antagonistic powers like Persia and Afghanistan, I would suggest that we should no longer insist on the evacuation by Persia of Nad-Ali, connected as it is with Jehanabad and Nasirabad and other Persian towns on the western side of the river. As far indeed as we may be prepared to sanction the extension of Persian jurisdiction up the left bank of the Helmund, so far, I think, we should admit her territorial claim on the right bank of the river, the Beluches on both sides of the stream being in fact recognized as Persian Seistanis from Bender Kamal Khan, or possibly from Budbar, as far down as the embouchure of the Khash-rud, where Persian dominion would cease. Chakhansur, the only settlement of importance in this quarter, would con tinue to be Afghan, as being watered by the Khash-rud, which is essentually an Afghan river, and which forms the natural boundary between Herat and Candahar. “ The third grievance of Persia relates to the summary curtailment of her jurisdiction on the left bank of the Helmund by the adoption of Bend- i-Kohek as the boundary between the two States. General Goldsmid appears to have thought that, in sanctioning the extension of Persian right over all Seistan proper and as high up the Helmend as Bend-i-Kohuk, he had carried concession to its limit, and he fixed the frontier accordingly at the Bend, not because there was any geographical or ethnical line of demarcation at this particular point, but simply as a matter of sentiment and feeling. The Chiefs holding the lands on both sides of the river from Bend-i-Kohuk as far up as Budbur are Beluchis of the Sanjarain division, and, as far as nationality is concerned, are thus free to elect between Persian and Afghan allegiance. The two principal of these Chiefs, Imam Khan and Kamal Khan, have always professed themselves to be subjects of the Shah, and it was, no doubt, a feeling of personal mortification in being thus called upon to repudiate their proffered services, rather than any serious political interests, which disinclined His Majesty to General Goldsmid's arbitration. If we now wish to conciliate lersia60 without any real injury either to ourselves or to our Afghan allies, I can see no objection to recog nizing the. right of the Shah to the allegiance of the Behuchis on both banks of the Helmund as high up as Rudbar, where an Afghan population is first met with. From Bud bar to Girishk, the Noorzyes and Ishakzyes (Afghan Duranis) hold the entire country to the exclusion of the Beluchis, and here, of course, Persian influence could not be permitted to intrude itself. With a view indeed to prevent collision between the Persians and Afghans, it might be as well to provide that the Shah’s troops should not approach the frontier nearer than their present position at Kilek Path, the Persian Beluchis thus forming a buffer between them and the Afghans of Garmasel. If the Persian Government was accord ingly notified that the Naizar was no longer exclu sively Afghan, but would be enjoyed by the Persian Seistanis equally with the Afghans of Lash, and further that we recognized the allegiance to Persia of the Belueh tribes on both banks of the Helmund as high up as Rudbar, the Shah would probably be completely satisfied, and the Seistan question might be considered to be settled without the formal annexation of the country to Persia.” Persia and Kohuk. —Kohuk is a small tract of land, lying south of Seistan, between Persia and Khelat. The possession of it, with its small tributaries of Isfanda and Kunabasta, is much desired by the Shah. In Sir Frederic Goldsmid’s decision of 1871* on the Perso-Beluch boundary, the district of Kohuk was apportioned to Khelat. The Shah was willing to accept General Goldsmid’s decision in all other respects,! but the “ small tract ” in question was much coveted by His Majesty, who was anxious that a “ little alteration ” should be made in regard thereto. Mirza Saeed, the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, indeed, plainly saidj to Sir F. Goldsmid that the Persian Government only asked for a slight concession, which, “ to a Sovereign like “ that of Persia, could hardly be refused ; that the “ General had it in his power to do all that was “ required, and that he certainly could not hesitate “ to do it; that His Majesty had now abandoned “ much to meet the wishes of Her Majesty’s Go vernment, together with many similar allusions “ to the request communicated on the previous “ evening, that Kohuk might be included within “ Persian territory.” To all these protestations Sir F. Goldsmid’'repeated his regret “at being “ powerless in the matter. . . . From first to “ last he had consistently maintained one particular frontier as that of possession on either side, and “ that it was not in his power to give away this or “ that tract at pleasure.” After much discussion, the arbitration was ulti mately accepted by the Persian Government in the following terms :—§ “ In obedience to His Majesty’s orders, I beg, * Note of 7th November 1871. t Page 1216, Letters from Persia. 1871. t Page 326, Letters from India, October to December 1871. § Letter from Mirza Saeed Khan to Mr. * Alison, dated 4th September 1871.61 ir * Page 619, Letters from India, October to December 1871. in reply, most respectfully to state that the Persian Government, notwithstanding the clear right which it considered itself to have over Beluchistan, simply out of regard for the wishes of Her Britannic Majesty’s Government, that this question should be brought to a satisfactory conclusion by the definition of a boundary line, has hereby accepted your (Mr. Alison’s) letter and the map. The Persian Government now looks forward to the desirable results and important advantages which it expects from the British Government for this great act of compliance and co-operation on the part of Persia, and awaits to see what will emanate from the suitable manner in which the matter will be repre sented through the good offices of your Excellency, an experienced Minister and a well-wisher, perfectly cognizant of the whole details of the merits of the question.” The same day, however, the Persian Foreign Minister addressed a further Note * to Mr. Alison, worded as follows :— “ In accordance with His Majesty’s command and desire, I consider it my duty to trouble your Excellency with this statement, that the Persian Government, on the authority of the correspondence which has been forwarded from this Department to the Legation, from the beginning of the present discussion, and the verbal communications which have also taken place, considered itself entitled to distinct and manifest rights over most of the tracts of Beluchistan, and even over Kedj, Gwadur, &amp;c., but, in the last discussion, which took place in the presence of General Goldsmid, merely to facilitate matters, the Persian Government contented itself with requesting that a small portion of Persian Beluchistan, which, on the map, has been included in the Khelat territory, such as Kohuk, Isfanda, and Kunabasta, which are not large or important places, should, for certain reasons, be made over to Persia. General Goldsmid having excused himself on the plea that he was not authorized to entertain such a discussion on the part of his Government, the Persian Government has therefore referred this question to its own representative in London, who is to discuss this subject with the British Ministers, and ask for a settlement which may be in unison with justice and friendship. “ The Persian Ministers, considering the high opinion they have of the British Government, the great value they attach to its sense of justice and to the important results of its friendship, as also the friendly disposition of your Excellency, are in hopes that this simple request, which is so heartily desired by His Majesty, and which has not been granted here, may no longer be a source of disap pointment to fhem, who have exhibited perfect co-operation and compliance (with the wishes of England).” The Persian Ambassador at the Court of St. 3338. Qurging James brought the matter, at the same time, to the notice of Lord Granville.* It is not,” said Mirza Haji Mohsin Khan, in the matter, “ some miles of land about “ which my Government are anxious ; they art' “ concerned about a clear geographical line, well “ determined, and capable in future, by its very “ nature, of meeting any difficulty, as the map “ itself clearly and convincingly shows'” Haji Mohsin Khan, in submitting the wishes of his Government, expressed himself as follows :—f “ 1 am charged by His Imperial Majesty to ex press his desire to see this question decided according to what appears to my august master the most conformable to the interests of the future. I hope that your Excellency will sympathize fully with the views of His Imperial Majesty, and that you will appreciate the justice of his request, which has no further object than to put an end, in a clear and decided manner, to a state of things which cannot but be a source of difficulty and perpetual dis order. “ Your Excellency will allow me not to withhold from you that, in more than one instance, the Government of His Imperial Majesty has, in certain points, met with an inflexibility on the part of the Indian Government, seemingly but little in accord ance with the desire to be in harmony with a friendly Government,” &amp;c., &amp;c. The matter being again referred to Sir E. Gold- smid, he suggested that his original decision should be so far modified^; as to include Kohuk “ within “ the Persian line of frontier, on the understanding “ that the Khan of Khelat consents to this arrange- “ ment, solely in the wish to provide a boundary ic convenient in a geographical sense, therefore the' “ more likely to secure peace to the border tracts, “ and that Persia pledges herself to restrain her “ Governors from oppressing the inhabitants or “ making exactions from them to which they have “ been unused, leaving them, in fact, in every &lt;£ respect as heretofore.” To this the Government of India demurred, * Letter from Foreign OIHe&lt; her 1871. • Lilh No vein t Page 345, Home OoiTespomlence, October to December 1871. stating,—§ We do not consider that we should be justified in declaring territories to belong geographically to Persia which she does not actually possess, and it appears to us to be highly undesirable that the British Government should be committed to any stipulation as to the manner in which Persia is to deal with districts once admitted to belong to her. Under these circumstances, we are of opinion that the boundary of Persia at this part of the line should be laid down to the west of Kohuk district, and the Khelat boundary to the east of the Kohuk district, viz., by the Mashkid river. “ We do not consider that we are required to com mit ourselves to any opinin as to the future status of Kohuk. The western boundary of Khelat beiiiL + bilge 577, Letter from Imliit.

Rawlinson’s views on the subiect will be 1. Uo, Secret Despatch to India, 1873. gathered from the following Memorandum :—* “I doubt the possibility of maintaining the district of Kohuk in a practically independent position. If tiie Khelat frontier be drawn to the east of it, it will virtually lapse to Persia, for Ibrahim Khan will be constantly exerting a pressure which there will be no means of resisting, and Kohuk will thus be crushed out, without Kelat or the British Government having an opportunity of remonstrance. This result, whatever might be its local effect, would be discreditable to us, after we had been at so much pains to prevent it. I think, therefore, we had better make a virtue of necessity^ and consider a geographical frontier only, which, as Major St. John has abundantly shown,* must, as far as Kelat is concerned, pass to the east of Kohuk. I don’t see that we should be sacrificing any real political rights by this arrangement, for what pos sible claim could a petty frontier Chief possess to national independence ? and we should, at any rate, benefit to the extent of placing Persia under a certain obligation to us. To preserve Kohuk as a neutral territory we must guarantee it against the interference of its two powerful neighbours, and this, I presume, is going further than we con template. ’ After careful consideration of the question, a t ^ret Despatch to India, No. 2, dated Despatch! was addressed to the Government of ~ 8t 1 ‘ ucll ^' &gt; ' India, of which the following are the important paragraphs:— “ The proposal to draw two lines of frontier, one east of Kohuk, for Khelat, and one west, for Persia, would appear to pledge Her Majesty’s Government indirectly to the maintenance of an independent State where independence would be neither neces sary nor expedient. Her Majesty’s Government would prefer, therefore, to draw the line east of Kohuk as the boundary of Khelat, making no speci fication of the actual boundary of Persia to the westward at all. This arrangement would seem to meet the political as well as geographical require ments of the case, without committing Her Majesty’s Government to any inconvenient responsibility. The Chief of Kohuk can possess no claim to be declared independent, and Major St. John’s recent inquiries have confirmed the truth of the suppo sition that, so far as Khelat is concerned, the geo graphical frontier must pass to the eastward of his territory. “ That there should be no misapprehension on either side as to the precise terms of the settlement.64. copy of the modified Note,* which has been for warded to the Foreign Office for transmission to Her Majesty’s Minister at Teheran, in substitution of that dated the 1st September 1871, is herewith enclosed. A map is under preparation, and will shortly follow.” The terms of the modified Note, which practically left Kohuk independent, and gave it neither to Persia nor Khelat, were not approved by either power to whom they were communicated. The ground of objection taken up by the Persian Minister, according to Mr. Alison,f was that “ when &lt;c the Persian Government accepted the settlement of “ September 1871, they believed they had ground to ec expect that, on revision by Her Majesty’s Govern- ' ment of the decision given in respect to the line of “ frontier, the district of Kohuk would be given to “ Persia, and that as there were only two claimants for this territory, it having been taken from the one it would naturally fall to the other to receive ” it; that, if allowed to remain uncontrolled, it would become a centre of intrigue against Persian “ Baluchistan ; and that the district has been, and at this moment is, actually in the possession of Persia, and garrisoned by Persian troops. “ Under these circumstances, His Highness said &lt;c that he was desirous to make a further represen- “ tation to Her Majesty’s Government, in the hope “ that the territory in question would he conceded ct to Persia, or that in declaring by note the line of “ frontier of Khelat, which would be most scrupu- ** lously respected, the Persian frontier in that quarter would he left undefined.” The Khan of Khelat protested in the following terms :—J “ Your friendly letter, informing me of your welfare, and forwarding several letters regarding the boundary between Persia and my country, as also a map of the same, reached me at a good time, and I understand all that was written in a friendly spirit. I request that you Alijah will write to the Commissioner in Sind as follows on my account,— That the boundary is not the same as in my grand father’s time, Meer Nusseer Khan. Moreover, a great deal has been taken possession of by the Persians. The boundary shown in the map only shows lands now in my possession. The British Government are a powerful sovereignty. I look upon myself as obedient to them, and therefore hoped that, if the Government above named put their hand to this business, they would, of course, have recovered lands in possession of my grand father from the Persians, and restored the same to me. From the present decision of boundary a great deal of my country has been entered within Persian border. Your Government should know this.” The views of Sir F. Goldsmid, who was consulted in the matter, may be gathered from the following extract.—§ “ If, to my mind, there existed any true grounds # JVbte .—This modified note ran as fol lows :— “ Commencing from the northernmost point, or that which is furthest from the sea, the territory of Khelat is hounded generally to the west by the large Persian district of Dizzuk, which is composed of many delis, or minor districts, those on the frontier being Jalk and Kalegan. But below the two last named, and between Dizzuk and Punjghur, is a tract of land called distinctively Kohuk, but comprising Kohuk, Kunabasta, and Is- fanda, with reference to which the line will be drawn so as to include tiie barren lands of Gurh and Segzi, within the limits of Punj ghur, these lauds thus marking the actual Kelat frontier. “ 2. Below Punjghur, the frontier posses sions ofKhelatto the sea areBoleida, including Zamiran and other dependencies, Mund, and Dusht. Within the Persian line of frontier are the villages or tracts belonging to Sirbaz and Bahu Dastyari. The boundary of Dusht is marked by a long line drawn west of the Draboly Hill, situated between the rivers Bahu and Dusht, to the sea in the Bay of Gwuttur. “ 3. To summarize,—Punjghur, including Gurh and Segzi, also Parum and other de pendencies; Boleida, including Zamiran and other dependencies ; Mund, including Tump, Nasserabad, Kedj, and other districts, dehs, and dependencies to the eastward ; Dusht, with its dependencies as far as the sea,—these names exhibit the line of frontier of Khelat, that is to say, all tracts to the east of the frontier of actual Persian possession, which frontier comprises Dizzuk, inclusive of Bam- pusht, Sirbaz, and Peshin, Bahu and Dast- yari. “ 4.

The proposed modification which I had the honour to submit was in the belief that a quasi concession to Persia was contemplated, and, although not concurred in by the subsequent Despatch from Simla, the proposal substituted seemed to foreshadow a result which might not in “ I am to state that the original decision of Her Majesty’s Government in the Mekran arbi tration, as accepted by the Shah on 4th September 1871, excluded Kohuk from the possessions allotted to Persia and awarded it to Khelat. t£ This decision was so far subsequently modified that the boundary of the latter State was drawn to the east instead of the west of Kohuk, thus excluding Khelat from that district, although not formally allotting it to Persia. “This modification was not accepted by the Persian Government, in consequence of which the original award as pointed out by Mr. Thomson holds good. “ Under these circumstances, Lord Salisbury would suggest that Mr. Thomson should be in structed to inquire if the Shah is willing to assent to the line of Khelat boundary laid down in the amended note which was submitted to His Majesty’s Government in substitution of that presented on 1st September 1871. “ In such case, it should be pointed out, as stated in my letter of 22nd June last, that 4 under any ‘ circumstances the line drawn east of Kohuk must * clearly not be transgressed.’ - 1875, No. 89. practice prove dissimilar.” On reference being again made on the subject to 75 1 N ter s 9 ° Fore,gn 0ffice ’ 25th Februar y the India Office, Lord Salisbury wrote as follows: —* 3338. R66 “ In the event of Persia declining to accept the modified note above alluded to, Persia has obviously no right to interfere in Kohuk, from which district that power was excluded by the original award to which she gave her assent.” At length, after repeated interviews on the sub- ject* between Mr. Thomson and Mirza Saeed Khan, . Letter from Foreign Office, 7th October in which the latter urged that any representation 1875, No. 720. his Government might wish to make relative to Kohuk should be received by the British Govern ment prior to the signature of the note,—a course of proceeding to which Her Majesty’s representative at Teheran strongly objected,—the Persian Minister entreated “ Mr. Thomson not to press the matter “ further for the present, so that he (Mirza Saeed ‘ c Khan) might have an opportunity of learning, “ through Mirza Malcolm Khan, Lord Derby’s “ sentiments with reference to its final decision. “ The delay, he said, would not exceed forty days, kt as he would instruct the Persian Minister in “ London to convey to him Lord Derbv’s opinion “ by telegraph.” Sir H. Rawlinson at this time recorded the fol- lowing Memorandum on the subjectt t &amp;&lt;!

It is true that General Goldsmid, in the first in stance, assigned Kohuk to Khelat, because the Persian Commissioner attached to the arbitration neglected to prove the right of the Shah to the district in question; but, on further examination and inquiry. General Goldsmid admitted that the right of Khelat was equally unproved, and he pro posed accordingly, in the revised note of 1873, to* leave the district as a sort of neutral territory, the frontiers of Khelat being drawn to the east of it, and the frontier of Persia to the west, and the Go vernment of India seems to consider it a point of honour to uphold this award of their Commissioner. “ But the Persian Government very justly argues that the function of the Commissioner was to arbi trate on a disputed line of frontier beween Persia and Khelat, not to create independent intermediate States; and it thus assumes that what is not as signed to Khelat must, of necessity, belong to Persia, which principle, accordingly, the Shah seems to desire that we shall officially admit. “ The true reason, I believe, why the Shah hesi tates to accept and ratify the revised note is that he mistrusts our policy. Since there is no difference apparently between the territorial result as desired by him and as admitted by us, Kohuk in both cases coming into the possession of Persia, he is fain to suspect that our persistent opposition to his wishes must cover some deep political design, such, for instance, as the possible assertion of the right of67 Kharan, a fief of Cabul, to the district in question a claim which might consist with our interests, hut which we should be debarred from supporting if we had definitively assigned Kohuk to Persia. There is not, of course, in reality any such ‘ arridre pensee * upon our part. It is a mere point of honour with us not to allow Persia to have too much of her own way; and thus for a shadow, a simple formality which possesses no importance whatever, and re- gaiding which, as far as the merits of the case are concerned, we are, I believe, altogether in the wrong,—for Kohuk does most decidedly belong to Persia, both geographically and historically,—we arc causing an amount of irritation and ill will at Teheran which imperils substantial interest^ and may lead to the most serious results. The Shah’s proposal now is to transfer the nego- tions regarding Kohuk from Teheran to London, and that is, I believe, the safest course to pursue on the present state of affairs, which is really be coming critical. At any rate, I would not follow the recommendation of the Government of India to adopt stringent measures for enforcing the Shah’s acceptance of the revised note, as that would very possibly lead to a suspension of our relations with the Persian Court.” The Persian Minister at this Court addressed to * Letter from Foreign Office, 29th Novem- the Earl a letter* at this period, Urging him her 1875, No. 856. to send telegraphic instructions to the British Le gation at Teheran to suspend all fresh action relative to Kohuk, in order that the question might be referred to London to a special Conference. “ Her Britannic Majesty’s Commissioners,” adds Haji Malcolm Khan, “ who met together respecting “ the settlement of these frontiers, being in London, “ and I myself having received ample instructions “ on the subject, we could easily arrive at a satis- “ factory solution, and avoid misunderstandings in “ regard to form, which at this moment threaten “ in a sad way to pervert the simple character of “ the question.” i8'5 LettCr t0 Foreign 16tl1 February In the opinion, however, of Lord Salisbury! the proposed transfer of negotiations was not con venient, nor be likely to lead to an early or satis factory settlement of the question at issue.

When, however, two years later, the 1876 ettei * r0m Forei ® n Persian Government intimated§ to Mr. Thomson that Azad Khan of Kharan was threatening the Persian frontier, and that if he was not restrained the local authorities would follow him up and punish him wherever he might be, “ even should “ they have to cross over the frontier line,” Mr. Thomson reminded the Persian Minister that, “ by “ the decision of General Goldsmid, which was “ accepted by the Persian Government, the district “ of Kohuk (presumed to be referred to) belonged H t .. p . “ to Khelat and not to Persia.” The Persian 1876 (No!446; 11 t&gt;!e,gn 24tl1 Jul 7 Minister in reply || reiterated the decided opinion of68 the Persian Government that “ Kohuk is as for- “ merly an integral part of Persian territory.Thus the whole matter lias remained in an undefined and unsatisfactory condition. Persia and the Navigation of the Karun, &amp;c.—The improvement of roads and communicat ions in Persia is a point vitally connected with the chances of revivifying the prosperity of that country. All that has already been accomplished in this respect due to Russia. In this sense, great is changes have occurred* in the neighbourhood of Northern Persia, all tending to improve the conditions under which the Russian competes with the British merchant. Many hundred steam vessels now ply on the Volga; a resrular service is maintained durinsr the season between the mouth of that O * Major Champain, Government of India, May 1876. 30th March 1876, No, 21, Secret, 11th river and the Persian ports on the Caspian ; a rail way now connects Poti with Tiflis, and is being continued to Baku, while it is merely a question of time when the railway system of the Caucasus will be extended to the Persian frontier on the A raxes, less than 100 miles from Tabriz, Whilst such is the favourable progress being made by Russia in the north in the interests of trade, England has, as yet, not been able to effect any improvement in the south. The shortest and most generally followed road from Bushire to the interior of Persia is pecu liarly difficult. No less than seven severe passes have to be surmounted between the sea and Shiraz, a distance of 280 miles, the road at one spot rising to an altitude of 7,000 feet; and from Bushire by Shiraz, to the capital, where there is of course the greatest demand for European manufactures, the distance is nearly 800 miles. In these conditions, it is hardly to be wondered at, that trade from the southern ports of Persia is completely eclipsed by that in the north from the Caspian and the Cau casian provinces, and that Russian manufactures are steadily superseding British products even at Ispahan and the Persian markets south of that centre. It is obvious, therefore, that in the interests of Persia, of Great Britain, and of India, any steps for smoothing away the obstacles which impede the free movement of trade from the south are of great consequence, and in the Karun river is found the scheme which promises the best results in return for the smallest outlay of energy and money. Bushire has no harbour, and is cut off from *the Persian centres of trade by a difficult range of mountains. Lingah presents the same conditions. Bunder Abbas has a harbour, but its distance from the commercial centres of Persia and other physical objections prevent it from com peting even with Bushire. On the other hand, Mohammerah and the Karun river offer easy means of commercial access to some of the richest parts of the Persian Empire. Moham- merahf as a port offers unusual advantages; it communicates with the sea not only by the Shat-i-Arab river, which is navigable by ocean f Mob am me rah, as has already been noted, is situated on the north bank of the Hafar canal, connecting the river Shat-i- Arab and the Bahamishir.* The Bahamishir is Persian on both sides, while the right bank of the Shat-i- Arab is Turkish territory. | Home Correspondence, 1875, Vol. 6, p. 399. India Collection, No. 87, 26th Sep tember 1872. | Mr. Mackenzie is a partner in the firm of Messrs. Gray, Dawes, &amp; Co., whose firm has been established for the last twelve years in different parts of Persia. He has visited Khuzistan and passed from Ispahan to Shuster. steamers of moderate tonnage, but by the Khur Bahamishir,* which offers a channel of not less than nine feet deep at low water. The climate of Mo- hammerah is said to be fairly good throughout the year (although opinions on this subject are some what varied), and up to the end of March may be called cold. Lieutenant Selby proved by actual experiment in 1842f that the river Karun was ad mirably adapted for steam navigation all the year round from the sea to within six miles of Shuster, while by the Ab-i-Gargar canal, which leaves the Karun some 30 miles below Shuster, river steamers can in the driest season run to within one mile of the town. The inland journey from Shuster to Ispahan is, by the account of Mr. Mackenzie, J easier than that from Bushire to Shiraz, and no doubt the establishment of a regular caravan would lead to the discovery of easier routes. It has been cal culated by competent persons that, were the Karun opened for navigation up to Shuster, goods could be delivered at Ispahan at 35 krans per load of 350 lbs. as against 60 krans per load sent from Bushire to Ispahan, via Shiraz. Under such con ditions, direct tea trade with England or India via the Karun river would beat that by the north com pletely out of the field. Moreover, cotton, naphtha, and other valuable articles of Persian export might be shipped by the merchants at a profit to England and India. In the recent famine in Persia at least 80,000 tons of grain were said to be lying idle at Kermanshah, on account of the impossibility of removal. At the average price of wheat at that place and at Teheran or Bushire, no less a sum than 700,000/. might have passed into Persian pockets had it been possible to convey the corn to Mohammerah. With regard to the trade from the Mediterranean to Persia and Central Asia, it must be remembered that the Turks have allowed the trade from the Black Sea eastwards to fall into Russian hands, and that English commerce, instead of passing through Trebizond and Erzeroum has, until recently, taken the Tiflis route. Up to the present, Russia has not levied transit duty on European goods passing through Trans-Caucasia to Persia; one reason for this departure from her usual policy has been probably the fear of an alternative route being established through Turkish territory; another, perhaps, the advantages derived from the carrying trade enjoyed by the Poti-Tiflis Railway. Accord ing to a recent communication (dated 1st June 1878) from Major Smith, of the Telegraph Depart ment in Persia, a change of policy has now taken place; owing to ravages caused by the war, the Erzeroum road, as a trade route, has practically ceased to exist, and the Russian Government, think ing that the Caucasus would have a monopoly of the transit, have extended their general system to that province, with the object of shutting all but Russian merchandise out of Northern and Central Persia. Major Smith, judging by the greatly70 * increased commercial activity prevailing at Bagdad, Bussorah, and Kermanshab, which he attributes both to the war and to the Russian transit regula tions, thinks that in this matter the Czar’s Govern ment have somewhat overreached themselves by overlooking the facilities offered for European commerce by the Bagdad route. He goes on to urge that the present juncture seems an opportune one for the adoption of measures calculated to fix the southern as the main artery of the external commerce of Persia, and by its means to secure for England and India the bulk of the trade of the country. He specially urges the advantages offered by an opening up of the Karun river to steam navigation, a measure which has already been advocated witli the Persian Government, but which, owing it is believed to the supremacy of Russian influence at Teheran, has not hitherto been accepted by the Shah. Major Smith believes that the opening of the Karun, unaffected as it would he by any possible increase in existing Turkish transit duties, would render permanent the present temporary diversion of traffic from the north to the south of Persia. From the correspondence in our possession on this subject, it appears that, following Lieutenant Selby’s operations in 1842, attention was again attracted to the navigation of the Karun in 1857 in connection with our then military operations along that line. Captain Rennie, I. N., steamed up the river to the Ahwaz rapids. Again in 1864 Sir Lewis Pelly, then Resident in the Persian Gulf, visited the Hafar canal, and also moved along a small channel which connects the Karun with Dorati, the capital of the Chat Arabs. Subset quently Mr. Edwin Dawes, of the firm of Messrs. Gray, Dawes, &amp; Co., visited the Gulf line and turned special attention to the practical advantages of the Karun. The course of correspondence which followed on the subject is herewith briefly sum marized for convenience of reference. In 1871, Messrs. Gray, Paul, &amp; Co. brought to notice the desirability of developing this trade oute. The project was supported by Sir L. Pelly,* * Collection to Political Despatch to Resident in the Persian Gulf, Who in a letter to Bombay, No. 68, dated 6th December 1871. Mr. Alison at Teheran mentioned that he “ had “ long been impressed with the physical advantages “ of the line.” The matter having been referred home to this Office without remark by both the Governments of Indiaf and Bombay,J was com- t Political Letter, No. 174, dated 24th municated to the Foreign Office, who desired that Cctober isa. a further reference might be made to the authorities ^ P L, ' ttcr ’ y °- 4() ’ &lt;h ‘ tetl ah in India, asking for an expression of their views.

If Secret Letter from India, No. 19, dated 12th April 1876, Vol. 8, p. 745. ** Aotc.—The proposals here alluded to were the schemes for steam navigation on the Karun advocated by Messrs. Gray, Paul, and Co., and by Messrs. Lynch of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company. Mr. Alison’s belief that the present time was un- propitious for pressing any scheme for a steamer service upon the Government of the Shah, they were not at present prepared to give any practical support to the project. Mr. Alison’s opinion may be quoted:—“ The “ whole of the available resources of the State are now applied to keeping the people from starva- “ tion, and I do not think that the Shah’s Ministers “ would be prepared to enter into a contract for “ subsidizing a line of steamers for the purposes “ contemplated by Messrs. Gray, Paul, &amp; Co.” The authorities consulted by the Government of India as to the adaptability of the Karun for navi gation were, in addition to Lieutenant Selby’s Iteport, a Memorandum on Mohammerah and the Karun by Major-General Sir W. F. Williams, dated 25th October 1856, Major Wray’s Journal of the Campaign in Persia in 1856-57, and certain extracts from the notes of an anonymous traveller in that part of the country. These authorities all agreed as to the practicability of the river. The letter from the Government of India was communicated to the Foreign Office,* and the whole question allowed to drop for the moment. In the spring of 1875, Messrs. Gray, Dawes, &amp; Co. brought the matter again to the notice of Her Majesty’s Government, but it was deemed advisable not to raise the question pending a settlement of the whole subject of Consular jurisdiction in the south of Persia then under review. The matter, however, again came forward in an indirect manner by certain proposals made by Her Majesty’s Minister at Teheran for the engagement of British Officers to drill the Persian army, which elicited from the Government of India further views as to the desirability of opening up the southern communication of Persia. Lord Northbrook’s Minutef recorded on the 20th May 1875, concluded as follows:—“ I should be “ disposed to encourage and support any substan- “ tial proposal for opening out communications “ between the Persian Gulf and the interior of “ Persia. The policy here enunciated was supported by Sir H. Norman, J and was concurred in by Lord Salisbury,§ who caused a Despatch || to be addressed to the Government of India, inquiring whether the Viceroy contemplated that, “under any circum- “ stances, the suggested encouragement and sup- “ port should take the form of a pecuniary grant “ from Indian revenues, either in the shape of “ subsidy or otherwise.” Lord Northbrook’s reply If was to the effect, that the proposal to which he more particularly alluded in his previous Minute, was that for the establish ment of steam communication on the Karun. His Lordship further went on to say :—“ In the event “ of either** of these proposals proceeding further, I “ think it would be worth while for the Govem- “ ment of India to encourage it by some subsidy, “ and Her Majesty’s Minister at Teheran might be72 i “ instructed to ascertain whether the Persian Go- “ vernment would be prepared to support such a “ project without asking for any subsidy, which “ the Persian Government can hardly be in a “ position to give.” Important papers bearing on the question were subsequently received from India in a letter,* dated 11th May 1870 (No. 21, Secret), the enclo sures to which consisted of memoranda by Sir L. Pelly and Major Bateman-Champain, as well as of despatches from Mr. Taylour Thomson, all of which urged the expediency of encouraging the project put forward by Messrs. Gray, Dawes, &amp; Co. This firm had for some time been en deavouring to obtain a concession from the Govern ment of theShah, for leave to work, without subsidy, a line of steamers on the river. Their efforts had hitherto been unsuccessful, and Major Champain attributed their failure to the intrigues of the Russian legation at Teheran. Lord Lytton’s Government con sidered that the influence of Her Majesty’s Minister at the court of the Shah might fairly be employed to secure a favourable hearing for the scheme, and commended “ the subject to the early consideration “ of Her Majesty’s Government, with special refer- “ ence to the commercial and political importance ' of such a highway for British trade in Southern Persia.” Purther investigations as to the capabilities of the route were subsequently undertaken by officers of the Indian Government. In a memorandum,f dated 20th March 1876, attached to his trade re port, Colonel Nixon, the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia, mentions that he steamed up the Karun from Mohammerah to Ahwaz, and that he was impressed more especially with the political advan tages of an opening of the river to British trade. The Karun wus also visited and formally reported on by Mr. Robertson,! Assistant Political Agent at Bussorah in the spring of 1876, and Colonel Prideaux,§ whose excursion took place in October of the same year, when the river was at its lowest, and who formed an unfavourable opinion of it. The Marquis of Salisbury (as Secretary of State for India) being disposed to share the views of Lord Lytton’s Government as to the advisability of setting diplomatic action in motion at Teheran, caused a letter|| to be addressed to the Foreign Office on the 13th July 1876, in the following terms:—“ Lord Salisbury fully concurs in the “ views expressed by Lord Lytton’s Government on “ this subject, and desires to suggest for Lord “ Derby’s consideration that Her Majesty’s Minister “ at Teheran should be instructed to use every “ effort to procure the withdrawal by the Persian « Government of the conditions^ which, at the last « moment, that Government has apparently decided “ to attach to navigation of the Karun, and which, “ if maintained, may have the effect of indefinitely “ postponing the realization of a project important * Letters from India, 1876, Vol. 8, pp. 965, &amp;c. f Letters from India, Vol. 9, 1876, p. 122. | Letters from India, 1876, Vol. 10, p. 372. § Letters from India, 1876, Vol. 11, p. 571. i] Home Correspondence, 1876, Vol. 12, p. 79. • f Note .—These conditions were that if the Karun were opened to navigation, the Government of the Shah should be entitled to levy such dues and charges as they might think fit.73 s * Home Correspondence, 1876, Vol. 12, p. 605. | Letters from India, 1876, Vol. 10, p. 369.

Shortly afterwards a despatch bearing on this very point was received from the Government of Indiaf (No. 42, Secret, dated 28th September), the pith of which was that no delay should be allowed to take place before an opportunity was made to urge the matter strongly upon the Government of the Shah. A rejoinder from Mr. Thomson, § dated 30th October in the same year, was to the effect that he fully appreciated the importance of the Karun navigation question and would use his best endeavours to bring the matter to as speedy a conclusion as possible. Notwithstanding the anxiety thus evinced by the British Government to open out the navigation of the Karun, nothing came of Mr. Thomson’s repre sentations at Teheran. In the summer of 1878,. however, when the subject of the relations between England and Persia again occupied the minds of the Shah and his advisers, Mr. Bonald Thomson, || in the course of several conversations, reminded the Foreign Minister that Persia herself was principally to blame for any coldness which might appear to exist towards her on the part of England ; she had refused, for instance, to open the Karun navigation to British commerce, although that measure had been pressed by us, and would have been of im mense advantage to Persia. The Sepah Salar admitted that Persia was throwing away her oppor tunities, but bewailed her misfortunes in being, as he said, “ thrown over by England, who did every- ' thing for Turkeyand nothing for Persia.” In subsequent conversation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, His Highness informed Mr. Thomson** that if England would engage to defend Persia from K-ussian aggression, the Shah would undertake, amongst other important concessions, to “ give every facility for our trade; to concede the “ navigation of the Karun, and similar privileges, “ and to place British commercial relations with “ Persia upon the most favourable footing.” The general result of the intercommunications which have gone on for so long a period in regard to the Karun is that the Shah is prepared to meet the British Government half way in the matter. 3338. T74 In addition to the scheme of the Karan river, there is another project for opening up communica tions from the Persian Gulf with the interior of Persia, viz., the construction of a railway line from Bagdad or Mohammerah to Ispahan and Teheran. It seems unnecessary here to do more than merely allude to the concession for the construction of railways in Persia granted by the Shall to Baron Beuter in 1872, inasmuch as that concession was shortly afterwards cancelled by His Majesty, al though on pretexts the validity of which have never been admitted by the British Government or Baron Beuter. In November 1878,* the Persian Govern ment offered a concession to the Baron for a rail way from Mohammerah to Teheran on the same terms that had been granted to a French Company for a line from Besht to Teheran. This offer Baron Beuter declined to accept, on the ground that he could not undertake any work in Persia, except under the general concession of 1872. He, at the same time, lodged a formal protest at Teheran against any concession being granted to any other parties. This protest Her Majesty’s Minister at Teheran supported. Baron Keuterf appears shortly afterwards to have somewhat modified his views. On the 1st February 1879, he addressed a letter to the Foreign Office, declaring his readiness to make a railway from Mohammerah, or some other point in the south of Persia, “if the Indian Government will give an “ annual subsidy towards the interest of the “ capital required.” This proposal having been referred by the Foreign Office^ for any observations which Lord Cranbrook might have to make, His Lordship’s views were expressed as follows in Sir L. Mallet’s letter§ of the 1st March 1879. “ The “ Indian Government have, on more than one t( occasion, expressed its willingness to encourage “ any practical scheme for opening communications u in the south of Persia, and Baron Beuter’s present “ proposal shall be referred for the consideration of the Viceroy in Council. But, before taking this “ step it is essential that Lord Cranbrook should “ be informed whether the Imperial Government *• is prepared to give any support to the undertaking “ On this point His Lordship desires to refer Lord “ Salisbury to Lord Derby’s Despatch to Mr. T. “ Thomson, No. 12, dated 27th February 1877. If “ that Despatch expresses the present views of Her “ Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs “ and the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, “ further reference to India is unnecessary, as there “ are no grounds upon which the burden of a “ subsidy, such as Baron Beuter desires, could be “ thrown upon the revenues of that country, inde- pendently of the co-operation of the Imperial “ Government.” Consequent upon these remarks the Foreign Office* consulted the Treasury as to whether the Board were prewired to offer any contributions out of Imperial Funds towards the subsidy desired by the Karim should be thrown open to Russian and other steamers alike. This point is worthy of consideration when the moment arrives, provided the “ most favoured nation” clause in the Russian Commercial Treaty of Turko- manchaie can be got over.

The Treasury, replied on the 20th March 1879, that “ My Lords cannot see their “ way to offer any contribution from Imperial “ funds in aid of the proposed undertaking.’’ This decision having been communicated to the India Office, the Secretary of State’s view, as expressed in Sir L. Mallet’s letter of the 28th April, was as follows:—“ On the assumption, therefore, that the “ refusal of the Treasury to make any grant from “ Imperial Revenues is final, and that Sir H. “ Selwin Ibbotson’s letter of the 20th March ex- “ presses the deliberate decision of the Imperial “ Government not to extend material aid to any pro- “ ject of the kind for the development of Southern “ Persia in British interests, Lord Cranbrook sees no “ alternative but to inform Baron Reuter, as Lord “ Salisbury proposes, that neither the Imperial “ Government nor that of India is in a position to “ contribute funds towards the proposed under- “ taking.” In a Secret Despatch, No. 18, dated 30th April 1879, the correspondence that had passed in con nection with Baron Reuter’s railway scheme was transmitted for the information of Lord Lytton’s Government, since which time nothing more has passed on the subject, Persia and her Integritt.— This question, which had long lain dormant, was again raised by the present Shah in 1873. Prior to the death of Futteh Ali Shah in October 1834 there were indications of probable civil discord in Persia in regard to the succession to the throne, * Mi . Bligh to Viscount Palmerston, 28th whereupon Count Nesselrode expressed great* June 1834. anxiety to the British Minister at St. Petersburg that “His Majesty’s Government should have a “ good understanding with the Russian Government “ respecting that country, where he considers that “ our interests are so very similar.” The interchange of views between the two Go vernments which ensued resulted in a complete accord of opinion as to the selection of Mahomed Mirza, upon which Lord Palmerston addressed f Viscount Palmerston to Mr. Bligh, 5th Mr. Blight as follows :— September 1834. „ Y ou a ] s0 sa y that His Majesty’s Govern ment are gratified to find that the Governments of Great Britain and Russia are acting with regard to the affairs of Persia, in the same spirit, and are equally animated by a sincere desire to maintain, not only the internal tranquillity but also the inde pendence and integrity of Persia. His Highness will at all times find a real pleasure in co-operating with that of Russia for such purposes, and instruc tions have been sent to the British President at Teheran to communicate confidentially with the Russian Representative in the furtherance of the common views of the two Governments.” When Mahomed Mirza succeeded shortly after wards to the throne, matters went, for a while, smoothly enough, but Russian influence soon gained76 complete ascendency over the Shah s mind, which was bent, under Russian inspiration, on extension of territory eastwards, much to the chagrin of the British Government. This led to the siege of Herat by the Persian army in the early part of 1838, during which event the good understanding so recently arrived at between the British and Russian Governments on the subject of Persia became a complete farce, and gave rise to a further correspondence between the two Governments, of which the following is a brief record:—* “The undersigned, &amp;c., is instructed by his Government to state to his Excellency Count Nesselrode, &amp;e., that events, whicli have lately occurred in Persia and in Afghanistan, render it necessary for the British Government to request from that of Russia explanations with respect to certain circumstances which are connected with those events, and which have an important bearing upon the relations between Russia and Great Britain. “ It is unnecessary* for the undersigned to remind Count Nesselrode that the British and Russian Governments have, for a long time past, and from similar motives, taken a deep interest in the affairs of Persia. “ To Russia, Persia is an immediate neighbour ; the frontiers of the two countries touch ; and it is a legitimate object of solicitude to Russia that her neighbour should be friendly and tranquil, so that the Russian territory should be secure from attack, and the Russian population should be free from the uneasiness which civil commotions in an adjoining country have a tendency to create. Russia, there fore, must naturally desire that the Persian nation should be prosperous and contented, and that the Persian Government should abstain from all ex ternal aggression, should direct its attention exclu sively to internal improvement, and should occupy itself in the pursuits of peace. “ Great Britain has regarded Persia as a barrier for the security of British India against attack from any European power. With this defensive view, Great Britain has contracted alliance with Persia, and the object of that alliance has been, that Persia should be friendly to Great Britain, independent of foreign control, and at peace with all her neigh bours. “ The interests, therefore, of Great Britain and Russia, with regard to Persia, are not merely com patible, but almost the same, and hence the two Governments have felt that, having common objects to attain in Persia, they would find it to their mutual advantage to consult together upon matters connected with Persian affairs, and to endeavour to pursue, with respect to those affairs, a common course. “ The expediency of such concert between Great Britain and Russia upon Persian affairs has fre quently been urged by the Russian Government, and acknowledged by that of Great Britain. * Viscount Palmerston to the Marquis of Clanricarde* 26th October 1838.—(Corre spondence, Persia and Afghanistan, 1839.)^0 77 “ But, in 1836, the Shah announced an intention of undertaking an expedition to attack and conquer Herat, founding that intention upon some anti quated and obsolete claims of a former dynasty of Persia upon Afghanistan. “ The British Minister at Teheran was instructed to dissuade the Shah from such an enterprise, urging reasons of indisputable force, and founded upon the interests of the Shah himself. “ But the advice given by the Russian Ambassa dor was all of an opposite tendency. For while Mr. McNeill was appealing to the prudence and the reason of the Shah, Count Simonich was ex citing the ambition, and inflaming the passions of that Sovereign; while the one was preaching moderation and peace, the other was inciting to war and conquest; and while the one pointed out the difficulties and expense of the enterprise, the other inspired hopes of money and assistance. “ This conduct on the part of Count Simonich, so much at variance with the professed policy of Russia, determined the British Government to seek explanations at St.‘ Petersburg. And accordingly, in February 1837, the Earl of Durham stated to Count Nesselrode what Count Simonich was doing, and inquired whether that Ambassador was acting in pursuance of instructions from his Government. “ The answer of Count Nesselrode to this inquiry was plain, direct, and unequivocal. He stated, indeed, that he could not but entertain some doubt of the accuracy of the reports which had reached the British Government; but he declared that if Count Simonich had acted in the manner repre sented, he had done so in direct opposition to his instructions, which distinctly enjoined him to dis suade the Shah from making war against Herat, at any time, and under any circumstances. “ Such were the professions and declarations of the Russian Government at St. Petersburg, but very different have been the proceedings of the Russian agents in Persia. “ The undersigned is further instructed to state that the British Government possess a copy of a treaty which has been concluded between Persia and the Afghan Ruler of Candahar, the execution of which has been guaranteed by Count Simonich, and the stipulations of which are injurious and offensive to Great Britain. The guarantee which Count Simonich has given to this treaty tends to afford Russia, if she adopts the guarantee, a pre tence to compel the Shah of Persia, not only to make himself master of Herat, but to deliver over that city afterwards to the Rulers of Candahar, to be held by them, together with their other posses sions, in the capacity, which those Rulers engage h J the treaty to acknowledge, of tributaries to* Persia. “ The guarantee, moreover, contains a promise to compel Persia to defend the Rulers of Candahar against attack from any quarter whatever. “ The undersigned is further instructed to state 3338. Uthat a Russian agent of the name of Yicovich, but sometimes calling himself Omar Beg, ami said to be attached to the Staff of the General commanding at Orenberg, was the bearer of letters from the Emperor and Count Simonich to the Ruler of Cabul, copies of which are in the possession of the British Government, and that Count Simonich observed the most perfect silence towards the British Minister at Teheran with respect to the mission of this agent, a reserve which might seem unnecessary, if this agent was merely to deliver the letters of which he was the bearer, and if his mis sion was to have no tendency prejudicial to British interests. “ But the British Government have learned that Count Simonich announced to the Shah of Persia that this Russian agent would counsel the Ruler of Cabul to seek assistance of the Persian Govern ment, to support him in his hostilities with the Ruler of the Punjaub; and the further reports which the British Government have received of the language held by this Russian agent at Candahar and at Cabul can lead to no other conclusion than that he strenuously exerted himself to detach the Rulers of those Afghan States from all connection with England, and to induce them to place their reliance upon Persia in the first instance, and ulti mately upon Russia. “ It further appears from the foregoing state ments that, whereas Russia has of late years in variably professed a desire to concert with Great Britain the course of policy which the two Govern ments should pursue with regard to Persia, so that the identity of their measures in that quarter might be a manifest proof of their friendship and union, Russian agents in Persia and Afghanistan have lately been engaged in measures studiously con cealed from the British Government, and planned in a spirit unfriendly to Great Britain, and for objects hostile to her interests. “ The British Government readily admits that Russia is free to pursue, with respect to the matters in question, whatever course may appear to the Cabinet of St. Petersburg most conducive to the interests of Russia; and Great Britain is too con scious of her own strength, and too sensible of the extent and sufficiency of the means which she possesses to defend her own interests in every quarter of the globe, to regard with any serious uneasiness the transactions to which this note relates. But the British Government considers itself entitled to ask of the Cabinet of St. Petersburg, whether the intentions and the policy of Russia, towards Persia and towards Great Britain, are to be deduced from the declarations of Count Nesselrode and M. Rodofinikin to the Earl of Durham, or from the acts of Count Simonich and M. Yicovich ?” To this the following reply* was sent: — “ The Emperor has read with serious atten tion your Excellency’s despatches, giving an accountof two consecutive interviews, in which Lord Palmerston, speaking of the present situation of affairs in Persia, explained the apprehensions which the expedition of the Shah against Herat has given rise to on the part of the Government of the East India Company. “ O n this occasion, Her Britannic Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Poreign Affairs did not conceal from you, M. le Comte, that public opinion in England ascribes to Russian influence a decisive part in the events now passing in Persia, and attributes to our Cabinet intentions dangerous to the security of the British possessions in Asia. The English Cabinet knows as well as we do the origin of the enmity which subsists between Persia and Herat, the most western part of Af ghanistan. That enmity is of ancient date. The Persian Government thinks itself entitled to exact a tribute from that country, and to claim to exer cise over it a supremacy which, even under the reign of Eutteh Ali Shah, Abbas Meerza, and Ma- hommed Meerza (the present sovereign), appeared in arms to sustain under the very walls of Herat- In despite of these rights, on which the Court of Teheran relies, the Afghans of Herat make con tinual incursions into Persia, reduce to slavery the inhabitants whom they carry off from the eastern provinces of that country, and keep up therein incessantly the elements of disturbance and re volt. “All these considerations put together, establish beyond a doubt that Mahommed Shah, in deter mining to make war against Herat, was completely within his rights as an independent sovereign, and that he has in no respect failed in the obligations imposed upon him by the faith of treaties. “ Strong in our rectitude and in our conscience, we shall never have anything to conceal or to dis semble which we have designed or undertaken. “We are, then, the first frankly to admit to England, that a Russian agent lately proceeded to Cabul for the purpose of commercial inquiry. “The fact of the appearance of this agent, of whom Lord Palmerston has spoken to you, M. le- Comte, is thus completely correct. But the origin and tendency of his mission seem to have been re presented to the English Government with com ments of which we are desirous to demonstrate the exaggeration and the falsehood. “ Eor that purpose, it will be enough for us to say that the mission of M. Witkewitsch [Vicovich] to Cabul was simply occasioned by the mission of an agent, whom Host Mahommed Khan sent to us in 1837, to St. Petersburg, with the intention of forming commercial relations with Russia. “ Great Britain, like Russia, must have at heart the same interest, that of maintaining peace in the centre of Asia, and of avoiding the occurrence of a general conflagration in that vast portion of the globe. But, to prevent that great calamity, it is necessary carefully to maintain the tranquillity of the inter-80 mediate countries which separate the possessions of Russia from those of Great Britain. lo consoli date the tranquillity of those countries, not to excite them against each other by nourishing their mutual animosities, to he contented with competing in industry, but not to engage in a struggle for political influence ; finally, beyond everything else, to respect the independence of the intermediate countries which separate us, such k, in our opinion, the system which the two Cabinets have a common interest invariably to pursue, in order to prevent the possibility of a conflict between two Great Powers, which, that they may remain friends, require not to touch each other, and not to come into collision with each other in the centre of Asia. Lord Palmerston* replied to this communication as follows:— “The proceedings of Russian agents in Asia had for some considerable time been so much at variance w r ith the professed policy of the Russian Government, and so inconsistent with the triendly relations subsisting between Great Britain and Russia, that the British Cabinet deemed it its duty to ascertain, by frank explanations with that of St. Petersburg, whether any change had taken place in the declared policy of the Imperial Government with regard to the* affairs in question, or in its friendly disposition towards Great Britain. “ The despatch from Count Nesselrode, which your Excellency has communicated to me, contains upon these points assurances the most full and complete, and Her Majesty’s Government accept as entirely satisfactory the declarations of the Imperial Cabinet, that it does not harbour any designs hostile to the interests of Great Britain in India; that its own policy with respect to Persia remains un changed, and is the same which in 1834 the two Powers. agreed to adopt ^and which, I must be allowed.to remind your Excellency, the British Government and its agents in Persia have from that time to this undeviatingly pursued) ; and that in future the Russian agents in Persia will unite themselves with those of Great Britain in earnestly dissuading the Shah from engaging again in any expedition similar to that which lie has lately undertaken against Herat. “ If such shall continue to be the policy of Russia, and if her agents in the East shall faithfully obey their instructions, there seems every reason to hope that nothing can hereafter occur in those quarters that can be calculated to disturb the good under standing between the two countries; and I beg to assure your Excellency that it is the most earnest wish of the British Government that this good understanding should be firmly and perpetually maintained.” Einally, Count Nesselrodef replied as follows “The Government of Her Britannic Majesty has received from us the formal assurance that it * Viscount Palmerston to Count Pozzi &lt;ii Borgo, 20th Decemhor 1838. f Count Nesselrode to Count Pozzi xli Borgo, 29th January 1838.From Foreign Office, 11 th July 1865. t Reply, 29th July i 860 . | Note .—The Draft Convention ran as follows:— “ 1. The iwo Powers to declare that they have no intention to extend their terri tories in such a manner that their frontiers would approach each other more nearly than they are at present. If a deplorable necessity should force either of them to change this this resolution, the Power contemplating such extension would make a full and frank exposition to the other of the causes which have enforced this change, and the extent to which the increase of territory is in con templation. “ 2. That both Powers will respect the present state of possession in Central Asia. li 3. That both Powers will respect the independence of the Persian monarchy, will l&gt;e careful not to encroach on the territory of Persia, and will act in concert to support and strengthen the sovereignty of the Shah/’ § Lord Russell to Mr. Lumley, 4th August 1865. 81 in no wise enters into the views of our Cabinet to desire to direct the slightest hostile combination against the security of the English possessions in India; and that, far from that, our policy in respect of Persia has invariably remained the same as it was in 1834, at the time when a perfect under standing was so happily established on this matter between Russia and England. “ In return for this clear and precise declaration, we consider that, on our part, we may rely upon the intention and upon the desire which the British Cabinet has, on its part, expressed, to the effect of replacing the order of things in Persia on its ancient footing, by re-establishing its relations of friendship and good understanding with that country.” No further correspondence took place between the two Governments on Persian affairs, until the question was again raised in 1865 by an incidental allusion on the part of Sir B. Murchison, President of the Geographical Society, to the progress of Russia in Central Asia. Thereupon Lord Russell addressed Sir C. Wood a Despatch,* inviting his opinion as to the ex pediency of entering into diplomatic arrangements with the Cabinet of St. Petersburg, with a view to the adjustment of the basis of an undertaking to he come to by the Governments of Great Britain and Russia, disclaiming any intention to extend their territories in Central Asia. Sir C. Wood *|* replied, that he fully recognized the advantage of such an understanding, being of opinion that much might be done by frank state ments and clear explanations to remove erroneous apprehensions; he did not approve of the first Article of the draft Convention, l but thought that a paper drawn up in the spirit of the last two Articles might be attended with mutual advantage to the two Governments. In answer to Sir C. Wood’s letter, Mr. Layard explained that Lord Russell did not contemplate a formal Convention between the two Governments, hut merely that an exchange of notes should take place; and he added that, having communicated to Baron Brunnow the object of the proposed De spatch to our Ambassador at St. Petersburg, he had stated that Prince Gortchakoff, if invited, would declare the policy of Russia.§ The Despatch ran as follows :— “ There are circumstances in the present situation of the British and Russian Empires which might give rise to anxiety, and Her Majesty’s Govern ment, being fully persuaded of the friendly and pacific sentiments of the Emperor of Russia, are desirous to remove any cause of danger which might threaten the future good understanding of England and Russia. “ Her Majesty’s Government consider it would be useful to this end if the two Powers were to make 3338. Xx- 82 friendly explanations to each other, based on the present state of affairs. “ Her Majesty’s Government are determined to respect the present state of possession in Central Asia. “ Her Majesty’s Government will respect the in dependence of the Persian monarchy, will be careful not to encroach upon the territory of Persia, and will act in such a manner as may best support and strengthen the sovereignty of the Shah. “ If His Majesty the Emperor of Russia will be prepared to make analogous declarations, Her Ma jesty’s Government think that, without the formality of a Convention, an exchange of Notes might take place, which would tend to settle the minds of the inhabitants of Central Asia, and to prevent mis understanding, thereby affording a fresh security for the maintenance of peace between the two Empires. “ You will read this Despatch to Prince Gort- chakoff, and give him a copy of it.” Mr. Lumley, referring to this Despatch (10th August 1865), reported that, after reading it, Prince Gortchakoff expressed his satisfaction at the friendly asrurances on the part of Her Majesty’s Govern ment, whilst confessing that he could not, however, understand Lord Russell’s object in desiring an interchange of relations, nor as a practical man could he see what was to be gained by it. As regards the last part of the declaration, all he had to say was, that he never suspected Her Majesty’s Government of any intention of encroaching upon the territory of the Shah ! Prince Gortchakoff added, that Russia did not seek territorial aggrandisement, but a safe road for her commerce. On this point, Mr. Lumley ob served that, in speaking of Central Asia, Prince Gortchakoff said, “ I can well understand your “ Government, or rather that of India, showing “ some anxiety or curiosity about what is going “ on in that country, though they are better able “ than others to comprehend the necessity; for, “ after all, we are only doing by compulsion that “ which you have always done in India, and what “ you are obliged to do at this moment in Bhootan “ in spite of yourselves. What we really want is a “ safe road.” Mr. Lumley asked His Excellency in what direction. He said, “To Kashgar;” and Mr. Lumley added, “ To China.’’ On the 5th August 1865, Prince Gortchakoff, with some apparent reluctance, communicated to Baron Bruunow the views of the Imperial Government.* The Despatch ran as follows :— “ Our august Master especially reciprocates the desire expressed by Lord Russell to consolidate the good relations which unite us to the Government of Her Britannic Majesty. The desire corresponds * Prince Gortehsikofi to Ilaivn lirunnow, 5th August 18(5f&gt;. '83 so completely with the sentiments of the Emperor as to meet with the entire concurrence of His Imperial Majesty. “ Her Britannic Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State expresses an opinion that a frank and friendly ' explanation of the respective views of the two Go vernments relative to Central Asia would contribute to the above result. His Excellency has accordingly indicated the principles which the Government of Her Majesty Queen Victoria is disposed to adopt in its relations with the States in this part of the world. “ Those which govern the policy of our august Master have already been communicated by your Excellency to Her Britannic Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State. “ You may reiterate to Lord Bussell the assurance that we have in Central Asia but a single interest, viz., tranquillity, the security of our frontiers, the establishment and development of commercial and peaceful relations with our neighbours, of which we shall not reap the sole profit. We do not pursue any other design, but we attach thereto a just importance, and we shall labour with per severance to attain it. “ If Her Britannic Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State expresses a wish to have a copy of this Despatch, you may leave it in his hands.” Lord Bussell felt some disappointment at this reply, and addressed Her Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburg (Eoreign Office Letter, 5th Septem ber 1854) to the effect that,— “ These assurances are satisfactory, but it would have given Her Majesty’s Government still greater confidence if Prince Gortckakoff had replied to the declaration of the views of Her Majesty’s Govern ment by a similar declaration. “ Her Majesty’s Government, however, are willing to accept the explanation of the principles which guide the policy of His Majesty the Emperor of Russia contained in the circular already referred to, and are quite ready to believe that legitimate desires for the extension of commerce and the security of the Bussian frontier, and no wish for territorial aggrandizement, guide the proceedings of the Bussian Government. “ Such an extension of commerce, and the security of the Bussian frentiers, will no doubt tend to the advantage of other nations who carry on trade in Central Asia, and of none more than Great Britain.” Shortly after this date, Sir A. Buchanan reported* that he had had a long conversation with Prince * i 2 th mid j 4th Sep^mbcr 1865. Foreign Gortchakotf on the subject of the recent corre- 1C 11 in * spondence, when the Prince explained that he had considered it “ unnecessary to instruct Baron “ Brunnow to speak of the policy of the Emperor “ with regard to Persia, because Her Majesty’s “ Government could not doubt the desire of His84 “ Imperial Majesty’s Government to promote the “ independence and prosperity of that monarchy.” Prince Gortchakoff, without exactly saying so, seemed, according to Sir A. Buchanan’s impressions, to consider that Lord Russell entertained unjust suspicions of the honesty of Russian policy towards that country, and had expressed this feeling to other persons. Sir A. Buchanan thought it right to add that, in speaking of the friendly conduct of Russia towards that Power, Prince Gortchakoff alluded to the Turcomans as “ pirates, who were not subjects “ of the Shah, and whose depredations against “ Russian commerce it was necessary for the “ Imperial military and naval authorities to repress *• or punish.” Sir A. Buchanan some days afterwards had an interview with the Emperor, when he was pleased to speak to him on the same subject, and stated that Lord Russell might feel assured that “ his “ Government had no ambitious designs in that “ quarter of the world, and that their language on “ the subject was entirely free from reservation or “ arridres pensees ” ; that the Empire was already sufficiently large, and that his sole policy in Central Asia was to encourage commerce and civilization, but that, in following this object, it was of course impossible to prevent collisions occurring from time to time between his troops and the inhabitants of these distant and barbarous countries; that in regard to the policy of Russia towards Persia, Baron Brunnow had been instructed to give Lord Russell satisfactory assurances on the subject, &lt;f though he could not understand, unless it was &lt;f merely to meet Parliamentary inquires, why he “ should desire them.” The question of the integrity of Persia thence forward lay dormant until 1873, when it was again, as said before, brought forward by the Shah. The first attempt of the Persian statesmen to sound the British Government on this question was made by Malcom Khan, who, in Eebruary 1873, imparted to the British Ambassador at Vienna his satisfaction with what had been accomplished for Afghanistan, and expressed a hope that Her Ma jesty’s Government might also be disposed to exert more ostensibly their influence in favour of the integrity and independence of Persia. On the 27th of the same month, Eebruary 1873, the Persian Minister in London called on Lord # Granville, and informed him that the tone which had been taken by the Press on the subject of Central Asia had given rise to much preoccupation in Persia, and he had been instructed to ask whether Persia might be easy on the subject. Lord Gran ville replied that he did not quite understand the bearing of the question, to which the Persian Minister rejoined that the integrity of Persia was as important as that of Afghanistan; the position was nearly the same. He washed to know r whether85 the time was come when the integrity of Persia would be recognized; what the Persian Government desired was that the present good understanding between Russia and England should be taken to come to similar agreement with regard to the boundaries of Persia as in the case of Afghanistan; he was aware of an interchange of assurances between Russia and England in 1834 that neither country would destroy the integrity of the Persian Empire, but he believed his Government was not aware of it. Communications to a similar purport were re ceived from Teheran. Mr. Thomson wrote on the 26th February 1873 to say that the Persian Govern ment had received a telegram from London to the effect that in the correspondence which had recently taken place between the British and Russian Go vernments respecting Central Asia, Russia had declared that she had recognized the integrity of Persia. The Sadr Azim inquired whether Mr. Thomson had received any intelligence to that effect. “ He observed,” continued Mr. Thomson, “ that the Shah and his Ministers would feel grateful to Her Majesty’s Government if they had succeeded in obtaining an assurance of this nature from the Russian Government. It required very little re flection, he said, to enable any Persian to understand that Russia was the natural enemy of Persia, and that England on the contrary, in her own interests, must desire to maintain the independence of this country. He considered that the only chance of safety for Persia was for her to ally herself with England, and seek the friendship and support of Her Majesty’s Government. The policy, therefore, which he had adopted when he came into office, and which he was now earnestly endeavouring to carry out, was in a few words this : to ‘ manager * la Russie,’ and secure the confidence and good will of England. His views and opinions on this subject had been fully explained to the Shah, who approved of them, and although the British Go vernment, he knew, had been brought to regard Persia with distrust, owing to a different policy having been pursued by former Ministers in this country, he hoped to succeed in removing that dis trust from their minds and to gain their confidence and moral support. “ The policy of Her Majesty’s Government, he continued, had always been to strengthen Persia as much as possible and maintain her integrity; and the present appeared to him to be a favourable moment, while the boundary line in Turkistan was being agreed upon, for securing that object by obtaining a formal assurance from the Russian Government that the Persian territory should not be encroached upon. A formal declaration in this sense made by Russia to Her Majesty’s Government would be received with great satisfaction by Persia; but, if it could be so arranged that the assurance given by England should be also formally repeated 3338. Yby Russia, or be officially communicated to other European Powers at the same time, it would offer an additional guarantee, and be still more reassuring to the Persian Government. “ Count Dubsky, the Austro-Hungsrian Minister in Teheran, has assured the Sadr Azim that his Government will endeavour to assist the Persian Government in carrying out this object; and he has also stated to me that Count Andrassy would be disposed to act in concert with Her Majesty’s Government, with a view* to obtain from Russia some guarantee for the maintenance of the integrity of Persia.” •The opportunity, therefore appeared favourable for an effort in behalf of the Shah’s Government. But such a move, if it w*as ever seriously thought of, received a skilful check from M. de Stremounkoff. An official article had appeared in the ‘ Journal de ‘ St. Petersburg ’ referring to the agreement between England and Russia on the subject of the integrity of Persia. M. de Stremounkoff, in the course of a conversation with Lord A. Loftus on the 4th March 1873, mentioned this article, and placed in the Ambassador’s hands a memorandum which he had prepared, and w r hich purported to give an historical analysis of the circumstances leading to the under standing of 1834 between the tw*o Governments in respect to the affairs of Persia. The following is a close translation of the memorandum : — “ Towards the close of 1833 the Shah of Persia, Futteh Ali Shah, entertained the idea of turning his arms against Herat. Informed of this deter mination, the Imperial Government left nothing undone to dissuade the Shah from the enterprise. “ Mr. MacNeill, then English Minister at Teheran, saw in this projected campaign against Herat a con certed plan for extending the influence of Persia in Afghanistan, and for creating a political system which would be in a position to menace the British possessions in India. Seeing that the war did not cease, England attempted to induce the Shah to suspend hostilities by declaring that she would otherwise despatch a fleet to the Persian Gulf and land troops there. Shortly afterwards the island of Karak was, in fact, occupied by the English. Alarmed at this naval demonstration, the Shah con sidered it necessary to make a direct appeal to the Emperor. In the meantime Lord Palmerston, of his own accord, drew the attention of our Ambas sador in London, Count Pozzo di Borgo, to the position of affairs in Persia, and to the apprehension entertained by the East India Company in conse quence of the expedition to Herat. Then follow r ed an exchange of ideas between the two Governments in regard to the integrity of the territory of Persia. No formal agreement on the subject has been signed. Nevertheless the note of Lord Palmerston to Count Pozzo di Borgo, dated 20th December 1838, sufficiently proves that England and Russia were of one mind as to the necessity of maintaining the integrity of the Shah’s possessions.”87 The argument of M. de Stremounkoff is suffi ciently plain. England and Russia being of the same mind in 1838 respecting the necessity of maintaining the integrity of the Shah’s possessions, and those sentiments remaining unaltered, there was no need to raise any question on the subject in 1873. Such, at any rate, was precisely the view adopted by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. On the 21th April 1873 Lord Granville replied to the communication from Teheran of the 26th February 1873 in the following terms :— “ You will state to the Sadr Azim that, without expressing an opinion as to the present bearing of what passed in 1834, Her Majesty’s Government think it would be highly inexpedient to make any observations to Russia which might imply a doubt as to the continued validity of the understanding of that year. Her Majesty’s Government consider that it would not be desirable without special cause, such as does not exist at present, to do anything to show to Russia that her intentions were doubted, and, by doing so, leave her free to consider herself unfettered in regard to her future policy towards Persia. “ Her Majesty’s Government are strengthened in this opinion by the fact that M. de Stremounkoff recently referred, in conversation with Lord A. Loftus, to the understanding of 1834.” Lord Granville’s view r s were more fully expressed when the Shah and his Minister arrived in London. The Sadr Azim, on the 30th June 1873, sent a letter to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in which it was said— “ It has come to our notice through various pub lications that there have passed between England and Russia certain documents (actes') acknowledging the necessity and the natural duty of maintaining the integrity of Persia. “ Such documents possess a weighty interest for the Persian Government, and evince especially the grave solicitude of the two friendly Powers for the independence of Persia. I should, therefore, be very grateful to your Lordship if you would com municate to the Government of His Majesty the Shah all that has passed between England and Russia on tiffs subject.” Lord Granville’s reply of the 2nd July 1873 was as follows :— “ Although no formal treaty or agreement exists by which the two countries mutually agree to re spect the integrity of Persia, yet in the year 1834 an understanding was arrived at between the two Governments on the occasion of the nomination of Mahomed Mirza as successor to the throne of Persia. That understanding was based on the sincere desire of the two Governments to maintain not only the internal tranquillity, but also the inde pendence and integrity of Persia, and in the year 1838 Count Nesselrode adverted to the agreement entered into by the two Governments as still sub sisting in full force, as it was also acknowledged88 to do by Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. “ Her Majesty’s Government, as they recognize for themselves the principles which guided the general policy of Great Britain and Russia in favour of the independence and integrity of Persia in the year 1834, have reason to believe, from information which they have received from Lord Loftus, Her Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburg, that the Russian Government refer with satisfaction to the mutual assurances which were made on the subject in 1834 and 1838. “ Her Majesty’s Government consider that the best mode of confirming both Powers in those sentiments is that Persia, while steadily maintain ing her rights as an independent Power, should studiously fulfil in all respects her treaty engage ments with each, and so ensure the continuance of the friendship which both Powers, even for their own interests, should desire to maintain with her.” The substance of these communications was im parted in conversation by Lord Granville to Count Brunnow, the Russian Ambassador in London, in the following terms, embodied in a Despatch ad dressed bv Lord Granville to Lord A. Loftus, No. 161, of 10th July 1873 “ I also informed Count de Br unnow, as he had broached the subject of the Shah’s visit, that the Persians had inquired as to the nature of the en gagements which subsisted between Great Britain and Russia as to the integrity of the Persian terri tory, and that I had told the Grand Vizier that, although no formal treaty or agreement existed by which the two countries mutually agreed to respect the integrity of Persia, yet that in the year 1834 an understanding was arrived at between the two Governments, on the occasion of the nomination of Mahomed Mirza as successor to the throne of Persia; that that understanding was based on the sincere desire of the two Governments to maintain, not only the internal tranquillity, but also the independence and integrity of Persia; that in the year 1838 Count Nesselrode adverted to the agreement entered into by the two Govern ments as still subsisting in full force, as it was also acknowledged to do by Her Majesty’s Secre tary of State for Foreign Affairs, and that Her Majesty’s Government, as they recognized for themselves the principle which guided the general policy of Great Britain and Russia in favour of the independence and integrity of Persia in the year 1834, had reason to believe, from information which they had received from Lord A. Loftus, Her Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburg, that the Russian Government referred with satisfaction to the mutual assurances which were made on :his subject in 1834 and in 1838; and that Her Ma jesty’s Government considered that the best mode of confirming both Powers in those sentiments was that Persia, while steadily maintaining her rightas an independent Power, should studiously fulfil in all respects her treaty engagements with each, and so ensure the continuance of the friendship which both Powers, even for their own interests, should desire to maintain with her. Count de Erunnow ^pressed satisfaction.” The subject did not, however, drop. The Russian Governor of the Trans-Caspian district, General Lomakin, issued a circular which claimed authority over tribes and territory between the Attrek and Gurgan rivers, which were unquestion- ably Persian. This drew forth a remonstrance from Her Majesty’s Government, the record of which is interesting, as showing the attempts made by the Russian authorities to explain away the understanding of 1834-38. According to M. West- mann’s views, the question was one between Persia and Russia alone, and that in such question, even though ex hypothesi it might affect the in tegrity of Persia, there was no room for a third party to interfere :— “ In fulfilment of your Lordship’s instructions,” wrote Lord A. Loftus,* “ I had the honour of an interview yesterday with M. Westmann, the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs in the absence of Prince Gortsehakoff, when I read to him your Lordship’s Despatch, as also the Despatch from the Government of India which was enclosed therein. “ On terminating their perusal, M. Westmann stated that the incident of General Liamakin’s circular, to which your Lordship had referred, had been a mal entendu which had given rise to a correspondence between the Imperial and Persian Governments, and that the explanations given by the Imperial Government had been perfectly satis factory to the Persian Government. His Excellency admitted that General Lomakin, in lieu of naming the tribes to which he referred by their proper appellation, had generalised them in the terms he used, and he observed that the tribes referred to were in the habit of repairing for a portion of the year into Russian territory. “ The whole circumstances, His Excellency said, had been misrepresented, consequent on an incorrect translation from the original Tartar text of General Lomakin’s circular, but this misrepresentation had been happily and satisfactorily rectified with the Persian Government. “ Having made this statement with regard to the incident referred to, His Excellency then stated that he must express his surprise that an explana tion should have been asked for by Her Majesty’s Government of an incident of so little importance in itself, and which solely concerned Russia and Persia. It was not customary, His Excellency observed, to interfere in the international relations between two independent States, and he could not comprehend in what way the incident referred to could affect Great Britain. “ I replied to His Excellency that he must not 3338. zN&amp;X5 : -^ Wi.-v 1-2 ^ v.v . •'• ' . : ;;:■ ■' v-:VV\c: ;■ : ~• 'S&amp;C:.' - '^-v^k ■ --\ •*- • * l-ii ' 90 forget that Great Britain was, equally with Russia, an Asiatic Power, ruling over an empire of above 200 millions of people, and that it was the duty of the Government of India to watch over and safe guard the interests of that Empire. “ Furthermore, I observed to His Excellency that not many years ago the question of Persia formed the subject of diplomatic discussions and of a friendly understanding between our respective Governments, and I referred to the correspondence which had been exchanged between Lord Palmerston and Count Nesselrode in 1834 and 1838, in which both Governments agreed on the necessity of main taining the integrity of Persia. “ I did not, therefore, comprehend the surprise expressed by His Excellency on the communication I had made. “ M. Westmann replied replied to these observa tions, that the correspondence to which I had alluded referred to the question of the succession to the Persian throne, on which the two Governments had happily agreed, and be did not doubt that under similar circumstances the same understanding would take place. He instanced the friendly offices in which the two Governments were now engaged in regard to the Turko-Persian frontier question ; but in the present instance he repeated that the incident referred to in your Lordship’s Despatch was a question which solely regarded Persia, in which he could not admit the right of a third Power to interfere.” It was not to be supposed that the British Government would allow the understanding of 1834-38 to be interpreted from time to time in various ways so as to best suit the convenience of Russian statesmen. Accordingly, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in a Despatch dated 16th December 1874, instructed Lord A. Loftus to take an early opportunity of pointing out to M. West mann that he had fallen into an error in stating that the understanding come to between England and Russia in 1834 and 1838 respecting the main tenance of the integrity of Persia had reference merely to the question of the succession to the Persian throne, a statement which Lord Derby pro nounced to be “ altogether incorrect.” He said :—* “ I approve the language which your Excellency used to M. Westmann with respect to General Lomakin’s circular, addressed to the Turcomans inhabiting the territory between the Attrek and the Gurgan, as reported in your Despatch, No. 421, of the 17th ultimo. “ I observe, however, that on your reminding M. de Westmann of the understanding come to between England and Russia in 1834 and 1838 respecting the maintenance of the integrity of Persia, His Excellency replied that the correspon dence to which you alluded had reference to the question of the succession to the Persian throne. “ As this statement on the part of M. de TV est- niann is altogether incorrect, and as I observe that To Lord A. Loftus, 16th Decomber 1874.91 your Excallancy did not at the time correct him, I have to instruct you to take an early opportunity of pointing out to His Excellency the error into which he lias fallen, and I have to refer you to the Despatch from this Office, No. 161, of the 10th of July 1873, bearing on the subject.” M. Westmanu recognized the fact that his position was not tenable, or perhaps it was deemed imprudent to throw away so useful an argument as that of the “ understanding,” when the exigencies of the case were not sufficiently pressing to demand such a sacrifice. At any rate, in the conversation reported by the British Ambassador in his Despatch dated 23rd December 1874, M. Westmann com pletely shifted his ground. He said that “ it had “ been nowise his intention to disavow the under- “ standing which was then (in 1834-38) come to “ between the two Governments in respect to the “ maintenance of the integrity of Persia. “His Excellency fully admitted the existence of “ that understanding at the periods alluded to, and “ its validity at the present moment. He main- “ tained, however, that the integrity of the Persian “ territory had not been menaced by the circular of “ General Lomakin, and he further observed that “ it was Persia who was aggrieved, and who was “ entitled to seek an explanation.” M. Westmann added, not of course in the light of recrimination, that when the frontier differences between Persia and Afghanistan had been lately arranged by Great Britain, and a portion of Seistan awarded to Afghanistan, no communication had been made to Russia, though Persian territory was affected by the adjudication. Lord A. Loftus replied that the Seistan award was simply a matter of dis puted frontier, the arbitration of which had been confided to Great Britain by the parties interested in carrying out the arbitration. To which M. West mann rejoined that, although Russia would not have been called upon to participate in the arbitra tion, yet, according to the “ understanding ” to which reference had been made, namely, the main tenance of the integrity of Persia, Her Majesty’s Government, when the arbitration was finally settled, might have communicated to the Imperial Government the changes which had been agreed upon in regard to Persian territory. From the above rejoinder, to which Lord A. Loftus appears to have made no reply, it will be perceived that, in M. Westmanns experienced hands, the “under standing of 1834-38 is useful for attack, as well as for defence. Since this period no further interchange of views between the two Governments, on the subject of the integrity of Persia, has taken place. But it mav be noted, as an evidence of the desire of the British Cabinet not to lose sight of the question, * To Mr. Thomson, No. 525, 21st July that in 1877 Her Majesty’s Minister at Teheran 1877. was authorized* to promise the moral support of Her Majesty’s Government in any protest the Shahmight be disposed to make against the threatened inclusion within Russian borders of Karikala, a place considered to be undoubtedly Persian. This promise on the part of Her Majesty’s Government has been again* repeated, and the Persians have been thereby encouraged to make a new and vigorous protest on the subject, the results of which are not yet definitely known. Persia and Merv. —Mervf was a flourishing city in the ancient province of Marghiana, com prised in the empire of the Parthians. It derives its name of Merv, Mawr, from the Marueaei (a people who inhabited the country) of the ancient Greek Historio-Geographers, having lost that of Antiochia, conferred on it by Antiochus, son of Seleucus Nieator, who converted the site which the Macedonian conqueror judged proper for an Alexandria into a city of considerable dimensions, surrounding it with a rampart of fifteen hundred (short) stadiae.J Mr. Taylour Thomson informs us, that there are, not one, but three different sites of ancient cities by the Murghab. The Natives, Burues says, point to the ruins of Merv-i-Mukan as the city built by the Greeks, but the exact site of the original city founded by Alexander, and improved and expanded by Antiochus, has not been ascertained. Captain Abbott believed that “ several sites had, in turn, “ been occupied and abandoned, each retaining some u vestige of its former fortifications, and these lying “ in a continuous line give an impression of vast- “ ness to the deserted site.” Throughout all Western Turkestan or Turan, Merv goes by the name of Meru, Maru, or Mawr, and the country in which is is situated was styled by the Arabs Mawr-el Nahr or Mawr-beyond the river or trans-riverine, as it is even yet called in Bokhara. It is also called Meru-Rood,§ Meru- Errund, or Merv-Shah-Jehan, 44 as who should say « soul or affection of the Sovereign,” an appellation dating, probably, from the eleventh century, when it was the favourite residence of Alp-Arslan, King of Persia. Merv or Marv-Shah-Jehan was surrounded with stately palaces, groves, and gardens by Alp-Arslan (A.D. 1063—1073) of the Soljukian dynasty of Persia. The tomb of Sunjur Shah or Suntan Sun- jur, Alp-Arslan’s grandson, A.D. 1126—1157, who conquered all the country between the Oxus and Jaxartes, still remains at Merv, and although the few settled residents in Merv are Uzbegs, and the Turkomans are historical foes of Persia, yet the great deeds of the Persian sovereigns of the country are remembered by them and expatiated on, notwithstanding also the facts that Ismael Sefi of Persia, A.D. 1510, defeated Sheibani Khan, the powerful founder of IJzbeg dominion in Central Asia, who drove Sultan Baber from his throne, and that since the year 1787 Merv has been almost * To Mr. Thomson, No. 785, 13th October 1879. f Wote .—This account is taken from an Abstract by Mr. Michell, of the India Office, 4th March 1875.

From the period of its conquest by Shah Ismael, Merv is said to have enjoyed great prosperity, until, after beating hack several Bokbarian armies, it was IL, captured by Shah Murad of Bokhara in T785.* This Uzbeg ruler forcibly transferred the whole of the population, or, as has been stated, 40,000 families, and, in addition to this customary measure of precaution against rebellion, he destroyed the bend or dam of the river Murghab, in order to impoverish the country. In the year 1860, a Persian army, led by Hamza- Mirza, the Governor of Khorassan, occupied the enclosure now called Merv (July 19th), without any opposition from the T4kd Turkomans, but after establishing their camp lower down the Murghab river, where they laid siege to another Turkoman stronghold, the Persians were disastrously beaten, and retreated through a country inundated by the Turkomans, to Merv, and thence back again to Khorassan, losing nearly all their munitions of war, including o0 pieces of ordnance (23rd October) one of which was subsequently recovered in a Persian foray from Sarakhs. Sir Henry Ra wlinson says, in a recent Memoran dum ou the Merv and T6k4 Turkomans :— “ Merv, although at present a mere ruin, and un- “ inhabited during nine months of the year, is of t( mucli political importance, both from its strategic position and from its great natural advantages. Situated at the point wliere the high road from “ Persia to Bokhara crosses the road from Khiva ‘ to Herat, and possessing an unlimited supply of “ water, it will probably take a leading place in the “ future history of the East. At any rate, if Merv “ were garrisoned by the Russian troops, and order “ were established in the surrounding country, the “ city would rapidly recover its old condition of “ prosperity, and would completely overawe Herat “ and Afghan Turkestan.” The T&lt;5k&lt;$s, Sir Henry further observes, can bring 40,000 horsemen into the field. Abbott says that “ the position of Merv is so im- “ portant that it never will be long abandoned, and might, with judicious care, rapidly rise from its &lt;k dust into wealth and consequence.” And Shakes- pear was told at Merv by the more intelligent among the Asiatics, “ Ho you think we are such &lt;c dolts as not to perceive what will be the end of all this ? You and the Russians will meet “ and shake hands, and we shall be crushed in the “ operation.” Colonel Valentine Baker, Lieutenant Gill, and Major St. John bear testimony to the facility with which Merv can be approached by an army from the Attrek or the Oxus. The regions of the Atrek and Merv were practi- 'cally a terra incognita to the majority of Englishmen 3338. A a94 some years ago. The landing of a Russian force at Krasnovodsk in 1869, and the subsequent attack on the Western Turkomans in violation of the reputed northern boundaries of Persia, first gave fife to a question which had practically lain dormant for half a century. The history of Russian encroach ment on the south-east coast of the Caspian Sea is best understood, perhaps, by a simple record of dates. In 1842 the Russians, with the avowed object of assisting the Persians against the Turkomans, oc cupied the island of Ashurada, near Asterabad, to the south of the River Gurgan, and erected buildings on the island. In 1845 they increased these buildings, when the Persians remonstrated against their doing so. It became evident that the Russians intended to form a military establishment at Ashurada, their object being, it was believed, to entice the Turko mans towards the Russian Government, and to detacli them from Persia. They then attempted to establish themselves in the mainland opposite Ashurada, asking the Persians to allow them to build a hospital there and to surround the building and storehouses with a wall; but the Persians, on being cautioned by the British Minister that such a building would thus be in reality a fortress, with held their consent. In 1849 the British Government informed the Russian Government that they thought the time had arrived for restoring Ashurada to the Persians. But it has never been restored to this day. In 1854 the Persians were about to repair their fortifications at Enzolee near Resht and at Gez near Asterabad; but the Russians remonstrated, and they consequently deferred doing so, although the British Government urged the Persian Government to put Asterabad and Enzelee in a state of defence. At this time the Russian Chargd d’Affaires at Teheran admitted that Ashurada belonged to Persia. In 1809 the Russians took possession of Kizil- Su, or Krasnovodsk, in Balkan Bay, with the avowed object of opening a route to Khiva and Turkestan in the interests of commerce. The Per sians remonstrated and claimed the coast as be longing to them, but the Russian Minister at Teheran asserted that Persia had no territorial rights on the shore of the Caspian Sea so far north; and on the 13th December following, an agreement was come to between Russia and Persia that the Atrek should form the boundary between their respective States, but that no Russian forts should be erected on that river. In 1872 the Russians invaded the Akhal Turko man country, and captured Kizil-Arvat, Bami, and Boormah; they also temporarily occupied Kareekala, a place which is Persian, and the interference with which by the Russian authorities the Shah is now strenuously disputing. In 1873 the Russians erected a fort to the north Note .—For fuller details see Herslet’s Memorandum, 16th August 1877. Henvey’s and Plowden’s “ Central Asia,” 1873—-78, Sir Henry Rawlinson’s “ England and Russia in the East,” 1875.95 Note. —So recently as October 1877 the mission agent at Asterabad reported that the Russians informed the Jafferbai Turko man’s inhabiting the districts between the Atrek and Gurgan that their territory be longed to Russia, and that lists of those occupying the tract should be furnished. The Jafferbai replied that their territory was Persian, and they in consequence refused to give the required lists. Note .—Captain Napier states that the negotiations between the Tekke Turko mans, and Persia were quite sincere on the part of the tribes, and originated in the fear of the Turkoman of the advances of Russia. of the Atrek River, near its mouth, called Chikish- lar; they also crossed the Atrek and attacked the Yemoot Turkomans ; but on the Persians protesting, the Russians said they fully recognized “ the Atrek “ as the frontier between Russia and Persiaa doubt was raised, however, as to whether the agree ment of 1869 had reference to that part of the river which empties itself into the Caspian Sea, or to the river along its whole extent. When the discussion on this latter point first arose, the Russian Asiatic Society issued a new edition of their map of Central Asia, with the colouring altered, so as to show the boundary between Russia and Persia as extending for a distance of about forty or fifty miles up the river Atrek. In 1874 the Russians annexed a large tract of territory on the south-east coast of the Caspian between Khiva and the Atrek, forming a trans- Caspian military district; and at the same time General Lomakin issued a proclamation claiming jurisdiction over the districts to the south of the Atrek, and lying between that river and the Gurgan, which territory was unquestionably Persian, But, notwithstanding these proceedings of Russia at Ashurada, Krasnovodsk, Chikishlar, Bayat-Hadji, Kareekala, and elsewhere, she assured the British Government in 1874, as stated in another part of this Note, that she considered the agreement entered into with the British Government in 1834 and con firmed in 1838, to maintain the integrity of Persia, to be still binding. In the Russian map already alluded to the line of the Persian frontier—as if with a view to future events in these regions—is laid down as extending from Hassan Koolee, at the mouth of the Atrek, along the line of that river to the north of Boojnord and south of Deragez, which is excluded from the Persian territory, although it is under the direct rule and authority of the Shah. Leragez is, in fact, placed about 12 miles outside of the Persian boundary, whilst Kelat-i-Nadir, to the north of Meshed, is placed about ten miles within the Persian boundary line. Serakhs, which has a Persian gar rison of 500 men and four guns, is also excluded from Persia by 12 miles, and the Persian frontier is then taken south, in a straight line to within about 25 miles of Herat. The frontier of Afghanistan is then carried due east for 80 miles, after which it passes to the north and east until it reaches the Oxus at Khojeh Saleh. The Russians, consequently, once at Merv, will be in occupation of all the country which, accord ing to their maps, is neither Persian nor Afghan territory, thus bringing them to within some 25 miles of the city of Herat and 20 miles of the town of Maimena. Nur Yerdee, the acknowledged leader of the Akhals, visited Teheran, in October 1876, for the purpose of tendering the allegiance of the tribe toPersia, and suitable terms to this end were agreed to on both sides, viz.,— (1.) The construction of a fortress in the Akhal country under the Persian Government. (2.) The stationing of an Akhal contingent at Meshed under the Persian Governor of Khorassan. (3.) Cessation of raids and protection of the tribe by Persia against Russian aggression. The agreement was duly signed and sealed at Teheran,* but the misbehaviour of the Persian frontier authorities, almost immediately afterwards, in attacking the tribe without reason, completely alienated them; Nur Verdee no longer allowed the tribe to acknowledge allegiance to Persia, and the Persian Foreign Minister was reportedf to declare, a year ago, that the Shah had no desire to have any further dealings with them, preferring the Russians to the Akhals as neighbours. Towards the end of 1876, overtures of allegiance to Persia were also made by the Tekke Turko mans, under Kooshed Khan, but his terms were not approved, and his proposals were coldly received. The negotiations, therefore, remained in abeyance until 1877, when hearing of those newly set on foot by the Akhals, they resolved to send a depu tation to Teheran, offering their allegiance on similar terms. The death of the chief, Kooshed Khan, in September 1877, and the succession of his son, Baba Khan, probably facilitated matters in this respect. The deputation reached TeheranJ in November 1877. The party consisted of 35 Chiefs, and an arrangement was arrived at as follows:— 1. The Merv Turkomans declared their allegiance to Persia. 2. They engaged that raids by them on that country should entirely cease. 3. That the Persian flag should be hoisted at Merv. 4. That a Persian agent should reside at Merv on the part of the Shah. 5. That 100 hostages (men of position from the four divisions of the tribe) should reside at Meshed, but without their families. 6. That a body of 1,000 horsemen should be sent to Meshed (about 250 from each division of the tribe) to be employed in the service of the Persian Government. These horsemen to provide their own horses and arms &gt; and to be under the command of their own Chiefs, but to be paid by the Persian Government, for employment in any part of Persia where their services are required. The Persian Government on their side agreed to the following points :— 1. To recognize the Merv Turkomans as Persian subjects, and to promise them protection and favourable treatment. • Mr. Taylor Thomson to Earl of Derby, 10th January and 22nd March 1877, and 2nd and 31st October 1877. t Mr. R.

The Persian Hissam-es-Sultaneh, formerly Governor General of Khorassan, has re commended that Abul Hassan Khan, the son of the Chief of Koochan, should be sent to Merv on the part of the Shah. ' The Merv Chiefs,”* wrote Mr. R. Thomson in 1878, “ believe that the Akhal portion of their tribe will eventually withdraw from the Akhal country and join them at Merv. They consider that it would be a gain for the whole tribe were they to do so, because the encampments they occupy at present along the line of the Atak are straggling, and some of them ill-supplied with water, and they are divided from each other by tracts of desert which prevents them from rallying in time to support any portion of the tribe that may be suddenly attacked; whereas at Merv each camp has the advantage of an equally abundant supply of water with all the others and an ample extent of fertile land, and all the tribes occupy a compact position on the Moorghab, which is very favourable for defence. Their lands at Merv are fully sufficient to accommodate more than double the number of those now occupying them. ,f The Tekke Chiefs,” added Mr. Taylour Thomson, “ are under the belief that they have nothing to expect from England, owing to the remoteness of her position. They would have preferred the Afghans to the Persians, and they would have been disposed to go over to them if Yacoob Khan had been in power, or if he had been in favour with his father the Ameer, because they had confidence in him.” In considering the possibility of placing Merv under Persia, Lord Lytton’s* Government wrote in 1877,— “ We are decidedly of opinion that, in the anxious and urgent circumstances to which your Lordship’s attention is here invited, no arrangement with Persia will be of practical benefit to this Empire, if it does not include the establishment of British agents with suitable escorts at Meshed or Sarakhs, and free access to Merv, through Persian territory. 3338. B b98 But, unless material guarantees are previously, or simultaneously, taken by Her Majesty’s Govern ment to prevent the policy of Persia in these regions from falling completely under the control of Russian influence, any measure likely to render Merv more dependent on that country would, instead of being beneficial to Indian interests, only increase the embarrassments and dangers of our present situa tion.” Meanwhile the Russian expedition into the Akhal country, to which the Government of India referred in this letter, failed. But the subsequent termination of the war with Turkey in the spring of 1878 gave a fresh impetus to Russian activity in the Turkoman country, while the Russian press was filled with projects, all having for their object an advance towards India. Pour Russian expeditionary columns, aggregating about 20,000 men, were forthwith organized and despatched towards the Oxus and Afghanistan with sealed orders ; and in contravention of all Russian declarations to the contrary General Stoletoff, attended by a large escort, reached Cabul in July 1878, on a special mission from the Gzar to the Ameer Shere Ali. Writing on the subject of Merv at this period, the Russian press commented as follows :— The “ Russki Mir,” No. 334, 6th (18th) Decem ber, observed that “ Merv is not a position of any “ strategical value, and that if there was any talk “ of its occupation it was in view of a Russian “ advance towards Afghanistan, but to talk of the ft occupation of that robbers’ nest as a means for “ the strengthening of Russian prestige in Central “ Asia is sheer folly.' The “ Novoye Vremia,” No. 998, 7th (19th) December, however, observed that while the occu pation of Merv was not of immediate consequence, it was necessary that Russia should eventually effect it, otherwise Russia would not have that “ scientific frontier ” which Lord Beaconsfield has said is of such great advantage; independent of this, Merv is a valuable post on the way to India. The “St. Petersburg Gazette,”* proceeded to point out the necessity of strengthening the Russian position on the Oxus, which is calculated to serve as a basis of Russian operations in the event of an English invasion of Kashgar, Bokhara, and Turkestan, and for this purpose it was, in the first place, necessary to occupy Merv. It concluded as follows:— “ And now a word or two about Persia. Here we already feel the preponderance of English influence. It is not to be doubted that so soon as there shall no longer be an Afghanistan hostile to England between her Indian possessions and Persia, the Shah will pause to consider into whose embraces he should throw himself. It would not be amiss to cake advantage of the favourable moment to show the Shah how much easier it is * No. 349, 19th (31st) December 1878, No. 4, MichelPs Abstract.99 • Captain Napier’s Note on ^Russian Operations in Akhal, 1st May 1879. for him to entangle himself in the British web which is stretched over nearly the whole of A8ia. ,, It is a mistaken notion that the most convenient route to Merv for Russian troops lies through the oasis of the Tekes Merv is considerably nearer to the Oxus than to the Caspian, and is in an equal measure separated by a sandy waste from the T6k6 lands as from the Oxus. From the Caspian Russian troops would have to march some hundreds of versts through the narrow belt of verdant Teke country, having no secure communications, and after passing this oasis they would be obliged to enter the arid desert between the Tajik and the Murghab, where there are no wells. From Chardjui, or rather from Hadji-Kunduz, there is a road to Merv, abundantly supplied w r ith water, with wells every ten or even five versts ; the villages around Chardjui have large stores of grain. If we entertained any serious design against Merv, we should certainly commence by establishing &amp;'point d y appui&amp;i Chardjui. Commenting on the active operations, at this time, of General Lazaref in the Akhal country, Captain Napier gave his opinion last year in the following sense.* He said,— “ The existing transport on the Caspian consists of 20 line steamers, of which 17 are now afloat, four private trading steamers, and eight war sloops, all of an average carrying capacity of 350 men. “ A force of 20,000 men might, by these existing means, be landed at Chikishlar in three months. “ If Persia should be found willing to give sup plies freely, a force of 10,000 men might be placed within reach of Herat in about six months. If she were forced to maintain an attitude of neutrality, and the sale of grain were thus restricted, from nine to twelve months would, at least, be required. The ultimate maintenance of an occupying force would, beyond its cost, offer no difficulty, for the northern districts of Khorassan alone produce enough to feed a force of 20,000 to 25,000 men, in ordinary years. “ Almost a prime necessity of such a movement would be an acquisition of Gez, and any deter mined efforts to obtain it may be taken as an evidence of wide aggressive intentions. “ I would judge, from the present state of Lazaref’s preparations, that the advance of a small force, having Geuk Tapa or Ishkabad as its objective, could not take place before the end of June, and the advance of the first detachments of a large column before end of September. “ The snowfall in the Atak and on the Kuren Dagh being ordinarily very light, winter would not necessarily interfere with the movement. “ Whether the annexation of the Atak be made slowly or quickly seems to me, however, in view of ultimate results nearly immaterial. “ Sooner or later Russia will be found in pos session of a line of communication that will place Herat practically in her hands, for the facilities it100 offers will enable her always to outnumber us there, and will give her, in fact, as regards the north of Afghanistan, the superiority that we now have as regards the south.” Ueferring to the . general question of a Russian advance into the Akhal country, and the feeling of the Shah in regard to it, Mr. Ronald Thomson wrote* a year ago that although Persia was, no * Mr. R. Thomson, No. 39, of 22nd Feb- doubt, anxious for an offensive and defensive ruary 1879. alliance with England, he could hardly advise that course. Unless, indeed, we were prepared to stipulate that Persia should put forward her claim to Akhal as an integral portion of her dominions, and were determined at the same time to support her in asserting that right by force of arms if necessary, an important object of that alliance, that of checking Russia’s advance on Herat, would not be obtained. Mr. Ronald Thomson,! in the course of his f No. 92, of Htb April 1879. communications at this period with Her Majesty's Government, expressed his opinion that, failing (1) the possibility of placing Merv in the position of a dependency on Herat over which we should exercise a paramount and permanent influence, or (2) the alternative of making Merv a dependency on Afghanistan, that State being subject exclu sively to our policy, we might possibly at this moment effect an arrangement by direct negotia tions with Russia, on the base of our consenting not to occupy Herat on condition of her not occu pying Merv or the Akhal country. If an arrange ment of this nature could be effected, our presence in Afghanistan, the doubtfulness existing as to our intentions, and the anxiety felt by Russia as to their scope, might afford an opportunity for its accomplishment which would never arise again. Under such an arrangement, both Powers might either recognize the independence of Merv or its dependence on Persia; the latter alternative would be, at all events, better than its direct occupation by Russia. By facilitating its undisturbed pos session by Persia, we should, in Mr. Thomson’s opinion, put that Power to a certain extent under an obligation to us, whilst at the same time we should earn the gratitude of the Turkomans for having intervened to preserve them from the dominion of Russia. The great importance of Merv to the Russians was now generally admitted, and it was of proportionate importance to England that Russia should not gain possession of that terri tory, an eventually certain to occur unless we took measures to prevent it. The occupation of Akhal, although perhaps of less importance, would secure to Russia a very advantageous base of opera tions ; the district of Kelat (a strong natural fortress, which might be rendered impregnable) would be open to her, and it was a significant fact that Sarakhs and Deregez, although governed by Persian Governors and garrisoned by Persian soldiers, had been in recent Russian maps both placed outside the Persian frontier. In point of101 * Marquis of Salisbury to Mr. Plunket 16th May 1879.

If we were able to keep possession of Can ola har the danger would be less threatening, but if we did not it would become imminent. _In a conversation which Count Schouvaloff had with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs * he gave assurances that the sole object of Russian movements on the Caspian were to effect a land communication by means of fortified posts between Krasnovodsk and Chikishlar. Lord Salisbury in- lormed him that there were two points of view trom which any expedition from the shores of the Caspian might meet with objections on the part of England. “ Her Majesty’s Government,” he said, Tr d ™ ke exce P tion to any operations by which Merv ' v y as menaced,” and would “ object to any encroachments upon Persian territory.” . le pty&gt; Count Schouvaloff said there was no intention of menacing Merv or advancing to its neighbourhood in fact, the farthest point contem plated would be 250 kilometres (160 miles) from Merv. With reference to Persia, Russia had so S -Sh?* an - ^ n ^ ercs ^ m maintaining good relations with Persia, that Her Majesty’s Government might rest assured that no infringement of Persian ri°-hts was probable. a ™ In mf tele o ram t received some days afterwards, Mr. Ihomson reports having learnt that the Shah had lately said that Persia had been asleep with reference to Russian designs on her frontier; that hei time was sure to come, and that some measures should be taken in self-defence. The Koochan Chief had been instructed to assure the Akhal chiefs of the good will of Persia, counselling active resistance and deprecating submission; 20,000 tomans were ready for distribution among the tribes, as an earnest of Persian sympathy. It was in con templation also, Mr. Thomson believed, to address the Russian Legation a further Note, stating “ that “ Merv had always been claimed by Persia; that, ‘‘ some years ago, whilst asserting this right, she had lost an army, and undergone a disaster which “ llad not y et been wiped out, and that she could “ not, under these circumstances, forego her claim “ to that territory.” mother telegraphic despatch, dated 23rd June 1870, Mr. Ronald Thomson reports that the Russian Minister at Pehcran had, in a communica tion with the Persian Foreign Minister, used intimi dating language, saying that, “ whatever Persian ‘‘ act 1011 might be, the expedition would be carried kC out, but if that action was unfriendly, she would “ repent it.” On the 9th of July,J the Persian Minister a^ain assured Mr. Thomson that no secret understanding of any kind existed between Persia and Russia as to Mery, or the advance of the Russians in that direction; would Her Majesty’s Government, he 3338. c c102 added, admit Persia’s claim to Mery,* iii which case a protest would be made by him to the -Russian Minister claiming it, and protesting against Russian interference with it as tantamount to an aggression on an integral portion of Persian territory ; the Shah had authorized the despatch of an agent to renew negotiations with the Merv Chiefs for their allegiance. Lord Salisbury was disposed to authorize Mr. Thomson to inform the Persian Government that Her Majesty’s Government would recognize the title of Persia to Merv on the receipt of a written assurance that they would never consent to the occupation of that place by any other Power. A reference on the subject was made to India,f and a reply received from the Viceroy approving generally of the proposal as the best arrangement immediately available. The Viceroy believed, how ever that the Ameer Yakoob Khan would dislike the arrangement, but that, if the alternative lay between a Russian and Persian occupation of Merv, the Ameer would doubtless prefer the latter. The difficulties connected with the recognition of Persian sovereignty over Merv, whilst the British Envoy was negotiating terms of peace at Gundamuk with Yakoob Khan, caused the postponement of any definite communication to the Persian Government on the subject, and the question has since remained in abeyance. Continuation of the Reign of Nusser-ud- deen. —The treaty of 1857 placed the relations between Persia and England on an entirely new footing. By it, all the earlier treaties were prac tically cancelled, except the convention of 1851 for the suppression of slavery in the Persian Gulf, which by the 13th Article was renewed till 1872, and for such time afterwards as neither of the con tracting parties by a formal declaration annul it. The Persian authorities^; deprived of any further right of interference in Herat, turned their attention to Khelat. Pounding her pretensions to dominion in Beluehistan on the conquests of former dynasties, Persia gradually advanced beyond the frontier which marked her possessions early in the present century, and justified her action by the necessity of repressing the border Beluchis who were in 'the habit of organizing marauding expe ditions into the neighbouring province of Kirman. In this way the district of Bumpore fell into the hands of the Persians in 1811, and nine years later, after the unsuccessful revolt of its Chief, was permanently occupied by them. This step was followed by a series of aggressions by Persia on the Kedj-Mekran portion of Khelat which attracted the serious attention of the Indian Government, result ing finally in 1876 in the definition of a boundary between Persia and Khclat by Sir P. Goldsmid’s Commission, which confirmed to the Shah a large * There is some idea abroad that Afghan istan has some claim to Merv. She has none. She is bound not to go beyond the boundaries fixed in 1873. In years gone by, however, botli Yakoob Khan and his father have been on very friendly relations with the Turkomans. {See Captain Napier’s Note on Merv, 22nd February 1875.) In the Despatch, No. 21, 2nd July 1877, the Governor of India wrote :— “ Were our relations with Afghanistan on a more satisfactory footing, the most natural and most efficient form which such action could assume would be arrangements with the Ameer authorizing him to enter into friendly relations Avith the Tekke Turkomans, and ptomising him our support in protecting them from Russian aggression if they choose to come under his rule. The Merv Tckkes have for some time past courted the Afghan alliance, guided by a firm belief in the dependence of the latter country on England, which causes them to rely much on the aid they may obtain from it.” f Telegram to Viceroy, 14th July 1879.

Note. —As no events of any importance have occurred in Persia since 1857, apart from those already narrated in connection with Herat and Seistan, this section will principally contain reference to recent opinions of the Indian Government us to Persian affairs, and to the visit of the Shah in 1873 to Europe. J Aitchison's Treaties, Yol. VI.103 portion of tlie tcnltory already occupied by Persian troops, and was accepted, although somewhat grudgingly, by both the Persian and Khelat Go vernments. The Shah’s ambition to extend Persian influence led him at this time to lay claim to the island of Bahrein. It is beyond the object of this Note to treat this particular question in any de tail, but as our position in the Persian Gulf is one of considerable interest, it may not be out of place to quote, from a large mass of correspondence on the subject, the following extract from a letter addressed by Lord Mayo’s Government to the Home authorities, referring to Gulf matters. * From India Secret, No. 18, of 22nd They said :—* February 1870. « p n 1801 a perpetual * treaty of peace and friend ship 5 was concluded with Mahomed bin Khalifa, in which the enga gements entered into in 1820 were declared to be valid and in force, and the Chief, as * independent ruler of Bahrein,’ bound himself to abstain from prosecuting war, piracy, and slavery sea, so long as he received the support of the British Government in maintaining the security of his own territories against similar aggressions on the part of neighbouring tribes, and the British Government on their part engaged to take the necessary steps to obtain reparation for injuries inflicted by sea upon Bahrein or its dependencies. Whilst the treaty was under consideration. Sir Henry Rawlinson, the Minister at Teheran, had, f Proceedinga, March 1869, No. 119. i n a ‘letter to the Resident in the Persian Gulf,f expressed his opinion, with reference to a demand of the Shah for the transfer of the island to himself, that, 4 under no possible circumstances,’ can the British Government be expected to concur in the proposed transfer of the sovereignty of Bahrein to the Persian crown, since we have con tracted engagements with the Arab Sheikhs of the island as independent Chiefs, and since the main tenance of their independence is indispensable to the successful working of those plans of maritime police in the Persian Gulf which we have been at so much-pains and expense to establish. “ Prom the year 1820, in which these mutual obligations were first incurred, the British Govern ment has in all respects regarded and dealt with Bahrein as an independent State. . . . “ The Persian Government, we may remark, are at the present moment powerless to stop dis turbance at sea. They have no navy, and, even if they were in a position to purchase vessels of w’ar, we could not surrender to them the protec torate of the Gulf without the certainty of hostilities, not only with Muscat and the Arab Chiefs of the littoral who would not tolerate the pretensions of Persia, but also with the Wahabees, and probably even with Turkey, who could, with equal show of reason, put forward obsolete claims to supremacy, which our position as guardians of the peace of the Gulf alone prevents her from reviving. The obligations, moreover, which -we have contracted with the Arab Chiefs to watch104 over the peace of the Gulf, to put down aggression by sea, and to take all necessary steps for the reparation of injuries inflicted on them, are such as we cannot abnegate. The only security for peace and the safety of trade in these waters lies in our preserving that position which, with the consent of the turbulent tribes, we somewhat re luctantly took up, which, for more than half a century, we have, not without difficulty and at considerable cost, maintained ; and which Persia, with her feeble resources and the scanty respect paid to her by the Arab Chiefs of the littoral, could never assume. . . . “ Apart from the positive engagements which we have contracted with the Arab Chiefs, and from which it is neither possible nor desirable that we should recede, the present is not a time when we can encourage the revival of old and unfounded claims, such as those which Persia now puts forward. During the years of peace that have followed the establishment of our supremacy in the Persian Gulf, trade has enormously increased, and the predatory Arabs have embarked* in peaceful and mercantile pursuits, on the faith of the security which our protectorate affords. British steamers now ply weekly from one end of the Gulf to the other, and our subjects have embarked large capital in the pearl fisheries on the coast, and in the commerce of Mesopotamia, Persia, and Arabia. Every day the importance of the Gulf as a com mercial highway between Europe and the East is increasing. Even if the political engagements which we have contracted admitted of such a course, and Persia were possessed of an adequate naval force, it would be almost impossible to commit to her the guardianship of these vast and varied interests. Any indication on our part even of a desire to do so would probably be followed by the decline of trade, the outbreak of hostilities, piracy, and plunder, and a return to the lawlessness which during the last half century we have so successfully restrained.” In another of their communications written in the same year* Lord Mayo’s Government said * To Secretary of State, No. 28, Secret, “ We have already, in our Despatch of 22nd 20tl1 Ma y ^70, Persian Gulf. February, so fully explained our position and policy in the Persian Gulf that we have little or nothing to add. We can only repeat that our protectorate in the Gulf is a matter of obligation rather than of right; that we have pledged ourselves to the Arab Chiefs who are parties to the maritime peace to watch over the peace of the Gulf, to put down aggressions by sea, and to take all necessary steps for the re paration of injuries inflicted on them; and that from those obligations we cannot in good faith recede. Persia has not the means, even if she had the will, to undertake the duty of protecting the peace of the Gulf. She has no naval force. Her interests, as the present correspondence so well illustrates, are antagonistic not only to those of the105 petty Arab Chiefs, but to those of the other great Powers whose dominions extend to the shores of the Gulf and the neighbouring seas, and it is our deliberate opinion that even were we prepared to abandon engagements to the performance of which British faith is pledged, our withdrawal from our present position would most probably be followed not only by war, but by a return to that state of piracy and anarchy against which our long course of action in the Gulf has been so successfully directed. “We cannot too strongly impress upon Her Majesty’s Government that there is no middle course between maintaining the present state of tilings and an absolute abandonment of it, and a withdrawal from the protectorate of the Gulf at the expense of our own good name, and all the benefits that have flowed from our policy for the last half century. The Arab Chiefs have no confidence in Persia, and we cannot consent to be associated with Persia in a duty which the Chiefs have committed to our hands alone, or to be entangled in all the complications which concurrent action or jurisdic tion with her would bring about. If we are no longer prepared to continue the performance of the task we have undertaken, we must withdraw alto gether ; but the consequences of such a step would be so disastrous not only to our national honour, but to the peace of the Gulf, to the prosperity of the tribes inhabiting the littoral, and to the lives and property of our subjects who, during the peace of the last fifty years, have settled on the shores and embarked enormous capital in the pearl fisheries and the trade with the mainland, that we cannot contemplate this course as one the consideration of which Her Majesty’s Government could for a moment entertain. “ In urging an adherance to the ancient and well-tried policy of England in the Gulf, we believe we are suggesting the course which is best for the security of the Persian Empire. We are fully sensible how important it is for the maintenance of the peace of Asia that His Majesty the Shah should be secured in all the power and dignity which he now possesses. We are of opinion that much dis trust of Persia has lately been created among the tribes and nations on her frontier by the tendency she has shown to extend her borders, and to add to her territories. It is not for her interest that the policy should be continued. We believe that, in the exercise of British influence in the Gulf and elsewhere, the Government of the Shah will find one of its strongest safeguards. And we trust that such friendly representations may be made to the Court of Teheran as may induce His Majesty the Shah to come to the conclusion that, in adhering to our ancient policy, we are taking that course which is best calculated to promote the security of his throne, and the permanent interests of his empire.” Remarking shortly afterwards on a paper written 3338. D d106 in 1871 by Mr. Eastwick, with observations thereon by Sir H. Rawlinson* and others (referring chiefly to the advantage of supplying Officers and Ser geants to discipline the Native troops), Lord Mayo’s Government wrote:—+ “ Adverting next to the remarks of Mr. Eastwick on our present relations with Persia, we beg to state that nothing that has been brought officially to our notice leads us to believe that the present state of feeling in Persia is that which is described by Mr. Eastwick. We are not aware that there is any information, in the possession either of the Secretary of State or the Government of India, that goes to show that a sense of his inability to cope with us alone prevents the Shah from coming to an open rupture with our Government. We never heard that he was aggrieved by the support given to the ruler of Cabul, which we suppose has reference to the twelve lacs of rupees which were given to Shere Ali by Lord Lawrence. We have never discouraged Persian pretensions if they are confined to holding a portion of Seistan. . . . “ An effort to detach Herat partially or wholly from Cabul, and the exercise of influence in favour of the dismemberment of Afghanistan, would be so gross an act of treachery and impolicy on our part as regards the ruler of Cabul that it is hardly worth while to discuss it. “ W~e appreciate to the fullest extent the im portance of the establishment of the most friendly relations and a firm alliance with Persia, and in no wise hold the opinion that our true policy is to await an invasion of India within our frontiers, and leave Persia to her fate. “ W'e consider it to be of the highest importance that the independence and nationality of Persia should be maintained and her power strengthened. We do not, however, consider that this can be effected by adopting a policy such as is advocated by Mr. Eastwick. “ In our opinion, nothing could be more fatal than that English influence should induce the Shah to make a movement northwards, and so bring himself into collision with Russia. We cannot too strongly express our concurrence with Sir Henry Rawlinson upon this point, and declare our opinion that it would be almost a crime upon our part, for the mere purpose of obtaining a temporary ascendancy in Persian politics, to urge her to so perilous a course as any attempt to extend her dominions either in a north-westerly direction, or by encroach ments upon Afghanistan or its feudatory tribes. Any extension of territory would be to Persia dan gerous in the extreme. It is, therefore, with peculiar satisfaction that w r e look forward to the definition of her eastern boundaries, and trust that, before next April, a line will be drawn from Lash Jowein to the sea at Gwadur, which will form the acknowledged frontier of the empire of the Shah. “ Again we are convinced that the very worst enemy of Persia could not wish her a greater mis- * Note .—These papers are too lengthy to quote here.

Note .—Sir Henry Rawlinson’s opinion, here referred to, was based on the fact that any encouragement given to Persia to annex Merv, to encroach on Afghanistan and Khelat, and to attack Bahrein, &amp;c., would have resulted at that time in embroiling her with Turkomans, Afghans, Beluchis, and Arabs, involving her in general war. The course of events since 1871 has, of course, made a change in the position of Persia in reference to these events.107 * For narrative of visit, see Colonel Burne’s Memorandum in Appendix VI. t Note .—Sultan Murad Mirza, uncle of the Shah, is better known as the Hissam-u- Sultanat. lie was Governor of Khorassan in 1869—72, and made himself both popular and feared by them. He alone of all Persian statesmen appears to have accurately appre ciated the full importance to Persia of Russia’s movements on the Aral and Caspian, and to have gaged truly the value of the opportunities of extending Persian influence and consolidating her northern border. It was clearly the policy of Persia, at the time that the Russian preparations for the occupation of Khiva were disturbing the tranquillity of the whole of the Khivan steppes and of Khorassan, to take advantage of the position she commanded as a neutral to secure, if possible, by gentle measures, the allegiance of the independent tribes of her border. The Hissam-u-Sultanat’s efforts in this direction were honest and well devised, but failed, through the force of adverse cir cumstances ; his tenure of office wa« too short, and he lacked the cordial support of the Shah’s ministers. In 1873 he was re called from his post, and with that recall vanished Persia’s best, if not her last, chance of securing the Turkomans, and again obtaining possession of Merv with their ffood will. t Letter to Foreign Office, 13th October 1874.

The events now passing in the Gulf, and the tendency unmistakeably shown by Midhut Pasha with regard to Bahrein, afford practical proof that the possession of Bahrein is greatly coveted by the Porte. Indeed, the island has been definitely claimed by Turkey, but its neutrality has been assured by the British Govern* ment, and has been supported for many years. The acquisition of this island by either Turkey or Persia, and the consequent renunciation by us of our position in the Gulf, would most likely lead to a war in which, under present circumstances, the Persians would most probably be beaten. “ Persia can only succeed in securing for herself that position in which the British Government desires to see her, by giving up, once and for all, vain projects for further extension of territory by establishing some approach to a stable and just Government, and by organizing a strong internal admi nistration Shortly after this period the Shah visited Europe, and in the course of his tour reached London* on the 18th June 1873. His Majesty was accompanied by the following Persian Princes,—Abdul Samed Mirza, Ali Kuli Mirza, Sultan Murad Mirza,f Eeroz Mirza, Juman Kuli Mirza, and the Foreign Minister, Mirza Hussein Khan. He met with a reception of unprecedented warmth, and remained in London till the 5th of July. The questions which he raised during this visit in regard to the integrity of Persia and the modification of the Seistan decision have been already noticed in this Note under their separate headings. Nusseer-ud-deen left England with every appear* ance of regret, although he is said to have been much disappointed with the political results of his. visit which left matters between England and Persia in the same unsatisfactory condition in which they had so long remained. Shortly after the Shah’s departure, the question of sending British Officers to drill the Persian army was again brought forward. This subject has been separately treated in this Note, but as it gave rise to certain general opinions on the part of the Indian and Home authorities on the general question of a Persian alliance, a few quotations may be of value. Sir H. Rawlinson, whilst not anticipating any very important or permanent results^ from the em ployment of officers in Persia, yet advocated it as the least expensive and least compromising course then available for testifying to the interest of England in the welfare of Persia, and for recovering a portion of the ground we had lost in that country. He observed:— “ I am strongly of opinion that we cannot, in ordinary prudence, remain any longer inactive in Persia. If we reject the overtures now made, and allow matters to take their course, Persia mustsuccumb to Russia and make common cause with her against Afghanistan and India. The Russian occupation of Merv would be followed by the Persian occupation of Herat, and we might have to combat an army of 50,000 disciplined Persiat troops, commanded by European officers and sup ported by 200 guns, in addition to the Russian battalions pushed on from the Caspian. “ I have no hope that Persia will ever form a barrier to India, such as Afghanistan might become if she completely trusted us ; but it is worth any moderate expense on our part in the present state of the Central Asian question to keep the Shah’s Government neutral to occupy the ground, in fact, so as to prevent, or at any rate to defer, the complete preponderance of Russian influence and Russian counsels. “ According to my view, which is formed after forty years’ experience of Persian politics, there is equal danger in assisting Persia too actively and in neglecting her altogether; and I am constrained, therefore, to prefer a 1 juste milieu* If we gave Persia anything like a guarantee, and offered effec tive military aid, we should in all probability pre cipitate a collision with Russia, for the latter Power, in the present state of her Central Asian relations, •could not tolerate a hostile or quasi-hostilo neighbour on her southern frontier from Ararat to the Oxus. If, on the other hand, we reject the overtures that Persia is now making, and give her to understand that she has nothing to hope for from us, we must lay our account to seeing her place her whole re sources unreservedly at Russia’s disposal. The Shah is unquestionably at present strongly disposed to hold by the English alliance, and he has placed the executive power of the Government almost exclusively in the hands of Ministers who hold the same opinions; but there is a strong Russian party in Persia opposed to the Shah, as there is a strong war party in Russia opposed to the Emperor, and if the Grand Vizier’s present policy, therefore, in favour of England were to break down, there would certainly be a reaction, the Russian party would come into power, and the Shah would be obliged to fall in with their views. I do not believe there is at’ present any intentional duplicity on the part of the Shah or his Ministers. I am as satisfied, indeed, of the loyalty of His Majesty and of the Grand Vizier as I would be of the loyalty of any Orientals. The fact is, that they are thoroughly alarmed at the advances of Russia, and have made up their minds that the only chance of maintaining the indepen dence of the country is by clinging to us for support, but, of course, if we disappoint them they will be compelled to make the best terms they can with the enemy. “ It seems to me, then, that our object should be to give Persia such an amount of support, both moral and material, as should satisfy the Shah of our real desire to strengthen and protect him, without creating in him any extravagant expecta-Government June 1875. 109 tions, or giving any legitimate cause of offence to Russia.* * Lord Northbrook wrote :—* “ Having regard to the condition of Persia, to the character of her Government, to the pressure which Russia can easily bring to hear upon her, and to the hostility shown by Persia to Afghanistan, it can hardly be expected that any solid reliance can be placed upon her as an ally. “ Under present circumstances, it appears to me that we could not, by any action from India, under take to protect the northern provinces of Persia from an attack made upon them by Russia. The distance is so great between India or the Persian Gulf and the scene of operations, an attack from the Caucasus is so easy, Persia is so unable to defend herself, even for a time, that England, unless by the general result of a war, in which the principal scene of operations would be in Europe, would be unable, in my opinion, to ensure the integrity of those provinces. It is unlikely that any of the great Powers of Europe would consider an attack upon Persia by Eussia as a casus belli, and in a war in Europe between Great Britain and Russia, single-handed, neither is in a position to inflict any severe injury upon the other. Our position there fore does not appear to be such as to authorize us to encourage Persia to suppose that she can depend upon receiving material assistance from us. It is worth mentioning that this was the conclusion at which the British Government arrived at the time of the Crimean war, when the question of obtaining the co-operation of Persia against Russia was discussed, when there was a probability at least of obtaining the adherence of France to a treaty of offence and defence with Persia, and when the position of Russia for aggressive purposes was not so strong as it now is. . . . “ I am fully alive to the danger to British India which would result from the conquest of Persia by Russia, and in the event—which, to judge from the recent information which we have received, I cannot regard as improbable—of a substantial annexation of Persian territory by Russia, I am far from saying that a just cause of war between England and Russia might not arise. The interests of England are intimately involved in the main tenance of free communication between England and India, and an attempt to extend Russian terri tory, or a Russian protectorate, to the shores of the Persian Gulf would be so direct a menace to India that it would, in my opinion, justify a resort to arms for the purpose of securing our present supremacy in the Persian Gulf. But the action of Her Majesty’s Government under such circum stances should be left free and unfettered by any previous engagements. . . . “ I should be disposed to encourage and support any substantial proposal for opening out communi-110 cations between the Persian Gulf and the interioi of Persia. This would not only increase the trade between India and Persia, but also strengthen our military position if we are ever called upon to advance into the interior of Persia.’* Lord Napier of Magdala also wrote : — * * Extract from Minute, 4th May 1875, “ Those who advocate inaction would, it ap- dltt0 * pears to me, have us to remain quiescent until Russia actually infringes on the territory of Af ghanistan ; and if she should occupy the northern part of Persia, that we should accept the situa tion. I confess I think there is great danger in this shrinking policy, which increases as it grows older, and would lead us to be inactive, perhaps fruitlessly protesting and being disregarded, until Russian bases of action shall have been formed on the salient points around India; each advance of theirs would render it more difficult for us to repel others until the disquiet in India would unsettle the minds of our subjects, would deprive them of all confidence in our power of protection, and involve us in a protective expenditure, in order to be ready at every point, that our revenue could not meet. “ The difference between our position and that of the Russians is that they, being Asiatic themselves, and constantly absorbing the people of the coun tries which they conquer, take a firmer root in the ground they occupy than we seem ever likely to do in India; they are incorporating with the mother country its new acquisitions, by rail and steam, and by planting colonies, while we are separated from our real base by the sea, and depend mainly on our admirable and invincible 60,000 Europeans ; a resource which is exhaustible. “ Under this view of our position, I think we should do everything in our power to prevent the nearer approach of Russia. “ However pacific the disposition of the present Emperor of Russia may be personally, the Black Sea Treaty should stand before us as a warning that the opportunity only is required to induce the Russian Government to repudiate boldly any obli gations or assurances that may have served to disarm our measures of self-preservation. . . . “ The final objection, that the sudden renewal of intimate relations with Persia may give umbrage to Russia, is part of the timid policy of inaction. That it will appear inconvenient to Russia is most probable, but Russia will have no real right to take umbrage at our renewing our ancient relations with Persia, which do not and cannot threaten her possessions. If Russia does take offence, it will be simply because it would interfere with her plans of encroachment, which we cannot too soon unmask and arrest. ' There remains to be considered what effect the approximation to Persia will have on our relations with Afghanistan. The action of the latter State, orIll rather of its ruler, Shere Ali, has been far from friendly. . . . “ However it may have been caused, it is certain that the Shere Ali who came down to Umballa to see Lord Mayo, and was reported willing to receive our Agents, refused a passage through his country to Sir Douglas Forsyth’s mission, and has left his subsidy untouched. “ It is most likely that in this jealous mood he will view with suspicion any assistance, of the kind asked for, that may be given to Persia. “ To counteract this, it would be expedient to send a Native Envoy to Cabul as advised by the Nawab Gholam Hussain Khan; the business of the Agent would be to endeavour to obtain the confidence of Shere Ali. “ To intimate to him that it is necessary for our mutual interests that we should have Agents to ascertain what is going on in Central Asia, and give us warning of anything likely to affect us injuriously; “ That we should be glad to have them at Balkh and Herat, but as he has not felt able yet to invite us to send them there, we have been obliged to employ them from the Persian side. “ Shere Ali should be assured that the operation of the diplomatic Agents and officers in Persia would be guided by the principle that nothing is to be done that could give umbrage to Afghan istan ; he might be reminded that we have twice declared war against Persia to drive her away from Herat. . . . “ We have long wanted to advance Agents and plant them as stand points towards Central Asia; the side of Afghanistan may not immediately be open to us, though Shere Ali has not recently been made aware of our wishes, but we have a favourable opportunity of re-establishing our influence in Persia, and of placing a barrier against further Russian encroachment on the side of the Attrek. “ If we lose this opportunity, it may not occur again, and we shall have cause to repent it, for we need it more than ever. “We should do all in our power to prevent Russia from working round our flanks. “ If Russia possessed herself of the northern part of Persia, or even assumed a protectorate which would enable her to wield the Persian resources, what would be the use of retaining the shores of the Persian Gulf? We should eventually find our trade virtually driven out of the ports by Russian customs duties. “We should immediately oppose any further encroachment on Persian territory. By increasing our diplomatic influence in Persia, we shall best be able to prevent that country from giving Russia cause for aggression, but should we be driven to war, the people of Persia, supported by a British contingent, and aided by British arms, supplies, andofficers, would render the task of conquering the country as difficult and exhaustive as the con quest of the Spanish Peninsula was to Prance.” Taking into consideration all the circumstances of the case, the Marquis of Salisbury was not at this period disposed to dissent from the general views expressed by Lord Northbrook in reference to Persia,* and he entirely concurred in the opinion * Letter from Sir L. Mallet to Foreign of the Government of India that an officer of Office, 1 1 th August i 8, o. the Indian Service should be attached to the Persian Legation, and that any substantial pro- Note. —For full details on this point, see posals for opening up communications between the t ^ ie information contained in this Note under Persian Gulf and the interior of Persia should be the heading “ Persia and the Karun.” encouraged. In May 1876 f Lord Lytton’s Government, f Government of India, No. 24, Secret, writing on the subject of the representation of 25th Ma 7 1876 * Indian interests at the Court of Teheran, re marked :— “ The representation of specially Indian interests has, for many years, been so neglected, or at least so unsuccessfully maintained, at the Court of Teheran, and the influence of Eussia at that Court has, during the same period, so greatly increased, and so firmly established itself, that it would now he difficult to reconstitute Persia into a really effectual bulwark to this Empire, without an ex penditure largely exceeding any which the Indian revenues are at present able to afford. Eor this reason, and also because, in consequence of the above-mentioned fact, the character of diplomatic relations with Persia must now he determined by considerations subject to the general foreign policy of Her Majesty’s Government, we think that the time is past when the entire establishment, and direct management, of the British Mission at Teheran could he advantageously undertaken by the Government of India.” Writing again in 1877J Lord Lytton’s Govern- % Government of India, No. 21, Secret, ment said:— “ n(1 Jul J “ Unless we are to be always waiting upon Eussia’s action, and thus always considering when we ought to he acting—and acting when the time for action is passed away— it is necessary that we should know beforehand at what point in Eussia’s progress action is to he taken by ns, and what the nature of that action is to be. As Central Asian affairs have long passed from the sphere of purely Indian, into that of Imperial, polities, and as the decision of the questions here reviewed must rest absolutely with the Government of Her Majesty, we, whilst thus unreservedly recording our own appreciation of their special importance at the present critical moment, are anxious to assure your Lordship of the gratitude with which we shall welcome the earliest possible indication of the measures proposed, or sanctioned, by Her Majesty’s Government in reference to a matter so seriously .and so urgently affecting the interests of the113 Empire for whose security we are iointly re sponsible “ ^ext to Afghanistan, the country best situated for helping the Tekke Turcomans against Russia, and to which they most naturally look for assist ance, is Persia. But here we are met with the difficulty of not knowing whether the relations between Her Majesty's Government and the Shah are such as to hold out any hopes of enlisting the services of the latter in prompt and practical efforts to stem the progress of Russia. When Persia once before inquired if the British Govern ment would support her in a protest against the Russian occupation of Earee Kala, it declined to interfere. The answer of Her Majesty’s Govern ment to a recent and similar request concerning the Attrek Valley is not yet known to us. We cannot, however, too strongly express our conviction that, in the interests of Her Majesty’s Indian Em pire, no time should be lost in making every pos sible effort to restore British influence at Teheran, and arrest the process which is now rapidly con verting Persia into a State vassal to Russia/ The attainment of this object appears to us of such urgent importance that, if the chance or means of attaining it be still open to Her Majesty’s Govern ment, jour Lordship may reckon on our willing co operation, even at some pecuniary sacrifice, in any really practical efforts for that purpose. ‘‘We are decidedly of opinion that, in the anxious and urgent circumstances to which your Lordship’s attention is here invited, no arrangement with Persia will be of practical benefit to this Empire, if it does not include the establishment of British agents with suitable escorts at Meshed or Sarakhs, and free access to Merv, through Persian territory. If there be any prospect of some such arrangement, we would suggest, for the consideration of your Lordship, whether it might not, in the meanwhile, be desirable to employ British officers in organizing the powers of resistance of the Merv Turcomans to such an extent as would, at least, secure Merv from a cotip-de-main on the part of Russia, and compel the latter to move cautiously, securing her position well before she attempts further advances. This would, at least, gain time, which, at the present moment, is a most important object. But, unless material guarantees are previously, or simulta neously, taken by Her Majesty’s Government to prevent the policy of Persia in these regions from falling completely under the control of Russian influence, any measure likely to render Merv more dependent on that country would, instead of being beneficial to Indian interests, only increase the embarrassments and dangers of our present situa tion &lt;c To sum up, then, the recommendations sub mitted by us to Her Majesty’s Government are as follows:— («) That British influence be re-established in Persia by assuring the Shah that His F f 3338.114 Majesty ’will have adequate support from the British Government in that opposition which Persia, if thus supported, is best able to offer to further Russian encroach ments in the direction of Merv. (b) That British Officers sent, as soon as pos sible, to Merv, with authority, after ascertaining the position of affairs there, to afford to the Turkomans all the as sistance in their power, if the prospects of resistance seem favourable. (c) That we should he prepared to take such political and military measures as the course of events may render necessary to prevent Russia from obtaining a footing, or even a dominant moral influence, in Afghanistan.' To this representation a reply was addressed by the Secretary of State for India.* informing the Government of India that Her Majesty’s Government reserved for another opportunity any observations on that portion of the Govern ment of India letter which related to Persia. Any action which it might be’ thought neces sary to take in reference to the relations be tween Persia and Russia, especially upon the frontier of the Atrek, must manifestly he of a diplomatic, and not of military character. “ It “ will not, therefore, be requisite,” it was said in conclusion, “ to convey to your Excellency any “ instructions upon that head, but I will com- “ municate to you any measures which Her “ Majesty’s Government may determine to pursue “ through Her Majesty’s diplomatic representative “ at the Persian Court.” * No. 68, Secret, 18th October 1879. Prom this time till the present time the Shah’s mind has been much preoccupied by Russian aggressions on his northern frontier,f which have induced the Persian Minister on more than one recent occasion to revive the question of the general relations between England and Persia. In the course of several conversations last year on this subject, Mr. Ronald ThomsonJ reminded the Eoreign Minister that Persia herself was principally to blame for any coldness which might appear to exist towards her on the part of Eng land ; she had refused, for instance, to open the Karun navigation to British commerce, although that measure had been pressed by us, and would have been of immense advantage to Persia. The Sepah Salar admitted that Persia was throwing away her opportunities, but bewailed her mis fortunes in being, as he said, “ throwm over by “ England, w r ko did everything for Turkey § and “ nothing for Persia.” These conversations were followed by an interview between Mr. Thomson and the Shah himself, during which the subject of Russian aggression was touched upon. The Shah said that Persia had always endeavoured to prevent Russian encroachment, although, finding himself f For full details, see Colonel Burne’s Notes of 13th August 1878 and 22nd July 1879.

[j Mr. Ronald Thomson to Marquis of Salisbury, No. 38, of 21st February 1879. unable* to offer any opposition she had agreed that the “ Russians should take possession of the territory “ up to the north banks of the Atrek, if they engaged “ not to cross to this side.” By renouncing her claim to the territory north of the Atrek, over which she had no direct authority, Persia considered that she would preserve the lands subject to her between the Atrek and Gurgan rivers, which might other wise have been taken possession of by Russia ; the time for action and for England to have concerted measures with Persia to induce the Russians to withdraw altogether from the Turkoman country was, His Majesty said, when Persia found herself forced to make that arrangement, hut it was now “ too late.” Mr. Thomson observed, in reply, that the arrangement to which His Majesty alluded had been made without our knowledge, and was denied by Persia herself at the time. When the conversa tion turned upon the moral support of England* His Majesty did not appear to care for it; he solemnly denied, however, the existence, up to that time, of any such agreement or understanding between Persia and Russia. In reference to the internal condition of Persia, he hoped to initiate certain reforms, with the assistance of the British Government, but he “had not derived that sup- “ port from England which he had hoped and “ expected to obtain.” The increase of Russian influence at Teheranf had become unmistakeably apparent at this period; the Shah s second visit to Europe, from which he had just returned, visibly strengthened the friendly feeling with which he had long been actuated towards the Czar; the defeat of Turkey by the Russian forces, the enormous armaments and armies which the Shah saw in his journey through St. Petersburg,J and his cordial reception at the latter place, had all combined to impress him with the irresistible military power of Russia. This feeling extended to the Shah’s entourage. Whilst the Czar had personally expressed to His Majesty the sense of the value he attached to his personal friendship and alliance, both the Shah§ and his ministers had, on the other hand, been led to believe that England was indifferent alike to Persia and to her friendship. Writing at this time on the subject|| of the general policy of England towards Persia, Mr. Ronald Thomson was of opinion that the result of the Turkish war had been undoubtedly pre judicial to our prestige at Teheran. Rightly or wrongly England had come to be considered in the East as the natural protector, as Russia was the natural enemy, of Turkey. When, therefore, the Russians attacked and defeated Turkey, it was supposed that motives only of self-protection prevented our coming to her rescue. Although our subsequent action at Berlin had the effect of curbing Russia, yet the result was not suffi ciently appreciated to do away with the great effect of the Russian military successes. The Shah116 and his advisers had strong Russian proclivities, and were not well disposed towards England; this feeling was actively encouraged by the Russian legation at Teheran. On the other hand, the action pursued towards Afghanistan, the prompt ness of our movements, the success of our arms, and more than anything else the result obtained of the departure of the Russians from Cabul, and the refusal of the Emperor to assist the Ameer, had produced a marked reaction at Teheran in favour of England. Persia was, no doubt, in Mr. Thomson’s* opinion, anxious for an offensive and defensive alliance with England, but he could hardly advise that course. Unless, indeed, we were prepared to stipulate that Persia should put forward her claim to Akhal as an integral portion of her dominions, and were determined at the same time to support her in asserting that right by force of arms if necessary, an important object of that alliance, that of checking Russia’s advance on Herat, would not be attained. In a conversation between Mr. Thomson and the Sadr Azim early in 1879, His Highnessf said that the Shah had expressed his fear that if Persia were to object to the Russian advance on Akhal, it would give umbrage to her. Would England, therefore, in such a case be prepared to protect Persia against Russian aggression ? If, His Highness went on to say, England was prepared to undertake to defend Persia in the event of any wanton attack made upon her by Russia, to conclude, in fact, a defen sive alliance with Persia, and place her in a similar position to that occupied by Turkey as regards pro tection and support, Persia, on her side, would object to the Russian occupation of Akhal, would refuse supplies to the Russian troops, would decline to employ Russian officers, would agree to consult England in all important matters, and would sub stitute English for Russian influence in the country. In short, provided that England engaged to defend Persia from attack and aggression by Russia, the Shah would undertake,—J “ (1.) To consult England, and act in accordance with her advice, in all future political and commercial relations with Russia. “ (2.) To act in conjunction with England, and in accordance with her wishes, in any action, military or diplomatic, which Her Ma jesty’s Government might consider neces sary to check Russian advance in the direction of Afghanistan. 4t (3.) To give every facility for our trade ; to con cede the navigation of the Karun, and similar privileges, and to place British commercial relations with Persia upon the most favourable footing.

At this period the attention of Persia was chiefly directed to Russian designs on Merv, to which subject no further allusion need here be made, a&amp; it has already been treated separately in this Note. J The attention of the Shah having been principally occupied during the past ten years by Russian a §o ress i 011 on his northern borders, no other question of prominence has marked the recent years of his reign. It may be interesting to mention,, however, that the subject of consular jurisdiction in Persia has pressed itself since 1866 on the atten tion of the British Government. The question first arose in 1866,* consequent [upon a representation from Her Majesty’s Minister at Teheran as to the insufficient power of control possessed by Her Majesty’s servants in Persia over British subjects. Steps were thereupon taken to prepare an Order in Council to apply to that country the provisions of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act. The matter was &gt; however, beset with difficulties. After a corre spondence extending over no less than 11 years, the issues were narrowed to one single point, viz., the basis on which the Order in Council should be framed; whether there should be (1) a separate and clear grant on the part of the Shah of extra territorial jurisdiction to the Queen, or (2) whether the rights which the Queen would delegate to her officers should be based upon “ treaty, capitulation, “ grant, usage, sufferance, and other lawful means.” The first alternative would necessitate a conven tion with Persia, while in the second case an Order in Council might be framed of more limited scope, applicable in the first instance only to the littoral of the Persian Gulf. After protracted consideration it was ultimately decided that this latter fcourse should be adopted,f and that consular powers should be conferred on the political officers in the Persian Gulf. But difficulties again arose, and on the suggestion of the Foreign Officej; it was determined in 1877 that the judicial functions of the officers in the Persian Gulf should be disconnected from their consular powers. In pursuance of this decision the Resident in the Persian Gulf has been granted a commission § appointing him to be “Her Majesty’s Consul General for the province of Pars and the coasts and “ islands of the Persian Gulf, being within the “ dominions of Persia.” Steps were also taked to prepare an Order in Council || applying the Foreign Jurisdiction Act to the Persian coast and islands, and the draft thereof was, on 19th September 1878, forwarded to the Government of India for their observations there- on.^f No reply, however, has as yet been received to the Secretary of State’s Despatch. 3338. G g^v-,-*» *•- * s .._- .-'^-r fc ' - 118 In 1861 proposals* were made for a convention * Aitchison’s Treaties, vol. vi., p. 367 l)etween the Indian and Persian Governments for the construction of a line of telegraph from the Turkish frontier through Persia to Bunder Abbas, to form part of a telegraph line from England to India. After some negotiations, however, the Persian Government, on the 25th April 1862, de clined the terms offered. The route through Persia was therefore abandoned, and the Turkish and Indian lines of telegraph were connected by a sub marine cable in the Persian Gulf. In 1868 a Convention was concluded by which, in order to provide against any accident to the Persian Gulf cable, it was agreed that the British Government should construct and work a line of telegraph between Gwadur and a point between Jask and Bundar Abbas. After the failure of the negotiations alluded to above the Shah decided on constructing an alterna tive line at bis own cost, from Khanikeen on the Turkish frontier through Teheran, Ispahan, and Shiraz, to meet the other line at Bushire, and for this purpose he concluded an engagement in December 1863 to place the construction and * working of the line for a time under the superin tendence of a English engineer officer, to purchase the materials from the British Government, and to- allow the British Government the use of the line on payment of specified charges. By a convention executed at Teheran on 23rd November 1865, and ratified on 1st May following, the Persian Government agreed to erect under the direction and supervision of British officers another wire, to be used for international messages only, on the Bushire and Khanikeen line, the necessary materials to be provided by the British Government and paid for in five yearly instalments. It w'as further agreed that the establishments should be paid by the British Government, though the pro tection of the line was to remain with Persia, and that all receipts up to 30,000 tomans per annum should be credited to Persia, the surplus, if any, being made over to the British Government. The receipts did not amount to this sum in any one year, and the cost of establishments and mainten ance, Bs. 1,20,000, fell entirely on the British Government. In May 1869, however, an arrangement was concluded between the British and Persian Govern ments and the Indo-European Telegraph Company, by which the British Government was relieved of a portion of these charges. This Company had early in 1868 obtained a concession from the Persian Government to construct and work a telegraph line from Julfa to Teheran for a term of twenty-five years. It was now agreed that the Company should pay the Persian Government a fixed annual sum of 12,000 tomans, in lieu of the receipts up to 80,000 tomans formerly paid by the British Go vernment ; that they should deduct from that pay ment an annual instalment of one one-twenty-fourth119 of the debt due by the Persian to the British Government on account of the cost of construction, and should pay that instalment to the British G overnment; and that till that debt was paid off, or as long, at all events, as the British Government held the concession of the line, the Company should also pay the British Government a moiety of the surplus receipts in excess of 12,000 tomans per annum. In return for this, if the Convention of 1865 were not renewed, the Company were to have the concession, and in the case of its renewal to receive from the Persian Government one third of their charge on each message along the whole line from Bushire to Julfa. The telegraph convention of 1865 expired on 12th August 1872, but was renewed for a period of three months, and on 2nd December following a fresh convention for the construction of a third wire was signed, and came into force from 31st March 1873, the date of its ratification. In consequence of the frequency with which outrages had been , perpetrated on the persons and property of telegraph employes, and damage caused to the telegraph posts and wares, it was provided by Article 2 that the British employes should be placed under the special protection of the local authorities, the latter fur nishing them with guards when necessary, and otherwise assuring their personal safety; and by Article 12 that the expenses of repairing any wilful damage to the line should be borne by the Persian Government. This convention remains in force until 1st January 1895, when the whole line will be handed over to the Persian Government, unless this shall have already been done in accordance with the terms of Article 19. It may be here mentioned that in 1842 a com mercial treaty was concluded between Persia and Spain for the mutual protection of traders and tra vellers in each other s territories. In 1872 a further treaty was concluded, confirming the stipulations of the above treaty, and providing for the reciprocal appointment of a Consul and Commercial Agent. In 1872 a treaty of commerce and navigation was also concluded between Persia and Germany, by which each nation agreed to place the subjects of the other on the footing of the most favoured nation, and to allow them to travel freely whenever they pleased. Provision was also made for defining the jurisdiction of the Consuls whom, to the number . of three, each nation may nominate in the territory of the other. By Article 18 the German Govern ment declared its readiness to lend its good offices, if requested by the Shah to do so, in bringing about the settlement of any dispute which might arise between Persia and her neighbours. The unsettled state of the border districts of Persia and Turkey has long been productive of dis sensions between the two States. Complaints of the passage of nomad tribes to and from the pasha- lik of Bagdad, and of the grant of an asylum to marauders and refugees by the frontier authorities, led to the insertion of articles in the treaty con-eluded at Erzeroom in 1823 providing for the remedy of these abuses. These provisions proved ineffectual, and in 1849 four Commissioners were appointed on the part of England, Eussia, Persia, and Turkey respectively, for the purpose of de fining the border as provided in the second and third articles of the treaty concluded at Erzeroom in 1847. A map of the border districts was pre pared by the Commission, but the actual demarca tion was not effected, and the question remained in abeyance. In 1869 a protocol was signed by the Persian and Turkish representatives, by which the status quo of the lands in dispute was to be main tained until the boundary line should be settled, and no buildings were to be erected on these lands. In 1871, however, the border disputes were revived; negotiations ensued, and finally it was arranged that refugees on the border should be removed to such a distance in the interior of each State as should prevent their carrying on intrigues, and that a Perso-Turkish Commission should assemble at Constantinople for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of the second treaty of Erzeroom, and at which delegates on the part of England and Eussia should be present to assist the delegates of Persia and Turkey in coming to a complete under standing. In 1876 a Convention was agreed upon between the Persian and Turkish Governments for regu lating the position of the subjects of the two powers in their respective States.

Appendix II. Extract from Memorandum by Sir H. C. Rawlinson, dated 20th July 1868. The doctrine which prevails at present in our Eastern diplomacy is simply this, that Persia is too weak and faithless to justify any extraordinary expense in keeping up cordial relations with the Shah. We are content for a while to occupy a subordinate position to Russia at Teheran, trusting that, when the time comes for action, we may regain ourlost ground by increased expenditure and redoubled activity; but this is, after all, a very short-sighted policy. The goodwill of a nation,—that which we once possessed, but have now lost in Persia,—is not to be purchased in a day. It is the growth of time, of steady unremitting attention. If we desire, then, to check the advance of Russia towards India, if we desire, above all, to render impossible,—or, at any rate, indefinitely to postpone,—her occupation of Herat, it is indispensable that we should bestir ourselves in Persia at once. The vast expenditure that we incurred in the days of Harford, Jones, and Malcolm, in expelling the Erench from Teheran, is no longer required. What is required is an indication of renewed interest in the country, and a disposition to protect it against Russian pressure. Our Officers should be again placed in positions of influence and power with the Persian troops, as in the days of Christie, of Lindsay, and of Hart. Presents of improved arms, and perhaps artillery, would testify to our awakened interest. The Persian nobles should be encouraged to send their sons for education to London, rather than to Paris. Invest ments of English capital in banks, in railways, in mining operations, and other commercial enterprises are freely proffered, and if supported by our authorities would create a further bond of union between the countries. Among a people, again, who are so fond of display, and attach so much value to outward forms, it is of the first importance that our mission should be kept up on a very liberal scale, and that presents should be freely distributed, that the diplomatic establishment, in fact, at Teheran, should be Oriental rather than European. A further opportunity has occurred for creating a very favourable impression, and, in fact, inaugurating the new system which is recommended, in the Shah’s application for our aid in creating and keeping up a Persian naval force in the Gulf. Considering the singular maritime inaptitude of the Persians, it is not likely that this scheme, notwithstanding ourcountenance and support, will ever realize the Shah’s expectations, hut our acquies cence in the proposal would, at any rate, very much strengthen our influence at Court, and might aid even in developing that community of interests which our joint tele graphic establishment has already initiated. Extract from Remarks by Brigadier-General Lumsden, dated 21st September 1868. Equal in importance with our relations with Afghanistan and our other neighbours, is the question of our influence at the Persian Court, so ably advocated by General Rawlinson. I most cordially agree with him in all he says on this head, and consider that the recovery of paramount influence there at the present juncture would be cheap at a heavy outlay. Extract from Memorandum by Lieutenant Governor D. E. McLeod, Punjab, dated 10th October 1868. I fully agree with Sir H. Rawlinson in the opinion he has expressed as to the expediency of endeavouring to regain in full the goodwill of Persia, which we formerly possessed, by the exercise of steady unremitting attention, and by liberally conferring on her ruler and nobles from time to time liberal grants and presents, as occasion may require. What class of Officers are most likely to place our relations with that country on a satisfactory footing, it must rest with Government to determine, but Sir Henry Rawlinson’s suggestions on this head appear to me to be well deserving of attentive consideration. Extract from Memorandum by Colonel R. Taylor, dated 23rd November 1868. Sir Henry Rawlinson’s proposition is to make friends with Afghanistan and Persia, re-establishing our influence with both; he would give European Officers for the Persian army, and, I think (I write from memory), he makes mention in one place of giving material support to Afghanistan, if necessary, though he would prefer our efforts being confined within the limits of diplomacy. If Persia can thus be made ours in feeling, by aid given to her by us in establishing a naval force in the Gulf, and if her army can be drilled and commanded by British Officers, at any rate there would be a game worth playing, and, situated as the Persian territory is, such a position must have a certain influence on Russian pro ceedings in Central Asia, while it would tend to our honour and influence in Asiatic politics generally. W hether this attitude can be accomplished without an enormous and well ni^h ruinous outlay for a structure which might crumble to pieces when submitted to real pressure,—for I have, I confess, a very poor opinion of the Persian troops,—I am not in a position to judge. Persia has always appeared to me to be so overcrowded and exposed, as regards Russia, that I have 'never felt it likely that we should be able to cope successfully with the latter in Persian diplomacy, and thus that what favour we obtained for a time would only be to keep us in play and draw our money. But there may be wheels within wheels which I am not aware of, which may reallv incline Persia to look for friendship farther from home. The hereditary domestic tyrant, the domineering elder brother, may be the least loved member of the circle, and,' if so, by all means let us take advantage of the opening, for, indeed, from our unfortunate position making action so difficult, we do want every help to give us a lift in the estimation of all classes in Asia in this especial matter. If we do not advance into Afghanistan to meet the Russians, and thus play the forward game, we must appear to await attack at the foot of the mountains, and' that appearance itself is an evil and misfortune. If, however, the rumour got abroad that we were strong in Persia, there would be an appearance of life, and we should be supposed to know very well what we were about in other divisions of the game.Extract from a Minute by Sir J. Lawrence, dated 25th November 1868. But I do not support the recommendation that English Officers be encouraged to enter the Persian service, and am altogether opposed to the policy of spending much money out of Indian revenues in Persia. I believe that such a system would prove of no real advantage in strengthening our influence in Persia, and certainly I think that such an expenditure would prove more beneficial on our own frontier. Persia appeal's to me to be so weak in herself from various causes that she is practically under the control of Russia, and utterly unable to resist the influence of that Power. In any great struggle connected with Afghanistan, Persia would certainly follow the behests of Russia, even though unwilling on some grounds to do so. Extract from a Minute by Sir R. Temple, dated 8th December 1868. The other point is the maintaining of a British naval force, at as moderate a strength as might be consistent with efficiency, in the Persian Gulf. The Shah of Persia recently applied for such a force, to be paid by his Government. This proposal could not exactly be complied with, because the Shah could not really pay for the force, and any such liability on his part would lead to fresh complications. 'But the British Government might w r ell take the opportunity of assuring the Shah that it would maintain, as an ally, such naval force as might be needed. An additional reason for doing this might be the apprehension that, if we hold back, some other European naval Power might step in. And we have actual information that something of this kind has been thought of by at least some French authorities. Extract from a Minute by Colonel H. W. Norman, dated 8th December 1868. I also entirely agree with the Viceroy as to the inexpediency of placing British Officers with the Persian troops. If a struggle comes and Persia is inclined to our side, no doubt we may then use means to strengthen her hands, but the presence of British Officers might not be accepted now, or, if accepted, might lead to disagree ments, while their employment cannot be supposed to be likely to influence Persia to side with us, and, if disposed to go against us, she would dismiss these Officers at her pleasure. Extract from a Minute by the Honourable G. N. Taylor, dated 12th December 1868. As regards our Persian diplomacy, though Sir H. Rawlinson’s proposals and suggestions are entitled to great weight, I incline to agree with the Governor General that, for the present at least, the transfer to the India Office of our relations with that Court is all that is required. Extract from a Minute by Sir W. R. Mansfield, dated 24th December 1868. I can see no reason for repeating the experiment of sending British Officers to drill the troops of the Shah. This has been tried before both in Persia and Turkey, without any really practical result so far as I have ever been able to learn.i 126 Appendix III. Memorandum by Sir H. Rawlinson, dated 10th October 1868. I am of opinion that it would be highly expedient to grant the Shalds application for the detachment of a body of Commissioned and Non-commissioned Officers to Persia, to be employed in organizing and instructing the Persian army. They would not probably achieve any great military success, that is, they would not be able to produce any powerful effect on the discipline and efficiency of an army of thirty or forty thousand men, but they would nevertheless serve many a useful and important purpose. They would, in the first place, preoccupy the ground against other European nations. The experiment has been recently tried with French and German Officers, and has failed, because the Government which supplied these Officers Pad no substantive interest in the country, and the individuals were left to pursue a personal career, almost as if they were adventurers ; but it would be very different if Persia by our refusal were driven to accept of Officers from the Russian Government, which has direct interest in the country, and which would thus cordially support its Officers, with a view of bringing the Persian army more or less under its own control. This indeed would be a serious evil, and might lead to very disastrous results. But the presence of British Officers in Persia, besides the negative advantage of keeping out the Russians, may be expected to produce much positive good. It will promote a good feeling between the two countries, render the Persians more familiar with our views, induce them to look to us for counsel and support, rather than regard us with mistrust, and in fact create a certain community of interest between us. I have no hesitation in saying that wherever British Officers have resided in Persia, and more especially in the provinces beyond the sphere of Court intrigue, British influence, as compared with that of any other European nation, has become pre dominant, and I believe this to be a matter of very considerable interest, in view to future contingencies. It is also very important to have a nursery of Persian employes upon whom we may draw for the service of the State, as occasion requires. Indian service alone will not give the necessary qualification, and the telegraph staff in Persia, although valuable in this respect, is not sufficiently extensive. To give the experiment of a Persian detachment a fair chance of success, it is, however, indispensable that the Officers should be in an independent position with regard to pay and allowances. The French and German Officers lost their influence, and constantly found themselves in a false position, because they were dependent on the Persian Government for their support; and unless, therefore, we think the matter of sufficient consequence to justify a moderate expenditure, as a measure of Indian defence, we had better throw cold water on the proposal from the outset. What I should recommend would be, that we should follow the precedent of 1833, when, under similar circumstances, we did meet the requisition of the then Persian Government for the services of a body of Commissioned and Non-commissioned Officers, corresponding as nearly as possible with the detachment which is now applied for. On that occasion, we gave a liberal command allowance to the Officer who was placed in charge of the party, and we granted a small additional sum to each subor dinate Officer, in excess of his regimental pay and allowances, leaving the question of further remuneration by the Persian Government for arrangement between the Mission and the Persian authorities. This plan answered sufficiently well during the five years the detachment in question was employed in Persia, and is the only one which appears to me suitable to the present occasion. Some modification of detail would probably be required in selecting Officers from the different branches of the service, the result of our experience on the one hand, and in reference to the altered constitution of the Indian Army upon the other. Instead of sending Engineer and Cavalry Officers and Sergeants, wdio are nearly useless, 1 would increase the number of the Artillery and Infantry details, the regular Persian army being confined to those branches; but all such minor matters may conveniently be left for future adjustment. The only immediate matter for considera tion is, whether a general answer in the affirmative should be telegraphed to Teheran, and I would strongly recommend that such an answ r er should be made. 3338. I i126 Memorandum by Mr. Kaye (now Sir J. Kaye), dated 27th October 1868. The question of the employment of a certain number of Officers of the Indian Army, as instructors to the forces of the Shah of Persia, is revived, in a somewhat urgent manner, and I venture to suggest that the Secretary of State should decide it, without further reference to the Government of India. When last it was referred, it fell through—nothing was done. The Persian Government did not bid high enough; and it was considered that the right men could not be obtained upon the terms that were offered. The question now is, whether, with a view to ulterior political advantages, we shall undertake to pay, from our own Treasury, the entire stalf salary, on a liberal footing, of the Officers deputed to Persia to organize and instruct the Persian army. If we do not, some other European Power will. It is better to occupy the ground for ourselves. The question, being one of considerable Imperial interest and importance, should, I think, be determined by the Home Government. It may, of course, be said that the interests involved are rather European than Asiatic, and that, therefore, the expense of employing British Officers in Persia ought to be defrayed by the Eoreign Office out of the 12,000/. per annum paid from the Indian Treasury for the support of our establishments in Persia. But if we insist upon this, it is very probable that the settlement of the question will again be deferred. So it comes to this,—Is the attainment of the object in view of sufficient importance to authorize the expenditure from the Indian revenues ? A Memorandum by Sir Henry Kawlinson is enclosed, which points out the advantages of the arrangement. If the Secretary of State should sanction this arrangement, we should address both the Eoreign Office and the Government of India with as little delay as possible. Both Persia and India should be communicated with by telegraph. Memorandum by Sir R. Montgomery, dated 30th October 1868. _ have perused these papers, and concur generally in the Memorandum written by Sir Henry Rawlinson. J I do not think we should decline the offer that has been made. If the arrangements be judiciously carried out, a good feeling will be created, greatly to our advantage. J Eor the Head of the Staff, we should not look merely to a good drill master. He should be an Officer of various experience, and who has had civil and political work in India, intelligent and courteous in his manners, and able to speak the Persian language. Under him would be intelligent European Officers, specially selected, and acquainted with the language and tribes on our western frontier, from Kurrachee to Hazerah. I would strongly recommend that, instead of European Non-commissioned Officers, who greatly offend Natives by their ignorance, and want of knowledge of their customs and habits, that Native Commissioned and Non-commissioned Officers from the frontier regiments, and of the same creed as the Persians, be selected to accompany the detachment. 1 J Men of rank (important) and family can be found, and they should be liberally They would form the connecting link between our Officers and Persians and I believe that the effect would be excellent. They will gain admission to the social circle of Persian society, and will not fail to extol the British power and fame. I think also a high Native Officer of rank might be attached as Aide-de-Camp or Secretary to the Head of the Staff. ' 1127 Appendix IV. The Policy of Great Britain towards Persia. The Treaty of Turkumanchai, between Russia and Persia, was signed on the 21st of February 1828, and soon after Sir J. Macdonald paid 200,000 tomauns to Persia ta abandon the 3rd and 4th Articles of a treaty which hound England to assist Persia with a subsidy in case of war with Russia. The date is important, for up to that time the influence of England was paramount in Persia, and a defensive alliance existed between the two countries. But a new policy was inaugurated, Russia acquired increased and increasing influence in Persia, while England, ascribing to Russian instigation movements on the part of Persia which in reality proceeded from the ambitious aspirations of the Shahs, set herself to restrain those movements, and to limit Persia to her de facto possessions, inhibiting her from advancing in the direction of Afghanistan, Sistan, Mekran, and Arabia, and discouraging every other design or effort on her part to acquire or regain territory. Thus, after the death of Abbas Mirza in 1833, his son was deterred by the remonstrances of the British Minister from com pleting the conquest of Herat. In 1835, Hajji Mirza Aghassi, by birth a Russian subject, became the Prime Minister of Muhammed Shah, and when the Shah, in November 1837, laid siege to Herat, the change of policy on the part of the two great European Powers towards Persia liad reached its culminating point, and the strange spectacle was witnessed of Russian Officers and a Russian battalion serving, with the Persian army, and a Russian Minister, Count Simonich, urging on the operations of that army, while an English Officer was leading the sorties against it, and the English Minister, Mr. McNeill, threatened the Shah with war, a threat which was proved not to be an idle one by the occupation of an island in the Persian Gulf belonging to Persia. In nine years, then, every vestige of the Anglo-Persian alliance had dis appeared, the English Officers who had disciplined the Shah’s troops were on the point of being removed,* and we were engaged in driving back those very troops, while the war between Russia and Persia, which raged in 1828, had changed in 1837 into a Russo-Persian league. From that time until now our relations with Persia, except during short intervals, have never been on a cordial footing, as may be seen from the following brief summary. Muhammed Shah abandoned the siege of Herat in Sep tember 1838, but he did not finally carry out the demands made by Lord Palmerston in July 1839, till the 31st of March 1841, when Ghorian was evacuated by the Persian troops; and until that Shah’s death, on the 4th of September 1848, Hajji Mirza Aghassi, the friend of Russia rather than of England, remained Prime Minister. His successor, the Amir-i-Nizam, was a true patriot, and sought only the good of his country, which obviously was more likely to be attained by friendship with England than with Russia. He was succeeded, however, in November 1851 by Mirza Agha, better known as the Sadr-i-Azim, who, though once a British protege, was no friend to England. After protracted disagreements, his proceedings led to the rupture of relations between this country and Persia on the 5th of December 1855, which was followed by the Persian siege of Herat in 1856, and by our declaration of war against Persia on the 1st of November in that year. The second war with Persia (for the occupation of Kharak in 1838 must be regarded as the first) ended with the Treaty of Paris on the 4th of March 1857, but except during the short interval that Sir H. Rawlinson was Minister, and the very brief period in 1862-63 when the writer of this Memorandum was Charge d’Affaires, there has been no return to cordiality in our relations with Persia. At the present moment it is known indirectly that nothing but a sense of his inability to cope with us prevents the Shah from coming to an open rupture with our Government. His Majesty con siders himself personally aggrieved by our proceedings in the Persian Gulf, by the support given to the Ruler of Cabul, and denied to Persia, and by the discouragement of Persian pretensions to Merv and Sistan. Whatever may be the tone of his official correspondence, it is certain that matters are in such a state that the Shah might easily be induced to connive at, or, perhaps, even openly assist a Russian occupation of Herat, and advance towards the frontier of Sindh. As we are entirely ignorant of the intrigues that are going on with Yakub Khan, a combination might be formed with him at any moment, which might entail upon us very troublesome and expensive operations. * The removal took place in January 1838.128 If the preceding remarks are correct, it is plain that the change of policy towards 'Persia commenced in 1828 has not been fruitful of good, hut, on the contrary, has resulted in two wars, which have cost several millions, has changed the cordial alliance which existed between Great Britain and Persia prior to that date into chronic anta gonism, and in a Russo-Persian invasion of Afghanistan. It seems, therefore, desirable to consider whether this policy should not be laid aside or modified, and to examine the arguments for and against it. Those who are in favour of it will probably say that it has enabled us to avoid giving umbrage to Russia, and that, but for it, the war which took place in the Crimea might have been antedated on the Caspian. They may say that the Persians are an effete nation, and their country a mere pabulum Orci, sure to be swallowed up by the great Northern Power, when her deglutition of the Central Asian States, Khiva, Bokhara, and Kokan, which is still far from complete, has been accomplished; that Persian administration is corrupt through all its branches, and that, consequently, Persia is less able to defend herself now than in the days of Abbas Mirza, because a better organization, which implies regular supplies of money, is still more requisite at this time to enable the troops which the present Shah has endeavoured to form on European models to contend with a Russian army. They may argue that it is useless to attempt to bolster up such a State as this, and that, leaving Persia to its fate, our true policy is to await the invasion of India, if it ever takes place, within the Indian frontiers. Lastly, it will be said that no dependence is to be placed on Persian promises, and that so venal a Government as that of Persia can always be purchased when a necessity arises for dealing with it, so that, should it ever he thought desirable to make common cause with it, or enlist its support, the offer of a subsidy will effect our purpose. The reply to all this is, that Russia would have been at a far greater disadvantage in attacking Persia in alliance with us than she was in the Crimea. Until the Cir cassian exodus in 1860 the Russian army could never have advanced far into Persia had the Persian forces been officered and paid, even in part, by England. No doubt Russia is in an infinitely more commanding position as regards Persia at present than when the difficult countries on both shores of the Caspian were still independent, and the Cossacks remained at 500 miles greater distance on the west, and 800 on the east, from, the Persian frontier than they are now. Still, there is yet time, if we choose to avail ourselves of the opportunity, to make Persia a safe outer defence for India, im penetrable to Russia and to any other Power. The Persians, far from being effete, have not degenerated, physically or mentally, from what they were in the palmiest days of their history. They live entirely in the open air, and are constantly on horse back. The sickly children 'die, and only the hardy survive. Hence, notwithstanding their vices, they are a fine athletic race, with an amount of nerve which Europeans mi^ht envv, and they want nothing but good discipline and proper organization to become truly formidable soldiers. Those who have known them best are loudest in their praise' Eldred Pottinger, who had the best opportunities of judging, said,— « Muhammed Shah’s troops were infinitely better soldiers than our sepoys, and twice « as good troops as the Afghans. The practice of their artillery was really superb. &lt;« Thev simply wanted engineers and a General to have proved a most formidable « force.” Sir Justin Sheil says,—“ The Persian soldier is active, energetic, and “ robust, with immense power of enduring fatigue, privation, and exposure. He is full “ of intelligence, and seems to have a natural aptitude for a military life. Half “ clothed, half fed, and not even half paid, he will make marches of 24 miles day after “ day, and when needs be he will extend them to 40 miles. He bears cold and heat with “ equal fortitude, is full of life and cheerfulness, and has always displayed the most « complete submission to his English commanders, for whom he has ever had a special « veneration. In the last contest between Persia and Turkey, 3,000 or 4,000 Persians “ of the regular army put to flight 30,000 or 40,000 Turks at Toprah Kalah, between « Baiazid and Erzerum.” Sir H. Rawlinson has an equally high opinion of the soldier like qualities of the Persians, and an Officer who has lately seen their cavalry on the Mekran frontier considers it superior to the best Native Cavalry we have. Erom this indisputable testimony to the value of the Persian soldier two deductions may be drawn;—first, that if we will send English Officers to Persia, we may form an army which will render it impossible for Russia to conquer the country, and, secondly, that if we do not the Russians will some day take our place and prepare for themselves an auxiliary force which will enable them to conquer Afghanistan and invade India. But it may be said that, if the Persians are such good soldiers, it will be unwise to add to their power by disciplining them, lest they turn against us. The answer is,129 that they are true to their salt, (and always showed themselves devoted to their English Officers, to such an extent, indeed, that they sacrificed for them even their religious scruples, as m carrying the body of Sir H. Bethune to the grave. The Persians in general, suspecl and detest the Russians, but they have no jealousy of the English as they know we have no wish to take their country. It is absurd, then, to suppose that Persia would ever desert us for a Russian alliance so long as we showed her real friendship. . But perhaps it will he argued that a policy of 10 years’ growth cannot be changed m a moment. We have engaged in two wars, and have spent millions to keep Persia out of Herat, we have forcibly repulsed her attempts upon Bahrein we have systematically exasperated the Shah by discouraging every effort he lias made to expand his territories, and by openly favouring and subsidizing his natural enemies the Afghans, and can we now turn round and try to make a friend of one who has such good cause to dislike us ? Tlie reply is, that though, if only for the sake of con sistency, a sudden and violent change of policy might be inexpedient, at all events it will be well to prepare to steer on a new tack. We cannot allow Herat to become a part of Persia at present, hut there is now an opportunity of detaching it partially f rom Kahul, and of placing a European Officer there, who would keep us informed* of all that went on. This might be done without exciting notice by moving up Mr Dolma^e from Meshed, and placing him under the Commissioner in Sindh. If the route by the Helmund and Nushky he practicable, communication between Herat and Kelat would be effected in eight or nine days, partly on horseback and partly on dromedaries. If not letters would reach Kabul from Herat through the Hazarah country in 15 or 16 days at most. As Mr. Dolrnage is a medical man, and has lived for lO* years amono* the Persians, he could avoid giving offence far better than any one who could be sentfrom India. I he Shah might be completely propitiated by acknowledging the validity of his claim to Sistan as far as the Helmund, and perhaps the Bah?ein difficulty mio-ht begot nd of by promoting Colonel Pelly, and offering to refer the Persian and lurkish claims to arbitration. In that case a stipulation might be made for the settlement of the Mekran frontier, and some encouragement might he ^iven to the Shah to repossess himself of Merv, which is desirable on several accounts, and more particularly as keeping the Russians at a distance. It is perhaps possible that this might be effected by negotiation with the Turcomans, and granting them a small subsidy. Above all, English Officers should be at once sent to discipline the Shah’s troops, say 20 subalterns and sergeants, and five field officers, whose expenses, to the extent of 15,000^ per annum, would be borne by the Indian Government, while there would be no difficulty m obtaining other emoluments for them from the Persian Government, though it would not be well that they should be entirely dependent on that Government, T he necessity of watching over the growth of opium in Persia would alone justify ten times the expenditure. It is only necessary to add that the character of the present Shah is such that it ia very easy to obtain an influence over him for good, and that his secret inclinations are all towards an alliance with England. On the other hand, the prosperity of Persia would be all for our advantage, not only politically, as has been attempted to be shown in the preceding remarks, hut also commercially. There is now a trade between India and Persia of about two millions, for which nothing as yet has been done beyond clearing the Persian Gulf of pirates, but which, by judicious measures, might be- increased to ten times that amount. 16th June 1871. Edward B. Eastwick. Memorandum on the Policy of Great Britain towards Persia. I concur generally in Mr. Eastwick’s views of the policy which should be adoptee by Great Britain towards Persia. Persia will assuredly count for something, possible for much, m the future history of the British Empire 'in the East. Placed as she is on the flank of the dehateable land between the Caspian and the Indus, it will depend a -AT ° n * ier a ^ 10 1 u h . ow and when a contact may take place between Russia and British India, U she is strong and friendly to us, that contact may be indefinitely postponed. If she is either weak or unfriendly, the contact may take place, inevitably to the disadvantage of India, whenever Russia chooses to provoke a crisis. It should then he to our mterest to conciliate her friendship, and at the same time to give her 3338. £ ^130 strength and confidence in her own resources ; any expense to which we may be put in this account being regarded as a sort of premium on the insurance of India. But there is very great difficulty in practically carrying out the policy that I have thns indicated (and' herein I disagree with Mr. Eastwick), because the measures most calculated to find favour with the Shah, and to attach him to our interests, are pre cisely those which would most tend to weaken and disorganize his Government. I allude especially to an extension of territory, a desire for which is the Shah’s besetting sin, but which would in reality be most dangerous to the country. Mr. Eastwick suggests that we should encourage Persia to occupy Merv, that we should approve of her encroachments in Seistan and Mekran, that we should make concessions to her in the Persian Gulf, and, ultimately, that we should perhaps even allow her to occupy Herat; and doubtless such a policy on our part would be most gratifying to the Shah, and for a time would make our influence paramount in the councils of the State; but it would be a most dangerous thing for Persia thus to be launched on a policy of general aggression. She is barely able to take care of herself as she now stands, but if she were embroiled with Turcomans and Uzbegs to the north-east, with Afghans and Beloochees to the south-east, and with Arabs to the south, there would assuredly be rebellion in the provinces, and interference would be thus invited both on the part of Turkey and of Russia. There is only one measure advocated by Mr. Eastwick, which seems to me to com bine the two advantages of strengthening Persia and pleasing the Shah, and that is furnishing Officers for the Persian Army. It will be a great pity, I think, if we allow considerations of economy to interfere with this scheme. There are large numbers of unemployed Officers of the Staff Corps in India from whom a due -selection might be made for service in Persia, and even if we gave them a small additional allowance while serving in a foreign country, the expense would be but trifling. The real and essential improvement, however, that is required is, that more care and attention should be bestowed upon the mission at the Court of Teheran. The Minister, in the first place, should not be a man who, however, able and experienced, merely discharges his duties perfunctorily as a member of Her Majesty’s diplomatic service, but one who takes a personal interest in the country, and who should consider it his special mission to gain the Shah’s confidence and friendship. There is no Court in the world at which personal conduct and personal feelings are more powerful, for good or for evil, than at Teheran. It was Sir John M'Neill’s personal interest with Eutteh Ali Shah which for so many years, and under greater difficulties than exist at present, placed us in a position of complete superiority at the Persian Court. Indeed, when we consider that the Shah is himself the Government, and that, having no experience beyond his own country, he is among the most impressible of mortals, it must be seen that strict diplomatic rules are quite ini- applicable to Persia, while personal qualifications and personal management are the main points to be regarded. If the Shah is once brought to look upon the British Minister as his personal friend and confidential counsellor, then dissuasion from territorial aggrandisement, instead of producing irritation as at present, would be received with thankfulness, as advice tendered in the true interests of the country. For instance, in regard to the pending questions of Bahrein and the Mekran frontier, the Shah fully believes that we are actuated by selfish views in resisting Persian pretensions, and diplomatic protests accordingly only provoke feelings of resentment; but if the British Minister, as the trusted adviser of the Crown, could point out to His Majesty that the acquisition of an Arab or Belooch dependency would be a source of weakness rather than of strength to his Government, then the discussion might be closed, not only without disturbing our amity, but with positive advantage to the confidential character of our relations. Delicate questions, indeed, of this nature, in which Persian and British Indian interests are apparently in conflict, are constantly coming to the surface, and require the most careful handling by an experienced Indian diplomatist, in order to be disposed of without giving umbrage to the Shah. I would strongly urge, therefore, upon Her Majesty’s Government that the recent recommendation of a Select Committee of the House of Commons in favour of the re transfer of the Persian Mission from the Foreign to the India Office should be at once attended to; and I would desire to see the best man of the Indian Political Service, one of the old type of Malcolm, and Elphinstone, and Sutherland, if such are now to be found, selected for the important post of Her Majesty’s Envoy and Minister atTeheran. The only instructions I would give to such a Minister would be, “ Make “ a personal friend of the Shah,” feeling satisfied that, if he were once established in a confidential position with His Majesty, he would have no difficulty in making his influence felt throughout the country, and in thus moulding its policy in conformity with the true interests of England and of Persia, which are, in fact, in all essential points, one and the same. Of course the Minister would require full support from the British Crown, both in regard to power and expenditure, but he must he mainly indebted for success to his personal character and to individual energy and address. I will only suggest, in conclusion, that if Officers should be sent to Persia on the scale recommended by Mr. Eastwick, which seems to me only reasonable, and suited to the object in view, the detachment should also convey to His Majesty a pair of Armstrong field guns, fully appointed, and some thousand stand of Enfield rifles, no longer required in India, which would certainly prove a most acceptable offering, and would give the necessary vclat to the employment of British Officers with the Persian Army. H. Rawlinson. 4th July 1871. I entirely agree in all Sir Henry Rawlinson says. H. B. E. Erere. 4th July 1871. I also fully and entirely concur. 5th July 1871. B. Montgomery. Appendix V, Instructions for Our trusty and well-beloved Major-General Sir Henry Creswicke liawlinson, Knight Commander of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath and Knight of the 1st Class of the Persian Order of the Lion and Sun, &amp;c., whom We have appointed Our Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Our good Brother the Shah of Persia. Given at Our Court at St. James, the twenty- fourth day of August 1859. We, reposing especial trust and eonfidence in your fidelity, prudence, ability, and zeal for Our service, have thought proper to appoint you to be Our Envoy Extra ordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Our good Brother the Shah of Persia, and to give you the following general instructions for your guidance:— 1st. As soon as you shall receive these Our instructions, together with Our letter of credence to the Shah of Persia, you will repair to the Court of the Shah, and, on your arrival, will demand an audience in the usual manner, at which you will deliver your credential letter; and you will add to the assurances therein given such further expressions as may tend to evince Our sentiments of esteem and regard for His Persian Majesty, and Our earnest desire to strengthen and improve the friendship and good understanding at present so happily subsisting between the two Crowns.

VICTORIA R. Appendix VI. Outline Sketch by Colonel Burne of the Shah of Persia’s Visit to England, 1873. In accordance with orders received from the Foreign Office, Sir Henry Rawlinson (accompanied by Sir Arnold Kemball, Captain Grey, and myself) left London for Brussels on the morning of the 14th June to welcome the Shah of Persia, on behalf of the British Government, and to accompany His Majesty to England. The Shah did not arrive at Brussels until 4 p.m. on the following Monday, 16th June. His reception was quiet and undemonstrative; he was, moreover, re ported to be unwell. About an hour after his arrival we were summoned to the Palace to have audience of the King of the Belgians and to be afterwards presented to the Shah. The King received us most graciously and cordially, and conversed with us in French for upwards of half an hour. I had met His Majesty before in 1864 at Calcutta, and he seemed pleased to refer back to his Indian tour. After taking leave of the King, we were conducted to the Shah, to whom we were each severally introduced. His Majesty seemed much pleased to see Sir Henry Rawlinson, who* addressed him in Persian, explaining the object of our mission and the cordial welcome which the Queen and the people of England were prepared to give him. The Shah was not at all well, but was able to attend a special performance at the Royal Opera in the evening. We all sat in full uniform next to the Royal box and enjoyed much the novelty of the occasion. It was contrary to etiquette to attach ourselves to the Shah’s suite at Brussels, so that on the following day we had nothing to do except to take part in a grand banquet and reception at the Palace in the evening, to which the King specially invited us. The day fixed for the departure of the Shah from Brussels for England was Wednesday, the 18th June. We were compelled to make an early start (5 a.m.), but the Shah, who was evidently becoming more accustomed to western habits, was more punctual than we expected, and we reached Ostend soon after 7 o’clock. We found H. M. S. “ Vigilant,” with other vessels, awaiting us under the orders of Rear Admiral Sir Leopold McClintock, and as everything was well arranged we had no delay or difficulty in getting His Majesty and suite on board. The Shah bid a cordial adieu to the Belgian authorities, and left the pier amidst loud cheers, apparently carrying away a very favourable impression of his brief visit to Belgium. We were extremely fortunate in the weather, for although it was windy and raining at Ostend we had not got many miles out into the channel before the sun shone brightly and the sea became as calm as a lake. About four miles from Ostend we were met by H. M. S. “Vanguard/* “ Audacious,” and “ Devastation.” These fine vessels convoyed us to the Channel Fleet, which we met about 2 p.m.. some miles out of Dover. It was formed up in two 3338. L1lilies under Admiral Sir Rodney Mundy, and received us witli a ro\al salute aiid manned yards, which had a very fine effect. The Shah showed great interest pleasure in all the novel sights around him during the whole journey. The men-of- war seemed specially to attract him. The Admiral signalled to the \ anguard and « Audacious ” to come close alongside and steam past us at full speed. I need not sav that this of itself was a sight worth remembering, and full of interest to the Persians. The “Devastation” followed their example, firing a salute on passing The Shah was very inquisitive as to the price, size, and armament of these ships, and wrote everything down in his diary.* He was delighted with the English sailors, who manned yards and cheered him heartily whenever they had a chance. After seeing the ships pass he was preparing to go into his cabin for his moi ning devotions when he heard hells tolling on hoard the men-of-war, and saw the sailors leaving the rigging. He was much surprised when we told him that the sailors nere also about to pcrloim their daily devotions, and that the tolling was the signal for morning prayers! We could not hut feel glad of a circumstance which showed a Mahomedan monarch the order, regularity, and discipline, observed in a British man-of-wai. Prom the moment that we met the Channel I leet till oui airival in Eondon wc passed through a series of new and exciting scenes. ‘ The impression of the sight of the fleet on the Shah’s mmd was effaced by his surprise and delight at the countless number of steamers and boats which came ^ out from Dover full of excursionists, welcoming and cheering him. He at first imagined that these people were sent by order of the English Government, and we had some difficulty in making him understand that they had all come out spontaneously to see him, at some cost and risk to themselves. His Mhjesty was quite delighted with this part of his journey. He was not aware till now what English cheering meant. He was pleased, amused, and tired in bowing his acknowledgments. ^ ^ The landing at Dover was a sight equally impressive. Thousands of well dressed people lined the cliffs, shore, and pier. As soon as the “ Vigilant ” was moored along side the pier, their Royal Highnesses the Duke of Edinburgh and Prince Arthur came on board accompanied by Earl Granville, Viscount Sydney, and others. They welcomed the Shah formally in the Queen’s name, and sat some time with His Majesty whilst the preparations for our landing were being made. The Shah first stepped on English ground about 3.30 p.m., on the 18th June, amidst hearty cheers, and after lunching at the “ Lord Warden ” Hotel and receiving an address from the Corpora tion, he left by special train for London. As we passed the Shorncliffe Camp the troops were all drawn out to salute the Shah. Many hundreds of people lined the railway embankments along the whole route from Dover to London. This fact, and the green and varied aspect of the country through which we passed, drew many expressions of admiration from the Persians and relieved the usual monotony of a railway journey. The Shah and suite were much surprised at the extent of London, so far as they could see it, as we entered it by the railway. They were still more so when we^ told them that the city contained more than four millions of people, or two thirds of the number of inhabitants in the entire kingdom of Persia. We did not arrive at the Charing Cross Railway Station till 7 p.m. Their Royal Highnesses the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge met the Shah at the station, and after the usual State reception we all left for Buckingham Palace, in a well arranged procession of royal carriages, through Whitehall and St. James s Park. Thousands^of people lined the streets, having waited for us for some hours with the greatest patience. Our unavoidable delay in arrival ensnared us into a smart shower of rain, which wetted every one to the skin, and marred the brilliancy of this part of the reception. ^ ^ • Prepared somewhat for the crowds of people by the Dover reception, the Persians were none the less pleased with their welcome to London, and the cordial “ sympathy, ’ as they expressed it, which the well dressed and orderly masses of people showed towards them. „ ^ . After arrival at Buckingham Palace the Shah took leave of tliejr Royal Highnesses the Princes, and the several high officers of Government, and retired to his own apart ments, very glad, probably, of a rest after his long day s work. On the following day, Thursday, the 19th, the Shah received the Corps Diplomatique and Her Majesty's Ministers at 'Buckingham Palace. He dined in the evening at Marlborough House with their Royal Highnesses the Prince and Princess of Wales, * Note .—This diary he afterwards published.135 and afterwards attended a ball at the Duke of Sutherland’s at Stafford House. The Shah remained here till midnight, and appeared pleased. On the next day, Friday, 20th June, His Majesty paid a State visit to the Queen at Windsor. We arrived at Windsor at 2 p.m., the whole town being in gala dress, and crowded with people. Never did the Castle or Park look more striking. At all times one of the most picturesque spots in England, yet the bright sunshine, the brilliancy of the uniforms, the freshness of the trees and grass after recent rain, gave the whole scene an additional beauty, which elicited expressions of great admiration from our guests. The Queen received the Shah and his uncles the Eoyal Princes most graciously at the foot of the grand staircase of the Castle, and walked with him to the State reception room, where Her Majesty at once invested him with the Order of the Garter in our presence. It had long been the Shah’s secret wish to obtain this Order, and he unmistakeably showed his gratification at receiving it. He himself in turn invested the Queen with a special decoration of the Order of the Lion and Star which he had brought from Persia. After this ceremony was concluded, the Queen passed through the assemblage of Persian Princes and suite, welcoming them all most graciously. The Shah and his suite expressed themselves much impressed with the Queen’s quiet and dignified bearing. Although the Shah was not generally popular amongst his suite, yet they all felt pleased with the kind reception accorded to His Majesty by the Queen. After luncheon the Queen spoke most graciously to several of us. She came up to me, and said she hoped I w T as better than when I was staying at Osborne in 1872. At 4 p.m. the Shah took leave of the Queen ; we drove through beautiful scenery to Virginia Water, and thence through the Park to the Windsor Railway Station finally reaching London again at 7 p.m. Thousands of people as usual lined the streets both going and coming, behaving in a most orderly manner, and cheering themselves hoarse. The Shah was reported to have said that he had been told so much of the rough channel and the rough English people that he had never expected to find the one as smooth as a pond and the other as well mannered as Persian nobles. It was indeed in this instance a truism, for during the whole fortnight of our constant drives through thousands of people night and day there was not a single disagreeable incident. The number of ladies and women of all kinds whom we saw freely mixing in the crowds surprised the Persians as much as anything else. It was so contrary to their own ideas of seclusion. The English women, full of curiosity and fun, mistook the “salaams” of the Persians (i.e., raising the hand to the face and bowing the head) for kissing of the hand, and they returned the salutation with peals of laughter and kissing of hands, which kept His Majesty and the Persians constantly amused and delighted. In the evening the Shan went to the Guildhall ball. The streets were as usual blocked with an orderly crowd, kept in hand by a few policemen, and the scene was brilliant in the extreme. To attempt to describe it in detail would only be tedious. The Lord Mayor received the Shah at the Guildhall door, and subsequently presented His Majesty with an address and the freedom of the City of London. Their Royal Highnesses the Prince and Princess of Wales, the Czarewitch and Czarevna, and many members of the English Royal Family, were present. On the following day, Saturday, 21st June, we drove to Woolwich to see the Arsenal and inspect the Royal Artillery. The day passed off very well; the Secretary of State for War (Mr. Cardwell) and the Duke of Cambridge conducted the Shah over the Arsenal, which was the object of much curiosity and interest, more especially the furnaces and steam hammers. The fine batteries of Royal Artillery, which were reviewed after luncheon, looked and moved remarkably well. The Shah rode one of his favourite Arabs at the review. W'e returned to London immediately after the review, and went to the Royal Italian Opera in the evening. Sunday the 22nd June was called a day of “repose,” and the Shah exercised his royal prerogative of upsetting all the private arrangements that were made for him, and fixing on his own place of amusement, the Zoo. Perhaps one of the most successful days of the whole visit, judging from the sub sequent remarks of the Persians, was the one wdiich included the inspection of the fleet at Spithead and the entertainment at the Albert Hall. We had to start at 9 a.m. for Portsmouth. His Majesty, although most strongly objecting to so early a rise.136 resigned himself to his fate when he was told that, to avoid a railway accident, it was an absolute necessity for kings to be early and punctual. To our great satisfaction, the weather was brilliantly fine. We started from Vauxhall station in the royal train, accompanied by the Prince and Princess of Wales, the Puke of Edinburgh, Prince Arthur, the Czarewitch and Czarevna, Prince Teck and Princess Mary of Cambridge, the Duke of Cambridge, and a large number of Staff and officials. On arrival at Portsmouth about noon we immediately went on board the Poyal Yacht “Victoria and Albert.” It was a memorable sight to see the magnificent British fleet of ironclads at anchor in two long lines, flanked by another line of gun boats. The lines extended nearly two miles at the Spithead anchorage. The line nearest the shore consisted of twenty-four gun-boats, the central line of eleven iron clads of the first division, and the third or outer line of twelve ironclads of the second division, including three turret ships ; a total of twenty-three ironclads and twenty- four gun-boats. The fine old ships the “ Victory,” “ St. Vincent,” “ Duke of Wellington,” “ Asia,” and “ Donegal ” were drawn up close to us, and saluted us as we embarked from the Dockyard. The names of the principal vessels of the fleet were as follows :— Inner Line. Central Line. Outer Line. Guns. Gans. Twenty-four Valiant - 18 Penelope - 11 Gun-boats. Zealous - 20 Caledonian - - 24 Hercules - 14 Black Pjince - 28 Hector - 18 Monarch - 6 Audacious - 14 Vanguard - - 14 Northumberland - 28 Achilles - 26 Afincourt - 28 Sultan - 12 Devastation - - 41 Turret- Glatton - 6 Hecate - 4/ ships. Cyclops - 4 G orgon - 4l Monitors. Royal Sovereign - o Prince Albert ‘ 4/ Hydra - - 4 We steamed up slowly through the line of ships, followed by the “ Enchantress,” which carried the Admiralty, the “ Simoon ” and “ Tamar ” with the Lords and Commons, and the “ Galatea,” Trinity House yacht. The whole fleet saluted us with one simultaneous roar, the sailors manning yards and cheering the Shah heartily as we passed each ship. After steaming slowly between the lines of ironclads, the Shah and the Boyal Princes visited the “ Agincourt ” and “ Sultan.’’ Sir Arnold Kemball and myself took the Persian Princes on board the “ Devastation ” and “ Agincourt,” and kept them on board the latter ship whilst it fired a salute. They all showed great intelligence in their inquiries and remarks. After the inspection we all landed at the Dockyard, and were sumptuously enter tained at luncheon by Admiral Sir Rodney Mundy; the Shah afterwards inspected the Dockyard, visited the “ Blonde ” ironclad under course of construction (which was from 'that time called the “ Shah ”), and finally left for London at 4 p.m., after a most delightful and instructive day. In the evening His Majesty visited South Kensington Exhibition and the Albert Hall, where 14,000 people in every variety of uniform and evening dress were seated. The sight was a magnificent one, and one which the Persians relished as a “ spec tacle ” more than any other they had seen during their visit. The Shah sat with the Prince and Princess of Wales and others of the Royal Eamily, and the Czarewitch and Czarevna, in a line of seats arranged in front of the boxes. He was the object of much attention—much more so than the music. We all stood behind him on a crimson platform. The military review of the following day at Windsor was no less successful than the other scenes of the visit. The morning w^as heavy and threatening, but the weather fortunately cleared up towards the afternoon. On arrival at Windsor, the Shah drove to the Castle, where he was cordially received by the Queen. The Queen drove on to the review ground at a little past 4 p.m. The Shah and the Royal Princes rode on horseback.137 The troops on the ground numbered about 10,000 men, under the immediate command of General Lord Strathnairn. They consisted of,— 2 batteries, Royal Horse Artillery. 2 regiments, Life Guards. The Royal Horse Guards. 6th Dragoon Guards. 7th Hussars. 13th Hussars. 2 field batteries. 3 battalions of Grenadier Guards. 2 battalions of Coldstream Guards. 1 battalion of Scots Fusilier Guards. 7th Fusiliers. 16th Regiment. 93rd Highlanders. 1st Battalion of Rifle Brigade. The troops looked remarkably well, and marched and manoeuvred very satisfactorily. Thousands of people from all parts of England flacked to Windsor to see the review, and every available plot of ground was taken up with a series of temporary stands and platforms, which gave a very picturesque effect to the ground. After the review, the Shah presented the Duke of Cambridge with a handsome sword, and expressed his thanks to Lord Strathnairn. After the Shah had taken leave of Her Majesty at Windsor Castle, we left by special train for London, reaching Paddington station at 9*15 p.m. His Majesty was unable to dine as arranged with Lord Granville, but attended a reception afterwards at the Foreign Office. The following day, Wednesday, was spent in a trip down the Thames to Greenwich, where the Shah was entertained at a dejeuner given by the First Lord of the Admiralty, Mr. Goschen. It is not too much to say that this was the most instructive sight of the whole -visit. The Shah visited the docks and shipping in the Thames, of the magnitude of which he, and indeed we ourselves, had no idea. He was visibly excited and surprised, not only at the vast quantity of shipping and size of the vessels, but at the cordial reception given to him by the myriads of people, who lined the whole shore from London to Greenwich, and filled every ship and boat that could under any excuse be pressed into service. There was a State ball at Buckingham Palace in the evening. On Thursday, the 26th June, the Shah proceeded on a visit to Lancashire. As Sir Arnold Kemball, Captain Grey, and myself remained behind in London with the Persian Princes, I can say no more of this visit than that it was described as very successful. The Shah returned much pleased with all he had seen, speaking more particularly of his reception at Manchester, and his appreciation of the Duke of Sutherland’s magnificent hospitality at Trentham. During the absence of the Shah we worked very hard at our large correspondence, which consisted of begging letters and petitions, and we took the Princes to the Bank, Telegraph Office, “Times” office, British Museum, and other places of interest. To give some idea of the style of correspondence which was showered upon us, and which we had carefully to record and answer when possible, I may be pardoned for quoting a few examples out of many. One clergyman wrote :— «May it please Your Majesty to us a donation of a few sovereigns towards our Sunday School children’s treat, for such is the custom of kings.” A lady adopted another argument, and said :— “ I am in real distress, and the only plan of relief I can hit upon is for your Majesty to give me a diamond, for which I shall be for ever grateful.” Another gentlemen of a poetic turn of mind wrote :— “ When Asia’s diamond crested Royal Shah Dazzled all Europe from his railway car, The nations in a friendly social ring Formed one vast, empire round the Persian King. Each laid its capital in tribute meet A kindly offering at the Monarch’s feet.” Another person sent a very ill-written book, and thus expressed himself:— “ I am one of the working classes whose lamp shines every night on every ocean and railway throughout the world, and therefore offer my book to your Majesty for the benefit of the people of Persia.” An enterprising tradesman wrote : — “ Hearing that the Shah suffers from headache every night from his head-dress; may I solicit your powerful influence to enable me to make a lighter one.” 3338 . M mAnother clergyman sent a hook of his own as to the Restoration of the Jews, and ndded:— “ T have sent this hook as show ing the approaching Restoration of the Jews • it might touch the heart of the benevolent and intelligent Shah, like Cvrus of old* to he instrumental with the Sultan of Turkey for the furtherance of this great and ^ood work.” 5 Another memorial from a clergyman ran thus :— “May it please your Majesty. As one of the favoured subjects of Queen Victoria, I share the universal interest attached to your Majesty’s visit, but I enjov the still higher privilege of being a subject of the King of Kings and Lord J of Lords.” I merely quote these few extracts from a mass of letters, as showing the style of correspondence which we received. The demands for money were unceasing.* His Majesty received a great deal of advice, especially from clergymen, whilst a &lt;*reat many photographs and valueless presents were sent to him in hopes of a more weighty return „ The Shah returned to London on Saturday morning, 28th June, from Trentham and we attended at a garden party at Chiswick the same afternoon given by their Royal Highnesses the Prince and Princess of Wales. Her Majesty the Queen was present, and both weather and arrangements contributed to its success. The Shah visited the Crystal Palace on Monday, the 30th instant. Although the arrangements were perfect and the scene very fine, much of the enjoyment and more of the fireworks were spoilt by an unlucky downfall of rain. The Czarewitch was oddly enough, hissed by the crowds outside the Palace w^hen he showed himself on the balcony. A popular idea had got about that he had come over during the Shah’s visit to act as a spy. The remainder of the w'eek was spent in comparative quietness. The Shah received mary distinguished members of the Lords and Commons, gave audience to numerous deputations, visited the City and its principal institutions, and saw the w^orkino* of the Lire Brigade at Buckingham Palace. The last day of festivities was marked by a garden party at Argyll Lod^e given to the Shah by the Duke of Argyll. The afternoon was very fine and bright 3 and as the arrangements were all that could be desired the Shah enjoyed himself, and expressed himself much gratified. ' ^ 1 Finally, the Shah icit London at 10 a.m. on the morning of Saturday, the 5th Julv for France via Portsmouth. ' * Their Royal Highnesses the Prince and Priucess of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge took leave of His Majesty at Victoria Station. Their Royal Highnesses the Duke of* Edinburgh and Prince Arthur accompanied him to Portsmouth. On arrival at the Dockyard His Majesty immediately embarked on board the French steamer hopine, and took leave of us all. Me lunched afterwards with the Admiral, and left by special train for London with the Duke of Edinburgh and Prince Arthur. There appeared to be real and sincere regret on the part of the Persians at leaving a country where they had been magnificently entertained and cordially welcomed Many of them wished to prolong their visit, and finally left with many protestations of coming back again. We did not share this feeling, as we felt for the moment that we bad had quite enough of a good thing. The Shah gave us all presents of different kinds. To myself he presented a diamond ring with Ins crow n and initials on it, which by the Secretary of State’s permission I w r as allow r ed to retain as a memento. ‘ Those who understand Asiatics can appreciate the moral effect of the Shah’s visit. The stories of England's greatness and power will probably go through Persia with many exaggerations, and may serve us in good stead at some future tune amongst a people who attach much importance to moral influence and prestige. Eor this reason I was glad to be able to take about some of the Persian visitors under my special charge to see sights of which they had no previous conception. It ma^ be fairly hoped that what was seen of the apparent happiness and freedom of the people, the riches and prosperity of the land, and the absence of oppression may have its civilizing effects on minds evidently impressionable. The Shah witnessed , m England what he never could see elsewhere; and whilst he had every enjoyment139 it was possible to give him, a strict line of propriety was drawn in matters which were not so well cared for in Russia and elsewhere. The Grand Vizier, Mirza Hussein Khan, appeared to be a clever man, although he made a mistake in pushing himself so much before the Royal Princes, who will 'some day intrigue against him.* 1 he G. C. S. I. was conferred on the Vizier, which seemed to give him great gratification, although it aroused some jealousy on the part of the Princes. It seems a pity that we have no decoration in England of a general nature, without statute limitations, which could be given to Eastern visitors. Our Persian guests, like many others, received numerous decorations from Russia, Austria, Germany, and Prance, but left England empty-handed and disappointed for want of a ribbon and a cross. 16th July 1873. q &lt;p. B. Appendix VII. Note by Colonel Burne on the Persian Army, 20th December 1871. As regards the military force of Persia, which is said to amount to 100,000 men, it no doubt combines, in many respects, excellent material; but the militarv system of the country is such as to neutralize all the good qualities of the individual soldiers, i he military grades of the army are, it is said, filled up through favour or bribery. I here is a total want of capacity amongst officers in command j they have neither knowledge of military affairs, reliance on themselves, nor confidence in their men. They fly in the hour of battle, and defeat the efforts of the few European instructors who have been, or who may ever be, attached to the army. Although the Persian regiments are trained somewhat after the European manner, and taught by a number of instructors of different European nations, their labours are, we are told, almost wholly thrown away, by the habit which prevails of granting whole regiments, already kept years in arrears of pay, six or eight months’ leave of absence at a time, on condition of relinquishing their claims to those arrears. In the year 1812, when British Officers were attached to the Persian army, at that time actively engaged in warfare against the Russians, Sir Gore Ouseley, our repre sentative at Teheran, ordered them not to take any further part in the operations. On the entreaty, however, of the Crown Prince and his Ministers, the English Ambassador, we are told, permitted two of the British Officers (Lieutenant Lindsay and Captain Christie) and 13 Sergeants to remain in the Persian camp. The scene that occurred almost directly afterwards at the action of Ooslandooz is amusingly described in Watson’s History of Persia. M hilst Captain Christie was preparing to charge the Russian troops, he was ordered by the Prince to retire, but, when he sent a Sergeant to represent to that potentate the impropriety of doing so, and the necessity of annihilating the small number of men opposed to him, the Prince completely lost his temper, abused the nation of the officer who was exposing his life in his service, himself galloped to the soldiers, and, seizing their colours, ordered them to run away. The Persian artillery was for a time ineffective from want of ammunition, but fortunately recouped itself by the gallantry of Lieutenant Lindsay, who, at the head of a few o*f his men, made a dash into the enemy’s camp, and succeeded in carrying off a few rounds of ammunition. After general defeat and confusion from the above causes, the Prince ordered two guns to be taken to the top of a high hillock, from which it was impossible to use them to advantage, and afterwards directed them to be brought down to the base of the hill fort, into the ditch of which 11 out of 13 guns soon fell disabled. The Russian troops carried everything before them. Captain Christie lost his life, and the Prince’s army was totally annihilated, the result being the peace of Gulistan, which ceded all the rights of Persia over Georgia, the Caucasus, and other provinces, and obliged her to renounce her right of maintaining a navy in the Caspian. *•' The instance here cited may of course be exceptional, but still, at a later period, in 1838, we had occasion to remove our British Officers, who had disciplined the Shah’s army, on account of the aggression of Persia against Herat; and so it ever will happen.

He is now again Prime Minister.140 Officers, or put them in false positions, until we can bind Persia to a totally new system of external policy or internal military administration. In Sir J. W. Kaye’s Life of Major LTArcy Todd is an instructive account of the treatment of our officers and the state of army affairs generally in Persia between 1833 and 1838. Major D’Arcy Todd, who was sent to Persia in 1833 to assist in instructing the Persian artillery, thus wrote after a year’s residence in the country :— &lt;c I consider the “ Persian appointment as sheer humbug; the climate is the only desirable thing in « the country. The people, especially those about Government, are a lying, deceitful, “ procrastinating, faithless race. I would never have left Cawnpore had I known, “ what I now know, of the prospects of officers in Persia.” Sir J. W. Kaye adds a Note “ The position of the English Officers at the Persian “ head-quarters* was always very embarrassing, as they were only recognised by the “ Persian Government in the quality of instructors, and were not allowed to interfere “ with the interior economy of the regiments to which they were attached, nor “ exercise any of the functions of command. In the provinces, however, the local “ Governors, being independent of Court influence, and caring little for the jealousies “ 0 f Native commanders, sometimes conferred much more extensive powers on the “ British Officers attached to their service; Major Earrant, for instance having had “ full authority over the cavalry corps at Zenjan, and Major Rawlinson having been “ placed in military command of the province of Kermanshah. In former times “ Abbas Mirza had always placed the British Officers in real command of his troops, “ and Majors Christie, Hart, and Lindsay had thus often leu the Persians to battle “ against the Hussians ; and in the same way, in 1835,the latter Officer, who had now “ become Major-General Sir Henry Bethune, was entrusted by the Shah with fuL “ authority over the expeditionary force sent to the south of Persia ; but these were “ exceptions to the general rule.” Major D’Arcy Todd’s account of the events of 1835, consequent on the death of Shah Futteh Ali and the usurpation of several claimants to the throne, is somewhat amusing. He says that he and the British detachment were at Khoi, near Tabrez, employed in drilling four regiments of infantry and artillery. They were ordered to march on Teheran, 'and he thus describes the course of operations :— “ We approached within five or six marches of Teheran without meeting with the slightest opposition; on the contrary our numbers were augmented at every step. Mahomed Shah was everywhere acknowledged as King, and the chances of opposition seemed to diminish as we approached the capital. The Zil-i-Sultan was not, however, wholly inactive. A force of four or five thousand men, with seven guns and fifty swivels, was despatched against us under the command of Imaum Verdee Mirza, one of the Zil’s half brothers. This force advanced boldly until it came within one march of our camp, and then retreated before us, keeping at the same time a respectful distance. After trifling for a few days in this manner, whilst we were advancing at the rate of fourteen or fifteen miles a day, Imaum Yerdee Mirza deserted the cause of his brother, and came into our camp, his safety having been guaranteed by the Russian and English Envoys. His train of artillery, ammunition, swivels, &amp;c., were given into our hands the next day, his cavalry swelled our numbers, and the rest of his followers dispersed. A second force, accompanied by a much larger train of artillery, advanced from the city, but gave themselves up without firing a shot. So much for Persian bravery. In the meantime, the Zil-i-Sultan was seized and confined to his palace by one of the nobles in Teheran, and the gates of the city were thrown open to receive Mahomed Shah. We did not, however, enter the palace for some days. The astrologers could not fix upon an auspicious hour for the royal entry, and we therefore pitched our camp near the garden palace of Negaristan, in which the King took up his temporary abode. Thus ended our first bloodless campaign. In former days this farce would have been succeeded by a tragedy; heads would have been lopped off by the hundred, and eyes would have been plucked out by the bushel— vide Aga Mahomet’s conduct 50 years ago—but the young King has behaved on the present occasion admirably. His late opponents have been dealt with in the most lenient manner, and many of them have in consequence become his staunch friends and supporters.” Maior D’Arcy Todd describes the difficulties of his position as follows :— « I'am the only Officer,” he wrote, “ left at head-quarters with the Colonel, but my “ situation with the artillery is exceedingly ill-defined, and the duty I perform is- “ disagreeable to myself and of no benefit to the Government. I have been detained141 « at Teheran for the avowed purpose of being placed in command of the artillery, but « week after week and month after month has passed away, and I am at the present “ moment (18th March 1835) precisely in the situation in which I found myself on “ my arrival at Teheran twelve months ago, employed in doing nothing.” In a conference which Major Todd had with the Prime Minister, all he could get out of him was as follows :— “ The two Topshee-Bashees (Commandants of Artillery) had been sent for; one of them, Sohrab Khan, of the Irak artillery, was present; the other, Hajee Iskunder Khan, of the Azerhijan Artillery, had come, but had shrunk away again when he entered the room. ‘That’s Todd Sahib, is it?’ snivelled out the Kaim-Makam. ‘ Todd Sahib, you must have charge of the artillery, and you must drill them well. &lt; Sohrab Khan, you must attend to what Todd Sahib says to you ; mind, you must be ‘ very particular' Todd Sahib, you must.’ Here the oration was broken off by the entrance of somebody, or by some other subject presenting itself to the mind of the speaker; perhaps some fond recollection of stewed feet came across him at the moment! However, Todd Sahib and his concerns were consigned to oblivion. We trifled away about an hour in this manner.” Major Todd mentions an amusing incident connected with Persian artillery target practice. He says in one of his letters,— «This reminds me of an answer given to he by Mahomed Shah’s Wuzeer, one Mirza Mahomed, a great oaf. I had been superintending some artillery practice at Teheran. A jackass having been placed as the target, I remonstrated against the cruelty of putting up one of God’s creatures as a mark, when wood or canvas would answer every purpose. The Wuzeer replied, ‘ On my eyes be it! I will stick up a pony next time !’ as if I had specially pleaded the case of jackasses.” In the autumn of 1836 Major Todd was residing at Tabrez as Military Secretary to Major General Bethune, w r ho then commanded in Persia the legions disciplined by the English Officers, but in consequeuce of the Persian operations against Herat in 1838, which was disapproved by the British Government, the English Officers were, as said before, withdrawn, and none have since that period been sent to that country. As a matter of military administration only, there is no doubt that if the Shah were induced to give British Officers high status and absolute control in Ms army, our misgivings might he somewhat removed; but the rulers of Persia have not grown wiser from past experience. And that to this day the Shah’s army is in reality less effective, either for the purposes of defence or offence, than if it w r ere not drilled after the fashion of European armies at all, is a fact wffiich, I fear, can hardly he con troverted.Appendix Abstract of Events in Persia, Afghanistan, Date. Persia. Afghanistan. Ante 1722 Under Suffavean dynasty the Persian Empire ex tended to the Oxus and included Herat and Candahar, Persian Gulf, &amp;c.; but in 1722 Turkey obtains possession of Georgia, Azerbijan, and Kurdistan, and the Iman of Muscat establishes her sovereignty over the Persian Gulf. Herat and Candahar also throw off Persian allegiance, whilst Meer Mahmood of Candahar advances to Ispahan and assumes an Afghan sovereighty over Persia which lasts from 1722 to 1730. Up to the beginning of 1700 Herat and Canda har are in the possession of Persia, whilst Cabul is included in the Mogul Empire of Delhi. This distribution of Afghanistan had continued almost uninterruptedly for two centuries. At brief and distinct intervals Candahar had been occupied by the Moguls, but, at the commence ment of the 18th century, it had been for 60 years in the possession of the Shahs of Persia. At length, in 1720, Candahar, under Meer Mahomed, becomes a great power, and Persia is convulsed with successive invasions from it. In 1722 the Afghans besiege Ispahan, and from that year to 1730 Afghan (Candahar) sove reignty is extended over Persia as previously mentioned. 1730-47 Nadir Shah rises to power in Persia, drives the Afghans out of that country, and extends his empire over all the countries (including Afghan istan) between Persia and the Indus. In 1739 he invades India, orders a general massacre at Delhi (in which 150,000 persons perish) and car ries away treasure amounting to 125,000,000/. sterling. He is assassinated at Meshed in 1747. Afghanistan comes under the rule of Nadir Shah, who drives the Afghans entirely out of Persia. In 1737 he conquers the province of Candahar and at once becomes master of all Afghan and Sikh countries west of the Indus. Nadir Shah transplants 12,000 Persian families to Cabul and places them in the Bala Hissar, where they still remain by the name of Kuzzil-bashes or Red caps. 1747-60 Revolutionary period in Persia ending in the esta blishment of the Zend dynasty. In 1747 Afghanistan throws off the Persian yoke, and is formed into a single Empire under Ahmed Shah, of Candahar, a Chief of the Suddozais. Ahmed Shah wrests Cabul from the Persians. In 1752 he concludes a treaty with the Mogul Emperor of Delhi, obtaining for Afghanistan all the provinces of the Punjab which Nadir Shah had conquered, including Cashmere. The Indus and the Sutlej agreed upon as the line of demarkation between the Mogul and Afghan Empires. Under Ahmed Shah the limits of the Afghan Empire are,—north, Oxus ; south. Sea of Oman; east, Thibet and rivers Sutlej and Indus ; west, Khorassan, Persia proper and Kerman. At this time the capital of Afghanistan is Candahar. 1760-94 Zend dynasty in Persia, during which the country is more or less distracted with civil war. In 1773 Timur Shah transfers the capital of Afghan istan from Candahar to Cabui. Balkh and Akcheh revolt from Afghanistan in the same year. 1794-97 Reign of Agha Mahomed, the first Kajar Sovereign. In 1794 the capital of the Persian Empire is transferred from Shiraz to Teheran. Agha Ma homed tacitly relinquishes all claim to Afghan territory. He dies in 1797. Same as before. 1797-1834 Reign of Futteh Shah, the second Kajar Sovereign. 1800, Malcolm’s first Mission to Persia takes place, and he concludes Treaty of 1801, to prevent Afghan invasion of India, and to accomplish ex clusion of French from Persia, on condition of the English assisting the Shah with military stores, In 1800—3 Mahomed Shah, son of Timur, supported by Barakzaies, reigns. In 1803-9 he is deposed, and is imprisoned in the Bala Hissar. Shah Shuja, his brother, succeeds him, and is enthusi astically welcomed by the people. In 1809 revolt takes place again, and Shah Shuja, who flies to&amp;c., from 1722 to the present period. Herat, Candahar, Seistan, and their Dependencies. In 1707 Candahar breaks out in re bellion against Persia, and in 1713 Meer Vais, a Ghilzai Chief, is accepted by all the leading Candahar families as independent ruler of that place. The Abdalis of Herat, about 1716, likewise throw off the Persian yoke, and declared their independence under their Abdali Chief, Assad-ul-lah. He is killed in 1720, -when Herat falls temporarily into the hands of a Beluch Chieftain, of Seistan, named Meer Mahomed. England in the East. Possessed limited settlements Calcutta, Madras, &amp;c.

In 1747 Ahmed Shah recovers Herat and Candahar, and, indeed, all Afghan istan, from Persian sovereignty. The Mogul Empire of Delhi begins to decline, and war is at its height between the English and French in Southern India. In 1751 Clive takes Arcot. In 1757 the battle of Plassy takes place. In 1759 the French lose all their power, and British supremacy in India is established. Had made no progress, although Peter the Great, who died in 1725, left on record a large scheme of Eastern conquest, which has from that date formed the charter of Russian designs in the East. The Czar frames ambitious projects eastwards, and possesses himself during the anarchy in Persia at this period of certain portions of the north-western frontier of Persia. Herat and Candahar remain under the suzerainty of the sons of the Afghan ruler of Cabul. England obtains Bengal. In 1772 Warren Hastings Governor of Bengal. War takes place with Hyder Ali. In 1791 Bangalore is taken, and English supremacy strengthened in southern India. In 1783 Georgia transfers its alle giance from Persia to Russia. Georgia is re-conquered by Agha Mahomed, the Persian Shah, in 1796. Same as before. Same as before. 1800, Feroz-ud-din obtains Herat from his brother, Mahmood Shah, of Cabul, and rules it virtually as an independent Chief. From 1800 the Persians make several unsuccessful attacks on Herat. Feroz-ud-din is succeeded in 1817 by In 1808-9 the Emperor Napoleon and the Czar Alexander agree upon a joint expedition to India through Persia.

Persia. &amp;c., in case of attack. In 1813 war takes place between Persia and Russia, ending in Treaty of Gulistan, by which Persia cedes large tracts of country to Russia on her north-western frontier. In 1825-27 war is renewed between Persia and Russia, ending in 1828 in the Ireaty of Turko- manchaie, by which Persia cedes the provinces of Erivan and Nukshwan, at great loss to herself, agreeing to the line of frontier which now exists. During the reign of Futteh Shah from 1800 onwards—several unsuccessful expeditions are launched against Herat, in fact, for the first time since the siege of Nadir Shah Persia struggles for, but fails to regain, the sovereignty of that place. Whilst Persia is involved in protracted war with Russia during Futteh Shah’s reign, by which she / loses many provinces, the relations between the I Court of Persia and the English Government are drawn closer. In 1814 a Ireaty, first framed in 1809, is ratified by the British Government, by which the Shah engages to prevent the passage of European armies through his dominions towards India, whilst the English bind themselves to assist him with troops, or a subsidy, in event of an European invasion of Persia. This stipulation being found inconvenient by the English Govern ment, they purchase its abrogation in 1828 for a sum of 80,000*., and British influence at the Persian Court visibly declines. In 1821-23 Persia is involved in a war with Turkey. In 1829 the Russian Mission (25 persons) is massacred at Teheran by the populace. Futteh Ali Shah dies in 1834. Mahomed Shah succeeds his father, Futteh Ali Shah, as third Kajar sovereign of Persia, and is crowned at Teheran in January 1835. He comes much under Russian influence, whilst British in fluence is very weak. Instigated by Russia, Mahomed Shah once more turns attention to the extension of the Persian empire eastwards, and Herat, which had, during the quarrels between the Barakzais and Suddazais, acknowledged alternately the suzerainty of Persia and Cabul as expediency necessitated, becomes the centre of attraction. Ma homed Shan further lays claim to all Afghanistan as far as Ghuznee ; also to Seistan, over which Yui Mahomed of Herat had established sovereignty. In 1837-38 commences the celebrated nine months siege of Herat, ending in the defeat of the Persian army through the indomitable defence conducted by Eldred Pottiuger, and the demon stration in the Persian Gulf made by the British Government. Aggressions are also made on Beluchisian. Mahomed Shah dies on the 4th September 1848, after reigning 14 years. Afghanistan. India, takes refuge at Loodiaaa. Mahmood again obtains possession of the throne. In 1811 Cash- mere throws off its Afghan allegiance, is again brought under subjection, although from this date the Sikhs had more control over it than Afghan istan. In 1818 occurs the downfall of Mahmood Shah, who settles at Herat under Persian suzerainty. Shah Shujah attempts to regain power, but is compelled by the Barakzaies again to retreat into British India. 1818, Dost Mahomed Khan, the Barakzai, rises to power, and the Barak zai faction gradually extinguishes the Suddozai dynasty. In 1822 the Sikhs under Runjeet Singh revolt from Afghan suzerainty. They take Mooltan, Dera Ghazee, Khan and Cash- mere, and assert their right of sovereignty over Peshawur. From 1826 to 1832 Afghanistan is in disorder. The Barakzaies under Dost Mahomed exercise chief rule, but dread the arrival of Shah Shuja from India to drive them from their usurped authority, and also dread the recovery of Afghan istan with Persian aid by Shah Kamran (son of Mahmood Shah), of Herat. Afghanistan is at this period under three or four separate governments. Dost Mahomed reigns at Cabul, his brother rules at Candahar, whilst Herat is held by the last representative of the Suddozais, Kamran, son of Mahomed, and his Vizier, Yar Mahomed Khan. In 1834 Shah Shuja makes another effort to recover his power in Af ghanistan, and advances with a large army from Loodiana against Candahar. He is, however, defeated, and compelled once more seek refuge at Loodiana. On 1st May 1837 a battle takes place at Jumx-ood between the Sikhs and Afghans, ending in the defeat of the former. The defeat of Runjit Singh by Dost Mahomed, and the siege of Herat, attracts the serious attention of the British Government, who send Burnes to Cabul on a Mission, which fails. In 1838 the British Government resolves to restore Shah Shuja to power in Afghanistau, concludes a treaty with him and Runjit Singh, by which Shah Shujah agrees to restore Peshawur to the Sikhs, and Runjit Singh to assist in dethroning Dost Ma homed. In January 1839 the British advance on Candahar, with an army of 21,000 men and a contingent under Shah Sbuja. In April 1840 the British army takes possession of Can dahar, and Shah Shuja is crowned at that place as ruler of Afghanistan. On the 10th of May Ghuznee is taken by storm. On the 22nd July 1840 Dost Mahomed flies to Bokhara, and the Anglo-British enter Cabul without opposition in the following month. The cause ofl Shah Shuja is at first popular in Afghanistan, but the cruelty of certain new measures introduced, and the preaching of the mollahs against the encroaching tendencies of the English, turn the feeling in a different direction.145 Herat, Candahar, Seistan, and their Dependencies.

Treaty also concluded between Persia and the British Government in same year (but not ratified till 1814), by which offensive and defensive alliance with the Shah of Persia is concluded as already described. During this period English conquest over Southern India is extended. In 1799 Sering- apatam is taken, and Mysore par titioned. In 1800 the Carnatic is conquered. In 1803 the Mahratta war takes place, t celebrated by Wellington’s first great victory, Assaye. In 1804-5 Holkar is de feated, and Bhurtpore taken. In 1805 occurs the sepoy mutiny at Vellore. In 1814-15 the war with Nipal takes place. In 1817-18 the successful Pindaree war. In 1826 a war with Burmah is ended with a large accession of territory. The year 1829 is marked by abolition of suttee. In 1834 Coorg is annexed. Elizabethpol, 1813. By the peace of Gulistan Persia formally cedes Georgia, Mingrelia, parts of Talish, &amp;c., and agrees to maintain no navy on the Caspian. In 1828, by the Treaty of Turkomanchaie, Russia obtains the existing Perso-Russian frontier, as before mentioned, and also the right (Commercial Treaty) of Russian subjects provided with passports in due form to trade throughout the whole exrent of the Persian Empire, and to “ proceed “ to the States adjoining the said “ kingdom.” In 1830 Yar Mahomed Khan succeeded to the post of Vizier under Shah Kamran, and obtained supreme autho rity, under the nominal leadership of Kamran. In 1834 be subjugated Seistan Afghanistan. In 1838-39 Major Pottinger continued for some time to hold his own at that place. He found, however, his position so un satisfactory that, in July 1834, he left, and was succeeded by Major Todd. That officer concluded a treaty with Shah Kamran, in which the indepen dence of Herat was guaranteed by the British Government, on condition that the Herat Government should cany on no correspondence with any other State except through the British Envoy. [AWe.—This has always been an important point in British diplomacy in the East. It was omitted in the treaty with Cashmere, and still re mains to be pressed on Nipal and Burmah, and other outlying States.] Intrigues at Herat rapidly followed, and the English received no return for the money lavished at that place. Yar Mahomed commenced open intrigue with Persia, and also pressed for the presence of a Russian Agent at Herat. Ultimately Major Todd unwisely re tired to Candahar; thereupon Yar Mahomed murdered Shah Kamran, and assumed uncontrolled power. Eventually, in 1841, he concluded an alliance with Cabul by giving his The English Government, in 1834-42, was involved in war with Afghan istan, as described in that column. On 27 th June 1839 Run jit Singh, ruler of the Punjab, dies. In 1843 occurs the Sindh war, by which Sindh is annexed to the British Empire. In 1845 the Gwalior war takes place, when the battles of Maharanpoor and Punniar are fought and Gwalior taken. In 1846-49 occurs the first and second Sikh wars. In March 1849 the Punjab is formally annexed to the British Crown, and Dhuleep Singh, grandson of Rangit Singh, is pen sioned. The English power in India is at this time at its zenith. The influence gained at Teheran by Russia after the Treaty of Turco- manchai lead her, for the first time, into further ambitious schemes, having for their end active inter ference with British interests in the East. Count Simonich, the Russian Ambassador at Teheran, instigates Persia to attack Herat, and openly aids the Shah in this object. He concludes also a treaty with the Sirdars of Candahar, guaranteeing to them, under Russian seal, the possession of Herat and Candahar under nominal Persian suzerainty. This leads to the serious intervention of the British Government, ending in explanations in which the Russian Government (taken aback by their unexpected non-success at Herat) disavow the proceedings- of their ambassador and retire from the position which had been taken up (Colonel Burne’s His torical Summary of 30th April 1874, pp. 4, 5). To make up for their failure, the Russian Govern ment plan, in 1839-40, an expedi tion against Khiva, which results in utter failure. Iu 1844 the Em peror Nicholas visits England, and strengthens the alliance between England and Russia. 3338. 0 o146 Date. Persia. Afghanistan. In November 1840 Dost Mahomed makes an effort to attack Cabul, but being defeated he surrenders, and is sent a prisoner to Fort William. Shah Shujah now turns against his protectors, and suggests that they should leave Afghanistan; at this time also to reduce the heavy expenses of the war, many of the subsidies given by the English to Afghan Sirdars are withdrawn. Throughout 1841 the discontent rapidly increases, but rumours of conspiracy formed by the B&amp;rkazaies are disre garded by Sir W. Macnaughten, the British Envoy. In October 1841 a reduction of Rs. 40,000 is made in the subsidies to the Ghilzai Chiefs, when they break out into open revolt. General Sale leaves Cabul to reopen communication with Jellalabad. The revolt, which assumes a religious aspect, in creases throughout Afghanistan. The British troops arc imprudently scattered at Cabul, Ghuzni, Kelat-i-Ghilzai, Chareekar, Candahar, Jellalabad, and other places. No attempt is made to strengthen the British position at Cabul, and ill feeling is increased by undisguised and notorious intrigues be tween the British Officers and Afghan women of note. On 2nd November 1841 open insurrection at Cabul breaks out, which, through the apathy of Genera] Elphinstone, is allowed to assume large proportions. Sir W. Macnaughten is treacherously murdered on 23rd December 1841 by Mahomed Akbar Khan, and the British forces retreat from Cabul on 6th January 1842, after a humiliation which had lasted 65 days. Thus ends the well known destruction of the British army by the Ghilzais of the Khoord Cabul Pass. On the 10th of January, out of 4,500 fighting men and 12,000 camp followers which had left Cabul four days before, and reached Gundamak almost decimated, only one man (Dr. Brydon) escapes to Jellalabad. During this time the ladies and children of the force and married Officers become captives in the hands of Mahomed Akbar Khan. Shah Shuja is apparently implicated in these proceedings. General Pollock forces the Khyber Pass, and relieves Sale’s force at Jellalabad in April 1842. Meanwhile the force at Candahar is saved by the energy and ability of Nott and Major (now Sir H.) Rawlinson. By a marvellous display of promptitude they hold their own until relieved by General England in the following May. Cabul is involved in revolution, in which, in February 1842, Shah Shuja is murdered, and is temporarily succeeded by his son Futteh Sing. In September 1842 Pollock marches on from Gundarnak, defeats the Ghilzais, and on the 16th of that month takes possession of Cabul ; Nott at the same time advances from Candahar, and in passing through Ghuzni brings away the celebrated gates of Somnauth, which Mahomed had carried off from Guzerat in the 11th century, On the 17th he joins Pollock’s force at Cabul. The captives are recovered, the Cabul Bazaar destroyed as a mark of retribution, and on 12th October 1842 the British force leaves Cabul for India, accompanied by Futteh Sing, who feels that he cannot maintain himself un aided at Cabul. Dost Mahomed is in the meantime set at liberty, and is received by the people of Cabul (after a banishment of three years) as Ameer. In the Sikh war which follows (1845-46) Dost Mahomed openly assists the Sikhs against the British, on condition of their restoring Peshawar to Afghanistan. The Sikhs are, however, defeated. In 1846 Dost Mahomed concludes an alliance with Herat, but cannot subjugate Candahar.

England in the East. Russia in Central Asia.148 Persia. Mahomed Shah is succeeded by his eldest son, Nasir- ud-Deen, the present Shah. In 1851 Persia takes advantage of the submissive attitude of the ruler of Herat towards her to occupy that city, and only relinquishes her position at the remonstrances of Colonel Sheil, who brings about an agreement (1853) by which the Persian Government engages not to send troops to Herat unless that city be attacked by a foreign force. On the 26th October | 1856 Persia, in violation of the agreement of 1853, [ throws an army into Herat, a breach of her engage- | ments which Her Majesty’s Government resents by , a declaration of war (1st November), and the i occupation of the island of Kharrack, in the Persian | Gulf. The war between Persia and England is put a stop to by the Treaty of Paris (4th March 1857), which cancels all previous engagements with Persia, except the Slave Trade Convention of 1851. By this treaty Persia is required to re linquish all claims to sovereignty over the territory and city of Herat and the countries of Afghanistan, and to refer questions of dispute between that kingdom and herself to the British Government for adjustment before having recourse to arms. In July 1857 Her Majesty’s Mission, which had been withdrawn from Teheran in November 1855, is reinstated in the Persian capital. In 1862, when Dost Mahomed threatens an occupa tion of Seislan, the Shah claims the intervention of the British Government under the terms of the Treaty of Paris. This is refused, and Persia therefore (1863-65), taking advantage of the internal disorders of Afghanistan, occupies the greater part of that province. Shere Ali, the new ruler of Afghanistan, resents this act so strongly j that, to prevent collision between Persia and . Afghanistan, the British Government consent in 1871 to settle the question of division of the province and adjustment of boundaries. This question is settled by Sir F. Goldsmid, whose arbitral decision of 1st November 18/3 is accepted, though not with satisfaction, by both Persia and Afghanistan. At the same period the boundaries between Persia and Khelat are settled by Sir F. Goldsmid’s Com mission. In 1873 the Shah visits Europe, and remains in London from 18th June to 5th July. He repeats his visit to Europe in 1876, but does not on this occasion come to London. Afghanistan. the war between the British and the Sikhs, he openly advances against Peshawur, and occupies that place and Attock until driven out by the British in 1849. In 1854-55 a meeting takes place between Sir John Lawrence and an Envoy from Dost Mahomed, which eventuates in a treaty concluded at Peshawur on 30th March 1855, which, while it. establishes perpetual peace between the two countries, pledges the Ameer to assist the English against a foreign enemy. In this year Dost Mahomed incorporates Candahar in Cabul sovereignty. In 1857 a fresh en gagement is entered into during the Persian war, by which the Ameer is allowed a subsidy for the de fence of his kingdom, a British Mission is despatched to Candahar, and British agencies temporarily ad mitted into Afghanistan. In 1859 the Afghan frontier is advanced towards the Oxus by the conquest of Kunduz, and the sub missal of Badakshan to Dost Mahomed. In 1863 Dost Mahomed advances to Herat, whose ruler (his nephew) had shown signs of rebellion agaidst his authority. He occupies it (after a siege of 10 months) on the 27th May 1863, but only survives this success a few days. He dies on 9th June 1863, and is succeeded by his heir apparent Shere Ali Khan, whose succession is acknowledged (23rd December) by the Acting Governor General, Sir W. Denison. In 1866, however, Mahomed Afzul Khan successfully opposes the Ameer, and is recognized as dc facto ruler by the Indian Govern ment. On his death Azim Khan succeeds him for a brief period, and is similarly recognized. In the meantime Shere Ali takes refuge in Herat ; but in 1868 he regains his ascendency, and, entering Cabul in triumph, puts to flight Azim and his nephew Abdul Rahman. The former dies shortly after, but the latter flies to Turkestan, where he still lives, under Russian protection. Shero Ali is then recognized as ruler of Afghanistan by the Indian Government, and is also promised assistance in the shape of arms and money. In 1869 he meets Lord Mayo at Umballa, and receives further promises of support and friendship. In 1871 Yacoob Khan rebels, but is eventually defeated and reconciled to his father. In 1873 Shere AH sends his Envoy, Syud Noor Mahomed, to Simla to ask for further material support from the Government of India, which is refused. He at this time nominates as his heir apparent Abdulla Jan. In the same year Russia acquiesces in the decision by Her Majesty’s Government that the districts of Bndakshan and Wakhan be included in Afghan dominions. In 1874 Shere Ali, suspecting his son Yakoob Ali of treason entices him to Cabul and imprisons him (8th November). On 6th October 1876 the Afghan Envoy, Atta Mahomed, reaches Simla,and arranges the Peshawur Conference, which commences on the 30th January 1877, and concludes on the 19th February. About the 15th of July 1878 a Russian Envoy arrives at Cabul. It then becomes necessary to demand of the Ameer the admission of a British Mission, which is refused on the 21st September. This insult is followed by a declaration of war on 20th November. On the death of Shere Ali (21st February 1879), Yakoob Khan becomes Ameer of Cabul (Abdulla Jan having died on the 17th August 1878), and the Treaty of Gandamuk is concluded with him on the 26th May, in accordance withPP 3338 .

In 1851 Yar Mahomed, of Herat, dies, and is succeeded by his son Syud Ma homed, who, finding himself threatened from Cabul and Candahar, turns to Persia for assistance. The Shah de spatches a force to occupy the city, but after repeated unsuccessful attempts to capture it abandons the siege in January 1853, owing to the remon strances of Her Majesty's Government. In 1855 Dost Mahomed brings Can dahar under his direct sovereignty, but Herat remains independent under Persian influence. In the same year Persia seizes Lash and Jowain. In 1856 Herat is occupied by Persia, as stated in the preceding column, but quickly evacuated and given up under the terms of the Treaty of Paris (5th May 1857). In March 1857 Sultan Ahmed Khan, nephew of Dost Ma homed, is installed in Herat. On the 26th April, in accordance with the terms of the treaty negotiated at Peshawur in January, a British Mis sion, under Sir H. Lumsden, proceeds to Candahar. It is withdrawn in May 1858. Towards the end of 1858 a Russian Mission under Khani- koff 1 arrives at Herat, but is prevented by Dost Mahomed from proceeding to Cabul. In 1866 Shere Ali retires, before Mahomed Afzul, to Herat, which he holds till he is reseated on the throne of Cabul. Yakoob Khan, his son and heir, is appointed Governor of Herat, rebels in 1871, but, being re conciled to his father, continues in that post till 1874, when Shere Ali entices him to Cabul and imprisons him (8th November). In 1871-72 the Mekran and Seistan arbitrations are respectively carried out by Sir F. Goldsmid, and re luctantly accepted by Persia and Af ghanistan. In 1875, on the 19th February, Shere Ali ; s troops occupy Herat. In 1852, as a result of the second Burmese war, Pegu is annexed. In 1853 the Berars (Hyderabad) are assigned to British management.

In 1856 the China war takes place, followed shortly by the mutiny in India, 1857. The first disturbance arises at Barrackpore on 19th February; in May Delhi is seized by the rebels, and Lucknow and Cawnpore are similarly occu pied. In September 1857 Delhi is retaken by the British, on 25th Sep tember Lucknow is relieved, and subsequently, in March 1858, re- occupied. On 8th July 1859 Lord Canning issues a proclamation of peace. On 1st November 1859 a new era [of British rule in India is inaugurated by the Queen’s proclamation trans ferring that country from the East India Company to the Crown, Lord Canning being the first Viceroy. He is succeeded by Lord Elgin in 1861, on whose Jwhose death Lord Lawrence becomes Viceroy, ar riving in India in January 1864. In 1853 the “ Umbeyla campaign ” is carried through by Sir Neville Chamberlain. In 1864 the Bhotan war commences, the conclusion of which is followed by the annexation, on payment of an allowance, of the Dooai-s (25th February 1866). In 1868 the Black Mountain cam paign against the Hussunzyes takes place. In the same year Lord Mayo is appointed Viceroy. In 1869 Lord Mayo meets Shere Ali at Umballa, and cements the alliance between India and Cabul. In 1872 Lord Mayo is assassinated at Port Blair (8th February), and in the May following Lord North brook arrives as Governor General. On 1st December the Jowaki ex pedition is terminated by the capture of Jammu. In 1873 Sir D. Forsyth goes on a mission to Kashgar, Kho- tan, &amp;c.

In 1850 she founds Port Nicolaesk, at the mouth of the Amour. In 1852 she creeps on to Fort Vernoe or Almaty, in Turkestan ; and in the following year takes Ak Musjid (Perofski), after an obstinate resistance; her further advance is however checked by the Crimean war. In 1857 she sends Khanikoff on an un successful mission to Herat; and in 1863 advances into Kokand as far as Chemkend, which is captured with great loss to the defenders. In the following year a circular is issued by Prince Gortchakoff, which justifies these conquests by the necessity of the Russian frontier being strengthened. In June 1865 the Russians ctCpture Tashkend, and in the following year Khojend falls (24th June), as well as Irdjak (8th May), and Jeesakh (18th October). In this year too the country of Tashkend is annexed (27th August), while on the 11th July 1867 the whole of the conquests beyond the Syr-Daria are created into a separate province. On the 1st May 1868 General Kauffmann takes Samarcand, and the fortress of Katty Kurgan falls to him on the 18th May. On the 18th June Bokhara, cut off from her water supply, consents to pay tribute to Russia. In 1869 the mission of Sir D. Forsyth to St. Petersburg, following the Umballa Conference, takes place. In the following year, on the 24th August, Shahr-i-Subz submits to the Russian arms, and the 4th July 1871 sees the conquest of Kuldja. Shortly after this event Russia protests against the inclusion of Badakshan within the Afghan boundary, but ultimately (1873) acquiesces in the decision to that effect on the part of Her Ma jesty’s Government. On the 20th June of this year the Russian ad vances culminate in the conquest of Khiva. In 1873 also a gratuitous expedition is undertaken against the Yomuds. In 1875 General KuufF- mann gains a victory over the Ko- kandi&amp;n insurgents (4th September), which results in the annexation of Kokand, under the name of province of Ferghana.

On 8th December 1876 a treaty is entered into with the Khan of Kelat, providing for the posting of troops and the construction of railways and telegraphs in his territories. As a direct consequence of this treaty, Quetta is occupied by British troops on 5th October 1876. The Khan’s subsidy is also increased under the terms of the above en gagement. On the 1st January 1877 the Queen is proclaimed Empress of India at the Delhi Durbar. On the 6th October Atta Mahomed Khan, the Afghan Envoy, reaches Simla, and his visit results in the Peshawur Conference (30th Jan uary to 19th February), at which Syud Nur Mahomed represents Shere Ali and Sir Lewis Pelly the British Government.

It also includes an outline of its demography, and its revenue by province. Military matters are also covered in this section; this includes an in-depth look at the Persian army — its pay and composition — and a look at the employment of British officers in Persia. This section concludes with a narrative of Persia's modern history from the sixteenth century.'Persia and Herat' describes the extent to which the province's boundaries can be defined, and provides a brief description of each district within; Ghorian, Sabzawar, Farah, Bakwa, Kurak, and Obeh. It also includes a description of the town of Herat, and information on the province's demography and climate. The section also provides detailed coverage of the tribes in the region. The development of British policy towards Herat is explained through the use of select correspondence. This includes the relative merits for Britain in either maintaining Herat's independence, or supporting Afghan or Persian rule; extensive reference is made to the Treaty of Paris (1857).'Persia and Seistan' also provides a geographic description of the province, along with information on its administrative divisions, climate, and transportation links. Its main purpose however is to outline the development of British attitudes concerning the governance of this province; should it be overseen by Afghanistan or Persia? To provide context, it covers the historical basis for the two competing claims. It concludes by describing the British arbitration of the matter in 1871-72 by General Frederick John Goldsmid, and its outcome; summaries of the statements provided by the Afghan and Persian sides are included.'Persia and Kohuk' explains how Persia has disputed the award of this province to Khelat by General Goldsmid in 1871, and British reluctance to amend the award in favour of Persia.'Persia and the Navigation of the Karun River' outlines British efforts to open up the Karun River for steam navigation. It explains that Russian success in improving transportation infrastructure in the north of Persia — in contrast to British failure in the south — is seen to be putting British trade at a disadvantage; the Karun River is seen as having the best potential for resolving this. The prospects for the construction of a railway in southern Persia are also briefly examined.'Persia and her integrity' details the development of a diplomatic understanding from 1834 between Britain and Russia, in which both powers established their mutual interest in the maintenance of the territorial integrity of Persia. It chiefly concerns British suspicions that Russian activities in central Asia do not match their professed intentions towards Persia (i.e. British fears that Russia is encroaching on central Asia).'Persia and Merv', in addition to providing an overview of the region's history and ancient settlements, considers what the British consider to be the encroachment of Russia on Persia's northern borders; the British consider any potential Russian occupation of Merv to be a threat, and it is explained that Persian control is preferred.'Continuation of General Status of Persia' concentrates on British concerns over increases in Russian influence at the Persian Court in Tehran; the British fear Persia becoming a vassal of Russia and facilitating Russian expansion towards Afghanistan. It therefore discusses the extent to which Britain should take advantage of Persian overtures to establish friendly relations with that power in order to prevent this scenario. It also briefly discusses Persian designs on Bahrain, and the desirability — for Britain — in maintaining its status as an independent state, in addition to emphasizing the need to maintain Britain's protectorate role in the Persian Gulf. Topics also included in this section, but covered in less detail include: the conference of consular powers on the Resident in the Persian Gulf; the development of telegraph lines in Persia; and negotiations respecting the demarcation of the Persian-Turkish border.The memorandum is signed by Owen Tudor Burne of the India Office.The appendix at the back is divided eight sections as follows:I.
