INDIA OFFICE, Slavery in the Persian Gulf. Introductory. 1. The status of slavery is legally recognised in the Koran—an important consideration in dealing with the question of slavery in an area ruled exclusively, and peopled predominantly, by Mohammedans. Moreover, alike on the Trucial Arab Coast and in the dominions of Ibn Saud, the custom of house-born slaves is one which is firmly established, and the -eradication of which is likely to cause serious difficulty. Treaty Engagements of the Arab States of the Gulf. 2. From the precis of Treaties with the Chiefs of the Gulf States contained in the Appendix to this Memorandum it will be seen that the engagements of Bahrein, the Trucial Sheikhdoms, and Muscat, to His Majesty’s Government bind them to suppress and to abstain from the slave trade in their territories, and empower His Majesty’s Government to search their vessels on their behalf, not only on the high seas, but in Arab and Muscat waters. On the occasion of the conclusion of the Treaty of 3rd November 1916 with El Katr, under which the Sheikh accepted •obligations similar to those of the other Trucial Chiefs, it was agreed, however, that he and his subjects should be allowed to retain negro slaves already in their possession, on condition of their treatment being satisfactory. No formal engagement exists in the case of Koweit: but the degree of control and influence exercised in that State by His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India may be regarded as sufficient to enable them to impose in practice an effective check on slave traffic within its boundaries. Under Article 7 of the Treaty of Jeddah of 20th May 1927 Ibn Saud has undertaken to co-operate by all the means at his disposal with His Majesty’s Government in the suppression of the slave trade, while a separate exchange of Notes took place with the King of Hejaz and Nejd -on the same occasion regarding the retention by His Majesty’s Government of the right to manumit slaves through their consular officers. Treaty Engagements of Persia. 3. The suppression of the traffic in slaves as between His Majesty’s Government and Persia is governed by the Convention between Great Britain and Persia of 2nd March 1882. Under this Convention the Persian Government agree to take steps for the suppression of the trade, and to the search, detention, and bringing for trial before the nearest Persian authorities by His Majesty’s ships of merchant vessels under the Persian flag or belonging to 1 ersian subjects which may be engaged, or which there may be reasonable grounds for suspecting to be, or to have been, engaged, during the voyage on which they are met. in carrying slaves. A special proviso deals with the position of slaves accompanying an individual to the pilgrimage places under a passport countersigned by the British authority. The Convention further provides that a representative of the British Government shall be present at the adjudication on any merchant vessel under the Persian flag captured by a British cruiser ‘and taken into a Persian port for that purpose; that the proceeds of the sale of such a vessel, if condemned, shall go to Persia; and that the slaves found on board be handed over to Great Britain. 1. The history of the Gulf as a centre of slaving activity is notorious and the relatively satisfactory condition of affairs described below represents the result of over a century of unceasing vigilance on the part of His Majesty’s Government. The slave trade in the Gulf has now been under effective control for many years, and it is unnecessary in the circumstances to examine m detail its history since 1908. The statement which follows confines itself accordingly to setting out the position as regards slavery at the present time on the Arabian and on the Persian littoral of the Gulf 3144 a 75 10.28* P. 4481. t Tel. from Pol.

Present position on the Arab Littoral of the Gulf. 5. The effect of the engagements referred to in para. 2 above, of the degree of control exercised by His Majesty’s Government in Koweit, and of the energetic and unremitting activity of successive political officers and of His Alajesty’s ships, has been to reduce the slave traffic on the Arab littoral of the Persian Gulf to relatively unimportant dimensions. From a Report submitted by the Political Resident in the Gulf on 10th June 1928, 0 it appears that all the slave trade which now exists, other than such as may emanate from Nejd, is from Persian Buluchistan to the Trucial Arab coast, on which slavery is still common—the Batineh coast of Muscat (portions of which are not under the effective control of the Muscat authorities) being frequently used as a pied d terre, and the small Trucial Sheikhdom of Dabai playing a prominent part. On a broad view, however, though the Political Resident can report that “at Koweit, and on the Arab coast, there are many thousands of slaves who have been brought from the interior at some time,”! the problem, so far as the Arab States of the Gulf are concerned, may be regarded as one of relatively small importance; the treaty engagements and the special relations which exist between His Majesty’s Government and the rulers of those States are, so far as can be judged, adequate, if strictly interpreted, to secure that no recrudescence of the slave traffic shall take place on the Arabian shore of the Gulf; the hold exercised by Hindu merchants over the pearl fishing industry affords a guarantee of some value that the presence of Indian slaves in the Gulf cannot long pass unnoticed, and, in the light of Sir Lionel Haworth’s Report referred to above, the Government of India, who are fully alive to the importance of the question, have recently approved the Resident’s proposal “ to tighten up the reading of our Treaties with the Sheikhs to the most favourable interpretation to which it is possible to bring them in this connection,” and have instructed him to devote his special attention to Dabai, and to “consider the advisability of making it quite clear to the Sheikh that any connivance by him in the traffic, or indeed any slackness on his part to suppress it, will bring him within their displeasure, which they will not hesitate to manifest.’’ Present position on the Persian Littoral. 6. It is equally the case that the measures taken under the Anglo- Persian Convention of 1882 (and, in so far as Gwadur is concerned, under the treaty engagements of the Sultan of Muscat with His Majesty’s Govern ment) have resulted in the reduction to relatively unimportant dimensions of the slave trade on the Persian littoral. The extent, however, to which, despite the endeavours of His Majesty’s Government, the slave traffic between Persia and the Arab coast continues to persist is described by the Government of India as disquieting, and the danger of its revival on a larger scale is one which cannot be overlooked.J The absence of effective control by Persia of Persian Baluchistan has resulted in a small but regular traffic from that area, in which§ slavery is stated to be rife. In Sir L. Haworth’s view this traffic is likely to continue until Persia is in a position to establish such control. Active steps are, however, being taken by Sir L. Haworth locally to put a stop to it, while the Government of India, as the result of his report, have taken action to improve co-ordination in preventive measures between the authorities in Sind and British Baluchistan and the British officials in the Gulf. Persian representations regarding abrogation of Slavery Convention of 1882 with Great Britain. 7. The Persian Government in x\pril of this year indicated, in the first stage in their general negotiations with His Majesty’s Government, that they regarded the Slavery Convention of 1882 as one derogatory to Persian dignity, and, while it is not yet clear whether they intend to press for its abrogation, the question of the attitude to be adopted in face of such au&gt; demand, if made, has been under the active consideration of the Government of India and His Majesty’s Government. Persia and the League of Nations Slavery Convention of 8. The position is complicated by the existence of the League of Nations Slavery Convention of 1926. The Convention in question imposes on the States adhering to it a binding obligation to take, within their capacity, all possible action to prevent and to suppress the slave trade, and to bring about, progressively and as soon as possible, the complete abolition of slavery in all its forms. It provides further, however, in the first place (Article 3), that States adhering to its terms shall remain free to conclude, subject to its provisions, such special agreements as, by reason of their peculiar situation, may appear suitable to attain its objects, and, secondly, (Article 9), that States shall be at liberty to adhere to it subject to reservations in respect of the application of the Convention or part of it to some or all of the territories of the State concerned. 9. Were Persia to sign and ratify the Convention in question in respect of the Persian Gulf, and were she in a position effectively to discharge in that area the international obligations undertaken by her under the Convention, the case for a special agreement between her and His Majesty’s Government on the general lines of the Slavery Convention of 1882, would be substantially weakened, if not destroyed, although the terms of Article 3 of the Convention, to which reference is made above, would clearly leave it open to her to conclude such an agreement. In fact, however, while the Convention was signed by the Persian representative at the League, his signature was given ad referendum (and subject to a specific minor reservation), and the Convention has not been ratified by Persia. Moreover, even were she to ratify it, in its present form, she would be incapable, as matters stand, of discharging effectively the obligations which it would impose upon her, for there is no Persian Navy (other than a few Customs preventive boats), and the local Persian officials in the Gulf are stated by the Political Resident to be of such a character that, in the absence of the Convention of 1882, they would themselves participate in the slave traffic. 10. The available evidence indicates that relaxation, even, of the precautions at present taken under the Convention of 1882 to prevent slavery in the Gulf is likely to lead to a serious recrudescence of the slave traffic. The apparent impotence of Persia to substitute an effective preventive service of her own and the importance of provision for the effective discharge in the Gulf of the humanitarian and international obligations at present discharged by His Majesty’s Government under the 1882 Convention, make it desirable, therefore, that if that Convention is to be revised, the new Instrument, if any, to be substituted for it in deference to Persian susceptibilities, should differ from it in form and not in substance. From a different standpoint it is desirable that whatever compromise is offered to Persia should aim at retaining control by His Majesty’s Government of preventive action (the objections to the development of a Persian Naval Force, which in present circumstances would probably be officered from foreign and non-British sources, are patent), and at retaining the present immunity of British ships from search on the high seas by Persian vessels. Attitude to be adopted towards a Persian demand for abrogation. Views of Foreign Office. 11. A final decision has not been reached as to the offer to be made to Persia should she press for the abrogation of the Convention of 1882. The Foreign Office in June 1928 expressed the view that His Majesty’s Government should assent to such a demand on the understanding only that the Convention should be replaced by a new Convention which, in order to meet Persian susceptibilities regarding unequal treaties, should be drafted on a basis of reciprocity', and should generally follow, subject to certain modifications, the lines of an existing Slavery Treaty between His Majesty’s Government and another first-class Power, such as the Anglo-Italian Slavery Treaty of 1889. (A Convention on these lines would, it may be remarked, empower Persian vessels to search British ships P. 4700/28. F.O. to I.O., June 1928, P. 3080.on the high seas suspected of engaging in the slave traffic, and to detain or divert them from their course where primd facie evidence of complicity existed.) Views of India Office and Admiralty. 12. Subsequent consideration has proceeded on the basis of the Foreign Office proposals. Those proposals, and the question as a whole, have now been examined by the Government of India, the India Office and the dmiralty. Subject to certain supplementary observations set out in para. 14 below, the Admiralty concur in the conclusions reached on the 8 matter by the Secretary of State for India in the light of the considered recommendations of the Government of India and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and communicated to the Foreign Office on 8th September Ihose conclusions are as follow :— (a) That in the forthcoming negotiations His Majesty’s Government should aim at securing that vessels flying the British flag shall retain their present immunity from search on the high seas by Persian vessels (which is regarded as essential); that no substantial relaxation of preventive measures shall take place in the Gulf ■ and that preventive action in the Gulf shall so far as possible remain in the hands of His Majesty’s Government. (b) That, in the first instance, endeavours should be made to secure an agreement with Persia on the basis of a modernisation of the form while retaining the essential matter of the 1882 Convention the key-note of the new Convention being possibly, as suggested bv the Government of India, that Persia, being desirous of putting down the slave traffic, had secured the naval assistance of His Majesty’s Government, instead of, as at present, that an unwilling Persia was being forced to suppress the slave traffic by His Majesty’s Government (c) I hat the right of searching vessels in Persian territorial waters at piesent exercised by His Majesty’s Government under the Slavery Convention might be abandoned should some further concession be necessary. [Note. Persia already enjoys the right to search British vessels in 1 ersian territorial waters, and the effect of the concession in question would be to leave the policing of Persian waters exclusively to her It may be remarked that in the view of the Government of fndia even this gap in the preventive system is beyond Persia’s power to fill I (d) That a concession by which His Majesty’s Government should abandon their right to search Persian vessels on the high seas and should restrict their search of such vessels to Arab waters (in which under then tieaties with the various Arab Sheikhs, the right of search of Ml vessels is vested in them), would be in the highest degree objectionable, as amounting to a virtual abandonment in toto of the Convention of 1882, while the loss of powder to search suspected Persian vessels on the high seas must necessarily curtail the effective- ness of His Majesty’s ships in keeping down the slave traffic. (e) That in view of the present impotence of Persia to substitute effective preventive slavery measures of her own, the propriety of invoking the assistance of the League of Nations, in the general interests of civilisation, should be considered should Persia adopt an unreasonable attitude and reject a compromise on the lines set out in (b) and (c) above and that the adoption of this course should equally be considered in the event of a unilateral denunciation by Persia of the Convention of 1882. 14. The Admiralty, in expressing their concurrence in the views of the Secretary of State for India as set out above, added that in their view if the compromises proposed by the India Office were not acceptable, llis Majesty’s Government should give up any idea of making a Slavery Convention with 1 ersia; and that if there were a unilateral denunciation of the 1882 Convention, Persia, as a member of the League of Nations, should be pressed to take steps as soon as it is clear that she has failed to suppress the slave traffic.
