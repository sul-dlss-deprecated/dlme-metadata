I did not like the idea oi applying to the Saudi Arabian Government at all und had a meeting with Dermitte, Gahan and Breach about the case. W e decided that the G.P.O. probably did not know where or what i^atar is and that we should ask the Foreign On ice to explain that to them and to ask them to get “^atar' registered in the Berne lists. Could you do this? If it is not done no telegraph office in the world will accept messages for Qatar. It does not apparently matter about having 'P-uTiiO^AT' registered as a telegraphic address; the only office which will have to recognise it as such is that operated in Watar by the oil company.

I am moat grateful for the action you have taken to obtain an additional allocation of meat for the Kuwait Oil Company. 3. i am afraid I now have to ask you for assistance in the matter of the supply of meat for Petroleum Development (Qatar) Limited. I have'recently paid a visit to their camp in the Qatar peninsula and was informed by their Manager there that at present their ration of meat is only 2 or. a day. I think the conditions under which the people at Qatar work are worse than those prevail- ing at any of the other Gulf Oil fields. The climate and land scape are appallng} accommodation poor and amenities practically nil. As you are probably aware the Company has recently receiv ed orders that they are to go into production as soon as possible and this means a great deal of hard work. 4 # Apart from this the most important part of their work at present is drilling and for this they have to employ American drillers as no British ones are available. These drillers expect to receive a pound of meat per day and beef at that. Mr. Langham the Manager who is himself an American, Informs me that in their homes they only eat beef and will not accept mutton or lamb in its place. If they are not provided with the amount and kind of meat to which they are used, they will leave the Company* s emnloyment and it will be difficult to get other American drillers in their place as possible candidates will undoubtedly learn of the reason for the present drillers* departure and will refule to accept employment. 5 . The Company*s Head Office in London are, I believe, taking up the matter through the Ministry of Fuel and Power, but I should be very grateful for any assistance you can give. As pointed out in my letter about the Kuwait Oil Company, it is most undersirable that any differentiation should be made between American and British employees in the matter of rations, and 1 would therefore urge that a full meat ration of a pound a day should be provided for all. This is in any case I think Justified on the grounds given in paragraph 3 above. The number of persons concerned Including both British and American is only about 200, so that the amount of meat and hard currency exchange involved will not be very large. Sd/-W.R. Hay R.G.

Dear Residency, &gt; Will yoi^/please refer to your letter No.6/37/49 of May 4th about the employment of Hungarians and Roumanians by Petroleum Concessions Limited. We have thought it best to take up this question with P.C.L.’s London Office and you will see from the enclosed copy of a letter to Longrigg that we have informed him that H.M.G. do not favour the recruit ment of Hungarians and Roumanians in Qatar and the Trucial Coast. In coming to this decision we have taken into account the fact that any Hungarians or Roumanians who might be recruited by P.C.L. would probably have relations in their countries of birth: by pressure or threat of pressure on these relatives the Communist Regimes might be able to make use of the men working for P.C.L., however hostile they might personally be to Communism to act as propagandists or as active agents for Commuhism. Although Hungarians may possibly still be able to leave their countries legally, Roumanians could certainly not unless they were agents provocateurs. Yours ever, eastern department.

POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN, 4th July, 1949. Dear Sir Rupert, l In April last Lermitte told us that work on navigational beacons on the Jebal Wakrah of Qatar was being interrupted by the 'Shaikh' of Wakrah. As the Ruler of Qatar was too weak to intervene Felly wrote on 22nd of April to the 'Shaikh” of Wakrah telling him to stop Interfering with the work. -\ 2. The Ruler of Qatar recently wrote to me and Saleh al Mani* recently called here and on the strength of a letter written by ^ir Trenchard Fcwle in 1935 dis claimed all responsibility because the oil company was implicated. I propose to refer this point to you later but in the meantime have suggested to Lermitte by that he should follow up Felly's letter/attempting to resume work on the beacons. 3. It occurs to me that ss the 'Wren” is leaving ^ for Tunb to-morrow it might be most opportune if they were to show themselves at Wakrah on their way. If you concur would you be good enough to have the sloop instructed accordingly? In that event I will, if you have no objection, tell Lermitte.

Mail Div: Liaison. Subject: Security Jebel Wakara To: Liaison Officer, Dukhan. Memo No.P/16/103 Date 22nd July, 1949. The C.E. department Umm Said intend re-commencing operations upon the erection of a beacon upon Jebel Wakara. Work is due to start tomorrow morning July 23rd. Upon receipt of request for guards I instructed the Emir at Umm Said to provide two guards for a probable duration of five days. Camp Boss Umm Said would arrange for a tent and rations. Upon learning the destination of the guards the Emir at first refused to provide them saying thatlhe was responsible for Umm Said area only. He then added the pleasing information that even if they were ordered to go he doubted if they would do so. He suggested that as the affair was between the Ruler and Shaikh Saud of Wakara the former should provide some from his own body guard. I informed him that the work emanated from Umm Said and that the guards must come from him. At last he grudgingly agreed but added that they were only responsible for prevention of thefts. I informed him that they and he wculd be held responsible for any form of interference to Company property. Saleh states that he has replied to the Company on the matter and appears to consider that it is no longer any business of his but rather the concern of the Political Agent. Since I understand the Company are now only erecting a single wooden telegraph pole the erection may this time be achieved without incident. Shaikh Saoud's previous objection was that after stating we were going to erect only one beacon we actually erected four although each one of the four combined to make the one beacon. I will go to Wakara early on the morning of July 22nd and contact Shaikh Sauds representative there and inform him that we are erecting yet another beacon on Jebel Wakara. The local population were completely unaware of the presence of one of H.M. Ships off the coast on the 13th inst. I had it reported to me about that time that some noises of explosions had been heard out to sea but I nor I feel, any of the locals imagined that it had any particular significance. Even if this construction passes without incident it will not be a guarantee of immunity for the Company for any future operations. It will exist as a running s^ore until the Ruler makes his own settlement. (Sgd.) Tirbutt c.c. Terminal Supdt. cpd/ACMcopy From: Company Representative To: Liaison Officer. Doha. Memo No.P.16. 104 Date: 25rd July, 1949 I visited Shaik Saoud’s representative in Wakra this morning and informed him that the Company were re-erecting the beacon on the top of Jabel V/akra and that we did not wish it to be tampered with in any way. He informed me that Shaik Saoud would most definitely not approve and that it would be better for me to see him. I therefore went to Lucher in company with the Representative and interviewed Shaikh Saoud. He stated most definitely that he did not recognise the right of the Company to erect any construction on Jebel Wakra without his permission and this he was not prepared to give. In his opinion Jebel Wakra and the town belonged to him and if the Company wished to erect any form of construction either the Company or the Ruler must pay him, for this facility, iw I informed him that we could not possibly treat with him, that we recognised only the Ruler and that the order to proceed with the construction came from the Political Agent himself. If therefore he defied both the Ruler and the Political Agent he waild do so at his own peril. The interview was perfectly friendly but he was quite adamant in his attitude and stated thatjfie would undoubtedly do his best to destroy anything that we erected. I proceeded to Umm Said and informed the Terminal Superintendent. Later Mr. McQuaid who was in charge of the erection of the beacon on Jabel Wakra returned and informed me that the Representative from Shaik Saoud had approached him and informed him that work must stop. At his approach all the coolies stopped work and in the circum stances Mr. McQuaid brought all his coolies back to Umm Said and ceased operations. He informed me that it was only on the condition that he ceased work would the pole be left upright and untouched. In the circumstances I think he acted correctly in retiring without causing any incident. I understand from the Terminal Superintendent that he has given order for the work to be continued tomorrow and only to be terminated if there appears a risk of physical violence. I shall be present tomorrow to see the results of this decision and will endeavour to ensure that no incident occurs. Two guards were provided from Umm Said who even now are on duty on top of the Jabel. They were not however prepared to interfere in the matter of the continuance of the work. I have recounted the events to the Ruler's Representative who refuses to either inform the Ruler of what took place or to take any positive action. He states that even if guards are requested from the Ruler he doubts if he will provide them. (Sgd.) C.E.S. Tirbutt cpd / ACMSecret (7/11/49) Persian Gulf Residency, Bahrain, July 25, 1949. The Commanding Officer, H.M.S. 'Flamingo', Jufair. Memorandum. I see from the intended cruise of your vessel that you are due to visit Doha on August 2nd. I con sider that the present situation in Qatar calls for an earlier visit to Doha and recent reports from Wakrah, where some advance has been made in the construction of the navigational aid, also point to the desirability of your putting in an early appearance there. 2. You should not land at Doha and if local repre sentatives come aboard and invite you ashore you should say that your instructions are not to land. Visits should not be exchanged with the Ruler of Qatar. 3. There is not the same objection to landing at Wakr^ i* in fact, while you should avoid any incidents, it is desirable that you should show, in such a manner as your discretion decides, the connexion of your visit with the erection of the navigational aid on Jabal Wakrah. Visits should not be exchanged with the person represent ing himself t*^the Shaikh of Wakrah. 4. The visits would best take place immediately after the two days of the * Id and I shall be glad to be informed of your proposed date of arrival at both places so that P.C.L. Company may be warned. You should not discuss the //eightman concession with or in the presence of P.C.L. representatives. Saleh al Mani* who is the Ruler’s right-hand man and reliable may come aboard at Doha. You should hear anything he has to say but as he does not speak English you should be very guarded in any remarks you may make through an interpreter. There would be no objection (subject to the reference above to P.C.L.) to your intimating, should a safe opportunity arise of doing so, that His Majesty’s Government expect the Ruler to sign the Weightman concession.

DO/QLsn/7915 Confidential 28th July, 1949 a Thank you for your letter dated the 27th July 1949 regarding the visit of «Flaraingo»‘ to Wakrah. I have advised Langham that 'Flamingo' will visit Doha on Friday the 29th and will be at Wakrah on the morning of Saturday July the 30th, and have requested him to recommence work which was discontinued on Sunday the 24th July. I enclose, for your information, a full report on the events which occurred on the 24th and would be grateful for ytxir advice whether you consider that work should be resumed on the 30th. I shall be visiting Doha on the morning of the 30th with Langham to call on the Shaikh and will take the opportunity of flying round Jabel Wakrah about 10 a.m. bkl/acmReport on Action taken at Waqra Beacon on Sunday 24th July 1949 A working party was assembled on the morning of 24th July 1949 at Umm Said and with transport proceeded to Jebel Waqra. The party consisted of one Indian Foreman, two Indian Steel Erectors, one Indian carpenter and nine Qatari labourers. The working party was organised by and under control of Mr. C.A. McQuaid, General Foreman, Mr. Hewitt, Area Civil Engineer, accompanied by Mr. K. Copty, clerk and interpreter, also proceeded to Jebel Waqra. Messrs. Hewitt, McQuaid and Copty arrived at the site at 0930 hrs. and conditions were as they had been left the previous day. The standard was standing over the point marker and braced at the upper part between the members of the tubular frame. At 10.00 hrs. the working party arrived with all the necessary materials. Work was commenced at once and the first task was to tie on temporary rope guys to maintain the standard in a vertical position during concreting. Before the working party arrived there appeared on the scene a middle-aged Arab whom we subsequently found to be named Hassan Shaer and another. These two asked questions as to what we were going to do but we were politely non-committal and from overhearing them speak Mr. Copty saw that they were very pu z zled. As the work got under way about ten to fifteen people had collected and there v/as much talk and speculation. About fifty minutes after work had commenced we saw approaching rapidly from the direction of Waqra three men. When they arrived it was seen that one had a cane and a revolver, one had a rifle and the other was unarmed. v As they came near, the man with the revolver, who was stated to be Ameer kept shouting 1 Stop work’. The labourers immediately stopped all work and ran a short distance from the site. The man Hassan Share approached my party and stated thatjhe was the spokesman for Sheikh Saud of Waqrah. He said that Sheikh Saud had stated that no work was to be done and had given instructions that any work carried out would be dismantled. I stated that my instructions from the Company were that the Beacon would be erected and it had the consent of the Ruler. He then said that there was but one Ruler in Waqrah and that was Sheikh Saud. He pressed that Mr. Copty and I would accompany him and have speech with Sheikh Saud. To that I replied that the Company dealt only with the Ruler in Doha and that I could not speak with Sheikh Saud. Again he said that the ’Sheikh at Doha’ had no jurisdiction at Waqrah and the ground on which we were working was the sole property of Sheikh Saud. While this conversation was going on I had instructed Mr. McQuaid to do all he could to get the work going again. The Indians had started work and some of the coolies.When this was seen the conversations were broken off and he four men rushed at the coolies shouting threats and hustling them from the site. In so doing the Indian Foreman was roughly hustled by a rather fierce looking guard who had a rifle. I immediately told Mr. Copty to tell Hassan Sahair that if any violence were done to a foreigner under the protection of the Company there would be a serious reaction. This appeared to have an immediate and steadying effect on them. They all went quiet and rather sheepish. Whatever was said,the guard himself looked scared and tfcied to edge away. I demanded the name of the guard and this was withheld. We then had another discussion and we were requested to undo the work that had been done and withdraw. To this demand I gave a categoric refusal. The man called Ameer therefore gave some instruction and a man ran to each of the four guy ropes to undo them. They started to sever them with knives but Hassan Sahair stopped them and they then simply loosed the knots. I then requested my party excluding Qataris to retie the guys and this was done. Me. McQuaid and Mr. Copty assisting the Indians. No action was taken by the Waqrahi but immediately the work was finished and the guys were left unattended they were again untied. I then decided that there had been resistance to operation and aggression sufficient to make work impossible and gave instructions to abandon the work. Mr. Copty gathered from the many conversations going on that the people active were not very happy but that their fear of Sheikh Saud was very great. At about this point the two guards from Umm Said who had been left there since the previous day approached Mr. Copty and prayed that they be brought by us to Umm Said as they were very much afraid. To this I agreed. I called Hassan Sahair and told him that I was leaving some stores on the site and depended upon the honour of the Sheikh of Waqrah that these would not be stolen. He and his colleagues seemed much dismayed at this and implored that we take all. I refused and ordered that the cement (12 cwts.) be left. They kept on asking and practically pleading that we come and speak with the Sheikh. My answer was as before. We were then informed that Sheikh Saud had given instructions that this evening all the structure would be completely removed. It was also stated however that the Waqrahi were very honest people and all the materials would be held in safe custody except the cement. We waited while the working party loaded up and then proceeded to Umm Said arriving there at 1330 hrs. J.

One of H.M. ships had twice been L&lt; sent to Wakra at public expense and,appeared to have made no progress. It was clear that the text of my instructions had been mangled because Flamingo asked the very questions to which I had given the answers.

It was given to our father in his life time by his father Shaikh Qasim. As he gave Doha to Abddullah, similarly, he gave Wakrah to Abdulrahman. Wakrah is separate from (independent o£ Doha .

H.G.Jakins, Esq., H.B.M’s Political Agent, Bahrain. to.. ■v- bhl/acmPETROLEUM DEVELOPMENT (QATAR) LIMITED Qatar, August 2nd, 1949. Dear Mr. Lermitte, I am enclosing a letter from Shaik Saud Ibn Abdul F.ahman for the Political Agent, Bahrein. The Captain of H.M.S. Flamingo instructed me to inform Shaik Saud that he would be prepared to carry a letter from him to the P.A. Unfortunately the letter was not ready by the time the Flamingo sailed, from V/akara. The Captain therefore suggested that I might be able to arrange for its arrival. It is forwarded therefore for disposal as you think fit. In forwarding it I beg to make the following comments. Shaik Saud is very anxious to see the P.A. and is willing to come to Bahrein at any time. I From the moment he was informed by me that the instructions not to interfere came from the Political Agent all interference with Company work in the Wakara area ceased. He pointed out that this is first time that he has received any instructions verbal or written from the P.A. His refusal to go aboard the Flamingo was the result of a fear of being abducted and not due to truculence or lack of respect for the F.A.^ These are my own impressions and not confirmed by any statements from Saud himself. He has no anti-Company or anti-British feelings. He is perfectly friendly but refuses to have anything more to do with the Ruler until the P.A. intervenes. He is a strong man in his own small right and if the matter could be settled satisfactorily, he could, I feel, be of use to the Company. There have been further demonstrations from other members of the Ruler's family today in an attempt to extract money from him. A big conference was held at Ryhan and I understand the poor relations numbered about 50 and were in very determined mood. Sanctions have been threatened both economic by closing portions of the Suq and more violent methods. Up to the time of writing I have heard no results of the conference. A report is being prepared and will be sent through the normal channels. Shaik Saud is not amongst these latest supplicants. Everyone is rather tired of the old Ruler and have given up hope that H.M.G. will be aMe to mend his ways for him so that they are beginning to use their own methods. In the latest party the prime movers are the brothers of the Ruler, Abdul Azeez, Sultan, Fahed, Nasr bin Khalid and his brothers. The sons of Ahmed bin Jassim, Moh’d and Ali bin Jassim,the more wealthy brothers of the Ruler, are I understand attempting to act as peacemakers. I have taken the liberty of writing you direct in this matter as it seemed best for the enclosed to arrive without delay and by the most direct means. I can definitely guarantee to produce Shaik Saud for the P.A. this time provided notice is given. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.)

Selih came to see ^e to-day and told me that the monthly payment for Gustos dues, Guards* wages etc. which the company had just made had been handed over by Sheikh Ali to his father. 2. The money was handed over to Salih by the Com pany yesterday, and he took it to Ali. Later he received a letter from Abdullah, demanding that the money be paid to him. He showed me the letter, and it was a simple demand, with no reasons given. He said that he had takem the letter to Sheikh Ali, w r ho had told him to pay the money to his father. He did so this morning, and then came and told me. 3. I told him that at that rate, all Government would rapidly become impossible, and asked him why he had not come to me before handing over the money. He s said he had not thought of it. I read him a short lecture and then told him that I wished to see Ali at once. 4. &gt; Ali came to his house, and I met him there. I asked him if it was true that ue had paid the money to his father, and he replied that he had, but that it was money accruing from the time that his father was Sheikh. I disposed of that argument, and he then said that his father was an old man, and he could not refuse him what he asked. I said his father was in no need of money, thiat he might more properly be helping his son than trying to get money^ out of him, that his first duty as a ruler was to his people, not his father etc. etc. He said it would not happen again. I replied that that was not the point,- that the money was expressly for the payment of wages and the expenses of government, and was not his to give away. I asked w r ho would pay the officials their wages. He said his father would have to do so. I said that in that case they would be his father’s servants and quite bluntly that it w r as no use his calling himself Ruler,- the ruler was the man with the money chest. 5. I then^asked him td&gt; go to his father and get the money back. 1 said that if'his father claimed that it was due to him under the abdication settlement, he should tell him that the expenses of government were to be the first charge on revenue, and that he would get his share later, ne went off saying that he would do so, and H.G. Jakins Esq., H.M. Political Agent, Bahrain.I said I hoped he would have good news for me in the morning. I have little hope that he will have, how ever. 6. One of the most disturbing aspects of the whole affair is the incredible folly of Salih, who ought to know better, in aiding and abetting the Sheikh* s action. I gave him a further had left, and finished by sayi Sheikh wished to do something foolish, he should tell me first, not afterwards. 7. I imagine that it was not your intention when fixing Abdullah’s yearly allowance tnet he should have it in additionto everything which happened to be in the kitty at the time of his abdication, Im particular Weightman* s 7 lacs'), and I think this mi got be made clear to Him. As he shows no signs of moving, and as he will continue to cause trouble in this way ir allowed to remain, I wonder if some stronger action might be taken. I should be grateful if the Resident could be primed for his visit on iuesday. Do you think he would care to kidnap the old man? 8.

September 4, 1949S.O.No.C/R-375 Confidential Political Agency, Bahrain, September 3, 1949, Dear Sir Rupert, Talking points for Doha. Lermitte tells me that the payment made over to Shaikh Abdulla was 39,228 rupees and he thinks it was in respect of the month of August. He is flying to Doha and will verify and let us know. 2. I realise that Abdulla has got away with a lot of money but all the same consider that we should not press for the return of this sum but should adopt the line that as he abdicated on August 20 he is only en titled to two-thirds of the payment for August. The balance will be deducted from his abdication settlement. Although it is quite likely that Ali will have to meet outgoings for the whole of the month of August I feel that with the existing lack of government forces in Qatar we should let Abdulla get away with his two-thirds so as to give him not the shadow of a c;se against Ali. In Lermitte's view the Darwish family are behind this demand on the part of Shaikh Abdulla. When we have got the police in Qatar properly armed and organised will be time enough to start being rough with Shaikh Abdulla. 3. Zubarah. When informing me of the Shaikh’s acquiescence in the seconding of Cochrane and the loan of the rifles Smith told me that His Highness would like some assurance that his claims on Zubarah would be satisfied. I said that it w?s not reasonable to expect an immediate settlement of this very old-standing question. I added that both Your Excellency and myself were eager to dispose of it but Ali was far from securely in the saddle, if Abdulla returned all hope of settlement would be lost and that the present moment when Ali had no His Excellency Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident, Persian Gulf.2 no properly organised force at his disposal it would not he possible for him to impose a settlement at Zubarah that would *S$m 'the risk of stirring up Abdulla against him. On the other hand the Shaikh of Bahrain has now abandoned his claim to the land and has asked only for his houses, free access and liberty to fish* In these circumstances I suggest that All might well be told that as soon as he is in a position to do so he should dispose of the Zubara question. The Shaikh of Bahrain advanced the bait that he was very knowledge able on the subject of the bedouins of Qatar. Yours sincerely, H.G. JakinsConfidential. 1/17/49. DOHA, 4th September 1949.

Always assuming that he is not pre varicating to avoid unpleasantness, this is a better outcome than I had hoped for.

Obviously if Abdulla has kept as much of this money as he could it may well be difficult to persuade Ali, in his present hardupi^ss, to do otherwise. At the same time he ought to be made to realize the duties of a virtuous ruler. 3. It may be altogether too revolutionary to give the guards all that is due to them straight away (although very good propaganda for Ali) but at least you ought to ensure, if possible, that their wages are progressively increased from now on until the time that Ali has other regular sources of income. 4.

He quoted Sir Trenchsrd Fowle's letter No.C/129 of 11th May 1935, in paragraph 6 of which it is stated that 'His Majesty's Government are prepared to support you and your successors in any difficulties arising from the presence of the Oil Company'. I referred 1st him 'to Sir Trenchard Fowle's earlier letter No.C/128 of the same date in which in paragraph 2(b) it is stated thaf'H.M.G. expect you to take all reasonable steps for your own defence and for maintaining order within your own frontier'. Further in paragraph 6 of letter No.C/129 ‘it is stated that 'H.M.G. are unable to accord you the ^measure of s'upport you ask for since this would*'involve an undesirable degree of interference in your administration'. I told Saleh al Mani' that, in my view, the Wakrah incident was purely a matter of internal security which it was incumbent on the Shaikh to maintain. I asked Mr. Lermitte to call on me this morning to enquire the position with regard to the work in Jebal Wakrah. He f teH| me that nothing ha«C been done. * In view of the lapse of time since the complaint was first made and of the letter j sent to the Shaikh of Wakrah under No.C/S-41 of 23rd April I thought it desirable to ascertain the position before returning to'the charge pe£e-rre4—hy the Ruler. I there- fcu fore suggested to Mr. Lermitte that he should 1nmn lTiitrnrt~ * t his people in Qatar that directions ha^a been issued to Wakrdiand that they should proceed there to resume operations. He said he would do this and let me know the result. . v W . (-gr 29-6-49. 3b -S • o (-&gt; % j 1 ■ 2 3 -Q i t,. 7 . u 9 ^ &lt;f?' ■ e ■£■ sro- ej/l-ZQ £ A?
