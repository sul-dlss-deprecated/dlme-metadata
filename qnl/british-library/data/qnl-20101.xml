X am not prepared for tne moment after sucn a short time in muscat to suggest a;in definite line of policy with regard to Sur, though I hope to do so after a further study of the situation, i am, however, definitely and strongly against tne proposal to send a large force of muscat infantry to sur unless the situation there alters very much for the worse, and until all other methods have been tried without success. TheJS~ 3 present situation at Sur does not, in my opinio:., oaxl for any sucn drastic measures. On tne political side tne proposal nas various disadvantages, while on tne financial side- tnougn financial reasons v/ere adduced fci its support- it would not seem to nave mucn to recommend it. mr* ihomas informs me tnat tne total possicie revenues i.ion. tne Sur Customs would oe about / 80,000 per annum, of wmch for tne last 5 years acout 30,000 nas been collected annually, tms oeing at least as mucn as for any previous quinquennial period- and pernaps more, m order tnerefore to increase tnis fi 30,000 to ^ 80,000 it was proposed to raise a force wmcn would cost tne Indian Government a large sum m laichs of rupees annually, for at least tnree wnile tne expense of tne force thereafter would fall on tne muscat State and apparently swallow up almost all the extra revenue thus gained, if it was possible and sale tc send a BTTian force of muscat infantry to Sur, tne question would toxe on a somewhat different complexion. 7. xtaval and A il Action , if military iorce in tne snape of sending a large body of troops to Sur is ruled out, the question of pressure by naval and air action arises- should need for sucn pressure occur. with regard to air action, xl we wisn to tacxie tne nanx hu Ali seriously ior any reason tnen air action wouxd oe needed for tne obvious reason tnat tnis tribe, except for tne few elements in Aiqa, inhabits the interior out of range of guns, if, however, we wished to put pressure on our axone then X tmnx tnat it might be possible to do this by naval acti4ji‘i alone, it may be objected tnat previous naval action xn November 1^28 nad no permanent effect, out I venture to suggest tnat tnia was oecause action was conuned to me demolition of a single fort of no particular importance. To produce tne necessary effect at 8ur naval action will nave to be in tne nature of a blocnade and destruction of dhows vwmcn tne Arao values far more tnan ms nousey, sucn as was successfully carried out at j\hasab.(The politicaand international objections to a 'biocKade' could be avoided as indicated m political resident 1 s tele^ran jfco* 40 of tne 18tn January 1^29). Tne naroour at sur is exceptionally well adapted to a Dlocxade* as a glance at a chart will snow. 8 . movements of sur dhows , in connection with naval action the movements of the Sur dnowa on v/hich the popula tion of that port practically live are of importance. Xney are as follows. In August and septemoer, before the commencement of the nortn-east monsoon which olows from October to April* the 8ur dhows sail to -oasran wnere they load up with dates, and return to 8ur, and otner local ports, though some go straight on to India etc After a short stay in 8ur they leave again aoout the end of aeptemoex* for India, Zanzibar and Aden taking tne rasran dates with them for sale, naving sold their cargo tney load up with rice etc and return to 8ur at the end of the nortn-east monsoon i.e. aiarch-April. During the south-west monsoon , say from *)une to 8eptember, all the dhows are laid up in Sur harbour. i : ne best period for naval action therefore would appear to be: (1) in early August to prevent the dhows getting out of Sur. (2) In naarch and April to prevent the dhows getting into Sur. (3) In April and ^ay to destroy the dhows in the harbour. a. presen t situation in Sur . s*r.

To The Political Agent* Unsoat. Sub J .at: SIB. amorandua . 4 t Reference your memorandum No«83-C f dated 8th July 1930. 2. I recently diaousaed the question of bringing pressure to baar on Sur f or rather on the Beni Bu Ali, with the late Senior Naral Officer, who had himself visited the place. He stated that there was no difficulty about preventing dhows from leaving Sur ; the Sur dhows are very large and the water on the bar is so shallow that they are towod outside the bar with absolutely nothing in theia. The mast and other gear are subsequently taken out and put in the dhow outside the bar* Nothing would be simpler than for one of His Majesty^ ships to prevent those dhows leaving Sur. On the other hand the large majority of these dhows belong to the Jenebah and as they acknowledge the soverOignty of Muscat there would be no justification for stopping their dhows* I understand that your predecessor stated that out of some 150 dhows at Sur only about 8 or 10 belong to the Beni Bu All* Thus at least nine out of every ten of the Sur dhows would have to be allowed to proceed* 3 . The question then arises whether the detention of the Beni Bu All dhows would bring the Amir of Jaalan, who lives in the interior and who would- 2 - would preiumbly not l»c seriously inconvenienced 'by the detention of a few dhows, to his senses. These dhows belong presumably to a small section of the trios who live on the eoaet, and I do not know how far their detention would affeet the tribe as a whole. It is this question that I propose to investigate when I go to Sur # out 1 should be glad if you could obtain the views of the Muscat State authorities on this point. that the tribe who, as far as I am aware, live principally in the interior and exist on their date groves, herds, eto., would be seriously inconvenienced by the detention of dhows belonging to a few of their members who happen to reside on the coast. • 5 .

SUBJECT: SUR Memorandum. r your memorandum U0.349-S of 15th July here on ny arrival from Muscat today. The office type- writer is up, and I am writing this in a hurry to try and catch the Air Mail which closes shortly. to that place is two-fold' (a) to prevent the Bani Bu Ali from interfering in SUR / ('b) to make the Jeneheh pay up their Customs dues. ^t is true that the Jeneheh acknowledg the sovereignty of the Muscat State ( vide para 2 of your memorandum under reference) hut not the extent of paying up their full dues. It is the Jenebeh who occupy Sur and' it is from them that the Sur dues are due. 3. In this connection it would appear necesaeix^ to have from the Muscat State some clear statement as to which sections of the Sur population pay dues ( i.e.the / 30,000. mentioned in para 6 of my memorandum No.83-C), and which default. Is it the case that all importers of goods paying a fraction of what they should, or do some pay the full amount of their dues and others nothing at all ? \ 4. With this information in our possession we could 2. As 1 see the SUR situation our object with regard consider the advisibility of bringing pressure to bear on the Jenebeh to pay up what they owe. The extent to whichm - 2 - v/h-ich. back dues should be demanded from them would be a matter for consideration. 5, If the Bani Bu Ali (see para 3 of my memo. No.83-C) refrain in the future __ as they appearto be doing forthe moment - from interfering in Sur affairs, they can be left to themselves and their truculent letters can be ignored. Frima facie the most hopeful way of countering their interference in Sur would be to try and detach from them the two sections of the Jenebeh at present allied to them. A step in this direction would be to compose the existing blood-faud which at present splits the Jenebeh in half (vide para 4 of my memorandum No.83-C). 6. I regret that not being in Muscat I am unable to confirm from the Council of State the proportion of Sur dhows owned by the Jenebeh and Bani Bu Ali, but certainly the greater portion of them belongs to the former.35 / 134 .

At the back of the town is a large creek, the entrance to wiuch is a very narrow channel to the South of the town. On the opposite side of the entrance is the small hamlet of Aiqa. Sur is entirely peopled by Arabs of ths Jennebeh tribe, while Aiqa belongs to the Baal Bu All. fhcre is a long-standing blood feud between the Bani Bu Ali and the Jeanebeb, but the Jennebeh who coneist of four sections — the Arsxna, the Fuwarie, the iaakhanneh and the Ghialin-are also divided among themselves, and since 1913 there has been a blood feud between the Arama and the Fuwaris on the one hand and the ^akhanneh and the Ghlalin on the other. Affrays ^ive taken place between the two contending parties; a number of lives have been lost and Sur is at present an armed camp in which no man stirs abroad without a rifle and a dagger. The Jennebeh are largely a sea-faring tribe and possess some 60 lar^e dhows and amny smaller craft, y 'fhe former leave Sur about the middle of August and proceed to Basrah where they load with dates which they sell either in India or in Aden and from India some of the dhows proceed to “mst Africa whence they bring cargoes of timber^ etc.,while others bring Indian merchan dise such as rice, piece-goods etc.,direct to Sur. The voyages generally last from the middle of August to aboutv&gt;\y •5- about April or Kay and on them the population are largely dependent for their livelihood though they also own a few date groves in the interior* 5« The &gt;ani Bu Ali on the other hand are essentially an inland tribe and their headquarters are at y&amp;alan where they own extensive date plantations. The small settlement of the Haai Bu All at Aiqa only own about 7 or 8 dhows* The Shaikh of the Bani Bu Ali is one Ali Bin Abdullah, a young man who is largely in the hands of his relatives and who, as the Government of India are aware, has recently claimed to be an independ ent Euler. These pretensions have taken the fora of hoisting his own flag at Aiqa, issuing passports in his own name to aeabers of his tribe, and the levying of taxes on ths Jennsbeh dhows entering the ^&gt;ur creek. This claim is of comparatively recent origin and in the past the oaai Bu Ali have on several occasions rendered assistance to the oultan of kueeat* The Ghaikh is still in receipt of a regular allowance from Isuseat for services rendered in 189band the Aaire of Jaal&amp;n have been accorded in return for asslstanee rendered in 1870 the privilege of importing goods through Sur free of cuetoms duty* I was given to understand during ths interview which I had with Shaikh Ali that the chief cause whicn gave rise to these pretensions was the visit of some Anglo-iersian Oil Company geologists to that part of Oman territory in 1925 and the rumoured intention of the Muscat Government to grant mineral coneessions in Bani Bu Ali territory. The Bani Bu Ali appeared to bebe afraid that cunceuaioue would be granted by th« ilucoat GoTernaent to &amp; iUuropean or other syndicate and that they would reeeire no share of the resulting profit and seeing the weakness of the Muscat Adminis tration they had advanced this claim in the hope that if admitted it wo Id prevent the Museat Government giving concessions in their territory* 6m Owing to the dissensions among the Jennebeh the -ani Bu All have of late years succeeded in inter* fering in various ways in ;;or affairs* The Aranus and the Buwaris are more powerful than the other two sections of the Jennebeh and the latter in order to obtain support against the former have sought the aid of the ani Bu Aii and adopted a submissive attitude towards them in many respects* hor instance, 1 was informed that the taxes on dhows entering the bur creek had only been paid by the ! akhanneh and the Ghialin and had never been paid hy the Arama and the Fuwaris* ?• -hen 1 visited huseat last beee/fesr His Highness appealed to me to re-establish his authority at bur and it thersfore seemed necessary firstly to try and induce the Ahaikin of the 6ani du All to abandon his pretensions to be independent of unseat and secondly to put an end if possible to the prevailing feuds at bur so that the ifuscat State might be able to assert its authority, and obtain incidentally enhanced revenues from the Customs receipts* b* on arrival at bur i had a lon&amp; discussion1 6 - -5- disoussion with th« Wall who informed me firatXy that the attitude of the Bani Bu AXi wae coneiderauly leee aggresa- ire than it had been formerly) no efforte hare been made to leyy taxes on the dhows entering the Sur creek) the so called 'Wall * of Aiqa had been removed and there was for the moment no opon interference by the ^ani hu AXi in Sur affairs* he attributed this to two causes) firstly to a letter I had addressed to Shaikh Ali informing him that the British GoTernmeut could not recognise his claim £&gt; be regarded as an independent huler and secondly to the strong action taken by the British Government in support of ths Muscat State recently at Khas&amp;ab* ^ stated how ever that as long as the Jennsbeh were divided among themselves the Bani Bu Ali would always have scope for intrigue and interference in Sur affairs and informed me that he had been endeavouring to compose their differences, as he felt tfc&amp;t if this eould be done they would present s united front to the Bani Bu Ali and would themselves resist any attempts by the latter to interfere* in the afternoon therefore I went ashore at i.ur and met the leading men of the four seetions of the Jonnebah* I found them on ths whole an attrastive people, much more virile and out-spoken for instance^ than the Arabs of the Trucial Coast or other places on the Persian Gulf littoral* fhey all assured me that they were heartily sick of the existing state of affairs and would gladly co-operate to arndte peace, but the difricul y was that there was no one with sufficient authority or personality amo&amp;g them to make peace or impose his authority upon all the four sections* The Muscat StateState had officially reeogniaed one nember of the Majaleh - the :&gt;haikhly family - as head of the Sur Jennebeh but while the Arama and the Fuwaris accepted him the Makhanneh and the Ohialin did not and had another candidate* I impressed upon them however the advantages of union and urged them to put an end to the existing dissensions and suggested that they might appeal to the Muscat authorities to nominate an independent arbitrator* They did not definitely reject tne proposal and as they seemed to he tired of the existing stale of affairs X am hopeful that somethin^ may come of it* Anyhow discussions are in progress and the &gt;ali told me that he thought it would be possible to make puaee between the four sections* I am bringing these facts to the notice of the muscat authorities and trust that the,* sill co-operate and endeavour to bring about a settlement* If this can be done then X think that the &amp;&lt; ni Hu ;*li will have very much less opportunities for interference in 3ur affairs in the future* 10* the following morning I went ashore at Aiqa and interviewed the leading members of the ani Bu Ali community* Aiqa boasts of an imposing flag staff fixed in the ground and on the arrival of; the man-of-war a much faded flag, the original colours of whieh seem to be red, white and green, had been hoisted* As there was no one in Aiqa who had any authority to disouss the matter X sent word to dhaikh Ali that I would be returning to Sur in 5 days' time and asked him to cime down and see me, and then left in H*Ji«3*'Iriad* for Khor Jarama he newly discovered sanitarium^where the climate is many degrees cooler than any where else on the Oman coast or in thethe i ersian Gulf^ as the Senior jiaral officer was anxioue to visit it in order to give hie men &amp; few da^e in which to recuperate, i’hree days later we returned to Sur and that afternoon Shaikh AJLi oame on uoard with eome of liie relatione. A prolonged dieouseicn took place* the out. come of which however was ultimately satisfactory since the Shaikh gave me &amp; definite assurance that he would no longer fly his own flag at Aiqa and would cease to issue his own passports, he advanced various alleged grievances which he had against the Muscat State* hut X told him that it was obvious that the £ial* could not listen to his griev&amp;ncss so long as he persisted in his claim to independence. I was confident however that if this claim was abandoned any grievances he had against the 2 Lu 3 cat State would be sympathetically considered. lie advanced the question of mineral concessions and asked me whether the Muscat Stale were entitled to grant concessions in his territory without reference to hifla T I said tnat i could not answer a question of that nature off hand but cited the analogy of the Bakhtiari tribe and the h* Ar«y concession and informed him that while the Persian Govern* sent took royalties the Bakhtiari tribe also had derived very substantial financial benefits from the concession and that if any similar concessions were granted in .man, ol which however I had heard no rumours wiiatsoevarji uhou ,:it i pro able that tne tribe within whose territory those concessions were granted would inevitably share in e profits. finally 1 advised the bhaikh to go and visit the Sultan when he returns from India and he seemed inclined to do so. The refusal to allow him to fly hishi» own flag was obviously a bitter pill for him ^o swallow, but 1 think he means to fulfil his undertaking. If he does, then this may be regarded as the abandonment of his claim for independence and if peace can also be established among the four sections of the Jennebeh, the risk of future interference by the ^ani Bu Ali in Sur affairs will have been pr ctically removed. There remains the question of the our cust ms. Mr.Thoms a, the Waslr of the Muscat State, informed me that they had recently been getting larger sums xrom ur than they had ever got before though the depreciation of the dollar was adversely affecting the rupee v lue of the^ofeitts. I see no reason why it should not be possible for the Muscat authorities themselves to increase this amount substantially in the future, with possibly a little moral support on our part. Many ti les were told me from independent sources oi tne venality and corruption of the customs administration at ^ur. The Director of Customs there is an Indian who has lived the whole of his life in Sur and is to all intents and purposes a Suri. It is obviously undesirable to have in this post a local man who is on terms oi close intimacy with the leading inhabitants. the ieelin t there seems to be that as long as a reasonable amount is sent 0y©ry year to Muscat nothing will be said ami no Httejn^rs toe made to tighten up the customs administratiom such a sum is therefore remitted to Muscat as i was thought will keep the State authorities quiet. Since recently some attention has been directed to Sur the revenues have gone up slightly, but I believe rhat it* -9- if energetic eteps were taken by the Muscat authorities to improve the cuetoms administration and put an end to the dishonesty that prerails there substantially larger sums could be collected. I am bringing the state of affairs there to the notice of the Political Agent and am directing him to suggest to the State authorities that the present Director of Customs should be replaced by an outsider who has no connection with Sur and that, if necessary, a few additional guards should be provided. The State authorities will undoubtedly have to proceed somewhat tactfully at first since they have allowed this state of affairs to prevail for many years and a sudden tightening up would doubtless produce widespread resentment on the part of the local inhabitants, but if the situation is properly handled I see no reason why there should not be a gradual but steady increase in the Sur customs within the next few years. 12. It will thus be seen that the Bani Bu Ali have abandoned their claim to independence. Secondly efforts are now being made to put an end to the blood feud which has prevailed for some years among the Jennebeh; if the efforts are successful the power of the Bani Bu Ali on the coast will be definitely weakened. finally 1 think it should be possible for the Muscat authorities themselves to increase the Sur revenues by a general iagprovement of the customs administration without any action on our part other possibly than the occasional visit of a man-of-war- 10 - man-of-war to that port; 1 Relieve that a personal visit hy His Highness the Sultan to Sur next winter would have a very good effect. In the circumstances I do not think it necessary to take any action at present at Sur and it will suffice for the time being to watch future developments which will, 1 trust, be such as to obviate any necessity for the use of force. , luce writ ag the afeeve 1 have reeeive* a telegram from the senior aval Officer stating tnat the lair of Ja’alan imm struck his flag at il*a and has hoisted the Hueeat flag.

You may have perhaps received from the Admiralty some papers about Sur. A certain Shaikh has been giving trouble there and has tried to pretend that he is independent ol Muscat, and the Sultan appealed to us for support against him. I had never visited this place before and have received, I think, rather exaggerated accounts of the difficulties of dealing with this i ^ v 1 ''om tiie local officers and had suggested to the Government of India the desirability of taking action to vindicate the authority of the Muscat State. It seemed a somewhat difficult case for the Mavy to deal with it themselves in that the Shaikh himself lives about 40 miles inland and was inaccessible from the sea.

I am aware that steps are being trken to improve matters and that we rhall shortly have 3 new sloops of greater speed and radius and as the Basidu guard has now been abolished they will not have to visit Basidu as often in the future as they have had to do in the past. At the same time 1 understand that the dates of arrival of 'Hastings' and 'Penzance' are some what indeterminate and that the 'Lupin' goes home shortly. *Qydamen' has to go down for overhaul next month and i understand that 'Folkestone' also wishes to visit a dock yard soon for minor adjustments. There would seem to be therefore a likelihood that we may again be reduced to one sloop in the Gulf for considerable periods. 1 do not know whether it will be possible to do anything to remedy this state of affairs, but I should like to say that 1 attach the greatest importance to the frequent visits of ships to many places in the Gulf which have not seen a warship for some time, and if anything could be done either to hasten the arrival of one of the other sloops or to keep the 'Lupin' until she arrives, X should be very grateful* The Persian Gulf is a place where there always seems to be something happening somewhere or other and if we have only one sloop up here matters are occasionally difficult and the ship in question frequently has rather a strenuous time. I realise of course that it may not be possible to do anything in the matter and if so we shall have to carry on as best we can till the new sloops arrive: I thought however that you would not mind ngr mentioning it.

To, The Secretary to the Hon*ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire* I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No.416-S of 16th August 1930. 2. I am glad to note that the Hon’ble the Political Resident, in his letter to Government, confirmed the views I had pre viously expressed to him with regard to the policy of composing the differences of the Jenebeh (my letter No.K/l of 28th July para 5)^and of there being no necessity for action on our part at Sur at present (my letter No.83-C of 6th July para 6). 3. I have taken the opportunity of Mr. Thomas’s presence here to discuss the matter of Sur Customs with him, and enclose herewith a copy of a D.O. letter which he has addressed to me on the subject. It will be seen that with regard to exports,the taxes on dates and fish,(practically the only commodities sent out of the port),are considerably less than those taken else where in the State i.e. at Batinah and Gwadur respectively, the reason being that Sur is distinctly less under control than of either/these areas. Mfc. Thomas is of opinion that to raise the duty on these commodities to the same flat rate as else where would probably require force, or a threat of it, from H.M’s Government. He thinks that some increase could be made, Subject:- Surbut that this should be done very cautiously* (para VI of his letter). The Political Resident is also of opinion that caution is necessary, and so am I* It i^'easy to get one rupee f s worth of crops out of the ground by putting two rupees intoit M , and to increase the Sur revenues to the extent of entailing «^for this reason alone - our active intervention, would hardly be worth while* The object is of course to strike the happy mean. of dishonest manifests. (Para V of Mr. Thomas’s letter). It is the business of the Sur Customs officials to check these as yet has not sufficient prestige to give them the necessary backing. personnel. It will be seen from para VII of Mr. Thomas’s letter that measures have already been taken to check the mal^adminis- tration of the Sur Customs Director^by sending there an ’appraiser’ under orders which virtually place him over the Director. Mr. Thomas likewise informs me that Saiyid Said is visiting Sur very shortly to make enquiries on the spot. The Director General of Customs, Iskander Effendi, is also return ing from leave almost immediately, and his views should be of value with regard to a new Director* Under these circumstances I venture to suggest that the question of^new Director be left over for the moment until I return to Muscat at the end of next month, when I will take an early opportunity of visiting Sur, and that the representations which the Political Resident wishes me to make to the State (on the subject of the Customs adminis tration at Sur) be likewise postponed until then. 4. The chief leakage with by the use documents, but here they meet with opposition, and the State 5 . ^ith reference to the matter of the Sur Customs I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant Major, Political Agent and H.B.M’s Consul, MuscatCopy of a letter dated Karachi 18th September 1930 from Mr. B.S.Thomas, Finance Minister, Muscat State, to Major T.C.Fowle, C.B.E., Political Agent &amp; H.B.M's Consul, The points which we discussed yesterday are as follows.- (i) The nature of Customs leakage is two fold affecting exports and imports in a like degree. (II) In theory an export tax is not Customs: in practice, in regarded to.square with Commercial Treaties as Zakat which is otherwise uncollectable in the interior*. This export tax in the Batinah is a flat 5 ^ of assessed value except in case of firewood ?-£ In Sur ; however^ where exports consist chiefly of^- (a) Bisr (i.e.e dried dates) from Sharkiyah and Ja , alan # (b) Dried fish this system of a percentage value does not hold. (III) The *Bisr’ tax at Sur is a tax on each camel load of of the commodity arriving from the interior. If I remember rightly n dollars - I increased it recently against the fall in the exchange and in the degree suggested by the TCali who considered any bigger increase may cause trouble. I doubt whether the yield of this tax is more than % of the value. (IV) Fish catches at Sur bear a normal tax based on auction value, in accordance with old usage. If another more rigid system, that of farming G-overnment* s share to a contractor as is done in Gwadur were practicable - which it is not under present conditions and without the application of force - it would I consider produce some Rs.8000/- a year - about twice as .much, as the present yield. The Gwadur system referred to is to auction Government* share of xj\0 of the catch for the ensuing year to a contractor. He is a fish merchant, meets each boat, takes Government’s share \j[0 of each variety of fish caught Muscat, on recess at Karachi. Customs leakage at Sur the Muscat State^ it is and has bee so and can befor his own, and at the end of the month pays intd Customs total value in accordance with a schedule of variety values embodied in his contract* (V) Imports into Sur largely for Sharkiyah and Ja*alan y consist of rice, coffee, sugar, piece-goods and the usual miscellaneous list of Arab wants* The manner of leak/t^is largely as follows: The dhow Captain-Cum-Shipper at the Indian port cook the manifest. It is simple to show cargo destined entirely for Sur to be sho^n only in part going there, the remaining half perhaps marked down for Mukalla or some South Arabian port. The dhow on arrival at Sur thus escapes proper appraisement: indeed for years past Customs officials have from time to time been prevented from boarding: they must accept manifest figures. (VI) The difference of the proportionate Customs yield bet ween Sur and Batinah is due to the fact that the former is dis tinctly less under control than the latter, and if an attempt were made to increase the Sur percentage up to the Batinah level it would require force, ora threat of it, from H.M f s Government. Perhaps some increase can be made, but this should be conducted with caution and effected very slowly* (VII) As regards the Customs personnel^ as a result of complaints I sent a new appraiser to Sur some three weeks ago under orders which virtually place him over the present M’amur. The suggestion of the latter’s removal is one I suggest that wfrre 10 should jeaxfc await the return (expected almost at once) of the Director General of Customs, Iskandar Effendi, from leave in Egypt, as he himself has been stationed at Sur as M'amur, under stands the individual motives of the locals who desire changes, and has an intimate knowledge of his own staff, and the suitabilpCj of this or that candidate as a M’amur*lift far 3 5/134. 33/^ Extract from letter Ho.E.1.200, dated 17th September of Hie Majesty' e Naval forces in the East Indies,Admiralty House, Trine omali 9 to Lt#Gol»H» V#Liscoe» M'lcAr^ 'xftfi*) 3.

The Jenebeh have patched up their quarrel, and the Bani Bu Ali have actually flo^n the State’s flag. 2. A most satisfactory feature in connection *'ith this ’change of heart’ on the part of the Suris, in view of the greater responsibilities which he may have to assume in the future (if the Sultan persists in abdicating) is the part that has been played by Saiyid Said. o. V/ith regard to the Customs Ma’mur. There may be something in the Director General 1 s contention that the complaints against the Ma’mur are not altogether disinterested. At any rate now that the Customs Department is actually tightening up its administration the zeal of the Banias for reform appears to have slackened, and I have received a long protest from them against the enhanced ’bisr’ dues.

He succeeded in patching up the quarrel between the t^o opposing factions, the policy you proposed you may remem ber in your report to P.R. The Bani 3u Ali appear to have lowered their flag at Aija for good and actually flew the red flag and fired salutes for Saiyid Sa’id. The situation is much improved. As regards para III of my note to you in Karachi on Customs leakage the D.G.Customs of the State^ Iskandar Effendi^has just returned from leave from Egypt^ and I have directed him to change the Ma’mur of Sur, Muhamad Ali, as soon as convenient. He is of opinion that the complaints against this Ma’mur are chiefly due to the latter’s insistence on proper Customs collections: regards the allegations of corruption which I have heard about as a put up job by merchants (i) for ousting him, and (ii) securing the succession of a man who ™ili realise it is not to his interests to be too conscientious. The D.G. win however carry out my instruc tions in the course of the month. I enclose t^o letters from the Ma’mur himself. Saiyid Said informs me that the bisr tax of dollars l£ per camel load w as paid by all Arab subjects promptly and without demur and most British ones except the t w o influential banias Khimji Ramdas and Shabika who however paid it under protest.

I am therefore to suggest that the Muscat State should endeavour to get in personal touch with Shaik All of Ja* alan , either by inviting him to Muscat , or arranging a meeting between him and the representative of the Muscat State, ano if necessary yourself, at Sur. 3. From his own personal experien-e of ^haik Ali, Colonel Biscoe does not think that he will resist any rea- -sonable uronosals uut before him by the state. The action— *action taken by his Majesty^ Government at khasab; the fact that the Hon*ole the political kesiaent has himself uiseosbect matters with Jkaikh Ali at Sur; the more fre- -qtent visits of ships to Khor-Jaramah and other places in the vicinity, all must have impressed upon his people that His Majesty's Government are behind the Muscat Jtate. This in itself is a valuable asset and will make them think twice before resisting altogether the demands of the state. Geconal^, it is so obvious that their maritime trade can be controlled by the sea that a hint to this effect will probablysuffice, and Colonel Biscoe does not think that there is any necessity at present to consider the question of sending a sloop to Bur. The Honourable the political Resident therefore hopes that the luscat Jtate will take the necessary steps to get in touch with Sheikh Ali and t. tighten up generally their control over the Bur customs, ana will be interested to hear in uue course the results of any measures they may take.

Political Agency &amp; H.B.M’s Consulate, Muscat, the 12th February 1931 To The Hon ’hie the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf Pjushire • Subj ect:- S U R. Sir, In continuation of my telegram No.180 of 5th February, I have the honour to report that Mr. Hedgcock and myself left Muscat, on the State gunboat w Al Saidi”, at 10 A.M. on the 6th instant for Sur and returned at 1 a*M* on the 11th. We encountered very rough weather on our way down and reached Sur, after putting for some hours into Khor Khairan, at 7 A.M. on the 7th» Disembarkation at Sur was a matter of some difficulty owing to heavy surf, and the huri (small native boat) in which Mr. Hedgcock and I landed was partially pooped and nearly swamped. However eventually our party, the Sub-Assistant Surgeon - whom I had taken to treat the local inhabitants, Mr. Iskander Hanna, Director-General of Customs, the Agency Interpreter, servants and kit , was landed safe and sound. We stayed at the customs House, and were reasonably comfortable. We were hospitably received by the Wali and Sheikh Nasir bin Ali of the Arama section, and the demeanour of the inhabitants v/as friendly. We visited Balad-as-Sur in company of the Wali, and also made a prolonged inspection of Aiqa. We made detailed enquiries on various aspects of the Sur problem from numerous individuals and I think, with the information already*on the files, mre now in a position to Envisage the Sur problem with its many ramifications. 2. I took the opportunity to gather the Sheikhs of the Jenebeh together in the presence of the wali and to2 1 congratulate them on the sensible way in which they had composed their differences, as a result of which the town was now enjoying period of peace and quiet which it had not known lor some timeo I told them that I would inform the Council ol State, and yourself whom I was going to see on iriday, oi this continued satisfactory state of affairs. 3. It appears that Sheikh Nasir bin Ali of the Arama section is on bad terms v/ith Sheikh Nasir bin Mohammed the paramount Sheikh of that section. I asked these two, Sheikhs to stay behind when others had gone, and in the presence of the ./ali asked them to try and compose their differences© ^.s the cause ol the quarrel between the two is a serious blood feud I do not know what effect my exordium had, but -t may serve to keep them quiet for the time being. Perhaps later on the Council might try its hand at composing the feud. 4. The visit of the Sub-Assistant Surgeon, whom I had taken with us with the object of showing the people of Sur that we took a friendly interest in them, and that they need not always associate our visits with bombardments and such like, was a distinct success. He treated some two hundred oases during the three days he was there. 5. ,,e lei t our at 11 A.M. on the 10th. We had intended visiting Khor Jerama, but were unable to do so owing to the threat of more bad weather, and reached Muscat after another rough passage. Previous bombardments etc at Sur . 6. Since it is more or less certain that the Sur problem v.-ill net, oe solved without the exercise of force, or the threat of it by His Majesty* s Government - the Muscat State being too weak to enforce Customs control by itself - it may 'be irts~t*ucti*e to study briefly the history of the past bombardments etc at Sur.3o 7. One of the earliest on record was in 1866 when, on the Jeneloeh having plundered British subjects, and having refused to pay the compensation of $ 27,700 H.M.S.'Highflier' homharded the town, and burnt or confiscated its dhows 0 (For this and the following incidents, as well as for other useful information about Sur see Major Murphy*s Report on 8ui dated the 10th October 1928)• In 1875 a godown of a British Indian subject was looted by a section of Jenebeh, but it was not until two years later that the Political Agent, Muscat, was authorized to appear off the town in K.M,S.'Teazer' and demand compensation which was paid. In 1^918 H.H.Sultan visited Sur, fined the Jenebeh Rs. 14,000 ana i^P^soned 26 Sheijths. In 1919 the Muscat Customs were reorganized, but the inhabitants of Sur refused to allow the new Customs House to be built, and in 1920 Captain McCollum - the then Wazir - visited Sur in H.M.S. 'Britomart' &lt;&gt; The Jenebeh agreed to accept the new arrangements, but smuggling soon began again and the new Customs House was not built. In 1923, the authority of the Council having been openly flouted. Captain Alban, then inocommand of the Muscat Levy Corps, in company with Sheiieh Zubair the Minister of Justice, proceeded to Sur in the 'A1 Saidi' with three machine guns and 150 Levies. Blood feuds were composed by oheiidi Zubair, $ 6,400 Customs dues were recovered from the merchants, a fine of # 4,000 was taken from the Jenebeh, ana a site for the Customs House selected. This energetic domiciliary visit would seemtZ to have achieved complete success. yet the Customs House remained unbuilt, and before long quarrels amongst the Jenebeh started once more, in 1£27 Mr. Thomas, who was then Wazir, proceeded to Sur in the 'A1 baidi' to induce the Jenebeh to pay up 2£- lakhs which they owed to K.B.Hassib and other merchants in Muscat, and to demolish forts which the Jenebeh had built contrary to the orders of the Council. Neither were the debts paid, nor the xorts demolished, and on leaving Sur with a captured Jenebeh dhow in tow the '. A l baidi» was fired on. TheCouncil fined the Jenebeh 10,000, hut - as far as I know - have nelrer been able to recover ito In August 1928 about 15 of Fuwaris Jenebeh looted a dhow belonging to a British subject, and coromitted various other misdeeds© In October of the same year certain members of the Council proceeded to Sur in the M A1 Saidi', escorted by H.M.S.'Crocus', and bombarded a fort which the l*uwaris culprits had occupied* v The gun carried by the 'A1 Saidi' is too small to have any appreciable effect on the fort* However, the Fuwaris feigned submission, and the Council returned to Muscat* Directly the Council’s back was turned the Fuwaris reoccupied t ^ the fort* In November the 'Cyclamen', accompanied by the \f d ^ * * 'Effingham' - the flag ship of the East Indies Squadron - visited Sur vi/ith the Political Agent on board, bombarded the Fuwaris fort, demolished it, and left for Muscat. But the long projected Customs House still remained unbuilt, and the town was soon once more plunged into disorder by the quarrels of the Jenebeh Conclusion to be drawn from the Bombardments etc at Sur. ItA I venture to think that one very important conclusion can be drawn from the incidents detailed in the previous paragraph: they show that we have had no settled policy at Sur. Some outrage, or act of disobedience to the Muscat State, is perpetrated by the Suris. Action in the shape of a bombardment etc of the town is taken. This action in itself is occasionally quite successful, but it is never followed up, the effect is purely ephemeral, and the town relapses into its former anarchial and semi-rebellious conditions. In other word£ to compare a very small problem to a very large one, our policy in Sur, (and that of the Muscat State), has been what it was in former years on the North T aest Frontier; dubbed by its critics as that of 'tip and run', or more harshly of 'burn and scuttle'. More rec ent developments © °. More recently affairs in Sur have taken a slightly ;?o,5 happier turn. In my letter No.83-C of 8th July 1930 I stated that - on the negative side - I was definitely against the proposal of sending a large military force to Sur until all other means had been tried, and that - on the positive side 4“ v i&lt;ie my letter NooKol of 28th July 1930)- an attempt might be made to compose the differences of the Jenebeh in order to consolidate them into a more or less solid block against the intrigues of the Bani bu Ali. Both these views had your approval. The project of sending a military force has been dropped for the time being, and as a result of your visit to Sur in August of last year the Bani bu Ali hauled down their flag lat Aiqa, and the Jenebeh began to compose their differences. Said Saiyid followed to Sur this up with successful visit-in September (vide my letter No.K-107 of 9th October 1930). Since then I have paid two visits to Sur - one in the M Triad M last November and again a few days ago. The net result has been that the town - which was in a state of anarchy - is quiet, the Jenebeh united, and as far as Mr.Hedgcock and I could ascertain inclined to be friendly both towards us and the State, and the influence of the Bani bu Ali in the town much decreased. That this state of affairs is likely to last indefinitely, or even for very long, is unlikely: blood fueds still exist between the principal sheikhs, vide para 3 above. The Council should direct their energy towards composing these lueds, even if the composition is only of a temporary nature, to allow time for our plans to mature. In this . connection I may remark that, from what I heard at Sur, Said Saiyid made very good impression on the Jenebeh on his visit of last September. A Sheikh for Aiqa . ^• in the same way that we have had some success - at least temporarily - in forming the Jenebeh into a block against the Bani bu Ali, it may be possible to form the Bani bu Ali elements in Aiqa into a similar block against therest of the^tribe. The line to take would be for the Council to recognise the headman of Aiqa as a Sheikh, offer him a monthly subsidy and allow him some other financial advantages in the shape of free registration of his dhows etc* The Council would be the body to say whether such a policy is practicable, and I propose suggesting this to them ( to Said Saiyid privately in the first instance ) at an early opportunity* Kr♦Hedgcock 1 s Report * 10* i enclose Mr.Hedgcock 1 s report on Sur Customs, the crux of the Sur problem, houghly speaking Mr.Hedgeocx*s main arguments run as follows 1. The Muscat State is nearly bankrupt, S* -i-ts financial re-establishment depends on the enforcement of Customs dues. 3.Sur - after Muscat and Matrah - is the richest Customs port in 0;nan, but it ia not under effective Customs control of the khscat State. 4. To enforce this control, and all that this control implies^ two customs posts must be built at Sur, one in Muqrumtain and in Aiqa. The one in Aiqa to be garrisoned by 25 men of the Muscat Levy. 5. If effective Customs control is not established shortly at Sur, such control as exists will in all probability become less and less. This will in its turn react unfavourably on the other Omani ports i.e. by diverting trade to the practically M free port” of Sur, and by encouraging other ports to resist Customs control. The inevitable result will be that the financial re-establish- ment of the State will be rendered very difficult, if not impossible, and its disintegration will be brought a long step nearer. 11 Speaking generally I agree with the above views.If the Ban! bu All pr#re amenable It may t beweTer p be possible to dispense with the post at Aiqa. Measures for enforcing Customs control 12. Y/ith regard to the all important question of what measures we should adopt to enforce Customs control at Sur I have to make the following tentative suggestions: tentative since the issues involved are complicated and far reaching and I should like a little more time to examine some of them. As, however, you are arriving tomorrow I feel it will be a distinct advantage for there to be some suggestion ready for your consideration, which will, at any rate, form a basis for discussion whether finally adopted or not. / 13. In my memorandum No. 83-C, dated the 8th July '1930, I pointed out that owing to movements of the Sur dhows, and to the configuration of the Sur creek, it would be quite easy for a sloop stationed at the mouth of the creek, in May, to prevent dhows entering the creek, and in August to prevent the dhows leaving. The exact dates of the entering, and leaving of the dhows, vide Mr Hedgcock*s Report, are - respectively - 15th May to 15th June, and 15th August to 15th September. What I have in mind is that on about 15th June when all the dhows are safely laid up in the creek, the Council should announce that no dhow will be allowed to leave the creek until the Jenebeh and the Bani bu Ali - the parties concerned - agree to an effective Customs control.( ~\l 8 . 14. The Council would let it be known that they had the support of His Majesty^ Government, and a sloop would, if necessary, be stationed at the mouth of the creek to see that dhows did not come out. lb. With regard to the Jenebeh. By far the greater part of the large^ number of the dhows which 'monsoon' in Sur belong to the Jenebeh; the dhow trade is their life, and a threat to it is a threat to their existence. Short of accepting the Council’s terms I see only one ’card’ that the Jenebeh can play: a threat to the lives or property, or both, of the British Indian subjects - some twenty Bannias - at Sur, but reply to that would be that any outrages on British subjects would be met with the severest penalties, fines or otherwise, and as the dhows would be still in the creek these penalties would not be difficult to enforce. From what I have been able to gather, however, I do not anticipate much opposition from the Jenebeh. 16. The Bani bu Ali are a different proposition, but can be divided into two parts those at Aiqa: and those in Ja’alan. The former are in much the same position as the Jenebeh since they are seafaring folk, and own the balance of the dhows, about a dozen in number according to present iniormation, which do not belong to Jenebeh. Bani'-bu Ali 17. The Ja’alan/are the crux of the situation. As ^/^i awar 5/ the y ? laim Aiqa. and it is this claim which renders Customs contror^neffecfiv^A-fo^e^ffier /3 nand a lairly large quantity of dates is exported from Ja’alan all of which goes via Sur, and the holding up of these dates would undoubtedly bring pressure to bear on the Bani bu Ali. Dates from Bani bu Hasan, and the Sharkiah tribes under the Imam, are also exported via Sur, and wedo not want of course to penalise these tribes* It might be possible, however, through the Customs administration to discriminate between the Ja*alan dates and the others* and to forbid merchants to purchase the former since their export would not be permitted* It may be noted as a most important point that the Bani bu Hasan and the Sharkiah tribes, who are Hinawis, have no love for the Jenebeh and the Bani bu Ali who are Ghafiris* In fact more than once of late years Sheikh Isa bin Salih has written to the Council and to the Political Agent objecting in the strongest terms to the interference of the Bani bu Ali in Sur* Personal intercourse with the Bani bu Ali and Jenebeh Sheiidas o 18* I feel on a perusal of the files that until recently intercourse with the Jenebeh and Bani bu Ali has been conducted at ’’long range' 1 by means of letters rather than by personal intercourse, which is generally preferred by Arabs* On the issue of the announcement by the Council referred to above in para 13, an invitation would also be issued to the Jenebeh and Bani bu Ali Sheikhs, particularly to Sneikh Ali bin Abdullah, to come to discuss the question at Muscat with the Council, yourself - if you so desire - and myself* It would be pointed out to the Sheikhs that nothing new was intended, merely the collection of dues which had been the right of the State from time immemorial* That as far as the Bani bu Ali are concerned their claim to Aiqa, only dating from 1924, is quite untenable, and that it was hoped that all concerned would accept the situation sensibly* That if, however, they refused, Kis Majesty’s Government would firmly support the Council, and any regrettable consequences which the tribes might suffer they would bring upon their own heads* It is quite possible that if the situation was put to them in this way the Sheikhs might prove reasonable*10 Support of His Majesty's Government * 19. It will be seen that my suggestion naturally requires the support of His Majesty’s Government, but only to the extent of a single sloop. When putting up the suggestion to Government, if you approve that it should be put up, ( and I would like again to emphasise the fact that it is at present a tentative one subject to further consideration), I think stress might fairly be laid on the fact that we are now attempting to solve the Sur problem once and for all, and in the interest as much of the people of Sur as of the State, since Customs control at Sur will also mean the establishment of general administration control, and the establishment of law and order instead of the customary anarchy. In this connection it might be noted that the State will do its best, if funds permit, to provide a doctor and dispensary for Sur, a humane intention^ which I trust they will be able to carry out.

Confirmatory evidence of the above statements la contained in Appendix A. i) The acquiescence of the Oovernmant of Muscat in the Bani Bu t' All's hold over Alqa has reacted unfavourably on Sur. Though, next to Muscat and Matrah, this port is the largest in Oman, its revenues from customs and zakat are insufficient to pay its own customs ox ficials and the Wall and his staff. As win be seen from the figures in Appendix B, the revenues of last year are easily the lowest on record. To all intents, Sur also is a free port. 4) Control over Sur is vital to Muscat. This was recognized many yea*® ago by the Prenoh and by successive Sultans, today by the present Council of Ministers. The existence wihln a hKndred miles of Muscat of the virtually free port of Sur-Alqa oonstltues a threat to the financial stability of the State, e.g. ^iae loss oT customs revenue 1« at our.

Financially, this would completely cripple the State of iiuseat. •jJ T;ie ;ii at sentlal Is the reoestabliai uent of the State's authority in Sur. Spasmodic attempts to do this in tu# past nave proved abortive. What Is required Is a carefully-planned constructive policy, with aaple preparations and a determination to carry it through even though It tafce several month* to achieve. Without this it night be wiser to leave Sur alone. Once effective adm,ii3trative control has b en gained. It will be possible to consider the tightening up of the customs control. 8 ) It Is claimed that the volume of trade in and out of Sur is equal to that passing through Matrah, whose customs collections are Ra 1,*0,000 p.a. Local enquiries show that Sur Is the port for the rich Sharqlyah district - 14 towns In Badla, Wadi Banl Khalid, -adl Ban! Jahlr and Blldan al Harlth. «5jS of the goods 1 m ed at Sur are destined for these places; of th remaining ~5;t, ss j goes to Js'lan and Htf i 8 retained in Sur and Salad aa Sur.

There is a customs hut, a structure of reeds, at Batfch on one side of the entrance to the Khor, while on the opposite side Aiqa has not so much as this, nor any representative of the local govern ment, Until recently the Bani Bu All maintained their own Wall there, (ii) The Jenabeh make extensive use of faked manifests, Export Tiii) Caravans enter flur at night, via the Sikaikra road, (iv) Caravans come down the Sh&amp;ma Pass, and at low tide pass along the southern shore of the Khor Sur into Aiqa.

It may be mentioned tier* that t e A1 Said was purchased fomr years ago for this very purpose, but beyond one or two Ineffectual visits to Sur has so far done little to Justify her maintenance charges of Rs 3t&gt;,000 p.a. (o) The establidment of a strong fortified customs post near txi^ o. , as an outward symbol of government’s authority on the coast, and as a means of enforcing harbour control. This post should, at any rate to begin with, be manned by a contingent oi uoout ~5 of the Muscat Infantry. The ideal site exists at tne extreme ond of the Alqa promontory, where a half-completed fort already exists, (dee A on attached sketch-map) (d) T he more efficient manning of the various government-owned forts round Sur, also their repair and in one or tit cases re building. These can be garrisoned by aakaris on about Rs 10 p.m. net.

(It is not proposed for the ,resent to apply to Sur the enhanced tariff, if eventua ly sanctioned.) Shaikh Isa and the Imam have already acquiesced in this demand of in other ports supplying the Interior. into open hostility. At the Lioment they are friendly to the central government, and have every reason to dislike the Ban! Bu Ali for the indignities recently heaped .upon them - see Appendix A. If the Jenab&amp;h once see that the government is in earnest, they will probably have enough sense to realize, on the one hand their impotence in the face of the State’s sea-power (the armed A1 Said), and on the other their ability to pass on uost of the customs dues to the tribes of the Interior, possibilities. Ox these^ tne least likely to happen is (b). As regards (.c), the State might perhaps with skilful diplomacy secure the cooperation of the Jenabah and of th e actual Inhabitants of Aiqa, the maritime Banl Bu All. The most dangerous possibility is (a). It la doubtful whether the Amirs of Ja lan will acquiesce In the government's establishment of a fortified post In Alqa, yet this la essential if the Bani 3u Ali are to be prevented from again appointing their on wall and customs offld als. On the other hand, the more prepared and the more resolute the tw© governments are, the smaller the chances of a conflict with the a.m Bu AH, (a) During recent years the State of Muscat's hold over Sur and Its neighbourhood has gradually weakened.

(e) The local tribal situation is at resent favourable to an attempt to reassert the Central Governments authority. (f) The financial advantages outweigh any possible administrative disadvantages. $g) The fuller the preparation, and the greater the determination to re-establish authority, the leas likelihood of resistance. (h) The size of the task is sufficient to warrant the State of Muscat asking for the cooperation of H.B.M.G, For easy reference, a summary is attached (Appendix D) of the various requests of the State. IS) If you concur with the above views, I should be grateful if you would take up with the Hon*ble the Political Resident the question of restoring the authority of the State of Muscat in Sur and its environs. I may add that the general outline of these proposals has been discussed with Saiyid Said, and has his approval. ,C u' l (( Financial Adviser, Muscat Stateimpend ix Gradual assumption of control of Aifa &amp; Sur 'by the Bani Bu # Ali. 1) In 1870 Saiyid Turki, in recognition of their services in connection v/ith his attack in 1'atrah, franted the Amirs of the Bani Bu ’All exemption from the payment of customs on the foods imported for their personal use^ through Sur. In practice this means exemption of zakat on the Amirs* own dry dates, and import exemption on 100 hags of rice. 2) In 1388-9 relations 'between the Bani Bu *dli and the Jenahah ^ere strained and fighting 'broke out. Eventually the Bani Bu *Ali agreed to allow the passage of the Khor Sur to remain entirely in the hands of H.K*s officials and to abide 'by his decision in all local matters. o) Extracts from the Customs Registers show that as recently as 192Z goods imported through Aiga paid customs duties to the Central Government. 4) In 1923 the Amirs claimed in writing that Sur 'belonged to them and that the Sultan had nothing to do with the# pcTt. 5) In April 1928 the Amirs established their own Customs 'ost at Aiga. Their customs officer wrote to the State customs official at Sur demanding a refund of customs on a boat which they claimed belonged to the Bani Bu *Ali. 6) About the same time the Bani Bu *Ali occupied Balad asisur with a view to commanding the water suoply of Sur and thus obtaining mastery over the Jenabah. Peace was eventually made on the following terms. (a) The Aramah and Kakhana sections each to destroy one of their forts. (b) All sections of the Jenabah to pay to the Amirs for one year 20 on each of their boats.

Sugges ted Confe rence, a t bur . 2. Owing to the absence of Saiyid Said, the President of the Council of Ministers, on tour to the Batinah Coast, and to his illness from fever since his return, 1 was only able to take up the matter with the Council at the beginning of April.Owing also to urgent preoccupations with the financial condition of the State I have only now found time to write the following report. 3. 1 informed the Council verbally of the Hobble the Political Resident's opinion that they should get into touch with Ali bin Abdullah, the Amir of Jaalan and the paramount Shaikh of the Bani Bu Ali, and take the necessary steps to tighten up generally their control over the Sur Customs. I suggested that a suitable time for the conference with Shaikh Ali, and the jenebah Shaikhs, at Sur would be when in the Persian (iulf, hushire• Subject:* SUR. Sir, the Persian Gulf fleet concentrated there from the18-20th of this month; the presence of the sloops would doubtless have a moral effect on the tribesmen. 4. They - i.e. Saiyid Said, (Shaikh Zubair normally agrees with whatever the former says, though he has plenty 0 f natural shrewdness of his own), said that until they had JUUUC a definite promise of assistance from His Majesty’s Government in the shape of a sloop to bombard if necessary, they would prefer not to call the conference. They quite realised that the recent trend of events had increased the prestige of muscat and they were grateful to the Political Resident for the interest and activity he had displayed in the affairs of the State. They did not think, however, that the i3ani I3u Ali would give up their claims to Aiqa - (which is the cause of the problem, since as long as their interference continues effective Customs control is impossible), v/ithout at least a show of force, and if this force was not behind them, and the Bani Bu Ali H called their bluff”, the situation would be worse than before. 5. 1 did not of course give the Council my own opinion on their views, merely informing them that i would convey these to the political Resident, but personally 1 venture to think that they are right. Saiyid Said is by no means unenterprising witness the ’deposition* of his uncle from Sohar, and if he thought that he could successfully without approach the Bani Bu Ali wxix the promise of active assis tance from His Majesty’s Government, I am pretty sure he JLo would so. I i id s 6. 1 then told the Council that I could of course hold out no promise of actual support by Government at Sur, but that supposing at some time in the future Government were so disposed what support would they want, and what would be their plans? They replied that they v/ould like to hold a3 .• 1 * (^ vy conference at Sur with the Jenehah and the Bani Bu Ali on or about 1st August i*e» about a fortnight belore the first dhows were due to leave Sur, with a sloop anchored off Sur while the conference proceeded as a sign that they had Government behind them. They would then inform the jeneban and the Bani Bu Ali elements in Aiqa that no dhows would be allowed to leave until they had agreed to pay in future Customs dues in full, and any dhow doing so would be prevented by the sloop* * . They would also inform the Bani Bu Ali that the latter*s claim to Aiqa would be no longer allowed and tliat the flag-staff which still remains there, though it no longer flies a flag, should be removed, and if it was not removed, would be taken down forcibly. 7. They - the Council - did not anticipate any opposition from the Jeneban; on the contrary as the latter were now united, and on bad terms with the Bani Bu Ali, they looked for assistance from them, nofc did they anticipate mucn opposition from the Bani Bu Ali elements in Aiqa. . 8. The Council were of opinion that shaikh Ali and the Bani bu Ali faced with a firm attitude by the State and backed by the actual presence of a sloop ready for action would most probably gi»t no trouble. If, however, they refused to give U ^heir claim to Aiqa,, and brought down a contingent from Jaalan to attack Sur, or Balad as Sur, or both, the Janabah would fight them off as they did in 1928 when - though outnumbered - they drove ofi a contingent of the Bani Bu Ali who were attacking Balad. The Jenebah would ! also be helped by fire from the sloop. As the Jenebah would - according to Council - be in friendly, the possibility touched on/paragraph 15 of my letter bo. 31-C of 12th February, of retaliation on British subjects w T ould not appear to be great.4 4 #- ,\AV Comments * 10. The whole of the Sur problem was reviewed at some length in my letter quoted in the preceding paragraph. in paragraphs 13 and 14 of that letter i suggested a certain line of action, which is more or less that now proposed by the Council. In paragraphs 15 and 16 I pointed out that this action as far as the Jenebah and the ±sani ±su Ali elements in Aiqa were concerned was likely to be effective, but that the Bani Bu Ali of Jaalan would not be effected since they did not own dhows, though it might be possible to bring pressure to bear on them by holding up their export of dates (paragraph 17). I emphazised the fact that my suggestion as to the holding up of this export was tentative and further investigation has shown that it would probably be too involved to be practical. 11. The Council, however, see paragraphs 5 and 6 above, are of opinion - briefly - that sufficient pressure can be brought to bear locally at bur itself to bring the local elements under effective Customs control, and to eject Bani Bu Ali*s influence from the town, further - if the latter bring down a contingent to attack bur - the Council are of opinion that the local elements can, and will, fight them off. The question of the stoppage of export of Bani Bu Ali's dates can therefore be abandoned. 12. I therefore recommend for the approval of the jtion*ble the Political Kesident that assistance from his najesty’s Government be asked for as follows:- (a) Two sloops to be off Sur from about lst-15th August, with a possible extension to end of August, if two sloops could not be made available then one should be sufficient, cut on such occasions the greater the display of forcethe leee livelihood obviously there is of actual force having to be used. (b) Sloops to have authority to fire on dhows leaving Sur v/ithout permission. Doubtless, however, sloops could stop dhows without having to open fire. (cj Sloops to have authority to bombard forts held by elements hostile to the state, after the usual warning had been given, and to fire on tribesmen attacking forts or positions held by friendly elements. 13* As Acting Political hesident I would propose to be present myself on one of the sloops and so would be in a position to judge personally of the necessity of opening fire or not from a political point of view. The Acting Political Agent, JLuscat, would doubtless also be present. 14. 1 am aware that owing to unfavourable climatic conditions operations in the summer are naturally not regarded with favour by the iMaval authorities. In this instance, however, Khor Jerama - the ’sanitorium of the ttulf' - is only 12 miles away, and the sloops could lie up there, while the 'Al Saidi' patrolled outside Sur itself. Some method of signalling v/ould doubtless be arranged between the 'Al Saidi' and the sloops. 15. The necessity for action at sur is summarized in paragraph 10 of my letter already quoted, while some of the arguments with which 1 venture to think the request from Government might be supported are touched on in paragraph 19. Sur is at present enjoying a period of quiet, but it undoubtedly contains seeds of strife and disorder (vide for instance paragraph 3 of my letter already quoted;, and all its past history would seem to show (paragraphs 7 and 7 A of the same letter; that unless further action is taken it will relapse into its former disturbed and semi-rebellious state*1 ^ Confident!al« yw D.O.N0.253-S of 1931. British Residency! Bushire, the llth May 1931« Am fo ^ Please refer to your letter No#12/K of the 3rd May 1931, regarding Sur. Firstly, I must frankly tell you that there is not the smallest chance of the Government of India or His Majesty's Government agreeing to send sloops to Sur with authority to bombard. The days when such authority was lightly granted are, I am afraid, very definitely past and it is only possible to obtain permission of this kind in the event of a definite revolt or of danger to life and property or in support of the suppression of the slave trade. As you know it took us one month to get permis sion to take action at Khassab, and it was then only u iven after considerable discussions and because there had been a definite revolt against the authority of the Muscat State and the life of their tfali was in danger. At Ras-al-Khaimah I was authorised to seize dhows but al though the Shaikh's attitude was threatening and the Residency gent had been compelled to seek refuge on board a warship and a complete deadlock had arisen in the negotiations, the Government of India refused authority for a ship to knock down an outlying fort. 1 got authority to issue an ultimatum to dhargah about three months ago because interference had taken place with slaves attempting to J or T.C.W.Fowle,C.B.E., &gt;litical Agent,Muscat, at Karachi.I—Ato obtain their freedom, and in such oases of course His Majesty’s Government are always willing to authorise strong measures» but I can assure you that there is not the suialiest chance of their doing so at Sur under present conditions* &gt;Vhat grounds are there for asking sanction for such drastic measures? I went there in .August last and the Bani Bu All climbed down to a certain extant. Saiyid Said went there in September and, as you yourself say, paid a successful visit, a salute being fired in his honour and the Muscat flag hoisted. It cannot be said therefore that the Bani Bu All have adopted in any way a hostile attitude: on the contrary they have adopted a conciliatory attitude. We were both ourselves agreed that the next step is to try and get in touch with the Shaikh of the Bani Bu Ali but Saiyid Said’s only idea seems to be to meet him under the guns of two threatening warships. This does not seem to me to be the way to bring about a peaceful settle ment, and at any rate strong measures cannot be adopted until more peaceful measures have failed. I therefore suggest that the Muscat authorities should first of all invite the Shaikh of the Bani Bu Ali to come to Muscat and talk over things in a friendly way,or if he will not come himself to send a representative. As far as I am aware no effort has yet been made to get in touch with him on these lines. I think incidentally you might hint o Saiyid Said that his attitude is inconsistent. With one hand he is trying to cut down the levy Jorps and at the same time he is appealing to His majesty’s jovcrnaent to send ships to support the authority of the State. The lact that Alban was able to go to Sur in 1923 with 3 machine guns and 150 levies, compose blood feuds, recover 6400 dollars ••••MMr ~ ► -3- dollars oust orris dues rrom the Ban! Bu All and a fine of 4000 dollars from the Jennebeh shows what the State are capable of doing with their own forces, and provided they maintain an adequate levy force. Frankly, however, 1 have never quite understood what the difficulty was about maintain ing more stringent customs control at Sur. The large majority of the Sur dhows belong to the Jennebeh and only a ainr.ll number to the Bani Bu All. These dhows come into the Sur creek and once in there are under the control of the Muscat authorities. If the askaris about whom we have heard a good deal lately are incapable of dealing with the situation could they not be stiffened, if necessary, with a detachment from the levies? These dhows are hauled up on the beach for overhaul during the monsoon and there seems to be no particular difficulty in preventing them being put into the water if necessary, if they are suspected of not having paid customs dues, etc# In any case it seems to me that you have got the dhows before they are ever put out to sea and there is no necessity of waiting till they have been taken out of the creek before stopping them. if any dhows fraudulently land goods at Aiqa they are bound to come into the Sur creek sooner or later and could then be seized# Tou say tnere are 12 dhows belonging to the Bani Bu Ali; I was told that the number of large, dhows in their possession was less# However this may be, the smuggling into Aiqa in Aiqa dhows is probably not on a very large scale and I should have thought that it would be possible to devise some method oi getting hole, of these dhows too# It seems quite probaule that they are hauled up on the iiur side of the creek for overhaul. However, let uh in the first instance, at any rate, get away from thiswar mentality. Tell Saiyid Said to try a little diplomacy first and to try and effect some working arrangement with the Shaikh of the 3ani Bu All, The Muscat state should now he able to control the Jennebeh and ought to be able to arrive at some method by which the 3ani Bu Ali elements in Aiqa can be brought more or less under control. Anyhow we must give up the idea of sloops and bombardments 9 etc., except under the very gravest and most definite provocation and the sooner the Muscat state realise that and learn to lean a little more on their own Levy Corps the better.lb^ I' Political Agency &amp;.

Sir, I have the honour to report that Saiyid Said returned last night from his visit to sur on E.M.S. 'Penzance* &lt;, This morning he paid me the honour of a visit, and, ai tc.r expressing his gratitude for all the care and attention bestowed upon him by Commander Startin, informed me that nis visit to Sur had been an unqualified success. H.U.5. 'Penzance* arrived at Sur on the morning- of tne 9th, and, Saiyid Said after receiving the customary salute of 13 guns landed in the ship 4 s motor boat, a , reat receipt- ion was accorded him, the whole population of sur and Aiqa accompanied by their Sheikhs and headed by the Vfali, Saif bin Bedr, had assembled on the beach by the Customs house, salutes were fired and the Muscat flag was everywhere in evidence. Ax ter greetings f a. Mejlis was held outside the Customs no ise and some tnoal cancing toolc place. On the foliowing uay, all the Sheikhs assembled at the house of Hasir bin Abdulla, Sheikh of the Arama Section, where Saiyid Said was staying. After preliminary greetings etc. Saiyid Said announced that he had given orders to the Jail that he was at once— 2 — at ©nee to conaaence building the new Customs house on the Khor and that he did not intend to listen to any representa^ tions on that subject. Secondly, he said, boats coming to sur must in future brint; only one manifest marked for Sur and not several marked for various snail ports^thus evading Customs payments. Thirdly, the Customs Director nas to board all boats the moment they came into the Khor. Fourthly, all boats were immediately to be registered and y /ifthly all boats must be in possession of proper articles signed by himself. ho demur ««as raised to any of these provisions^ some pleas were addressed to Saiyid Shahab and the ’Jali to ask if they professed could not intercede^ to lighteivthe terms but they yrgyic-girri their inability to approach Saiyid Said wath any such request. On the third day Saiyid Said was invited to go to where he was received w_th a salute and entertained. A new Shaikh ox the Jenebah of Sur lias been a^pointied in place of Said bin Sultan, who was very unsatisfactery owing to his permanent absence. The new Sheikh is popular Wxth all sections a^djit is hoped, will unite tnem for good. to Three men accused of murder were publicly given up £X&amp; Saiyid Said and put in fcrons, a thing that lias never been done there before. On the fourth day, the foundation stone of the new Customs building on the Khor was publicly la^d by Saiyid Said, the Arama and Fowaris sections dug the foundations and are now carrying out the building operations. They had voluntarily requested to be allowed to do this work. Great keenness prevails at Sur and general pleasure is expressed by the people there at being made the special care of the Heir Apparent himself. The v/ali has been thoroughly admon ished to support all the civil departments in their work, \ especially the Customs. On1 4 — 3 — / tv On tiie 28tii of July Saiyid Said hopea to proceed again t0 Sur t0 s ^a“ine the progress of the building etc. Arrears of Zaicat and customs were paid up on the s^ot at Saiyid Saidas aetiana^no future trouble is lively at 3ur, » . , , successful i ' preclat i°n cf Saiyid Said's/efforts i^settling tij.s lorifeS tan dang and hnotty problem would not come amiss. I can vouch for the fact that he has spared no pains to achieve success and whatever commendations he may receive will be truly earned. In conclusion I would like to add that Saiyid Said nas acquired an ascendancy on the whole State which has not been approached for a hundred years. He has taren over the lull control of the administration including the duties formerly carried out by the Adviser which were ta^en over by him about a month a^oo He has shown the greatest capacity in all his dealings and it would be most unjust to deprive him now *f tne supervision of the financial affairs of the State.

Item (4) leaves Sheikh Ali in an attitude of passive resistance, his reply, when pressed, was that he could not be responsible for his followers, if made to pay Customs, and that he would have to run away. In^conversation with Saiyid Said yesterday he agreed that a great step forward has been accomplished, the effective Muscat frontier has advanced right Up to the outskirts of Aiqa, as it were, and already itsinfiuence is beginning to be felt by the Bani-bu-Ali« He proposes another visit to Uftryi Sur shortly, to consolidate the ground already .^w^open the new Customs, if ready and press Sheikh Ali further still, it is only a question of time now until full Customs control is gained. He is not at ail pessimistic, although parts of his letter seem to suggest it, of course he would like Sloops and permission to bombard, as an easy way out, but he agrees that a steady^regular pressure on Sheikh All until he gives way^as he is bound to do soon, will be the best method # Strong States always tend to attract weak neighbours. 5. The tfali, Said Saif bin Sedr, has a reputation for firmness, he was a great success at Gwadur, and he will not, Saiyid Said says, relinquish any ground already gained.3 Colonel Bisooe,in hie d.o., ^ointa out oie^rly tnat toe Bani-bu-Ali and taeir follower, hare not rebelled or eOBiaitted any real a^reaeion, if they ever did ,unwieely, decide to oocuait any auch a^reeaion they hnow well that they would oe liable to retribution by the British Sovernmnt, in any caee on them must always lie^ree^onsibiiity for mating any such move* QtfJru* Captain, Political A^ent &amp; H.B.M* s Consul.Translation ol a letter dated 24th Rabi al Thani 1350 (8th September 1931) from Saiyid Said bin Taimur, President of the Council of Minister*, Muscat State, to Captain R.G.

After Compliments. 7/ith regard to my visit to Sur , I take the opportunity of writing to inform you of the state of affairs which I found and the reforms I introduced there. As you are aware I visited Sur twice in H.M.S. Ships tnis I could do only through your help and I thank you. The kind assistance ol our friend the Government towards the State ol the Sultan of Muscat and Oman has always been shown in the past and we are thankful to them. My first journe y from Muscat was in the beginning of July last and the second at the end of the same month. 0n iirst visit to Sur I found every thing in order and the subjects loyal to the Government of the State of Muscat and Oman. During my stay I established a Custom house at 'Hillat *1 Q&amp;rmitain' at the Eastern side, near the jKHor (creek) into which boats enter. 1 also notified the people regarding registration of their boats and other reforms, the introduct ion oi which would strengthen the finances of the State and enforce its authority. To all this I encountered no opposition whatever from the subjects and alter accomplishing ell the aboye 1 returned to Muscat and 1 thank God for the success. % i el ore leaving Sur I promised the people that I would return to them after some days in order to see what progress has been made and to introduce further reforms. After my return to Muscat Irom dur X received a letter 1 rom the bani bu Ali Shaikh - Ali bin Abdullah Al Hamudah - requesting my visit in connection with some matters which &amp;re rj0t hidden from Jha Government (please refer to(i/V correspondence from Mie Highness the Sultan and the Council of His Ministers on the subject of the opposition of the said Shaikh who is one of the Sultan’s subjects and who claims things which neither his grand fathers nor he himself had enjoyed before, etc.)* I sent him a reply to the effect that I proposed to visit our in a short while and that i wished him to come to Sur then. I left Muscat the second time (as already mentioned) and on my arrival at Sur this time I found the new Custom House progressing as desired and all in order. 1 ordered their boats to be numbered and this was accordingly done. I also appointed a new Shaikh over th e Janabeh tribes. Two days after my arrival, the Shaikh of aani jbu Ali, Ali bin Abdullah, arrived at Sur and called on me. He discussed with me all matters which he had already discussed with the Sultan and the non’ble the Political Kesident. As you are aware the village of Aiqa which is a part of Sur and in which are living some of Hani Hu Ali is not taxed with any sort of Customs Fees by the Muscat State at present - unlike the j^st - since four years ago, and this is of course for reasons which previous correspondence will explain to you. if you refer to H.H. tne Sultan’s letter dated 25th Rajab 1348 (27th December 1929) you will come to know about the transgressions of the Shaikh of Hani ±5u Ali. 'With regard to tne flagstaff which was formerly installed by them, it has been removed and this was really done after the Kesident had notified the Shaikh of the Hani J3u Ali to remove it. V/hat remains for the Sultan’s Government to do now is to le vy ta xes on Aiqa and introduce other reforms. The Shaikh of the Bani Bu Ali in the course of his conversation with me claimed an allowance of # 500 per mensem, that a Custom n.ouse be established at Aiqa and that3 ; lib taxes should be levied on people other than the inhabitants of the said village• He also claimed some other things from the 3ultan5Government which he had no right to do as he had never been allowed previously. His claims, however, 1 did not approve and as 1 did not agree with him he achieved no result from his visit and his conversation on these subjects. I however did not levy any Customs tax on Aiqa pending communication with and explanation to you regarding this Shaikh and his illegal action. Communications have already been made in this connection, but I now draw the attention of the Hon’ble the Resident and our friend the Government to the fact of this important matter, v/hich if so left, and if the government pay no attention to helping the State, we should then expect as its outcome nothing but rebel(ion and encouragement of other subjects of the Sultan's Government. I further edd for your information that Shaikh Ali bin Abdullah wanted to interfere in the matter of the new Custom House and also in other affairs but he was given no chance so he withdrew at once. I now request your views and your consultation with the Hon’ble the Resident in this important matter. As you are aware the Government of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman is doing all possible nowadays in order to strengthen its financial position, similarly its authority and we have genuine hope in the Hon'ble the Government. As stated above the work in the new Custom uouse which has recently been established is being carried out and the state of Sur is satisfactory except the claims of Bani Bu Ali about which you are aware. In conclusion while renewing our friendly relations I also offer my thanks to the Hon'ble the Government.r &amp; Muscat 22nd Septeaber 1931 Der.r Captain Alban, Reference our conversation of yesterday. The following were my proposals for ensuring a more effective Customs control at Sur*- d &amp; 1. Si-taiicra fort should oe taicen over by the CustottJan guard should be placed there. / 2. A strong Customs and Military guard should be placed at Khoor-Jiraa. 3. Al Saidi is also to be placed at Khoor Jiraa to patrol the coast between Sur and Klioor Jiraia. 4. Boats are to be inspected thoroughly well and goods that are not mentioned in the manifest should be confiscated and thb Captain Ox the boat should be imprisoned and fined. 5. A Customs house should be built at the entrance of Sur Xhoor were the customs hut is situated at present. 6. Cargo should oe landed at Batih (where the new Customs house is to be built). 7. A Customs t,uard should be placed at Aija. 8. All goods shipped to foreigh porta from Sur should be covered oy manifest. During tne last two visits of Saiyid Said, in whose company I was, the folxowing proposals xiave seen carried out oy his ordera;- (1) A Customs guard has been placed at SihaiJcra. (2) A suitable place has been selected £or building a fort at Khoor Jiraia as soon as the Customs house is built. (3j Al Saidi will be placed at Khoor Jirairi when the con struction of fort will commence. (4) Boats are being inspected by the local Director of Stjr as soon as they anchor in the harbou®. (o) Customs house is being built at the entrance of Sur KhOxOr. (6) Cargo will be landed at Batih as soon as the new Customs house is completed. (7) This proposal is pending settlement with Bani-bu-Ali. (8) 1'his will oe carried out as soon as tne New Customs house is completed.

With reference to my letter dated the 24th Rabi el Thani 1330 (8th September 1931) end our conversation of two days c^o regarding Sur affairs, T now take the opportunity of writing this letter to you. I have already st?ted in my letter quoted above, thet during my visit to sur I introduced the necessary reforms, such as revising the revenue administration, strengthening Government authority, etc. The only question left unsettled, is thf t of Aiqf&lt;, which, together with the preposterous cli-in of the Shaikh of the Beni Bu Ali T have already fully explained. As therefore you are in full possession of ill the facts I do not propose to touch on them again. In my above letter I asked for your opinion in consultation with the Hon’ble the Resident on this point. T have now reconsidered the matter and arrived at the following conclusion:- (1) I see that I should ^o to 3ur by our boat the 'Al Saidi’’, accompanied by 50 men of our levy, from Bait al Fal £ j , as guards.

In July last Saiyid Said visited Sur twice in warship accompanied by Political Agent with wholly satisfactory results. Differences between sections of Jenebeh tribe were composed and new sheikh appointed. A new customs house commanding creek was built, regis tration of dhows enforced and authority of State effect- -ively established. As result there was an increase in August in customs receipts of nearly Es 6000/- .

Five days ago Saiyid Said accompanied by Political Agent left again in sloop for Sur to try and settle question of Aiqa. Before leaving he asked whether sloop could be authorised in last resort actively to support him should Beni Bu Ali prove truculent, but was informed that in no circum- -stances could active support be given. Political Agent now reports that Beni Bu Ali refused to come and interview i^aiyid Said and defied Mali who went in person to summon them, and considers this calls for prompt punishment.

Sir, I hare the honour to invite a reference to my &gt; telegram Ho,550 of the 29th October 1931 reporting an incident that had recently occurred at Sur. 2. There has not been time for me to receive a detailed report of the incident from Muscat, but I should like to place before the Government of India and His Majesty’s Government ay general views of the present position there and the measures which I propose to take to deal with it. 3 # Ae reported by me in my telegram, during the last 3 or 4 months the Muscat State, in the person of Saiyid Said, have taken vigorous measures to re-establish their authority at S^r and the results have been highly satisfactory. Sffactive customs control has been established over the town cf Sur itself, and the authority of the State extended over the four sections of the Jennebeh who inhabit it. As a result the customs revenue has gone up very materially, and a new customs house has been built there commanding the creek.2 - For these results S&amp;lyld Said I think deserves much credit. On each occasion he travelled in one of His Majesty^ ships, kindly placed at his disposal by the Senior Naval Officer, which certainly facilitated his task and enhanced his prestige, and credit is also due to Captain ilban, under whose guidance he acted* 4* On the furth r side of the creek, however, at Sur, is the small village of Aiqa, inhabited by the Bani Bu Ali, whose Shaikh, Ali bin Abdullah, resides in the interior at Jaalan* This tribe has for some years past adopted a most rebellious attitude towards the Muscat State and even went so far as to fly their own flag at Aiqa* This was finally atopped on my visit to Sur in August 1950 when X personally ordered the Shaikh to haul down his flag* 5* Since then the attitude of the Bani Bu Ali has greatly improved, they flew the Muscat flag on one or two occasions when Saiyid Said visited the place, and seemed generally disposed to adopt a less contumacious attitude* Customs control, however, was not definitely established, and the matter was complicated by the fact that as a reward for previous services rendered to the State the Shaikh of the Bani Bu Ali was entitled to import goods for his personal use free of duty - a somewhat elastic term which is capable of various interpretations* 6* After Saiyid Said's first visit to Sur, Shaikh Ali, possibly having seen how the sway of the State &amp;s been effectively extended over the Jennebeh, appears to have considered it desirable to come to terms with the Muscat State, and he therefore wrote to Saiyid Said saying that he desired to discuss various matters with him* Saiyid Said therefore proceeded to Aiqa again and a meeting took place at which • • •jrir' -3- nhich the Shaikh of the Ban! Bu All claimed on allowance of 500 dollars a month, and agreed that a customs house shou Id be established at Alqa, but contended that no taxes should be levied on the inhabitants of the Tillage itself, and he added that he could not be responsible for his followers if they were made to pay customs. Saiyid Said not unnaturally rejected these terms but postponed definite action in this connection to a later date. 7. At the end of September the Council of Ministers addressed a letter to the Political Agent expressing the view ttet it was necessary to establish customs control over Aiqa and that Saiyid Said wished to proceed there with this object in view, and intended to take with him 50 men of the levies and proceed in the 'Al Said'. They further stated that Saiyid Said proposed, after having arrived at Aiqa and established a customs post there, to inform Shaikh Ali that while customs duty would in future be levied at Aiqa, certain articles for his own personal use would, as previously, be free. The Council of Ministers asked that one of His Majesty* s ships should be present at Sur while the above arrangements were being carried out, both as a threat to the Bani Bu Ali and as a support in case of emergency. Subsequently, as H.M.S. 'Penzance' was visiting Sur on the 23rd October, Saiyid Said asked if he could be given a passage in her and was informed in reply that there was no objection. He had already been previously informed that under no circumstances could a sloop give any active assistance, and Saiyid Said was therefore well aware that he could only count on the moral support which a passage in His Majesty’s ship gave him. 8. While I have not yet received details of what exactly took place at Sur, it seems dear that the Bani BuAll adopted a defiant attitude* They refused to interview Salyid Said and Captain Alban t who was also there 9 and defied the Wall who went In personally to induce the leading men to come in* The Political Agent asked that drastic measures should be taken by His Majesty’s ships as punishment for this action, and recommended that dhows returning from Basrah should be searched for and seized* I did not support this proposal for the following reasons* firstly, 1 felt that ewery effort had not been made to effect a settlement by means of peaceful and friendly discussions; secondly, I felt that His Majesty's Government and the Government of India would probably contemplate with the greatest reluctance any hostile action by His Majesty's ships except in the last resort when definite aggression had been committed, or to protect life and property* I therefore telegraphed to the Political Agent, suggesting that the Council should try and intercept the Aiqa dhows with their own State launch and a few levies* Thess dhows would presumably pass close outside Muscat and the Muscat authorities are of course entirely within their rights in taking action of this nature against their subjects* Up to the present however I have not received intimation whether any dhows have been seized, and the measure therefore has presume ably been unsuccessful* 9* If so I do not think that masters can bs allowed to rest whsre they are now* There are many issues at stakes firstly, if no control is effected over the Bani Bu All residing at Aiq&amp; it will obviously have a very bad effect on the Jennebeh at Sur and in a short time the good work that Saiyld Said has accomplished will to a large extent be undone* The prestige of the State would eufier and the political effect would be bad* 10* Secondly, the financial condition of the State, as the Government of India are aware, still occasions a good deal of anxlety , * * &lt;-3- anxi«ty # and it is essential that every penny of revenue to which the State is legitimately entitled should be collected. The revenue of Aiqa itself is probably not very large, but it is the port of a considerable area in the interior, and every penny is of value now to the State. Failure to establish customs control at Aiqa would result in a loosening of the customs control at Sur, the effect of which would be serious. ^ Further, it has been the policy of His Majesty^ Government to support the authority of the Muscat State on the coast, though not inland, and it seems to me that it is a very wise policy. A sufficiently effective control can be maintained over the tribes in the hinterland from the coast, as was shown * W th. or u» ^oh •rroetlToljr j their rising in 1920 said His Majesty’s Government also supported the authority of the State at Khassab in 1930 by active intervention. On the maintenance of its authority on the coast depends the stability, political and financial, of the State, and if once tribesmen in the interior can flout the authority of the State in these ports the situation will be a serious one. Further^ efforts are now being made to establish an air route from Muscat to Aden, and it is essential that law and order should be maintained along the coast. 12. For the above reasons I consider it essential that the ^ authority of the Muscat State should be established at Aiqa, and if the Government of India see no objection I propose to proceed to Sur with Saiyid Said during my forthcoming tour, and to send for Shaikh All and see if it is possible to effect a settlement. If the Bani Bu Ali still remain entirely iniransigeant then I think there ia nothing for it but for the Muscat State to take forex measures against them, and in suoh circumstances thsy can I think legitimately ask for the support of His Majesty^ Government, having regard to their own very limited resources. The ••••The avenue a of peace will all have been explored and the Shaikh will have been offered very liberal terme for the import of hie own goods 9 and if he refuses to accept hie action can only be considered apr deliberate rebellion against the authority of his suzerain 9 and trust that in these circumstances His tfajesty's Government will be pleased to authorise one of His Majesty's ships to support such measures as the State may take against them* I will however do my best to render any such action on their part unnecessary* I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty's Secretary of State for India* 'p.L-NtT' I have the honour to be 9 * Sir 9 Tour most obedient servant 9 cl. £n- 3/.

This was the President’s tnird visit to bur and as t^e completion of ^ur control was now bein^ held up by the residents of A iqa not bein^ subjected to payment of Customs aues I advised baiyid bald to send for these people ux.d thresh the matter out with them. o* On the evening 01 mie 26tn October therefore, the Beni ou Ali 01 Aiqa presented themselves before baiyid baid, and, as I was afterwards informed by him, were very reason able, tney said that they had no objection to payin^ Customs or to registering their boats and that they liad not pre viously been asked to do these thing's. At the conclusion2 tl tne Lieetin^ tx.ey promised to return next iuorniny and re an eminently ^ro^er and ri^nt frame of mind on tne yart of the Beni bu All. On tiie next morning, October 27th, daiyid n&lt;,id asked ne L-o dc ^resent at the reauiujjtion ox’ the meeting* S. Accerdinyly, I accompanied Saiyid Said to the meeting room,into which, after a few rlnutes, was ushered the dirtiest collection of scallywags I have ever seen. Only one man was decently dressed, and, after the assembly had shaken hands and sat down, Bai/id Said addressed him saying were tne representatives of Aiqa who had been present the Tne man who was one of the influential people of A iqa replied xn a insolent manner, that they .-vere ail in Aiqa and did them to leave Hie room and to sena for the others at once. -i-l. ..iter waiting more than an hour and a half without result, i suggested that the kali as re ti v#* T ^ I 1 A \T k-i vn*.- k?\ look at tiie new Customs building on the Khor.

If they obey his orders then they incur the displeasure of the otate. 17. In order to maxe this point clear I advised b&amp;iyid haid to put hieiu to the test and, they have decided that the dis pleasure of tneir Sheimh, many miles ft away, is more to be feared than that of the btate. 15.

I must say that these subjects of Aiqa should be punished for their insolence. In my i-reviuos letters I requested assistance from H.l.I^s Government, but I have so far not been favoured with © reply. I am sure that you are now convinced that these subjects will never obey our Governments orders if no force is used and if they are not punished the situation will be worse and rather encourage other subjects to rebel. The people of Sur are all now awaiting the result of this incident.

Foreaber 1931, reporting an incident that has recently occurred at Sur, I have the honour to forward herewith for the information of the Government of India and His Majesty 1 s Government a copy of letter Fo.C.256 of 31st October received from Captain Alban Just before he relinquished charge of the post of Political Agent, Muscat, regarding the conduct of the inhabitants of Aiq&amp;« 2. Captain Alban has explained to me that reports reached Muscat to the effect that the Jennebeh were instigating the Bani Bu Ali at Aiqa to refuse to pay customs duty. The Jennebeh themselves had been compelled to submit, but naturally would have preferred to revert to their former independence. If the Bani Bu Ali eucceeded in defying the Muscat State then the Jennebeh would follow suit. If on the other hand the Bani 3u Ali were compelled to submit or were punished for their contumacy the Jennebeh would be no worse off than they are at Sir In continuation of *y despatch Ho.743-S of 6th present. • e(6 3 - 2 - \ present. It was therefore considered desirable, in order to avoid the risk of any further trouble with the Jennebeh and to strengthen the position of the State at Sur, to Interview the people of Alqa and to try and effect a settlement with them. *• It will be seen that at first they assumed a conciliatory attitude, but the following day appeared to have changed their mind. As Captain Alban points out, ths inhabitant oi ..iqa are not, I think, particularly a warlike or militant people, are between the devil and the deep sea. On the one hand they are agraid of their own Shaikh, and on the other are loth themselves to resist the Unseat State. f 4. The rest of the despatch does not, I think, call for further explanation or comments, but there is one point in the letter from the President of the Council of the 30th October to the Political Agent, regarding which I have questioned Captain Alban. The President of the Council writes in the third paragraph - In «y previous letters I requested assistance t*m Hi. ajesty' a Government, but I have not so far been favoured with a reply*. Maj or owle, when acting as Political Resident, informed the Political Agent that under no circumstances could a •loop give more than moral support, and Captai. Alban tells me that ne took this telegram over to Saiyid Said, and read it to him. saiyid Said's statement therefore is not strictly accurate. The matter is not of much practical importance, but I thought it better to clear it up in case it might be thought that Saiyid aid ha d been l 6ft ln d0llbt „ to whether at that Hie Uaj esty' s Government were prepared to authori.e a .loop to support hi* or not.

There is nothing to report except the aggression of Saiyid Said in seizing our dhow and its men and imprisoning Abdullah bin Muhammad without any cause; it is only highhandedness on his part. We have given him no cause for his action. Our messenger Saif bin Salih is cominyto you. You may approach Said and disuade him from doing such mean deeds. He should release the dhow and its men. If he has evil intentions against us he should come forward and fight as others do. Hut capturing dhows is not Goverhors* action. Please let us know his views briefly after you have referred to him.

We beg to state that there is nothing to report except the transgression committed by the President of the Council of Ministers, Said bin Taimur, in seizing our dhow and imprisoning the Kakhuda without any cause as we have committed no crime or transgressed any law. This is merely oppression and highhandedness on his part. As we know thatmm you dislike such mean deeds we bring this to your notice so that you may be a witness thereof. He is the aggressor. If it is possible to approach him please do so and give him good advice. If he intends fighting us then the responsibility lies on the aggressor. Please send me a reply by the bearer.

To The Hon’ble the Political Hesicient in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. SUBJECT:- 3ur and the Bani Bu Ali« Memorandum. * I enclose herewith a copy of letters Saiyid Said and I have received from Sheikh * dated 4-12-1931 to P.A.Muscat 3 dated to Saiyid Said. ( Ali bin Abdullah. The one to me merely states that he -aill await your and Saiyid Said's arrival on the date fixed. The one to Saiyid Said is couched in quiter terms - as you will see - tnan his previous communication. 2. As I stated in my telegram ho.275 of 26th November I think the Sheikh will probably climb down at his interview with you, but we cannot count on that, and should in my opinion be ready to bacx up the State's demands if he refuses them: in other words be prepared to use force. The Bani Bu Ali problem has now become a case of the first importance, as far as the State is concerned, both from the Political and Financial aspects* If the Bani Bu All are able to defy the State and prevent it collecting Customs dues at Aiqa then Jenebeh will also not unnaturally follow the example. If the Jenebeh refuse to pay revenue then the Batmah tribes - the Yal Saad etc - will do likewise. Further, as you pointed out to Government 'p * ■ &amp; in your telegram No.T.77 of 30th November, the case is being watched from the interior, and the result will undoubtedly have repercussions there also. It is not therefore a question of getting some more thousands of dollars out of Sur - though that is by no means a negligible factor in itself, it is aquestion of the political and financial future of the State. As you will see from my report on the financial condition of the .State, my letter No.£»a«3of /c^ecember ls»31, its future prospects, if reasonable conditions prevail, are fair, and provided that the Bani Bu Ali problem is solved successfully I thinJc we may say that it - the State - is convalescent. If the problem is not solved successfully then the State will undoubtedly suffer a relapse, and we shall have a 'sick man 1 * on our hands for many years to come* o. The most important factor in the problem is of course neither the State nor the Bani Bu Ali but His Majesty's Govern- ment, as it is only they who can give us the '‘Doctor’s mandate* to deal with the situation. They will I imagine be more ready to give this if the Bani Bu Ail commit some act of definite aggression. It will presumably be our object therefore to get Sheijch All into a position in which he’will either have to accept the Gate's terms, or commit an act of aggression against it. Any sort of indefinite 'draw', even in the State's favour, would not I think meet the case. i •«ifh regard to terms. Without in any way committing you I have discussed this point with Saiyid Said. He only wants three things from the Sheikh:- (a) That Customs dues should be paid in Aiqa. (b) That for this purpose a Customs post should be established there. (c) That Aiqa (i.e* Bani Bu All) dhows should be registered. These are all perfectly reasonable and simple requests. 5. on the other hand Saiyid Said is quite prepared to allow the Sheikh the special privileges,and some^thing over, which he has enjoyed in tne past. Tne Sheikh has the concession, for instance, of importing 100 bags of rice per annum free of dues: the value of this is about # 80 per annum. In order to enforce the principle of collecting Customs dues at Aiqa the simplest plan would perhaps be for the State to compound with the Sheikh for the value of his concession in cash, and Saiyid Said is3 prepared to give him more than the ^ 30 - which thie represents. The exact sum should he sufficiently generous to tempt the Sheixh to accept, and to ^ave his face 1 , and at the same time not so large as to appear in the nature of blacicmail, cr to lead other She rich a to put in similar claims. Saiyid Said will ue the best judge of the actual amount.( As you are aware the Sheixh previously demanded 500 ^er mensem). 6. With regard to the intercepted dhow. I suggest that this oe given bacx provided the above terms are accepted, and it seems lixely that they will be carried out. 7. When you see the Sheiich at Sur either he will accept the aoove terms,(if you approve that they should be put to him), or he will refuse them, if he taxes the former line then either he will abide loyally by the terms, or v/hen our bacxs are turned he will later repudiate the agreement and shoot up the Aiqa Customs post, or threaten to do so if it is not evacuated, or some thing of that sort. This will be a definite act of aggression. S* If he flatly refused the terms then the only course for us to pursue would seem to be to carry them out by force, and have the Aiqa Customs post - the s^gn of the State’s authority - established under the guns of a sloop, following on this three eventualities are possible:* (a) The establishment of the Customs lost will be resisted in v/hich case the sloop will have to use her guns. (b) Or it will be accepted and this display of our determina tion to see things through will be sufficient to cow the Sheiich for good and all. (c) Or it will be accepted and when the sloop has sailed away - she cannot stay there for ever - the Sheiich will take action as described at the end of para 7 above. J. With regard to the amount of force to be used, if force adiould prove necessary. I have referred above to M a H sloop. It tfould be preferable, however, if more than one were employed. The Arabs themselves have a proverb that * the Arab’s understanding?4 fryip xs xi, ills eyes’, i.e. that he only realises what he see*, and the greater the show of force which Sheijch Ali and his tribesmen actually see trie less lively is it tnat tnis force will actually nave to oe used. In the Yal Saad ’snow* of 19^2 (vide letter produced m a shorter period. ^• pressure can ce brought to bear on the inhabitants of Aiqa by stopping ingress or egress of their dhows. The most convenient seasons for doing this are indicated in para 6 of my letter bo. o3~C of 8th July 1930. This action of course does not directly affect the Bani Bu Ali of the interior, though the Sheixh could not ignore it as the people of Aiqa belong to his tribe, and in the present instance of the intercepted Aiqa dhow he has made protests to the State. The Bani Bu Ali of Jaalan have two or three smaller ports of their ov/n south of Ras al Hadf Lashicarah etc,whence - so the Customs Director General informs me - two or three large Bani Bu Ali dhows ply to India etc. where these dhows aestivate is uncertain: presumably Sur or Khor wara^^cJi. The interception of these craft would bring some direct pressure on the Bani Bu Ali* 11* In my telegram quoted above I suggested the possible use of air-craft. If the Bani Bu All prove obstinate ^then the best way of dealing with them, in addition to naval action , will be by tombing the Sheiicb^s headquarters which are situated about 4J miles inland in Jaalan. Such action may not be necessary, but should it prove so then preliminary sanction from His Majesty’s Government would be very useful. Otherwise if naval action is insufficient, operations would have to be suspended while permission to use air-craft was obtained, and this suspension would of course encourage the Bani Bu Ali.

You state that Your Honour and the Hon'ble the Resident are visiting Sur on the 3rd Shaban (13-12-31), I expect you on that date as promised, and shall meet you on your arrival.if • • • To Shaikh Ali Bin Abdullah, Sur. After compliments, I am writing to confirm what I told you verbally today, namely that the British Government can no longer tolerate the defiance of the authority of the Muscat State on the coast. The State have the right to collect customs duty at Aiqa and to require the people of Aiqa to register their dhows, and the British Government are ready to support the State in their just demands. You have the right to exemption of customs duty on goods imported for yourself, up to a certain amount, and this the Muscat State are ready to give you. We discussed the matter for a long time today,and finally the State made you the following offer. (i) that they should not build a customs house in Aiqa, but should rent a house from you. (ii) that of the four customs guards at Aiqa, two should be Beni Bu Ali. (iii) the State would in future pay you a month instead of the 100 that they pay you at present. In return you would admit the right of the State to collect customs dues and register dhows at Aiqa. I am writing this so that there may be no misunderstanding. And I again advise you, 0 Shaikh, to agree to this liberal settlement. Any other course will only bring trouble to you and to your people, whileif you admit the just rights of the Muscat State on the coast, you will not be interfered with in the control of your tribe in the interior^ I intend to leave tonight and hope you will let me have an answer by three hours before midnight, and should you wish to discuss the matter further and reply to me to that effect I am ready to have another conversation if you will come on board this ship tomorrow morning. If you do not send a this reply to/the State will await a reply from you at Muscat within one week 0 Usual Ending. sd/- H.V.Biscoe, Lt.Colonel, Political Resident in the Persian Sulf.2 Telegram: From: Political Resident, Muscat* To Government of India, Foreign and Political Department. Repeated: Secretary of State for India,London. No. T.100. Dated the 15th December 1931. Reference Secretary of State’s telegram No. 3585 of 10th December. SUR. I had a long interview with Shaikh Ali, in presence of Saiyid Said and Political Agent. He was informed of State's demands for levy of customs dues and registration of dhows, with personal exemption for himself, and that demands had support of His Majesty's Government. He maintained that AIQ,A belonged to Bani Bu Ali» who were independent of Muscat State and that latter had no right to collect customs dues, although customs accounts were produced showing that they had paid up to 6 years ago. Finally he was told that if he would agree to terms \ State would (i) rent house in AIQA for customs post instead of building new post (ii) would employ 2 of Bani Bu Ali as customs guards and (iii) would double his present subsidy of 100 dollars per mensem as compensation for loss of revenue he had been getting from AIQJU He refused to agree. I then conveyed terms to him in writing and added that if he desired further discussion he should let me know by 9 p.m. failing which I would leave. He was asked in any case to send written reply to Muscat within a week. I attribute his attitude which was, contrary to expectations of Saiyid Said^i Fowle and myself, largely to influence of local priest who at my previous meeting was conciliatory and helpful but on this occasion very hostile and defiant*2. I think we must now grasp the nettle * S&amp;iyid Said however i s averse from taking action during month of Ramzan as he considers it would he unfavourably regarded by public opinion and I aferee. Ramzan commences 9th January, and it would be difficult to take action earlier without in convenience, and there is no immediate hurry. I recommend therefore that if Ali f s reply is unfavourable State should in form him that while no action will be taken against him during Ramzan, following month steps will be taken to enforce compliance with their demands. This will give him further time for reflection. 3.

Reference my telegram T/lOO,dAted the 15th December 1931. SUR. I hare now discussed matter with Air Officer Command ing and Senior Naval Officer. I recommend that about middle of February Saiyid Said and Political Agent should proceed in warship to AlQA* (i) If Shaikh Ali has left AIQA Muscat State should place customs post in AIQA and Saiyid Said should write letter to Shaikh informing him that he has done so and that any act of aggression against AIQA will be punished. Political Agent should also send letter saying that demands of State had support of His Majesty’s Government who would enforce compliance. Once post had been established warship could leave. If subsequent ly Shaikh Ali molested post at AIQA he would have committed deliberate act of rebellion and aggression against Muscat State after having- 2 - been definitely warned that such action would meet with punishment and then after due notice punitive demolition of Aiq^ fort would be carried out by war ship and simultaneously after usual proclamation JAAIAM fort would be bombed by aircraft. (ii) If on other hand Shaikh Ali was still at AIQ^A with large body of armed followers Saiyid S&amp;id should notify him of his intention to establish customs post there and call on him to evacuate AIQA within 24 hours or to accept terms previously offered. Political Agent would also send letter saying that demands had approval of His Majesty’s Government and that unless they were complied with within 24 hours punitive demolition of Aiq* fort would be carried out. As soon as Shaikh had left or been driven out of AI^A further letter of warning would be addressed and if he committed act of aggression action outlined under (i) would be taken. All that State desires to do is to establish effective control at AIC*. which ie key to Sur, *nd to deter Shaikh Ali from molesting post. I consider that action on above lines would in all probability effect this, especially in view of fact that potentialities of aircraft are unknown to people of this area and moral effect would be enormous. It is desirable to avoid demanding from Shaikh Ali undertakings,e.g. written acceptance of State’s demanils, which might be fliffi cu lt to obtain or could only be obtained by repeated bombings. Our object will be achieved if we can deter him from interference at AI^A. t &lt;? Sd .
