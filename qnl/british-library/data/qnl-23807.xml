Sir, I am sending to-day by Airmail a parcel containing fruits of of the Avicennia alba as requested by the Secretary of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research. I wanted to write in advance and inform you about it but due to the postal strike in India it has not been possible to do so. As the fruits of Rhizophora are not yet mature I will send a second parcel containing them later on. Regarding the manner of planting, I would suggest the following way:- Detach the fruits from the stems and then place about a dozen in glass dishes or in pots containing marshy soil which is kept moist constantly. Or surround an area about 1,000 sq. ft. on the beach or on the place where the seedlings are to be grown and protect it by a net or any other means from disturbance. The area chosen must be away from the influence of tide otherwise the seedlings will be washed away. In the area put the fruits on the moist soil after detaching them from the stems and observe every day their growth. \fh.en the seedlings have sprouted up and rooted, which would be at about the stage of ten to twelve days after ger mination, transfere them to the spot where you want to plant them for stoping Soil Erosion, taking care that the roots are not broken in this operation. I shall be glad if you would kindly let me know whether the experiment has succeeded or not. Yours sincerely, c\^&gt;- cNo. 244? - 16/32 POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN. The 29th July 1946 To Messrs.
