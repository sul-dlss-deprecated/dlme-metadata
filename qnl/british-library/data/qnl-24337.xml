Weightman to call on H e r Highness and the wives of Shaikhs Mihammad and Abdallah. Her Highness would be pleased to receive Mrs. Weightmn* at Maharraq on the first day of ^d at 10 A.M. On the second day of id Mrs. /eightman. ./ill call on the wife of Shaikh khhammad at I-uharraq at 10 A.M. and then on the wife of Shaikh Abdullah. Arrangements for cars for both days have oeen made by the °haikhs at %harraq. 105 106 107 108 / Ht t t Issued letter No.434 dated 2/12/37 to Shaikh Muhammau hin ’Isa A1 Khalifah.

The girl, a Jewess, who has to act as Interpreter on Id, is living at ^anaoiah and will come to the Agency 9.45 A.M. in order to accompany Mrs. Weightman to Maharraq. 2. Farrash ^ashi has been told to arrange for a car for Mrs. .Veightman and to go with her to Miharraq. 3. I understand that there is no likelihood of Shaikh Abdallah returning to Bahrain for Id. 4. David, launch driver, has been informed to keep the launch ready on the first and second day of Id.P.A. &gt; f On the 1st instant when I received your orders to arrange for Mrs. Weightman*s call on H e r Highness and the wives of Shaikhs liuhamad and Abdullah I asked Abdullah bin Jabur, His Highness* Secretary, on phone to fix a place where I could see him. His himself came to the Agency and in the presence of ^r. Hasim 1 explained to aim. In order to avoid confusion I wrote him a letter giving the time of call and asking him to make the necessary arrangements. On the 2nd instant His Highness's Secretary telephoned to me saying that he has arranged with Xl er highness for Mrs.Weightman's call and that he would make arrangements with the other ^haikhas. On the 3rd instant I saw His Highness's Secretary in the bazaar and in the presence of Mr* Hasim assured me that he has done all the necessary arrangements for Mrs. height--an' s call on the 1st and 2nd days of Id. On Abdullah bin dabur 1 s assurance that all arrangements were made, I sent a note to you in the morning of the 3rd inst. informing you that every thing 'was alright. In the afternoon of the 3rd instant when I again saw His Highness' Secretary about the Interpreter I asked him whether all arrangements were made and he answered in the affirmative. Today I saw H.H's Secretary .and joskxs told him what had happened. xl e said that on the 2nd inst. he sent his clerk first to the house of Shaikh Muhamad to make the necessary arrangements for Mrs.Weightman's call. His clerk informed him that the arrangements were made, but in order to be certain abouo it ne went oo see shaikh muhamad in person and asked him to inform his wile aoout --rs. /eightman * s call. Shaikh Mohamad promised to inform his wife to be | read y t0 receive Mrs. Meightman at 10 Ad', on the second day of Id and at the same time arranged that Shaikh Abdullah s car to oe put at ^rs. -eightman's disposal as his own was to be kept for you.As regards Mrs. /eightman's call on the wife of Shaikh Abdullah, Hi s Highness* Secretary says that he made the arrangements through the brother-in-law of Shaikh Abdullah. From the above it will be seen that proper arrangements were made for Mrs. feightman 1 s call on the 1st and 2nd days of ^d. 2. On the 2nd inst. the notice was’ sent to the Police department as usual for delivery to ^usuf Fai-hro. Our letters for Muharraq are alv/ays sent through the Police as we have no extra farrash to go to -uharraq. I will make feorkhscr enquiries from the Police and submit a further report on the subject. With regard to your Id call on Yusuf Fakhro. The circular was sent along with other letters addressed to the Sheikhs to the Police department as usual for delivery to their addressees. The Sheikhs* letters were duly delivered but it appears that the notice to Yusuf Fakhro was not sent to him. I submit herewith a. note from Abdul karim, clerk, Police department,in repl:/ to mine in which he says that the policeman who received the letter and signed the peon book was at fault for ^sending it to Yusuf r-, t Fakhro. I am very^that Mrs. V/eightman and yourself were inconvenieced on the second day of Id. In future I will attend to everything myself so that nothing of this sort should happen. scg P.AAccording to the Arabic calendar Id-al-Adlia v/ill tall on Friday the 11th February 1938. 2. in the absence of H.II.Shaikh Sir Hamad I think that you wish to call only on Shaikhs Abdullah, Salman and Rashid(Shaikh Muhammad being absent) and also the notables of Manamah anu muharra^ on whom you callea on last ’Id al Fitr, namely:- 1.
