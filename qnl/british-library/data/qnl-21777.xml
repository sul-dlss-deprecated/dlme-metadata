Impossible to identify definitely bombs dropped on Bahrain but portion of parachute flares of Italian manufacture and with instructions in Italian on it has been recovered. PoliticalI2 /- P. R. AT ^ BMHHBHi 1 I give below a more detailed account of the airraid on the Oil Refinery at Bahrain and subsequent events. 2. At about 3.15 a.m. on the 19th October one of the Refinery guards saw aircraft approaching from a southerly direc tion with their navigation lights burning. The consensus of opinion is that there were three enemy planes and this appears likely as the bombs were dropped in salvos of three, ihe machines flew over the Refinery at a height between two and three thousand feet and dropped some 40 bombs a number of which failed to explode. As soon as he had sighted the ai ‘craft the Refinery guard informed the Defence Officer and 1 am told that the lights of the Refinery were put out very soon after the first salvo of bombs had been dropped. The flares however could not be extinguished rapidly and it appears that the bombs were aimed at a point midway between the two flares on the east side of the Refinery. The position of one of these flares had been changed only a few days pre viously and had it remained in its former position it seems probable that the bombs would have fallen within the Definery area. Actually they fell about 300 yards to the east of the Refinery perimeter. The bombs were obviously of small calibre as the craters were not more than 8 to 10 feet across and 4 feet deep. There were no casualties and no damage whatsoever was done. I personally visited .he scene with the Senior Naval Officer at dawn. Guards were at once placed on the area where the bombs fell and to-day a oyal Air Force expert arrived by Blenheim to inspect the duds. While I was still at the Camp a message was received to the effect that a single aircraft had dropped some seven bombs close to Dharan but it now seems that the number of airc aft which took part in this raid was three and that the number of bombs dropped was between 20 and 30. As already reported there was no serious damage and there were noc asualties.- 2 - io 2. The following precautions have b een t aken for the future by the Defence Officer: (1) Four light machine guns posts have been placed at selected sites close to the Refinery* (2) Listening posts have been established at Awali* Refinery and Sitra. (3) A total black-out has been enforced at the Refinery Oil Field, Awali and the Cooly Camp* (4) Car lamps have been dimmed. (5) A guard consisting of a detachment of the Defence Force armed with a light machine gun has been sent to Muharraq to look after the landing ground. (6) Patrols round the Refinery perimeter have been increased. (7) Trenches to act as air r aid shelters are being constructed at selected parts in the Refinery, Awali Camp and Cooly Camp areas for the protection of personnel working or living there. 3. As the Company have sufficient oil in storage tanks to meet immediate orders the Refinery has been closed for a few days in order to enable a system of lighting to be evolved which will not be visible from the air but which will be sufficient for operational purposes. The Refinery would in any case have been closed on the SG'oh October as by then storage tanks would have been full to capacity. The position has been further aggravated by the news thatt he tanker 'Ketty Brovig' which was due here on the 31st October was damaged after a collision at Singapore. 4. Every effort has been made to introduce a black-out in Manama and Muharraq and it was surprisingly successful and was apparently not objected to. To impose a complete black-out in Bahrain is almost impossible particularly during the month of Ramadhan and efforts have been concentrated /-- 3 - 11 concentrated on extinguishing all lights which might be of use to aircraft in identifying the Islands. As a temporary measure Captain Howes has taken charge of t he black-out arrangements for Manama and Muharraq and has Mr. Furber f the Assistant State Engineer, and Shaikh Khalifah to assist him. 5. Ships entering Bah ain have been warned to black-out and C.A.S.O.C. have been asked to assist by imposing as far as possible a black-out over their Camp and Oil Field area. \ 6# Captain Howeswith Mr. de Grenier visited the Shaikh on the morning of the 19th October and informed him of what had happened.

October 21st 1940 . Acting on orders from King Prince Feisal arrived Jedda night of 19th and yesterday summoned the British Minister and afterwards the Italian Minister to the Palace. This morning Nejib gave me following version or meeting between Feisal and Italian Minister. When confronted with news of bombing of Dharan Italian Minister expressed complete ignorance and stated that it was undoubtedly act of British done with purpose of arousing Arab animosity against Italians. Feisal replied that Bahrain also had been bombed and that he could not conceive of British bombing their own oil fields and installations and that he was convinced that both Bahrain and Dharan were bombed by Italian planes. At that point message was handed to Feisal stating Rome Radio had officially announced Italian bombing of Bahrain. Italian Minister expressed deepest sorrow stating that bombing of Dharan was clearly done by mistake and added that because he knew policy of his Government he could give Feisal firmest assurances that such a mistake would never be made in future. Feisal answered that these personal assurances w r ere insuffi cient and that official assurances of the Italian Government promised were required. This the Italian Minister /to obtain and the meeting ended. Thereafter the Italian Minister coded a lengthy wire to Rome which was handed to Feisal for despatching. The wire was sent last evening. MeJib then added that Feisal is personally convinced that Dharan was bombed by mistake and that no such mistake would be made in future. Because of this conviction Feisal feels according to Nejib that the Company acted too hurriedly in suspending work,#. Also according to He jib Feisal plans to call me to Palace after receiving official assurances of Italian Government and to inform me that since these assurancesassurances are acceptable to the Saudi Arabian government they should also be acceptable to Company and consequently the Company should resume its work. From other sources I was given identical report of Feisal ! s convictions and plans. Also this morning British Minister called with Legations telegram of Bahrain and Dharan bombings which he read. There after he explained that during his meeting with Feisal he had expressed opinion that Italians had at first mistaken Dharan for Bahrain and had dropped their bombs before realising the mistake. He added however that he was personally of the opinion that no mistake had been made and that he had given the above explanation to Feisal because he felt that the Saydi Arabian ijovernment preferred to believe that Dharan bombing was a mistake and because he felt it was better at this time that they did believe it was a mistake. However he later expressed the conviction that the bombing was done as a propaganda measure which is rather inconsistent with the expression of the belief that Dharan bombing was intentional. This might be explained by desire that we regard the bombing as intentional.

Dear Peel, With reference to your P.Z.5716/40 of the 24th October, 1940. The development by the Italians of the Cant Z.1007B long range aircraft has now made possible a light intermittent scale of air attack on Bahrein. The recent attack, which entailed a flight of 2,500 miles, requires an effort by the Italians altogether out of proportion to the results obtained and may have been undertaken partly for propaganda purposes and partly as an endeavour to draw off our A.A. defences from elsewhere These aircraft carrying a heavier load of bombs could have been much more effectively employed on nearer objectives. It is therefore unlikely that these flights will be repeated frequently. It is of course, desirable to establish A.A. defences at Bahrein to counter these attacks, but whilst we are still so short of Fighters, A.A. guns and searchlights for the defence of other important targets with a higher scale of attack, we can do little more at the present time than make the best use of the H.A. gun which has been installed by the Navy, and the machine guns already there to meet low flying attack. All possible passive defence measures should, of course, be undertaken including the institution of a warning system.

This view was followed in the report of the Chiefs of Staff Sub Committee dated 25th July, 1938 (Paper C.0.S.752 and C.1.D.1461-B) and underlay the preparation of the defence plans for Bahrein, which were designed only to meet the danger ol tribal attack or sabotage.
