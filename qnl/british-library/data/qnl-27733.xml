This is a very complete and useful report which concludes with a series of recomnendations for the prevention of mosquito breedir^ and the consequent reduction of malaria. These recommendations are clear cut, and well defined. It is now for the local authorities to consider them in detail and take measures to carry them out. Some are simple, others are more comprehensive and expensive but, if malaria is to be kept under control, there can be no question of adopting the first and neglect- ir^ the latter. 3. The question of training a medical officer in anti-malaria work would seem to be the first requirement. Perhaps the authorities would wish to have an officer trained in the Malaria Glass held annually by the Malaria Institute of India. If so, application should be made for the reservation of a place in the class without avoidable delay.

IN INDIA CMV6 LETTER)0 FINAL EFFORT ON THE MALARIA SURVEY OF BAHREIN ISLANDS. BY Major M. K. AFRIDI, I.M.S. (Malaria Institute of India.) Introduction and Summary of the Report. Investigations outlined in this report were carried out between May 12th and June 17th, 1938. In the Preliminary Report on Malaria Survey of Bahrein Islands, a detailed account was given of the amount of malaria prevailing in the various sections of these Islands and evidence was produced to show that while the incidence of malaria in most towns was intimately related to the presence or otherwise of gardens in their immediate vicinity, in some localities, such as Rifa-ash-Sharki, a moderate degree of malaria prevailed in their absence. During the present investigation a comprehensive survey of anopheline mosquitoes was carried out with a view to determining the bionomics of the malaria-carrying species. Special attention was paid to the study of its breeding habits and behaviour which had particular bearing on the causation of malaria in localities which were situated at some distance from the gardens. The results of these investigations are embodied in the main report. Here it is proposed to summarise the salient features of these findings and of the measures recommended for the control of malaria in Bahrein. Mosquito breeding in the gardens varied with the method of irrigation in use, the determining factor being the prevalence and degree of water logging. It was most marked in gardens irrigated by flowing springs and occurred to a lesser extent in those irrigated by artesian wells. The main springs and the larger irrigation watercourse!; were free from larvae, but breeding occurred profusely in seepage pools, drains and feeder channels. As regards domestic breeding places, the shallow domestic wells and private gardens constituted the most extensive sources of anophelines, while localised breeding grounds were furnished by seepage pools and stagnant drains. The only natural factor which had adverse influence on the breeding of mosquitoes in Bahrein Islands was the presence of the local variety of small fish Aphanius (Lebias) dispar (Riippell). It was noticed that no mosquito breeding occurred in situations where this fish had free access to the larvae and was present in sufficient numbers.JbnSS arfi bsd*£*h x .H-£V\8 g\SS\V 1 .oil 'lojd'ol 1o woO dob ^nxn'isvofi f Y'iBd‘o'ios£ eri*t moil t 8S(?i f learned'^ iictsoso# ri^xbal e i)ii3o3 vioaivbii oilxdriQioc. . xiileG well t noi j-Bioo88/:. ^ V . a bridle I ni eirli’S 'lo # ye vi l£ blub 1b u tfA exid - rid’iw i^iilae eoaebncag t 8S91 t \Bll d$d end’ bed'll dTiemnlevaC' mioiai od - bs, evjBii lied - a -id-eevni fiiiBlBm bed’elq. The species of anophelines responsible for the incidence of malaria in Bahrein is A. stephensi being the chief, if not the sole, vector in these Islands. This mosquito selects its day time resting places in close proxi mity to its breeding grounds, but there was evidence to show that in search of food it may travel backwards and forwards daily covering, under certain conditions, long distances up to nearly two miles. «oioq0i eixi bed'dirndue aarf nd’iweieri biBWiol od - dnemmsYOv fiieiiieS . drtemch noinw d’loqsi luleeu eiid' 10I saoxd'sbag iTieupBenoo sxld' bj i£0lo ex'? anoxdx-bnsrrr 1 Boioiiorld'UB Lsool end’ 10I yiibo od' asiDfijeem e: 5vxe fieri ©iqmoo 9 iom ©ib , 101,1^0 lebnu d'qeji ecf o -doeJfeea bne da.ix'l eiid gft ix i&amp;oxllo iF.oxbarr . dnomeixupoi daixl erfd' leoxllo oe evBri od- eiid' xd Y^^ suflf ^ bluorla fioxdxoxIqqB , aaiilo srid - ni: oob, It must, however, be pointed out that as these investigations covered a short period in one year only, the above findings require to be confirmed and supplemented by further researches, especially as regards the habits and breeding grounds of mosquitoes during the autumnal months. It is essential, therefore, that the medical officer in charge of the anti- malarial operations should receive special training in malariology. He would then be in a position to continue these observations and modify Anti-malarial organisation in accordance with his findings. As regards the measures recommended for the control of malaria, these may be considered under two heads, viz., temporary and permanent. The temporary measures are designed for the immediate control of malaria and are not to be considered as a substitute for permanent measures. The use of larvivorous fish and paris green are considered to be the most suitable larvicidal agents for the control of mosquito breeding in Bahrein Islands. The essential requisite for the success of these tem porary anti-larval measures, however, is that they should be carried out under strict supervision. Weeding and canalising of drains and proper edging of pools require unremitting care and application, without which little or no reduction in mosquito breeding may be expected from the use of fish and paris green only. The permanent measures, on the other hand, aim at complete eradica tion of breeding places. In the garden area the remedial measures should be directed towards the relief of waterlogging by means of (a) restriction in supply of irrigation water and (b) provision for proper drainage. The improvement of drainage- by realigning surface drains is not feasible in most places, and vertical drainage therefore offers the only possible solu tion to this problem. Among the ^domestic breeding places the shallow wells should be filled in. Other important sources of malaria-carrying anophelines are the irrigation channels and depressions in private gardens and appropriate measures for dealing with these must be enforced without delay. Artesian wells in the urban areas used for drinking and washing purposes are harmless so long as arrangements exist for the proper and rapid dis posal of splash water by means of covered cement drains. RESULTS OF THE ANOPHELINE SURVEY. A.—Breeding Places of Anopiieline Mosquitoes.

It should be particularly mentioned that the deep Hanaini wells in Rifa-ash-Sharki were repeatedly found to he free from mosquito larvae. (b) Artesian Wells. The artesian wells located within the urban limits of Manama town were frequently examined and no breeding was found either in their drains or inside the houses which received extension pipes from these wells. The only situation where mosquito breeding could be attributed to the urban wells was in the pools formed by leakages from a well near Naim Kasaibi huts. Similarly in Moharrak and Gilali the drains and the house connections of the artesian wells were invariably free from larvae. But in the former place, breeding was found in a small garden sump. In Sukaiya, although the artesian wells were free from mosquito breeding, larvae were collected from the drains designed for the disposal of splash water. In Hidd, although the artesian wells are sunk in the central part of the town, extension pipes have recently been installed leading to the sea coast where washing and watering places are now located. In the exist ing state, the artesian wells give rise to no mosquito breeding. (c) Ornamental Waters and Private Gardens. These were frequently found to contain larvae of A. stephensi, the irrigation channels and the reservoirs being the chief sources of breeding.Nine out of fourteen private gardens inspected in Manama town were thus incriminated of which the following may be specially mentioned: — 1. Municipal Garden. Larvae were found in a sluice chamber con taining a leaking valve. 2. Agency Garden. Breeding was found in scour pits in the irriga tion channels and in a small tank constructed for impound ing leakages from the artesian well. 3. Adviser’s Garden. Larvae were collected from scour pits in irrigation channels. 4. Mission Hospital. Breeding was encountered in sluice chambers, water reservoirs and drains. (d) Water Storage Jars and Overhead Cisterns. Water jars were a fruitful source of culicine larvae, but no anophehne larvae were collected from a total of 354 jars examined m all parts of Bahrein Island. Of the 10 overhead cisterns existing in Manama, only 2 were mosqinto- nroof. Mosquito breeding was, however, found neither in the mosquito proof nor in the non-mosquito-proof types of the cisterns. (a\ Ppasnits. These could not be examined. (f) Borrow-pits. Most of these were dry. Those situated close to springs or artesian wells contained leakage water and were then found invariably to harbour the larvae of A. stephensi. (g) Reclamation Pits. No breeding was found in these pits on repeated inspection. B. The Relationship of Mosquito Breeding to the Salinity of Water in the Breeding Places. Salinity of a number of samples of water from representative breeding places was determined. The results are shown below: — Parts of Presence or chlorine per otherwise of 100,000. A. stephensi. 1.

C. —The Larvivorous Activity of the Local Fish. The Director, Zoological Survey of India, was kind enough to examine 10 specimens of the local fish which he identified as Aphanius (Lcbias) dispar (Riippell). This variety of fish is ubiquitous in Bahrein Islands and prevails in large numbers in springs, irrigation channels and drains in the Date Palm Groves. It was observed that in collections of water harbouring this fish, mosquito breeding occurred only in portion where larvae were inaccessible to fish, such as in side pools and hoof-marks and in drains covered with grass. In order, however, to determine the extent to which fish could be utilised for the control of mosquito breeding in the field, these observa tions were extended to include varying experimental conditions described below: — (1) A small reservoir in the Agency Garden in which mosquito breed ing was constantly found was stocked with 100 fish. Breeding ceased immediately and the reservoir remained free from larvae throughout the period of observations lasting one month. (2) A drain choked with grass containing large numbers of fish and mosquito larvae, was divided into two sections. One part was clean- weeded and the other was allowed to remain in its original state. Within 48 hours no larvae could be found in the former section of the drain while uninterrupted breeding continued in the latter section. (3) Observations were made on a number of lateral terminals of the irrigation channels in a garden in which large number of mosquito larvae were present. After stocking them with fish no breeding could be detected on the following day. From these observations it is concluded that Lebias Aphanius is an actively larvivorous fish and that for the complete control of mosquito breeding it is essential that all vegetation, etc., should be removed from the surface of water so as to allow the fish to have free access to the larvae.

It should, however, be pointed out that this was probably due to the unusual meteorological conditions prevailing during the present year inasmuch as “Shamal” which is asso ciated with low atmospheric temperature in these Islands continued into the month of May. This is further borne out by the low numerical pre valence of A. stephensi which displayed an increase only in the third week of May.

(i) Measures for the Control of Breeding Places in the Gardens. These measures are designed for the relief of waterlogging in the gardens and may conveniently be described under the following head ings : — (a) Restriction in the Supply of Irrigation 11 atrr. In gardens irrigated by artesian wells, it is essential that they should he provided with valves to prevent the perennial and uncontrolled flow of water. As a further step towards controlling the supply of water each artesian well should possess a cement storage tank, breeding in which may be eliminated either by drying the tanks regularly for 24 hours once a week or by stocking thein with fish after their outlets have been blocked with wire gauge. Special attention should be paid to the immediate sur roundings of the artesian wells, where pits, depressions and disused wells should be completely filled and levelled. Over-irrigation being a constant feature of the gardens iriigated by springs, immediate steps should be taken to restrict the supply of water to their minimum requirements. Should this restriction result in surplus water, arrangements should be made for the discharge of the excess direct into the sea through “escapes” established on the main watercourses. (b) Drainage of the Gardens. Apart from the absence of fall in the ground covered by the gaidens the stagnation of water in the drains is due to the depth of their bed levels so that they remain headed up and discharge into the sea partially and that only at low' tide. These deep drains are necessitated by agricul tural considerations and are designed to receive seepage water rather than the surface overflow'. The underlying factor is the excessive salinity of the soil in Bahrein which the agriculturist attempts to remedy b\ means of seepages purposely created by the flooding of the gardens, the idea being that the seepage water would dissolve the salts during its passage through the soil It is obvious, however, that the success of this manoeuvre would depend upon the velocity of the flow in the drains, which, if deficient, would tend to render the land waterlogged especially as the surface sod in the garden area is unusually shallow’. When watuvogging supervenes the salt is re-deposited and a vicious circle is thus established. For these reasons it is highly desirable that both from the agricultural and the malaria viewpoints a serious attempt should be made to accelerate the flow of water in the drains. The re-ahgnment of surface drains by which this object would hare been attained, is unfortunately not hossi fir in the majority of the gardens. Recourse must therefore he had to vertical drainage which will probably be found feasible consideung t leI ■ r '—Tr v ' r ^*' JDOB VJ^ ^ vl . a' y *3 ^ -to 8v \ ^ DfiSS on'j bsi^i) ..H~£V\8S\SS\VI .oil 'lajisl to woO s Xbo^ gaxri'ievo-C' f v^jBvtoioec srft moit t 859i ^©draed^eci kiiif^ noiaBsefl 1 rL.T.xbnI jhi^oE ytosivM oititnoiou. .xdleQ well t rioitBioo88i •abaftlel nia^xxlM 10 vevidfc biubIbAI iW&lt;! s « •S» 1 end xiti. 1 / gnijons aonebnof 10 t 8S91 t 'YJsM xito ©rij- betjsJ jnecnnisvolj imotni od bi XK^BCHMila ev£ii tt^da -ij-eavni Bioelem bedeb ^oioq©! aid beddimduB aBri rfitireierl biBwiot ot insmcnsvo-D nieirieS . tnomd ifoim/ j-'ioqs'i luteeu ©lid - lot saoidsbri dneijpeenoo ©rid' b UBelo ©ib ano idfibn©rc aoiJ-iioiid'UB Isool end- 'io1 yiibo od BS'IBfiJBem e ©vieciadeiqrnoo 9'iom ©ijb eloid-noo lebriLi d-q©?! scf &lt;j -doelgon bae da lit ©rid ^ ni leoitto J&gt;*oiber . daomeiiupei daiit erfd peculiar hydrogeographical conditions existing in Bahrein. Moreover, as augurs and well-borers are available on the spot, very little expense would be incurred in giving this method a trial. The object of vertical drainage is to lead the surface water into a deep permeable stratum by means of a shaft passed through the impermeable layer. It is evident that the success of vertical drainage would depend upon the nature of this deep permeable layer as water must be dis charged above the artesian well level and in a situation where sufficient space is still available for its absorption. This optimum level can only be determined by trial bores, and an attempt in this direction should first be made in the Fort garden. Once this method has been tested, priority should be given to remedy drains which traverse long distances before discharging into the sea or those which possess no outfall. Examples of the former are drains emanating from the Sukaiya gardens and of the latter the drain running north of Kasr-ul-Maluk. The measure can them be extended to all the gardens within a radius of one mile from Manama which should be divided into a number of blocks from each of which drains should dis charge into one or more vertical shafts. It should be mentioned that the principles involved in the application of vertical drainage were discussed with the Chief Engineer, Bahrein, who expressed himself in general agreement with them. (ii) Measures for the control of breeding in pools formed by seepages and leakages. Seepage pool may he permanently eradicated by means of a vertical drain in its most dependent part. Filling is another but more expensive method of dealing with such pools. Drainage should first be directed against those collections of seepage water in which breeding is known to occur, such as pools to the west of the Fort. The large seepage lagoon inside the Kasaibi garden near Naim was found to be free from mosquito larvae and its drainage would there fore be unnecessary from the malaria viewpoint. Leakages from springs and irrigation channels should be prevented by maintaining their banks in proper repair. If collections of water result from the combined effect of leakage and seepage, such as those situated to the north of the Lunatic Asylum in Manama and those near Adari and Khamis springs, they should be interconnected by means of cement lined drains and discharged direct into the sea. Should surface drainage be not feasible, then an outfall into a vertical drain should be made in the vicinity. Similar action should be taken in regard to leakages from artesian wells, but in this case the vertical drain should be bored at some distance from the well. ^ 'leoiilo as evjsrf od- *v exij- \6 Yllsufta hi u oils no i d'Bo x Iq qB aL.Glo ©xid- nx dob (iii) Measures for the control of domestic breeding places. (a) Shallow Domestic Wells. It is essential that these wells should be completely filled, as they constitute an extremely dangerous source of mosquito breeding. Any demand for extra water created by the enforcement of this measure should be met by the installation of a number of additional artesian wells.11 i Bahrein.

Any ; of this measure should nal artesian wells. (b) Artesian Wells and Drains. The artesian wells for the supply of water for drinking and washing purposes in urban areas should conform to the following design: — (1) They should be provided with valves situated at ground level; (2) They should possess no storage tank; (3) The well shaft should open into a horizontal cross pipe fitted with taps; (4) They should be carefully sited so that their splash water can be drained through a short channel direct into the sea, the level of the drain being such that the discharge of water takes place freely at high tide. If an artesian well is located at some distance from the sea, the splash water should be led into a completely covered soakage well or alternately into the sea through the medium of covered cement drain. Uncoveied or earth drains should not be permitted except where the artesian well or its wash ing place is located on the Sea Coast. The existing drains in Manama were found to be a fruitful source of culicine breeding especially in those portions where the current of water was sluggish. The method recommended for controlling such breeding is to flush the drains once a week from overhead cisterns installed at vantage points. Care should, however, b** taken to install cisterns of the mosquito-proof design described in Appendix II. (c) Private Gardens. Private gardens being an important source of mosquito breeding should receive careful attention. It is essential that the artesian wells in these gardens should be provided with valves and storage tanks and the latter stocked with fish. All irrigation channels should be lined with cement and depressions and pits levelled thoroughly so as to eliminate even the smallest collection of water as breeding was found in shallow puddles less than 9' in diameter. Sanction for private gardens should be withheld unless (the plans satisfy the above requirements. 2. Temporary Measures of Control. Control by means of temporary measures on a large scale will be necessary to deal with breeding places until these have been eradicated by permanent projects, although even after the completion of the latter aii organisation on a reduced scale will have to be maintained to deal with such breeding places as cannot be permanently abolished. (a) Staff. For the success of the antimalarial measures, temporary or per manent, it is essential that a medical officer trained in malanolagtf should be placed in charge of the operations. I understand that the Bahrein Government contemplates the appointment of a Medical Officer shortl&gt; and I strongly recommend that an application should be submitted im mediately through the Government of India for the attendance of this officer at a course in Malariology to be held by the Malaria Institute of India in March 1939. He would thereafter be in a better position to instruct the subordinate personnel into their duties and to place t organisation on a scientific basis.12 •*-*J » Jv £\ V {0 0 i)nSS 8fi+ bsteb x .

The garden area, as a whole, should be subdivided into a number of convenient units each of which should be placed under a separate staff.

If the control of mosquito breeding in these by means of canalization and fish be impracticable, paris green should be employed^ Ghurafa wells and pits should be similarly controlled by a combination of fish and paris green after removing the floating vegetation and debris from the surface of water by means of long-handled rakes. Seepage pools should be stocked with fish and their edges should be cleared of grass and cut perpendicularly so as to allow no collection of water disconnected from the main body. As a further safeguard the edges may be treated w ? ith 1 per cent, paris green. 3. Control Measures Recommended for Rural Areas. The essential preliminary to any antimalaria campaign in the rural areas is the provision of adequate treatment for all cases of malaria. Arrangements should therefore be made for the free distribution of quinine to the sick in the malaria season. As regards anti-larval measures, the types of breeding places ,n the rural areas are similar to those found in the ^rdens wound Manama, and the temporary and permanent measures outlined above would there fore applv equally to the control of malaria in the villages 1' rural area's however, it may be possible to enlist the assistance of the inhabit, ants in weeding and canalising the drains, although in the initial stages paid labour will probably be necessary for the purpose.

Preparation of Paris Green Mixture. Paris Green. Paris green in a microcrystalline powder of emerald green colour which contains over 50 per cent, arsenious oxide. One of the most effective brands of paris green is “Britway” obtainable from the Karachi branch of the Imperial Chemical Industries (India), Ltd. In the ouan titles used for anti-larval purposes, it is absolutely harmless to animals and plants and its lethal action is confined to anophelme larvae only. The annual consumption of Paris Green in Manama and its surround ings is estimated at two cwt. Diluent. It is recommended that road dust or fine sand which is readily avail able m Bahrein should be used as diluent. The dust should be collected m bulk and passed through sieves in order to get rid of the larger particles. The sifted diluent should then be stored ready for use. A simple type of inexpensive sieve consists of two rectangular wooden trays fitted one above the other, the bottom of each being made of wire gauze. The upper tray is fitted with ordinary fly-proof gauze, mesh 12 Jo the linear inch; the lower with copper or brass wire gauze, mesh 40 nrrl &gt; T ii V’ 6 S I deS ° f . b 2 th tra y s slo P e Awards at the top in er to prevent the dust from spilling out.

This report is based on investigations carried out between January 18th and January 30th, 1938. During this period my acUvities were canc entr on eliciting information concerning the severity and distribution of mala in the different parts of Bahrein Islands and on studying the correlation the phvsiograpMcal and meteorological features with the inmdence of the diLse While collections were made of a number of specimens of anopheiine “toe!; a detailed inspection of all the potentUl breeding ^esjaan^ undertaken. These specimens represent the species ' Inc p months and may or may not be the carrier species of malaria that the solution of the problem of malaria in Bahrein wiU S only after further investigations which it is proposed to carry out durin, malaria season. . The investigations were confined to the main islands of Ba rem an ^ Muharrak, and only such towns and villages were visited as • political and economic importance and, at the same time, displayed varying environments representative of other localities. A—General Description. Bahrein Island. The main island of Bahrein, situated in latitude 20=-^ and longitude 50°51' E„ lies in a V-shaped Gulf of the Arabian coast. The mainland sur rounds it on all three sides and lies roughly at a distance of 20 mi e&gt;. The island measures 30 miles in length. Its maximum breadth of 10 miles is attained in the northern section, the island gradually narrowing to the south to terminate in a headland called Ras-el-Bar. At a tatance of about three miles from the northern coast, a great marine indentation called h al-Kabb cuts into the island, penetrating from the east coast aim &gt; centre. The greater part of the island, especially the coastal strip, is a san), flat and low lying plain, but the surface gradually rises from a • i r, a bare stony plateau in the centre about 100-200 feet high. In thejrfdle of the plateau is an oval-shaped depression which is encircled , posed of Eocene rocks of limestone with an admixture o g&gt; psiun . ous matter. In the middle of the depression rises the only group ol h It m the island. These are known as Jabl-al-Dukhan and attain a height of 440 feet. Cultivation is confined to a narrow belt of date palm plantations bonlenng the aforesaid marine indentation in the northern and in ;ies which covers roughly 18—20 square miles of the total area of 18 . of the Island. These date groves are profusely watered trom eoJ i*.). s \ b &gt; Ml 4EADwhich form a number of clear streams of warm and slightly brackish water These springs are a special feature of the island, and Lorimer (1915) considers that they are undoubtedly fed by the drainage of the high-lands of Najd in Central Arabia, whence the water travels eastwards by subterranean passages. The localities examined on the island were Manama town, village, Rifa-a-Ash Sharqi and Sakhir. Sukaiyfi Manama is the chief port of Bahrein island, and is situated on the coast at its north eastern corner. It extends 1|- miles along the sea and has a depth of about | mile inland. The buildings are for the greater part of masonry, but the habitations in the outskirts consist of mat huts with sloping roofs, standing in small courtyards surrounded by hurdles of upright date fronds. To the south of the town and in an open plain are situated Manama Fort and the palace of His Highness the Sheikh, while further south immediately adjoining these and curving to the west of the town is a belt of dense palm cultivation. The population of the town is estimated at 40,000 to 50,000 and the subsoil water level is within a few feet of the surface. A number of seepage ponds exist, especially to the south-west of the town, in the open plain between it and the Fort. Sukaiyah is a small village consisting of scattered houses lying within the date palm groves. It is four miles south-west of Manama, and the general aspect of the village is similar in character to that met with in the villages situated inside the cultivated coastal strip. Rifa-a-Ash Sharqi is a large fortified village which overlooks the central depression at its north-eastern corner. It occupies a dreary and barren site with no cultivation within TJ miles all round. The climate is, compara- ti\ ely speaking, drier than in the rest of the island and the village is treated as a natural sanitorium of Bahrein Islands. Beneath the cliff and close to the village at a distance of | mile are two wells called the Hanani wells, one of which yields clear sweet water in great demand throughout the island, while the other is not in use and contains a collection of polluted water. SakMr consists of a number of isolated buildings occupied by the Sheikh and his relatives. It lies within the central depression about a mile north west of Jabl-al-Dukhan. There is no vegetation or cultivation within U miles of this site, and the only apparent sources of mosquito breeding apart rom domestic collections of water consists of three wells in the immediate neighbourhood. Muharrak Island. Ihis is situated to the north-east of the main island of Bahrein and is separated from it by a shallow d strait. U miles in breadth. Recently a causeway ,as been thrown across the greater part of this strait, but land communication between the two islands has not vet been established, small gap still intervenes. as aMuharrak island is indented on its south-western edge by two deep inlets which greatly reduce its square area. It presents a sandy bare prospect and on account of the lack of water, date plantations occur in isolated cir cumscribed patches in places where well irrigation is possible. There is only one fresh-water spring called Zimma near Hidd, the water from which, how- does not flow but slowly oozes into two large excavations from which it is lilted for irrigation. The island is famous for its submarine fresh-water springs which exist near Abu Mahur, about 600 yards south of Muharrak Fort. The localities surveyed in this island were Muharrak town, Hidd, and Galali village. Muharrak town is situated on the northernmost of the three promon tories of Muharrak island and is surrounded by sea at high tide on three sides, east, west and south. The town is more congested and compact than Manama, but has much less cultivation in its neighbourhood. Basaitin, a village about f mile distant from the northern edge of the town and the small islet of Abu Mahur located about 200 yards south of the town, contain the only date palm groves, irrigated from wells and fresh-water springs respectively. The population is estimated at 30,000 to 40,000 and includes a much larger proportion of pearl fishing community than Manama. A number of artesian wells have recently been sunk all along the coastal part of the town, except one well situated in the middle of the town. Hidd is located on the south-eastern point of Muharrak island. It covers the promontory for a distance of about f mile, and at high tide is connected with the island by a neck of land only 400 yards wide. The water supply is from a number of artesian wells inside the town, supplemented by a spring in a date palm grove called Zimma about % mile to the north. The population is estimated at 8,000. In addition to Zimma palm grove, the islet of Abushahir, situated one mile south-east of the town, contains a large plantation. An artesian well about 400 yards north of Zimma irrigates the only other patch of palm trees in the neighbourhood of this town. Galali is a village on the north-eastern coast of Muharrak island, inhabited almost entirely by a small pearl fishing community. Up to 1930 or so the nearest plantation was in Ain Mohd. bin Salim, about half a mile away, but another grove irrigated by an artesian well has recently been planted about J mile west of the village. Inside the village itself two artesian wells were sunk in 1929, and their effect on malaria incidence is discussed in a later section. (Page 15). Climate and Seasons. Bahrein lies outside the zone of the S. W. monsoon and the seasons are said to be characteristic of a temperate zone, viz., a rainless summer and a wet winter. The climatic conditions are, however, by no means “ temperate ”, and the only favourable remark that can be made for the climate of Bahrein is that it is somewhat better than that of Masqat, one of the hotted places in the world.&gt;1 The prevailing wind popularly known as Shamal blows from the north west, and during the winter months it alternates with a south-easterly wind. Shamal blows more steadily during the months of May, June and July, when it is locally known as Barih. The common belief is that the failure of Barih results in failure of rain in the ensuing winter, and according to Lorimer some recorded instances corroborate this theory. The meteorological records for Manama are available from October 1901. They show that the temperature ranges between the recorded maximum of 107'5 0 F. and a minimum of 40°F. Roughly, the weather from October to April inclusive is pleasant ; May and June are hot months, but the heat is still tempered by Barih which may vary and thus affect the temperature prevailing in these months. From the middle of June till the end of September the heat is oppressive with occasional breezes, the temperature remaining permanently above 100°F. The fortnightly averages of temperature and relative humidity for the years 1932-1937 are given in Table L The average rainfall is 3| inches a year, but the relative humidity of the atmosphere is constantly high owing to the proximity of the sea, the average being 79-80%. The rain is strictly confined to the winter months and it all falls in the course of a few days, the average number of rainy days being 3 to 6 each year. Population and Industry. As no census has been taken, only approximate estimates of the popula tion can be given. Up to the last decade the total population of the entire Archipelago was reckoned at 100,000, but recently there has been a consider able increase and it is now estimated at approximately 150,000. The prosperity of the island, apart from the date plantations and trade as a “ clearing house ” for the mainland for Arabia, depended up to 1931 almost entirely on the pearl fisheries which are conducted in the neigh bouring waters. The pearling season lasts roughly from the middle of May till the middle of October. The preparations for the operations, however, commence in April, when a considerable influx of divers from the surrounding coastal and inland towns occurs and pearl merchants arrive from all over the world. This produces a large floating population in Bahrein during these months. Recently, owing to the discovery of oil-fields in the islands a further immigration of Americans and Europeans together with Indian and Iraqi labour has occurred, particularly since 1931. The permanent population of Bahrein includes a variety of races. Of these’ the most numerous race or class is composed of Baharinas whose exact origin is still in doubt, being considered by some authorities as an aboriginal race and by others as descendants of an early Arab tribe. Next in numbers are the ruling Arab tribes who have resided in the islands for over two centuries. Thirdly, a large number of Iranian families have settled on this island at various periods, and these ha ly, negroes geneous groi No reco opinion is in the past deci was little or to literature scourge fror plete annihi fever ” whei that the Pn The statem&lt; duty they d the disease 1 and the sea in the ninth the liver ”, principal ei than the ho months.

Fourth ly, negroes and half-castes provide a fairly large element. Finally a hetero geneous group is composed of Iraqis. Jews, Europeans and Americans. B.—Prevalence of Malaria. No records of any previous malaria surveys are available, but local medical opinion is inclined to the view that the disease has increased considerably during the past decade. While this may have been the case, the assertion that there was little or no malaria in the island until recently is not borne out by reference to literature. In fact, it would appear that the disease had been a recognised scourge from remote times. Thus Belgrave (1935) describes the almost com plete annihilation of a Portuguese contingent of 400 men by an “ epidemic of fever ” when they invested Manama Fort in late September 1529, and mentions that the Protuguesc and Hormuzian units of the force were equally affected. The statement that “ when only thirty-five (out of 400 men) remained fit for duty they decided to withdraw ” indicates the severity of the epidemic. That the disease was probably malaria can be deduced from the absence of mortality and the season of its incidence. Wilson (1928) quotes Qudama, who wrote in the ninth century A. D. that the climate of Bahrein “ induces congestion of the liver ”, probably malarial. Lorimer (1915) states that Malaria fever is the principal enemy of the Persian Gulf, and that cold weather is more unhealthy than the hot, although in some places sickness is more prevalent at transitional months. Finally Harrison (1924) after 12 years of hospital practice in Manama, refers to the place as “ full of fever” and adds that “all along the coast (Arabian) the efficiency of the population is reduced by malaria to a mere fraction of what it ought to be ”. From the foregoing it is permissible to conclude that the disease has pre vailed in the islands from remote times, and the problem to be considered is whether any recent increase in severity has occurred or not. The Amount of Malaria. The amount of malaria in a locality is assessed from :— (а) Vital statistics. (б) Hospital attendance records. (c) Spleen rate (percentage of children with enlarged spleens). (d) Parasite index (percentage of children with malaria parasites in their blood). (a) Vital statistics. There are none available for Bahrein Islands. (6) Hospital records. The number of malaria cases and the number of cases from all causes treated at Victoria Memorial Hospital, Manama, for 1920-1937 are given in1 i' ■- i Table II. In the analysis of these figures there are two factors which must be considered. In the first place, the variation in total population is not known. Secondly, the increase in the popularity of the Western system of medicine would tend to produce an apparent increase in the number of attendances. The available figures, therefore, do not necessarily signify an actual increased inci dence, nor are they always comparable from year to year. But a reference to Table II will show that the total number of cases from all causes who received treatment at the hospital during the years 1933-37 varied within narrow limits, and consequently the malaria incidence range for these years is comparable. Table III and Chart I* show fortnightly * Not to be printed.11 The prevalence of the disease, however, does not show the same degree of corre lation with humidity and rainfall as in Northern India, the reason being that in these islands the humidity is favourable for the life of mosquito throughout the year, and the determining factor for the incidence of the disease is the temperature. In Northern India, on the other hand, favourable humidity prevails only during a limited period during and after the monsoon. With regard to spleen rates among £ islands are shown h These figures are, however, being subjected to further analysis and will be alluded to again in the final report. (c) Spleen rates. In order to determine reliable spleen rates for each locality, it w r as consi dered that religious schools would be more suitable, as they were attended by children between 4-14 years of ages from houses in the immediate neighbour hood. Table IV shows the results of these examinations. From Table IV it will be seen that the occurrence of enlarged spleens is not uniform. Thus, in Manama town where it was possible to conduct the examination of a sufficient number of children in the different parts of the town, the maximum number of enlarged spleens was encountered in the Fort area and in the adjoining ‘ Naim’ area. In the Municipal garden area which occupies a more central position the spleen rate was below 10 per cent, but the figures for Jama Masjid and Market Area show that even in the centre of the town, the rates increase in the northern section. Finally Hura which is situated in the south-eastern portion of the town is highly malarious. An interesting feature is the prevalence of high figures for average enlarged spleen in all localities except Jama Masjid area, indicating that in the latter area a new factor has been introduced recently. With regard to the spleen rate in Muharrak town, it was fomd that the figures for the entire population were much lower than those for Manama. Owing to the congested and compact nature of the town it was not possible to divide it into many sections, but a rough sub-division into northern and south ern halves showed that the latter contained a larger proportion of enlarged spleens.

Arabs 238 69 23-8% Baharinas &gt; .. 103 34 33 0% Iranians 65 29 44-6% From Table V it will be seen that the Arab children among whom are included the negroes and the half castes, showed the least number of enlarged spleens. As regards Baharinas and Iranians a higher spleen rate among the former is probably due to the location of their settlements in or near the gardens, while the high figures among the latter may indicate a higher racial susceptibility. (d) Parasite index. While the number of children who submitted to splenic examination, was, in most places, sufficient, much difficulty was encountered in obtaining their blood smears. As a consequence, the parasite index has been determined for each locality on a smaller number of examinations, as shown in Table VI. The figures in Table VI confirm the findings discussed in the preceding section under spleen rate. In the central parts of Manama Town (Municipal Gardens, Jama Masjid areas), the parasite rate is in excess of the spleen rate. This signifies that while transmission of malaria of fairly high degree was taking place it had not resulted in concurrent increase of splenic enlargement. Considering that treatment was available equally in all parts of the town, it may be inferred that the causative factors were either the production of fresh breeding places such as artesian wells or the introduction of new strains of the malaria parasite by the recent immigration or a combination of these two factors. Naim area and the Fort, on the other hand are typically severely infected sections representing a more constant and static form of malaria incidence. The remaining localitias call for no special comment, except that Hidd shows a comparatively high parasite rate, and here the role of artesian wells will have to be carefully elucidated.As regarls the species of parasites, the abnormally large proportion of Quartan infections is noteworthy.

C.—Anopheline Breeding Places. Detailed investigations into the breeding of anopheline mosquitoes will be carried out later in the year, and in this report it is proposed to describe the potential breeding grounds and to indicate their epidemiological significance. (1) Date Palm Groves. Date-palm plantations, which are almost the only agricultural product of the Island, are of three varieties. Nakl-al-Saih are those plantations which are watered from flowing streams by gravitation ; Nakhl-al-Duab are irrigated by means of skins raised by camels or donkeys walking down a slope ; and Nakhl-al-Ghurafa in which the water is raised from pits by means of wooden beam worked by man with the help of counterpoise. A fourth method of irrigation from artesian wells has been increasingly brought into use since 1925 especially along the coastal strip. From the malaria identical problems, « water do not affect if not the only, sour&lt; disused wells. For, i dip^he ground with tl aTr a varying pcric problem thus bears a near Madras. On the other hai grounds, as also are the newly planted st irrigation channels a drainage channels, w subsoil water.

(б) Artesian wells 1925, and at Muharr wells have multiplied and Muharrak towns and villages. The most import view is the adequacy water. The role of a fully dealt with in tb that they are frequentFrom the malaria viewpoint Nakhl-al-Duab and Nakhl-al-Ohurafa present identical problems, and the different methods utilised for lifting the water do not affect the mosquito production. In such gardens the chief, if not the only, source of breeding for mosquitoes is provided by the unfilled disused wells. For, in the greater part of the plantation area “ it suffices to dja^the ground with the hand and water is found ”, but this water turns brackish aTr a varying period and a new excavation is made in the vicinity. The problem thus bears a strong resemblance to that of the casuarina pits in Ennore near Madras. On the other hand Nakh-al-Saih is productive of more extensive breeding grounds, as also are those gardens which are irrigated by artesian wells. In the newly planted state the gardens are well terraced and the water in the irrigation channels after running alongside the trees is directed into deeper drainage channels, which in addition receive a certain amount of seepage subsoil water. As the result of repeated canalization both the irrigation and the drainage channels go deeper and deeper having little or no fall, producing ideal environments for the breeding of anopheline mosquitoes. In other places the ground being flat with little or no fall, the spring possesses insufficient head for irrigation purposes and deep irrigation channels are necessary. The gardens irrigated by flowing water are almost invariably water-logged, and contain numerous excavations into which seepage water accumulates, and this is utilised for household purposes. When this water turns brackish after varying periods new excavations are made, without filling the old ones where anopheline breeding was encountered. Finally the springs and large water courses provide a fruitful source of mosquito production, the larvae from which drift continually into the gardens. (m) Domestic Sources. Under this heading are included : (a) wells, (b) artesian wells, (c) water jars, (d) cesspits, (e) burrow-pits, and (/) reclamation pits. (а) Wells .—These exist extensively in private houses in Manama and Muharrak towns and are utilised for washing and bathing. They were the only sources of water for this purpose prior to 1925, when artesian wells were first brought into use. The wells, however, have not been filled in and the nature of mosquito breeding in them will be taken up at the next visit to the islands. (б) Artesian wells .—The first artesian well was sunk in Manama in March 1925, and at Muharrak in November of the same year. Since then these wells have multiplied considerably and at present about 19 exist in Manama ■and Muharrak towns respectively and a smaller number in all coastal towns and villages. The most important aspect of artesian wells from the malaria point of view is the adequacy or otherwise of a provision for the disposal of surplus water. The role of artesian wells in the causation of malaria will be more fully dealt with in the final report, but it is quite evident even at this stage that they are frequently associated with a high degree of malaria if the drainage15 m- of surplus water is not satisfactory. Thus, in Muharrak, where with one exception the artesian wells are situated along the coast, the water being conducted through short drainage channels direct into the sea, only a low degree of malaria prevails as is reflected in the spleen rates. On the other hand, the case of Galali is an outstanding example of the harmful effects of artesian wells. In this village two artesian wells were sunk in March and Julv 1929, and in April and May 1930 malaria broke out in an epidemic fdP?, involving a high incidence of mortality. One of the wells, situated in the centre of the village, discharged into a large cement tank, the outflow from which was utilised for the irrigation of a plantation on low-lying ground close to the village. Information obtained from local enquiries was to the effect that this well produced a considerable number of pools in the immediate neigh bourhood of the tank and in and around the plantation. Visual impressions also showed that the site of the previous garden was situated at such low level that drainage could not have been possible. The other well was sunk close to the coast and the water after collection into a tank led off direct into the sea. After the epidemic of April-May 1930, the former well was closed, and the garden was uprooted in December 1930. Since then, although a moderate degree of unexplained malaria still prevails, the local population is definitely of the opinion that the severity and the extent of the disease have decreased considerably. (c) Water jars .—Owing to the scarcity of water these jars are necessary for its storage. The jars are pyramidal in shape with a narrow bottom, which is not easy to clean, and frequently contains a deposit of greenish slime. Ins pection of a small number of jars showed full grown larvae of culicine mos quitoes but no anopheline larvae were encountered. (d) Cesspits .—This is the usual method of disposal of night-soil in towns. In masonry buildings the pipe leading down to the cesspits ensures a closed and protected system, but in poorer habitations a small hole about 6' in dia meter leads directly into the pit, which receives not only the night-soil but also domestic washings. While they would presumably be a fruitful source or culicine mosquitoes, it is doubtful whether they would contribute to the anopheline production to any appreciable extent. (e) Burrow-pits .—Owing to the lack of rain, the accumulation of water in burrow-pits is of negligible importance. If, however, the burrow-pits are situated in the neighbourhood of a spring or watercourse, seepage and over flow results in a perennial collection of water. The burrowpits to the north of the lunatic asylum in Manama furnish an example of the latter type, and here a fairly intensive degree of anopheline breeding was found to occur. (/) Reclamation pits .—Reclamation pits exist mostly in the coastal portion of Manama and Muharrak towns. The water is highly brackish and is con nected with the sea, as is shown by the fact that the level of water in the pits rises and falls with the tide. They showed no breeding even after frequent inspection.16 (in) Species of Anophelines collected in the 'present Survey. The following is the list of species collected :— 1. A. stephensi. 2. A. Jluviutilis. ^ 3. A. sergenti. Numerically tlie most predominent species was A. stephensi both in the adult catches and the larval collections. In the Fort out of a total adult catch of 33, A. stephensi numbered 30 the remaining 3 being A. sergenti. In the Agency out of a collection of G mosqui toes 5 were A. stephensi and one was a. fluviaiilis. The results of the larval collection is given in Table VII. Table VII. Total. A, stephensi. 1.

The larvae of the latter species were present in small side pools and bays of a fast running stream. A. sergenti was not collected in the larval form, Infection. No malarial infection in gut or gland was found in 21 female A. stephensi dissected. Discussion and Programme for Malaria Season ‘Enquiry, The effect of meteorological factors on the incidence of malaria has al ready been discussed in detail. The conclusions arrived at wore that the humidity in the island being consistently favourable throughout the year, variations in the length of period during which mean tomperature remained constantly between 75°F, and 90°F. determine the severity of the malaria season. With regard to the distribution of malaria, the spleen rates in Manama town, Sukaiya and Muharrak town would indicate that the causation of malaria was intimately related to the presence or otherwise of gardens in the immediate neighbourhood. But it is equally evident that gardens are not M14EAD17 the sole factor, and that a high degree of malaria may prevail in their absenc for example in Rifa-a-Ash-Sharqi and the Market and the Jama Masj id areas in Manama town. The native of the influences at work in these latter areas will probably provide an important clue to the malaria problem of the island. The case of Galali is in certain respects peculiar, as the history of mal£ in this village does not altogether furnish the reasons for the existing moderate endemicity. A solution of these problems will be forthcoming only after a detailed Anopheline survey, for which the following programme is proposed • (а) The determination of the vector species. (б) The bionomics of the vector species. (c) The relative intensity of breeding in (i) the gardens, (ii) the artesian wells and drains, (Hi) wells, pits and excavations, and (iv) water storage jars. (d) The feasibility of the employment of cheap sluicing methods and of larvivorous fish such as Gcmbusia affinis in the control of breed- ing. The following staff is suggested for these investigations (1) Medical Officer—To initiate the investigations, probable period of stay—one week. (2) One Sub-Assistant Surgeon'] (3) One Lab. Assistant VTo carry out investigations over a (4) One Insect Collector J period of six weeks. Measures of Control. It is clear that a complete programme of malaria control can only en outlined after the completion of the anopheline mosquito survey, but certab, measures are so urgent and necessary that they may be indicated in this reporit 1 bus it has already been pointed out that artesian wells, unless provided with el be lent drainage for surplus water, are, on epidemiological grounds, a fruitful source of malaria. It is recommended, therefore, that sanction be withheld rum sin ung any more artesian wells until their effect has been thoroughly in\ estigated, and a suitable type of an artesian well evolved. Secondly, owing to the isolated nature of the police lines in the Fort, it is coiw ere t at malaria in this locality would be amendable to control by the use of insecticidal sprays during next malaria season, viz., middle of March o mi r e o une. This method is strongly recommended and its details are given m the Appendix,Appkndix. Adult Mosquito Spraying in Fort Area.

Of these Islands only two are of any size or importance, namely, IJIanamah,which is 30 miles long, and 5 to 10 miles Wide. The second, Muharraq, which is more or less circular is of 5 miles diameter. Muharraq lies east of Manamah and about 1 mile distant from it. The names of the principal town of each Island are derived from those of the Island. Government • The present Ruler of Bahrain is Shaikh Sir Hamad bin 1 Isa A1 Khalifah, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., and he is assisted by an Adviser, Mr. C. Dalrymple Belgrave, who is also Commandant of the State Police force; a Director of Customs, Mr. C.C.L. de Grenier; a civil engineer, Mr. W.B. Steele. Various members of the ruling family hold Government appointments. Relat ions with Great Britain:, By treaty the foreign relations of Bahrain are controlled by the British Government and for this purpose a Political Agent has been appointed to Bahrain. He is assisted oy an Assistant Political Agent and an Indian Assistant. mnmat.P.s The Climate of Bahrain from October to the end of April is good - and during December, January and February cold. May is a warm and unpleasant month but a prelude to the ’Bareh*, a wind which blows for 40 days from the Horth-East and brings with it a pleasant interlude in the hot weather. July, August and September are hot and very humid. The temperature is seldom above 100° F. but the humidity renders the climate most trying.

(b) Fishing is mostly for personal and local consumption. Large quantities of dried fish are exported to India and other parts of the world including the United States of America for use as manure. Dried sharks fins are exported to China. (c) Agriculture is principally confined to date cultivation although successful efforts are being made to encourage the growth of vegetables and oranges for local consumption.

Visit to Bahrain Petroleum Fields. 01A / ' j s It had been arranged that transport for 40 ratings and one officer would meet the boat at Ihnamah pier. Two of the Company # s staff were at the pier according to plan with one motor truck fitted with seats. Their other truck had broken down, and so they had instructions to hire any necessary taxis for the reminder of the party. This was done and proved exceedingly popular with the ratings the seating and springing of the truck being a little Spartan. 2. The party, consisting of six cars and the truck drove out to the Fields, about 12 miles, and began an extensive tour, which will be dealt with in the order in \tfiich events occurred. 3. Buildings . First stop was at new camp under constructionT pany good well-designed buildings are being put up, and eventually the whole of the old canp offices, machine shops and living and recreation quarters will be moved here. The building is Arab fashion, but under American supervision and appears to be honest work. The Americans express themselves very satisfied with the rather peculiar Arab constructional methods. All fittings are imported from U.3.A., this includes window frames and woodwork. In accordance with American custom, the greatest attention has been paid to plumbing, and to many fittings that are considered a luxury in a house in England. All the married quarters are fitted witn large Frigidaires, automatic gas cookers and water heaters, and bathroom arrangements are superb, min drainage has been instituted. The single men have bedrooms in so-called “bunk houses’*. These are as well fitted as the married quarters, but are only sleeping accommodation, there being a central mess hall in the course of construction. 4. A club Is being built, and a talkie machine has been obtained, and it is hoped shortly to hire films from Bombay. 5. plant . Bie Terminal Station on sitrah Island is under the charge of a merchant service captain, who is also Harbour master. Captain of the Port, larine Superintendent, etc. 6. A welded, jointless pipeline runs from the wells to tfcu Terminal station where there are pumps. Thence it runs out to sea on piles for a distance of about 5000 feet, thence buoyed for a further 10,800 feet. A number of mooring and mark ouoys have been laid, which are not shown on Admiralty Charts. The results of 'Oi&amp;DNDji's' surveys were in evidenct in the office, incluaing a most useful 'Collector Tracing' Chart, a copy of which the Harbour master has promised to forward. 7. pumping can be done at the rate of 300 tons/hour. Ballast water can be taken from ships and discharged ashore, and arrangements have been made for 'skimming' oil from ballast water. a F e ^hree storage tanks of an average capacity ol 83,000 barrels each. (About 7 barrels to one ton). These tanks are of the very latest construction with a 'floating roof/- a - roof' wiaicii rises and falls with the level in the tank. They are said to reduce evaporation losses to almost nothing. Evaporation in the ordinary solid roof tank was said to be about 7J5, and to occur when the tank is 'vented', which appears to be a frequent 'routine'. The tanks, together with all other plant in the fields, were painted with aluminium paint, iiiis is believed to be a great assistance in the avoidance of evaporation, as it reduces temperature by about 20 degrees in the hot weather. 9. Communication between ship and shore is by portable R/T sets. ‘These were shown off for our benefit and appeared to be wholly admirable.. They are really portable, and have a range of 12 miles on R/T using a wavelength of 10 metres. 10. Holding ground in the anchorage is said to be excellent, and there is a depth of at least 4 feet of mud over the rock bottom. The buoys are moored with 7-ton anchors in 56 feet of water. 11. Sixteen wells have been sunk, and drilling continues^ At least three wells were being sunk at the time of the visit Both rotary and percussion drills are used, and oil is reached about 2,500 feet. The field was said to be capable of supporting 2000 wells' 12. One well is kept running very slowly to supply natural §as for cooking purposes in the camp, and others supply oil in small quantities to the small refining 'Topping' plant, where petrol is distilled for camp use. Consumption is about 600 gallons of petrol per day. 13. pro auction . There is no proauction at the moment. The staff say that they have no connection with the marketing side, and do not know the exact reason for non-proauction, out say that there is world over-production. In reply to a question, a guess was hazarded that the maximum production of the fiela was 10,000 barrels per day. 14. only one shipment has so far been made, this being in a tanker of 3,000 tons deadweight. The shipment was made to Japan, only amounts required for test being taken on to California. 'This tanker brought out large quantities of plant, also engineers and skilled labour for welding of pipeline and erection of sitrah terminal and tanks. These men returned to U.S.A. in the tanker. 15 * Entertainment. The whole party was entertained to an excellent lunch in the recreation room of the ola camo. Prohibition was not in force. ^ !6. personnel. The staff consists of about 35 white men of whom aoout half are British.

Shipping Lines, By far the largest proportion of the passenger and freight carrying service is undertaken by the British India Steam Navigation Company. This Company operates a weekly service for passengers, cargo and mails between Bombs^ and Basra, called the fast mail service. This service leaves Bombay on Thursdays and calls only at Karachi and Buahire en route. Steamers reach Basra on the following Thursdays and leave Basra on the return voyage on Saturdays or Sundays. This Company also maintains a weekly Blow mail service to the Gulf ports wnich leaves Bombay on Wednesdays and calls at all the intermediate ports on the way to Basrah i.e. Karachi, isusoat, Bandar abbas, Bahrain, Bushire, Kuwait, Khorramshahr, and wnenever cargo is available at Gwauur, yasni, Jaski)lbai etc., farticulars of freight rates and s/iling may be obtained from the Company^ office in London or their agents in Bombay • The following shipping companies maintain a regular monthly service to the Gulf ports:- trick Line, Java Lilver Pacific Line (recently inauguratedj, Nippon Yusen Laisha, Osaka Chosen Kaisha, Yamasnita Line, and Mitsui Bussan k&amp;isha. The Italian Lloyd Triestino Company also sends an occasional steamer to the Gulf whenever sufficient cargo offers. Greek steamers also now and again make an appearance in the Gulf. The H&amp;nsa Line (German) maintains a direct fort nightly service from Bremen, Hamburg, Antwerp and Rotterdam to the Gulf ports, and one direct sailings every 20 days from the Gulf to European ports. air Services. The Gulf ports are well catered for in this respect. Imperial Airways operate a weekly service on the Lrab side of the Gulf in connection with the Australia service which calls at Kuwait, Bahrain, Sharjah and also Gwadur. On the Iranian side the K.L.i.i. (Butch) Lines maintain a bi-weekly service in both directions in connection with which calls at Jask with an optional landing at Bushire, their Amsterdam-Batavia Service/ whilst the air France also maintains a weekly service in connection with their service to Indo&lt;»China, which calls at Bushire. hanks.

Weather. In summer the climate of the Gulf area is hot and very trying. It varies in different localities buti ■ r Bushire may be said to be the least unpleasant climati- eally. The humidity all over the Gulf is hi#i especially at Bahrain and Bandar Abbas. The best season for visitors is the autumn and spring during which time the climate is to 1 era ole and ordinary English clothing may safely be worn.. f. A Report on fch* ^eonomio Gonditiona in the jpersian Gulf* December. 19^6. II. SURYi«;Y O F TRAPK ARP fAuDIDG G0DDlTI0£i3&gt; Conaitions of trade during the preTious twelve months varied greatly on t*u both sides of the Gulf, whereas on the Iranian side the situation was one of unrelieved dete rioration the ^rab side has been showing distinct signs of re turning o^ prosperity - as i£ reileoted in the trade returns, fhe brightest spot seems to be Bahrain where the increasing production of the Bahrain Petroleum Jompany has resulted in a greater influx of foreign money and more employment for the local population. Kuwait is another centre which seems to be awakening from the long continued trade depression. Both imports and exports are on the up grade and there is a good chance of this trend becoming permanent. A great fillip in this direction will be given if the oil boring operations now in progress prove successful. On the Iranian side however there is a different tale to tell. Hero the contrast is great. Whereas trade on the Arab side is unrestricted and customs duties are low exporters to Iran have to contend with exchange control, import permits, hi#i import duties, quotas, prohibitions and the monopolisation by the CfOvemment of an ever increasing range of goods freely imported in previous years. To these must be aaded tea, motor cars, lorries and their spare parts, the import of which has now been declared a (Government monopoly. Freedom of trade has given way to a considerable extent to Darter arrangements. i?he Soviet Union concluded a treaty with Iran in 19db under which the former sent sugar, matches, piece goods etoetra in exchange for wool, sxins etoetra. Likewise Germany has made a clearing arrangement with Iran under which the need for foreign exchange is eliminated. This has given Germany a privilegedposition as compared with most other countries. Japan continues to dominate the markets on both sides of the Gulf in piece goods and has made considerable inroads into the trade^ of other countries in suoh lines as cement, crockery, glassware, tea, gramophones, bicycles Ltoetra. This is solely a question of price and quality does not enter into it. fhis being so it is extremely unlikely that any other country can oust Japan from this predominant position so long as buyers consider price and ignor quality. Import from ^United kingdom hare generally speaking been maintained at their deminished total during as compared with the previous ye&amp;rjl. There is howerer little chance in present conditions for any considerable improvement in United Kingdom exports to the Gulf so long as price remains the orerriding eonsideration in the mind of the buyer. Consumers on the whole are too poor to pay the difference in price between United Kingdom goods and those of other countries. On the other hand if prosperity returns to the Gulf countries, as it is already snowing signs of doing on the Arab side, United Kingdom exporters may reasonably a expect to obtain larger share of an increased total trade turnover, seeing tnat the people of these lands are fully alive to the superior quality of United Kingdom goods. Direct Imports from India are decreasing. Whereas India formerly supplied a large proportion of the imports pf piece goods she has been supplanted by Japan in this line, moreover the import of cotton yams which mostly came from India is now prohibited. Imports of tea come mostly from India but there is strong competition in this line from the Dutch and Japanese. The latter however were not very successful in txylng to enter the market in Bahrain. Although Japanese tea was on sale there at seven annas per pound as opposed to eleven annas tor Indian t.a, it did not appeal to theIII. J3U3UIH . general. buaiiire is the principal port on the Iranian aide of the gulf. It has however lost the importance it onoe possessed as an importing centre owing chiefly to the rival claims of Khorramshahr (formerly ilohammerah) where better facilities for loading and unloading exist. Landing facilities. These are still primitive and quite inadequate. Goods have to be brought in by dhows from ships anchored several miles from the shore. This often leads to damage to the goods either when being unloaded from the ships themselves or when discharged on the quayside from the dhows. Matters may however improve on this respect now that a new 7 ton electric crane has been installed on the Customs jetty to replace the present hand operated crane. Transport. Communication with the interior are still effected by means of a road connecting Suahire with Shiraz and beyond. This road is a difficult mountainous one and moreover has to cross the low lying strip of land which connects the island of Bushire to Iran proper. This section is liable to floods , in winter and communications are thus often interrupted. Howsver work is to begin in the spring on the construction of an all-weather motor road to overcome this drawback. During such times of to. flood recourse is had to the time honoured donkey as a means of looomotion. Hates of freight transport/lorry between Bushire and Shiraz averaged 60 rials per kharvar and by direct lorry from Bushire to Tehran 300 rials per kharvar during the past twelve months. The population of Bushire and hinterland is reckoned to be in the neighbourhood of 2b,000 to 28,000. The climate is hot and damp in summer and malaria is prevalent.Trading conditions are steadily going from bad to worse chiefly owing to Governmental action. The trade monopolies, control of foreign exchange, quotas, high import duties and prohibitions all combine to render the lot of the private trader a hard one. ’Sushire merchants are therefore confining their activities more and more to purely forwarding business. The chaoter conditions in the custom’s warehouses where the congestion is acute also add to the worries and difficulties of importers. Until this year merchants have found conditions in the tx. import trade fairly good and have exported gum, sicins, almonds eteetra,but now that these exports have been or will shortly be confined to monopoly concerns Bushlre merchants have lost their last source of profit. They are consequently showing a tendency to invest their funds in such monopolies both to safeguard themselves and also to obtain a better return on their capital. The high cost of imported goods places them almost beyond the reach of the local population which manages to efce out a precarious living from casual employment. Their lot will however be to some extent alleviated when the projected cotton spinning and weaving mill takes definite snape. Opium shipments for the period January-November 1936 amounted to 1037 cases most of which went to the Kar j^ast. This compares with a total of 2,668 oases for the preceding 12 months. The reason for the decline appears to be the high cost of the opium rather than lessened demand. The Government is said to be considering the abolition of the export tax in order to encourage larger sales. Imports. These amounted to 60^ million rials in 1934/36 compared with 78 million rials in 193%&gt;-34. During the period Januaxy-October 1936 there were imported 73,168 packages of sugar (crystal and loaf); piece goods 6,178 packages, matches 2,015 packages, cement 26,115 packages, tea 18,404 packages, general merchandise 30,049 packages, I'hese figures show a large increase over those for 1933 in the case of cement,tea k and general merchandise but nearly all of it is in transit through Bushire. ; xport $ In 1934-35 these amounted to 44 f million rials being practically the same as in 1933-34, raring the period January-October 1936, there were exported 1,764 bales of tobacco; 13,294 packages of gum tragacanth; 1,529 bundles of carpets; 1,615 packages of skins, fhese figures compared with those for 1935 do not show any appreciable change except as regards tobacco of which there was no export through Bush ire in 1935. I?. KHORRAMSHAHR. General. Situated in the Shatt-ul-krab at the head of the Persian Gulf Khorramshahr (lately ;«oh amine rah) has become the chief port of Iran. It is important as a distributing centre from which the bulk of imports are forwarded into the interior. Steamers are unable to come alongside the jetty but discharge cargo into barges which convey it ashore• Transport. In wet eather only river transport is possible. In dry- weather motor transport has replaced animal transport except for short distances, average rates for transport between Khorramsnanr and the inland town of ahwaz during the year were j river (24-36 hours) 20-25 rials per ton; motor transport (6-7 hours) 30-120 rials per ton. Imports &amp; Exports, Imports in 1934-35 amounted to about 123 million rialsin valuo, compared witn nearly 164 million in 19&amp;&gt;-64« exports amounted to 21 million rials in 19£4-£6 compared with over 40 million in 19££«£4. Japanese goods still dominate the market, tney consist mostly of piece goods, toys, bicycles, clocks, glassware, cement, chinaware and enamelware* Price is the only obstacle to the sale of United Kingdom goods. The only Soviet Union imports during the year were some box-boards and matches. Other chief imports are tea from India, sugar from Belgium, building materials from the United Kingdom and Belgium. \r• AmAS. General• The importance of Bandar abbas as a distributing centre for the interior towns of Kerman, Yesd etc., has much diminished in recent years largely owing to raxtrlstiam restrictive policy of the Iranian Government. Transport. Bandar Abbas is connected with Kerman by a motor road constructed a few years ago. It is liable to be blocked in winter from time to time by landslides caused by rain. Average transport rate between Bandar Abbas and Kerman during 193b-36 was 80-100 rials per kharvar by motor lorry and 60-80 rials per kharvar by donkey or camel. Trading conditions. Imports for 193b-26 amounting to 16,224,122 rupees were less by fffmr million rials compared with the preceding year due to restrictions and embargo on the chief items of import i.e. piece goods, twists and yarn and also to high import duties payable on luxury articles such as toilet requisites, perfumes, wines and spirits. Tne total volume of trade for the whole district (Bandar Abbas, Charbar, Jask, Klshm Island, Xhamir and Tiab) aggregated 26,491,212- 1 ~ riala in 19ib-»6 as against 24,827,671 rial* for th* pr*Tiouo year. Japanese goods predominate in the local maricet bat they have declined by about 60yt&gt; compared with the ligurea for the year 1934-35 due chiefly to local production and diminished purchasing power of the people. Imports from India have also declined considerably for the same reason. Large quantities of piece goods are however smuggled into the countiy from ^ i^rab coast, itoreover owing to high import duty imports of luxury articles suoh as Japanese crockery, Dioyoles, gramophone and electrical goods have declined. Soviet Union imports have been restricted to sugar and matches. Exports allow a large increase for the period under review; they amounted to 10,167,090 rials. Larger exports were made of red oxide from the mines at Eormoz which were 10,161 tons in 1936-36 representing an increase of 3,561 tons over the previous twelve months. Of this amount more than 7000 tons were shipped to the United Kingdom. (There were also increaed exports of almonds and dates.

The chief and largest of these islands, called Manama, is about £0 miles long by 10 miles wide; the second largest, M&amp;harrag, has an area of about 5 miles. On this latter island is situated the Imperial Airways aerodrome. The islands are ruled by an arab Shaikh in special treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government ana the Government of India who are represented by a Political agent. Cultivation of the soil is rare owing to a scarcity of water. The bulk of the population earn a livelihood as petty traders and meronants, pearl divers and employees of the Bahrain Petroleum Company.($&lt;) - 16 - Landing facilities« Like ail the other ports in the Persian Gulf ships hare to disoharge their cargoes a few miles from the snore into dhows owing to tne shallow water, uharres are primitive and in rough weather goods are very liaole to damage during actual unloading operations or from salt water. Transport . The roads of the island are fairly good and motor oars and light lorries use them freely. Donkeys and camels are however still used for carrying goods for snort distances, especially in the town itself, owing to the oheapness of this method of transport. The number of oars is steadily increasing. There are now about 200 oars and 2b lorries in use of which 90&amp; are of United States of iuaerioa manu facture. Climate and population. afos tamg fau c tffr __ The olimate of Bahrain in the summer (May-october) is very hot, humid and unpleasant. The permanant population of the islands is estimated at about 120,000. Customs Tariff. This is fixed by treaty at b per cent ad valorem on general merchandise, 10 i &gt; on certain articles of luxury and lb^ on Alcohol, tobacco and cigarettes. Transit dues on goods landed at Bahrain for the mainland have been reduced from 2&gt;9 to l|&gt;o, and an export duty of ten rupees per bundle of hides and tw rupees per basket of dates is charged. The Customs Department is oo at rolled by a European Director under the oraers of the Ruler of Bahrain. State of Trad e. The pearl Industiy , on which the majority of the inhabitants used to depend, is still depressed, although exports for 1935-26 were somewhat better than those for 1934-5. The elfeots of the depression are, however, beingsubstantially affaet by the aotiTities of tbe SflUirain Petroleum Company, which, as well as paying large sums in wages makes considerable purchases locally. In addition, an appreciable part of the sum paid in royalties is spent locally at this source of purchasing power is likely to increase. i'hese factors are reflected in the Customs statistics summarised below. It will be noticed that the figures for 1926-26 are higher than those for 1924-6 by Rupees 7,066,460 or about 44&gt;. Imports. sports. 1934T5T' 1^35-26• 1934-6. 1955-6.

Figures are in tiupees and do not include exports of oil nor imports of working equipment for the Bahrain Petroleum Company. Exports. Oil has now replaced pearls as the most important coniaodity exported. Other articles exported are, wood fuel, rope, hides and skins, dried fish, dates etoetra. fhe importance of the entrepot trade with the mainland and the value of Bahrain as a port of entry for the markets of 3a f udi Arabia is brought out by the fact that in 19&amp;4-5 4b.97;i and in 1956-6. 52.31^ of the merchandise imports into Bahrain were re-exported; the bulk of the re-exports were for Ba'udi Arabia. Imports. fhe growing value of the Bahrain market is shown by the increase of Rupees 3,902,220 in 1936-6 over the 1934«6 merchandise imports representing 41.61 per oent.

It will be seen tnat in the course of three years Japan has more than doubled her imports and that approxi mately a quarter of the increase in merchandise imports between 1934-36 and 1936-36 was taxen by Japan. Ihe beginning of recoveiy in the United iCingdom trade is, however, encouraging. Prospects for United Kingdom trad e. Although in many lines the comparatise dearness of British goods is a standing source of difficulty it should be possible, especially now that some measure of prosperity is returning to Bahrain, for United Kingdom manufacturers to expand their trade in this market. United Kingdom goods have on the whole a hi#i refutation for quality and it is opportune that experience of cheap goods appears to be teaching the lesson that cheapness for its own sake does not always pay especially when more money is becoming available for the purchase of more durable goods. Cotton goods are the principal United Kingdom import and in 1936-b amounted to Rupees 314,880 or 16$ of the market* as against Rupees 158,940 and 9.6^&gt; in the previous year, fhere is a demand lor white cambric, white shirtings black sateen, printed veils, light and dark shawls, black lenos, black net, mulls and various fancy lines. Tinned foods are an important United Kingdom import.19 and the item 'other provisionswhich is oomposed largely of tinned goods was the second highest United ingdom import in 1935-6• United Kingdom,foods enjoy a strong position in this market, although there is some Kaapattaw competition from foreign countries, especially United States of America* Hardware and cutlery is another line in which the United Kingdom has been obtaining some share; imports in 1935-6 were worth Rupees 39,180 or about 6&gt;? of the market and in the previous year 47,190 representing 10$. In the June quarter of 1936, however, the percentage of Uni tea Kingdom imports rose to 13$. United Kingdom imports of woollen goods are small but appear to be on the increase; 193o-6 imports were valued at Rupees 20,000 or 18.8$ of the market, compared with Rupees 7,420 and 7.2$ in 1934-5. Imports for the June quarter of 1936 amounted to 5.6$ of the whole. Cement is a commodity in wnich the high cost of United Kingdom supplies has led to a considerable decline in sales, mostly in favour of Japan; trie extent of the fall is shown in the following table ;- There is a considerable market in cigarettes, drugs, and medicines; other lines in which United Kingdom goods hold a portion of the market are:- bicycles, marine engines, haberdashery and hosiery, hides and skins, dyes and colours, oils, china and glassware, twist and yarn, soap, perfumes, sparking plugs, wireless sets,tooIs and electrical equipments. Imports from United Kingdom. 1934. 17,100 bags - 38$ of total 1935. 7,059 ' - 29$ * 1935 1936. 2,560 ' (Jan-June) Of the other imports a large proportion consists of/wo) essential ooiomodities suod as rise, wheat, sugar, tea, coffee and wood. Of these sugar is the only line in which the united Kingdom could compete successfully and although no United Kingdom sugar has been sold since 1954 it should! be possible to do business again. m&amp; value of imports of auga- * * On the whole merchants prefer to obtain their United Kingdom imports direct from the manufacturers. in many cases it mi&amp;it lead to an increase in business if the method oi pain.iul delivery against proportionate payment coula be employed, as this would be of great assistance to those wno do not like to lock up too much capital at a time. Kuwait is an independant Arab Sheikhdom whose relations with His 2 ajesty *g Government and the Government of India are regulated by treaty, and who are represented by a by Ira&lt;i, on the south and west by 3a f udi Arabia and population is estimated to be roughly 60,000 in the town itself and about 20,000 members of nomad tribes. Kuwait produces no foodstuffs of her own so that all her requirements in this respect have to be imported - mostly from India. Moreover, large quantities of foodstuff are also imported for use in neighbouring states and to support the Bedouin tribes of Arabia and Iraq, method$of business• m.KUwAI! General Political Agent.

These showed a distinct increase compared with the preceding twelve months but nevertheless conditions in general remained depressed. The plight of the pearling icdustiy is mainly responsible for this depression and V until this industry recovers or an alternative industry is introduced such as the development of oil eonoesBiou no permanent improvement is to be looked for fetal imports by sea in 1926-56 amounted to 4,916,047 rupees or an increase of ld.3^ 9 as comparedVIII. - 22 - m ■ with the i^iguz'ee for Of these imports only &amp;o earn© from the United Kingdom; almost one half i.e. 4&amp;.2;&amp; oame from India and 9.2^ from Japan. The percentage given India however included much Japanese merchandise transhipped in Bombay for the Ouif ports. The Japanese percentage of total imports is therefore much higher than tne figure of 9.2$ given for direct imports from Japan. The principal articles of import^ are, rice, sugar, tea and flour from India, piece goods, matches, hardware and miscellaneous articles from Japan, wheat, barley,dates etc., from Iraq. Japanese tea has now appeared in the market for the first time and seems likely to make serious inroads into India*s hitherto predominant position on account of being cheaper than Indian tea. The United Kingdom sent hardware and glassware for the first time to the value of 33,37 5 rupees which however represents only about 5$ of the whole. There is thus room for consi derable expansion in this line. i ! he same remark applies to matches of which only about 6$ of the total imports oame from the United Kingdom. Other imports are scents and penumes, cigarettes, earthenware electrical household apparatus. as regards exports. These amounted to 1,421,840 rupees in 1935-36 being an increase of 15.4$ compared with l934*5. These consist mainly of pearls, specie and bullion silver. ifiJSCAT. General. Muscat is the capital of the Independant Sultanate of that name situated on the east coast of Arabia. The seaboard of the .^ultanate extends in the north from Tibat on the western shore of the Musandum Peninsula to Has Dharbat Ali in the south situated about 290 miles from Socotra Island. Inland the Sultanate extends to the borders of the Great- 23 - Desert.

Muscat however still continues to be the seat of Government and the capital town. fhe population of Musoat and Matrah is estimated at 4,LOG and 8,500 respectively. ihere is a fairly large Indian trading community at ^atran.

Customs duties on wx imports are at present 5% ad valorem on foodstuff - and general merchandise; 10$ on certain goods classified as luxuries and 20$ on liquors containing alcohol 55 deg. under proof or more. Ko duty is levied on exports but an octroi duty of is payable on goods from the interior. Currency. The currency of the oountiy is the iaria Theresa dollar. This is the only currency accepted in the interior but in Muscat and Matrah English sovereigns, Indian currency notes and xupees are also in use. The dollar is liable tofluctuations caused by the world price of silYer, local demand in the date season etc., The average exchange rate in 193&amp;-1936 was 132 rupees for 100 Maria Theresa dollars. There are no fcanits and business is effected on the basis of drafts on India. Transport. Transport between the coastal towns is still carried out by sailing vessels and is the cheapest means of conve yance. light cars can run about 230 miles up the Batin&amp;h coast to Kalba but owing to lacic of proper roads loriy transport is not feasible.

Although the total value of exports was considerably greater than in 1934-5 the commercial position was in point of fact worse. The rise in exports was caused by the abnor mal export of Maria Theresa collars to the value of 786,042 rupees and specie and silver krans to the value of 112,400 rupees, brought about by the appreciation of these coins in terms of rupees.
