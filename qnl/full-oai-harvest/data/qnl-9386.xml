The Political Resident confirms in a letter dated 23 January 1940 that all Hasa oil that was imported for refining in Bahrain was bought by the Bahrain Petroleum Company (BAPCO) from the California Arabian Standard Oil Company (CASOC). This, in the opinion of British officials, would facilitate the commandeering of oil if necessary (folio 3)The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival item</genre><subject><geographic>Hasa</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Emergency Planning</topic></subject><subject><topic>Oil</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001ed#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
