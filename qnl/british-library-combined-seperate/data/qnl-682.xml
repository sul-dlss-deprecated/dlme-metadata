Foliation starts with the first folio and runs to the last folio. Folio 1 is split into four parts (1, 1A, 1B and 1C), folio 157 into two parts (157A and 157B), folio 206 into two parts (206A and 206B) and 229 into three parts (229A, 229B and 229C). The foliation is written in pencil, circled and positioned in the top right hand corner of the recto side (with the exception of 229B and 229C) which are numbered on the top left hand side in arabic language fashion).A secondary foliation system, also written in pencil but not circled, starts on folio 3. This system skips folios and sometimes labels a single folio as multpile folios, so it moves in and out of sync with the primary system.Folios 229B and 229C are a newsprint insert contained within an envelope which has been attached to folio 229A.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This file contains correspondence concerning relations between Bahrain and other foreign powers, primarily Persia.The correspondence discusses the following topics:Agitation in the Persian press regarding the alleged oppression of Persians in Bahrain.
