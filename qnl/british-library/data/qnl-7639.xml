Seem d son of late Darab Khan, libegi of Qashqai at one time, by a father left a very small patrimony to be divided among five sons ; and when Soulat-ud-Oouleh first became Ilbegi 1900 he possessed nothing but 6 camels* 2 mules and bought a horse on pledge for 100 Tumans. He had sold the rent of his one village of Ab-i Garm in Qir and Karzin for 700 Tumans p. a. to pay his debts. His elder brother, the late Abdullah Khan, Zargham-ud- Douleh, had become Ilkhani in 1898, and through additions to a Earman forged by one of his scribes laid claim to and took possession of many villages in the Simirum district of northern Ears, in the Eiruzabad district, and in Qir and Karzin in southern Ears.

After rallying of K hams eh tribes to Qawami family, aod flight and deposition of Nizara-us-Sultaneh, he lest the Ilkhaniship which was held by ZaighaDi-ud-Douieii till October 1912, when Soulat-ud-Douhh was re-appointed by Mukhbir-us-Sultaneb, the Governor-General. His men attack ed 8 wedish Gendarmerie at Kara^agach riyer in 1913, when Major Siefvert was wounded. On outbreak of war showed considerable sympathy with Germans, with whom he remained in correspondence. The Indian agitator Amba Farshad had been harboured by him for some time. In 1916 opposed appointment of Farman Farma as Governor-Ger era 1, and combined with Qawam-ul-MulK, both entering Shiraz. At first on correct terms with Uolonel Gough and General Sykes, with the latter of whom lie had an arrangement for policing the upper part of the Kazerun road ; but in I ’lS on a fracas taking place between S. P* R men and the Darehshuri tribe, he summoned all his following, joined the Kazeruni attack on the S, P. R. posts, and attempted to beleaguer the Headquarters S. P. R. in Shiraz itself. He fought a detachment near Chanar Rahdar, cut off the supplies of water, fired into the cantonment and European gardens. At the same time an attempt was made by his full-brother Soulat-us-Sultaneh to rush the S. P. R. troops in Abadeh. In July 1918, Farman Farma, Governor General, nominated Sardar Ihtisham as Ilkhani, and the latter’s full-brother, Ali Khan, as Ilbegi, the Qashqai tribesmen split into factions, Soulat-ud-Douleh retreated south, was pursued by a column of Indian troops, and suffered a serious defeat near Firuzabad ^November 1918, when many Qashqai were killed and influenza completed his rout. Subsequently he remained for two years in retirement in Qir and Karzin, not daring to move wuh the migration. In 1919 when British influence was at its height, negotiations took place with Farman Farma for either the despatch of Soulat-ud-Douleh to Tehran or to Muhammerah, or the payment of a guarantee. In the end £10,000 were deposited by him in the name of the Consulate at Shiraz with the Imperial Bank for 2 years, on condition that his eldest son remained a hostage in Shiraz, that he did not interfere with Sardar Ihtisham’s rule of the tribe or property or otherwise intrigue. In November 1920 the new Governor-General, Musaddiq-us-Sultaneh, a demagogue, on the counsels of Nasir-ul-Mulk arranged a meeting between Soulat-ud-Douleh, his half-brother, and Qawam-ul-Mulk in Shiraz, when the government of the tribe was handed over to Soulat-ud-Douleh’s eldest son as Ilkhani, and to Sardar Ihtisham’s second son as Ilbegi, to act jointly. Within a month Soulat-ud- Douleh had chased his nephew from the tribe, and since then has remained the real, though not nominal, chief power in the tribe 2,000 tents of the Dareh shuri clan and the Kashkulis refused to submit to him. On the Sayyid Zia-ud- Din coup d’etat, and the appointment of Prince Nusrat-us-Sultaneh as Gov ernor-General both of whom were for his arrest, his position again became shaky. The Prince supported Qa^am-ul-Mulk and Sardar Ihtisham, even paying a subsidy to the latter’s brother, Ali Khan. Operations against him were contemplated by the S. P. R. in the spring of 1921, but were proposed too late in the migration: he consented to pay 11,000 Tumans taxes, so great was his alarm. By the autumn, with the disbandment of the S. P. R. the position entirely changed. Widespread looting by Qashqai on the Isfahan road, and in southern Fars provoked a vehement and general demand for his suppression, especially from the Qawami landowners and Mullas, the chief sufferers. In September 1921, however, he had despatched an emissary with presents of money to Tehran, and contrived to win the support of the Cabinet particularly of the Minister of War: and Sardar Sipah opposed his removal from control of the tribe. He took umbrage at an agreement between the Kashkuli Khans and the A. P. O. C. in October 1921, and did his best to stir up the central government to upset the agreement.

Through out 1921 and the first half of 1922 on very strained terms with Soulat-ud- Douleh, owing to raids at the latter’s instructions on his family properties, and to his own support of Qashqai chiefs opposed to Soulat-ud-Douleh. During 1922 lost influence owing to support given by Minister of war to latter, and compelled by G. O. C. of Southern Division and special officers sent from Tehran to meet Soulat-ud-Douleh for a nominal ‘reconciliation’ in August 1922. In 1923 much worried by the attitude adopted towards him by the military and their ultimate intentions : handed over to them guns entrusted by British Government to his father, and entered his elder son in cavalry at Shiraz to mollify them. Went to see the Minister for War at Isfahan in August, and Sardar Sipah expressed wish that he should reside in Tehran. September 1923 had himself elected as Deputy for his Khamseh tribes in order to counteract influence of Soulat-ud-Douleh and afford himself a special status vis-a-vis his enemies in Tehran and the Minister for War.

Knows English fairly well. A pleasant personality, but lacks good advisers and staff-officers: and also sufficiently powerful friends in political circles at Tehran. The mainsprings of his policy are rivalry and the old blood-feud with the family of Qashqai llkhani; and to maintain his prestigeand influence in Fars and among the Khamseh tribes. In lands, wealth, and consolidation of authority he far surpasses his father and grandfather : and is more generally supported and respected by clerical and other bodies in Shiraz. 163.

From 1907 till 1918 obtained large income from * rahdari ’ and ‘ alafi' levied on caravans at various points in his district. Always an astute and crafty politician, with friends in high places, he seized the excuse of the capture at British instance, and subsequent escape of the German Wassmuss in March 1915 , to throw in his lot with the ‘nationalists’in Shiraz and the Anglo- phobe chiefs of Chahkutah and Tangistan.

Early in 1921 he quarrelled with his old ally, Isur Muhammad Khan of Dalikl and was privy to the request of the Governor of Dashtistan for the S. P. B. to attack Daliki, resulting m the deaths of the Haliki chiefs. Co-operated for a time in 3921-22 with his cousin and rival Aqa Khan while the latter was in charge of Daliki: but Mirza Muhammad Khan s interference in affairs of the Zira district led to a quarrel, and he was partly responsible for Aqa Khan being ousted from Daliki in autumn 1922. Aqa Khan in 1923, with the support of Shaikh Muhammad Chahkutahi and news paper editors in Shiraz, and by getting up complaints in Buraz]un against Mrrza Muhammad Khan, and finally by bidding a far higher sum m payment of taxes, succeeded in October 3923 in causing the Finance Department to assume direct collection of taxes, and summon both Khans to Shiraz, whence Mirza Muhammad Khan tried to escape to Tehran, but was brought back and imprisoned November 1923.

Prom 1906 to the outbreak of war in 1914 was with his brothers and father, on friendly terms with the Besidency in Bushire and members of the staff, with whom visits frequently exchanged. Shaikh Husian often sought the good offices of the Besidency in his difficulties with the Governors of the Ports. During those years the Chahkutahi Shaikhs were constantly engaged in their long-standing blood-feud with the neighbouring Angali district, and on bad terms with Zair Khidhar of Tangistan : they were also engaged in smuggling arms and tea through the Tangistan ports. The late Shaikh Husain, whose race was Dumukh-Arabs of the Dawasir tribe from the Arab trucial coast—and whose father had changed his Sunni faith for the Shiah, was a man of violent and bloodthirsty character, who had killed two of his own half-brothers in a quarrel for division of lands and villages, and sought to remove a third brother, Shaikh Abdullah, who survives attempts made against him (the last by poisoning in coffee in 1922). He made a pilgrimage to Karbala in 1913, and returned more fanatical than before. On the removal of the German Consul and residents at Bushire in March 1915 by British troops he professed indignation at the breach of Persian neutrality and his determination to obtain reparation. In this course he was incited by officers of the (Swedish) Gendarmerie and, forgetting his long rela tions with the British, welcomed Wassmuss and other German emissaries, and became the leader of the anti-British movement in concert with Zair Khidhar of Tangistan and the Zabit of Burazjun. After the occupation of Bushire by British troops in August 1915 he declared open war against the British and Bushire, and night after night parties of Chahkutahis, generally led by Shaikh Muhammad or other of his sons, passed the barbed-wire entanglements, raided the British posts and private residences, killing sentries and carrying off prisoners : Shaikh Muhammad in person attacked the Bussian Consulate- General on the sea-shore on one occasion. On September 9th, 1915, Shaikh Husain led an attack by 400 tribesmen aginst the British troops, and' retired after losing his second son, Shaikh Abdul Husain and some 40 others killed.

In May 1920 Shaikh Husain came down to the plain of Tangistan with the intent of re-occupying his family district of Chahkutah, when he was attacked at Tul-i-Ashki by a small detachment of the S. P. R. under Captain Munn, and killed in the fight. His fifth son Khaza’l was taken prisoner and killed by the Angali irregular tribesmen co-operating with the S. P. R. In April 1921 the Governor of the Gulf Ports, Mas’ud-us-Sultan (q. v.) chiefly for monetary reasons allowed Shaikh Muhammad to return to Ahmadi, and turned out Abbas Quli Khan Angali. Since the departure of the S. P. R. in October 1921, Shaikh Muhammad has sought in various ways to make himself objectionable in revenge both to the British in Bushire, and the Angali and other pro-British Khans of 1915-21. With this object he has entered into close alliance of interests with Mirza Ali Kazaruni, the deputy to the Majlis in Tehran and his son Mirza Abdur Rahman in Bushire : and by correspondence with the news paper editors of Shiraz and Tehran makes great play of his xenophobia, and the services in the 4 nationalist ’ cause of his father and family. In 1923 he caused the remains of his father and brother Khaz’al to be re-buried, under a special edifice at Imamzadeh on Bushire island, the occasion being given a £ nationalist ’ complexion. On the assassination of his father’s ally Zair Khidhar of Tangistan in April 1923 he made a great show of co-operating with the Government troops against the murderers. Latterly, in the guise of leader of the extreme 4 nationalists ’ he has begun to interfere more and more in the affairs of the Bushire Governorship and Dashtistan, in order to acquire influence : and in 1923 summer, offered in the papers his help to the army to suppress the Anglophile Khans.
