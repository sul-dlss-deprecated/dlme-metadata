IQ ©7 Bakhah was originally a home of the Shihuh who ruled it until the time of Shaikh Salim bin Sultan al ^asimi (circa 1880), Shaikh of Has al Khaimah, who seized it and appointed Shaikh Sulaiman, grandfather of the present Shaikh, as his Wall at Bakhah. During/Sulairaan's time the Shaikh of Khasab attacked Bakhah, and when the Wall of Bakhah appealed to the Shaikh of Kas al K-haimqh for help in repelling the invaders he refused to provide any and gave as his reason the fact that he was prohibited \ by his treaty obligations with the British from despatching an expedition by sea. Later Shaikh Sulaiman succeeded in repelling the attacks from Khasab by his own efforts and his power gradually gained in strength. Eventually, he himself attacked and plundered Ras al Khaimah. After this the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah abandoned all claims to Bakhah, which has since descended from father to son in the same family. 2. The present Shaikh is Muhammad bin Ahmad bin Sulaiman, Shihhi. He is about fifty years old. He appears to be a straightforward man and to be respected by his people whom he does not oppress unduly. He is married into the Dubai ¥ family, and his wife is the sister-in-law of Shaikh Said bin Maktum of Dubai. He complains that his brother-in-law does not co-operate with him, and attributes this attitude to the ill-advice of his son Rashid. * He owns ten country- craft (four big and six small) which ply between India, East Africa and the Gulf ports. 3. Ihe Shaikh claims that Bakhah consists of six inhabited coastal villages, namely Bakhah, Al Jadi and Al Jari, (north of Bakhah), Teebat, Ghamdha and Fadhgha (Sou^h of Bakhah) together with some deserted villages on the coast and in the • • • •i page 2. &lt;£&gt; and in the mountains I Q tf) The northern limit he claims is rtas al Jari and the southern Ras al Sha'am and part of oha'am village. In fact, he has no authority in Sha'am and the head-land is the natural boundary in that direction which is, incidentally, the end of the motor road from Ras al Khaimah, 4. The inhabitants of Bakhah are Arabs (Shihuh), and Persians who live mostly by fishing and trading. There is one Hindu. The whole population is estimated at 5,000, and it receives its food supplies from Dubai through the bharjah Agency in the same way as the Trucial Coast ohaikhdoms. The Shaikh charges neither customs duty nor anchorage fees on boats calling at his port which is not an open anchorage. 5. The Shaikhdom is independent and pays tribute to nobody. The Shaikh mentioned that though he had been to Muscat to pay his respects to the Sultan, he owed him no allegiance and preferred the protection of the British by whom he wished to be considered independent.
