I think that as on many maps the Trucial Coast is shown as 'Trucial Chian' the application to land at Sharjah was included in the application to fly over Oman, to which the Sultan probably gave a general consent. The point can only be cleared up by reference to the Sultan, and I do not think it is of sufficient importance to call for this. I am sending copies of this letter to Hay and TSTatts. \ * ^ H. T.

These requests are entirely from French nationals and are submitted to the Foreign Office on their behalf by the French Embassy in London. One of these requests is for a flight of two French military planes. These requests are then forwarded to the India Office for comment, and occasional reference is made to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. It is noted that such requests have increased due to a recent diplomatic rupture between France and Iran.Letters from the French Embassy are in French.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
