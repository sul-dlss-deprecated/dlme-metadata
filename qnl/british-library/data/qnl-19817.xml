The Honourable the Political Resident ~ ^ ^ i b Sir, in the Persian u ulf Bushire Bibai - Shaikh Sa ! id bin wiaktum and his wicked cousins. I I' fin ' Cm J e lVIW I have the honour ko refer to the correspondence ending with my telegram N 0 :T/6 elated the 3rd H ovem b e r 1934 and to inform you that on the 30th October 1934 I proceeded by air to Sharjah, where I embarked in H.M.S Lupin (Commander T.H.Back) reaching Bibai on the same evening. 2. On the morning of the 31st October Shaikh Sa f id bin Maktum, Ruler of Bibai, came on board to call upon me and explained the situation, which was briefly as follows. For some years Shaikh Sa f id has had trouble with his cousins, the sons of the late Shaikhs Rashid and Buti (see the Genealogical Table in Pocket 4 of Volume III of the Gazetteer of the Persian ^ulf by Lorimer, of which an extract is attached for ease of reference)• Lately they have become more arrogant in their behaviour towards him and have indulged in violence and looting in Bibai. On the 23rd September 1934 they attempted his life and proposed, on his return from a visit to *Ain Khamir, to hold a meeting to depose him. Shaikh Sa»id said that he proposed to demand that his cousins should come to his house and /swear Sc )2 . swear that they would obey his rule and cease from troubling the people. To this end he proposed to hold a roseting of the A1 bu Falasah after my return call and that, if a suitable settlement was reached, the Commanding Officer, H.M.S Lupin, and I should be present at a meeting on the follov;ing day (November 1st) when an oath would be taken by the cousins. During this call I made it clear to the Shaikh and to his brothers and son, who accompanied him, that this quarrel was an internal affair, with which he, as Ruler, nnst deal and emphasised that in his own interests it was important that he and not the British Government should settle with his cousins; and that H.M.S Lupin was at Dibai to see that British lives and property were adequately safeguarded. He appreciated the positim and was evidently grateful for the measure of support which was given by the presence of the Sloop, the appearance of the V/apitis and the promised present of rifles, which, while not committing Government to internal interference, encouraged him to take steps to rule his Sheikhdom. I also emphasised that he must arrange for the protection of the Indian community and their property and of the office of the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation limited. My return call was brief and no business was discussed, but there were present four Shaikhs of the A1 bu Sha ! ar section of the Manasir, headed by Shaikh Ghanam bin Yaraiyo, who had, I believe, some thirty followers in the Shaikh^ house. B. I will not trouble you with the details of the negotiations, which were conducted without any interference from me by the A1 bu Falasah and a prominent local figure named Muhammad bin Anmad., and entailed the usual curious comings and goings of Arab diplomacy. A critical time was the night of the 31st October/lst /November3. November, as Shaikh Sa ! id had given an ultimatum to his cousins that they should come to his house by midday on the 1st November or be turned out of Dibai, and he had brought in a number of bedouin (Mhnasir) to assist him. There was considerable excite ment and at any time open hostilities might have broken out. Subsequently, however. Shaikh Sa ! id felt himself strong enough to withdraw the bedouin again outside the town (except for some twenty or thirty followers of Shaikh Ghanam who remined in his house). The great difficulty to be surmounted by the inter mediaries (the A1 bu Falasah and iji uhammad bin Ahmad) was that the cousins refused, in spite of a safe conduct, to come to Shaikh Sa f id T s house because they said that they w r ere afraid that he would kill them or put out their eyes (the recognized, though now perhaps old fashioned, method of ensuring that kinsmen will not become usurpers). The Shaikh on the other hand rightly refused to go to any intermediary’s house as that would have been tantamount to admitting that he was no longer Ruler. I was careful on no account to be drawn in any form into backing the safe-conduct, and refused bluntly to have anything to do with an indirect enquiry whether we would use guns or bombs to help if the cousins were to take refuge in their houses. The A1 bu Falasah were anxious to avoid bloodshed in tiiis matter, as they said that it would reflect on Dibai to have trouble of that kind over so few men. At their pressing inter cession Shaikh S a »id granted a further respite after the expiry of his ultimatum and on the 2nd November Hashar bin Rashid sv/ore at Shaikh Sa'id’s house on behalf of the sons of Rashid that they would obey him and would refrain from acts of lawlessness, ihe sons of Buti still professed themselves afraid, but about /middaynl 4. midday on the 3rd November Sa’id bin Buti came to the Shaikh^ house and swore a similar oath on behalf of himself and his brothers. It is reported to be the intention of the A1 bu Falasah to try to augment the settlement by an arrangement whereby any future differences shall be composed as they arise. 4. On the evening of the 3rd November I went on shore to see Shaikh Sa’id bin ^aktum, who had got fever badly and could not come off to H.M.S Lupin. He expressed himself quite satisfied with the oaths taken by Hashar bin Rashid and Sa'id bin Buti and informed me that the settlement was such that his position as Ruler was nov; firm. He expressed very grateful thanks for the presence of H.M.S Lupin, for the flights over Dibai of the aircraft of the Royal Air Force and for my having come down to Dibai. I took the opportunity of mentioning again to him the grant of the permit for the purchase of rifles and ammunition and the present of arms, mentioned in your telegram No:952 dated the 3rd November 1934. I requested the Officer Commanding, H.M.S Lupin, to sail as soon as the meeting was over as I felt that once a settlement satisfactory to the Shaikh had been reached, it was best for me to leave. 5. It is too early to form a definite opinion, but my impression is that Shaikh Sa T id f s position is now secure and that he has the open backing of the bulk of the A1 bu Falasah, as waverers have come down on his side as the result of the measure of support which we have given him. I also feel that, without having committed ourselves to interference in internal affairs, we have earned the gratitude of Shaikh Sa ! id and his family, and w^e have considerably strengthened our own position on the Trucial Coast. 6. It was reported to me from time to time that Shaikh Sa ! id had me.de suitable arrangements, according to the needs of the situation, for the protection of the lives and property of /BritishBritish subjects and of the office of the ^sopotamia Persia Corporation limited, and during the critical period I had a warning conveyed to the Indian community to remain in their houses. 7. Once the exchange of calls was over I refrained from visiting the shore, as to do so would have given the impression that we were actively interfering and I was particularly anxious that the parties should bring about their own settlement, but I received excellent reports two or three tines daily from Nakhuda Husain (a relative of the Residency -^gent) on behalf of the Residency Agent who was in Sharjah unfortunately very ill with fever. I regret that I should have been detained so long at Dibai when there were other important matters needing my attention at Bahrain, but I felt that, had I left, it would have encouraged the cousins to break down the negotiations and that the only course was for me to remain quietly at hand. 8. Finally, I would like to thank Commander T.H.Back, w r ith whom I was in close consultation throughout, both for his help in the matter in hand and for his hospitality during my stay in Dibai; ond also Flight-.uieutenant A.C.Evans-Evans for conveying me to Sharjah and for arranging flights at low altitude over ^ibai. The senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, kindly brought me back to Bahrain from Tanb Island in H.M.S Shoreham. 9. I am sending a copy of this letter to the Senior Naval Officer in the Persian U ulf, the Commanding Officer, H.M.S Lupin, and the Air Officer c ommanding, British forces in 'Iraq. I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant. Political Agent, Bahrain.No. C/306 r faf-LlS Office of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, camp| Bahrain, the 16th November 1934* From The Honourable Lieut#-Colonel T.C.Fowle, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf t To The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, New Delhi* Subjec1 1 Poli cy on the Trucial Coast # Sir # With reference to my telegram No .962 of the 6th November, 1934, in which I promised further details as to the settlement between the Shaikh of Dibai and his cousins* With the assistance of a report supplied by Colonel Loch, who was in charge at Dibai when the settlement was made, I can give the following summary. 2. With reference to paragraph 5 of my telegram No.896, dated the 24th October x934 =q^Krt»d=**b©v«, the notices finally issued by me took the following form: A. I am directed by the Honourable the Political Resident to inform you that you as Ruler must take such steps as you see fit to protect yourself and your administration from your cousins* You should, however ensure that the lives and property of British subjects residing in your territory are not in danger* B. The Honourable the Political Resident who has heard that there is unrest at Diba^^^ns all inhabitants that in the event of loss of life or property of British subjects in the Town resulting from any disturbance those responsible for causing such disturbance will be held to account. 3.- 2 - 3* Notice A contained a clear intimation to the Shaikh that he was at liberty to take what measures he liked to deal with those who were endeavouring to depose him, while at the same time reminding him that proper precautions should be taken with regard to British lives and property* The Shaikh was apparently fully alive to his responsibilities in this respect and even before the receipt of the notice had placed guards over the houses of British subjects* Notice B emphasised the fact that in case these lives and property were endangered as a result of any disturbance those responsible for causing the disturbance would be held to account* The causers of the disturbance, though for various reasons I did not name them, were in fact the cousinso 4 # With regard to the causes of the disturbance* For some years past Shaikh Sa^d bin MaJctum has had trouble with his cousins, the sons of the late Shaikhs Rashid and Buti, which culminated in an attempt on his life on 23rd September last and a proposal by them, during the Shaikh^s temporary absence from the town, to summon a majlis to depose him. On Shaikh Sa’id’s return, encouraged by the measures of support, mentioned in paragraph 5 below, accorded to him, he issued an ultimatum to his cousins demanding that they should either come to his house and swear loyalty to him or quit the town* After lengthy negotiations carried on by members of the (the Shaikh's sub-tribe) Al bu Falaslva representative of each branch of the cousins presented themselves at the Shaikh* s house and swore the oath demanded* The result of the settlement is that the Shaikh* s position is now stronger than it has been for The Shaikh informed Colonel Loch that he many years was- 3 - *3 | was quite satisfied with the settlement and considered his position now secure* He expressed to Colonel Loch his gratitude for the support which had been accorded him. I think the general result of the Dibai incident has been, if all goes well, to strengthen our position appreciably along the Trucial Coast* 5. Perhaps the most satisfactory feature of the settlement between the Shaikh and his cousins is that it was made by the Shaikh himself with a measure of support from us which was useful to him, for which he is duly grateful, but which in no way involved us in interference in the internal affairs of Dibai* These measures consisted in the sending of a sloop by the Senior Naval Officer at my request in the first instance with Khan Sahib Hussain bin Assan on board, (the Residency Agent himself being unable to leave Sharjah on account of illness), and then with Colonel Loch in charge; a flight of aircraft over Dibai arranged by the Air Officer Commanding, Bagdad, at my proposal; and the promise of a present of arms which I made to the Shaikh and which I ensured should be known throughout t&amp;e T«vta. in this connection it may be noted that the Shaikh can on production of a 'No objection' certificate from me, import arms whether as a present or on payment* 6, As I stated in my telegram quoted above the presence of the sloop and of aircraft had an excelxent eltect, and the Air Officer Commanding and I am grateful to the Senior Naval Officer/for their close co-operation. Khan Sahib Hussain bin Assan did good work and Colonel Loch on his arrival handled th~ situation effectively.wsmmmma^k - 4 - 7. The Dibai incident has been closed satis^cJ'oit^j. , It raises, however, in an interesting form the general question of our policy in that part of the Persian Gulf* The recent opening up of the Trucial Coast as part of the Civil and Strategical Air Route, necessitatiag the establishment of an Air Port at Sharjah, and of landing grounds, flying boat anchorages and petrol stores for the Royal Air Force aircraft at other places, has inevitably brought us into close contact with that coast, with which until the last few years we were less directly concerned# This closer contact has perhaps tended somewhat to obscure what our basic responsibilities actually are* These may be classified as follows* (a) The protection of the lives and property of British Indian subjects* It may not be out of place to note here that as far as the commercial interests of these subje cts are concerned it must be remembered that we have no Order-in-Council, and therefore we have no legal redress there as in Muscat, Bahrain and Kuwait for the claims, for instance, of these subjects against the subjects of a Shaikh* All that can be done in such cases is to try and induce the Shaikh concerned, through the Residency Agent, to force his debtorji subjects to satisfy our plaintiff# Such action if successful results as a rule in some kind of compromise between the parties* Where it is not a case of civil claims but of danger to British lives and property in case of disturbance we can of course take a much stronger line and warn the dhaikh concerned of his special responsibilities in this connection. (b) Under our Treaties with the Shaikhs we musttrade® We sire also responsible for protecting the Shaikhdoms by sea* In the case of Sharjah, under the terms of our ir Port Agreement with the Shaikh, we have to protect him from any form of aggression arising from the air port being situated in his territory* (c) A new responsibility - the safety of the /ir Route both for civil and Royal Air Force aircraft* 8. These are aur actual responsibilities on which we should concentrate* We are not responsible for the enforcement of law and order nor for the stopping of hostilities on lend though, as in the past, we can endeavour through the Residency Agent to compose differences between Shaikhs* We should not however, make ourselves responsible for the enforcsment of any agreements come to between Shaikhs* We are, under our Treaties, not responsible for the protection of the Shaikhs on land, though doubtless in the case of serious encroachment, or attack by a powerful enemy we should have to assist them* We cire not responsible for keeping Shaikhs on their thrones when they can longer keep themselves there* 9* It is obvious that a policy for the Trucial Coast based on the above genwsal considerations cannot be an ambitious one, but these considerations are put forward with strict regard to the hard facts of local circumstances* However much at any particular juncture any particular section of a Trucial Shaikhdom, including perhaps the Shaikh himself, for their own ends, might welcome our active interference in their domestic afiairs, there would certainly be an opposition party who would bitterly resent it* Moreover, -nd this isa most important factor, any such active interference would sooner or later involve us in supporting such interference by force* What are the forcible means at our disposal ? (1) The landing of an armed party from a sloop* (2) Bombardment from the sea, (3) Bombing by aircraft. (4 ) Blockade* (x) is a very hazardous measure* (2), (3) and (4) are practicable, but while His Majesty's Government might be prepared to consider such measures in the discharge of our legitimate responsibilities as set forth in para graph 7 above, I am convinced that they would certainly not sanction them to support the consequences of some act of interference - however desirable in itself - which had been made in the internal affairs of a Shaikhdom* 10. With reference to the air facilities mentioned at the beginning of paragrpah 7 above. The urgent necessity of obtaining these has inevitably dominated out policy on the Trucial Coast for the last five years• Ever since the decision was made to transfer the Air Route from the Persian to the Arab side of the Gulf it is hardly an exaggeration to say that no rolitical officer, whether Resident or otherwise, has been able (rf to visit thAyeoast without being under the trying obligation of endeavouring to extract - as painlessly as possible - air facilities from some more or less reluctant Shaikh* This reluctance was chiefly based on the fear that the obtaining of air facilities was merely the first Step towards the establishment of British administration over the Shaikhdoms, and the Shaikh of Sharjah, for example, was careful to insert a clause in his ^ir Fort agreement that the granting of that port in his territory in no way entitled us to interfere in his internalinternal affairs. This fear, I trust, the Shaikhs are now beginning to understand is unfounded ( though it is an additional agreement for pursuing a policy of non interference in the internal affairs of the Trucial Coast ), and the facilities in question have been acquired I am glad to say without the exercise of force, though only after interminable bargainings and negotiations which have left little time for the settlement of other matters. Now that these facilities are actually in being the Shaikhs do not I think regret their acquiescence. They appreciate the favourable monetary terms they have received - especially in these hard times, and in certain cases, as at Sharjah, they benefit by a public W/T Station and - shortly I hope - by a Post Office. The Shaikh of Dibai, for instance, has stated more than once that he bitterly regrets his refusal to have the Air Port at his town. At the same time they - the Shaikhs - for some years past have had to be harassed and hustled, when they know very well - and personally I quite agree with them - that 1 haste is from the Devil’. Once the question of the Yas Island tank is settled, concerning which Colonel Loch is paying a visit to Abu Dhabi shortly, the last of the air facilities will have been obtained on the Trucial Coast. It will then be possible for n^y tours, and those of the Political officers under me, to that part of the Gulf to assume the more pleasant complexion of visits undertaken to establish friendly relations with the Arab Rulers, who should now be left in peace to settle down and adapt themselves to the new conditions which the coming of an important air route has brought to theife territories. 11. To sum up . The Dibai incident ( paragraphs 1-6)rs was satisfactorily settled by a general policy of laying the responsibility on the Shaikh himself of dealing with internal trouble• He was given a free hand to deal with those who wished to depose him, and at the same time was informed that he should take precautions for the safeguarding of British lives and property© The malcontents were also reminded that they had a special responsibility in this respect* The Shaikh had a measure of support from us which was useful to him, and for which he is grateful, but which in no way involved us in the internal affairs of Dibai* Further incidents on the Trucial Coast^elsewhere might mutatis m utandis be dealt with on ti.e same lines* With regard to our future policy on the Trucial Coast which has been raised by the Dibai incident#have certain definite responsibilities on that Coast (paragraph 7) which we cannot avoid, and on which we should concentrate* We should avoid taking on new ones (paragraph 8), the most important of which would be the preventing of hostilities between Shaikhs on land, though whenever opportunity occurs we should give our good offices to the Rulers for the composition of their differances* The main argument for avoiding active interference in the internal affairs of the Trucial Coast is that sooner or later we would be compelled to support this interference by force, which would be most unadvisable , (paragraph 9)* For some years past our policy on the Trucial Coast has been dominated by the urgent necessity of obtaining air facilities from its Shaikhs (paragraph 10), who though- 9 - though they now appreciate the advantages which they receive in return for granting such facilities - have had to be hustled by us in obtaining them* The facilities in question having been received there will be more opportunities for cultivating personal and friendly relations which the Shaikhs, who should now as far as possible be left in peace to adapt themselves to the new conditions which the establishment of the Air Route has so rapidly brought about in their territory* should they see fit) would give their general approval of the policy outlined above, which can then become a guide for the future* Majesty*8 Secretary of State for India, the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, the Air Officer Commanding, British Forces in •Iraq and the Political Agent, Bahrain* I would be grateful if the Government of India I am sending copies of this despatch to His I have the honour to be, Sir Your most obedient servant Political Resident in the Persian Gulf| U | V v ^ TPS'll xRUCfl^Ui CTO v jT DlJLRY F^R pi 15 th raT 0 B 12 R 1934 to the 31 ot.

The Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Station E.I.3275L. The honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf . (Copy to: The Senior Naval Oflicer, Persian Gulf) SHEIKH OF DBBftI - ItiTERYIEV? . At t’ e meeting with the SheiKhs of the Trucial Coast on board H.M.S. 'Hawkins' on 23rd January, 1935, the Sheikh of Debai asked for a private interview, which I granted. ... The Sheikh stated that he lead supported the British Government for many years and when there had been trouble between different sheikhs he had, from tine to time, been asked by the Residency Agent to mediate. He had compelled his people (at the request of the Political Resident) to pay debts claimed to be owing to Indian merchants. 3. His cousins therefore spread abroad the statement that he had sold his country to the British. 4. The Sheikh said that he considered that in return for his past services the British Government should support him. 5. He asked that next time there was trouble with his cousins, a British Political officerjusht attend a meglis at Debai. Should he decide that the cousins were to blame, the Sheikh asked that approval should then be given for the offender(s) to be exiled. 6. Tire Sheikh added that he could easily call in Bedouins to help him. If he did so, however, looting mi^ht result and Persian and Indian merchants might suffer damage. In that event he considered that the agressors should be held responsible and not him. 7. I informed the Sheikh of Debai that I would report his remarks.

I am very glad you gave your opinion of Has al Khaimah, as an ignorant and ill- mannered person, to Hussein. One difficulty of dealing with R-.A.K. is that we have hostages to fortune in his area in the shape of air facilities. 2. With regard to bibai. I was interested to hear the result of the interview which you gave him, and am dealing with the matter in ny official memorandum. ersonaliy I would be only too pleased if he would execute, exile, or otnerwise get rid of his troublesome relatives in whatever way he thought fit, but the responsibility for doing so, as an internal affair, must be his and not mine. 1 gave him as broad a hint as 1 could in the communication through the Residency Agent I made to him/when the trouble was on at Dibai, which read r as follows. 'A. I am directed by the Honourable the political Resident to inform you that you as Ruler must take such steps as you see fit to protect yourself ana your administration from your cousins. You should, however, ensure that the lives and property of British subjects resid ng in your territory are not in danger”. The significant phrase was of course ”You as Ruler must take such steps as you see fit to protect yourself and your administration from your cousins”. if (His Excellency Vice Admiral F.F.Rose,C.B.,D.S.O., Commander-in-Chief, East Indies). / /■Conxidentl 1.

Subject : Shaikh of Dibai. With reference to your Maorandum No.£..1.3273 L, dated the 28th January 1936, particularly paragraphs 6 and o. 2. Tli* shallcb's request for a political A^ent, in the case of trouble, to visit Dibai and judge between him and his cousins is unnecessary from his point 01 view since, as he is the Ruler recognised by His iiajesty's Government, his cousins in trying to rebel against his authority- are de lacto in the wrong. The reason why the bhaikh, in spite of this, makes his request is presumably with the object 01 involving us in his internal affairs and shifting some of the responsibility at all events . oi dealing with his cousins from his shoulders to ours, which from our point ox view would be most undesirable. . 3* The whole problem is rather a difficult one ane. involves conflicting interests. On the one hand when there is trouble at ^ibai, or elsewhere on the &lt;a*ab Coast, my first responsibility is for the lives and property of British subjects, and I have therefore to remind the Shaikh that he should take adequate measures to this end. n the other hand the Shaikh naturally wants to deal with the recalcitrants vigorously and may find his hands tied by having /- 2 - havir^ to ensure that British lives and property are not endangered. But this is inevitable. 4. The communications which I issued through tne nesidency Agent when the trouble arose at dibai in liovember last 9 read as follows: A. (to the Shaldh). I am directed by the Honourable the Political Resident to inform you that you as Ruler must tke such steps as you see fit to protect yourself and your administration from your cousins. You should, however, ensure that the liwes and property of British subjects residing in your territory are not in danger. B.(general notice). The Honourable the i olitical Resident who has heard that there is unrest at dibai warns all inhabitants that in the event of loss of life or property of British subjects in the Town resulting from any disturbance those responsible for causing such disturbance will be held to account. 5. These two notices taken together on the one hand gave the Shaikh a reasonable free hand to protect himself and his administration from his cousins, and on the other hand gave ♦ a special warning to the disturbers of the ^eace. x * X am sending a copy of this to the denior I aval Oxficei', Persian Gulf.

The Trucial Coast, whicn stretches from the Testern side of QATAR to CAPS MUSANDAK, comprises seven principalities, each ruled by an independent Arab Shaikh. From time to time over a long period of years, the Government of India has negotiated trea-ties with these Shaixhs, the original intention oeing to enable Great Britain to intervene to put an end to the constant warfare between tnem and to stop their piratical and slave trading activities. Later, tne Ghaikha undertook to have no dealings with any otner power and not to grant pearling or oil concessions without Great Britain 1 s consent. No subsidies seem to have seen paid, and until tne es ablishment of the Air Route, tne only expenditure incurred in respect of the Trucial Coast was the maintenance oi a Residency Agent (native) at SHARJAH. Great Bitain’s only commitment was an unuertaking to each Shaikh to protect nim from attack by sea; she consistently avoided entanglement in their internal affairs and confined herself to recognising successions (often secured by assassination) subject to the acceptance by the new Shaikh of the treaty obligations undertaken by his predecessor. 3. Last month, when a dispute seemed likely to result in the murder of the Shaikh of DIBAl, certain steps were taken by the Political authorities '’Men. they claim were in accordance with their policy of non-intervention in internal affairs. Since, however, it vas foun 1 advisable to send the Political A rent, BAHREIN to T )I3AI aboard one of H.l • warships, to sk for demonstrations by aircraft and to give the Shaikh a present of arms and ammunition, and since it is admitted that these measures had an important effect in upholding the prestire of the Shaikh and bringing waverers to his side, the distinction between intervention and non-intervention i very fine one. The reason for the action taken on this occasion is that property and lives of British subjects were in danger, but, as tnere are )robably a few Indian traders in each of these Gulf ports, that possibility must have arisen on numerous occasions in the past when no action was taken. 4* It la considered. tnM the action taken at J IBAI last month was most advisable ana shouiu nui'K a cnange in the policy of Great Britain towards tne SnaiKhs of tne Trucial Coast, for nowadays DIBAl is a refuelling station for flying boats and many oi tne stores for the landplane station at SHARJAH are landed there. Thus internal unrest which interfered with the facilities for aircraft which have been obtained would be a very serious matter. 5. The Resident, Persian Gulf defines his responsibilities as (a) 'Protection of lives and property of British subjects'. There appears to be some doubt as to what steps we are entitled to take under the treaties to ensure this. (b) 'To prevent hostilities at sea, arms traffic and slave ~~~ trade'. . Tith Me exception of a very few isolated cases, this reBoonaibility ceaaed to exiat aorae time ago.P- . ' r e.. . ^ /9. (c) ’he safety of the Air Route'’. , Although placed, last by th„ Resiient, Persian Gulf \2j. no a by 1 ,r the most import ait oi the three responsib ilities. Cons i tier able sums of money are oeing ^aiu by the Air Ministry lor iacilitius wnicn have been granted by tae various bnaiKhs and some auiitional ones may still ue rejuired. It is considered tnat our policy should ensure tnat we can rely upon making use of these facilities. It is oy no means onlv a question oi preventing interference with the civil air route, although as that rows in importance its interruption wo jo. u, a serious latter, but our inability to move either i-tying boats or landplanes along the strategic air route m some emergency might have tne most uisastrous results ior Great Britain. 3*,i i Before th ® aclvent aircraft, tae only assistance whi^-h could tie given to a Shaikh, unless an expedition was sent from India, was oy means o; the Royal Navy and consequently care was tacen to limit our commitments to a guarantee of protection against attack by sea. Aircraft now provide a means by wnich assistance can be given against attack either by land or by sea and certain new circumstances have arisen which make a modification of policy desirable. in 7 * iU ''dere is always a danger that, internal strife f de principalities may temporarily interfere with tae air route ns in the case of PTBAI last month, when it was considered advisable to warn flyincr boats not togo^ T e • m dere is also the lancer of strife between. t'.-o neighbouring shaikhs, as in January this year, when it ^?M-r?w re ? ? dispute between the Shaikhs of AJI,1AN and _ *' \' ml , ^ ^ ln er ^ ere with the civil air route. Although proved o be a very small affair which was quickly settled, aircraft were required to stand by in case it developed. It is probable that in the case of internal disturbance in one oi tne principalities or in that of a dispute between neighbouring Shaikhs, demonstrations by H.M. sloops and aircraft would usually suffice to settle the trouble and that bombardment woula seldom become accessary, and tne -.P.j s proposed policy of so-called non-intervention mi nt ue adequate if tnere were no otner threat to the safety of the air route. J this • When the possibility of establishing an air route along tae Arabian Coast was being examined in 1927, the R.P.G. oi that time was so impressed by the rise of 1BN SAJ’JD’s influence and tae insecurity to whicn a chain of air stations might oe exposed that he recommenced tha tae long established policy oi aostention from all but naval co irnitments snould be discarded. That recommendation was not adopted, put l^j _ 3AU UP 1 a power and prestige nave increased steadily, andT wTtTT^fie production of oil in BAHRAIN and the belief that it exists in NASA and in places on the Trucial ^ nteref;t in those parts has increased. Toda.r, ^ ? powerful influence over the 7r jcial Shaikhs and it is most improbable that they would &lt;r 0 counter to his r?i 1 ?\ UnleSR they coald rel ^ u P° n the protection of the British. This was illustrated during the past year when the An lo i ersinn Oil Coraoany wished for an extonfeion of their concession to prospect for oil in oat\p. ■ of rw 3MJ 1 TJT) the Shaikh ,vnn for 8 orae timfre^c^nt to an extension ani the British Oovern-nent. was obn4' to bv l'ndVTe^ hin, , a fflwrantee of Protection from aUack ny land as well qr by sea.Pa p;e. 'I , V, At present, relations between IBN SAU’UD and Great Britain are -rood and there appears to be little prospect of an open breach, bat, vith our oresent policy of non-intervention, his influence over the Trucial Shaikhs ^ives him an excellent opportunity to stir up trouble which would interfere with tne air route. If such trouble did arise Great Britain weuld oe forced to intervene to restore her air communications, and it is therefore suggested that a change of policy is desirable; the Shaikhs should be given to understand that a state Of unrest which threatens tne security of the air route will not oe permitted. It is probable that tne Trucial ShaiKns would at first, in principle, resent any interference in their internal affairs uy Great Britain in the same way that they originally objected to tne grant of facilities for the air route in tneir territory. They are now beginning to appr oiate the air route and the money it is bringing to them and it would not be long before tney could be persuaded that any measures taken to safeguard these facilities which they have granted and tne incomes which they derive from tuem would be to their own advantage.

The Council note, inter alia, that Colonel Fowle is of the opinion that 'we should avoid taking on. the preventing of hostilities between shaikhs on land'^ and that our policy should continue to be one of 'avoiding active interference in the internal affairs of the Trucial Coast'. In view of the increasingly active interest that the United States, Japan, Persia and Saudi Arabia are taking in trade and commerce along the southern shores of the Persian Gulf, the Council feel some anxiety lest the passive policy advocated by the Honourable the Political Resident should result in a further lowering of British prestige in t-v the Gulf and thus threaten the security of the air route with which they are deeply concerned. 3. The Air Council feel, therefore, that the time may have come when His Majesty's Government's age long policy of The Under Secretary of State, non-interference/ Political Department, India Office, S.W.l. r 1 u S.32395/§.6 Sir P' 'S'' PH RE 0 i p '7\ , CY i'o.

The foundation of our policy on the Trucial Coast is Lord Curzcn's address delivered at ohargah on the 21st November f90b. The orinciples then laid down in our opinion still hold, with the addition that we have now to ensure the safety of the air route. This policy &gt; is again defined in paragraph 7 of T'owlc s letter No.C/306 dated the 16 th November 1934. It expressly excludes interference in the internal affairs of the Sheikhdoms, and differs in this important respect from the conception of para mo untcy as understood in India,. 2.. The concern of the Air Ministry is limited to the additional responsibility for the / safety of the air route. If this can be securon/ by a minimum of commitments as at present, namely by specific agreements with Sheikhs for air facilities and our general position on Trucial Coast as based on Treaties and long connections,/-2* 1031 connections, there is in our opinion no advantage in assuming new ones. In particular we are opposed to suggestion that an announcement, such as rropospd oy Air Ministry at the end of para. 3 of their letter, should he made to Rulers as this would imply a measure of general support in the internal administration, the responsibility for which we should not undertake. If they break their specific agreements for provision of air facilities, they are ’well aware that suitable action will be taken to deal with them. If at any time the necessity for insuring the safety of air route necessitates assumntion of fresh responsibilities, the posi tion will hav'-' to be face!, but that is not at l resent.. 3c One other matter in our opinion re quires consideration at the present juncture The develooment of oaidi lower in Arabia has already led to negotiations with Ion Said for a definition of boundaries between his kingdom and the limits of the Coastal Rulers, If Ibn laud were '' o attack Trucial Iheiks or indeed Muscat, His Majesty 1 s Government, whether or n*t in conjunction with the Government of Madia, would presumably have to defend tnem from aggression on land., thus adding to undertakings issued by Lord Curzon.

V India Office letter to Political Itesident Wo.17,1299/34, dated tne 9th March x934) it is agreed that a responsibility for the defence of Kuwait lias been assumed. This however is an entirely different proposition from the inauguration of a policy of interference in internal affairs, resort to which, in our opinion, is at the present juncture entirely unnecessary. 4.

Shaikh Said hin Butti therefore took the necessary measures. 7irst he expelled all the gamblers and cleaned the place from the dirt which existed there. He afterwards ordered tnat there should he no procession at night time from four hours after sunset and that should any one he seen going about after these hours he would he heaten and kept in detention until morning time whether he he a member of the nohility or of the commons. Foreign residents of the higher class are being warned thrice / and they are subsequently found acting contrary to this order A they will he punished. Shaikh Said hin Butti has enforced all this in the place and he is doing his utmost to protect the bazaars from thieves. '*he merchants are at present satisfied with this step taken. Shaikh Said hin Butti has, as a result of his activities, been able to arrest a thief responsible for the thefts mentioned in paragraphs Nos.244,266 and 278 of ray Beports Nos.21,23 and 24 of 1935 respectively - cases in which it was known where he had stolen from and however much Shaikn Said pressed the man to name his accomplices he would not divulge tne information.

The men arrested were all committed to the prison of Shaikh Said hin Maktum and enquiries are being instituted to trace the rest. 2.

Said bin Butti seems to be a thruster. His activities in cleaning up the night life of Jibai, though this does not concern us, is doubtless admirable, while his activities in arresting thieves and enforcing law and order are all to the good. 3. There is one point, however, which we shall have to watch and that is the warning given to the “foreign residents of the higher class' 1 i.e. I presume British Indian subjects, that if they are subsequently found acting contrary to a certain order issued by Said bin Butti they will be punished. As you know we have no Order in Council on the Trucial Coast and therefore I suppose technically speaking British Irtdian subjects come under the jurisdiction of the Shaikh. In practice, however, vre have always considered that these individuals do not come under the jurisdiction of the local Ruler, and if any action is taken against a British Indian subject by Said bin Butti we shall have an awkward situation 2 On the wh61e the appointment seems a good one and j on / Lieut.•Colonel Gordon Loch,CIE., Political Agent, Bahrain2 'h on our hf-nds# I will discuss this question with you on my approaching visit to Bahrain. df &lt;7^ Ml .(Copy given to Officiating Residency Agent, Sharjah). -A.
