Concerns were raised regarding the local Shia Qadis who had been quarrelling with one another and allowing their personal animosity to influence their legal decisions. Hence, communications with the British Embassy in Baghdad were made to ask for advice on obtaining a man from Iraq to act as a third Shia Qadi in Bahrain. Later in the file it is stated that Shaikh Abdul Husain Alhilli from Iraq was appointed to act as Qadi and teacher of religious law in Bahrain. Terms and conditions of his recruitment were discussed in the correspondence. Other letters were sent by the Adviser to the Government of Bahrain to the local Qadis to discuss their roles.The main correspondence is between the Political Agency, Bahrain, the Political Residency in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, and the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Charles Dalrymple Belgrave.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Adviser to the Government of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Shaikh Abdul Husain Alhilli</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Judicial appointments</topic></subject><subject><topic>Judges</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x0002a4#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x0002a4#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x0002a4#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
