IN NORTH PERSIA ^ X V 7/ n/p+fy (v/ith map and photographs) c i* c^-or i 1. Introduction . In the autumn of 1944 a great deal of atten- ?&gt; &lt;, r tion was directed to the question of oil in North Persia as a '** result of the Russian demands that were made at that time on the Persian Government. vr,o ( '’•O.ili) These demands referred mainly to a future and as yet un- agreed-upon concession to search for and produce oil and other minerals over a great area in North Persia. They also referred to the ’existing rights’ which were said to he held by Soviet citizens and consequently by the Soviet Government in an area known as the Kavir-i-Khourian, The purpose of this memorandum is to place on record all the information, as far as it can be ascertained, appertaining to the history of the Kavir-i-Khourian Concession, to give an account'Of the basis of the Russian claims and finally to suggest certain reasons why the possession of rights, genuine, pre scriptive or disputed, maybe of peculiar importance in this region. 2. The Kavir-i-Khourian . Definition of the Area . The region generally known today as the Dasht-i-Kavir-i-Khourian is an area of desert lying immediately to the south of the town of Semnan in north central Persia. The southern boundary of the area, which may reasonably be described by this name is vague, but it is generally accepted as being somewhat to the north of the Kuh-i- Gugird range of hills. The use of the word 'Kavir’ in conjunction with ’Khourian’ has no particular significance; in Persian this word means a salt and swampy desert, but there are frequently large areas inside a region of kavir which are neither salt nor swampy. In the Royal Farman granted by Nasir-ad-Din Shah in 1880 to Hajji Ali Akbar Amin, no significant description of what area is to comprise the concession in the Kavir-Khourian is attempted and it would indeed be difficult to define such an area today without astronomically fixed points, as around and beyond the Kuh-i-Gugird are the wastes of the great salt desert of east central Persia, a region almost devoid of geographical feature. From the vague wording of the Farman, from reference to the sulphur mines and oil mines in the document, from some knowledge of the ground and from what is generally accepted today by the people of Semnan as the limits of the Dasht-i-Khourian an ill- defined area does however emerge. This area has been shown on the accompanying map, hatched in red and almost certainly contains within it the lands which the original parties to the paper had in mind. From this it will be seen that an area of from 12 to 1500 square miles may be reasonably taken as comprising the Kavir-i- Khourian. The small oil seepages and brine springs which ar^e presum ably close to the oil mines mentioned in the Farman lie in the northern half of the area relatively close to Semnan. The sulphur mines of Delaryan and Khourian whose position on the ground are not in serious doubt are situated near the centre of the area marked in red while there is a further group of old workings towards the S.W. corner.2 The 'Copper Mines of Chah Shuran and the Salt Desert of Semnan' are probably the copper workings shown on the map at a point about 15 miles N#E. of Semnan. No Semnani would today describe this particular locality as being in the Kavir-i-Khourian. The same observation holds good for the other lead* copper and coal mines in the Semnan and Damghan districts and the Parman was doubtless intended in these cases to refer to parti cular places where workings had been carried out. These re marks on the area containing the Kavir-i-Khourian may b e con cluded by noticing that although the Parman granted the right to work 'the oil fields of the Khourian salt desert' that: (a) Areas south of lat. 35° are peculiarly waterless and even today are not easy of access. Any serious work to the southward of this with the re sources available to Hajji Ali Akbar Amin in 1380 would have been impracticable. (b) The general insecurity prevailing in 1330 at any distance from a local centre of the Government’s authority such as Semnan, would have rendered small-scale operations precarious. The question of whether or not the area hatched in red on the map has always formed part of the Province of Khurasan is in dispute. The'Persian Government’s claim that it has for long formed an integral part of Khurasan would be difficult to deny, but evidence is also available to show that for certain periods of time the area and region formed part of the province or district of Semnan and Damghan. 3. The original Farmans . (a) The Parman granted to Mjrza Al i Khan Ma’danchi in 1877« As far as is known the first Parman referring to the minerals of the Khourian was granted by Nasir-ad-Din Shah in 1877 to Mirza Ali Khan Ma’danchi (i.e. 'the Miner'). The sulphur workings in the area are, however, evidently very old, and there may well have been earlier documents. This Parman of 1877 is a satisfactory document in that it attempts a definition of the area. It reads in part as follows: The area is ... 'situated two farsakhs (approximately 7 miles) south of Semnan and the swamps ... we hereby grant to him as his permanent property 3*000 Zars which extend from the central point of the mine to 1,500 Zars in four directions'.' A Zar is a somewhat variable measure but may be taken as being about 41 inches. The location of the central point referred to is not cluar. Notice has been taken of this 1877 Parman in order to ensure completeness; it does not figure again in the history of the x Extract from Confidential Despatch No. 453 dated British Legation Gulhek. 10.9*26 to P.0.Khourian and it was probably disposed of by being declared illegal in 1924» ) The Farman granted to Ha.i.ii Ali Akbar Amin in 1880. This Parraan 5 v;hich v/as granted by Nasir-ad-Din Shah in 1880 to Hajji Ali iUcbar Amin generally known as the Amin-i-Ma } adin (The Custodian of the Mines), is important as it is the document on which all subsequent claims are based. The following is a translation of the Farman$ the notes at the oottom of the trans lation refer to the registration of the document in 1880 and in 1924. Copy of Royal Farman Nasir-ad-Oin Shah Since His Excellency Hoqji Ali Akbar Amin has for some years, by permission of the eternal government, at his own expense and with great effort and labour developed copper, oil, lead, sulphur and coal mines, both old and new, situated in the districts of Semnan and Damghan, and since in these fortunate times, His Majesty is very anxious to promote this most profit able work, a request has been submitted to His Imperial Majesty that a Royal Farman be issued establishing his ownership so that he might with greater confidence end security set to work to open and maintain these mines 10 Sites. Mines situated in Semnan &amp; sites The Luye Dardar lead mines situated in the Kilud Vareh Mountain known as Shidari ala Hudud. The copper mines of Khashchuran and the salt desert of Semnan. The lead mines of Riza Abad. The coal mines of Luye Dardar and Fulad Mahalla and Shourtangneh. The Sulphur mines of Delaryan and Khourian. The oil fields of the Khourian Salt desert Therefore having for his full encouragement and reassurance bestowed upon him ownership over the mines, both old and new, where he has created settlements, as enumerated above, we now by virtue of a government order grant him exemption for a period of ten years from all Court charges; on the expiry of the period of ten years, after deducting necessary expenses, one-tenth of the profits of the mines must be paid to the Royal Court. It is agreed that His Excellency I'tizad es Sa.ltaneh, the Minister of Education and Mines, having established Ali Akbar Amin’s ownership of these mines, the private secretaries of His Majesty will register and accept responsibility for the Royal Farman.

Certified true copy of the original - place of signature and seal of the Cabinet of the Ministry of Public Works. This is a true copy of a copy. For many years the Farman and the work carried out under its provisions by the Amin-i-Ma’adin do not seem to have ex cited any particular interest except that from time to time the structure and petroleum possibilities of the Khourian fold proper attracted attention. The sulphur, lead, copper and coal v/orkings which resulted from the Amin-i-Ma’adin ? s efforts were evidently on a small scale and primitive in scope, while it is doubtful if anything at all was done at the 'oil mines' except the collection of seepage oil. ^• The. 2nd_ do Reuter Concession January 1889 • In 1872 Baron Julius de Reuter obtained an important con cession from the Persian Government allowing him to prospect for minerals, to construct telephones and water channels and to found a national bank; largely as the result of Russian pressure this concession was later cancelled without compensa tion. Undeterred by his earlier difficulties Baron de Reuter retained his belief in Persian minerals and on 30th January 1389 obtained what has come to be known as the second de Reuter Concession. In the prospectus issued in April 1090 inviting subscrip tions for the ordinary shares of the Persian Bank Mining Rights Corporation, it stated that the Persian Government had sanctioned the transfer of mineral and oil rights under the concession to the Corporation and went on to the effect that: 'The Articles thus referred to, granted for the whole term of the concession the.exclusive and definite privilege of working throughout the Empire, the iron copper, lead, mercury, coal, petroleum, mangan ese, borax and asbestos mines belonging to the State and which had not been previously ceded to others. The excepted mines are specified in an official list' . ..U) This official list was unfortunately not available at the time of the preparation of this paper, but it is worthy of note that sulphur is not mentioned in the list of minerals referred to in the prospectus of 1890 , nor in the concession itself. As sulphur and petroleum are the two substances which (l) In the records of the Imperial Bank of Iran.- 5 - have always been the objective of concession holders in the Kavir-i-Khourian ? there is reason to suppos.e that- this, area was meant to be excluded from the scope of the 2nd da. Reuter ~^!oncession. The Persian Bank Mining Rights Corporation v/ere, however, not left unaware of the possibilities of petroleum being'found near Semnan as the following extract from a report by their consulting geologist James Mactear shows Semnan Petroleum This deposit lies completely in the desert to the south of Semnan* I was much struck with it and believe there is every chance of petroleum in quantity being found here. There is a 'very considerable demand locally for a cheap class of burning oil and this could be obtained very readily by a simple distilla tion of the crude oil, as refining v/ould be required in the first instance. Samples of the crude oil and of burning oil which I had distilled from it in Tehran, with very rough appli ances, are now on their way home. This district is, I think, a very promising one and should petroleum in quantity Fe found, there is no doubt that it could be worked to advantage. In a further report, Mactear stated that he was accompanied on this journey by A.P. Stahl, who also wrote a report on the Semnan district. 5* The Torrance Concession . For the sake of ensuring completeness it may be as well to mention here the Torrance Concession granted in 1894* In the matter of petroleum rights it v/ould seem that this concession overlapped to some extent the rights which had been granted under the by now abandoned 2nd de Reuter Concession of 1389 ? and the Torrance Concession therefore stands in much the same position to Semnan as did the de Reuter Concession. As, however, this Torrance Concession very quickly lapsed, the matter is of interest in one aspect only. That is, both these concessions were probably drawn up with regard to the rights (among several others) of Hajji nil Akbar Amin. Other Farmans and Concessions granted to individuals such as the Sipahsalar in 1896 refer to other specified districts and are of no concern to this account. 6 . The D f Arcy Concession of May 28th 1901 * Under the terms of this most important document, the Concessionaire was excluded from any rights in the five northern provinces of Persia - namely Azarbaijan, Gilan, Mazanderan, Astrabad and Khurasan, but no mention is made as to the safe guarding of any existing petroleum rights, other than those at Shushtar, Qasr-i-Shirin and Daliki for which special provision is made. Whether the Farrnan of 1880 was overlooked at the time the D'Arcy Concession was drawn up or whether it was assumed by the Persian Government that the Khourian area lay definitely in the province of Khurasan is uncertain. Judging by the arguments advanced by the Persian Government in 1926 the former possibility is the more likely. (l) The original report dated 1893 is in the records of the Imperial Bank of Iran,London.- 6 - 7• Death of Amin-i-Ma 8 adin - Rights under the 1880 Farman pass to various heirs - Khostharia obtains a claim to certain of these rights * —— Upon the death of the Amin-i-Ma’adin (it is understood that this occurred at the end of the last century) the rights under the Parman of 1880 passed to various individuals and relations who were his heirs. The death of the Amin-i-Ma’adin did not produce any marked change in the tempo of operations in the Khourian and work no doubt continued in the same desultory and primitive fashion as heretofore. But times were changing, the great importance of petroleum and the enormous value of the deposits granted under the D’Arcy concession were becoming known. Under these circumstances it is not surprising that the petroleum rights contained in the old document of 1880 , rights now shared by several persons, should attract the attention of a man like Khostharia. It is improbable that the complete and true story of how Khostharia was able to purchase the rights of some of the various heirs v/ill ever be fully known. It must be borne in mind, however, that more than one of the co-heirs were people of little education who could no doubt be fairly easily per suaded to part with their share of the rights for a sum in cash down. It may also hove occurred to more than one heir that these v/ere rights that they were never likely to be able to exercise effectively and that cash in hand was worth more than some doubtful future prospect. It would appear that some at least of the transactions took place in the town of Semnan, where in accordance with the lav* they v/ere witnessed by a Mulla of that place. It is also said that an attempt was made in 1916 or 1917 to induce the principal heir (who was actually in possession of the Parman) to part with the document. But at this time Khostharia did not succeed in obtaining possession of the paper. The one fact v/hich does emerge from the complicated history of these purchases and intrigues is that Khostharia succeeded in establishing a claim to some part of the rights granted under the original Parman. These events v/ere not allowed to pass unnoticed in the public debates of the time, but although a great deal of criti cism and comment v/as provoked, nothing definite resulted. 8 . Khostharia’s status and his relations to the Russian Bank. Khostharia was originally a Russian subject of Georgia and he is described in Russian consular documents of pre-revolution days as being a ”gentleman” of that province. Khostharia was a man of great activity and of considerable ability, his many intrigues and activities such as the sale of the ''Khostharia Concession”( 1 )to the Anglo Persian Oil Company (l) The ! 'Khostharia Gone ess ion”. This concession based partly on a Parman of 1896 was granted in 1916 and 1917 by the Persian Government to Khostharia. The latter sold it to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in 1920. In 1920 the Persian Government informed the A.P.O.C. that the concession was null and void.- 7 - are outside the scope of this account hut to describe him merely as a ’’Georgian adventurer” is perhaps to do him an injustice. He seems to have been able to live down his description as a gentleman and reputation as a capitalist and after some years in Tehran was apparently on easy terms with the nev/ masters of Russia, and with that Soviet organisation, the Russian Bank. When Khostharia acquired part of the rights under the Farman of 1880 it is not clear whether he bought the rights for himself and later parted with some of them to the Russian Bank or whether he was acting as their agent, but the former is much the more probable. It is, at any rate, evident that the Russian Bank was involved in the purchases and began to take an active if dis creet interest in the Khourian and its affairs. 9 . The 1921 Treaty of Friendship between Persia and the Soviet Union. In 1921 a Treaty of Friendship was signed between Persia and the Soviet Union. Articles IX and XIII of this Treaty are specially relevant. Article IX reads (The Soviet Government) 'Cedes (to the Persian Government) full ownership of all funds and of all real and other property which the Russian Discount Bank possesses on Persian territory and likewise transfers to it all the assets and liabilities of that Bank”. Article XIII reads ’’The Persian Government, for its part, pro- mises not to^ cede to a third power or to its subjects the con cessions and property restored to Persia by virtue of the present Treaty and to maintain these Rights for the Persian nation”. as it has apparently never been suggested that the rights acquired by Khostharia under the Farman of 1880 should be surrendered in accordance with Article IX,it was presumably contended that the Bank’s interest in these transactions was a limited one. Article XIII would possibly be invoked if any attempt were made by the Persian Government to grant a concess ion covering the Khourian area. 10. The Registration of the Farmans 192lt-~1926. Protest, by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. In 1924 the Persian Government called for the production of all Farmans dealing with mineral concessions in order that they might be examined and registered. Out or the twenty-three farmans dealing with petroleum rights which were presented for registration, all were rejected as illegal except the 18o0. Farman granted to Amin—i—Ma’adin for the rignts in the Kavir— 1 — Khourian. This was registered by the Ministry of Public Works on the 8 th of July 1924. This rather extraordinary result and the equivocal manner in which the registration appears to have been carried out leaves a strong suspicion, which is however incapable of proof, that the whole operation was designed with only two objects in view; namely the giving ol a new and fresh proof of legality to the 1380 document and the providing of a mean§ whereby possession of the document itself might be obtained^J It appears probable at any rate that the then Minister of Public Works (Davar) obtained possession of the original document (l) Confidential Despatch No. 453 from Br.Lcg.Gulhek to F.O. 10.9*26.at this time and parted with it to Khostharia from v/hence it later passed into Russian official hands. After this affair had become known beyond any doubt,the Anglo-Persian Oil Company protested strongly against the exclusion of the Kavir-i-Khour from the scope of the D f nrcy Concessional)and against the fact that no publicity had been given to the registration of the i860 parman as a legal document. The Persian Government’s attitude to this protest was that: (a) The Anglo-Persian Oil Company had no rights under the D’Arcy Concession in the Semnan region as this region was an integral part of the Province of Khurasan and as such was excluded from the concession by the terms of article 6 . (b) ^That even assuming they had these rights, the earlier rights over the Kavir-i-Khourian given by the Parman of 1880 had precedence over those granted in 1901 to Mr. D’Arcy, irrespective of whether these latter were a 'privilege special et exclusif’. 'The second position, presuming the validity of the farman, appears tenable against the Company, though the first is more doubtful'( 2 ^. Perhaps because of this argument,but more probably because of the possibility of creating a dangerous and costly precedent, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company did not resort to arbitration and the matter was allowed to rest as under protests;. 11• Formation of the Kavir-i-Khourian Company Ltd . On the basis of the 1880 Parman which had now been shown to possess such unusual legality, a Persian syndicate was formed and registered under Persian Company Law with a nominal capital of 5.000,000 tomans. 'In this Company the Soviet authorities are said to be largely interested, their adepts being Monsieur Khostharia and some Persians of high rank 1 '^). The Tehran paper Iran of July 2nd 1926 gave the following details of the Company: 'In accordance with the Persian Law of Commerce a shareholding association has been formed, to be known as the Kavir-i-Khourian Shareholding Association Limited. It is composed of the following individuals: Mir Hamzavi, Hajji Mirza Ali Akbar Setoudeh, Mirza Abdul Hussein, Mirza Ibrahim Khan and Mirza Abdul Razzaq Ghakizadeh. The object of the Company is the exploitation of the oil of the Kavir-i-Khourian situated in the district of Semnan. The capital of the Company, five million tomans, is composed of one hundred thousand ’ shares of fifty tomans each, of v/hich, 1 , 700,000 tomans is to be subscribed in cash. Five per cent will be deducted from net income for the formation of a reserve. The deed of partnership is dated 11th Azar 1304 and was registered on the 14 th of that month (respectively, the 2 nd (1) See letter .dated 28.1.27. in file 395 A (1927) Tehran Chancery Records.

The ^'central office of the Company is situated at Tehran, Hassanabad, at the house of Amir Muazzam. u The Legation's views on the Company were as follows: H Semnan and Darnghan. The Persian syndicate formed for the exploitation of the oil supposed to exist in this area was registered early in the year. It is in composition Russo-Persian; and among its shareholders are M. Khostharia, the Persian Minister of Court (Teymartache) and the ex-Minister of Public Works (Davar). His Imperial Majesty the Shah, has been given, it is credibly reported, a substantial interest in the company'( 1 J. These events did not take place without a protest being attempted on the part of the disappointed heirs of Amin-i- Ma'adin; needless to say, the protests were quite ineffectual. 12. Operations of the new Company in the Kavir-i-Khourian. Visit of Italian and French representatives. Interest of the Rnglo-Persian Oil Company in these operations. Having succeeded in establishing the Company, Khostharia proceeded with the task of actually drilling for oil on the Khourian fold. Two drillers, Genijas Chukvaranni and Eseliani together with a Mr. Genijas Andronikov, who was appointed manager at Semnan, arrived from Baku. A considerable quantity of machinery began to arrive at Bandar Pahlavi and road construction and other works were begun. The Russian staff were established in some new quarters at a place which became known as Hajjiabad, midway between the scene of operations and Semnan. As might be expected, however, difficulties of various kinds were not wanting; a shortage of water for drilling soon caused delays and it would appear that Khostharia was kept short of money by the Russians. This was particularly important, 'as the concession had not been ratified by the Majlis and a great deal of money was required to keep people’s mouths shut' (2). This reference to keeping people's mouths shut may refer to a proposal which had been circulating in parliamentary circles, perhaps 'opposition' circles, for the introduction of a bill aimed at cancelling concessions which had no time limit or which had remained dormant. The news of this proposal, which is not to be confused with the bill for the registration of farmans, caused a good deal of uneasiness at the time. The matter eventually dropped, after the British Legation had tried with some success to persuade various other foreign diplomatic representatives in Tehran to unite with them in opposing the measure. A review of the evidence at present available suggests, however, that we may have been rather ’too clever’ in this matter and that the early demise of the proposal may have been (1) Br.Legation Tehran. Annual Report for 1926. (2) Confidential memorandum No. 395 A of 27»7»27*10 just as much due to Khosthar ia 7 s Russian money as to our cautious intervention. At about this time (i.e. 1927-1928) a party of French and^ Italian specialists visited the prospective oil field. Khosthux'ia had presumably offered some shares in the enterprise to this xoreign group but whatever the details of the offer were* nothing came of the matter and the foreigners 9 visit was brief and un productive. Y/ork however continued to proceed,partly financed no doubt by a proportion of the money v/hich Khostharia had received from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company at the time of the sale of the Khostharia Concession 9 to that Company. The ^.nglo—Persian Oil Company continued to take as close an interest as was practicable in the events at- Semnan and in spite of the difficulties with which access to the Khourian were soon surrounded, more than one visit by officials of the ^.P.O.C. took placel-W. These visits and reports from Resht confirmed that drilling machinery was arriving and that serious work was being undertaken. s* vioit was also paid to the area by one of the senior geologists of the A.P.O.C.,_who reported unfavourably on the actual struc ture where drilling was in progress. This visitor was con ducted round by a certain Sayyid Agha of Semnan s who later not surprisingly got into a good deal of trouble for his pains, jh Soviet geologist Golubniatnikov is said,however, to have report ed favourably on the structure. T3 • Prilling operations. A long dormant -period. The death of Khostharia. The downfall of Teymou rtache. The actual dates of the completion of the early wells (believed to be two) is not known,but they were drilled no doubt between 1926 and the time of the downfall of Teymourtache. The results of these wells, their depth and geology were never officially communicated to the Persian Government Department responsible for these matters, and it is not definitely known whether oil was found or notj it is safe to say that commercial production was not obtained. After the downfall of Teymourtache, several of the enter prises with which he had been connected fell under the Imperial disfavour and the Kavir-i-Khourian Company was one of those which suffered. The details of Teymourtache 9 s connection with the Company are not knov/n but the methods by which the 1380 Farman was legalised and changed hands suggest that a good deal of money also changed hands. Whether or not the end of the powerful minister was in any way connected with the apparent failure of the Company to find oil in large quantities or whether he was held to blame by Riza Shah as being the means by which this Russian influence was introduced into the kingdom it js impossible to say. it is clear, however, that shortly after his death active operations ceased altogether ; most of the Russian staff departed, and the field remained dormant for many years. Khostharia also did not live to see any result in the Kavir-i-Khourian as he died in 1932 ( 2 ). (1) See report dated 21.10.27 in 395 A (192?) Tehran Chancery Records. ^ ( 2 ) He married the sister-in-law of Teymourtache in 1930 .11 ♦ 14* The Amiranian Oil Concession. 195/ « In connection with this concession (which was abandoned in ,^1938) it need only he mentioned that the rights of the Kavir-i- Khourian Company were not infringed, as the western boundary of the prospecting concession (shown on the attached map) follows a north-south line some fifty miles to the east of the town of Semnan. 15* Allied entry into Persia. August 1941» Military precautions at Semnan. Matters at the Kavir-i-Khourian remained in the dormant state referred to until the entry of the Russian and British armies into Iran in August 1941* Semnan then at once became a garrison town in the Russian zone of occupation. One of the first steps taken by the Russians wan to post military guards on all the buildings and machinery belonging to the Company and the road from Semnan across the ’oilfield’ was closed to every one except officially approved travellers, in spite of the fact that this cut off communications between the Government-worked sulphur mines and Semnan. Military precautions such as these need not, however, be considered particularly unusual. Another step was also taken. In the correspondence which took place between the Soviet and Persian Governments prior to the signature of the Tripartite Treaty of 1942, the Soviet Government informed the Persian Government that it v/ould expect the latter to give favourable consideration to the rights held by Russian interests in the . Kavir-i-Khourian. The Persian Government had to give at least a tacit agreement. 1 6 . 1942 to 1944» The arrival of M. Kavtaradze in Tehran. Until the autumn of 1944 no drilling or other activity took place in the region of the two dormant wells although the whole area remaind under guard and was very difficult of access. j It is evident, however^that from early 1942 onwards a great ; area of territory to the south-east, south and south-west of the area hatched in red on the map, was geologically reconnoitred and in some rough degree surveyed. This work was carried out by armed parties of geologists and surveyors dressed in military uniform and equipped with mules or jeep cars. One such party made a crossing of the Great Kavir itself and was reported in the i-uiarak region. These parties formed no doubt a part of the general geological mission which was referred to by M. Kavtaradze on his arrival in Tehran. Monsieur Kavtaradze, Soviet Assistant Commissar for Foreign Affairs, arrived in Tehran in September 1944, and shortly afterwards made a public announcement regarding the purpose of his visit which was published in the press of the city on October 6th. The following extract is from the Journal de Tehran of that date: 'Depuis trois semaines, Mr. Kavtaradzeh, Commissaire adjoint du peuple aux Affaires etrangeres de 1’URSS, est notre hbte, * a la tbte d’une mission d’experts sovietiques. 1 ’arrives d'une haute personnalite sovietique avec une mission specials a interesse 1 ’opinion publique et beaucoup d’hypotheses ont ete emises a ce sujet sans qu’aucun renseignement officiel concernant les buts de cette mission ait ete fourni.- -14 - En vue de la sauvegarde des interSts du yays, les signataires du pro jet de loi qui suit le presentent'et en demandent la ratification .avec mention de double urgence: Article I - Aucun president du conseil ou ministre oii leurs gerents ou leurs sous-secretaires d’etat ne peuvent proceder a des discussion officielles ou ayant un caractere legal, ou.bien signer un accord concernant la concession du petrole avec aucun des representants officieux des pays voisins ou non ou les representants des compagnies petrolieres ou toute autre personne. Article 2 - Le president du conseil et les ministres peuvont s‘entretenir pour la vente du petrole et sur la maniere dont le gouvernement iranien precede a 1 ’exploitation et a 1 ’administration de ses puits de .petrole et en informer le Parlament. article 5 - Les contrevenants seront condamnes a un emprisonnement allant de trois a huit ans et a la privation definitive de fonctions etatiques. article L ~ La poursuite des contrevenants de la Cour de Gassotion n’exige pas cette intentee au prealable par le Parlement ou autorisee par lui. Le procureur a le droit de poursuivre les contrevenants a cette loi conformement a la loi des poursuites contre les ministres approuvee les 16 et 20 Tyr Mah 130 ?. Immediatement, de nombreux deputes signerent la proposition qui fut mise aux debats. Apres 1’intervention de plusieurs deputes, les trois premiers articles furent approuves, I’article 4 ayant ete retire par le Dr. Mossadegh lui-mSme.' The effect of this would seem to be that until this bill is withdrawn, by means of special legislation, it will be exceeding ly difficult, if not impossible, for any foreign group or power even to begin any discussion regarding petroleum concessions, with any responsible officials of the Persian Government. And in consequence the immediate prospects for any legal and agreed -upon exploitation of Persian oil resources are very poor except in so far as these resources have already been conceded or are looked upon as having alre ady been co nceded. The resources of the Kavir-i-Khourian fall presumably into this latter category. 18, General . From the evidence at our disposal, the prospects of large quantities of oil being produced from the structural fold'* actually known as the Kavir-i-Khourian do not seem to be very good, and the fold itself is not very extensive in comparison with similar features in the neighbourhood. Further to the south the size of the folding increases (the attached photo graphs of the Kuh-i-Gugird will give some idea of this), and should oil be found here or in one of the adjacent folds it would perhaps be found in great quantity. But the potential importance of the Kavir-i-Khourian region lies equally as much perhaps in the conjunction of two other things. Firstly the absence of any real geographical boundaries on the ground and secondly the absence of any definition of boundaries in the original Farman. It is by no means difficult to see for example that the petroleum rights granted by this document are capable of a veryr ■p x‘ ; #r-., V. ' W vi i j Q45 j elastic interpretation both in timA nnd ryprrecr —fi should also not bo overlooked that with modern equipment large parts of the Great Kavirare no longer impassable and that what was relatively ^^impossible in 1380 has become relatively easy in 1945 . i _ The founders of the Kavir-i-Khouriau Company are by now old men or dead, and it may be taken that the company is nov, to ■ all intents and purposes an organisation of the Soviet Government in Persia. Although its history shows that its progress has been rather a matter of chance than of continuous design, this organi sation can now be made to operate^ behind a prescriptive right of some twenty years standing and also behind a cloak of legality v/hich might be difficult to dispute. This, in spite of the fact that the terms of the original Par man bear no relation whatever to a modern concession agreement. The soviet Government hate been checked for the present, as far as the legal occupation of other petroleum regions in N. Persia is concerned, whether or not they will now proceed to use their established position in the Kavir-i-Khourian as an instrument for the furtherance of their policy remains to bo seen. 20 th September, 194a.

Suggestion was submitted by Eden, and supported by Stettinius that the three Governments agree to refrain from seeking petroleum rights in Persia so long as foreign troops were in that country. Suggestion was refused by Molotov on these grounds: it was unnecessary since tension in Persia had passed; furthermore Russia felt free to revive concession question directly with Persia whenever it deemed appropriate. Should Persian officials approach you on the subject you should say that the three Foreign Ministers discussed Persian matters briefly, that Russia appeared not to have given up hope of obtaining an oil concession and that there was no question of deviating from declaration on Persia.

Some weeks ago when Russian interference in the North was at its height, Minister for Foreign Affairs sent Soviet Ambassador a protest which he worded very ingeniously as a reply to M.

He informs me that he has now received an extremely conciliatory reply disclaiming any intention to interfere in internal situation in Persia. Minister for Foreign Affairs was inclined to attribute this result to the resolute stand he had made but although I congratulated him I suggested that the attitude of the Soviet Government might have been affected by enquiries made of Soviet Government by the British and United States Governments about the oil crisis and scepticism with which exaggerated Soviet propaganda had been met abroad, especially in the United States. M. Intizam admitted these factors must have had important influence. 2. Tudeh published notice announcing a meeting for March 2nd in front of their Tehran office.

Interview between British Military Attache^ and new Persian Chief of Staff. In his two hour conversation with the British Military Attache, General Arfa, the new Persian Chief of Staff, showed himself concerned with the 'Situation in the South' and the hostility to the Central Government of Nasir Khan Qashgar who, it was rumoured in Pars,enjoyed British support. In reply, General Praser emphasized that Pritish policy throughout had been to support the Persian Government and to endeavour to increase its authority. He suggested that rather than embark on lengthy military operations for tribal disarmament, it would be better for the Central Government to gain the confidence of the tribes allied to the Qashgat who on the whole were anxious for a quiet life, and thus to weaken Nasir's position: if the Boir Amadi were subdued, it was probable that the Qashgar would give little trouble.

F th j Januai ^ i i9k5 /L&gt; // 5&gt;S ^ * 0 / , Dear Baxter, ao\&gt;c .11345 I enclose a cojoy of an interesting minute by our Military Attache on a recent conversation with General Arfa, the new Chief of Staff. Two or three months ago the Shah said that he was convinced that we were supporting the central Government and not the tribes (he almost said he was now convinced, as though he had thought for three years that I was lying to him on this point). He had very good reason to come to that conclusion, in view of the wide liberty which we have given to the 4 Persians to disarm the Arabs near our bases in Khuzistan. General Arfa, however, as reported in paragraph 2 of General Eraser 1 s minute, 'seems to suspect that we are after all pursuing a pro-tribe policy, and I have no doubt that the Shah is suspicious too. There has been much in the pro-Soviet newspapers about the formation of a tribal bloc in Pars under ' imperialist' influence, though in fact the conference which took place some months ago between Dasir, Qawam al MuIk and Morteza Quli Bakhtiari was organised without our encouragement. f You will agree that General Praser talked good I sense to General Arfa and rubbed into him some salutary I I truths. I am sending copies of this letter and of its enclosure to the General Officer Commanding in Chief in Bagdad, to Caroe in Hew Delhi and to CrOft in Cairo. Copies of the enclosure alone have gone to Isfahan. Shiraz, Ahwaz and Bushire. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) R. Bullard. C.W. Baxter, &amp;sn. , C.i.i.G. , i.i.C., Poreign Office. tv lO . O. ’ RECd. POL.

I i uH I Q 45 Chief oT^ths Among other matters he talked of what he called the Situation in the South. The JShah had instructed him to discuss \i this with me. It seems that the Shah when picturing to you /y ” 7 || and Sir Arthur Smith the Persian Army fighting desperate delaying actions against the Russians had mentioned the necessity for the security of the rear. 2. The Shah had recently sent a special officer to investigate conditions in the South. • He did not trust Piruz who v/as much more concerned with the furtherance of his personal ambitions than with service to his Sovereign and his country. He was disturbed by the report he had received. Nasir Qashgai, he knew, was hostile to him; he was still a rebel; he was steadily increasing his influence; Piruz was not checking it, and there was a very general impression among the tribes and people of Pars that Nasir had British support and that the British were trying to establish their influence among the tribes of the South with a view to using them to protect their interests in the South and in the Persian Gulf. The Shah, according to Arfa, seemed to think that that might indeed be British policy; but it was a desperate one. He (the Shah or Arfa or both) believed that the interests of Great Britain were best served by a strong Central Government with its authority established throughout the country. A policy of supporting the tribes was disintegrating and could only be justified if we thought that n i the Central Government would fall under Russian influence. That I would never happen. The Shah, every one of his officers, every J soldier would shed his last drop of blood to prevent it. (There was much more in this vein). 3. I said that if the Shah and General Arfa considered the advice we had given during the last three years to the Persian Government, to Persian officials and to any tribal chiefs our officials had met they would understand my amusement at what he had just said. No one was more anxious for a Persia unified under a strong central Government than K.M. A ibassador; no one had done more to endeavour to increase the prestige and authority of the Central Government than British officials; certainly not ^ Cabinet Ministers nor Persian officials,- whose actions had brought the Central Govefnment into general disrepute. 4* As regards the South we had a perfectly clear conscience. In order to allow the Persian Government to increase their prestige and authority we had with some misgivings and at some risk to our war interests agreed to the disarmament of the Arabs of Khuzestan although they were on the whole so anxious for our good will that there was little danger of their acting against our interests. /e agreed solely in the interests of the Central Government. In the early days after Nasir’s escape from Tehran to Pars we had counselled the Persian Government in their own interests to take action before he established himself; later ^ | when we knew that Nasir was harbourin,; Germans and making /aerodromesjaerodromes for them we had demanded that action should be I taken in our interests. The action taken by the Persian !Government, in spite of an initial success, which if followed jup should have finished the matter, led to the disaster of I Semirum. Since then we had repeatedly been told that the Persian forces were not strong enough to fight Nasir and that the Persian Government must temporize with him. Sven then we consistently deprecated the policy of excessive pandering to Nasir and Khosrow that was followed by General Jahanban^L and approved, we understood by Cabinet Ministers. We had even suggested to the Persian Government that they should declare him an outlaw and his lands confiscated. Since the Persian authorities showed no signs of being able to force Nasir to surrender the Germans with him we had been obliged to take our own measures. When Nasir had surrendered the Germans to us v we told him that we would no longer regard him as an enemy provided he was law-abiding and obedient to his own Government. / Nasir must be well aware that far from getting any support from us he would incur at least our displeasure if he took any action against the Central Government or the integrity of Persia. So that he should not come to get an exaggerated idea of his importance we advised Governors General to maintain contact with the Kalantars of sub-tribes. We deprecated the giving of the tea, sugar and cloth rations of the whole tribe to Nasir for distribution. We still deprecate weakness that connives at any increase of his influence outside '^ashgai. We urged and still urge that the Mamassanni should be conciliated and attached to the Government so that they should not submit to Nasir. It was the inability of the Government to give protection that forced tribes and individuals to come to terms with Nasir. Did the Shah now propose to challenge Nasir, to disarm the •Qashgai? Had he thought v/hat that meant? It would necessitate operations against the Kuh i Galu tribes as well as allotting forces to watch the Bakhtiari. Speaking as a friend I thought he would be very foolish in present circumstances to commit the greater part of the effective strength of the Persian Army to what must at best be a very lengthy operation. Was he quite sure that there was no possibility of a disaster which would make the situation much worse than it was before? Were there any plans for administrative and economic arrangements that must obviously follow operations? In my view the elimination of Nasir and the disarmament of the tribes could be achieved with very little fighting when the time came, provided that in the meantime the Government followed a consistent policy of gaining the confidence of the tribes, of shov/ing by deeds that they took an interest in their welfare and intended to assist them to become prosperous and productive subjects. The tribes, except perhaps some of the Boir Ahmadi, did not want to fight the Government, and my information was that Nasir f s position was not so very strong nor was he so attached to it that he could not be persuaded to go and live on his estates at Piruzabad. The tribal problem would be three-fourth solved when the tribes were persuaded that they were secure against the oppression they had suffered in Reza Shah’s days. I thought that the Boir Ahmadi might probably have to be subdued by force - an operation not to be lightly undertaken. When that was successfully achieved I did not think that there wou^d be much trouble from the Qashgai. *•••••••••»*i J M ‘-V Q 5o General Arfa was unwilling to Persian Army (now that it was inspired by him) would have anything but a series of glorious victories against the ^ashgai. That I'Tasir or anyone else should dare to be not completely/ sub missive to the orders of a Central Government who had at their disposal an Army commanded by the Shah and directed by General Arfa seemed to be a maddening thought to him. But he rather grudgingly admitted conviction that the tine was unsuitable for extensive operations in the South. He said that a conference was to be held of various experts including Colonel Himmat, the commander of the Pars Division, who is here now, and General Piruz, who is being summoned, to discuss future policy in the South. He would info-rm me of their recomraenda- tions before anything was finally decided. He thought that it should be possible to insist on Nasir being confined to the Piruzabad area, that is south of the Shiraz-Kazarun road. I remarked that in that case he would have to be relieved of any responsibility Piruz had imposed on him for maintaining order among the Qashgai. 6. General Arfa is a difficult man. He has a verj r suspicious mind and is unwilling to accept the obvious explana tion if he can think of a more malicious'one. He rather 1 despises the son of Pahlevi as a man, but worships him as Shahinshabt of Persia. Vhile recognizing that there are bad Persians, he would never admit that the Persians were inferior to any other race. He is extremely touchy over imagined insults to Persia, infringements of her independence, inter ference by foreigners. He is narrow-minded, hot-tempered and hasty. He and the Shah together are capable of foolish actions. And he is very anxious to get on the right side of the Shah. TSHPAI.. 14th January, 1945.OUTWARD TELEGRAM &gt; PILE COPIgEGRET r !?

Officer Commanding and myself. I reminded His Majesty that he himself always placed morale in the army and population first, and I suggested resistance to unjust demands from any quarter would depend, in the first place on whether the people as a whole were contented.^ The Shah agreed and talked much about the inertia of successive Governments. I pointed out the published programme of Tudeh party was moderate and that the Persian Government which opposed Tudeh and yet put [group undec.: ?forth] no reforms themselves could not expect to receive our backing indefinitely. 2. As to the military plan which the Shah had put forward, here again the first thing was to make the private soldier more contented e.g. by ensuring that he received the food and clothing to which he was entitled. The plan itself, albeit defensive, might if it became known to the Russians be regarded as part of an offensive plan and the Persian Government might be accused as Saed was of wishing to make use of Persia as a base for Fascist aggression against Russia. The Shah agreed that the Russians might even believe so extravagant an hypothesis but said that the plan would of course be known only to one or two senior officers. 3 * I do not feci the plan would in fact develop so fast that it would mean anything to anybody for a long time to come. The Shah agreed that the first task of the army would be the maintenance of internal security, and that will take some years to establish throughout the country, and can hardly bo maintained without dispersal of the troops, suc^h as would be incompatible with the Shah’s scheme. Moreover, lack- 2 - of funds and Persian inertia and corruption will delay the scheme at every step. 4. The Shah spoke to the Air Attachd a few days ago about Persian Air Force as part, of his schene for a fighting organisation, but in our conversation he suggested for the projected large air force a wide 'dispersal for the maintenance of security and said nothing-about a concentration against ...... potential enemy from the north. Perhaps the words of caution about e.g. length of training for pilots of modern aircraft which the Air Attachd had uttered to His majesty had already influenced him. 5. I did not adopt attitude -of violent discouragement. Circumstances will probably be discouraging enough and, if we find later that the Shah is in fact pursuing a plan which might lead him and us into trouble, we can apply the brake then. OTP.

Soviet Ambassador wrote to me on January 15th protesting against suppression by British Section of Censorship or various Soviet newspapers (none of them official) and of a history of all Union Communist Party. . I thought that the best way to deal with this complaint was to inform Foreign Office and not (repeat not) to rocoivo a reply which is the procedure from which we suffer so often at Soviet hands and I wrote Baxter to that effect on January 26th. M. Maximov has now sent another complaint about the suppression of several unofficial Soviet newspapers and one number of Izvestia. 5. In both letters it is alleged that no grounds exist to justify suppression. As you are aware Soviet Section of Censorship has suppressed wholesale masses of material from England and America which seemed to us harmless or even valuable. We have never questioned its right to do so under existing charter though we have several times asked in vain for a reasonable explanation of its actions and urged expediency of a more liberal attitude. I consider therefore that British Section’s right to condemn material cannot be questioned and that the only reason it need give for its decision is that in its opinion the material in question is likely to prejudice the friendly relations between the Allied Governments. There is nothing in the memorandum of February 7th 1942 which protects from suppression a newspaper containing material likely to prejudice etc. merely because it professes to be official, Izvestia can be as scurrilous about the Polish Government in London as any only [sic: ?other] Soviet newspaper. 4. All Soviet material condemned by us has been addressed to private individuals or non-official institutions. Soviet Section on the other hand has repeatedly violated the terms of the charter by condemning material addressed to Persian Departments of State.vs Pi - 2 - 5.

It was eufigeeted to ;.im after his speech of the 29th October that a bill should be presented pemitting the government to sign on agreement, but as the Foreign Represent tivee had left Persia and ^•ia had declared that he was not prepared to enter into awr discussions about oil he did not tiJLnk it worthy of pursuit! o*vevcr, after the appearance of the Tines editorial, and in view 01 tne fact that certain deputies proposed to present a Bill prohibiting a*y citocuseion of oil concessions by Uie government until six months after the cessation of hostilities, he found it necessary to table the Oil Bills he personally was opposed to the granting of any concession n&lt; any time# His Oil Law was drafted to assure Persia*© interests, anu in order not to close the way for discussion with Foreign authorities on the manner in which Persian oil was to be exploioou# ho other person was aware of tnis bill before he tabled it in the Majlis; during his whole life he hud never alloweu uimbelf to be influenced by others, and he had never put his own in teres to before tx.ose of the public# He had fought against dict^torsliip under Riia Shah's regime, he had been in prison anu only releaaao when the Soviet goverrment intervened in Persian politics; there was no proof that he a proved any one policy or opposed the policy of the Soviet government# ^ _ Durin^ the dark days Russia had rendered great services to Persian independence, and to ^ive them cause for anxiety was the greataat treachery# He hoped that Russian statesmen would not listen to the mistake and advice* given them by bad elements in Persia, If ;{ut&gt;sia chose to hold aloof from Persia's international policy then Persia's very existence would be difficult# Elements were at work in Persia to promote internal strife and friction which threatened Persia's existence; all Persians should Join together in producing one single policy and should move forward to a common goal# Turning to De uty Pishav&amp;ri, he said that his object in presenting hie oil bixl was not to snow that he objected to the J oviet regime but was f*on patriotic motives; Persia needed the oil herself and it *oula be /unlawfulo unlawful to aiapoee of it to foreign countries. Until the goal of every country was one each country nust follow its own particular policy; the aim of every democratic party in every country was tne same tut policies differed in different countries. He denied that he had rendered the A. I.O.C. any service in presenting his bill; who could say that his proposal that . ere&gt;- sho x.. develop her own oil resources was contrary to Persia's interest. £ 3 ne writers had stated that the reason for refusing the soviet request for an oil concession in the Horth was that the oil deposits should not be exploited, but that the matter should bs left in abeyance until the British were powerful enough to exploit it themselves. If u*e British ever did obtain such power it v.ould make little difference if Russia were granted a concession because the British could occupy the oil fields already exploited. Modern Persia was very different from Persia at the time of the D'Arcy concession; at that time few Prrsians knew the meaning of the word concession, ana oil did not p-ay the same important part in international politics as it did to-day. Hot one metre of railway line hao been laid when the concetsion . ^ f ran ted: the trane-Iranian railway was constructed as a result oi the ncome Persia derived from her shares. To-day it was the wish ox all Persians that a Company should be fonned and capital raises which . ersia could take advantage of; the granting of foreign concessions would present the expansion of Persian Trade. He was not suggesting that Persia should build a wall around herself like the Chinese and prevent others from making use of the resources God had given her; but Persia should protect her own interests like other nations. Reply in: to those who criticised him for not signing the bill for the cancellation of the A. I.O.C. concessions br. Hueaddiq said that tnere were two parties to every agreement; until both parties agreed on the annulment of an agreement it could not be annulled. If he hau signed the bill, other bills would have been presented, e.g. for the cancellation I of the Russo-Pereian friendship pact, which he would have been forced to sign and difficulties would thus be created with Persia's neighbours which would be very difficult of solution. that haa happened in the past was past; Persia should not settle old accounts I with her neighbours by taking away what had been given if itwas considered too much, or by giving to otners on the grounds that tuey hao received too little; . 'a passive balance' required that in future nothing should be given to any government against Persia's interests. He opposed the government* s bill for the abrogation of Millspaugh s powers on the grounds that the bill would not improve the situation. He therefore tabled the following bill with a request lor double urgency.INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, LONDON, S.W. 1.SECRET [CYPHER] ' ^\JL_ ^Aaa£^L£&gt;V &lt; 3«L4C&gt;nCA^XVJL| ci' l^ui, 6:^21 With the Compliments •f the Uaior Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs 1 FEB ms DEPARTMENTAL NQ.l.

To provide figures is extremely difficult but the .general position is as follows 1) Until about a year ago the Russians refused to pay custom dues on their imports into Persia. They now pay, but only on their own estimate of what is due, and they do not allow Persian customs officials to check the estimate, or even to see the goods. 2 ) They demand cash down for all sales to the Persian Government, but are dilatory in paying for purchases from the Persian Government. The amount owing to the Persian Government on this account (apart from munitions factories) is approximately rials 1 million. 5) Just as the Persian Government were recently asked to give the Russians an oil concession in principle no terms being stated, so the original agreement about munitions included no provision for price • Prices have now been fixed and on that basis the Russians have paid rials 10 million and owe about rials 100 million. Transaction will result in loss but calculation of the amount is very difficult because the Russians have supplied some machinery and raw materials which the Persian Government hrve to pay for. The Russians are paying rials 910 or £7. 2 s. per rifle. For rifles taken over by the Russians from the Persians after the occupation we paid £7 apiece which was the price the Persian Government had paid the Czechs for these BRNO rifles, made by mass production, out of material and with labour at pre-war prices, 'it is obvious that there must be heavy loss on rifles made here during the last two ye.ars and sold at £7. 2s. 4 ) Barter arrangements in 1945, under which the Persians gave rice in exchange for goods, resulted in loss to Persia estimated at about 250,000,000 rials Russian goods consisted^ to a considerable extent of things like empty bottles for which there was no demand and crockery of such a kind that it could only be sold at a great loss. But for Millspaugh Persian Government would have been forced to accept similar arrangement m 1944. 5) \mmm . 5)* The Russians iniport .and SjqII large quantities of ' sugar and piece goods in the open market thereby contributing to inflation. Some of these imports were probably obtained - at low prices from Japan. Sale of sugar is particularly imprudent because (a) it is sold wholesale a.t rials 70 a kilo (until recent fall in prices it was sold at over 100 rials) to merchants who retail it at rials 80 or rials 90. (b) sugar sold to the Persian Government by us is retailed to the public under ration.scheme at about rials 20 a kilo. (c) Russia has had large quantities of sugar from us and from the United Sta.tes at a very low price under Lease/Lend. 6 ). Iransovtrans which is a Soviet Government organisation is doing commercial transport business in Persia without licences. ^ 7) • The Russians have done everything in their power to hamper H Millspau'gh s attempt to effect financial and economic improvements in the north, by refusing for long periods to give passed to his assistants and by compelling those to/whom.-they do give passes to return to Tehran after short periods to have pass renewed, (no pass however has been renewed) and so on. On this point however the Russians would claim to be defending Persian independence against imperialist penetration. O.T.P.OUTWARD TELEGRAM @) [CTPHiK] DEPiiRTMMTiJj NO. 1.

Direct or indirect references to British interference in the elections are frequent. One newspaper alleges that whereas the Russians imposed eight deputies on the North the British imposed 80 on the South and West, the Majlis rescinded the oil concessipn law these accusations might be dropped but as they seem decided not to rescind it the attacks may be expected to continue. 2.

THE Persian Ambassador called on the Permanent Under-Secretary of State on the 16th January to discuss the present position in his country. 2. M. Taqizadeh said that he had received instructions from his Govern ment to bring the facts before His Majesty’s Government so that the latter might have them in mind in the event of a meeting of the three Heads of Governments in the near future. 3 His Excellency said that Russian pressure in Northern Persia was steadily increasing. The Soviet authorities refused to allow Persian armed forces to enter the region where they were in control, and the Russians could terrorise the population into making such manifestations as they themselves desired. They were also pressing for the repeal of the recent oil concession law, but it was impossible for the Persian Government to agree to this. Generally, the Persian Government were determined to maintain firmly the position which they had so far held. The Ambassador declared that he could not understand the' motives behind the Soviet action. It could not really be the need for oil. He said that he had recently read a translation of an extract from an article in M^ar and the Working Class, in which it was said that Russia herself did not need the oil, but wished to deny it to the Americans and British.

The Minister for Foreign Affairs did not hide his own hostility to the proposal. He said that he had pointed out to the Prime Minister tnat whereas an Ambassador can always refer back to his Government, the Prime Minister would be expected to give final reply and that in any case, it was unlikely that a mission could get to Moscow and accomplish important results before the conference. 3. I asked whether the Persian Government had received reply to their proposal mentioned in my telegram under reference. No official reply, he said, but the Soviet Ambass ador had telephoned to the Persian Ambassador to Moscow who is still here saying that he knew when he sent j.t on that the Persian proposal would not appeal to his Government, and that this had now been confirmed. 4. I said I should not like to give final advice on such a delicate matter but experience since the last war, with which the Minister for Foreign Affairs was familiar, had shov/n that to be successful, conferences should only take place when the ground had been well prepared. The intention night be to propose mission as a proof of goodwill, counting from the start on a rejection but it wouldbe well to allow for the^possibility of acceptance, what would be the position of the rrime Minister if he'went to Moscow only to announce that he would not make any advance on what he had already said on the oil question? I added that for the information of M.

To prepare plans and projects for the improvement of the position of peasants and workers. The basic purpose of these plans, which will be submitted to the Majlis in the form of various bills, is that everyone who works should receive an income proportionate to his pains; that that income should be properly assured; that he should be immune from fear of unemployment, poverty, oppression and wrong; and that he may be able to pursue his avocations without anxiety. 2. To develop the public health system of the country; to make doctors and medicines available for all, so far as possible; to combat disease as soon as it appears; and to take immediate measures for the treatment of the sick. 3. To enforce completely the Free and Compulsory Education Law; i.e. to train teachers and build (primary) schools in sufficient number; . so that in ten years 1 time all the sons of Iran will have had a free education. 4. To reform radically all Ministries and Government departments and reorganise them on a firm and strong basis. 5. To prepare broad economic and agricultural plans for the development and progress of agriculture and industry, the con struction and completion of reservoirs and dams, and the exploita tion of mines and subterranean resources; and to establish companies to this end. Bills to this end will shortly be presented to the Majlis. The Government is confident that with the execution of these plans new employment will be provided, and that the people, especially the workers, will be able to profit in the best way from the exploitation of resources. 6. To revise certain existing laws - especially the Provincial and Local Councils Law, which, after elimination of its defects, will be passed by the Majlis and urgently brought into force.

According to travellers reaching Cairo from Persia,. although since departure of Kavtaradze overt pressure on the Persian Government and organised Tudeh party demonstrations have, diminished and there is even a superficial detente, nothing is in fact changed. Many Persians resident in North Persia are being invited by local Persian officials under Russian pressure to leave their homes at shortest notice and proceed southwards. Several have published their impressions in the press. Certain newspapers published in Tehran which do not support Soviet policy are prevented by Russians from reaching readers in North Persia. Persian Government is flooded with telegrams from the North all bearing mark of common origin. Most of them demand amongst other things the creation of local councils project for which members of Tudeh party(the only party allowed to work freely in the North) are working feverishly* It is generally agreed by educated Persians that decentralisation and enlistment of local enthusiasm in the management of local affairs are desirable but the fact that demand for this reform comes so. insistently from a party which in the matter of oil concession espouses Russian demand in toto is naturally the object of anxious comment.

My government are not equally clear as to the athtidE of the Soviet Government in this matter. The reports which they received from Tehran at the time of the fall of the Saed Government suggested that the Soviet Government did not intend for the time being to press further the question of the grant of an oil concession to them in Northern Iran. The continued presence in Iran of M. Kavtaradze, however, and the tone of certain articles which have appeared in the Soviet press on the situation in Iran, seem to indicate that this may not be the case. 3. My government feel some concern on this account, because it is, in their view, of real importance that the co-signatories of the Tehran declaration.^should pursue towards Iran a policy conceived on similar lines and followed in consultation between each other. 4.

The Soviet Section however, refused to abstain, so I requested British Section to express regret to Soviet Section that so long as , the latter continued this practice, British Section would I examine all parcels addressed to Soviet Trade Delegation [ (who are the main channel through which Russian publicat ions are put on Persian market and for whom Soviet authorities claim diplomatic privilege;) at the same time British Section should reiterate suggestion that both sections should cease to conduct political censorship. 4. The question now arises whether we should or should not put on the i ersian market copies of publications condemned by Soviet censorship which reach us by channels not liable to censorship e.g. F.R.B. bag from Cairo (which comes by military forwarding officer). I think it is undesirable that F.R.B. should sell such publications in their own shops, but I am reluctant to forbid their distribution to private book-sellers, for Soviet censorship has by now condemned a wide range of publicat ions, mostly on preposterous grounds, many of them standard works such as H.A.L. Fisher s History of Europe. • I should be grateful for instructions on this aspect. 5.

QQQQQQ Secret. s Hearing that G.O.C.-in Chief was to be in Tehran, the Shah asked to see him. Yesterday I took Sir Arthur ^lith to the palace together with the now Air Officer Commanding. 2* I have heard much un-wisdom from the Shah but never so much as on this occasion. Conversation which was mainly monologue lasted for li hours but can be summarised auite briefly. 3. General Smith asked tentatively whe-ffher^restriction of functions of American military Mission to the Orient was in best interests of Persian Army. The Shah said the Persian officer was as good as any other in the world. All the army needed was up to date material. It could not resist modem tanks with pre-war anti-tank guns. 4. General Smith explained that in speaking of wider functions for the American Military Mission he had in his mind the position of such emblems as the purpose of the Persian Army. On this point ihe Shah was already quite clear in his mind. The purpose of the army was to fight a delaying action (against Russians) to give time for the main body to retreat to the mountains where it could hold out until some undefined help could arrive. (Tribes occupying mountains would have.to be disarmed beforehand lest they should be unable to resist temptation to stab the army inthe back). Delaying action would require not only strong defensive armament for ground troops but also (and this was where British help would be particularly useful) pov/erful Persian Air Force Army would of course have to be highly mobile. 5. Judging by the behaviour of the Persian Army.when Russian forces entered Persia in 1941, I concluded that it would never lack mobility in retreat especially in the higher ranks but we could not say so to the Shah. General Smith spoke of the advantage enjoyed by a powerful attacking army with a large air force which can land men behind opponents line. I changed the conversation at a point where it seemed that the Shah might almost propose a military alliance between Persia and Great Britain against Russia. The conversation was embarrassing as frankness m conversation with the Shah is1 2 - t * hampered when other persons are present. I played the usual cards t of^League of Nations, interest of all countries in each other,s.Government, interest in each other’s fate, contented population as the best defence against foreign enemies and so on but subject to your approval I shall suggest next time. I see the Shah that concentration of army plsns upon schemes such as he^ outlined would .probably not attain the desired result in. the face of attack by sucn forces as the Russians could •^hri&amp;g up wjiereas the mere existence of plan which would ' inevitably become known to the Russians would exacerbate feeling and perhaps provoke attack,. line in _ _ 6 * I. trust you will approve of my taking this li: ana discouraging the Shah s hope that we might assist him _ the formation of a large military air force disproportionate to the country s real needs. The Shah will probably repeat the.remark made yesterday that such scheme is essential to satisfy honour. Unfortunately the unspoken attitude of caution of Persian officers is M wh 6 hath honour? he that died on Wednesday'. 7. Sir A.Smith has seen and concurs.

Repeated to Tehran No. 9 IMDIA DIRECT Washington No.156 Government~c£ India No.- M.E.Min Saving No. 2 — J have received from Soviet aUnhassador a note dated December 29th which, after a reference to your notes of November 2nd and November 20th on the subject of Persia, proceeds as follows: ' .In-September the Soviet Government despatched to Persia a Government commission, headed by M. C.I. Kavtaradze, Deputy People s Commissar for Foreign Affairs, to discuss with the Persian Government the grant to the Soviet Union of an oil concession in the northern regions of Persia. The terms of the proposed agreement, which the Soviet Government contemplated concluding with the Government rf Persia on this subject, wdre very profitable and favorable to Persia., and naturally in no wise infringed the sovereignty or independence of the latter. It was intended at the same time to take into consideration any wishes from the Persian side and to initiate the practical discussion of the terms of an agreement in the spirit of friendship and alliance existing between the two countries. At. the outset of the discussions, M. Saed, the head of the Persian Government,, declared himself favourably disposed towards^ the Soviet proposals. On this basis the Soviet commission^commenced their preparatory labours connected with the discussions. A month later, however, the attitude of M. Saed s # Government altered under the influence of pressure behind, the scenes, and M. Saed unexpectedly returned to the Soviet commission a refusal to grant the concession. The Government of M. Saed did not even attempt to become acquainted with the Soviet terms for the concession which, as the Soviet Government expected, would be examined by tne representatives of both sides under conditions of free discussion •• and consideration of mutual interests. Thus li, Saed's Government carried on the negotiations in a x?? J ? n ? r obviously disloyal to the Soviet party. This disloyal attitude on the part of M. Saed to the proposals of the Soviet Government, who were sincerely striving to discover means for the practical cpnclusion of an important economic agreement with Persia, which would harmonise with the interests of both countries and afford Persja considerable economic assistance, together with other facts affording evidence of the hostile attitude of M. Saed in a series of /questions RECo. PCL ESP* - ^ JAN WS INDIA- 2 - questions relating to Soviet-Persian co-operationj, not fail to evoke a negative reaction from the publ opinion and press of the Soviet Union. could ' ic As may he gathered from subsequent events in Persia, the hostile line adopted by the former Prime Minister Saed in relation to the U.S.S.R. was condemned by many Persian , politicians and wide circles of public opinion in Persia; Such are the facts of the case regarding the Spviet proposals for* an oil concession in Persia. The Soviet Government consider it necessary to mention these facts in order that the British Gqvernmeht may be in possession of correct information on this question. At the same time the Soviet Government cannot pass, over the unfavourable altitude adopted by the British in relation t^theS ovist-Persian negotiations for an oil concession. The Soviet Government are unable to agree with the contention that the grant of an oil concession to the Soviet Union can possibly affect the sovereignty of Persia* Should the validity of such arguments be acknowledged, they would apply first and foremost-to Great Britain who, as is well known, has'long held a substantial oil concession in Persia. Ifi the opinion of the Soviet Government, there are likewise no practical grounds.for. asserting that the . question of the grant of an oil concession to the Soviet Union cannot be decided at the present time, and that it must be deferred to the post-war period. The former Government of M. Saed were unable to produce a.single convincing argument in support of this contention. The Soviet proposals fcr an oil concession in Persia do not in any way conflict with the treaty of alliance with Persia of 1942, or with the declaratiqn made by the Three Powers in 1943 on the subject of Persia. On the contrary, the proposals are in complete harmony with the letter and the spirit of both the above-mentioned instruments, which moreover contemplated the necessity of the.Allies according economic assistance to Persia. It is obvious that a favourable decision on the question of granting the Soviet Union an oil concession would assist’in the further development of amicable Soviet-Persian relations, and at the same time would be one of the methods for giving considerable economic assistance to Persia. In this sense the Soyiet proposals for a concession, fully comply with the obligations which the Allies, and in particular xhe Soviet Government, undertook in regard te Persia, doth in the treaty of alliance with that country and in the Three Power declaration regarding Persia. The following additional considerations may be added:- , Early/OUTWARD TELEGRAM -3- Early in December, concealed from.public opinion and in conflict with Persian constitutional rules, M. Saed the former Prime Minister, in company with a certain Seyid Zia—ed-Din; succeeded in getting a resolution adopted by the Majlis forbidding the members of the Persian Government to enter into negotiations with any party on the subject of oil concessions. In this connexion M. S.I. Kavtaradze, the Deputy People's Commissar, visited the new Prime Minister or Persia and, by directionof the Soviet Government, made a declaration containing.the statement that, in the opinion of the Soviet Government, the above-mentioned resolution regarding oil concessions ought to be reconsidered, as it had been adopted under the influence of the intrigues of. hostile elements, such as Saed, Seyid, Zia-ed-Dm and others. Besides this, the said resolut^n is inconsistent with the fact that a large oil concession held by a foreign Power exists on Persian territory. Having made this declaration, S.I. Kavtaradze returned to Moscow. In informing the Government of Great Britain of the foregoing, the Soviet Government consider.it necessary to state that in the matter of an.oil concession in Persia they adhere to the position, set forth in the present note and in particular in the above-mentioned declaration made by M, S*I # Kavtar adze. the Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, to the new Prime Minister of Persia, [Copies sent to Mr. Wiltshire], (OTP)OUTWARD TELEGRAM ^ 5.^ F f With the Complimeiiia^ rhe Under Secretary of Static Cur IFordi^n Arfctlr* H »&gt; r * ' ' v - «■» ”♦ ^ 4 % I 1 T ^ | Q 45 *•—&gt;^his telegram is of particular secrecy and should be'YSfaiftSil by the authorised recipient and not passed on] (E. 7848/94/54) [CYPHER] WAR CiiBINET DISTRIBUTION FROM FOREIGN OFFICE TO TEHRAN No. 15 D # 5. 5 p.m. 6 th January, 1945 6 th January, 1945 Repeated to Moscow No. 89 M.E.Min No. 32 IMPORTANT 7 7 7 ' U- &lt;* c Your telegram No. 1566 [22nd December: publicity for events in Persia]~ I agree that a steady flow of facts to the 1 /rorld press should be maintained.'''But it is Important that this should be /done /wherever possible though pre ss; channel s. ^ Officially^inspired'/comments from riere Inevitably become suspect/if/too/frequent'Ire course ds Ciad to them. ^ / / . .. d ^ / 2 ./You should if necessary usq^ discretion given in • paragraph 2 ofiny telegraiii7No. 781 [o f 20th November: , 57 authority to/send press/messageS through Embassy Channels] In that/event you will/doubtless ensure that terms of message's are/'satisfactory and that/facts are correct.

At a farewell party which was given to jhi who is returning to his post as Persian Ambassador in Moscow there was a conversation between him, Persian Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Soviet Ambassador. Minister for Foreign Affairs has given me the following account* 2. Minister for Foreign Affairs said that Persian Government would show their good intentions. They intended to form a Persian Oil Company for exploration. That, replied Soviet Ambassador was merely the oil concession law over again. Minister for Foreign Affairs said Persian Government knew that Soviet Government had objected to the law in principle but Persian Government were going ahead with their proposal and hoped to convince Soviet Government of its practicability. As to experts, where they could not provide Persians they would try to recruit ,, neutrals ,, and if they failed in this they could apply to Soviet Government. Perhaps Soviet Government could supply on credit machinery and equipment for development though U.S.S.R. was not a manufacturer of such material. If material had to be paid for, Persian Government would naturally expect to buy in the best markets. Soviet Ambassador grumbling [sic] much about alleged scurvy treatment of original Soviet 0ffor which he pretended had not even been examined but Minister for Foreign affairs begged him not to go into old history and in the end M. Maximov said that although it would be impossible to find.neutral experts at present he would report conversation to his Government. 5. Deputies are suspicious of Prime Minister whom they think capable of going too far in promises to Soviet Govern ment. under the now law Prime Minister ought to report to deputies what was said to Soviet Ambassador but the controversy that would arise would probably wreck any chance of an agreement so Prime Minister cannot be blamed for keeping information quiet for the present. I had said nothing to / - /Prime Ministermmm trino Minister or Minister for Foreign .Affairs about recruitment of neutral experts.

Run on kerosene was resumed and is continuing. Daily purchases about 60/709? above l$st year. Increase is probably due in part to malevolent rumours but there are also reasonable causes e.g. early and cold winter, continued high cost and shortage of other forms of fuel and consequent adoption of oil-burning stoves, and change over from gas-oil to kerosene for one type of heating stove (to^ obviate smell) in spite of the fact that more kerosene is required than gas oil and that cost of heating is thereby raised. 2. It may be that some people are merely laying in stocks as a precaution and will soon fall back to their normal level of purchases but I am satisfied that even if the demand continues at its present figure there is no risk of a shortage as the necessary steps to prevent its occurrence have been taken.

Against this risk however must be set' far graver risks inherent in her obtaining of Northern concession. For reasons set forth above this would lead eventually to termination of Persia s [2 grps t undec,] hence incidentally termination of Anglo- r Iranian Oil Company, But even before this happened Russia could, and in my opinion would, use her concessionary powers in the North to render position of Anglo-Iranian § Oil Company impossible e.g, by running Northern concession on an uneconomic basis v/hich would disrupt Anglo-I rani an OH Company labour market: and she would also be able to export Baku oil at cut-throat competitive rates by using Persian oil for her internal needs.

No telegrams are coming through to-day (it is presumed that Russians, are stopping them) but Prime Minister managed to communicate with Shahi by railway telephone. Report he received was that workmen in silk factory attacked gendarmerie v/ho had to fire and rilled two and wounded others and that gendarmes were then arrested by the Russians. 2. Soviet ambassador informed the Prime Minister that in the course of the firing a Soviet soldier was wounded. When the Prime Minister said that he proposed to send a commission to investigate, the rimbassador said with some malice that it would be quite sufficient to serd Surhub the Minister of the Interior. As you know the Russians object to Surhub as a member of Saed Cabinet. 3. The Prime Minister asked what he should do. I said that I would inform you and that meanwhile he had better treat the affair as though it were an ordinary industrial dispute. He suggested sending Dr. Shaikh a very decent official who has had considerable success in settling strikes and I agreed that this was as good a plan as any. It seems unlikely however that Russians and T^deh will allow him to succeed. 4 -. I shall be glad to receive your instructions as to reply which I should give to the Prime Minister.

Existing agreements could not be cancelled by unilateral action or there would next be a bill for cancellation of Persian-Soviet Treaty of 1921. Musaddiq concluded by dealing with demand for a policy of equilibrium by which supporters of Russia mean that because the British have a concession the Russians ought to have one.

I am informed that] Saiyid Zia who has been strongly attacked by Tudeh and was accused by K. of being with Saed. an enemy of Persian-Soviet friendship, published on December 21st in Raadi Imruz declaration which has , I hear, sent, the cost of copies of the newspaper up to over 30/-. The remainder of this telegram gives a summary of declaration. 2. I repudiate accusation that I am anti-Soviet. It was I who welcomed first Soviet representative to Tehran. No patriotic Persian is so foolish as to work against Russia but claim bha’t; northern provinces are a security-zone is only a prelude to further and in the end. total encroachment. Admit-this principle and other countries will claim a security zone. Air power has in fact abolished such bulwarks but in any case the question does not arise for the world which is fighting for peace does not accept lebensraum principle v/hich is what security zone claim amounts to. 3. After the war if Majlis should decide to grant a concession to a foreign power, the U.S.S.R. should receive preference Persia being‘bound to her by-ties of gratitude, admiration and propinquity. 4. Interference by the Allies in internal affairs of Persia is contrary to treaty. Encroachment on Persia’s integrity increases daily. The Persian Government is unable to enforce its ‘authority. British officials in the west and south, and Soviet officials in the north, interfered in elections. This was direct result of Allied troops in the capital and of intimidation of the Central Government. Soviet troops prevent Persians from travelling in their own country. Soviet aumeorities expel Persian citizens from the north. The cabinet has-to get'Soviet permission to send its own deputies to preserve security. The Persians have become suspicious of the political intentions of the Allies. gS'^-vP /N.P* 3. ••••r —2— 5, Even in this atmosphere however, an amicable solution of the oil question could have been reached if the dificulties hadnot been aggravated by statements of K. Tudeh demonstration against Saed and the Russian supporters of the press, 1C was well intentioned but was misled by the Soviet Embassy and Tudeh, Nevertheless his statement was inconsistent with common courtesy and international rights. He had no legal power to break off diplomatic relations. He knew that the Soviet Government had the power to bully us but we did not expect that a Government professing principles of Lenin would support its Embassy in humiliating us especially after sacrifices we had made on its behalf. , 6. , SaecTs one fault was .that he -trusted the Soviet- Government and Stalin's declaration made at Tehran. Demonstrators against him were protected by .Savie.t machine guns and not only in Tehran. Telegrams to our representatives abroad telling or our humiliation were help up by Allied censorship. Tie realised that we had lost our independence. Saed stood firm but the shameful behaviour of our Allies drove him to resign. 7. As to K's statement (a) it is no business of a foreigner to point out the mistakes of the Majlis which is alone competent in such matters and independent. (b) The Majlis was compelled by threats and other mistakes of the Soviet representative in Persia to ban future oil conversations. For my part however, I wished this law to remain valid only so long as Allied armies remained on Persian soil. (o) Foreign concessions already existed when 1921 treaty with Soviet Russia was signed and Anglo Iranian Oil Co, concession still exists. The Allied declaration estops Allied representatives from putting forward interpretations or alterations prejudicial to Persian sovereignty. (d) Majlis decision was not a mistake. Hhether it will be amended depends on whether the Soviet representatives change their policy of interference. It vdll not be amended so long as a single foreign soldier remains on Persian soil nor while the fate of cabinets depends not on the Majlis and the Shah but on foreign embassies and synthetic demonstrations. 8. Our first duty is to clarify our foreign relations* This is impossible without a government which will stand up to foreigners, invite foreign governments to withdraw their troops and refuse to tolerate interx'erence. Declaration should be issued that if our relations are not clarified soon the capital will be moved av/ay from Tehran. Mr. Roosevelt. M. Stalin and Mr,* Churchill have right to know what.their representatives who are interpreters of their declaration, are doing to Persia. The aggressors rely on force, tyranny ana military supremacy: Persia on right and logic. A definte date should be fixed for departure of all foreign troops. This is possible only through a government which will maintain both the integrity of Persia and best relations with the U,S.S.R. This the present government cannot do. O.T.P.

I have spoken strongly to the Shah and Prime Minister on lines laid down in your.paragraph 3, Shah has always pressed for reforms including the breaking up of big estates (he has no estates) and heartily welcomed your recommendation on this point. Prime Minister foresees excellent results not expected by many other people from transfer of Millspaugh s economic pov/ers to himself or his nominees which he hopes to bring about and claims to have planned to distribute essential commodities to rural and tribal areas. He professes to be ready to breai up state lands into small holdings especially for persons displaced by a plan he has in mind to have fewer but better paid officials. 3. Both the Shah and Prime Minister said they realised that northern oil could not be left undeveloped indefinitely. Prime Minister said that he had already planned a bill for presentation to Majlis providing for the formation of a Persian Company to bore for oil. He did not seem to think^it mattered thar in wartime it might be difficult to find foreign experts other than Russian British and American. Persia he said possessed experts - by which he appeared to mean Persians trained by Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. I asked whether a survey &gt; would be made to determine establishment of sites for borings and Prime Minister said that borings would be made at two sites indicated in papers handed by Amiranian Company.

Persians have been able to resist the first Russian attack largely because it was clumsily made. Russians cannot be expected to repeat their mistakes and it seems likely that when they renew pressure on the Persian Government they will do so by more insidious means. They may, for instance, try to blackmail Persian Government by means of threat of social disturbancds or separatist movements in northern provinces (compare your telegrams No. 151 2 [of 8th December ] and No. 1520 110th December P. 3. It therefore seems important that Persian Government should consider urgently means by which they can improve their position vis-b-vis of Soviet Government before pressure is resumed. In particular, it seems desirable that they should (a) take immediate steps to implement measures ol social reform on the lines advocated by Mr. rlarnman ana yourself ( your telegram No. 1291 [ o ,f 4 thPecomb prl) : o (b) take some steos under the powers gp an ted-^y Bill reported'in your telegram No. 1284 [of 3rd December] which would show that they are seriously contemplating alternative methods of exploiting Persian oil deposits. Mr. Butler spoke in the above sense to Persian i\mbass aoor who called on December 13th to say that the new Governm n intended to continue their predecessor^ s policy, and o seek information as to the action which His M Q D^sty s Government had taken in Moscow. If Persian fovernment a o nothing in directions indicated Russians ooul ^P r ?^ ent their attitude as being purely obstructive and dpg-in the-manger. .. K /I'^* »•'••••• I INI !CE.!2 . It is therefore essential that Persian Government should lose no time in taking action. 4. If you see no objection please speak to the Shah and Persian Prime Minister in this sense. I should at the same time be grateful for your observations on the action v/hich Persian Government can most usefully take under paragraph 3-(b). * * 5. For your own informat ipn it is unlikely that Persian Government will be able indefinitely to debar Russians from participation in some form or other in the exploitation ol oil deposits in North Persia. But they can hope to postpone negotiations until such tine as these can take place in conditions which would enable Persian Government to obtain reasonable terms, i*e. after the withdrawal of Soviet troops. If they are to hold the Russians off until then, it is important that they should lase.no opportunity oi strengthening their case and that their general line oi action should be one which would justify support of His Majesty r s Government should this again be required.

The Shah, according to Ala, feared that some such attempt might be made here with support from the outside. 2. Events in Greece are being utilised by the pro Russian Press, which in articles of the greatest virulence draws parallels between what international reactionary capitalists and Imperialists are alleged to be doing in liberated countries and what Sa.ed, Saiyid Zia and their 'masters” are represented as having tried to do here, viz: to hold down mass of the Persian people who demand closer relations with Russia the defender of freedom. This propaganda is not without effect on the public but it is perhaps of more use to the Soviet authorities as providing them with an excuse for any policy they may decide to adopt here in defence of 'rights of oppressed majority'. 3. Persian authorities are very nervous. They have tales that Russians have within the last few months rented large premises in various parts of Tehran and that in all of them are garrisoned troops ready, they suggest, to intervene if the Government tries to repress disorder created by Tudeh. Russians have undoubtedly rented a number of houses for undefined purposes, but if they wish to intervene in street disturbances, they do not need special premises for the purpose. x ) It seems to me that the easiest course is for them to encourage ' autonomous move in Azerbaijan. Provision in the constitution for provincial Councils and the admitted neglect of the provinces and particularly of Azerbaijan by Persian Government provides quite/....quite good pretexts, v/hile the leadership taken by ^zerjaijan m the constitutional struggle against the central government and Czarist Russian influence nearly 40 years ago, affords a valuable precedent which would enable the Russians to fake an air of Verisimilitude to an otherwise unconvincing narrative. Nothing that the Russians'* could carry off successfully is excluded, but something that would look well to 'advanced” circles in Great Britain and America would probably be preferred, Persian Government may, however, out of fear of lack of skill in negotiation make such forms of pressure superfluous, by entrusting effective control of exploitation of the northern oil to the Russian / V experts working for a nominal Persian Company, I Foreign Office please repeat to Washington and Government of India as my telegram No, 118 and 425 respectively* [Repeated to Washington telegram No, 10575] [Copies sent to In$ia Office Telegraph Section forrepetition to Government of India] [Copies sent to Mr. Wiltshire] OpT.P./ }uj * ft'PeeJL cfficUo tyffsO ('I &lt;F«0 g.-| 0 9» _ ^ (f j ^ ^ in l*®’ t- w ? i ...

The Persian Prime Minister informs me that the newspaper which published offensive article on British policy in Greece etc., viz., Azhir, is to be suspended. 2. While Maximov was ill Avalov the Counsellor asked whether anything could be done to moderate the tone of the Press. He agreed campaign had been begun by Tudeh papers which he volunteered had enhanced reputation of Saed by the violence of their attacks. For mv view I said I had always been in favour of moderation in the Press and avoidance of personalities and that I would suggest to the Prime Minister that he should begin by recommending moderation to journalists of all parties. I did so, but Maximov chose rather to demand (with success) the suppression of three newspapers which supported Saed policy. 3. During the last few weeks newspapers on both sides have been suppressed but the Military Governor, in spite of the fact that; he is the best and most courageous we have had, has allowed all pro Russian papers to reappear, whereas several on the other side have had to adopt subterfuge of appearing under another name. For this reason when Azhir published venomous attack on British policy in Greece, I informed the new Minister for Foreign Affairs that the attitude of the new Government to tnis article would be a test case. 4.

There is evidence which seens to ne good, that Russians are working with considerable secrecy at the site of Khuriac concession at Semnan. Their legal right to do * so is doubtful (see your telegram No. 141 not repeated) but even Stu would hardly have tried to stop them. Jis view was that by allowing the Russians to import machinery from time to time the Persian Government might be held to have recognised the concession and as you are aware he had informed K that he was prepared to discuss with Khuriac oil as opposed to a general concession.

The Shah was particularly worried at reports that demonstrators had been collected in Russian lorries for meetings in Northern towns which talked about autonomy though he claimed that spectators showed no interest.

Soviet Embassy will make another attempt to obtain oil rights in some form or other. Persian Prime Minister has included among his Ministers two members of Saed’s Cabinet and it is believed that if he secures vote of confidence he will appoint as Minister of Agriculture Nakhai who was Saed’s Minister of Commerce and Industry. Soviet Embassy though they refused to invite Sururi to their party, have not made his presence in the Cabinet reason for refusing to have relations with new Prime Minister and Russians in general are outwardly more discreet. Thus they are unlikely to behave in regard . to Tudeh demonstrations as they did in Tehran and Tabriz. ; Nevertheless there are not lacking signs of intimidation. v Many persons official and private have recently been ejected from Northern Zone by Russians as hostile to them and Prime Minister is receiving from those parts a stream of obviously inspired [gp. undec: ?telegrams] asking for security for t, liberal M parties, death for Saed, exile for [gp. undec: 1 ?Sai]yid Zia and so on. Intimidation took grotesque form first day of debate on programme of new Government when diplpmatic box in Majlis contained six (later increased to 9) Russians, and of the six several were unknown to this Embassy [gp. undec: ?and had] that well-known underground look . This demonstration did not prevent 'one Yuaen orator rrom receiving so hostile a reception that he had to moderate his tone considerably. Meanwhile pro-Russian papers are trying with some success to confuse simple issue, viz the right of Persian Government to postpone talks about oil concessions until foreign troops have left the country. 2. Question which is doubtless a feeler from Russians, has been put to the Shah by Iraj Isskadari leader of the rc uit Tudeh deputies in Majlis. According to Minister of [gp. undec.] who spoke to me on instructions from Shah, Iraj Isskadari asked whether an interesting suggestion made by Dr, Musaddiq in a speech in Majlis on October 29th might not form basis- 2 - of settlement with Persian G-overnment. Suggestion was that oil in North Persia should he exploited by a Persian company and surplus sold to Russia at average international price. (Alternative suggestion made m same speech viz. that oil should be exploited by an international company was not mentioned by Iraj Isskadari). In discussion with Ala I found him suspicious that this was merely a device by which Russians might secure control in practice under a Persian cloak, since so long as they had troops in the North they would not allow Persian Government or a Persian company to'employ there any person to whom they objected. I said that exploitation by a native company was natural way to retain control of resources, but if Persians could not produce oil experts with required experience and in adequate numbers, Persian Government must consider v/hether they would have free hand to recruit them elsewhere. If Prime Minister speaks to me about Iraj Isskadari’s scheme, I shall not conceal my opinion that sensible course is to stick to his declared policy not to discuss oil until foreign troops have gone.

Counsellor has just telephoned a reply which is so grossly untrue that M. Maximov would hardly have ventured to give it had I been present. Reply says (cypher) # telegrams were stopped because Persian Government had promised not to send them, Persian Government made no promise nor would any Persian Government agree to have its foreign telegrams stopped by Soviet censorship. On my advice and in order not to aggravate the crisis Saed agreed not to send political telegrams except in cypher for the moment. Maximov’s ostensible objection to telegrams en clair was that contents might leak out on the way - objection which could not apply to cypher telegrams even if it conveyed the same message. 2. Maximov should be well enough to be seen in a day or two but I doubt whether he will give satisfactory assurances. If the new Persian Government also refuses to 01 ^ concessions during the war Soviet propoganda will begin again and Tass will be seriously incommoded if Persian Government are allowed to contradict.

Second part of message deals with part reported played by Soviet personnel in demonstraticns at Tabriz and arrest of Persian Police by the Soviets. Third part of message gives statements by Toudeh leaders characterising accusation against Russia as pure fabri cations . t It would seem that Rostron message is an attempt by Saed to publish to the world, statement which has not been permitted to leave Persia by allied censorship there, and in view of the delicacy of the situation I am holding up the message pending your comments.

According to M# Ala conversation between the Soviet Counsellor Avalov and the Persian Prime Minister went as follows. 2. Avalov, a Georgian with a quiet diffident manner was very conciliatory. He said that brusque hostile treatment accorded by Saed to the Soviet offer had caused great surprise and resentment. British and American companies had been allowed to negotiate for a long time whereas the offer from Russia was rejected at once as though she were e.g. Mexico (Foreign Office vdll hear the echo of Litvinov in this) instead of a great and friendly neighbour. Kavtoradze had asked Moscow whether he might leave but had been instructed to remain until th^formation of the new Government. Russia wanted good relations etc. The object was mutual benefit. 3. The Prime Minister expressed equal desire for good relations. His Cabinet was not yet definitely formed and he could not speak for the Government but so far as he himself was concerned the question of an oil concession was settled. Saed had merely expressed the desire of the great majority of the Majlis and of the people in saying that the matter must await the end of the war and (he added) the departure of foreign troops, and as the new Prime Minister, he could only give thethe same reply. On all other points he hoped that there would be friendly discussion. According to M. n la, iivalov did not contest this but he questioned the Prime Minister closely as to the composition of the new Cabinet. He wished to know whether it would include any members of the outgoing Cabinet. The Prime Minister evaded this question. In fact he will probably continue Sururi who enjoys the support of Majlis as Minister of the Interior. Iivalov was also anxious to know whether Ahmedi (Personalities number 16) would be included and was so inept as to say ^hmedi was reputed to be pn&gt; Russian. It is well known that ^hmedi was ejected from the Ministry of War not so long ago because the Russians held him to be 'pro-British” and they might v/ell [group undec. ] he would not permit demonstrations and would suppress violent newspapers fearlessly. The Prime Minister \ however has no intention to prefer so decided a character and told Avalov that iihmedi would not be in the Cabinet.

M. Ala was greatly relieved and pleased. 2. Soviet Ambassador being ill, Soviet Counsel called on new Persian Prime Minister November 23rd. Fortified I trust by my visit of the previous day Prime Minister (according to M.

As I knew, he had been m Tehran at the time when- the incidents began. The Russians had brought in a few lorry- loads of agitators from outside Tehran and had staged a wholly unreal demonstration. He had been much disturbed that this action should have been taken so soon after our departure from Moscow and he was very apprehensive as to what the Russians 1 real intentions were. 2. I told the Ambassador that we too had been taken by surprise by these events. It was true that Persia had not been discussed at Moscow, nor was there any reason why it should have been, since our relations like those of the Soviet Union towards Persia v/ere governed by our Joint agreement. The Ambassador agreed. I continued that, in view of recent developments, we had nevertheless thought it right to approach the Russians, but I asked His Excellency not to telegraph about this, since 1 had instructed you to inform the Persian authorities in Tehran direct. The Ambassador expressed his X; great relief and while agreeing not to telegraph about our approach to the Russians, said that he wished to inform his Government that we were watching the situation closely and would do what we could. I agreed to this. 3. The Ambassador did not seem very enthusiastic about the new Persian Prime Minister, but said that he was sure that on the main question of oil concessions he would maintain the policy of nis predecessor. I said that you had already given me some indication to this effect. In all the circumstances I thought that this was right. 4. In conclusion, the Ambassador expressed his warm thanks for the action taken by His Majesty's Government and for the statements on the B.B.C, and in the press. He undertook to keep me informed of any developments of which he learnt from Persia. Although somewhat reassured by our conversation, the Ambassador did not conceal his anxiety about his countiy s future or his dislike of Russian behaviour in Persian territory, OTP. rOUTWARD TELEGRAM With the Compliments •;\ ^ ^ SECRET „ ofthft Under Secretary of *9j^K» 7)^4 E.7186/615/G * Qr P^iHiign Affatp* 2 4 NOV 1944 \/&lt;C INDIA DIRECT ^ [This telegram is of particular secrecy and should he retained hy the authorised recipient and riot passed oh}.

New Persian Prime Minister, whom I have just seen, says he cannot do otherwise than follow the policy of his predecessor in the matter of oil concessions since thst is the policy which is desired by the Majlis and the great bulk of the population. At the same time he is nervous and i gathered if the Russians try to press for immediate grant or promise of a concession, he would resign. If, hov/ever, he secures the majority he hopes for (tye was for many years a deputy and knows the ropes) it wquld, I think, be a mistake for him to resign so long as he keeps his majority, for whereas he seems to believe Persia could produce an unlimited number of cabinets who would refuse the Russian demand, I am not so sure* However, the Shah, whom I also saw today seems to favour this method of bending before the blast, and of showing up the Russian dmand as thoroughly unpopular, I did my best to encourage both of them by saying that the attitude adopted by former Government was fully understood in Great Britain and had apparently won general sympathy.

While there is general sympathy here for the late Persian Prime Minister, these people are unfortunately inclined to be cynical in all matters relating to oil concessions and it is possibly for this reason that it is widely assumed that the Persian Government would never have stood out against Russia but for Anglo-American prodding applied by the two latter countries for their own selfish ends.

But Kavtaradzo was still in Tehran; there were indications that the Soviet Government intended to renew pressure; and there were attacks in the Soviet Press on the late Persian Prime Minister, of which Sir A* Cadogan gave examples. 2, Sir A. Cadogan observed that we should have hoped, in view of the fact that the Soviet Government and His Majesty^ Government were co-signatories of the Tripartite Treaty, that the Soviet Government might have taken us into their confidence before adopting any'hard line in regard to the Persian Govern ment. They seomod, however, to have gone ahead by themselves in an attempt to force the issue and to force the resignation of the.Persian Government. 3, It was explained to the Soviet Counsellor that I had been doing my best to restrain certain organs of the Press in this country from indulging in criticism of the Soviet Govern ment's action, but it would bo difficult to continue this restraint unless I could give some indication that the whole question would: be left until the end of the War. I also anticipated questions in Parliament. 4, The Counsellor undertook to telegraph the substance of my remarks to Moscow, and to ask his Government to provide us with some indication of their intentions, and with material with which to counter criticisms.

General expectation was that Samii (number 199 in Personalities) would become the Persian Prime Minister but at the last moment he withdrew. Choice then fell upon Bayat (number 47) who has just been asked by the Shah to form a Ministry. Delay was largely due to the futility of the Deputies but partly no doubt to their feeling that something in their favour might turn up. 2. Bayat is a nonentity but is not considered dishonest.^ He is however talking of being able to find a solution of the disagreement with the Russians and one well- informed source interprets this as meaning that the Russians will be given promise of first refusal of any oil concession in the North. Since Saed refused to give any opinion [sic ? option] during the war even if the Russians submitted terms, this would constitute victory for the Russians and would completely justify in their eyes methods by which they secured Saed’s retirement.

Mr.Law: The answer to the first part of the Question is in the affirmative. As regards the second part, the Persian Government have announced that they intend to postpone the question of granting oil concessions until after the war, and my hon. Friend’s suggestion would hardly be consistent with tnis decision. But i should perhaps add that the^ areas in which the British and .nnerican companies were^ seeking a concession are not the same as the areas in which the U.S.S.R, were seeking a concession, so that the possibility of friction with the U.S.S.R. in this respect does not arise. Mr,Price : May I ask whether the U.S.S.R. has also put in a request for a concession in the northern part of rersia recently? Mr.Law : I think tlmt is so. The U.S.S.R. has put in such a request, but the attitude of the Persian Government has been made clear, and, of course, our own attitude has been made clear, too. Mr.Molson : Presumably, this does not in any way affect the long-standing concessions which the Anglo-Persian Oil Company at present Hold from the Persian Government? Mr.Law : No, Sir. It is only a question of new concessions.c. kite/ WL ka. Zo‘ w„ ■'V&gt; EXTRACT FROM PRIVATE &amp; SECRET LETTER FROM LORD WAVELL TO MR. AKERY DATED 1st NOVEMBER 1944. 9. I have seen Bullard's recent telegrams about Russian activities in Persia. He takes a pessimist ic view, not entirely without justification. The External Affairs Department, with support from General Headquarters, wanted me to authorise the , . issue of a rather woolly telegram saying that we 7,4 i hoped H.M.G. would make a direct approach to the fcT■/ I Russians at a high level. I substituted for this c '' ^ “V a much shorter message merely pointing out our strong direct interest in Persia's independence, and expressing the hope that H.M.G. would bear this in mind and keep us infoimed. I suspect that the Foreign Office do not like too much advice from India on diplomatic methods, especially when relations with a major Power like Russia are fconcerned. I have just seen your telegram No.24381 . dated 29th October which shows that the Foreign Office are coming into action. ^ 1 -0.At. h- ^ 3c ifV. 3.S. Please see the Government of India’s telegram 15162 of 21st November below.

Before the latest telegram we sent them (No. 26Ck&gt;0) ,they nad already received our 2.1+8^2 9 paragraph 2 of which contained a clear indication of the necessity of securing a fair presentation of the Persian version, a point which is surely in any case a fairly obvious one. They have, of course, also received all the circular guidance the Ministry of Information have sent out.

Repeated to Moscow, Washington M.E,Min’s Office. v v v IMMEDIATE Secret. The Daily Express War Correspondent Rostron from Cairo has come to Tehran to get the oil story. He has seen the Minister of Court and Sa,.... and is to see the Shah and some deputies. He has applied for an interview with Soviet Ambassador or K. he proposes to return to Cairo November 21st and to send off from there whatever is left of his message.by the censors. He has decided not to try to telegraph anything about it from here since the Soviet Censor would probably suppress anything not in accordance with the Soviet thesis and he could hardly despatch from Cairo the material to which the Soviet Censor in Tehran had objected. 2. I fully realise the delicacy of this matter of publicity but it seems certain that the story will come out sooner or later (next journalist may be American) and that the longer the facts are suppressed the more likely it is that we shall appear to be accomplices in a new 'stra.igling of Persia', the noose being the Russian military hold over the.north of Persia together with Allied censor in Tehran. If it was certain that the Russians intended to withdraw their demand for a concession it might well be allowed to drop into oblivion but the withdrawl is by no means certain. 3. Rostron’s impression after two or three days here was that we have^in Persia Sudetenland over again. I do not suppose that he will say this in his message but if he gives anything like a fair picture it is bound^to contain points unflattering to the Russians. I give this warning so that the Foreign Office can if necessary take steps to deal with the message. I venture to suggest that if it is not suppressed altogether it ought to be edited by the # Foreign Office in conformity with the general policy of His Majesty s Government and not cut in Cairo in accordance with the local.censor stops. Rostron proposes to show his message-to me if it is xinisned before he loaves. I shall point out any errors of fact but shall tell him that for the rest tie must deal with the Censor.

Apart from brief references on B.B.C. only news received from abroad which has tried to do justice to the Persian Government’s case was contained in a message from Reuter’s diplomatic correspondent in London which slipped into the Tehran press through the carelessness of the Soviet censor who had in fact condemned it. Attitude of Reuter and B.B.C. is attributed by at least one of the pro- Russian newspapers to the fact that Mr. Wallace one of Reuter's correspondents is a son-in-law of M. Saed. 0.

I made protest to the Soviet ambassador in your name and asked whether the Soviet authorities intended to observe the censorship agreement which had been in force for 3 years, or not; The Ambassador alleged that the Soviet military authorities finding that Saed was adopting a hostile attitude towards the U.S. S. R. ordered the Soviet censorship to stop certain telegrams. He would however consult K who was in Tehran as the representative of Molotov. I said I was unaware of the status o'.f K here but that the censorship agreement was clear and Persian Government telegrams were exempted from the censorship. 2. M. Maximov said that the Soviet Government had a right to expect co-operation from us when they v/ere exposed to the hostility of the Persian Government. It was difficult to treat this seriously but I did so pointing out that our co-operation was always to be had in matters relating to aid to the Russians and all that that involved but the Soviet Embassy could not expect us to support them in a dispute with the Persian Government about an oil concession.

This raises difficult constitutional question. Masaddiq would be hopeless at \ ordinary business and to show his independence might be a nuisance to us and to the Americans but it is believed that he would not sign a Russian oil concession. 2.

The Shah was very happy to see that Russian propaganda was not being accepted in London at its face value, he however suggested that the Times might have misunderstood the situation to say that there was no particular reason why negotiations should have to wait till ■;he end of the war.

Dear peel, In Baxter’s absence, letter Ext.5110/44 of the 13th guidance on the Soviet-Persian I am replying to your November, about press oil dispute. On the understanding that it is in fact for confidential guidance of editors only and not for direct reproduction, paragraph 3 of the Government of India’s telegram enclosed in your letter seems quite satisfactory. It is important to avoid (at any rate at this stage), anything in the nature of ’’inspired comment”, since this would only make things more difficult with the Russians. What we have tried to do is to give as much publicity as possible to the Persian case, as stated by the Persians themselves. Hitherto, material from Persian sources, or from British correspondents in Persia, has been very meagre. We have explained to Reuters here why the messages of their correspondent in Tehran have been held up, and have shown them in confidence the text of one of the messages suppressed by the Soviet censor. We should see no objection to reliable correspondents in India being given a similar confidential explanation of the reasons why the Russian case has so far obtained more publicity in the world press than the Persian if in any particular case you think this would be useful. For the moment, the question is in suspense in Tehran and unless and until it again becomes active, we think that the advice to the press should be that the less said the better. R.T.

On the morning of November 7th British censor informed me that the Soviet censor had for twenty four hours been holding up two Persian Government telegrams, one to the Persian Ambassador London and one to the Persian Ambassador Washington and that two others re ceived November 7th were also being held up. I called on the Soviet Ambassador as soon as possible. He professed surprise and promised to investigate and let me know at once. He did not communicate with me and today he is alleged to be on holiday. The Soviet censor has how ever just informed his British colleague that the two earlier messages have been stopped, the later ones passed. Prom [grp. undec.] I have no doubt that messages which have been stopped were cypher version of message in plain language which was stopped by the Soviet Ambassador. 3. As you are aware, our censorship agreement with Soviet authorities here provides for exemption of all Persian Government messages from censorship. Action of the Soviet censors which has of course been carried out under orders of the Soviet Ambassador is therefore serious breach of agreement with us as well as a particularly mean attempt to stifle the Persian case while giving world publicity to one-sided Soviet reports as in the article in Izvestia of November 4th. 4.

Similar demonstrations reported from northern citijs 0 5. As.demonstrations connected with postponement of oil negotiations until after the war which displeased the Soviet Economic Delegation, it- is necessary to give the facts. 6 . On learning of decision of the Government K. informed the journalists that it impaired Soviet-Persian relations. K. added that it was no longer possible to work with Sa.... and in fact since then, Russian- representatives have had no relations, with him. 7. Persian Prime Minister states that legally constituted Government of Persia supported by a Parliamentary majority is entitled to decide as it likes regarding an offer from any foreign power. Moreover Persian Government has shown sincere desire to work with the Allies especially with U.S.S.'R. (a) by placing its railways at the disposal of the Allies and giving priority to lend-lease material for Russia even at the expense of transport for its own foodstuffs, (b) by supplying Russia with arms manufactured in Persia at a cost hitherto almost entirely defrayed by Persia ? (c) by exporting rice to Russia when there was famine in Persia and letting Russia have 200,000 cattle a year (a mistake: most of these animals are sheep) output of a modern canning factory and whole output of Persia*s vast fisheries not to mention considerable linancial aids. Persian- 2 - Government thus proved reaGiness- : to make any reasonable sacrifice for Allied cause, and this through the strenuous efforts of Sa.... as-Foreign Minister. 8 . Oil concession, however, cannot he decided without profound consideration. The Persian Government ..considers the 'attitude of the Soviet representatives'seeking to coerce the legally constituted Government which is supported by the majority of the Majlis, is contrary to the letter and spirit of the Atlantic Charter and the Tehran Declaration about Persia. The Persian Government therefore insists on its right to take any decision and considers no Government has the right to try to dompel the Persian Government, under pressure to take decisions which, in its opinion, are inconsistent with the country’s [grp, undec. •?own] national independence. • 9. K. tries to distinguish between the Persian Government and people,, and quotes section of the local press as ! wanting a concession to'be granted. Firstly, Persian Government consider K. less well^ qualified than itself to judge the state, of public opinion; secondly, the Persian Government point out that section of the press which is stated to have connexion with the Soviet Embassy in no way reflects public opinion; thirdly, the'majority ^ of papers with., widest circulation support .the Government s ' action. • /' 10.

Pressed for details he could only quote matters of relatively minor importance. Finally he alleged that Saltana 'would not even consider Soviet terms for oil concession'. It is of course, important.part of Prime Minister's case that he was pressed to promise concession in principle without declaration of Soviet conditions. This is supported by K. s statement to the press. 5. Prime Minister refused to allow Tudeh party to make a demonstration November 7th.

Saed who is very tired informed me. to-day that he intended to submit his resignation in the hope that that might win his Government a few weeks respite. This seems optimistic.

While it was only an assumption he thought that it was fair to deduce that our common attitude and representations to [sic: ? of! our two Governments in Moscow had had something to do v/ith it.

Its failure cannot but damage their credit abroad especially if all details came out and their use of Hitler technique becomes known. In this country Persians have seen what they thought impossible viz. a Russian diplomatic defeat and although they may feel the Russians will take revenge sooner or later, they nave learnt that to stand up to the Russians is not necessarily to commit suicide. For the first time since the occupation of Persia the press which was always ready to criticise us and later the Americans, has told the Russians some home truths and it is hoped that this process will continue and not only tend to keep the Russians in order but also prevent the Russians supposing that the whole country is with them. 2 . The death blow to the Russian scheme was of course dealt by British and American representations in Moscow but some credit must go to the Persian Prime Minister who refused to resign even when many deputies and high officials wavered ^and Radio Moscow accused him of wanting to use Persia as a jbase for Fascist agression against Soviet Russia.

SECRE 1 ^ * My telegi*am No. 1148'. 0 : 0:010 On November 3rd telegram in plain language (English) addressed to the five Persian Missions abroad, including London was received from censorship from office of the Persian Prime Minister. It gave the Persian point of view on the oil crisis. British censor asked whether such a message should go by ordinary route viz. by •- wireless and I directed him to send it by cable whereupon he handed it in to be sent and as usual gave a copy to his Soviet colleague* The Soviet Ambassador had the telegram withheld and argued that our censorship should not have let the message through without the authorisation of the Soviet censorship. I replied that according to Article 4 (a) of the memorandum on tripartite censorship of February 7th 1942 all Persian Government messages are exempt from censorship though to obviate the danger that the message might be picked up by the Germans, I had had it [grp. undeo. ? forwarded] by cable but that in order not to exacerbate the political situation, I would suggest to the Prime Minister that without prejudice to principle he should send such messages in cypher. 2. I felt that as it was already clear that the Soviet Government were dropping their demand to be given an oil concession out of hand and as the Persian case was now receiving publicity through Reuters I could afford to make this derogation from censorship agreement. SA..... made no objection. I trust you will approve.

The Prime Minister is hpwever unlikely to ask Millspaugh ! s advice. Prime Minister underrates Millspaugn’s good qualities and on account of his bad ones consults him as little as possible and often circumvents him when consultation would be valuable.

We agree that the Indian censorship could not suppress an article of this kind which has already appeared in the United Kingdom press. Recent telegrams from Tehran will have made you familiar with the reasons why the Soviet point of view has hitherto had more prominence in the press than the Persian. Press correspondents here are now aware of the reasons for the one-sidedness of comment on this subject hitherto; and we are doing our best to arrange for the Persian point.of view to be given more prominence.

Following is summary of statement of Prime Minister. [Begins], In view of K.*s statement to the press he wished to make the matter clear. Persian Ambassador in Moscow telegraphed twice saying that K. was coming to Tehran with a Soviet mission to discuss Khourian oil question. The Prime Minister replied saying [? group omitted! ready to discuss matters of mutual interest. At the first meeting between K. and the Prime Minister the talk [? group omitted] limited to Khourian oil but when K. returned from tour in the provinces he threw over Khourian question and asked for a concession for oil in certain provinces. K. said this would have moral and material advantages for Persia and would ensure the moral support of Russia for Persia at peace conference. Knowing the views of the # Cabinet and Majlis Prime Minister knew that no concession would be given to any foreign concern but prpmised to discuss the matter with the Cabinet. The Prime Minister spoke to the Cabinet and to representatives of all parties m the Mailis but they stuck to their opinion. After another conversation with K. the Prime Minister again spoke to the Cabinet and parties but again with p^gatiye results. On receiving this information K. said that the reply amounted to a rejection of the Soviet proposal and would strain relations. The Prime Minister expressed regress and oiiercd further step viz. that K. should make detailed proposals which the Persian Government could consider though they could not give decision until dfter the war. K. refused this. Reasons for postponement of decision were xour 1) So long as foreign troops [?group country public opinion would consider any- having been granted under duress omitted] in this concession as 2) Economic condition of the world was not clear 3) Oil conference at Washington had left the situation in doubt’.4) All reports from Persian representatives abroad urged ‘that no concession should be granted until after the war, Consequently the decision of the Government ought not to affect the relations between the two Governments,. In agreements made between them throughout the war and until now there was no mention of oil, K. f s annoyance was groundless. The Prime MinisterJaad -been one of the chief t instruments in . achieving good relations and would continue to work to that end. Finally the Prime Minister said that it must not be' forgotten ‘that the British and American companies had accepted the decision of the Persian Government without annoyance..W’ltK imenv^ \ w ? - t» *#r Afi * 0“ V&lt;® i ,, 4;.. b J Ha r'*Aft .

According to a reliable informant, Kavtoradze summoned a Persian who is both a deputy and a newspaper proprietor and after vague threats directedqgainst him and the Persians more or less talked to the following effect. 2. Russia v/as the only country that would protect * Persia. She wanted oil in North Persia in order to be able to protect Persia against Great Britain and the United States who after the war would follow an imperialistic policy. Russia was extremely powerful, Mr.Churchill and President Roosevelt had to go running off to Stalin whenever they wanted anything. The Persians were of course hoping to postpone granting concession until after the war because they thought that the Russians would then be less free to act.

A copy of the '’Observer 11 article is also x. enclosed. If you agree nopose to advise the Government of India to reply to the Persian Consul General, as the Indian newspapers in question were only reproducing an article which had already appeared in the U.K. Press the Persian Government should take the matter up in London if they think it worth while. 7e, for our part, consider that the use of Indian/i Indian censorship for-the supression of rahtter which has already appeared in the U.K., for other than Indian domestic reasons, in an issue of this kind, would not be free from objection, and we propose to sa^ r so to the Government of A India. 7e should also be grateful if you could let us have some purely background guidance for the use of the Government of India on the whole natter of the Soviet Government's request for oil rights in Northern Persia. x (Sgd.)

Six or seven newspapers support the Persian Government and Bakhtar of October 26th has a very strong article, which if it could be published all over the world, would place the Russians in an awkward position. The writer reminds K. that when Persia was herself starving two years ago she spares wheat and rice for Russia, then hard pressed by the Germans. He tells K. that contrary to rumours spread by Persian quislings who will take money from anyone, Saad and his cabinet are patriotic and honest and enjoy public support. Persians know that the U.S.S.R. can use the mailed fist butif when she is fighting for freedom she uses it against Persia, will it not wound Persia 1 s feelings? 2. Raadi Imruz describes the pressure which Russia is using as intolerable and says that any patriotic Persian would have behaved as Saad behaved. 3.

Prime Minister on whom I called at his request, informed me that demonstrators yesterday were accompanied by lorries of armed Russian soldiers,' This is true and it arouses suspicions that if Persian police or troops had to use force to disperse a dangerous crowd or to protect public buildings they might be fired on by Russians.- Prime Minister reminded me that in December 1942 when there were street disorders in Tehran, we brought in troops to help maintain order. Was it, he enquired, the business of the Russians only to maintain order and not rather of Russians, British and Americans ? I said I did not think a solution of the problem was to be sought there, though I promised to inform you. 2, During the demonstration, British military police were at hand to prevent any British soldiers from getting mixed up in the crowd and a small body of troops was standing to, to rescue any British Soldier vfho might get into trouble, American military police were very numerous. 3. It is interesting if disgusting to see the whole technique of Hitler.in Sudetenland unrolling itself before ones eyes. I have advised the Prime Minister to be extremely careful lest an incident be provoked. He has promised to take care but says the Cabinet have decided that the next time groups of demonstrators are to be broken up while they are small. 4. Effect of K.'s interview and of street demonstration has been to consolidate support for the Prime Minister in Majlis and among the public.

Your telegram No. 674 to Tehran. In the absence of instructions from you I have so far refrained from discussing with State Department Soviet-Persian oil question but Wallace Murray has now raised it and asked for viev/s. He says that State Department have received disquieting reports (a) of attitude of Soviet representative at Tehran and (b) of tone of Soviet press which as soon as Mr. Churchill and yourself left Moscow began to speak of Fascism in Persia and of failure of Persian authorities to punish those guilty of sabotage and pilfering of supplies for Russia going through Persia. State Department are anxious lest this portends the working up by the Russians of a case against Persia on classic G-erman model. United States Grovernment are for their part prepared to accept Persian attitude of refusing applications for oil concessions from any foreign power during the war. If the Russians try to compel Persia to grant a concession against her will, this would in view of State Department raise question of Anglo-American-Russian statement of December 1943 concerning the independence and sovereignty of Persia. If this statement were to be brushed aside as a scrap of paper, it would be an extremely serious matter and a bad omen for future agreements with the Russians. The United States Government could hardly allow the matter to go by default and State Department wonder whether before matters go too far it might be desirable for Americans and ourselves to ask questions or to make some representations in Moscow.

General lines of such approach would be that His Majesty's Government in no way contest the right of Soviet Government to seek an oil concession in North Persia: They consider, however, that this is a question on which Persian Government nave a right to take their own decisions and they have for their part apcepted without demur the Persian decision to grant no further oil concession during the war. They understand that United States Government have taken a similar attitude. They feel that it would not be in accordance with the above-mentioned undertakings if the Persian Government were forced against their vail to concede during the war the very extensive rights which the Soviet Government are now demanding. 5, We v/ould propose that any initial approach to Soviet Government should be based on the foregoing general lines, namely that.it is a necessary condition of Persian independence that Persian Government should not be expected to dispose of Persian property otherwise than by free negotiation^ If Soviet Government then deny that methods used by them are open to objection on these grounds, we should quote from evidence in +F R° a( 3- e r Bullard s telegrams and from Soviet sources, e,g*. attacks on Persian Prime Minister in Soviet press* „„ o T ,I: n ^5 n 0 S- 1 d r th . e United States Government be prepared to take an approximately similar line with the Soviet Government?

It was well known yesterday that there was to be a demonstration today by Tudeh party in favour of grant of an oil concession to Soviet Government. This morning a large crowd collected in Majlis Square with Russian Military Police in attendance and ..later moved off in procession to applause directed by cheer leaders. 2. His Majesty’s Consul-General at Tabriz reports that Soviet Consul General there paid a visit to Tehran and on his return to Tabriz a few days ago, talk of a general strike began to circulate. It would be quite easy for Russians to organise a strike there - or in Isfahan (my telegram No. 1098) 3. Such incidents which do not represent the general feeling of Persians about oil concession will probably sound convincing when reported from Moscow by foreign correspondents on the strength of Tass telegrams from Tehran.

Though there are of course many other channels by which articles in Soviet Press can reach the outside world, I agree that it is undesirable and will have been discouraging to the Persians that a British agency should carry such reports, and question is being taken up with Reuter’s. 2. One method of redressing balance in Persian favour would be for Persian Government to put out ^ in Tehran a reasoned and restrained statement of their point of view, following up that contained in your telegram No. 1068. This had perhaps best be done by Persian Prime Minister himself, either in Majlis or to press correspondents.

After setting forth advantages to Persia in vague terms he stated that. u Saed in the course of conversations with me not only signified complete agreement and understanding; but promised his help for satisfactory solution 11 . He says that subsequent refusal was ’’received in a negative manner in Soviet circles 11 irrespective of darkened relations between the two countries. He expresses confidence that the question will be settled and calls for co-operation of Persian public opinion n as represented by liberal press of Persia”. 2. Saed whom I saw to-day repeats that neither before Kavtoradze's arrival nor in talks when he arrived, was anything mentioned but Khourian business. It was this that Saed was prepared to discuss but when Kavtoradze made his wider proposals Kavtoradze said he was no longer interested in Khourian. ^3. Prime Minister says that so long as he enjoys the confidence of the Majlis he does not propose to resign. He gave me the names of 13 leading members of Tudeh party who he says have told him in private that they agree with his policy. This agrees with news from other sources.

We both realise the difficulty in which this crisis will place our Governments but we agree entirely in our personal opinions that Persian Government are morally justified, that Russian methods are unpardonable, that when Persians are for once showing qualities we have hitherto asked of them, it is difficult to tell them to settle their own affairs with the Russians and that, if United States and British Governments do nothing in this crisis in spite of the declaration they signed here last year, they cannot expect to enjoy any respect in Persia hereafter.3. Until this crisis arose the attitude of the United States Government was, I gather, that they did not question the right of the Persian,Government to postpone consideration of applications for oil'concessions until after the war, but expected American companies to receive fair consideration if Persian Government changed its mind. .. . 'P. Youf'paragraph'-3.- Local press publishes to-day Reuters* message dated Tehran October 22nd which has.probably been published in London giving the point of view of Persian Government. It ends with announcement that a special department is to be established to study natural, resources of the country and to draw up conditions to serve as basis of discussion with foreign oil companies applying for concessions after the war.

SECRET. My immediately preceding telegram, not repeated. The Shah yesterday had Kavtoradze and Soviet Ambassador to dine with Ala, Minister of Court ' and Yazdan Panah, The Shah did not invite Prime Minister as Russians had been saying openly that they had broken off relations with Saed. Account of what happened has been given to me by Ala. 2. The Shah tried to make the Russians believe that the decision of the Government was in no way directed against Russia and was in accordance with the wishes of the Majlis and the Persian people. The Russians repeatedly represented their proposal as having been put forward mainly in the interest of the Persians. They said that acceptance would help the Persians at the Peace Conference and - an amazing argument - would show the world that the Northern part of the country really did belong to Persia. They talked much about dismissal of general manager of the railways (my t elegram No. 1082) and represented it as a proof that the Government was hostile to the ’’Allies'’. 5, Ala thinks that perhaps some good was done by the talk* The Persians did not give way at all but conversations are to be resumed. 4* According to my information, Majlis is almost entirely Dehind Saed in this matter and even some of Tudeh members admit in private that he is right, The Russians however seem determined to get him out. I regard it as a significant feature of the campaign that chief Tudeh newspaper is^ also # attacking Tagizadeh as a sinister figure like Saiyidzia. Russi'ans are evidently anxious to forestall possibility of him becoming Prime Minister probably because to judge by his reputation he like Saed, would be above corruption by money and intimidation by threats, 5.

Effect of Soviet '.prohibition, ifmaintained, would be awkward but not ruinous. Thanks to the efforts of Americans and of British grain collecting officers, there is so large a stock of grain in Tehran that Persia could lust manage until next harvest even if no more grain reached Tehran from the north. Millspaugh would however be obliged to impose several unpopular measures.which he had abandoned as no longer necessary e.'g« collection of part (pf peasants’ share and restriction on movements of private grain and also to increase proportion of barley in controlled bread. If time came when His Majesty s Government thought that an approach to Soviet Government was justified they could hardly find better excuse than above-mentioned Soviet order which cannot be justified by any military necessity.

Prime Minister has complicated his relations with Russians by failure to deal promptly and sensibly with a dispute about the General Manager of Railways Hussein Nafisy. N., together with other members of his family, has for some time been the object of attack in certain newspapers. Attack is mainly political but includes accusations of corruption which are probably untrue. Soon after Saed*s second Cabinet came into office N. was first suspended, then dismissed without any warning being given to Americans and Russians who run railway. N, has worked for 3 years to complete satisfaction of British, Russians and Americans. I urged the Prime Minister who was already in difficulties with Russians about oil to find a solution of N. question and not to quarrel with all the Allies on a matter where Persian Government was in the wrong: Allies did not want interfere with course of justice but removal of N e by Minister of Communications without notice was indefensible. Prime Minister gave me to understand that Ministry of Justice having intervened all he could do was to accelerate judicial enquiry and this remained the general impression until October 21st when I arranged for the Prime Minister to receive me and to have Minister of Justice and Minister of Communications present. It v/as at once clear that crisis had been caused by stupidity of the new Minister of Communications who had discharged N. in spite of the fact that under law he could in no way [grp 0 undec.] at his post s® long as Public Prosecutor had not presented a charge to courts. I pointed out that Minister of Communications had put the Government in danger and that in my opinion the only course was to reverse his decision and reinstate N., leaving the law to take its course. Prime Minister agreed and is taking action accordingly. Unfortunately case which might have been settled satisfactorily a fortnight ago if the Prime Minister had possessed a clearer mind is now being used by Russians as a further proof of Saed's hostility to them.

On October 19th in a Persian broadcast which purported to be by Persian-Soviet Cultural Society,. Soviet'Embassy broadcast extracts from two Persian newspapers (one of them published by Embassy) giving the Russian version of oil dispute. 2. Minister at Court has just been talking this over. He says the Shah feels that it would be fathl to give way.* When informing Kavtaradze of decision to wait until after the war Prime Minister had said to him that the Government had offers from American and British firms for oil in the south and that if Kavtaradze would let him know what terms Russians proposed for the north, Government v/ould examine them. The Russians however refused present terms and wanted an acceptance in principle of tfieir very wide demand, saying that they were no longer interested in Hosurian, If,, said M. Ala, Persian Government accede to this deiiand they maybe forced by similar methods to accept detailed proposals however unfavourable to Persia. Prime Minister • • • •A - 2 - ■' Minister was quite ready, to resign if that would relieve tension but the Shah felt that Saed should stay in office as long as possible since in this natter he enjoyed the confidence of the Shah and of the Majlis. If Saed had to go his departure should be so arranged as not to be connected with the oil dispute and any successor must take the same line' and postpone oil concessions until after the war. Could anything be done to ease f ter}sion? .Perhaps Kavraradze was being stiffen than Soviet Government intended and Persian Government shouldsend a special negotiator to Moscow to explain the situation. Could British and United States Governments perhaps in.connexiqn with oil talks which were to be resumed after Presidential election - say a word to Soviet Government? 3. I did not feel that the moment had. come to give reply set forth in paragraph 7 of your Jelegram No. 672. I ^ said l would inform His Majesty’s Governmeni: out Ala must realise that they were interested in Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and that one point made by the pro-Russians (though I myself did not admit an analogy) was that this justified grant of oil rights in the north to the Russians. I doubted whether it would be wise to offer to send special negotiator to Moscow when Kavtaradze was still here: would it not answer better to instruct Persian Ambassador in Moscow to take-the matter up with Soviet Government? If reports given by Ala of threatening attitude of the Russians were correct I could not (repeat not) say that • wise course for the Persian Government would be to give ( way f though it was for the Persian Government to decide.. As to Saed I had found him honest and on the whole co-operative and should continue to support him so long a's he was supported by Majlis. It was unfortunate that he had not .taken a Vote in the Majlis after his latest statement about oil'.since he had no proof of his contention that he had the deputies with him though I contested [sic] he had. I did not think if Saed resigned it would be easy to find successor who would agree to follow the same policy except possibly Taqizadeh who I heard had not refused to come back if urgently needed. A. Ala left to see United States Ambassador. 5 . I venture to think condition laid down in paragraph 8 of your above-mentioned telegram has been fulfilled. Soviet Government have sent Assistant Under-Secretary to stay in Persia until Persian Government give him without competition and without disclosure by Russians of any financial or other terms, exclusive rights over all the oil in a n immense area which is probably the richest in oil in the country and happens to be r occupied by Soviet troops: they - use Persian Government's own radio to broadcast Soviet point of view in a most violent form ...-3~ &gt; [ A, form alleging falsely that broadcast comes from Persian- Soviet Cultural Society; and they support their demand by military demonstrations. We cannot quote other forms of pressure 'which we know exist viz. subsidising of gutter press, threats to journalists and deputies and so on, but if what is being done openly is not incompatible with the independence of Persia, what is? 6 . Although I see a fundamental difference (as do the Persians) between our sleeping partnership in Anglo- Iranian Oil Company and exploitation of oil in Persia by a department of Soviet Government, I fully realise the delicacy of our position. So of course do the Russians and they want what will eventually give them everything to be secured now, while they have troops in the country, a stranglehold on news going to other countries and the comfortable feeling that loyalty and oolicy will probably compel Great Britain and America to keep silence. Nevertheless as I believe that what happens now will settle the fate of Persia I deprecate our accepting without further examination arguments set forth in your paragraph 4. What strategic difficulties you have in mind I do not know but I believe that if Persia can stick to her decision to postpone grant of oil concessions until after the war she has some chance of resisting political pressure in tne press, when even if there is no League of nations there will be the weapon of publicity which the Russians so much dislike and fear. as to economic weapon, I believe Persia could be made much less dependent on Russia than she was in the time of the late Shah* 7. If in spite of tripartite agreement and three power declaration about Persia made at Tehran last year &gt; Russia secures the oil rights she demands by means she is now using, it will have a disastrous effect on the morale of the Persian peoole. Our efforts to encourage best elements will no longer have any effect for every Persian will feel that in a moment of crisis he might be thrown to the Russian wolf and the only men who will take office will be those who are prepared to do what the Russians tell them. 8 * As to our economic interests, is it likely that Persian Government would give us another oil concession in the South if they had any hope of securing sympathy of United States Government by granting a concession to an American company? After all they would be tempted to say, America cannot do less than nothing for us.

Persian Government now declares hy way of deprecating Russian wrath that decision to postpone consideration or applications for oil concessions was taken before Russians applied for oil rights over the whole of-the north. Before he arrived and for some days after, object of K s journey was stated by the Russians to be the examination of Khourian business. 2. Pro Russian campaign in certain newspapers is now accompanied by ferocious attacks on the Prime.Minister who is accused of being opposed adversely to Russian interests. According to the Prime Minister the Soviet Embassy yesterday asked radio Tehran to broadcast particularly scurrilous attack on the Prime Minister which had appeared in an obscure paper and the Prime Minister had to issue specixic orders thal the article should not be broadcasts Editors of three newspapers who mildly supported Government s policy have informed our P A that they were summoned by the Soviet First Secretary and told that they had better stop opposing Russian demand. Saiyid Zia reports having receivedmessage from Soviet Embassy that if anyone opposed the Russians they had means of dealing with him. Astounding point of lact was that Saiyid Zia v s papers had not taken a strong line m the matter. It is characteristic that this threat was conveyed by a 'Persian diplomat who has just been appointed Minister to Lisbon. There is no reason why the Persians shoulu take notice of such threats but being cowards they are naturally greatly influenced by them. Prime Minister is unmoved being sustained not only by moral courage but by experience oi ^he Russians which has taught him that the only thing to &lt;xO i s resist the first unjust demand otherwise you have to give in to a series of demands each more unreasonable and peremptory than the one before until everything has been given away. 3. Yesterday the Prime Minister made a statement in Majalis explaining and defending the government s attitude. He tells me that he had the House with him with very j.ew exceptions and that agrees with reports from other sources. No vote was however taken and I asked him how the public were to be convinced that he had support of deputies, 118(1 , apparently not occurred to him.

If the Persian Government can maintain their refusal to grant any concessions during the war, I agree that it would not be in our interest to press them to reverse their decision, although this would mean the abandonment of hope of a concession for Shell in South Persia, so long as the war continues. .2. But we must consider what should be our attitude in the not unlikely event of the Russians refusing to accept the Persian decision and.applying stronger pressure. In # this connexion, you should know chat Russia s desire to obtain new oil rights may lead the Soviet Government to go to considerable lengths to force the Persian Government to give way. 3. Should this occur, we might well get the worst of all worlds if we were to urge the Persian Government to resist. Not only would it be morally certain that the Persians would give &lt; away to the Russians the fact that we were pressing them to resist^ but we might well find ourselves in a position where the oil concession in the south had been withheld, while we had aroused Russian resentment by obstruction which could only be based on . political grounds, and had failed to achieve our object of keeping ths Russians out. 4. I share your apprehensions about Russian intentions in North Persia. But if it is in fact the Soviet intention to dominate the northern provinces of Persia, there are other methods, political, strategic and economic, by which the Soviet Government could in all nrobablity achieve their aim whenever they wished. In that event', it is doubtful whether refusal of oil concession would seriously affect the outlook. / 5 ...2 5. Our case vis-a-vis of the Russians is undoubtedly _ weakened by the existence of the. A.I.O.C. concession in South Persia. ;/e could hardly sustain against the Russians the argument that the cas&gt;~s are quite different Decause the British concession is held by a British company, in which His Majesty's Government have a large interest, while under the Russian system the Russian concession in the north would be v held by the Soviet Government or an official orgon thereoi. 6 . Finally, if oil deposits in North Persia are to be exploited, the only suitable..market in practice would be the Soviet Union. In these circumstances, it is most unlikely that any British or American company would wish at present to compete for a conession in that area. 7. If therefore you learn that the Soviet Government are preparing to press patters further with the Persian Government, and if the latter ask y&lt;?ur advice, ^you should say that because of their appreciation of Persian difficulties. His ivfe.jesty's Government for their part do not wish to dispute the Persian Government's decision to grant no further concessions during the war, always on the assumption that l this decision is fairly and equally maintained, his Majesty s Government are not, however, prepared to advise the Persian Government as to the lengths to which they should go tp maintain their decision, and should it for any reason .pe revised, His Majesty's erovernment would expect that an aoolication by their nationals xor a concession would age^in receive proper consideration. 8 . For your own information, if Russian pressure were to take a form clearly incompatible with Persian . p independence, thus constituting a breach of the Anglo-Soviet- Persian treaty, I should certainly be prepared to consider taking the matter uo with the Soviet Government direct.^ But '^ i the Persian Government should not be given any assurance in advance in this sense, since such an assurance would be almost certain to reach the Russians in garbled form, with resulcs similar to those foreseen in paragraph 5 above. jh again shortly with reference to OTP!

Russian inspired Persian papers are taking the line (1) that Government decision to postpone examination of ■ ■ oil'concessions until after the war is aimed at Russia since until Russian offer was made Government was seriously considering offers from other applicants for oil in the South and ‘ (2) that:.since Anglo-Iranian Oil Company have a concession • in the South, policy of balance of power.requires that a concession should be given to the Russians in the North. • ' -• Rest of press with one or two minor exceptions does not dare to support Government strongly on’this issue. 2. Balance of power argument can be met with obvious rejoinder that Persia should think of herself as a member of the United Nations not as football between two of her neighbours. Best defence against Russian demand is however in my opinion to say frankly that no efficient State can be expected to allow j Government of another State to work a concession in the former s j 'territory; ' and that it is impracticable [grp.undec ?and] • contrary to principle of reciprocity that L.b.S.R. whose organisation excludes foreign firms and-individuals from its . industry should wish to exploit essential resources in a foreign country through one of its neutrals. I_await your instructions which I hope will not be long-stayed before using these arguments quite so baldly but'when I find Persians e*g* the \jPrime Minister using such arguments I certainly do not contra- Jldict them. This is going to be a test case and I feel we are [grp.undec] object on principle to Soviet [grp.undec ydemand], though we must be prepared to face retort that Anglo-Iranian Oil Company is really British Government F?grp.omitted 1 because of our official shares in its capital. It may be that oil . from North Persia can never compete with oil^from Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s concession or from Persian Gulf and that its natural market is Russia. Point however is not where oil would find a market but who is to exploit the oil area in Persia. //JuNv /That.., - 2 ~ That it should be exploited by Soviet Government seems to me entirely incompatible with Persian independence. 3. We cannot say what unpleasant consequences may be [grp.undec] Kavtoradze had in mind when he threatened the Prime Minister. A less courageous Prime Minister than Saed might succomb to pressure while a less honest one e.g. Qawam Al Saltana might give way even without much pressure. Saed however [4 grpsoundec]. He'believes (rightly I consider) that it is bette;: to have your country taken away than to give it away and that to concede to Soviet demand now would mean making Russia a present firstly of part and then of whole of the North and once the North goes the rest could similarly [grp.undec] out if only because it is economically dependent on the North. I trust I shall not be thought alarmist. My opinion is shared by all observers Persian and foreign whose opinion His Majesty s Government would think worth having. If His Majesty's Government consider it necessary to let ' I Russians have a free hand in this matter for the sake of advantages which it is hoped to gain elsewhere, let us at least do it with the realisation that life of Persia as an independent State and a bulfer for our protection is not i likely to be long. 4. It has been suggested that Persian Government should establish immediately a geological survey staffed by [grp. undec ?expertsj of unimpeachable reputation recruited from various countries. This would be justified since Persian Government knows little aboui its own resources and is there fore at a loss when asked to grant concessions; it would meet objection that Persian Government is neither developing its own resources nor willing that others should develop them; and it would afford a breathing space.

This oil controversy strengthens widespread belief here that until Soviet troops have left [grp.unaec] the Persian Government cannot hope to have a soul of its own. It is true that Saed hks acted with courage and independence but he will get little overt help from'his own people so long as Soviet troops are so much in evidence. I hope the moment Persia ceases to be a road for aid to Russia our troops will be withdrawn from Tehran and kept as far south as is compatible/ with protection of our oil interests during period until defeat of Japan ahd‘complete evacuation of Persia; and that every endeavour will be made to induce the Russians to reduce to a minimum the area in which they keep troops. However small that area, it will still be too large for peace of mind of the Persian Government and the people. [Repetition of undecypheraMe groups is being obtained].

There is no doubt that the Government’s decision represents the will of the Pei si an people so far as it can be ascertained. At secret session of the Mailis the only soeoch strongly in favour of the acceptation c:f the Russian request was by [grp. undec. ] hurt ash son of the former Minister of the Court who made money buying fox the Russians in Koshod and was elected with their help. Tudeh members are [grp. undec. ? in concert with the] Russians but are embarrass via by the fact that some weeks ago, when only British and American approaches had been made, one of the most prominent of Tudeh deputies made violent speech demanding that no oil concession should be given until after the war. Perhaps it is for this- reason that the chief Tudeh newspaper is giving indirect support by reproducing pro- Russian material from other papers. Small group of secondary newspapers are backing the Russian application violently with material which they are quite incapable of writing themselves. 2 . More than one newspaper has stated that the Russians do not need oil and made their ofiMr solely for the sake of the Persians. K e seems to have uttered similar cant to the Prime Minister who unfortunately forgot or at least omitted to suggest that the Soviet Geverrmomi should assist Persia by paying an economic price fur munitions and rice.

According to the Prime Minister his final conversation with Kavtoradze was to this effect. 2. The Prime Minister said that it had been m decided by the Government to postpone until after the war the question of granting oil concessions. The Soviet Government could make definite proposals if they wished, but no decision could be taken so long as the war lasted. K said that there might be unpleasant consequences. The Prime Minister replied, that if that 'was the spirit in which K looked at the question, what would have happened if the Persian Government had accepted in principle but had then objected to any of the detailed conditions put forward by the Soviet Government: the consequences would presumably have been even more unpleasant.

I am informed by the-Shah that the Persian Government . will not grant the Russian request for oil rights in the North but in order to make the refusal more palatable will say that no grant of oil rights anywhere in Persia will be made until the war is over. I pointed out that the British application v/as from a company and therefore not on all fours with the-application from the Soyiet Government but having received no instructions from His uajesty s Government since the Soviet demand came to their knowledge, I hid not urge that the Shell application should be granted regardless of all other considerations becauseiam sure that lersia cannot have the Soviet Government exploiting the oil m its territory and remain the buffer state His Majesty s Government wish it to be and because the Persian Government would never at this juncture give a concession to a British or American Company m the south while rejecting a Russian demand over the oil rights in the north. 2. We have yet to see whether in the last resort the Persian Government will have courage enough to go even as far as the Shah says they wiLland wilt n°t trytorgrp.undec] Soviet aneer bv giving rights over a relatively small area. The Shah seemecl convinced that the grant of _any oil rights _o the Soviet Government would mean the end. of ,erslan authori y in North Persia* I did not say that 1 agreed (though. agree most heartily) but said that if he and the Persian Government held the conviction they had a right to act on it. I added that the proposal that one Government should woik a concession in the territory of anpther was unprecedented and that to expect it to be accepted m a few days did not seem to me reasonable* 3.

It was difficult to reply to M. Ala off-hand on a subject of such delicacy but I assumed that His Majesty s Government would not regard the Soviet proposal with complete detachment and that I should be justified m advising the Persian Government to stand on their rights. 2 . I said there might be very valuable oil deposits in the north and Persian Government could not be expected to sign away their rights over them at a moment's notice. Persian Government had engaged American experts to advise them about oil concessions in the South and were entitled to exercise equal caution about oil in the- north. I hoped that concession in the South would be granted;to Shell Company and granted soon but I could not object any more than the Company had objected to the care with which the Persian Government were examining the competing offers. In reply^to question whether /[British Companies were interested in oil in North Persia I »j said I did not know: I certainly could not say that they were not interested and would not apply'if concessions there * were open to the world. If the situation were reversed and a Russian Company competed for a concession in the South the Shell Company could not object so long as Society of Commerce had agreed that it would be for the Persian Government to say whether they wanted a foreign Government exploitation of oil deposits in its territory. 3. - M. Ala asked whether it would not be reasonable for the Persian Government to tell the Soviet Government that they would like to await the conclusion of the International Oil conversations which had been proceeding between United States and British Governments with, he understood, the knowledge of the Soviet Government. I said I did not know that this was relevant: the natural desire to examine carefully any question relating to national oil resources was a legitimate and a better [grp. undec] for delay. /4. Finally...- 2 - 4. Finally M* Ala asked would it not be reasonable to make use of publicity - a weapon the. Soviet Government ieared* I said that several newspapers had referred to oil &gt; concessions in the South and had urged the Government to exercise the greatest caution and that any application for a concession in the north called for equal publicity. 5. M. Ala left in a very sombre mood. The day before, the Shah'* according to a reliable informant who talk with him, had spoken airily, of driving a bargain with the Soviet Government and implied that he might let them have an oil concession in return for a promise Azerbaijani and in the North generally. If the bhah ever had such a plan his talk with the Soviet representatives on [grp. undec. j will have induced a more serious mood. 6 . The Persian Government will expect advice from His Majesty’s Government and doubtless from United States Govern ment also. It seems to me that if Russians are given, without competition, the concession they ask for they will have taken a loner step towards conversion of North Persia into an autonomous Sovie? republic. I am not one of those who believe that the Soviet troops will stay in Persia in contraventipn oi the tripartite treaty but there-are ways of encouraging spontaneous for annexation and create devotion to enconmic enclaves in North of Persia under the guise of oil concerns and exclusion of other foreign companies from that area would be a potent weapon. • 7 . I shall be glad to receive your .instructions as soon as possible. I consider that we are entitled to say openly it ‘ thai ( 1 ) Oil resources being a valuable but wasting asset, applications for concessions need to be exammea with greatest care; (2) if competition in the South.is encouraged by Persian Government why not in the Month also. 8 . Your telegram No. J141 (not repeated) gives me discretion^ to use as an argument in favour of immediate. grant of (^concession in the South that the Russians at present while claiming exclusive oil rights in the north have expressly declared dAat they are not interested m the oil in the south. I yevused this argument and I must point y implies that we are prepared to leave the oil m the north entir y to the Russians P with all economic and political consoq.uen 9 es involved. If this is the considered.view of .Sis Majesty s Government now that the Russians have shown tn ®^ 1 h ^ a » 0 Le^ only say that we must then recognise that we shan be worse ofr than under the 1907 Agreement. Moreover, if th ® Government are forced toJive all the oil in the north to Russia then natural tendency will surely be to give a concession in the south to an American company so as to “dence of United States Government in their precarious independence and integrity. Their first card I am sure to try &gt;ostpone the grant of any new 91 I concessions until toreign ;roops have been withdrawn. Since we want a concossio ^ y, /4-V»r&gt;+ -xl/'vn 1 ? 1Y* 3 thau would be somewhat of a victory for the Russians, but it would be better than our getting no oil and Russians having a free hand in the north. 9.

Version given to me by M. Ala, who has just brought me message from the Shah, places the matter in another and more serious light. Message was to the following effect. 3. The Shah received Kavtaradze and Soviet Ambassador October 1st, They said that Soviet Government wanted permission to explore for oil in North Persia over an area of 210,000 &gt; (half 420.000) square kilometres during a period of five years at the end of which they would indicate areas which they proposed to exploit. 'Tney made no reference to arrangement in the past [grp. undec] ad hoc or any other old rights. Area was described as from Azerbaijan to Kuchan. Hp- The Shah said that this was a matter for his Government and that, even if the Government agreed, the matter would have to go to Manlis for approval. They said that they had been to the Prime Minister, and as they found the Government slow to move, they had come to ask the Shah to use his influence to . hasten a decision. They spoke very seriously: they indicated that Stalin was not satisfied with the present state of Soviet- * Persian relations, and said that on the reply to Soviet application might depend the .whole future economic relations (the Shah noticed at least they said ,, economic M relations) between the two countries. The Shah gathered that Kuchan* was prolonging his stay in.Persia, and that He would like to have reply to take back with him. The Russians brushed aside the Shafrs remarks about need for careful consideration of a question so important and so highly technical. When the Shah [grp* undec] applications now under consideration for oil concessions in the South the reply was 'but that is quite different. Those applicants are companies but this is Soviet Government'. 4. M. Ala will inform American Ambassador October 2nd. (r- 5. See my immediately following telegram.
