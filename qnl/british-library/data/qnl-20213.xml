Their Agent Advocate Abdul Jalil Bartu. Respondent:- Advocate Sulaiman ash Bhawwaf, Guardian of the insane Kamal bin Abdullah bin Isa az Zuhair in relation to the estate of Abdullah az Zuhair and estate of Ayesha az Zuhair* Subject:- The Court of First Istance, Basrah, decided, on 15th July 1958 in Court of First Xastance Case Mo,373/952, to prevent my clients, the appellants from raising objection against the heirs of Ayesha az Suhair, and cancelling Tapu documents Ko # 15 f 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18, dated august 1915 (for properties) situated at Faddaghiyah^raising their hands frooi them and registering the same in the name of the heirs of Awasha az Zuhair, The Judgement of the Court of First Instance was coxamunicated to me on 15/9/1956 and on tlie same day I submitted a memo, of appeal and paid the necessary fees. When the case came up for hearing by your Court it was decided that the Surety Bond attached with the memo, of appeal wasI -4- was written in the future tense and it was t therefore, considered that a Surety Bond was not present, that the nemo. of appeal was devoid of the necessary condition and for last this reason it was rejected. As the/para of article 186 of the Qiyil procedure Law declares that if the appeal period has not yet expired, the unfulfilled requirements can be completed and, that should there be necessity for the preparation of fresh application, the appellant is entitled to do so. In view of this clear legal statement and the comment ofl this article by Ustad Geyid Daud Samra, who said, '♦A decision was passed by the Court of Revision at Constantinople on 14/11/318 allowing tne completion of the Surety Bond during the rest of the period of 30 days coimaencing from the date of the announcement of the order in respect of the rejection of the application, and the Iraqi Appeal Court upheld this opinion In several decisions of theirs; thus the unfulfilled conditions were completed within the remaining period'# As the decision passed on 14/11/518 was in connection with a case which was exactly identical with this one las can be seen from the copy of order attached) , the Court of Bevision considered that the Revisional Surety bond was not in existence and your honourable Court held the same view in this case too# As I prepared a fresh ourety bond in which the surety undertook to accpet liability for all losses, damages, necessary expenseB, travelling expenses, fees and Court fees which might be sustained by the Respondent when my clients have been found unjustified in their appeal, I request that a day for hearing may be fixed, the Respondent be suramoned, an order be passed reversing judgement appealed from^the case of the plaintiff ( the Respondent) be rejected and he be made to bear all Court i fees, Advocate fees for conducting the litigation before the Courts of fir st Instance and Appeal and fees for thethe preparation of this petition for the folio?/ing reasons (1) My client - the appellant - is the Chief of an iimirate (the Sairate of Kuwait) ; independent in all her affairs from IHA4 and the Govermaent of Iraq has no sovereignty over it. In view of the general Ixiternational Law the ordinary Courts have no jurisdiction to try any head of Government or pass a judgement against him. This is supported by the views of all lawmakers. The Cyclopedia of English and Imperial Laws states (as translated) as follows in this connection^- rt It is not permissible to try Governments and their heads before the Courts as that goes against the sense and principles of the International Law. Ho exceptions are to be made to this except in 2 cases, i.e. when Go^ernmente 1 or their heads enter into litigations before the Courts as parties to a case, the defendant is empowered to submit a demand to them; and, if such a Government or its head owns properties in the hands of a third person, they can be tried with this person. This also applies to Headsof Protected States and Districts,is it does to kings.' Fart 1 .4805 sub- para: 404 and 405 of the said authority* There are other view and decisions to this effect which I mentioned in my petitions to the Court of First Instance. The Respondent agreed with me on this point and showed his readiness to except His Highness shaikh iihmad al-Jabir as-Subah from the case whereas the International Agreement to which I referred, as can be seen by your honourable Court in para 2 of this petition, is an agreement concluded with Shaikh Mubarak as Sub ah, the bequeather of the appellants, which contains a provision making it applicable to him and to his heirs. The acceptance of the Basrah Court of First Instance of a case against the head of an indeKpendent Gwermaent in spite of his objection to it, is contrary to Law and its judgement is liable to be reversed.-6- I V (2) The hear lag of the oas© t the judgement whereoT has been appealed fron, is outside the jurisdiction of the Court as the British Government, on 3/11/1914, concluded a treaty with Bhaikh Mubarak as Subah, the bequeather of the ing appellants contain/a clear under talcing by the British Government to protect the properties of shaikh Mubarak as Oubah and his successors In Iraq which were under- their disposal when the said treaty was ratified. It is as follows word by word:* i lore over, you demanded certain promises concerning your good self from the High Government, namely (1) ( ) which is at present under your control; the date gardens situated between Fao and Qurna will remain under your and your successors* control' j I submitted a certified copy of this text to the Court | f of first Instance. Therefore, the High British Government is the guarantor of the J^irate of ICunrait and. particularly of the family of His Highness the Huler of Kuwait, Mubarak as uubah t his sons and grandsons in respect of their properties situated in the ITilayat of Basra. According to the terms of General international Law, the guar em teeing Governmmt has right to interfere if any other Government, through its legal authorities, attempts to touch that which the Government has guaranteed. If we admit this, the dispute in this case would then, in fact, be.between Great Britain and the Government of Iraq, which may be considered as having power to protect the rights of her subjects who live under her aegis* If we say so, it would be necessary for us to refer to the Treaties which settled matters between Britain and Iraqi On 50/7/50 a treaty was concluded between the British Government and Iraq. The Iraqi Government, at article 9 of the Treaty, undertook not to injure the existing undertakings and previl^-es, which may exist^ in respect of the British Government, provided such/3 Utecf undertakings do not oppose the Covenant of the League of Nations or the Treaty for the Prevention of War signed at Paris. This is the text of article 9 in question. ^This Treaty do ;s not contain anything which might, in any way, injure the existing rights and undertakings or those that may exist for or against any of the two Contracting Parties in accordance with the Covenant of the League of nations and the Treaty for the Prevention of War si lined at Paris on 27/a /l9Z9 n . As the properties,for the cancellation of whose docuiiients a case has be n filed, were in my clients' possession on the date of the ratification of the Treaty, as admitted by the Respondent himself, it is undoubtedly one of the undertakings given by Britain to someone else prior to the ratification of the Treaty of alliance between Iraq and Britain as also it is one of the undertakings which Iraq undertook not to Injmee, as the Iraqi Treaty is a law which the Iraqi Courts should act upon. It may be said that the present ease is in connection with a private property in Basra owned by H#K.^aikh ilhiuad as Bubah, the Amir of Kuwait, in his private capacity. This statement is incorrect, as H*H.Tha bhaikh of Kuwait is the Head of a -State. Should he go to another State and own property there, his official designation cannot detach from him. On the other hand, the undertaking of Britain to the Head of the Kuwait state in regard to his properties in Basrah cannot be regarded as mi ordinary matter, but it is purely an international matter. Therefore, to disregard this defence and to hear the case in spite of the existence of this undertaking binding the Government and people of Iraq is against law and shoalc. be cancelled. (3) Article 10 of the i^nglo- Iraqi Treaty clearly says as follows. Should any misunderstanding take place-8- in regard to its application or interpretation and the two Contracting Parties have not been able to arrive at a settlement between thamselves by direct negotiation, the difference is to be dealt with in accordance with the terms of the Covenant of the League of Kations. M No doubt, in view of the adherence to this defence of my clients who are the Heads and Members of the Baling Family of a Foreign atate, it is incumbent on the ordinary Courts to desist from settling the dispute in the ordinary way, and should ask those concerned to approach the Iraqi Government for addressing the Chief of the Kuwait state or the British Government in a diplomatic way. Therefore, to disregard this point and to proceed with the case in the ordinary manner is contrary to law and should be cancelled. (4) This case is to be rejected for another reason,i.e. f the properties in dispute belong to the appellants - my clients- and have been under their control since 15 years and more, with which they have been dealing without any objection. This their disposal is based on formal Tapu Document issued from a competent authority and by the order of a competent official. The plaintiff - Abdullah az z.uhair kluself was present in Basrah all that time and was witnessing the appellants dealing with these properties. Also his bequeatheress, who is saia to be the owner of these properties had numerous agents, some out of whom/were lawyers licenced to practise, and others were distinguished personalities who exercised influence in this country. l*he bequeatheress actually filed a number of cases in the Basra Courts and was represented by a number of lawyers on the strength of general powers of attorney, bhe was ntt in an isolated town distant from Iraq and she was quite aware that my clients - the appellants - were disposing these properties freely. Moreover, she did not advance any claim until the tirae of her death. Therefore, filing of a case '•mm**********!/**If 9. « Jo 8tlno3 v VI ' 0 1© Xfi lo ^ Uiaat DilB ^VBf asaaieToC i •t iid dnj (^) leqoiq si!? J evB£l iine tloidir iUI * qal^ lieilJ ns^e^soo B ea*.

The reply given by plaintiff's agent - the present Hespondent - on this point was (1) that 'There was an admission by me that these properties were owned by Awwashah az ^uhair.' This is against fact. If your Honourable Court examined all my plaints and petitions, they would not come across any admission in respect of the ownership of those properties by Ayeshah az ^uhair. I believe that the respondent wants to obtain such an admission out of my statement that my clients owned these properties in a legitimate way from the bequeatharess of the plaintiff many years prior to the expiry of the period of limitation. The difference between the two versions is not indistinct. iO'ticle 1674 of Mejallah Code, on which the Hespondent relied, is clear and goes agtinst his contention. The admission that invalidates the limitation, in view of the &amp; kx clarity of the article in question, is the admission regarding existence of rights for the plaintiff against the defendant at the tine of admission. This is the text of Article 1674 in question. Ho clair will drop by reasons of limitation. Therefore, if the defendant makes a clear admission before the Judge that he owed the plaintiff at that time in a ti .e-barred case, as claimed by the plaintiff, the time limitation is not to be considered, and judgment is to be given on the admission of the defendant. ?? The Commentators of the Majallah considered this a precautionar binding. The late oelim Bazqi, who made comments on the Majallah, said as follows. 'The phrase 'at present 1 is a precautionary binding and is construed to mean that the admission of the defendant does not invalidate the limitation of time unless he admitted his indebtedness until the present time. For instance, if one claims property from another saying that he owned it or inherited it from his father andh -10- tiie defendant replied that lie bought it from his(plaintiff 1 s) father and uncle from whoci he(plaintiff)inherited auch and such thing , and that the property has been in his^defendailt , s) possession since 40 years, it needs no proof.' He further said, 'If heidefendant)did not admit the property at that time, his admission does not invalidate time limitation.* No one of us made any confession to the Respondent or to the bequeather of the insane, who is under his guardianship, regarding the existence of any right for anybody to these properties. The whole of my defence is a total denial of any right which the plaintiff claims to these properties which were registered and owned by my clients who have been disposing of them freely and without any hindrance for a period more than the recognized perioa of limitation. Then where is the admission on which the Respondent reliesv (2) That his client was absent and that the absence debars time limitation. This statement is to be rejected too. The absence that debars tine limitation under Article 166S and 1664 of A1 Uajallah Code is the absence which does not enable the absentee to claim his right through an attorney, such as being in oonfinment or in a place having no means of communication with the place at which uhe case is to be filed or confined in a quarantine on account of epidemics etcetera. This is clear from Article 1665 of Majallah Code. The said article quoted various decisions about minors and absentees. It is said that time limitation does not apply to minors at all and more definitely declared that time limitation is not applicable to minors whether they have guardians or not, but in the case of the absentees, it is legally applicable to their representatives. The object of these two different rulings is that the case of an absentee is different from tthat of f disability. In the case of disability it makes no difference whether there is a representative or not, but in the case of an absentee, the existence of an attorney, who may either ben »a» -11- appointed by the absentee or the Judge, the time limitation is applioable. This is the view of the jurisprudents. Besides that, Sayida Ayesha az Zuhuir whom the Respondent alleg es tf that the right came to him through her ? , had access to her properties in Basra and had numerous formal attorneys there who held general and legal powers of attorney from her, axid she ha a filed several oases in Basra through thera. Therefore, the action of the Court by disregarding the above and issuing an order for the cancellation of the Tapu Documents on the authority of the alleged admission, is against law and should be set aside. (5) A b regards the contention of the Respodent that defence about time limitation in respect of a Royal Document (Sanad Khaqani}is not to be heard. He could not substantiate this opinion by quoting any provision of law. article 1660 of ill Majallah Gode clearly defines that cases about properties, estates and inheritances cannot be entertained after 15 years. ; e have no other law amending this article. This article is in general terms and stands as it is. It is incredible that your honourable Court should pass such an order which is contrary to law. The agent of the Respondent mentioned this point and alleged that many similar decisions gave were passed by your court but he neither produced nor/a reference to any such decision. The only decision which he produced was one issued in Case iMo. 77/1950 - shaikh iuhmad al Jabir as-Bub ah versus ilafia'h bint i^li Pasha az Zuhair. The decision in question w&amp;s passed in a case quite different from this one, as my clients* disposal of the properties in dispute in this case is based on a Tapu document issued from an official department and by a responsible official as far as his duties were concerned. More than the limitation period has passed since my clients have been disposing of the property in this manner. Ho formal document was1^ -12- produced in Case Ho#7? of I jo O referred to above except a sale deed executed outside the Tapu Department, and no question was raised regarding possession by limitation period* One of the oases, Hos.75/1921, 119 and 155, was between partners. Your honourable Court decided at that time that disposal by a partner is not subject to limitation* This case i slower or, quite different from that one# The other two decisions were to the effect that no personal evidence is to be heard for the cancellation of formal documents. I did not ask for personal proof of my clients 1 disposal of this property, but my defence is supported by a Tapu document recogised by my apponent# ./here is the resemblance between the two cases? It would, therefore, appear to your honourable Court that the Respondent wants to benefit from judgments passed by your Court in cases quite unlike this one# This is not admissible. On the contrary I have come across several decisions passed by your honourable Court accepting defence on a question involving time limitation to respect of disposal of an iamovable property registered in a document. One of the decisions in question is the one issued under Iio.2bl/l9E5 and published in A1 , ajallah al ivdliyah (Law Garnette), Part IIXI, End Year, page 10, which runs as followsi- * f Mo defence about disposal after the period of limitation will be heard in respect of property registered in a reliable document unless defence about the expiry of the period of limitation depends on any of the authorities of ownership on the strength of a written document.' Is there any written document more authentic than a sanad issued by an official department? Another decision issued in Case Wo.597/1936 and published in Parte 3 fic 4 of the Law Gazette, 2nd Year, is as follows:- 'If the plaintiff filed a claim asking that the13~ Is a&amp;di defendant be prevented from raising any objection in respect of a house belonging to her and admitted that he had takan it fraa her by force 18 years ago and included it in his own house, it is necessary that her case should be rejected, as this period is above the period of limitation. I'here are other decisions which we need not quote as they are better known to your honourable Court. It would, therefore, appear to your court that the defence of the Respondent which was heard by the Court of First Instance, is against law end should be set aside. (6) The case, as defined by article 161^ of A1 Lajellah, is a claim submitted by one person against another. There should exist a condition that the thing claimed is a right of the claimant. The plaintiff in this case entangled his case with th« estate of ^yesha az ^uhair which was transferred to the plaintiff, Abdullah az uihair, without the existence of any right of a olalxa to these properties as, according to the Shara* division, iiyesha died on 21/10/1931 and the plaintiff - the Respondent - admits that we have been possessing these properties since 15th August 1915 on the authority of the documents produced. The right of putting a claim is, therefore, quashed, ^yesha az Zuhair was alive and her estate was transferred to the plaintiff. Therefore, the right of putting a claim did not exist in respect of this estate. The result is that this case was filed by a person not entitled to do so legally. The action of the Court of first Instance in disregarding this point and passing an order nullifying the Tapu documents, is against law and should be set aside. (7) If we took it for granted that the Appellate Court, In other cases, nullifies documents in respect of immovable properties executed outside the Tapu Department, those findings, according to principle, cannot form a basis for judgment in this case. If we leave judgments of the14- m 10 Appellate Court aside and refer to the Law applied in this Country we do not find a single Law annulling sale deeds executed outside the Tapu Department. All what is there, as is evident froia certain Appellate Court decisions, is that they relied on Article 1 of the Law Concerning Disposal of Immovable Properties. If we were to examine this Article carefully, we would not find it to apply to pure properties, but it concerns State and Waqf lands only. The sentence, 'And as disposal without a document is not admissible, so the hearing is not admissible too etc.y may be interpreted to concern disposal of pure properties, but this interpretation is wrong, as the disposal to which this Article refers is 'defined disposal* which was referred to above,i.e#, tate and aqf lands, oome decisions are based on the High Decree(Iradah)issued on 10th September 1518. I searched £5or a text of this Decree but could not get it. l t however, got a copy of the instructions issued by the Ministry of Interior to the Yilayats putting this Decree into operation. On going through it f I found that it did not annul deeds but it prevents hearing of cases. Ho doubt there is a great difference between hearing of a case and annulment of deeds. As we were not claimants in this case, the provisions of this Uecree are not applicable to us as they have no lega^ strength. If we admit this point and take up the question of how my clients possessed and de&amp;lt with these properties, we will find that they owned them by a legal and authentic deed dated 21st kuharram 1327 given by the Agent-General authorised %q execute the said deed on the authority of a genuine and formal power of attorney. e will also find that he was approached in due course about the registration of the property in the Tapu Apartment and the Ministry approved the registration as can be seen from the letter of the Vali of Basrah Yilayat submitted with the papers of First Instance case, hile arrangements | were being made for the registration, Basrah was occupied, by the British forces and the Controller of Finance of the Expeditionary Force Issued orders for the registration of the property in —111wppp—(TPiliP' — Bl-15- 7-1 question in the Tapu records, which was done. Uo doubt the British Government, when occupjring Basrah, was an invading Government entitled to organize tLe affairs in the territories that fell under their control according to their own desires. The General Officer Commanding the Expeditionary Forces issued a circular in August 1915 titled ?t Law for the Occupied Territory of Iraq* 1 , Part a, item 47 of this Law, under the heading 'Miscellaneous Items', is as follows:- 'Courts established under this Law do not apply the Ottoman Penal and Civil Procedure Codes and what relates to statements of law'• In view of this, the officials of the Expeditionary Force were not using their power - according to law but were acting on instructions received from the General Officer Commanding or his representative. The Tapu officials in Basrah received written instructions from the Finance Officer (air Henry Dobbs) to register these properties in the name 6f the sons of His Highness the Shaikh of Kuwait which was done. Tlii s act of Sir Henry Dobbs is a legal one at that time as a declaration was issued confirming similar acts performed by Sir Henry Dobbs. The declaration in question is No.52 dated June 1919, and from its text it would be implied that prior to its promulgation, this duty was performed by the said Controller of Finance. The formalities under which the properties were registered in the name of my clients do not differ from registration of sale deeds executed when the Tapu Departments were closed on account of the occupation, and such formalities were considered by the said declaration of 1919 and Law made by the Iraqi Government in 19B2 as proper and the properties have to be registered in the Tapu Department without the presence of the parties but simply on the attestation of the Political Officer. It would appear to your honourable Court that sale deeds executed outside the Tapu Department are not null and void but, as said by the Egyptian Court of Revision, would remain as they are until after registration and would not concern anyone not a party to the transaction. At for parties, mr sum&gt;v '(Hi rfa 14, m T cs 11 i tali 8-i K iol' -16- they are considered to be genuine and valid deeds lilce other genuine deeds. (8) The Tapu docusients which are in my clients f possession were issued under the written order of the Controller of Finance (Sir Henry Uobbs)during the Militaty occupation of Basara by the British. Ho doubt the officials of the invading Government carried out their duties properly. The authors agreed to the genuinness of the functions of the conquering power. Ustad Ahmad Hasha*t Bey, Lawmaster in the Law school of ^gypt, states in his Book 'lUsalat-al-Ithbat* as follows:- 'If the legitimate Government was overpowered and the conquering power appointed an official, the written instructions itfieaafl •«!; of such an official are considered to be legal as he is in fact ■•i ^10 sal* an official*. If we say that his actions are illegitimate, this would cause the public interests to be delayed and the works stopped, as there is no one else to perform the duties. If they wrote documents containing civil rights for or against the public, they should be accepted. - Ho doubt it is in the public and special interest that such papers and documents be regarded as official.' rj£ r rjv * ^ Aocordiag to the bhara' of iwadt lalaa, judgments passed by a (Jadhi appointed by a conquerpower are acceptable. This j opinion is also upheld by the -jnglish author, Qoodnow in his book 'Contemporary Law or Administration' , Part 2, page 25, under the , Heading 'Office Defects'. (9) This case is also subject to Indian Limitation Act. The Tapu documents on the authority of which my clients hare been dealing with the said properties, were given to them under Order Jio.504 of 14th June 1915 from the Inspector of Finanoe(5ir Henry t Dobbsjwho was acting for the General Officer Uomiaanding in the administration of the Finance of tha country. The Tapu Department ii • was one of the departments under his purview. Therefore, the order passed by 3ir Henry Dobbs is an order passed by a-17- 'competent Government servant as far as his duties were concerned 1 '. The Indian Limitation ^ct specified one year as the period during which one can file a case for the cancellation of such an order, as is clear from item 14, Article 1, Part 1 of the Indian Limitation -act. In view of this, the right of raising an objection against the competent Gover nment servant ceased on 14th June 1916 on which date the Indian Limitation Act was still applicable in Basrah. In view of the clarity of 'Regulation for the Cancellation of Laws*, the period cannot be extended and, accordingly, the right of putting up a claim in this case has elapsed. Therefore, the action of the Court of First Instance of Basrah in disregarding this point is deliberately against law and the Judgment should be set aside. In view of the above ana to the petitions which I submitted to the Court of First Instance and the reasons that X will put up before your honoutable Court, it will be clear to your Court that the judgment appealed from is contrary to law in several respects and liable to be set aside, I repeat my request for setting it aside and rejecting the Hespondantts (Plaintiff's) claim and making him bear all Court Fees of First Instance and Appellate Courts, advocate fees for conducting both the First Instance and appeal qses, fees for preparing the petitions ana travelling expenses.

I had. secured an air passage to Basra today, returning tomorrow, as I hoped to find out from the Shaikh's son what is going on over the surrender of the gardens, and if nothing were l^eing done, as seems to 'be the case, to encourage him to obtain some definite statement one way or the other, from the Mutassarif. 2. I have now to cancel this as owing to the King's death obviously nothing will be done for at least three days 'by officials in Irag, moreover for all they know there may be a new Government, and they will certainly delay any action until they can tell better what is going to happen. 3. We can therefore only wait again for developments. 4. Incidentally, the Shaikh tells me that the 'fellaheer put in by the Mudir, are largely (a) rt bad hats' turned out by the SABAH, and (b) Persians from across the frontier, who the Shaikh in the past was careful to release gradua lly in order to avoid criticism. . _ * on'tie Sir Trenchard Powle, KGIE., CEE., olitical Besident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.. 14* nfllential .

I see that you say in it M I rather wish it had not occurred to me* so that I think you will not mind my criti- zising strongly this possible new view of our obligation. If the Government did take that view, I suggest that it would (a) bring us into grave disrepute, thus working against the object we are trying to achieve, the public and honourable discharge of part of our 1914 obligation, and (b) be contrary to our commitment in 1914. 2. To explain the latter statement I think it will be clear if we imagine a similar situation today. Suppose that we are again about to land at Fao, to retake Iraq.. The night before the troops land, having in view our recent experiences over the gardens, you telegraph to me 'Please inform Shaikh as follows Begins: 'His Majesty # s Government guarantee that you shall remain in occupation of y our gardens etc. ends. H The Shaikh tells Abdulla Salim and others. Abdulla Salim and others, who have, of course, a share in the gardens rejoice. Then you, (having thought of the aspect now sugges ted by you), send another telegram ••My immediately preceding telegram. We only guarantee Shaikh's personal share in gardens, and that of his 'descendents'. CO e Hon'ble Sir Trenchard fowle, KCIE., GEE., Bushire.- 2 ' tffo AMulla Salim and Oompany are much depressed, 'but £ou have made it clear what you mean. How we are going to implement this (the imaginary and qualified) promise, in case of a test, as there is no territoria] division, and attwat ) administers the whole estate, I don't know 'but at least you have said what you mean. Cox did not say so. In other words, when Sir Percy Cox on 'behalf of His Majesty's Government said 'your' gardens, he must 'be taken to have meant 'the gardens which you, the Shaikh of Kuwait, as head of your family occupy in Iraq.'. 3. I 'believe it is a fact that members of Ara'b families club together to invest in an estate to 'be 'bought in the name of the head of the family, and that this was in fact, to certain extent, the case for some of the Shaikh's estates, and as also these Ara'b families are always marrying their cousins I do not envy anyone the task of unravelling the exact obligation of Mubarak's descendents vis a vis the remaining SUbah and vice ¥ersa. 4. I might add that if the first object is to save the tax payer money we can easily do so. We made it clear that it was in 'return' for the Shaikh's 'valuable' (military) assis tance that we were giving the guarantee. I have never heard that Mubarak did give the specified assistance, and I don't fcras think Ahmad could prove that he did. ¥e can step out of the whole thing on that ground if we want to do so, to the advantage of the tax payer but very much to the discredit of Great Britain in Arabia, and extremely late in the day. 5. My main argument then is that that it is too late now to take this new view, and that if we had done so, in 1914 or even in 1918, it would have landed us in more difficulties than there have been already, e.g. at the present moment we should be explaining to the Irao. Government that our obligations only cover/.£819? -3- u-1 cover part of the gardens, and that as far as we are concerned, the Mudir of ]?ao can remain in occupation of -/- ths of the gardens, i.e. that proportion of them which belongs to those of Mubarak f s family who were not his heirs. I say that having for 25 years accepted the fall obligation we must also fully discharge it, and that acceptance of the full obligation was the only practical course, and is the one which we have hitherto accepted in practice throughout the period since His Majesty's Government's promise was made twenty five years ago.Confidential . /V/ Political Agency, 4 D.O.

If they did, I am not sure, unless the majority of them do so, and produce strong reasons, if we ought to agree and press the I Shaikh for a family council. As you know the Arabs are individualists, and ambitious, and much 'better at dis rupting than building, and we should not encourage them in disruption in this instance. 2. The Subah family, faced with extinction as a power, recently gave their renewed support to the Shaikh and he was thus enabled to achieve his come hack. If, however, the Subah family, of which of course the Shaikh is one, 'become divided, not only they 'but the Shaikh and the State will again get into difficulties. 3.

Translation of letter dated 20/4/1939 from Advocate AMul Jalil Partu, Baghdad, to Shaikh Muhammad al Ahmad as Subah, Basrah. After Compliments. I have received your kind letter with which I was very pleased. In compliance with your request I am writing you a detail of the case. At 9.30 A.M. I attended the Court after I had received your 2nd iafcte telegram at the school in the morning of the day of hearing, i.e., at 7 A.M. when the officer on duty who took delivery of the telegram on my 'behalf attended. I applied for permission which was granted to me at 9 A.M. Vb 9.30 A.M. I was in the Court. Soon af|er my arrival there I telephoned to Captain Holt and informed Mm that I appeared in the Court in order to conduct the case in compliance with a telegram sent to me by you and en uired from him whether he had fresh instructions for me. He replied in the negative and asked me to see him after the hearing of the case. Then I left the telephone and went to the Court Office. The recording clerk informed me that he was instrtcted by the President to postpone the case and to send me a summons at the Ministry of Defence through the Military School. He also informad10 • i - prlvatsl? that all the oasea were postponed as that day -am a day of festivity for the Jem and Baud Saara did not r. ^ ^ attend. He, however, aald that the ahaonoe of &gt;aud Saara does not matter as there are other Judges oa the Court and it was possible to hear the oase if the President that 1 was present. I wanted to go to the President and ask him to hear the case hut I thought the matter over and found that ay appeal was 'based on a legal opinion written hy aaud Sanra in his hook and we oould oatoh hia on this point should he he hearing the oase. But if ha is not present the other judges may not 1)101 themselves with the opinion of Daud. saara which he wrote in his hook. X, therefore, agreed to the postponement of the oase mi asked the oleric to inform the Head-aaster of the Military school about the aummoiis. I then went to see Captain Holt hut oould not find hi® in his place. I left hia a note, giving him my address and asked him to send for ae if he so slahei. On the 2nd day I received a message froa hia at the school asking me to go sad see him oa iednssday at 6 P.M. At the exact time 1 reached the Embassy where I met him and had a long talk witn hia on the subject. He asked me whether It itas necessary for another lawyer suoh as Tusuf s~ KBbir to Jo^n me. I replied that I was dulte agrs^ble to that. I actually spoke to fusuf al Keblr but he refused to do so ia the begiiiaing. Thea he promised to do so,hut was aot deiinite.

I discussed with Ustad Yusuf al Kebir this morning about the sitting that will be held on 4th May for hearing the appeal# Ustad Yusuf is not prepared to appear in the Cpurt, bu t he will give his opinion as an adviser. He recommends the appointment of another lawyer to help you in the Court, and to take up the case should there be anything to prevent you from appearing. However, I hope you will do your best to appear in the Court personally. Please do your best to visit Ustad Yusuf early, and discuss this point with him, ascertaining from him that all the necessary preparations have been completed. Y.Holt•q(o Translation of letter dated 9th Rabi al Awwal 1358(28th April 1939) from Shaikh Muhammad al Ahmad as Subah, Basra, to K.H, Shaikh Sir Ahmad al Jabir as Subah, K.G.I.S., G .S .I., Buler of Kuwait. After Compliments. I forward herewith a copy of a letter sent by the British Embassy, Baghdad, to Advocate Abdul Jalil Partu, in which they stated that Advocate Yusuf al Kebir has declined to appear on the day of hearing, but that he agreed to act as a legal adviser for this case. The Embassy asked Advocate Abdul Jalil to engage another lawyer to help him in conducting this case, and that both of them should appear on the day of hearing, as Advocate Abdul Jalil might perhaps be prevented by some unforeseen event from attending on that day. The case is now subject to two courses* The first is that Advocate Abdul Jalil should conduct the case alone, and, if this course is to be adopted Abdul Jalil requests that I should write him a letter in that sense, and that he need not appoint another lawyer. The second course is that another lawyer should join Abdul Jalil in which case he asted me to pay such a lawyer not less than 150 dinars out of which 50 dinars are to be paid in advance and the balance, 100 dinars after the case succeeds, and that the 50 dinars may be remitted to him, and for the balance we execute a written undertaking* In case we agreed to this course, he wants me to send him a letter authorising him to engage another lawyer who can conduct the case. As the decision rests with you, I have reported the matter to you with the request that you may pass orders on the subject as early as may be possible, though by wire, as tiiue is very short* Usual Ending,Translation of letter dated 8th Rabi al Awwal 1358(27-4-39) from Shaikh Muhammad al Ahmad as-Subah, Basrah, to telephone to go and see him. I went to him and the following conversation took place between us. He said, 'I called on the Mutasarrif yesterday and spoke to him about the question of the seizure (of the date- gardens). He apologized and said it was not a real seizure but a nominal one, that it was carried out as some Basrah people owed the Government Miri taxes and Badal Mithl, and that everyone was saying why did the Government not recover their dues from the Shaikh of Kuwait. In order to stop the people from saying so, he caused a nominal, and not a real, seizure to be made. That the Government have no intention of disposing of the property, and that there is no objection now if as-Subah agents returned to their properties provided that every agent is in possession of a certificate duly attested by the Notary Public, Basrah,' The Consul added,'The Mutasarrif said that he presumed that even Muhammad son of Shaikh Ahmad was not in possession of a power of attorney,^ I replied the Consul that I had a power of attorney from my father. He thought it desirable if both of us went together to the Mutasarrif. Then he said it would be better if I go alone and show him the power of attorney. After leaving the Consul I called on the Mutasarrif and showed him the power of attorney but he was displeased with the phrase. 'And this power of attorney does not empower him to accept service. The said agent,]&amp;ihammad, is not allowed to accept service on my behalf in respect of the suits and cases that may be filed against me in the Courts,or judgments and legal documents passed against me.' H.H.Shaikh S ir Ahmad al Jabir as-3ubah, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Ruler of Kuwait. After Compliments, At 9.00 A.M. the British Consul asked me on Z 7 /, JL. -t fo * ^Yftiile I was speaking with the Mutasarrif at his office, the Consul came to visit the Mutasarrif and there was a lengtfcy conversation between them. The Mutasarrif asked the Consul to read the power of attorney and said to him, tf Is it proper for him to file cases and recover his dues from the Iraqis, whereas the Iraqis are not entitled to sue him as his son is not authorised to accept service?' He requested the Consul to write to the JMbassy about this matter. When the Consul asked him how they brought in new farmers and evicted as-Subah farmers, the Mutasarrif said that he would turn out anyone wk against whom we have a Court Judgment, Then the Consul said, n 12hat about the others?' The Mutasarrif began quibbling and giving out of the way replies about the others# The result is that he did not give us a satisfactory answer about the other farmers. Then the Consul asked him why they prevented as-Subah agent from collecting rents of shops and houses in Fao. He said he thought he was prevented from doing so, as he had no formal power of attorney. This Mutasarrif will give us much trouble by his quibbles. The Mutasarrif told the Consul that the Shaikh of Kuwait had no Tapu documents for all his properties. Later on all of us agreed as follows:~ I should prepare a power of attorney for the Fao agent empowering him to deal with the properties and collect rents, and another power of attorney for .the Faddaghiyah agent empowering him to deal with the properties, and get both of them attested by the Notary Public. Afterwards I should take them to the Mutasarrif, get a letter from him to the Qaimmakam of Abul Khasib who will give me a letter to the Mudir of Fao Nahiya. I will inform the Consul of further developments. Usual Snding#EXPRESS LETTER (AIR MA1L1 i?** an ORIGINAL message sent bv AIR MA IT. inhs*i, . expeditious than the ordinary mail and is ihtJl ft.

'On my last visit to Kuwait I accordingly approached the Shaikh and informed him verbally of Kis Majesty's Govern ment's proposal in paragraph 2, I also informed him about v 3&gt;. (Mis- tm , / the family Council (see my telegram Ho.T/S? of 27tt! 'ebruary P V 1939). The Shaikh expressed no opinion on the adequacy or v^V\ 0 otherwise of the proposed compensation, but had strong objections to it being paid to a Family council. 3. I need not at present deal with these objections as there is another and more important question to be settled, as follows. Ml along the payment has been proposed to be made in respect of taxation losses 'on the late Shaikh Mub arak's estates In Iraq' (e.g. paragraph 2 of Foreign office letter No.3.941/39/93 of i5th February 1939).

If His Majesty's Government decide that the present compensation is to stand then no further action is necessary. 6. If, however, they decide that the compensation should he revised then jay oomments are as follows, j),|i(fc. !8C b . (1) the division of the date gardens between 'heirs of TiUbarak', including of course the Shaikh him self, and the 'non-heirs of lubarak' must be either: - (a) that the heirs oan certain definite plots of land in the gardens and the non-heirs, other plots, or, what is more likely, (b) that there is no division of areas but a division in fixed proportion of the inoome from the gardens, (2) What we have to ascertain is the proportion of the annual taxation which the Shaikh paid on account of the heirs, 7. (1) If it is a case of (a) then we will have to deduct from our taxation basis the amount paid by the Shaikh for the produce from lends owned by the non-heirs. U) /S» (8) If it Is a oaaa of (1)) then ire will have to reduce our assessment by the prcroortion in which the inoome is enjoyed by the non-heirs. V 8. I asked de Gaury to try and aseertein verbally from the Shaikh, without of course giving away the reasons for his enquiry, what was the position of the whole of the Subah family in conneotion Mth the date gardens. de Gaurv* * ''I• reply was that it was a case of paragraph 6 (l)(b) for the fao estate, of 6 (l)(a) for the Jarhaniya estate, and the remaining estates were ormed solely by the heirs of Mubarak. But this in the oiroumstances cannot be taken as a final authoritative statement, and if it is decided to re-assesa the compensation we shall have to request the ahaiirh for an official statement. 9.

He only said that the Law Court is there in which to file a case against them. 2 # I understand that bin Hamdi iB in posession of a document saying that he is the ovmer of the ^addaghiyah', so if we file a case against him he will produce the document. That is j»st what they want. As the Mutassarif was himself a solicitor he knows all about the law. Besides,we heve never put in any gardener on our property without making an agreement with him as follows., the gardener is to cultivate the land # and the owner has the right,if he wishes to keep the gardener,or to dismiss him at the completion of the season year, without any notice. Of course. Sir, all the gardeners we have on the 'Faddaghiyah' have such agreements with us,but the Mutassarif says that you cannot dismiss a gardener without an drder from the Court. I have told him that I have various agreements with them which empower me to send them away at any time,I say that when we have a proper agreement why should we approach the Oourt to send away any gardener? Other land owners in Basra do the same as us* We have a clause in these agreements showing that at the end of each year the owner has the right to let him stay or send him off, and the gardener never objects. 4 # We do not know why the Government now object. If we were tJ) file a case against each gardener, this would Of course cost us much, and in the end,Sir, let me tell you they would give ever^ case against us. Co^ Scl- w.cU.

They wish to engage another lawyer to be with me in order that he might be present at the Court in time if I am a bit late, but they do not want the lawyer to appear in Court with me. Their object, it seems in this, by keeping another lawyer, is that if I am a bit late he might get an adjournment of the hearing of the case. I said I would be present in time. They did not agree to this, and they are trying to get the lawyer. 2 P Then 1 told them that we should have an experienced lawyer so that he might be useful to me in conducting the case, but they are arranging to engage an inexperienced one at low fees. Yusuf al Kabir said that they would pay this fee from the iSmbassy Funds. I will go tomorrow to Yusuf al Kabir to see the new layer. TT 3^ According to this, there is no need to send a letter to Advocate Abdul Jalil Partu to proceed with the case alone f and also there is no need to inform him to engage another lav^yer himself. We will not, therefore, 'v send the money which he wants in advance, as the Embassy are engaging a lawyer themselves.

Basrah, After Complin ats. I appeared In the Court on the day fixed. The Court sat but I found that a fifth member was added to the usual members of the Court. I repeated my statement a^d, after discussion for more than two hours, I was informed of the decision rhioh, I regret to say, contained the rejection of our second petition, and was given by a majority of votes. I learnt that in the previous session the President of the Court and another member were on our side and two members on pur apponenVs stta side. According to law, if a decision is given in this manner, the President's side is considered to be the majority, but it appears that the Presld ent did not agree to bear this responsibility. He askfcd for a fifth member to join them and Abdul Aziz al Mutair was called who, it is understood, was on our apponen^s side. The decision was thus passed by a majority of votes. I telephoned at once to Qaptain Holt who asi®d me to see Ustad Yusuf al Kabir whom we should meet together. I went forthwith to the place of TJstad Yusuf al Kabir and explained the situation to him. He spoke to the Secretary and it was agreed that we should submit a request to the President of the Court of Cassatic asking for the cancellation of the limitation period, under paragraph 2 of Article 7 of Kules for Law Courts. If he agrees to the cancellation, for which we will have to pay fresh Court fees, I shall let you know in due course.

Sir# I have the honour to report that on receipt of ^- wdt i ^ ' Your excellency* s telegram Bo. 3 of Ma/ 29th regarding the property of the Bhaiich of Koweit, I requested Shaikh Mohammed to call and see iae. g. He came here yesterday and I informed hi si of the tenour of the statement made by his father to the Political Hesident and asked him for an explanation. I reminded him that on 19th Jay he had declared that his agents had been re-instated in possession of the properties at Feddigiyeh and FaOf so I could only presume that either he had not reported this to the haikh or that the latter was under some misapprehension. I finally asked him to write a report on the present position of the case so that there would be no further misunderstandings one way or another. A copy of his letter together with a translation is enclosed herewith. 3. The /ish and eat aarKet referred to was built by the Port Authorities to replace an old insanitary market which had previously occupied the site. A t our last interview Shaikh Mohammed said that he expected it would shortly be handed over to his agent. 4. He mentioned too that he had been told by some judge in Basra that the attachment referred to in paragraph 4 of ay dBspitch No. 8 of 89th April had not been cancelled or withdrawn although it was not being given any practical effect. /' xcellency Sir Basil Newton f K.

More important however, is the failure of the authorities to allow the ex-employees of the Shaikh to return to their holdings* I do not know whether diplomatic representation o n this point would be advisable or whether I should again take the matter tip with the Mutasarrif of B^era.

Our agents, therefore, went to ?ao with the letter from the Qaimmaqam and delivered it to the Mudir of Fao. After perusing this letter the Mudir of Fao told our agents that they were at liberty to collect rents from our properties, and likewise ordered the different lessees to pay the rents due to our agents, The only exception made Is in the case of Fish and Meat Markets without any reason. I, under the circumstances, wrote a letter to the Qaimmaqam , Abul Khasalb on the 23rd May 1939 on the subject requestinf him to in truet the Mudir of Fao Nahiya to deliver the Fish and 'eat Market as well to our agent with the rents realised. I have likewise written to the Mudir of Pao Nahiya, but so far have received no reply. As regards our estate at Feddigiyah, our agent went there as arranged, but finds himself in adverse circumstances, and therefore is afraid to leave his house in case he is molested by the Pallehin installed therein by the Mudir Mahiya when the properties were attached. We have tried our best to eject these F allahin with a view to replace them by our old Fallahin , but of no avail. M udir Nahiya objects to this being done. The result is that these new Pallahin do not care for us or for our orders, and consequently their existence in our properties is detrimental to our interests. The best thing, therefore, is that these Fallahin be turned out from our property, and our old ?allahin re-instated for our future good. In the end please accept my best respects, Yours sincerely, Sd. Mohammed-al-Ahmad-al-Sabah.b?t ( IA- 0. No^ 117/64/39.

You are undoubtedly aware that when I Met h.s .the Uutasarrlf and both of ub agreed to the arrangements which are known to you, he gave me a letter to the Qalmiuakam of Abul Khasib who, in turn, gaire our agents a letter to the Mudir of Feo Mahiya. The Agents went to Fao and delivered the letter to the Mudir of that Nahiya. Vhen the liudir read the letter he told my agent that he can recover the rents and also informed the tenants to pay the rents to my agent, but he continued putting his hand on the meat and fish markets without any reason. I, therefore, submitted a petition to the Q.aimmaiu.m of Abul Khasib on 23/8/50 in that respect and requested him to instruct the Mudir of ?ao Nahiya to raise his hand from the Eieat and fish markets ana to hand them over to us with their rests. The petition was forwarded to the Mudir of ?ao bit I hare not received any reply so far. As regards our properties in Faddagfrly^, our agent proceeded to that place but remained his house as he could not go out lest he may heve any trouble with the fellahin who were appointed by the Mudir of f.o at the time of the seizure of the properties. I tried on several occasions to turn those fellahin out and to re-instate our previous fellahin but the Mudir of »ao objected to that and instigated the ne. fellahin to oppose us and to disregard our orders. No doubt the presence of those fellahin/-- 2 - our pi*QP«rties contrary to our wish, will create a lot of difficulties for ub .

It will undoubtedly 'be awkward, as he says, to have to go 'back to the Sheikh on this matter, and if the distinction now drawn 'by Powle is a real one, it is very unfortunate that the point was not cleared up 'before. 2/ ■allay, Esq.., ^gn Office, S.W.l#2* A fter looking into the matter however? we are of* opinion that the 'basis on which conpensrtion has heen calculated is in conformity with the spirit of the pledge of 1914. Some light is thrown on the question in the descriptions of the elate gardens which were supplied •by the Political Agent in 1932 and 1934 and you may find it useful to refer to those. (See Bushire memoranda f , No. 651~S of the 12th September 1932 md No. 1087-3 of JM the 24th November 1934, copies sent to the Foreign Office with India Office letters No. P.Z.5707/32 of the 23rd September 1932 and P .Z. 7729/34 of the 21st December, 1934). We are concerned only with five properties, the Mutaawa 1 ah, Fadda ghiyeh, Ujairawiyeh, Parhaniyeh and I'ao estates. The first three do not now concern us, since they are stated to 'be ov/ned solely 'by the heiES of Mubarak, the Parhaniyeh estate is said to 'be divided physically 'between heirs and non-heirs. It appears to 'be small and comparatively unimportant. The Pao estate, the largest of all, is not divided up hut numbers of non-heirs as well as of heirs are reputed to have an interest in it. Both estates were in the possession of the Sheikh's family for many years (at least 40 and 80 respectively) before 1914 so that it is prohahla/3. prcfoalDle that Muloarak then shared his interest in them with others; hut these others were presumably all members of the family. The system of administration v /as descrihed in para. 6 of Annexure II of the 1934 papers referred to ahove in these wordsi 'Prom earliest times it had heen an axiom in the policy of the various Rulers of Koweit, to themselves manage 5 for internal political reasons, the Fao estate on 'behalf of the fami'ly as a whole and pay out monthly salaries to individiuals instead. This gave them that control over the various members and branches of the family which is necessary in an Eastern Kingdom, as it enabled the Rulers to keep the family united in the face of pressure and danger from without.' 3. There has been discussion in the past as to whether the 1914 pledge applied to 1914 property which passed subsequently out of the possession of the 'descendanis 51 by sale# gift, marriage or otherwise. But although the facts, at any rate as regards the Fao estate, have been generally known for years there has not, I think, been any suggestion hitherto that the pledge applied only to date gardens which belonged to Mubarak personally in 1914 and did not extend to the whole of the Pao estate;/4. estate, i»e. to the date gardens which were then under his control and administered 'by him. This latter interpretation seems to us reasonable; there can 'be little doubt, that it is what Mubarak himself understood the pledge to mean; and both on the merits of the case and ■because matters have already gone so far with the Sheikh we very much hope that you and the Treasury will agree that the basis on which :we have 'been working need not 'be disturbed. 4, It is impossible to deduce from the information svailalDle in Fowle's letter what would 'be the financial result of applying a rigorous distinction between 'heirs 11 and 'non-heirs 5 '. In addition to a reduction in the amount of compensation for taxation losses to 'be paid to the Sheikh there would also of course be a reduction in the presently accepted extent of His Majesty^s Government's liability to compensate the Sheikh in the event of his being dispossessed of the i^'ao and Parhaniyeh estates. 5, I am sending a copy of this letter and enclosure to Wright. 1^, PEES—MIC ■ HI' .^1 ftfn. ri VfiHIRE RESIDENCE No--7**-. natc.. 8 / !/^ ■: COKFIOENTIAL RECORDS at Bagdad HIS Majesty's Ambassador presents his conipliments to Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, and has the honour to transmit to him the under-mentioned documents.

You will have seen from this letter that the Political .esident has suggested that the amount of compensation offered to the oheikh of Koweit on account of losses suffered by the taxation of his date gardens in Iraq may have been over-assessed on a faulty basis, and that it may therefore be thought necessary to revise the basis of the assessment for compensation by deducting therefrom the amount of taxation on the property of members of the Sheikh's family other than the heirs of Sheikh ubarak. 3. We agree with the India Office, that whatever the right view to take of this problem may be, it would from the political point of view be most unfortunate if we had at this stage to tell the Sheikh that we had now decided to offer a smaller sum than that originally calculated. We have gone so far with him that I feel it would be a mistake to turn back now if it could possibly be avoided. To do so would cause great offence and, as you know, we are anxious that the matter should be disposed of without further delay and without leaving behind it any feelings of unjust treatment 4. At the same time, the arguments in paragraph 3 of Peel's ^ b* IS* . letter seem to us to be sound and we agree that the basis on which compensation has been calculated is in conformity at least/ Nght, Esq. . ^eaaury.2. least with the spirit of the pledge given to Sheikh Mubarak in 1914 # 5. We very much hope therefore that all concerned will feel able to decide that the Koweit assessments should be allowed to stand. But I do not think: that it in any case affects the Sheikh of Mohammerah's heirs. The compensation walcn we are offering them is calculated according to the t axation ratio of their estates during certain years to the estates of the heirs of Sheikh ^ubarak^ The fact that these estates may be now found to belong to slightly different people than we thought does not alter the ratio.

Dear Peel, ^^ Would you please refer to your letter of 10th ultimo 3 (P.S.3445/39) to Baggallay about the compensation for the Sheikh of Koweit, and Colville's lettfer to me of 23rd ultimo on the same subject (copy of which I suppose has gone to you). We realize that there may be strong arguments for standing to what has already been said to the present Sheikh about the amount of the compensation, irrespective of the merits of the case, but we should like to size up the merits separately first. If a good case on merits can be made out, then we are saved the necessity of considering the always disagreeable question of acquiescence or not in the results of a mistake,. The question raised by Fowle is primarily whether the word 'descendants' in the English translation of the 1914 pledge to Sheikh Mubarak covered 'non-heirs' as well as 'heirs', but your letter appears to make the question primarily one of 'ownership or administration'. In your second and third paragraphs you refer to the basis on which the property was actually administered in 1914 and you contend that Mubarak would have regarded the pledge as covering not only the gardens owned by him personally out also those owned separately or in combination by his family but controlled and administered by him. l\ow that Mubarak himself is dead, his actual area of ownership or administration would appear to be no longer relevant but I take your contention to be that, if the 1914 pledge covered Mubarak's area of administration as well as his area/ mEsq., M.C., ^ia Office.area of actual ownership, so it should 'be regarded as covering also such area as is actually administered 'by the present heirs. That seems the most that could be claimed on that line of reasoning. I gather from your letter and its enclosures that the Pao estate is in fact administered 'by the present heirs just as it was 'by Sheik Muharak in 1914, The share of the non-heirs in the Parhaniyeh estate apparently is not 5 but you say that estate is small and comparatiyely unimportant. This pointj i.e. whether the 1914 pledge covered gardens in the administration of Mubarak as well as those owned by him ? seems a primary one. The wd rd used in the English translation of the pledge is 'possession'. As there seems to be no talk in the file of reference back beyond the translation to the Arabic original Y^/hen points are in dispute 3 I take it that no copy of the original Arabic pledge was made or that it is now no longer extant. But as the present question is one of compensation for tax liability5 the incidence of the tax on the property owned by the non-heirs but administered by the heirs should presumably be the guiding consideration. It would seem to be implicit in any reasonable claim by the heirs for compensation in respect of the tax in past years on the property administered (but not owned) by them that they 'had in fact finally paid the tax on the administered property. Equally it should be implicit in the inclusion of compensation for the future in respect of the administered property that the heirs should continue to pay the tax on it. Alternatively in either case the heirs should hand out to the non-heirs the proportionate share of the latter in the capital payment made as compensati on/3 compGnsation. Is it known what tho position is in this respect? If the problom is to be looked at from the angle, as suggested in your letter 9 of ownership or administration, the question whether 'descendants' covered non-heirs as well as heirs would 'become secondary. But the latter question would still have scope as regards that part of the Farhaniyeh estate owned 'by the non-heirs which is not administered by the heirs» And the whole problem can still be looked at from this angle, rather than from that of ownership or administration. Here too I am assuming that we c si not now ascertain the true meaning of the Arabic word in the 1914 pledge which is rendered 'descendants' in the English version. There was I find some discussion in 1929 on the use of 'descendants' in the English version, but it was as regards its use insteac of the more usual term - according to Colonial Office 'Vvjfl' rK Crvvi.' letter '68214/29 of 11th October, 1929 - 'successors'. The Foreign Office in a letter E.5244/1358/92 of 19th idem said that 'descendants' would appear only to include the actual heirs of the Sheikh T s body. (There is no mention of looking up the Arabic word). The word used in the English translation of the pledge to the Sheikh of Mohammerah is 'heirs', and prima facie one would have expected the same word,, or words with the same meaning, to be used to the two Sheikhs in 1914. The letter to Sheikh Mubarak containing the pledge to him says, in fact that 'I have addressed a letter to the Sheikh of Mohammerah similar to this I am • writing you'. TOeirs' is the basis on which the question of compensation in tho Mohammerah case is being approached. In so far as the question is to he decided from the angle/4 9 angle of the meaning of 'descendants^ ? it would seem also 'to be implicit, at least on merits, that the ^ion-heirs should get their appropriate share o.£ the total oompensatioE if that is assessed on their tax also, -^as otherwise the heirs receive an openly uncovenanted benefit. Finally we should 'be grateful if you would enlighten us as to the distinction between heir descendants and non-heir descendants in this connection. Does the former mean descendants on the male side only or only some of those? I don 7 t know whether illegitimacy enters into the distinction in Arab conditions of life. I am sending a copy of this letter to Baggallay. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) S.H.Wright.jolpoGOVERNMENT OF INDIA. 1 Department.

The literal translation of the Arabic words used is: 'Your gardens of date palms which are at this moment beneath the grasp of Your Honour, situate between Fao and Qurnah, shall remain xn I your control and the control of your successors without there being upon them anything of taxes and imposts', i y/e are advised that the phrase 'beneath the grasp'' appears etymologically to imply property of which the Sheikh had entered into personal possession by right of ownership, but the phrase 'in your control' | appears to cover property over which the Sheikh or his successors exercised /absolute |h. Wright Esq., II Treasury, Whitehall, S. W. !• ' ' 111^—TT'-2- absolute control T/i-thout-n-G6€s«ar-i-ly • enjoying ^personal omcrship-. Tiie- Ara bic word vtoch has boon rondorod as 'successors' is aklillf (plural of khalaf). This means, in the lirst placo, 'successors', and its cognate form 'khalf is used in the Qur'an to mean 'succeeding generation' (of a commuixLty in a perfectly general sense) . When the T »7ord 'father' is ex pressly used (khalaf abihi) the 'VTord then comes to denote quite strictly 'son', in the sense that a son succeeds his father in the administration of his property. Dr. Arberry, who translated the Arabic for us, y/as not prepared to say whether in Mohaume dan law the term 'klahaf' can include descendants other than direct male issue, or political successors who are not necessarily related to the original owner. Incidentally we had better avoid using the terms 'heir' and 'non—heir', partly because they do not appear in either version of the 1914 pledge and partly because according to Mohammedan law parents, grandparents and other elder relatives are entitled to share in an inheritance. Thus their use may obscure the issues. 3» is quite possible that on the strict interpretation of the English version and to a lesser extent of the Arabic version of the 1914 pledge, the figure of £1,087, on the basis of which we have calculated the payment to be made to the Sheikh in respect of future taxation, may include taxation on some property which was not covered by the pledgee; e.g. property which } although controlled by Mubarak and by the present Sheikh, was not owned by Mubarak. Q11 the other hand, the figure of £1,087 may conceivably not include taxation on some property which was covered by the pledge; e.g. property which was owned by Mubarak and which is /nown ow o-wiied and controlled and on which taxation is paid by 'successors' or 'descendants 11 of Mubarak other than the present Sheikh. 4. It seems clear that, partly by reason of the differenee between the Arabic and English versions of the pledge, and partly omng to our ignorance of the precise legal position of some of the date gardens, any examination of the question how far the figure of £22,000 which has been offered to the Sheikh in compensation for future taxation is too high (taking the letter of the pledge as our criterion) would be likely to present considerable difficulties. We should have to rely largely upon the Sheikh for information as to the legal position of the gardens and as to the extent to which the application of the strict language of one or other version of the pledge would result in a revision of the figure of £22,000. It is unlikely that the Sheikh would be very forthcoming, and it is certain that the controversy which would probably arise round the points at issue would make the conclusion of our negotiations with the Sheikh for the settlement of this tiresome dispute more difficult. The Sheikh would certainly contend that the pledge has hitherto been treated as covering all gardens controlled by Mubarak and now controlled by himself. In this connection you will remember that our plan is to make the Sheikh a 'take it or leave it' offer of a fixed sum, the amount of which we would refuse to discuss. If wo make enquiries of the Sheikh at this stage on the points indicated, the Sheikh might seize the opportunity to bargain for a higher figure of compensation calculated on a different basis. In any case it seems doubtful whether /a■ 111 a strict application of tho language of eithor of the two vorsions 01 the pledge 'VTOuld result in a material reduction in the arjount of compen sation to be paid to the Sheikh, and you mil of course appreciate that the nore delay there is in tho settlement of the dispute, the bigger v/ill be the bill in respect of past taxation. 5. We therefore hope that the Treasury will agree that mg may instruct the Iblitical Resident in th© Gulf to press his negotiations with the Sheikh to a conclusion, without suggesting any revision of the total figure of,£22,000 already offered to him in compensation for future taxation. We are, however, ready, if you wish, and if the Foreign Office agree, to instruct the Political Eesident that, if ho thinks there is any foundation for a fear that th© payment to the Sheikh of £22,000 in respect of future taxation might prejudice our freedom of action in the event of the Sheikh claiming, at some time in the future, compensation in respect of any loss of property which may not bo covered by tho strict language of the 1914 pledge, he should tell the Sheikh that it seems possible to us that the figure of £1,087^ on tho basis of which that of £22,000 has been reached, may possibly include taxation on some property which is not covered by the strict language of the pledge; but that, in th© interests of an amicable and spoody settlement, we do not propose to go into this point in respect of compensation for future taxation. 6. As regards your apprehension that we may be proposing to pay compensation to the Sheikh in respect of taxation payable by others than himself, fi^iiro of £1,067 3- s annual average of the /taxationn%' taxation paid by morchants on dates oxportod by them from wardens under the Sheildi s control and of the taxation paid by the Shoildi'is agen t e Moreover you Ya .ll recall that the Sheikh is being required to set up a family council to which payment mil be mde, and to give us a discharge on behalf, not only of himself, his heirs and successors, but of the 'other heirs of Sheikh IJubarak and their heirs'. Por the reason indicated at the end of paragraph 2. of this letter ito had bettor ask the Resident to alter the phrase 'heirs' -wherever it appears in tne suggested foria. of discharge to 'heirs and successors'. 7.

Will you accordingly, if you see no objection, please take the earliest favourable opportunity to press for the acceptance of the proposals of His Majesty s Government, in accordance with the instructions which were P f 72&gt; given to Fowle in our Express Letter of the 28th February before he raised the question of a revision of the amount of compensation. These instructions require, however, one or two modifications in the light of the recent correspondence with the Treasury, namely (i) In place of the term 'Mubarak ! s heirs' reference should be made to his 'heirs and successors', since this phrase seems to come nearer the meaning of the pledge.

(ii) In informing the Sheikh of His Majesty's G -overnrnent 1 s desire to redeem their pledge to Mubarak and to compensate his heirs and successors you should explain that in calculating the average annual loss from taxation for the years 1932-36, on which the proposed compensation for future taxation losses is based, it is possible that taxation of sane property v/hich is not covered by the strict language of the pledge may have been included but that in the interests of an amicable and speedy settlement His Majesty's Government do not propose to go into this point \J / in respect of compensation for future taxation, 4. The Sheikh has already been informed that His Majesty's Government's proposal is subject to two conditions, viz. (1) that payment shall be made to a Family Council which he should set up to represent the heirs and successors concerned , and (2) that he should give His Majesty's Government a formal discharge for their liability for ccmpensat.ion for taxation losses toth for those actually incurred up to the present and for those which may te experienced hereafter. The Sheikh has demurred to the first condition (vide &lt;r t'JJ r +Vi a ta +vi tiut tViis condition Eowle's telegram No. 133 of the 14th Mar on;, has been considered essential in order to avoid any miscarriage of the pajments.

C/21 y) on the other hand this did not prevent the Sheikh from assenting to the proposal put to him, and clearly he cannot be allowed to benefit by delay for which he is responsible. I may not however be fully apprised of all that has passed between the political authorities and the Sheikh on this subject, and it may be that certain local considerations would suggest that the refund of actual past losses should be calculated up to a somewhat later date than ^arly last year. The issue of the above has been duly authorised 1 !P .Z.I 02/40 INDIA OFFICER WHITEHALL, S.W.I. 18th January, 1940. Dear Wright, I enclose a copy of a telegram from the Political Resident (fcuoopyof which should already have reached you) about the approach to the Skeikh of Koweit regarding the payment of compensation in respect of Iraqi taxation on his date gardens. 2. Provided that the Sheikh is a member of the Family Council there would seem to be no objection to Prior's suggestion that the discharge should be signed by the Council and not by the Sheikh alone. Do you agree? If so the form of discharge will require amendment, and as only compensation for future taxation losses is to be paid to the Family Council a separate discimrge fram the Sheikh in respect of past losses will be required. I enclose a suggested redraft. 3. For calculation of the amount of compensation to be paid in respect of past taxation losses we ought to receive from the Sheikh and check the actual figures for 1937&gt; ^938 and 1939* Would there be any serious objection to our proposing to the Sheikh that, for the sake of convenience, actual figures should be dispensed with and the calculated average annual loss for the years 1932-36 applied to the subsequent period? This would save a good deal of clerical labour all round and would probably not make a substantial difference in the total amount to be paid to the Sheikh. ^4. I am Y /riting similarly to Eyres.

As you Wc;r6 intorrned on the telephone, we for our part see no reason why the Family Council should not sign the discharge for any sums paid to them, so long as it is understo id that in any case the discharge is signed 'by the Sheikh® 3. I see that the third paragraph of your letter proceeds on the 'basis that the Sheikh is entitled to compensation in respect of the year 1939 ? as well as for the periods agreed upon last year: that is the years 1932 to 1938 9 and twenty years purchase for future losses. It is certainly awkward to talk now ahout 5 'past u losses if we mean losses for the years 1932 and 1938, and ,, future ,, losses if we mean losses in respect of the years after 1938. However ? to increase the amount of compensation to 'be paid to the Sheikh because of the delay in reaching a final settlement with him, would seem to put a premium on the negotiations dragging on indefinitely, and in the suggested redrafts of the two discharges which I enclose, we have gone on the assumption that the amount to be paid, whether to the Sheikh or to the Family Council, will he the same as when the matter was 'broached to him last year. If it is decided to throw in an extra year's payment, the drafts would of course have to be altered accordingly. 4. So far as we are concerned, we see no particular objection to your proposal that the losses for 1937 and 1938 (and 1939 too, if.payment in respect of last year is sanctioned) should 'be calculated on the 'basis oi the average for the years 1932 to 1936. In fact this seems to offer some advantages. Actual losses for the years 1937 and 1938 (or 1937-1939) might prove to 'be less than the average of 1932 to 1936, 'but then they might prove _ to be greater (the Sheikh would have an interest in showing that they did) and, if they did, the question might then be raised whether £22,000 could 'be regarded as adequate compensation for 'future' losses. To increase^tnat amount would, however, not only 'be undesirable^ in i se , but would 'be awkward from the point of view of tne Mohammerah heirs, since we have already fixed the amoun to be paid to them, and since this is supposed to be, roughly speaking, half what will be paid to the heirs Sheikh Mubarak. 5. r Esq., 0.3.B. 5M.

From subsequent correspondence with the Political Resident (of which copies have been sent to you) resting with his telegram of the j 25th February (additional copy enclosed) you will see that (i) We have reverted to the position (from which we departed by mistake) that compensation for both actual and future losses should be paid to the Fkmily Council. Only one form of discharge will therefore be required; and (ii) Prior is of opinion that compensation for actual losses should extend to and include the year 1939* share this view. We fully agree that the Sheikh should not be given any encouragement to prolong the negotiations indefinitely, but the responsibility for the long- delay in following up the first and verbal approach to him was certainly not his. We think it would facilitate the negotiations and avoid an unnecessary irritation to the Sheikh if the actual losses were calculated up to the end of 1939* would be emphasised to Prior, and if need be to the Sheikh, that that period is final and will not be extended if there should unhappily be delay in reaching a settlement# 3.

I have again discussed with Shaikh question of engagement of second lawyer. Shaikh while expressing willingness does not think this step necessary yet. He prefers that Shaikh Muhammad siiould act as go between him and Fartu. He adds that he does not wish unless absolutely necessary that a second lawyer should be made cognisant of his case and connected documents. graph I think that if Partu keeps Consul informed and Shaikh. Muhammad visits Kuwait occasionally for Shaikh*s instructions that should suffice until we hear whether land settlement is actually to take place or not.

This has to be read with India Office telegram No. » 824 dated l?~2-40. Two peints arise (a) Calculation of average undetermined past losses on the basis of the average for the years 1932-1936. (b) Should the dividing line between past and future losses be early 1939 or later. With regard to (aj* The average loss for the years 1932-1936 is £ 1087 (vide para 3 of India Office Express Letter No^P.Z.1074/39, dated 28-2-39) The Shai^Hhas in addition furnished figures for 1937 (Kuwait P.L. NoC/l69 dated 12-4-39), of which Sir T. Fowle decided that Dinars (or £s) 1134.560 only were admissible. Figures for 1938 have not been furnished by the Shaikh despite reminders, nor have those for 1939. It would save a good deal of trouble and, judging by the figure fucr 1937, which is close to the average, be fairly accurate if we took £ 1087 as the annual average loss. This need not be discussed with the Shaikh but can be put to him as a decision. With regard to (b). The India Offuce reasoning is for difficult to follow. By 'delay/which hM the Shaikh) is responsible' I presume they mean that arising from his objections to the Family Council (vide Residency telegram No.133, dated 14-3-39). On the otber hand, the delay was equally due to consideration by H.M.G. of the point raised by Sir T. Fowle, and the Shaikh would hardly feel it fair that he should not be compensated for taxation losses for 1939 ( £ 1087 if the average is accepted), especially as the offer to him made in early 1939 was merely a verbal, (vide para 7 of Sir T. Fowle f s D.O. letter No.247^ s dated 25-3-39) / and not. and not a formal one. Unless you wish to consult P.A. on points (a) and ('b) before replying to India Office, the latter may be informs that you are of opinion that (a) £ 1087 may be taken as the average annual loss (b) Compensation for past losses on this basis should cover the years 1932-1939 totalling £8694 and that if this is approved you will address tthe Shaikh accordingly. -4—A ^ U. • ZC/.

References are maricea m the margin. The Shaikh has also furnished figures for IW? (Kuwait P.ii.No # C/16^, dated 12th April 1^3b). Sir T. Fowle decided that Of these Dinars (or £s) 1134.660 were admissible (Residency memorandum No.412-S dated 27th April 1939) but the figures have not been sent on to His Majesty^ Government so cannot be treated as accepted. No reference has been made to these figures in the draft letter, and if the Snaikh raises the point it could be explained that the calculations on which His Majesty's Government's proposals iTbased werewere made before receipt of the figures for lij37, and that the accepted figure ror the year is close to the annual average icr previous yearB.

It was ascertained in 1938 that the gardens «f belonging to Shaikh Mubarak in 1914 r though administered by the present Shaikh^did not belong to him alone but to several heirs of Mubarak. This raised the question whether the earlier proposal to make a payment to, and obtain a discharge from, the Shaikh alone was sufficient, and it was agreed at an interdepartmental meeting held at the F.O# on 21st April 1938, at which Sir Trenchard Fowle was present, that the Shaikh should be told that he would have to set up a Family Council to whom payment for future losses would be made.
