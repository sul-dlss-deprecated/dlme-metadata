It also explains from which accounts the pension for the company broker, Owanness Essai should be drawn. However, due to his death the Resident explains that he has diverted a portion of the pension to his son (an unnamed boy of thirteen years of age) who he plans to appoint to his father's position once he is able; until this time is met his uncle will fill the post.The Resident further outlines the cost of a watch gifted to the Shaik [Shaikh ‘Abd al-Rasūl Khān] and provides a list of local chiefs upon whom he has bestowed gifts. Finally, the letter states that he has had to meet additional costs owing to the ruinous condition of the factory, which has required him to rent a house from William Bruce.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100075534085.0x0000e0#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
