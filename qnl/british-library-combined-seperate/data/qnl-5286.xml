Various additional foliation sequences are present in parallel; these numbers are also written in pencil, but are not circled. A previous foliation sequence, which is present between ff 7-222 and is also circled, has been superseded and therefore crossed out.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This file is divided into a series of court cases initiated as a result of the enactment of the Bahrain Nationality Law of 1937. Because the law made ownership of immovable property by foreign subjects illegal or difficult, many property owners either sold or claimed disputed property they wished to sell after the passage of the law. The file contains several of these cases where litigants either claim property or dispute the prices paid for property up for sale due to the new regulation. Most correspondence is between Persian subjects and the Political Agency in Bahrain, alongside property evaluations carried out by the Land Registration Department in Bahrain.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Property legislation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Conflict resolution</topic></subject><subject><topic>Migration law</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x0002c7#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x0002c7#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
