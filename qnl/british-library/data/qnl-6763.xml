CT7 %/ ~ ~ future settlement ol Eastern Turkey in Asia and Arabia. Note by the Si cuetakv. Poli tical and Secret I)ei &gt; autmext, India Office. At the beginning uf the war with Turkey, J [is Majesty's Government gave assurances to the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohannnera and to the Amir of Nejd, in return for their support, that Basra would never again be subject to Turkish authority. These notes are an attempt to indicate some of the factors that must be considered in determining what is to be done with it. I. Geography. The area at present occupied by British troops is but a small part ol the vilayet of Basra ; but in thinking of the future of the territory that is to be removed from Turkish rule at the end of a successful war it is necessary to consider this area in its place against a somewhat wider geographical background. That background is the Abbasid Provinces of Jezireh and Irak Arabi, which under Ottoman rule became the single Province of Bagdad until it was divided into three by the separation of the Mosul vilayet in I&lt;S78 and the Basra vilayet in 1881, This larger area is comprised within the mountains in which runs thc Turco-Persian frontier to the east, the Syrian desert and the Arabian plateau to tlie west, the foothills of the Anti-Taurus to the north, and the Persian Gulf to the south, and it measures about 100,(J00 square miles. It is a geographical unit, in the sense that its main characteristic is the river systems of the Euphrates and the Tigris, and that it lias no other natural limits than those just mentioned. For from the shore of the Gulf in hit. 30 &lt; toNisibin in lat. o7 0 only one lateral mountain range breaks the level of the plain between the two rivers, viz., the .lebel Sinjar (3,000 feet) in tlie latitude of Mosul (3(3 35') ; and from the moment that the two rivers debouch upon this plain they pursue their course down its gentle declivity to the Gulf without interruption save where the Tigris cuts through the Jebel Hamrin in lat. 35°. This range ol' hills—an incongruous heap of barren mounds, composed of sandstone and pebbles, about 500 feet high at the Tigris cutting—runs for some 30 miles along the right bank of the river, and then, on the left bank, bends south-eastwards in a low, but almost unbroken, line, to Ahwaz in Arabistan. Immediately south of it began the great irrigation works of the past (Hitter Erdkunde XI., 67^). II. Geology.- But though the configuration of the whole of this area is thus uniform, climate and the nature of the soil have marked it out into three distinct zones. The northernmost of these, extending from the foothills to a little south ol the Jebel Sinjar, being well watered by rivers and having an adequate rainfall, is a plain of exuberant fertility, where in the spring the rider is almost over-powered by the scent of the flowers which his horse treads under foot. Its potentialities have just been realised, and wealthy men further south are beginning to buy up tracts of it and take them into cultivation. Next, and extending to a line drawn from Tekrit on the Tigris to Hit on the Euphrates, stretches a wilderness—not, however, one in the sense in which the Yemen and the Sahara are wildernesses, but rather a plain which even beyond the reach of the rivers is covered with grass for some months after the winter rains; on which, where it is commanded by the rivers or in depressions, a considerable quantity of wheat and barley, according to Sir VV. Willcocks, is even now raised ; and of which he says that the presence of 15 per cent, of lime in its soil makes its reclamation very easy as compared with Egypt. Oppenheim, on the other hand, is of opinion that a good deal of this belt, at a distance from the two rivers, will always be uncultivable owing to the proportion of gypsum which the soil contains, and Chesney's Map VII. and information from other sources tend to contirm this view as regards the centre of the tract lying between Hit and Bagdad. It seems probable that it would not repay irrigation at a distance from the rivers, s. 2h2. ao even if water on a large scale could be spared for it. lUit it will always remain pasture land for the tribes in spring. Finn%, south of the Tekrit-Hit line to the Gulf stretches the alluvial plain forming the delta of the Euphrates and the Tigris, whoso potential fertility is now a matter of common knowledge—an area of [ &gt; million acres, of which 9 are at present wilderness and '2\ fresh -water swamp, awaiting irrigation and drainage respectively. III. Ethnology. —The essential unity of this great area is emphasised bv the homogeneity of its population, which is almost exclusively Arab, except for the strip of mountainous country lying between the Tigris and the Turco- Persian frontier north of the Jebel Hamrin, which is rather an off-shoot of Kurdistan than a part of El Jezireh. There is indeed a Kurdish element on the southern section of the Turco-Persian frontier, and the towns of Bagdad and Basra have, of course, attracted people of many nationalities, notably Persians in the neighbourhood of Nejef and Kerbela. But speaking generally, the Arabs form the predominant part of the population. They consist of a large number of tribes— Loriiner enumerates over 100 in Turkish Irak—the most important being the Northern and Southern Shammar (divided roughly by a line drawn from Mosul to Mejadin on the Tigris) who range over the whole area between the two rivers from north of the Jebel Sinjar to the neighbourhood of Bagdad itself; their hereditary enemies, the Anaizah, in the desert west of the Euphrates; the Muntitik, in the lower part of the delta between Kut-el-Amara on the Tigris and Nasriyeh on the Euphrates; and the Beni Lam, half in Irak and half in Persia, in tin 1 neighbourhood of Amara. The first two named are Sunnis, as are the ruling clan of the Muntifik, but most of the rest of the tribes are Shiahs. They are largely nomadic in their habits, but in the neighbourhood of water they tend to settle down into fellaheen ; for their ruling passion is acquisitiveness, and where cultivation can be demonstrated to be more profitable than robbery they show no objection to applying themselves to it. South of Bagdad, indeed, they are already only semi-nomadic, wandering in the desert in spring, but cultivating the banks of the rivers during the rest of the year. One of the first tasks of the administrator is to complete the process of trans formation and pacification to which the Turks have never addressed them selves, having been content with maintaining a very precarious peace by the time-honoured expedient of playing off one tribe against another. In an interesting note Oppenheim illustrates the task from the history ol Egypt (Vom Mittelmeer Z. persischen Gulf II. p. 81). Reference has been made above to the Kurds, and Kurdistan will be an important factor in any future settlement of this region. A belt of mountainous country, with a population of some .'&gt;,000,000, whose charactei- istics are well known, it lies between Armenia, which will presumably lall to Russia, and the plain of VA Jezireh, from which no barrier separates it, and the only pass through which Russia can emerge to the Mediterranean— the pass of Bitlis- lies in its heart. To the Power that controls the plain the Kurds will be, as are the tribes of the North-West frontier to t e Punjab—a constant source of inconvenience if left to themselves, a italic ing menace if under the influence of an intriguing Power behind them. IV. Covimiinications.-~]h\ George Lloyd in his confidential repdt on Mesopotamia has remarked that the country has three primal \ nee s communications, irrigation, and administrative reorganisation. Roads. —Beginning from the south it will be noticed that not Basra but Bagdad is the centre of trade routes; Basra being mere &gt; port at which ocean-going steamers transhi]&gt; their cargo into 11U 1 s for Bagdad. From Bagdad there are four great caravan I0Ute 1 s . i' 08t east via Khanikin to Kermanshah in Persia the route . 1 , u | ,R M\- (rr j s of our trade with Western Persia passes); on either side o . mar to Mosul, that on the right bank being exposed to tit !r 11 J and that on the left ^through Kerkuk and Erbil) to t m* ^ - ^ (Kurds); on the right bank of the Euphrates (exposed t() ne ^ on(1 to Hit, whence one branch runs to Aleppo, one to Damascus,71 it.

Mosul in turn is connected with Aleppo and Damascus, on the one hand, and North-West Persia on the other. These are the traditional lines, and traditions in this region are not easdy changed. It is necessary to bear them in mind in considering railway propositions. Uadicaij*. — Is it to be assumed that the Bagdad Uaiiway will be linished ? With the disappearance ot the I nrk and of German interests from Constanti nople its immediate purpose will have disappeared also. It was never a good commercial undertaking, for though eastern Turkey in Asia greatly needs railway development, the Bagdad Railway promised to supply it as little as did the Trans-Persian Scheme in Persia. In both cases what is wanted is not long and expensive railway connection—with necessarily high rates—between continent and continent, but the connection of the fertile hinterlands with the sea by the construction of railways to the natural outlets of trade, the eventual linking-up of such lines into a trans-continental system being lelr to be determined by the course of future development. I hus, while a through line from Alexandretta via Aleppo and Mosul to Bagdad and Basra seems unnecessary, and strategically undesirable from our point of view, either the Alexandretta-Mosul section (with, perhaps, eventually an extension to Krbil and Kerkuk to serve the fertile and petroliferous districts of South-East Kurdistan) or the Mosul-Bagdad section, seems inevitable, and a line from Bagdad to Basra, with an extension to Khanikin to serve West Persia, is a matter of urgent necessity in the earlv future. Such a line must proceed hand in hand with the irrigation works, which will supply it both with embankments and with tratlic. In a remoter future, when the development of the delta is far advanced, another scheme may be revived- Sir W. Willcocks' Mediterranean project, i.e., a railway from the Mediterranean (whether from Haifa, or an extension of the French Tripoli- Homs project) through Palmyra to Abu Kemal (or, as the French prefer De ir-ez-Zor), on the Euphrates, and so via Hit (the terminus of free river navigation, and, according to him, the future river port) to Bagdad. Waterioaijs. — What the future of the Tigris and Euphrates is to be as means of communication is obscure. Will the irrigation works render them useless V Sir W. Willcocks has given uncertain sounds on this point. On the other hand it is understood that the Germans confidently expected that, under the arrangement which was being negotiated when the war broke out, Lord fnchcape would be left high and dry at Basra in seven years. In any case, it is clear that the irrigation works must be planned with due consideration for the interests of river conservancy, which means that irrigation and conservancy must be under the same ultimate control. And, whatever may happen to the Euphrates and the Tigris, British interests require that the Shat-el-Arab, south of Basra at all events, shall always be kept open for navigation, and an early examination by experts of the problems which the river presents is a matter of urgent importance. This very superficial sketch has been given as tending to suggest three reflections, (I) that whoever holds Bagdad commands British trade with Persia of an annual value of upwards of a million sterling; (2) that whoever controls the Shat-el-Arab must control the irrigation works north of it; (3) that the Power which commands the sea, and holds Basra and Alexandretta, has two independent and equally easy lines of approach towards the pass of Bitlis. V. 1 rrigalion. I t is obviously impossible to go into this great question here. But one or two points must be indicated. As has already been mentioned, the ancient systems began with the Nahr Hafu, immediately south of the point at which the Tigris pierces the Jebel Hamrin, to the north of Tekrit. Sir W. Willcocks' schemes begin at Beled on the Tigris and Hit on the Euphrates, and these schemes hang together in the sense that quite obviously the lower sections are dependent on the upper, while the navigability of the Shat-el-Arab is dependent on both. In other words, th»&gt; Power that4 intends to develop tlie Uasrn vilayet must also he the Power that develop- the yihivet ol Bagdad, and must also be ihe I'ower that commands at least politically, the upper reaches of the rivers to Mosul and Rakku \V ith irrigation is IxuukI up the question of lahour. The entire popula- lon of the Bagdad and liasra vilayets prohahlv does' not exceed 1 'OOOOO and it has been objected to Sir W. Willcocks' scheme that lalxxlr is not lorthcomiug locally cither to construct the works or to cultivate the ncwlv- 11 ugatcd region. 1 here is considerable divergence of opinion ou (h'is point amonR competent authorities. No doubt labour in the Mast is verv .uobde, and when lf known that vol . k !llK , laiul are to ^ lia ; • 1 lvlli tel ' 1 t0 dnft towards Jlesopotamia.

Moreover, if Arab Jabonr wen not forth e mingforthe irrigation works and Indians had to be imported lor this purpose then- subsequent settlement on the soil would be nL. or les&gt; a t e C 01 ''qi ■ .

Hut the semi-nomad tribes of the delta have prescriptive rights to certain pasture grounds and cultivated areas; and when the former are made cultivable by irrigation, the tribesmen must either be provided with land and become cultivators or be compensated elsewhere; and in the meantime they will probably view the extension of cultivation with a hostility which may be greater if the cultivators are foreigners. Water rights, again, are a perennial source of friction, and will need regulation. The policing of the area should be comparatively easy. The Arabs do not love fighting for its own sake, and the l urks have had no difficulty iu maintaining order, with a fairly efficient gendarmerie, whenever they have seriously attempted to do so. Moreover, south of Bagdad, at all events, the tribes have given hostages to fortune in that they have, as already mentioned, fixed habi tations and cultivated lands for part of the year; the Government have therefore a hold over them. The Arabs are easily governed, the arbitrariness of successive rails has accustomed them to violent changes, and it is anticipated that they would settle with little difficulty under a foreign administration if it were equitable and elastic ; and the European staff required would be very small. VII. The above sketch, necessarily very superlicial, of the conditions of the country makes it possible to advance certain tentative opinions as to its future. But there is one preliminary consideration. This country of Mesopotamia with its extraordinary potential fertility and its wonderful past is a great deal more than so many thousand miles of ' light soil' which we or any other civilised Power can take or leave at pleasure. Our assurances that Basra would never again be allowed to come under Turkish authority were doubtless to a certain extent a political expedient to serve an immediate purpose. Such an expedient, if it is to be legitimate, must have a moral justification. And the moral justification in this case is the misrule of the Turk, who has reduced one of the most fertile regions in the world to a wilderness, has maintained it in that condition for centuries, and throughout his history has shown no sign of the administrative honesty and capacity necessary to reclaim it. The Power which detaches those regions from the Ottoman Empire cannot stop at that. By its action it has made itself morally responsible to humanity and to civilisation for their reclamation and development ; that is to say, it must either undertake the work itself or make it possible for others to do so. The extent of the area to be detached, and the political and administrative arrangements to be made for it, must be mainly determined by that consideration. 1 his is taken as an axiom in the following paragraphs. VIII. Area to he detached—In the absence of any geographical feature providing a natural frontier to the north, any frontier can be nothing more than a line on the map, and there is thus greater freedom for drawing it in accordance with the above-mentioned axiom, which requires that, not more need, and not less must, be taken than is necessary for the development of the country. There will doubtless be those who will urge that the simplest course is to detach from Turkey the three vilayets of Mosul, Bagdad and Basra. These vilayets comprise the whole area, the geographical and ethnographical unity of which has been illustrated above. They include the three great trade centres, with the routes leading to and from them, and the whole of the upper courses ol the Euphrates and 1 igris necessary ior the irrigation of the delta. And they comprise the very fertile tract north of the Jebel Sinjar, which might be regarded as compensation for the wilderness south of it. But there are grave disadvantages. The area is very great, over 100,000 square miles. It is true that it comprises a geographical and ethnological unit; but unfortunately it does more than this, lor it comprises part of Kurdistan, between the Tigris and the Turco-Persian frontier, and at once raises the Kurd question in its acutest form. It has already been suggested that the Kurd question may be found to be the crux in the future arrangement of eastern Asiatic lurkey, and this is peihaps the most convenient place to say a few words about it. If it were possible to set up Kurdistan as an independent whole, under the rule of a Kurd family the problem would be comparatively simple. But it is not. it is understood that there is no suitable family available ; and it is very s. l'g2. bG doubtfitl whether the real Kurd question, which is mainly an asr •' question, can be solved from within. There remain only two alternatTv- 1 that Kurdistan should be either under the political inHuence of, or actu lb administered by, the Powers to the north or the south of it, i.e., lhis«ia ^ ourselves. If it were under the political inHuence of Russia, we should never have a moment's peace ; if it were under our own, we should have the impossible task of controlling its foreign relations and should be responsible for the protection of Armenia against Kurdish depredations. Equallv impossible for us would be the task of administration ; moreover, it is liighlv improbable that Russia would be content to have a British district onher Hank in northern Persia, with undisputed control of Khanikin and the most important trade route into her Persian sphere. The only alternative therefore, is to leave Kurdistan to Russia to administer, which will be the more natural since, through her hold on Azerbaijan, she will already be responsible for the Kurds of north-west Persia. But if this is to be done, it will be necessary also to hand over to her the Kurdish portion of the vilayet of Mosul, so that the whole of Kurdistan mav be under one control and administration This portion is bounded by the Tigris on the west, the Persian frontier on the east, and the Jebel Hamrin on the south, is extremely fertile as well as petroliferous, and includes the important frontier district of Klianikin. It also includes the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's lands at Chiah-Surkh, as to which, unless they are retroceded to Persia, a special arrangement with Russia would he necessary. The Jebel Ilamrin, as has already been stated, is a low range of hills, and does not really form a natural frontier; but it is at least clearly marked, and to that extent better than an arbitrary line upon the map. In order, therefore, to obtain a consolidated Kurdistan, it has been necessary to remove from the Mosul vilayet the whole of the area to the east of Tigris down to the Jebel Hamrin. But, further, for administrative convenience, it will also be necessary to remove from it the fertile tract north of the -lebel Sin jar. For though, as already mentioned, this is part of the pastures of the Sham mar Arabs, the Kurds have also joint rights in it, and descend in the summer months to cultivate it. The Jehel Sinjar range itself is little more of a natural frontier than the Jebel Hamrin—though higher, and in appearance more pretentious- for it is said to be easy either to penetrate or to circumvent. No importance therefore attaches to its possession, and since the fertile zone extends very little to the south oi it, and since the region north of it has already been discarded, there would appear to be no purpose in retaining more of the wilderness than can he avoided. The wilderness itself in this latitude is salt, and El Hadr, the ruins of which still survive, and which on several occasions successfully resisted Roman siege operations, was probably never a centre of cultivation. South of \'A Hadr the two rivers begin to approach one another; and the border between the vilayets of Mosul and Bagdad is a line drawn across from a point a little below Samarra on the Tigris to Anah on the Euphrates. Samarra is some little distance south of the point at which the ligris pierces the Jebel Hamrin, which is to form the frontier on the left bank ; and, as has already been mentioned, the ancient irrigation systems began at that point. It is, therefore, suggested that a frontier may be made b&gt; demarcating a line across the wilderness from it to Anah, a distance o about 90 miles, or to Hit, further south (21 days' inarch), immaterial which of these two points is selected, but it is import an to include Hit, because there are to be found there bitumen, naplitna, and white petroleum, and also excellent limestone quarries. A line draun hereabouts has the further advantage of corresponding rough 1} ^it 0 northern limit of the Sawad, or alluvial land of the delta. It is not suggested that a line of this kind will not have its disadvantages, but it has been shown that in the absence of natural features the 1( ! u ^, ]l ' wherever it is, can be nothing but a line, and no line that can e ( ia ^ seems to beany better. One of the disadvantages of the ' e 1 1 ! t Y ^plpr Hit line is that the Southern Shammar move across it. It A \ () | n ( ^ 10 ( ^]j t i ca i in any case, be necessary to have this tribe under some kind of 1 )( , anC [ control—probably by means of subsidies—for the protection o I tie ioaof the Bagdad Railway if it is extended from Mosul southwards Siimlarlv on the west side— m which direction the present vilayet of Bagdad apparentlv extends half-way across the Syrian desert~an arbitrary line would have to he drawn from Ana or I lit, in a south-east direction, parallel with tin; Kuphrat s to the confines of Ivoweit, and some political control exercised over the Anaizah, for the protection of the river and the road along its ridu bank. W ithm this line the holy places of Kerbela and Nejef would form independent enclaves under Shiah control. A rough idea has thus been obtained of what is the largest area that need be detached from the Asiatic provinces of Turkey in order to satisfv ihc axiom laid down above; and it is found to be comprised within the following limits : a line following the Turco-Persian frontier from Moham- mera to Kala Nuft ; them-e running along the Jebel Hamrin to the point, hatha, where the Tigris cuts that range; thence straight across the wilderness to the Euphrates at Anah or Hit (inclusive); and thence in a south-east direction, skirting the desert, to the confines of Koweit. i he next task is to ascertain the smallest area that can be taken, regard being had to all the conditions. For example, why not simply detach the town and port of Basra, and the Shat-el-Arab below it ? Answers to this question have been suggested already. (I.) Hasra is strategically untenable by itself, as Sir A. Barrett lias already discovered. \\ hoever holds Bagdad commands it, and at the very least Kurna and Xasriyeh must be occupied as well. (2.) The port of Hasra in itsell is ol no value. It is merely the entrance to Mesopotamia. The distributing centre is Bagdad,* and whoever holds Bagdad commands not only our trade with Mesopotamia but also that with North-West Persia. It is, indeed, possible that if we held Bagdad as well as Basra, the former would decline in commercial importance in favour of the latter. But il they were held by different powers, Basra must always exist on sufferance. (3.) For commercial purposes, as well as for local security, Amara could not be omitted. It is a great wool collecting centre Messrs. Lyiu h have a press there) and has a population of 10,000. From it would be controlled the Beni Lam, who are now attacking Ahwaz and the oil concession. (1.) Thus we are committed to Nasriyeh, Kurna, and Amara. But to secure the irrigation of this tract, and the navigation of the Shat-el-Arab, control ol the irrigation works higher up is necessary. (5.) Thus the line recedes inevitably northwards, until the limit of the vilayet of Basra is reached, which is roughly a line from Kut-el-Araara on the Tigris to Xasriyeh on the Euphrates. But this line, whatever may be its merits as an internal administrative division, is open to all the above-enumerated objections as a frontier. And the simple fact is that if the axiom that Mesopotamia must be developed is to hold, the area is not divisible until the point is reached at which the two rivers enter their delta, Beled and Hit; and when that point is reached it is a convenience, rather than otherwise, to include the comparatively small triangle of land comprised by tiie Jebel Hamrin, the Tigris, and the 31th parallel. If therefore the considerations advanced in the foregoing paragraphs are sound, it results that from whichever point of view the problem is approached the result is the same, and the only practicable area to detach is that of which the line Fatha-Anah or Hit forms the northern limit. VIII. Nature of admlinstration. —It is one thing to detach this area from the Turkish Empire, it is another to provide an administration for it. Undoubtedly objection may be raised to its annexation by Great Britain. In a recent letter from Koweit the Political Agent has divided public opinion among the Arabs into three classes :—(1) that which, greatly admiring our methods, wishes to come under our protection (e.g., the Sheikh of Koweit himself); (2) that which, admiring us and desiring close political relations with us, desires to manage its own affairs (e.g., the Amir of Nejd); (3) that which neither admires us nor desires to have anything to do with us. He thinks the second predominates, but he does not mention any shade of * hi support of tliis proposition (which is perhaps sufficiently obvious) an opinion may be quoted which came to hand almost as the words were Iwunjf written. Foreign Office telegram to Sir W. Townley, No. '1 Commercial, of 1st March : ' Messrs.

Aziz liey el Mazii lias shown some anxiety as to what our intentions are, and has indicated that if annexation is our policy lie cannot hel|. us.

She will probably require of us some assurances regaidnig the free navigation of the Shat-el-Arab, but, when the eontr of he whole lurco-Persian irontier down to Khanikin has been ..iven t,. her, she will assuredly have no basis for territorial claims to Mesopotamia lint it IS at all events worth while to consider possible lines of less lesistance. fhe only alternatives appear to be (I the creation of •n, In,!,. pendent state ; (2 the establishment of kind ^^c on o 'S annexation bv Persia. ^uicoiuiciic, (1.)

(c) A puppet ruler with an effective British administration. If a man were forthcoming whose selection for such an invidious position would give universal satisfaction, there might be something to he said for this alternative, though in view of the history of Egypt it can hardly be regarded as satislactory on its merits, while as a political device it is worn somewhat thin. (o) There remains the alternative of annexation by Persia, which is in many respects the natural heir of Mesopotamia. It is attractive, but, surely —with the experience we have had of Persia during the last quarter of a century wholly impracticable in any real sense. It is not even yet certain that the Persian ' rovernment will be able to hold together such territories as they already possess: to hand over new ones to be administered by them could hardly be justified. It is not, however, necessary that the adminis tration should be Persian, and the analogy of Berar may perhaps furnish a solution oL the problem. Mesopotamia would be placed under Persian Hovereignf //, but leased to (Jreat Britain in perpetuity for a substantial rent. W hether this arrangement would prove workable in a case where the sovereign would be foreign in a sense in which the Hyderabad State (in which the sovereignty of Berar is vested) is not, requires careful considera tion. It would certainly involve great administrative and international inconveniences ; and it would only be practicable on one condition, viz., that the lease was absolute and perpetual, unattended by any pledges or assurances regarding an eventual rendition, or by any conditions that would give the sovereign any right (however shadowy) of interference in the internal or external relations ol the leased area. This would be the more necessary in that, if Persia continues to exist as a nation, she is bound to come more and more under the control of Russia. But whether it would satisfy the peacock vanity of Persia is another question : the amount of the rent would doubtless exercise an important influence. The problem in many respects resembles that of the Soudan, after its reconquest. But a similar solution is hardly desirable, even if it were practicable, and it is not practicable because Egypt in fact undertook certain responsibilities towards the Soudan which Persia could not undertake towards Mesopotamia, and annexation in the present case must be nothing more than a fiction, unless it is to defeat its own purpose. On the whole the disadvantages of creating fictions and international hybrids seem greatly to outweigh all the advantages ordinarily presented by the line of least resistance, and it is submitted that there is no practicable alternative to annexation and direct administration Great Britain. f The next question is how this administration should be carried on. The most obvious course is incorporation in the Indian Empire. India is the nearest British possession, and must be the base for the defence of Mesopotamia ; her relations with Mesopotamia have always been close and, through the Political Resident in Bagdad she has come to occupy a foremost place in local politics; while the administrative problems awaiting solution are those with which precisely the Government of India are most familiars Yet there are grave disadvantanges in adding to the responsibilities of the Government of India. Even Burma has always been somewhat of a step child ; and a vast possession, with almost inexhaustible potentialities, separated by the whole length of the Persian (Julf, could not fail to introduce serious administrative complications into the already sufficiently complex system of Indian Government, and could not expect to receive the close attention which would be the justification for subordinating it to an already subordinate Government. Moreover, it is quite conceivable that the next few years may see constitutional changes in India of a far-reaching nature, the result of which may be wholly incompatible with the efficient adminis tration of a colony in the early stages of its development. Further, it is fairly certain that the Indian type of administration is not exactly what is wanted. The most reasonable constitution would seem to be a Governor- General, enjoying the same measure of independence as the Governor-General of the Soudan ; and following the same analogy, it would probably be found s. 262. C&gt; I 10 possible to associate with liim, after the lirst few years, a small advisory Council. The area being small, and the administration simple, the European staff of the Administrative Service would be loo small to be self -contained (probably a dozen men would suffice); if so, it might be recruited in combination, and be interchangeable with the Soudan Civil Service. The controlling authority iu this country would be the Foreign Office. The objection to this arrangement is the difficulty of providing funds* It will probably be some years before the country is self- supporting, and considerable capital expenditure will be necessary at the very outset. There can be no doubt that its requirements would be more intelligently and more liberally met by the (iovernment of India than by the Treasury. But the financial responsibilities of India are already sufficiently areat, aiid though she undoubtedly stands to gain greatly by the acquisition of this new possession, it is doubtful whether the application of her revenues in this direction could be justitied. IX. Protected Area. -Some of the considerations bearing upon the area to be administered and the nature of the administration have now been suggested. But it is clear that if on the one hand it is necessary to reduce tho area to the narrowest possible limits, it is on the other hand impossible to leave it -as it has been left above—standing in the middle of a no-man's- laud. Nature has provided it with frontiers to the south and to the east. But to the north and west nothing better has been found than arbitrary lines across the wilderness, and it has already been hinted that, for tribal reasons, it will be necessary to extend our political control in the shape of a definite protectorate beyond those lines. The next question is where that control is 10 stop. It would seem necessary that it should not stop until the points are reached at which the control of other civilized Powers begins. There must be no ragged edges in this settlement, and where we do not now definitely extend ouTinttuence it is certain that the neighbouring Powers will extend theirs. Those Powers are Russia and France. Russia has already been liscussed. If Armenia and Kurdistan are to fall to her, our protectorate muse extend up to the foothills of the Tur Abdin north of the Jebel Sinjar. \s has already been mentioned, there is no satisfactory dividing line even there, for the Kurds come down to that fertile belt in the summer. But that is probably only a temporary state of things which will disappear as culti vation becomes permanent. Xisibin, Mosul where it will be necessary to maintain a British Resident), and the upper waters of the I igns up to tne point at which irrigation first becomes possible, would thus be m our splieie. This is important, because though it is improbable that tor a great many years to come any irrigation north of the .Jebel Hamrin will be contemp a e , it would not be safe to allow the upper waters of the river, on prosperity of the delta necessarily depends, to pass under the control another Power. ^ , . ,1^ aw ™- The trade of Mosul, it has been suggested, may find its outlet at Alexan dretta, the importance of which, as the outlet of all the L ' olue ^^ 1 , . m( j routes of which Aleppo is the centre, can hardly &gt;r £ ee which-if we cannot obtain the control of it ourselves ^nms^ port.

On the west coast of Arabia the Grand Sharif of Mecca will probably throw off the Turkish yoke and makes himself master of the lledjaz. South of the Jiedjaz we have promised our diplomatic support to secure the autonomy of Seyyid Tdrisi in Asir, and we have concluded a protectorate treaty with the Mavia Sheikh, at the extreme south of the Yemen. But between ■Mavia and Idrisi is the Imam Yahya, who must in some way or other be brought into line if peace is to reign in the Yemen and in the Aden Hinrerland. The Yemen, indeed, must be regarded as somewhat of a danger point. It has very great potentialities ; wo do not want to annex it ourselves—moreover we have solemnly assured the Arabs of the Yemen that we do not desire to extend our territory; and it is quite certain that Italy covets it. Now the Arabs detest Italy more than any other Power, and we could not acquiesce in any arrangement that gave her the Yemen without losing the confidence and goodwill of every Arab from Aden to Mecca. On the other hand there is no Arab whom we can establish there except the Imam, whose claims to it are pretty well founded. Although, therefore, he has so far given us no assistance, we shall be bound in self-defence to maintain him, subject to an adjustment of his claims with those of the Idrisi to the north and of Mavia to the south. The prolongation of the border of the Aden Protectorate, north-east across the desert to meet a line drawn due south from the neighbourhood of OjV ir, was accepted by the Ottoman Government as marking the •southernmost limit of their claims. This line will in future presumably serve to delimit the sphere of Bin Saud, who lias made himself the heir of Ottoman power in Central Arabia. This sphere will require a little further delimitation in order to satisfy the claims of the Sheikh of Koweit which were sacrificed to political exigencies in the recent negotiations with Turkey. The coast district of Katif, therefore, which falls to Bin Saud, will end at Jubail-al-Bahri instead of at Jebel Manifa ; the lictitions distinction between inner and outer Koweit will presumably bo abolished; and Uin Kasr and Safwan in the north restored to the 1 Sheikh. South of the line across the desert the whole of the coast of Arabia is already under our undivided influence, except El Katr (with whose Sheikh the Government of India have been authorised to conclude a treaty) and Muscat, whose independence is jointly guaranteed by France and ourselves. If the price asked is not too high, it would be worth while to use this opportunity to eliminate France of Muscat. A further word must be said about the Hedjaz. It has been a principle of our policy to leave the Caliphate to take care of itself as a matter o( purely domestic concern to Mussulmans; but we have made no public announcement on the subject. If the de facto possessor of the Holy Places is Caliph, and if the Grand Sharif of Mecca definitely dissociate^ himself from the Turks, he will ipso facto become Caliph, at all events temporarily ; and when Turkey's wings have been clipped, as it presumed that they will be, there will be no Mussalman Power possessing both the will and the power to eject him. The only source of possible danger to him will be Arabia itself. But in Arabia the only Chief capable of disputing his claim is Bin Saud, and Captain Shakespear, in a report written shortly before his death, has assured us that' we have little need to fear an attempt on the part ol Bin Sand or his family to arrogate this title.' I he W ahabisonly acknowledge the first four Caliphs, and the trend of Arab opinion, as Captain Shakespear heard it expressed, was that, if, as appeared to be anticipated, Knver Pasha should displace the present Sultan. ' the Caliphate will by common consent - of Islam revert to the descendants of the Prophet's family m Mecca, - of whom the present head is the Sharif, and who I feel sure would command ' Bin Sand's support in such an event rather than his antagonism. In that case the question will have solved itself, as we desire, and in favour of a candidate whom we have guaranteed against attack. The upshot of these considerations is thus a British protectoiate o\ei hall the Svrian wilderness and the whole of Arabia. If this sounds rather formidable ;i little further examination of what is meant by 44 protectorate in this connection will dispel anxiety. It has been shown above that, m the absence of a natural frontier for the administered area in Mesopotamia, andjn view of the nomadic charatier of the neiglibouring tribes, a (leliuite protectorate in the immediate neighbourhood is rlio only alternative to the annexation of a much larger area. Northwards, therefore, of the Fatha- Ana line, and westwards of the Euphrates, agreements with the tribes are necessary in order to secure the trade routes, whether roads or railways, to legnlate paM nir i i^lits, aiKI to prevent those tribes from becoming instruments of intrigue in the hands of possibly unscrupulous neighbours. This much must be undertaken, whatever happens to Arabia. But when we come to Arabia itself the position is very different. We already stand in treaty relation- with the whole of the East and South Coast ol Arabia from Koweit to Aden, and they are essential to the security of our position in the Persian Uulf and to our communications with India. I kit except on the coast there is no reason why we should come into contact with tlie tribes at all. Kor in the interior we have no interests whatever, and the t reaty which is now being negotiated with Bin Sand has been necessitated solelv by the fact o( his recent acquisition of the Katif Coast. We have neither the desire nor the power to interfere with the Chiefs of the interior, and what .s more important, the Chiefs of the interior have not the slightest intention ,of allowing themselves to be interfered with. What thev want -ami it is probably true to say of them, as Captain Shakespear has said of Bin Sand though doubtless in varying degrees, that they are 44 animated bv intense P a ^ r]0 tJ 5 &gt;m for [their] country, a profound veneration for [their]'religion and a single-minded desire to do [their] best for [their] people '-what they want is ' Arabia lor the Arabs ' ; and all they want of us is a guarantee against attack by sea and our good offices in securing their independence in the settlement at the end of the war. This, it is submitted, we are in a position to give them — we have indeed already promised it to Bin Sand Mavia, the Idnsi, and the Sharif of Mecca, and it is less, rather than more' dangeious to complete the network of agreements. The u protectorate ' over Arabia there ore amounts to nothing inore than Arabia for the Arabs under the a?gis of Great Britain. unuei X. Persia. 'J 'he Mesopotamiau question necessarily raises that of Persia il onh because as we are at this moment learning to our cost, the neutralitv occujutloii of Arabistan anil I.unstan are essential to the security of Basra Moreover, it is obvious that if Russia, who already dominates Azerbaijan is .lace. possession oi the whole of the Turkish side of the frontier down' to a ukm, hei hold on not them I ersia will be immenselv strengthened \o\\ therefore, is the time to come to terms with her. It is submitted that the x P ell( : nce ot the last seven years proves conclusively that no settlement can be satisfaetoiT which does not eliminate the neutral zone. There wis , two-fold reason for creating that zone : (1) to avoid an undue eMonsion of our responsibilities, (2) to avoid a conterminous frontier witli liussia Tl acquisition of the Anglo-Persian oil-fields at ,he other end of Persia s stultified the first. The second is one of those sup...,itt.'s which Ih.C on in offices ong after they have lost all reality in practice. If Tlie f xpeiience ol the last hall century in the East teaches anything it is surelv .he futility the buffer-State, and, a /ort/or/, of the^uffe*-zone Thi stheiue that has been outlined above lor the re-arraiigement of Eastern luikej in Asia aims at the elimination of the buffer-State, and is intended lo leave no neutral zones or no-mans-lands ; and it is believed that we slnll ou &gt; get rid ot friction in Persia by doing the same there. But the abolition o the neutral zone can only be effective for this purpose if there Is he clearest possible understanding that each Power is free to do what it likes But the difficulty as has been more than once urged—is to arrive u an equitable division of the neutral sphere. For our niterests are so dis^ nbnted o\ei it geographically that there would seem to be almost nothino- with which we can afford to part. In the extreme west Luristan cf Arabistan are essential to the security of lower Mesopotamia as well as being the region in which 2,000,000?. have recently been sunk, h, t h ( (entu it is ditucult to see how we can give Russia anything south of Ispahan ithout bringing her down m dangerous proximity to the Gulf and it tin- same time cutting off our own access to the north, whether r/d Ahwa/-f S p a h '! oi I nslnre-bhiiaz-Ispahan. In the extreme east there is nothing that we cangive without bringing Russia a stage nearer Seistan, and placing a long strip of Afghan frontier in the rear ol Herat in her possession. It is perhaps possible to over-estimate the substantial disadvantages that this would entail to ourselves, but it i&gt; quite certain that it would have the worst possible effect on the Amir, Indeed, so far from being able to give anything to Russia, it is a question whether an attempt should not be made to get Ispahan away from her. The security of the oil-lields, peace in Arabistan, the protection of the Lynch road and of our trade along it, are some of the advantages which we derive from the loyalty of the Bakhtiaris, and it would seem inevitable, if Ispahan remains in the Russian sphere, that the Haklitiaris should sooner or later succumb to Russian influence. M. Sazonof said to Sir G. Buchanan in January that Russia already has all she wants in Persia, except, of course, the free hand to dispose of it as she pleases. If the free hand is now accorded to her, and if account is taken of the extraordinarily rich tract which it is proposed to relinquish to her on the Turco-Persian frontier, it is conceivable that she may be content to leave Ispahan and the neutral sphere to us. In any case it would seem best, seeing that it is she who is pressing for its abolition, to let her make her proposals first. A. H. Hth March 1915. Xotr .—The bibliojficipliv of tlu* subject i&gt; very largv, ami most of the standard works have been consulted. The greatest assistance lias been obtained from conversations with those who -like Miss Gertrude Bell, Lieutenant-Colonel F. R. Maunsell. ( and Mr. Arthui Tod (Messrs. Lyneh's Manager at Bagdad)—have intimate personal knowledge of all the couditions. The map lias been prepared by Mr. Anderson, ot the Political Department. Notk bv Gfaervl Sir Edmund Baruow on the Defence of Mesopotamia. Sir A. Hirtzels minute on the political future of Mesopotamia and the adjoining provinces of the 1 urkish Empire demands an appreciation ot the military conditions affecting the problem, and he has therefore asked me to state my views. 1 will endeavour to do so as briefly as possible, but 1 can hardly confine myself to the geographical limits ol his minute, as 1 am aware that the question of Alexandretta, and its connection with the problem of the Trans-Continental Railway to the Persian Gull, is being raised. Iheie are those who think that the control of the railway from the Mediterranean to the Gulf should be in our hands, and that, with this object, it is iic(es&gt;ai\ to acquire the admirable naval and strategic position of Alexandretta, which not only enfilades the coasts of Asia Minor and Syria, but menaces on tie other hand the historic Oilician Gates, between Asia Magna and Asia Minor and on the other the routes to Antioch, Aleppo, Mosul, Diarbekir, am Erzeroum. The idea of holding this dominating position is a fascinating one but our possession of so commanding a situation, threatening )ot i t ic contemplated French sphere in Syria and the prospective luissian sp hmc in Armenia, would sooner or later, but inevitably, bring our inteics s into conflict with those of our great allies of to-day. 1 Ins pnwer u consideration compels me to reject as an untenable military and political proposition, the alluring but dangerous idea of establishing ourselves at Alexandretta; a position which would commit us to military and admmis- trrative obligations far beyond the limitations imposed on us by both our resources and our world-wide responsibilities. f we annex Alexandretta we shall not only involve ourselves in enormous and unprohtab e expenditure in docks and fortifications, but we shall also be committed to the control and defence of the long exposed line of the Baghdad Railway between that port and Mosul, while at the same time we shall be perpetually tloundenng s. 262.14 in a maze of intricate political intrigues and racial problems Kurd ami Armenian, Anatolian and Syrian with which we ought to have no concern. Mesopotamia and Egypt, with Paletstine as the connecting link between the two, are British interests, the rest are not. Let us, therefore, restrict our aspirations and our energies to obtaining a controlling intluence over the Aral) world, and thus becoming in fact as well as in theory the leading Islamic Power, the one on which all Islamic races will lean, if the above view is accepted where short of the Alcxandretta-Mosul line should we seek the ideal northern boundary of our sphere in 10a stern Asia? From a purely British point of view that line might be one stretching from the Medi terranean at Cape Xakurah, between Tyre and Acre, to the Euphrates at or near Deir, thence down the right bank to Anah and across El Jazirah to where the Tigris cuts through the Jabal Hamrin and along that low but well defined range to the Persian frontier. Such a line would include all Palestine from Dan to Ueersheba, the Upper Jordan and Mount Ifermon, as well as the oases of Damascus and Palmyra, and thus enable us to construct an all-British railway from Acre or Haifa through Damascus to Baghdad and thcOulf, thus enabling us to connect with the Egyptian system, embracing all the Arab region and linking up and consolidating our oriental empire. If. however, this ambitious programme is beyond our military capacity and likely to involve us in a conflict with France, the only sound alternative is to reconcile ourselves to acquiring a supreme influence in Mesopotamia, abandoning all idea of linking up with the railway systems of Turkey and Egypt, and confining ourselves to the development of ancient Chaldea. With our maritime base at. Basra, or Koweit, a railway link with Europe is not absolutely essential, and there are certain advantages in holding Mesopotamia as a self -contained province more or less isolated from the Western world, and consequently defended with comparative ease from external enemies. Personally 1 incline to the view that this is the course we should adopt, and this also is, 1 think, the view advocated by Sir A. Ilirtzel at page 0 of his minute, but, though 1 agree generally with him as to the Northern limit of our sphere of action, 1 do not altogether accept his conclusions, because 1 am doubtful of the wisdom of incorporating the whole of this region in the British Empire. 1 am doubtful for three reason, (1) because we should dienate the Arabs, and make perpetual foes ol the lurks; (2) because we -hould render all Mahomedans suspicious of our policy ; (o) because the military defence of upper as well as lower Mesopotamia would be thrown entirely on us, and I doubt if we can bear the burden without au excessne strain on our military resources. The lesson of the decline and lall of Koine teaches the necessity of avoiding over extension. i i i r t Influenced by these grave doubts my conclusion is that we shouu mu annexation to so much of the Basra ' wilayat as is esseinial ioi mi i ai\ reasons, and, that as regards the rest we should leave the nomma Hr/eram \ to the Sultan of Turkey, coupled with the condition ot a l 5ritlsl1 Commissioner or (Jovernor-General oi Baghdad and a supci \ i&gt;iiig &gt;11 ^ . administration. In fact the Sultan of Turkey as regards ^lesopotami.i ^ be in much the same position as he was in relation to Eg^pt, am t ie &lt; • ' wilayat' would be in a somewhat corresponding position to t He souu.i , except that it would be entirely British territory. The advantages of this course are :— vnpnlmr (1) That we should conciliate Mahomedan opinion, and giu a11 ^ to educated Arabs and other Mahomedans. , (2) That we should to a certain extent save Turkish amour pi t help to rehabilitate Turkey as an Asiatic State. ^ Russia (3) That we should not arouse the jealousies and s . ,l&gt; l )l( ! &lt;)11 ^ i .i,, and France, as we probably should il we occupu ( - ( ^ ' i j )0 |] l ('4) That we should create a territorial butler between ouim , j. ^ j ^ Russia and France, as the one will presumably be ^tablisne^^ Armenia and possibly ])art ol Kurdistan, the ot u i m coll tiniied (5) That this buffer province will be dependent on us &lt;»i ^ , | )e( j existence as without our support it would ceit .im \ &gt;' &lt; ^ W ell (0) That the military defence of lower Mesopotamia «ni within the scope of our military potentialities.T am well aware that butter States are not eternal, but still, while they last, they serve a useful purpose. Siam and Afghanistan have been buffer States for more than a quarter ol' a century, ami there is no visible sign of their early dissolution. Similarly, I pper Mesopotamia may form such a barrier i'or a generation, and we cannot legislate for all futurity. It is tlie military aspect of the case with which 1 am more particularly concerned, and therefore I now turn to its consideration, taking as a basis the policy outlines] above. 1 have said that we should annex outright the Basra ' wilayat.' The corollary to this is that we should have to provide entirely for its defence; This, I think, would be well within our capacity il' we were separated, as we should be, by at least 500 miles from the nearest military power—Russia much of the intervening space being a desert without population or resources. The separation would be all the more advantageous to us il unbridged by any trunk line of railway. Our principal cantonments would presumably be at Kut-el-Amara and Basra, with minor garrisons at Kurna, Amara, and Xasireh. An Anglo-Indian division would be ample for this purpose, even if it had to assume responsibilities for the defence of the Karun Valley and the Anglo-Persian oil field. Then as regards the Baghdad wilayat we should probably want a central cantonment at or near Baghdad, with outlying posts to protect the headworks of the great irrigation system which would doubtless be initiated in the province, as well perhaps as a post to protect the highway to Persia through Khanakin. The forces required for these purposes might be furnished from indigenous sources, just as in Egypt, with a nucleus of Anglo-Indian troops to ensure the maintenance of our military supremacy. A mixed brigade of British mid Indian troops would probably sulhce for this special object. 1 will not lengthen this Minute by further discussion of the details of a subject which is at present more or less academic, and perhaps unhappily somewhat premature, but will content myself with.merely recapitulating what I conceive should be the main points of our policy towards Turkey in the eventuality of an early peace :— (I.) Turkey in Asia to be maintained as a buffer State, but shorn of the following provinces:—Armenia, which would necessarily go to Russia, the Lebanon which would be claimed by France, and the Basra wilayat which would be annexed by England, while the llejaz and Yemen would be divided between Egypt and certain friendly Arab Emirs such as the Idrisi and Lahej. [2.) The Baghdad wilayat to be transformed into an autonomous province administered in the name of the Sultan by a British Administrator and under British protection and on the same lines as Egypt. (3.) Palestine to be neutralised, and administered as an autonomous province of the Turkish Empire by an International Com mission or Corporation under the protection ol the allied Powers. W e have a somewhat similar example in the caseol Shanghai, thougli ot course on a much smaller scale. (4.) Both Baghdad and Palestine, as also Armenia and the Lebanon, to take over proportionate shores in the lurkish debt. i5.) The Sultan's private estates and interests in the Baghdad wilayat to be respected. • * • • t i i (&gt;) Ml the German concessions and interests m Asiatic I urkey to ho cancelled, those in Baghdad and Basra being transferred to ( heat Britain, and those in Palestine to the neutralised autonomous (7) G^reat 11 Britain to be entirely responsible for the defence of the Baghdad province, and for its political relations with 1 ersia and (8) Gerinan interests in Anatolia ami Northern Syria to be trans^rre,! to Turkey which would thus become possessed of the so-called Baghdad'Railway in those provinces. The solution here suggested may be far short of British aspirations, but it seems to me that we must try to adjust our demands to our means and necessities, and in my judgment demands wh.ch exceed our tmaneml and10 luilitai-y capacities slionM l)e avoiiied, while we shouKI endeavour as far as possible, to pose as the champion of Islam, hy maintaining Tnrkev as an ;J' . l ' v ,'' I I ,' rl ' g ,he l &gt;ower :lll(1 pi-estige of the Snltan of ' i r.3Pt» and or the Arabian Knurs.

It was precisely at the period when onr friendship with Turkey was greatest, that Turkish expansion in eastern Arabia began, and intrigues were initiated which have continued unceasingly ever since. Is there any reason to suppose that when we have helped to turn the Turk out of Constantinople and strip him of his richest provinces, his feelings towards us will be so revolutionised that his very nature will be changed V 1 do not think that anyone who has had direct experience of the attempt to work harmoniously with Turkey at the head of the Persian Gulf during the last quarter of a century, would choose her for a neighbour. In this connection, the case of Egypt seems to be a warning rather than an example. Apart from the fact that the anomalies of the stains of Egypt were so inconvenient as not to encourage a reproduction of them in Mesopotamia, the fact that Turkey has never acquiesced in our occupation and has persistently and not unsuccessfully intrigued against it, seems to be a clear indication of what may be expected to happen in Bagdad if any locus standi is given to the Turkish (lovernment. The politico-religious advantages claimed for Sir E. Barrow s scheme seem to be based on the identification of Turkey with Islam. It is probable that in India at the present moment the two are convertible terms. But are they so outside India V In Arabia and Africa will not the overwhelming majority almost certainly be for an Arab Caliphate, if on the fall of Constantinople the Grand Sharif throws off the Turkish yoke and proclaims himself posses&gt;or of the Holy Places? As has already been pointed out, it will be beyond the power of .Turkey to eject him, and Indian Mussulmans will have to choose which Caliph they will serve. As access to the Holy Places will depend on the goodwill of the Grand Sharif, there can be little doubt which way their choice will eventually go. There will, no doubt, be an uncomfortable period of suspense and hesitation; but when it is once realised that we do not intend to interfere in Arabia, and that the Holy Places there and in Mesopotamia are secure against Christian intrusion, it seems highly probable that Indian Mussulmans will understand that there is nothing anti-Islamic in our policy, and will acquiesce. For the above reasons, therefore, it is submitted that the rehabilitation of Turkey has nothing to commend it, and that the scheme outlined in the preceding notes, though assuredly not without it weak points, is the most satisfactory that can be found. Of course, if His Majesty's Government are prepared to annex Alexandretta and the whole country from the Persian Gulf to the foothills of the Anti-Taurus, and to defend it when annexed, that would be very much better. But it has been assumed that this is too large a responsibility, and though J do not share Sir E. Barrow's political objections to the scheme, I think that it is more than we ought to undertake. 17th March 1915. Telegram from Viceroy to Secretauy of State for India, dated Iotii March 1915. Private. Most secret. Your private telegram of 10th March. In my private letter of 3rd March, which you should receive about 27ili March, \ enclosed a note containing fully my views on the future status and administration of Basra. I confined my remarks to the future of Mesopotamia since any. discussion of policy outside these limits might have been regarded as outside mv legitimate sphere. . , ^ My opinion in a few words is that, varied (?) as our interests are at Abadan and in Karun valley bv the oil works and oil fields, it is essential that for this and other reasons'we should remain in permanent occupation of Basra vilayet, and that on political, economic and religious grounds the Bagdad vilavet should also be ceded by Turkey and a native 1 administrat ion under our protection and control established there. W hat lorm that administration should take could hardly he decided at present owing to there being no really predominant ruling factor m the whole ol eastern18 Mesopotamia. If and when we get to Bagdad the solution of this question is likely to prove easier than it looks at present. A temporary solution might be the creation of a ( ouncil of Sunni and Shiah riemas under the direction of a Resident. Our Bagdad protectorate should extend north of Samara ( ? which is a ? ) religious centre and should comprise Khanikin on the trade route to Persia. 1 am averse from increasing our military responsibilities more than is absolutely necessary, but the situation has to be faced, and it must be realised that with an unfriendly C Jovernment at Bagdad our political, military and commercial position at Basra might become very difficult. In my note I advocated as a condition of peace the transfer to British hands of the whole property of Bagdad Railway Company, its rights and privileges, leaving Turkey to arrange for indemnification' of German and other shareholders. This should in any case apply to such extension of the railway as will pass through territory annexed or controlled by us after the war. ^ ou mention that \\ n i Ollice and Adimra 1 ty insist on importance of acquiring Alexandretta as safeguarding possession of Mespotamia by control of railway terminus. 1 would only remark that the possession of Alexandretta without the hinterland as far as Aleppo would not help us to control the Bagdad Railway, which throws out branches at various points to the sea, hut runs well inland the whole way from Ismidt to Bagdad. From a military point of view it would probably be to our advantage in Mesopotamia that the section of the railway from Jerablus to Bagdad should never he built, or certainly not for several years. As regards your enquiry of my opinion as to the general area which should be leit to Turkey after claims of belligerents have been satisfied, I presume that Russia will take Erzeroum and Van, Constantinople, and any further strip of territory on the Asiatic shore of the Bosporus. France a\i I 1 at least claim Syria and Palestine as her sphere of influence direct or indirect. The vilayets of Khan Bitlis and Diarbekir will probably become an autonomous Armenia. Thus Turkey would practically be shut oil' from Mesopotamia and Syria. Konia would probably become the seat of Turkish Government, and round Konia there are several provinces predominatingly Turkish, and these might form a respectable Turkish State. I he fiitme Oi Khali late and ol Arabia is a question which should settle itself with a benevolent attitude on our part but with as little outside interference as possible. In return for important concessions made to Russia in Turkey, would it not be possible to induce her to relax her hold on northern Persia and to 'ive Persia a chance? This would suit us far better than any partition. Anyhow the future of Persia must be, I think, taken into serious consideration in conjunction with the future of what is now Asiatic Turkey. Lastly, I trust in any scheme of mutual agreement between the allies a settlement of the question of the French possessions in India will not be forgotten.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000226_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/B213</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000226</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/B213</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>‘Notes and private telegram from the Viceroy regarding the future settlement of Eastern Turkey in Asia and Arabia.’</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1915/1915</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-09-19T10:41:11</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (10 folios)</extent><extent>Foliation: The foliation for this description commences at f 77, and terminates at f 86, as it is part of a larger physical volume; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
