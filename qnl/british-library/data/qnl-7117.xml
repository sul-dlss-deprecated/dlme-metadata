He has also forwarded me a copy of a petition he alleges to have submitted to Your Honours on the some subject. This I also send to you.

I wtuld draw Your Honours* attention to the handwriting of a man colling himself a 'Doctor 15 .

MEMORANDUM Reference my telegram No.174 dated 26th July 1933. Abdul Wahab son of Abdul Hadl al Askari is an ’Iraqi subject posing as a Doctor, in support of which latter fact he holds degrees issued from Chicago and Constantinople. 2. Although it is not entered in his passport, he states that he is a Sayyid, which circumstance he has apparently used to good effect in gulling simple villagers in the course of his peregrinations in Muscat territories. 3. He arrived in Muscat from Basrah some two and a half months ago on the pretext of accompanying a local well-to-do inhabitant in the capacity of medical attendant. 4. He first attracted notice when he posted a petitior to the Political Agent stating that 'having travelled to Sur in the course of my general practice I was robbed at Tiwi on the return journey'. He sought redress, but in the meanwhile he disappeared to the Batinch coast having borrowed several small sums of money from the credulous. 5. In the meanwhile the Council of Regency, having heard of the individual and of his wanderings in Muscat State territories without either His Highness’s or their own permission, (which is in strict contravention of State orders) issued instructions for him to be sought out and produced before them.2 © n 6* He appeared before the Council on 25th inst* ond was ordered to quit Muscat territory forthwith* 7* It transpires that the individual is prac tically penniless and has been subsisting on charitable hospitality (which he has much abused) and on small sums he has raised, in his guise as a Sayyid, from the simple minded* 8* On the 25th inst*, after his interview with the Council, Abdul Wahab visited the Consulate on the pretext of inquiring about his robbery”• 9* In the course of his interview with me he stated that 'getting sick on arrival at Muscat he had gone to Tiwi for change of oir'' - a most difficult and arduous journey for a sick man* 10* This and several other statements very much conflicted with the facts set out in his petition (vide paragraph 4) and his entire manner was shifty and un- convincing* 11* The said petition incidentally, written in both English and Arabic, was in the most illiterate handwriting and style, and not such as one would expect from a person posing as a qualified doctor* 12* Abdul Wahab next stated that he now wishes n to proceed as a tourist to Bahrain”, where he alleges that he owns one fourth share in a date garden with Shaikh Mohammad son of Shaikh All al Osfur of village Khirzakan, Manamah* His eventual destination was to be 'Iraq 13* As he was unable to produce Rs 500/-, the deposit prescribed by the Bahrain Government for tourists, I warned him that he would be unable to land* My offer to telegraph to his partner for assistance he declined and evaded on several quibbles* 14* The Doctor^ total assets, according to his own statement, amount to Rs 90/-, from which he has yet to purchase his passage* 15* I understand that Abdul Wahab was 'moved on”from Kuwait some two years ago but this lacks confirmation and he himself denies it* 16* His passport (Ho*1558 ’Iraqi dated 31st July 1930) expires on 31st inst*, but he has made no request for its renewal# visa for Bahrain issued to this individual by H.B.M’s Consul at Basrah and I trust you will concur with my action# whilst in Muscat State I strongly suspect that Abdul Wahab is a charlatan unable to moke a living in his own country# He is certainly an undesirable and there are reasons for thinking f though proof is lacking* that he has interests other than those attaching to his medical profession in travelling so continually in various Arab States# Copy,to The Hon’ble the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Bushire, Political Agent, Kuwait, 17.

He took his departure after making one or two diatribes against the British Government. 3. Abdul Wahab then visited the Quarantine Medical Officer and requested the latter to endorse a certificate made out by himself that he had been vaccinated. Dr. Yam- keranardi declined to do this as Abdul Wahab had no apparent marks of S. G.

Subject:- Dr. Abdul frahab. Dear Colonel Loch Reference your D.O.Ho.946-S dated 3rd August 19^3. 1. Fron scraps ef inforraation gleaned from various sources I heard that Abdul Wahab, in the course of his wanderings, invariably tried t® sound the local inhabitants ©n their vie^s ©f both the Muscat and British G©vermaents, and here and there w ®uld let fall a taunting remark against ooth. R© matter on what topic it was his practice t® raise a controversy and t® hint, if not speak, against existing custams, habits, practices etc. whenever opportunity afforded. Last year when he came t® Muscat and was living with Sheikh Zubeir|i the Chief Justice, he took a keen interest in political matters. From open expressions ©f opinion he clearly proved himself to be very anti- British and at the same time very inimical to the Iraq Government. He is a strong pr®-Turk and lauded the former Turkish rule ©f Mesopotamia to the skies. This year, when arraigned before the Council, his feelings apparently g®t the better ®f his discretion when he openly abused the British and Muscat Governments. I s ,ould think it is doubtful if he has anything t© d® with the Soviet, but his whole attitude w as 'bolshie' - anti everything - and I think he might be i The Hon’ble Lt-Colonel ^.I^cn, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.worth watching 6. In my ©pinion he w as scouting #ut the land f#r some object other than his quack doctoring. Certainly a man ©f the education and position he claimed w^uld not be wandering about in the wilds ©f Muscat ( and 7 ith the intent of carrying on up the Trucial Coast) solely for 'medical purposes'. If his intentions had been honest his 'Kathods w$uld hare been likewise, and he would certainly haye sought the assistance ©f the local GoYernment in his enterxsrise. As he did not do so and '-as truculent when called t© book by the Muscat authorities, I gravely suspect the honesty of his purpose. I have heard incidentally from Saiyid Abdul Munis here that he (i.e.Abdul Munis) w a s not ill en route from Basra to Muscat but that Abdul ^ahab, who pleaded penury, jun { coru *) so implied him that the Saiyid paid the doctor*s fare from Basrah to Muscat. This directly contradicts Abdul Wahab f s statement. Yours Sincerely.■ Confidential. d.o.no.k/ 3| Political Agency # Muecat. Recess Officer, Killarney Hotel, Camp, Karachi, ^th August 1933. Subject:- Dr. Abdul *&gt;ahab. V) ;ar Colon e 1 Lo ch In continuation of correspondence ending w ith my confidential ^).0.2To.K/ll dated 15th August concerning Dr. Abdul Wahab. 2. I happened to call today on Hicknell, the Master of S.S.'Bamora' lying at Kiamari. It w as in his ship that Abdul Wahab left Muscat. 3. He informed me verbally that this individual took a ticket as far as Bandar Abbas ^here ho w ever he w as not permitted to land by the Persian passport officials. 4* After leaving Bandar Abbas the Doctor produced a written demand (with copy to M Foreign Minister”), scribbled on a dirty piece of paper, to the Captain claiming a refund of his fare Rs.9/8. He lodged the claim asserting that the ship's authorities had connived with the Persian Officials to prevent his landingJ 5. Captain Hicknell's demand for the balance of his fare to Basra, or in the alternative to be handed over to the Iraq Police at Basra, completely altered Abdul ^ahab's tenour. 6. The Master further informed me that during his stay on board Abdul “ahab never appeared twice in the same dress. At Bandar Abbas he w as dressed as a Persian, and wore a Pahlavi hat; at Henjam he appeared as a bannia, complete with dhoti; while at Bahrein he disguised himself as a Bengali babul The Hon'ble Lt-Colonel G. Loch, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.® 1 1 5 7. To further hide hie identity he also removed a very conspicuous (and somewhat jagged) gold front tooth that he sported in Muscat. 8. Finally Captain Hicknell informed ]?e that after leaving Bushire Ahdul wahah completely disappeared and he presumes that the individual smuggled himself ashore at that port disguised as a shore cooly. No trace of his kit ^slg found on hoard. 9. My Mirza now sa ys that he suspects that Ahdul ^ahah may he a Persian subject, travelling on an Iraqi passport obtained under false pretences. There apparently exists little or no difficulty in thus obtaining a passport in Iraq. 10. The individual certainly struck me more as a had type of IraqlT^ffendi than anything else. Whatever else he is his conduct certainly indicates him as a decidedly dubious character and I thought it desirable to inform you of these latest developments, although they occured out of my sphere.
