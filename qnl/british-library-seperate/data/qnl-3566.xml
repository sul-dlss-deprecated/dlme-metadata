The office notes comprise a numbered list of items contained in the volume. Each item is written in red or blue/black ink, dependent on whether it refers to an incoming (red) or outgoing (blue/black) piece of correspondence. The list references items in the file, marked either with corresponding red or blue numbers.</extent><extent>Foliation: The main foliation system starts on the front cover of the file, and runs to the inside back cover. It uses circled pencil numbers in the top-right corner of each recto. There is a second foliation system which uses uncircled numbers, also in the top-right corner of each folio. This foliation system runs through most of the volume, merging occasionally with the main foliation system. Some items in the file are marked with circled red or blue crayon numbers, which constitute part of the original filing arrangement. Blue numbers are used for outgoing correspondence, red numbers for incoming correspondence.Folio 66 is a fold-out.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file contains correspondence related to the negotiation of new or continuing civil air agreements between British Government representatives and the Sheikhs of Bahrain, Qatar and the Trucial States. The main correspondents in the file are the Political Agent in Bahrain (Major Arnold Crawshaw Galloway until July 1946, thereafter Hugh Rance), and the Political Resident of the Persian Gulf (Sir Geoffrey Prior until November 1945, Sir Rupert Hay thereafter).The file begins with correspondence related to negotiations for the continuance of the Civil Air Agreement already in place between the British Government/British Overseas Air Corporation (BOAC) and the Government of Bahrain (see 'File 13/1 I Aerodrome at Bahrain' IOR/R/15/2/505 for the original agreement). Notes from a meeting that took place at the India Office in London on 9 October 1945, outline the British Government's reasons for wishing to extend the Agreement by seven years (folio 9).Subsequent correspondence in the file relates to a number of new air routes proposed between Europe and India/Asia, which would entail increasing numbers of international aircraft passing over or refuelling on the Arab Gulf coast. These airlines included Transcontinental and Western Airlines (TWA), Air France, Morton Air Services Limited, and Dalmia Jain Airways. The Chicago Convention, an international code intended to coordinate and regulate international air travel, had been signed on 7 December 1944. Amongst its provisions was the need to accord equal rights to all aircraft flying over foreign territories. In response to the convention, the British Government had to seek the Arab coast sheikhs' agreement to conform to the Chicago code, in order to permit airlines such as TWA and Air France the right to fly over or land in the dominions. Copies of the letters sent by Galloway to the various sheikhs are included in the file (folios 41-48), along with the sheikhs' replies (folios 61-66, 70-71, 73-80). The file also includes a printed copy of an agreement between the British and French Governments relating to air transport between British and French territories, issued on 28 February 1946 (folios 129-140), and reports of TWA's plans to fly to Bombay via Saudi Arabia (folio 184).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Overseas Airways Corporation</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Bahrain, Āl Khalīfa dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Trans World Airlines</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Qatar</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Trucial Coast</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Civil aviation</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0002ea#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0002ea#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0002ea#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0002ea#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
