UPOriTANT. 9, 11th ber. / ,/ / / Sir, With reference to the letter from this Office No.8327/9, of the 9th September, I am directed by Mr .Secretary Thomas to transmit to you, to be laid before Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare, the acccmpanying copy of a despatch from the Minister of External Affairs of the Union of South Africa, from which it will be observed that the Union (roverment do not desire to participate in any renewal of the Commercial Treaty with Muscat on its expiration in February next. 2. It will be recalled that, in order to overcome the difficulty caused by the lack of any provision in the Treaty for the separate withdrawal of the Dominions to which it had been applied, it has been the practice, at the request of His Majesty's Governments in Canada and the Irish Free State, to insert a special clause in the annual renewals of the Treaty giving those Dominions the right to withdraw from the Treaty at any time upon notice to that effect being given by His Majesty's Representative at Muscat. This clause in its original form extended also to the Commonwealth of Australia, and His Majesty's Governmait in the Commonwealth took advantage of the clause to withdraw from the Treaty in 1923. 3. It is understood to be the intention of His Majesty's (xovernment in the United Kingdom that, pending the completion of negotiations for the revision of the ENCLOSURE IN W^KiY LETTER jfeiaty-/ j No - *2 H. JAN. 1952 ' Under-Secretary of State | F ) ! ^ it l India Office. ' 8 . ECRE T DEPT. 'wdia OFFICETreaty, arrangements should be made as usual for the renewal of the Treaty in its existing form on its expiration in February next. On this basis the correct procedure for securing the withdrawal of the Union of South Africa from the Treaty would seem to be: (1) that arrangements should be made for the addition of the Union of South Africa to the Dominions mentioned in the soecial clause referred to above (viz: Canada and tne Irish Free State) when the renewal of the Treaty is effected in February next; (2) that, following on this extension of the special clause, notice should be given to the Muscat authorities, as soon as may be convenient after the renev/al of the Treaty has been effected, of the withdrawal of the Union of South Africa from the Treaty. 4. It may be added that the Treaty does not apply to the whole of the Union but only to the provinces of Natal, the Transvaal and the Orange Free State. It would seem desirable, therefore, that to any provision for ihe withdrawal of the Union should be added the qualification 'in respect of Natal, the Transvaal and the Orage Free State'. The special clause would then run as follows 'It is also understood that it shall be open to the Dominion of Canada, the Union of South Africa (in respect of Natal, the Transvaal and the Orange iree State) and the Irish Free State to withdraw from the aforesaid Treaty at any time on notice being given to that effect by His Majesty's Representative at Muscat'# A similar qualification should also be made in the subsequent communication to the Muscat authoricies giving notice of the withdrawal of the. Union of South Africa from the Treaty. 5. Mr .Thomas would be glad if Sir Samuel Hoare could arrange for action to be taken in accordance with the procedure/procedure suggested above and if a copy of any communication despatched from the India Office for this purpose could be forwarded to this Office in order that His Majesty's Government in the Union of South Africa may be informed of the action contemplated. 6. A copy of this letter is being sent to the Foreign Office. I am, &amp;c., (Sgd.) G.W. DIXON.UNION OP SOUTH AFRICA, DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS, PRETORIA. 11th November, 1931. Sir, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Confidential Despatch N 0.269, of the 5th of Seotember last, in regard to the proposed revision of the Oommercial Treaty between Great Britain and Muskat, His Majesty's Government in the Union of South Africa is of opinion that the Treaty in question is of little or no interest to the Union and has, therefore, decided that the Union shall no longer remain a party to it. There is, therefore, no intention on the part of the Union to renew the Treaty after its expiration in February 1932. It may also be stated that the provisions c£ Article 4 are contrary to the Asiatic policy of the Union. I have, &amp;c., (Sgd.) J .3 .M. HERTZOG. Minister of External Affairs. gPIDENTIAL.

The method proposed by the Dominions Office for securing the withdrawal of the Union of South Africa from the treaty appears to he suitable, in view of the procedure adopted in connection with the withdrawal of the Commonwealth of Australia in 1923 (please see this Office letter dated 18th October, 1923, P. 3684/23, -and connected correspondence). I am to request that, if the Government of India see no objection, the appropriate steps may he taken to amend the special clause in this year's annual renewal on the lines proposed in paragraph 4 of the .Dominions Office letter, and. subsequently to give notice of the Union's withdrawal. i .1 am.

The Union of South Africa had been omit tea from this clause in the light of the Governor -General's despatch W. 174 of the 29th April, 1922. It appeared therefore that the appropriate method of effecting the withdrawal of the Union of South Africa from this Treaty was (a) to include a provision for their withdrawal at the next annual renewal of the Treaty, and (b) subsequently to give notice of their withdrawal to the Muscat Government. \ ^ MINISTER 0?

It did not, however, apply to Gape Province. / 4.

Before my arrival at Muscat on my recent tour the Sultan addressed a letter to the Political Agent, Muscat, copy and trans lation of which I enclose, informing him that he wished the above Treaty to be revised. This revision is provided for in Article 23 of the Treaty. In conversation with me His Highness reiterated his request. I replied thut I would inform His Majesty's Govern ment, and a copy of a letter sent by Major ifatts to the Sultan undea my instructions is enclosed. 2. This means that the revised Treaty will have to be put into force by the 11th February 1938. I suggest that I be authorised to reply to the Suit® taut His / s.&amp;.

It is true that if the Treaty should lapse this Article would of course be equally nullified with the rest of the Treaty but in view of our special position in Muscat it can scarcely be contempat- ed that any fresh Treaty will not confer similar rights. If therefore the sultan 1 s proposals for the new Treaty involve terms less favourable than those enjoyed by the citizens of the United States of America under the Treaty of 18S3 (Ibid* App.XXVII), or subjects of France under the Treaty of 1344 (Ibid,App.XXIX), or subjects of the Netherlands under the Treaty of 1877 (Ibid.

His Majesty's Government had expressed a desire to learn from the Sultan what his proposals £©£ for the Revision of the Treaty were and that I therefore requested His Highness to comply with their wish. After some further talk on the subject the Sultan clearly led me to understand that while he was in Kashmere he would work out the details of the altej? - ations he desired to have made in the Treaty and inform me for communication to His Majesty's Government. 1 *' t 4. I regret to see that in his last letter on the subject now received, dated July l€th,the Sultan has returned to his former attitude and asks for a delegate to be appointed to commence negotiations without stating what his proposals are, 5 &lt; Unless some comprehensive idea is obtained ' s beforehand of what the Sultan/ideas regarding the revision are, I see no hope of completing a new Treaty until/„ 5 - until long axter the expiry of the present one and certainly not before. His Highness's immediate plans aiter nis return to Muscat from his visit to 'Iraq and tne Gulx about the end of September, are to leave for ecii ly in wovemuer to see His Excellency the Vice— roy, onence he will proceed to Japan and not return to nio Capital until aoout 'the middle of February j 958 ('vide my D.0.No.P-40 dated 28th July 1937). (6A V) * If we can extract from the Sultan his proposals for revision before his departure for Delhi in November, they could be considered by His Majesty's Government and their replies thereto decided upon by the time the Sultan returned so that the new Treaty would be ready for signature as soon as possible after the 11th February next when the existing one expires. 6. Under the circumstances I suggest I be author ized to address the Sultan again on the subject mention ing that in view of his proposed visits to India and in order Japan this year it is essential/to avoid undue delay in the matter that His Majesty's Government be informed as early as possible of his proposals for revision so that negotiations may commence directly he returns to Muscat next year.

It will also be seen (paragraph 5 of the Political Agent's letter) that owing to the Sultan's plans for extensive travel this winter the time available for negotiating the new Treaty is limited.

Your Highness* predecessor. His Highness Saiyid Taimur bin Faisal, K.C.I.E., C»S.I., on the 9th March 19S0 intimated to His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom that the necessity had arisen for increas ing the customs duties of the Muscat State for revenue Majesty the King of the French dated 17th November 1844 and ratified on 4th February 1846, under which the customs duties which may be levied on goods imported by vessels of those countries into Muscat are limited to 5 ^ ad valorem. His Highness further requested that the tariff provisions I* of the Treaty of Commerce made between Her late Majesty Queen Victoria and the Sultan of Muscat might be modified in the same sense. -/ 2. Your \ purposes. His Highness requested His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom to approach the Governments of France and of the United States of America respectively on his behalf to obtain a revision of those clauses of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the United States of America and ^is Highness Said Syed dated 21st September 1853 and . the Treaty of Commerce between the Imam of Muscat and His % I/ifb' 2. Your Highness is also aware that the United States Government have found themselves unable to agree to the modification of their Treaty of 1833, save on conditions which Your Highness has not found acceptable. His Majesty 1 s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of the French Republic have therefore considered the other methods by which, in so far as they are concerned, steps could be taken to meet Your Highness* wishes• 3, A separate communication is being addressed to Your Highness on behalf of the Government of the French Republic. I am now instructed to inform Your Highness on behalf of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom that no objection would be raised by them to an increase of customs duties to 10% ^25% on tobacco and on alcoholic liquor of 55 or less degree uruffer proofj despite the provisions of Article 6 of the Treaty of Commerce of,19th Marchjl891, which Treaty shall remain in force. The concurrence of His Majesty's Government in action on these \ lines will, however, be subject to the understanding (a) that a similar increase will apply to ships of all other nations, except those of the United States, which are protected by Treaty, and those of the Netherlands, which enjoy simple Most Favoured Nation treatment; and (b) that if any ships so protected in the opinion of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom exploit their Treaty advantage to the detriment of British trade or shipping the right of withdrawing this acquiescence immediately is reserved by His Majesty's Government. -/ I desireI desire to express the high consideration which I entertain for Your Highness and to subscribe myself Your Highness 5 sincere friend, Sd, T»C« Fowle, Lieut-Colonel, Political resident in the Persian GulfNo.141^/35/116 : / ^ ' Dated the 22nd July, 1937. From The Hon'ble tne Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To The Secretary to txie Govermuent of India, External Affairs Department, SIMLA. Taxation of British subjects at Muscat. Sir, I nave tne honour to inform you that tnere are a number of taxes imposed, by the Muscat Government which British subjects have been paying for many years past without raising any objection. Recently however, perhaps because the taxes are now being enforced more rigorously under His Highness the Sultanas present regime, objections have been raised by tne British subjects affected, 2. The taxes in question are as follows:- (a) Date tax. An octroi tax of b% ad valorem on dates \ and other produce brought into Muscat or Matrah for sale. (b) Harrasi. A tax ranging from t to 2 Maria Teresa dollars (present rate fa 135 to 100 dollars) per mensem from owners of shops in Matrah (but not Muscat) for the payment of night-watchmen in the bazaar. (c) Motor-car tax. A registration fee for taxis B3.50 per annum. Registration fee for private cars &amp;, 25/- per annum. Driving licence - fis. 10/- per annum. (d) Municipal shop tax. 20 Blazes (totalling 2 annas) per mensem per snop in Muscat and Matrah. (e)/--2- .^'-i-aaovv tux.^ A Tew annas on eacii additional ........ opened in a siiop - non-recurring, ( f ) gelt al Mai.. A sum not exceeding 3 dollars per annum according to tde size and value of the property, (bee also paragraph 6 below) (gj Za.aat. 5% of tne estimated annual yield of each garden. ^W J...tax. &lt; au. valorem on all fish landed in Muscat territory. A furtner for brokerage on those eaible varieties which have to be sold by public auction. There is no tax on 'qasha', the fish wnich is exportea in large quantities for manure after naving been dried. (i) Fisning-boat tax, 8 to 30 dollars a year accora- ing to the size of the vessel. \n)) Weighin g cnaraes. One anna per 20 Muscat maunds. (180 lbs) on all imports from foreign countries, 3, Taxation can be divided into two categories:- 0-' tne list in tne previous paragraph taxes lettered (a) to (e), inclusive, should be municipal taxes and (f) to (j) state taxes, 4, The principle of municipal taxes nas been regularised in King's Regulation No. 1 of 1935, (see correspondence . ending with this Residency memorandum No.1488/18/54 of tne 22nd July, 1935,), and when municipalities have been formed by the Muscat Government, and the list of taxes nas been submitted to me, I will consider tnem. With regard to tnese taxes tuere is no doubt tdat until they have been formally approved by me, as provided by tne King's Regula tion mentioned above, they are ultra vires. However, as tney (1) Municipal (2) State. ilci V 6/ —-3- ixave been paxQ for the last 45 years or so and as the Treaty is due tor revision in February next year, I do not propose to raise any objection to their continued imposi tion at present. d» i.i egaid wo buate taxesj on the broad issue* wnetnei Sritxsii subjects shouxd. pay taxes or not depends on whether the right of exterritoriality, wnich they enjoy under Article 13 of the Treaty of Friendship, Commer ce and Navigation between Great Britain and Muscat, 1891, (Aitchison VolXI, page 314), gives in itself total exemp tion from all taxes. Tnis I assume to be trie view of His &lt;* Majesty's Government since otherwise tnere would nave been no need to pass tne special King's Regulation, (vide correspondence ending witn my memorandum No. 1488 /18/54, dateci tne Sind July, 1935,j in order to maice municipal taxes applicable to Britisn subjects. If my assumption is correet tnen no taxes can be applied to British subjects unless tuey are specifically a-ilovved in tne Treaty, 6, However, as state taxes are being paid it remains to examine eacn on its merits, since their continual payment is bound to arise in connection with tne revision of the Treaty. Tne Sultan will almost certainly press for con tinued payment. &gt; (f) Beit al Mai. In the time of Mohammed the term ®ait al Mai meant tne Government Treasury, i.e. the whole of tne revenues of Government, In Muscat, however, accord ing to tne Sultan, tne term denotes a particular form of payment, namely, tne rental on crown-lands leased out. 1 The tux is not claimeu from persons, amongst whom there are several Britisn subjects, who hold their lands in free hold, but only from tnose who are in occupation of crown- i lands. Tills rental is one of tne payments to wnicii British subjects/-subjects cbjeut. It seems clear to me, however, that tneir objection caimot be supported, since the payment is &amp; rsntal anci not a tax^ ^ me payment ox tills tax^ wiiich corresponds AriuiKx ... v n j ou-Aiis on the answer to tiie question of ex'- wnat exemption is conferrea by the/territoriality (see para graph 5 above)• {njTne fish tax t,urns on the same' principle as oiictt. Cx (o&gt;» except that it is possible tnat the produce may not oe caught in Muscat territorial waters, but on tne xiigb Seas. Part oi cnis tax, i.e. tne broicerage, seems to be municipal. (ij The boat tax is again a question of exterritorial rignts. Tnere are auout 9 boats owneu, by British subjects. (j) Vneifexxixi^ enct rKes. This is charged by the Muscat Customs Department. Tne second paragraph of article 6 of tne Treaty states as follows:- 'Tnis auty, once paid, snail cover, from all otner cnarges on tne part of his highness tne Sultan, gooas of whatever description coming from foreign countries oy sea, whether tnese are intended for local consumption or foe ) transmission eslewhere in bulk or otherwise, and whetuer tney remain in tne state in wnicn tney are imported or nave been manufactured'. If this is to be read strictly tnen it would appear tuat tne Britisn subjects are not liable to extra weigning cnarges. On the other hand, I believe tnat sucn cnarges are made by tne Customs Depart ment in other countries and if sucn charges are made by tne Indian Customs, e.g. at Karachi and Bombay, it might be argued tnat tney are similarly applicable in Muscat. * 7. I discussed tne question of these taxes at length with jdis hignness tue Sultan and witn Major Watts on my recent visit to Muscat. The Sultan contended tnat these taxex/-taxea xn coula be legally appliea to Britisn subjects I informea His Highness tnat I woula report the whole matter to His Majesty's Government ana obtain their decision on tne matter ana tnat in the meantime Britisn subjects coula continue paying/taxes without prejuaice to tne final settlement of tne question. I was influencea in this view by tne fact tnat the payment of tne taxes is a custom which nao becomt firmly establisned in tne course of time ana suo Swop tneir payment would iiave been impolitic. I suggest tiiai, tnere shoula be no cxiange in tne status qua uni/j.1 wixe provisions oi one new Treaty xiave been agreed upon.

I am sligntly perturbed over delay in opening I negotiations for renewal of Muscat Treaty. Sultan nas now arrived back in Muscat, but owing to nis ambitious ecneme of travel we may only nave September for negotiation. It seems therefore important to give Watts line at earliest possible moment, 2, I discussed wnole case witn Powle before leaving and presume ne gave you his views on way tnrougn London. 3. In first place it seems to me undesirable to appoint Watts Plenipotentiary under Article 23 of old Treaty, Watts must be in position to report and Pleni potentiary snould be Resident, I tnerefore suggest Yatts in Sultan's own woi'da oe 'autnorieed to directly open negotiations'. Line migxit be tnat as Sultan nas asked for revision Watts must first ascertain and report his views and cannot in any way commit his Majesty 's Govern ment. We cannot presumably in any case agree to surrender extra-territorial rignts and Watts must be quite firm on I this from outset, but Powle tnougnt tnat ne mignt after i snow of opposition agree to consult Resident regarding possibility /I /s-s- -2- possibility of subjecting Britiaa subjects to taxation. In matter of* tariff autonomy Watts would merely report any representations made by Sultan, 4. It Has been suggested tJaat i^ would suit our book if Sultan could be manoeuvred into making application for forraal protection external ana internal. History of ^ Muscat shows tiiat formal guarantee of tnis kind would merely \ be refognition of position actually existing. Tne suggestion would not be to embody sucn guarantee in Treaty bat in excJiange of notes. Altnougn I am doubtful wnetiier sultan would attacia sufficient weignt to formal guarantee of tnis nature to give it bargaining value Vatcs mignt be instructed to encourage any advances in tnis direction if made by Sultan. 5.

I recommend Watts be instructed to e-xpla in to Sultan that stage has not been reached for appointment of plenipotentiary by either party. Article 23 itself implies that proposed amendments must be put forward before stage can be reached at which plenipotentiaries can decide on and adopt them, and Political Agent is only authorised in Sultan's own words to open negotiations by ascertaining what amendments His Highness proposes. His Majesty's Goyernment could not at present stage agree to any procedure committing them to final negotiation of a fresh agreement where no basis for negotiation exists. Bearing of revision on Treaties between Muscat and other powers, and necessity for concurrence of certain Dominions, seem to be arguments which could be used in support of this position. Goramunicat ion to Sultan might be couched in language of some firmness, though Political Agent would be instructed to keep discussions on friendliest basis and make full use of personal relations. 3 0 Argument might be further reinforced by reference to abortive negotiations of 1905 and 1910, in both which cases Sultan /n- !

Dated 13th October 1937 Revision of the Muscat Treaty* ^ » f Reference my tslegrani No» 97 dated 11th October 1937, last paragraph. 1 forward herewith a brief report &amp;£ niy impressions of the general attitude and desiderata of the Sultan in the matter of the revision of the 1891 Treaty as gathered during the course of the discussions on the subject which hay e recently taken place. 2. The outstanding feature of the discussions is the very candidly expressed opinion of the Sultan that at the present moment, and for some time past, the existence of the 1891 Treaty has con stituted a burden and an infliction on his State. The Sultan 1 s ideas on the question summarised up are that the British Indian objects, who form the most prosperous section of the community and s. 6. who/ 1515 s&amp;p—(m-2089)—2-4-35—200,000.who could contribute better than any other towards the cost of public services and the maintenance generally of the State, are exempt from nearly all form of taxation. Even in respect of the Customs Tariff, from which the greater part of his Bevenues is derived, the Treaty binds and restricts fiim from imposing what duties he would like so far as British subjects are concerned in whose hands lie almost the whole of the import trade of the country. The Treaty, according to the Sultan, is almost entirely one sided in the benefits it confers and the Muscat State obtains practically nothing in return. •♦It is true M , he said, 'that the British Government have in the past given me some help such as during the troubles at Sur and Khassab a few years ago but that is quite another matter*. The Sultan thus airily dismissed, as scarcely worthy of being mentioned, instances of the support given to his State which alone prevents it from breaking up into pieces and certainly ceasing to exist as a separate entity. The Sultan is a young man with little knowledge of worldly realities as his ancestors possessed from bitter experieaice evea iii the only really serious difficulties he has had to encounter, i.e. financial, has had his pith smoothed and assured by the backing of the British Government. Though probably at the bottom of his heart he knows he could not stand alone he has to a very large extent persuad ed himself into the belief that he can. Certainly numerous remarks that he has made to me during the last few months all go to indicate that he considers that the Oman menace, which to his Father and Grandfather was a very real and ever present danger, now no longer exists. 3. To anyone without an understanding of the peculiar circumstances existing in Muscat, the L Treaty must appear, it seems to me, a lob-sided one as regards I the/the party who stands to benefit from it. As the Sultan . : ... ... ... , • .... * 2* ' * ■*&gt;; pointedly remarked to me, there is no guarantee or even mention in the Treaty that help would be given by the British Government if his State were to become involved in hostilities with a Foreign Power though no doubt, he said, it would be forthcoming. 4, The privileges which we enjoy as a most favoured Nation under the 1891 Treaty may, I think, be roughly divided into 3 essential features; (a) Extra Territoriality r'*-- t . ■ of British subjects both acxEt: as regards their persons and property, (b) Restriction of the right of the Muscat Govern ment to impose customs duties and (c) Various other matters of relatively minor importance dealing' with trade and other facilities granted to British subjects. As regards (a)t The Sultan has stated to me that so far as the jurisdiction in civil and criminal matters is concerned ke is willing to leave this, as hitherto, in the hands of the British Authorities, but as regards their exemption from Muscat Government taxation he is not prepared to continue the present arrangement. It is this privilege of immunity from Muscat Government laws and taxation which rankles more than any other in the Sultan's mind, and for the abolition of i/sfliich he is determined. It is impossible, he declared, to provide funds for the many improvements required in the State by only taxing his own subjects, who could not in justice be asked to bear a burden from which the comparatively well to do British Indian community were free. The Sultan declares he is quite willing to bind himself in the new Treaty not to impose on British subjects any taxes not paid by the subjects of most favoured nations and they would oi course be equally applicable to Musxsat subjects. As regards (b)8 the Sultan demands the right of full Tariff Autonomy in respect of his dealings with all countries. I gather he understands this freedom will entail/entail revision of his Treaties with other Foreign Powers. Concerning item (c)i the principal changes the Sultan requires are in all cases complete reciprocity in treatment for his State and. his subjects when trading with or travelling or residing in British possessions. 6. I am working through the Articles of the Treaty with the Sultan one by one and as stated in my telegram cited above, hope to hasre completed, the drafts in time to despatch to you by the Up Mail leaving Muscat on October 19th.

As the existence ox such a department is an indispensable necessity in modern times, We have decided to establish a special department to carry out this project which is one of advantage to both the country and its people. This department will be independent in the enactment of its own regulations and the carrying out of its duties as provided by them, and whatever comes under this, such as ( the issue of ) notifications etc. It is, however, well known that the maintenance of such a project requires an adequate contribution. Therefore, we have imposed one anna on each package which is liable to customs duty both in Muscat and Mattrah. This notification will be known as Municipal Notification No.l of ±8 1556.

Tax is not included in those listed in Fowle*a letter, but Sultan states HARRASI will be withdrawn simultaneously with imposition of new tax, and no further municipal taxation imposed at present. Tax in my opinion is in principle unobjectionable \ and in accord with Gulf practice. 3, I had wished to leave question of municipal organization and taxation until Powle's return. As however municipal taxation on British subjects is regularised by King's Regulation Uo,l of 1935 and in view of Suit an* s real interest in question and importance of time factor, I /I propose, if Fowle has no objection, to authorise this tax forthwith in hope of obtaining readier co-operation in Treaty matters. 4, In other respects Sultan's municipal scheme, though not entirely in accord with Powle*s suggestions, bears marks of careful thought. Proposed Committee is to be joint for Muscat and Mattra and to consist of President and eight members (including three British subjects) nominated by Sultan for fixed period. There ia provision for annual budget. In authorising taxation it could be stipulated that approval to details of constitution would have to await further considera tion on powle* sreturn.

J. Idy dear Clauson, Your letter P. Z.4420/37 of the 14t]i July regarding the modification of the Muscat tariff. 2. We are not too happy about the terms of the Sultan's reply. Had he confined this to acknowledging that the French acceptance of the increased tariff was subject to the reserved conditions (a) and (h) of the Political Resident's note of the 19th June, 1933 all might have 'been well and we might have 'been able to ask the French to waive their original wish for a textual I ^ *11 Li /Js repetition in the Sultan's note of the French conditions (a) and (b) (see paragraph 4 of the French Government's —note verbale of the 18th December, 1935 a copy of which was enclosed in Foreign Office letter E.7496/1737/91 of the 17th March 1936 to the India Office). As it is we do not feel that we can put the last sentence forward to the French Government as it stands. We can hardly understand its precise significance here, so what the French would make of it there is no knowing. It is of course possible that the translation is at fault and that the sense could be made clearer in the English without doing violence to the principles of translation. 3. If what the Sultan means is that so far as the present notes are concerned he is free to charge any duty he likes on goods arriving in non-French vessels (United States and Dutch excepted), provided the charges are 10% or more, that is probably true (subject to treaty rights of other countries) and possibly unobjectionable for the French). 4. G lauson, Esq..4. If however he means that unless and until goods begin to arrive at Muscat in French vessels, the notes do not take effect at all and that he can charge what duty he likes - even less than 10^ - on goods arriving in other vessels (United States and Dutch excepted) that appears to he a more dubious proposition. 5. Would you then explain our difficulty to the Political Resident and a sk him to try to obtain some elucidation from the Sultan when in due course he returns to affairs of State. It would of course be preferable if the Sultan could be again approached and induced to (-.9 reply in the terms of the draft note previously prepared, with, if needs be, the addition of a sentence embodying his intended reservation in more precise terms. 6.

Since the despatch of our telegram No March 1937 not much progress has been made in respect of the negotiations over French loges. We have, however agreed somewhat reluctantly with the French proposal that these negotiations should take place in Paris instead of in India. The French Government are keen on *&amp; decision of principle % and the compromise which we have suggested, namely, the cession of jurisdiction in return for the recognition of French sovereignty, is not likely to be attained. It would therefore be of sane advantage if, as a quid prolquo for the abrogation of the provision in the Gommercial Treaty of 1856 which limits the rates of customs duties to be levied in Morocco to 10 % , we could /4« / ■; iTN / /■■ , l / f i i I ! .! : ! ^ 'i fctf could demand the cession of French jurisdiction in the 1 Loges. On the other hand, the French Government might argue that to raise this question in connection with the proposed commercial negotiations regarding Morocco, is to betray a premature lack of confidence in the success of the impending negotiations regarding the Loges. Moreover it must be admitted that the cession of jurisdiction in the French Loges is not a very appropriate set-off against the abrogation of the limits on the French right to levy customs duties in Morocco. In any case the French Government seem likely to adhere to their contention, which seems plausible, that article 7 of the Commercial Treaty of 1856 is of a capitulatory nature and therefore must go, without any quid pro quo ^ g| with the rest of the capitulatory rights which have been abolished. For these reasons we consider that nothing will be gained by introducing questions connected with French possessions in India into the proposed commercial negotiations. 3. As regards the proposal that the French rights under their Treaty of 1844 with the Sultan of Muscat should be linked with the question of British capitulatory and corrmercial rights in Morocco it would seem technically that we have no locus standi to negotiate with French Government on behalf of Muscat which is an independent State. We appear however to have been doing so in the past, vide India Office memorandum No.PZ.195 3/ 36, dated the 20th March 1936, and letter No.PZ.3548/36, dated the 30th May 1936 and perhaps therefore no objection be raised on this score.■'X - 3 - 4. One point however requires consideration. The existence of the article in the Treaty of 1844 limiting the rates of customs duties which the Sultan of Muscat can impose on French goods makes it virtually impossible foi him to demand the right of applying rates in excess of the same limit to British goods. If the article concerned in the French Treaty is abrogated before the new commercial treaty which we are about to negotiate with Muscat is signed it seems likely that we shall be compelled to agree to the Sultan imposing such customs duties as he pleases within reasonable limits on our 4 4 goods. For this reason also we deprecate the proposal to link the question of French rights in Muscat with that of British rights in Morocco. 5. Oar observations in paragraph 3 and 4 are subject to any comments the Political Resident in the Persian G-ulf may wish to make. The issue of the above has been authorised.

Sultan is demanding complete tariff autonomy (my telegram No # 981 of 16th October), and it may bee one necessary for us to concede his wishes in order to secure ex-territorial rights, I still think therefore that readiness to assist him in securing at any rate seme modification of tariff restrictions imposed by treaties with foreign powers offers fair chance of securing our own desiderata, and should have advantages in other ways e.g. doubts expressed in paragraph 3 of your letter, 2. If it were possible to indicate to Sultan that France «And U.S.A, are likely to consult His Majesty's Govern ment over modifications in their treaties with Muscat, Sultan' sovereign conscience might be reassured. 3.

It does not appear neceaaary from tiie legal point of view for tne Governments of tne United Kingdom, tne United States of America, STance and Holland to agree to the abolition of tne tariff limit; before Muscat can enjoy tariff autonomy. As regards tne United Kingdom, once tne Commercial Treaty of 1891 lapses tne Sultan is free to impose any tar iff on Brit ish goods. 3. As regards tne Treaties with tne United States of America (1833) and Prance (1844) the prevailing view pa^agrapn 3 of Foreign Office letter No.E/3245/4/91 of 19-7-1932 to the India Of! ice) is tnat tne Muscat State could, upon giving reasonable notice, denounce tnese Treaties or at least the provisions in them wnicn are of a commercial nature (and secure tariff autonomy as far as tne States are concerned), 4. As Holland^ under tne Commercial Declaration of 1877^ merely enjoys most-favoured-nation rignts, and not;, txie right to any Specified rate of tarilT, once tne Sultan is free of Ms obligations to tne United Kirgdom, France and the United States of America and can impose any tariff ne likes, so long as He does not discriminate tne -^eclarat ion would not stand in His way. 5. I submit for perusal the correspondence leading to the Foreign Office letter quoted in paragraph 3 above i.e. Sir H.Biscoe's letter ITo.215-S of the 7tn April 1932 'and Government of India letter No.D-1673-.N/32 of tne 11th May 1932. it will be seen from paragraph 5 of the former that the idea of denouncing the Treaty with tne United States of America has occurred to Sultan, V'l #r l/ -» / J 11- -7 PUG(4) ^ 4 &gt;• npinn'''! ^ ^ f ^ f j \X.
