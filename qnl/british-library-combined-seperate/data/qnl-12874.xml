The statement also contains details of their aliases and disguises and includes postscripts to the original statement regarding a paper which Palgrave gave to Eesa regarding a scheme to 'revolutionize the country and institute another religion among the Wahabis (ff 1-5)The second statement was written by Mr Rozario, the Medical Charge at the Muscat Political Agency who encountered Palgrave in Muscat in 1863 and provided him with assistance as he was living as a mussulman but was having difficulty in observing the fasting period owing to suffering from fever and was permitted to use Mr Rozario's home in order to partake of food and wine.
