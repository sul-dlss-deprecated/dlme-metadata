My defign is firfi, to inform the Reader, that I have reduced this Work to a much leffer compafi than the Original Spanifh ; yet at the fame time nothing of the H'tftorical Vart is diminifhed, perhaps fome of the Ornament, I have not omitted the mofi monfiderahle pafjage^ nor Jeffned any ma terial circumflances ; all that has been cut fff is only long Speeches, for the mofl part nsverThe Tranflator 'he i never thought tf hy thofe they are fatht^fef ed upori) only added hy the Author to jtj // out his Work ; tedious Lifts of Offict\ nuc l and Gentlemens Names who were prefers a at any Confiderahle Aft ions, which Nam^ n i are of no ufe to us \ thofe of the Cctoear manders in Chief, and fuch as particulahncli] Jignalized themjelves, being fuffictent fher Hiftory; and Jome flights and reflettmhat of the Author, which only ferve to mtver up the hulk of a Volume.

It is the biggeft about the Mouth of the RedSea t but has no Ports fit for any great number.of Ships to winter. Athwart the middle of it runs a ridge oi Hills as high as the Clouds, yet not frep from the Sand of the Shoar, which is carri ed up to the very top by the North Winds, and is therefore barren, not only of Plants but Trees, only /(bme linall Valleys that are under (helter of thole Winds. It is diltant from the Arabian Continent 5-0 Leagues^ and 30 from Cape Guardafu. The Ports moft ufed by us, are Zocoy inhabited by Moors; or Calancea to the Weftward, and Bent to the Eaftward.

There was a (harp skir- mifh, the Moors endeavouring to carry him off, and ours to hinder it, till he and eight more were flain. The Enemy fled to the Caftle, which was Icaled, and thole who entred opening the Gate, gave entrance into a very large Court, prefently polfefled by our men. About the inwar^l Fort was a bloodyChap.

The Mofque was cleanfed and made a Church of the Invo cation of our Lady of Victory, and many were there baptized; in which Pious oik the Labours of F.Antony of St. Franas were very remarkable. Cunna gave the Com mand of the Fort, now called St. Michael* to Don Alfonfo de Noronha, who had well dc- lerved it by his Valour, though he had not been appointed for it by theKmgi he na med his other Officers, and gave hini 100 men.

But the Viceroy Don Francifco (hewed him a greater Power than he imagined to defend tha Trade of Malabar, compofing a Squa dron of ten Ships, whereof he gave the Command to his Son Den Lorenzo. There remained behind at Cananory Gonx*alo Vaz with his Velfel, taking in AVater, who fol lowed, and meeting a Ship of Cananor with a Portugues Pais, he funk it, and all the M &gt;ors fcwed up in aSai), that they might never be feen.

Don Lorenzo lay before the Port otCbaul, when ieven Ships arrived, which taking no notice that he (aluted them, ftood in without making any return. He followed them in his Boats, and the Moors leaped overboard to gain the Shear, but he was fo ready to receive them, that many perifhed by the way. 7'he Ships were laden with Horfes, and other Goods, in the (ale whereof fome of the Moors dealing deceitfully,Dew Lorenzo ordered them all to be burnt, to their great admiration, becaufe Covctodneis had not moved him '■ ■ - to (Chap.l. the Tortugues Afiai to fave any part thereof. Imagining he fliould find the Fleet of Calicut at Dabul, he {ailed thither, and anchored at the Mouth of the River, where difcovering the Fleet, and the narrownefs of the place to engage, it was carried in Council to defift, contra ry to the Opinion of Dm Lorenzo, who was inflamed with a defire of fighting. He paf- fed on 4 Leagues, and a Brigantin and Parao that had the Van, faw a Ship failing up the River. They purfued all it calt Anchor over againft a Town, where were many other Veflels. Don Lorenzo feeing the two Veffels follow the Ship, ^nt alter them a Galley, and they three together began to clear the Shoar with their Shot, of many Moors who flocked thither. The noile of Cannon called upon Don Lorenzo, He made hafte, but before his coming up, the others had gained the Velfels in the Harbour, and afhoar burnt a Houie full of confiderable Merchandife. All the Ships in the Har bour were burnt, except two they carried away laden with Riches from Ormuz,. At his return to Cochin with Vidory and Spoils, heexpeded to be received by his % Father with joy, and applaufe ; but he on the con trary defigned to punifti him feverely for not fighting the Fleet of Calicut, and was ex- culed only, becaufe it appeared he was over- IWayed by the Votes of all the Captains, contrary to his own Opinion.

This Action was not known there, and the blame was laid upon Laurence it Brito, Captain of the Fort, whole Pais that Ship carried. Brito having difcovered the defign, and finding himfelf weak, adverd- fed the Viceroy. The Meffage was deliver ed him at Church, whilft he afliftcd at the Service of Maundy Thurfday, and he imme diately left the Church, and went about ta king up from every one what Provifions they had, and Ihipped the men with fuch hafte, that thofe who had lent their Arms to them who watched at the Sepulchre (as the cuftom is) went to the Church to dif- arm them. Don Lor en $3 was Captain, and had Orders when he came to Cananor to obey Laurenct de Brito. But Brito infifted, that the other, as Son of the Viceroy, and 16 Famous an Officer, Ihould command; Don Lorenzo was pofitivc, he would obey Bntd, as being Commander of the Fort, and in purfuance of his Fathers Orders. But finding Britc refblved to perfift in that Cour- tefie, and that it might prove dangerous, he left the Relief, and returned alone to Ccch'ti' 1Chap. I. Tkt Portugues Afa. Cochm. The Befieged fortified and entren ched themfelves, the lame was done by the Bellegersi who were icooo ftrong. Much Blood was fpilt about the Water of a Well, but our men by the help ot a Mine, made themfelves Mailers of it. The Moors alter this lofs retired to a Wood ot Palm-trees, to prepare Engines to batter the Fort. Our Commander had intelligence of it by means of a Nephew of the King of Cananor^ who endeavoured to gain our Friendfhip. He prepared to receive them, and when they gave the affault, fucceeded fowell, firft with his Cannon, and then with the Sword, that he filled the Ditch with their Bodies, which they intended to have done with Faggots. They retired to the Wood, and Brito lend ing out by Night 80 men, commanded by one Guadalajara a Spaniard, who was his Lieutenant, the Sally was fo vigoroufly ex ecuted by the firing of lome fmall Pieces firft, in a cold rainy Night, that the Ene my in a confternation knew not where to fave themlelves, 300 were killed. But this Joy was abated by the Magazine of Provi- fions taking fire, fo that Hunger began to rage, and all Vermin was eaten. The Gar- rilbn, part fick and part famiihed, was re duced to extremity j but the Sea being then rough, left abundance of Lobfters when it went off on the Point of Land where our Chappel was, which were the only re- our men had. The Zamori lent a pow- e rful lupply to the King of Cananor, who gave the laft aflfauk to the Fort by Sea and Land,114 The Fortugues Afia. Part II Land, with above yoooo men, who wer^ vigoroufly received and repulled with great lofs, not one of our men being killed in thi s a^ion. But now arrives Trifiande Cunnn and the King of Cananor terrified with his coming, and the defence made by Brito, fues for Peace, which was concluded with great honour to the Portugues Valour. 6. Triftan de Cunna was upon his return home with the Merchant Ships, and the Viceroy bore him company in order to fall upon Panane , a Town (ubjed to Calicut, where our Enemies laded under the flbelter of four Ships of the Zamori, Commanded hyCutiale a Couragious Moor. The Vice roy and Tnfian anchored at the Bar, held a Councel, and then fent both their Sons in two Barques with leveral Boats, and they in a Gaily followed them. They all went up the River through Showers of Balls lent from the Shoar, which is high. The Moors run into the Water to meet our Boats, and killed three men. But the diipute was now come to their Trenches, which fbtne oi ours mounted, and ?eter Cam iet upon them Don Lorenfos Colours. The Colours were tfying, when the Viceroy (eeing his Son Don Lorenzo climing with (bme difficulty, cried out Ah / Laurencef Laurence, what lazinefs is that; and he very readily anfwered.

After this Vidory they returned to Cananor to take in (ome lading, and Triftan de Cunna let lail for Tor- tugal. At Mo$ambttjue he met fome Ships of ii that came from Lisbon the year before.

Our men now poifeTfed of the Pal- lance, fell to plundering, without ftiame or fenfe of honour, and with as much difor- der as if they had been on the Shoar, and their Enemy deftroyed. The Enemy now reinforced, returned, and falling upon our difordered men, put all into great confu- fion, killing many under their Burdens, and doing great harm, though Pajco de Syhejrt fignalized himlelf,killing two of thier Chiefs, whom they call CajmaUi.

While. he is employed about this Bufineft, we will give fome account of what was done by two of the Captains fpoken of in the beginning of the third Chapter, which could not con veniently be inierted before. 2. One of thefe two Captains was Vuarte &amp; Lemojy who, after a Storm, arrived at the place called Medones de Oro, thence he went to Madagafcar, or the Ifland of St. Laurence, ^nd thence to Mozmhiqnt, where the reft of *57The Portuguei Afia.

From Mezambique he failed to Mtlindt ; then fet out to vifit fome Iflands of that Coaft that had negleded to pay the ufual Tribute to Quiloa fince it was taken. Monfia fub- mitted immediately; 7janz,ibar made reli- ftance r but they were drove to the Moun tains, and the Town plundered. At Pemh hapned the lame, the Inhabitants flying to MonbaZja, leaving nothing in their Houles; but lome little plunder was taken in a Fort whether the Xetjue had conveyed fuch things as he had not time to fecure otherwife. Lemoi gave the necelfary Orders at Melindey par ticularly in relation to the Fadory for the Trade of Zofala. Hence he fet out with leven Sail for the Coaft of Arabia j one V e(- fel Commanded by Gregory de Quadra, in- lenfibly was (eparated from the reft in the Night on the Coaft of Magadoxa, and car ried by the Current to the Mouth of the Red Sea, where the City Zetla is ieated, and was there taken. Lemos refolved to take a view of OrmuZj, and managed the Towns of that Coaft more with cunning than force. The fame at Ormuz,, where he received oi the King and Coje Atar the 15000 Xera- phens, impofed on them as Tribute by All*' querojue, and was well treated. Hence he lent to India, Vajco de Sylveyra i who was killed at Calicut. Then he failed to Zocotora, mChap. IV.

The Win- tvr being pafled, he returned to Zocotora, and found there Francis Pantoja, who came from India with Provifions, and had taken a rich Ship of Cambaya, the great wealth whereof he (hared with Lernos his men, faying they had right to it, as being taken in the Pre- cin6ts of his Government. A rare example of Bounty. Lemos finding himfelf unprovi ded ior other undertakings, failed to Indiay and was received by Albuquerque with great Pomp and Civility. The other of the two Captains menti- oneo was James Lopez, de Siqueira, who was entrulled with the difcovery of the Ifland of Madagafear zn&amp; Malaca. In the Ifland St. Laurence he arrived in the Port of St. Se- 'rftan.

A Boat came to Lopez, his Ship to enquire who they were; he anfwered, there was an Embaflfador t'rooi the King of Portugal who came to propofc fuch things as might be advantagious to that City.

Then he gave credit to the advice fent him from a Perfian Hoftefs by Duarte Fernandez, after fte had endeavoured to come aboard at Night, and was not admitted by SecjMeyra, judging it fome Love Intrigue, but it pro ved one means to fave thole Ships. Lopez, excufed him(elf by counter fitting an indiipo- fition. Another way was contrived to carry on the Treachery, which was by offering lading of Spice, faying it was requifite to fend for it to three leveral places. This took lb well, that 30 men were lent accord ing to agreement, whilft a Fleet of feveral VeiTels was behind a Point of Land, ready to affault our Ships, at the iame time the ;o were killed in the Town.

The reafbn of this furrender was, that the Turk Ta$u had terrified them with the relation of what he had leen a few Portugueles do, and that a Jogue ( thefe are Religious Men among thofe People, efteemed Saints and Prophets) w not long before had declared, that place fliould fbon be lubjed: to Strangers, dlbu- 1 1 querque accepted the offer, and anchoring before the City on the 1 'jth of February, was received on the Shoar as if he had been their Natural Prince.

At his death he faid, that his Son George Galvam and all his Men were caft away in their Veffel, and that in the Ifland of Dalaca they had cut off the Heads ot Laurence de Cofme and others that were lent thither.

Caldera went to ferve Ancofian, an Officer of Htdalcan, D. Gutierre demanded him, becaufe he de^ fired not his abfence that way. Ancojtan refufed to deliver him.

It was well fortified and ftored with Cannon, commanded by a Portugm Renegado. In the River were many Vef- (els in order of Battel: The Fight began fu- rioufly by Sea and Land, the Fortifications were entred, the Cannon taken, and the Enemy fled to the Woods. The Town and Veflels in the Port were burnt, many kill ed, of our Men nine. Next day tweire Ships were burnt in the Port of Caltcnt, and D. John de Liwa did the lame in the Skirts of the City. Hence they went to Couleti, where was the (ame Fortification, number of Ships, and Artillery as at Panane, and twenty thoufand Men in Garrilbn. 5. A Council of War being held, it was generally voted to defift from lo dangerous an Enterprize, but D. Enrique prevailed for going on. D. Simon de Alenefes was to command one Attack with 300 Men, D.

The two Antomes agreed to fpread themfelves crols the Mouth of that Sea, that fb no E- nemy-Ship might elcape them. This Mouth reaching from Cape Guardafu in Africk, to Cape Fartacjue in Arabia is fifty Leagues over. Here they took ten Zambncos and three Ships.

Now the King of Calicut refolved to befiege that Fort in which D. John Je Lim commanded with three hundred Men. Twelve thoufand Men broke ground to draw a deep Trench about. D. John did all that was poffible to hinder the Work, but the multitude prevailed and finifhed it, Then they planted many pieces of Can non, fome fo large the Ball was two fpans diameter. The Work being fimftied, Za* mori came on with nine thoufand Men. This Power was enough to terrifie any Re- folution ; yet D. John was not moved, but ventured to make a Sally, which had like to have coft him his lite, fb he refolved to itand firm againftall their Aflaults. 8. The Battery began funoufly at break of day on the thirteenth of June. Our Cannon was more dexteroufly played, and didr great harm, but it appeared not fo much in the multitude. Next day advice was (ent to the Governor, who immediately lent to their Relief two Caravels, with one bun* dred and fifty Men, commanded by Chri- fioyher Jujarte and Duarte Fonjeca. The former arrived firft, and there was a Inarp dilpute by Sea and Land about their entering the Fort, in which three Gentlemen ^ ere killed*Chap. IX. Tlje Tortugues Afia. killed.

Whilft they failed, all the military Arts then in ufe were pra(5iifed againft the be- fieged, and above §fty of them killed. 9. This Relief could not reach Calicut, but was forced back to Cochin. The Go vernor joined two Squadrons he had pre pared, and they both appeared to the di- ftreffed Fort, when Rap;e and Defpair ad- ed more in its Defence than Valour or Con- ^ud. He51 or it Silveyra commanded one of the Squadrons containing leven Ships, and Peter de, Faric the other of twenty five, and three hundred and thirty Men.

A Council was held about landing, all the Votes were in the negative. D. Enrique ipent Four days in conlidenng what to do, then came to this Reiblution. One night he put one hundred and nfty Men into the Fort under the valiant Hector de Silveyra, and the next as many jnore under JD. Jamet de Lima. By'break of day he landed, clearing the Shore of Wrongs of Enemies with Shot, Granados, and 287Cha x88 The iToriugues Afia. Part III. and all forts of Weapons.

Still frefli vice was brought of the danger the be- fieged were in, and ftill D. Garcia wafted th^ time in confidering of means to relief them, without chuling any, or taking the advife of Cuna. Thus the Siege was railed before he found the method of relieving, having gathered one hundred and fixty Sail for that purpofe. • 20.
