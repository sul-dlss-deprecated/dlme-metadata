He writes that he has written to the Agent at Bahrain on the subject and that every enquiry should be made into the affair to prevent its recurrence. He states that the Shaikh of Bahrain should be held responsible for the coast that is subject to him, but doubts that his authority extends inland.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023673714.0x000005#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
